CHAPTER I

CAUGHT IN THE ACT

âGee whiz, but that was a hot one!â exclaimed Fred Martin, as he wrung his
hands after throwing back the ball with which he and his chum, Bobby Blake,
were having a little pitching practice on the Rockledge School campus.

âHad pepper on it, did it?â laughed Bobby, as he gripped the ball in readiness
for another throw.

âIt fairly smoked,â commented Sparrow Bangs, who was stretched lazily on the
ground near by. âBobby, youâve got speed to burn this season.â

âIf he pitches that way against Belden it will be all over except the
shouting,â remarked Mouser Pryde, who was the second baseman of the Rockledge
team.

âBobbyâll need all heâs got when we tackle those fellows, if what I hear is
true,â put in Billy Bassett. âA fellow was telling me the other day that they
have a couple of new batters on their team who can fairly kill the ball, while
the rest are pretty handy with the stick.â

âIâll back Bobby against the bunch,â said Howell Purdy loyally. âHeâs beaten
them before and he can beat them again.â

âDonât be too sure,â laughed Bobby. âThereâs nothing certain in baseball, and
theyâre a pretty husky bunch to stack up against. Whenever weâve beaten them
weâve known at least that weâve been in a fight.â

âWe sure have,â agreed Perry Wise, a fat boy who had been nicknamed âPee Weeâ
in sarcastic reference to his size.

âWe,â repeated Jimmy Ailshine, in derision. âWhere do you get that âweâ stuff?
You never caught a ball or hit one in your life.â

âHavenât I always rooted for the team to beat the band?â asked Pee Wee, in an
injured tone. âWhat would the nine do without somebody to root for it when the
pinch comes? As a rooter, Iâm a wonder.â

âSure,â said Mouser soothingly. âAnd Shiner is wrong when he says you never
caught a ball. I saw you catch one last winterâa snowball, right on the end of
your nose.â

The boys laughed and Pee Wee glared.

âYou fellows stop picking on Pee Wee,â said Billy Bassett. âWith all your
kidding, there are some things in which heâs away ahead of you boobs.â

âName them,â demanded Fred.

âFor instance,â remarked Sparrow incredulously.

âWell,â replied Billy, âheâs more polite than any of you, for one thing.â

Pee Wee began to look interested, though a little puzzled. Although his
manners were fairly good, as boys go, he had never thought that politeness was
one of his outstanding virtues, nor had any one else called this fact to his
attention.

âHow do you make that out?â asked Howell Purdy.

âProve it,â challenged Mouser.

âAll right,â responded Billy. âHereâs the proof. When any of you are seated in
a crowded car where there are ladies standing, what do you do?â

âStand up and let a lady sit down,â replied Mouser, while the rest nodded
approval.

âExactly,â replied Billy. âYou stand up and let a lady sit down. And thatâs
where Pee Wee has it all over you in politeness. He stands up and lets three
ladies sit down.â

There was a moment of silence while this sank in, and then the boys broke into
a roar of laughter, while Pee Wee looked around for something to throw at his
tormentor, who adroitly skipped behind a tree.

Just at this moment, Mr. Carrier, one of the teachers, came along. He greeted
the boys pleasantly and they responded heartily, for he was a prime favorite
with all of them. The athletic games of the school came under his special
supervision, and he had the gift of imparting his own vim and enthusiasm to
the players. He had been a star himself both in football and baseball in his
college days, and his thorough knowledge of both great games made him a
first-class coach for the Rockledge boys. Under his tutelage, winning teams
had been turned out in the previous year, and he was eager that his teams
should repeat their triumph this season.

âPracticing up, I see,â he said, with a smile, as he nodded to Bobby.

âJust enough to keep my arm limber,â Bobby replied. âI want to be in shape for
our next big game.â

âAnd that comes off in less than two weeks now,â rejoined Mr. Carrier. âI hear
that the Belden nine is going great guns in practice and that the victory they
won over Somerset the other day has given them confidence. They figure, too,
that since weâve had the championship for some years the time is just about
due for them to have their turn. But we donât agree with them, do we?â he
added, with a twinkle in his eyes.

âNo, sir!â agreed Bobby. âTheyâre not going to carry off the Monatook League
pennant if we can help it.â

âIt does look pretty good on the Rockledge grounds, doesnât it?â remarked Mr.
Carrier, as he cast his eyes up on the flagstaff where the beautiful banner
fluttered in the breeze. âIâm depending on you boys to keep it there. Donât
forget the practice game to-morrow between the first and second nines.â

He passed on, and the boys looked after him with respect and admiration.

âHeâs a dandy,â commented Sparrow.

âIâll tell the world he is,â affirmed Mouser. âHeâs more like a pal than a
teacher, though heâs a mighty good teacher, at that.â

âOh, I say, fellows,â called out Billy, slipping out from behind his tree,
though still keeping a wary eye on Pee Wee, âthere was a man downtown this
morning putting up posters for a big circus thatâs coming over to Ridgefield
in a week or two. From what it said on the posters, itâs going to be a
humdinger.â

âTrying to get us on a string again?â asked Sparrow suspiciously.

âNo, honest I ainât,â asseverated Billy, forgetting his grammar in his
eagerness. âThis is straight goods. Itâs going to be in Ridgefield a week from
next Friday. Gee, how Iâd like to go!â

âWho wouldnât?â remarked Fred. âBut what good does it do us to have it in
Ridgefield? Thatâs twenty miles away, and you know the doctor wonât let us
go.â

âMaybe itâll come to Rockledge, too,â put in Howell hopefully.

âNo chance,â declared Billy. âI asked the man who was putting up the posters,
and he said that this town wasnât on the list.â

âThatâs too bad,â said Bobby regretfully. âI havenât been to a circus for a
long time and I sure would like to see it.â

âLikeâs no name for it,â chimed in Shiner. âIâm just crazy to see it. Just
think, fellows, the tightrope walkers and the bareback riders, the acrobats
turning somersaults over the elephants, the fellows swinging on the trapeze
and the horizontal barsââ

âAnd the clowns,â added Billy, as Shiner paused for breath.

âBilly likes the clowns because he can steal all their old chestnuts and pass
them off on us,â was Pee Weeâs vengeful dig.

âBut thereâs something new in this,â went on Billy, not deigning to notice Pee
Weeâs fling. âThey show a real Eskimo band, headed by a chief named Takyak who
has a trained walrus that can do all kinds of stunts. I never saw anything
like that in any circus Iâve ever been to.â

âWhatâs a walrus?â asked Shiner, who was not very strong on the subject of
natural history. âSomething like a shark?â

âNo, you silly,â returned Billy, who, fresh from his study of the posters, had
the advantage over his mates. âIt looks something like a seal, only itâs
bigger and fatterâoh, itâs as fat as Pee Weeââ Here the latter gave an
indignant snortââand itâs got big tusks and as much whiskers as those fellows
over in Russiaâyou know the ones I mean, those Bolsheviksâand itâs sure the
kind of thing I wouldnât like to meet up an alley on a dark night, and they
say it can do anything but talk, and the Eskimos had a big fight when they
captured it, but now theyâve got it so tame that it eats out of their hands,
and it lives on fish, and itâs got a bellow that you can hear for a mile andââ

âFor the love of Pete, somebody stop him,â cried Fred. âHeâs getting black in
the face. Youâd think he was a barker for the circus.â

But Billy was not to be stopped altogether, though the current of his
eloquence was changed by a thought that had come to him while he was talking.

âSay, fellows!â he exclaimed eagerly, âwhat I said about the Russians reminded
me of a joke!â

âWhat have we done that we should be punished like this!â moaned Shiner.

âMen have been killed for less crimes than Billyâs,â asserted Mouser.

âBut this is a good one,â Billy declared. âIt made me laugh when I heard it,
and I know a good joke when I hear one.â

âI donât believe it,â said Sparrow. âIf youâve ever heard a good one youâve
never passed it on to us.â

âBillyâs jokes are so poor that they wear rags,â proclaimed Howell.

âOr so old that theyâve got false teeth,â added Fred.

But Billy, undaunted by the general chorus, persisted.

âIâve got a dime in my pocket,â he began.

âIâll bet itâs plugged,â put in Pee Wee.

âI have a dime in my pocket,â repeated Billy with dignity, âand Iâll give it
to the fellow that can guess my joke before I can count twenty. That shows how
good I think it is.â

As Billy had calculated, this secured the instant attention of the boys, for
it was nearing the end of the term, pocket money was running low, and a
dimeâwell, a dime was a dime.

âLetâs see it,â said Sparrow cautiously.

Billy promptly produced it.

âThere it is,â he said. âTake a good look at it, for thatâs the nearest any of
you will ever get to it. You couldnât guess this joke in twenty years let
alone twenty seconds.â

âAll right,â said Fred impatiently. âGo ahead! Shoot!â

Billy leaned forward impressively.

âWhatâs the quickest change of nationality on record?â he asked.

Shiner scratched his head in perplexity.

âCome again,â he said. âI donât get you.â

Billy looked at him in patronizing scorn.

âWhy, you poor fish,â he explained, âa change of nationality is when a man
stops being a citizen of one country and becomes a citizen of another. Itâs as
if a Frenchman went to England and took the oath of allegiance to the English
king. Instead of being any longer a Frenchman heâd then be an English subject.
Or a Swede might come to this country and be naturalized here. Heâd no longer
be a Swede but an American. In other words, heâd have changed his
nationality.â

âCut it short, Billy,â interrupted Fred. âI want that dime.â

âYou wonât get it,â retorted Billy. âNow Iâll put it to you again. To change a
manâs nationality usually takes considerable time. Whatâs the shortest time
itâs ever been done in? Now Iâll start to count. Oneâtwoâthreeâââ

âI know,â shouted Pee Wee.

Billy, in some alarm, hurried on with his counting.

âFour, five, six, seven,â he rushed along.

âItâs this way,â sputtered Pee Wee, also in a hurry. âIt was a man climbing a
greased pole. He went up a Pole and he came down a rushinâ.â

Billy, who despite his frantic haste had been able to get up only to seventeen
in the count, turned scarlet.

âThatâs right,â he admitted reluctantly. âHow did you guess it?â

âOh, I heard that ages ago,â returned Pee Wee airily. âThat joke was old when
Noah went into the Ark. He used to tell it to Ham and Shem and Japhet when he
wanted to put them to sleep.â

Billy was crestfallen, but he was game and brought out the dime, which Pee Wee
promptly stowed away in his pocket.

âGee,â murmured Shiner, âI donât see why climbing a pole and coming down in a
hurry makes a man change his nationality.â

At this a roar of laughter went up. Finally it was Pee Wee, elated with his
victory, who explained.

âYou silly,â he said, âthe man went up a Poleâyou know what a Pole isâand came
down a capital R-u-s-s-i-a-n, Russian. Now do you see?â

âOh,â answered Shiner, crestfallen.

âGot any more jokes, Billy?â Pee Wee asked politely. âIf you have, bring them
out and Iâll guess them at the same price.â

Billy tried to think of a suitable retort, but the financial calamity that had
come upon him had paralyzed, for the moment, his gift of repartee.

âNever mind, Billy,â laughed Bobby, clapping him on the shoulder. âYou canât
always put it over. And, anyway, Pee Weeâs going to spend that dime to treat
the bunch and youâll have your share of the doughnuts.â

âSure thing,â said Pee Wee generously. âI can get ten doughnuts for a dime,
and I canât eat more than eight of them. The other two you fellows can divide
up among yourselves.â

âDonât give things away so recklessly, or I can see where youâll be going to
the poorhouse in your old age,â chaffed Fred.

âHeâll never live to be old,â put in Shiner. âHeâll die early from enlargement
of the heart.â

âMaybe heâll strain a point and give us three,â suggested Mouser hopefully.
âBut, anyway, letâs go down to the store and get them now while Pee Wee still
has the dime.â

âItâs a pretty long walk,â objected Pee Wee. âAnd what with that stone bruise
on my foot and the way Iâve been workingââ

âThatâs right!â observed Sparrow. âWe forgot all about that stone bruise. It
isnât fair to make poor Pee Wee go all that way. He can give us the dime and
weâll go down and get the doughnuts and bring him back his share.â

This appealed to all but Pee Wee, who had well-grounded fears that they would
bring back his share inside of them.

âI guess I can make it,â he said, getting heavily to his feet. âBut letâs take
our time. Thereâs no use going at it as if we were running a Marathon.â

He led the way with the air of a monarch followed by his retainers, and not
one of them stayed behind, for the lure of the doughnut was too strong to be
resisted.

âLetâs take the short cut down the school lane,â suggested Fred, and as this
met with general approval they turned off into a lane that led down past the
private orchard of Dr. Raymond, the head of the school.

They had not gone more than a hundred yards when Bobby gave an exclamation.

âLook at that big touring car at the side of the road,â he ejaculated,
indicating a powerful looking automobile that was standing under the shadow of
some trees close to the fence that skirted the orchard.

âWhatâs it doing there, I wonder,â remarked Fred. âThis isnât a public road,
and I never before saw an automobile in it, except the doctorâs own car.â

âMaybe it belongs to some friends who have come to call upon him,â hazarded
Shiner.

âOr somebody who switched off into the lane by mistake,â guessed Sparrow.

As the chums drew nearer they could see that the car was empty with the
exception of the driver. He was a rough-looking fellow with a coarse, mottled
face, shifty eyes and generally uncouth appearance. His cap was drawn down
over his low forehead and a half-smoked cigarette dangled loosely from his
lips.

âLooks like a tough customer, doesnât he?â murmured Fred, in a low voice to
Mouser, who was next to him.

âHe sure does,â returned the latter. âNo friends of the doctor would have a
fellow like that to drive for them.â

Bobby had given one quick glance at the driver and then his eyes roved over to
the orchard. What he saw gave him a start.

âLook, fellows!â he cried. âThose fellows are robbing the doctorâs orchard!
And theyâve tackled that prize thousand-dollar tree with the early apples!â

He made a rush for the fence with his comrades close behind him.

CHAPTER II

AT CLOSE QUARTERS

The fellow in the driverâs seat of the big automobile dropped his cigarette
and half started from his seat as he heard Bobbyâs words and saw him making
for the fence.

âHey, youse!â he shouted, âwhat are youse buttinâ in for? Keep out of this.
Get right along anâ mind your own business.â

âNobody asked for your advice,â shouted Bobby, as he scaled the fence and
dropped on the other side. âCome along, fellows, and come quick.â

At a little distance from the fence stood a tree that the doctor, who was an
enthusiast on fruit growing, prized above all his other possessions. It bore
an exceedingly rare species of apple that matured early in the season, had a
delicious flavor and was highly valued by experts. It was a new variety, and
it was understood that the doctor had paid as much as a thousand dollars for
it with a view to developing in time a whole orchard of the same species. The
boys had often heard him talk about it, and they knew how much he valued it.
One of Billyâs stock jokes was to refer to it as the âapple of his eye.â

Beneath this special tree were standing four youths of the same type as the
one in the car, while in the tree itself was another. The apples were still
green, of course, but this did not deter the marauders.

They were considerably larger and older than the Rockledge boys, but the
latter were so full of indignation as they ran toward them that they took
little account of size or age.

âWhat are you fellows doing?â cried Bobby, as he came within earshot of the
intruders. âLeave those apples alone.â

The strangers looked up in some surprise at the interruption and then
conferred together hastily.

âWhat have you got to say about it?â blurted out the one who seemed to be the
leader of the party. âThey ainât your apples, are they?â

âNo, but they belong to the head of our school,â replied Bobby. âAnd heâd have
you arrested for stealing them if he knew about it.â

âWell, what he donât know ainât a-goinâ to hurt him,â sneered the fellow. âAnâ
if they ainât your apples you ainât got no license to interfere. You git along
now anâ beat it while the goinâs good.â

âGive him a clip in the jaw, Hen, anâ take some of the freshness out of him,â
growled one of the fruit thieves.

âYou canât bluff us with any of that kind of talk,â declared Bobby stoutly.
âIâve got the number of that car, and you fellows will be tracked down and
arrested if you donât get away from here quick.â

An ugly look came into the bullyâs eyes as he clenched his fist.

And while, with his heart beating fast but his courage unshaken, Bobby waited
for the expected rush, it may be well, for the benefit of those who have not
read the earlier volumes of this series, to tell who Bobby and his chums are.

Bobby Blake was now about thirteen years old, and had been born in a little
town called Clinton. He was the only child of a business man of that place,
whose affairs frequently called him away from home.

Mr. and Mrs. Blake had gone to South America on a protracted trip a few years
before our present story opens, and had been fortunate in finding an excellent
private school for Bobby near home, in the Rockledge School. His first year
there and adventures are related in âBobby Blake at Rockledge School.â

His special friend was Fred Martin, the son of a merchant of Clinton. Fred had
received the nickname of âGingerâ because of his fiery red hair. It is also a
fact that Fred had the hot temper that is popularly supposed to go with hair
of that color. It did not take much to get him angry. Still he was generous
and straight as a string, and he and Bobby got on famously together. Bobby
often had his hands full in getting Fred out of the scrapes into which the
red-headed boyâs quick temper led him, and sometimes he did not succeed. But
the boys formed a perfect team, and where one was the other was quite sure not
to be far away.

They made some good friends at the school and when vacation came they were
invited to visit one of them, Perry Wise, the fat boy called âPee Wee,â at the
home of his parents on the coast. Here the boys had a great time fishing,
boating, and swimming and found themselves with an exciting adventure on their
hands in hunting for a missing boat. These and other adventures of the school
chums are related in other volumes of the âBobby Blake Series.â

And now to return to Bobby where he stood tense and undaunted, awaiting the
onslaught of the bully whom he had discovered with his gang robbing Dr.
Raymondâs orchard.

âSo you got the number of the car, did you?â snarled the leader of the gang,
Hen Lemming. âWell, now let me tell you, bo, that Iâve got your number too,
and itâs number twenty-three. Do you get me? Twenty-three. Thatâs a mighty
unlucky number, too, as youâll find out, for Iâm going to change the map of
that face of yours for buttinâ in.â

As he spoke he made a rush at Bobby with his fist upraised.

Quick as a flash, Bobby grabbed for his legs, as he had often done when
tackling an opponent on a football field. It was a perfect tackle, and the
bully went down with a crash, so hard, indeed, that he lay sprawling on the
ground, stunned for the moment.

In an instant Bobby was on his feet again. âOne of you hold that fellow down!â
he cried, assuming command of the situation. âHere, Pee Wee, you sit on him.â

Pee Wee instantly obeyed, and his ponderous weight settled on Lemmingâs back,
keeping him flat to the ground despite the desperate attempts of the reviving
bully to throw him off.

âNow,â said Bobby, facing the rest of the intruders, who had stood for a
moment paralyzed by the sudden downfall of their leader, âwhoâs the next one
that wants to start something?â

They faced him, growling and storming, but irresolute. The fellow in the tree
had now dropped down and joined his companions.

âWeâre going to smash you for this,â he threatened, as he rolled up his
sleeves.

Fred and the rest of the boys had gathered about Bobby ready to pitch in if
need be, and the hostile groups faced each other frowningly. Fred suddenly set
up a loud whistle, the well-known Rockledge call for aid.

âLook out, Bobby!â suddenly cried Pee Wee.

Bobby wheeled at the cry and saw the driver of the car, who had climbed the
fence and was running to the help of his companions, holding a large stone in
his hand.

He was not more than ten yards away and he raised the stone to hurl it at
Bobbyâs head.

But Bobby was too quick for him. In his pocket was the baseball with which he
and Fred had been practicing. Like lightning he drew it out and threw it at
the driver with all his strength.

The ball caught the fellow right below the breastbone and he doubled up like a
jackknife. The stone dropped from his hand, and he sat down suddenly on the
grass, trying to recover the breath that had been knocked out of him.

âGet the ball, Fred,â commanded Bobby, and like a flash Fred retrieved it and
put it in Bobbyâs hand. Then Fred gave another loud whistle for aid.

âNow,â said Bobby, as he whirled about and faced the group of enemies, who
were fairly gasping with astonishment, âthat takes care of two of you fellows.
Want any more of our game?â

It was very evident that they did not. What they had seen of Bobbyâs quickness
and resource had been quite enough. And that baseball at such close quarters
looked like a mighty powerful weapon. Besides, they could hear the shouts of
other schoolboys not far away. All the easy victory the gang had promised
itself over these younger and slighter opponents vanished like smoke.

There was no answer except mutterings and growls, and the fellow who had
dropped from the tree slowly put on his coat.

âYou boys have got the edge on us just now,â he snarled. âBut donât think for
a minute that youâre through with us. Weâll get you some time, and what weâll
do to you will be a-plenty. Ainât that so, Lemming?â he asked of the fellow
who had been sat upon.

âWeâll take a chance on you,â replied Bobby heatedly.

The toughs started to go away from the tree, but one of them picked up the bag
of apples they had gathered to take along.

âNo, you donât!â exclaimed Bobby. âDrop that.â

The fellow glared at him, but evidently thought it best to obey.

âAinât you going to let him up?â asked one of them, pointing to his prostrate
leader. âGoing to keep him there all night?â

âHeâll get up when you get on the other side of that fence,â replied Bobby.

They picked up the driver on the way and Bobby waited until they had all
climbed into the car.

âNow, Pee Wee,â he said, âlet that fellow up.â

Pee Wee, much gratified at the prominent part his weight had permitted him to
take in the contest, got off his prostrate victim and Lemming struggled to his
feet, his face livid and his whole body shaking with rage at his humiliation
and defeat. For a moment it seemed as if he would rush at Bobby like a mad
bull, but a glance at the faces of the boys and at the baseball that Bobby
held ready for action convinced him for the present that discretion was the
better part of valor.

âYou ainât heard the last of this,â he snapped. âIâll get even with you. And
when I once get hold of you away from your gang Iâll make you wish you had
never been born.â

âYour pals are waiting for you,â was all the response that Bobby vouchsafed,
while he watched his enemy with the eye of a hawk.

With muttered imprecations, Lemming slouched sullenly away and climbed the
fence. Before he got into the car he turned and shook his fist vengefully and
shouted out a torrent of threats. But Bobby simply laughed, and with a honking
of the horn that was in itself a promise of vengeance the car started up and
rolled away.

They watched it until it had passed from sight and then turned and looked at
each other. Other boys now came running up, having heard Fredâs whistle for
help.

âBobby, youâre a trump,â cried Fred, in admiration as he clapped his friend on
the shoulder.

All crowded round their leader and showered him with praise until Bobby
blushed to the ears.

âLay off, you fellows,â he cried in some confusion. âThe chance simply came my
way and I took it. It simply shows that football and baseball tactics are good
for something besides games.â

âI thought sure it was coming to a regular fist fight and I was bracing myself
for it,â put in Skeets. âBut, thanks to Bobby, none of us got a scratch.â

âTheyâd have had a good chance of getting away with it, too,â affirmed Billy.
âThey were big husky fellows, almost men, and theyâd probably have been too
heavy for our bunch. It simply shows that brains and muscle combined are a
good sight better than muscle alone.â

âWeight isnât such a bad thing either,â remarked Pee Wee.

âRight you are, old boy,â laughed Fred. âIt would have taken three of us to
hold that fellow down as well as you did. You sure did yourself proud.â

âIâd hate to be the driver of that car,â grinned Skeets. âYou doubled him up
good and plenty, Bobby. He went down as though he had been shot.â

âOne strike and out,â laughed Fred. âBobbyâs eyesight was good. He put the
ball right over the plate.â

There was more excited talk, then one of the boys who had come running to help
their comrades but who had arrived too late said to those who had come with
him:

âWell, come on, fellows. Letâs go about our business. This bunch is all right
now.â With these words he turned and went off, his especial friends going with
him.

CHAPTER III

A MODEST HERO

âYouâve got to look out for those fellows, especially for that Lemming,
Bobby,â warned Mouser. âThose eyes of his were like a rattlesnakeâs when he
got up from the ground. You humbled him before his gang and made him look like
thirty cents, and he isnât likely to forget it.â

âOh, Iâm not worrying much about him,â returned Bobby carelessly. âHe probably
got enough to last him for a while. Then, too, he knows that we have the
number of his car and could get the police after him if we wanted to.â

âI donât know but what we ought to do that anyway,â suggested Shiner. âItâs a
tough gang and perhaps itâs already done something that the police are
interested in finding out about.â

âI guess weâd better let well enough alone,â replied Bobby. âBesides, I doubt
whether the doctor would care to have the school mixed up in the matter. But
now letâs get along after those doughnuts of Pee Wee. If we wait till
to-morrow heâll have spent the money, and this scrap has given me an
appetite.â

âWhat are we going to do with these apples?â asked Fred. âThereâs quite a
bunch of them in this bag.â

âWeâll drop in at the Hall and leave them with the housekeeper,â
Bobby decided.

âDonât you think the doctor himself ought to be told about these fellows so
that he can keep a closer watch on the orchard?â asked Skeets.

âI suppose he ought,â agreed Bobby. âBut I hate to speak to him about it for
fear heâll think weâre looking for praise for getting rid of the rascals. But
come along anyway, and weâll get these apples off our hands.â

As luck would have it, their modesty was not to be spared, for as they went
through the front door of the school the first person they encountered was Dr.
Raymond himself, who was emerging from one of the classrooms.

The doctor was a tall spare man with an intellectual, finely cut face and a
pair of eyes that could look right through one if he were guilty of any
violation of rules but that more frequently had a twinkle in them that bespoke
a kindly nature and the possession of a sense of humor. He was a strict
disciplinarian and an excellent administrator, and had raised the school to a
position of such high repute that he had been forced to establish a waiting
list. Although the boys knew that he was not to be trifled with, they liked
him because he was uniformly just and fair in his dealings with them.

He glanced at them with an expression of some surprise as he noted the bag of
apples that Fred carried in his hand.

âTheyâre apples from your thousand-dollar tree,â volunteered Fred,
forestalling the question that he saw in the doctorâs eyes.

âWhat!â exclaimed Dr. Raymond with a start, as a look of sternness began to
steal over his features.

For that tree was his special pride, and he valued it almost as much as the
rest of his orchard put together.

âWe werenât the ones that picked the apples,â broke in Mouser. âWe found a
gang of thieves down there helping themselves and we drove them off. Bobby did
the most of it, though. He sure can think quickly.â

âCome in here and tell me all about it,â directed the doctor, leading the way
into the room from which he had just come.

âNow, Blake,â he said after they were seated, âfrom what Pryde said, I fancy
you are the one to tell me the story.â

Bobby fidgeted a little uncomfortably. It was hard to tell the facts without
dwelling on the part he had played in it, and he hated to find himself in the
limelight.

âWhy, Doctor Raymond,â he said, âthere isnât much to tell. We were walking
down the lane when we saw an auto drawn up at the side of the road and then we
saw five fellows gathering apples from that tree. We knew how much you thought
of it, so we went into the orchard and made them go away.â

âWere they boys about your own size?â asked the doctor. âAnybody you know
about here or in the town?â

âNo, sir,â replied Bobby. âThey were big fellows, almost men. None of us ever
saw them before. They had a big car and they probably came from a distance.â

âHow did you get them to stop?â asked the doctor, with some interest.
âPersuade them?â

âWell, no, sir,â answered Bobby slowly. âYou couldnât exactly say that we
persuaded them. Weâwe had to use a little force.â

The doctorâs keen eyes twinkled.

âThis grows interesting,â he remarked. âI am really curious to know what kind
of force you boys used to drive away nearly half a dozen robbers who were
almost the size of men.â

âIf you please, doctor,â ventured Fred, who had been growing restive at what
he regarded as the undue modesty of his chum, âany of the other boys can tell
you about it better than Bobby, because heâs the one that about did the whole
thing and he doesnât like to say so.â

Bobby blushed and the doctor laughed.

âI suspected as much,â he said. âWell, then, Martin, suppose you go ahead and
tell me all the facts.â

âWell, sir,â replied Fred, âwe saw the fellows robbing the tree and we climbed
over the fence and went over to them and Bobby told them to stop. The man who
seemed to be the leader made a rush, and Bobby dived for his legs and tumbled
him to the ground. Then Bobby told Pee WeeâI mean Wiseâto sit on him and hold
him down and Pee WeeâI mean Wiseâdid it. Then the man who had been driving the
auto came for Bobby with a rock in his hand, and Bobby took the baseball weâd
been practicing with out of his pocket and let him have it right in the bread
basketâI mean in the stomachâand the man went down. Then Bobby got back the
ball and told the other four to beat itâI mean told them to go awayâor heâd
soakâI mean hitâthem in the same way. They saw that their goose was cookedâI
mean they saw it was no useâand they flew the coopâI mean they went away. But
they shook their fists and told Bobby a whole lot of things they were going to
do to him if they ever got hold of him.â

The doctor sat back in his chair and laughed heartily.

âWell, well,â he remarked, while Bobby got red to his ears, âthatâs the best
story Iâve heard for many a long day. And it seems to have Bobby scattered all
through it.â

âI guess those toughs heard some of the other fellows coming to our help,
doctor,â interposed Bobby. âThey did come, you know, but they got there too
lateâthe fruit thieves had gone away by that time.â

âBut really, Blake, even at that, you did wonderfully well, both in quick
thinking and effective acting,â replied Dr. Raymond. âYou are an honor to the
school and Iâm proud of you. And I want to thank all you boys, for I know that
you were standing loyally by, ready to back Blake up if the necessity arose.
But Iâm glad that the matter was settled the way it was, for otherwise some of
you might have been injured in a row with those who were so much bigger and
older than yourselves. For the future I will keep a closer watch upon the
orchard, though I donât imagine,â he added with a smile, âthat that particular
gang will be eager to try again at the same place where they met with such a
reception.â

âBobby took the number of their car so that you could follow the matter up if
you wanted to,â said Fred.

âStill, Bobby,â smiled the doctor, âtrust him not to overlook anything. But I
hardly think that I care to press the matter any further. I guess the rascals
have been punished enough. Still, Iâll note down the number just as a matter
of precaution in case they should try to carry out their threats of getting
even. Thatâs hardly likely, but itâs possible. By the way, Blake, Iâd be
especially careful for a while, and if you see any of the gang hanging around
be sure and let me know.â

He jotted down the license number and then, with repeated thanks, dismissed
the boys, while he himself sought out Mr. Leith and Mr. Carrier, to whom with
many chuckles he narrated the events of the afternoon. Even the stately Mr.
Leith unbent, while Mr. Carrier was frankly delighted.

Martin was at that very moment chiding Bobby for having hung back and left it
to his friends to tell of his exploits.

âWhy didnât you speak up for yourself, Bobby?â he asked, âinstead of leaving
it to me to give the doctor an earfulâthere I go againâinstead of leaving it
to me to tell the doctor all about it. Any one would think that you were
ashamed instead of being proud of what youâve done.â

âOh, it wasnât so much,â deprecated Bobby. âJust a tackle and a baseball
throw. Any one could have done it.â

âGreat Scott!â snorted Shiner, as he glanced at his watch. âItâs too late now
for us to get down to the bakerâs for those doughnuts and get back in time for
supper.â

There was a chorus of groans from all but Pee Wee, who looked somewhat
relieved.

âWeâll have to put it off till some other time,â he remarked. âThat stone
bruise of mine is hurting me anyway, and then, too, Iâve been working pretty
hard this afternoon. Holding that bully down was no cinch.â

âOh, I donât know,â said Skeets unbelievingly. âAll you had to do was to sit
still, and thatâs the easiest thing you do. He couldnât move any more than if
heâd had one of the Pyramids resting on him.â

Pee Wee treated this slighting reference to his really great achievements with
the silent scorn it deserved.

âOh, well,â observed Sparrow, âthe doughnuts will keep till some other time.â

âBut when that time comes will Pee Wee have the dime?â questioned Shiner
incredulously.

âI will,â pledged Pee Wee. And then rising to unusual heights he added: âI
promised you fellows two doughnuts to divide among you. Iâll double that. Iâll
make it four.â

CHAPTER IV

WHIZZING IT OVER

The last weeks previous to the beginning of the summer vacation were busy ones
for the boys. They had to prepare for final examinations, and for those who
had shirked their work through the term this was a period of grief and
lamentation.

Bobby and Fred had done good work in their studies right along, and the coming
tests had no terrors for them.

But there was another interest that held the attention of the boys to a degree
greater, it is to be feared, than their studies.

The baseball fight that season between the teams composing the Monatook Lake
League had been fiercer than ever before. All of the teams were comparatively
strong, considering the age of the players, and the contests had been close
and exciting. But in the end it had narrowed down to a contest between
Rockledge and Belden, each of which had won and lost the same number of games.
The crucial game was to be played by these two hot rivals on the Belden
grounds, and feeling was at fever heat in each school.

While in fielding ability there was very little to choose between them, it was
generally admitted that Belden had the âedgeâ on Rockledge in the matter of
batting. This had been shown by the scores of the games that had already been
played. The Belden tallies were much in excess of those rolled up by the
Rockledge boys, and the former had a formidable list of three-baggers and
homers. The Rockledge victories on the other hand were marked by small scores,
and had mostly been won by the good pitching of Bobby in the box.

So the forthcoming contest had resolved itself in the minds of the boys into a
struggle between heavy batting and good pitching. Which of the two would
prevail?

The Belden boys thought that they could give the answer. They had never before
felt so confident, and they were jubilant at the fine showing made by their
team with the bat. It was freely predicted that Bobby would be sent to the
bench before the game was half over. And with him out of the game, the Belden
boys felt that they could simply romp in, for Howell Purdy, the other
Rockledge pitcher, while fairly good, was admittedly not in the same class as
Bobby.

But on the other hand, the Rockledge boys had seen Bobby too often âcome
throughâ to feel depressed at the prospect. They knew that he would have to
face a fiercer attack than usual.

âBut,â said Fred, âwe are sure that before long Bobby will have those
redoubtable sluggers eating out of his hand. The bigger they are the harder
they fall.â And this fairly expressed the feeling prevalent among his mates.

Bobby himself said little, but worked away like a beaver to perfect his curves
and slants and develop his speed. He had never felt in better trim, and in his
secret heart had little doubt that he would pull out the victory. But he
refrained from predictions, and to the questions that were showered upon him
by his comrades merely replied that he was going to do his best.

The great day came at last and was marked by brilliant sunshine. This was a
slight disadvantage for Bobby, because a cloudy day is reckoned as an asset to
a pitcher, as it makes it harder for the batsman to gauge the ball. Of course
this affected the Belden pitcher, too, but not to such an extent, as the
Belden boys were not placing as much reliance on the pitching as Rockledge was
forced to do.

The fact, too, that the game was to be played on the Belden grounds was, of
course, an advantage to that school. The grounds themselves were more familiar
to their nine, and they would have the greater number of rooters to cheer on
the home team and rattle their opponents.

Still it was all in the game, and the Rockledge boys were in high spirits as
they cavorted around the diamond in practice.

The stands were full of interested spectators and there was a great wall of
âfansâ surrounding the playing field. The Rockledge boys had come over in a
body to encourage their team. Dr. Raymond himself had a foremost seat in the
grandstand as a guest of the head of Belden school. The two men were the best
of friends and laughed and chaffed each other on the merits of the respective
teams.

Both nines showed up well in practice, making stops and throws and catches
which showed that each team was at the top of its form. It was evident that
the game was to be a hotly contested one, and when the bell rang the
spectators settled down in their seats with the anticipation of a treat.

Rockledge, as the visiting team, was first at bat. The first man up went out
on strikes and a chorus of cheers arose from the partisans of Belden. Fred,
who came next, whipped a sharp liner to left. If it had been smartly fielded,
it would have gone for a single, but the left fielder fumbled it for a moment
and Fred by great running reached second. Then it was the turn of Rockledge to
cheer. The hit availed nothing, however, for Barry went out on a pop fly to
the pitcher and Sparrow sent a towering fly to right which was gathered in
after a long run. The inning had ended without a score, and Belden came in for
its half.

That proved short and sweet. Bobby whiffed the first batter that faced him on
three successive strikes. The second man dribbled an easy one to the box that
Bobby had no trouble in getting to first in plenty of time. The next batsman
fouled off two in succession, and then Bobby struck him out with a fast high
one that cut the center of the plate. No one had got to first, and the
Rockledge rooters cheered Bobby lustily as he came in to the bench.

They felt still better when Mouser caught the ball on the end of his bat for a
ripping three-bagger to center. The cheers turned to groans, however, when
Mouser took a chance and tried to steal home. It was a rash play at that stage
of the game, for no one was out, and even a sacrifice would probably have
brought him home. As it was, the ball was waiting for him when he slid into
the plate and he looked rather sheepish as he rose and brushed the dust from
his uniform. Sheets laid down a clever bunt, on which by good running he
reached first. Shiner followed with a daisy cutter between first and second
that carried Sheets to third, though Shiner himself could get no further than
the initial bag. The inning ended when Billy Bassett hit into a double play.

âThat was an awful bonehead play of mine,â said Mouser regretfully, as he and
Bobby walked out from the bench to take their places in the field.

âDonât let it worry you, Mouser,â Bobby consoled him. âThat was a whale of a
three-bagger that you knocked out, anyway. Any one of us is liable to make a
mistake.â

The second inning resulted in another blank for Belden. The first one up went
out by the strikeout route. The next one proved a little more difficult, for
he refused to bite at the balls that Bobby put over until the count stood at
three balls and no strikes.

âWait him out,â shouted Ormsby, the Belden captain. âHeâs getting wild.â

The next ball split the plate for a perfect strike, but the batsman, obeying
his captainâs command, let it go by. He refused to offer also at the next one,
which also went for a strike. The count now stood three-two, and if Bobby was
in a hole the batter was also.

Cool as an icicle, Bobby wound up and put all he had on a high fast one that
fairly smoked as it went over the plate. The batter made a wild lunge at it
but missed, and the ball sank with a thud in the catcherâs glove.

âYouâre out,â called the umpire.

âThatâs going some, Bobby,â cried Fred from short. âKeep it right up. They
canât hit you.â

This was a little premature, for the next man connected with the first ball
pitched and sent it whistling over Bobbyâs head. It had all the earmarks of a
single, but Mouser redeemed his previous error of judgment by leaping into the
air and making a superb catch that brought the crowd in the stands to their
feet. The Rockledge rooters were jubilant, while the Beldenites were
correspondingly depressed.

The next two innings passed without a score for either side. Both pitchers
were doing excellent work, and while the Belden boxman, Erlich, was hit rather
freely, the ball seemed to find a fielder in the way every time. Twice the
Rockledge boys had men on bases, once by an error and the other time from a
passed ball, but were unable to bring them around.

In the fifth inning, Rockledge broke the ice. Skeets led off with a rattling
single to right. Shiner sacrificed him neatly to second. Billy sent a hot one
between short and third that looked as though it would be good enough to bring
Skeets home, but the ball was retrieved so smartly and thrown into home by the
Belden left fielder that Skeets, who had rounded third and started on his
homeward journey, saw that he could not make it, and had all he could do to
scramble back to third. In the meantime Billy had reached second.

With one man out, Bobby came to the bat. The first was too high and he let it
go by. The second was waist high and right in the groove, and Bobby swung at
it with all his might. There was a sharp crack as the bat met the ball, and
then the latter sped out almost in a line between right and center. Bobby
dropped his bat and was off like a flash, while Skeets and Billy came
galloping home.

As Bobby rounded first, he saw that the right and center fielders were still
chasing the ball. By the time he had reached second the right fielder had
picked it up and was steadying himself for the throw to third. The chances of
the ball and batter getting there at the same time were about even. But two
runs were in anyway, and Bobby knew that he could afford to take the chance.
He put on extra speed and slid into the bag just a fraction of a second before
the third baseman clapped the ball on him.

âSafe!â cried the umpire, and the Rockledge crowd went wild.

Erlich stiffened up then and let the next batsman down on strikes. Spentz, who
came next, hit the ball hard, but it was gobbled up by the center fielder, and
the inning was over with Bobby left on third.

But at any rate two runs had tallied, and the way the game
was going those two runs seemed big enough to win.

CHAPTER V

THE WINNING HIT

The Belden boys came in for their half, fuming at the lead that
Rockledge had gained but not a bit discouraged. Ormsby gathered them about him
and urged them on, and their rooters broke out into vociferous
cheers.

Weston, one of their heaviest batters and the head of their
batting order, came to the plate swinging his bat in a menacing way. He glared
at Bobby, who only laughed and sent over a fadeaway for the first strike.

The second ball was a hop and Weston caught it on the under side and sent it
high in the air out toward center. It should have been an easy catch, for
Devlin had plenty of time to get under it before it came down. But it was the
very ease of the catch that was his undoing, for he let it go through his
fingers.

Weston, like the good ballplayer that he was, had kept on running at full
speed, even though he expected the ball to be caught, so that by the time the
muff was actually made he had rounded first and was well on his way to second.

Devlin was rattled by his error and threw wild to the second bag. The ball
went over Mouserâs head, and by the time it was retrieved Weston was roosting
safely on third amid the jubilant yells of the Belden partisans.

Romney, the next one up, laid down what was intended to be a sacrifice bunt
between short and third. Fred and Sparrow both went for it with such eagerness
that they collided and were knocked head over heels. By the time Bobby had run
over and recovered the ball Weston had easily made the plate and Romney had
got to second.

These two âflivversâ in succession were likely to rattle any team, and in
order to give his mates time to recover their self-possession, Bobby bent down
and fumbled with his shoe laces until the umpire ordered him to play ball.

Then Bobby put on steam and fanned the next batter in three straight strikes.

He made the next one knock an easy bounder toward short. Fred was all set to
grab it when the ball struck a stone and took a high bound over his head,
rolling out to left field, while Romney made the dust fly as he legged his way
to third and the batter reached first.

Howell Purdy, the substitute pitcher, who was
playing left field, ran in for the ball. He saw that he could not get Romney
at third, and threw to Mouser at second to catch the batter, who was making
for that bag. But the ball was ten feet wide of the base and went into the
field, while both Romney and his mate scored, making the score 3 to 2 in
Beldenâs favor.

The Belden boys fairly went crazy. There was a din of horn-blowing and
catcalls exceeding anything so far in the game. Their coachers got out on the
coaching lines and began a line of chatter designed to rattle their opponents
still further.

But no matter how the rest of the team were shaken, Bobby absolutely declined
to lose his nerve. He knew that until this inning was over at any rate the
only thing left for him was to strike his opponents out. Any ball hit, no
matter how easily it ought to be fielded, was liable to be fumbled or booted.
So he summoned up all his courage and skill and made the next two fan in
succession.

Many a pitcher would have been grumpy and sore at such support. He had not
yielded a single hit or passed a man to first, and yet his opponents had made
three runs and taken the lead. Yet Bobbyâs face was as serene as a summer sky
when he drew off his glove and went in to the bench.

Devlin and Howell were bitterly angry at themselves because of their errors,
and Fred and Sparrow were limping from the effects of their collision, while
the rest of the team were more or less upset by the sudden change in affairs.

âNever mind, fellows,â cried Bobby encouragingly. âThose fellows have
certainly had the breaks of the game so far. That collision was an accident
and we didnât know that that stone in the infield would give that bad bound to
the ball. But those things generally even up, and they may have their turn of
bad luck next. Anyway, theyâre only one run ahead and we have time to overcome
that. Just letâs brace and weâll beat them yet.â

But if they were to beat them it was not to be done in the sixth or seventh
inning, for those chances passed without Rockledge scoring. Once they got a
man as far as third, but there he stayed for want of the necessary hit to
bring him in.

Belden was equally unable to score. Bobby was pitching like a demon and his
opponents were swinging at the air. Four out of the six who faced him in those
two innings went out on strikes, while a foul and a pop fly disposed of the
others.

In the eighth inning the skies began to brighten for Rockledge. Erlich, who
had pitched good ball up to that time, began to weaken. His fast ones no
longer had their usual zip to them, nor were his curves so deceptive. Two hits
in succession, followed by a base on balls, filled the bases, and then a wild
pitch by Erlich permitted the man on third to score, thus making the game a
tie. Belden braced then, and aided by a snappy double play prevented further
scoring.

Try as they would, however, they could make no impression on Bobbyâs pitching
in their half, and the ninth inning opened with the score still a tie.

âNow for a grand rally, fellows,â urged Bobby. âWeâve got Erlich going. Keep
up the good work of the last inning and the pennant is ours.â

âWeâll do it,â declared Fred. âHeâs got nothing on the ball now but a prayer
and a glove. Letâs go in and knock him out of the box.â

They started in as though they were going to do it. Sheets poled out a
stinging single to right. Shiner followed with a screamer over shortstopâs
head that carried Skeets to third while he himself pulled up at second. A
shout went up when Billy met the ball full on the seam, but it died away in a
groan when the second baseman made a splendid catch of the liner and returned
it in time to double up Skeets as he slid into the plate.

Tumultuous cheers greeted Bobby, as he came to the bat.

âWin your own game, Bobby,â sang out Pee Wee, who had abandoned his usual
laziness and all through the game had been rooting like a madman.

âGive the ball a ride!â

âKill it!â

âHit it a mile!â

âShow them where you live!â

Erlich looked him over carefully and then tempted him with an out drop. Bobby
refused to bite.

The next came straight for his head and would have knocked him out had not
Bobby dropped to the ground like a flash.

âHeâs trying to bean him,â came in angry shouts from the Rockledge part of the
stand.

Erlich, however, who, to do him justice, had no such intention, offered an
apology which Bobby accepted without question, as he dug his toes into the
ground and waited for the next offering.

It came in the form of a wide outcurve which failed to cut the plate and went
for a ball.

Bobby now was on âeasy street,â for there were three balls and no strikes, and
his opponent had to put them over.

The next ball was to Bobbyâs liking, half way between the knee and waist. He
swung at it, caught it full and fair, and the ball started off toward right.

Down to first Bobby ran with the speed of a frightened jack-rabbit. He had
rounded the bag before he dared to look for the ball. There it was, soaring
along like a bird, while both the right and center fielders had turned their
backs and were racing after it. He knew it was a sure three-bagger. Could he
stretch it into a homer?

He rounded second and kept on toward third. How he ran! The wind whistled in
his ears. The stands were a blur of shouting figures who had risen to their
feet and were yelling like maniacs.

He touched third and saw out of the corner of his eye that the right fielder
had got the ball and was steadying himself for the throw. It was to be a race
between him and the ball. Then he straightened himself out for home, and now
indeed his feet had wings.

On and on he went like an arrow. But the ball was coming, too. He knew it by
the way the catcher threw aside his mask and settled himself for the catch. He
knew it by the frantic yells of his comrades urging him on.

Twenty feet from the bag he launched himself into the air and slid into the
plate in a cloud of dust. At the same instant he heard the thud of the ball in
the catcherâs glove. But the ball was a fraction of a second too late.

âSafe!â cried the umpire, and Bobby rose to his feet, panting but smiling, to
have what little breath was left knocked out of him by the hugging and mauling
of his exulting mates.

Shiner had preceded him to the plate. The next batter struck out, and the
score was now 5 to 3 in favor of Rockledge.

And there it remained, for Bobby simply refused to be cheated out of the
victory and fanned the Belden boys in a row as fast as they came to the plate.

Then when the last batsman had thrown down the stick in disgust, the rejoicing
Rockledge crowds surged down over the field and despite Bobbyâs laughing
protestations hoisted him on their shoulders and carried him about the field,
dancing and yelling until their throats were hoarse.

âYou were the whole cheese, Bobby,â declared Fred with his usual lack of
elegance of speech.

âYou had the Indian sign on them,â chortled Pee Wee.

âYou tamed them good and proper,â jubilated Mouser.

âWhere, oh, where is Belden now?â chanted Billy.

âDonât forget that they played a good game,â put in Bobby generously.

âSure they did,â agreed Pee Wee. âBut we played a better.â

Dr. Raymond, who was feeling almost as delighted as the boys themselves,
congratulated the team heartily, reserving especially warm praise for Bobby.

Mr. Carrier, too, took both of Bobbyâs hands in his.

âYou played wonderful ball to-day, Blake,â he said. âIt was the hardest fight
weâve had yet, but you came through it nobly. You kept your nerve in
situations that would have tested a veteran, and weâre all proud of you.â

âIâm afraid you make too much of it, Mr. Carrier,â replied Bobby. âThe main
thing is that the pennant is safe for another year at Rockledge School.â

CHAPTER VI

CIRCUS THRILLS

There was a great celebration on the Rockledge campus that night in honor of
the victory. Rules were relaxed and the boys were allowed to do just about as
they chose. A great heap of boxes and barrels had been piled up to a height of
a dozen feet or more, saturated with oil and set on fire, while the jubilant
Rockledge boys did a snake dance around the blazing pile. Even Pee Wee danced,
and when that animated mountain so far forgot his natural laziness as to
indulge in dancing it was positive proof that the occasion was worth it.

Bobby had been accorded the honor of setting the torch to the pile in
recognition of the part he had played in the winning of the pennant, but when
in addition he was called on for a speech he, blushing furiously, took refuge
behind his comrades, and Billy, who had no scruples against being in the
limelight, took his place and regaled the crowd with some of his choicest
jokes.

It was late when the flames at last died down and the tired but happy boys
agreed to call it a day and sought the beds that beckoned them.

The baseball game had practically marked the ending of the school term,
though one or two of the final examinations still remained. These, however,
had no terror for Bobby and Fred, who came through them with flying colors.
Then nothing remained but to pack up and make ready for home and the long
glorious summer vacation to which they had been looking forward for so long.

It was a hilarious crowd that finally bade farewell to Rockledge School.
Skeets, Shiner, Mouser and Billy were to accompany Bobby and Fred for a part
of the way, though the first two were to separate from their comrades at a
junction a little way down the line.

If a dark shadow, dangerous and menacing, was hanging over some of the party,
they were blissfully unconscious of it. Life ran strong in their veins and the
future seemed to be made up of sunshine and roses. They laughed, wrestled and
frolicked, as full of vim and spirit as so many young colts turned out to
pasture.

Almost before they knew it, the junction was reached and they got off on the
platform. The train that Skeets and Shiner were to take was already waiting,
and they had barely time to scramble aboard with shouted farewells to their
comrades.

When Fred and Bobby consulted the station agent they learned that there had
been a change in the schedule and that the train they had expected to take had
left an hour before. There would not be another one on that branch until
nearly dark. This was somewhat disconcerting, as they had counted on being
home in time for supper and now found themselves faced by the prospect of
having to spend the long summer afternoon at this forlorn little junction,
where there was absolutely nothing that promised amusement.

As they came out of the station to impart this information to their friends,
they found Mouser and Billy standing spellbound before some gorgeous circus
posters that had been plastered on the side of an old barn at the far end of
the platform.

There was the usual âunparalleled aggregation of matchless, magnificent
marvels, gathered together at vast expense from all quarters of the habitable
globe,â the wonderful trapezists and acrobats in their âstupendous,
death-defying leaps,â the âpeerless queen of bareback riders on her milk-white
Arabian steed,â the glorious procession of daring knights and fair ladies in
the tournament of love and beauty and all the other features that maintain
their thrall and witchery for the young.

Though duly impressed by these spectacular features, the boys had seen similar
ones before. What especially fastened their attention was the picture of an
Eskimo chief with his trained walrus. This was a novelty, and as such had a
special and instant appeal.

âGee!â said Billy wistfully, âhow I wish we could see them. This is the same
circus I was telling you fellows about a few days ago.â

âWhere is it showing?â asked Bobby, as a thought struck him.

âBayport,â replied Fred, reading from the bottom of the poster. âTheyâre to be
in that town to-day. Where is Bayport?â

Bobby rushed into the station.

âCan you tell me where Bayport is?â he asked the station agent.

âSure,â replied the latter. âItâs about fifteen miles from here on a branch
line. Want to go there? A train will be along in about fifteen minutes.â

âIf we go there, can we get back this afternoon in time for the Clinton
train?â Bobby inquired.

âThat depends on how long you want to stay there,â the agent answered.
âThereâs a train leaves there about five that would bring you back here in
plenty of time.â

Bobby thought for a moment. The circus performance began at two. It would
probably be over by half past four. That would give them plenty of time to
catch the five oâclock train back.

He ran out to his friends.

âSay, fellows,â he shouted, âwhat do you say to taking in the circus? Iâve
just found out that we can go there and get back in time for our train.â

What did they say? They fairly jumped at the proposal.

In a few minutes the train came along, and after having left their suitcases
in the charge of the good-hearted station agent they piled on board,
helter-skelter, and were off.

It took only about half an hour to reach their destination. They were
surprised to find that Bayport was a large shipping town. A multitude of
vessels of all sizes and descriptions were in the harbor, and the wharfs were
piled high with merchandise. It was a scene of busy life and bustle, and the
boys would have lingered to watch it had it not been for the much greater
fascination of the circus. Two oâclock was fast approaching, and they hurried
along so as to be in time for good seats. Besides, they wanted to take in some
of the side shows if possible before the main performance began.

They heard the music of the band before they came in sight of the grounds, and
it still further stimulated their eagerness.

They turned a corner and there before them were the white circus tents with a
crowd already wandering about the grounds, the sideshows with the bearded
lady, the snake-charmer, the ossified man, the human-pincushion, the fat
woman, the midgets, the strong man and other freaks, the array of elephants
trumpeting and tossing their trunks, the small boys carrying water for the
animals and thus earning free admission to the show, the peanut and lemonade
booths, all pervaded by the unforgettable, pungent smell inseparable from the
city of tents.

They were walking about and taking in all the sights with the keenest interest
when Bobby put his hand suddenly on Fredâs arm.

âLook at those two fellows over there,â he cried, indicating a spot near the
ticket takerâs wagon.

Fred looked in that direction, but the crowd was constantly changing and he
saw nothing that explained Bobbyâs exclamation.

âWhat is it?â he asked in wonderment.

âI thought I saw a couple of the bullies that we drove away from Dr. Raymondâs
apple tree,â replied Bobby, straining his eyes as he searched the crowd.

âIt might have been only a resemblance,â suggested Fred.

âPerhaps,â said Bobby dubiously. âBut I was certain that one of them was that
Lemming, the leader of the gang. And the other looked like the fellow that I
doubled up with the baseball.â

âWell, even if it was, that wouldnât be so surprisingâ rejoined Fred. âThis
circus is drawing people from towns for many miles around and those fellows
are as likely to come as any one else. Do you think they saw you?â

âThey werenât looking our way when I caught sight of them,â answered Bobby.
âAs you say, it might have been only a resemblance. And, anyway, they couldnât
put anything over on us in such a crowd as this.â

And in the multitude of things to see and hear the incident passed entirely
out of his mind.

âI say, fellows,â exclaimed Billy, âIâll bet that fellow standing over there
is the Eskimo chief, the one they call Takyak on the circus poster. He looks
just like the pictures of the Eskimos Iâve seen.â

The man in question was a stocky Eskimo with the broad flat features that
proclaimed his race. He was standing rather moodily in the shadow of one of
the tents with a distant look in his eyes as though his thoughts were far
away.

He glanced carelessly at the boys as they drew near him, and then something
about them seemed to awaken his liking, for his face took on a friendly smile.

They smiled in answer, and in response to a question that Bobby rather timidly
addressed to him he surprised them by answering in English. It was broken and
imperfect but easily understandable. They learned afterward that he had picked
it up from the traders who came to his country for seals and fur, and of
course his trip with the circus had added considerably to his knowledge of the
language.

The boysâ evident interest seemed to please him and he unbent a good deal from
the habitual reticence common with his people. They learned from him that he
was homesick and longing to be back in his native land.

âToo hot here,â he told them among other things. âWant snow. Plenty ice up
Baffin Land. Ice houses. Everything ice. That good for Eskimo.â

âIce and snow,â murmured Fred. âI wonderââ

âLook out!â suddenly yelled Bobby. And then he made a quick move toward the
Eskimo and pushed him back.

Bobby had seen a tent pole swaying. Some guy ropes had broken and the big pole
was coming down directly where the Eskimo stood. It struck the ground with a
thud, missing Chief Takyak by a few inches.

âGreat Caesar!â cried Billy. âLook at that, will you!â

âA close call for Takyak,â remarked Fred.

Some circus men came running forward, to ascertain if anybody had been hurt,
and to hoist the pole into place again. The Eskimo chief was startled but
speedily regained his composure.

âBoy push me just in time,â he said, with a queer little smile. âNo push out
of way, big pole maybe kill old Takyak.â

âIâm glad I saw it coming,â answered Bobby. He was a good deal upset
himselfâindeed they all were. They moved to another spot and the old Eskimo
put his hand on Bobbyâs shoulder.

âTakyak thank you,â he said simply, and his manner showed that he was deeply
grateful.

âOh, thatâs all right,â answered Bobby, not knowing what else to say.

Now the boys felt better acquainted with the old chief and began to ask him a
number of questions.

When they asked him why he stayed in this country if he wanted so much to go
back to his own his brow clouded.

âMust stay,â he said. âCircus man give me moneyâmake contract. He tell me no
go home. But I no want money. Heaps of money up Northâyellow moneyâgold. Old
ship there. Men drown. Plenty mâââ

But here he seemed to think he was talking too much and drew back into his shell.

âMust go now,â he muttered, and vanished behind the curtain of the tent.

The boys gazed after the Eskimo in wonder.

âGee, did you hear what he said?â declared Fred. âHeaps of money up North.
What did he mean?â

âI give up,â answered Bobby. âBut come on. We came here to see the show.â

CHAPTER VII

A SUDDEN SHOCK

The billboards advertising this particular circus had not been of a very
modest or retiring description, but for once the show almost came up to the
lurid praises sung so enthusiastically by the press agent.

There was not such a wide variety of acts as the biggest circuses present, but
all the acts there were seemed to be of the best quality. The acrobats
performed marvelously on their dizzy, swinging trapezes, the clowns evoked the
usual laughter, and the trained animal acts were good. Among the cleverest of
these was the act of the old Eskimo with his trained walrus. This animal
seemed gifted with almost human intelligence. It balanced itself on rolling
barrels, juggled canes, and went through the whole performance as though it
thoroughly enjoyed the doing of it, which it probably did. After each
successful trick the old Eskimo would throw the walrus a small fish, which it
would catch in mid-air and swallow in one gulp, and then go on to the next act
with renewed enthusiasm.

When the act was over the audience applauded vigorously as the walrus flopped
in its clumsy way back into its cage.

âGee,â laughed Bobby, âone of those fellows would make a fine pet, if only he
were a little more lively on his feet. Iâll bet you could teach him to do
almost anything.â

âHe seems to have a lot more brains than some people I know,â observed Billy
Bassett. âIâm not naming any names, of course, but if that remark happens to
apply to any of you fellows, I canât help that.â

âWell, itâs pretty certain that walrus never tried to make up a joke in his
life, and that proves that heâs got more sense than you,â retorted Bobby.

âThatâs a true word, Bobby,â observed Fred, grinning, while Billy cast
desperately about for a suitable retort. âGive me a walrus rather than a
jokesmith any day in the year.â

âYes, the walrus seems so intelligent,â said Bobby wickedly.

âSay, lay off, you fellows,â said Billy. âI was just thinking up a fine joke
about a walrus when you started in with that nonsense and drove it out of my
head.â

âAnd a good thing we did,â said Fred. âEvery joke you forget is just that much
gained for us. But now keep quiet and look at the show. Those clowns are
working off some jokes that are the real thing, not mere amateur attempts.â

âAw, I could think up better ones any day,â scoffed Billy. âThose fellows are
nothing wonderful.â

âYes, Iâll bet youâd make a first-class clown,â conceded Fred, with a wink at
Bobby. âYou seem to be specially fitted for that job, some way.â

âJust wait until we get outside,â threatened Billy. âIâll bribe the keeper to
feed you to the lions, see if I donât.â

âHuh! Lions donât bother me,â boasted Fred. âIf they put me in the same cage
with the lions, youâd see a wild mix-up for a few minutes, and then the poor
beasts would come shooting out through the bars looking for some place of
safety. Thereâs nothing I like better than throwing lions around.â

âIt isnât right to treat the poor animals that way,â said Bobby, pretending to
take his friend seriously. âItâs much better to treat them kindlyâpat them on
the head and speak soothing words to them. Thatâs the way I do when Iâm
training wild tigers just out of the jungle.â

âHumph!â snorted Fred, with pretended contempt, and there the matter dropped.

All followed intently the further progress of the performance. At the last
came the exciting chariot race, and the show was over.

The boys filed out with the crowd, and made the round of the stands and booths
that were scattered about the circus lot. Pink lemonade and hot peanuts were
to be had in riotous abundance, and they indulged in both these luxuries.
Billy suggested that now would be a good time for his friends to exhibit their
prowess with the lions and tigers, but as they were strangely reluctant, this
project was dropped, but not without a few sarcastic remarks from Billy.

âWhy, say, Billy, you know well enough we havenât time for fooling around just
now,â expostulated Fred. âWeâve got to get a train pretty soon, and here you
are pestering us to go in and rough up a few poor animals that canât help
themselves.â

âThatâs right,â said Bobby, in a tone of gentle reproof. âYou ought to know
better, Billy. Besides, the management wouldnât stand for it, anyway. Those
animals cost them a lot of money, and they wouldnât like to have to buy new
ones.â

âHuh! the management wouldnât mind,â snorted Billy. âIt would save them
buying supper for the animals this evening. But you fellows are better at
thinking up excuses than I am at thinking up jokes, so I suppose thereâs no
use talking to you any further.â

âNot a bit,â Bobby assured him cheerfully. âBut speaking of Eskimos, isnât
that the old chief himself over there?â

The others followed the direction of his nod, and sure enough, there was Chief
Takyak talking with a heavy, red-faced person, who carried himself like one
who followed the sea for a livelihood.

The two were talking earnestly together, and as the boys watched them the
seaman drew a notebook from his breast pocket and jotted down something in it.
Then he and the old chief shook hands. The latter started for his tent while
the seaman went off with the rolling stride that comes of walking on the
heaving decks of ships.

âWonder what they were talking about?â speculated Bobby.

âMaybe it had something to do with that âfortuneâ that old Takyak hinted about
to us,â replied Fred. âMaybe thereâs something in it, after all.â

âPossibly,â said Bobby, seriously. âBut we havenât much time to talk about it
right now. Our train is scheduled to leave in about half an hour, and I vote
we get to the station as soon as we can. Itâs better to wait a few minutes
than to lose the train.â

The others agreed to this, and they set off at a rapid pace. They had not gone
far when they turned at the sound of running feet behind them and a breathless
small boy came panting up to them.

âWell, young fellow, what seems to be your trouble?â asked Fred. âYou look as
though you were in a hurry.â

âSo I am,â said the youngster aggrievedly. âYouse fellers walk so fast I has
to run my legs off to catch youse.â

âBut what did you want to catch us for?â queried Bobby.

âDereâs some friends oâ yours wants to speak wid youse,â said the urchin.
âThey told me to ast youse to visit dem.â

âFriends!â repeated Bobby, perplexed. âIâm sure I donât know anybody in
Bayport. Have any of you fellows got any friends or relatives in this town?â

None had, and they gazed questioningly at one another and then tried to elicit
further information from the boy. But he could do little to enlighten them,
and they decided to investigate.

âLead on, kid, show us the way and be quick about it,â said Bobby, and they
all followed in the wake of their small guide. He led them several blocks,
then up a narrow street and around an abrupt corner into an alleyway. The boysâ
mystification was suddenly dispelled, for from a doorway stepped Hen Lemming,
followed by the members of his gang!

CHAPTER VIII

AGAINST HEAVY ODDS

The face of the bully wore an ugly scowl, and Bobby and his friends realized
that they were in for trouble. However, it was not of their seeking, and there
was no way out except flight, which did not even occur to them.

âYou fellers are certainly easy,â sneered Lemming. âYou came to make us a nice
little visit, didnât you? Well, now that youâre here, weâll try to give you
the kind of welcome you deserve after chasing us away from Doc Raymondâs apple
tree.â

âThat was your own fault, and thereâs no use holding a grudge against us for
it,â answered Bobby.

âDonât argue with him, Hen,â growled one ugly-looking member of the gang.
âLetâs give âem the lickinâ thatâs cominâ to them, anâ git it over with.â

âIf it comes to lickings, maybe it will be the other way around,â said Fred,
his quick temper rapidly rising to the boiling point. âItâs a poor game that
two canât play at.â

The bullies made no answer to this, but began to close in on the boys.
Opposing the toughs were Bobby, Fred, Mouser, and Billy. They were outnumbered
by Henâs gang, which consisted of four besides himself. They were so much
larger and heavier than the boys they confronted that they seemed to think
they had âsoft pickingsâ ahead of them.

But in this they reckoned without their host. The boysâ blood was up, and even
in a hopeless battle they were not going to be beaten without a struggle. The
bullies made a concerted rush at Bobby and his friends, and by mere weight
made them give ground for a moment. But they were right back at their foes and
struck out gallantly with all their force. They were strong and athletic for
their age, and the school sports had kept them in fine condition, while the
bullies, though older, were soft and dissipated. Bobby lashed out and caught
Lemming with a well-directed punch in the jaw while the other boys fought like
young wildcats.

The fight waxed fast and furious in the narrow alleyway. Mouser was knocked
down, but Bobby and Fred stood over him and beat his assailants off until
their comrade could struggle to his feet.

Fierce wrath was in the hearts of the trapped boys and the light of battle
gleamed in their eyes.

Their unexpectedly strong resistance daunted the gang opposed to them, and
there was still a chance that the boys might win when three other toughs
dashed out of the hallway and joined the gang. This accession of force was too
much, and Bobby and his chums were overborne. Then their hands were tied and
they were carried into one of the mean and dirty-looking houses.

Once inside the house the bullies went through their pockets and took their
money, watches and everything else of value. The rascals then withdrew to one
corner of the room and held a lengthy whispered conversation which the boys
could not hear. It was not hard to deduce that they were the subjects of the
discussion, however, and the boys waited with what patience they could muster
for the next move.

Nor had they long to wait. The conference in the corner came to an end, and
Hen Lemming approached them.

âYou fellers will be sorry that you ever interfered with me before I get
through with you,â he blustered. âIt will be a long time before you get back
home. Iâll show you that it doesnât pay to butt in on my affairs.â

âWe donât ask any pay; itâs a pleasure,â said Billy, with an attempt at a
grin, but Henâs scowl only grew deeper.

âYouâll be laughing out of the other side of your face pretty soon,â he
threatened. âTake them down to the cellar, boys, and be sure you lock the door
after you when you come up. I donât want to take any chances of their getting
away.â

Resistance in their present predicament was out of the question, and the four
boys were hustled down a dark flight of steps and into a damp and moldy
cellar, without a ray of light in it except the few feeble gleams that
percolated down from the door at the top of the stairs. Even this was soon
shut off, and they heard the door slam and the sound of a key being turned in
the lock.

Bobby was the first to speak.

âWe seem to be out of luck, fellows,â he said, with an extremely rueful laugh.
âI never thought that big bully would ever get the best of us, but it looks as
though he had at last.â

âItâs his turn now, all right, but ours will come,â said Fred. âI wonder if
there isnât any way out of this black hole.â

âYou wouldnât be able to see it, if there were,â said Bobby. âLetâs feel
around the walls and see if we can discover anything.â

This they did, but without success. The damp walls seemed unbroken by any
opening save that place where the stairs led down from the floor above. Time
and again they felt painstakingly about the clammy place, but the last trip
was no more profitable than the first.

âI guess weâre up against it,â said Mouser, at last. âAbout the only thing
left to do is sit down and wait for the next move on the part of the jailers.
Theyâve got us dead to rights, and I suppose thereâs no use squealing.â

âNot a bit in the world,â agreed Bobby. âLikely enough theyâre only trying to
scare us, anyway. Maybe when they think weâve been down here long enough,
theyâll let us go.â

âWell, Iâd like to get a wallop or two at Lemming before I go,â remarked Fred,
grimly. âThat was a beaut that you handed him at the beginning of the
scrimmage, Bobby.â

âI landed him the best I knew how, anyway,â acknowledged his friend. âI guess
he knew something had hit him.â

The boys did their best to keep up their spirits and remain cheerful, but as
the hours dragged themselves along and no sound came from their captors, their
misgivings grew stronger and stronger. What had Hen Lemming meant when he had
said that it would be a long time before they saw home again? Was this mere
idle talk on the part of the bully, or was there a sinister intention behind
it? These and many other speculations occupied their minds in the endless
hours that they spent in the moldy cellar, and it was with sensations of
relief that they at last heard the key grate in the lock at the head of the
stairs.

âCome up here one by one, you fellows, and be quick about it,â ordered the
harsh voice of the leader of the bullies, and the boys had no choice but to
obey.

Bobby was the first to ascend the stairs, and as he reached the top he was
seized, a gag thrust into his mouth, and something smothering and muffling
descended over his head. He struggled fiercely, but he had no chance against
the superior numbers of his captors. A heavy sack was drawn down over his head
and shoulders until it reached his feet, and then the open end was gathered
together and he found himself as helpless as a prisoner well could be. What
had happened to his companions he did not know, and was almost afraid to
imagine.

He was dropped none too gently to the floor, where he lay for quite a while.
He could hear his captors moving about the room and talking in low voices, but
could not make out what was said. After a long time he heard the voice of
Lemming, apparently giving some order, and shortly afterward he was lifted to
the shoulders of two of the gang. These men descended a different flight of
steps from those leading into the cellar where the boys had originally been
confined, and near the bottom they set Bobby down and seemed to be fumbling
with something.

In reality, one of them was undoing a padlock that secured a door set into a
stone wall, and after considerable difficulty he yanked the door open and the
two men picked up their helpless burden again and proceeded through a narrow
and damp tunnel. The passage was scarcely five feet high, and many times Bobby
was bumped and scraped against the roof as the two men carried him along.

At length the narrow passage broadened out, and they set Bobby down with
grunts of relief. After resting a few minutes they carried him up a slippery
ladder to an old wharf. Alongside this floated a small rowboat, and into this
Bobby was thrown in no gentle manner. Then each of the two men picked up a
pair of oars, and Bobby could hear the regular beat of the oars in the
rowlocks and the lap and murmur of water under the boards on which he lay.

CHAPTER IX

SHANGHAIED!

The two men rowed steadily for ten or fifteen minutes, conversing at intervals
in a conversation plentifully besprinkled with rude jests. At the end of that
time the rowing suddenly ceased, and the steady ripple of water at the bow
died down until Bobby knew that they must just be drifting. Whatever was in
store for him, he hoped it would come soon and end the nerve-racking suspense.

The men soon resorted to their oars once more, but this time they rowed very
slowly and cautiously, stopping at frequent intervals. They were approaching a
big schooner lying at anchor in the bay, and as they neared it Bobby could
hear the rattle of cranes and winches and the puffing of donkey engines.

For a long time the rowboat in which he lay remained stationary, but then, at
a word from one of the two men, it moved forward under the impulse of the
oars, and shortly afterward Bobby felt a bump as the bow struck against
something.

A moment later he was seized and thrown on top of a heap of boxes and bags.
âGuess thatâll fix him,â said one of the men. âAnd weâll square up with Cap
Garrish for his meanness. Now letâs get away from here before anybody gets
wise to us,â and Bobby could hear the rapid beat of oars going away from him.

He did his best to struggle and cry out, but he had been so securely bound and
gagged that he could hardly move and found it absolutely impossible to make
any outcry. He was still endeavoring to free himself when he suddenly felt
himself lifted bodily into the air, together with the boxes and bags on which
the two ruffians had landed him. He was lifted rapidly upward, there was a
rattle of blocks and the creak of cables, and he felt a sinking sensation as
he was dropped swiftly downward. This lasted only a second or two, and then he
brought up with a crash as bags and boxes tumbled all about him.

Though Bobby himself could not know just what was taking place, the schooner
was loading from a lighter floating alongside, taking the cargo aboard in a
net made of ropes, which with its contents was lifted by a crane and swung
into the hold. When it landed the net was unfastened and the contents dumped
out into the hold. The two rascals had watched their chance, and when the
derrick was momentarily idle they had thrown Bobby into the net where, wrapped
in the sack, he looked like any article of cargo.

When the winch resumed operations he was swung over into the shipâs hold,
where it was only by a miracle that he escaped death or serious injury from
the heavy bags and boxes that rolled all about him. Fortunately, the ship was
almost through loading, and Bobby had not been in the hold very long before
the rattle of the winch ceased, the hatches were clamped down, and momentary
silence reigned in the dark hold. Evidently the trimming of this portion of
the cargo was to take place later.

The air was hot and close, with a strong flavor of bilge water, and Bobby knew
that if he did not soon get out of the stifling sack he would suffocate. He
worked desperately at his bonds, straining every muscle in an effort to win
freedom. For an hour he struggled sturdily, until he could feel a little
looseness in the rope that bound his hands together. Little by little he
wormed his hand out, bruising and lacerating it in the process, but caring
nothing for that if he could only succeed.

At last with a desperate effort Bobby got his right hand clear, and then the
rest was comparatively easy. He tore away the gag that was slowly stifling the
life out of him, and then tore at the sack until he had made a rent in it. He
got his feet free, and at last wriggled out of the sack, exhausted by his
strenuous efforts, but with the will to live strong within him.

Then he had time to wonder what had become of his companions. Had they by any
chance been brought to this same place? As the thought struck him he shouted
their names. He thought he heard a muffled answer at the other side of the
hold. He groped his way along toward the sound, stumbling over innumerable
articles that encumbered the place, but getting steadily nearer the muffled
voice that he was sure must belong to one of his friends. He would have given
anything he possessed for a light, but the darkness was absolute. At length,
however, he located the sound, and after feeling around discovered a sack that
moved and gave forth sounds of protest when he stumbled over it. In a
twinkling he had ripped it open, and with a joyful heart found good old Ginger
within. It did not take long to free Fred of his bonds, and the two slapped
each other joyously on the back in the relief at finding each other still
alive, even though they were in desperate straits.

âThereâs Mouser and Billy still to be accounted for, though,â said Bobby.
âTheyâre probably in this place somewhere, but I havenât heard anybody but you
since Iâve been here.â

âYou wouldnât have heard me either, if I hadnât managed to get that gag out of
my mouth,â said Fred. âI only hope I get hold of the bunch thatâs responsible
for putting it there,â he added, and there was a grim determination in his
voice that boded ill for Hen Lemming and his friends.

The two friends set about hunting for the others, but in that black hold it
seemed an almost hopeless undertaking. But as it turned out, their aid was not
needed, for before they had been hunting very long both Billy and Mouser
succeeded in freeing themselves, and, guided by each otherâs voices, the four
friends came together.

âWeâre in a fine pickle still, but just the same weâre all alive and no bones
broken, and thatâs half the battle,â said Bobby. âIâm not just sure where we
are, but I think I have a pretty good idea.â

âThatâs more than I have,â said Billy.

âI think weâre on board a ship,â went on Bobby. âIf we are, itâs up to us to
get off again as soon as possible. It may be bound for China for all we know,
and I donât hanker after taking any voyage like that without our folks knowing
anything about it. Theyâll think weâve been killed when we donât show up.â

âThatâs right,â agreed Fred, gravely. âI agree with you that we ought to get ashore, Bobby. But have you any idea how weâre going to do it?â

âOur only chance seems to be to set up a big enough racket to draw attention,â
replied Bobby. âI donât believe the crew know anything about our being here,
and if we can once make our presence known weâll probably be sent ashore soon
enough. Letâs bang on the walls and yell and see if that gets any results.â

They did both these things, but to all appearances they might as well have
saved themselves the trouble. No answering sound came to show that they were
heard, and in the midst of their efforts a new thing happened. A slow shudder
ran through the ship, it trembled and vibrated, and then a rhythmic pulse
began beating somewhere in the huge fabric.

The boys ceased their shouting and hammering, as the meaning of this sank in
upon them. Under the power of the auxiliary engine the ship was moving, and
they, prisoners on board, were being taken to a destination that for all they
knew, might be on the other side of the world!

CHAPTER X

IN THE DEPTHS

Billy was the first to break the portentous silence. âWe donât know where
weâre going, but weâre on our way,â he chanted lugubriously. âIt looks to me
as though we are in a regular mess.â

âItâs wonderful the way you catch on to things right away without any one
having to tell you,â said Fred sarcastically. âHow in the world did you ever
find it out, Billy?â

âYou fellows had better cut out the humor and set your wits to work at some
plan to get us out of this,â said Bobby, impatiently. âWeâve got to attract
attention some way, thereâs no two ways about it.â

They shouted and hammered at the bulkheads until both their throats and
muscles were sore, but with no better success than before. They realized the
futility of the attempt after a time and held a council.

âWeâre here, and so we might as well make the best of it,â observed Bobby.
âThereâs no telling when weâll be discovered hereâpossibly not until the ship
makes port. The first thing to do is to try to find something among all this
mess of cargo thatâs fit to eat. I donât know about you fellows, but I feel as
though a little grub might not go so bad.â

âI guess we all feel that way,â said Fred. âEven if thereâs food in this
place, though, itâs going to be an awfully hard thing to find it in such black
darkness.â

âDarkness or no darkness, weâll get it if itâs here,â replied Bobby, grimly.
âFeel around and see if you can find anything that will break these boxes
open. Weâll just have to keep at it until we do find some grub.â

The boys stumbled about in the pitchy darkness, but for a long time could not
find a suitable tool. At length Mouser succeeded in discovering a loose top on
a crate, and by all pulling together they managed to pry this loose. This gave
them a lever with which they could lift the covers off other crates, and soon
they were busily at work, although the pitch darkness and close air of the
hold were great handicaps. The first two crates they opened yielded nothing
that would be of service to them, but the third one proved more valuable.

âThereâs cans of something in this one!â cried Fred, excitedly. âI only hope
thereâs something inside thatâs fit to eat.â

âMore likely itâs filled with white lead,â said Mouser, pessimistically.

âIt doesnât feel quite heavy enough for that,â replied Fred. âBut now the
question is, how are we going to get them open? Those crooks didnât even leave
me my jackknife, worse luck to them.â

âThereâs some big nails in the cover of one of these crates,â said Bobby. âIâm
going to have a try at the can with that,â and he forthwith fell to work with
an energy that was ably assisted by a growing appetite. In a short time he had
hacked an edge of the cover loose, and then gave a whoop of delight.

âItâs corn, fellows, or I donât know anything,â he shouted. âDig out a can
apiece and go to it.â

They all âwent to itâ with a will, and they were soon eating their fill. Never
had corn tasted so good before, and they each cleaned out a can without the
least difficulty. There were dozens more in the crate, and they had little
doubt that where there was one box full there would be others. Further
exploration proved this to be the case, and they had soon unearthed several
varieties of foodstuffs, so that they knew they would not have to fear
starvation, no matter how long the voyage proved to be. They found some cans
of tomatoes, which served to relieve their thirst.

âWe seem to be provisioned for a cruise around the world,â remarked Billy. âIf
only it wasnât so confoundedly dark, this wouldnât be half bad. I feel like
lying down and having a good long nap.â

âI guess nobody will stop you,â said Fred. âThere doesnât seem to be much else
to do, as far as I know.â

Billy stretched himself out in the most comfortable corner he could find, but
sleep was not as easy as he had imagined. The ship was getting out to sea and
was beginning to roll with a long, deliberate motion, that was most unsettling
to a landsman. In addition to this, various loose boxes began to shift about,
and the boys were in imminent danger of being struck by one of these. In the
darkness it was impossible to dodge, and they had simply to trust to luck to
escape injury. Evidently the ship was sailing in a hurry, before the cargo
could be properly stowed away.

After a while the cargo settled down somewhat, and the danger lessened, but
still there were occasional small landslides whenever the ship gave an
unusually violent roll.

Bobby had been doing some thinking, and now he gave voice to his conclusions.

âIt seems to me there must be an electric light in this place somewhere,â he
said. âProbably thereâs a switch somewhere if we could only find it. Iâm going
to look for one, anyway, and it wouldnât do any harm if you fellows did the
same thing, although I hate to disturb Billyâs beauty sleep.â

âSleep nothing!â exclaimed Billy. âHow do you think I can sleep when this old
tub is skipping around like one of the clowns in the circus? Anybody that
could sleep in this place would have to be pretty tired, it seems to me.â

âWell, if you canât sleep, get on the job, then, and try to locate a switch
somewhere,â said Bobby. âThe only thing to do is to feel around the walls and
trust to luck that weâll find one. If we donât, we wonât be any worse off.â

The boys started out on their quest, more for the sake of having something to
do than with any idea of actually finding a switch. But they had hardly
started when Mouser gave a cry of triumph, there was a sharp click, and the
place was illuminated by two electric bulbs high up under the decks. The light
was far from bright, but it was infinitely better than no light, and the boys
shouted delightedly at this stroke of luck.

âBobby, youâre right there with the inspirations!â exclaimed Fred, slapping
him on the back.

âTry again and see if you canât think us up on deck. I wouldnât put it beyond
you.â

âWhile youâre about it, you might as well think us home and sitting out on the
front porch,â said Billy. âIt wouldnât be so much harder.â

âMaybe if youâd do a little more thinking, I wouldnât have to do so much,â
said Bobby.

âThinking!â echoed Billy, in an aggrieved tone.

âDonât I think up all the jokes for this crowd? If I donât, who does, Iâd like
to know.â

âOh, well, thatâs worse than no thinking,â declared Fred. âThat doesnât really
come under the head of thought at all, as Mr. Carrier would say.â

âWhat is it, then?â demanded his friend.

âItâs just bum humor, neither more nor less,â retorted Fred. âIâll leave it to
the others if Iâm not right.â

âNo, I donât think you are,â said Mouser, seriously. âI donât think itâs humor
at all, bum or otherwise. Itâs just something that makes me feel sad,
something like having a stomachache, for instance.â

âOh, you go chase yourself!â exclaimed Billy, disgustedly. âIâm not going to
waste any more time on you ungrateful knockers. Now that weâve got light, Iâm
going to fix myself up a bunk where even this dizzy ship canât shake me loose,
and then Iâm going to sleep until we reach China and they take the hatches
off.â

âWell, pleasant dreams,â said Fred, grinning. âWeâll wake you up in time to go
and tell your troubles to the Chinks.â

âWe ought to be able to get our laundry cleaned cheap,â said Billy, with a
feeble attempt at a joke. âWhere there are so many Chinamen, the competition
in the laundry business must be fierce.â

âThereâs just a bare possibility that weâll get out of here before we get that
far,â said Bobby. âDonât give up hope so easily, Billy.â

âHope and I are strangers just at present,â answered Billy, lugubriously. âBe
sure you have my bawth waiting for me when I wake up, James.â

âThe only bath youâll get will be if this tub springs a leak, and then you may
get more than youâre looking for,â Fred assured him.

âWell, donât let me be disturbed, no matter what happens,â said Billy. âJust
take something and mop it up, and donât bother me about it. Good night, fellow
Argonauts.â

âOh, go to sleep and donât call us names,â said Mouser, and Billy obeyed
orders to the letter.

The boys had no means of keeping track of the time, and the hours followed
each other in an endless procession. They had plenty to eat, but when four
days had passed they would have given anything they owned to be out of that
stifling hold and up on the clean, windswept decks. They had almost given up
hope of this, when suddenly there was the sound of footsteps on the deck far
above their heads and the scraping sound of a hatch being removed.

CHAPTER XI

A GLEAM OF LIGHT

A broad ray of sunshine came streaming into the hold and the four boys gave a
shout of joy at the sight. Bobby made for the ladder that led up toward the
hatchway, and the others followed close at his heels.

âWhat in thunderâs going on here? Stowaways, and four of them, or Iâll be
blowed!â exclaimed a hoarse voice, as the boys tumbled out on deck. âHow in
the name of all thatâs good did you fellows get into that hold? Ainât been
stowing cargo, have you?â

The voice was that of the second mate, and his astonishment was ludicrous to
behold. Behind him were two or three seamen, who also regarded the boys in
open-mouthed wonder. They had been coming down to make everything shipshape in
the hold.

âWeâre not stowaways,â said Bobby, indignantly. âWe were shanghaied on board
this ship by a bunch of thugs. You can bet weâre not here because we want to
be!â

âWell, I guess youâd better tell that to the captain and see what he says
about it,â replied the second mate. âIâm thinkinâ he wonât be particularly
overjoyed to see you on board his vessel, but then heâll probably be able to
find plenty for you to do. Weâre short-handed.â

âWhat he wants us to do and what we do may be different things,â retorted
Fred, his quick temper getting the better of his diplomacy.

The sailors snickered, and the second mate glared at them and then at Fred. No
suitable retort occurring to him, however, he merely grunted and strode
forward until they reached the bridge.

âHereâs a flock of stowaways we found down in the forward hold, Mr. Garrish,â
he said. âThey claim that they were shanghaied aboard. But, of course, thatâs
what they all say.â

âItâs the truth in this case though,â said Bobby, flushing at this slur on his
honesty. âI wouldnât say that, if it werenât true.â

âHow did you get aboard!â asked Captain Garrish, and then Bobby gave him a
brief account of how they had been attacked by the bullies and carried out to
the ship. The captain listened attentively, and seemed more inclined to accept
his account than had the second mate.

âIf what you tell me is true, I suppose I canât blame you for it,â he said,
eying them moodily. âBut I certainly donât need four passengers on this trip.â

âWe donât have to be passengers, exactly,â answered Bobby. âWeâll help earn
our keep in one way or another. But wouldnât it be possible for you to put us
on board some vessel bound back to the United States? That would probably suit
you better, and it certainly would us.â

âWell, well. Iâll do the best I can,â said the captain. âIt was a lucky thing
you found those crates of canned goods in the hold. Probably, though, youâd
all relish a meal of hot food by this time. How about it?â

âWeâre not the ones to say no to that,â admitted Bobby, and in a short time
the boys were seated about a table in the cabin and were enjoying the first
hot meal for four days. The cook on that vessel was not noted for his skill,
but the boys thought that never in their lives had they tasted better food.
They cleaned their plates more than once, and won the whole-souled admiration
of the mess boy who waited on them. The latter was a negro, and prided himself
on his own ability to consume food, but he was forced to admit that the boys
were his superiors.

âYou white boys shoâ musâ hold cards in de platter-polishersâ union,â he
declared, with a grin that seemed to split his ebony countenance from ear to
ear. âDoan âmember when Ah ever seen nobody relish dere food so thorough as
you does.â

âMaybe if youâd lived on cold canned tomatoes and corn for a few days, youâd
be able to work up an appetite, Mose,â remarked Billy.

âAh doan nebber have to work up an appetite, nohow,â declared the darky, with
a grin. âSeems lak it done come natchel to me, somehow. But you white boys is
about two skips anâ a hop ahead oâ me.â

âWeâll slow down after weâve had a few square meals,â said Bobby. âBut tell
me, Mose, where is this ship bound for?â

âFoâ de Noâth Pole,â declared the darky solemnly, with a shake of his woolly
head.

âThe North Pole!â echoed Billy, while the others sat agape. âAre you trying to
kid us, Mose?â

âWell, ef it ainât de Noâth Pole itâs some place dat ainât fur from it,â
declared the negro. âDis mawninâ Ah heered de captain say dat weâd be seeinâ
de Noâtheân Lights pretty soon, anâ Ah reckons dem lights ainât fur from de
Noâth Pole, is dey?â

âGood-night!â exclaimed, Billy, in a comical tone of dismay. âThis is getting
worse and worse. I was prepared to learn Chinese, but now it seems weâre going
to pay a visit to the Eskimos, and I havenât got my English-Eskimo dictionary
with me. I must have left it lying around the house when I left.â

âEskimo!â exclaimed the darky. âDatâs de name ob de feller de captainâs got
aboard wid him. Datâs his name, sure enough.â

The boys looked at each other, and then Billy gave a laugh.

âThatâs a new name on me,â he said. âI guess you mean heâs got
an

Eskimo with him, donât you!â

âMebbe so. Ah ainât quite shuah. But heâs a strange-lookinâ critter, anyhow,
and furdermoâ, itâs a funny kind ob animal he brought aboard wid him jest
befoâ we pulled up de anchor,â said Mose.

âWhat kind of animal?â asked Bobby, quickly. âIt wasnât a walrus, was it?â

âAh cainât say about dat,â said the other. âDoan know whut is de name ob de
outlandish critter. But jest de same Ah doan like his looks. Floppinâ arounâ
in a tank, wid big teeth an whiskers lak a cat. Ah dares to goodness, it doan
seem as dough de Lord could hab made sech a critter, deed it donât.â

But the boys paid little heed to the negroâs outraged sense of propriety. Many
ideas and questions flashed through their minds, and it did not take them long
to reach the same conclusion.

âIâll bet any money itâs old Chief Takyak and his trained walrus!â exclaimed
Bobby, excitedly, and the others nodded their heads. âWhat in the world do you
suppose is the big idea?â

âIt may be that Takyakâs given up the circus, just as he told us heâd like to
do, and is on his way home to the frozen North,â suggested Mouser. âI donât
see where thereâs anything about it to get you all excited.â

âYes, but if your memory is so good, perhaps you can recall that old Takyak
was hinting around about some kind of a treasure when we were interrupted,â
said Bobby. âDo you remember that after the circus we saw him talking to a man
who looked like a sea captainâSay!â he exclaimed, as another idea struck him.
âHavenât any of you fellows any memory at all?â

âWhat do you mean?â asked Billy, in an injured tone. âIf I didnât have a
better memory than you, Iâd jump over the side and end my misery.â

But Bobby was too excited to take any notice of this remark.

âThe man we saw talking to Takyak that day is Captain Garrish, the master of
this vessel!â he said, and sat back to allow this statement to soak into the
others.

Fred was just about to say something in reply, when the negro, who had been
out to the galley during this conversation, returned, and the boys kept their
own counsel for the rest of the meal. When it was finished they went up on
deck and picked out a quiet corner where they could talk without being
overheard.

âBobby, I believe youâve got the right idea,â said Fred, excitedly. âIt looks
to me as though we were maybe embarked on a treasure hunt. Maybe Hen Lemming
and his gang did us a favor, after all.â

âIt may be so. But still Iâve got to be shown,â said Mouser. âI still think
that youâre getting excited over nothing. Maybe Takyak was just talking to the
captain about taking passage home when we saw them together on the circus
grounds.â

âHuh!â exclaimed Fred, contemptuously. âI suppose you think the captains of
ocean-going ships go round drumming up passengers like the chauffeur of a
sightseeing bus, donât you? Maybe you think that Takyak got him to come to the
circus to talk over the first cabin accommodations for walruses!â

âOh, lay off,â returned Mouser. âMaybe youâre right, but a fellow has a right
to his own opinion, hasnât he?â

âNot when itâs such a foolish one,â said Fred, but Bobby interposed with a
laugh.

âPossibly Mouserâs right, and weâre wrong,â he said. âWe havenât much to go
on, thatâs a fact. Letâs keep our suspicions to ourselves and keep our eyes
and ears open. Maybe we can find out something from Takyak without letting him
know what weâre driving at.â

This seemed about the only thing to do under the circumstances, but, as it
happened, they were enlightened even sooner than they had hoped.

CHAPTER XII

THE LURE OF GOLD

The boys lost no time in hunting up the old Eskimo chief. He remembered them
immediately and seemed glad to see them. He made the walrus do tricks for them
and talked freely enough of his life and experiences with the circus. But when
the boys approached the subject of treasure-hunting he became wary at once,
and they could extract little information from him. They were afraid to
persist, lest they arouse his suspicions. This was the last thing in the world
they wanted to happen, for the idea of sunken treasure had now taken
possession of their minds, and if Takyak really knew where any was located,
they were full of hope to get a share of it.

The prospects did not appear very bright, however, and more than once Mouser
took the opportunity to crow over the other three and remind them that he had
âtold them so.â

âSuch a thing as sunken gold and pieces of eight and all that sort of thing
would never happen to me,â he said one day. âIf it rained soup, Iâd be caught
out with nothing but a fork. Besides, what would a treasure ship be doing up
around the North Pole? It doesnât sound plausible.â

âI donât suppose any treasure ship ever came very far north on purpose,â said
Fred, sarcastically. âThereâs always a chance that it might have been blown up
in a storm, though. Stranger things than that have happened.â

âYes, but not often,â retorted his gloomy friend. âIâd give my share in the
loot to be sitting back on the old porch at home, eating real
honest-to-goodness crullers and enjoying life, instead of staggering around
the north Atlantic in this forsaken apology for a ship.â

âOh, youâll feel mighty different when you get your pockets full of nice,
chinking, yellow gold,â grinned Bobby. âYou wonât wish then that you hadnât
been let in for this involuntary ocean voyage. Look at the bright side of it,
and maybe youâll feel less doleful. You go around looking as though youâd lost
your last friend.â

But Bobby was far from feeling as much confidence as he professed to have. So
far they had little to go on save guesswork and the few chance words of the
old Eskimo, which might have been little more than a product of his
imagination. It might be as Mouser said, that the ship was only going North on
a trading cruise, and the old Eskimo, homesick for his own country, had taken
passage because it happened to be the first vessel that he could get passage
on. But if that were the case, why should the old Eskimo look so suspicious
when they mentioned treasure to him, and refuse to say a word on the subject?
And what had he and Captain Garish talked about so earnestly that day at the
circus?

These and many other questions and surmises sufficed to keep him on the
anxious seat. And in addition to this, was the thought of those at home who
would have not the slightest knowledge of what had happened to their boys and
must have given them up for lost by this time.

They had already learned that the schooner was not equipped with wireless and
that they were sailing out of the beaten track of ocean-going vessels.
Occasionally a sail was sighted, but so far away that signaling was
practically out of the question.

âGuess the captain doesnât want to signal anyway,â said Fred moodily. âHe is
short of hands, you know, and weâll fit in very nicely.â

âAnd maybe without pay,â added Mouser.

All these things combined to make the boys unhappy, and in spite of many
amusing and exciting happenings on board ship, they could not be said to enjoy
the cruise much.

The weather was uniformly good, and the boys were on deck most of the time.
They struck up an acquaintance with various members of the crew, and many were
the yarns they listened to in the off watches while the men sat about on hatch
covers and coils of rope, mending or scrubbing their clothes, or perhaps just
idly drawing at blackened old pipes. They had a good deal of fun, too, with
Mose, the black mess boy, who was always in good spirits and who never grew
seasick, no matter how rough the ocean became.

âAhâs a salty niggah, white boys, anâ dey ainât no sea ebber rolled dat could
make me sick,â he used to boast. âDe onây thing whut it does to me is to give
me an appetite. Yessuh, Ah nebber eats quite so heartily as when de old ship
is standinâ on her beam ends anâ doinâ her best to dive down to Davy Jonesâ
locker. Mosâ times Ah kin do justice to mah meals, but itâs den dat Ah really
comes out strong anâ packs away de victuals.â

He would come from the galley with a load of dishes on each arm, balancing
himself on the heaving deck with all the skill and precision of a tightrope
walker, and for a long time the boys never saw him meet with an accident.

But one day there was a heavy cross swell running. The ship rolled and pitched
and apparently did everything except actually roll over. By this time the boys
had gotten their sea legs, however, and they were seated about the table in
the cabin, waiting for breakfast. A steep flight of steps led down to it from
the deck, and in due course of time the boys saw the negroâs ungainly flat
feet start down the ladder. On one arm he carried a big dish of oatmeal and on
the other a pile of plates. This was no more than his usual load, with which
he had made the descent many times before without mishap. But this morning
luck was against him. He had hardly gotten down three steps, when the ship
gave an unusually heavy roll, which suddenly changed to a pitch as the bows
slanted steeply downward.

Mose struggled manfully to keep his balance, but it was of no use. He felt
himself going, but it was impossible for him to catch hold of anything without
dropping the dishes he was carrying. For a few seconds he gyrated wildly,
while the boys held their breath. Then down he came flat on the deck, while
the big dish of oatmeal went flying through the air and landed against the
bulkhead with a crash.

Soft, clinging oatmeal seemed to fill the air for a few seconds, and
everything in the cabin, including the boys, was liberally sprinkled. The pile
of dishes smashed into a thousand fragments, and the havoc wrought was
terrible to see.

At first the boys were afraid that the negro was seriously injured, but before
they could get to him he was on his feet, looking very sheepish but apparently
none the worse for the accident. When the boys saw that he was not hurt they
broke into roars of laughter.

âWow!â cried Billy, with tears running down his cheeks. âI thought you were so
salty that nothing could ever knock you off your feet, Mose. Guess youâd
better go easy with that stuff after this.â

âDe ole boat shoâ slipped one ober on me dat time. But it cainât nebber do it
no mo,â declared Mose. âHopes de captain doan come down befoâ Ah has a chance
to clean up dis mess. If he ketches me, dis niggahâll shoâ be out oâ luck.â

He set desperately to work, and in an incredibly short time had scraped the
oatmeal off the floor and furniture and had the cabin tidied up. Then he went
to get some more food, and this time met with better success.

Such incidents as this lightened the monotony of the voyage but still the days
seemed very long to the boys, and more than once they longed for the time when
they could get even with Hen Lemming for playing them such a sorry trick.

They often helped the sailors, but were not considered as regular hands. They
had a long talk with Captain Garrish and promised to pay him well if he could
only put them on some ship bound for home. But so far no such vessel had come
their way.

âThat captainâs a queer stick,â said Fred to Bobby, one morning. âAnd heâs got
something on his mind, too.â

âWell, maybe weâll find out what it is some day,â replied Bobby.

And he did find out, and the finding out changed the whole course of Captain
Garrishâs conduct toward the Rockledge chums.

CHAPTER XIII

SUSPICION

Bobby had wandered up into the bow one day and had seated himself on the deck,
with his back resting against a huge coil of rope. The motion of the vessel
had almost lulled him to sleep when he was abruptly brought back to
consciousness by voices near him. They belonged to Captain Garrish and to
Takyak, who were deep in a heated debate.

âYouâve got to give me the map, I tell you!â exclaimed the former, in an angry
voice. âAt least, youâve got to let me look at it and give me a chance to get
my bearings. Iâve steered the course you gave me long enough in the dark, and
now I want proof that Iâm not on a wild-goose chase.â

The Eskimo spoke a broken kind of English that it was almost impossible for
any one not acquainted with him to understand. But Bobby caught the drift of
his garbled talk well enough. He admitted that he had a chart of some kind,
and Bobby made out the words âgoldâ and âwreck.â But it seemed that the old
fellow did not have any too much confidence in Captain Garrish, and refused to
let him see the map until they were among his own people. He clung stubbornly
to this idea, and all the captain could say seemed to have no effect on him.
At length Captain Garrish seemed to give up the argument for the time being.

âWell, I suppose thereâs no use talking to you any more!â he exclaimed
viciously. âIt seems impossible to change that muleâs head of yours, so I
suppose Iâll have to await your convenience. But if youâve been deceiving me
about this treasure ship, look out for yourself when I find it out, thatâs
all.â

Takyak protested vehemently that he was telling the truth, and at length
seemed to convince the captain.

âWell, well, have it your own way,â Captain Garrish exclaimed impatiently.
âIâm going to have a look at that new anchor while Iâm here,â and he brushed
past the Eskimo and the next moment had discovered Bobby.

His face darkened with sudden suspicion and anger, and Bobby leaped to his
feet, believing that the captain was about to attack him.

âWere you spying on us, Bobby Blake?â he inquired in a hard voice. âI know you
were!â he exclaimed, before Bobby could say a word in his own defense. âHow
much did you hear? Come now, out with it!â

âWell, I heard about everything you said,â admitted Bobby, with no attempt to
wriggle out of his unpleasant position. âI heard you talking about some kind
of a treasure ship. But thatâs no more than Takyak hinted to us himself a long
time ago. I wasnât spying on you, anyway. I was dozing here, and your voices
woke me up. How could I know that you two would be talking over a secret in
this part of the ship?â

The captain seemed half convinced, but he still regarded Bobby with a look of
sullen suspicion.

âThe damage is done, now, and thereâs no use crying over it,â he said at
length. âHow much of this do your friends suspect?â

âPretty near the whole thing,â said Bobby, frankly. âAlthough, of course, itâs
only been guesswork up to now,â he added.

âWell, I donât want a word of this to get to the crew,â went on the captain.
âIf they once got the idea in their heads that we were after treasure, thereâs
no telling what they might do. Tell your friends to keep their own counsel,
and see that you do the same. If word of it gets about, Iâll know where to
place the blame.â

âYou can be sure we wonât say anything about it,â answered Bobby. âDonât
forget weâre not on this boat because we want to be. Weâd be only too happy if
youâd put us on some homeward-bound vessel.â

âWell, maybe I will,â said Captain Garrish, but in his heart he had now no
such intention. He had meant to before, as he was anxious to have the boys off
his vessel, but now he resolved to keep them aboard at all costs. If he let
them go, they might tell others of the treasure, and he knew how quickly such
news flies about. When Bobby learned the secret, the last chance that he and
his friends had of getting back home disappeared, although neither he nor they
realized it at the time.

The old Eskimo, now that they had learned something of his secret, became more
friendly and even gave them details of the information that he claimed to
possess. He told them that there was a vessel stranded on the shore of his
northland country and that from it his people got gold for ornaments and for
use at the trading stations.

They had no idea of its real value, however, nor had he had until he ventured
into the land of the white man. Here he had come to learn the immense value of
the gold that lay practically useless in his far northern homeland, and he had
conceived the idea of getting up an expedition and going in search of it.

In some way Takyak had become acquainted with Captain Garrish, and eventually
had interested him in the quest, although he very wisely refused to give the
exact location of the wreck, having a shrewd suspicion that the captain might
help himself to the treasure if he could. So now they were bound in quest of
it.

But of more than of the treasure itself was the old Eskimo in quest of. He was
desirous of seeing his home country once more. To the boys the barren
northland wastes seemed to present little attraction, but with the Eskimo it
was different, and his eyes held a faraway, wistful look when he spoke in his
queer jargon of home and people. From him the boys learned that the treasure
ship was very old and had been lying on the sand before the memory of the
oldest man in the tribe.

The boys became excited as he described the wealth that lay within the
weather-beaten hulk, but even should the expedition be successful, they saw
little chance of obtaining any of the gold for themselves, and their longing
to be home increased day by day. They resolved many wild schemes of escape in
their minds and resolved to be on the lookout for any opportunity for getting
away that might present itself.

This feeling was lashed almost into a passion by the roughness that Captain
Garrish began to manifest toward them soon after he knew that they possessed
his secret. He grew increasingly surly and ugly, and soon drove them to tasks
far beyond their strength. Blows had not come yet, but there was no telling
when they, too, might be added to the burdens the lads were bearing.

CHAPTER XIV

THE MIDNIGHT CONFERENCE

The situation grew worse, and it finally reached the place where the four boys
were given almost no chance to talk together. As Captain Garrish had said, it
was true that the ship was desperately short of hands, and the boys were kept
busy day and nightâwith short intervals for rest, of courseâat unaccustomed
tasks that wore blisters on their hands and severely tested their patience and
nerve.

âYou boys are too much togetherâyou waste too much time in talking,â snarled
the captain one day. âYouâll keep apart after this.â

He had them separated when they turned in also, giving them berths that were
far apart in the forecastle. Evidently, in his strange way, he was growing
more suspicious of them and of Chief Takyak every day. Possibly he imagined
the chief was telling them more than was desirable concerning the quest for
treasure.

Fred it was who chafed most under the restraint, and Bobby was continually
worried for fear he would do or say something that would rouse the captainâs
slumbering wrath. Their only chance, so thought Bobby, was, by a show of
meekness and docility, to fool the captain into thinking there was no longer
any need for watching them closely.

Then, when the captainâs attention was temporarily elsewhere, they would make
a break for freedom.

It was with this end in view that Bobby finally managed to get a word alone
with Fred. It was about twelve oâclock on a dark and stormy night when Bobby
crept like a shadow along the rail, holding fast to this support to keep from
being thrown to the deck by the swaying, heaving motion of the ship.

That morning he had whispered to Fred when they happened to pass close to each
other on the deck. At that moment the captainâs back had been turned to them,
although he was in sight.

âTwelve oâclockâport sideânear the stern,â was all that Bobby had had time to
whisper, but by a slight nod of his head Fred had shown that he understood.

That night, when both were supposed to be fast asleep in their hammocks, they
would slip out noiselessly, trusting to luck that no one would see them and
that they might be able to get in a few words together without discovery.

They must not be discovered. That, each knew without argument. For discovery
would mean that Captain Garrish would be put still more upon his guard. They
would be separated for good, perhaps flung into prison, perhapsâ But Bobby did
not think any further than that. He only knew that they must not be
discovered.

So now, silently and cautiously, two figures crept along the deck to meet at
âthe stern of the ship, port side.â

Once Bobby thought he saw a darker shadow detach itself from the shadows about
the pilot house, and he stopped still, his heart hammering loudly, scarcely
daring to breathe.

When nothing startling happened, however, he decided he must have been
mistaken and moved on again, more cautiously than before.

Then, still clinging to the rail, he descried another figure coming toward
him, and the height and bulk of it and something in the walk told him it was
Fred.

He was close to it. He reached out his hand and touched another hand. It was
Fred, all rightâno mistaking that hearty squeeze.

âWe may only have a minute or two before somebody comes along,â said Bobby
hurriedly, forced to raise his voice a little to make it heard above the
roaring of the wind. âSo letâs get down to brass tacks.â

âRighto!â agreed Fred, crowding close to him against the rail. âYouâve got a
plan, Bobby! I thought I read it in your eye this morning.â

For the moment, forgetting the danger of their position, Bobby grinned in the
darkness. Same old Fred, he thought, light-hearted even in such circumstances!

âListen,â he said quickly. âI havenât any planânot yet. But I will have soon,â
he added, as a sound of dismay broke from Fred. âWhat I wanted to do was to
get word to you and the other fellows that the best thing we can do just now
is to lie low and pretend to be as meek as Moses. Captain Garrishââ

âBad luck to him!â growled Fred, and Bobby saw his fist clench on the rail.

âIs watching usââ

âSo Iâve noticed,â again interrupted Fred.

âSay!â came from Bobby impatiently, âif you know whatâs good for you, youâll
let me say what I have to say so that we can get back to our bunks before
somebody smells us out.â

âOh, all right, all right,â said Fred contritely. âGo ahead, Bobby.â

Bobby wasted no time, but went ahead, glancing about him meanwhile
apprehensively. Any moment he expected to see Captain Garrish walk out from
the shadows and nab them.

âIf we can make the captain think weâre harmless,â he said to Fred, âhe may
stop watching us so closely and weâll have our chance. I donât know yet how
weâre going to manage it, but weâre going to escape from this old tub somehow!
Weâve got to! Our folks must be crazy with fright.â

âAll right, I get you,â returned Fred. âYouâre afraid my red-headed temper
will start a row somewhere and spoil our chances to get away. But you neednât
worry, Iâll keep the lid on tight.â

âFine,â gasped Bobby, as a sudden lunge of the ship picked up a huge wave and
both of them were covered with icy spray. âWeâll have to find some way to pass
the tip on to Billy and Mouser. Theyâre apt to go off the handle any time when
the captain gets rough.â

âWeâll manage somehow,â said Fred between chattering teeth. âSay, but that old
ocean is getting chilly. Hate to be thrown overboard into that ice water.
Where do you suppose we are, Bobby?â

âDonât know,â said Bobby, finding that he also was shivering. âGetting pretty
far up north, I guess. Shouldnât wonder but weâll run across some icebergs if
we donât get out of this mess pretty soon.â

âAlways wanted to see icebergs,â said Fred.

âFunny I donât seem to care much about âem any more.â

âIt would be funnier if you did,â retorted Bobby, and then another sharp twist
of the ship threatened their balance and drenched them through with icy water.

When they had once more regained their footing on the slippery, rolling deck,
Bobby pressed close to Fred, grasping his arm urgently.

âWeâve got to get back now,â he chattered. âBut letâs meet the same way
to-morrow night. Weâll try to slip the hint to Billy and Mouser and have them
here, too. If weâve gotten away with it to-night, we may be able to again.â

âRighto!â agreed Fred.

âAnd in the meantime,â added Bobby hurriedly, âweâll do our best to think up
some way of escape. If we get too far into the Frozen North it will be mighty
hard to get back to civilization. It looks impossible to get free, with
nothing but this water about us, but impossible things have happened more than
once. Weâve got to find a way!â

âIâve got my thinking cap on,â announced Fred. âWeâll think up some way, sure
enough.â With this they parted, returning as silently as they had come, and
regained the safety of their hammocks without meeting with accident.

As Bobby, wet clothes and allâhe did not dare take them off for fear of waking
the other menâgot into the hammock and drew the rough blanket up over him, he
felt strangely happy and elated.

They had succeeded in eluding the captainâs vigilant eye this once, perhaps
they could do it again. At any rate he had enlisted Fredâs help in his plan of
throwing Captain Garrish off his guard, and that was the first big step toward
their escape.

Some day they would give Captain Garrish and his muttering crew the slip for
good and all. If he could only think of a wayâif he could only think of a
wayâand with the words saying themselves over and over in his mind he finally
fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.

It seemed to him that he had not been sleeping five minutes, though in reality
it had been that many hours, when he was roused rudely from his slumbers and
hustled out on deck.

Sleepy-eyed, he stared about him.

It was a gray day; the storm clouds that had pursued them all the day before
had not yet lifted and a fog hung low over the seething water.

Bobby forgot his temporary elation of the night before, when he had succeeded
in talking to Fred. It was all very well to talk of getting away, he thought,
as the coarse rope slipped through his roughened fingers. Talk was all very
well. But how were they going to do it?

His gloomy mood was not lightened any by the fact that Captain Garrish watched
him and the other boys more closely than usual and Bobby even thought he
caught a hint of suspicion in the captainâs hard eyes.

Could it be, thought Bobby, that in some way the skipper had got wind of that
secret meeting the night before? There had seemed to be no one about, but
then, in the darkness of the night, how had it been possible to make sure of
that? The night, especially on shipboard, seems possessed of a thousand eyes.

Could it be, and the thought made him pause for a moment in his work, at which
the captain barked a rough command at him, that the shadow he had seen close
to the pilot house was no shadow at all, but a man, perhaps Captain Garrish
himself, spying upon him?

He stole a glance at the latter and found the skipperâs fierce eyes fixed on
him with that same suspicious glare. Bobbyâs own eyes dropped to the deck, but
his hands clenched angrily.

âIâll show himââ he thought fiercely, as he fought for a firmer footing on the
slippery deck. âIâll show him whether he can look at me like that and get away
with it!â

CHAPTER XV

STEALTHY AS SHADOWS

As the morning wore on, Bobby realized that his fear of discovery by Captain
Garrish was unfounded. The man continued to watch the boys closely, but if he
had known of that secret meeting between him and Fred, the captain would have
done more than watchâof that Bobby was certain.

This certainty once more served to raise Bobbyâs spirits and made him hope
that they might succeed in outwitting the grim old skipper after all.

He watched Fred and saw that the lad was doing his best to live up to the
promise he had given the night before. Several times, beneath the gibe of a
sailor or a sharp command from the captain, Fredâs face turned the color of a
beet and he opened his mouth to speak. But he closed it again with a sharp
click that showed he remembered his promise just in the nick of time.

Every time this happened, Bobby felt like clapping his hands. It was a great
thing for Fred to do, he knew, and he was more than ever thankful for that
brief talk the night before.

Once, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Fred mumble something to Mouser,
sidling up to him cautiously in the course of his work, and he saw Mouserâs
quick glance of surprise and interest.

âGood old Fred,â thought Bobby. âHeâs wasting no time in passing on the good
word. Now, if we can only manage in some way to put Billy wise, all may be
well. Just a few meetings of the four of us at that secret rendezvous, and we
ought to be able to think up some plan of action.â

But how to pass the word on to Billyâthat was the question. How to do it when
Captain Garrish kept an eye on him, Bobby, almost every minute that he was on
deck?

And when the captain himself was not on deck, there was always his faithful
henchman, Rogers, the second mate, to take over the task of watching him.

âThey seem to pick on me especially,â thought Bobby gloomily, after his third
attempt to speak to Billy had met with no success. In fact, this last effort
had been almost disastrous, for Mr. Rogers, the second mate, had very nearly
caught him in the act.

âI donât know why they should think I need special watching,â Bobby went on
with his thoughts. âI certainly havenât given them any trouble yet. Not yet!â
he added, with a sudden gleam in his eye. âBut soon!â

It would have to be soon, he reflected, as he gazed out over the great waste
of waters. The ocean had begun to take on a glassy look; here and there a
block of half-formed ice slithered sluggishly past them.

Bobby had read enough about the Frozen North, that great stretch of forbidding
country, to know that, even if they did escape into it, they might be marooned
in its ice-covered wastes indefinitely. It might be months before they could
return to their own country. And meantime their folks would perhaps mourn them
as dead.

Lashed on by the harsh voice of Mr. Rogers, Bobby once more fell to work at
his uncongenial tasks.

On the last watch that afternoon when he had just about given up hope of
getting a word with Billy, Bobbyâs chance came suddenly and unexpectedly.

He found himself close to Billy and a quick glance about the deck showed him
that at that moment neither the captain nor Mr. Rogers was on deck.

He leaned over and whispered, his voice hoarse with excitement and triumph!

âTwelve oâclock, stern, port,â and Billy flashed him a swift look that showed
that he understood. He would have spoken too, but Bobby raised his hand in a
gesture of warning.

âThe captain,â he whispered, and then proceeded to put as much of the deck
between him and Billy as he could before the captainâs grim gaze fastened on
him again.

âWell, itâs done,â thought Bobby. âThe four of us will meet to-night for a
council of war, even though it be the last one weâll ever have.â

They must take a chance of discovery. They had come to a point where desperate
measures were necessary if they were to escape at all. They could never hope
to get anywhere unless they took a chance.

If they could only escape that night! Bobbyâs face tingled with the hot blood
that rushed to it at the very thought. That night! But how?

There were the longboats. They might manageâthe four of themâto get one free,
lower it into the blackness of the night to the restless ocean. That they
might do. But what then?

They had not the slightest idea where they were. They had no compass, nothing
to guide them. And if they had had such an instrument, they would not know
whether to head north, south, east or west, for they had no knowledge of the
direction in which lay the nearest land.

And there was the problem of provisions and warmth. They must eat and keep
warm. They could not set themselves adrift in an unprovisioned boat without
suitable clothing and expect to live.

They might be picked up by some northern-bound steamer, that is true, but in
this latitude and longitude such ships were rare. They could not afford to
trust to luck.

But all during the endless hours Bobby could not drive the thought of the
longboat from his mind. If they could provision it, find out in some way the
location of the nearest shore. But howâhow?

And then suddenly the answer was given him in a way that he could never have
anticipated.

There were two Eskimos among the shipâs crew, and although at first the boys
had studied them with natural curiosity, they had soon become accustomed to
these black-haired, black-eyed, round-faced people of the North.

They were silent men and seldom joined in the wild songs and capering of the
white men of the crew, but their silence was not morose. They seemed even
friendly in a queer way, and Bobby had thought more than once that he had
surprised in their dull, emotionless stare a look of real interest and
sympathy.

This evening as, worn out by the hours of hard toil he had put in, Bobby was
making his way slowly along the spray-washed deck, he was not altogether
surprised to hear himself addressed by one of the Eskimos.

The man spoke guardedly and it was the tone he used, more than what he said,
that startled Bobby.

âCome with me,â said the guttural voice close to his ear. âI have a message
for you.â

In that minute Bobby did some rapid thinking. What if this man were leading
him into some sort of a trap? Nothing, however, could be much worse than the
present state of affairs. And it was barely possible that the man was
friendlyâthat he would tell him something to his advantageâperhaps help him to
escape.

He nodded and, turning, followed the man down the steep steps of the
companionway.

To his surprise, he was not led aft to the quarters of the men, but forward in
the general direction of the captainâs quarters.

Was it a trap, after all, then? He still had time to turn, to get out of it.
But where could he go on this ship, he thought, where the captain could not
find him and do what he would with him?

All this time they had been making their way swiftly forward, the Eskimo
moving with surprising swiftness, considering his girth.

Once they heard steps coming toward them, and with a guttural exclamation the
Eskimo motioned Bobby into the shadow of a doorway. There they both waited
till the man went by.

The latter was tall and grizzled and there was a scowl on his face as though
he were engrossed in none-too-pleasant thought. He passed so near that Bobby,
by reaching out his hand, might have touched him. With an audible intake of
breath, Bobby recognized the captain.

So his errand was not with the captain, after all.

More puzzled than ever and beginning to feel a tremendous excitement, he left
his hiding place and once more followed the Eskimo.

They came to a door which the Eskimo opened without knocking, and the latter
motioned Bobby into the room. It was a cabin, and rather a spacious one at
that, possessed of all the necessary furnishings.

But only one article of furniture caught Bobbyâs eye, and that was the bed. On
the bed reposed a form that lay so still that Bobby at first thought it was
dead. The next moment he saw that he was mistaken.

The Eskimo, going swiftly over to the bed, muttered something and the quiet
figure moved suddenly, struggling to a sitting posture. The Eskimo put a hand
beneath his shoulders, supporting him.

âCome here,â said the man in the bed to Bobby, and then, and only then, did
Bobby recognize the Eskimo chief, Takyak.

As the lad obeyed the summons he was shocked at the change in the man. He was
gray and emaciated and the hand he held out to Bobby shook.

âWhatâs the matter? Whatâs happened?â cried Bobby. âYou look sick, Chief
Takyak.â

Takyak nodded simply.

âI am dying,â he said.

CHAPTER XVI

THE SECRET TOKEN

The Eskimo who had led Bobby to the cabin made the sick man as comfortable as
possible with pillows propped behind his back, then, at a sign from the
latter, he turned and left the room.

Chief Takyak motioned Bobby to his side.

âSit here, on the bed,â he commanded in his queer English. âI want you close.
I have much to say and I must save my strength. I must hurry.â He said the
last words in a chattering whisper and glanced fearfully at the closed door.

Bobby watched him with a mixture of pity, curiosity and excitement. He liked
the old Eskimo and he also felt sure that it was through no desire of Takyakâs
that he and his friends were treated so harshly on the ship.

âAny minute we may be interrupted,â went on the sick man, pressing a hand to
his side as though suffering intolerably. âAnd I may die, too, and take my
secret with me. Instead, I hope to give it to you.â

He drew in his breath sharply and Bobby saw a spasm of pain cross his white
face.

âTake your time,â he urged. âIf it hurts you to talkââ

âIt is nothing,â the man interrupted in a husky voice, feebly waving an
impatient hand. âIt is my heart that makes the pain. Soon it will have a good
long rest. It will stop forever. Thatâs why I must hurry. Listenââhe leaned
closer and Bobby was conscious of a thrill of excitement as the old manâs face
became tenseââyou must save the treasure from the wrecked ship. You must keep
it from Captain Garrish.â He paused, smothered a groan as another spasm of
pain swept him.

âThe treasure?â repeated Bobby excitedly. âYou want me to save the treasure.
But how?â

âHush, hush. Do not raise your voice. They will hear you.â

The Eskimo was in a panic of fear, and despite his wild excitement and
curiosity Bobby did his best to quiet him.

âListen quietly. We have no time to lose,â cried Takyak, when he had become a
little calmer. âThat captain, that Garrish, has ears in the back of his
headâyes, and in the front too, as well as at the sides. Hark! What was that?â

There was intense silence in the cabin while they listened, holding their
breath. No sound came, and Bobby finally tiptoed over to the door, opening it
gently.

The corridor was empty. The sick man was overwrought, had imagined he heard
something.

Bobby hurried back to Chief Takyak, who motioned to him impatiently. His face
was of a peculiar ashen hue and when he spoke his breath came in labored
gasps.

âTo-morrow,â he whispered, drawing the lad close to him, âat eleven oâclock,
if all goes well, we shall be close to Baffin Land.â Takyak began to talk in
gasps. âGet awayâfrom boatâsome way.â He paused and Bobby waited impatiently,
eagerly, his eyes on the ghastly grayish face of the Eskimo.

The man seemed to struggle a moment with the pain, then, regaining a little
strength, went on feverishly.

âGet provisions, steal longboat some way, turn bow of boat nor-east, right
anglesâshipâcompassâhave compass somewhere.â

He strove to lift himself, and Bobby, with an arm beneath the gaunt shoulders,
helped him while he fumbled beneath his pillow.

He brought it forth triumphantly at last, an old compass, battered as to case,
but in good working order.

âNo lose it,â he cautioned, as Bobby slipped the precious instrument into his
pocket.

âNow let me get this straight,â said Bobby quickly, speaking in a low tone.
âYou mean that if we boys can manage to get hold of a boat, provision her, and
get clear of the ship at eleven oâclock to-morrow night, by keeping the bow
headed steadily northeast we can reach land?â The old Eskimo nodded eagerly.

âYes, yes,â he whispered. âIt is not dangerous, except in a storm.â

âNever mind the danger,â answered Bobby. âYou spoke of a treasure. After we
reach shoreâif we doâwhat do we do then?â

âFind the nativesâask them for Moolooâthey will knowâwill take you to himââ
Again Takyak stopped short, his hand pressed hard against his side.

âYou shouldnât talk,â Bobby protested pityingly. âRest now.â

But Takyak again shook his head, his brows knitting as though in anger.

âI have no time to restâyet,â he gasped. âMooloo is a guide. He knows meâis
faithful to me. If you tell himâ Wait, I will give you this.â Then Bobby
noticed for the first time that this strange old man wore a thin gold chain
about his neck. From the end of this he now detached a peculiar looking object
resembling a tooth, which, as it proved, was exactly what it wasâthe tooth of
an animal, peculiarly marked.

Takyakâs trembling hand sought Bobbyâs, dropping the token in the palm of it.

âWalrus tooth,â he explained haltingly. âMooloo will know itâwill know you
are friend of mineâwill lead you to the wreck.â

âYes?â cried Bobby, unable longer to restrain his eagerness. âThe wreck where
the treasure was hidden?â

Takyak regarded the boy for a moment, his eyes, still piercing in spite of the
shadows of suffering in them, gazing directly into Bobbyâs.

âAh,â he said, âso you did overhear our talk about the treasure. I was sure of
it. So was Captain Garrishâthe rascal! The wretch!â His anger seemed to banish
pain for a moment, and his face glowed with wrath.

âHe tried toâto steal from me,â he cried, his trembling hand waving violently
above his head. âHe would have the treasure for himself! He would take my
share, mine! And, but for me, Chief Takyak, he would never have known there
was a treasure. The treasure is mine, mine! I alone know how to get it and I
give the secret to you. You boys have all been kind to me. You are honest
boys. And you saved my life when the circus pole fell. You must find the
treasure and Garrish must not have it. You hearânone of it!â

âYou neednât worry,â said Bobby, with a bitter memory of harsh treatment at
the hands of Captain Garrish. âYou can bet Iâd never be the one to give him
anything.â

Then he looked at Takyak in alarm. After his fit of temper the man had
collapsed, he seemed utterly exhausted. His gaunt form relaxed against the
pillows and he panted for breath.

âIs there anything I can do?â cried Bobby, feeling helpless in the face of
this emergency. âShall I get somebody?â

Takyak shook his head, and with a faint motion of his hand indicated that he
wanted Bobby to remain where he was. After a moment, during which he struggled
with his breath, the old chief went on again.

âMooloo willâtake you toâthe wrecked ship,â he said, his voice halting and
sounding very weak and far away. âAfter that you will have to work alone.â

âDoesnât Mooloo know anything about the treasure?â asked Bobby, and Takyak
wearily shook his head. He seemed very weak, and for a moment leaned back
among his pillows, apparently gathering strength for a last effort. Meanwhile
Bobbyâs thoughts were whirling madly. Sympathy for the stricken Takyak was
mingled with a wild longing to be away from the cabin, to get by himself where
he might think up plans for the great adventure before him and his chums.

He came out of his reverie to hear Takyak speaking again.

âYou wonder why I tell you all this,â said the Eskimo, and Bobby nodded. âI
have no familyâ I am alone. I like you and your friends,â Takyak went on.
âAnd, besides, there is no one else on the ship that I trust. Garrishâyou must
never let Garrish know!â

At mention of the captainâs name it seemed as though both Takyak and Bobby
were struck with the same thought.

The chief caught at his coat sleeve, tugging at it, nervously.

âYou must go now,â he ordered, in a panicky whisper. âYou must not be
discovered here. Goâand may youâfind the fortune andâlive long toâenjoy it.â

The last words were uttered in a gasping whisper and at the conclusion of them
Takyak sank back, weak and trembling and waved a shaking hand toward the door.

âGo,â he whispered urgently. âGo quickly.â Bobby started to obey, then came
back again. He bent over Chief Takyak and firmly gripped the sick manâs hand.

âIâll find the treasure if itâs possible,â he promised sturdily, adding, in a
tone he tried to make encouraging: âBut Iâm betting that you will be a well
man soon and ready to take your share of it.â To this Takyak only shook his
head and waved his hand once more imperatively toward the door.

âNo, no,â he whispered. âI am dying. I know it. Good-byâandâluck.â

With a mingling of emotions Bobby cautiously opened the cabin door and peered
into the corridor. There was no one in sight and, realizing the danger of
lingering even for a moment in that neighborhood, he ran at top speed toward
the sailorsâ quarters.

He could hardly credit the amazing thing that had just happened to him. He
might even have thought he had dreamed it all if his hand, thrust into his
pocket, had not felt the compass, the little instrument that was going to give
him and his companions freedom, and the token.

âEasy there, Bobby, old boy,â he cautioned himself. âWeâre a long way from
being free yet.â

CHAPTER XVII

GREAT RISKS

Once back in his own quarters, Bobby tried to quiet his racing thoughts and
think out some plan of action. If only he might talk to Fred and the other
boys!

Then he thought of that night and their secret rendezvous and his heart leaped
with joy.

âSay, make believe I wonât have something to tell them! Theyâll probably think
I have been dreaming or am crazy,â he thought excitedly.

He had to caution himself again not to let his imagination run away with him.
He had to be careful also not to let his excitement be seen by his mates. It
seemed to him that they were already regarding him suspiciously.

He must be cool and calm if he and his chums were to stand any real chance of
escape. âSteal a longboat,â Takyak had ordered. All very well, but how was
such a thing to be done without being discovered?

âProvision it,â Takyak had said again. All very well, but how were they going
to provision it without any provisions?

Well, that was his problem and his chumsâ, and they must find a way to solve
it. And the solution must come very quickly, within the next twenty-four
hours. At eleven oâclock on the next evening, Takyak had said.

What was the name of the place he had said they would be near? Baffin Land! He
had heard of it, and he knew enough about its location to know that they were
no longer approaching the Frozen North, but that they were actually in it.

Suppose Takyakâs information had been wrong? Suppose they should not pass
close to Baffin Land on the following evening? Supposeâalways supposing that
they had been able to procure the longboat and provision itâsuppose upon
casting themselves adrift on the ocean they were to find that, after all, they
were too far from land to reach it before being overtaken by any one of the
terrible dangers that menaced them there in that unknown land?

Supposeâbut with an impatient movement Bobby shook off the unwelcome thoughts
that crowded his mind. If they were to embark on the adventure at all he must
put all such doubts behind him.

There would be danger, of course, plenty of it, but not much more than if they
remained here on this ship under the ugly eye of a suspicious captain.

Some way or other Bobby managed to get through the hours that had to pass
before he could hope to meet his chums. When the time came at last he hurried,
as fast as caution would permit, to the rendezvous.

He found two figures there before him. Fred and Mouser had evidently been more
impatient than he.

When he saw Bobby, Fred opened his mouth to shout a greeting, but thought
better of it just in the nick of time.

âIâll spill the beans yet,â he said, in a sheepish whisper, and at that moment
another silent figure approached them through the shadows.

It was Billy, excited and eager, and their number was complete.

âNow letâs get down to business, Bobby, and tell these fellows why we called a
meeting,â suggested Fred.

âYouâd better not talk so loud or weâll be telling our story to Captain
Garrish,â cautioned Bobby, and the boys glanced about them uneasily.

âI passed somebody on my way up here,â said Billy, in a whisper that could
barely be heard.

âI donât know who it was, but I had a notion that he followed me for some
little way.â

âThen we havenât any time to lose,â cried Bobby, and for the first time the
boys noticed the suppressed excitement in his voice.

They crowded close to him, trying to see his face in the deep shadows of the
northern night. There were plenty of questions they wanted to ask, but Bobby
would give them no chance.

Rapidly, he told them what had happened in Chief Takyakâs cabin that
afternoon, and they listened, open-mouthed, with wonder, hardly able to
believe what he was telling them.

Then, when they really gathered what it meant, they wanted to toss their cape
aloft and give vent to their glee.

It was Bobby who restrained their enthusiasm. âNo use getting excited yet,â he
said. âWe havenât escaped from this old vessel yet, you know.â

âWeâll have to now,â said Mouser, suddenly sobered. âItâs up to us to give old
Garrish the slip to-morrow night.â

âIt wonât be so hard to get the boat,â Fred observed. âWe ought to be able to
do that. But itâs getting the provisions that worries me. Weâve got to have
food!â

âTell us something we donât know,â grumbled Mouser. âItâs easy to say weâve
got to get itââ

âAnd we will get it too,â Bobby interrupted decidedly. âI tell you, fellows,â
he added excitedly, âwhat would be the matter with our getting busy now?â

âGreat, if youâll tell us what to do,â agreed Billy.

âSpeedy action suits me down to the ground,â added Mouser, eagerly. âWhen do
we start, Bobby?â

âRight now,â answered Bobby, his words tumbling over one another in his
excitement. âSee?â he added, lowering his voice still more and pointing over
his shoulder toward the stern of the ship. âWeâll take that longboat over
there when the time comes. Our job to-night will be to see that sheâs
provisioned. Weâll take enough food on board to last us a week if we need it.â

âProvision her,â Fred echoed excitedly. âI get you, Bobby. We can break into
the hold and get what we need from those boxesââ

âBut wait a minute,â Mouser broke in quickly. âIf we provision the longboat
now, whatâs to prevent the food being discovered to-morrow?â

âIâve thought of that,â said Bobby shortly. He was impatient of every momentâs
delay. âBut weâll have to take our chance. We can stow most of the stuff away
where it wonât be seen and we can cover the rest with the old tarpaulin I saw
in the boat when I passed it to-day. What say? Are you coming or do you want
to stand there all night arguing?â

Their answer was to follow Bobbyâs lead as he crept silently along the deck to
a hatchway they knew they could open.

It was a risky business, taking provisions from the hold at night, and the
boys fully realized the risk they were running. But excitement made them
forget danger.

They were in the midst of the adventure now and their blood answered to the
thrill of it.

They worked swiftly, talking little. Not for nothing had they been kept
prisoners in that hold, forced to live for days out of food taken from the
boxes.

For the first time since they had been thrown into the place the boys began to
be thankful for their experience. It certainly stood them in good stead now.

Scarcely need even for a light, though Bobby struck a match now and then when
they couldnât remember the exact location of something they wanted.

âWhat are we going to carry them all in?â asked Fred, coming close to Bobby.
âIâve got more than I can manage.â

âHere! Take this,â ordered Bobby briskly, and thrust something rough into his
hands. âItâs an empty sack,â he explained. âDump everything into it and weâll
sort the things out later.â In an amazingly short space of time the feat had
been accomplished, the longboat was fully provisioned with shipâs biscuit,
fresh water, and enough canned goods to keep them going for a long time if
they were careful.

âPretty neat, I call it,â whispered Billy exultantly. âGot by the watch
without half trying. Say! Whatâs that?â

Some one was approaching slowly but steadily along the deck. They knew by his
peculiar stride that it was the second mate.

The boys did not linger to greet him. A moment later they had disappeared, as
completely as though the deck had opened and let them through.

CHAPTER XVIII

DEATH TAKES A HAND

It is safe to say that Bobby and his chums did not get very much sleep that
night. The thought that they had a real chance of escape from the ship where
they had been held prisoners meant more to them just then than the possibility
of finding Takyakâs treasure trove.

As for Bobby, he hardly closed his eyes at all.

He wondered if they had not been foolish to provision the longboat that night.
It would be just their luck to have the provisions discovered the next day,
and then their chance would be gone.

They would be robbed of what little liberty they had enjoyed so far, and, once
more prisoners, would have no hope of escape.

And even if they were successful in getting away from the ship, what then?

Tossing in his hammock, Bobby could hear the blocks of ice gritting against
the sides of the vessel, hungrily, like some beast of prey waiting for its
victim.

Even though, as Takyak had said, they would be near enough to shore on the
following night to gain it in a few hours, what were their chances of getting
through that ice-blocked water?

Even that day they had seen one or two large icebergs looming against the
skyline.

Of course, the danger from these monsters of the sea would be very much less
in the daytime than at night. For, in the darkness, how could they tell of the
approach of one of these until it was almost upon them, too late, then, for
them to get out of the way?

From these troubled thoughts Bobbyâs mind went to Takyak, the dying Eskimo
chief. Wasnât it possible, he thought, that Takyak thought he was worse off
than he actually was?

Suppose he should recover and repent of his confidence?

âWell,â thought Bobby, âin that case he shall have his treasure and we, at
least, will try for liberty.â He hoped the Eskimo would recover. He was
kind-hearted and had tried to put in a good word for them with Captain
Garrish.

Garrish! At the name Bobby felt the same fierce rush of anger he had felt the
day before when the captain had regarded him with that bullying look of
suspicion.

How much did the captain suspect?

Well, if they had any sort of luck at all, they would soon put so much
distance between themselves and the surly captain that what he thought or did
not think would make no difference at all.

If they only had some warm clothing! They had been given top coats from the
shipâs locker, but they were far too big for them. Rushed as they had been
with work on deck, they had not been so conscious of the bitter cold. But in
an open boat, with nothing to shield them from the fierce winds, they might be
frozen to death.

Bobby shivered and thought of the snug fur coats worn by the Eskimo members of
the crew. That was the only thing that could keep out the biting cold of the
Northlandâfur, and plenty of it.

âOh, well, weâll have to take our chance of freezing to death. That, after
all, may be pleasanter than running into an iceberg,â he muttered, with a
sigh.

And so, still listening to the grating of the ice against the sides of the
ship, Bobby at last fell into a doze from which he was rudely roused a half
hour later.

Once more he stumbled blindly to the deck, still more than half asleep and
shivering with the cold.

Another gray day. Angry snow clouds scudded across the leaden sky, the wind
whistled through the mastheads with a threatening sound, heavy ice blocked the
sea, becoming thicker and thicker as they plowed further and further into the
north.

Breakfast cheered Bobby a bit, and he was suddenly seized with an almost
overwhelming curiosity to see if their secret of the longboat had been
discovered yet.

It was some time before he found the chance to make his way to the spot
unobserved, but when he finally got there he found to his intense relief that
everything seemed just as it had the night before when they had fled before
the approach of the second mate.

The extra tarpaulin, which he had replaced with careful carelessness in the
bottom of the boat, looked just the same as it had the day before, when it had
not hid their hope of escape.

Bobby went to work with renewed hope. The hours that stretched between him and
dark seemed an endless procession, but he knew that the best way to make them
pass quickly was to throw himself into the work at hand with all his heart.

This he did, to the apparent gratification of Captain Garrish. It seemed to
Bobby that there was less suspicion in the eyes of the skipper when they
turned his way.

Perhaps, he thought, with an inward grin, their quiet attitude of the last few
days, as if they had become resigned to a hard fate, was having its effect at
last. Captain Garrish was beginning to think them harmless.

The second mate watched them less intently too, and the boys took advantage of
the fact to send wireless messages back and forth.

They were so full of excitement and eagerness to start on their adventure that
Bobby wondered how the keen eyes of Captain Garrish could fail to notice it.

For one thing, and this Bobby did not know, the skipper had more important
things to think about than the behavior of four boys on board his ship.

Takyak, upon whom he had depended to guide him to the scene of the wrecked
ship and to use his influence with the natives in the business of recovering
the treasure, was dying in his bed and, worse than that, he was dying with some
of the most important details of the adventure still unknown to Captain
Garrish.

Vainly the skipper had tried to cajole, and finally to force, the information
from the lips of the dying man. The chief had refused to tell anything, and
now he had fallen into a coma from which there was no rousing him.

No wonder Captain Garrish wore a dark and angry frown and failed to watch the
boys as he had done. Lucky for the boys that on that day, of all days, the
bullying captain had something besides themselves to think about.

All day Bobbyâs thoughts were full of Takyak, wondering if the old fellowâs
prophecy would prove true or if he were getting better.

It was not till near nightfall that he and the other boys learned the truth,
and then in a peculiar way.

Shivering with cold and excitement they were descending the ladder to take a
hard-earned rest when a roar that sounded like that of a mad bull let loose in
a field of red flags reached their ears and made them stand still, gazing,
bewildered, in the direction of the noise.

A moment later a door was pushed open as though with the tremendous impact of
some heavy body behind it and Captain Garrish charged out, his face purple,
his very beard bristling with rage.

As the boys still stood rooted to the spot they saw some one running toward
the enraged captain and in a moment recognized Mr. Campbell, an aged man who
acted as the shipâs doctor.

At sight of the latter the captainâs fury seemed to increase until he became a
madman.

He sprang at the aged doctor, caught him by the throat and shook him as a
terrier does a rat.

âYou confounded rogue!â he bellowed. âWhat do you mean by double-crossing me?
I told you if you let that greasy Eskimo die, it would be your last act on
earth! Say your prayers, youâyouââ

The unfortunate doctor was struggling against the huge hairy hands that were
locked like an iron band about his throat, but his face was purple and his
eyes bulged from his head.

The boys started forward, but at that moment the first and second mates,
hearing the captainâs bellow of rage, had come running, and now they leaped
upon him, forcing his hands loose of their hold upon Dr. Campbell.

In his rage he would have turned upon them, but they were both strong men and
they held on grimly till he abandoned his struggles.

âYouâre mad, Captain,â said the mate. âLet up.â

âIâll fix him!â bellowed the captain, making another lunge at the unfortunate
doctor, who was feeling gingerly of his injured throat. âLet me at him! Let
meââ

But at this point, seeing that the two mates were amply able to handle the
enraged captain and thinking that it was about time they left the scene, the
boys crept away unnoticed.

Most of the men having run to see what was going on, the boys found themselves
temporarily alone.

âGee,â said Fred, his face a mixture of emotions. âWell, itâs all over with
poor old Takyak.â

âYes, and it was pretty near over with Doctor Campbell,â added Billy. âIâll
say that fellow had a close call.â

âIâm sorry for poor Takyak,â said Mouser thoughtfully. âBut, just the same,
itâs lucky for us this happened. It will keep the skipperâs attention from us
for a little while, anyway.â

âYes, but only for a little while,â Bobby reminded him. âAs soon as he gets
over raving about Takyak, heâll begin to think of us and wonder if we know any
more about the treasure than he does.â

âAnd when he does,â said Fred ruefully, âsomething tells me it will be all up
with us.â

âThe only thing we can do,â said Bobby hurriedly, for they could hear the
heavy tramping of the sailors who were returning, âis to take a chance and
start as soon after dark as we can. A few hours from now this old boat will be
getting a little more unhealthy for us than it already is.â

âRighto,â agreed Fred cheerfully, and then they separated, but only until the
welcome darkness gave them the secrecy they must have.

All about him Bobby heard the men talking about the captainâs outbreak,
laughing hoarsely and cracking rough jokes at the skipperâs expense.

âDidnât think the old man loved Takyak like that,â said one of them, in a
mock-sentimental tone. âItâs enough to make a bloke cry âis eyes out, so it
is.â

And still later another man, a big rough fellow with a weekâs growth of beard
and smoldering, deep-set eyes, turned to glower at Bobby.

âIf I wuz you, me ladââ he said, as he took a dirty-looking old pipe from his
pocketââif I wuz you, Iâd cut loose from this outfit, so I would, at our first
port. The skipperâs got it in for you good anâ plenty anâ the skipperâs a
powerful mean man when heâs roused.â

âSo,â retorted Bobby dryly, âIâve noticed!â And then, with a thrill of
excitement, he glanced out of a porthole and saw that it was dark.

CHAPTER XIX

ON ANGRY WATERS

Ten oâclock that night, and the boys were stealing silently to the spot where
the longboat swung on creaking davits, rising and falling with the rise and
fall of the ship.

At last they were together, teeth chattering with mingled excitement and cold,
coat collars turned far up about their ears and caps pulled down to meet them.
They had appropriated all the warm clothing they could find in the shipâs
lockers.

They had learned in the course of their work on deck how to lower the boats
and raise them, and, with scarcely a word uttered between them, they set to
work.

In spite of the pressing need for haste and the biting cold that seemed to
search out their very marrow, they accomplished the feat neatly, the boat
landing with scarcely a splash in the water.

Once voices sounded close to them and they crouched close in the shadows of
the deck-house till the voices passed on.

Then, recognizing more than ever the need for haste, they slid, with as little
noise as possible, into the boat and cast her loose from the schooner.

As they moved away, out into the darkness, adrift at last, they heard a sudden
exclamation, a quick call, and knew that the absence of the longboat had been
discovered.

âDidnât get away any too soon,â said Fred, trying hard to keep his teeth from
chattering.

âWe havenât got away yet,â returned Bobby grimly. âBetter not count our
chickens till theyâre hatched.â

âDo you think theyâll chase us?â asked Mouser.

âNo telling,â returned Bobby. âBut whether they do or not, the thing for us to
do just now is to keep still and work.â

They did as he said, bending to the oars, grateful for work that would keep
the blood circulating in their veins.

Bobby, precious compass at hand, directed their course, occasionally lighting
a match to make sure they were keeping true to it.

And after a while, how long a time they had no way of knowing, they became
sure they were safe from pursuit. There was no human sound in the dark, grim
wastes about them, only the doleful rise and fall of the wind and the brittle
scraping of the ice against the sides of their little boat.

âWell, I guess, fellows,â it was Bobby who broke the silence at last, âthat
weâve done it all right. Weâre free again, anyway.â

âFree!â repeated Fred. âSay, make believe that word doesnât sound good to me!â

âIâll say so,â agreed Mouser and Billy together, and for the moment all doubt
of the future was forgotten in a wild feeling of elation.

Free, free! What did anything matter, now that they had broken away from
Captain Garrish and his ship? They were free!

âAll we have to do now,â cried Mouser jubilantly, âis to think about getting
home.â Strangely enough, instead of cheering them, this thought put a sudden
damper on their enthusiasm. Home! How unattainable and far away it seemed!
What would any one of them give to be sitting now in a familiar room, before a
glowing fire, with familiar faces surrounding him?

Their imaginations dwelt longest on the fire. âSay, just think of it! A
crackling, joyful, leaping fire, in exchange for this deadly cold that
threatens to freeze our very bones!â exclaimed Fred.

For a long time after this remark the boys were silent, working hard to fight
off the feeling of drowsiness that was creeping upon them, blowing upon their
gloved hands now and then to drive the numbness from them.

âHome was never like this,â said Billy at last, in a tone he tried hard to
make cheerful.

âI never knew it could be so cold,â said Mouser. âIâve read enough about it,â
said Fred, adding, with an attempt to stretch his stiff mouth into a grin:
âBut it has to be seen to be appreciated.â

âSay,â said Bobby, putting out a match after another look at the compass,
âwhatâs the matter with you, Billy? Canât you give us a joke or something?â

âThe last time I tried,â said Billy, wondering if his feet were still at the
end of his legsâhe could not tell, for there seemed to be no feeling in them
whateverââperhaps you remember that I was greeted with laughter and ridiculeâa
large amount of it.â

âThatâs all right, Billy; youâre perfectly safe now,â said Fred. âNobody could
laugh at your rottenest attempt now. It canât be done. I knowâbecause Iâve
tried.â

âWell, if youâre sure you want to hear oneââ began Billy, and for once, as he
hesitated, the other boys answered an enthusiastic affirmative. Bad as Billyâs
jokes usually were, they would be welcome nowâanything to make them forget, if
even for a moment, how deadly cold they were.

âWe-ell,â began Billy, between teeth that persisted in chattering, âa young
poetâat least he thought he was a poetâpaid a compliment to a girl with red
hair one day when they were out walking together. She said she thought his
poems were fine, but asked him if he knew the difference between them and her
hair. He said he didnât, but heâd like to. What do you suppose her answer
was?â

âDonât know,â said Mouser.

âToo c-cold to think,â chattered Fred.

âGo aheadâshoot,â ordered Bobby.

âWell,â said the proud and almost happy Billy, âshe said, âthe difference is
that my hairâs red.ââ

It took a minute for the pun to sink home, and then the boys groaned in
unison.

âItâs cruel,â protested Fred. âAnd on a night like this, too!â

âIâd pitch him overboard,â said Mouser, âonly Iâm too tender-hearted. Say,â
with a shiver, âdoesnât that water look cold?â

âIt isnât as cold as I am, Iâll bet,â said Billy, adding anxiously: âSay,
Bobby, isnât it about time we were getting to shore?â

âNot for a little while yet, I guess,â said Bobby, looking once more at the
compass. âWeâre keeping in the right direction, and if Takyak knew what he was
talking about we ought to reach there before long.â

âIf we last long enough,â added Fred dolefully.

In parts of their bodies they had absolutely no feeling, and again and again
they were forced to fight off that insidious drowsiness that crept upon them
like a thief in the dark.

They knew, for they had read enough about persons dying from exposure, that
once they succumbed to the desire for sleep it would be all over for them.

They must keep going, keep their muscles active and the blood circulating in
their veins. Some way they must keep their heavy eyes open.

And then suddenly it seemed to them as though things had changed, the waves,
the very air seemed different, charged with a new menace.

As though driven by a common thought they looked upward at the skyâand felt
snow flakes on their faces!

Snowing! They were running headfirst into a stormâone of those terrific arctic
blizzards, perhaps. It was not imagination, either, that made them think the
waves were higher, that the wind was rising.

One incoming, ice-laden comber struck the side of their boat, listing it
crazily to starboard. There was a sharp cry from Bobbyâa cry of such utter
surprise and dismay that it made the hearts of his hearers stand still.

âThe compass!â shouted Bobby, above the rising wind. âIâve lost it overboard!
Itâs gone!â

CHAPTER XX

THE HAIL FROM THE SHORE

This last dire calamity struck the boys speechless.

The compassâtheir one sure guide on that sinister waste of waters, the one hand reached out to draw them to safetyâthe compass was gone!

At first they refused to believe it. The others besieged Bobby with questions,
begging him to lookâcouldnât it, perhaps, have fallen in the bottom of the
boat? Oh, look! Look!

And Bobby looked, even though he knew the search was hopeless, looked just to
satisfy his chums.

For, at that sudden sharp lurch of the boat, he had felt the instrument slip
past his hands, had heard the splash of it as it reached the water.

That was a fine trick he and his carelessness had played upon his comrades, he
thought miserably, as, recklessly lighting match after match from their
slender store, he pretended to search the bottom of the boat. Through his
carelessness they might all lose their lives.

It was his faultâhis! He would be a murderer! But suddenly he drew himself up
short and once more took command of the situation.

âItâs gone, fellows,â he said quietly. âThereâs not a doubt in the world
about that. Now, the question is, are we going to take our chance and go ahead
without it, or are we going to lie down and say weâre beaten?â

âYou know we arenât going to do that, Bobby,â answered Fred sturdily. But the
next moment he asked with an anxiety that showed the state of his mind:
âYouâre dead sure, are you, that you heard it go overboard, Bobby?â

But Bobby was too intently trying to think how they would meet this new and
appalling difficulty even to hear the question. As for Mouser and Billy, they
seemed stunned into silence.

âI tell you what weâll have to do,â said Bobby at last. âWe know now that
weâre heading in the right direction, and weâll have to keep that course as
nearly as we canâand have to leave the rest to luck.â

âLuckâs been with us, so far,â said Fred, stoutly. âMaybe sheâll go with us
the rest of the way.â

âWe might have had a chance,â said Billy, as though thinking aloud, âif this
storm hadnât happened along. Say, how I love the sight of that snow!â

âCheer up,â said Mouser. âThe Eskimos like the snow, you know. Say itâs nice
and w-warm. Maybe itâs a blessing in disguise.â

âPretty good disguise, I call it,â grumbled Fred, and the boys tried to laugh
and couldnât. Their faces seemed frozen into expressionless masks.

They kept on without very much hope in their hearts, while the sea became more
agitated, the wind rose higher and grew more menacing, while the snow, falling
heavily, seemed to enclose them in a heavy white blanket. They felt cut off
from all the world and utterly lost.

At last they came to the point where they knew if they did not have help soon,
it would not be very long before they would have no need of it.

âLetâs try shouting,â said Bobby, in desperation. âThereâs probably nobody
within several hundred miles to hear us, but itâs about our last chance, I
guess.â

He let out a yell that jerked the other boys from the lassitude that held them
in its grip. Mechanically they shouted, too, with all the strength that was
left them.

Then, as though the sound of their voices had revived some small hope, they
shouted again and again, shouted until they were hoarse and their throats
ached with the strain.

And still nothing but the pounding of the waves that threatened every moment
to upset their boat, pitching them into the icy water! No sound but the
moaning of the wind! Nothing but that driving curtain of snow that beat into
their frozen faces, blinding them!

âLetâs try again,â croaked Bobby. âOnce more, fellows. Itâs a forlorn hope.
But, come on. All together!â

Listlessly they went through the motion of a shout, queer noises coming from
their cracked lips. And thenâ

âListen!â cried Bobby, with a fierce joy in his voice. âListen!â

From afar, piercing that curtain of snow, there came a sound, the faintest
kind of sound, but one that started their hearts to bounding madly. It was a
faint hallooâan answer to their frantic shouts.

And did they reply? Did they? Indeed, they did!

A moment before they had thought it was impossible for them to make another
sound, but it did not take them long to find out their mistake. Frantically
they yelled, growing more and more excited as that answering cry rang out
again and again. Not so faint now and growing louder with each frenzied
second.

Then they saw it! A dreamlike, slender craft, penetrating the curtain of snow,
having as her crew two fur-garbed figures who stared at them stolidly!

They came as close to the longboat as the restless sea allowed, but although
Bobby shouted at the top of his lungs it was evident that they could not
understand him.

However, they pointed through the snow curtain and made motions which the
joy-frenzied boys in the longboat perfectly understood.

They were motioning to them to followâto follow that slender, unstable craft
to the safety of the shore. For they knew that the shore could not be far off
or the natives would not have come abroad to answer their desperate cries for
help.

It was in a surprisingly short space of timeâthe boys learned afterward that
they had been near land for some time, but had been going parallel with
itâthat their boat, reaching shallow water, stuck upon the sea bed, refusing
to go farther.

There was nothing to do but brave the icy water and wade to shore. But the
boys did not mind. They did not care for anything but the fact that they saw
land. And, besides, as by that time they were about as cold as they could be,
they thought the icy water could make little difference.

What bothered them most was the difficulty they found in walking. Their feet,
numbed by the cold and the lack of use, refused at first to support them.

Forcing themselves by sheer will power to stand, they stumbled along through
the icy water, feeling as though their feet were overstuffed pin cushions.

Bobby and Fred were the only ones who had had presence of mind enough in this
moment of rescue to catch hold of the rope attached to the longboat and tug
the latter along toward the shore.

One of the natives, seeing what hard work this was for them, caught hold of
the rope and with a couple of good hard pulls drew it up to safety on the snow
and ice-encrusted ground.

Bobby tried to thank him, but found he was shivering so with the cold that he
could not force the words through his chattering teeth.

The Eskimo seemed to understand his intention, however, and with a jerky nod
of his fur-capped head and a grunt, indicated that the half-frozen lads were
to follow him.

The latter, not yet quite realizing the greatness of their good fortune,
stumbled through the blinding snow, their numbed feet still torturing them.

Where were the natives leading them? Perhaps to a fire and comfort, perhaps
to captivity and new hardships. At any rate, wherever they were bound seemed a
terribly long distance away.

But at last they came to a white object, looming solidly against the
background of the densely falling snow. On approaching more closely to it the
boys found it was a wall, apparently built of snow, about five feet high and
circular in shape.

They wondered if this were some sort of a snow prison. Then they had reached a
narrow opening in the snow wall, just large enough to permit them to squeeze
through it.

They had tramped along but a few feet when they came upon the most peculiar
looking structure they had ever seen in their lives.

It was an igloo, a snow hut of the type that is so common among the far
reaches of the Northern country. To the surprised eyes of the boys it looked
enormous, and the gleaming white sides of it made it look like a fairy
dwelling.

Then one of the natives who preceded them pushed aside a huge skin which
covered the entrance of this queer dwelling and the boys found themselves in a
room whose snug warmth enwrapped them deliciously.

Never before had they reveled in anything as they did in that moment of
physical comfort. For the space of a few seconds it was all they could think
of. They just stood there, basking in it.

Then they realized that it was not only unbelievably warm and comfortable in
that place, but there was a most delicious smell in the air, the aroma of
stew, bubbling over a fire.

They sniffed longingly, and then, as though roused from a trance, they looked
about them. The walls of the snow house were covered with skins which, while
serving to make the place still more snug, served also to give it a more cozy,
homelike appearance.

There were rude pieces of furniture scattered about on which also were skins,
and before the oil stove at one side of the room crouched a woman, stirring
the stew which bubbled over the fire.

And, seeing that the boys were staring at her, this guardian of the feast
opened her mouth to favor them with a wide, good-natured grin.

âCome close to the fire,â she invited. âYou coldâmaybe you hungry, too. Stew
very goodâvery hot.â

CHAPTER XXI

IN THE ESKIMO HUT

Never would the boys forget the music of those wordsâor the taste of that
stew.

While they flung off the snow-covered great coats taken from the locker of
Captain Garrishâs ship, the Eskimo woman ladled up great bowls full of the
steaming stew and the two natives who had led them to the place brought low
stools up to the fire and joined them in their feast.

And what a feast it was! The boys came back for a third helping of stew, and
still there seemed to be an unlimited supply in the great black pot.

And delicious! Never before had they tasted anything quite to compare with it.

They asked what it was made of and the Eskimos with broad grins of delight at
their enjoyment replied in broken English that it was made of the flesh of the
polar bear.

âPolar bear!â cried Fred, pausing with a spoon filled to overflowing with
stew, half raised to his mouth. âGreat Scott! do you have many of them around
here?â

One of the Eskimos shook his head sadly.

âNot so many we like,â he said. âThey go furder anâ furder north all time.â

Fred looked disappointed.

âTough luck,â he said. âI was hoping we might have a friendly little row with
one of them while we were in this neighborhood.â

âCheer up,â said Bobby, happily digging into his third dish of stew. âAfter
the luck we had to-night anything good may happen to us.â

âWell,â broke in Billy, with a comical look of alarm, âif you call coming to
grips with a polar bear good luck, Iâd like to know your idea of bad luck!â

âListen at him!â mourned Mouser.

âAnd after he knows what good stew they make, too,â added Fred.

âOh, Iâve nothing against the stewââ began Billy, at which Bobby broke in with
a grin: âWeâve noticed that.â He then turned to the Eskimo who sat nearest
him. âWeâre looking for a man named Mooloo,â he said eagerly. âDo you know
him?â

The Eskimo grunted and nodded his head. He was feeling too comfortable and
full of stew to be loquacious.

âI know heem,â he said. âHeem good feller.â

Bobby felt like clapping the stolid native joyfully on the back at this
unexpected good fortune. But with a great effort he stifled his enthusiasm,
seeing that Billy and Fred and Mouser were also trying to conceal their
eagerness.

During the course of the conversation, carried on very brokenly by the
Eskimos, the boys found out that they had learned English at a trading station
many miles awayâa station at which ships occasionally stopped for furs and for
live specimens of seals and polar bears.

It would never do to let the natives guess at the boysâ real reason for
wanting to find Mooloo. They might be thoroughly good fellows, but it was very
doubtful whether they could be trusted with news of the treasure.

At thought of it Bobby felt still more exhilarated, triumphant. They had
successfully accomplished the first and, probably, the most difficult stage of
their adventure.

Their escape from the ship had succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Now, if
they proceeded carefully there was no reason why they should not succeed in
the second phase of the adventureâthe finding of Chief Takyakâs treasure.

He wanted to question the Eskimo and try to find out, if he could, if he, as
well as the guide Mooloo, knew the location of the wrecked treasure ship.

But caution made him hold his tongue, merely getting from the Eskimo his
promise to lead him to Mooloo on the following day.

âIf the storm do not keep us here,â the native had added, with a sage wag of
his head. âBlizzard maybe. No can leave igloo four, five daysâmaybe longer.â

At his words the boys looked at each other in dismay. Delay was what they
wanted least. Up to that moment they had not thought of the storm as possibly
delaying their treasure hunt for days, perhaps indefinitely.

And, then, there was the thought of those at home who had no means of knowing
what had become of their boys. If they could not get word south very soon
their people would be forced to give them up as lost.

This consideration kept them silent and thoughtful until the Eskimos rose
sluggishly to their feet and began moving about the place as though they were
preparing to leave.

This brought home to the boys the fact that they also had no place to spend
the night and they also got to their feet, looking rather questioningly and
dubiously at the natives.

It was the woman who came to their rescue with her friendly wide-mouthed grin.

âYou no go out in blizzard,â she said, with a wave of her pudgy hand toward
the out-of-doors. âYou die. You stay here in iglooâsafe, warm, eh?â

âBut you? How about you?â stammered Bobby. âWhere will you go?â

The woman shrugged her fat shoulders as she wrapped herself in a heavy fur
coat and pulled a seal hood down over her ears so that only her eyes and nose
and mouth were visible.

âYou no worry âbout us,â she said comfortably. âWe all right. We got other
iglooâtwo or three. We no die in snow.â

And with another friendly grin she turned and left the snow house, followed by
the two men, who merely grunted their good-byes.

âWell, Iâll be jiggered!â cried Fred explosively. âWho says the Eskimo is an
unfriendly beggar, Iâd like to know! From this time on, if anybody says
anything to me against an Eskimo, Iâll show him where he gets off, all right.â

âGiving us our dinner for nothing and then giving up their house for the night
to a bunch of strangers!â marveled Mouser. âWell, Iâll say theyâre regular
sports, all right.â

âYou bet,â said Billy. âHow do they know weâre not a bunch of crooks?â

âMouser, Iâm surprised at you,â said Fred gravely. âAll they have to do is
look at us to tell weâre honest. Where are you going, Bobby?â

For Bobby had turned toward the door and brushed away the skins that covered
it.

âGoing to have a look at that blizzard,â he answered, âto see what our
prospects are for to-morrow.â

The other boys followed him, but they were met by a driving gust of wind and
snow that drove them back to the shelter of the igloo again.

âSome storm!â whistled Bobby, as they instinctively moved over to the stove
where the fire was still hot. âHate to be adrift in it without a home
to-night, fellows.â

âBut thatâs just where we were only a few hours ago,â Mouser reminded him
soberly. âWe couldnât have lasted much longer in that open boat.â

âForget it, canât you?â protested Fred uncomfortably. âJust the memory of it
makes me cold. Say, this fire feels good.â

âWonder what dear old Captain Garrish is doing just now,â said Bobby dreamily,
as they toasted their feet and hands over the grateful warmth of the stove.

âBetter wonder what heâs saying,â chuckled Billy. âI bet he hasnât any
vocabulary left.â

âWe sure left just in the nick of time, too,â remarked Fred thoughtfully. âI
bet he was cooking up a way of making us tell what we knew.â

âShouldnât wonder,â said Bobby, and then told them what the hairy-faced giant
on the ship had advised him to do.

The boys were intensely interested.

âEven the men knew Garrish had it in for us,â Bobby continued, adding with a
chuckle: âBut I bet this particular man didnât expect us to take his advice
and âbeat itâ quite so quickly.â

âWeâd probably be in prison now in the hold, eating hardtack out of the boxes
to keep from starving,â said Mouser, and they looked at him reproachfully.

âWhy remind us of such unpleasant things?â protested Billy, but Bobby came to
Mouserâs defense.

âAs far as Iâm concerned,â he said, âI donât mind a bit thinking about where
we might be now. It makes this place seem even better by comparison. Say,
fellows, did you ever dream a house made of snow could be so comfortable?â

âIt sure beats me,â agreed Fred, beginning to wander about the room, examining
the skins that hung on the walls. He drew one or two of them aside, disclosing
the solid white wall of snow. âAll the comforts of home!â exclaimed Bobby.

CHAPTER XXII

THE FROZEN NORTH

Suddenly finding themselves tired of exploring their novel quarters and
realizing that they were exhausted, the boys gathered skins together and laid
them upon the floor of the snow hut, reserving one apiece for covering.

Then they lay down on what seemed to them the most comfortable beds they had
ever known.

It was not till they were delightfully snug and comfortable that Billy had the
disquieting idea that somebody really ought to get up and put out the lights.
These consisted of three oil lamps that threw a mellow and not unpleasant
light about the room.

Billyâs suggestion was received with a storm of uncomplimentary remarks.

âBut we canât leave âem burning all night,â persisted Billy, when the riot had
somewhat subsided.

âDo it yourself then,â said Fred drowsily; he was already more than half
asleep.

âAnd for the love of Pete, stop making so much noise,â added Mouser
pathetically. âIâve got to sleep.â

âSuppose you do it, Sleepyhead,â retorted Billy, turning so that the light
from the lamp nearest him would not shine in his eyes. âYouâre nearest themââ

With a sigh Bobby threw off his fur blanket and got up.

âI suppose Iâm the goat, as usual,â he complained. âIf I didnât start
something, you fellows would still be arguing to-morrow morning.â

And then, when all the lights were out and the blessed dark enveloped them,
some one said they ought to have some ventilation.

âSay,â said Fred, raising himself belligerently on one elbow, âif anybody
wants more air in this shebang he can go dig in the snow himself. Iâm going to
sleep.â

âWho says we need more air?â Bobby demanded sleepily. âDidnât you see that
four-inch hole in the roof of the igloo? Thatâs supposed to let in all the
fresh air we need. Now, if anybody says another word, Iâm going to pitch him
out into the snow and let the polar bears get him. Goodnight!â

It is to be supposed that this threat silenced the boys. At any rate, no more
suggestions of any sort were heard from them that night.

However, with the first feeble rays of daylight filtering through the ice that
served as windows they were awake, feeling enormously refreshed by their good
nightâs sleep and healthily ready for anything that might happen.

âI feel as if I could tackle a polar bear right now,â boasted Fred, holding
out his good right arm and feeling proudly of his muscle. âBoy, what I
wouldnât do to him!â

âBoy, what I wouldnât do with his carcass,â added Billy, sniffing the air
hungrily. âI wonder if thereâs any of that stew left?â

He went over to the pot and peered in, giving a whoop of joy.

âLots of it,â he cried. âWhoâs with me?â

âBetter wait a while,â Bobby counseled. âMaybe Mrs. Eskimo wants the stew for
dinner. Anyway, I had enough last night. Iâd like a change of diet this
morning.â

âMy, listen to him!â exclaimed Fred, grinning. âAinât he fussy? Say, what do
you think this is, Bobby? A hotel or something?â

âMaybe our friends wonât come back at all,â ventured Mouser. âAnd then I bet
weâd be pretty glad to eat stew.â

But he had hardly finished speaking when the Eskimo woman arrived.

She came in attired just as she had left the night before, and the boys
wondered if she had slept that way all night.

She grinned good-naturedly and went about the business of preparing breakfast
as though she were used to having four strange boys as visitors every day of
the week.

The boys watched her admiringly as she prepared meal and cut bread in thick
slabs for the table. They hung about her eager to help, and her perpetual grin
widened as she gave them various small chores to do. She had on hand some
provisions brought from the trading station.

When the breakfast was almost ready the two Eskimo men came in, completing the
party. They brought with them many things from the longboat.

When the boys, having satisfied their ravenous appetites, tried to thank the
Eskimos for their timely help, the latter looked so painfully embarrassed and
ill at ease that the boys had to stop.

However, despite the natural backwardness of the natives to speak about
themselves, Bobby, by careful questioning, managed to find out something about
these people who had befriended them.

The two male Eskimos were father and son and the woman of the wide,
good-natured grin, was none other than the wife and mother of the household.

It was the older Eskimo who had spoken to Bobby the night before and promised
to take them to see the guide Mooloo. The younger native seemed even more
taciturn and uncommunicative than his father; so quiet was he, in fact, that
the boys often forgot that he was around.

The name of the older man, as near as they could get it, was Kapje, but they
never found out what the other two members of the family were called.

Breakfast over, Kapje became communicative to the point of saying that
although the snowstorm had not developed into the blizzard he had expected, it
was still snowing so heavily that it would be unwise to try to find the guide
Mooloo that day.

âTo-morrow,â he said heavily. âMaybe next day. No can tell. Snow, she stopâwe
go!â

And despite all their arguing and pleading, the boys could not move him a step
from that resolution.

âMight as well try to move that five-foot snow wall outside,â Billy had
muttered to Bobby in an aside, and Bobby had nodded understanding.

Although he was sensible enough to believe that Kapje knew his business, the
delay was hard to bear. If he had had only himself to consider it is probable
he would have decided to take his chance in the storm, but they could do
nothing without the Eskimoâs help.

Of course, they might seek out some of the other natives, but they would
probably think the same as Kapje about starting out in a threatened blizzard.
And, anyway, Bobby knew that he and the other boys owed more than they could
ever hope to pay to the Eskimo and his son and he did not want to anger them.

After breakfast the boys determined theyâd like to have a look around them,
but when they started to put on the coats they had worn the night before,
Kapje grunted a protest and pointed to a pile of fur clothing which the boys
had not noticed till that moment.

âClothes no goodâno keep cold out,â said the Eskimo scornfully. âI bring you
fur. See! This way you wear âem.â

While the boys, voicelessly grateful for the Eskimoâs kindness, looked on with
interest, Kapje held up the clothing he had brought for them.

âSee,â he explained. âThis your undershirt.â It was a garment made of fawn
skin and designed to be worn with the hair in, next the body. âYou put that on
first, you see. Then this pants and coat made of caribou skins, and these
boots, they keep the legs warm. Seal skin, you knowâmaybe? Anâ these
stockings, also of the seal skin, yes? Fur keep you warm always. Wool, never.â

Then, as though embarrassed at this, for him, remarkably long speech, the
Eskimo turned and left the place before the boys could thank him.

Eagerly the boys examined the strange fur garments. There was a complete
outfit, one for each of them, even including mittens of caribou or seal.

Their inspection was interrupted by the woman who led the way to one end of
the igloo and pushed aside a heavy skin, revealing a low arched doorway, the
existence of which the boys had never suspected up to this moment.

The woman motioned them inside, showing again her friendly grin.

âPut on fur,â she said. âAnâ you never be cold again. Fur very warmâlike
fire.â

âOh, boy!â cried Fred, as he hurriedly flung off his own clothing and stepped
into the undergarment of fawn skin. âIâll say this is the life. Some good old
scout, our friend Kapje!â

âYou bet he is!â exclaimed Bobby, warmly. âI only wish we had some way to pay
him for all he is doing for us.â

âOh, weâll pay him all right,â cried Billy exuberantly. âWhen we get the
treasure weâll divide up fifty-fifty.â

âSay, not so loud, not so loud,â cried Fred, scornfully. âWhatâs the matter
with you, you old stewed prune? Do you want to give our secret away?â

âOh, say! I forgot,â cried Billy penitently. âHonest I did, fellows. I wonder
if anybody heard it.â

âWeâll hope not,â said Bobby, adding, as he pulled on the caribou pants: âBut
seriously, fellows, weâd better be pretty careful what we say. If we can once
get what weâre after, we can be generous. But until then, the least said,
soonest mended.â

And when, attired in fur from head to foot, the boys stepped out into the
bitter world of ice and snow that surrounded the igloo, they realized how true
had been Kapjeâs statement that fur was the only sensible or practical
clothing for a climate where the thermometer often fell to sixty degrees below
zero.

The cold, which would have found its way irresistibly through porous woolen
clothing, no matter how heavy it might be, attacked in vain their impenetrable
suits of fur.

It was a glorious feeling. To know, by the way your nose felt and by your
watering eyes how bitterly cold it was and yet not to suffer any actual
discomfort.

They felt as though that grim North which had swallowed up so many adventurous
travelers from warmer places had suddenly turned friendly to them. They loved
even the snow that fell thickly and heavily, powdering them in no time with a
thick covering of white.

âWe look like Santa Claus,â chuckled Bobby. âNo wonder the dear old boy is
supposed to make his home up this way. I feel as if we ought to come across
him any minute with his reindeer and sleigh.â

âI wish we would,â said Billy. âMaybe heâd take us to see Mooloo. Look,â he
added. âIsnât that our old college chum Kapje coming toward us?â

Clearing their eyes of the snow that blinded them, they peered ahead and found
that it was Kapje looking like a white grizzly bear in his snow-covered furs.

He was heading for the igloo the boys had just left, and when Bobby called out
to him he halted in evident impatience.

âNo can wait,â he called through the brittle air. âFinâ big walrus. Walrus no
wait Eskimo.â With which peculiar words he disappeared inside the igloo.

âSay, fellows,â cried Billy, his eyes as big as saucers, âIâll bet heâs going
to hunt walrus.â

âWell, if he is,â said Bobby joyfully, âyou can just bet weâre going, too!â

CHAPTER XXIII

BALKED OF THEIR PREY

When Kapje returned he was accompanied by a number of other Eskimos who
carried spears and a couple of queer looking boats which the boys afterward
learned were made of animal skin.

These boats, staunch in the water and capable of holding two or three men
apiece, were yet light enough to be carried easily on shore.

As the jabbering natives approached, Bobby made a dive for Kapje and asked to
be allowed to go along on the expedition. The latter grunted assent, giving
each of them one of the sharp-pointed, long, heavy spears.

They tramped on through the loose, light snow till they came to the
waterfront. There they stopped, the Eskimos still jabbering in excitement, and
pointing oceanwards.

The boys strained their eyes to see, through the curtain of falling snow, what
it was the natives were getting so worked up about.

Bobby was the first to see it, and he grabbed Fred, who was nearest him,
pointing out toward the water.

âLook!â he cried. âThat large ice floe! Itâs covered with something! Seals! Or
walruses, I guess. Thatâs what Kapje said!â

The water was filled with floating blocks of ice, varying in size, some of
themâand these were farther out from the shoreâlarge enough to build a small
igloo on.

As Bobby had said, one of these large ice floes was so covered with animals of
some kind that it was weighted down to the surface of the water.

Breathlessly the boys looked from this to the gesticulating natives. It seemed
that they were to witness first hand a native walrus huntâor seal hunt. The
ice floe was not near enough yet for them to determine just what kind of
animals crowded so closely upon it.

âLook!â cried Fred, under his breath. âKapjeâs getting ready for business.â

The Eskimo had deftly slipped one of the queer canoes into the water and had
jumped into it, spear in hand, while two more of the natives followed him.

âSay,â cried Billy excitedly, as the second boat seemed in process of being
launched, âI wonder if we couldnât get in on this party?â

But although they were all wild to go along and take a hand in the fun, they
soon saw that there was no hope of it. There were only two boatsânot enough to
carry all the native hunters, so of course there would be no room for them,
who were strangers to these children of the North, and, in their eyes, rank
amateurs.

âWonder why they donât get a couple of more boats, so they can all go,â
whispered Mouser, and Bobby answered, getting the idea from a story he had
once read.

âThey are afraid of frightening the animals, I guess. They have to steal up on
them quietly, and if too many went they wouldnât have any chance of surprising
them.â

In this Bobby had put his finger on the fundamental idea in the science of
seal and walrus hunting.

The animals, sluggish and slow when not in the water, friendly and
unsuspicious by nature, will, if not frightened, allow their pursuers to
approach quite close to them.

Then it is the aim of the hunters to kill the animals nearest to the
waterâwhether on the ice or ashoreâso that the bodies of the slain animals
surround, prison-like, those of their live companions, cutting off the retreat
of the latter.

So the boys watched, fascinated, while the two slender canoes crept out upon
the water, the natives paddling gently so as not to alarm their intended
victims on the ice floe.

Nearer and nearer they came, the first canoe bearing Kapje, circling
cautiously about the animals, bringing up on the opposite side of the floe
from the other boat.

âSurrounding them!â cried Bobby, beginning to feel a sort of sick sympathy for
the animals at bay. They did not seem to have a chance, surrounded like that.

Then suddenly the incredible thing happened. The animals on the iceâthe boys
had gathered from the mutterings of the Eskimos that they were not walruses,
but were sealsâas though finally deciding that the men in the approaching
boats were not friendly to them, began to move slowly, sluggishly, the ones
nearest the edge slipping off into the water with a dull splash.

The men in the canoes, as though maddened at sight of their escaping prey,
rushed toward the floe and the animals that still remained upon it.

They were too late. Before they had reached near enough to the ice for the
throwing of a spear, the last seal had deserted its resting place, the huge
drifting block of ice was empty.

âZowie, thatâs the time they got fooled!â cried Fred excitedly. âOld Mr. Seal
sure gave them the slip!â

âNot yet!â cried Mouser excitedly. âLook! Theyâre looking for them in the
water.â

âNot much chance,â said Bobby, wondering at the queer relief he felt. âSeals
are mighty slow on land, but they make up for it in the water. Besides, Iâve
read that theyâre pretty fierce when theyâre attacked in the water.â

In this Bobby proved himself right. The men in the boats, after encircling the
ice floe several times in the pursuit of the escaping seals, finally gave it
up and returned, disgruntled enough, to the shore.

âWell,â said Fred suddenly, âI canât say Iâm sorry. The sealâs a friendly sort
of old boyâjust see what faithful intelligent pets they make, almost as good
as a dogâand it seems a shame to kill âem off just for the sake of what you
can get from them.â

âLucky for you the natives canât understand much of what youâre saying,â
laughed Bobby, glad that Fred felt the same way he did about it. âHunting
seals is their chief outdoor sport, you know.â

âWell, they can have it, for all I care,â retorted Fred.

âIt isnât the Eskimos that are killing the seals off,â remarked Billy wisely.
âTheyâre leaving that to us, who live farther south and donât need the fur or
anything about âem, really. The Eskimos do need to kill âem or starve and
freeze themselves.â

Although the boys were eager to find Mooloo, they by no means wasted the rest
of that day.

They wandered about the strange, fascinating, snow-covered land, regarding the
dome-shaped igloos with an interest that never grew less, stumbling at last
into an old stone hut which showed its deserted state in every dejected nook
and cranny of it.

âWonder why thereâs no one living here,â said Mouser, as the lads wandered
about the place. âYou see plenty of snow houses around, but I should think a
place like this would be lots more comfortable.â

They put this question to Kapje some time later when, driven by the pangs of
hunger and a desire to thaw out their noses, they returned to the igloo.

The man, seemingly disgruntled at the failure of the hunt that morning, was
sitting before the fire, a frown on his heavily creased face.

His wife, who was again stirring a delectable smelling mixture over the oil
stove, gave them her broad grin.

In answer to Bobbyâs question of why the Eskimos built snow igloos when there
were perfectly good stone houses going to waste, the native merely grunted and
shrugged his shoulders.

âEskimo like igloo best,â he answered. âTime come move along, leave snow
house, build another. No move stone house.

âUp there,â he added, after a short silence, waving his hand in a generally
northern direction, âEskimo use stone house. Down here he like igloo.â

At that moment, the son of the household entering, Mrs. Eskimo, as Billy
called her, served the lunch and there was no more conversation in that
particular igloo for several minutes to come.

Then Kapje, as though still smarting from his failure of the morning, turned
to the boys, a deeper frown wrinkling his forehead.

âYou see them seal this morning?â he asked, and the boys nodded.

âThat way, lots of time,â went on the Eskimo, as though it were a relief to
tell his grievance to someone. âSeal, he scared. You get spear ready for him
anââpoofâhe gone, like that. Too much hunt. Other time, kill âem easy. Now,
see you come too quick. Seal hunt no like old days.â And here the man shook
his head and looked so mournful the boys had all they could do to keep from
laughing.

After lunch they noticed with delight that the snow had stopped and the sun
was attempting to smile weakly through the heavy storm clouds.

At the sight Bobby charged back into the igloo to tell Kapje the good news and
urge him to start with them right away to find Mooloo. Still the Eskimo shook
his head.

âIn the morning we start,â he said and something in his tone convinced Bobby
that there would be no changing his mind on this point. âThen we reach Mooloo
before dark. Start nowâno can do.â

So, burning with impatience, the boys were forced to spend another night in
the igloo.

First thing in the morning they were up, garbed once more in their snug fur
clothing, ready to start on the journey.

After a hearty breakfast, they shook hands warmly with Mrs. Eskimo, who beamed
broadly upon them and wished them good luck.

Then they were out in the keen, brisk air, with the sun smiling down on them
and Kapje and his son waiting for them to start.

âAll right,â cried Bobby joyfully. âLetâs go.â

CHAPTER XXIV

A TERRIBLE ENEMY

Never as long as they lived would the boys forget that all-day trip. The
intense cold nipped at their faces, trying to reach its icy fingers through
the fur that covered them.

Their outfit consisted of two canoes, one of which was managed by Kapje and
the other by his son. They were amply provided with spears in case they should
meet with any seals or walrus on the journey. There were also a couple of
old-fashioned rifles, which had roused intense interest in the boys.

In response to Bobbyâs question as to why the firearms were necessary, Kapje
had given his characteristic shrug.

âMeet bear, maybe,â he had said, as if such an event was of everyday
occurrence and not necessary to worry about. âGun healthy have along.â

âWhoopee!â Fred had shouted irrepressibly. âHad a notion all along we were
going to have a polar bear fight. Hereâs hoping we have another bear stew
before long.â

At that, Kapje, the Eskimo, had looked at Fred with the nearest to a twinkle
that the boys had seen in his eye and said, slowly:

âWhite boy make stew for bear, mebbe. How that be, eh?â

âNot so good, not so good,â Fred had returned uncomfortably, while his
companions roared with glee. âThat isnât in my program at all, now let me tell
you.â

The boys had chuckled about it all the way down to the waterâs edge. But after
the boat had pushed off from shore and Kapje was guiding it skillfully among
the crowding ice floes Bobbyâs expression became more sober.

âAre polar bears thick around here? Do they find many of them?â he asked of
the Eskimo. He and Fred were in Kapjeâs boat while Billy and Mouser were with
the younger Eskimo.

Kapje shook his head.

âNo so much,â he replied in his funny English. âWhite bearâmost never see him.
Yellow bearâonce a while. He fierceâfight badâshoot.â

âWhat do you mean, yellow bear?â Fred asked curiously. âArenât all polar bears
white?â

The Eskimo grunted as though in scorn of this lack of knowledge.

âWhite bear,â he proceeded to explain laboriously, âhe not so fierce. He run.
Yellow white bear or yellow bearâhe dangerous. He no run; he fight. Shoot.â

âWell,â sighed Fred, resignedly, âyellow bear or white, I only hope we get a
squint at him before we finish the trip.â

They made good time that morning, although toward noon the boys noticed that
the water was becoming more and more thickly blocked with ice so that in some
places it seemed nothing short of a miracle that they were able to get through
at all.

Again and again they thanked the lucky stars that had given them the
experienced and friendly old Eskimo as their guide.

When they finally stopped to rest and eat from the generous lunch Kapjeâs wife
had put up for them, they could see by the Eskimoâs placid expression that he
was well-pleased with the progress they were making.

As Kapje and his son talked together in their own language, the boys wandered
off a little by themselves, in order to talk over what was uppermost in their
mindsâthe treasure.

âWe ought to find it pretty soon, now,â Billy said in low, excited tones.

âIf we find this Mooloo, we may,â said Mouser. âBut by the time we reach his
igloo he may have gone. You know what Kapje said, when an Eskimo gets tired of
one place, he trots on a bit and makes a new snow palace.â

âDown with the gloom hound!â cried Fred, indignantly. âWhatâs the use of
looking for trouble?â

âKapjeâs been mighty white to us,â said Bobby thoughtfully. âIf we ever do
find the treasure you can bet he and his family are going to be mighty glad of
it.â

At the mention of the Eskimo they realized that they had wandered away further
than they had intended and turned to go back. They hastened their steps,
thinking they might have kept their guides waiting.

As they reached the clearing where they had left the two men, some instinct,
some feeling, warned them of danger, cautioning them to proceed quietly.

Although they were hardly aware of this warning, they obeyed it instantly,
their careful footsteps entirely muffled in the thick carpet of snow as they
approached the clearing.

Perhaps one thing that had warned them was the fact that they could no longer
hear the voices of Kapje and his son. Their low, guttural jabbering had
ceased, and in its place reigned an uncanny silence.

Bobby, his hair fairly rising on his head, was the first to reach the clearing
and, still keeping himself partially concealed, he peered forth cautiously
toward the spot where he had last seen the Eskimos.

At the sight that met his eyes it is small wonder that the blood congealed in
his veins. It seemed as though his whole body had turned to ice.

With a slight motion of his hand he warned his comrades to be quiet. But in
spite of the warning they crept close to him, peering over his shoulder at the
tableau that held him spellbound.

Then slowly they also seemed turned to ice, frozen to the spot,
horror-stricken, unable to move.

For there, a few feet from the waterâs edge where they had left them, lay the
two Eskimos motionless, apparently dead. And above them, sniffing at them
curiously, patting them tentatively now and then with a great clumsy paw,
stood a sinister, yellowish shape.

âA bear,â thought Bobby, in horror.

The bear was a lean, half-grown brute, half-starved by the look of him, his
coat a dirty yellow whiteâby Kapjeâs own admission the most vicious and
formidable of his kind.

Bobby heard a gasp behind him and knew that Fred was about to rush into the
open, with nobody knew what mad hope of rescuing the two men from their
horrible fate.

Bobby grasped his friendâs arm, holding on fiercely.

âKeep still,â he uttered in a strangled whisper. âI have a plan.â

Bobby measured the distance between him and that rifle that lay so useless in
the snow. If the bear withdrew only a little way, he would seize his chance,
make a dash for the rifle, and shoot the ugly brute before it could reach him.

It was a mad chanceâan almost impossible chance. Bobby knew that, but he also
knew that it was the only chance they had.

Still holding fast to Fredâs arm, which the latter strove to wrench free, he
centered his attention upon the great bear that still loomed uncertainly above
the prostrate men.

If he should attackâthen Bobby knew what he would do. Trusting to surprise he
would make a dash for that rifle in the mad hope that he might reach it before
the brute reached him.

Ah, what was the beast doing? Puzzled, was he? Undecided whether to begin his
feast then or wait to make sure that his victims were dead.

For a moment it seemed as though he would fall upon the two men lying so
helpless there, and with one sweep of his powerful, sharp-clawed paw rend the
life from them.

Bobbyâs muscles grew tense; he was ready to spring. Then, with a sharp intake
of breath that was almost audible, he relaxed again.

The bear had changed its mind. There was plenty of time. He would sit down and
think it over for a while. With a slow, leisurely movement the animal moved
off a few paces, then turned and sat down, yellow eyes fixed watchfully on its
victims. The slightest movement, the slightest change in the position of those
two menâ

Bobby shuddered and wondered how they could lie so quiet under the
watchfulness of that sinister glare.

He felt Fredâs arm jerk from his grasp and knew he could no longer be
restrained. Bobby knew that the moment for action had come and he gathered
himself to meet it.

Shouting wildly, waving his arms above his head, he dashed out into the open,
seeing one thing, and one thing onlyâthat rifle lying in the snow.

The bear, bewildered, shrank back, staring. Only a moment, but that moment was
enough for Bobby. As, with a roar, the beast sprang forward, Bobby
straightened himself, rifle in hand.

A charging roarâa shotâthe beast towering above him, staggeringâanother
shotâanotherâand a dirty yellow beast writhing in the snow! Then quiet and a
stain upon the snow that spread and spread, turning it to red.

CHAPTER XXV

THE BLINDING BLIZZARD

The whole thing had happened so suddenly that Fred and Billy and Mouser did
not move from the spot where Bobby himself had been but a moment before.

Now they stared dumbly at him, looking with white faces from Bobby to the
beast that lay so still on the snow at his feet.

The Eskimos were the first to stir, and they got to their feet slowly,
dazedly, as though waking from a hideous nightmare, not quite sure yet that
they were actually alive and unhurt.

As though the movement of these two broke the spell the boys were under, they
rushed forward, bombarding Bobby with questions and clapping him on the back,
while they fairly wrung his hand off.

But the natives, a new expression replacing the wonder in their eyes, shoved
the boys aside, holding out their great, fur-mittened hands.

The son of Kapje shook hands with him first, pumping his arm up and down
solemnly.

âYou save life of Eskimoâhe thank you,â was all he said, but there was a look
of doglike devotion in his eyes.

Kapje came next, and his grip was even stronger than his sonâs.

âEskimo bad enemyâgood friendâvery good,â he said simply. âYou save him
lifeâhe no forget.â

That was all, but it was enough to make Bobby understand that he had made two
friends who would serve him faithfully and willingly for as long as he needed
them.

He looked from the smoking rifle in his hand to the body of the great bear and
laughed a little shakily.

âI donât know how I did it myself,â he admitted, adding with interest: âHow
did the bear manage to slip up on you like that, with your guns several yards
away from you?â

The younger Eskimo turned away and Kapje dropped his eyes to the ground as
though sorely embarrassed.

âWe think we see walrus,â he explained reluctantly. âWe drop our gunsâgo look.
When we turn backâsee bear. Drop in snowâmake believe dead. Fool bearâlittle
while. Then you come. Lucky for fool Eskimo you come.â

With this last sentence the old fellow turned away as though the incident were
definitely closed and followed his son down to the water where the latter was
preparing to shove one of the canoes into the water.

âWell, we got our bear, all right,â said Fred ruefully, as he gingerly touched
the dingy yellow coat of the beast with his foot. âI wonder what weâre going
to do with it?â

When they put this question to Kapje he shrugged his shoulders.

âLeave him,â he said, laconically. âNo take him along now. No time. More snow
soon. Maybe we get bear by anâ by.â

At his words the boys noticed for the first time that the sun, shining but a
few moments ago so brilliantly, was now behind heavy clouds that certainly
seemed to presage more snow.

âGee, it wouldnât be much fun to be caught in another blizzard before we can
reach Mooloo,â said Billy, looking anxiously at the threatening sky.

âIâll say not,â said Fred, adding as he passed a hand over his face: âMy face
feels like a chunk of ice. Iâd give a lot for the inside of an igloo just now
and a good hot fire.â

âChoke him, somebody! Think of speaking of a good hot fire when the
thermometerâs sixty below! Cruelty to animals, I call it,â complained Mouser,
as, in answer to imperative gesturing on the part of Kapje, they reluctantly
left the bear to its fate and climbed into the canoes.

âGlad you know what you are, anyway,â grinned Billy and Mouserâs fervent
desire to âget at himâ came near to upsetting the canoe.

At the Eskimoâs sharp cry of warning they settled down, however, and made
themselves as comfortable as possible for the last stage of the journey before
them.

It was almost two hours before the storm overtook them. But then it seemed
intent on making up for lost time. It came not in a gentle fall of feathery
flakes, but in a driving sheet of sleet that beat into their faces
mercilessly, blinding them.

They said nothing, just ducking their heads to avoid the worst of the stormâs
fury, wondering if Kapje would dare to go on in the face of it.

That question was answered sooner than they expected.

They had been making what progress they could in the teeth of the gale for
some fifteen or twenty minutes when the older Eskimo swung in sharply toward
the blurred outline of the shore.

The second canoe followed, and in a moment more they were staggering,
half-blinded and half-frozen, up the slippery, snowy bank.

Kapje was shouting something above the noise of the wind, and the boys came
close to him to hear what he was saying.

They finally made out that he had decided to spend the night there. It was
impossible to make any headway against the raging storm.

In this last statement the boys heartily agreed with him, but they were
dismayed, nevertheless, at the thought of spending the night in that wild,
uninhabitable spot.

It was not long, however, before they learned something of the genius of the
Eskimo when it comes to the making of an igloo.

Without wasting further breath on speech, the natives set to work fashioning
the snow into large blocks, packing them down in such a way that, when they
were through, each block seemed as heavy and durable as rock.

It was not long before the boys caught the idea and threw themselves into the
work with a will. Not only was the work itself fascinating to them, but they
were glad to do anything to ward off the intense cold.

When they decided that they had enough blocks to start building withâand the
Eskimos worked with remarkable rapidityâthey began the actual work of
construction.

It was then the boys marveled, their respect for these simple children of the
North growing by leaps and bounds as they saw the skill with which they set
about the erection of this snow shelter.

Standing within the magically growing igloo they fitted block upon block. The
sides and bottom of each block had been hollowed out in a shallow groove, so
that they fitted closely, and the blocks were piled in such a way that they
formed a solid strong wall.

With his left hand Kapje held the blocks, cutting and fitting with his right
hand, his son helping in this work while the boys, under the instruction of
the older Eskimo, filled in the chinks from the outside with handfuls of loose
snow.

When the work was completed they found themselves the proud possessors of an
igloo about twelve feet square and about seven feet high.

Then they set to work to make snow beds which, while not the warmest in the
world, were soft, and, within the shelter of the snow walls, would ward off
actual discomfort.

âWhat gets me,â said Bobby wonderingly, staring up at the arched ceiling of
the igloo, âis how you manage to make a roof of snow like that without
anything to support it.â

âRoof very strong,â said Kapje, not without a certain pride in the work. âAll
of us get up on roof, sit thereâit no come down. Roof very strong.â

Later the boys helped the natives carry the canoes up close to the igloo where
they would be sheltered from the worst of the storm.

Then they carried the contents of the little craft into the snow house.

They found to their delight that Kapje, with the foresight of his race, or,
possibly, thinking that they would probably run into just such a storm as they
had encountered, had provided for the emergency.

There were canned goods enough to keep them in comfort for several days and a
tiny oil stove for their cooking. And when a fire had been made in the little
stove and the contents of a can of pork and beans was sending out its tempting
aroma, the boys felt that their contentment was complete.

The snow fell steadily all the rest of that afternoon and all night, but in
the morning the storm had abated. It was clear, but bitterly cold. It did not
take the boys long to realize that the thermometer had dropped several degrees
during the hours they had been asleep.

However, refreshed by a good hot breakfast and feeling that they were at last
close upon the trail of the guide Mooloo, they set off in high spirits, which
even the bitter cold could not discourage.

They traveled steadily for several hours without meeting with further
accident, and at last Kapje volunteered the information that they were nearing
the little Eskimo settlement where Mooloo lived in his igloo with his wife and
two small children.

The boys, half frozen as they were, felt their old eagerness reviving at this
information, and when Kapje finally turned in toward the shore they had all
they could do to keep from jumping into the icy water and beating the canoe to
a landing.

Once on shore, it was only a short distance to the igloo of Mooloo, the guide,
and soon they found themselves at the door of the snow house.

Then they followed Kapje and his son into the warmth of its interior.

CHAPTER XXVI

MOOLOO, THE GUIDE

Mooloo, who seemed a surly fellow and not at all like Kapje and his son,
looked up at their entrance with a frown. He had been doing something
mysterious to a sealskin, but now he thrust this behind him with a suspicions
movement.

At sight of the two Eskimos his face cleared a little, but he still regarded
the boys warily.

âLooks as if he thought weâd bite,â whispered Fred to Bobby, and the latter
nudged him in the ribs as a signal to keep quiet.

Kapje said a few words in the native tongueâprobably introducing them, the
boys thoughtâand then he turned, holding out his hand to Bobby.

âTake you to Mooloo,â he said. âI go now. Gooâ-by.â

As he turned to go Bobby tried to stop him, to thank him for all he had done
for him and his chums, but Kapje would have none of it.

âYou no thank me,â he said. âYou save lives of Eskimo. Eskimo never forget.
Gooâ-by.â

The younger Eskimo grunted something that the boys took to be farewell, and in
another moment father and son had disappeared.

A strange misgiving beset the boys. They hated to see these two natives, who
had proved themselves so friendly, go. Here they were now, really at the mercy
of the surly Mooloo.

Maybe he was better than he looked. Anyway, they must say something. They
could not stand there foolishly staring at each other all day. And it was
quite plain that the Eskimo had no notion of breaking the silence.

It was Bobby, as usual, who spoke first.

âAre you Mooloo?â he asked.

The Eskimo nodded, his eyes suspicious.

âWeâve come a long way to see you,â said Bobby. Then suddenly remembering the
walrus tooth token which, for safer keeping he had kept on a string ever since
Chief Takyak had given it to him, he put a hand inside his fur clothing and
drew it forth, breaking the string as he did so.

He approached the Eskimo, holding the walrus tooth in his hand.

âChief Takyak told me to bring this to you,â he said. âHe said you would know
it and would know that we were friends of his.â

The Eskimo, who had never once changed his position and who was now staring up
at Bobby with unblinking, beadlike black eyes, shifted his squat form with a
surly grunt and let his glance drop to the token Bobby held out to him.

The change that came over him was startling. He took the walrus tooth from
Bobby, his eyes lighted up strangely and when he looked up at the lad again it
was evident that he was greatly impressed.

âWhat you want?â he asked, and though the words were abrupt, the tone in which
he uttered them was almost servile.

Bobby had done some quick thinking in the last few seconds. He had already
decided to say nothing that might lead the guide to suspect the real object of
their mission. But since seeing the latter he had made up his mind to be even
more careful.

The fellow was surly naturally. There was a shifty look in his eyes. If he
should once get wind of the treasure, there was no knowing what he might do.
Bobby knew instinctively that this particular Eskimo could not be trusted. So
now he told the fellow just enough to satisfy his curiosityâno more.

They wanted some papers and books they believed to be in the battered hulk of
the ship that had been wrecked a way down the coast. Did he remember it?

By a slight nod and a grunt the Eskimo let him understand that he did.

Well, if they could find the papers and books and get them safely home, the
Eskimo would be well paid. Would he help them?

The Eskimo not only agreed, but seemed eager to be off. The shipâor, rather,
the battered hulk of what had once been a shipâwas not very far from there, it
seemed, only two or three hours journey.

Delighted at the change in the manner of the Eskimo and only too glad not to
delay longer the search for the treasure, the boys agreed to start as soon as
they had something to eat and had warmed themselves before the fire.

Moolooâs wife and his two roly-poly, big-eyed children joined them for lunch;
although the children, shy at sight of the strangers, did their best to hide
behind their mother until hunger and the sight of tempting food lured them
forth.

Refreshed and filled with a wild excitement now that the treasure seemed
almost in sight, the boys, with Mooloo, the guide, set forth eagerly for the
treasure ship.

Unlike Kapje, Mooloo did not use a canoe. His was a flat-bottomed boat, shaped
more like a rowboat, but which he propelled by means of a paddle.

The boys noticed that he slipped several spears into the bottom of the boat
and also an oilskin-covered package which they guessed contained provisions.
Evidently the Eskimos took no chance of going without their meals.

They had not journeyed very far when the boys noticed that, as on the previous
afternoon, the sky was clouding over. A few moments later a handful of
snowflakes showered softly down upon them.

âThis old country,â cried Fred, brushing the flakes off protestingly, âhas got
the habit of snowing, all right.â

âMaybe itâs only a flurry this time,â said Bobby hopefully. âLook! Itâs
stopping already.â

But alas for Bobbyâs hopes. In half an hourâs time the boys saw that the snow
was not stopping. As a matter of fact, it was coming down with a steady
insistence that gave it all the appearance of a genuine long-continuing snow
storm.

âWell, if that isnât the limit,â said Billy disgustedly. âI guess the
weatherâs just been practicing a bit so far. Now itâs ready to give us a taste
of the real thing.â

âWhatâs the matter, Mooloo?â asked Bobby, noticing that the Eskimo was
grumbling to himself. âAnything wrong?â

âMaybe no, maybe yes,â replied the Eskimo, with a return to his surly manner.
âWe lost.â

CHAPTER XXVII

FINDING THE TREASURE

For a moment the boys thought they must have misunderstood him. Lostâon an
ocean filled with menacing blocks of ice! Lostâin a storm like this!

To the chorus of frantic questions flung at him the Eskimo merely replied over
and over again with stoic patience:

âWe lost. Maybe find way againâmaybe not. Bad storm. No can tell.â

Seeing that there was nothing to be gotten from their guide, the boys finally
relapsed into an anxious silence, their eyes straining to pierce the curtain
of snow that fell so thickly about them.

âWell, Iâve had enough snow in the last few days to last me the rest of my
life,â said Mouser, breaking a gloomy silence. âIâll say this is the limit!â

No one contradicted him and again they fell into a miserable silence.

The snow continued to fall, heavy, thick, smothering. The boys noticed, too,
that the ice that blocked the water was becoming more formidable.

They met with larger masses, and sometimes sinister shapes of baby icebergs
slipped by them, looming bulkily through the falling snow.

Once they became so tightly wedged between blocks of ice that it was only by
all working together with the spears, pushing at the surrounding ice with all
their might, that they succeeded in dragging the sturdy little craft free of
her prison, out into the more open waters.

Suddenly a guttural cry from the Eskimo warned them of danger. At the same
time the guide gave a sharp stroke of his paddle which turned the boat
quicklyâbut not an instant too quicklyâto avoid the huge ice floe that was
bearing down upon them.

As it was, they scraped the side of it with a sharp, rending noise, and then
they saw, with a quickening of heartbeats, the animal on the floe.

A walrus! The boys recognized it at once, though this was not like any walrus
they had ever seen before. He was full thirteen feet long, huge of tusk and
fierce-eyed. He must have been very old, for his great body was almost naked
and marked all over with jagged scars of battle.

A walrus is, as a rule, a peaceful animal and is content to leave alone the
strange man creature as long as the man creature is content to leave him
alone. But when the walrus is startled or attacked suddenly, he is remarkably
ferocious and his great ivory tusks make him a formidable enemy.

Now, this walrus had been surprised, and at sight of the spears which the boys
still held in their hands, his whole enormous bulk became suddenly a wicked,
charging fury.

Beside them and a little above their frail boat drifted the ice floe, and upon
it was that infuriated beast, roaring out its frightful challenge.

No time to get away, no time even to think. Time only to act.

As the beast lumbered heavily toward them, the boys raised the spears, which
they still held, and lunged with all their might. At the same time Mooloo,
with a yell of rage, hurled his spear with all the force of his body behind
it.

The walrus stopped in its advance, gave one terrific bellow, and wavered for
an instant, its flappers turned in. Then slowly it fell to its side and slid
into the water with a terrific splash that nearly drowned them in icy spray.

A moment more, and they had drifted past the ice floe, which was almost
immediately lost to sight in the whirling snowflakes.

âWhew!â gasped Bobby. âThat was one close call, all right. Never knew a walrus
had that much fight in him.â

âGood thing he didnât fall into the boat,â remarked Billy. âIf he had, there
wouldnât have been a square inch of us left to tell the tale.â

âNot bad signâmeet walrus,â said Mooloo suddenly, and the boys looked at him
quickly. It was the first time their guide had spoken since he had told them
they were lost and they thought they detected a more hopeful note in his
voice.

âNot a bad signâwhat do you mean?â asked Bobby, his heart leaping with hope.

âWalrus no go far from shore,â Mooloo explained. âWe near shoreânear ship,
maybe. We see.â

Although the boys tried not to hope too much from this encouragement, they
were encouraged, just the same. They knew that the Eskimo would have said
nothing if he had not been pretty sure of himself.

And then suddenly there arose, directly in front of them, another grim shape
and, thinking they had met with a real iceberg this time, they called out to
Mooloo to turn aside.

For answer the Eskimo gave a triumphant grunt andâkept right on.

Then the boys saw that it was not an iceberg after all, but the shadowy hull
of a shipâa wrecked shipâundoubtedly the treasure ship.

They felt a wild desire to shout aloud with joy, but somehow they managed to
sit quiet, keeping a tight grip upon themselves. To show too much enthusiasm
would be fatal. Mooloo might guess at their real business there. If he did,
what then?

As they came nearer the boys saw that it must be indeed their ship, the ship
which, wrecked on the treacherous shallows, had been left there to rot by the
indifferent natives. If they had known what treasure lurked in that
dilapidated hulk!

But right there doubt took hold of the boys. Suppose there was no treasure
after all? Suppose they had come on a wild-goose chase? Well, they would at
least know whether they had or not pretty soon. That thought in itself was a
thrill.

The vague outline of the ship, seen through the heavily falling snow, looked
enormous. One of the masts was gone entirely, but the other two stood intact,
rising gauntly, like skeleton fingers pointing toward the sky.

Desolate, forsaken, coated with ice and snow, listing crazily to one side, it
was a forlorn enough object, but to the boys it was the most beautiful and
welcome sight they had ever seen. For, within that battered derelict, what
riches might be hidden, what promise of adventure!

The boat scraped along the side of the wrecked ship, and with a loop of rope
Mooloo fastened the two together.

Lucky then for the boys that their muscles had been trained in outdoor sports
at Rockledge. If they had not been just as agile and strong as they were, they
would never have been able to scramble aboard the ice-coated, slanting deck of
the wrecked ship.

They finally managed it, however, and Mooloo, who had tied a rope about the
oilskin-covered package in the bow of the small boat, shouted to them to hoist
it aloft.

This they did and, seeing that Mooloo was about to join them, set to work with
their sharp-pointed spears to hack away the ice and snow that covered the
hatches.

It was hard work, and in the process the boys forgot that they had ever been
cold and by the time one of the ancient hatches was disclosed they were
perspiring with the effort.

Even harder work it was to pry loose the cover. But when this was at last
accomplished and they peered down into the dark interior of the ship,
something in the look of it made them draw back. Suddenly they were not quite
so anxious as they had been to descend into that yawning hole.

But the voice of Mooloo roused them to the need for action.

âSnow harder all time,â said the Eskimo. âNo stop to-nightâmaybe not
to-morrow. Inside ship, snow no get us. Letâs go! Hump yourselves!â

At this unexpected bit of slang the boys had all they could do to keep their
faces straight. Probably picked it up from the expressive vocabulary of some
stray trader or other and was proud to show his knowledge of the English
language!

âRightâletâs go,â agreed Bobby and, feeling with his feet for the companionway
steps, slowly let himself through the opening.

It was as dark as pitch, and although Bobby struck a match, the feeble ray did
little to dispel the darkness.

At last he felt firm ground beneath his feet and called out to the boys to
come ahead. They obeyed, and a moment later all of them, including Mooloo,
were gathered at the foot of the steps.

Mooloo directed Bobby to strike a match and throw its light on the
oilskin-covered package which he had never allowed to get out of his sight,
and after a moment of fumbling with the cord that bound it, the Eskimo drew
forth an oil lamp.

It took him only a moment to fill it and light it, and when this was
accomplished and the rays of the lamp illuminated their faces, the boys
thought that never had light looked so good to them before.

âWhere are you going?â Fred asked of Bobby, as the latter began climbing the
companionway steps toward the open hatch.

âGoing to put the lid on,â Bobby explained cheerfully. âWhen thatâs done weâll
be as snug as bugs in a rug.â

âStill snowing?â queried Billy, as Bobby once more joined them.

âSnowing!â repeated the latter. âI should say so. Looks as if it didnât intend
to stop for the next year.â

âWell,â said Mouser, âif thatâs the case, Iâll say we were lucky to find this
old boat all right.â

âLucky!â cried Bobby, not able altogether to keep the jubilation from his
tone. âIâll say lucky is no name for it.â

Feeling their way along, the light from the lantern, once out of its circle of
illumination, seeming only to make the darkness more impenetrable, stumbling
over rotting wood and other debris, the boys finally found a cabin that seemed
to be in pretty fair condition. Here they decided to spend the night.

By the light of the lamp and with the help of a small oil stoveâalso extracted
from Moolooâs storeâthey managed to make out a dinner. And, after they had
eaten, they were seized by an almost uncontrollable desire to search for the
treasure at once. Further delay seemed out of the question.

And yet they knew that to show too much eagerness would be the surest way to
arouse Moolooâs suspicion. Then, too, it was getting late and, if the Eskimoâs
prediction were right and there was a possibility of being snowed in for
several days, there was no real hurry about the search.

It was rather an uncanny business, staying in that derelict ship during the
wee small hours of the night, and the boys, keyed up with excitement as they
were, thought they would not be able to sleep a wink.

But, worn out with the thrilling adventures of the day, they were soon
unconscious of time and place and slept heavily until morning.

It was lucky for them that they soon found the opportunity they were
impatiently watching for, when they might search for the treasure without
being accompanied by Mooloo.

The latter settled the question himself by saying that, since the storm was
letting up a little, he would search the waters about the ship while the boys
attended to their business aboard the wreck. He said that seals and walruses
had been seen quite often and sometimes in considerable numbers in the
vicinity of the wrecked ship, and he would like to get one, if possible.

âHe can have his old walrus,â cried Bobby joyfully, when they were at last
alone, the great moment at hand. âCome on, fellows, weâll make hay while the
sun shines. If thereâs any treasure to be found, it will be a good idea to
find it before that old boy gets back.â

They did not waste any time. By the light of the lanternâthe ice that encoated
the ship made it as dark in the light of morning as it was at twelve o âclock
midnightâthey made their way through the vessel, searching cabins as they
went, hacking away with an ax they found in one of them at rotting debris that
barred their way.

As the moments flew by and they had still found nothing, the boys began to
work with almost feverish eagerness. The fact that they must make the most of
Moolooâs absence, drove them on to greater effort. They searched beneath
rotting mattresses, through chests of drawers, whose wood fairly fell away
beneath their hands.

In a cabin that had evidently belonged to one of the mates of the vessel they
found an iron-bound chest, and for a moment thought they had discovered the
treasure. But on forcing the lid of the chest they found only rotting
clothing, personal effects of the dead man who had once occupied that cabin.

It was uncanny, this breaking into the secrets of the dead ship, and the boys
often found themselves listening nervously or glancing over their shoulders
into the mystery-filled shadows about them.

They came to the quarters of the men and it did not take them long to make
sure there was nothing there. Then on to the hold, where they found nothing
but empty boxes or barrels, or barrels containing cans of food rusty and dingy
with age.

They were about to give up the search in despair when Bobby spoke suddenly out
of the darkness.

âFellows, Iâm going back to the cabin we searched first. There was something
queer about it.â

The boys protested that they had searched that cabin thoroughly, that there
was nothing there, but Bobby was not listening to them. Carrying the lantern,
he was already making his way forward, and they had no choice but to follow
him.

Reaching the cabin, they stood around gloomily while Bobby picked up the
hatchet and went carefully about the place, tapping the walls as he did so.

âItâs all off, I guess,â said Mouser, as the other boys followed Bobbyâs queer
actions with little interest. âTakyak fooled us; or maybe he was fooled
himself. Butââ

A sharp exclamation from Bobby cut him short.

âItâs hollow! The wallâs hollow here,â cried the latter, his voice low and
tense with excitement. âHold the lantern close here, somebody! Thatâs the way.
Now, then!â

While the boys watched with an interest that revived in spite of themselves,
Bobby hacked madly at the wall of the cabin.

Three blows, four, and the rotten wood gave way. Bobby, putting all his weight
behind the blow, nearly pitched head first into the gaping hole disclosed by
the ruined wall.

There was a gasp of surprise from those behind him. Then a wild shout of
triumph. For at the same moment that Bobby saw it, they saw it, too.

A great chest, inclosed in the very body of the ship itselfâa chest with heavy
brass hinges, an enormous padlock adorning the face of it.

Hardly knowing what they did, half mad with excitement, they tore at the cover
with their bare hands at imminent danger of losing a finger or two, for Bobby
was still wildly wielding the ax.

Then the cover fell away and what was left of the boyâs sanity fell away with
it. Before their unbelieving eyes lay a treasure of gold and silver coins that
glittered in the yellow lamp-light.

The next moment the boys were down on their knees before the chest, shouting
wildly, incoherently, to one another, burying their hands, their arms in the
glittering treasure.

CHAPTER XXVIII

IN IMMINENT DANGER

For a time the boys were almost out of their heads with delight. Here was more
wealth than they had ever seen or ever dreamed would be at their disposal.
They were inclined to pinch themselves to find out if it was really true that
they were awake and gazing on real moneyâmoney that had such power and yet had
been lying here useless for no one knew how many years.

But there it was staring at them with its yellow eyes, gold of different
coinages and of many countries, amassed no doubt by some thrifty trader who
had sailed the seven seas and at last, extending his ventures to the North for
its rich seal fur, had come to grief on this remote and inhospitable coast.
Probably there had been no survivor of the wreck and the ship had simply been
recorded in the shipping lists as missing and had practically passed from
human memory.

For a time the boys were lost to every other thought but that of the treasure,
and they took it up in handfuls and let it fall in a glittering stream beneath
the rays of their lamp.

âHow much do you think there is?â asked Bobby, in an awed tone.

âThousands and thousands of dollars,â replied Fred, as he took up another
handful. âMaybe it wonât be fun counting it!â

âLetâs do it now,â suggested Mouser. âIâm crazy to know how much there is.â

âNot now,â objected Bobby, as prudence which had vanished for a time returned
to him. âYou fellows mustnât forget that the finding of this treasure has put
us in a mighty lot of danger. It may mean the death of all of us if we donât
watch our step.â

âWhat do you mean by that?â asked Billy, the ecstatic expression on his face
giving way to one of soberness.

âJust this,â returned Bobby: âIf Mooloo should once know that we had found it,
the lives of all of us wouldnât perhaps be worth a plugged nickel.â

âYou donât think heâd murder us?â asked Mouser, in awed tones.

âWho can tell?â returned Bobby. âThere are thousands of men among people that
we call civilized that would kill us as readily as they would a fly to get
this money away from us. How safe do you think weâd be in New York or any
large city if thugs or gunmen knew that we had this with us? And if that is
true there where theyâd have to take chances with the law, how much more
easily might it happen here. We havenât any way to defend ourselves, and
Mooloo with his spears could kill us easily. There wouldnât have to be any
explaining. Heâd simply say, if he said anything at all, that weâd been lost
in a blizzard, and the Eskimos would grunt, and thatâs all thereâd be to it.
Heâd slip our bodies into the sea and theyâd never be found.â

The boys shuddered at the thought.

âDo you think that Mooloo is that kind of a fellow?â asked Billy.

âMaybe he is and maybe he isnât,â replied Bobby. âBut many a bad man becomes a
murderer at the sight of gold, and it wonât do to take any chances. They say
opportunity often makes the thief, and I suppose the same thing is true of
other crimes. And certainly there couldnât be any easier kind of opportunity
than Mooloo would have if he wanted to take it.â

âBut how on earth are we to get the money away from here without Mooloo
knowing about it?â asked Fred, in great perplexity.

âThatâs something weâve got to figure out,â answered Bobby. âBut just now the
thing weâve got to do is to board up this place again and do it quickly.
Billy, you go up on deck and keep a lookout for Mooloo. Give us the tip if you
see him coming, and weâll hustle into some other part of the ship. Lively now,
boys.â

They took another long look at the treasure and then reluctantly closed the
chest. Then they set to work to repair the battered wall as well as they
could. It was not a very workmanlike job, but the walls were so seamed and
cracked anyway that by the time they had finished the repaired part did not
differ greatly from the rest, and they trusted that it would escape detection.

Then they abandoned that particular cabin and took up their quarters in
another as far removed as possible from the treasure trove. Here they got out
their food and prepared a rough meal while awaiting Moolooâs return.

It was not long before he came trudging back, dragging behind him a seal which
had fallen a victim to his spear. His success had made him so well content
with himself that he was less gruff and surly than usual, and even unbent so
far as to tell them something of his morningâs adventures. The boys laid
themselves out to be enthusiastic about his skill as a hunter. The more they
could keep his mind on himself the less likely he was to be inquisitive about
them.

The Eskimo was hungry after his hunt and fairly gorged himself at his meal.
Then with a grunt of satisfaction he rolled himself in skins and stretched out
on the floor, and the boys knew that he would be dead to the world for several
hours.

Nothing could have pleased them better, and they took advantage of his slumber
to make a thorough search of other parts of the ship, taking care to give a
wide berth to the cabin in which they had found the treasure.

What they found, however, was of no value. The remorseless hand of Time had
worked its will on the ship. Everything was covered with mold and mildew and
rust. The sailorsâ chests had long ago been broken open and everything of
value removed. They came across fragments of letters, some in foreign tongues
and most of them illegible from age. Even if they could have read them, the
boys would have shrunk from doing so, as it appeared too much like trenching
on the privacy of the dead.

One or two gold pieces that had escaped the prying eyes of the Eskimos were
gathered up as the boys went through piles of debris.

âThis explains why the Eskimos got the idea that this was a treasure ship, I
suppose,â remarked Bobby. âDoubtless there were a lot of gold pieces in the
sailorsâ chests that represented their wages or savings. Different parties
came back with these from time to time, and the story spread that where there
was so much there must have been more. And itâs barely possible that old
Takyak made the same discovery that we did of the treasure chest and meant
some time to get it away either in driblets or at some time in a mass. Maybe
there was some superstition of his that prevented his taking it before.â

In one of the cabins they came across a number of large books. Some of them
were scattered volumes of an encyclopedia. Others were huge ledgers with brass
clasps in which the traderâs accounts had evidently been kept. Still others
were bound volumes of old magazines designed no doubt to relieve the tedium of
the nights of the Arctic winter.

âQuite a library here,â commented Fred, as he handled one of them. âWhy is it
that they used to make books so big and thick that it was hard to lift them!â

Bobby was glancing over one of them when suddenly an idea struck him with such
force that he fairly jumped.

âIâve found it! Iâve found it!â he exclaimed jubilantly.

CHAPTER XXIX

A CLEVER EXPEDIENT

âYou see these books,â said Bobby, Billy and Fred and Mouser clustering round
him eagerly while he spoke in a low voice. âWell, thereâll be no trouble
getting them away from here, because Mooloo already thinks thatâs what we came
for. Heâll take it as a matter of course that weâve found them, and he wonât
make any difficulty about our taking them back.â

âBut who wants to take them back?â broke in Mouser. âTheyâre as heavy as lead
and theyâre not worth house room to anybody.â

âJust hold your horses,â counseled Bobby. âAs far as Mooloo is concerned,
theyâll be simply books that weâre taking back. But they wonât really be
books. Theyâll be the treasure.â

The others looked at Bobby as though he were crazy.

âCome again,â said Fred, as he scratched his head in perplexity. âI donât get
you.â

âWhen I was at home during the Christmas holidays,â went on Bobby, âmy father
was reading aloud from the paper about some of the tricks that are used in
smuggling. One of them is to take a big book, scoop out the pages in the
center and fill the space with diamonds. Now what those fellows did with the
diamonds weâll do with the money.â

A shout arose that was instantly repressed for fear that Mooloo would hear.

âBobby, that headpiece of yours is a wonder!â exclaimed Fred enthusiastically.

âItâs a dandy scheme,â chuckled Billy.

âItâll sure put it over,â declared Mouser.

âNow, the first thing to do,â continued Bobby, âis to lug a lot of these books
into the cabin where Moolooâs sleeping. When he wakes up, weâll show them to
him and turn over the pages so that heâll see theyâre all there. Ten to one he
wonât do more than grunt and think weâre dippy for taking any interest in such
things. But weâll keep on until heâs got the idea fairly planted in his head
that the books consist of nothing but leaves, for which he doesnât care a rap.
Then heâll have no further curiosity, and will probably never look at them
again.

âThatâll be the first step. Then the next time he goes out hunting weâll get
busy and cut big hollows in the center of the books. Weâll pack these with as
much gold as they will hold, and by the time we get through weâll have
disposed of the whole thing. Then weâll bind each book around with thongs so
as to hold the covers securely together. And those books wonât be unbound
until weâre safe and sound again at home.â

âBut how about the money to pay Mooloo and the other Eskimos for their
trouble?â objected Billy.

âIâve thought of that,â replied Bobby. âWeâll save some out loose in our
clothes so that we wonât have to unfasten any of the books. They wonât know
but that we had that money with us when we came North. And weâll pay them so
handsomely that theyâll be tickled to death and think weâre regular fellows. I
want especially to see that Kapje and his family get plenty for being so kind
to us. And as for Mooloo, heâll get enough to make him a high muck-a-muck
among the Eskimos.â

The boys lost no time in carrying out their plan. They lugged a dozen of the
ponderous volumes into their living quarters, and when Mooloo awoke he found
them poring over them with a great appearance of interest. He jumped at once
to the conclusion that these were the documents that they had come to find.

âFind um-huh?â he inquired.

âJust what we wanted,â replied Bobby with perfect truth, taking the book he
was busied with and turning over the pages before Moolooâs eyes.

The latter glanced at them with dull indifference. If he had any pronounced
feeling at all, it was one of disgust that these queer strangers should be
interested in such trivial things when there were seals and bears and walruses
to be hunted.

Bobby kept on turning the pages of one book after another until Mooloo yawned
and turned away his eyes. Still Bobby persisted, until with an impatient grunt
the Eskimo pushed the book away and fell to mending one of his spears.

This was just what Bobby had hoped for. It was safe to say that only main
force could make Mooloo look again at one of the books for which he had
conceived a profound contempt.

The snow still persisted, and for this the boys were intensely grateful. They
had never thought that they would be thankful for being snowbound on that
bleak Arctic coast. But now they needed time above everything else, for the
work they had in hand must be done with exceeding care to avoid any
possibility of a slip.

The rest of that day was lost for the purpose, for Mooloo had done all the
hunting he cared for, and he had plenty of work on hand in skinning the seal.
But the next morning he again went out to try his luck, and then the boys
worked with feverish energy to carry out their plan.

Before the guide returned, this time in a bad humor because his efforts had
been fruitless, they had made notable progress. Mooloo was getting restless
and wanted to return to his home, but he knew that it would be unwise under
present weather conditions. But he gruffly announced his belief that on the
second day from then the storm would have so far abated that they might make
the return trip in safety.

The delay was to the boys what a reprieve would be to a condemned man, and
they so well employed the next day that when Mooloo returned in the evening
with two seal carcasses and in high feather their work was done. The snow had
stopped falling and it was arranged that they should set out bright and early
on the following morning.

The day broke clear but terribly cold. Still, by this time, the boys had
become partly used to the climate and they were sustained by an internal fire
that made them flout the cold.

While Mooloo got the boat ready and bestowed in it his hunting weapons and
other belongings, the boys lugged out the books and put them in the boat. The
books were now much heavier than they had been with their former paper
contents, and the boys wanted nobody to handle them but themselves. They did
not have to fight for this privilege, for Mooloo was only too content to let
them handle their burdens alone, and he gave them an occasional glance that
had in it something of amused contempt at the store they set on such worthless
things.

Still, if these queer people wanted to indulge in such things it was no affair
of his as long as he got paid for his trouble. And it may have been the desire
to have his pay that made him put especial force in the strokes with which he
drove his craft along. Of course he may also have had a desire to see again as
soon as possible Mrs. Mooloo and the little Mooloos, but Mooloo was not
sentimental.

The boys had arranged with Mooloo to keep right on with them to the little
settlement where the simple-hearted Kapje lived. For this they had a double
reason. It was nearer the coast and further south where trading vessels would
be more likely to touch, and then, too, they felt much safer with Kapje than
they did with Mooloo.

The latter had at first hesitated at the proposition, but Bobby removed his
objections by promising him double pay.

It was a long trip and a perilous one, for the sea was rough, the ice floes
were churning and grinding, and icebergs were numerous. But Mooloo seemed to
have a sixth sense that carried him through all dangers and at last they
sighted the little settlement that was their destination. They approached it
just as Kapje and his son, after a dayâs fishing and hunting, were drawing
their boat up on the shore.

The latter greeted the lads with as much emotion as Eskimos ever permit
themselves to show, and cordially invited them to make their igloo their home
as long as they chose. The boys accepted this invitation, the more readily now
because they knew that they were in a position to reward their benefactors for
all they had done for them.

It seemed almost like home again to be in the simple igloo which had so many
associations attached to it as the place where they had been welcomed to
safety after that memorable night on the icy seas.

The Eskimo woman greeted them just as warmly as had her husband and son, and
soon had set before them a steaming savory meal which they ate with the
appetites of famished wolves.

Mooloo, too, took part in the meal and stayed overnight, as it was then too
late to think of returning to his own igloo. In the morning, Bobby drew from
his pocket some gold pieces and delighted the guide by giving to him three
times what he had promised.

As he was preparing to go, a thought struck Bobby.

âThat walrus tooth!â he said to Mooloo. That token Takyak sent! Where is it?

âMooloo got it here,â replied the guide, touching his breast. âBig totem. Good
medicine. Bring luck. Mooloo keep it.â

âIt brought us luck sure enough,â Bobby thought to himself, âand Iâd like to
keep it all my life.â Aloud he said: âYou want to sell?â

Moolooâs eyes glistened.

âMebbe,â he said. âHow much?â

Bobby took out three gold pieces.

âMore,â said Mooloo.

Bobby made it five.

âMore,â said Mooloo.

Bobby shook his head and was about to put the money back in his pocket, but
Mooloo grabbed his arm.

âAll right,â he said, and the token changed hands.

The first stage of their journey had been accomplished and they had avoided
the greatest perilâthat of Moolooâs avarice. They had the books containing the
treasure tucked away under a pile of furs in Kapjeâs dwelling where they had
received only a passing glance and provoked no inquiry.

Now, however, they were faced with the great problem of how to get back home.
They were in a perfect fever of impatience. The thought of the misery their
families must be enduring was a dagger in their hearts. In the hard work and
excitement of their ship-journey and their later adventures they had been able
to keep this at bay to some extent. But now they had nothing to do but wait,
and the torment was insistent.

So it was with immense relief and rejoicing that a few days later they learned
from Kapje that a trading vessel had arrived at a little settlement a few
miles further down the coast where it expected to stay a week or so while the
captain dickered with the natives. They besieged Kapje with earnest pleas to
guide them there.

âAll right,â agreed Kapje. âI take to-morrow.â

CHAPTER XXX

HOMEWARD BOUND

The delight of the boys knew no bounds. They were up bright and early the following morning, and after warm thanks and farewells to their Eskimo hostess and her son, set off on their journey.

Before they started, Bobby, on behalf of himself and his mates, tried to force some money on Kapje, but the good fellow would have none of it.

âYou save my life,â he said simply. âEskimo not forget. Donât want money.â

And despite all their urgings, he stuck to his resolution. But the boys were not to be altogether balked, and Bobby took an opportunity when no one was looking to shove a handful of gold pieces in one of the simple utensils of the household where he knew they would not be overlooked for long.

In a little while they arrived at the seacoast settlement, where the first thing that met their sight was a medium-sized schooner riding at
anchor a little way off shore. She was a dingy and battered affair, with patched sails and bearing traces of hard usage, but to the hungry eyes of the boys she was more beautiful than the most palatial yacht that ever sailed the seas. For she meant deliverance and civilization and home.

Her skipper, with some of his crew, was on shore trading with a group of natives. He looked up in surprise as he saw approaching the group of boys who, despite their native Eskimo dress, were unquestionably Americans.

âWell, Iâll be hornswoggled!â he exclaimed, as he looked them over, âwhat have we got here? How did you youngsters ever get up in this forsaken part of the world?â

He was a tall, lanky man who had lost one eye, but the other eye had in it a kindliness and good humor that warmed the boysâ hearts at once. Here evidently was one captain who was not like Captain Garrish.

Bobby, acting as spokesman, told him a little of how they had been put on Captain Garrishâs schooner and frankly how they had left the ship because of the captainâs tyranny and had, almost by a miracle, been rescued by the natives. The captain listened with wonder, wagging his head at different points of the narrative.

âA passel oâ hot-headed youngsters,â he commented, when Bobby had finished. âYou had foolâs luck or you wouldnât have been alive to-day. And now I suppose you want me to take you home?â

âIf you only will, Captain,â Bobby pleaded. âWe have money enough to pay our fare.â

âOh, for that matter Iâd take you whether you had money or not,â replied the captain. âIâve got a kid oâ my own at home just about your size. Well, get your duds aboard just as soon as you like, though it will be two or three days before I sail. Iâve got a sort oâ storeroom that can be cleared out so that you can all bunk in it together. Of course I canât take you all the way home. I hail from Canada and my port is St. Johnâs, Newfoundland. But from there you can get a steamer thatâll take you down to the States where I bet your folks will be glad to see you.â

It would be difficult to describe the gratitude and rapture of the boys. They thanked the captain with all their hearts, and then set about getting their belongings on the schooner. At a direction from the captain, two of the crew cleared out the old storeroom sufficiently to give them room enough to bestow their goods. There were several rough bunks built along the wall,
and while the quarters were very crude they seemed to the boys like heaven.

Some days later the schooner lifted anchor and bore out to sea. It was a happy group of boys that stood on the deck and watched the shore sink below the horizon. Now they were homeward bound, and with every mile that the schooner made in the cold northern seas they were that much nearer to parents and friends and all that made life worth living.

The early days of the voyage were stormy, but the boys by this time were seasoned sailors and stood the tossing as well as the veteran members of the crew. Later the gale abated and became a following wind, before which the vessel made good time, arriving safely at St. Johnâs sooner than the skipper had expected.

With the heartiest thanks to the good-hearted captain and ample compensation for what they had cost him, the boys went with their belongings to the leading hotel of the town. Then they rushed to the nearest telegraph office and sent messages winging over the wires to their parents.

Bobby telegraphed:

âSafe and well at St. Johnâs, Newfoundland. Will be home by first steamer. Best love.

Bobby.â

The other boys sent similar messages to their parents. What joy, what rapture, those messages caused can be imagined. In a little while came the return messages, almost incoherent, almost sobbing, even over the wire, full of frantic joy and terms of endearment and thanksgiving to God.

Then a little later came telegraphic money orders, for of course the parents of the boys did not know but what they might be stranded and destitute. The money was really unnecessary, but Bobby and his friends were glad to get it just the same, for though gold is always gold and good all over the world, some of the coins were so old, and many of them foreign, as to excite curiosity and remark, and this was the thing above all that the boys wanted to avoid until they should have their treasure safe at home.

They bought new outfits, carefully stowing away the Eskimo suits which they expected to keep as precious souvenirs for the rest of their lives. Then they waited with what patience they could muster for several days before the next steamer sailed for the United States.

The trip was quickly and safely made, and in a few days the boys readied home and were folded in their parents arms.

What occurred in the Blake home was duplicated in all the others. Mrs. Blake cried. Bobby cried. Mr. Blake cried. Meena, the Swedish servant girl, cried. Michael, the Blakesâ old coachman, cried. Everybody cried. They could not help it. There are some joys so deep that only tears can express them.

When at last some semblance of sanity was restored to the household and Bobby for the twentieth time had gone over his adventures in answer to their eager questions, he learned in turn the events that had followed the disappearance of the boys. Investigation had traced them to the railroad junction where they had left their suitcases. The agent had told of their having gone to Bayport to see the circus performance. But at Bayport the clue rested for a while, until the finding of Bobbyâs and Fredâs watches in a pawnshop led to the arrest of Lemming and some of his gang on the charge of robbery.

Lemming, on being put through the âthird degree,â had wilted and confessed how the boys had been shanghaied and put on Captain Garrishâs schooner. This had relieved some of the agony of the boysâ parents as showing that the boys were probably still alive, though of course they did not know but what they had perished in the hold of starvation. Captain Garrish had not yet returned from his voyage, and the telegrams
from St. Johnâs were the first inklings that the parents had that the boys had survived their perilous adventure.

The treasure which amounted to many thousands of dollars was duly divided and placed in the bank to be at the disposal of the boys when they should reach the age of twenty-one.

A few days after their return, Bobby and Fred were together, and Bobby took from his pocket the walrus tooth that had served as a token.

âPoor old Takyak!â he murmured.

âHe was a good old scout,â said Fred.

âWonder if weâll ever have any more adventures as stirring as those up north,â mused Bobby.

âI doubt it,â replied Fred.

But many stirring adventures were still to come, and what some of them were will be related in the next volume, to be called: âBobby Blake on Mystery Mountain; or, The Treasure Chest of Black Rock.â

The boys gazed long at the token, their minds busy with the memories that thronged upon them.

âWhat would you sell it for?â asked Fred,

âNot for its weight in gold,â replied Bobby.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

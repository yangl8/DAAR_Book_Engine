BETWEEN SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS.âTO
TAKE, OR NOT TO TAKE A WIFE?

For
the majority of men, and for
at least thirty years of their lives, love
is the strongest necessity, and governs
them like a tyrant with no other curb
than the wretched brake of written
codes, which they do not read, and
of social conventionalities, which they
can easily silence by employing hypocrisyâs
mask; an hypocrisy, let it be
well understood, well dressed, well
curled, and well educated.

How can one satisfy this greatest
of all human needs?

[Pg viii]

By buying love, at so much an hour,
so much a month, or so much a year.

By gaining it by seduction or violence.

By taking a wife.

It would seem as if these three ways
of loving were totally distinct, one
from the other; in fact, that any one
would exclude the others, and that
they would stand in direct opposition
to each other. But when hypocrisy is
at the helm of the vessel which bears
us over the great sea of life, it contrives
so ably and so cleverly, as to
enable us to enjoy all three methods
at one moment, and, while we are
sailing between rocks free of danger
or shipwreck, it affords us, as it were,
all the delights of a voyage in a beautiful
archipelago, where islands and

[Pg ix]

islets seem to meet and touch each
other; and where land, mountains,
and scenery all form a bright, picturesque,
and beautiful picture.

We row upon the tranquil waters of
matrimony, and yet glide so near to
the shores of venal love that we can
grasp the flowers and gather the shells
and precious pearls which lie there.
We sail with the wind over the more
tempestuous sea of seduction, but
all the while we coast the island of
poetic, faithful, and constant love;
thus, vice, adultery, and domestic
peace, debauchery and eternal vows,
angels and beasts, find themselves
guests at the same table, without
false modesty, and without remorse.

Civilisation has opened three ways
of loving to men of the present day,

[Pg x]

and one would have thought that
since they are free to choose one,
they would have been satisfied with
that. Not at all. Civilised man is
by nature insatiable, for the hammer
of the
excelsior
beats ever at
his heart, the thirst for something
better wears him away, and the
hunger for
something more
consumes
him; hence he has set himself to
destroy the boundaries and walls
which separate the three roads, so
that he can easily take short cuts
from one to the other without risk;
and so matrimony, prostitution, and
adultery walk hand in hand; and if
in public they appear very cool to
each other, that is only a blind, for
in the secrecy of their houses they
wink at each other, sup and sleep

[Pg xi]

together. If all this is indeed so,
a Turk would say it is so because
it must be. If all this can indeed
be, an epicurean optimist would say,
let us, too, try and sail in this sea,
now so calm, and now so tempestuous,
and let us set that sanctified
hypocrisy at the helm.

However, I am neither Turk nor
cynic, and I still believe in moral
progress, and in the efficacy of books
and the spoken word; and even
though I be left alone in the belief
that there is no happiness save in
the good, nor cheerfulness save in
sincerity, and in being the same
inwardly as outwardly, I would still
die in this conviction.

I like a mixture of things at table,
but I have no heart for it in the

[Pg xii]

field of morality. I wish to see the
family on one side, and the brothel
on the other; and when two natures
living together have become an
intolerable torment to each other, I
should wish the law to apply the
instrument of divorce to their chains
and to set them free.

The three ways of loving should
be separate one from the other, and
should never be united. So far from
breaking down the walls that divide
them, I wish to have them so high
as to become impregnable fortresses.

â

Only one of these three ways,
however, is that which the honest
and happy ought to take. That of
seduction and violence, only thieves,

[Pg xiii]

assassins, and villains can enter.
The third, unfortunately, the way of
venal love, nearly all enter, though
still desiring and invoking some distant
ideal, where this way shall be
closed, and no path left free save
that of matrimony, though its dignity
must be always guaranteed by
the law of divorce.

But is marriage always possible
and always easy?

No; it is often impossible, and
always difficult.

And the honest man stops and
meditates upon it as upon the
gravest, the most intricate, and most
obscure problem of life. The misfortune
is this, that just these timid
and thoughtful men are the best,
and the fear is sometimes so great,

[Pg xiv]

and the meditation lasts so long,
that old age comes upon them
before they have resolved the problem
or made themselves a family
nest. Instead of this, the improvident,
the thoughtless, and villains
precipitate themselves headforemost
along the road of matrimony; and if
for a few moments they struggle in
the tortures of doubt, they quickly
silence apprehension and remorse by
saying to themselves:

âIf it should turn out badly, if I
find nettles and thorns on this road,
I will clear another cross-road with
one good stroke of my spade, and
will buy love like so many others,
and will, like them, seek it either
in the house of my friend or neighbor.
Immorality on this point is

[Pg xv]

so lax, the indulgence of the public
is so merciful, that I may enjoy
this violation of home without falling
under the penalty of the law. Mahomet
also, generally so severe on
all transgressions of the written law,
when he speaks of the sins of love,
even of the greatest, always adds:
â
But God is good and merciful.
â And
all think with Mahomet, though they
have not written the Koran, that to the
sins of love â
God is good and merciful.
ââ

I, however, the warmest advocate
of marriage for myself and
others, desire with all my soul that
the honest and wise man should
marry, to increase the capital of
honesty and wisdom in future generations.
And so I preach and shall
preach to my last breath:

[Pg xvi]

Marry! Marriage is still and always
will be the most honest, healthy,
and ideal mode of loving.

But I add immediately:

Marry well; combine all the powers
of your thought and feeling to solve
this most important problem of your
life; add to them all that is best in
yourself; all that you find of the best
among your counsellors who are your
friends.

And then follow the advice given
us by that embodiment of good sense,
Benjamin Franklin: Take a sheet
of paper, and after having folded it
in two, so as to have two distinct
columns, write on one side all the
advantages the proposed marriage
would bring you, and on the other
all the evils and dangers into which

[Pg xvii]

it might lead you. When you have
finished this piece of analysis work,
try to measure the opposing elements,
cancelling alternately those that seem
to balance each other, as in algebra
+ 3 and - 3 is equal to zero, and
you will see what is left upon the
pageâthat is, whether the good predominates,
or whether the evil has
the upper hand.

I know well all the mistakes you
may make. I know, too, that if you
love you will write in rose-coloured
ink in the column of good, and in
that of evil you will use the blackest.
But in any case this work of analysis,
this labour of detailed examination
will, without your being aware of
it, oblige you to consider many elements
which otherwise you would

[Pg xviii]

have passed over, just as if you had
had recourse to a microscope of great
power instead of to your eyes.

Matrimony must be studied with
the eyes first; with the microscope
after; yes, even with the telescope.
The eyes will enable us to see the
principal part of the problem; the
microscope will show all the ins and
outs of our love; it will reveal
all its cells and all its fibres; and
lastly, the telescope will give us the
power of seeing, prophetically, as it
were, what will befall our passion
and desire in the evolution of time.

Then, if, after using eyes, microscope,
and telescope, you also read
my book, you will find there the sincere
and dispassionate words of a
man who became a physician that

[Pg xix]

he might study mankind better; who
began by studying himself, as being
the subject ever at hand; who to
this daily incessant study has devoted

forty-six
large volumes not yet
printed.

Listen to the voice of a man who
has made woman his principal study,
judging her to be the better part of
humanity, and has loved her more
than all the creatures upon earth,
believing her to be the first and
greatest source of happiness. I
know perfectly that, even after having
applied Franklinâs method to the
study of the problem of matrimony,
even after having used eyes, microscope,
and telescope, and read my
book, you may yet make a mistake;
but your conscience will always be

[Pg xx]

free from any remorse, in knowing
that, as far as you were able, you
did all that was possible to secure
happiness.

Vessels are sometimes wrecked
under the command of able and
brave captains, and under the guidance
of a sure compass. But for
one of these you find a hundred
wrecks, to which there was no compass,
or an ignorant or drunken captain.

And all those who marry without
reflecting deeply and long on the
abstruse problem are drunk and
ignorant captains, who launch, without
a compass, upon the most tempestuous
sea.

[Pg 1]

THE ART OF TAKING A WIFE.

CHAPTER I.

MARRIAGE IN MODERN SOCIETY.

Of
all paradoxes man is the
cleverest and most untiring. He
says he is a worm of the earth,
but believes himself to be a son
of God; his own person he clothes
modestly, but revels in discovering
the nakedness of the greatest possible
number of his sisters in Christ.
The more he humiliates himself, the
prouder he is; the more he vaunts

[Pg 2]

his generosity, so much the more is
he egotistical; an adorer of liberty
in theory, but in practice a daily
contriver of tyrannies.

For the present I will confine
myself to this last form of his madness.
If one only listens to him, he places
liberty above all the good things of the
world. If Adam has lost the earthly
paradise, it is because he did not
know how to tolerate the yoke of
a divine prohibition; if man has
spattered his planet with blood, it
is because he preferred the hard
bread of the free citizen to the
golden chains of despotism; if he
has raised monuments to Spartacus,
Bahilla, Garibaldi, and Washington,
it is because his first glory is to
be free; but the monuments forgotten,

[Pg 3]

the tyrants killed, he raises
new ones on his own account;
perhaps for the pleasure of destroying
them hereafter. If he does not
seek some innocent and pleasant
occupation, what can he do after
having slept and loved and eaten?

Numbers
must take the first place
among the early tyrants of our own
making.

When God made the world, he
entirely forgot to make numbers, and
we have corrected this fault of creation
by making them ourselves. God
had not numbered the stars in heaven,
or the drops of water in the sea, the
leaves on the trees or the ants on the
ground. Infinity above, infinity below,
the ineffable and immeasurable everywhere.

[Pg 4]

Instead, we have repaired this great
forgetfulness of the Creator, by placing
numbers above everything else,
and making them our masters in the
world of living things and dead; we
allow them to tyrannize over us in
every act of our humble daily life,
as well as in the pages of history and
in dogmas of philosophy. If there
have been sanguinary revolutions in
order to obtain the liberty of the
press, why as yet has no one rebelled
against the tyranny of numbers?

Quien sabe?

Whoever would think of buying
eleven or thirteen eggs?

No one, for 10 and 12 are our
small tyrants.

Who would make a present of nine
or ninety-nine francs to his own son?

[Pg 5]

No one, for 10 is a great tyrant,
and 100 greater than 10.

Who has never felt the yoke of
numbers one thousand and one hundred
thousand? who is never in subjection
to the tyranny of the million,
both in language and mode of life?

And centuries, too, which are only
so many figures, what a number of
theories they have evoked from the
depths of history; how many false
names have they not written in the
anagraphs of time; how many revolutions
have they not postponed; how
many others have they aroused,
merely on account of the tyranny of
a number?

For some years we have had before
our eyes one of the most deplorably
humiliating examples of our view of

[Pg 6]

this arithmetical incubus, the decline
of the nineteenth century to make
room for the twentieth.

Six years are still wanting till this
numerical cataclysm. Who knows
how many books will be written on
the century dying out, how many
prophecies on the century following
it; what torrents of philosophy and
ink to discuss the passing of the
number 19 to that of 20?

Yet centuries only exist on paper,
and after having made them ourselves,
we adore and freely elect them
to be our tyrants; only to deride the
poor savages who, like us, make their
own gods of wood and stone, fall on
their knees before them and fear them.

And we fear numbersâonly another
idol of thought, made for our use

[Pg 7]

and necessity, and in the similitude
of our wretchedness and intellectual
weakness.

For my part I only see around me
an infinite continuity of things and of
time, nor do I allow myself to be
overawed by the cabal of numbers,
with which we ought to amuse ourselves
as with a pack of cards, esteeming
them for what they are worth; a
poor example of a thing yet poorer!

The
dying century
,
fin de siÃ¨cle
, and
all such sensational phrases, which are
intended to express a great deal, because
they mean nothingâthese exclamations,
the eloquence of the non-eloquent,
move me little, if at all. I
look back and see
a yesterday
; I look
around and see
a to-day
; forward and
I see
a to-morrow
; the three tenses

[Pg 8]

of the
to become
, which have no numbers,
nor will ever have. For they
succeed each other unceasingly, following
the mighty strides of our journey,
not with the figures of a century, but
with a
regret
that becomes a
hope
, and
will be a
faith
; to be succeeded again
and forever by
regret
,
hope
, and
faith
âunceasingly.

I wished to write this in the first
pages of my book to let you know
that if I attempt to delineate marriage
in modern society I renounce
the
dying century
, the
fin de siÃ¨cle
, and all
such effective phrases, which would
give me, based on numbers, so many
resources of rhetoric and sentimentality.
I have hated and always shall
hate all forms of tyranny, including
that of numbers. I look around and

[Pg 9]

say, this is the way men marry
to-day
.
They do so because they are sons of
a
yesterday
, which is the father of
to-day; then I look forward and hope
that to-morrow will be better than
yesterday or to-day, and I endeavour to
promote the good as quickly as possible
and with a minimum of pain, by my
pen, my experience, and my studies,

cito tute et jucunde
,
as Celsus has it.

â

In our civilized society, marriage is

the least evil
of all the different modes
of union between man and woman for
the preservation of the race. It is
the result of many historic evolutions,
many sensual, moral, religious, and
legislative elements, which have come
into conflict with each other in the
course of time.

[Pg 10]

Remote atavism of the ravishment
of the female, holy words of inspired
prophets, imperiousness of feudatories,
avarice of usurers, transports of love
and heroism of hearts, have all left
something of their own upon the altar
of matrimony. But before the sacrament
was finished and the priest sent
up the fumes of his incense, animal
man came leering and saying:

âThis is my affair. I am the sole
and true priest of this rite. I am the
only minister of this religion.â And
mixing the divine and human vows on
the altar with his hairy handsâperhaps,
too, with his tailâhe formed a chaos of
things most opposite, from the highest
to the lowest, from the most sublime
to the most ignoble. And this, then,
is marriage.

[Pg 11]

To curse this love sanctified by
vows is useless, to suppress it is impossible,
to substitute something better
is absurd (at least for the present),
and nothing remains but to accept it
as the least evil of sexual unions, and
to ameliorate it gradually, prudently,
and wisely.

By free choice on both sides, enlightened
by reason.

By the guarantee of divorce.

â

Neither the prince nor the proletariate
needs this book of mine. The
first marries worse than any citizen in
his kingdom, for dynastic reasons,
without love or sympathy. With him
it is first the throne, then the family;
first the alliance of his colours, and then

[Pg 12]

if there is room, the kisses of love.
It is true he may console himself with
the vulgar and easily won embraces of
a pandering Venus; he may also take
advantage of one of the most ridiculous
remnants of the Middle Ages, the
morganatic marriage. In all cases the
ministers, deputies, nay, even journalists
provide him with a wife. The art
of taking a wife is for him, therefore,

nonsense
.

The proletariate, more fortunate
than the prince, may choose the
woman it loves, and in its choice may
take advantage of the counsels of
those who have loved and sinned
much. But it does not read books, for
they cost too much; and when by law
its individuality is cancelled from the
statistics of the illiterate, it has no

[Pg 13]

time to read, for the tyranny of bread
oppresses it.

Therefore I write for neither prince
nor proletariate, but for all that human
multitude who live and move
between the extreme poles of modern
society and who constitute the true
nerve of the nation.

In what way do all these millions of
males and females combine?

In different ways, but amongst them
marriage is the only legal foundation
of the family permitted by morality
and approved by religion. All others
are contraband, moving on cross-roads
either alone or in company, but all, in
one way or the other, defrauding nature,
with an eternal envy for those
who have honestly paid custom dues
on entering the city.

[Pg 14]

Without fear of going far wrong,
one may say that in whatever society
there are the greatest number of married
people, there one will find more
morality and decorum, and consequently
the number of those who love
and nourish their love by seduction,
whether it be with the armed hand on
the public road, or clandestinely under
the form of domestic robbery, will be
less.

Besides this, our modern society is
suffering from
gold fever
; a disease
which is as old as man himself and has
taken the form and course of a real
epidemic; this contributes more than
any other element to corrupt the roots
of marriage.

Diffused instruction and the many
social exigencies have increased our

[Pg 15]

needs beyond measure; more especially
those which are more costly,
that is, those of the intellect and
the higher Ã¦sthetic emotions, without
in any way enlarging the sources
of production.

From birth to death, the balance
of home life oppresses us, torments
us; its arithmetic pierces through
the skin with the acute points of its
figures, reaches our very viscera and,
alas, our hearts also; poisoning every
pleasure, spoiling all the holy and
happy poetry of life. Invited as all
are to the genial table of modern
civilization which offers us so many
new delights, we are like the poor
government official, who, for appearanceâs
sake, allows himself to be carried
off to a ball, and between the

[Pg 16]

bars of music and the full glasses,
feels his pocket anxiously, wondering
how and when he will be able to
pay the score.

With what difficulty some of the
money is drawn from the poor purse
of a middle-class man! How many
pangs has it not caused before it sees
the light of day, accompanied by the
last caress of the convulsive fingers!
How unequal the comparison between
those who live on an income of one
thousand and three thousand francs!
And, from the ever increasing fever
of desires, the gnawing of all vanities,
and the vanity of the classes, how
these figures increase daily until they
reach to ten, twenty, or thirty thousand
francs!

And this is the reason that whilst

[Pg 17]

love alone should prompt to marriage,
it is nearly always the last
party in the contract, in which money
judges and directs according to the
need of it, with all the imperiousness
of one who knows himself to be
unconquerable.

Money, money, always money! It
is the first and supreme arbiter of the
greater number of marriages.

To take a wife means to become
poor, if the wife does not help to
build the new family nest; it means
to walk with open eyes into a bottomless
and dark abyss; it signifies
condemning oneâs self to the daily
torture of poverty, and to dedicate
the children yet unborn to the same
struggle.

Our dignity would demand that the

[Pg 18]

wifeâs dowry should not enter into
our choice at all. The true ideal
would be the ability to offer to our
companion riches, or, at least, a competency
with our heart and hand, so
that we could say:

âSee, beloved; all that is mine is
thine. However much I give you, I
shall always be your debtor, for you
have given me your love.â All this is
noble and grand, and every man who
is conscious of the power of his own
moral and physical manhood would
wish to say so. But how many really
can?

Exceedingly few; hardly any.

And then the young man who
would seek to love in the way of the
Lord is discouraged and renounces
marriage, in which he only sees the

[Pg 19]

door to misery or cowardice. He
renounces it frankly and forever.
Are celibates more honest, and how
far does their honesty extend?

With the most honest, virtue extends
to an unwillingness to betray
the purity of the maiden, or the faithfulness
of other menâs wives; extends
or rather descends, to making the
service of love a question of periodical
hygiene
regulated
by the rubric
of the calendar and by that most
imperative one of the lunar month.
Poor love, poor translation of the
most epic poem of life! It is as
though one were to translate Homer
into some Australian dialect!

These bachelor hygienists are
however a small minority. Others
pretend to something more and

[Pg 20]

better, and make love in the houses
of others, and live by abject and
cowardly seduction, and perhaps
usury.

This is the most sordid and cancerous
sore in our modern marriage;
this is the gangrene of our society,
which spreads an asphyxiating fetor
of domestic treachery, of moral infection,
which contaminates and
infests everything. Woe to us if
in every family the newly born
could proclaim aloud the name of
their father! How many false, living
bills of exchange would be protested,
what long faces amongst biologists
who ingeniously study the law of
heredity; what a terrible picture of
treachery and dissembling! human
and civilized society would appear

[Pg 21]

all at once like a band of false
coiners, and the womanâs womb nothing
but a mint of false money.

But the newly born can only weepâthe
first salutation to lifeâand the
wombs of women are silent, and continue
their business of false coinage.

And yet I do not blame the
woman more than the man, in this
galley of treachery, this wide-spread
and clandestine manufactory of bastards.
If man assails the woman,
and plots against her virtue, he
avails himself of the rights of life.
If society does not permit him to
take a
wife
, why should he not
share the bread of him who has too
much to eat? Do not the workmen
of Europe declare daily, that one of
the first rights is that of work? And

[Pg 22]

is not the right of loving perhaps
more sacred; the work of works;
that for which nature sacrifices the
individual, and to which it consecrates
the best of its energies? Husbands
defend these rights, we attack them.
If they are conqueredâ
tant pis
pour eux
!

And the poor wives, why should
they not brighten the ennui of the
nuptial bed with some little love
affair? Were they not bound forever
to a man they had never loved,
whom they had perhaps seen only
once? Were they not sold by their
parents, guardians, and matrons, like
merchandise? Was not their dowry
rated at the weight of a coat of
arms? and have not they also the
right to love? And all the others

[Pg 23]

who have had the good fortune to
love the man who has given them his
name, and have thrown themselves
into his arms, giving him their whole
hearts, happy to be able to transform
themselves in him and for him;
who dreamt of making marriage a
synonym of love, and who instead
found the husband in a few months
in the arms of an old love; have
not all these women the right of
vengeance? This is matrimony as
it is daily represented in the many
small theaters which we call menâs
houses.

In these theaters, however (one
must be just and not exaggerate),
there are more farces played than
comedies, more comedies than
dramas. Tragedies are rare. For

[Pg 24]

this high form of dramatic art
heroes are required, and they are
very scarce in modern society.
We have made our houses, statues,
pictures, and gardens smaller, and
have been compelled to reduce our
feelings also.

The pistol and dagger, too, figure
in the chronicles of matrimony, but
as phenomena. In the home-theater,
on the contrary, the punishment of
retaliation, the little basenesses, the
stirring of conscience, under all forms
and at all sorts of prices, are in common
use. The
mÃ©nages Ã  trois
(aye,
even four) are pretty pictures in
kind; and the hypocrisy of husbands
who will not see, because they detest
scenes, figure every day in the running
account of modern matrimony.

[Pg 25]

Live and let liveâto apply the
noble modern institution of co-operative
societies to the family; and raise
aloft the banner of the association of
forces. One for all, and all for one!

â

Infidelity and treachery are not the
only moths which corrode marriage.
We have all the domestic discords
which spring from the inequality of
the needs of intelligence, heart, and
habits of thought; we have the partisans
of the wife and those of the
husband, who quarrel amongst themselves,
complicating the problem, poisoning
the wounds, opening with every
touch the cicatrices which time and
love were so pitifully healing.

If war is an exception in matrimony,

[Pg 26]

peace is still more rare; and
one may safely say that in the greater
number of cases it is an armed peace,
an atmosphere which relaxes the
strength, dries up the purest sources
of tenderness, and destroys its happiness.
In a word, as our society is
constituted in the present day, hell
is not common in the family circle,
paradise exceedingly rare, but purgatory
is almost universal.

And yet marriage is still the
least
evil
amongst the unions of the man
and woman; it can and ought to
grow continually better and increase
human happiness; which is for me
the highest and truest end of progress.

What is the use of being able to
run through space at the velocity of
seventy kilometres an hour, or to go

[Pg 27]

round the world in seventy days;
what the use of being able to talk
through the telephone or see the
clouds in the sky of Mars; what the
use of so great a fecundity of books,
of such a deluge of journals, if one
is unable to increase the patrimony of
human happiness by even a farthing?

At the present day marriage
may
be
happy, just as one
may
become rich
by playing in the lottery, but whilst
one door opens to the possibility of
good, two open to that of evil. He
who utters the fatal
yes
before the
Syndic girded with the three national
colors, lets a grain fall in the scale
that holds our happiness and two in
the scale that holds our misfortunes.
It is his duty to do the opposite; it is
the duty of society to defend matrimony

[Pg 28]

from the perils which threaten
it, by wise laws not inspired by the
arcadian tendency of the heart, nor
by theocratical mysticism, but by
a profound knowledge of man.

â

About twenty years ago I broke a
lance in favour of divorce in my
âFisiologia
dellâ amore,â
and hoped at that
time to have seen it by now included
in the laws of my country.

Twenty years ago I wrote:

âDivorce ought to be included
among our laws as soon as possible:
happy couples solicit it to secure
their dignity, wounded by a tyrannical
tie; the unhappy implore it on
their bended knees, those who by
misfortune or fault are condemned

[Pg 29]

to the most supreme of human tortures:
that of a slavery without redemption,
of a yoke without rest, of
a scourge without balm, of a grief
without hope.â
[1]
Even to-day divorce
is not made a law among us, but public
opinion demands and will have it.
No one in the present day dare defend
it with the broken arms of the Church;
but many defend it still in the name
of the children and of the sanctity
of the family.

[1]

âFisiologia dellâ amore,â

Milano, 1873, p. 338.

There are too many innocent victims
of matrimony for their voices
not to be heard; and when the law-giver
knows how to surround divorce
with all the most delicate guarantees,
he will increase the sanctity of
the family and free the children from

[Pg 30]

the cruelly abject spectacle of their
two parents living under the same
roof hating each other, with homicide
in their thoughts, bearing the chains
of convicts, without the courage or
the strength to break them.

â

Legislators must do this, the rest
of the duty lies with those directors
of the mind who are called writers,
masters, and educators. They ought
to teach the woman to know what
love is, and what matrimony is, so
that she should not give herself,
bound hand and foot, to a contract
which she knows by hearsay only, nor
enter the dim future guided by paternal,
maternal, or religious authority
alone.

[Pg 31]

The possibilities of misfortune are
a hundred times greater for the
woman than for the man, for she is
always more ignorant of things genital
than we are, and goes to the
altar or municipality ignorant of all,
dragged like a lamb to the slaughter-house.

At the present day, under the customs
to which our society conforms,
the only profession of woman is that
of wife and mother; and to this calling
she is instructed from infancy, not
to be an exemplary wife or perfect
mother, but, if possible, to find a
husband, and that an ideal one, one
who is handsome, young, and above
all rich. She is secretly and cleverly
instructed in the art of hunting that
rare game, a good husband; not in

[Pg 32]

order to make him or herself happy,
but to increase her income and to rise
a step or two in the social scale. If
in comfortable circumstances, she must
become rich; if rich, a millionaire;
if civilian, a countess; if countess,
marchioness or princess. This is what
she is to aim at; all her education
has been directed to this end. Now,
marriage should rise from its lower
position of a business transaction to
the higher one of a union of hearts
and thoughts, and neither of the two
companions ought to be able to
look at each other with anger and
think:

You bought me.

I sold myself.

Nothing can cleanse us from this
original sin, which contaminates matrimony.

[Pg 33]

In vain do the comforts of
riches, the pride of a high position,
the excitements of domestic sensuality,
throw flowers over the wound to
hide it. At the least quibble, the least
cloud that covers the heaven of the
double life, one hears the fatal
words:

You bought me,

I sold myself,

arising from the depths of the
troubled conscience like a voice
evoked by some evil spirit.

And when neither riches, sensuality,
nor vanity have a rag
wherewith to cover the cancerous
sore, the naked and dreadful
spectre of an unsuccessful
speculation, of unsuccessful businessâthen
bitterness is added to

[Pg 34]

bitterness, and the domestic warfare
which has become permanent,
angry, and poisonous, developes into
a chronic despair, the most heart-rending
form of human pain. Even
this is not all; as in an attack
of neuralgia the deep-seated and continual
pains become sharper and more
intolerable at certain moments, taking
on a piercing and stab-like character,
so it is with the deep-seated and
dumb despair of those two unfortunate
beings. Every now and
then the inexorable cry sounds,
and thus it goes on until the last
breath.

Let divorce come then, and quickly,
to set all these slaves free; let there
be a wiser and more liberal education,
to teach girls what they do not

[Pg 35]

know or know indifferently; so that
they, like ourselves, can freely say
their
yes
before the altar or the
magistrate with perfect knowledge
and understanding.

[Pg 36]

CHAPTER II.

SEXUAL CHOICE IN MARRIAGE.âTHE ART
OF CHOOSING WELL.

There
are two principal ways by
which we may arrive at the fatal
yes
,
that terrible monosyllable which must
decide our happiness or misfortune;
that
yes
which may make for us a
paradise on earth, or a hell of twenty-four
hours for every day in the 365.

Either love first and marriage after,
or marriage first and love after.

Which of these two ways is the better,
and the most certain to lead us to the
paradise of two?

Theoretically, the answer cannot be

[Pg 37]

doubted; one ought to love first and
marry after.

In practice, however, it is not always
so. Many marriages inspired by love
end badly, while others, planned by
reason more than the heart, turn out
well.

And why? If the theory is true, it
ought to accord with the practice, and
if it contradicts the practice the theory
must be mistaken.

The apparent contradiction can be
explained at once if we reflect that
love is every day spoken of as the desire
for the possession of the woman,
and this alone is certainly not sufficient
to make two people happy. Give
love and lust their real names and
every difficulty immediately disappears,
and we then see the happy dogma,

[Pg 38]

Love first and marriage after
, shine out
in all its splendour. If by legal means
alone a man can possess the woman he
loves and if the passion be violent, the
greatest libertine, and even the enemy
of matrimony, bow their heads under
the
FurcÃ¦ CaudinÃ¦
of female virtue
and the civil code, and marry. It is a
stony road and full of pitfalls, but one
which, nevertheless, may sometimes
lead to the happiness of the two.
Gradually there becomes associated
with the desire of the senses, that
more valuable sense of the affinity of
hearts, and when the desire is satisfied
there remains still the enjoyment of
the more delicate dainties of the understanding
and affection. To transform
lust into love is a difficult work, but
worthy of womanâs holy virtue, and

[Pg 39]

the woman can succeed in doing so,
even when possession has cooled desire
and age dimmed her beauty; but she
must be a sublime being and possess
lasting gifts of sentiment and thought;
if her companion be also an elect soul,
who knows how to value this lasting
and solid virtue, and who understands
ideality of spirit as well as grace of
form, so much the better.

Sublime beings and elect souls are
always exceptional, and if, in the
innumerable crowd of husbands and
wives, they have reached the
yes
by
the way of desire of the flesh, they
soon find that the game was not
worth the candle, and that the
muddy swamp of weariness and
animal familiarity of sex follows
upon the first outburst of voluptuousness.

[Pg 40]

The woman sometimes succeeds
in fanning and reviving it
with inexhaustible coquetry, but one
gets scorched, and the distaste may
become even more obstinate the
more ingenious are the remedies
used to oppose it. A marriage
inspired only by the desires of the
flesh, maintained only by the bread
of lust, is a very poor and abject
thing, that can very rarely give
peace to the mind, and much less
happiness. Even in the most vulgar
and sensual natures, there is something
that rebels against the permanent
animal, and raises its voice in
demand for a more human form of
food. Man, like the swine, wallows
in the mud, but with this difference:
he likes to wash himself, and to

[Pg 41]

look up to the heavens from the
trough. It must be added that in
marriage the dignities of father and
mother only increase the responsibility
of the two consorts to animate
and enlarge the human nut at the
expense of the animal pulp. The
spirituality of the family impresses
itself upon the coarsest nature and
the most obtuse nerves, by warming
the atmosphere and revealing
a streak of blue in the heaven
above.

Woe to the man who, in solitary
and sad contemplation of his wife,
says to himself:
My companion is
only a female!

Much worse is it, and woe to that
woman who, in the night watches,
looking at her husband as he snores,

[Pg 42]

says in a low, fretful voice:
My
husband is only a male!

â

There is hardly a man who would
confess to his friends, or even to
himself, that he married a woman
to possess her. Even if it were
true, modesty and pride fight
against the confession, and with
one of those clever self-deceptions
with which we know how to embellish
and deceive our own consciences,
we exclaim in a decided and convinced
tone,
I love her!

If it be so difficult a thing to distinguish
between gold and its alloy,
true and false diamonds, eastern and
Roman pearls, imagine whether it is
easy to distinguish between the desire

[Pg 43]

of the flesh and true love. Yet this
is just one of those most dangerous
and hidden pitfalls which bring death
to happiness in the battle waged in
our minds between the to be or not
to be, when we have to decide whether
or no we ought to give the holy
name of wife to the woman we desire.
In other books of mine I have ventured
to give some advice to those
aspiring to matrimony to enable them
to distinguish between true love and
carnal excitement, which only affects
one organ.

As I believe, however, that we
have here before our eyes one of
the gravest and most vital questions
in the art of taking a wife, I may
be allowed to enter more minutely
into particulars.

[Pg 44]

Always doubt a sudden impression,
so called a
coup de foudre
, if it has
seized you after long abstinence from
womanâs society.

â

For love also, and perhaps more
for love than for the brain, it is
prudent to remember the fasting
Philip.

â

If you fear being enamoured of
a young girl and are not disposed
toward marriage, go and see all the
married and young ladies most famed
for beauty, grace, and elegance, and
make your comparisons. If they be
unfavourable to her, doubt directly the

[Pg 45]

seriousness and depth of your passion.

This has to do only with what we
call physical love, but I speak of it
at some length as it is the first door
opened when a man and woman see
each other for the first time. But
I do not mean that it is the only
one which leads you to the fatal
yes
.
It ought only to give you an entrance
into the ante-chamber where you must
wait patiently until heart and mind
open the doors of the inner rooms,
where you will have to live all your
life.

If there has been no
coup de foudre
,
but the sympathy came gradually,
developed and grew until it became
a real passion, then all my counsels
of examination and experiment will

[Pg 46]

be perfectly useless. At each visit
you unconsciously, and without thinking
of it at all, correct or confirm
the first impressionânow trimming,
now increasing the warmth of the
original sympathy. How many wooings,
how many marriages have miscarried
in our fancy without our
knowing a word of it, or even having
spoken an affectionate word to the
person who awakened so sudden and
strong an impression in us! A being
suddenly appeared on the horizon,
perhaps in an hour in which we felt
the weight of solitude, the tortures
of abstinence, and we said to ourselves
directly: What a charming and
sweet creature! Why do I not take
her for mine ... and forever?

The apparition passed from our

[Pg 47]

gaze, but we carried it home with us
carved, or rather written, on our minds
in fire. We saw her between the lines
of the book we read, in our dreams,
everywhere.

A few days later we see her in the
street, or in society, and we vainly
endeavor to reconcile the reality with
the figure we saw in our imagination.
The discord is complete. The woman
is not the same, and smiling to ourselves
over the love which we had
dreamt of in the silence of our minds,
we exclaim, âHow could I ever
have admired this vulgar, ugly, faded
creature and wished to have her
for my own!â

It is well, indeed, when the sketch
can be corrected so soon; unfortunately
it sometimes occurs after

[Pg 48]

several visits, when we may have
compromised our heart and perhaps
our word.

Prudence, then,
adelante Pedro con
juicio!

â

Science teaches that no force in the
world is lost, no energy consumed,
but that force and energy transform
themselves one into the other without
loss at all. Then I ask myselfâbut
all the desires that men and women
breathe out in the streets, in society,
in theatres, or wherever they meet,
where do they end? All those glances
of the eyes which carry fire enough in
their rays to burn and consume the
whole planetary system; all those
heart beatings which make the face

[Pg 49]

burn and attract two beings, two organisms,
two lives to each other; when
(as in most cases) they pass like meteors
without fructifying the earth, where do
they go? Those terrible energies, the
fruit of the most intricate and sublime
mechanism of our brains and nerves;
into what do they transport themselves
when they produce neither
words, tears, lust, crime, matrimony,
nor sin?

And yet these desires are many;
they meet day and night in the crowded
streets, in the whirl of railway carriages,
in the dense crowd, in the solitary
mountain paths; they plough
through space, and if we were able
to see them we should see the air
lighted up by them as by the convulsive
lightning of a tropical tempest.

[Pg 50]

But where do they go? Where is
so much light consumed? Who warms
himself with all this mighty heat?
And where are the ashes of such a fire?

I know not; perhaps biologists and
physicists of the future will tell us.

â

Another elementary, but most important
aid toward the wise choice
of a wife, is to see a large number of
women before choosing her to whom
you wish to give name, heart, and life.

If you have chosen your companion
in the narrow circle of a village without
leaving it, you may be proud to
have gained the prettiest girl among
a dozen companions. But woe to you,
should you suddenly go to other villages,
or still worse to some large

[Pg 51]

city; you may find the comparison
odious, most odious, and yet irremediable.

This is why men who have seen and
travelled a great deal generally make
the best husbands; for making their
choice on a larger basis, there is
great probability of their choosing
well, and perhaps also for another
reason, women more easily pardon
some former gallantry in their fiancÃ©s
than a too ingenuous virtue. Don
Giovanni has always seemed more
pleasing to them than the chaste
Joseph.

A woman who knows that she is
preferred and chosen as a companion,
by one who has seen and known a
hundred or a thousand other women,
is proud of it, and with reason.

[Pg 52]

I do not know if all women will
share my opinion, but those who know
most of the science of love will most
certainly think with me. Were I a
woman, my ideal of a husband would
be a man who had travelled in all
the six parts of the world, and had
seen and admired all the women
there.

And continuing my Utopia, but
bringing it down to the level of earth;
were I a woman and had I doubts
about the sincerity of the passion
awakened in my fiancÃ©, I should wish
him to make a journey through all
Europe which should last a year, and
if on his return he still found me
worthy of him, I would give him my
hand with the certainty of having a
loving and faithful husband.

[Pg 53]

Time is a valuable element to add
weight to our choice; it is one of the
best gauges of comparison by which to
distinguish true love from carnal excitement.
It is an old axiom, confirmed
by universal experience, that
time cools and extinguishes the small
attacks of love, but strengthens and
invigorates the more serious ones.
The fatal brevity of our lives, the
natural impatience of all those in love,
conspire together to hasten marriage,
but as far as I know and am able, I
recommend men and women to acquire
the sainted virtue of patience.
I pray women again and again in
their love affairs (in which as people
say they are more
men
than we are),
to follow the tactics of Fabius the
temporizer: wait, wait, and still

[Pg 54]

wait. Love is centred in a most
serious moment, one most pregnant
with consequences to our whole lives,
and a month or two more will only
increase the dignity of the choice, and
be a guarantee for the future. The
honeymoon will shine all the longer
above our horizon, the more we wait
for it, with the poetry of desire and the
ideality of hope.

[Pg 55]

CHAPTER III.

AGE AND HEALTH.

If
a man were only a generating
animal, the problem of age in marriage
would be very simple, and
reducible to this formula: That as
long as men or women can relight
the flame of life they are
marriageable
.

That means that a man may
marry from sixteen to sixty, and in
exceptional cases up to seventy and
eighty; and that he may marry a
woman of from fifteen to forty-five.

Man, however, is not solely a

[Pg 56]

generating animal, but a thinking,
reasoning, sentient, cavilling, wrangling
being; a political, commercial,
and religious creature; he manufactures
brakes to curb the exhilaration
of the gallop downhill, creates
sophisms to spoil truth, and crutches
to make athletes rickety; he tells
many lies for amusement; in short
he is the most clever and ingenious
artificer in things of which he knows
very little, in the whole planetary
universe. Notwithstanding all these
precious virtues, man finds the problem
of age most complicated, when
he wishes to take one of the
daughters of Eve and say to her:
â
Will you give me your hand, so
that we may form a little future
for ourselves?
â

[Pg 57]

All other elements being favourable,
the ideal perfection in age as
regards marriage would be as follows:

The man to be from twenty-five
to thirty-five.

The woman from eighteen to
twenty-five.

The man should always be a few
years older than the woman, that is
from five to ten years older, and
this for many reasons. Man grows
older more slowly than woman, and
keeps his power of reproduction
longer.

Before twenty-five or thirty years
of age a man, unless he be a born
libertine, knows comparatively little
of the world of woman, and that
only the worst, and in his choice

[Pg 58]

of a wife may make a terrible mistake.

Then, also, the products of a too
early union are weak and inferior;
the statistics of all countries
show that there are more deaths
among children of young parents
than of older, or if they live, they
are more weakly.

In the most simple problems of
marriage, as in the most complex
and metaphysical, it is always better
to remember the fundamental doctrine,
that harmony and happiness
are founded on the agreement of
two very different instruments, which
ought always to accord with each
other. We should pay attention, then,
to false notes! If in an orchestra
two instruments do not strike the

[Pg 59]

right notes, or if one goes too fast
and the other too slow, it is a very
small matter, and ends in a grimace
upon the brow of the few who understand
music.

But in marriage the slight discord
is a wound in the heart of two
beings, who had joined hands for a
happy life; and there is always a
cicatrix left, which, like the wounds
of veterans, acts as a barometer to
the least change of temperature, of
moisture, or of an atmosphere charged
with electricity. The restless hand
seeks to stop the sharp irritation,
and lacerates the cicatrix, changing
it to a chronic sore, which is always
painful, but never healed.

Oh, men! oh, women, study counterpoint,
the harmony and melody

[Pg 60]

of the heart, body, and soul, day and
night, if you wish to gather the
blessed and perfumed rose of married
happiness, in the garden of life.

â

Beyond the ideal perfection of
number represented by the beautiful
figure of two flowering and fragrant
young lives, you may have all these
possible combinations, which, with a

crescendo
of perils and accidents, render
the accordance of hearts and
bodies always more difficult:

Two beings equally mature in age.

Two old people.

A mature or old man and a young
woman.

A young man and a middle-aged
or old woman.

[Pg 61]

We see all these combinations pass
daily beyond our eyes, paired according
to one or the other of these arithmetical
formulÃ¦âformulÃ¦ in which
numbers weigh and govern human
happiness with so tremendous an
influence.

Let us study them one by one.

â

Man adultâwoman adult
:

This is one of the most favorable
combinations, the freest from danger
and painful discovery. If it be true
that for this combination there is
rarer access to the Olympus of ardent
love, it is also true that shipwreck
and cataclysm are rarer also. The
navigation is nearly always on a

[Pg 62]

tranquil lake, in a
safe
boat, under
the guidance of that best of helmsmen,
good sense.

The majority of such cases consists
of old attachments interrupted by
unsurmountable obstacles, favoured
again by some fortunate circumstance.
The two who had loved
and hoped for each other in their
youth, find themselves free and
their own masters, and all at once,
at a single glance, have called up
from the depths a bright panorama
of fond visions, which for some
time seemed to have disappeared in
that abyss which buries and consumes
all.

Do you remember, dear?

Yes, indeed I do!
I seem to see
you still at your window on that

[Pg 63]

Sunday, when, after looking at me
so long, you threw me a kiss across
the street, when I believed I was
hidden by the convolvulus on my
balcony.

Ah, yes, yes; that kiss was the
beginning of a long idyl which I
seem to see rising from the mists
of the past as though by enchantmentââââ

And from remembrance to remembrance
a living and speaking world
appears before those two once more,
but more beautiful and more rose-coloured
in semblance than it was in
reality; enlarged by fancy, the first
of artists, gilded by distant reminiscence,
which is ever optimist.

The old couple have some wrinkles
on their faces and some threads of

[Pg 64]

silver in their hair, but they see
each other as they were twenty
years ago; and if desires are indolent,
and the clasp of the hands does
not set the heart beating; if at night
ardent dreams no longer disturb the
peace of the passions, an odour of
loving friendship surrounds them and
binds them closer to each other day
by day, and grows hourly more like
love and less like friendship. They
have so many remembrances in common.
They have twenty years of
life to recount to each other, and
relating the sad and joyful events
they alternately recount their recollections
as though they had in reality
lived together all the while, so that
mine becomes thine and then ours,
and without declaration or trepidation

[Pg 65]

the happy day arrives when, without
any necessity of finishing the
phrase or dotting the
i
, the two
right hands find themselves clasped
together, the lips join between a
sigh that questions and one that
answers:

Really you wishââââ?

And why not?

And the
why not
becomes
because I
do
on the morrow, and the man and
woman become husband and wife;
and almost without agitation, without
accident, they reach in safety
the port of sure and tranquil happiness.

I recall two such marriages with
emotion, those of Stuart Mill and
Hillebrandt.

To these serene and tranquil unions

[Pg 66]

children are not necessary, but if
they come they brighten and bless
the house, bringing with them a
nosegay of flowers and an odour of
spring which makes those two happy
mortals young once more.

â

Two old people.

Add some ten years to the arithmetical
combination just studied and
you will have a lower temperature,
but still less danger to the happiness
of the two beings who, defying
ridicule and prejudice, wish to consecrate
an old friendship upon the

altar
of matrimony.

I do not say altar as a matter of
phraseology, nor to do homage to
the religious ceremony of marriage,

[Pg 67]

but because I am deeply convinced
that if there be nothing beyond the
union of bodies or association of
capital marriage is a sacrilege. The
troth of two should always be
plighted on an altar, whether it
be that of Christ or of some ideal,
of Moses or Mahomet, of poetry or
religion.

Old people only marry once, either
to win legitimacy for an old contraband
love, or to give a legal status
to the children. They are marriages
of reparation, corrections of proof-sheets
set aside for many years and
forgotten. They merit our approbation
and belong to those good actions
of which Christ speaks, which, if
done at the last hour, make death less
hard and allow us to die at peace

[Pg 68]

and at rest with the faith, which
illuminates our souls and prepares
us to start in the train that bears
us to eternal silence, or to the
golden gates of the Christian paradise.

In the marriage of two old people
who love each other, love is no intoxicating
flower, but a friendship
slightly gilded by sexual sympathy,
which endures longer than the reproductive
function even as it precedes it.

â

A middle-aged man and a young
woman
: If theory, hygiene, logical
concords, and compacts proclaim the
truthâwhich has all the force of a
dogmaâthat an old man ought not to
marry a young woman, daily practice

[Pg 69]

shows us that all these combinations
are possible:

40 â + 20 â

50 â + 18 â

60 â + 30 â

60 â + 15 â

70 â + 30 â

70 â + 20 â

80 â + 40 â

80 â + 30 â

80 â + 15 or 18 â

All formulÃ¦, cold and precise as the
numbers that make them up, but full
of a terrible crescendo of precipices
and cataclysms! They arouse before us
the phantom of a perfect pandemonium,
and show us the horrors of a
hell more dreadful than that of Dante.

How many tears, how much blood,
bathe the path which divides those

[Pg 70]

figures! What deep and hidden hatred,
how much revenge premeditated during
the night and put into practice in the
clear light of day; how many deceptions
planned with the cruelty of art;
what repentance, crimes, intrigues, bitterness
of soul; how many tortures
and struggles are written between those
silent and lifeless figures? Yet, still,
you will find the rarest, most complete,
and perfect happiness lying close to
this hell, like an oasis in the midst of a
desert.

For example, there are marriages of
which the formula is 60 + 30, and even
50 + 18, that are real Edens of delight,
where neither the most lovely and
fragrant flowers of spring-time, nor the
sweet tendernesses of voluptuousness,
illimitable prospects, painless sighs,

[Pg 71]

conversation without words, nor all
indescribable delights, are wanting;
and where you have also the charm
that belongs to difficulty, and all the
fascination which surrounds things
sacred.

But why among these mute and
dead numbers do we find the extremes
of human misery and blessedness?
Why do we see the most noble sacrifices
and meannesses, the most ignoble
baseness and the highest
ideality, bound together, with a cruel
irony, by a malignant fate; why do
we see angels and demons dancing
together as though enchanted by
some fantastic waltz?

For a very simple reason.

Because the happiness of marriage
between an old man and a young

[Pg 72]

woman is nothing but an unstable
and difficult balance granted to few.
But to those who are capable of
feeling it, it brings the sublime giddiness
of the great heights. Everyone
walks, but few take the leap
to death. All climb the hills; exceedingly
few have stood on the top of
Mont Blanc. But those who do not
break their necks, nor fall into the
crevasses, experience, as they mount
the highest and most difficult summit
of the Alps, strong and fascinating
emotions which make them proud and
glad. All problems of life, whether
great or small or indifferent, always
have this dilemma hidden within them:

To dare or not to dare.

The Rubicon is either an historical
fact, a myth, or a romance.

[Pg 73]

I leave it to historians to decide;
but every practical problem of happiness
has its rubicon, at which the
whole world pauses.

Some turn back.

Some leap over it.

The most of them remain still on
the bank all their lives, looking at
the other side and scratching their
heads. After forty years of age
bachelors or widows stand before
the rubicon of marriage and
say:

Shall I go over or not?

The larger number wait so long to
decide that the forty years become
fifty and then sixty. The limbs
become weaker and the river grows
wider by the inundations and floods
of so many autumns, and thus the

[Pg 74]

problem is resolved by want of resolution.

Others instead, after a short and
earnest meditation, exclaim:

No, I will not leap it.

And both do well, because although
the calculation of probabilities is
rarely applicable to moral problems,
yet it proves that the combination
of an old man and a young woman
is a very frail one; at the least shock
it is separated, as with fulminant mercury,
chloride of azote, and all the
infinite array of explosives; then
comes a detonation, a disaster, more
often a putrid and fetid dissolution.

Some do not scratch their heads,
but decide resolutely on the great
step and leap.

A difficult and perilous leap in

[Pg 75]

which but few reach the other side
unscathed. The majority of these
intrepid individuals fall into the middle
of the stream, which carries them
away in its turbid and rough waters;
others plunge directly into the mud up
to the body and are fixed there, without
being able to get out, a ridicule
to others, a desperation to themselves.

â

In that garden of Gethsemane,
where all men drink of the cup of
doubt, in that garden of perplexity
which we ought to leave with a
yes

or
no
and turn to the right or left,
knowing that one path leads to happiness,
the other to desperation, without
knowing, however, which of the

[Pg 76]

two ways leads whither; in that
garden, I say, my little book ought
to serve as a guide to resolve one
of the most difficult problems of
marriage.

And I, who have arrogated to
myself this right of counsel, will tell
with a loud voice those who do
care for my advice, my fundamental
and organic precept on which all the
other minor points must rest.

Marriage between an old man and
a young woman may lead to happiness,
if inspired on both sides by
love.

Less surely will it lead to the
same end if the love that leads them
to the altar is all on one side.

It nearly always leads to unhappiness
and ruin if the man is induced

[Pg 77]

by sensuality, or the woman by the
desire of riches or by ambition.

And as this third case is the most
common, I will explain at once why
those terrible arithmetical combinations
are so fruitful in domestic
misery, adultery, and let us say
crime, including those which the
code does not regard.

â

At this point I see a malicious
reader smiling, and hear him say that
I ought to be classed among those
madmen and deceivers who think
they have solved the problem of
squaring the circle or of perpetual
motion.

You tell me a marriage between
an old man and a young woman may

[Pg 78]

be happy, provided there be love on
both sides. But this is an impudent
joke. You may assure me with equal
seriousness that I can catch a sparrow
if I put salt upon its tail. How,
when, and where can a young woman,
fragrant of spring, who seeks with
eyes, mouth, nostrils, with all senses,
the pollen which will fructify her and
make her a mother; how can she
desire or love a man who is already
on the decline of life and can offer
his companion nothing but lasciviousness
framed by rheumatism, catarrh,
dyspepsia, and cough?

No, malicious reader, I do not
joke; neither have I endeavoured to
solve insoluble problems. I sincerely
believe a young woman can love an
old man, but he must still be a man

[Pg 79]

and handsome; for robust, flourishing,
and cheerful old age has a
beauty of its own, and if much is
wanting it has the greatest resources
and a certain delicate virtue, too,
which a young man does not possess.

Love, too, has so many and such
different forms, and is composed of
so many different elements, that it
can vibrate and burn even in the
gray-headed.

The last love of Goethe speaks of
all these; and the many warm and
enduring passions awakened in
young women by men eminent in
politics, arts, letters, and science join
in the chorus.

If in these loves the ardour of the
senses failsâand it must failâwe

[Pg 80]

find much veneration, tenderness, and
often a sweet compassion, a sentiment
that always predominates in the
female breast.

Young men are often bad husbands
because they assume too much; they
pretend that love should be laid at
their feet, as a tribute due to their
beauty and transcendent vigour.
They claim that they have the right
to be loved for themselves, even
when they on their side fulfil none
of their duties.

The old man, on the contrary, feels
his own weakness and implores love
as a favour, and responds to it with
a warm and inexhaustible gratitude
every hour and every minute. He
knows that little is due to him, and
contents himself with a smile, a kiss,

[Pg 81]

or a caress, which he doubles and
centriples with his unfailing gratitude.
He guards his love as a treasure,
which may be taken from him
from one moment to another; he
defends it with all his strength, encloses
it in a tabernacle, and adores
it as a god. His companion, therefore,
has always the peaceful surety
that she will not be betrayed by
other women.

â

That these unions may be blessed
by happiness, the husband and wife,
above all things, must be
gentle-people
;
that is persons of honour,
who frankly accept the compact
sworn to, without reticence or subterfuge.

[Pg 82]

Before the old man utters the tremendous

yes
he ought to present
his account, even increasing the
credit and diminishing the debit;
explain himself clearly and dot
every
i
. Therefore I entreat you
when you make your
fiancÃ©e
acquainted
with your financial position,
be careful that each
i
has its dot,
aye, even two.

â

Such marriages as we are studying
are far more frequent than we
should at first suppose, and the
fortunate cases are also less rare
than the theory would lead us to
believe; because women are far
greater idealists in love than we
are, and whilst we chiefly seek

[Pg 83]

beauty and carnal gratification, they
seek other things of a superior
order, which they appease with the
heart of the artist, and the phantasy
of the poet. The love of a man
for an illustrious but ugly woman
is a phenomenon rarer than a white
fly. The love of a young woman
for a great, but gray-headed man
is tolerably common, and is sufficient
to do honour to the female sex.

But a man of mature age has
other things besides to offer a young
woman: riches, a high social position,
many ambitions he can satisfy; and
he has a whole world of high, good,
and pleasant things to lay at the
foot of the woman, and can say to
her: All this for a little love!

I, of course, understand that these

[Pg 84]

are international exchanges, which are
far removed from love, and approach
more nearly to commerce; but the
sacred books have often used the
words
carnal commerce
without blushing,
and why can there not be a
little commerce in matrimony? Provided
the balance does not incline
too much to one side, and there is
no deceitâin a word provided the
one who weighs be a gentlemanâsuch
marriages may be happy, too.

â

When a man marries a woman
very much younger than himself,
people smile maliciously and point
their fingers as if to ward off the
evil eye, and to show the daring
individual that the
Minotaur
awaits

[Pg 85]

him. In this case the populace cuts
not one, but a hundred gordian
knots with a brutal and bestial
sword.

Adultery is a plant that grows in
every clime, but more especially
where a woman fails in esteem for
her companion, and the clever sower
and cultivator of these plants is
always the husband.

I am so convinced of this truth,
that if statistics of adultery were
possible, I am certain I should find
the greatest number amongst the
unions of young people: for they
also make contracts of buying and
selling, of exchange of titles and
dollars, in their marriages.

If you, with your white hairs,
have the courage to marry a young

[Pg 86]

woman, study her character most of
all. If she be a thorough lady in
education she will be less likely to
betray you than if you were young;
for she is proud of herself and
would not willingly commit a sin
toward which the world would be
so indulgent; for women also like
difficult things, heroic undertakings;
because they like to say in their
own hearts or throw in the face of
their seducer the sublime motto:

noblesse oblige
.

â

Then in conclusion:

If, with your white hairs, you have
the courage to bind your life to
blond or brown tresses fragrant with
youthfulness, place yourself naked

[Pg 87]

before the mirror in your chamber
and look at yourself for some time.
Then for a longer time put yourself
before that other mirror of conscience
which reflects us so inexorably;
and, having balanced the accounts of
your physical
I
and your moral and
intellectual
me
, see if you are still
a possible man, a handsome and
strong man; and if you find yourself
a young woman who is more an angel
than a woman, more woman than
female, offer her your hand without
too many scruples or false reticences,
and who knows but that when you
die, you may then be able to say:
âThe last years of my life have
been my happiest. In my youth I
knew a hundred women, in my old
age I have only known one; and

[Pg 88]

she alone was worth the other hundred.
Woman is the benediction
of
life
.â

â

A young man and old woman
:

Amongst the discordances of age
between husband and wife, none
astonish us so much, or I ought to
say disgust us more, than when an
old woman marries a young man.

There is the kernel of a great
truth at the root of this scorn, which
springs from the very heart of
nature.

A man may be a man even at
eighty years of age; and I cannot
resist smiling when I remember a
lady who complained of the exactions
of her companion, a man over

[Pg 89]

seventy. We all remember Fontenelle
and the Duke of Richelieu, in
whom virility was only extinguished
with life: in the first case the life
lasting for a century, in the second
for more than eighty years.

A woman, on the contrary, after
forty-five, or at the most after fifty
years of age, is no longer a woman,
and the reproductive faculty is
entirely destroyed. Hence the marriage
of a young man and old woman
is more contrary to the laws of
nature than that of an old man and
a young woman. The one may be
fruitful, the other never. Add to
the Ã¦sthetic exigencies of the man
the rapid decadence of the woman
after the change of life, and you will
understand that the union we are

[Pg 90]

discussing is one of the most repugnant
and repulsive. The motives
which bring such a man and such a
woman together are nearly always
the most abject, and amongst those
that offend the moral sense the
most. On one side carnal gratification;
on the other the thirst for
gold; hence, prostitution on the part
of the man, the most filthy and disgusting
in the commerce of love.
The man sells his youth, his virility,
in exchange for money; and the
woman who no longer has a right
to love, buys it as a merchandise,
and is satisfied with the voluptuousness
given her by one whom she
ought to be the first to despise! A
market of lasciviousness and vileness,
gold gathered from the mudâa mud,

[Pg 91]

however, which cannot be washed off,
and which soils hand, conscience,
everything it touches.

However, for the honour of humanity,
such unions are exceedingly
rare: those who buy and sell and are
satisfied with a clandestine concubinage,
hide the sin in the deep folds
of our modern hypocrisy.

Maintained, yes; a husband, no!

A woman, on the contrary, always
desires marriage, because she has the
pride of proclaiming to all the world,
that, notwithstanding her many years
and innumerable wrinkles, the wreck
of her form which assails her on all
sides, she has known how to find a
companion at bed and board, who
makes her happy.

Man, on the contrary, hides himself

[Pg 92]

on account of the modesty which is
never wanting, even in the vilest delinquents;
and hiding his shame in the
darkness of a clandestine concubinage,
hopes to preserve the esteem of men,
and the gold he has gained with
that reddened face of his. I will persist
no longer on this theme because I
hope that no young husbands of old
women will ever read my bookâthey
would soil it too much with their
filthy handsâand because I have a
great hope that they are all illiterate.

â

However, before leaving this lurid
argument, I ought to say, for the love
of truth, that ancient and modern history
register some exceedingly rare
cases of union between old women and

[Pg 93]

young men, in which neither the desires
of the flesh nor the thirst for
gold entered at all; they treat of intellectual
unions in which the concord
of souls, the sympathy of hearts and
thoughts, the harmony of taste, the
affinity of humane propositions, most
charmingly unite two persons whom
the difference in age would generally
divide.

Love is the greatest and most powerful
worker of miracles, it is the thaumaturgus
of thaumaturgists, and I in
the small circle of my experiences
know a young man, who has never
been able to desire or love a young
woman, but adores old women; and if
he does not marry any of his venerable
friends, it is from fear of ridicule. It
is true that in this case we treat of an

[Pg 94]

aberration of sexual instinct to be
classed with sodomy and incest; but
this
pathological nomad
is seated in
an otherwise normal and perfect
brain.

Intellectual unions on the other
hand are physiological facts which
offend no rights of nature, and ought
to be respected and studied, as rare,
but most noble phenomena of the
human heart.

With regard to the health of those
desiring to take a wife, and the health
of our companion, I will recommend
to them my
Elementi dâigiene
, and
more especially
Igiene dâamore
, where
I have fully treated this vital side of
the great problem.

[Pg 95]

CHAPTER IV.

PHYSICAL SYMPATHIES.âRACE AND
NATIONALITY.

Love
is the strongest, the most
irresistible, the most fatal of chemical
affinities, and if potassium can extract
oxygen from water, unite with it,
light it, and make it burn with a
bright flame and conflagration, consider
the case of a man who first
sees a woman and feels that she is
precisely the atom with whom it is
his irresistible destiny to unite, in
order to kindle the flame of life.

It is no longer a simple electro-negative
molecule which seeks, absorbs,

[Pg 96]

and consumes the opposite
electro-positive molecule, but it is an
organism, an entire microcosm, which
attracts another microcosm on its
own vortex, so as to live united in
the heaven of life, as two stars above
live united in a mysterious and eternal
marriage.

There are all the cellules of the
epidermis, and all the pores of the
skin, which seek the cellules and
pores of the other organism; there
are the inward parts which palpitate,
the nerves which vibrate, the feelings
which weep and sob, the thoughts
that are crowded with all the soulâs
expression, and seek those inner
parts, nerves, affections, and thoughts,
which nature has made kin.

Not unjustly was the moment given

[Pg 97]

that applicable French name,
Coup
de foudre
.

Lightning it isâthat gigantic force
which draws man and woman together
and makes of them one being.
In its minor grades we call the force
sympathy; a little later, when stronger,
we call it love.

â

I detest pedantic preachers of prudence,
who make it consist of an
emasculation of all virility of body
and thought; but I also appreciate
the need of repeating to you:

Distrust the flashes of lightning!

Perhaps you will say to me: âThat
is the same as preaching the doctrine:
do not believe in hunger, thirst, or
sleep.â

[Pg 98]

Flashes of lightning are apparently
all alike, but they are substantially
different, one from the other. Some
are harmlessâgive a great light,
deafen one with the rumbling of
thunder, and there they end. They
are momentary eruptions of the
senses, and nothing more. But there
are others that burn, and cleave
asunder all that they find in their
way. From these no lightning conductor
can save us. Either one is
dead or is struck by lightning, which
is the same as saying, electrified from
head to foot by that force, which has
emanated from another body which
perhaps needs ours, and which perhaps
we need ourselves.

Reason on it if you will, attempt
to destroy the new passion in the

[Pg 99]

crucible of analysis. You belong to
another; that other belongs to you,
if, as often happens, the lightning
flash has been reciprocal.

â

The galvanization of love also occurs
in another way, not, that is to
say, by fulmination, but by small and
slow currents which emit no sparks,
but have continuous emanation.

First, a slight sympathy which
touches the skin; then a deeper irritation
like a tremor invades the muscles,
nerves, and viscera through the
epidermis, and descends until it finds
something living; stopping at the
marrow of the bones, since there is
nothing left to electrify.

[Pg 100]

Theoretically, this second mode of
becoming enamoured ought to be
more tenacious and more durable
than the first, from the axiom that
intensity is equal to extension; but
practically we see a man and woman
reach the same state either by fulmination
or by a continuous current.
It is only a question of time, whether
we travel by express or slow trains;
we reach the same station in safety
at last! Love is so skilful and
powerful a magician that he makes
us his prisoners more than once in
two different ways. First he strikes
us, then he electrifies us slowly, and
there is no human or divine power
which can cure us of our passion.
We are no longer individuals, we are
things; we are the
perinde ac
cadaver

[Pg 101]

of the Jesuits, a member of which
has conquered us.

â

The admirable laws of chemical
affinity are well known to us, and
we can follow the kindred and repellent
atoms which group themselves
under the exact law of numbers.
But those other laws which
repel and attract human hearts and
bodies are, on the contrary, scarcely
divined by one who has eyes to read
the great book of psychology, where
the letters are so minute, the writing
mysterious, and even the numbering
of the pages incorrect.

Sympathy should be first physical,
then moral, and lastly intellectual,

[Pg 102]

following the highroad which leads
from the less to the greater, from that
which is external to that which is
internal.

Everyone knowsâeven the boccali
of Montelupo
[2]

knowâthat opposite
types seek and love each other.
The blond attracts the brown, and

vice versa
; slight, small women please
giants and athletes; delicate natures
attract bears, and so on. But there
are other occult and mysterious sympathies,
where it is not a case of a

[Pg 103]

combination of opposites, and where
yet the attraction is exceedingly
great and irresistible. How often
has it been a wonder to us to see
an ugly woman adored by a very
handsome man, and an ugly man
ardently sought after by women, and
having witnessed this strange antithesis
we begin at once to speculate
what impure explanation, what vile
or illicit trading with money or lasciviousness
can account for it, while
really it is a simple fact of elective
affinity, the reasons for which escape
us from our ignorance and short-sightedness.

[2]

Montelupo, a village on the Arno, is still renowned
for its crockery and terracotta. It is highly probable
that in the feudal times the mugs and drinking cups,
which are called âboccaliâ even to the present time,
were made there; they were exported in large quantities
and became so plentiful throughout Tuscany that
when any news was widespread, it was said to be
known even by the Boccali of Montelupo. Hence the
proverb.

Look around you, and in the small
circle of your own acquaintance you
will find several such singular and
extraordinary facts. For my part I

[Pg 104]

have under my eyes a young man,
the perfection of a man, aristocratic
as regards birth, mind, and income,
who, indifferent to the sympathies
awakened in women at his every
step, is completely absorbed in a
woman who is hardly feminine, neither
handsome nor young, and to thousands
of others indifferent or contemptible.

I see another young man desperately
in love with the ruins of a
woman, where not even the compassionate
ivy of coquetry covers the
decay and deficiencies, and in whom
there is a complete wreck of all
delicacy of outline. He loved her
so much that after many years he
made her his wife, without any considerations
of money.

[Pg 105]

It matters very little to your happiness
or marriage whether lightning
or inducted current has electrified
you, but sympathy ought to exist
between the man and the woman.
For charityâs sake, for the love of
God, do not forget this; do not believe
in the common proverb, which
has made so many victims:
Marry
if all considerations of income and
of age agree. Love will come after.

No! love will not come after, except
by chance, and in exceedingly
rare cases. There will come to you,
on the contrary, reciprocal antipathy,
adultery, a lie in the very surname
of your children; there will come all
those lively intrigues through which
our fine and virtuous modern society
moves. If, in the first choice of love,

[Pg 106]

the man and woman do not approach
each other with a tremor of holy
fear; if their hands do not meet each
other intoxicated with the touch; if
the first kiss be not a passion, the
first embrace a delirium, renounce
forever the sweet and fond blessedness
of the dual life.

â

The physical sympathy between a
man and woman is a road which may
lead to paradise, but how often may
one lose oneâs self on the road before
entering the field of affection and
thought.

The only logical people in the
world are those savages who, before
giving themselves forever, make a
trial on both sides, and separate or

[Pg 107]

marry, according to the result of the
experience. But such moral and
modest people as we are, must content
ourselves with guessing; and
woe to us if we make a mistake.

Fortunately, the sympathy which
is awakened by a mere study of
the womanâs outward form nearly
always agrees with that deeper one
which arises from the agreement of
the temperaments, by reason of the
solidity which unites the different
offices of an organism.

But it happens only too often
that the interior is different from the
exterior, and a man of ice has taken
for his own a woman of fire, or

vice versa
.

In many codes of law incompatibility
of temper is a sufficient cause

[Pg 108]

for divorce, but is not incompatibility
of temperament a more prolific cause
for domestic discord? Legislators
and theologians have for some time
raised this last veil which hides the
shrine of love, but in their verdict or
the clauses of their laws, have they
contributed or not to the happiness
of matrimony?

I believe not, for in modern codes
the duties and genital rights of two
married people are only confined to
the preservation of the race. Beyond
that they say nothing, and they do
well. But of that other unwritten
code which guides our individual conduct,
do they say nothing, do they
teach us nothing? They do not even
give us a guide-book, or even only
time-tables of fifteen centuries, like

[Pg 109]

those of the railway. After having
studied man and woman for nearly
half a century, after having dared to
raise every veil, to sound every cavity,
to feel every pulse that beats, every
nerve that vibrates, as physician, anthropologist,
and psychologist, this
is all I have learnt.

â

The ideal of physical harmony between
two married people is, that
each one should feel the same hunger,
and feel it for the same thing.

But as this occurs tolerably seldom,
it is better that the man, who is
always the leader of the orchestra of
two, should give the
la
; that is, raise
or lower the tone so that there shall
be perfect harmony. The thing is

[Pg 110]

not so difficult; for if the great
masters succeed in making the
hundred instruments of an orchestra
keep time and tune, should it not be
easier to tune two instruments only?

Above all, remember that the music
has to last many long years, and it is
better to accustom your companion
from the very beginning, so to proceed
that she may not tire, but may reach
the end unscathed. If you begin with
quavers and semi-quavers, poor you!
Your companion of the orchestra will
accustom herself to that
tempo
, which
will become a necessity for herâfor
you it may be a catastrophe.

Even without supposing an excessive
lust in the woman; even if you
have been so fortunate as to have
found one with more heart than feelings;

[Pg 111]

she will believe she is no longer
loved, and in the secret silence of the
night-watches will shed tears, measuring
your love by the early change in
the broken music. Notwithstanding
what I have written of genital hygiene;
notwithstanding that others have followed
me in the same road, throwing
down the walls which supported the
ignorance of the things of love;
women are still too often most
ignorant, and measure love by the
notes of music.
[3]
Think then on the
future, which comes quickly, and like

[Pg 112]

a hungry dog devours the miserable
present, and from the very first days
begin with an
andante moderato
, and
if your means permit, go even to the

allegretto
; but for charityâs sake do not
proceed to quavers and semi-quavers.

[3]

Whilst writing this, a courageous book on this
subject has appeared in Germany:
âDer Kampf der
Geschlechter, eine Studie aus dem Leben, und fÃ¼r das
Leben.â
(The Struggle of the Sexes. A Study from
Life and for Life).âLeipzig, 1892. A volume of 173 pp.
It is written by a woman already noted in the literary
world in Germany, who has published several novels
under the fictitious name of Franz von Wemmorsdorf.

â

I find I am treading on the field of
the hygiene of matrimony, whilst I
ought only to speak of
what precedes
it
. Without making the experiment
of the savages, you would like to know
to a nicety the strength of the appetite
for love which your future companion
feels? Well, then, begin to study her
family and, above all, her mother,
who bequeaths her nervous system
to her children, with all its accompaniments
and connections, with sensibility,

[Pg 113]

chastity, or debauchery.
Nothing is more hereditary than the
capacity for love, and I have under
my eyes terrible examples of calamities,
which occurred from a study
of the
fiancÃ©e
alone, without any
thought of her father and mother.

I myself advised a dear friend of
mine to marry a young girl who
appeared to be, and had been up to
that time, the goddess of modesty,
the angel of chastity; I wrote my

milla osta
on the passport of my
friend, and he, who was good enough
to believe me a great specialist in
this abstruse matter, embarked trustfully
and happily on the tempestuous
sea of matrimony. Alas! after a
few months the goddess of modesty
had become a Mepalura!âI had

[Pg 114]

forgotten to inquire after the temperament
of her father and mother.

Having made the hereditary inquiry,
and found the young lady with
a
clean bill of health
, you must study
her.

On an equality with other conditions,
if you desire a tranquil and
not exacting
wife
, seek these elements
in her:

Light hair, blue eyes, fairly stout,
a calm expression, natural movements,
little or no nervousness, lips
rather thin, no protuberance of the
upper lip. Great love of children, a
sure sign of a great development of
the sentiment of maternity, which is
the most powerful restraint on exaggerated
desires of the flesh.

If, on the contrary, you desire an

[Pg 115]

ardent woman, you will more easily
find her with black eyes and hair,
dark skin, tumid and thickish lips, a
thin frame. She will be nervous, very
sensitive, of a capricious character,
she will have glances of fire and
snakelike movements.

All these physical and moral lineaments
are very gross, and only
have value as general observations,
such as one reads on passports,
equally suited to a hundred different
people. I myself must make
a criticism on these two examples of
mine although they are taken from
life, and are the result of many repeated
observations. As regards the
blonde and brunette I ought, for
example, to make you at once aware
that I mean to speak of those nations

[Pg 116]

in which there is a great
mixture of ethnic types, which gives
us in the same city, in the same village,
women with light, chestnut-coloured
or black hair. Where all
are light, or all are dark, we still find
women of ice and of fire, without
any change in the colour of their
skin or hair.

The fullness of body is of greater
importance, for it has a more intimate
and varied connection with the
general nutrition of the whole organism.
It is very rare to find an
exacting woman amongst the corpulent,
unless they are hysterical, and,
from the protuberant lip and bosom,
are condemned to sterility. It is
equally rare to find a cold woman
amongst thin ones.

[Pg 117]

The fleshiness of the lip is a
good index by which to measure
the sensuality of a woman, and it is
so sure a one that I have given it
an ethnic character, having found it in
the most different races of Asia and
Africa, where polygamy is usual, and
physical love is the first pleasure
and first occupation of man and
woman.

â

I do not suppose it likely that
any of my readers will marry a
negress, Hottentot, or Australian savage,
so I need not speak of the
hybridism of races, or the consequences
of the possible unions. If,
before I die, I have the supreme
joy of writing my monograph on

[Pg 118]

man, my
microcosm
; then I shall
be able to tell you my ideas about
it, confessing to you at once my
profession of faith, which is this, that
all those who deplore the effects of
the union of races, saying it is
always injurious to the future generations,
are mistaken; as well as
those of the opposite school, who
always proclaim it to be useful. The
crossing of a superior race with an
inferior one lowers the first and
elevates the second, thus giving a
product of
medium
goodness.

The union of two races equally
superior, generally gives an inferior
product, but a product different from
the two types who have fused their
blood in the crucible of love.

The union of a mediocre and elevated

[Pg 119]

race, produces very different
effects, according to conditions.
These, however, are as yet little
known, and must be studied by
degrees.

If, however, you will never marry
a negress, nor a redskin, and very
probably neither a Chinese nor Japanese,
it is easy enough for you to
become enamoured of an English,
German, or Spanish woman: and in
the present day, when railways and
telegraphs bring nations so near together,
and break down barriers;
marriage is preparing the way for the
future
United States of Europe
, which
will certainly become the keystone of
a cosmic republic, that of the
Civilized
States of the World
.

The differences of type and sympathy

[Pg 120]

between opposite natures easily
prompt to a warm love between dark
and fair nations. More than one
Italian has been obliged to fly from
Scandinavia on account of the excessive
sympathy which he awakened in
those fair innocent daughters of the
Edda; and if a fair-haired son of
Arminius goes into Spain or South
America, it is very seldom that he
returns to his mother country without
a wife, or without great spoils
won in the mighty victories of
love.

Is this a good? Is it an evil?

For the children it is nearly always
a benefit; for married people it is often
an evil. The felicity of husband and
wife is sacrificed to the species, and it
is your duty to set these different, but

[Pg 121]

probable, consequences of union in the
balance and weigh them.

The differences which we sum up
under the word nationality, are not
as marked as race differences, but they
approach them; nationality is always
and in every way the complex sum
of infinite physical, moral, and intellectual
elements which make an Englishman
so different from a Spaniard,
and an Italian so unlike a Norwegian.

To be of a different country from
that of our companion implies not only
the speaking of a different language but
the loving different things, the feeling,
thinking, hating, and desiring things
unlike. We are all living fragments
of a long history of many centuries,
and to unite and make two beings
agree who were born under separate

[Pg 122]

skies, educated with diversity of taste,
with different ideals of religion, morality,
politics, and customs, is possible,
but difficult and uncommon. Look
around, and you will find that the most
frequent motive of these
mÃ©salliances

is nearly always some pecuniary interest,
or else one of rank, unless an
all-powerful love has submerged the
other incitements toward a reasonable
marriage in its tumultuous and furious
waves. Amongst other marriages
those of American girl millionaires,
who come to Europe to exchange their
dollars for shields bearing the arms
of our counts, marquises, and princes,
are very well known.

The difference of nationality in two
married people is just one point lessening
the probability of their happiness,

[Pg 123]

and it is aggravated a hundred
times if a difference in religion is
added to the scale.

There is no great love without great
faith, and he who loves much finds the
speaking of another language, the
following of dissimilar customs, the
praying in a church or mosque, but
insignificant obstacles. But great love,
however long it may last, calms down
and becomes a tender and fond habit;
and when the sea of passion is calmed
one looks through the water, now
grown so clear and transparent, and
sees at the bottom the points of diversity
of faith, taste, and habits, standing
up ruggedly, the rocks rising and coming
to the surface, and rendering navigation
difficult and full of perils. The
honeymoon is then hidden behind the

[Pg 124]

dense stormy clouds, and the mariners
run into the shallows of indifference, or
dash the vessel against the waves of
incompatibility and domestic discord.

The calkers may come with their
gold and their coats of arms to patch
up the wreckage, but it will always be
patched badly, and the holy concord
of bodies and souls will be lost forever.

[Pg 125]

CHAPTER V.

THE HARMONY OF FEELINGS.

Fish
, birds, and mammals, when
they feel themselves fit for love and
wish to win it, develop new organs,
new songs, the newest seductions,
and with Ã¦sthetic or musical fascination
engage in the pleasant warfare
of voluptuousness. They show the
female all they have of the best, all
that is most irresistible, and thus obtain
the prize of victory. So do men
and women. They adorn themselves,
hide their defects, and make a show
of their beauty, but as the battle
between them is fought on a higher

[Pg 126]

plane, each one polishes up rusty
virtues, invents new ones, and sends
his vices or moral weaknesses to
prison or into exile.

Painters, carpenters, artists are
about the house from morning to
evening, in order to make everything
clean and bright, as if in expectation
of an illustrious guest or a great
personage.

And they are right, for the guest
they expect is no less than love.

The fish, birds, and mammals
cease to sing and shed their horns
when the breeding season is over,
and become lowly and ordinary, even
as they were before the marriage.
And the companion, who has been
enticed by the representation now
realized, finds no room for odious

[Pg 127]

comparisons or regrets, for she and
her mate are already separated and
neither thinks of the other.

With man, however, when once the
victory is gained, the curtain of the
comedy of love falls. But the marriage
remains.

It remains with the defects which
return to view, with the vices which
spring afresh from the pollard boughs;
and with the little sins, returning from
their exile and creeping home, one
after the other.

This is one of the most fruitful
sources of the deceptions of matrimony,
and it must be prevented. We
ought to discover the real truth,
under all the coquetry of the sex,
and to know what metal lies beneath
the varnish and polish. This artificial

[Pg 128]

beautifying of man and woman who
woo is not hypocrisy, but a natural
and irresistible desire of showing our
best to the person we love, and hiding
from him our worst. But from this
innocent desire we mount a flight of
many steps, until we come to the
blackest hypocrisy, which transmutes
brass into gold, glass into diamond,
demon into angel.

Exceedingly few see clearly when
they have the spectacles of love before
their eyes, and love has, not unjustly,
been painted from the remotest
antiquity with his eyes bandaged.

The lover is so blind, or, perhaps
one would rather say, is so afflicted
with altruism as to mistake colours,
and, under such an hallucination, to
see virtues where there are vices, to

[Pg 129]

find weakness of character agreeable,
a lie a jest, and treachery a game.

The most acute spirit of observation,
the most profound knowledge
of the human heart, do not suffice
to protect us from these seductions,
which make us see the loved one
through a rose-coloured glass.

â

Yet discord of character is the
gravest peril, and unfortunately the
commonest to marriage, and it may
reach such a degree as to oblige husband
and wife to separate. Where
the law permits divorce, it becomes
the terrible situation which, in official
and legal language, is called
incompatibility
of temper
.

And what does this dreadful word

[Pg 130]

mean? What monster is this, that
can divide what love has joined, that
can transform sensual pleasure to torture,
honey to gall, heaven to hell?

When I write my book,
I caratteri
umani
, which I have been meditating
and working at for so many
years, perhaps I may be able to get
more light upon this obscure point
of individual and national psychology.
But at present I am satisfied to treat
the problem on wide lines, and only as
far as it contributes to the happiness
of marriage. In the mean time let me
state the terrible fact, once and for all,
that among the many discords which
are possible between the man and
the woman, none exercises a more
weighty influence than that which
arises from want of union in character.

[Pg 131]

There may be happiness between
a rich man and a poor woman; between
a poor man and a rich woman;
an elderly woman and a young man;
an old man and a young woman;
between two different intellects and
educations; we have rare but well-confirmed
examples of harmony between
all these contemporaneous
discords. But when characters cry
out against and strike one another,

Lasciate ogni speranza o voi
che entrate
; then desperation will be
the habitual state of the dual existence.

â

Incompatibility of character does
not mean a difference of taste, affections,
aspirations; for differences are

[Pg 132]

necessary to perfect harmony, and
the man and woman (we have
repeated it a hundred times) love
each other better and better the
more the man is a man and the
woman a womanâwhich is as much
as to say the more different they
are.

In common language incompatibility
of character means, for example,
to harness an ox and a horse of
Arab breed to the same carriage;
to put a tortoise and a deer to walk
together; to tie a goose and a swallow
to the same cord, and condemn
them to fly together; and if these
comparisons fall short of the reality,
it is because their enormity does not
reach by a very long way the psychical
discords of men and women.

[Pg 133]

In that monstrous pairing of the
deer with the tortoise, the horse with
the ox, the swallow with the goose,
only locomotion is treated of; but
for the race that a man and a woman
must take through life it is a matter
not only of velocity, but of environment
and measure; of all that
can modify senses, sentiments, and
thoughts. To find a comparison
which at all suits or pictures truthfully
the tortures of two badly
matched individuals who must live
together, I can only take that of a
fish and a bird condemned to live
together. But this comparison is not
even good, for either the fish or the
bird would die surely and quickly,
but of the man or woman neither
dies, but live a death in life, feeling

[Pg 134]

nothing of life but disgust, pain, and
wrong.

Convicts also are paired with a
chain without any regard to their
sympathies, but they have at least
the psychical relationship of crime,
and often vice, which brings them
near each other, and also that other
common hope of escape that makes
them allies and even brethren; but
in that other galley of a badly
assorted marriage there is not one
chain alone, but a hundred and a
thousand, all invisible, with as many
nerves connecting two existences condemned
to the sad communion of a
common torture which is doubled for
each by the suffering of the other.

There is the chain of the heart,
the chains of taste and sympathy, the

[Pg 135]

chains of antipathy, habits, desires,
and regrets; and along the length
of these chains there run currents of
spite, hatred, rancour, malediction,
vengeance, and retaliation.

The slightest movement on one
side is communicated to the other by
the chains, and makes that other feel
his pain, which he returns doubled by
its own force and rendered crueller
by the desire of revenge. So each
wrong has an echo, and the echo is
doubled and increased a hundredfold,
until the whole life becomes a torment,
as if every nerve had tetanus,
and every organ of body and soul
was transformed into a tooth suffering
spasms of pain. When a long-forgotten
wound is cicatrised, and a
rougher movement than usual re-opens

[Pg 136]

the wound anew, in that martyred
frame there is not a member
which does not suffer nor a single
feeling that is not pain.

This is the meaning of incompatibility
of character, which has been
adjudged with reason by legislators
as a sufficient cause for divorce, and
it is, and ought to be, more so than
impotence, bad treatment, or any
other cause of separation.

â

This want of harmony in sentiment
has only too many and too varied
forms, but at the foundation there
is always this skeleton:

That which I like you dislike; that
which makes you happy makes me
suffer.

[Pg 137]

Woman is an ermine, who allows
herself to be killed rather than cross
a field of snow soiled by mud.

Man, on the contrary, is like a
chimpanzee, who loves dirt and soils
himself with it. There is no part
of his body or soul which does not
love this mud.

How can two such creatures live
together?

â

He is an optimist even to cynicism,
an egoist even to adoration of himself,
and his motto is,
AprÃ¨s moi le
dÃ©luge
.

She is a pessimist from having
placed her ideal so high that no
human hand can reach it. She cannot
not live an hour without loving and

[Pg 138]

dedicating a thought, an act, or a sacrifice
to the good of some fellow-creature.

How could they ever live together?

â

He has never felt the want of the
supernatural, and believes neither in
God nor in a soul.

She was born a mystic, and the
maternal education has made her
religious and superstitious. She has
a very strong tendency to asceticism.

How could two such beings be
happy together?

â

He is frank, expansive even to
imprudence, impetuous even to wrath.
He says out straightly what he
thinks, swears and curses, only to

[Pg 139]

forget within an hour the storm
which overwhelmed him.

She is close, shut as with seven
seals, timid, diffident, and only expresses
the tenth part of what she
feels, and even regrets that slight
expansion. Susceptible as a sensitive
plant, she starts if she meets a
grain of sand, a hair, or a feather
which touches her. She finds an
offence and want of respect in everything,
suspects evil everywhere, and
even in good seeks bad intentions
with all the zeal of an inquisitor.

Will these two live happily together?

â

He is a misanthrope from indolence
and diffidence; he detests
society and avoids it.

[Pg 140]

She adores cheerful society, garrulous
and merry talk, theatres,
balls, not that she may seek an
opportunity for sin in these places,
but simply because she adores what
is noisy and deafening.

Join these two togetherâhow can
they bless matrimony?

â

By instinct and education he is
democratic, detests all forms of
despotism from the tailor to the
government. He is a socialist, and
would be an anarchist if he had
not a sound heart and did not love
his kind passionately.

She is of a decayed noble family,
keeps and adores the family
coat of arms; when anyone from

[Pg 141]

politeness calls her marchioness she
reddens with pleasure, and her
heart swells with pride. She has a
profound and sincere respect for
authority, and bows reverently before
priests, soldiers, millionaires, and
princes.

Can these two together bless

life
?

â

He is avaricious, but will not
confess to it; he makes a secret of
his income to be able to complain
constantly of his poverty. Nothing
escapes his domestic financial inquisition.
Not a halfpenny is given
in alms at his door, not a match
burnt uselessly. Coffee grounds are
never thrown away without first

[Pg 142]

extracting a second and third edition.
The querulous wailings of his
laments over excessive expenditure
and taxation fill the air around
him with a bad odour of mildew
and closeness.

She is generous, and noble in
her hospitalities and charities. She
likes enjoyment herself, and to make
the enjoyment of others, and to
hear it responded to by all with
âThank you, thank you!â She cannot
understand how one can torment
oneself to-day by thinking of
the still distant day after to-morrow;
even the fascination of an
uncertain
to-morrow
allures her. She believes
warmly in Providence and Fortune,
and earnestly defends the thoughtless.

And these are husband and wife!

[Pg 143]

He is always in a state of febrile
excitement or of depression. He
declares to all that the most unhappy
man is he who feels no
enthusiasm, and that the most
happy man is he who feels everything,
and hopes that he himself is
such an one.

She instead is always cold, derides
every form of enthusiasm, because
it seems to her a species of madness;
detests poetry, all psychical
pleasures, and all passions when
they pass 10Â° Centigrade; derides
heroism, sacrifice, and martyrdom,
contenting herself by declaring it to
be the matter of a novel or a
stage play.

And these twoâcan they live happily
together?

[Pg 144]

These few examples, taken from
the stage of the real world, will be
sufficient to give you an idea of
the many discords of character one
finds in the union of marriage.

Certainly all are not so flagrant
or so keenly accentuated, but they
are more complex and complicated,
whilst the discord is rarely upon
one note only, but upon many
together.

And what can we do to defend
ourselves from the peril of
incompatibility
of temper
?

In one way only: by studying and
restudying the character of her whom
we wish to make our companion for
life. After being convinced that she
will show herself better than she
really is we must make every effort

[Pg 145]

to surprise her in undress, or, better
still, in a state of nudity. Naturally
I speak in a figurative sense. I
should wish to see her nude of all
artifices of coquetry and hypocrisy.
Begin to examine the moral surroundings
in which she lives, and
before studying her study the future
father- and mother-in-law. She is only
a branch of that plant upon which
you wish to graft your life, and a
great part of the childrenâs character
is that of their parents.

It is exceedingly rare for a loose,
libertine mother to have a chaste
daughter, and a lily of innocence
is hardly ever born into a family of
impostors. We have spendthrift sons
of a miserly father, and
vice versa
;
bigoted children of atheistic parents,

[Pg 146]

and disbelievers sons of bigots; but
as regards moral habits there is very
rarely the heredity of antagonism.

Examine especially the moral surroundings
in which the young girl
was born and has grown up; her
habits, the books she reads, the
amusements she prefers. Gain information
as to the character of her
friends, for in them as in a glass
you will often see the soul of the
woman you wish to make yours.

I know an angelic woman with
many friends who vie with each
other in loving her, and are jealous
one of the other for her affection.
These friends are all unusual women,
of refined tastes, delicate feelings, and
generous hearts. They all chaunt her
virtues in chorus, and, without knowing,

[Pg 147]

I judged her from her friends
to be an angel, and I was not mistaken.

After having made your psychological
research as regards her parents
and friends do not disdain to descend
to a more humble sphere. Question
her maid, cook, coachman, dressmaker,
and the labourers on her
estate: all those who for one reason
or another serve and obey her.

No one knows us better than
those who serve us, for whom we
make no pretence to hypocrisy or
ostentation of false virtues, and if
a ladyâs maid does not know how
to make a psychological analysis of
the young lady she can show
us the most intimate secrets of her
character. Noble, generous, and good

[Pg 148]

natures never ill treat their servants;
or they feel all that compassion
for them which their position
merits, and apply toward them the
daily and domestic virtues of a tender
and affectionate benevolence. Always
doubt the character of those
who are changing their servants frequently.
They are nearly always ill
disposed, and being unable to vent
their evil instincts in higher circles,
begin to torment their slaves at
home.

They pour forth on the ladyâs
maid, dressmaker, or hairdresser all
the disappointed vanity, hidden jealousy,
bad temper, and anger of their
petty social struggles.

Then if they feel the need of
being despotic they satisfy it by

[Pg 149]

using their power over those poor
victims paid at so much a month,
and condemned to live on the moral
excrements of their masters. I know
ladies of the highest financial and
hereditary aristocracy who are not
ashamed to beat their maids brutally
and cruelly. If you succeed in learning
this do not overlook it, do not
pardon it, but fly the contact of one
who will exercise her own evil-mindedness
and despotism upon you,
and later on, upon your children.

â

I prophesy that when you have
finished your examination on heredity
and friendship, and that closer inquiry
into your dear oneâs home
affairs, you will find the sister soul to

[Pg 150]

your ownâshe with whom you will
sing the hymn of perfect happiness all
your life, the only perfect happiness,
that of a union of two. But this is
the rarest good fortune. In most
cases you will find neither absolute
discord nor ideal harmony, but a
partial accord, which with labor and
good will you will be able to convert
gradually into perfect harmony.

If your love is great and deep, if it
pours out from the viscera of your
whole organism, if she loves you well
and enough, rest assured that the
rocks will fall to pieces, the mountains
be levelled, and the thorns be removed,
for love is the most skilled
magician, and knows even how to convert
gall into honey. Woman is

[Pg 151]

cleverer than all the rest of the world
in this thaumaturgic work, and you
must really be the most stupid egotist,
the most antipathetic creature in the
whole universe, if your companion
cannot succeed in making you agree
with her after a few months. And yet,
take care. This harmony ought not to
be that of a victim resigned or a slave
subjected; that would be an artificial
agreement which lasts a short time
only, and thrives but ill. It must be
a slow and clever adaptation of the
sharpness of the one to the roundness
of the other. It must be an intelligent
and tender acclimation to surroundings,
tastes, and habits, so that the
rebellious sprig may be bent without
pain or breaking, so that the vine
leaves may seem pleased at their connection

[Pg 152]

with the pollard

[4]
which supports
them, and the bright and ruddy
bunches of grapes seem to smile with
joy on foliage and pollard alike. Happiness,
too, is a tree which requires a
wise and loving cultivation. We men
are the pollards; the vine is our companion
who leans upon us, bound
there by the withes of love and of
reciprocal indulgence. Above all
things marry a good woman, one, too,
who loves youânot for the title you
bear, not for the gold which fills your
chests, but because she admires and
esteems you, and is proud to bear
your name.

[4]

It is customary in Tuscany to plant pollards in the
vineyards for the purpose of supporting the vines,
and these are bound to the pollards with willow
twigs.â
Tr.

And then you may be sure that the

[Pg 153]

little discords of character will be surmounted,
and in the indulgence with
which your companion so patiently
bears with your defects you will find
every day and every hour a proof of
that love which will only cease with
your last breath.

[Pg 154]

CHAPTER VI.

HARMONY OF THOUGHTS.

Ought
we to marry a silly, an intelligent,
or a literary woman?

If this question were to be answered
by public vote we should probably
have the following ratio:

For the silly woman, 10 votes.

For the literary woman, 0 vote.

For the intelligent woman (that is,
of normal ability), 90 votes.

In this century, in which the voice
of the majority takes the place of
right and reason, the problem would
be solved by that meeting of which
I have guaranteed the result.

[Pg 155]

In all cases, however, this verdict
ought to be preceded by many and
varied comments if it is to be converted
into practical counsels to those
about to take a wife.

The ten who have voted for the
silly woman would say that they did
not desire an idiot, but, on the contrary,
a woman slightly foolish, but
not too much so. But together with
this defect they would wish to have
her handsome, young, and very good-tempered.
They seek above all a
companion who helps them to keep
healthy and merry. There is nothing
more charming, more sympathetic,
more irresistible, than a little absurdity
from a pretty mouth. It makes
one laugh; and when our laugh provokes
that of the one who has uttered

[Pg 156]

it, and she shows her beautiful teeth
in rows like pearls, oh! bless the folly
and her who spoke it.

The ninety who have given no vote
to the literary woman wish us to
understand that they like an educated
woman, but detest pedantry, and that
nothing in the world could make them
desire a
bas-bleu
; much less a

choupette-bleue
,
a variety of the first, so
named by Balzac.

Having heard these comments, let
us now make ours. It is only too
true that in our Italian society the
general culture is much below that
which one meets with in France,
Germany, England, and the United
States. We have the courage to
confess this in our own home if for
no other reason than with the hope

[Pg 157]

that the shame which mounts to our
faces may induce us to remove this
national blot from our children.

Men of little culture desire even less
in their wives, in order that at least
in their family circle their credit may
be unimpugned. From this arises a
general repugnance to teach our girls
too many things, from this comes the
antipathy to the higher girlsâ schools
and to all that tends to elevate the
intellectual level of our companions.
Up to the present time the hasty and
ill-digested attempts have not helped
to modify public opinion for the
better; the only people who dedicate
themselves to higher learning in one
way or another are the ugly, hysterical,
or very poor.

We all open our eyes very widely

[Pg 158]

before a lady doctor or a literary
woman as before some wonderful
phenomenon which perhaps may
change our âAh!â of astonishment
to an âOh!â of admiration; but the
woman will always be a phenomenon
to us.

And she is really a phenomenon,
an idol to put on altars amidst the
incense of our adoration; she is a
woman who thinks as much as a man,
has the learning of a professor, writes
books that are read, or paints pictures
and makes statues to which are
awarded prizes; an idol to be admired
if beauty be added to this
virtue and if grace accompany it;
a half goddess or a goddess if the
talent does not go arm in arm with
pride, and if genius is surrounded by

[Pg 159]

a fragrant and flowering womanliness.
But who finds these phenomena, and
who, having found them, marries
them? Then if the literary woman
is ugly, and impolite, if her body and
voice proclaim the certificate of her
baptism, which makes her more man
than woman, oh! then we are all
agreed in not wishing to have her
for a wife. It is a new species, a
psycho-physico hermaphrodite, whose
books, pictures, and statues we admire,
but whom we have no desire to
share a room with.

â

In sexual union the harmonies of
relation ought to show themselves, in
thought as well as act, in order that
there may be happiness. Therefore

[Pg 160]

it is that man was made by nature
more intelligent than woman. Perfect
harmony is only to be found with a
man who thinks vigorously, does what
he wishes with energy; who rules
and guides the woman in the paths
of life and the glories of conquest.
The inversion of these relations
means to be out of tune and in discord;
it is an humiliation on the part
of the man, and (let us admit it) on the
part of the woman also, who in ninety-nine
cases out of the hundred wishes
to be loved, caressed, and also adored,
but who likes to feel herself ruled.

Woe to those women of intellect
superior to the husband, whom they
must pity, correct when in error,
and too often pardon for his folly
and absurdities!

[Pg 161]

Love is a chemical affinity; and
its composition is proportionately
stronger the more widely different
are the elements in the combination.
The ideal of perfect marriage is
the combination of a man thoroughly
a man,
exceedingly so
, and a woman
thoroughly a woman,
exceedingly so
.
Whenever a man acquires a feminine
tendency of character and a woman
a virile one the chemical affinity
diminishes in intensity, the combination
alters at the least touch or first
contact of a third body which comes
near and has a greater affinity for
one or the other of the two
elements.

A very intelligent woman and a
man of less than mediocre intellect
are combinations of bodies which can

[Pg 162]

only have an exceedingly weak affinity
between them. The first has a
mode of thought which is virile,
and the second has a feminine one.
And only too often the third
element comes to correct the elective
affinity, and the literary woman
takes a man of genius, who rules
her, for a lover, or a robust man,
who calms her; and the husband of
small intellect comforts himself in
making love to an illiterate peasant
woman, or a maid without grammar,
with whom he can show his intellectual
pre-eminence and revenge himself
on the superiority of his wife.

â

I ask pardon (on my knees if
necessary, for I know that my sin

[Pg 163]

is great) for treating of a more and
a less in the measure of thought.

This is really an infantile or Australasian
psychology; but the
much

or the
little
are always the first
approximations to the solution of
every problem, and the
how much

always goes before the
when
and
the
how
.

I admit, then, that in the harmony
of thought between the man and
woman the amount must always be
greater on the manâs side. The
culture of the man is always progressing,
and with it inevitably that
of the woman also, but this ought
always to remain a step below ours,
not because we do not wish to lose
the pre-eminence of potency, but because
the labour of the brain is more

[Pg 164]

difficult and perilous in the womanâs
case than in the manâs, and her energy
naturally less.

Look around without leaving Italy
and tell me how many
normal
women,
how many healthy and perfect women,
there are in our literary circle. I
will not continue on this theme lest
I draw upon myself a shower of
poisoned darts. Several are my
venerated and admired friends, and I
wish to keep their friendship until
my last breath. But if I should say
that many of them are sterile, and
many very nervous, ought they to
feel themselves offended? I esteem
them too much to believe it! Man
is so accustomed to consider himself
superior to the woman in
the world of thought that if he

[Pg 165]

finds an error in the orthography
of a ladyâs letter he is as pleased
as if he had found a diamond in
the sand of a river. That little
error, which was made in the hysterical
haste of a moment of loveâs
expansion, is really a diamond, because
it confirms and assures us of
our intellectual superiority, and shows
us all at once the feminine and seductive
grace of the being we love.
An error of orthography or even of
grammar in a feminine handwriting
is a wayward little foot, which peeps
out from under the skirt of the
dress, and hints to us the glories
of the sex, the inexhaustible delights
of voluptuousness. It is a coquettish
curve which in spite of the thick
clothing whispers in the ear palpitating

[Pg 166]

with desire: Eve lies underneath,
Eve who is awaiting Adamâand
desires him.

â

Harmony of thought between the
sexes ought to spring from the
agreement of the unlike, and in
such a way that no pride should be
offended, and each one be satisfied
to make a sum instead of a subtraction.

A scientific man and a female artist
can form a delightful harmony upon
two notes; a naturalist also and a
woman who adores music; a psychologist,
an inexorable analyst, and a
woman who sees the comic side of
things at once; and thus there are
a hundred other combinations of

[Pg 167]

different intellectual values, which,
summed up, leave each one contented
with his own. Besides special fitness,
there is a sexual character
which impresses itself upon the
thought of the man and woman.
Man discovers, finds, creates; woman
divines, distinguishes, analyses. Man
reaps, woman gleans. Man with too
great haste, often with too great
pride, grasps too much and lets it
fall from its hands; woman walks
behind and gathers up what he has
lost.

Man has less tact in judging his
surroundings, and often gives a cuff
when he means a caress; woman,
on the contrary, like a delicate galvanometer,
feels the slightest electric
or magnetic oscillation in the air

[Pg 168]

which surrounds her, and for this
reason she is a most valuable instrument
to a politician, a writer, or
an artist who attempts new roads to
beauty, and must conquer the resistance
of the majority. Unhappy the
man who before printing a book,
exhibiting a picture, or making a
speech in parliament has no loved
woman from whom to draw life and
warmth. If a sailor never leaves
port without consulting the barometer,
so man never ought to prepare
himself for any undertaking without
having first consulted that barometer
of all barometers, the woman who
loves him. How many ships have
been wrecked from want of this
precaution, neglecting to take it,
through pride or inattention!

[Pg 169]

You may be the greatest man of
genius and your work the fruit of
long and profound meditation; and
yet you may rest assured that in the
great polyhedron of truth some
plane has escaped your sight which
will be seen by the woman who loves
you, because she is a woman, and
sees many little things a man does
not see; and because she loves you
she has a magnifying lens before
the eyes of her heart which makes
all that may injure or benefit you
appear gigantic.

â

It is very rare when a woman has
conquered our moral and physical
sympathies that we love her less for
some discord of thought; but if we

[Pg 170]

want ideal perfection we must marry
bodies, hearts, and intellects. In this
case we must seek in our companion
a discreet culture, an exquisite taste
for the beautiful, a delicate spirit of
observation, a divination of human
character. If you find all this in one
woman, and if she is beautiful and
good, you may deem yourself the
most fortunate man in the world,
and may declare to the whole earth
that you have not one but three
wives, having married intellect, heart,
and thought.

[Pg 171]

CHAPTER VII.

THE FINANCIAL QUESTION IN MARRIAGE.

Before
breeding time birds build
their nests to receive their future
young and to protect them from the
weather. Many men, more improvident
than the birds, marry without
knowing where and how they can
house the children of their love. Air,
earth, and forest afford food to birds
gratuitously; to man only the butcher,
the baker, and eating-house keeper
give food, and they have the weakness
to ask payment for their services.
Economic improvidence in
marriage is the bane of all social

[Pg 172]

decadence, and it is precisely amongst
workmen and the unemployed, or
amongst those who are always struggling
and succumbing, that one finds
it most, for they have become thoughtless
fatalists, to whom the day is
sufficient. Fatalism has many forms,
but it is always a cowardly emasculation
of self, or an even more cruel
mutilation, for it undermines the
strength of the will and leads us to
renounce all that is best in us. In
individuals it is emasculation or
mutilation, in nations it is suicide;
the Ottoman Empire will soon show
us whither
Turkish fatalism
leads.

I am compassionate, and believe
that I pay my debts of charity toward
those who have wrecked their life;
but when a starving fellow begs alms

[Pg 173]

of me, or pleads his
large family
or

many children
as an excuse for his
moral and physical demoralisation,
anger gets the better of me and I
exclaim:
Why, then, did you have so
many?

And this exclamation is not an insult
to misery nor a curse; it is the
voice of reason, which if it could be
heard in the homes of the poor would
suffice to solve the social problem. I
am a Malthusian impenitent, and as
long as I live I shall always say to
those struggling with poverty:

Love, but do not beget children.

In vain priests and rugged moralists
of
Providence
combat Malthusianism,
which has now become a social
institution, and without the need of
written codes governs the economy of

[Pg 174]

the family in France, Italy, Germany,
and even in chaste and fecund Albion.

In vain my
Elementi dâIgiene
were
put
ad indice
, for from year to year
the Malthusian apostolate has made
new disciples, and will continue to
do so.

Neither do I side with those who
believe, with too great a faith or fanaticism,
that a restriction in the number
of births is sufficient to resolve the
social problem. No, certainly not; it
is not enough; but it clears the ground
of the most thorny brambles among
which human felicity gets entangled;
and a comparison between the proletariat
in the populous cities of
Europe and that of the desert
regions of South America is sufficient
to convince us that prolific improvidence

[Pg 175]

is also the prolific mother of
hunger, disease, and death.

If, then, you are not a Malthusian,
nor desire to be converted to the new
doctrine, if you have no straw to build
your nest, do not take a wife, but increase
the glorious number of the animals
of rapine and cuckoos.

â

I know very well that the most hateful
and disagreeable problem of matrimony
is the economic, but we cannot
avoid nor solve it by shutting our eyes
and disregarding it.

To love and be loved, to feel that
our life is doubled and the horizons of
the future enlarged, to drink from the
eyes of a woman who is a perfect
fountain of delight, to feel the doors of

[Pg 176]

paradise opened to us by her lips;
and then all at once to be obliged to
speak of
income
and
dowry
amidst such
intoxicating pleasures; then to remember
between one kiss and another
that to harbour all this paradise we do
not possess, I cannot say a house, but
not even the most modest of rooms!
It is hard, cruel, abominable, but it is
necessary!

The
quart dâheure de Rabelais
in
the affairs of love, and the exclamation
of the Trappists who at table say to
their brethren:
Remember we must
all die
, are the waiters who, entering
the guest chamber, present the
bill
to
the gay and thoughtless merry-makers.
But in matrimony the accounts must
be made out before, and drawn up
seriously, calmly, and inexorably.

[Pg 177]

There is only one man in whose
case I could overlook a want of this
prudence, and it is he who feels that
he has the strength to fight for and
the energy to gain a position, and to
the man who strikes his forehead and
exclaims,
Numen adest
. What does it
matter if such a man has no fortune,
nor even a dowry with her whom he
loves? He has faith in himself
founded not upon pride, but upon the
consciousness of knowledge and
power; and this is more than a patrimony,
for neither phylloxera, bank
failures, nor shipwreck can assail it.
It will last as long as life itself, and
its results still longer.

But how many such men are there?
With the experience of more than
half a century I recommend all others

[Pg 178]

to use such foresight as is near akin
to fear. The whole history of Italian
finance, and the whole chronology of
our innumerable ministers of finance,
teach us that the balance of expenditure
is always greater than that of
the income. Just fancy when these
are added up by that maddest of
treasury ministers whose name is
Love!

The following words must have
been repeated more than a thousand
times between a kiss and a sigh,
A
cottage and your heart
!

But common sense has succeeded in
throwing so much cold water on the
phrase as to render it ridiculous, and
to relegate it to the museum of comic
virtues. However, notwithstanding
the many years I have lived, I still

[Pg 179]

have the ingenuous good nature to
believe this phrase when it comes
warmly and spontaneously from two
loving hearts, and when those two
hearts live in two organisms superior
in intelligence and sentiment it may
yet be true; the cottage may soon
become a house, perhaps even a
palace.

But how many such are there?

The rest no longer say,
A cottage
and your heart
; but,
A palace even
without your heart. A hundred thousand
francs income, with or without the
heart.

In the first pages of this book we
have seen how and why the economic
consideration dominates marriage in
civilised society with all the rigour
of a tyrant, how it commands everything,

[Pg 180]

and is the âto be or not to
beâ of a family.

â

As regards the balance of fortune,
the ideal in marriage would be that
both husband and wife should be
equally rich, or both have moderate
means. It is not necessary that there
should be absolute equality, but it
ought to approach it. In these fortunate
cases the equality of the income
increases the dignity of the
family to a fellowship, and is necessarily
accompanied by many other
harmonies of habits, tastes, and needs.

An
hyper-ideal
of perfection would
be this, that although the amount of
these incomes may be the same, the
separate units should be of a different

[Pg 181]

nature. Thus if the husband be a
rich land owner the wife should hold
house property; and if she has a
large share of money in the funds
the other should own lands or houses.
In this way even the most unexpected
political or meteoric disturbances
would never strand the family. In
many cases a good profession in the
hands of the husband is equivalent
to a rich dowry in the wife; but even
here one must remember that life is
uncertain, death certain. And, in
truth, where the income proceeds entirely
from the work of the father of
the family this very fact is often a
cause of ruin to the family well-being.
They have no land, houses, nor money
in the funds; a lucrative employment
gives them riches, and parents and

[Pg 182]

children live upon them without
putting a penny aside. Then a railway
accident or some illness unexpectedly
kills the father, and from a
gay, rich life they are reduced to the
most squalid misery.

Empleomania
is a Spanish word,
and it sprung up in Spain as if in
its native soil, but if we have not
registered it in our classical dictionaries
we have the equivalent in the
speech of the common people. And
above all we unfortunately have the
thing it represents; and it is one of
the most exact measures of our
inertia of intellect and will. In the
middle class, and especially in its
lower ranks, the daily dream of the
good mother of a family is to give
her daughter to a
government official
,

[Pg 183]

and it is the dream of a thousand
small men, young, short-sighted fellows
of slight phrenic development,
to have some
official situation
, no
matter what, so that in the morning
they are not obliged to think
how they can pass the day or to
make any itinerary, but just go to
the office at fixed hours, and at
fixed hours return home. To do
what others desire them to do, without
the trouble of thinking themselves,
and to muse on the sweets
of the Sunday rest for six days in
advance; for eleven months to feel
the delights of the twelfth, that of
the vacation, and to be able to
think that every month of the year
has a certain day which bears the
number 27: a blessed day on which,

[Pg 184]

whether it rains or pours, whether
Liberals or Conservatives are in
power, whether Crispi or Rudini is
ruling, the paymaster is ready and
they receive their salaryâah! these
are serene and tranquil pleasures
which make mothers weep for joy,
wives leap for pleasure, and the
hearts dance in nine-tenths of those
Italian bipeds who love the peace
and security of the morrow ...
and the 27th of the month.

â

If there be an inequality in the
riches of two married people it is
a hundred times better that it should
be in favour of the husband.

A woman is never humiliated when
she is poor and marries a rich man,

[Pg 185]

or when, with moderate means, she
marries a millionaire. However
much she may be oppressed by social
laws, however often she be placed
below man in position, she brings
him so many treasures with her
beauty, youth, grace, and all the
prizes of her womanhood that they
weigh in equal value to gold, millions,
and coats of arms rich with a
hundred emblazonings.

There is perhaps another less
noble, but more human, reason, which
explains the inequality of our judgment
on the subject of matrimony
between persons with different
amounts of income.

It is precisely because the woman
is set a peg below us by law and
custom that she can accept riches

[Pg 186]

from us without any feeling of
shame; besides, it is very difficult,
if not often impossible, for her to
gain sufficient by hand or brain
work to maintain the family. Everything,
then, conspires to enable her
to give her hand to a rich man
without selling or prostituting herself.

When instead of this it is the man
who accepts the riches from the
woman, without balancing them by
great genius or by a very high social
position, he always renounces that
manly dignity which ought to be his
nobility; he stands degraded before
his wife, lowered, and at the least collision
with vanity or passion he may
be struck full in the face by an insult
which ought to sink into his very
heart.

[Pg 187]

I know several cases in which a
very rich woman fell desperately in
love with a handsome, cultivated, but
poor young man, and he to save his
own dignity fled from her love. And
the lady followed and conquered him,
trusting courageously to the proverb,

Ce que femme veut, Dieu le veut!

They were married, and he loved
her, working constantly with his pen,
brush, or chisel, having sworn to himself
and to her that he would only
live by his work. Noble and touching
struggles for personal dignity, of
love and pride, which one but seldom
sees, but which console our sight,
daily saddened by so many simonies
of luxuries, so many pretences of
heroism, so many individual, social,
and political lies, which darken the

[Pg 188]

air so heavily that it is difficult for
the sun to penetrate the cloud.

Whoever makes a business of marriage
will laugh cordially at me, and
at my sentimental fantasies.

Let him laugh! I do not pretend
to teach him how to make marriage a
paradise on earth. He will continue
to seek a golden dowry, and if he has
a great coat of arms and an empty
purse he will put the first up at auction
in order to fill the second; and
if the game should succeed he will
carry his wifeâs money to the gaming
table, the turf, or to the cabinet of
the cocotte, and feel himself happy to
have gained in one day that which
others cannot obtain with all the hard
work of a laborious and pure life.

Lying on a Turkish divan, smoking

[Pg 189]

a perfumed Havana, he will raise
to himself a monument of admiration
and acknowledgment amidst the blue
fumes of his cigar.

And is he happy? Happy, perhaps,
but never enviable; for I know no true
and durable happiness which degrades
dignity, which hides itself in the
depths of the soul, which can silence
itself with the gag of sophism and
the accommodation of conscience, but
that, like a steel spring, it will burst
and spring from its bonds the more
unexpectedly the greater the repression.
A man who in the inexorable
soliloquies of his own conscience
has something on which he dare not
think, or has a room in his house
which he can never visit without a
shudder or remorse, is never happy.

[Pg 190]

And even if the long training in
cynicism succeeds in silencing the cry
of repressed dignity, there will come
a day of domestic discord, of duels
fought between husband and wife,
with the weapon of bitter smiles,
cruel compliments, and insinuations
full of perfidy and venom, a day when
the wife, striking her fan on the arm-chair
with little convulsive blows, will
cry:
But in short, my good fellow, I
keep you
.... If that man, in such
a moment does not redden to the
roots of his hair, if at that moment
his saliva is not changed to gall, nor
forms a lump in his throat, if he
does not feel his very heart and
source of life poisoned, that man is
not a man, but an unclean animal
who has sold his manhood for a

[Pg 191]

handful of gold; he is a most abject
being, a hundred times more
despicable than the poor prostitute
who sells her body to gain her daily
bread.

[Pg 192]

CHAPTER VIII.

THE INCIDENTS AND ACCIDENTS OF
MARRIAGE.

But
even if you have chosen the
best of women for your companion,
whether it be due to your merit or
your good fortune, the great problem
of happiness is not yet solved, for
there are so many incidents and
accidents which disturb it when least
we expect them.

Your wife is never a meteorite
fallen from the sky, but a fruit still
attached to the branch, and this
branch is taken from a trunk, which
is the family to which she belongs.

[Pg 193]

When you marry her you must
inevitably marry her relations also;
you must enter a
clan
which may
be a garden of roses, but may be
also a waspâs nestânay, even a nest
of vipers.

Do not allow yourself any illusions,
believing that when once you
are legitimate master of your companion
you will be able to isolate
yourself in the nest of your domestic
felicity, chasing away wasps and
crushing the vipers, if there should
be any. I will suppose that the
woman loves you much, and adores
you above all creatures in the world,
but the
clan
from which she has
been taken will complain of you,
protest and conspire against you.
Her parents have ceded the government

[Pg 194]

of one of their provinces to
you, but still hold the
protectorate

and place a
resident
near, and they
reserve the right of intervention in
many, unfortunately in too many,
cases.

The idea of a wife, then, would
be that she should be an orphan
with only the most distant relations
or guardians, who are happy
to have her well married. But here
again there are new complications.
To be an orphan at an early age
means, since the parents died young,
to belong to an unhealthy stock.
The decadence of many English
families is due to this very fact. The
younger sons of the nobility, who
bear a noble name, but have an
empty purse, seek to equalize blazonry

[Pg 195]

and finance by marrying orphans,
or only daughters, and thus
they bring into the new family the
risk of an infirm state of health and
sterility.

It is only too true that all the
gravest problems of life are so framed
that when you have succeeded with
patience and labour in untying one
knot, others form under your fingers.

The wife, however, might be an
orphan from other causes, independent
of the health of the parents, and
that would be the highest idealâfor
example, a girl who had escaped
from a fire, or a railway accident, in
which both parents (alike robust)
were killed. I am supposing things
incredible, or at least improbable; I
make cruel conjectures, but what can

[Pg 196]

I do? A scolding, wicked, or jealous
mother-in-law is worse than a fire
and railway disaster together.

Those good, courteous, intelligent
mothers-in-law need not alarm themselvesâthose
who become a second
mother to their sons-in-law, who
double the delights of the dual life,
who bring you the valuable blessing
of experience and disinterested affection,
and who act in the domestic
storm as conciliatory judges. Hosanna
and everlasting glory to such
beings, sent by Providence to double
your happiness.

For I only speak of others who,
without being bad, are women, or
rather men, with all the congenital
defects of the race of Adam.

The best of mothers-in-law always

[Pg 197]

sees in you an intruder, a rival, a
man who has robbed her of her daughter,
and since she is good she will not
worry you; but she will make scenes
of jealousy; she will not plot against
you with your wife, but will swallow
so much bitterness day by day in the
secret silence of her house as to enlarge
her liver, so that some day or
other her moral jaundice will be scattered
through the atmosphere of your
home, and you too will feel the bitterness.

I understand and am indulgent.
That bitterness is distilled from the
deepest and most delicate regions of
the heart. To have loved a daughter
for twenty or thirty years, to have
brought her into the world with pain,
to have suckled her with spasms, to

[Pg 198]

have educated her with a wise love,
after having breathed the same air,
eaten at the same table, shared bread
and tears; and then for the first comer,
just because he wears trousers and has
an impudent moustache, to rob her of
all that treasure with an arrogance as
if he claimed and took his ownâthat is
hard. And as if that were not enough,
the daughter, the angel of her domestic
temple, runs after the trousers and
moustaches, and goes away, abandoning
her motherâs and her own house,
as if she were leaving a room at an
hotel in which she had passed the
night.

Let us be just! Who will dare to
throw the first stone at that poor
woman, the pitiable mother? Who
would dare ill treat her if she asked

[Pg 199]

as a charity the favour that her daughterâs
new home should be near hers, if
she implored you to allow her to visit
her often? Man is egotistic and feels
paternity less than woman, but even if
only in a slight degree he ought to
understand the hidden hell of a
mother-in-law who has to watch her
daughter leave her own nest.

The marriage of a loved daughter is
an event expected and desired, but it
is like a birth, a blessing accompanied
by tremendous pain. Elect natures
feel the pain, but do not show it, lest
they should give pain to others, and
never convert it into hate.

Others, on the contrary, transform
every drop of bitterness which they
swallow into a feeling of vengeance,
which they ruminate on for some time

[Pg 200]

and hatch with cruel patience, to launch
it against you when least you expect it.

I may suppose you to be patient and
good, to be an optimist in your philosophy;
you will be deaf to the most
mellifluous insinuations, you will say

Thank you
when your foot is trodden
on, and
Thank you
for the rhubarb
lozenge which will be offered youâin
short, you will take the points from
all the darts launched against you;
but there will come a day in which
patience, goodness, philosophy, will be
scattered to the wind, and you, with so
much repressed wrath, will burst out
all at once, and placing yourself before
your wife, will say:

âThere must be an end to all this;
it must be either I or her!â

The proverbs of all European languages,

[Pg 201]

the satires of the poets, the
wit of dramatists, have always agreed
in compassionating the sons-in-law,
and hurling darts against the mothers-in-law.
This experience of many centuries
has taught us that a good
mother-in-law is very rare, and that in
marriage she is an element most
pregnant with danger, most fruitful
in disaster.

From all this we ought to learn
two things:

1st. Before taking a wife to study
the character of the future mother-in-law
well, and to try and discover
whether we shall find in her an angel
or a harpy, an ally or an enemy.

2d. According to the result of our
psychological inquiry we ought to
declare most decidedly that we will

[Pg 202]

not live with the family of the wife,
nor take her mother into our house.
If the chosen one of our heart really
loves us she will consider this decision
of ours quite just, and will help us
to gain the victory if a battle there
must be.

In your own case do not pass it
over, do not cede a handâs breadth of
land; keep firm in your intention,
being quite convinced that by so
doing you will make your own happiness,
that of your wife, and of the
new family. Between mother-in-law
and son-in-law there ought to be
affection and respect; a current of
benevolent, delicate, and gentle sentiment
ought to pass between them,
but at a distance, a most respectful
distance; so that no sparks, shocks,

[Pg 203]

much less lightning flashes, may appear.
Affection, not intimacy; respect,
not subjection.

â

But the complications do not finish
with the problem of the mother-in-law.
There is the other problem
which arises when the candidate for
marriage has lost his first wife, or the
woman her first husband, or both of
them their first partners, with or
without children on one side or on
both sides.

The possible combinations are these:

Widow and widower

without children.

with children.

of the man.

of the woman.

of both.

Widower

without children.

with children.

Widow

without children.

with children.

[Pg 204]

These various combinations are so
many algebraical formulÃ¦ in which
one may find snares, dangers to
happiness, and rancour without end.

If you are a widower and you
marry a widow, and neither of you
have children, no danger hangs over
you. Liberty on both sides, no right
nor pretext for intervention; marriage
presents itself almost in the guise of
an union between two young people.

You may indeed incur the danger of
your wife making comparisons, and
these not to your advantage. An
old proverb says,
Comparisons are
odious
, but I should like to make a
correction and add that for him to
whom they are unfavourable they are
odious, but flattering to him who
gains by them. Perhaps you may

[Pg 205]

excel your predecessor, and your
companion will be happy to find
it so.

In any case, if you have your
weak side inquire about the public
and private virtues of the first husband,
and put the results into the
balance which must weigh the pros
and cons of the marriage.

A widow and a widower may both
have children, or one only may
have them. The dangers in these
cases are very different.

It is better for the wife to have
them, for if the husband really loves
her he will also love her children;
and besides, being a man, he is
less at home, and paternity is always
an episode in his life and not the
whole life, as maternity is with the

[Pg 206]

woman. Then if the man has the
good fortune not to have children
he will often end by loving his wifeâs
as much as though they were his
own.

In the case of there being children
on both sides the balance may
prove of advantage, because it is
equal in weight and measure, and
the two married people have cause
to reproach themselves and to suffer
for the same things.

The worst case is that of a widower
with children to whose number
the new wife adds; he must be an
angel, his wife and children angels
also, if no civil war breaks out in
his house. Think of it well, think
a hundred times. Do not complicate
the marriage, already fraught

[Pg 207]

with so many dangers, by imprudence
and temerity.

In marriages between a widow and
a widower the greatest danger arises
from the children, who fear or see
their future threatened, and who in
their love for their lost parent believe
the new marriage to be an outrage
to the memory of the dear one.

It is in these cases that we see all
that a man has of venom and baseness
come up and soil and cover everything
with defilement and poison; all the
brutal possibilities of human egotism
covered, it may be, with varnish but still
the skeleton underlying every thought
and feeling.

â

Only one of the engaged persons
may be widow or widower, and it is

[Pg 208]

greatly to the honour of women that
more men marry a second time
than women. Man often finds more
happiness in marriage than she does,
while she is more faithful to the
memory of the departed, and thinks
more of her children than herself.

How many women I have known
who, being left widows quite young,
have sacrificed themselves, together
with the need of loving and being
loved, to their children, often to one
alone; proud of their sacrifice, unconquerable
against all temptations
and against all the power of the most
legitimate passions.

Do children know how to value
this heroism hidden in the bosom
of so many families? Do they understand
that there is more courage

[Pg 209]

required in this struggle of months
and years than one dayâs assault of
a battery in battle?

Very rarely do they know it, for
even the best of children do not
return a hundredth part of the love
they have received from their parents,
and especially from their mother.

â

Is happiness more easily to be
found in the union of a widower
and a young woman, or in that of a
widow and a celibate?

The answer is difficult, for the
problem is too vague, and individual
qualities weigh too heavily in the
balance, gradually modifying the surroundings,
the affections now warding

[Pg 210]

off dangers, now increasing them
infinitely.

If other conditions be favourable
the widow is generally an excellent
wife for many reasons: She has lost
many illusions, but has learned to
know and excuse the egotism of
man. Sometimes she will have been
obliged to beg her first husbandâs
pardon for some accession of jealousy
or caprice; and as a woman always
occupies herself in everything more
with other peopleâs happiness than
her own, she wishes to give her
second husband perfect bliss, and
often and willingly succeeds. If she
cannot offer her companion the
virginal flower (which after all is
more a myth than a real jewel)
she can give him all the treasures

[Pg 211]

of amorous experience, that is often
worth more than a hundred virginities.

On the other hand the widower
who marries a young woman has
the great advantage of her not being
able to make any odious comparisons,
and he also brings precious
gems to the new home which an
unmarried man does not know or
possess. He has learned to know
all the little weaknesses and great
virtues of woman, he has learned
to become less egotistical, to think
of others more than himself, and
as separate from himself, and he
generally is an excellent husband.

â

In all intricate problems, in all the
fatal confusions which present themselves

[Pg 212]

in the marriage between widows
and widowers, between widows, widowers,
and celibates, the anchor of
safety which saves from shipwreck is
always the heart. When there is
great love, and it is shared by two,
who join hands forever, every difficulty
is cleared away, and concord
ends by hoisting its banner over the
new house. The most ferocious
hatred is conquered by generosity, by
the indulgence of one who loves
much, and after a short battle of the
opposing forces love scatters its
flowers and blessing over the new
nest. Love is the strength of
strengths, which surpasses all others,
and in this case it is omnipotent, so
that when it exists in all its proper
energy on one side only, it absorbs

[Pg 213]

all the minor energies, and on the
fields threatened with hail and lightning
the sun shines through the last
drops of the beneficent rain, and the
rainbow hangs its multicoloured bridge
in the sky, drawing enemies nearer
and making them allies.

â

Of all the accidents which we may
meet on the threshold of matrimony
one of the most common is the stoppage
of the way by someone who
exclaims: âHalt! there is no passage
here.â

You are a minor, or your loved
one is, or the person who has the
right to speak does not find your
choice to his taste, and shuts the
door of the temple you wish to enter

[Pg 214]

in your face, securing it with many
chains. Civil war is declared, and it
is to be seen who
can
and
ought
to
gain the victory.

This
can
and
ought
are not synonymous
terms, because the parents on
one side or the other
can
withhold
their consent to your union, but
many times they are in the wrong,
and ought not to refuse to sanction
the marriage.

As regards two lovers, if their love
is sincere, if in their secret and confidential
dialogues they have sworn
the everlasting
yes
to each other, if
they have nearly conjugated half of
the verb to love, they believe that
they have every right in the world
to become husband and wife; and
when they have tried all fair means

[Pg 215]

to bend the will of the tyrant or
tyrants they run away together,
secretly, hoping that once the deed
is done it will sooner or later receive
the consent of those opposing it.
Sometimes, however, the wandering
sheep are discovered before the deed
is consummated, and are re-conducted
with many reproaches to their respective
folds. In more serious cases
spectres of single or double suicide,
asphyxiation, poison, or the revolver
may appear.

Should anyone find himself in
such case meditating death, and have
time to cast a look on these pages,
let him leave the charcoal, the poison
of the druggist, and the revolver of the
armourer. Life is a good and beautiful
thing that must be guarded with

[Pg 216]

love, caressed with tenderness, and
if love ought to be the bridegroom of
the marriage, reason and good sense
ought always to be present as witnesses.

If with a stroke of a magic wand
one could raise all those who have
committed self-destruction to life
again, after having dressed their
wounds, they would take up life
gaily, and even another love affair.

Parents always have the duty and
the right of speaking, protesting,
and counselling, nay, even of interposing
a
veto
, if they see their childrenâs
future endangered when they
have chosen love as arbitrator, but
have forgotten to call good sense
and reason as witnesses.

If you
will
marry an abject creature

[Pg 217]

who will dishonour your name
and the name of the family to which
you belong, and of whom after a few
months of warm passion you yourself
will be ashamed; if you
will

marry a woman suffering from tuberculous
disease, or one of a consumptive
family, or where madness is
present; if you
will
increase the
sad patrimony of proletaries and
the unemployed, having neither present
nor future resources; if in one
way or another you throw yourself
with closed eyes head foremost into a
bottomless abyss only to satisfy carnal
excitement which you may call
passion, but which is only the desire
of the fleshâfather and mother have
full right to oppose your ruin with
all possible means; and even if they

[Pg 218]

should not succeed they will have
done their duty. If the means they
take succeed you will later on thank
them with a warm gratitude.

In all these cases I allow you to
combat, to weep, even tear out some
of your hair; but the tears over, the
muscles tired, gather up the hair you
have torn out and present it to your
fair one, telling her to keep it until
your return as a pledge of your
eternal
faith
; for you ought to leave,
and that instantly, even on foot, even
asking money of the tyrannical parents
or of some compassionate
friend. Travel in far countries, and
who knows if on your return you
will not find a neat little packet tied
with rose-coloured ribbonâyour letters,
your hair, and perhaps the announcement

[Pg 219]

of the marriage of your
old
fiancÃ©e
.

If your love, instead, has known
how to resist the long absence, if
it has strengthened and grown, who
knows if the hard parents will not
be moved to pity and try to make an
adjustment, provided, however, that
there be no consumption, madness,
or other calamities to dissuade you
from marriage in an absolute and
decided way. Better that you should
die than sow death broadcast in
future generations.

â

There are some cases, however, in
which the wrong is not yours, but
is theirs who unreasonably and tyrannically
oppose your happiness from

[Pg 220]

prejudices of rank, avidity of money,
or some caprice or other. If you are
a count or marquis and love a girl of
good family without a coat of arms,
or if you are very rich and wish to
marry an educated girl of angelic
character, but who is not richâin
these and similar cases seek the
help of your mother, who is nearly
always more compassionate than your
father, or ask counsel and help from
some intimate friend, from one of
the few who knows your heart like
a book, and has never flattered you.

In these domestic contests it is
very rare for right and reason to be
on one side only; there is a little on
this side and a little on that; your
hands are too unsteady to hold the
balance of justice steadily, and weigh

[Pg 221]

with precision the
pro
and the
con
.
Your mother, instead, who loves you
as no one else can (not even your
lover), and your friend who knows
you well, see things from a dispassionate
and calm point of view,
and will judge justly whether you
are right or wrong; and if you are
neither mad nor a fool you will end
by believing those who love you and
desire your good; and, as the case
may be, stand firm and you will win.
The ancient Greek appealed against
Philip, the modern miller appeals
against Berlin, and both were right
against Philip and against Frederick
the Great. Your mother and friend
will appeal to you not to fast entirely
from love, but to be a little less
hungry, and who knows but that they

[Pg 222]

will end in being right against that
king of kings Loveâstronger than
the father of Alexander the Great,
greater than Frederick the Great.

If they really love you, and are
persons of good sense, they will say
neither
No!
nor
Never!
to you, but
will content themselves by saying,
Have a little patience; wait.

Time is the chief and capable corrector
of the proof sheets of the
sketches of love, as also the policy of
Fabius the temporizer, who knew
how to gain so many wars by skirmishes
and battles.

The stone of comparison enables
us to distinguish gold from ignoble
metal; time teaches us to separate
with certainty true love from the
desire of the flesh, from the fussy

[Pg 223]

exactions of self-love and all that
is plated. And perhaps, besides
your mother and friend, you will
listen to the long experience of him
who writes, and will hear his voice,
which says to you, cries to you, supplicates
you:

Let time take its course, ever and
always.

[Pg 224]

CHAPTER IX.

HELL.

I am
sitting in a restaurant in the
town of âââ, at the seaside. It is
the height of the bathing season,
the carnival of salt and fresh water,
and the whole world is forgetting
the labour and unpleasantnesses of
city life for a few weeks.

I am waiting for my breakfast,
seated at a table just outside the
house, under an arbour of vines and
convolvulus. The sea breeze reaches
me, plays with my tablecloth and
sports with my hair, uniting itself
to the perfume of flowers which peep

[Pg 225]

up, red, white, and violet, happy also
in the midst of all the sunshine,
greenery, and freshness.

Nearly all the tables, scattered
about under the arbours or in the
shade of the trees, are surrounded
by happy people who have just taken
their baths, fresh, with disordered
hair, hungry and merry. Even human
life has its good quarters of an hour.

Near me I see a teacher to whom
two girls of about ten and twelve
have been intrusted, and who, faithful
to her trust, is giving them a noisy
lesson in morality and gallantry, whilst
she eats and drinks as if she were
starving. I cannot imagine how she
does it, but she manages not to
interrupt her educational discourse,
whilst she never ceases to eat and

[Pg 226]

drink. The pupils do not listen to
her, but look at each other, slyly
laughing at the inexhaustible conversation
of their instructress. A
little further off there are three
young fellows who, having passed
their examinations well, have been
rewarded by a visit to the seaside.
They are laughing, noisy, and giddy
with youth, thoughtless, envying no
living soul. One of them has just
finished his breakfast, and in order
to pay his bill of one franc fifty
centimes he brings out a red banknote
of a hundred francs, and offers
it to the waiter with great pride,
and in such a way that everyone
can see it. It is the first he has
ever had, and already that morning
he has offered it at the coffeehouse

[Pg 227]

to pay fifteen centimes, and at the
baths to pay for his ticket of fifty
centimes. No one would change it,
and even the waiter says he has
no change; and the young fellow
is happy, for he will be able to display
it a fourth, a fifth, and even a
sixth time.

Facing me a whole family of some
seven or eight persons are eating merrily,
and the children, in a chromatic
scale of bright colours and different
heights, range from two to fifteen
years. Each one is giving utterance
to its joy, clambering up and down
the chairs, playing with a little dog
to which they give the tid-bits on
their plates. The father is red, stout,
and in his shirt sleeves; he looks
smilingly at his blond companion,

[Pg 228]

reading in her smile the reflection of
all that lisping chatter, laughter, and
folly which surround them.

All these people, differing in age,
condition, and intellect, unite in the
same merriment, which they seem to
have drawn from the sea, the father
of planetary life, the dispenser of
spirit and energy; and all the while
the golden rays of the sun shine
through the vine leaves, the ivy, and
convolvulus, painting with the shade
and penumbra of the leaves the
tablecloth, the dresses of the women,
and the rosy faces of the children,
throwing patches, half shades, and
glistening spots on the garden sand.

I, too, a solitary observer, enjoyed
all the bright sunshine and the happiness
of the people, but forgot that I

[Pg 229]

had only looked to the right and
straight before me; I turned calmly
to the left, sure of finding there
another scene of joy and brightness.

On the contrary, the picture was
very different.

At a table just as clean and white
as the others, played on capriciously
by light and shade, two persons were
sitting, a man and a woman.

He was about thirty, she forty-five.
He was handsome, robust, with manly
energy; she lame, fat, and hunch-backed.
There ought to have been
a neck, but there was none to be
seen, for the heavy head appeared to
have been put on the chest awry;
and all the cruel artifices resorted to
for hiding the hump behind seemed

[Pg 230]

made on purpose to produce another
in front. Even her features were
ugly, and the ill-made hands were
laden with rings. Large earrings
were in her ears, and a colossal
locket surrounded by diamonds,
inclosing the manâs portrait, was
hanging in front. Husband and
wife, no doubt.

She was eating, but could not
have known the flavour of the food,
for the mouthful went round and
round between her teeth, whilst another
piece on the fork was waiting
in vain for its turn to enter the
mouth. That poor deformed being
did not cry, that is, no tears fell on
her cheeks, but she blew her nose
every now and then, and the eyes
were moist and sad. She placed the

[Pg 231]

fork automatically from time to time
on the plate, with the mouthful still
on it, and gazed at the man lovingly,
tenderly, waiting, imploring for a
look.

But the look never came. With
one hand he hastily conveyed the
food to his mouth, and with the
other held a newspaper, which he
was reading with pretended interest,
so as not to have the silence interrupted.
He did not shed tears nor
blow his nose, but he frowned, and
he was also suffering one of those
intense and hidden agonies to which
one does not confess, but which
furrow the soul like harrows of steel.

I did not remove my eyes again
from that dumb and agonizing scene.

After a long interval she said to

[Pg 232]

him, timidly, hesitatingly, almost as
if committing a crime:

âWill you take anything else?â

He started as if the voice had
struck him like a blow in the face;
he turned to her and twisted his
mouth like one seized with a sudden
and irresistible disgust.

âNo, I want nothing more.â

The
No
was pronounced angrily
and with scorn; it was, and must
have been, a blow to her to whom
it was addressed. He looked at her
a long time, a look full of hatred, remorse,
and disgust. It seemed as if
he were passing in review all his
companionâs ugliness, and as if until
that moment he had never seen it
so clearly: those wrinkles, that gray
hair, that hump, the deformed neck,

[Pg 233]

those arms which looked like hams
in sacks, and then those rings and
jewels which seemed to jeer at the
white, flabby flesh with their brightness.
The deformity, the grotesque
violation of good taste, suddenly
struck that handsome and robust
man, for he had sold youth and manhood
to an unfortunate woman who
had believed it possible to still love
and be loved.

The two had plunged into the waves
of the sea a little before; they had
drunk of the sunâs rays too, but neither
sea nor sun had been able to give
happiness to these unfortunate creatures
who had bartered carnal pleasures
for gold, who had changed sacred
love to a vile prostitution of flesh and
banknotes.

[Pg 234]

She had already passed the meridian
of her second youth; he was still
young.

She was undressing. He was already
in bed, and followed the progressive
unclothing of that body with
an anxious curiosity, that body once
so active, so handsome and fascinating,
now all submerged in the high
waters of an invading corpulence.

He wished to hide his head under
the counterpane, and did so, but a
morbid curiosity made him put out his
head again directly, and he looked.

She had read in her glass only too
well the ruin of her form, and had
always sought to undress alone; but
this time she was obliged to do it
before his eyes. She ingeniously hid
the regions which had most suffered

[Pg 235]

wreck, and with a remnant of coquetry
kept uncovered her shoulders, the

ultimum moriens
in the womanâs body;
but diffident of herself, and fearful of
those looks which seemed to pierce her
through, her last garment fell from her
hands to her feet, and the disasters of
the wreck suddenly appeared, standing
out cruelly, without pity for her or for
him.

She uttered a cry and stooped down
to cover herself....

He, egotistical, pitiless, forgot all the
delights that this body once so fragrant
of youth and beauty had given him,
and exclaimed, throwing the words in
her face:

âAt a certain age I think a little
more modesty is demanded.â

From that moment, from that evening,

[Pg 236]

the two were enemies, two galley
slaves bound by the same chain.

â

She was reclining, rather than seated,
on the sofa, with small and large cushions,
which allowed her to change the
frame of which she was the picture.
She was smoking a cigarette, and
had a French novel on her knee that
could not have interested her very
much, for at that moment she yawned.
The yawn was cut short, or rather
interrupted, by the sudden opening of
the sitting-room door; no one ever
entered the room in that way but him.
This time it was more like him than
usual: always a husband, now an
angry one.

He entered with his hat on his head,

[Pg 237]

his stick in his hand, as if he were just
going out or had just come in. The
latter was the case. On returning from
his walk a large envelope had been put
into his hand in the anteroom. It
contained a dressmakerâs bill, the third
or fourth he had received in a few
months. The total was very high,
higher than usual, and he came into
the room with the bill in his hand to
make a scene.

âCome, now, come, now, my lady,
when shall we finish with these accounts?â

She made no answer, but continued
to smoke, only growing a little red in
the face.

âIt seems that my lady believes
herself to be a millionaire; this is
the third bill that I have had to

[Pg 238]

pay in little more than four months.
But what game are we playing,
my lady?â

And
my lady
, throwing the end of
her cigarette on a Japanese tray,
stretched out her voluptuous limbs,
and showed, as if by chance, a
fairy-like foot and a leg for a sculptor.
More than once already had
the disclosure of such a picture,
sacred to love, warded off a heavy
storm. Now, however, neither foot
nor leg could disarm her husband,
who had thrown his stick on a chair,
but kept on his hat, to increase the
violence of his words and to give
authority to his threats. In the
meantime he rumpled and then folded
the innocent paper with alternate
convulsive movements.

[Pg 239]

âI shall not pay this bill; you
must pay it yourself. You have
jewels (given by me, of course); put
them in pawn. You will then learn
not to play the princess with other
peopleâs money.â

The little foot and leg retired
under the dress, ashamed of their
defeat, and at last the lady opened
her mouth too:

âI think you can hardly expect
me to cut a sorry figure in society.â

âBut what society? Society of
Egypt! Many ladies who are more
truly ladies than you donât spend half
what you do. I have inquired and
know very well.â

âYes, your Fifi told you, your
Fifi, for whom you pay much larger
bills than you do for your wife.â

[Pg 240]

Never had his wife uttered the
name of the stage dancer until that
moment, and he had believed her to
be quite ignorant of his amours. He
reddened up to his hair, frowned,
and shook himself as if he had been
stung by a viper, and the conversation
became embittered even to
brutality.

âAh! jealous, and impertinent too!
It seems to me that when one has
not brought a halfpenny of dowry
there ought to be a little more
modesty and economy.â

âGood, very good, sir! I have
brought youth and beauty as a
dowry, and a dowry besides; yes,
you insolent man, a good dowry, a
large sum which was lost in the
failure of the Bank of Turin. And

[Pg 241]

is that my fault? And you, what
have you brought me? A bald head,
false teeth, and a body eaten through
with viceâa fine patrimony, truly.â

âAh, you had a dowry, had you?
I have never seen it; the only
treasure I have seen is the gold
with which your teeth are stopped.
Sell that and pay the dressmakerâs
bill with it.â

The bill flew in the air and fell at
the womanâs feet.

The husband went out of the
room, slamming the door so loudly
as to make the little Japanese figures
and the other bric-a-brac on the table
tremble. And the wife, lighting a
fresh cigarette, set to, with all the
force of her intellect, to invent some
revenge worthy of the insult received.

[Pg 242]

She was alone in her boudoir,
seated before a writing table of
ebony inlaid with ivory. She wrote
rapidly and smiled to herself, as one
smiles when one is writing to one
beloved, and saying a saucy thing
flavoured with much tenderness.

Nothing was heard in the room
but the soft and rhythmical scratching
of the steel pen on the paper.
She was so intent on what she was
writing that she had not heard someone
raise the
portiÃ¨re
, enter the
room, and stand before her.

That someone was not the person to
whom she was writing, for raising her
graceful head for a moment as if
to seek an adjective more merrily
saucy to put with the others, she
saw her husband, whom she believed

[Pg 243]

was out, standing before
her.

She uttered a startled cry, and
unconsciously covered the paper she
was writing on with her right hand.

âAh, is it you? How you frightened
me!â

âAnother time I will have myself
announced.â

These words were said without
anger, and with a serene calmness;
but a diabolic irony played round
the mouth.

The smile gradually converted itself
to a real laugh, to which the nodding
head seemed to beat time.

âPerhaps you were writing to
Count B. Who can write the better,
you or he? His letters are pretty,
very pretty! How much passionâno,

[Pg 244]

passion is not a fit word, it is
too flattering; let us say
sensuality,
lasciviousness, debauchery
. Which
of these words do you find most
suitable?â

The lady had become white as
death. The pen fell from her hand
and made a large blot on the
elegant paper.

But the husband, continuing to
laugh, had approached her, and having
drawn a chair to the writing
table, stroked her hair lovingly.

âYou were afraid; but of what?
You think, perhaps, that I am come
to make a scene, or perhaps to kill
you, and then myself after. No, no;
I only like double suicides on the
stage or in novels, provided the
author of the book or the drama

[Pg 245]

has talent. But here, why stain this
beautiful Persian carpet with your
blood, why scatter mine over the
elegant paper you were covering with
your words of love? It would really
be a pity, a crime, and above all a
folly. I am come to make a compact,â
and he laid a long kiss on the
little fair curls at her neck.

It seemed to the lady as if that
kiss burnt her like a red-hot iron.

She withdrew her head and gazed
at her husband with glassy eyes,
petrified with astonishment.

No, he had not really the look
of an assassin. He was calm, cheerful,
like a good-tempered fellow who
was playing an innocent joke, a very
innocent one.

âGive me a cigarette. The air

[Pg 246]

is heavy with the odour of your
cigarettes! They must be very good
ones. Probably Count B. brought
them for you from Constantinople?â
He did not wait for her to give it
to him, but took one himself from a
bronze bowl and lighted it. âI told
you, then, that I was come to make
a compact with you, a compact of
purchase and sale, in which we shall
both gain something. Look!â

And here the husband took out of
the pocket of his greatcoat a perfumed
packet of letters tied with a
golden cord.

âI have a treasure here! the entire
and complete collection of all the letters
the count has written you. Not
one is missing! The ladyâs maid you
dismissed last week made me a present

[Pg 247]

of them, gave them to me for nothing.
There are a hundred and thirty,
written in three months! How much
will you give me for this treasure?â

The lady, being suddenly reassured
that her husbandâs intentions were
not homicidal, looked at him with a
gaze full of contempt and cruelty.
She no longer felt fear or remorse.
She could have wished at that moment
that the letters might have been not
from one lover only, but from ten, a
hundred, and that each one could
strike him and spit in his face. She
began to laugh too.

âBravo! capital! you are a man
of spirit. Give me a kiss!â

And the kiss was given, a faithful
copy of the one that Judas gave
Christ nearly twenty centuries ago.

[Pg 248]

âI will give you a thousand francs!â

âOh! oh! oh!â

And here followed a long and
loud laugh.

âA thousand francs! a thousand
francs! What are you thinking of?
I want ten thousand francs, not a
penny more or less. If not, I will
give them to your father for nothing,
only reserving two or three of the
most lascivious to publish in the
papers. Do you agree?â

âGive them to him if you will.
I shall say that you wrote them, that
they are false. My father esteems
me highly.â

âUm! Your father is not a fool,
and the writing of the count is not
forged. I want ten thousand francs!â

âI will give you five.â

[Pg 249]

âNo; it is too little. I must pay
Ninaâs millinerâs bill, and I want to
go to Paris.â

âI will give you six.â

âNo, ten. Not a penny more or less.â

âVery well; I will give you ten
thousand francs. Give me the letters.
Swear that they are all here!â

âLook at the dates. They are
really all here. They are numbered
too by the count, with red ink, perhaps
with his blood.â

And here there was a loud laugh.

âWhen you bring me the ten
thousand francs I will give you the
letters, not before.â

â

The compact was made, the letters
were returned, the sum was paid.

The husband paid Ninaâs millinerâs

[Pg 250]

bill, and has gone to Paris. Indeed,
he has already returned and is still
living in the house of his wife, with
whom he hopes soon to be able to
negotiate a new ransom.

And she?

She has a new lover to whom she
never writes and from whom she will
not receive any letters. When he
complains of this strange proceeding
she throws her arms round his neck
and, kissing him, says:

âIs it not better, dear, to have a
kiss the more and a letter the less?â

And the husband has waited a long
time in vain, hoping to discover a
new packet of perfumed letters, tied
with a golden cord, all marked in
progressive numbers, written with
red ink, perhaps with blood.

[Pg 251]

CHAPTER X.

PURGATORY.

But
few marriages are a hell, and
fewer still enjoy the highest beatitudes
of heaven; the most stand halfway
between the twoâthat is, in purgatory.
There they live without
redemption, which means without any
hope of mounting to heaven; but
neither have they any fear of being
hurled down among the fallen angels.
After a more or less lengthy honeymoon
they descend gradually to earth,
now walking amongst nettles and
thorns, now amongst the flowering

[Pg 252]

beds of the garden, to remain there
till death.

To describe all the forms and
accidents of this conjugal purgatory
would be to exhaust the human universe.
It is enough for me to present
some scenes taken from life, so that
you can judge of the rest from these
examples.

â

It is eight oâclock in the morning;
he has been awake for some time;
she is sleeping soundly and sweetly.

He had been quiet and silent for
more than an hour, reading the paper,
smoking a cigarette, looking at his
wife with the fond hope that she
may wake up of herself, but in
vain.

[Pg 253]

Then he coughed several times,
used his handkerchief without needing
it, shook the bed, but in vain.

The waiting had become impatience;
impatience had changed to a
troublesome, insupportable agitation.

Then he gave her a sweet, light
little kiss on her lips. She woke
with a start and stared at himâhe
who had expected a smile or an
answer on a par with the question.

âHow you frightened me! Why
did you wake me so suddenly?â

âI thought my kiss would have
pleased you, and hoped to wake
you gradually without giving you a
shock.â

âBut you knowâyou know very
well that for some time past waking
me in that way has hurt me. It

[Pg 254]

gives me palpitation of the heart, and
then I feel ill all day.â

âI have been awake since six
oâclock, and have had the patience
to wait two hours for you to wake;
you have slept nine hours.â

âAnd if I wish to sleep ten what
have you to say against it? Do
you not remember that I worked
like a dog yesterday, that I had to
attend to the house linen, put the
drawing room in order, and then
went round to all the shops to
find a good flannel for your vests?
You ruin my health, and will give
me disease of the heart by your
nasty habit of waking me up so
suddenly.â

âAnd how ought I to wake you?
Teach me.â

[Pg 255]

âIf I could teach you to have a
little more consideration, if I could
cure you of your egotism, I would
willingly do so; you only think of
yourself.â

The tone of the conversation on
her part, at first slightly irritated,
had become angry, rancorous, and
full of suppressed bitterness.

He felt it, but still hoped for a
reconciliation.

He tried to feel her heart.

âLet me see if you really have
palpitation of the heart.â

She turned her back on him angrily.

âLet me alone; after having done
me harm you now want to joke. I
tell you you will finish by killing
me!â

He turned away too, muttering

[Pg 256]

under his breath and thinking sad
thoughts of that chemical combination
called marriage.

â

âListen, dear; I should like to dine
an hour earlier to-day.â

âAnd why?â

âBecause I eat nothing at breakfast
and have a poetâs hunger.â

âI, on the contrary, have none at
all. I eat too much.â

âBut besides my appetite, I have
another reason for wishing to dine
earlier. Do you know, I have promised
my oldest and best friend, Giovanni,
to meet him at the station on
his way to Rome?â

âWho knows that it is not a lady
instead?â

[Pg 257]

âCome with me to the station and
convince yourself.â

âHeaven defend me! I am not
jealous.â

âA little! You are jealous six days
in the week and seven times every
day. You are always so and always
in the wrong.â

âBut I tell you I believe you; I
was only joking.â

âVery well, then, we will dine at
five instead of six.â

âImpossible! Annina has brought
home such a tough fowl that it will
require all the cooking in the world
to have it ready by seven.â

âBut I can do without the fowl!â

âBut there is nothing else! Go
another time to meet Giovanniâwhen
he returns from Rome, for instance.â

[Pg 258]

âHe will not be returning by the
same route. I know he has to go
back by Civita Vecchia and Genoa.â

âWell, anyhow, we cannot dine at
five!â

âAh! it is enough that I should ask
a thing for you to find a thousand and
one difficulties to prevent you doing
what I want. It has been so ever
since we were married, and will be to
the end.â

âAnd you will always be that obstinate
and infallible man who wishes to
command in housekeeping where the
woman ought to be mistress.â

âGo on, go on! Just because one
wants dinner at five instead of at six
you have your usual reproaches for
me. I know them by heart already.â

âYet it does not appear so, for you

[Pg 259]

are incorrigible and will have what you
want at any cost, even if your wifeâs or
childrenâs health has to suffer, or even
if the sky fall.â

âYes, yes, you are right; a tough
fowl will kill you. For Heavenâs
sake do not let us have such pettiness.â

âBut it is you who are petty, thanks
for the compliment; if I am petty you
are egotistical, and ought not to have
married.â

âAnd you ought not to have had
a husband, you chatterer, you intolerable
scold!â

âGo on. Havenât you some more
gentle, nice adjectives; they are so
well suited to your delicate mouth?â

âYes, I have a good many left; you
are foolish and have no common sense;

[Pg 260]

you make a rope out of a thread of
silk, and in everything you find a pretext
to make scenes and torment me,
and scatter gall on all you touch. Yes,
you must be suffering from the liver.
Call in the doctor, you must have the
jaundice.â

âIt is you who have the jaundice,
and to show you that you are the
most petty of the two I will be silent
and go.â

âAnd I will go too, and will dine
neither at five nor six, but at the
hotel. At least I shall not hear your
ugly and impertinent voice there,
your chatter without sense, and I
shall have an hourâs rest from the
infinite sweetnesses you scatter over
the time when we are obliged to be
together.â

[Pg 261]

He is director of some large works.
He is early at his desk, for it is
Saturday and he must balance the
accounts of the week and pay the
work people. He is in an exceedingly
bad temper, for he has discovered
that the cashier is not honest,
that his chief superintendent is
ignorant, and that a good many customers
have sent in complaints of the
bad quality of the goods despatched
from the factory. He has both arms
on the writing table, his head is between
his hands, and he looks mechanically
at a row of figures before him
without reading them.

She, on the contrary, is in the best
of tempers, for she feels well, and
when she was dressing her hair the
glass told her how handsome she was,

[Pg 262]

very handsome; and then her little
boy on waking a little before had
sat up in his cradle and, smiling,
had said
Mamma
for the first time.

She caught him up in delight in
his little white night-dress, just as he
was, and ran to her husbandâs office,
opened the door without knocking or
waiting to know if anyone was there,
and rushed in hastily and happily.

He had hardly time to raise his
eyes before she was at the writing
table, and had placed the child on a
bundle of papers, and said in an agitated
voice:

âGive papa a kiss.â

Papa loved the little fellow very
much and the mother exceedingly;
but at that moment he hated all
and everything, even himself. What

[Pg 263]

would he have given at that moment
not to be unkind; what would he
have done not to have had his wife
and child there to make him hurt
them!

How many fierce, dumb, and invisible
struggles are carried on in a
manâs brain within a few seconds.

He said nothing, but put his mouth
quickly to the childâs.

âYes, yes; bravo; give me a kiss
and then go away directly, for I am
busyâI have a devil in every hair
and a thousand anxieties in my
mind ... yes ... yes, so ... good-by,
good-by.â

And he almost pushed away mother
and child with his two nervous, angry,
almost threatening hands. The poor
mother had not expected such a reception,

[Pg 264]

and could not reconcile herself
to it.

âDo you know that Carlino has
just said
Mamma
for the first time,
really, just now when he woke?â

The father was silent and fretted,
angry with himself because he could
not and did not know how to call up
a single affectionate word to his lips
or a sole caress to his hands; all was
dark before him, and everything so
bitter that absinthe would have seemed
honey to him.

And to be obliged to be so hard
with that touching picture before
him! Oh, why had that woman
come at such a moment? Why had
he not locked himself in his office?

The mother could not give in.
She drew her lips to his scowling

[Pg 265]

forehead, but he did not draw down
those lips to his; he simply touched
her cheek coldly. That kiss was an
insult; he was ice; he was brutal.

She felt a lump in her throat,
which broke into a sob.

âYes, yes, let us go away. We
will not come again to trouble you.â

He got up hurriedly and went to
the window, but did not open it. He
put his hands through his hair and
exclaimed aloud:

âBless the women! they never understand
anything; they come into
the office, interrupt oneâs work, and
oblige one to be harsh to those one
loves best. And yet they pretend to
be our equals.â

He continued his panegyric on
women alone, for mother and child had

[Pg 266]

disappeared, both crying, the mother
mortally offended by the double
blowâthe one to the wifeâs heart,
the other to the motherâs. The child
screamed, frightened at the cruel scene
which he appeared to feel, if he did
not understand.

Sobs and cries lasted some time,
and were heard through the wall in
the office, making a savage harmony
with the bursts of impatience of the
angry director of the factory.

â

âDo you know, dear, the Marquis
of Bellavista came into our box at the
theatre yesterday evening?â

âWhat did he want? I did not
know he was in Florence.â

âNeither did I.â

[Pg 267]

âUm!â

âI thought he was still in Naples;
but he told me he was staying a
day or two in Florence on his way
to the races at Milan, and seeing
me in the box, he came up to shake
hands with me.â

âI hope you were rude to him,
so that he will not be tempted to
come and see you a second time.â

âRude, no! but cold. You can
ask your mother, who was present
at the time.â

âI canât believe that you had not
seen him before during the day,
when you were out, or perhaps here
at home. You tell me now that you
have seen him at the theatre because
a hundred others might tell me, and
you wished to forestall them.â

[Pg 268]

âBut this is a gratuitous insult,
unjust, cruel! I do not think I have
ever given you reason to doubt my
loyalty.â

âI have not the slightest suspicion
of any other man who may pay
you attention, but with the marquis
it is quite a different thing.
Before you married me he was deeply
in love with you, and you with
him; and the affair went a good
way, for you were engaged to each
other. It was only your father who
broke off the engagement at the
last moment because he heard the
worst accounts of the character of
his future son-in-law and of his disreputable
conduct. First love always
leaves deep impressions.â

âNo, my love, had I really loved

[Pg 269]

the marquis I should not have married
anyone else, nor should I have
believed the accusations they cast at
him. I should have waited until I
was mistress of myself, and not have
given my hand to another.â

âAnd how long was the marquis
in the box?â

âAbout an hour.â

âVery good, only an hour! Too
short a time for a love appointment,
and too long for a complimentary
visit.â

âBut I could not send him away.â

âWhen a woman desires it she can
always make a man understand that
his visit is inopportune, inconvenient,
and that he must shorten it if possible.â

âYou teach me how I can do so.â

[Pg 270]

âAnd then you chatted over your
old love, and the cruel rupture of your
separation.â

âWe only spoke of music and
theatres.â

âWe may believe that. But I am
going out to see if I can discover
whether the marquis is still in Florence,
and how long he intends to
stay. And in the meantime, if he
is barefaced enough to call here, I
beg you will not receive him. This
I demand and desire.â

âNo command is necessary; I know
my duty.â

âNot always. A visit of an hour
in the box of a woman to whom the
man was once engaged is an offence
to her husband.â

She, who was completely innocent,

[Pg 271]

felt herself really offended by all the
suspicions of her husband, and began
to beat her foot on the carpet and to
torture a volume of CoppÃ©e lying on
the table with a paper knife.

From anger and from opposition to
the unmerited offence she had a firm
idea that the Marquis of Bellavista
would never have been so jealous, so
foolishly jealous. Libertines know
the hearts of women a little better.

The husband went out of the house
without a farewell word to his wife.
He became a spy on the marquis,
and followed his steps from cafÃ© to
cafÃ©, at the club, amongst friends,
dividing his projects, and tormenting
himself in a hundred and one
ways, one more absurd than the
other.

[Pg 272]

âWill you allow me, dear, to make
an observation?â

The question is asked by a man
still in bed, and is addressed to his
wife, who is near him under the same
sheet, and is still sleepy.

âAbout what?â

âAbout the French song you sang
yesterday at the countessâs.â

âAnd what have you to say about
it?â

âThat you pronounced the
u
very
badly, just as if it were
ou
.â

âAnd have you nothing else to
criticise?â

âNo. Now do not be angry; if
your husband does not tell you of
these thingsâââââ

âBravo, capital, and a thousand
thanks; above all, let me congratulate

[Pg 273]

you on the time you have selected for
correcting my errors in French pronunciation.
Instead of wishing me
good-morning with a kiss, a caress, or
a loving word the French professor
gives me a lesson in language. Do
you give it to me gratuitously, or
what do you charge for it?â

âThere you are, up on your high
horse in a moment, and for such a
trifle. You are a Tuscan and the
u

is hard and difficult for those lips of
yours, which distil milk and honey;
but another time be careful. People
will say you do not know French.â

âBut what French! I ask you if
in the excitement of the music, or
the torrent of notes, there is anyone
who would notice if one said
u
or

ou
. And I do not speak of a vowel

[Pg 274]

only. Who listens to the words?
They can only be distinguished with
difficulty.â

âThere are those who notice. First
of all, the French, who do not like to
hear their language mutilated; then
the envious, the spiteful. Now only
see, each time you had to repeat the
word
dur
, which you always pronounced

dour
, the Marchioness Vittoria
smiled, and looked at her sister,
who laughed and then pursed her
lips to imitate you. Neither one nor
the other was aware that I saw all
their pantomime in the mirror.â

âHow can you tell what they were
laughing at? I know that I was
very much applauded, and that my
voice and method of singing were
praised.â

[Pg 275]

âYou certainly sing well, but remember

that in good society applause

is bestowed upon all, especially upon
handsome women.â

âYes, but only to those who know
how to pronounce the
u
.â

âShall I tell you all, since you are
determined to take offence at the
slightest observation which I make?â

âYes, tell me.â

âWell, the Duke of St. Etienne
whilst they so loudly applauded you
bent forward to his cousin and said:
â
Oui, elle chantÃ© trÃ¨s-bien, mais elle a
le timbre de la voix un peu dour
.â
And the amiable little cousin covered
her face to hide her Homeric laugh.â

â
Dur
or
dour
, I must get up an
hour earlier, or else you will drive me
mad. My day will be a happy one,

[Pg 276]

and I shall have you to thank for it.
A thousand thanks, you master of
French!â

To know the reason of this sudden
burst of anger, why from being
slightly keen the conversation became
suddenly bitter, and the notes from
sharp became acute, you must understand
that the cousin of the duke
was, from position, youth, and beauty,
the official rival of the lady who
pronounced
u
as
ou
.

â

They are both seated at the table
with their four children, their ages
ranging from five to twelve years.
She, the mother, is helping them all.
He is watching the distribution of a
delicious custard. From time to time

[Pg 277]

he frowns, and shakes his head in sign
of disapprobation.

And this pantomime continued so
long that at last she became aware
of it, and in her turn looked at him
crossly and put down the spoon.

âWhat is the matter? Some new
criticism?â

âYes, but itâs no new subject of
complaint. For some time past I
have noticed the thing every day at
breakfast, dinner, and supper, and if I
have not given utterance to my dislike,
it has been to avoid any unpleasantness;
but to-day it seems as if I
were losing patience.â

âLose it; I will pick it up.â

âYou might have a little more consideration,
especially when you usurp
the prerogative of a god and distribute

[Pg 278]

good and evil with such authority.â

âWhat do you mean?â

âI mean that you always serve the
boys first and the girls after, whilst
in all ages and countries ladies are
served first.â

She began to laugh heartily.

âBut I see no ladies here, only
children, who have no sex in my
eyes, for I love them all equally.
To-day, and for several days past, I
have helped Cecchino and Pietro first
because they are near me. When
Maria was in Cecchinoâs place I
helped her first. What! ought we
to teach children, in their earliest age
of innocence, etiquette and the laws
of society? This seems to me the
height of absurdity.â

[Pg 279]

âAs to the absurdity of the idea,
that is not the question. It is a matter
of justice. You always prefer the
boys.â

âAnd you the girls, so we are
quits.â

âBut look round and read your
condemnation in the plates of the
children. You not only help the boys
first, but you give them more.â

âOf course; they are older!â

âNo, no, independently of age you
are partial.â

âBut when none are the same
age?â

âWhat difference does one or two
years make? The difference is in
your injustice, your deplorable partiality.â

âDo me the favour of helping them

[Pg 280]

yourself. It will be one labour the less
for me and for you a pleasant occupation,
a splendid opportunity to administer
justice in the family. From
this time forth I will help them no
more.â

âNeither will I.â

â

For the honour of the two married
people who discoursed so learnedly
on distributive justice, it must be remarked
that they spoke in German,
a language the children did not
know. So that for this time at least
they had no opportunity of learning
that heaven is very far from most
families, and that human justice is
generally very unjust.

[Pg 281]

The reader will be grateful to me
for not wearying him longer with
other sketches taken from real life
revealing the matrimonial purgatory.
Hell is awful, but it has its dramatic
emotions and these offer some compensation
for all there is of monstrous,
sanguinary, or horrible. Purgatory
instead is very small, mean, and deplorably
vulgar. There are no ocean
storms, but bogs which submerge us
inch by inch; no tiger bites, but
mosquito stings; no lionâs claws, but
the puncture of the flea; no delirium
or crime, but secret sobs and silent
tears; the continual itching of a scab
which heals, forms a crust, and is
again broken; an exudation of malignant
humours which leak out drop
by drop from the marrow of the

[Pg 282]

bones through the tissues, to the skin,
and there they remain viscid, fetid,
and contagious. This is a true but
not very enticing picture of the purgatory
of marriage, a hundred times
worse than the purgatory of the
Catholic Church, which after a longer
or shorter time leads to heaven.
This other only leads through a
long, sorrowful life, to death at the
last.

[Pg 283]

CHAPTER XI.

PARADISE.

They
had been seated near each
other for some time on the same sofa,
not in the voluptuous atmosphere of
desire, but in a calm and ingenuous
admiration of each other.

They had no desires, for all were
satisfied, but they were not indifferent
nor were they weary, for the light of
love shown eternally in their heaven;
twilights of laughing morn or melancholy
sundowns, but never night.
True faithful love knows no darkness.
When the planetary sun sinks
in the west there are lighted for true

[Pg 284]

lovers the many-coloured lamps of
an electric beacon, which, like an iridescent
rainbow, joins sundown to
dawn.

On her knees, as if in a sweet
doze, a volume of Musset was lying
half open, and her right hand was
more than pressed, it was grasped, in
his left. She had read several pages
of the great poet aloud, as only she
knew how to read, pointing those
immortal verses with the passionate
accent of one who reading loves, and
loving reads. At that inspired reading
he had been always silent, but
low and frequent sighs told her that
through those hands closed in such
close embrace there crept a tremor of
high and perfect happiness. The current
of her touch said to him softly:

[Pg 285]

âListen, dear, how beautiful it is!â

And his answered hers with a
tremor:

âThank you, dearest!â

Then all at once, without her having
said, âI am tired!â or his having
said, âThat is enough!â the book
had fallen on her knees and they
gazed into each otherâs eyes.

In fact, these two happy beings
were nothing but eyes, open, wide
open, to drink in all the light that
emanated from their souls: eyes
moistened with tears which did not
fall on their cheeks, but were absorbed
as by an invisible sponge
which conveyed them to the heart.
Had anyone been present he would
have heard a double
tic-tac
in unison,
the harmony of two notes, one high

[Pg 286]

and one low, the divine music of
two souls who converse without
words.

Her eyes were sweet, tender, and
very mild; they appeared as if they
were dissolving in the dew of paradise.
His eyes lightened, were ardent and
fiery, drinking in the paradisean ambrosia
of her pupils.

Tremour of the frame, contraction
of clasped hands, and lightning from
their eyes accorded harmoniously
with the
tic-tac
of two hearts bound
together; the whole an ecstasy of two
existences, which are at one in the
pores of the skin, the nerves of the
soul, the muscles of the will.

Was it voluptuousness?

No, it was bliss.

Was it lasciviousness?

[Pg 287]

No, something less than all those;
only two lives fused into one.

After a sigh from both a spark
darted from those eyes; and from
those lips there came at the same
moment, as if a signal had been
given, these words:

âOh, how handsome you are!â

âOh, how lovely you are!â

â

They had been married for three
years, and not the slightest cloud
had obscured the heaven of their
happiness. When, during the first
months, she had drawn a deep sigh
and said to him,

âOh, my Carlo, how happy we are!â

He, as if seized with a mysterious
fear, had answered her:

[Pg 288]

âNo, Teresa, do not say so! It
seems as if it must bring misfortune.
When God sees a man happy
he judges him as standing in contravention
of human and divine laws,
and whispers to him that terrible dictum
which one sees promulgated everywhere
in England against those who
violate regulations:
You will be prosecuted
.
Just imagine if instead of one
happy person he should find two!
The penalty must be doubled.â

She blushed and smiled. She did
not believe at all in that form of
superstition, but willingly obeyed, and
for some time did not say:

âCarlo, how happy we are!â

This did not prevent their being so.
One day, however, she repeated the
happy exclamation, for which she felt

[Pg 289]

the real necessity in order to relieve
the fulness of her heart.

Carlo closed her mouth with his
hand, but this time she resisted, and
almost for fun repeated the same
words ten times:

âYou will see that no harm will
come to us.â

And, in fact, the most complete
bliss continued to shine in the blue
heavens of those two happy ones.
They were two and they were one;
but sometimes, sighing, they had
said:

âWhy are we not three?â

It was he really who had said so;
and she then blushed and hung her
head, sighing:

âYou are right, Carlo; our happiness
is too great for two alone;

[Pg 290]

divided among three it would be
better.â

âBut the third, Teresa, ought to be
tiny, tinyâso, look,â and he opened
the palm of his hand to show the
length that this third partner in their
happiness ought to be.

This discourse, however, did not
please Teresa, and after a forced smile
she kissed Carlo and gave him a pat
on the cheek, and said in a shame-faced
way, and with an unsteady
voice:

âYou know it is not my fault.â

âI know it is not the fault of either
of us, we love each other so much.
But do not worry any more about
it; we can be happy even if we are
only two.â

And from that day they had never

[Pg 291]

referred again to the third being, who
was to be a span long, and was to share
their felicity.

But both of them thought of it constantly.
It was not a cloud which
covered the sun, but a light mist which
dimmed it.

One day when he was in his study
busy writing she ran in as if she had
something very urgent to say to him;
then instead, when halfway in the
room, she stood still.

âWhat is it, Teresa?â

âI have good and delightful news
for you.â

âReally?â

She smiled and blushed, and with
little timid, hesitating steps, as if she
had some fault to confess, she came
close to the writing table, embraced

[Pg 292]

Carlo, and hid her head on his
shoulder. She still kept silence and
her face was hidden.

In vain he endeavoured to move her
away that he might see her face.
He thought he guessed, but still
feared he might be deceiving himself.

âIs it true, then, really true, my
dear, dear Teresa?â

With a sudden courage she took
one of his hands and placed it on her
heart.

âListen, Carlo, there are three of
us.â

He rose suddenly, agitated, embraced
her, and kissed her a hundred
times on the eyes, cheeks, hair, mouth,
everywhere, interrupting his kisses
with sighs of joy.

[Pg 293]

âThanks, thanks, my adored one.â

They continued to be happy, and
to call themselves so, without fear that
God would know it, consider them in
contravention, and murmur in their
ears:

You will be prosecuted.

â

They had not seen each other for
eight days! He had been obliged to
leave her alone on account of urgent
business.

Eight daysâthat is eight centuries!
He had written eight times, she ten,
for on one day which seemed longer
than the others she had written three
times, in the three different languages
she knew.

In the last, written in English in

[Pg 294]

the evening, she finished with these
words: âWhy do I not know seven
languages? Then I should have written
seven times to you to-day, because
the same thing said in different languages
seems different, and renews
my joy in thinking of you. I should
like to say I love you in all the
languages in the world....â

At last he telegraphed his arrival,
and she had been an hour at the
station, walking up and down by the
deserted rails.

She looked at her watch, then at
the station clock; it seemed to her
as if it must have stopped, so much
like centuries did those minutes
appear.

With her most pleasant smile she
went to one of the officials:

[Pg 295]

âIs the train from Genoa late?â

âYes, about ten minutes.â

How cruel those four words were!
How she condemned in her heart
Italian railways, engine drivers, directors,
and shareholders, who by their
negligence had inflicted another ten
minutes upon her anxious waiting.
She drew near the kiosk of newspapers
and books, but without looking
at anything; she bought flowers,
but did not smell them; she kept her
eyes turned toward Genoa, strained
her ears, bit her lips, but the train
came not.

In a moment a thousand fears
flashed through her mindâthe remembrance
of the last collision, the many
killed and injuredââââ

She did not dare to go to the same

[Pg 296]

official. She went to another, timid
and full of fears. This time she did
not succeed in smiling.

âIs the train from Genoa still
late?â

âYes, ten minutes; it will be here
in five minutes now.â

Shortly after a whistle was heard,
then a low and heavy vibration of
the rails, a great column of smoke
appeared, then the heavy wheels rolled
under the roof of the station.

She ran from one carriage to another,
impatient and anxious; he was
not there.

Travellers alighted in crowds. He
was not there.

Her heart beat fast, she did not
know what to do. She turned her
back to the train and walked toward

[Pg 297]

the station master without knowing
what she ought to say, or even could
say to him.

But she had no need of him, for
she felt herself clasped closely by
two loving arms.

It was he, it was Carlo!

The eight days of agony, the
seventy minutes of anxiety, all were
forgotten, all submerged in a sea
of infinite sweetness.

They said nothing until they were
in the carriage, and whilst they
drove to their happy home she,
kissing him a hundred times, exclaimed:

âDo you know, I love you more
than you love me?â

âBut why?â

âBecause I have written ten times

[Pg 298]

to you, and you only eight times
to me.â

âWell, next time I will write
twenty times to you.â

âNo, no. I do not want even
one letter. Another time, if you will
let me, I will come with you. I will
not be away from you; I cannot
bear it.â

â

They were seated at table at the
usual hour, calm and happy, with
no one but themselves.

They never sat facing each other,
but side by side, because even during
meal times they felt the necessity
of caressing and kissing each other.

Toward the middle of dinner she
said, all at once, as if the words had
been held back, and were now forced

[Pg 299]

from her by some internal and
invisible spring:

âDo you know that Lieutenant
B. came again at five this evening
to pay me a visit?â

âWell?â

âIt is the third time in one
week.â

âIndeed!â

âYes, he always comes at the
hours when he knows you are at
the office.â

âPerhaps he is not free at any
other hour.â

âListen, Paolo, you take it too
indifferently. I think, however, that
in this case you ought to think
more of it.â

âBut what does the lieutenant say
to you?â

[Pg 300]

âAs you may believe, he has never
failed in respect toward meâbut
when there are no other visitors
he looks at me too persistently,
and says the most innocently polite
things, but in too warm a tone.â

âLieutenant B. is my friend, and
a perfect gentleman. He has but
just come to Modena, and knows
nobody. It is only natural that he
should pay visits to the wife of his
old friend and fellow-student.â

âIn short, you are satisfied that he
should come here three times a week
to see me, stay more than an hour,
look at me and tell me I am beautiful.â

âI do not believe he has gone
beyond thatâanyhow I will beg him
to come in the evening, when I also
am at home.â

[Pg 301]

âNo, that would be to show
some mistrust, which, so far, he has
not deserved. I will tell my maid
to say, once or twice, that I am
out, and then he will change the
hour of his visits.â

âDo what you think best, dear
one, and I will do whatever you
desire to calm your fears about this
gallant lieutenant. But do you really
wish to be more of a royalist than
the king, and to disquiet yourself
when I am not disquieted?â

âBut, Paolo, I am sorry that you
are not more concerned. It is not
only on account of the lieutenant
that I speak, but of all those who
at the theatre, at home, and in society
think me beautiful, say so, and
pay me too much court. In short,

[Pg 302]

my own Paolo, shall I tell you? I
should like to see you a little more
jealous of me.â

At this point Paolo put down
his knife and fork, fell back in his
chair, and began to laugh so heartily,
so full of merriment, and so
loudly that it made her laugh as
well.

âA hundred wives complain of the
jealousy of their husbands, and I
have one who deplores my want
of it.â

âNo, Paolo, do not laugh. This
indifference of yours makes me think
you do not love me, and that it
does not matter to you at all if
others pay me too much attention,
and that wounds me.â

âDear one, dearest of my treasures,

[Pg 303]

to please you I will become
jealous too.â

âA littleânot too much.â

âA littleâhow much, for example?
So? two fingers, three fingers, half a
metre?â

âNo, do not make fun of me.
You know how much I love you;
you know you are my very life, that
without you I should die. Everything
I say to you proceeds from
the immense love I bear you. I, you
see, am jealous of you.â

âBut not I of you, for I esteem
you too much, and should fear to
offend you by any doubts. A woman
can always protect herself without
the aid of an ally; and when she
has a husband whom she loves and
esteems he supports her in the course

[Pg 304]

of attacks, menaces, and gallantry.
And together they defend their
own honour and felicity.â

âYes, dear, you have every reason
in the world ... but to make me
happy, be a little jealous.â

âYes, dear, you shall teach me
the way to become so.â

And then those two happy creatures
interrupted their dinner to throw
themselves into each otherâs arms,
and make peace after this trivial
battle.

He had loosened her handkerchief
and had covered her neck with a
whole string of kisses.

âSee, Nina, I am jealous of this
handkerchief which kisses your shoulders
all through the day, and so I take
its place. Do you not see, Nina,

[Pg 305]

that I begin to obey you? I am
taking the first lesson in jealousy.â

â

They were both leaning on the
sill of a window which looked
toward the sea. It was late, and
the stars sparkled in a sky which
was not yet dark, but no longer
blue.

No sound was heard save the murmur
of the breeze among the palm
leaves and the distant flow of the
waves as they kissed the shore.

They did not speak; but the arm
of one entwined in that of the other
spoke with the hand the words for
which the lips were silent.

A perfume of jasmine, pungent
and voluptuous, rose from the garden

[Pg 306]

and intoxicated those two. They
were happy.

She interrupted the long silence:

âDearest, even when you look at
the sky and the sea do you not believe
in God, in another life?â

He did not answer, but, sighing,
pressed her hand still more firmly.

âAfter all, if you will let me say
so, this negation of yours of all that
reason cannot understand is nothing
but pride pure and simple.â

He was still silent and answered
with another pressure of the hand,
longer, more tender, and more passionate.

âThe ants come into life and die
without knowing man or understanding
him. Still man exists; and why
cannot we be so many ants to another

[Pg 307]

being more man, more god, more
angel than we are?â

And still no answer. His hands
only answered with increasing tenderness.

âBut speak, my treasure; say something
to me.â

Here his obstinately closed lips
opened:

âBut
Dr. Faust
has already answered
them in divine words to the

Margaret
of Goethe.â

âThey may be divine words, if
you will; but they do not please me
at all.
Faust
answers one interrogation
with another. He answers like
the ancient sybil.â

âAnd in what other way can a man
answer the problem, To be, or not to
be? A dogmatic answer might be

[Pg 308]

an offence to reason, and I hate to
confess I believe in something I do
not understand.â

âPride, pride, always pride; your
modern science is entirely leavened
with it.â

âAnd your faith with superstition.â

âNo, my love, I do not wish to
force my faith upon you; but believe
something, make a faith for yourself,
but do not tell me we shall not live
even after death.â

âYes, my treasure, I also have my
faith. Give me a kiss.â

They kissed each other so long and
so warmly that their kiss was the
loudest sound heard in the deep surrounding
stillness.

âSee, I believe in your love. I
believe in the joy you give me. If

[Pg 309]

you will, I also believe that our souls
at this moment have come to our lips
from the very depths of our being and
have melted in an ecstasy of love.â

âWell, and must these poor souls die
with the bodies which inclose them?â

âAh, who knows?â

âThen you doubt your own
doubts?â

âListen, love; I am going to make
a confession; but say nothing of it
to any living soul, for men would
laugh at me. For them supreme
wisdom consists in never changing
an opinion or turning again to any
faith, although nature changes its
course every day, and progress itself
is but a negation of what has happened
yesterday. Before knowing you I
believed in nothing, but now the

[Pg 310]

idea that we could not meet again
in heaven is unsupportable, and I
hopeâââââ

âMy treasure, if you hope you are
halfway on the road which leads to
faith.â

âAnd with you and for you who
knows but I may gain it some day.
To-day leave me halfway on the
road.â

â

She put her arms round his neck
and kissed him anew, and with more
length than before.

The kiss, however, this time made
no sound, and nothing was heard in
the deep surrounding stillness, but the
breeze amongst the palm leaves and
the ebb and flow of the waves on the
shore.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE

LOVE’S LANGUAGE

When silence flees before the voice of Love,

Of what expression does that god approve?

Is dulcet song or flowing verse his choice,

Or stately prose, made regal by his voice?

Speaks Love in couplets, or in epics grand?

And is Love humble, or does he command?

There is no language that Love does not
speak:

To-day commanding and to-morrow meek,

One hour laconic and the next verbose,

With hope triumphant and with doubt morose,

His varying moods all forms of speech employ.

To give expression to his painful joy,

p.
vi
To voice the phases of his joyful pain,

He rings the changes on the poet’s strain.

Yet not in epic, epigram or verse

Can Love the passion of his heart rehearse.

All speech, all language, is inadequate,

There are no words with Love commensurate.

THE LAND
BETWEEN

Between the little Here and larger Yonder,

There is a realm (or so one day I read)

Where faithful spirits love-enchained may wander,

Till some remembering soul from earth has fled.

Then, reunited, they go forth afar,

From sphere to sphere, where wondrous angels are.

Not many spirits in that realm are waiting;

Not many pause upon its shores to rest;

For only love, intense and unabating,

Can hold them from the longer, higher quest.

And after grief has wept itself to sleep,

Few hearts on earth their vital memories keep.

Should I pass on, across the mystic border,

Let thy love link me to that pallid land;

I would not seek the heavens of finer order

Until thy barque had left this coarser strand.

p. 2
How desolate
such journeyings would be,

Though straight to Him, were they not shared by thee.

Wert thou first called (dear God, how could I
bear it?)

I should enchain thee with my love, I know.

Not great enough am I to free thy spirit

From all these tender ties, and bid thee go.

Nor would a soul, unselfish as thine own,

Forget so soon, and speed to heaven alone.

On earth we find no joy in ways diverging;

How could we find it in the worlds unseen?

I know old memories from my bosom surging,

Would keep thee waiting in that Land Between,

Until together, side by side, we trod

A path of stars, in our great search for God.

p.
3
LOVE’S MIRAGE

Midway upon the route, he paused athirst

And suddenly across the wastes of heat,

He saw cool waters gleaming, and a sweet

Green oasis upon his vision burst.

A tender dream, long in his bosom nursed,

Spread love’s illusive verdure for his
feet;

The barren sands changed into golden wheat;

The way grew glad that late had seemed accursed.

She shone, the woman wonder, on his soul;

The garden spot, for which men toil and wait;

The house of rest, that is each
heart’s demand;

But when, at last, he reached the gleaming goal,

He found, oh, cruel irony of fate,

But desert sun upon the desert
sand.

p. 4
THE NEED
OF THE WORLD

I know the need of the world,

Though it would not have me know.

It would hide its sorrow deep,

Where only God may go.

Yet its secret it can not keep;

It tells it awake, or asleep,

It tells it to all who will heed,

And he who runs may read.

The need of the world I know.

I know the need of the world,

When it boasts of its wealth the loudest,

When it flaunts it in all men’s eyes,

When its mien is the gayest and proudest.

Oh! ever it lies—it lies,

For the sound of its laughter dies

In a sob and a smothered moan,

And it weeps when it sits alone.

The need of the world I know.

p.
5
I know the need of the world.

When the earth shakes under the tread

Of men who march to the fight,

When rivers with blood are red

And there is no law but might,

And the wrong way seems the right;

When he who slaughters the most

Is all men’s pride and boast.

The need of the world I know.

I know the need of the world.

When it babbles of gold and fame,

It is only to lead us astray

From the thing that it dare not name,

For this is the sad world’s way.

Oh! poor blind world grown grey

With the need of a thing so near,

With the want of a thing so dear.

The need of the world I know.

The need of the world is love.

Deep under the pride of power,

Down under its lust of greed,

For the joys that last but an hour,

There lies forever its need.

p. 6
For love is
the law and the creed

And love is the unnamed goal

Of life, from man to the mole.

Love is the need of the world.

p. 7
THE GULF
STREAM

Skilled mariner, and counted sane and wise,

That was a curious thing which chanced to me,

So good a sailor on so fair a
sea.

With favouring winds and blue unshadowed skies,

Led by the faithful beacon of Love’s eyes,

Past reef and shoal, my life-boat bounded free

And fearless of all changes that might be

Under calm waves, where many a sunk rock lies.

A golden dawn; yet suddenly my barque

Strained at the sails, as in a cyclone’s
blast;

And battled with an unseen
current’s force,

For we had entered when the night was dark

That old tempestuous Gulf Stream of the Past.

But for love’s eyes, I had
not kept the course.

p.
8
REMEMBERED

His art was loving; Eres set his sign

Upon that youthful forehead, and he drew

The hearts of women, as the sun
draws dew.

Love feeds love’s thirst as wine feeds love of wine;

Nor is there any potion from the vine

Which makes men drunken like the subtle brew

Of kisses crushed by kisses; and he grew

Inebriated with that draught divine.

Yet in his sober moments, when the sun

Of radiant summer paled to lonely fall,

And passion’s sea had grown
an ebbing tide,

From out the many, Memory singled one

Full cup that seemed the sweetest of them
all—

The warm red mouth that mocked
him and denied
.

p. 9
HELEN OF
TROY

ON THE ISLE OF CRANAE

The world an abject vassal to her charms,

And kings competing for a single smile,

Yet love she knew not, till upon this isle

She gave surrender to abducting arms.

Not Theseus, who plucked her lips’ first kiss,

Not Menelaus, lawful mate and spouse,

Such answering passion in her heart could rouse,

Or wake such tumult in her soul as this.

Let come what will, let Greece and Asia meet,

Let heroes die and kingdoms run with gore;

Let devastation spread from shore to shore—

Resplendent Helen finds her bondage sweet.

The whole world fights her battles, while she lies

Sunned in the fervour of young Paris’ eyes.

p. 10
ON THE
ISLE OF RHODES

The battles ended, ardent Paris dead,

Of faithful Menelaus long bereft,

Time is the only suitor who is left:

Helen survives, with youth and beauty fled.

By hate remembered, but by love forgot,

Dethroned and driven from her high estate,

Unhappy Helen feels the lash of Fate

And knows at last an unloved woman’s lot.

The Grecian marvel, and the Trojan joy,

The world’s fair wonder, from her palace
flies

The furies follow, and great Helen dies,

A death of horror, for the pride of Troy.

* * * * *

Yet Time, like Menelaus, all forgives.

Helen, immortal in her beauty, lives.

p. 11
LAIS
WHEN YOUNG

Lais when young, and all her charms in
flower,

Lais, whose beauty was the fateful light

That led great ships to anchor in
the night

And bring their priceless cargoes to her bower,

Lais yet found her cup of sweet turned sour.

Great Plato’s pupil, from his lofty height,

Zenocrates, unmoved, had seen the white

Sweet wonder of her, and defied her power.

She snared the world in nets of subtle
wiles:

The proud, the famed, all clamoured at her gate;

Dictators plead, inside her
portico;

Wisdom sought madness, in her favouring smiles;

Now was she made the laughing-stock of fate:

One loosed her clinging arms, and
bade her go.

p. 12
LAIS
WHEN OLD

Lais, when old and all her beauty gone,

Lais, the erstwhile courted pleasure queen,

Walked homeless through Corinth.

One mocked her mien—

One tossed her coins; she took them and passed on.

Down by the harbour sloped a terraced lawn,

Where fountains played; she paused to view the
scene.

A marble palace stood in bowers of green

’Twas here of old she revelled till the dawn.

Through yonder portico her lovers
came—

Hero and statesman, athlete, merchant, sage;

They flung the whole world’s
treasures at her feet

To buy her favour and exalt her shame.

* * * * *

She spat upon her dole of coins in rage

And faded like a phantom down the street.

p.
13
EXISTENCE

You are here, and you are wanted,

Though a waif upon life’s stair;

Though the sunlit hours are haunted

With the shadowy shapes of care.

Still the Great One, the All-Seeing

Called your spirit into being—

Gave you strength for any fate.

Since your life by Him was needed,

All your ways by Him are heeded—

You can trust and you can wait.

You can wait to know the meaning

Of the troubles sent your soul;

Of the chasms intervening

’Twixt your purpose and your goal;

Of the sorrows and the trials,

Of the silence and denials,

Ofttimes answering to your pleas;

Of the stinted sweets of pleasure,

And of pain’s too generous measure—

You can wait the
why
of these.

p.
14
Forth from planet unto planet,

You have gone, and you will go.

Space is vast, but we must span it;

For life’s purpose is
to know
.

Earth retains you but a minute,

Make the best of what lies in it;

Light the pathway where you are.

There is nothing worth the doing

That will leave regret or rueing,

As you speed from star to star.

You are part of the Beginning,

You are parcel of To-day.

When He set His world to spinning

You were flung upon your way.

When the system falls to pieces,

When this pulsing epoch ceases,

When the
is
becomes the
was
,

You will live, for you will enter

In the great Creative Centre,

In the All-Enduring Cause.

HOLIDAY SONGS

I

Sailing away on a summer sea,

Out of the bleak March weather;

Drifting away for a loaf and play,

Just you and I together;

And it’s good-bye worry and good-bye hurry

And never a care have we;

With the sea below and the sun above

And nothing to do but dream and love,

Sailing away together.

Sailing away from the grim old town

And tasks the town calls duty;

Sailing away from walls of grey

To a land of bloom and beauty,

And it’s good-bye to letters from our lessers and our
betters,

p. 16
To the
cold world’s smile or its frown.

We sail away on a sunny track

To find the summer and bring it back

And love is our only duty.

II

Afloat on a sea of passion

Without a compass or chart,

But the glow of your eye shows the sun is high,

By the sextant of my heart.

I know we are nearing the tropics

By the languor that round us lies,

And the smile on your mouth says the course is south

And the port is Paradise.

We have left grey skies behind us,

We sail under skies of blue;

You are off with me on lovers’ sea,

And I am away with you.

We have not a single sorrow,

And I have but one fear—

That my lips may miss one offered kiss

From the mouth that is smiling near.

p.
17
There is no land of winter;

There is no world of care;

There is bloom and mirth all over the earth,

And love, love everywhere.

Our boat is the barque of Pleasure,

And whatever port we sight

The touch of your hand will make the land

The Harbour of Pure Delight.

p.
18
ASTROLABIUS

(THE CHILD OF ABELARD AND
HELOISE)

I

I wrenched from a passing comet in its
flight,

By that great force of two mad hearts aflame,

A soul incarnate, back to earth you came,

To glow like star-dust for a little night.

Deep shadows hide you wholly from our sight;

The centuries leave nothing but your name,

Tinged with the lustre of a splendid shame,

That blazed oblivion with rebellious light.

The mighty passion that became your cause,

Still burns its lengthening path across the
years;

We feel its raptures, and we see its tears

And ponder on its retributive laws.

Time keeps that deathless story ever new;

Yet finds no answer, when we ask of you.

p.
19
II

At Argenteuil, I saw the lonely cell

Where Heloise dreamed through her broken rest,

That baby lips pulled at her undried breast.

It needed but my woman’s heart to tell

Of those long vigils and the tears that fell

When aching arms reached out in fruitless quest,

As after flight, wings brood an empty nest.

(So well I know that sorrow, ah, so well.)

Across the centuries there comes no sound

Of that vast anguish; not one sigh or word

Or echo of the mother loss has stirred,

The sea of silence, lasting and profound.

Yet to each heart, that once has felt this grief,

Sad Memory restores Time’s missing leaf.

III

But what of you?  Who took the
mother’s place

When sweet expanding love its object sought?

Was there a voice to tell her tragic lot,

And did you ever look upon her face?

p. 20
Was yours
a cloistered seeking after grace?

Or in the flame of adolescent thought

Were Abelard’s departed passions caught

To burn again in you and leave their trace?

Conceived in nature’s bold primordial
way

(As in their revolutions, suns create),

You came to earth, a soul immaculate,

Baptized in fire, with some great part to play.

What was that part, and wherefore hid from us,

Immortal mystery, Astrolabius!

p.
21
COMPLETION

When I shall meet God’s generous
dispensers

Of all the riches in the heavenly store,

Those lesser gods, who act as Recompensers

For loneliness and loss upon this shore,

Methinks abashed, and somewhat hesitating,

My soul its wish and longing will declare.

Lest they reply: ‘Here are no bounties waiting:

We gave on earth, your portion and your
share.’

Then shall I answer: ‘Yea, I do
remember

The many blessings to my life allowed;

My June was always longer than December,

My sun was always stronger than my cloud,

My joy was ever deeper than my sorrow,

My gain was ever greater than my loss,

My yesterday seemed less than my to-morrow,

The crown looked always larger than the cross.

p.
22
‘I have known love, in all its radiant
splendour,

It shone upon my pathway to the end.

I trod no road that did not bloom with tender

And fragrant blossoms, planted by some friend.

And those material things we call successes,

In modest measure, crowned my earthly lot.

Yet was there one sweet happiness that blesses

The life of woman, which to me came not.

‘I knew the hope of motherhood; a
season

I felt a fluttering heart beat ’neath my
own;

A little cry—then silence.  For that reason

I dare, to you, my only wish make known.

The babe who grew to angelhood in heaven,

I never watched unfold from child to man.

And so I ask, that unto me be given

That motherhood, which was God’s primal
plan.

‘All womankind He meant to share its
glories;

He meant us all to nurse our babes to rest.

To croon them songs, to tell them sleepy stories,

Else why the wonder of a woman’s breast?

He must provide for all earth’s cheated mothers

In His vast heavens of shining sphere on sphere,

And with my son, there must be many others—

My spirit children who will claim me here.

p.
23
‘Fair creatures by my loving thoughts
created—

Too finely fashioned for a mortal birth—

Between the borders of two worlds they waited

Until they saw my spirit leave the earth.

In God’s great nursery they must be waiting

To welcome me with many an infant wile.

Now let me go and satisfy this longing

To mother children for a little while.’

p.
24
SLEEP’S TREACHERY

As the grey twilight, tiptoed down the deep

And shadowy valley, to the day’s dark end,

She whom I thought my ever-faithful friend,

Fair-browed, calm-eyed and mother-bosomed Sleep,

Met me with smiles.  ‘Poor longing heart, I keep

Sweet joy for you,’ she murmured.
‘I will send

One whom you love, with your own soul to blend

In visions, as the night hours onward creep.’

I trusted her; and watched by starry beams,

I slumbered soundly, free from all alarms.

Then not my love, but one long
banished came,

Led by false Sleep, down secret stairs of dreams

And clasped me, unresisting in fond arms.

Oh, treacherous sleep—to
sell me to such shame!

p. 25
ART

VERSUS
CUPID

[
A room in a private house
.
A maiden sitting
before a fire meditating
.]

Maiden

Now have I fully fixed upon my part.

Good-bye to dreams; for me a life of art!

Beloved art!  Oh, realm serene and fair,

Above the mean and sordid world of care,

Above earth’s small ambitions and desires!

Art! art! the very word my soul inspires!

From foolish memories it sets me free.

Not what has been, but that which is to be

Absorbs me now.  Adieu to vain regret!

The bow is tensely drawn—the target set.

[
A knock at the door
.]

Maid

(
aside
)

The night is dark and chill; the hour is
late.

p. 26
(
Aloud
)

Who knocks upon my door?

A Voice Outside

’Tis I, your fate!

Maid

Thou dost deceive, not me, but thine own
self.

My fate is not a wandering, vagrant elf.

My fate is here, within this throbbing heart

That beats alone for glory, and for art.

Voice

[
Another knock at door
.]

Pray, let me in; I am so faint and cold.

[
Door is pushed ajar
.
Enter

Cupid
,
who approaches the fire with
outstretched hands
.]

Maid

(
indignantly
)

Methinks thou art not faint, however cold,

But rather too courageous, and most bold;

Surprisingly ill-mannered, sir, and rude,

Without an invitation to intrude

Into my very presence.

p. 27
Cupid

(
warming his hands
)

But, you see,

Girls never mind a little chap like me.

They’re always watching for me on the sly,

And hoping I will call.

Maid

(
haughtily
)

Indeed, not I!

My heart has listened to a sweeter voice,

A clarion call that gives command—not choice.

And I have answered to that call, ‘I come’;

To other voices shall my ears be dumb.

To art alone I consecrate my life—

Art is my spouse, and I his willing wife.

Cupid

(
slowly
,
gazing in the grate
)

Art is a sultan, and you must divide

His love with many another ill-fed bride.

Now I know one who worships you alone.

Maid

(
impatiently
)

I will not listen! for the dice is thrown

And art has won me.  On my brow some day

Shall rest the laurel wreath—

p. 28
Cupid

(
sitting down and looking at

Maid

critically
)

Just let me say

I think sweet orange blossoms under lace

Are better suited to your type of face.

Maid

(
ignoring interruption
)

I yet shall stand before an audience

That listens as one mind, absorbed, intense,

And with my genius I shall rouse its cheers,

Still it to silence, soften it to tears,

Or wake its laughter.  Oh, the play! the play!

The play’s the thing!  My boy,
the play
!!

Cupid

(
suddenly clapping his hands
)

Oh, say!

I know a splendid role for you to take,

And one that always keeps the house awake—

And calls for pretty dressing.  Oh, it’s great!

Maid

(
excitedly
)

Well, well, what is it?  Wherefore make me
wait?

Cupid

(
tapping his brow
,
thoughtfully
)

How is it those lines run—oh, now I
know;

You make a stately entrance—measured—slow—

p. 29
To
stirring music, then you kneel and say

Something about—to honour and obey—

For better and for worse—till death do part.

Maid

(
angrily
)

Be still, you foolish boy; that is not

art
.

Cupid

(
seriously
)

She needs great skill who takes the role of
wife

In God’s stupendous drama human life.

Maid

(
suddenly becoming serious
)

So I once thought!  Oh, once my very
soul

Was filled and thrilled with dreaming of that role.

Life seemed so wonderful; it held for me

No purpose, no ambition, but to be

Loving and loved.  My highest thought of fame

Was some day bearing my dear lover’s name.

Alone, I ofttimes uttered it aloud,

Or wrote it down, half timid, and all proud

To see myself lost utterly in him:

As some small star might joy in growing dim

When sinking in the sun; or as the dew,

Forgetting the brief little life it knew

In space, might on the ocean’s bosom fall

And ask for nothing—only to give all.

p. 30
Cupid

(
aside
)

Now,
that’s
the
talk—it’s music to my ear

After that stuff on ‘art’ and a
‘career.’

I hope she’ll keep it up.

Maiden

(
continuing her reverie
)

Again my dream

Shaped into changing pictures.  I would seem

To see myself in beautiful array

Move down the aisle upon my wedding day;

And then I saw the modest living-room

With lighted lamp, and fragrant plants in bloom,

And books and sewing scattered all about,

And just we two alone.

Cupid

(
in glee aside
)

There’s not a doubt

I’ll land her yet!

Maiden

My dream kaleidoscope

Changed still again, and framed love’s dearest
hope—

The trinity of home; and life was good

And all its deepest meaning understood.

p.

[
Sits lost in a dream
.
Behind scenes a
voice sings a lullaby
, ‘
Beautiful Land of
Nod
.’
Cupid

in
ecstasy tiptoes about and clasps his hands in delight
.]

Another scene! a matron in her prime,

I saw myself glide peacefully with time

Into the quiet middle years, content

With simple joys the dear home circle lent.

My sons and daughters made my diadem;

I saw my happy youth renewed in them.

The pain of growing old lost all its sting,

For Love stood near—in Winter, as in Spring.

[
Cupid

tiptoes to door and makes
a signal
.
Maiden

starts
up dramatically
.]

’Twas but a dream!  I woke all
suddenly.

The world had changed!  And now life means to me

My art—the stage—excitement and the crowd—

The glare of many foot-lights—and the loud

Applause of men, as I cry in rage,

‘Give me the dagger!’ or creep down the stage

In that sleep-walking scene.  Oh, art like mine

Will send the chills down every listener’s spine!

And when I choose, salt tears shall freely flow

As in the moonlight I cry, ‘Romeo!  Romeo!

p. 32
Oh,
wherefore art thou, Romeo?’

Ay, ’tis
done

My dream of home life.

Cupid

It
is but begun.

Maiden

The heart but once can dream a dream so
fair,

And so henceforth love thoughts I do forswear;

Since faith in love has crumbled to the dust,

In fame alone, I put my hope and trust.

[
Cupid

at the door beckons
excitedly
.
Enter lover with outstretched
arms
.]

Cupid

Here’s one who will explain yourself to
you

And make that old sweet dream of love come true.

Fix up your foolish quarrel; time is brief—

So waste no more of it in doubt or grief.

[
The lovers meet and embrace
.]

Cupid

(
in doorway
)

Warm lip to lip, and heart to beating heart,

The cast is made—My Lady has her part.

THE
REVOLT OF VASHTI

(FROM THE DRAMA OF MIZPAH)

Ahasueras

Is this the way to greet thy loving spouse,

But now returned from scenes of blood and strife?

I pray thee raise thy veil and let me gaze

Upon that beauty which hath greater power

To conquer me than all the arts of war!

Vashti

My beauty!  Ay, my
beauty
!  I
do hold,

In thy regard, no more an honoured place

Than yonder marble pillar, or the gold

And jewelled wine-cup which thy lips caress.

Thou wouldst degrade me in the people’s sight!

Ahasueras

Degrade thee, Vashti?  Rather do I seek

To show my people who are gathered here

p. 34
How, as
the consort of so fair a queen,

I feel more pride than as the mighty king:

For there be many rulers on the earth,

But only
one
such queen.  Come, raise thy veil!

Vashti

Ay! only
one
such queen!  A queen
is one

Who shares her husband’s greatness and his throne.

I am no more than yonder dancing girl

Who struts and smirks before a royal court!

But I will loose my veil and loose my tongue!

Now listen, sire—my master and my king;

And let thy princes and the court give ear!

’Tis time all heard how Vashti feels her shame.

Ahasueras

Shame is no word to couple with thy name!

Shame and a spotless woman may not meet,

Even in a sentence.  Choose another word.

Vashti

Ay,
shame
, my lord—there is no
synonym

That can give voice to my ignoble state.

To be a thing for eyes to gaze upon,

Yet held an outcast from thy heart and mind;

p. 35
To hear my
beauty praised but not my worth;

To come and go at Pleasure’s beck and call,

While barred from Wisdom’s conclaves!  Think ye

that

A noble calling for a noble dame?

Why, any concubine amongst thy train

Could play my royal part as well as I—

Were she as fair!

Ahasueras

Queen
Vashti, art thou
mad
?

I would behead another did he dare

To so besmirch thee with comparison.

Vashti

(
to the court
)

Gaze now your fill!  Behold Queen
Vashti’s eyes!

How large they gleam beneath her inch of brow!

How like a great white star, her splendid face

Shines through the midnight forest of her hair!

And see the crushed pomegranate of her mouth!

Observe her arms, her throat, her gleaming breasts,

Whereon the royal jewels rise and fall!—

And note the crescent curving of her hips,

And lovely limbs suggested ’neath her robes!

p. 36
Gaze,
gaze, I say, for these have made her queen!

She hath no mind, no heart, no dignity,

Worth royal recognition and regard;

But her fair body approbation meets

And whets the sated appetite of kings!

Now ye have seen what she was bid to show.

The queen hath played her part and begs to go.

Ahasueras

Ay, Vashti, go and never more return!

Not only hast thou wronged thine own true lord,

And mocked and shamed me in the people’s eyes,

But thou hast wronged all princes and all men

By thy pernicious and rebellious ways.

Queens act and subjects imitate.  So let

Queen Vashti weigh her conduct and her words,

Or be no more called ‘queen!’

Vashti

I was a princess ere I was a queen,

And worthy of a better fate than this!

There lies the crown that made me queen in name!

Here stands the woman—wife in name alone!

Now, no more queen—nor wife—but woman still—

Ay, and a woman strong enough to be

Her own avenger.

THE
CHOOSING OF ESTHER

(FROM THE DRAMA OF MIZPAH)

Ahasueras

Tell me thy name!

Esther

My name, great sire, is Esther.

Ahasueras

So thou art Esther?  Esther! ’tis a
name

Breathed into sound as softly as a sigh.

A woman’s name should melt upon the lips

Like Love’s first kisses, and thy countenance

Is fit companion for so sweet a name!

Esther

Thou art most kind.  I would my name and
face

Were mine own making and not accident.

Then I might feel elated at thy praise,

Where now I feel confusion.

p. 38
Ahasueras

Thou hast
wit

As well as beauty, Esther.  Both are gems

That do embellish woman in man’s sight.

Yet they are gems of second magnitude!

Dost
thou
possess the one great perfect gem—

The matchless jewel of the world called
love
?

Esther

Sire, in the heart of every woman dwells

That wondrous perfect gem!

Ahasueras

Then,
Esther, speak!

And tell me what is
love
!  I fain would know

Thy definition of that much-mouthed word,

By woman most employed—least understood.

Esther

What can a humble Jewish maiden know

That would instruct a warrior and a king?

I have but dreamed of love as maidens will

While thou hast known its fulness.  All the world

Loves Great Ahasueras!

p. 39
Ahasueras

All the
world

Fears great
Ahasueras!  Kings, my child,

Are rarely loved as anything but kings.

Love, as I see it in the court and camp,

Means seeking royal favour.  I would know

How love is fashioned in a maiden’s dreams.

Esther

Sire, love seeks nothing that kings can
bestow.

Love is the king of all kings here below;

Love makes the monarch but a bashful boy,

Love makes the peasant monarch in his joy;

Love seeks not place, all places are the same,

When lighted by the radiance of love’s flame.

Who deems proud love could fawn to power and splendour

Hath known not love, but some base-born pretender.

Ahasueras

If this be love, I would know more of it.

Speak on, fair Esther!  What is love beside?

Esther

Love is in all things, all things are in
love.

Love is the earth, the sea, the skies above;

p. 40
Love is
the bird, the blossom, and the wind;

Love hath a million eyes, yet love is blind;

Love is a tempest, awful in its might;

Love is the silence of a moon-lit night;

Love is the aim of every human soul;

And he who hath not loved hath missed life’s goal!

Ahasueras

But tell me of thyself, of thine own dreams!

How wouldst thou love, and how be loved again?

Esther

Who most doth love thinks least of love’s
return;

She is content to feel the passion burn

In her own bosom, and its sacred fire

Consumes each selfish purpose and desire.

’Tis in the giving, love’s best rapture lies,

Not in the counting of the things it buys.

Ahasueras

Yet, is there not vast anguish and despair

In love that finds no answering word or smile?

Esther

So radiant is love, it lends a glow

To each dark sorrow and to every woe.

p. 41
To love
completely is to part with pain,

Nor is there mortal who can love in vain.

Love is its own reward, it pays full measure,

And in love’s sharpest grief lies subtlest pleasure.

Ahasueras

Methinks, a mighty warrior, lord or king

Must in thy fancy play the lover’s part;

None else could wake such reverential thought.

Esther

When woman loves one born of lowly state,

Her thought gives crown and sceptre to her mate;

Yet be he king, or chief of some great clan,

She loves him but as woman loves a man.

Monarch or peasant, ’tis the same, I wis

When once she gives him love’s surrendering kiss.

p.

HONEYMOON SCENE

(FROM THE DRAMA OF MIZPAH)

Ahasueras

What were thy thoughts, sweet Esther?
Something passed

Across thy face, that for a moment veiled

Thy soul from mine, and left me desolate.

Thy thoughts were not of me?

Esther

Ay,

all
of thee!

I wondered, if in truth, thou wert content

With me—thy choice.  Was there no other one

Of all who passed before thee at thy court

Whose memory pursues thee with regret?

Ahasueras

I do confess I much regret that day

And wish I could relive it.

p. 43
Esther

Oh!
My lord!

Ahasueras

Yea!  I regret those hours I wasted on

The poor procession that preceded thee.

Hadst thou come first, then all the added wealth

Of one long day of loving
thee were mine—

A boundless fortune squandered.  Though I live

To three score years and ten, as I do hope,

In wedded love beside thee, that one day

Was filched from me and cannot be restored.

Esther

And then to think how frightened and abashed

I hung outside thy gates from early morn,

Not daring to go in and meet thine eyes,

Till pitying twilight clothed me in her veil,

And evening walked beside me to thy door.

Ahasueras

So it was thou, fair thief, who stole that
day,

And made me poorer, by—how many hours?

Esther

Full eight, I think.  They seemed a
hundred then,

And now time flies a hundred times too fast.

p. 44
Ahasueras

Then eight more kisses do I claim from thee,

This very hour—first tithes of many due.

I shall exact these payments as I will,

And if they be not ready on demand,

I’ll lock thee in the prison of my arms,

Like this—and take them so—and so—and so!

Esther

But kings must think of other things than
love

And live for other aims than happiness.

I would not drag thee from thy altitude

Of mighty ruler and great conqueror

To chain thee by my side.

Ahasueras

Such
slavery

Would please me better than to conquer earth

Without thee, Esther.  I have stood on heights

And heard the cheers of multitudes below;

Have known the loneliness of being great.

Now, let me live and love thee, like a man,

Forgetting I am king—

I am content.

p. 45
Esther

Content is not the pathway to great deeds.

As man, I hold thee higher than all kings;

As king, thou must stand higher than all men

In other eyes.  Let no one say of me:

‘She spoiled his greatness by her littleness;

She made a languorous lover of a king,

And silenced war-cries on commanding lips—

With honeyed kisses; made her woman’s arms

Preferred to armour, and her couch to tents,

Until the kingdom, with no guiding hand,

Plunged down to ruin.’

Ahasueras

Thou
wouldst have me go—

So soon thy heart hath wearied?

Esther

My heart is bursting with its love for thee!

Canst thou not feel its fervour?  But great men

Need wiser guidance than a woman’s heart.

My pride in thee is equal to my love,

And I would have thee greater than thou art—

Ay, greater than all other men on earth—

Though forced long years to feed my hungry heart

p. 46
On food of
memories and wine of tears,

Wert thou but winning glory and renown.

Ahasueras

Thou art most noble, Esther; thou art fit

To be the consort of a king of kings.

But I have chewed upon ambition’s husks

And starved for love through all my manhood’s years;

And now the mighty gods have seen it fit

To spread love’s banquet and to name thee host,

May I not feast my fill?  O Esther, take

The tempting nectar of those lips away

And give me wine to rouse the brute in me,

To make me thirst for blood instead of love!

Wine!  Wine!  I say!

Esther

Ahasueras,
wait!

Methinks good music is wine turned to sound.

Here comes thy minstrel with an offering

Pressed from the ripened fruit of my fond heart.

Mine own the words and mine the melody

And may it linger longer in thine ear

Than on thy lip would stay the taste of wine.

Sing on!

p. 47
Minstrel

When from the field returning,

Love is a warrior’s yearning,

Love in his heart is burning,

Love is his dream.

Talk not to him of glory,

Speak not of faces gory,

Sing of love’s tender story,

Make it thy theme.

Sing of his lady’s tresses,

Sing of the smile that blesses,

Sing of the sweet caresses,

And yet again

Sing of fair children’s faces,

Sing of the dear home graces,

Sing till the vacant places,

Ring with thy strain.

Yet as the days go speeding,

Shall he arise unheeding

Love songs or words of pleading,

Strong in his might!

Helmet and armour wearing,

Hies he to deeds of daring,

Forth to the battle faring,

Back to the fight.

p. 48
Sing now
of ranks contending,

Sing of loud voices blending,

Sing of great warriors sending

Death to their foes!

Sing of war missiles humming,

Strike into martial drumming,

Sing of great victory coming,

As forth he goes.

Back to the battle faring,

Back into deeds of daring,

Back to the fight.

Ahasueras

No less a lover but a greater man,

A better warrior and a nobler king,

I will be from this hour for thy dear sake.

p. 49
THE
COST

God finished woman in the twilight hour

And said, ‘To-morrow thou shalt find thy place:

Man’s complement, the mother of the race—

With love the motive power—

The one compelling power.’

All night she dreamed and wondered.  With
the light

Her lover came—and then she understood

The purpose of her being.  Life was good

And all the world seemed right—

And nothing was, but right.

She had no wish for any wider sway:

By all the questions of the world unvexed,

Supremely loving and superbly sexed,

She passed upon her way—

Her feminine fair way.

p.
50
But God neglected, when He fashioned man,

To fuse the molten splendour of his mind

With that sixth sense He gave to womankind.

And so He marred His plan—

Ay, marred His own great plan.

She asked so little, and so much she gave,

That man grew selfish: and she soon became,

To God’s great sorrow and the whole world’s shame,

Man’s sweet and patient slave—

His uncomplaining slave.

Yet in the nights (oh! nights so dark and
long)

She clasped her little children to her breast

And wept.  And in her anguish of unrest

She thought upon her wrong;

She knew how great her wrong.

And one sad hour, she said unto her heart,

‘Since thou art cause of all my bitter pain,

I bid thee abdicate the throne: let brain

Rule now, and do his part—

His masterful, strong part.’

She wept no more.  By new ambition
stirred

Her ways led out, to regions strange and vast.

p. 51
Men stood
aside and watched, dismayed, aghast,

And all the world demurred—

Misjudged her, and demurred.

Still on and up, from sphere to widening
sphere,

Till thorny paths bloomed with the rose of fame.

Who once demurred, now followed with acclaim:

The hiss died in the cheer—

The loud applauding cheer.

She stood triumphant in that radiant hour,

Man’s mental equal, and competitor.

But ah! the cost! from out the heart of her

Had gone love’s motive power—

Love’s all-compelling power.

p. 52
THE
VOICE

I dreamed a Voice, of one God-authorised,

Cried loudly thro’ the world, ‘Disarm!
Disarm!’

And there was consternation in the camps;

And men who strutted under braid and lace

Beat on their medalled breasts, and wailed,
‘Undone!’

The word was echoed from a thousand hills,

And shop and mill, and factory and forge,

Where throve the awful industries of death,

Hushed into silence.  Scrawled upon the doors,

The passer read, ‘Peace bids her children starve.’

But foolish women clasped their little sons

And wept for joy, not reasoning like men.

Again the Voice commanded: ‘Now go
forth

And build a world for Progress and for Peace.

This work has waited since the earth was shaped;

But men were fighting, and they could not toil.

p. 53
The needs
of life outnumber needs of death.

Leave death with God.  Go forth, I say, and
build.’

And then a sudden, comprehensive joy

Shone in the eyes of men; and one who thought

Only of conquests and of victories

Woke from his gloomy reverie and cried,

‘Ay, come and build!  I challenge all to try.

And I will make a world more beautiful

Than Eden was before the serpent came.’

And like a running flame on western wilds,

Ambition spread from mind to listening mind,

And lo! the looms were busy once again,

And all the earth resounded with men’s toil.

Vast palaces of Science graced the world;

Their banquet tables spread with feasts of truth

For all who hungered.  Music kissed the air,

Once rent with boom of cannons.  Statues gleamed

From wooded ways, where ambushed armies hid

In times of old.  The sea and air were gay

With shining sails that soared from land to land.

A universal language of the world

Made nations kin, and poverty was known

p.
54
But as a word marked ‘obsolete,’ like
war.

The arts were kindled with celestial fire;

New poets sang so Homer’s fame grew dim;

And brush and chisel gave the wondering race

Sublimer treasures than old Greece displayed.

Men differed still; fierce argument arose,

For men are human in this human sphere;

But unarmed Arbitration stood between

And Reason settled in a hundred hours

What War disputed for a hundred years.

Oh, that a Voice, of one God-authorised

Might cry to all mankind, Disarm!  Disarm!

p.
55
GOD’S ANSWER

Once in a time of trouble and of care

I dreamed I talked with God about my pain;

With sleepland courage, daring to complain

Of what I deemed ungracious and unfair.

‘Lord, I have grovelled on my knees in prayer

Hour after hour,’ I cried; ‘yet all in
vain;

No hand leads up to heights I would attain,

No path is shown me out of my despair.’

Then answered God: ‘Three things I gave
to thee—

Clear brain, brave will, and strength of mind and
heart,

All implements divine, to shape
the way.

Why shift the burden of thy toil on Me?

Till to the utmost he has done his part

With all his might, let no man

dare
to pray.’

p. 56
THE
EDICT OF THE SEX

Two thousand years had passed since Christ was
born,

When suddenly there rose a mighty host

Of women, sweeping to a central goal

As many rivers sweep on to the sea.

They came from mountains, valleys, and from coasts,

And from all lands, all nations, and all ranks,

Speaking all languages, but thinking one.

And that one language—Peace.

‘Listen,’
they said,

And straightway was there silence on the earth,

For men were dumb with wonder and surprise.

‘Listen, O mighty masters of the world,

And hear the edict of all womankind:

Since Christ His new commandment gave to men,

Love one another
, full two thousand years

Have passed away, yet earth is red with blood.

p. 57
The strong
male rulers of the world proclaim

Their weakness, when we ask that war shall cease.

Now will the poor weak women of the world

Proclaim their strength, and say that war shall end.

Hear, then, our edict: Never from this day

Will any woman on the crust of earth

Mother a warrior.  We have sworn the oath

And will go barren to the waiting tomb

Rather than breed strong sons at war’s behest,

Or bring fair daughters into life, to bear

The pains of travail, for no end but war.

Ay! let the race die out for lack of babes

Better a dying race than endless wars!

Better a silent world than noise of guns

And clash of armies.

‘Long
we asked for peace,

And oft you promised—but to fight again.

At last you told us, war must ever be

While men existed, laughing at our plea

For the disarmament of all mankind.

Then in our hearts flamed such a mad desire

For peace on earth, as lights the world at times

With some great conflagration; and it spread

From distant land to land, from sea to sea,

p. 58
Until all
women thought as with one mind

And spoke as with one voice; and now behold!

The great Crusading Syndicate of Peace,

Filling all space with one supreme resolve.

Give us, O men, your word that war shall end:

Disarm the world, and we will give you sons—

Sons to construct, and daughters to adorn

A beautiful new earth, where there shall be

Fewer and finer people, opulence

And opportunity and peace for all.

Until you promise peace no shrill birth-cry

Shall sound again upon the aging earth.

We wait your answer.’

And the
world was still

While men considered.

p. 59
THE
WORLD-CHILD

At times I am the mother of the world;

And mine seem all its sorrows, and its fears.

That rose, which in each mother-heart is curled,

The rose of pity, opens with my tears,

And, waking in the night, I lie and hark

To the lone sobbing, and the wild alarms,

Of my World-child, a wailing in the dark:

The child I fain would shelter in my arms.

I call to it (as from another room

A mother calls, what time she cannot go):

‘Sleep well, dear world; Love hides behind this gloom.

There is no need for wakefulness or woe,

The long, long night is almost past and gone,

The day is near.’  And yet the world weeps on.

Again I follow it, throughout the day.

With anxious eyes I see it trip and fall,

p. 60
And hurt
itself in many a foolish way:

Childlike, unheeding warning word or call.

I see it grasp, and grasping, break the toys

It cried to own, then toss them on the floor

And, breathless, hurry after fancied joys

That cease to please, when added to its store.

I see the lacerations on its hands,

Made by forbidden tools; but when it weeps,

I also weep, as one who understands;

And having been a child, the memory keeps.

Ah, my poor world, however wrong thy part,

Still is there pity in my mother-heart.

p. 61
THE
HEIGHTS

I cried, ‘Dear Angel, lead me to the
heights,

And spur me to the top.’

The Angel answered, ‘Stop

And set thy house in order; make it fair

For absent ones who may be speeding there.

Then will we talk of heights.’

I put my house in order.  ‘Now lead
on!’

The Angel said, ‘Not yet;

Thy garden is beset

By thorns and tares; go weed it, so all those

Who come to gaze may find the unvexed rose;

Then will we journey on.’

I weeded well my garden.  ‘All is
done.’

The Angel shook his head.

‘A beggar stands,’ he said,

p.
62
‘Outside thy gates; till thou hast given heed

And soothed his sorrow, and supplied his need,

Say not that all is done.’

The beggar left me singing.  ‘Now at
last—

At last the path is clear.’

‘Nay, there is one draws near

Who seeks, like thee, the difficult highway.

He lacks thy courage; cheer him through the day

Then will we cry, “At last!”’

I helped my weaker brother.  ‘Now
the heights;

Oh, Guide me, Angel, guide!’

The Presence at my side,

With radiant face, said, ‘Look, where are we now?’

And lo! we stood upon the mountain’s brow—

The heights, the shining heights!

p. 63
ON
SEEING ‘THE HOUSE OF JULIA’ AT HERCULANEUM

Not great Vesuvius, in all his ire,

Nor all the centuries, could hide your shame.

There is the little window where you came,

With eyes that woke the demon of desire,

And lips like rose leaves, fashioned out of fire;

And from the lava leaps the molten flame

Of your old sins.  The walls cry out your
name—

Your face seems rising from the funeral pyre.

There must have dwelt, within your fated
town,

Full many a virtuous dame, and noble wife

Who made your beauty seem as star
to sun;

How strange the centuries have handed down

Your name, fair Julia, of immoral life,

And left the others to
oblivion.

p. 64
A
PRAYER

Master of sweet and loving lore,

Give us the open mind

To know religion means no more,

No less, than being kind.

Give us the comprehensive sight

That sees another’s need;

And let our aim to set things right

Prove God inspired our creed.

Give us the soul to know our kin

That dwell in flock and herd,

The voice to fight man’s shameful sin

Against the beast and bird.

Give us a heart with love so fraught

For all created things,

That even our unspoken thought

Bears healing on its wings.

p.
65
Give us religion that will cope

With life’s colossal woes,

And turn a radiant face of hope

On troops of pigmy foes.

Give us the mastery of our fate

In thoughts so warm and white,

They stamp upon the brows of hate

Love’s glorious seal of light.

Give us the strong, courageous faith

That makes of pain a friend,

And calls the secret word of death

‘Beginning,’ and not
‘end.’

p. 66
WHAT
IS RIGHT LIVING?

What is right living?  Just to do your
best

When worst seems easier.  To bear the ills

Of daily life with patient cheerfulness

Nor waste dear time recounting them.

To talk

Of hopeful things when doubt is in the air.

To count your blessings often, giving thanks,

And to accept your sorrows silently,

Nor question why you suffer.  To accept

The whole of life as one perfected plan,

And welcome each event as part of it.

To work, and love your work; to trust, to pray

For larger usefulness and clearer sight.

This is right living, pleasing in God’s eyes,

Though you be heathen, heretic or Jew.

p.
67
JUSTICE

However inexplicable may seem

Event and circumstance upon this earth,

Though favours fall on those whom none esteem,

And insult and indifference greet worth;

Though poverty repays the life of toil,

And riches spring where idle feet have trod,

And storms lay waste the patiently tilled soil—

Yet Justice sways the universe of God.

As undisturbed the stately stars remain

Beyond the glare of day’s obscuring light,

So Justice dwells, though mortal eyes in vain

Seek it persistently by reason’s sight.

But when, once freed, the illumined soul looks out.

Its cry will be, ‘O God, how could I doubt!’

p.
68
TIME’S GAZE

Time looked me in the eyes while passing by

The milestone of the year.  That piercing gaze

Was both an accusation and reproach.

No speech was needed.  In a sorrowing look

More meaning lies than in complaining words,

And silence hurts as keenly as reproof.

Oh, opulent, kind giver of rich hours,

How have I used thy benefits!  As babes

Unstring a necklace, laughing at the sound

Of priceless jewels dropping one by one,

So have I laughed while precious moments rolled

Into the hidden corners of the past.

And I have let large opportunities

For high endeavour move unheeded by,

While little joys and cares absorbed my strength.

p.
69
And yet, dear Time, set to my credit this:

Not one white hour have I made black with hate
,

Nor wished one living creature aught but good
.

Be patient with me.  Though the sun slants
west,

The day has not yet finished, and I feel

Necessity for action and resolve

Bear in upon my consciousness.  I know

The earth’s eternal need of earnest souls,

And the great hunger of the world for Love.

I know the goal to high achievement lies

Through the dull pathway of self-conquest first;

And on the stairs of little duties done

We climb to joys that stand thy test.  O Time,

Be patient with me, and another day,

Perchance, in passing by, thine eyes may smile.

p. 70
THE
WORKER AND THE WORK

In what I do I note the marring flaw,

The imperfections of the work I see;

Nor am I one who rather
do
than
be
,

Since its reversal is Creation’s law.

Nay, since there lies a better and a worse,

A lesser and a larger, in men’s view,

I would be better than the thing I do,

As God is greater than His universe.

He shaped Himself before He shaped one
world:

A million eons, toiling day and night,

He built Himself to majesty and might,

Before the planets into space were hurled.

And when Creation’s early work was
done,

What crude beginnings out of chaos came—

A formless nebula, a wavering flame,

An errant comet, a voracious sun.

p.
71
And, still unable to perfect His plan,

What awful creatures at His touch found birth—

Those protoplasmic monsters of the earth,

That owned the world before He fashioned Man.

And now, behold the poor unfinished state

Of this, His latest masterpiece!  Then why,

Seeing the flaws in my own work, should I

Be troubled that no voice proclaims it great?

Before me lie the cycling rounds of years;

With this small earth will die the thing I do:

The thing I am, goes journeying onward through

A million lives, upon a million spheres.

My work I build, as best I can and may,

Knowing all mortal effort ends in dust.

I build myself, not as I may, but must,

Knowing, or good, or ill, that self must stay.

Along the ages, out, and on, afar,

Its journey leads, and must perforce be made.

Likewise its choice, with things of shame and shade,

Or up the path of light, from star to star.

When all these solar systems shall disperse,

Perchance this labour, and this self-control,

May find reward; and my completed soul

Will fling in space, a little universe.

p. 72
ART
THOU ALIVE?

Art thou alive?  Nay, not too soon
reply,

Tho’ hand, and foot, and lip, and ear, and eye,

Respond, and do thy bidding yet may be

Grim death has done his direst work with thee.

Life, as God gives it, is a thing apart

From active body and from beating heart.

It is the vital spark, the unseen fire,

That moves the mind to reason and aspire;

It is the force that bids emotion roll,

In mighty billows from the surging soul.

It is the light that grows from hour to
hour,

And floods the brain with consciousness of power;

It is the spirit dominating all,

And reaching God with its imperious call,

Until the shining glory of His face

Illuminates each sorrowful, dark place;

p.
73
It is the truth that sets the bondsman free,

Knowing he will be what he wills to be.

With its unburied dead the earth is sad.

Art thou alive? proclaim it and be glad.

Perchance the dead may hear thee and arise,

Knowing they live, and
here
is Paradise.

p.
74
TO-DAY

I love this age of energy and force,

Expectantly I greet each pregnant hour;

Emerging from the all-creative source,

Supreme with promise, imminent with power.

The strident whistle and the clanging bell,

The noise of gongs, the rush of motored things

Are but the prophet voices which foretell

A time when thought may use unfettered wings.

Too long the drudgery of earth has been

A barrier ’twixt man and his own mind.

Remove the stone, and lo! the Christ within;

For He is there, and who so seeks shall find.

The Great Inventor is the Modern Priest.

He paves the pathway to a higher goal.

Once from the grind of endless toil released

Man will explore the kingdom of his soul.

p.
75
And all this restless rush, this strain and strife,

This noise and glare is but the fanfarade

That ushers in the more majestic life

Where faith shall walk with science, unafraid.

I feel the strong vibrations of the earth,

I sense the coming of an hour sublime,

And bless the star that watched above my birth

And let me live in this important time.

p. 76
THE
LADDER

Unto each mortal who comes to earth

A ladder is given by God, at birth,

And up this ladder the soul must go,

Step by step, from the valley below;

Step by step, to the centre of space,

On this ladder of lives, to the Starting Place.

In time departed (which yet endures)

I shaped my ladder, and you shaped yours.

Whatever they are—they are what we made:

A ladder of light, or a ladder of shade,

A ladder of love, or a hateful thing,

A ladder of strength, or a wavering string.

A ladder of gold, or a ladder of straw,

Each is the ladder of righteous law.

We flung them away at the call of death,

We took them again with the next life breath.

For a keeper stands by the great birth gates;

As each soul passes, its ladder waits.

p. 77
Though
mine be narrow, and yours be broad,

On my ladder alone can I climb to God.

On your ladder alone can your feet ascend,

For none may borrow, and none may lend.

If toil and trouble and pain are found,

Twisted and corded, to form each round,

If rusted iron or mouldering wood

Is the fragile frame, you must make it good.

You must build it over and fashion it strong,

Though the task be hard as your life is long;

For up this ladder the pathway leads

To earthly pleasures and spirit needs;

And all that may come in another way

Shall be but illusion, and will not stay.

In useless effort, then, waste no time;

Rebuild your ladder, and climb and climb.

p. 78
WHO IS
A CHRISTIAN?

Who is a Christian in this Christian land

Of many churches and of lofty spires?

Not he who sits in soft upholstered pews

Bought by the profits of unholy greed,

And looks devotion, while he thinks of gain.

Not he who sends petitions from the lips

That lie to-morrow in the street and mart.

Not he who fattens on another’s toil,

And flings his unearned riches to the poor,

Or aids the heathen with a lessened wage,

And builds cathedrals with an increased rent.

Christ, with Thy great, sweet, simple creed of
love,

How must Thou weary of Earth’s ‘Christian’
clans,

Who preach salvation through Thy saving blood

While planning slaughter of their fellow men.

p. 79
Who is a
Christian?  It is one whose life

Is built on love, on kindness and on faith;

Who holds his brother as his other self;

Who toils for justice, equity and PEACE,

And hides no aim or purpose in his heart

That will not chord with universal good.

Though he be pagan, heretic or Jew,

That man is Christian and beloved of Christ.

p. 80
THE
GOAL

All your wonderful inventions,

All your houses vast and tall,

All your great gun-fronted vessels,

Every fort and every wall,

With the passing of the ages,

They shall pass and they shall fall.

As you sit among the idols

That your avarice gave birth,

As you count the hoarded treasures

That you think of priceless worth,

Time is digging tombs to hide them

In the bosom of the earth.

There shall come a great convulsion

Or a rushing tidal wave,

Or a sound of mighty thunders

From a subterranean cave,

And a boasting world’s possessions

Shall be buried in one grave.

p.
81
From the Centuries of Silence

We are bringing back again

Buried vase and bust and column

And the gods they worshipped then,

In the strange unmentioned cities

Built by prehistoric men.

Did they steal, and lie, and slaughter?

Did they steep their souls in shame?

Did they sell eternal virtues

Just to win a passing fame?

Did they give the gold of honour

For the tinsel of a name?

We are hurrying all together

Toward the silence and the night;

There is nothing worth the seeking

But the sun-kissed moral height—

There is nothing worth the doing

But the doing of the
right
.

p. 82
THE
SPUR

I asked the rock beside the road what joy
existence lent.

It answered, ‘For a million years my heart has been
content.’

I asked the truffle-seeking swine, as rooting
by he went,

‘What is the keynote of your life?’  He grunted
out, ‘Content.’

I asked a slave, who toiled and sung, just what
his singing meant.

He plodded on his changeless way, and said, ‘I am
content.’

I asked a plutocrat of greed, on what his
thoughts were bent.

He chinked the silver in his purse, and said, ‘I am
content.’

p.
83
I asked the mighty forest tree from whence its force was
sent.

Its thousand branches spoke as one, and said, ‘From
discontent.’

I asked the message speeding on, by what great
law was rent

God’s secret from the waves of space.  It said,
‘From discontent.’

I asked the marble, where the works of God and
man were blent,

What brought the statue from the block.  It answered,
‘Discontent.’

I asked an Angel, looking down on earth with
gaze intent,

How man should rise to larger growth.  Quoth he,
‘Through discontent.’

p.
84
AWAKENED!

Slowly the People waken; they have been,

Like weary soldiers, sleeping in their tents,

While traitors tiptoed through the silent camp

Intent on plunder.  Suddenly a sound—

A careless movement of too bold a thief—

Starts one dull sleeper; then another stirs,

A third cries out a warning, and at last

The people are awake!  Oh, when as one

The many rise, united and alert,

With Justice for their motto, they reflect

The mighty force of God’s Omnipotence.

And nothing stands before them.  Lusty Greed,

Tyrannical Corruption long in power,

And smirking Cant (whose right hand robs and slays

So that the left may dower Church and School),

Monopoly, whose mandate took from Toil

The Mother Earth, that Idleness might loll

p. 85
And breed
the Monster of Colossal Wealth—

All these must fall before the gathering Force

Of public indignation.  That old strife

Which marks the progress of each century,

The war of Right with Might, is on once more,

And shame to him who does not take his stand.

This is the weightiest moment of all time,

And on the issues of the present hour

A nation’s honour and a country’s peace,

A People’s future, ay, a World’s, depends.

Until the vital questions of the day

Are solved and settled, and the spendthrift thieves

Who rob the coffers of the saving poor

Are led from fashion’s feasts to prison fare,

And taught the saving grace of honest work—

Till Labour claims the privilege of toil

And toil the proceeds of its labour shares—

Let no man sleep, let no man dare to sleep!

p.
86
SHADOWS

I am sorry in the gladness

Of the joys that crown my days,

For the souls that sit in sadness

Or walk uninviting ways.

On the radiance of my labour

That a loving fate bestowed,

Falls the shadow of my neighbour,

Crushed beneath a thankless load.

As the canticle of pleasure

From my lovelit altar rolls,

There is one discordant measure,

As I think of homeless souls.

And I know that grim old story,

Preached from pulpits, is not so,

For no God could sit in glory

And see sinners writhe below.

p.
87
In that great eternal Centre

Where all human life has birth,

Boundless love and pity enter

And flow downward to the earth.

And all souls in sin or sorrow

Are but passing through the night,

And I know on some to-morrow

God will love them into light.

p. 88
THE
NEW COMMANDMENT

‘
Let go the Cross
’—
Gertrude Runshon
.

I heard a strange voice in the distance
calling

As from a star an echo might be falling.

It spoke four syllables, concise and brief,

Charged with a God-sent message of relief:

Let go the cross
!  Oh, you who
cling to sorrow,

Hark to the new command and comfort borrow.

Even as the Master left His cross below

And rose to Paradise, let go, let go.

Forget your wrongs, your troubles and your
losses,

For with the tools of thought we build our crosses.

Forget your griefs, all grudges and all fear

And enter Paradise—its gates are near.

p.
89
Heaven is a realm by loving souls created,

And hell was fashioned by the hearts that hated.

Love, hope and trust; believe all joys are
yours,

Life pays the soul whose confidence endures,

The blows of adverse fate, by larger
pleasures,

As after storms the soil yields fuller measures.

Let go the cross; roll self—the
stone—away

And dwell with Love in Paradise to-day.

p. 90
SUMMER
DREAMS

When the Summer sun is shining,

And the green things push and grow,

Oft my heart runs over measure,

With its flowing fount of pleasure,

As I feel the sea winds blow;

Ah, then life is good, I know.

And I think of sweet birds building,

And of children fair and free;

And of glowing sun-kissed meadows,

And of tender twilight shadows,

And of boats upon the sea.

Oh, then life seems good to me!

Then unbidden and unwanted,

Come the darker, sadder sights;

City shop and stifling alley,

Where misfortune’s children rally;

And the hot crime-breeding nights,

And the dearth of God’s delights.

p.
91
And I think of narrow prisons

Where unhappy songbirds dwell,

And of cruel pens and cages

Where some captured wild thing rages

Like a madman in his cell,

In the Zoo, the wild beasts’ hell.

And I long to lift the burden

Of man’s selfishness and sin;

And to open wide earth’s treasures

Of God’s storehouse, full of pleasures,

For my dumb and human kin,

And to ask the whole world in.

p. 92
THE
BREAKING OF CHAINS

Between the ringing of bells and the musical
clang of chimes

I hear a sound like the breaking of chains, all through these
Christmas times.

For the thought of the world is waking out of a slumber deep and
long,

And the race is beginning to understand how Right can master
Wrong.

And the eyes of the world are opening wide, and
great are the truths they see;

And the heart of the world is singing a song, and its burden is
‘Be free!’

Now the thought of the world and the wish of the world and the
song of the world will make

A force so strong that the fetters forged for a million years
must break.

p.
93
Fetters of superstitious fear have bound the race to
creeds

That hindered the upward march of man to the larger faith he
needs.

Fetters of greed and pride have made the race bow down to
kings;

But the pompous creed and the costly throne must yield to simpler
things.

The thought of the world has climbed above old
paths for centuries trod;

And cloth and crown no longer mean the ‘vested power of
God.’

The race no longer bends beneath the weight of Adam’s
sin,

But stands erect and knows itself the Maker’s first of
kin.

And the need of the world and the wish of the
world and the song of the world I hear,

All through the clanging and clashing of bells, this Christmas
time o’ the year;

And I hear a sound like the breaking of chains, and it seems to
say to me,

In the voice of One who spoke of old, ‘The Truth shall make
men free.’

p.
94
DECEMBER

Upon December’s windy portico

The Old Year stood, and looked out where the sun

Went wading down the West, through drifting clouds.

‘I, too, shall sink full soon to rest,’ he sighed,

‘And follow where my children’s feet have trod;

Brave January, beauteous May and June,

My lovely daughters, and my valiant sons,

All, all save one, have left me for that bourne

Men call the Past.  It seems but yesterday

I saw fair August, laughing with the Sea,

Snaring the Earth with her seductive wiles,

And making conquest, even of the Sun.

Yet has she gone, and left me here to mourn.’

Then spake December, from an open door:

‘Father, the night grows cold; come in and rest.

Sit with me here beside this glowing grate;

I have not left thee; thou art not alone;

p. 95
My house
is thine; all warm with love and light,

And bright with holly and with cedar sweet.

My stalwart arm is thine to lean upon;

The feast is spread, I only wait for thee;

God smiles upon thy dead, smile thou on me.’

Then through the open door the Old Year passed

And darkness settled on the outer world.

p.
96
‘THE WAY’

However certain of the way thou art,

Take not the self-appointed leader’s part.

Follow no man, and by no man be led,

And no man lead.
Awake
, and go ahead.

Thy path, though leading straight unto the goal

Might prove confusing to another soul.

The goal is central; but from east, and west,

And north, and south, we set out on the quest;

From lofty mountains, and from valleys low:—

How could all find one common way to go?

Lord Buddha to the wilderness was brought.

Lord Jesus to the Cross.  And yet, think not

By solitude, or cross, thou canst achieve,

Lest in thine own true Self thou dost believe.

Know thou art One, with life’s Almighty Source,

Then are thy feet set on the certain Course.

p.
97
Nor does it matter if thou feast, or fast,

Or what thy creed—or where thy lot is cast;

In halls of pleasure or in crowded mart,

In city streets, or from all men apart—

Thy path leads to the Light; and peace and power

Shall be thy portion, growing hour by hour.

Follow no man, and by no man be led.

And no man lead.  But
know
and go ahead.

p. 98
THE
LEADER TO BE

What shall the leader be in that great day

When we who sleep and dream that we are slaves

Shall wake and know that Liberty is ours?

Mark well that word—not yours, not mine, but ours.

For through the mingling of the separate streams

Of individual protest and desire,

In one united sea of purpose, lies

The course to Freedom.

When
Progression takes

Her undisputed right of way, and sinks

The old traditions and conventions where

They may not rise, what shall the leader be?

No mighty warrior skilled in crafts of war,

Sowing earth’s fertile furrows with dead men

And staining crimson God’s cerulean sea,

To prove his prowess to a shuddering world.

p.
99
Nor yet a monarch with a silly crown

Perched on an empty head, an in-bred heir

To senseless titles and anemic blood.

No ruler, purchased by the perjured votes

Of striving demagogues whose god is gold.

Not one of these shall lead to Liberty.

The weakness of the world cries out for strength.

The sorrow of the world cries out for hope.

Its suffering cries for kindness.

He
who leads

Must then be strong and hopeful as the dawn

That rises unafraid and full of joy

Above the blackness of the darkest night.

He must be kind to every living thing;

Kind as the Krishna, Buddha and the Christ,

And full of love for all created life.

Oh, not in war shall his great prowess lie,

Nor shall he find his pleasure in the chase.

Too great for slaughter, friend of man and beast,

Touching the borders of the Unseen Realms

And bringing down to earth their mystic fires

To light our troubled pathways, wise and kind

And human to the core, so shall he be,

The coming leader of the coming time.

p. 100
THE
GREATER LOVE

Hear thou my prayer, great God of opulence;

Give me no blessings, save as recompense

For blessings which I lovingly bestow

On needy stranger or on suffering foe.

If Wealth, by chance, should on my path appear,

Let Wisdom and Benevolence stand near,

And Charity within my portal wait,

To guard me from acquaintance intimate.

Yet in this intricate great art of living

Guide me away from misdirected giving,

And show me how to spur the laggard soul

To strive alone once more to gain the goal.

Repay my worldly efforts to attain

Only as I develop heart and brain;

Nor brand me with the ‘Dollar Sign’ above

A bosom void of sympathy and love.

p.
101
If on the carrying winds my name be blown

To any land or time beyond my own,

Let it not be as one who gained the day

By crowding others from the chosen way;

Rather as one who missed the highest place

Pausing to cheer spent runners in the race.

To do—to have—is lesser than to BE:

The greater boon I ask, dear God, from Thee.

p.
102
THANK GOD FOR LIFE

Thank God for life, in such an age as this,

Rich with the promises of better things.

Thank God for being part of this great nation’s heart,

Whose strong pulsations are not ruled by kings.

Our thanks for fearless and protesting
speech

When cloven hoofs show ’neath the robes of
state.

For us no servile song of ‘Kings can do no wrong.’

Not royal birth, but worth, makes rulers great.

Thank God for peace within our border lands,

And for the love of peace within each soul.

Who thinks on peace has wrought, mosaic-squares of thought

In the foundation of our future goal.

p.
103
Our thanks for love, and knowledge of love’s
laws.

Love is a greater power than vested might.

Love is the central source of all enduring force.

Love is the law that sets the whole world right.

Our thanks for that increasing torch of
light

The tireless hand of science holds abroad.

And may its growing blaze shine on all hidden ways

Till man beholds the silhouette of God.

p. 104
TIME
ENOUGH

I know it is early morning,

And hope is calling aloud,

And your heart is afire with Youth’s desire

To hurry along with the crowd.

But linger a bit by the roadside,

And lend a hand by the way,

’Tis a curious fact that a generous act

Brings leisure and luck to a day.

I know it is only the noontime—

There is chance enough to be kind;

But the hours run fast when noon has passed,

And the shadows are close behind.

So think while the light is shining,

And act ere the set of the sun,

For the sorriest woe that a soul can know

Is to think what it might have done.

p.
105
I know it is almost evening,

But the twilight hour is long.

If you listen and heed each cry of need

You can right full many a wrong.

For when we have finished the journey

We will all look back and say:

‘On life’s long mile there was nothing worth while

But the good we did by the way.’

p. 106
NEW
YEAR’S DAY

When with clanging and with ringing

Comes the year’s initial day,

I can feel the rhythmic swinging

Of the world upon its way;

And though Right still wears a fetter,

And though Justice still is blind,

Time’s beyond is always better

Than the paths he leaves behind.

In our eons of existence,

As we circle through the night,

We annihilate the distance

’Twixt the darkness and the light.

From beginnings crude and lowly,

Round and round our souls have trod

Through the circles, winding slowly

Up to knowledge and to God.

With each century departed

Some old evil found a tomb,

p. 107
Some old
truth was newly started

In propitious soil to bloom.

With each epoch some condition

That has handicapped the race

(Worn-out creed or superstition)

Unto knowledge yields its place.

Though in folly and in blindness

And in sorrow still we grope,

Yet in man’s increasing kindness

Lies the world’s stupendous hope;

For our darkest hour of errors

Is as radiant as the dawn,

Set beside the awful terrors

Of the ages that have gone.

And above the sad world’s sobbing,

And the strife of clan with clan,

I can hear the mighty throbbing

Of the heart of God in man;

And a voice chants through the chiming

Of the bells, and seems to say,

We are climbing, we are climbing,

As we circle on our way.

p. 108
LIFE
IS A PRIVILEGE

Life is a privilege.  Its youthful days

Shine with the radiance of continuous Mays.

To live, to breathe, to wonder and desire,

To feed with dreams the heart’s perpetual fire;

To thrill with virtuous passions and to glow

With great ambitions—in one hour to know

The depths and heights of feeling—God! in truth

How beautiful, how beautiful is youth!

Life is a privilege.  Like some rare
rose

The mysteries of the human mind unclose.

What marvels lie in earth and air and sea,

What stores of knowledge wait our opening key,

What sunny roads of happiness lead out

Beyond the realms of indolence and doubt,

And what large pleasures smile upon and bless

The busy avenues of usefulness.

p.
109
Life is a privilege.  Though noontide fades

And shadows fall along the winding glades;

Though joy-blooms wither in the autumn air,

Yet the sweet scent of sympathy is there.

Pale sorrow leads us closer to our kind,

And in the serious hours of life we find

Depths in the soul of men which lend new worth

And majesty to this brief span of earth.

Life is a privilege.  If some sad fate

Sends us alone to seek the exit gate;

If men forsake us as the shadows fall,

Still does the supreme privilege of all

Come in that reaching upward of the soul

To find the welcoming presence at the goal,

And in the knowledge that our feet have trod

Paths that lead from and must lead back to God.

p. 110
IN
AN OLD ART GALLERY

Before the statue of a giant Hun,

There stood a dwarf, misshapen and uncouth.

His lifted eyes seemed asking: ‘Why, in sooth,

Was I not fashioned like this mighty one?

Would God show favour to an older son

Like earthly kings, and beggar without ruth

Another, who sinned only by his youth?

Why should two lives in such divergence run?’

Strange, as he gazed, that from a vanished
past

No memories revived of war and strife,

Of misused prowess, and of broken
law.

That old Hun’s spirit, in the dwarf re-cast,

Lived out the sequence of an earthly life.

It was the statue of himself he
saw
!

p. 111
TRUE
BROTHERHOOD

God, what a world, if men in street and mart

Felt that same kinship of the human heart

Which makes them, in the face of flame and flood,

Rise to the meaning of true Brotherhood!

p. 112
THE
DECADENT

Among the virile hosts he passed along,

Conspicuous for an undetermined grace

Of sexless beauty.  In his form and face

God’s mighty purpose somehow had gone wrong.

Then on his loom, he wove a careful song,

Of sensuous threads; a wordy web of lace

Wherein the primal passions of the race

And his own sins made wonder for the throng.

A little pen prick opened up a vein,

And gave the finished mesh a crimson blot—

The last consummate touch of
studied art.

But those who knew strong passion and keen pain,

Looked through and through the pattern and found
not

One single great emotion of the
heart.

p.
113
LORD, SPEAK AGAIN

When God had formed the Universe, He thought

Of all the marvels therein to be wrought

And to His aid then Motherhood was brought.

‘My lesser self, the feminine of Me,

She will go forth throughout all time,’ quoth He,

‘And make My world what I would have it be.

‘For I am weary, having laboured so,

And for a cycle of repose would go

Into that silence which but God may know.

‘Therefore I leave the rounding of My
plan

To Motherhood; and that which I began

Let woman finish in perfecting man.

‘She is the soil: the human Mother
Earth:

She is the sun, that calls the seed to earth.

She is the gardener, who knows its worth.

p.
114
‘From Me, all seed, of any kind must spring.

Divine the growth such seed and soil will bring.

For all is Me, and I am everything.’

Thus having spoken to Himself aloud,

His glorious face upon His breast He bowed,

And sought repose behind a wall of cloud.

Come forth, O God! though great Thy thought and
good,

In shaping woman for true Motherhood,

Lord, speak again; she has not understood.

The centuries pass: the cycles roll
along—

The earth is peopled with a mighty throng,

Yet men are fighting and the world goes wrong.

Lord, speak again, ere yet it be too late,

Unloved, unwanted souls come through earth’s gate:

The unborn child is given a dower of hate.

Thy world progresses in all ways save one.

In Motherhood, for which it was begun,

Lord, Lord, behold how little has been done!

Children are spawned like fishes in the
sand.

With ignorance and crime they fill the land.

Lord, speak again, till mothers understand.

p.
115
It is not all of Motherhood to know

Conception pleasure or deliverance woe.

Who plants the seed should help the shoot to grow.

Better a barren soil than weed and tare,

Or sickly plants that die for want of care

In poisonous jungles, void of sun and air.

True Motherhood is not alone to breed

The human race; it is to know and heed

Its holiest purpose and its highest need.

Lord, speak again, so woman shall be stirred

With the full meaning of that mighty word

True Motherhood.  She has not rightly heard.

p. 116
MY
HEAVEN

Unhoused in deserts of accepted thought,

And lost in jungles of confusing creeds,

My soul strayed, homeless, finding its own needs

Unsatisfied with what tradition taught.

The pros and cons, the little ifs and ands,

The but and maybe, and the this and that,

On which the churches thicken and grow fat,

I found but structures built on shifting sands.

And all their heavens were strange and far
away,

And all their hells were made of human hate;

And since for death I did not care to wait,

A heaven I fashioned for myself one day.

p.
117
Of happy thoughts I built it stone by stone,

With joy of life I draped each spacious room,

With love’s great light I drove away all
gloom,

And in the centre I made God a throne.

And this dear heaven I set within my heart,

And carried it about with me alway,

And then the changing dogmas of the day

Seemed alien to my thoughts and held no part.

Now as I take my heaven from place to place

I find new rooms by love’s revealing light,

And death will give me but a larger sight

To see my palace spreading into space.

p.
118
LIFE

On a bleak, bald hill with a dull world
under,

The dreary world of the Commonplace,

I have stood when the whole world seemed a blunder

Of dotard Time, in an aimless race.

With worry about me and want before me—

Yet deep in my soul was a rapture spring

That made me cry to the grey sky o’er me:

‘Oh, I know this life is a goodly
thing!’

I have given sweet years to a thankless duty

While cold and starving, though clothed and fed,

For a young heart’s hunger for joy and beauty

Is harder to bear than the need of bread.

I have watched the wane of a sodden season,

Which let hope wither, and made care thrive,

And through it all, without earthly reason,

I have thrilled with the glory of being alive.

p.
119
And now I stand by the great sea’s splendour,

Where love and beauty feed heart and eye.

The brilliant light of the sun grows tender

As it slants to the shore of the by and by.

I prize each hour as a golden treasure—

A pearl Time drops from a broken string:

And all my ways are the ways of pleasure,

And I know this life is a goodly thing.

And I know, too, that not in the seeing,

Or having, or doing the things we would,

Lies that deep rapture that comes from being

At one with the Purpose which made all
good
.

And not from Pleasure the heart may borrow

That rare contentment for which we strive,

Unless through trouble, and want, and sorrow

It has thrilled with the glory of being alive.

p.
120
GOD’S KIN

There is no summit you may not attain,

No purpose which you may not yet achieve,

If you will wait serenely and believe

Each seeming loss is but a step toward gain.

Between the mountain-tops lie vale and
plain;

Let nothing make you question, doubt or grieve;

Give only good, and good alone receive;

And as you welcome joy, so welcome pain.

That which you most desire awaits your word;

Throw wide the door and bid it enter in.

Speak, and the strong vibrations shall be stirred;

Speak, and above earth’s loud, unmeaning
din

Your silent declarations shall be heard.

All things are possible to God’s own kin.

CONQUEST

Talk not of strength, until your heart has
known

And fought with weakness through long hours alone.

Talk not of virtue, till your conquering
soul

Has met temptation and gained full control.

Boast not of garments, all unscorched by
sin,

Till you have passed, unscathed, through fires within.

Oh, poor that pride the unscarred soldier
shows,

Who safe in camp, has never faced his foes.

p. 122
THE
STATUE

A granite rock in the mountain side

Gazed on the world and was satisfied.

It watched the centuries come and go.

It welcomed the sunlight, yet loved the snow.

It grieved when the forest was forced to fall,

Yet joyed when steeples rose, white and tall,

In the valley below it, and thrilled to hear

The voice of the great town roaring near.

When the mountain stream from its idle play

Was caught by the mill wheel and borne away

And trained to labour, the grey rock mused

‘Trees and verdure and stream are used

By Man the Master; but I remain

Friend of the mountain, and star, and plain,

Unchanged forever by God’s decree,

While passing centuries bow to me.’

p.
123
Then all unwarned, with a mighty shock

Out of the mountain was wrenched the rock.

Bruised and battered and broken in heart,

It was carried away to the common mart,

Wrecked and ruined in piece and pride.

‘Oh, God is cruel,’ the granite cried,

‘Comrade of mountains, of stars the friend,

By all deserted, how sad my end.’

A dreaming sculptor in passing by

Gazed at the granite with thoughtful eye.

Then stirred with a purpose supremely grand

He bade his dream in the rock expand.

And lo! from the broken and shapeless mass

That grieved and doubted, it came to pass

That a glorious statue of priceless worth

And infinite beauty, adorned the earth.

SIRIUS

‘
Since Sinus crossed the Milky Way
,

sixty thousand years have gone
.’—
Garrett
P.
Serviss
.

Since Sirius crossed the Milky Way

Full sixty thousand years have gone,

Yet hour by hour, and day by day,

This tireless star speeds on and on.

Methinks he must be moved to mirth

By that droll tale of Genesis,

Which says creation had its birth

For such a puny world as this.

To hear how One who fashioned all

Those Solar Systems, tier on tiers,

Expressed in little Adam’s fall

The purpose of a million spheres.

p.
125
And, witness of the endless plan,

To splendid wrath he must be wrought

By pigmy creeds presumptuous man

Sends forth as God’s primeval thought.

Perchance from half a hundred stars

He hears as many curious things;

From Venus, Jupiter and Mars,

And Saturn with the beauteous rings,

There may be students of the Cause

Who send their revelations out,

And formulate their codes of laws,

With heavens for faith and hells for doubt.

On planets old ere form or place

Was lent to earth, may dwell—who
knows—

A God-like and perfected race

That hails great Sirius as he goes.

In zones that circle moon and sun,

’Twixt world and world, he may see souls

Whose span of earthly life is done,

Still journeying up to higher goals.

p.
126
And on dead planets grey and cold

Grim spectral souls, that harboured hate

Life after life, he may behold

Descending to a darker fate.

And on his grand majestic course

He may have caught one glorious sight

Of that vast shining central Source

From which proceeds all Life, all Light.

Since Sirius crossed the Milky Way

Full sixty thousand years have gone,

No mortal man may bid him stay,

No mortal man may speed him on.

No mortal mind may comprehend

What is beyond, what was before;

To God be glory without end,

Let man be humble and adore.

p. 127
AT
FONTAINEBLEAU

At Fontainebleau, I saw a little bed

Fashioned of polished wood, with gold ornate,

Ambition, hope, and sorrow, ay, and hate

Once battled there, above a childish head,

And there in vain, grief wept, and memory plead

It was so small! but Ah, dear God, how great

The part it played in one sad woman’s fate.

How wide the gloom, that narrow object shed.

The symbol of an over-reaching aim,

The emblem of a devastated joy,

It spoke of glory, and a blasted
home:

Of fleeting honours, and disordered fame,

And the lone passing of a fragile boy.

* * * * *

It was the cradle of the King of Rome.

p. 128
THE
MASQUERADE

Look in the eyes of trouble with a smile,

Extend your hand and do not be afraid.

’Tis but a friend who comes to masquerade.

And test your faith and courage for awhile.

Fly, and he follows fast with threat and
jeer.

Shrink, and he deals hard blow on stinging blow,

But bid him welcome as a friend, and lo!

The jest is off—the masque will disappear.

p.
129
SYMPATHY

Is the way hard and thorny, oh, my brother?

Do tempests beat, and adverse wild winds blow?

And are you spent, and broken, at each nightfall,

Yet with each morn you rise and onward go?

Brother, I know, I know!

I, too, have journeyed so.

Is your heart mad with longing, oh, my
sister?

Are all great passions in your breast aglow?

Does the white wonder of your own soul blind you,

And are you torn with rapture and with woe?

Sister, I know, I know!

I, too, have suffered so.

Is the road filled with snare and quicksand,
pilgrim?

Do pitfalls lie where roses seem to grow?

p. 130
And have
you sometimes stumbled in the darkness,

And are you bruised and scarred by many a blow?

Pilgrim, I know, I know!

I, too, have stumbled so.

Do you send out rebellious cry and question,

As mocking hours pass silently and slow,

Does your insistent ‘wherefore’ bring no answer,

While stars wax pale with watching, and droop
low?

I, too, have questioned so,

But now
I know
,
I know
!

To toil, to strive, to err, to cry, to grow,

To love through
all—this is the way to

know
.

p.
131
INTERMEDIARY

When from the prison of its body free,

My soul shall soar, before it goes to Thee,

Thou great Creator, give it power to know

The language of all sad, dumb things below.

And let me dwell a season still on earth

Before I rise to some diviner birth:

Invisible to men, yet seen and heard,

And understood by sorrowing beast and bird—

Invisible to men, yet always near,

To whisper counsel in the human ear:

And with a spell to stay the hunter’s hand

And stir his heart to know and understand;

To plant within the dull or thoughtless mind

The great religious impulse to be kind.

Before I prune my spirit wings and rise

To seek my loved ones in their paradise,

p. 132
Yea!
even before I hasten on to see

That lost child’s face, so like a dream to me,

I would be given this intermediate role,

And carry comfort to each poor, dumb soul:

And bridge man’s gulf of cruelty and sin

By understanding of his lower kin.

’Twixt weary driver and the straining steed

On wings of mercy would my spirit speed.

And each should know, before his journey’s end,

That in the other dwelt a loving friend.

From zoo and jungle, and from cage and stall,

I would translate each inarticulate call,

Each pleading look, each frenzied act and cry,

And tell the story to each passer-by;

And of a spirit’s privilege possessed,

Pursue indifference to its couch of rest,

And whisper in its ear until in awe

It woke and knew God’s all-embracing law

Of Universal Life—the One in All.

* * * * *

Lord, let this mission to my lot befall.

p.
133
LIFE’S CAR

‘Hurry
up!’

No lingering by old doors of doubt—

No loitering by the way,

No waiting a To-morrow car,

When you can board To-day.

Success is somewhere down the track;

Before the chance is gone

Accelerate your laggard pace,

Swing on, I say, swing on—

Hurry up!

‘Step
lively!’

Belated souls are following fast,

They shout and signal, ‘Wait.’

Conductor Time brooks no delay,

He rings the bell of Fate.

But you can give the man behind,

With one hand on the bar,

p. 134
A final
chance to brook defeat,

And board the moving car.

Step lively!

‘Move
up!’

Make way for others as you sit

Or stand.  This crowded earth

Has room for every journeying soul

En route to higher birth.

Ay, room and comfort, if no one

Took double share or space,

Nor let his greed and selfishness

Absorb another’s place.

Move up!

‘Hold
fast!’

The jolting switch of obstacles

With jarring rails is near.

Stand firm of foot, be strong of grip,

Brace well and have no fear.

The Maker of the Car of Life

Foresaw that curve—Despair,

And hung the straps of faith, and hope

So you might grasp them there.

Hold fast!

p.
135
OPPORTUNITY

Send forth your heart’s desire, and work
and wait;

The opportunities of life are brought

To our own doors, not by capricious fate,

But by the strong compelling force of thought.

p. 136
THE
AGE OF MOTORED THINGS

The wonderful age of the world I sing—

The age of battery, coil and spring,

Of steam, and storage, and motored thing.

Though faith may slumber and art seem dead,

And all that is spoken has once been said,

And all that is written were best unread;

Though hearts are iron and thoughts are
steel,

And all that has value is mercantile,

Yet marvellous truths shall the age reveal.

Ay, greater the marvels this age shall find

Than all the centuries left behind,

When faith was a bigot and art was blind.

Oh, sorry the search of the world for gods,

Through faith that slaughters and art that lauds,

While reason sits on its throne and nods.

p.
137
But out of the leisure that men will know,

When the cruel things of the sad earth go,

A Faith that is Knowledge shall rise and grow.

In the throb and whir of each new machine

Thinner is growing the veil between

The visible earth and the worlds unseen.

The True Religion shall leisure bring;

And Art shall awaken and Love shall sing:

Oh, ho! for the age of the motored thing!

Who is it knocking at my door?’

The New Year

DISARMAMENT

We have outgrown the helmet and cuirass,

The spear, the arrow, and the javelin.

These crude inventions of a cruder age,

When men killed men to show their love of God,

And he who slaughtered most was greatest king.

We have outgrown the need of war!

Should men

Unite in this one thought, all war would end.

Disarm the world; and let all Nations meet

Like Men, not monsters, when disputes arise.

When crossed opinions tangle into snarls,

Let Courts untie them, and not armies cut.

When State discussions breed dissensions, let

Union and Arbitration supersede

The hell-created implements of War.

Disarm the world! and bid destructive thought

Slip like a serpent from the mortal mind

Down through the marshes of oblivion.  Soon

A race of gods shall rise!  Disarm!  Disarm!

p. 141
THE
CALL

All wantonly in hours of joy,

I made a song of pain.

Soon Grief drew near, and paused to hear,

And sang the sad refrain,

Again and yet again.

Then recklessly in my despair,

I sang of hope one day.

And Joy turned back upon life’s track,

And smiled, and came my way,

And sat her down to stay.

p. 142
A
LITTLE SONG

Oh, a great world, a fair world, a true world I
find it;

A sun that never forgets to rise,

On the darkest night, a star in the skies,

And a God of love behind it.

Oh, a good life, a sweet life, a large life I
take it,

Is what He offers to you, and me;

A chance to do, and a chance to be,

Whatever we chose to make it.

Oh, a far way, a high way, a sure way He leads
us;

And if the journey at times seems long,

We must trudge ahead, with a trustful song,

And know at the end He needs us.

A
DIALOGUE

Mortal

The world is full of selfishness and greed.

Lord, I would lave its sin.

Spirit

Yea, mortal, earth of thy good help has
need.

Go cleanse
thyself
within.

Mortal

Mine ear is hurt by harsh and evil speech.

I would reform men’s ways.

Spirit

There is but one convincing way to teach.

Speak
thou
but words of praise.

Mortal

On every hand is wretchedness and grief,

Despondency and fear.

Lord, I would give my fellow men relief.

p. 146
Spirit

Be, then, all hope, all cheer.

Mortal

Lord, I look outward and grow sick at heart,

Such need of change I see.

Spirit

Mortal, look
in
.  Do thy allotted
part,

And leave the rest to ME.

p. 147
THE
WEED

A weed is but an unloved flower!

Go dig, and prune, and guide, and wait,

Until it learns its high estate,

And glorifies some bower.

A weed is but an unloved flower!

All sin is virtue unevolved,

Release the angel from the clod—

Go love thy brother up to God.

Behold each problem solved.

All sin is virtue unevolved.

p.
148
STRENGTH

Who is the strong?  Not he who puts to
test

His sinews with the strong and proves the best;

But he who dwells where weaklings congregate,

And never lets his splendid strength abate.

Who is the good?  Not he who walks each
day

With moral men along the high, clean way;

But he who jostles gilded sin and shame,

Yet will not sell his honour or his name.

Who is the wise?  Not he who from the
start

With Wisdom’s followers has taken part;

But he who looks in Folly’s tempting eyes,

And turns away, perceiving her disguise.

Who is serene?  Not he who flees his
kind,

Some mountain fastness, or some cave to find;

But he who in the city’s noisiest scene,

Keeps calm within—he only is serene.

p.
149
AFFIRM

Body and mind, and spirit, all combine

To make the Creature, human and divine.

Of this great trinity no part deny.

Affirm, affirm, the Great Eternal I.

Affirm the body, beautiful and whole,

The earth-expression of immortal soul.

Affirm the mind, the messenger of the hour,

To speed between thee and the source of power.

Affirm the spirit, the Eternal I—

Of this great trinity no part deny.

p. 150
THE
CHOSEN

They stood before the Angel at the gate;

The Angel asked: ‘Why should you enter
in?’

One said: ‘On earth my place was high and great;’

And one: ‘I warned my fellow-men from
sin;’

Another: ‘I was teacher of the faith;

I scorned my life and lived in love with death.’

And one stood silent.
‘Speak!’ the Angel said;

‘What earthly deed has sent you here
to-day?’

‘Alas!  I did but follow where they led,’

He answered sadly: ‘I had lost my
way—

So new the country, and so strange my flight;

I only sought for guidance and for light.’

‘You have no passport?’
‘None,’ the answer came.

‘I loved the earth, tho’ lowly was my
lot.

I strove to keep my record free from blame,

And make a heaven about my humble spot.

p. 151
A narrow
life; I see it now, too late;

So, Angel, drive me from the heavenly gate.’

The Angel swung the portal wide and free,

And took the sorrowing stranger by the hand.

‘Nay, you alone,’ he said, ‘shall come with
me,

Of all this waiting and insistent band.

Of what God gave, you built your paradise;

Behold your mansion waiting in the skies.’

p. 152
THE
NAMELESS

Unnumbered gods may unremembered die;

A thousand creeds may perish and pass by;

Yet do I lift mine eyes to ONE on high.

Unnamed be HE from whom creation came;

There is no word whereby to speak His name

But petty men have mouthed it into shame.

I lift mine eyes, and with a river’s
force

My love’s full tide goes sweeping on its course

To that supreme and all-embracing Source.

Then back through all those thirsting channels
roll

The mighty billows of the Over Soul.

And I am He, the portion and the Whole.

As little streams before the flood-tide
flee,

As rivers vanish to become the sea,

The I exists no more, for I AM HE.

p. 153
THE
WORD

Oh, a word is a gem, or a stone, or a song,

Or a flame, or a two-edged sword;

Or a rose in bloom, or a sweet perfume,

Or a drop of gall, is a word.

You may choose your word like a connoisseur,

And polish it up with art,

But the word that sways, and stirs, and stays,

Is the word that comes from the heart.

You may work on your word a thousand weeks,

But it will not glow like one

That all unsought, leaps forth white hot,

When the fountains of feeling run.

You may hammer away on the anvil of thought,

And fashion your word with care,

But unless you are stirred to the depths, that word

Shall die on the empty air.

p.
154
For the word that comes from the brain alone,

Alone to the brain will speed;

But the word that sways, and stirs, and stays,

Oh! that is the word men heed.

p.
155
ASSISTANCE

Lean on no mortal, Love, and serve;

(For service is love’s complement)

But it was never God’s intent,

Your spirit from its path should swerve,

To gain another’s point of view.

As well might Jupiter, or Mars

Go seeking help from other stars,

Instead of sweeping ON, as you.

Look to the Great Eternal Cause

And not to any man, for light.

Look in; and learn the wrong, and right,

From your own soul’s unwritten laws.

And when you question, or demur,

Let Love be your Interpreter.

p.
156
‘CREDULITY’

If fallacies come knocking at my door,

I’d rather feed, and shelter full a score,

Than hide behind the black portcullis, doubt,

And run the risk of barring one Truth out.

And if pretension for a time deceive,

And prove me one too ready to believe,

Far less my shame, than if by stubborn act,

I brand as lie, some great colossal Fact.

On my soul’s door, the latch-string hangs
outside;

Within, the lighted candle.  Let me guide

Some errant follies, on their wandering way,

Rather, than Wisdom give no welcoming ray.

p.
157
CONSCIOUSNESS

God, what a glory, is this consciousness,

Of life on life, that comes to those who seek!

Nor would I, if I might, to others speak,

The fulness of that knowledge.  It can bless,

Only the eager souls, that willing, press

Along the mountain passes, to the peak.

Not to the dull, the doubting, or the weak,

Will Truth explain, or Mystery confess.

Not to the curious or impatient soul

That in the start, demands the end be shown,

And at each step, stops waiting for a sign;

But to the tireless toiler toward the goal,

Shall the great miracles of God be known

And life revealed, immortal and divine.

p. 158
THE
STRUCTURE

Upon the wreckage of thy yesterday

Design the structure of to-morrow.  Lay

Strong corner stones of purpose, and prepare

Great blocks of wisdom, cut from past despair.

Shape mighty pillars of resolve, to set

Deep in the tear-wet mortar of regret.

Work on with patience.  Though thy toil be slow,

Yet day by day the edifice shall grow.

Believe in God—in thine own self believe.

All that thou hast desired thou shalt achieve.

p. 159
OUR
SOULS

Our souls should be vessels receiving

The waters of love for relieving

The sorrows of men.

For here lies the pleasure of living:

In taking God’s bounties, and giving

The gifts back again.

p. 160
THE
LAW

When the great universe was wrought

To might and majesty from naught,

The all creative force was—

Thought
.

That force is thine.  Though desolate

The way may seem, command thy fate.

Send forth thy thought—

Create—
Create
!

p.
161
KNOWLEDGE

Would you believe in Presences Unseen—

In life beyond this earthly life?

BE STILL: Be stiller yet; and listen.  Set the screen

Of silence at the portal of your will.

Relax, and let the world go by unheard.

And seal your lips with some all-sacred word.

Breathe ‘God,’ in any
tongue—it means the same;

LOVE ABSOLUTE: Think, feel, absorb the thought;

Shut out all else; until a subtle flame

(A spark from God’s creative centre caught)

Shall permeate your being, and shall glow,

Increasing in its splendour, till, YOU KNOW.

p.
162
Not in a moment, or an hour, or day

The knowledge comes; the power is far too great,

To win in any desultory way.

No soul is worthy till it learns to wait.

Day after day be patient, then, oh, soul;

Month after month—till, lo! the goal! the goal!

p.
163
GIVE

Give, and thou shalt receive.  Give
thoughts of cheer,

Of courage and success, to friend and stranger.

And from a thousand sources, far and near,

Strength will be sent thee in thy hour of
danger.

Give words of comfort, of defence, and hope,

To mortals crushed by sorrow and by error.

And though thy feet through shadowy paths may grope,

Thou shalt not walk in loneliness or terror.

Give of thy gold, though small thy portion
be.

Gold rusts and shrivels in the hand that keeps
it.

It grows in one that opens wide and free.

Who sows his harvest is the one who reaps it.

Give of thy love, nor wait to know the worth

Of what thou lovest; and ask no returning.

And wheresoe’er thy pathway leads on earth,

There thou shalt find the lamp of love-light
burning.

p.
164
PERFECTION

The leaf that ripens only in the sun

Is dull and shrivelled ere its race is run.

The leaf that makes a carnival of death

Must tremble first before the north wind’s breath.

The life that neither grief nor burden knows

Is dwarfed in sympathy before its close.

The life that grows majestic with the years

Must taste the bitter tonic found in tears.

p.
165
FEAR

Fear is the twin of Faith’s sworn foe,
Distrust.

If one breaks in your heart the other must.

Fear is the open enemy of Good.

It means the God in man misunderstood.

Who walks with Fear adown life’s road
will meet

His boon companions, Failure and Defeat.

But look the bully boldly in the eyes,

With mien undaunted, and he turns and flies.

p. 166
THE
WAY

Between the finite and the infinite

The missing link of Love has left a void.

Supply the link, and earth with Heaven will join

In one continued chain of endless life.

Hell is wherever Love is not, and Heaven

Is Love’s location.  No dogmatic creed,

No austere faith based on ignoble fear

Can lead thee into realms of joy and peace.

Unless the humblest creatures on the earth

Are bettered by thy loving sympathy

Think not to find a Paradise beyond.

There is no sudden entrance into Heaven.

Slow is the ascent by the path of Love.

p.
167
UNDERSTOOD

I value more than I despise

My tendency to sin,

Because it helps me sympathise

With all my tempted kin.

He who has nothing in his soul

That links him to the sod,

Knows not that joy of self-control

Which lifts him up to God.

And I am glad my heart can say,

When others trip and fall

(Although I safely passed that way),

‘I understand it all.’

p. 168
HIS
MANSION

There was a thought he hid from all men’s
eyes,

And by his prudent life and deeds of worth

He left a goodly record upon earth

As one both pure and wise.

But when he reached a dark unsightly door

Beyond the grave, there stood his secret thought.

It was the mansion he had built and brought

To dwell in, on that shore.

p.
169
EFFECT

An unkind tale was whispered in his ear.

He paused to hear.

His thoughts were food that helped a falsehood thrive,

And keep alive.

Years dawned and died.  One day by
venom’s tongue

His name was stung.

He cried aloud, nor dreamed the lie was spawn

Of thoughts long gone.

Each mental wave we send out from the mind,

Or base, or kind,

Completes its circuit, then with added force

Seeks its own source.

p.
170
THREE THINGS

Know this, ye restless denizens of earth,

Know this, ye seekers after joy and mirth,

Three things there are, eternal in their worth.

Love, that outreaches to the humblest
things;

Work that is glad, in what it does and brings;

And faith that soars upon unwearied wings.

Divine the Powers that on this trio wait.

Supreme their conquest, over Time and Fate.

Love, Work, and Faith—these three alone are great.

p.
171
OBSTACLES

‘The slothful man saith, There is a lion in
the way; a lion is in the street.’—
Proverbs
xxvi. 13.

There are no lions in the street;

No lions in the way.

Go seek the goal, thou slothful soul,

Awake, awake, I say.

Thou dost but dream of obstacles;

In God’s great lexicon,

That word illstarred, no page has marred;

Press on, I say, press on.

Nothing can keep thee from thine own

But thine own slothful mind.

To one who knocks, each door unlocks;

And he who seeks, shall find.

p.
172
PRAYER

Lean on thyself until thy strength is tried;

Then ask God’s help; it will not be denied.

Use thine own sight to see the way to go;

When darkness falls ask God the path to show.

Think for thyself and reason out thy plan;

God has His work and thou hast thine, oh, man.

Exert thy will and use it for control;

God gave thee jurisdiction of thy soul.

All thine immortal powers bring into play;

Think, act, strive, reason, then look up and pray.

p.
173
CLIMBING

Who climbs the mountain does not always
climb.

The winding road slants downward many a time;

Yet each descent is higher than the last.

Has thy path fallen?  That will soon be past.

Beyond the curve the way leads up and on.

Think not thy goal forever lost or gone.

Keep moving forward; if thine aim is right

Thou canst not miss the shining mountain height.

Who would attain to summits still and fair,

Must nerve himself through valleys of despair.

p.
174
‘THERE IS NO DEATH, THERE ARE NO DEAD’

(
Suggested by the book of Mr.
Ed. C. Randall
.)

‘There is no death, there are no
dead.’

From zone to zone, from sphere to sphere,

The souls of all who pass from here

By hosts of living thoughts are led;

And dark or bright, those souls must tread

The paths they fashioned year on year.

For hells are built of hate or fear,

And heavens of love our lives have shed.

Across unatlassed worlds of space,

And through God’s mighty universe,

With thoughts that bless or thoughts that curse,

Each journeys to his rightful place.

Oh, greater truth no man has said,

‘There is no death, there are no
dead.’

p.
175
It lifts the mourner from the sod,

And bids him cast away the reed

Of some uncomforting poor creed,

And walk with Knowledge for a rod.

It bids the doubter seek the broad

Vast fields, where living facts will feed

All those whose patience proves their need

Of these immortal truths of God.

It brings before the eyes of faith

Those realms of radiance, tier on tier,

Where our beloved ‘dead’ appear,

More beautiful because of ‘death.’

It speaks to grief: ‘Be comforted;

There is no death, there are no dead.’

REALISATION

Hers was a lonely, shadowed lot;

Or so the unperceiving thought,

Who looked no deeper than her face,

Devoid of chiselled lines of grace—

No farther than her humble grate,

And wondered how she bore her fate.

Yet she was neither lone nor sad;

So much of love her spirit had,

She found an ever-flowing spring

Of happiness in everything.

So near to her was Nature’s heart

It seemed a very living part

Of her own self; and bud and blade,

And heat and cold, and sun and shade,

And dawn and sunset, Spring and Fall,

Held raptures for her, one and all.

p.
177
The year’s four changing seasons brought

To her own door what thousands sought

In wandering ways and did not find—

Diversion and content of mind.

She loved the tasks that filled each
day—

Such menial duties; but her way

Of looking at them lent a grace

To things the world deemed commonplace.

Obscure and without place or name,

She gloried in another’s fame.

Poor, plain and humble in her dress,

She thrilled when beauty and success

And wealth passed by, on pleasure bent;

They made earth seem so opulent.

Yet none of quicker sympathy,

When need or sorrow came, than she.

And so she lived, and so she died.

She woke as from a dream.  How wide

And wonderful the avenue

That stretched to her astonished view!

And up the green ascending lawn

A palace caught the rays of dawn.

p.
178
Then suddenly the silence stirred

With one clear keynote of a bird;

A thousand answered, till ere long

The air was quivering bits of song.

She rose and wandered forth in awe,

Amazed and moved by all she saw,

For, like so many souls who go

Away from earth, she did not know

The cord was severed.

Down
the street,

With eager arms stretched forth to greet,

Came one she loved and mourned in youth;

Her mother followed; then the truth

Broke on her, golden wave on wave,

Of knowledge infinite.  The grave,

The body and the earthly sphere

Were gone!  Immortal life was here!

They led her through the Palace halls;

From gleaming mirrors on the walls

She saw herself, with radiant mien,

And robed in splendour like a queen,

While glory round about her shone.

‘All this,’ Love murmured, ‘is your
own.’

p.
179
And when she gazed with wondering eye,

And questioned whence and where and why,

Love answered thus: ‘All Heaven is made

By thoughts on earth; your walls were laid,

Year after year, of purest gold;

The beauty of your mind behold

In this fair palace; ay, and more

Waits farther on, so vast your store.

I was not worthy when I died

To take my place here at your side;

I toiled through long and weary years

From lower planes to these high spheres;

And through the love you sent from earth

I have attained a second birth.

Oft when my erring soul would tire

I felt the strength of your desire;

I heard you breathe my name in prayer,

And courage conquered weak despair.

Ah! earth needs heaven, but heaven indeed

Of earth has just as great a need.’

Across the terrace with a bound

There sped a lambkin and a hound

(Dumb comrades of the old earth land)

And fondled her caressing hand.

p.
180
‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’

Was answered to her questioning eyes;

‘You taught them love; love has no end!

Nor does love’s life on form depend.

If there be mortal without love,

He wakes to no new life above.

If love in humbler things exist,

It must through other realms persist

Until all love rays merge in HIM.

Hark!  Hear the heavenly Cherubim!’

Then hushed and awed, with joy so vast

It knew no future and no past,

She stood amidst the radiant throng

That came to swell love’s welcoming song—

This humble soul from earth’s far coast

The centre of the heavenly host.

On earth they see her grave and say:

‘She lies there till the judgment day;’

Nor dream, so limited their thought,

What miracles by love are wrought.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

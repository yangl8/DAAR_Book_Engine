NARRATIVE &c.

[Pg 4]

I am perfectly aware that the public cannot be interested in
my personal history previous to the occurrences which this
narrative is designed to lay before them, nor am I vain enough
to suppose that there would be any thing in it worth relating.
It will, however, be seen necessary that I should state who and
what I was, and under what circumstances I found myself
suddenly placed, by the authorities of the city of Norfolk, in a
position of such unenviable notoriety. This position was not
one of my own seeking, nor was I the agent or representative of
any association. I was not a âNorthern emissary,â engaged in
undermining the institutions of the South, and recklessly defying
her laws, but only a weak and helpless woman, endeavoring to
do what I deemed my duty to God and to humanity. In order
to relate the circumstances as they occurred, so that they may be
fully understood, my narrative must necessarily assume a
personal character, for it was I, and I alone, who was contending
for a heaven-born principle against not only the authorities
of Norfolk, but against the united strength of the whole
State of Virginia. The entire population of the commonwealth
that claims to be the first and noblest in the land were the
plaintiffs in this case, I, alone, the defendant. My story
therefore must not be called egotistical.

[Pg 5]

It is necessary also that I refer to myself, in order to do away
with any impression that I was or am an
Abolitionist
, as that
term is usually understood at the South, for I am aware that a
strong effort will be made to induce this belief on the part of
the community, in order to weaken the effect which I hope my
book is destined to produce. I deem it proper, then, to state
at the outset that such is not the case, and that I was not contending
against any of the Southern institutions, but only
against a particular law of the State of Virginia, and of, as I
believe, some of the neighboring States. Against the operations
of this law, a large portion of even the inhabitants of Virginia
are beginning to rebel, as contrary, not only to good morals, but
to the spirit of our countryâs institutions. This law, although
connected with slavery as a Southern institution, has not necessarily
anything to do with the abstract question of slavery itself.
It is one that might exist in a free State, though, happily it does
not. It is a law whose influence is felt, not only among the
slave population of Virginia, but which extends even to the
whites themselves. By a recent statement made to the Legislature
of Virginia, the number of grown up white men and women
in the State is estimated at nine hundred thousand, and of this
number there are no-less than eighty thousand who can neither
read nor write. The law, in concise terms, prohibits the instruction
of all colored persons, by means of books or printed papers, but it
does not prevent the giving of verbal or oral instruction even to
slaves. In some of the Southern States a similar law exists in
reference only to the slave population, but I was not aware until
my arrest, that the law of Virginia was more stringent, and
included in its operation the free colored people as well as the
slaves. Had I known this, and had I not the constant example
before me of those whom I supposed were well informed as to
this matter, I should not have dared to set myself up in opposition
to the laws of a State of which I was a resident.

I repeat, therefore, most emphatically, that I was not an Abolitionist,
and that no person or persons had anything to do with
the course I pursued, in even the most indirect manner. I am
a Southern woman, by birth, education, and principles. I have
been a slaveholder myself, and, if circumstances rendered it necessary
or practicable, I might be such again. With the abstract
question of slavery I have nothing to do in this book. I write
it as a Southern woman to the people of the South. I am and
always have been one of them, and still possess the same attachment
for them and their institutions, that was first instilled into
me in my childhood, and which has grown stronger during my
whole life among them.

[Pg 6]

I was born in the city of Washington, but removed at a very
early age to Charleston, South Carolina; where I was subsequently
married, and resided, until the year 1845, when the
painful associations connected with the death of my only son
induced me to remove to Norfolk, Virginia, where I led a quiet
and unobtrusive life, with my only daughter, until the month of
December, 1853. Having been thrown upon my own resources,
and possessed of a too independent spirit to be a burden to
those who might have assisted me, I supported myself and
child by the labor of my hands; my business being that of
vest-making. Being a superior workwoman, I always had an
abundance of the best work to do; but it was necessary for me
to labor incessantly, in order to maintain myself and daughter
respectably. Being blessed with good health, I was enabled to
do this. We lived alone, in a retired part of the city, and our
circle of acquaintances, from choice, not from necessity, was
rather limited. Our habits were industrious, frugal and retiring.
We were respected, and led lives that were irreproachable, as
was abundantly conceded by even the Judge before whom I was
tried. Our only association with society was that into which
we were led by the exercise of our feelings of humanity; it
being our natural disposition to share the little goods we possessed
with those who were in want or affliction of any sort. We
now enjoy the happy satisfaction of knowing that we have left
behind us, many grateful hearts, in those whose distress we have
relieved, or with whose sorrows we have sympathized.

This brief history of myself and my antecedents, seemed necessary,
in order to show who and what I was, and to effectually
put down the assertions of some of the Southern editors, that I
was an Abolitionist in disguise, or, at least, was acting at the
instigation of those who are enemies to the South and her institutions.
I shall now proceed to relate, as succinctly as possible,
the history of my personal contest with the great and dignified
State of Virginia, as represented in the persons of a few men in
power in the honorable city of Norfolk.

[Pg 7]

Being perfectly satisfied with my daughterâs society, I craved
no other, and endeavored to practice the precepts which I wished
to instil into her mind, and, as she grew older, we went on
hand in hand in our little benevolent duties, making allowances
for the faults of others, practicing mercy and charity to all who
came in our way, both black and white; and, as I am a strong
advocate for the religious instruction of the whole human family,
it fell to our lot to become the religious and moral instructors of
a few little colored free children.

There is a well known barber living in the city of Norfolk, a
genteel and respectable colored man, much respected in that
community. Having some business with him, I one day called
at his shop, into which he politely invited me. Casting my eyes
around, they fell upon two little colored boys, with spelling
books in their hands, which they appeared to be very attentively
engaged in studying. I inquired if they were his children, and
if they went to school. His reply was, that they were his, but
that they did not go to school, though he was very anxious to
have them learn. I then inquired if there were no day schools
for free colored children. He smiled, and said, No, madam;
and he believed that there was no one who took interest enough
in little colored children to keep a day school for them. I replied,
that this was a pity, but that there was certainly a large
Sunday school connected with Christâs Church, to which he
might send his children. His answer was, that his children did
attend that school, but that they did not learn much; as they
had no one to assist them in their lessons during the week; that
he kept them at their books, whenever they had any spare time,
and that they would occasionally pick up a little instruction from
those who visited his shop. I inquired if he had any education
himself. He said no, but that he indeed felt the want of it,
and was very thankful to any one who would take the trouble to
instruct his children. I then found that he had five children,
[Pg 8]

three of whom were little girls, and that they were all very
anxious to learn. Without further consideration or hesitation,
I then offered to allow my daughter to teach his little boys,
stating that she would do so with great pleasure. I told him to
send them every day to my house, and that it need not detain
them long from his business. He thanked me very kindly, and
said that he would send them, although their time was very valuable
to him, as they were obliged to wait upon the gentlemen
who visited his shop. His eagerness for the instruction of his
children deeply interested me, and, on my return home, I related
the circumstance to my daughter, who readily assented to my
proposal. Having no further business with this man, I saw no
more of him, and had nearly forgotten the occurrence, until
he called at my house with his little girls. I received him politely,
and spoke kindly to his children, who were neatly dressed,
and very respectful, and appeared unusually intelligent. Their
father then said, âMrs. Douglass, I have told my little girls of
your kind offer to instruct their brothers, and they are also very
anxious to learn, and I wish to know if you would not prefer to
have these two eldest, thinking that the boys might give your
daughter too much trouble.â I replied that it would be no
trouble, but a pleasure to us, and that he might send both the
boys and girls regularly every day, and that we would do all we
could for their religious and moral instruction. I then inquired
if they had any books. He replied, only such as had been given
them at Christ Church Sunday school. âVery well,â said I,
âgive them those books, and send them to-morrow.â I felt certain
that there could be nothing wrong in doing during the week
what was done on Sunday by the teachers in that school, who

[Pg 9]
were members of some of the first families in Norfolk, nor in
using the very books that were given to the children there
taught. I was particular also to ascertain that both himself and
family were free, as I knew that the laws of the Southern states
did not permit the slaves to be educated, although at the same
time, all the churches in Norfolk were actually instructing from
books both slave and free colored children, and had done so for
years without molestation.

On the day following the two little girls made their appearance
alone, their father being unable to spare their brothers from his
business. My daughter received her little scholars kindly, and
endeavored to make them feel as comfortably as strange children
can feel in a strange house. At this time I lived in a neat little
house, containing four rooms, situated in a quiet and respectable
neighbourhood, with everything genteel and comfortable
around us, gathered together by our own industry. In this
house I had lived nearly four years. It was alone, and I
had engaged it before it was finished, thinking it would form a
quiet and retired home for myself and daughter. Whether it
proved to be such or not, my readers will see. Nearly the whole
block was built up with small tenements, and I soon found that
my neighbors were not of the most refined class, and would prove
no associates for us. I therefore determined to live very secluded,
and be seldom seen or heard. Still, I endeavored to be
kind and obliging to all who stood in need of my sympathies,
and made it my business, if any of them were sick or in trouble,
to administer to their wants by sending nourishment, or, if necessary,
by calling to see them in person; still receiving none as

[Pg 10]
visitors at my house; for they were a class of people with little
or no education, and, of course, refinement they knew nothing of.
They did not appreciate my character and habits, and could not understand
my retired way of living, and at times we were greatly
annoyed by them. This I could not at first understand, as I
knew I did not merit any unkindness from them, but I endeavored
to bear my persecutions with patience, and continued
to live in my own solitary way, my daughter attending to our
little domestic affairs, and I steadily employed with my needle.

[Pg 11]

The two little girls continued to come every day, and were
well behaved and very obedient. They soon became indeed, a
source of pleasure to us. They were very attentive to their
studies, and with my daughterâs unremitting attention, they
made rapid progress. They were with us nearly a month, when
my daughter remarked to me, that she would be very sorry to
part with them, as they learned very fast, and every day required
more of her attention, and she feared that they would
interfere with her other duties. Now, up to this time, I had
not anticipated receiving any compensation for the tuition of
those children, nor had I dreamed of establishing a regular
school. What I had done had been merely from the impulses
of common humanity, without a thought of reward. I casually
asked my daughter which she would prefer, to teach those
children, or assist me in sewing; and if she would be willing to
take charge of a small class of free colored children. She replied
that she was fond of children, and would be glad to teach
them if she could establish a class. âVery well,â I said, âyou
shall do so: we will open a school on the first of next
month, (which was June, 1852,) for free colored children.â I
thereupon sent word to
Mr.
Robinson, the father of the two
little girls, notifying him of our intention, and stating that he
might send us all the scholars that he could, and that the price
of tuition would be three dollars per quarter. We were at once
overrun with applications, and our little school was soon formed
and well regulated, the children punctual in their attendance,
and under good discipline. My daughter paid strict attention
to them, and they made rapid progress in their studies. Our
school numbered twenty-five pupils, of both sexes, and continued
in prosperous existence about eleven months. We made no
secret of the matter, and never intended to do so, nor could we,
had we desired to ever so much.

[Pg 12]

My readers will therefore perceive, that the formation of our
little school arose from a circumstance entirely accidental, I
having at first offered simply to teach two or three colored children
their Sunday school lessons; they being members of Christâs
Church Sunday school; and from the very books given to them
by the ladies and gentlemen engaged in that school. Finding
those children obedient and well behaved, as well as anxious to
be taught, I became deeply interested in their welfare, and continued
from time to time to receive all who offered themselves
as pupils. Living a life so retired, I needed an occupation involving
some care, and was glad to be engaged in a duty so benevolent.
We attended strictly to their moral and religious instruction,
and, when they were sick, we promptly visited them, and administered
to their wants, and, I am indeed happy to say, although
I was afterwards cruelly cast into prison and otherwise unjustly
dealt with, I have the satisfaction of knowing that I suffered in
a good and righteous cause. I was totally ignorant of any existing
law prohibiting the instruction of free colored children, but,
at the same time, I was careful to have no slaves among our
scholars. Every thing passed on quietly for several months, in
the ordinary routine of a childâs school, with nothing to interest
my readers particularly, unless it be one incident which will
never be forgotten by us, viz: the death of one of our little
scholars, the circumstances of which I will here take the liberty
to relate.

[Pg 13]

She was about fourteen years of age, and, while at school, she
was mild, humble and obedient, and studied very hard. Her
form was slender and her constitution very delicate. I frequently
thought that her close application to her books would injure
her health, though she seemed predestined to an early grave.
She was at length taken seriously ill, and we visited her as
frequently as our engagements would permit. Will my readers
go with me into a tottering negro hovel, situated in the very
heart of the city of Norfolk? It is a miserable apology for a
human habitation, containing but two apartments, one above the
other. On one side of the first, or ground floor, is a wretched
bed, supported by some boards and broken chairs, and on it
lies one of Mrs. Douglassâs sable scholars, her young life fast
ebbing away under the ravages of a rapid consumption. Her
mother, poor woman, is little better off, and her hollow cough tells
too truly that her own days are numbered. With a constitution
naturally delicate, and almost worn out by constant watching,
she is unable to earn anything to add to her little stores, or even
to obtain the slightest necessary nourishment for her dying child.
Here is a scene of suffering, and no one to administer to the
wants of the dying or the living. Common humanity calls
loudly for the exercise of simple charity, but the cry is unheard.

Quietly and alone, my daughter and myself sat up, night after
night, with the suffering child, and endeavored to smooth her
pathway to the grave. She seemed far more happy and contented
when we were beside her, and we therefore gave to her all
the time we could possibly spare. On the night that she died we
sat with her until a late hour, and, as we were leaving her, she
said, in broken accents;ââI thank you, Mrs. Douglass and
Miss Rosa, for all you have done for me: you have taught me
to pray and to read my Bible, but I shall never read it again;
you must pray for me before you go.â We did so, and left her
in a quiet slumber, from which she awoke only, as we trust, in
heaven. We took charge of the funeral arrangements, had her
poor corpse neatly attired for its last repose, and saw that every
thing was done decently and in order. Six of her school mates,
selected previously by herself, dressed in white, acted as pall
bearers at the funeral, and were followed by the rest of the
school, I in a close carriage bringing up the rear of the procession.
Yes, I followed to the grave the remains of a poor little
negro child, and as this was a stretch of humanity that the good
people of Norfolk could neither appreciate nor understand, I suppose
I may trace to it the beginning of their future persecutions,
which resulted finally in the descent upon my establishment by
the officers of the law.

[Pg 14]

The descent was made on my school on the 9th day of May,
1853, between eight and nine oâclock in the morning, when the
children had nearly all assembled. No note of warning had
been given of this movement, and it was as unexpected as the
sudden upheavings of an earthquake. Our school-room was
situated in the second story back room. My daughter had but
a few moments before taken her seat at her humble pine table,
and was surrounded by her little sable scholars. Sable, did I
say? No, not all; for in many cases the difference could
scarcely be perceived between them and white children. Yes,
Mrs. Douglass âcondescendedâ to teach free black menâs children,
and free white menâs childrenâsome of the latter being,
very probably, among her real persecutors! It was a horrible
crime, was it not?

[Pg 15]

All was going on as peaceably as usual, and I had taken my
seat to commence my daily toil, when a loud knock was made
at my front door. I answered it myself, when the face of an
officer presented itself, who inquired who lived up stairs. I
replied that I alone occupied the house. He then asked if
Mrs. Douglass lived there. I told him that I was Mrs. Douglass.
He said, âYou keep a school.â âYes, sir,â was my
reply. âA school for colored children?â I answered, âyes.â
âI must see those children,â said he. I then demanded what
business he had with them, or with anything in my house. He
replied, that he had been sent by the Mayor. âVery good,
sir,â said I, âwalk in, and you shall see them;â and, without
giving my daughter or the children any notice, I invited him
up stairs into the school-room. Never will I forget the frightened
state of those children, and the countenance of their young
teacher. My daughter sat paralyzed, covering her face with
her hands; and it was some time before I could restore order
in the room. Some were crying, some exclaiming âOh my!
oh my!â and some clinging around me in their terror; but,
during the excitement, I never lost my presence of mind. As
soon as I had restored quiet in the room, I inquired of
Mr.

Cherry, the City Constable, what he wanted with those children.
He replied, that he must take them before the Mayor.
âVery well, sir,â said I, âmy daughter and myself will accompany
them.â To my astonishment, he went to the head of the
stairs and gave a loud rap with his club, when another officer
made his appearance, entering from my back door. For the
moment I thought that my house was surrounded with officers,
who perhaps fancied that they had found a nest of thieves.
They then noted down the names of all the children, as well as
those of their parents. When they had finished, I politely informed

Mr.
Cherry that they were all free children, and all, or
nearly all, members of the Christâs Church Sunday-school. âIt
makes no difference, madam,â he replied, âit is a violation of
the law to teach any person of color to read or write, slave or
free, and an act punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary.â
âVery well,â I replied, âif they send me to the penitentiary,
it will be in a good cause, and not a disgraceful one.â
Even this information, which was the most profound news to
me, did not unnerve me at all: for I remembered that our Saviour
was persecuted for doing good, and why should not I be.
This thought strengthened me to bear my own persecutions for
ten long months afterwards.

[Pg 16]

The officers having left the school room, I politely escorted
them down stairs, proffering them seats until I made some
alterations in my dress before I accompanied them to the
Mayorâs office. I immediately returned to the school room, and
found the children in a dreadful state of excitement. I must
here inform my readers that all persons of color in the Southern,
or Slave States, have a dreadful horror of constables, for it is
these officers to whom is entrusted the execution of their punishment
for all offences. After I had again brought the children
to order, I was ready to accompany the officers. I arranged the
children in couples and gave them up to the officers, and we all
started for the Mayorâs office, my daughter and myself walking
at a little distance in the rear. Will my readers please imagine,
for an instant, a crowd of little children, walking two and two,
preceded and followed by two stout men, each with a great club
in his hands? It reminded me of a flock of little lambs going
to the slaughter.

[Pg 17]

We soon reached the Mayorâs Court, and were seated until his
honor was ready for an examination. Many spectators were
present to witness the wonderful sight of a sudden descent upon
a negro school. I had a casual acquaintance with his honor,
Mayor Stubbs, as I had been before reported to him for an act
of humanity to a helpless and worthy little woman and her two
infant children. I had been made acquainted with her sufferings
and miserable situation, and, from time to time, for two
years, I had bestowed upon her many acts of kindness and
sympathy, as cordially as though she had been my own sister.
She had a drunken and worthless husband, who, when in a state
of inebriation, was very violent and brutal to her, and who
would often leave her for weeks at a time, without a cent, and
almost in a state of starvation. At those emergencies she would
subsist solely on what she received from my bounty. Finally,
her young child, about one year old, was taken very ill. She
was a kind and affectionate mother, and grieved much for her
little boy. I endeavored to obtain assistance for her in the
humane and benevolent city of Norfolk, but in vain. I alone
clung to her to the last. She resided at some distance from my
house. Her child lay for some weeks in a very critical condition,
and I could not do as much for her as I desired to do. At this
time her husband was away on one of his drunken carousals in
the city, and not even the sufferings of his dying child could
soften his brutal heart. I finally concluded to take her and her
children into my own house, and made the proposition to her,
which she received with much gratitude, and readily assented to.
By my advice she soon had her little chattels gathered together
and sent them to an auctioneer. The room was soon emptied,
and, with her two sick children, she hastened to my house,
where, with our united attentions, we succeeded in raising the
little sufferer to health. The facts in this case having been
reported to Mayor Stubbs, he called in person to see me, and
proved himself to be a good man, as he afterwards was a merciful
judge. I relate this little circumstance merely to show my first
acquaintance with this gentleman.

It was about a year after this occurrence when I entered his
court-room with my little school, in obedience to his somewhat
pressing invitation, and attended by his two officers as a guard
of honor.

[Pg 19]

I felt certain that he was a man who desired peace in his
community, as well as one disposed to temper justice with
mercy to all. In about fifteen minutes we were called before
him, and the children arranged on one side of the room. He
greeted me very cordially with a âGood morning, Mrs. Douglass.â
I politely returned his salutation, when he remarked
that I had quite a large family. I said yes, and that they were
all very good children. âBut, are you aware,â he inquired,
âthat it is a violation of the law of this State to instruct colored
children to read?â I replied, that I had not been aware of the
existing law until that morning; that these were all free children,
and that every one before him was a member of the
Christâs Church Sunday-school; that this school was held at
the lecture-room on Freemason street, where primers and other
books were given to them to learn to read; and that, if I had
violated the law, they had been doing so for years. The Mayor
replied that such facts had never been reported to him, or he
should have been obliged to do his duty in the matter. A gentleman,
who was present, voluntarily asserted that there was a
large Sunday-school kept there for colored children, and that he
thought a violation of the law was such as much in one place as
another. His Honor then took up the statutes of Virginia, and
read the law on the subject, which announced the maximum
penalty attached to its violation to be a fine of one hundred dollars
and imprisonment for six months. He also remarked that
he was very sorry the matter had occurred, but that he must
do his duty in the premises. I replied, that I expected him to
do his duty; but that with a clear conscience I could bear imprisonment,
or anything else. I asked him if anything would
be done with the children. He said, âNothing,â and gave immediate
orders for their dismissal, when they fled like so many
little birds let loose from a cage. I could not refrain from
tears as I looked after them as they left the room, and hastened
from what was to them a place of exceeding terror. I was rejoiced
that no harm would fall upon them, and felt that I could
bear anything rather than that they should suffer in any way.
I then inquired if anything would be done with their parents, and
was answered, âNothing.â I then asked his Honor if he could
allow the whole responsibility of the matter to rest upon myself;
that my daughter was not yet of age, and that I was alone
responsible for any act of hers, as well as my own. He inquired
if I had any friends who would become security for my appearance
before the Supreme Court. âFriends!â I replied âI am
my own best friend, and my daughterâs only one.â I told him
to do his duty, and put me in prison at once, if he chose, for I
would ask no favors at the hands of any man. On receiving
this reply, he reflected for a moment and then said, âI think
that I am allowed some discretion in this matter. You say,
Mrs. Douglass, that you were not aware of the existing law?â I
replied that I was not, and that I was not disposed to violate
the laws of any people or place where I might reside. He then,
being perfectly satisfied with my good intentions, frank acknowledgment,
and ignorance of the law, dismissed the matter; for
which I tendered him my thanks, and left the court room.

[Pg 20]

Imagine my surprise, when I reached the steps of the courthouse,
to find a crowd of colored men, women, and children, the
parents and relatives of friends of our little scholars, waiting to
learn the decision of the Mayor. They greeted myself and
daughter with many blessings, and said that if we had anything
to pay they had the money ready for us. I replied that such
was not the case, and that there had been no harm done; and
after warmly thanking them for their kindness and sympathy,
we looked around for our little scholars, gathered as many of
them as we could together, and took them back to the school-room,
where we gave each of them their books and slates, and,
with wounded hearts, took leave of them, one by one. It was a
sad parting, and we grieved to think that they must henceforth
grow up in darkness and ignorance. For several days it was as
much as we could do to receive the visits of the parents and
friends of those children, many of whom we had never seen before.
They lamented over the breaking up of our little school,
and many shed tears freely. They showered their blessings upon
us, and prayed for our welfare, and were evidently truly grateful
for all we had done for their children.

It is generally thought in the Southern States that the negroes
are ungrateful, but I, for one, have never found them so. From
the day that I first interested myself in these unfortunate people,
to the day I left the city of Norfolk, they literally showered
upon us their grateful blessings. In my opinion, those who call
the Southern negroes ungrateful, are only those who never do
anything to call forth that emotion. I believe the oppressed to
be more susceptible of gratitude than any other class. I have
ever found them so. May I ask what gratitude do they owe to
those who will degrade them? What gratitude does that child
owe to his own father, who coldly sells him as his slave? Let
us first practice justice and mercy ourselves, and then ask for
the gratitude of our slaves.

[Pg 21]

My scholars having been dismissed, and the school given up,
in obedience to the requirements of the law, I felt perfectly
satisfied that the matter had there ended. I had promised my
daughter, some months before, a visit to New York, during the
intended vacation of our school, but the authorities did not
allow us the pleasure of thus indulging our scholars, having
given them an earlier and much longer vacation than we ever
dreamed of.

My daughter left Norfolk on the 29th day of June, for the
city of New York, intending to return about the first of September.
In her absence I was left entirely alone, without even a
servant, and so remained for about six months, seldom going
out, and receiving but few visitors, aside from my little scholars
who would occasionally come to see me, and bring some little
token of their continued affection. They all knew that I was
very fond of flowers, and it was seldom that my table did not
contain bouquets from their hands. Indeed, they kept me supplied
with flowers during the whole summer. I still continued
to visit them whenever they were sick, for I knew that no authorities
could prevent this. Both I and my friends supposed that
the matter was forever ended, until the 13th day of July, when,
to my utter astonishment, I was served with a legal paper, of
which the following is a correct copy:â

â
The Commonwealth of Virginia

To the Sergeant of the City of Norfolk
:

[Pg 22]

You are hereby commanded to summon Margaret Douglass,
and Rosa Douglass, to appear before the Judge of our Circuit
Court of the City of Norfolk, at the Court House of our said
City, on the first day of the next November Term, to answer a
presentment of the Grand Jury made against them in the said
Court, on the 2d day of June, 1853, for this, that the said Margaret
Douglass, and Rosa Douglass, and each of them, did, on
the 9th day of May, 1853, at the City of Norfolk, unlawfully
assemble with divers negroes, for the purpose of instructing them
to read and to write, and did instruct them to read and to write,
contrary to the Act of the General Assembly, in such case made
and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth
of Virginia.

Witness, John Williams, Clerk of our said Court, at the
Court House, this 13th day of July, 1853, in the 78th year of
the Commonwealth.

(Signed,)

This document needs but little comment. I merely ask, was
not the cause a great one that enabled a poor weak woman thus
to disturb âthe peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of
Virginia,â and that, too, âin the 78th yearâ of its existence?
Were not the subject too serious, one might venture to laugh at
the idea of the fearful perils to which that dignified and aristocratic
State was subjected, by the fact that a few little negro boys
and girls had learned that famous sentence âIn Adamâs fall we
sinned all.â Let the fact be recorded, and go down to posterity
among the noble archives of that noble State, that her existence
was jeopardized in the year 1853, by the shocking occurrence of
some of its inhabitants learning âto read and to write.â Shades
of Henry Clay, of Thomas Jefferson, of John Randolph, and of
all the dead worthies of Virginia, behold a specimen of enlightened
progression that is something more than an abstraction!

[Pg 24]

After receiving this paper, the effect of which I well understood,
my mind was heavily taxed as to what course I should
pursue in the matter. Owing to my retired way of living and
my constant employment, I had but little time to spare from
my daily avocations, but a vast amount of time for reflection.
My pecuniary means being limited, and having but little affection
for lawyers, I determined to rely upon the justice of my
cause, and plead my own case. Therefore, for four months I was
engaged in hard study, hard labor, and hard living, my mind
being as fully occupied as my hands. I determined to converse
with no one, and when the matter would be occasionally brought
up by others, I would have as little to say as possible, and
few knew the course of action that I intended to pursue. In
the first place, I had no quarrel with the people of Virginia, and
did not wish to have, and I determined to enter into no conflict
with them. I also felt certain that, if I employed counsel, many
good men and women of Norfolk, who had done all that I had,
would be brought into the same difficulty. Leaving self entirely
out of the question, I determined not to do anything to place
those engaged in Christâs Church Sunday-school in the same
difficulty with myself, for I heartily approved of what they were
and had been doing. I also believed that, if I kept quiet, the
matter would still amount to nothing. I could not believe that
men who boasted of their talents and benevolence could be so
blinded by their attachment to their peculiar institution as to
farther irritate a matter that would, from beginning to end,
prove disgraceful to them and to their State. I therefore took a
firm stand, and was determined to maintain the principle for
which I was doomed to suffer; for, as I have said before, I am a
strong advocate for the religious and moral instruction of the
Southern slaves. I was determined to express my views freely,
should my case ever be brought before the court. During the
whole of this prosecution, I did nothing, either by word or
action, to irritate the people of Norfolk, and, though I might
have replied to the paragraphs against me inserted in their
newspapers, I did not do so; and, though extremely mortifying
to my feelings to have my name brought so freely into the
public prints, still I was silent, and bore my persecutions with
patience.

Although I corresponded regularly with my daughter every
week, I did not make known to her the condition of affairs, desiring
not to mar her happiness with our northern friends, until
the first of September, when I directed her to remain in New
York, until I should call her home. Thus my readers will see
that my daughter did not ârun awayâ from the authorities of
Norfolk, and the assertions to that effect in their papers were
utterly false. She left Norfolk before the summons was served,
and remained there at my instance, in ignorance of what was
going on at home. Norfolk was our adopted home, and we never
had the slightest idea of running away from it. No, indeed:
we would not so far forget our native dignity, as to have it said
that a South Carolinian ran from a Virginian. As it has since
been proven, the authorities and people of Norfolk would have
been very glad if we had taken this course, in order that they
might at once have been relieved from the odium of pursuing
the prosecution, and at the same time been enabled to brand us
as fugitives from justice. The
Richmond Examiner
has recently
said that my prison doors were open at my bidding. It is very
true that they were, but for what purpose, and how would my
flight have been regarded?

[Pg 25]

Believing that my lonely situation naturally called loudly for
friends, I thought that in that city of churches, some one, at
least among the religious part of the community, would come
forward and offer me sympathy and advice without being solicited
therefor; but will my readers believe me when I say, that not
one solitary individual thus manifested the least interest in the
matter? I determined, therefore, to ask nothing at the hands
of a Virginian, for I had never done so during the eight years
that I had resided among them, and I can truly say that I owe
the people of Norfolk nothing: no, not even for the exercise of
common humanity.

[Pg 27]

As the time drew near when I would be called upon by the
attorney of the commonwealth to appear for trial, I felt myself
thoroughly prepared to meet the worst, and on the first day of
the November Term, I voluntarily stood before him in his office,
and had a brief conversation with him, in which I informed him,
that I was ready to meet the case, and that he would oblige me
by bringing it on as soon as possible, as my mind was heavily
taxed, and I had little time to lose. He promised to do so, and
inquired who was my counsel. I told him that I was my own
counsellor, and should employ no other. It was my first interview
with this gentleman, and I was much pleased with his manner
and conversation. He remarked that he should be placed in a
rather disagreeable position, by having to plead against a lady.
I replied, that I wished to be friendly with him, and hoped that
he would not think me unreasonable: that I expected him to do
his duty, and that I should certainly endeavor to do mine. I
believe that the matter gave him some uneasiness, when he found
that I was determined to plead my own case, and, after explaining
a few points to him, he remarked that the matter had
entirely slipped his memory, and that he had not before thought
seriously about it. He promised to send for me whenever I was
wanted, and soon after did so; but, another case not being concluded,
I was compelled to await still another day. The day of
trial came at last, and I proceeded to the Court House, unattended
by any one, and, seating myself in the jury room, patiently
awaited the summons to appear before the Court. I had provided
myself with a neat and becoming dress, in a description
of which my lady readers may be interested. It was made of
black velvet, fitting closely and neatly to my form, with rich
flowing lace sleeves, white kid gloves, and a plain straw bonnet,
neatly trimmed with white. I had in my hand the copy of the
summons, and a small red pocket Bible, which my daughter
used when she visited the sick children. I had written nothing
that I expected to say, preferring to depend on my own energies
in whatever emergencies I might be placed. Being fully
acquainted with the rules of courtesy, and the respect due from
a lady to every true gentleman, as well as that required by an
honorable Court, I determined not to do the slightest violence to
the feelings of any one present, but to proffer all due consideration
to the Court and counsellors, and I certainly expected the
same in return. In my determination to plead my own case, I
did not desire to step out of the natural sphere of my sex, or to
force myself into the position of a counsellor, but I was the
party most deeply interested; had given the matter all due reflection,
and was best acquainted with its merits; had gathered
together every fragment and woven them into one web, and it
pleased me to unravel it myself; for I was prosecuted for violating
a law that I knew nothing about. Certainly no favors had
been shown to me because I was a woman, and therefore I believed
that I possessed the right to defend myself in my own
way.

As I sat in the jury-room, waiting to be called, that body
were receiving their charge from the judge in some petty case
tried the day before. When they entered, I was invited into
the court-room. The Prosecuting Attorney of the Commonwealth
received me at the door, and we passed in together, I
taking my seat at the counsellorâs table, directly facing his
Honor the learned Judge. I entered the room with a firm step,
walked proudly through the dark cloud of heads that I saw
around me, and when I took my seat I was perfectly calm and
collected. It was some time before the court was fairly organized;
for everybody present seemed to be confused, except
myself. Finally, the jury were sworn, and the witnesses for the
Commonwealth called.

[Pg 28]

Mr.
Cherry, the City Constable, who made the original arrest,
was sworn, and examined by the Prosecuting Attorney; and, as
he testified merely to the facts as they really were, and knew nothing
farther, I did not cross-examine him. The same may be
said of officer Cox, his assistant at the time of the descent upon
the school, who was next called; and also of his Honor, Mayor
Stubbs, neither of whom were questioned by me. The next witness
called for the prosecution was
Mr.
C. C. Melson, the agent
of my landlord, who, although unexpectedly called upon, walked
firmly to the witness stand, placed his hands behind him, fixed his
eyes steadily upon the jury, and answered every question with a
degree of promptness that did him credit. He testified merely
that he was acquainted with me, and was the agent and collector
of rents for
Mr.
Taylor, my landlord; that he rented me the
house, but not for the purpose of keeping a negro school, and
that he did not know that one was kept there; that I engaged
the house when the foundation was laid, and had lived in it
ever since. On being asked if he ever saw any colored children
entering it, he replied that he never watched his tenantsâ houses
to see who went in or out. There was no necessity for cross-examining

Mr.
Melson; and as sufficient facts were deemed
proven, and not denied by me, to substantiate the alleged violation
of the letter of the law, the case for the prosecution here
rested. I then informed the Prosecuting Attorney that I
wished, before examining my witnesses, to make a statement to
the court in reference to my daughterâs absence; and, permission
being granted, I then addressed his Honor and the jury;

[Pg 29]

âI beg leave to inform your honor, and you, gentlemen of the
jury, that my daughter, whose name is joined with mine in this
prosecution, is at present in the city of New York, and was there
at the time the summons was issued and served upon me: but,
if she were in Norfolk at this time, I do not know that you have
any business whatever with her. She is under age, and has
been brought up in strict obedience to me in all things. I am alone
responsible for any act of hers, as well as for my own. I am
here to answer to any charge that may be brought against me.
I have been notified to present myself this day before this court
to answer to the charge of having been engaged in teaching
colored children to read and to write, and I am informed that in
so doing I have been acting against the
peace
and
dignity
of the
Commonwealth. This charge, gentlemen, I do not like, but we
shall see who it is that destroys our
peace
and insults our

dignity
.â

The Prosecuting Attorney here touched me on the arm, thinking
that I was about to discuss the merits of the case before the
testimony was closed. This somewhat disconcerted me, but I
took my seat and soon regained my calmness, and proceeded to
call my witnesses.

[Pg 30]

I had but three,
Mr.
Walter Taylor,
Mr.
Sharp, a lawyer,
and
Mr.
John Williams, also a lawyer and the Clerk of the
Court in which I was being tried. All these gentlemen were
members of Christâs Church, and, together with their wives and
daughters, were teachers and instructors of negroes in the
Sunday-school held habitually in the lecture room of that
Church.
Mr.
Williams had penned with his own hands the
summons that had brought me then before the court, while his
own daughter, Miss Eliza Williams was then teaching in that
Sunday-school the same children that were in our school, and
from the same books that they used with us. Among others
who were also engaged in teaching in that Sunday-school, and
from the same books that we used, I may mention Mrs. Dixon,
Mrs. Southgate, Mrs. Pinkum, Miss Martha Taylor, Miss
Jane Watson, Miss Henrietta Hunter, the
Hon.
Tazewell
Taylor, and even some members of the family of Judge Baker
who presided on the Bench at my trial, and finally fixed and
passed my sentence. In giving the names of these persons, I
am not actuated by any malicious feelings towards them, for I
most heartily approve of all that they have done in the matter
of instructing the colored people of Norfolk, but I do it merely
to show the injustice to which I was subjected, while these individuals,
representing the aristocracy of that town, and who had
done all, and more than I had done, and because they were such
aristocracy, were not only allowed to escape the punishment attached
to the offence of which we were equally guilty, but also
to aid in the prosecution against me, and even sit in judgment
upon me. The deductions from these simple facts are so clear
and simple that I need not direct the attention of my readers to
them more particularly.

The excitement in the Court room, when the names of my
three witnesses were called, was most intense, and when it subsided,

Mr.
Taylor was put upon the stand, and testified as
follows:â

Question.
Was you a teacher in the Christ Church Sunday-school?

Answer.
For the white children I was, and the school was
held in the church.

Q.
Did you never visit the lecture room?

A.
I had nothing to do with the school that was kept there.

Q.
Did you never distribute books to the negro children of
that school?

A.
I attended the library of the school for white children.

Q.
Did you not instruct colored children to read from those
books?

A.
I did not.

[Pg 31]

Mr.
Taylor was not cross-examined by the Prosecuting Attorney,
and I allowed him to take his seat, and called
Mr.
John
Williams, Attorney, and Clerk of the Court. This gentleman
took the stand with a pallid countenance, and quivering lip,
evidently extremely troubled by the position in which he found
himself placed. My benevolent feelings would not allow him
to convict himself or his amiable daughter, and I therefore
asked him a few unimportant questions, and dismissed him. I
then called Lawyer Sharp, who testified as follows:â

Q.
Were you a teacher in the school for colored children,
held in Christâs Church Lecture room?

A.
No, madam.

Q.
Did you not attend the Sabbath-school held there for the
instruction of negro children?

A.
I went there, occasionally, and lectured to them.

Q.
Did you not distribute books among them?

A.

The ladies had all to do with that!

Q.
When you visited that school, did you not instruct them
yourself?

To this question he replied very
sharply
,âthus evincing his
name to be indicative of his character and disposition,âthat they
did not teach them to read and write, and that he did not know
that the law prohibited religious and moral instruction to
negroes.

I answered, âIf you, sir, who are engaged in the practice of
the law, did not know it, how could it be expected that I should?â

âMadam?â said he, as though he did not understand me. I
repeated the question, and he then addressed the Judge, and
asked permission to say what he had to communicate directly to
the jury. I made no objection, and he proceeded to state as
follows:â

[Pg 32]

That certain negroes applied to
Rev.

Mr.
Cummings, the
Pastor of Christâs Church, for religious instruction, and were
allowed to meet for that purpose in the lecture room of the
church. He (Sharp) occasionally visited the school and lectured
to them.
He found that some of them could read very well
, but
that when they came to the hard words,
he allowed them to skip
over them
!

This was sufficient for my purposes. This witness, having at
first denied that the members of that school were taught to read,
when the question was pressed home, endeavored to escape the
perils of his position by saying that
the ladies had all to do with
that
! Oh, brave
Mr.
Sharp! You will henceforth be remembered
in Norfolk as having crept under the ladiesâ aprons in order
to shelter yourself from the eye of the insulted law.

But, even after this, he admitted that the scholars were in
possession of books, for he, himself, examined them, and found
that some of them could read very well. He could not be mistaken
about this, because he allowed them to skip over the hard
words. This was his own language, and I here leave him where
he left himself.

These books were, in many instances, the identical copies
used in my school, and my only object in introducing this testimony
was to show the jury that I had been doing only what was
habitually done in this school, and that if I was guilty of a violation
of the law, I had abundant precedents among the aristocracy
of the city. This having been shown conclusively by the
unwilling witness, Sharp, my case is ended.

[Pg 33]

The Prosecuting Attorney, who treated me with the utmost
respect and deference throughout the whole proceedings, gallantly
waived his right to address the jury first, and I proceeded with
my closing speech as follows:â

â
Gentlemen of the Jury
:

[Pg 34]

âI now deem it right and proper that you should know something
of Mrs. Douglass, who stands before you charged with
violating your laws. I do not plead guilty to this charge, for, in
my opinion, to be a violator of any law or laws, the individual
must know that they are such, which I did not, and had abundant
precedents among those who should have known it, if they
were such, for what I did. I am a Southern woman by birth,
education, and feeling. I have been a slaveholder myself, and
I would be again, if I felt so disposed. I am a native of and
have always resided in a Southern slave State. The house of
my childhood is as dear to me as my life, and I am as deeply interested
in the welfare of Virginia, and of the whole united
Southern slave States, as I am in the State of South Carolina;
yes, and a great deal more so than very many who call themselves
men. I am no abolitionist, neither am I a fanatic, and I
am by education as strongly opposed as you are to the interference
of Northern anti-slavery men with our institutions,
although I believe that their principles are based on a religious
foundation. I deem it the duty of every Southerner, morally
and religiously, to instruct his slaves, that they may know their
duties to their masters, and to their common God. Let the
masters first do their duty to them, for they are still our slaves
and servants, whether bond or free, and can be nothing else in
our community. Let us not quarrel with our neighbors, but
rather look around us and see what we have ourselves to do that
we have left undone so long. I am a strong advocate for the
religious and moral instruction of the whole human family. I
have always instructed my own slaves, and will continue to do
so as long as I remain in a slave State. Still, I am not disposed
to violate the laws of any people or place where I may chance
to reside. I cannot believe for a moment that this prosecution is
a mere matter of dollars and cents, or that there is not one truly
good and noble hearted man among you. Oh no; this I cannot
and will not believe. Then let it be the welfare of your people
and your country that you seek, and I am with you, heart and
soul. This is a matter that calls for the consideration of every
true and noble heartâthe common welfare of our people. So
far as my knowledge of human nature extends, the man who is
born a coward, nursed in the lap of ignorance, and brought up a
coward, naturally dies a coward. The application of this I leave
to yourselves.

[Pg 35]

âThe children whom I had for instruction were members of
Christâs Church Sunday-school. My own little servant was
handed a primer by one of the teachers of that school, with the
instruction that he must study his book, and attend the Sunday-school.
He was made ready by myself or daughter, and sent
every afternoon with his book, to that school. This was done
for two years before I interested myself in these children in the
form of a regular day-school. I believe it is not expected that
ladies will come to the Court House to learn the laws, rules,
and regulations of a city in which they may happen to reside.
In my opinion, whatever the religious portion of the community
is engaged in doing, whether in city, town, or country, is generally
considered as lawful and proper. We took care of those
children, visited them when sick, and ministered to their wants,
and it was a pleasure for us to do so. Was there any thing
wrong in this?

âLet us look into the situation of our colored population in
city of Norfolk, for they are not dumb brutes. If they were,
they would be more carefully considered, and their welfare
better provided for. For instance, two or three of these people
are not allowed to assemble together by themselves, whether in
sickness or in health. There is no provision made for them,
whatever the circumstances may be, and such meetings are pronounced
unlawful and treasonable. Think you, gentlemen, that
there is not misery and distress among these people? Yes,
indeed, misery enough, and frequently starvation. Even those
that are called free are heavily taxed, and their privileges
greatly limited; and when they are sick, or in want, on whom
does the duty devolve to seek them out and administer to their
necessities? Does it fall upon you, gentlemen? Oh no, it is
not expected that gentlemen will take the trouble to seek out a
negro hut for the purpose of alleviating the wretchedness he
may find within it. Why then persecute your benevolent ladies
for doing that which you yourselves have so long neglected?
Shall we treat our slaves with less compassion than we do the
cattle in our fields?

[Pg 36]

âIn my opinion, we have nothing to fear from the true
blooded negro. It is the half-breed, or those with more or less
white blood in their veins, whom I have always found presumptuous,
treacherous and revengeful. And do you blame them for
this? How can you? Ask yourselves the cause. Ask how
that white blood got beneath those tawny skins, and let nature
herself account for the exhibition of these instincts. Blame the
authors of this devilish mischief, but not the innocent victims
of it.

âAs for myself, I shall keep on with my good work; not,
however, by continuing to violate what I now know to be your
laws, but by endeavoring to teach the colored race humility and
a prayerful spirit, how to bear their sufferings as our Saviour
bore his for us all. I will teach them their duty to their superiors,
how to live, and how to die. And now, if ignorance of
your peculiar laws is not a sufficient excuse for my violation of
the letter of them, surely my good intentions, and the abundant
examples set before me by your most worthy and pious citizens,
ought to convince you that I was actuated by no improper motives,
and had no ulterior designs against the peace and dignity of your
Commonwealth. But, if otherwise, there are your laws: enforce
them to the letter. You may send me, if you so decide, to that
cold and gloomy prison. I can be as happy there as I am in my
quiet little home; and, in the pursuit of knowledge, and with
the resources of a well-stored mind, I shall be, gentlemen, a sufficient
companion for myself. Of one consolation you cannot deprive
me: I go not as a convicted felon, for I have violated no
tittle of any one of the laws that are embodied in the Divine
Decalogue; I shall be only a single sufferer under the operation
of one of the most inhuman and unjust laws that ever disgraced
the statute book of a civilized community.â

[Pg 37]

I here closed my remarks, after saying that if any counsellor
present was disposed to speak in my behalf, he should receive
my grateful thanks; but, no one responding, I passed into the
jury-room, to await the result. I was informed that the Prosecuting
Attorney made but a few remarks, not urging a conviction
very strongly, but, of course, as in duty bound, correctly stating
the law, in the case, to the jury. A number of gentlemen present
came to me and tendered their congratulations on my address to
the jury. I had spoken in a loud and distinct voice, duly
emphasizing my words that they might have their full effect.
I had spoken for nearly three-quarters of an hour, and felt somewhat
exhausted, but by no means unnerved.

It was not long before I was informed that the jury were not
likely to agree immediately upon a verdict, and I therefore returned
home. They had some difficulty in coming to a unanimous
verdict, and it was not until the morning of the third day
that they rendered one of Guilty, but fixing the fine at one
dollar, instead of one hundred. This verdict was to have been
expected. There was no denial that the law, as it stood, had
been disobeyed by me, and a verdict of guilty on the charge, as
preferred, was therefore inevitable. The jury had it in their
power to reduce the fine to a mere nominal sum, which they did,
also fully believing that the judge would exercise the same discretion,
and entirely remit the imprisonment attached to the
offence. This was also the universal belief as well as general
desire on the part of the community. I was not sent for on the
rendition of the verdict; and, the court, having to adjourn, my
sentence in form was deferred until the 10th day of January,
1854.

In order that the fidelity of my narrative may be attested by
the evidence of the Virginians themselves, I will here insert an
article that appeared in the Petersburg
Daily Express
, dated
November 30th, 1853, and which was made up chiefly from the
Norfolk
Daily News
. It was headed âHer Own Lawyer,â and
I give it
verbatim
:â

[Pg 38]

âQuite a novel and highly interesting case has recently been
tried before Judge Baker at Norfolk City. A Mrs. Margaret
Douglass, formerly of Charleston, S. C., was arraigned one day
last week, on a charge of teaching negro children to read and
write, contrary to the statute in such cases made and provided,
and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth.

âBy some means or other, as we learn from the âDaily News,â
a report had been previously circulated that the lady had determined
not to employ the services of counsel, but to rely solely
upon her own legal abilities in conducting her defence. This, as
a matter of course, filled the court-room with persons anxious to
witness the novel spectacle, and when she entered the court-room
and took her seat among the lawyers, a most profound
sensation was created.

âThe jury had no sooner been empanneled, than the lady, without
waiting for the examination of witnesses, or the opening
remarks of the Attorney for the Commonwealth, proceeded in a
clear and melodious voice, to the consideration of the charges set
forth in the indictment.

[Pg 39]

âThe surprise of the whole legal fraternity was so great, at this
sudden revolution in the time honored practice of the Courts,
that she had progressed considerably into the merits of the case,
before his Honor recovered himself sufficiently to inform her, that
it would be more regular to suspend her remarks until after the
examination of witnesses was concluded. The lady readily
assented to the proposition of his Honor, and the witnesses for the
Commonwealth were called to the stand. By their testimony, it
appeared that, some months ago, information reached his Honor,
the Mayor, Simon S. Stubbs, Esq., of a school for the education
of blacks, being in successful operation in the city of Norfolk,
under the superintendence of Mrs. Douglass. A warrant was
immediately issued, with directions to the officers to bring all
parties concerned before him, in order that the matter might be
investigated. Upon repairing to the residence of Mrs. Douglass,
the officers found some eighteen or twenty youthful descendents
of Ham engaged in literary pursuits, all of whom, with their
teachers, Mrs. Douglass and her daughter, were taken into
custody, and carried to the Mayorâs office. After a full investigation
of the matter, his Honor decided to dismiss the complaint
in order that a Grand Jury might have an opportunity of giving
it consideration. At the meeting of the Grand Jury a true bill
was found against Mrs. Douglass and her daughter, but the latter
having previously gone to New York, process could not be served
upon her. On the part of the defence, the lady examined several
prominent and respectable gentlemen, members of the Church,
for the purpose of showing that the practice of teaching blacks
had been sanctified by the customs of the members of the different
churches in the city in having Sunday-schools exclusively for
that purpose. It did not appear from the evidence of any of the
gentlemen called upon by Mrs. Douglass, that they had actually
seen negroes taught
from books
in any of the Sunday-schools of
the City, but the fact, as stated by them, that nearly all of the
negroes attending the Sunday-schools
could read
, gave rise to a
violent suspicion that many of the ladies and gentlemen of our
city, moving in the higher circles of society, had been guilty of
as flagrant a violation of the law, as could be imputed to Mrs.
Douglass and her daughter.

[Pg 40]

âAt the conclusion of the evidence, the attorney for the Commonwealth
kindly gave way for Mrs. Douglass to continue her appeal
to the Jury, which was done on the part of that lady, in a manner
that would have reflected credit on Miss Lucy Stone, or any other
member of the âstrong mindedâ sisterhood. She disdained to
deny the charge preferred against her, or to shirk the responsibility
in any way whatever, but gloried in the philanthropic
duties in which she had been engaged. She denied, however,
any knowledge of the existing laws upon the subject, and confidently
expected that the jury would not pronounce her guilty,
for having committed no other offence than that of being betrayed
into errorâif such it wasâby what she had deemed distinguished
precedents. Having concluded her address she retired from the
court, and the case was briefly concluded by the Attorney for the
Commonwealth.

âThe jury, being unable to agree upon a verdict the first day of
the trial, were adjourned over until next morning, when they found
the defendant guilty, and fined her one dollar.

âThe
Beacon
says, the Judge in passing sentence, according to
the statute, will condemn her to imprisonment for not less than
six months.â

[Pg 41]

During the interval that occurred between my conviction and
the sentence of the Court, I obtained permission from the Court
and Sheriff to visit New York, where I remained two weeks, and
then returned with my daughter. This being so contrary to the
expectations and wishes of the authorities and other public men
of Norfolk, who were extremely anxious that I should never
return, in order that, by branding me as a fugitive from justice,
they might escape the disgrace and odium already attached to
their proceedings, and thus get cleverly out of the difficulty;
they were exceedingly incensed, and commenced a series of
persecutions in the shape of personal attacks in some of the
Norfolk papers, particularly the
Courier
and the
Argus
. The
editor of the
Courier
, W. Wallace Davis, was the ringleader in this
movement, and was frequently in the habit of disgracing himself
and his paper, and insulting the better class of the community,
by indulging in such diatribes as no gentleman would ever suffer
himself to be guilty of. It would seem as though the justice of
Heaven had speedily overtaken him with its retributions, for it
is but a few weeks ago that he died suddenly, as it is said from
the effects of some great mental suffering, and it is not ungenerous
to suppose that the stings of conscience, when he reflected
upon his inhuman course towards me, became severer than he
could endure. I leave him with his God.

To show that such were the wishes of the authorities and
others, I quote the following passage from the Norfolk
Argus
,
under date of February 9th, 1854. I quote the whole of the
article here, though portions of it have reference to what occurred
subsequently, as I may have, occasion to refer to the other passages.
It is headed âCommonwealth
vs.
Mrs. Douglass,â and
reads as follows:

[Pg 42]

âWe publish to-day the judgment of
Hon.
Judge Baker in
the case of Mrs. Douglass, which has much excited our citizens.
The first time within the passage of the act forbidding the teaching
of slaves or free colored persons to read or write, has a case
of this description come under the jurisdiction of our Court, and
it was singular that this case should be a woman. The jury
found a verdict of guilty, and the law had to be sustained.
Sympathy was aroused for Mrs. Douglass. It was revolting to
the citizens to have a woman imprisoned in our jail, and every
inducement was offered Mrs. Douglass to escape the punishment.
The Court was obliged to adjourn its judgment over, and although
a
capias
was awarded, yet it was the hope and wish of every one
that she would leave the city. But no; âa martyrâ she âwould
be to the cause of benevolence;â and to cap the climax, she
brought her daughter, a maiden of some seventeen summers, who
had obeyed the injunctions of her mother, as a child should, to
try the stern realities of the laws, and, to use her own language in
defending her cause, âto glory in works of benevolence and
charity to a race down-trodden.â Then sympathy departed, and
in the breast of every one rose a righteous indignation towards a
person who would throw contempt in the face of our laws, and
brave the imprisonment for âthe cause of humanity.â

âThe decision of Judge Baker is cogent and pungent, and will
be read with interest. The laws must be upheld. It is not for
the Judge to set upon the constitutionality or justice of the law;
it is for him a sacred duty to impose the punishment meted out
in the code. Virginia must keep in restraint the wire-workings
of abolition sentiments. We have in this town suffered much
from the aggression of Northern foes, and a strong cordon must
encircle our domestic institutions. We must preserve from discord
and angry passions our firesides and homesteads. We must
preserve inviolate the majesty of laws necessary for the protection
of our rights; and there is no one of intelligence and foresight
who will pronounce the judgment unrighteous.

[Pg 43]

âMrs. Douglassâs time will run out this week, and we have
heard it stated from good authority, that her imprisonment will be
a pecuniary reward to her. We hope that our citizens will prevent
by all possible means any attempt to aid this woman, but
let her depart hence with only one wish, that her presence will
never be intruded upon us again. Let her seek her associates at
the North, and with them commingle, but let us put a check to
such mischievous views as fell from her lips last November, sentiments
unworthy a resident of the State, and in direct rebellion
against our Constitution.â

My readers will perceive two important concessions in this
article; first, that mine was the first case that had ever been
tried under that peculiar act since its passage, and that public
sympathy was strongly excited in my favor: and secondly, that
it was the hope and wish of every one that I should leave the
city, and thus enable them to escape from the dilemma in which
they were placed. Now, I submit to my readers whether it was
not asking a little too much of me, that I should voluntarily
allow myself to be branded as an escaped fugitive, and subject
myself to be advertised as such in every newspaper in the
country, have a price set upon my head, and be hourly liable to
arrest by any officer, who thought it worth the trouble, wherever
I might be. No, I was no coward; and, rather than place myself
in such a position as that, I would have suffered my right hand
to be cut off.

[Pg 44]

It must be said, however, that neither I, nor any one else, ever
supposed for a moment, that I should receive any further punishment
for my offence than the infliction of the nominal fine already
fixed by the verdict of the jury. Justice did not require it, nor
the cause of morality. My character was such that there was
no cause to fear that I should break my pledge, and attempt to
renew my school; and common gallantry alone should have led
any gentleman, much more a dignified Judge, in whose sole discretion
the matter rested, to have dealt with a woman as leniently
as the strict letter of the law would allow. I rested in perfect
security until the 10th day of January, 1854, when I was called
before the Court, and received from Judge Baker, not only an
unnecessarily long and discourteous reprimand, but a sentence to
an imprisonment of one month in the city jail!

So astounded were the whole community at the shameless impudence
of such a sentence, from a Judge whose own family had
been engaged in the very same acts for which I was punished,
that a number of the most respectable members of the Norfolk
bar requested a copy of Judge Bakerâs decision for publication,
which correspondence, with the decision as then published, I
here give entire:â

COMMONWEALTH vs. MARGARET DOUGLASS.

âDECISION.

[Pg 45]

Upon an indictment previously found against you, for assembling
with negroes to instruct them to read or write, and for associating
with them in an unlawful assembly, you were found
guilty, and a mere nominal fine imposed, on the last day of this
Court held in the month of November. At the time the jury
came in and rendered their verdict you were not in Court, and
the Court being about to adjourn for the purpose of attending to
other official duties in a distant part of the State, it was necessary
and proper, under the law, to award a
capias
against you, returnable
to the present adjourned term, so that the judgment and
sentence of the law may be fulfilled. The Court is not called on
to vindicate the policy of the law in question, for so long as it
remains upon the statute book, and unrepealed, public and private
justice and morality require that it should be respected and sustained.
There are persons, I believe, in our community, opposed
to the policy of the law in question. They profess to believe
that universal intellectual culture is necessary to religious instruction
and education, and that such culture is suitable to a
state of slavery; and there can be no misapprehension as to
your opinions on this subject, judging from the indiscreet freedom
with which you spoke of your regard for the colored
race in general. Such opinions in the present state of our
society I regard as manifestly mischievous. It is not true that
our slaves cannot be taught religious and moral duty, without
being able to read the Bible and use the pen. Intellectual and
religious instruction often go hand in hand, but the latter may
well exist without the former; and the truth of this is abundantly
vindicated by the well-known fact that in many parts of
our own Commonwealth, as in other parts of the country in
which among the whites one-fourth or more are entirely without
a knowledge of letters, respect for the law, and for moral and
religious conduct and behaviour, are justly and properly appreciated
and practised.

[Pg 46]

âA valuable report or document recently published in the city
of New York, by the Southern Aid Society, sets forth many
valuable and important truths upon the condition of the Southern
slaves, and the utility of moral and religious instruction,
apart from a knowledge of books. I recommend the careful
perusal of it to all whose opinions concur with your own. It
shows that a system of catechetical instruction, with a clear and
simple exposition of Scripture, has been employed with gratifying
success; that the slave population of the South are peculiarly
susceptible of good religious influences. Their mere residence
among a Christian people has wrought a great and happy
change in their condition: they have been raised from the night
of heathenism to the light of Christianity, and thousands of
them have been brought to a saving knowledge of the Gospel.

âOf the one hundred millions of the negro race, there cannot
be found another so large a body as the three millions of slaves
in the United States, at once so intelligent, so inclined to the
Gospel, and so blessed by the elevating influence of civilization
and Christianity. Occasional instances of cruelty and oppression,
it is true, may sometimes occur, and probably will ever
continue to take place under any system of laws: but this is
not confined to wrongs committed upon the negro; wrongs are
committed and cruelly practised in a like degree by the lawless
white man upon his own color; and while the negroes of our
town and State are known to be surrounded by most of the
substantial comforts of life, and invited both by precept and example
to participate in proper, moral and religious duties, it
argues, it seems to me, a sickly sensibility towards them to say
their persons, and feelings, and interests are not sufficiently respected
by our laws, which, in effect, tend to nullify the act of
our Legislature passed for the security and protection of their
masters.

[Pg 47]

âThe law under which you have been tried and found guilty is
not to be found among the original enactments of our Legislature.
The first legislative provision upon this subject was introduced
in the year 1831, immediately succeeding the bloody
scenes of the memorable Southampton insurrection; and that
law being found not sufficiently penal to check the wrongs complained
of, was re-enacted with additional penalties in the year
1848, which last mentioned act, after several years trial and experience,
has been re-affirmed by adoption, and incorporated into
our present code. After these several and repeated recognitions
of the wisdom and propriety of the said act, it may well be said
that bold and open opposition to it is a matter not to be slightly
regarded, especially as we have reason to believe that every
Southern slave State in our country, as a measure of self-preservation
and protection, has deemed it wise and just to adopt laws
with similar provisions.

[Pg 48]

âThere might have been no occasion for such enactments in
Virginia, or elsewhere, on the subject of negro education, but
as a matter of self-defence against the schemes of Northern incendiaries,
and the outcry against holding our slaves in bondage.
Many now living well remember how, and when, and why the
anti-slavery fury began, and by what means its manifestations
were made public. Our mails were clogged with abolition
pamphlets and inflammatory documents, to be distributed among
our Southern negroes to induce them to cut our throats. Sometimes,
it may be, these libelous documents were distributed by
Northern citizens professing Southern feelings, and at other
times by Southern people professing Northern feelings. These,
however, were not the only means resorted to by the Northern
fanatics to stir up insubordination among our slaves. They
scattered far and near pocket handkerchiefs, and other similar
articles, with frightful engravings, and printed over with anti-slavery
nonsense, with the view to work upon the feeling and
ignorance of our negroes, who otherwise would have remained
comfortable and happy. Under such circumstances there was
but one measure of protection for the South, and that was
adopted.

[Pg 49]

âTeaching the negroes to read and write is made penal by the
laws of our State. The act imposes a fine not exceeding one hundred
dollars, to be ascertained by the jury, and imprisonment
not exceeding six months, to be fixed and ascertained by the
Court. And now, since the jury in your case has in my opinion
properly settled the question of guilt, it devolves on me, under
the law, to ascertain and decide upon the quantum of imprisonment
under the circumstances of your trial and I exceedingly
regret, that in being called on
for the first time
to act under
the law in question, it becomes my duty to impose the required
punishment upon a female, apparently of fair and respectable
standing in the community. The only mitigating circumstance
in your case, if in truth there be any, according to my best reason
and understanding of it, is that to which I have just refered,
namely, you being a female. Under the circumstances of
this case, if you were of a different sex, I should regard the full
punishment of six months imprisonment as eminently just and
proper. Had you taken the advice of your friends and of the
Court, and had employed council to defend you, your case no
doubt, would have been presented in a far more favorable light
both to the Court and to the jury. The opinions you advanced,
and the pertinacity and zeal you manifested in behalf of the
negroes, while they indicated perfect candor and sincerity on
your part, satisfied the Court, and must have satisfied all who
heard you, that the act complained of was the settled and deliberate
purpose of your mind, regardless of consequences, however
dangerous to our peace.

[Pg 50]

âIn conformity with these views, I am impelled by a feeling
of common honesty, to say that this is not a case in which a
mere formal judgment should be announced as the opinion of the
Court. Something more substantial under the circumstances of
this case, I think, is demanded and required. The discretionary
power to imprison for the term of six months or less, in good
sense and sound morality, does not authorise a mere minimum
punishment, such as imprisonment for a day or week, in a case
in which the question of guilt is free from doubt, and there are
many facts and circumstances of aggravation. A judgment of
that sort, therefore, in this case, would doubtless be regarded by
all true advocates of justice and law as mere mockery. It would
be no terror to those who acknowledge no rule of action but
their own evil will and pleasure, but would rather invite to still
bolder incendiary movements. For these reasons, as an example
to all others in like cases disposed to offend, and in vindication
of the policy and justness of our laws, which every individual
should be taught to respect, the judgment of the Court is, in
addition to the proper fine and costs, that you be imprisoned for
the period of one month in the jail of this city.â

It is hardly necessary for me to dwell upon my feelings when
I received this unexpected sentence. They were of course more
interesting to me than to my readers. My narrative of the
history of the case here properly terminates, it being only necessary
for me to state that I was immediately incarcerated, and
spent the month within the walls of a prison, one week of which
was passed in sickness. I received every allowable attention
from the jailor and his amiable wife, and even remained with
them a day or two after my sentence expired.

All social ties that bound me to the people of Virginia were
sundered by this act; I was free from any obligation due to their
laws, and felt that I could be of no farther service to any one,
whether white or colored. I therefore gathered together my little
household goods, and, in the month of February last, removed
with my daughter to the City of Philadelphia, where we are now
quietly residing, happy in the consciousness that it is here no
crime to teach a poor little child, of any color, to read the Word
of God.

[Pg 51]

My readers will naturally expect from me sundry reflections
in connection with my personal narrative. The subject itself
naturally induces them, and I should be untrue to myself if I,
a Southern woman, did not address the Southern people in terms
which the occasion and circumstances justify. My remarks will
be desultory and disconnected, as I am merely to record such
thoughts as have occurred to me not only during the time that
has passed since my conviction, but which had been previously
forced upon me by carefully examining the condition of the
Southern people in all their relations.

Many laws in Virginia, as elsewhere, have become
dead-letters
.
Even in Norfolk itself, as well as generally throughout
the State, the particular law infringed unknowingly by me, had
long been held as such, and was violated daily and hourly by
those who were regarded as leaders in society, in morals and in
religion. But the opportunity was so good a one to make
me
a
victim, a sacrifice in expiation of all past offences and offenders,
that it could not be overlooked. Caught and bound, I was laid
upon the altar of the law, but did not experience the good
fortune of Isaac. There was the fire and the woodâheartless
judge and quibbling lawyers, and I was immolated. Was not
such justice chivalrous? Were not such lawyers magnanimous?

[Pg 52]

Here is presented a somewhat singular state of things to exist
in a State professing to be the most gallant and dignified of the
whole Confederacy. A large number of negroes, amounting in
value to between fifty and one hundred thousand dollars, have,
within a short time, made their escape from Norfolk to a Northern
port. This is a grievously sore evil, and decidedly practical
loss. But what is the plan pursued? Why, after failing to
secure a portion of them, all further efforts to obtain them are
given up, and pure listlessness and indifference take the place
of an active interest in favor of recovering or protecting their
property. A meeting, advertised to call together slave-owners
to suggest some plan of redress, meets with but a meagre and
partial response, and the matter ends by permitting the whole
outrage and grievance to die away among the idlest trifles of
the day.

On the other hand, a
lady
is caught, detected, entrapped,
following in the wake of others, teaching a few free negroes to
spell and read their Sunday lessons, and upon proof thereof, is
put into a felonâs prison, and the ignominy, disgrace, and
infamy even of a base criminal are said to be hers, by the bench
and the press. If Northern vessels bear away the slaves of
Norfolk, the height of revenge and recrimination seem to be
found in venting upon a
Southern ladyâs
head the vindictiveness
of individuals and the violence of the law. If Northern
marshals refuse to perform their duties as slave-catchers under
the Fugitive law, the whole matter, after a little feeling, is allowed
to be forgotten; but, let a Southern lady presume to obey some
of the gentlest and purest instincts of her nature and the teachings
of charity, by instructing a few free black urchins of both
sexes to read their Bibles, and the penalties of the law are
visited upon her head, without any compunctions of conscience,
any attention to the monitions of gallantry, or any regard to
the restraints of a refined delicacy. Alas! for the boasted honor
and honesty of the old Virginia nobility!

[Pg 53]

Here is a view of the case that may not be unworthy of attention:
It is the energy of the white man that has made this
country what it is, and his
alone
that will make it what it is to
be. To the sinew, the nerve, the strong arm, the moral and
physical courage, and the genius of the Anglo-Saxon race, is the
world indebted for the grand spectacle we now present as a great,
happy and prosperous people; and to the same ennobling elements
and excellencies in the composition of the white man will
the vast republican empire, now spreading its arms over the
whole earth, be indebted for its existence and perpetuation.
Holding this view, it cannot be then said that I was educating
negroes as rivals or competitors of my brothers and sisters of a
superior race. Holding to this opinion, with a tenacity that is
as inseparable from my judgment as is color from the Ethiopian,âknowing,
as I do, from all history as well as all cotemporary
observation and record, that the Caucasian race are the âmost
godlike,â and the authors of all in the arts and sciences that contributes
most to manâs more refined tastes, pleasures, and ambition.
I am sure that I could not, South nor North, attempt to change
the âEthiopianâs skinâ in the vain endeavor to make him an
equalâsocially, politically, or even morallyâwith my own race.
No such thing, however, was charged upon me. My offence
consisted in teaching a few poor colored children, free by the
laws of their own State, to read the Bible, the very book on which
the institutions of our land are based. Common charity, then,
would have attributed to me only a feeling of sympathy for a
lower order of society; common charity, as had been the case
before, in Virginia, would have looked with a lenient eye upon
what
the want of all charity
construed into a crime!

[Pg 54]

I feel impelled here to review briefly the decision of Judge
Baker, in my case, and to make such remarks upon it as may
seem pertinent. It will be seen that the letter requesting a copy
of the decision for publication is signed by a number of the most
respectable citizens of Norfolk, and an attempt has been made
to identify them as entertaining the same opinions, and possessing
the same want of sympathy, as the Judge himself. I am
happy, however, to inform my readers that such is not the case.
They, in common with the rest of the sensible portion of the
community, were astounded by the decision, and merely desired
to have on record the exact language and sentiments of this
strange dispenser of justice, in order that they might know henceforth
in what light to regard him. That he insulted the good
sense and generous nature of the community in which he lived
by so cowardly and unmanly a decision, and especially by his
needless and uncalled for tirade addressed to me on passing
sentence, he now well knows. The community have already
placed the proper estimate upon him, and he is writhing under
the double infliction of their contempt, and the stings of his
own conscience. I have already stated the sudden and mysterious
death of
Mr.
Davis, one of my bitterest persecutors, and am
also informed that Judge Baker, since the rendering of his decision
in my case, âhas never been of exactly as equable and
pleasant a frame of mind, but much more morose, snarlish, and
nervous.â Poor man! He certainly has sufficient cause to
be so.

[Pg 55]

The Judge admits in his decision, that there are persons in
that community opposed to the policy of the law in question, and
who believe that universal intellectual culture is necessary to religious
instruction and education, and that such culture is suitable
to a state of slavery. He, however, embraces the opportunity
to state that he regards such opinions as âmanifestly mischievous.â
Hear, oh Earth! A Judge, in the most enlightened
country in the world, and in the nineteenth century, believes
that the intellectual culture of human beings is a crime! He
professes to hold the Bible to be the word of God, and the very
bulwark of our institutionsâfrom it he derives the right to hold
a portion of human beings in bondageâin it he sees the Divine
command to every human soul to âsearch the Scriptures,â and
yet says that a certain portion of the world must not obey this
command, and that it is a crime to teach them to do so! Admirable
logic! Oh, most righteous Judge! His real character may
be better seen revealed in a subsequent sentence, wherein he
argues that there is more respect for the law and for moral and
religious conduct and behavior in those sections of Virginia,
where even among the whites one-fourth or more are entirely
without a knowledge of letters. Why, this manâs avowed principles
would do away with education of any kind for any class
of people! He would see his own State, proud and haughty
Virginia, return to a state of barbarism, and completely shrouded
in a pall of mental darkness! This is the inevitable conclusion
from his own words. Is Norfolk, that little corner of the great
Commonwealth, so far behind the age as to desire a state of
things so earnestly deprecated in other sections of the State?
Or is this sapient Judge alone the entertainer of such sentiments?
Does he not know that the people throughout the
old Commonwealth have become alarmed at their rapid degradation,
and are petitioning their Legislature to devise measures to
stop the downward tendency to utter ignorance? Has he never
seen this short but momentous sentence, originally published in
the Richmond
Whig
of April 3d, 1854, viz:

âEvery decade exhibits a rapid and fearful increase of this
mass of ignorance. In 1840, the number of the unlettered in
Virginia amounted to sixty thousand. In 1850, it exceeded
eighty thousand. At this rate, it will not require many centuries
to extinguish all knowledge of letters in the State.â

[Pg 56]

Here is a fact that every Virginian should ponder well.
There is no doubt as to the data, and less as to the result,
unless something is done at once to stay this doward current.
Let them study the
real cause
of this state of things, and not
attribute it to any but the right one. Is the way to remove the
evil properly commenced by imprisoning a woman for teaching
a few little children to read? Again I say, oh, most righteous
Judge!

But the hardihood of Judge Baker was evinced in his using
the language quoted, when he knew that his most intimate
friends, and even members of his own family had been and were
engaged in doing with impunity what in me was a crime. How
he can reconcile his treatment of me with his conscience, when
he remembers this fact, is best known to himself. Probably his
usual admirable logic will help him out of the dilemma. I am
sure I cannot.

[Pg 57]

The learned Judge grows remarkably religious as he proceeds.
He admits that âthe slave population of the South are peculiarly
susceptible of good religious influences.â He even dares to
say that âtheir mere residence among a Christian people has
wrought a great and happy change in their condition: they have
been raised from the night of Heathenism to the light of Christianity,
and thousands of them have been brought to a saving
knowledge of the Gospel. Of the one hundred millions of the
negro race, there cannot be found another so large a body as the
three millions of slaves in the United States, at once so intelligent,
so inclined to the Gospel, and so blest by the elevating
influences of civilization and Christianity.â Allow me, oh
wonderful judge! to ask you one simple question, which I much
fear even your logic will be puzzled to answer. If such be the
character and condition of the slave population, and the more,
(as by your own showing,) they become acquainted with the
principles of the Gospel, the more they conform to them, how is
it that you regard as a crime, the giving them the instruction
necessary to accomplish this purpose? Which horn of this
dilemma will your Honor choose to be impaled upon? Sorry
am I to be compelled to contradict a professed gentleman, but
your Honor knew that you were telling an untruth when you
uttered that sentence, and you knew also the
cause
of the misery
and degradation among Southern slaves, producing as it does a
state of things which may well lead you to fear to have them
instructed in any thing. I know that cause, also, and I am going
to tell it boldly to my Southern brothers and sisters before I
close my present labor.

You are pleased to term the exercise of the commonest dictates
of humanity in me a âsickly sensibilityâ towards the colored
race. Be it so. But I require the aid of no physician to heal
me, and rather, would to God that my disease were contagious,
and that I could therewith infect the entire South. A little
portion of the
virus
might perhaps not be unavailable even in
your veins. If it be a âsickly sensibilityâ to yearn to impart
to immortal souls, that instruction necessary to guide them
through life and upwards towards heaven, I confess that I am
guilty. This is the head and front of my offendingâno lessâno
more.

[Pg 58]

The decision admits that the enactment under which I suffered
was not to be found in the original code of Virginia, but the
result of the experience and wisdom of the later inhabitants of
that State. Certainly, the framers of the original laws of the
old Commonwealth were men of too much sense and foresight,
too Christian, too civilized, too human, to incorporate such a
disgraceful law into their rules of government. That task was
left to their degenerate sons of the present decade, and even
then it could not be accomplished until eighty thousand of them
had returned into that mental obscurity that characterized the
dark ages. The law, on its very face, indicates that it was not
the offspring of men of intelligence or common prudence. Any
law declaring that any portion of human beings shall be denied
the benefits of education, must spring from ignorance and error,
and must inevitably lead to the same results universally. The
defender of such a law voluntarily classes himself with those
who made it, and those against whom it especially operates.
Such a man is the Honorable Richard H. Baker.

[Pg 59]

The next paragraph of this venerable decision is so strangely
constructed that I hardly know what to say of it. The Judge
literally foams at the mouth and presents sad symptoms of
hydrophobia. The expressions âNorthern incendiaries,â âanti-slavery
fury,â âinflammatory documents,â âcut-throats,â
âNorthern fanatics,â âanti-slavery nonsense,â &c., make up
the entire paragraph. His Honor grows pale over a poor little
inoffensive piece of muslin, with a picture upon it which he
denominates âfrightful.â He succeeds in working himself into
a perfect fury, and about what? With nothing that I can see
with which I, or the question before him, had anything to do.

I
was not a Northern incendiary or fanatic, nor did I distribute
any inflammatory documents or anti-slavery nonsense. I was
a Southern woman, in every sense of the word, and he knew it.
I used no books, except the Bible, or those which illustrated it,
and he knew this also. The only escape for his honor is that
he denounces the Bible as an inflammatory or incendiary document,
and as such must not be taught to the slaves.

[Pg 60]

The Judge next regrets that I am a woman, for the modicum
of gentlemanly honor and dignity which he has left, prevents
him from exercising the full bent of his inclinations, and inflicting
upon me the full penalty of the violated law. It is a pity
he remembered that I was of the weaker sex, and I feel that I
have no thanks to offer him for his proposed lenity, for, under
the circumstances of the case, an imprisonment for six months
would have been no severer than the one for thirty days. He
admits that the jury had the power to regulate the amount of the
fine, but claims that it was his prerogative to name the term of
my imprisonment. The jury, it will be seen, made the fine
merely nominal, thus attesting in the most emphatic manner
their appreciation of the merits of the case. There was not a
man on that jury who was not fully as capable of judging of
right and wrong, as was he who occupied the bench. And yet
he, this one man, had the hardihood to set his judgment over
theirs, and virtually insult the whole twelve, by inflicting a
punishment so severe that it was no charity to me not to have
exercised his power to the fullest extent. He admits that I was
of fair and respectable standing in the community, and knew
from the evidence, as well as from his own knowledge, that I
had abundant precedents for what I had done, and that, knowing
the law, I had no intention of again violating it; also, that the
feeling of the entire community was in my favor, and yet he
wantonly, needlessly, and inhumanly exercised the authority
with which he was clothed, in order to make an example of me,
when I, by my forbearance, had refused to place scores of respectable
ladies and gentlemen of Norfolk, and some of them
members of his own family, in the unpleasant position which I
then occupied. He even twitted me because I had not deemed
it proper to employ counsel to defend me, intimating that my
case would have been presented in a more favorable light to the
Court and jury thereby. This shows the very blackness of his
malice, for the jury did all they could, and I do not entertain
the least feeling of anger towards one of them. They could not
do otherwise than find me guilty of a violation of the law, as it
stood, but they did all in their power to render its penalty nominal,
by imposing upon me the lowest fine it recognized. It was
the Judge himself who insulted the jury by virtually telling
them their judgment was erroneous, and then he turns to me
and says my case might have been more favorably presented if
I had employed counsel!

The conclusion is obvious, that he was actuated, not by a desire
to uphold the law and administer justice, but by some
motive alike discreditable to him as a Judge and a man. With
this conclusion, I leave him to settle with his own conscience. I
have no disposition to call him hard names. He has done me
all the injury he could, and though I may forgive him, I am
satisfied that he never can forgive himself, or escape from the
doom to which he has already been sentenced by every sensible
and right thinking person in the community. Honorable Richard
H. Baker, Judge of the Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk,
I bid you an affectionate farewell.

[Pg 61]

I will here give to my readers a verbatim copy of the law
under which I was prosecuted and convicted. It is copied from
the code of Virginia, passed by the General Assembly of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, in the month of August, 1849, and
will be found on page 747, chapter 198. It reads as follows:â

âSection 31. Every assemblage of negroes for the purpose of
religious worship, when such worship is conducted by a negro,
and every assemblage of negroes for the purpose of instruction
in reading or writing, or in the night-time for any purpose, shall
be an unlawful assembly: any Justice may issue his warrant to
any officer, or other person, requiring him to enter any place
where such assemblage may be, and seize any negro therein;
and he, or any other Justice, may order such negro to be punished
with stripes.

âSec. 32. If a white person assemble with negroes for the purpose
of instructing them to read or write, or if
he
associate with
them in an unlawful assembly,
he
shall be confined in jail not
exceeding six months, and fined not exceeding one hundred
dollars; and any Justice may require
him
to enter into a
recognizance, with sufficient security, to appear before the
Circuit, County, or Corporation Court, where the offence was
committed, at its next term, to answer therefor; and in the
meantime, to keep the peace and be of good behavior.â

[Pg 62]

It will be seen from this, that in the enlightened State of
Virginia, it is a crime for one portion of human beings to worship
their Maker! Comment is unnecessary. Those men, whose
moral sense was so blunted, so destroyed, that they could pass
such a law as that, could not be expected to find much difficulty
in enacting one subjecting to fine and imprisonment any one
who taught negro children their letters. The old law, for which
this is a substitute, was exceedingly explicit in this respect, but
had become a dead letter. The new one is very loose in its
language. It will be seen that the expressions âheâ and âhimâ
are used, allowing the Judge and jury the opportunity of a
strict construction of the law, in case a lady should be concerned.
Since my trial and conviction, I have been advised by
one of the most eminent counsel in Virginia, that the Norfolk
Court exceeded its powers, and violated the law by not construing
the act literally in my case. It is possible that I may yet
hold all the parties concerned responsible for their unlawful
course. At any rate, it utterly demolishes the nice theory of
Judge Baker, that he was bound to sustain the law, and leaves
him without an excuse for his unnecessary severity towards me.

[Pg 63]

I now approach a subject vitally connected with the interests
of the South and the welfare of humanity. In doing so, I have
no rancor or malice to serve, but boldly speak my mind, and
tell my Southern sisters a truth which, however they may have
learned it by sad experience, has probably never been thus presented
to them before.
In this truth is to be found the grand
secret of the opposition to the instruction of the colored race.
It
therefore becomes important in connection with my narrative.
In this truth also lies the grand secret of the discontent and
rebellion among the slaves. Knowing this, it is easy to perceive
why such strenuous efforts are made to keep the colored population
in darkness and ignorance. As it is, nature herself often
rebels against what instinct teaches even the most degraded
negro to be inhuman and devilish, and if to this were added the
light of intelligence afforded by even the commonest instruction,
wo to the darling system of this offspring of the institution of
slavery. This subject demands the attention, not only of the
religious population, but of statesmen and law-makers. It is
the one great evil hanging over the Southern slave States,
destroying domestic happiness and the peace of thousands. It is
summed up in the single wordâ
amalgamation
. This, and this
only, causes the vast extent of ignorance, degradation, and crime
that lies like a black cloud over the whole South. And the
practice is more general than even Southerners are willing to
allow. While even the Northern libertine usually revolts from
the intimate society of those in whose veins courses a drop of
black blood, the Southern
gentleman
takes them to his very
bosom and revels in their fancied charms, until satiety disgusts
him, when he deliberately sells them into lower degradation as
he would a disabled horse.

[Pg 64]

It is impossible to deny that this unnatural custom prevails to
a fearful extent throughout the South. The testimony is of too
positive and personal a character to be overcome. Neither is it to
be found only in the lower order of the white population. It
pervades the entire society. Its followers are to be found among
all ranks, occupations, and professions. The white mothers and
daughters of the South have suffered under it for yearsâhave
seen their dearest affections trampled uponâtheir hopes of domestic
happiness destroyed, and their future lives embittered
even to agony, by those who should be all in all to them as husband,
sons and brothers. I cannot use too strong language in
reference to this subject, for I know that it will meet with a
heartfelt response from every Southern woman. I would deal
delicately with them if I could, but they know the fact, and
their hearts bleed under its knowledge, however they may have
attempted to conceal their discoveries. Southern wives know
that their husbands come to them reeking with pollution from
the arms of their tawny mistresses. Father and son seek the
same sources of excitement, and alike gratify their inhuman propensities,
scarcely blushing when detected, and recklessly defying
every command of God and every tie of morality and human
affection. They have not even the paltry excuse that ordinary
liberties sometimes make, that their love is real, though illicitâthe
whole practice is plainly, unequivocally, shamelessly
beastly
.
Is there any wonder then that people addicted to these habits
are rapidly returning to a state of semi-barbarism?

Is it to be supposed that the ordinary teachings of nature do
not tell the sable sons and daughters of the South that this
custom is inhuman and ungodly? Is not chastity a natural
instinct, even among the worst savage nations of the earth?
Will not the natural impulses rebel against what becomes with
them a matter of force? The female slave, however fair she
may have become, by the various comminglings of her progenitors,
or whatever her mental and moral acquirements, knows
that she is a slave, and as such, powerless beneath the whims or
fancies of her master. If he casts upon her a desiring eye, she
knows that she
must
submit. There is no way of escape, and
her only thought is, that the more gracefully she yields the
stronger and longer hold she may, perchance, retain upon the
brutal appetite of her master. Still, she
feels
her degradation,
and so do others with whom she is connected. She has parents,
brothers and sisters, a lover perhaps, all of whom suffer through
and with her, and in whose hearts spring up roots of bitterness
which are destined to grow into trees whose branches will sooner
or later overshadow the whole land.

[Pg 65]

How important, then, for these Southern sultans, that the
objects of their criminal passions should be kept in utter ignorance
and degradation. They must not read the Bible because
that teaches them of the sin of their masters. They must not
worship God, for the effect thereof would be to imbue them with
a deeper horror of this great wickedness. They must not learn
to read and write, for every mental and moral improvement only
tends to bring out and improve those feelings and emotions that
already repel this gross system of sensuality and licentiousness.
Were the negroes instructed in their duties to themselves and to
each other, their obligations to their masters and their God,
and were these instructions exemplified by the consistent lives
of their masters, with the natural religious tendencies of the
negro race, the South would become the very garden of the
Lord. Instead of becoming discontented and rebellious, the
very reverse would be the case. There would be no fear of
insurrections, for there would be no inducement. But when a
man, black though he be, knows that, at any moment, he is
compelled to hand over his wife, his sister, or his daughter, to
the loathsome embraces of the man whose chains he wears, how
can it be expected that he will submit without the feelings of
hatred and revenge taking possession of his heart?

I have no desire to pursue this subject farther, at present. I
give it, as the
cause
of the discontent and rebellion among the
Southern slaves, and also as the
cause
of the creation of that
disgraceful law, which now stands like a great black blot on the
code of Virginia, and under whose unjust application I have
been made to suffer. The subject is one that will not be suffered
to rest, for I know my Southern sisters well enough to believe
that they will not much longer rest tamely under the influences
of this damning curse. I have told them plainly of the
evil
âthe

remedy
is in their own hands.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

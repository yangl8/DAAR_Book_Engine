Preface.

The
importance of the Lighthouse system which
protects our seamen against the numerous
dangers and difficulties of the British shores
is fully appreciated by every Englishman.
But it may reasonably be doubted whether the general
public have any correct idea of its completeness, of the administrative
principles which regulate its management, or
of the steps by which it has attained its present development.
They know but little, moreover, of the engineering
skill which has been so successfully exercised in the
construction of Lighthouses, or of the scientific knowledge
which has been brought to bear upon the perfection of their
illuminating apparatus. It may safely be said, that for a
large number of readers, the alpha of their information, on
this subject, is the Eddystone, and their omega the Bell
Rock.

If such be the case, it may be presumed that the present
volume will be accepted as an honest attempt to supply an
admitted deficiency. It is based on the best authorities,
and its pages have been revised by competent critics. Its
aim is to furnish in a popular and intelligible form a
description of the Lighthouse
as it is
and
as it was
âof the
rude Roman pharos or old sea-tower, with its flickering
fire of wood or coal, and the modern pharos, shapely and
yet substantial, with its powerful illuminating apparatus
of lamp and lenses, shining ten, or twelve, or twenty miles
across the waves. The gradual improvement of this
apparatus is concisely indicated. Sketches are furnished
of the most remarkable Lighthouses in Great Britain and
France, and a detailed account is given of the mode of life
of their keepers, with full particulars of the administrative
systems adopted at home and abroad. As auxiliaries in
the noble work of guarding the seaman against the perils
of rock and shoal, the Lightship, the Buoy, and the Beacon,
have also found a place in our pages; and the volume
closes with a list of all the Lights existing on the coasts of
England, Scotland, and Ireland at the present time.

In my description of the
French
Lighthouses I have been
much indebted to M. Renardâs book, âLes Phares.â The
information given respecting
British
Lighthouses has been
drawn from a variety of sources, the more important of
which are duly acknowledged. I have also derived many
particulars from personal examination; and some interesting
data and corrections have been supplied by Mr.
Thomas Stevenson, the Engineer to the Board of Northern
Lights, and the worthy member of a family long associated
with lighthouse engineering.

The Illustrations are from photographs, unpublished
sketches, and other authentic originals. Those of the
French Lighthouses are copied, by permission, from M.
Renard.

ANCIENT HISTORY OF LIGHTHOUSES.

CHAPTER I.

THE FIRE-TOWERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN.

We
are apt to look upon the lighthouse as
completely a modern invention, but a little
reflection would convince us that the early
navigators, in their arduous struggle against
the ocean, could not have failed to establish some sure
indications by which to guide their adventurous course.
Undoubtedly, the first rude signal would be no more
than a huge fire blazing on the wave-washed promontory,
or on the summit of hoary hill or grassy mound nearest
to the more dangerous parts of the shore. But it can
easily be conceived that the difficulty of keeping these
[10]

fires kindled on stormy nights would soon suggest to
manâs ingenuity the idea of erecting a suitable structure
for their shelter.

The value of this kind of coast defences was so apparent,
that the ancients felt unable to ascribe them to simple
human invention. And thus the Greeks attributed their
origin to the demigod Hercules. But there seems some
reason to believe that, long before Greece became a maritime
nation, light-towers had been built by the Lybians
and the Cuthites along the coast-line of Lower Egypt.
These towers, we are told,
[1]
served as landmarks during
the day, as beacons during the night. Their purpose was
a holy one, and accordingly they were also used as temples,
and each was dedicated to a divinity. The mariner, who
naturally held them in great veneration, enriched them
with his votive offerings. It has been conjectured by
some authorities that their walls at first were painted with
charts of the Mediterranean coast and of the navigation of
the Nile; these charts being afterwards transferred to
papyrus. The priests of these singular but valuable institutions
taught the sciences of hydrography and pilotage,
and the art of steering a vesselâs course by the aid of the
constellations. On the summit of each tower a fire was
continually burning; the fire being placed in a machine
of iron or bronze, composed of three or four branches,
each representing a dolphin or some other marine animal,
and all bound together by skilful decorative work. The
machine was attached to the extremity of a stout pole,
and so placed that its radiance was directed seaward.

According to the Baron de Zach, in his
[11]
âCorrespondance
Astronomique,â the Lybian appellation for these
towers was
tar
, or
tor
.
[2]
As
is
signifies âfire,â we thus
obtain the compound
Tor-is
, or âfire-tower;â whence the
Greeks derived their
ÏÏá¿¤á¿¥Î¹Ï
, and the Latins their
turris
.
In like manner, the Latin
columna
comes, it is said, from

Col-On
, the âpillar of the sun.â

THE BEACON FIRE.

Some authorities boldly carry this etymological diversion
[12]

a little further. When the fire-towers were situated
upon eminences outside the boundaries of cities, and constructed
of a circular form, they were called
Tith
. The
mythological Tithonus, so celebrated for his longevity,
seems, they assert, to have been one of these edifices dedicated
to the sun; and Thetis, the ancient ocean-goddess,
simply a fire-tower near the sea, called
Thit-is
. Nor have
ingenious theorists been wanting to maintain that the
massacre of the Cyclops, who, according to the old legend,
were stricken by Apolloâs arrows, was nothing but a
poetical version of the manner in which the fires of the
Cyclopean towers, planted on the eastern coasts of Sicily,
were extinguished by the rays of the rising sun.
[3]

The impression which the light-tower produced on the
popular imagination is, however, more beautifully, as well
as more certainly, described by Homer in a well-known
passage of the âIliadâ (bk. xix. 375):â

âAs to seamen oâer the wave is borne

The watch-fireâs light, which, high among the hills,

Some shepherd kindles in his lonely fold.â

In our English Bible the word
beacon
occurs but onceânamely
in the Prophecies of Isaiah (xxx. 17), who
lived about two centuries later than Homer; but in the
Septuagint version, the same word is rendered as a âflagstaffâ
or âperch,â and unquestionably refers to a
land
-signal
rather than to a maritime light.

The first pharos which performed its duties in a regular
manner seems to have been that which Lesches, the author
[13]

of the âLittle Iliadâ (who flourished about the 9th
Olympiad), erected on the promontory of Sigeum, at
the entrance of the Hellespont. It is figured in the
Iliac Table.

Though the most ancient in our records, the honour was
not reserved to it of bequeathing its name to its successors,
any more than to Columbus the glory of leaving
his

name to the New World. This honour was gained by the
mighty tower elevated on the island of Pharos, at Alexandria,
which served as a model for some of the most
celebrated lighthouses erected in later times. Such was
the case with the pharos built by the Emperor Claudian
at Ostia, which appears to have been the most remarkable
of any on the Latin coast. It was situated upon a breakwater,
or artificial island, which occupied the mid space
between the two huge moles that formed the harbour;
[4]

and its ruins were extant as late as the fifteenth century,
when they were visited by Pope Pius II. Not less stately
was the pharos which guided the seamen into the port of
Puteoli, the emporium of the foreign trade of Imperial
Rome; nor that which Augustus erected at the entrance
of his new harbour of Ravenna, and which Pliny describes
with so much enthusiasm; nor that, again, which shed
its warning light from the mole of Messina over the whirlpool
of Charybdis and the rock of Scylla; nor that which
blazed in the island of CapreÃ¦, and was destroyed by an
earthquake shortly before the death of Tiberius.

Dionysius of Byzantium
[5]
describes a celebrated lighthouse
[14]

planted at the mouth of the river Chrysorrhoas,
where the latter mingles its waters with those of the Thracian
Bosphorus (the modern channel of Constantinople).
âOn the crest of the hill,â he says, âwhose base is washed
by the Chrysorrhoas, may be seen the Timean tower, of
an extraordinary height; and from its summit the spectator
beholds a vast expanse of sea. It has been built for
the safety of the navigator, fires being kindled for their
guidance; which was all the more necessary because the
shores of this sea are without ports, and no anchor can
reach its bottom. But the barbarians of the coast lighted
other fires on the loftiest points of the coast, to deceive the
mariner, and profit by his shipwreck. At present,â adds
our author, âthe tower is partly ruined, and no lantern
is lighted in it.â

Strabo refers in exaggerated terms to a superb pharos
of stone at Capio, or Apio, near the harbour of Menestheusâthe
modern Puerto de Santa Maria. It stood on
a rocky headland, nearly surrounded by the sea, and served
as a guide for vessels through the shallow channels at the
mouth of the Guadalquivir.
[6]

What was the form of the Roman light-towers? This
is a question not easily answered, when we remember that
Herodian compares them to the catafalques of the emperors.
The catafalques were square; but it is certain
that quadrangular lighthouses were very seldom constructed.
Montfaucon reproduces a medallion, from the
famous cabinet of the MarÃ©chal dâEstrÃ©es, which represents
a Roman lighthouse as a circular tower, built in four
[15]

stories of decreasing diameter. Another medal, discovered
at Apameia, in Bithynia, and also figured by Montfaucon,
likewise depicts a circular building. This medal bore
the following inscription:ââColonia Augusta Apameia,
Colonia Julia Concordia decreto decurionum.â

A ROMAN PHAROS (FROM A MEDAL IN THE DâESTREESâ COLLECTION).

Murleia, in Bithynia, was founded by a colony from
Colophon, but having been captured by Philip of Macedonia,
he gave it to Prusias, King of Bithynia, who called
it after his wife Apameia. It was situated on the south
coast of the Gulf of Cius, and to the north-west of Prusa.
[16]

The Romans converted it into a
colonia
, apparently about
the time of Julius CÃ¦sar; certainly not later than that of
Augustus.
[7]
And we shall hereafter see that the pharos
at Dover, as at Boulogne, was also of this form.

ROMAN PHAROS (AFTER A MEDAL OF APAMEIA).

[17]

CHAPTER II.

THE PHAROS OF ALEXANDRIA.

One
of the most famous lighthouses of antiquity,
as I have already pointed out, was the pharos
of Alexandria, which ancient writers included
among the Seven Wonders of the World. It
might naturally be supposed that the founder of so remarkable
a monument of architectural skill would be well
known; yet while Strabo and Pliny, Eusebius, Suidas,
and Lucian ascribe its erection to PtolemÃ¦us Philadelphus,
the wisest and most benevolent of the Ptolemean kings of
Egypt, by Tzetzes and Ammianus Marcellinus the honour
is given to Cleopatra; and other authorities even attribute
it to Alexander the Great.

All that can with certainty be affirmed is, that the
architect was named Sostrates. Montfaucon, in his great
work, endeavours to explain how it is that while we are
thus informed as to the
architect
, we are so doubtful as to
the
founder
, whom, for his part, he believes to have been
PtolemÃ¦us. Our ignorance, he says, is owing to the
knavery of Sostrates. He wished to immortalize his
name; a blameless wish, if at the same time he had not
[18]

sought to suppress that of the founder, whose glory it was
to have suggested the erection. For this purpose Sostrates
devised a stratagem which proved successful; deep in the
wall of the tower he cut the following inscription: âSostrates
of Cnidos, son of Dexiphanes, to the gods who
Protect those who are upon the Sea.â But, mistrustful
that King PtolemÃ¦us would scarcely be satisfied with an
inscription in which he was wholly ignored, he covered it
with a light coat of cement, which he knew would not
long endure the action of the atmosphere, and carved
thereon the name of PtolemÃ¦us. After a few years the
cement and the name of the king disappeared, and revealed
the inscription which gave all the glory to Sostrates.

Montfaucon, with genial credulity, adopts this anecdote
as authentic, and adds: Pliny pretends that PtolemÃ¦us,
out of the modesty and greatness of his soul, desired the
architectâs name to be engraved upon the tower, and no
reference to himself to be made. But this statement is
very dubious; it would have passed as incredible in those
times, and even to-day would be regarded as an ill-understood
act of magnanimity. We have never heard of any
prince prohibiting the perpetuation of his name upon
magnificent works designed for the public utility, or being
content that the architect should usurp the entire honour.

To solve the difficulty, Champollion represents the
pharos as constructed by PtolemÃ¦us Soter. But, as Edrisi
solemnly remarks, âGod alone knows what is the truth.â

Much etymological erudition has been expended on the
derivation of the word
Pharos
. As far as the Alexandrian
light-tower is concerned, there can be no doubt that it
was named from the islet on which it stood; yet Isidore
[19]

asserts that the word came from
Ïá½¼Ï
, âlight,â and
á½Ïá¼Î½
,
âto see.â To quote again from Montfaucon: That numerous
persons, who have not read the Greek authors, should
exercise their ingenuity to no avail in the extraction of
these etymologies, is far less surprising than that so good
a scholar as Isaac Vossius should seek the origin of
Pharos

in the Greek language. From
ÏÎ±á¼°Î½ÎµÎ¹Î½
, âto shine,â he says,
comes
ÏÎ±Î½ÎµÏÏÏ
, and from
ÏÎ±Î½ÎµÏÏÏ
,
ÏÎ¬ÏÎ¿Ï
.... But the island
was called
Pharos
seven or eight hundred years before it
possessed either tower or beacon-light.

The most reasonable conjecture seems to be that the
word is a Hellenic form of
Phrah
, the Egyptian name of
the sun, to whom the Alexandrian lighthouse would
naturally be compared by wondering spectators, or dedicated
by a devout prince.

At a later date we find the word applied to very different
objects, though always retaining the signification of
light

or
brilliancy
. A
pharos
of fireâ
i.e.
, a ball or meteorâwas
seen, says Gregory of Tours, to issue from the church
of St. Hilaire, and descend upon King Clovis. The same
historian uses the word to describe a conflagration:ââThey
(the barbarians) set fire to the church of St. Hilaire, kindled
a great pharos, and while the church was burning, pillaged
the monastery.â The old French historian frequently
employs the word in this sense, which leads us to suppose
that in his time an incendiary was probably designated âa
maker of pharosesâ (
un faiseur de phares
). Still later, the
term
pharos
was applied to certain machines in which a
number of lamps or tapers were placed, as in a candelabrum.
A modern French writer quotes from Anastasius the
Librarian, that Pope Sylvester caused
[20]
âa pharos of pure
goldâ to be constructed; and that Pope Adrian I. made
one, âin the form of a cross,â capable of receiving one
hundred and seventy candles or tapers. And Leon of
Ostia, in his âChronicle of Monte Cassino,â says, that the
Abbot Didier had a pharos, or great silver crown, weighing
one hundred pounds, constructed, which was surmounted
by twelve little turrets, and from which were
suspended six and thirty lamps.

We may add that the poets have employed the word
âpharosâ in a still more metaphorical sense, to signify
an object which instructs while it illuminates, or those
remarkable individuals whose genius becomes for all time
the light of the world, and a beacon to posterity. Says
the French poet Ronsard to Charles IX.:â

âSoyez mon phare, et gardez dâabymer,

Ma nef qui nage en si profonde mer.â

My guide, my pharos be, and save from wreck

My boat, which labours in so deep a sea.

But from this digression we return to the Alexandrian
Wonder.

The long narrow island of Pharos lay in front of the
city of Alexandria, sheltering both its harboursâthe
Greater Harbour and the Haven of Happy Return (
Îá½Î½Î¿ÏÏÎ¿Ï
)âfrom
the fury of the north wind and the occasional
high tides of the Mediterranean.

It was a strip of white and dazzling calcareous rock,
about a mile from Alexandria, and 150 stadia from the
Canobic mouth of the river Nile. Its northern coast was
fringed with small islets, which, in the fourth and fifth
centuries, became the resort of Christian anchorites. A
deep bay on the northern side was called the
[21]
âPiratesâ
Haven,â because, in early times, it had been a place of
refuge for the Carian and Samian rovers. An artificial
mound, or causeway, connected the island with the mainland.
From its extent (seven stadia, 4270 English feet,
or three-quarters of a mile), it was called the
Heptastadium
.
In its whole length two breaks occurred, to permit of the
passage of the water, and these breaks were crossed by
drawbridges. At the insular end stood a temple to
HephÃ¦stus, and at the other the great Gate of the Moon.
The famous lighthouse stood on a kind of peninsular
rock at the eastern end of the island; and as it was built
of white stone, and rose to a great height, it was scarcely
a less conspicuous object from the city than from the
neighbouring waters.

Some remarkable discrepancies occur in the accounts of
this noble edifice, which have been handed down to us, but
after all allowance has been made for error and exaggeration,
it remains obvious that the wondering admiration
bestowed upon it by the ancients was not unjustified.
The statements of the distance at which its light could be
seen are, however, most undeniably fictitious. That of
Josephus, who compares it to the second of Herodâs three
towers at Jerusalemâcalled Phasael, in honour of his
brotherâis the least incredible; yet even he asserts that
the fire which burned on its summit was visible thirty-four
English miles at sea! Such a range for a lighthouse on
the low shores of Egypt would require, says Mr. Alan
Stevenson, a tower about 550 feet in height.

Pliny affirms that its erection cost a sum of money equal,
at the present value, to about Â£390,000, and if this were
true, we might not dispute some of the assertions of
[22]

ancient writers in reference to its elevation and solidity.
But the fact that it has entirely disappeared seems to disprove
the dimensions they have assigned to it. We are
wholly unable to decide whether the help it afforded to
mariners was from a common fire or from a more complete
system of illumination. The poet Lucan, in his âPharsalia,â
asserts that it indicated to Julius CÃ¦sar his approach
to Egypt on the seventh night after he sailed from
Troy; and he makes use of the significant expression
âlampada,â which could hardly be applied, even poetically,
to an
open
fire. Pliny expresses a fear lest its light, which,
seen at a distance, had the appearance of flames, should,
from its steadiness, be mistaken for a star (âpericulum in
continuatione ignium, ne sidus existimetur, quoniam Ã¨
longinquo similis flammarum aspectus estâ
[8]
); but assuredly
he would not have spoken in such terms of the
wavering, irregular, and fitful light of an ordinary fire.
We conclude, therefore, that its lighting apparatus was
more complete than has generally been supposed.

When was this great monument destroyed?

The most probable supposition seems to be that it fell
into decay in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and
that its ruin was hastened or completed by the iconoclastic
and barbarian hands of the Turkish conquerors of Egypt.
That it existed in the twelfth century, we know from the
graphic description of Edrisi; a description which will
enable the reader to reproduce it before his âmindâs eyeâ
in all its pristine glory:â

ANCIENT PHAROS OF ALEXANDRIA.

âThis pharos,â he says, âhas not its like in the world
for skill of construction or for solidity; since, to say
[25]

nothing of the fact that it is built of excellent stone of the
kind called
kedan
, the layers of these stones are united by
molten lead, and the joints are so adherent that the whole
is indissoluble, though the waves of the sea from the north
incessantly beat against it. From the ground to the
middle gallery or stage the measurement is exactly seventy
fathoms, and from this gallery to the summit, twenty-six.
[9]

âWe ascend to the summit by a staircase constructed
in the interior, which is as broad as those ordinarily erected
in towers. This staircase terminates at about half-way,
and thence the building becomes much narrower. In the
interior, and under the staircase, some chambers have been
built. Starting from the gallery, the pharos rises to its
summit with a continually increasing contraction, until at
last it may be folded round by a manâs arms. From this
same gallery we recommence our ascent by a flight of steps
of much narrower dimensions than the lower staircase: in
every part it is pierced with windows to give light to persons
making use of it, and to assist them in gaining a
proper footing as they ascend.

âThis edifice,â adds Edrisi, âis singularly remarkable,
as much on account of its height as of its massiveness; it
is of exceeding utility, because its fire burns night and
day for the guidance of navigators: they are well acquainted
with the fire, and steer their course in consequence, for it
is visible at the distance of a dayâs sail (!). During the
night it shines like a star; by day you may distinguish
its smoke.â

[26]

This latter passage shows that if any better mode of
illumination had once been in use, as we are inclined to
believe, it had been discontinued, or its secret forgotten,
by the degenerate successors of the Alexandrian Greeks.

Edrisi remarks, in language resembling Plinyâs, that
from a distance the light of the pharos was so like a star
which had risen upon the horizon, that the mariners, mistaking
it, directed their prows towards the other coast,
and were often wrecked upon the sands of Marmorica.

Montfaucon also records this unfortunate peculiarity,
which, however, is not unknown in our own days. More
than one of the lighthouses intended to warn the seaman
as he approaches a dangerous rock or headland now carries
a couple of lights: one at the summit, and one below;
that the upper may not be mistaken for a star.
[10]

In reference to the Alexandrian pharos, Montfaucon remarks
that the stories related by the Arabs and European
travellers must be very cautiously examined. For instance:
we are told that Sostrates rested its foundations on four
huge crab-fish made of glass (
grands cancres de verre
); a
fable so gross, says one Benedictine, that it is not worth
the trouble of refuting it, though Isaac Vossius declares it
to be recorded in an ancient manuscript which he himself
possessed.

MODERN LIGHTHOUSE OF ALEXANDRIA.

Nor, continues Montfaucon, are we more disposed to
credit the story told by Martinus Crusius, in his
Turco-GrÃ¦ciÃ¦
,
book viii.âon the authority of the Arabsâthat
Alexander the Great fixed on the summit of the tower a
mirror so skilfully made that it revealed the approach of

[29]
hostile fleets at a distance of one hundred leagues, and that
after the Macedonian heroâs death it was broken by a
Greek, named Sodores, while the guardians of the lighthouse
slept. But, unfortunately for this romantic fiction,
the pharos was not built until after the time of Alexander
the Great.

CHAPTER III.

THE âTOUR DâORDREâ OF BOULOGNE.

Boulogne
is the ancient
Bononia
or
Gesoriacum
,
âa naval place,â says PtolemÃ¦us, âof
the Morini,â and distant from the British
coast, according to Pliny, about fifty
millia
passuum
. Pliny probably measured from Boulogne to

RutupiÃ¦
(or Richborough), where the Romans had a fortified
port, and which was their usual landing-place from
Gallia. His measurement, however, exaggerates the
actual distance between these places.

It was from Boulogne the Emperor Claudius embarked
on his expedition to Britain; and it was at Boulogne the
Emperor Caligula bade his soldiers collect the shells as
spoils of ocean, and decreed himself a triumph for victories
he had only won in imagination. As a more durable
monument of his achievements, he erected, according to
Suetonius, a lofty tower; the extraordinary structure
which, under the name of the
Tour dâOrdre
, for centuries
extorted the admiration of men.

Built as a memorial of imperial vain-gloriousness, when
was it first converted into a work of public utility? When
[31]

did the triumphal tower become a lighthouse? To these
questions we can offer no authoritative reply. But it
seems probable that in
A.D.
191 a light was blazing from its
summit; for a bronze medal of Commodusâon which
he is entitled Britannicus, in memory of his lieutenantâs
victories over the Britonsârepresents the pharos and its
fire, and the departure of a Roman fleet.

Planted at the usual point of embarkation for Britain,
the tower of Boulogne was carefully preserved so long as
the Roman sway endured. In 811 it was repaired,
according to Eginhard, by the great Western emperor,
Charles, who was then preparing an expedition against the
Norman pirates. As late as the seventeenth century it
seems to have been employed as a lighthouse; and thence,
according to a popular but certainly erroneous etymology,
its ancient name of
Turris ardens
became, by corruption,

Tour dâOrdre
. It also served as a fortress, for which it
was well adapted by its admirable position and extraordinary
massiveness.

In the sixteenth century, while Boulogne was occupied
by an English garrisonâthat is, from 1554 to 1559âthe

Tour dâOrdre
was enclosed by two ramparts, one of
brick, the other of earth, and both furnished with artillery.
This point was felicitously chosen for the attack or defence
of Boulogne, inasmuch as it dominated over the whole town,
and commanded both banks of the Liane. Yet the Tour
dâOrdre suffered little from the ravages of war, except that
its lantern was several times destroyed; and its ruin is
wholly due to the neglect of successive magistrates of
Boulogne. Shaken at first by the waves, which in high
tides dashed furiously against the cliffâthen by the
[32]

subterranean action of springs and watercoursesâand,
finally, by the imprudent excavation of the adjoining
quarries, both the fort and the tower fell downâtwice,
according to some authoritiesâthrice, according to othersâbetween
1640 and 1645âalong with the portion of the
cliff on which they were erected.

In the interval between these sad events, says Egger,
nothing was attempted in preservation of the remains of
our precious monument, which, however, in its ruined
condition, still served as a night-beacon for ships entering
the port. When at length it perished utterly, the municipality
of Boulogne considered themselves released from
the dues which, for this portion of their territory, they
had paid, in virtue of an ancient right, to the Seigneur de
Bainethun. As the soil no longer existed, the tenants
thought themselves freed from all obligations towards its
proprietor. The latter resorted to legal proceedings, and
judgment was given in his favour, July the 1st, 1656.
Inasmuch as the wise men of Boulogne had by their own
negligence caused the loss which they put forward as an
excuse for denying their debt, they were condemned to
pay, as before, two thousand herrings, fresh and dry, to be
delivered at Arras, Amiens, and other towns, according to
the seigneurâs pleasureâor to restore the ground to its
ancient condition, and abandon to the Seigneur de Bainethun
the toll which they levy from all fishermen entering
the harbour. And there is reason to believe that this
tribute of two thousand herrings was paid by the corporation
of Boulogne down to the epoch of the French Revolution.

[33]

BIRDâS EYE VIEW OF THE TOUR DâORDRE OF BOULOGNE.

(
From an old drawing by Claude ChÃ¢tillon.
)

[35]

There are little, if any, remains now extant of this
ancient monument, more glorious from the services which
for generations it rendered to humanity than from its
origin, which only recalled the extravagance and insane
ostentation of Caligula; and M. Egger advises us to be
cautious how we place our confidence in the representations
which have been given of it. The most trustworthy
seems to be the drawing executed by Claude ChÃ¢tillon,
engineer to Henry IV., which we here reproduce.

The descriptions which are on record, says M. Renard,
are equally unsatisfactory. Still we can pick out of their
rhodomontade some few valuable and accurate particulars
of its situation, dimensions, and form, and of the materials
employed in its construction. These were simply gray
and yellow stones, and red bricks, so arranged as to compose
an edifice of great solidity and yet of attractive appearance.
The tower was situated some two or three
hundred yards from the brink of the cliff; it was octagonal;
192 feet in circumference, and about 64 feet in diameter:
as with most of the Roman pharoses, each of its twelve
stories was a foot and a half narrower than the story immediately
below it, so that it assumed, on the whole, a
pyramidal shape. We are told that its height was about
equal to its circumference, or, in round numbers, 200 feetâwhich
seems, as Egger remarks, an extraordinary elevation
for a lighthouse, already situated on a cliff 100 feet
above the sea-level. According to M. J. F. Henry, its
height was about 124 feet. However this may be, each
story had on the south side an opening like a gate. As late
as the beginning of the seventeenth century there might still
be seen three vaulted chambers, one above the other, connected
[36]

by an inner flight of stairs, and probably intended
for the lodging of the keepers.

As for the place where the fire or light was kindled, we
are entirely left to conjecture; but from the fact that the
chroniclers of the ninth century assert that the summit
was repaired with a view to prepare it for the signal-fires,
there seems reason to believe that before this restoration
they were kindled in a chamber on the uppermost story.

M. Egger puts forward the supposition that carefully
directed excavations might lead to the discovery of important
remains. And looking to the arguments by which
he supports his hypothesis, we are disposed to accept it as
very plausible. It is to be regretted that France possesses no
archÃ¦ological associations to undertake the superintendence
and prosecute the study of her memorials of antiquity.
With all her passion for national aggrandizement, she proves
herself strangely neglectful of her past, and the educated
classes of France exhibit little of that interest in archÃ¦ological
and antiquarian pursuits which is shown by the
scholars and gentry of England. Yet on every ground it
is desirable that a nationâs past should never be divorced
from its present; that the continuity of national life
should, as far as possible, be preserved unbroken; and
much may be done for the furtherance of so desirable an
object by a due regard to the monuments erected by our
forefathers.

The
Commission des Phares
has raised, however, in the
place of the Tour dâOrdre, a worthy substitute. In 1835
it established at Boulogne a red light, fixed, and two other
fixed lights, the first of which shed its radiance for four,
[37]

and the second and third for nine miles; ample illumination
this for a portion of the French coast which is already
lighted, at Cape Grisnez, by a powerful apparatus, whose
lustre extends as far as twenty-two miles, and at Pointe
dâAlpreck, by a lighthouse visible for twelve miles.

[38]

CHAPTER IV.

THE TOWER AT DOVER.

The
summit of the lofty down at Dover, now
crowned by the famous castle, with its Norman
keep and towers, was used as a military post
from a very remote antiquity. There can be
little doubt that the Britons here kept watch and ward:
that it was the site of a Roman stronghold, we know from
indisputable evidence. A circular entrenchment of Roman
work is still extant, and so too are the remains of the
Roman lighthouse, whose steady blaze lighted the imperial
galleys as they hovered about the port, or guided the
British oyster-boats returning from their market at
Boulogne.

With the history of the stronghold, however, we have
nothing to do. It is the pharos which attracts our steps,
and induces us to ascend the steep acclivity. A recent
antiquary is of opinion that there were
two
lights; one on
the eastern, and the other on the western edge of the hill.
The ruins of the latter are so shapeless and indistinct that
no description of them could interest the reader, or enable
him to picture to his âmindâs eyeâ the form and structure
[39]

of the ancient edifice. Of the former enough remains to
assist our imagination very materially.

THE TOWER AT DOVER.

It is still, says Mr. Puckle,
[11]
a massive shell: the inner
face of its walls vertical and squared, the outside with a
tendency to a conical form, which was probably at one
time much more distinct, allowing for the quantities of
external masonry and facing which by degrees must have
fallen or been hewn away. The basement only is of
Roman work; the octagon chamber above having been
[40]

added in the reign of Henry VIII. The dimensions are
about fourteen feet square.

The following description we borrow from Mr. Puckleâs
learned monogram:â

Except fragments here and there, he says, such as might
have been picked up along the shore, the materials used in
the pharos are few and uniform throughout; each having its
own peculiar character, quite distinct from any supposed
similar materials of subsequent date.

â1.
Tufa
: A substance freely used by the Romans
wherever obtainable, and always considered to mark their
work as certainly as if dated and recorded in some historical
document. Quantities of it may still be dug in
parts of the valley of Dover, by the river. It was squared
up, and used in tolerably regular courses of blocks; those
inside showing a fair and even facing, hard, and little
friable either by age or weather.

â2.
The concrete, or mortar
: This is of two kinds,
found at two levels of the lower mass of the tower. A
small portion has been laid in a pale, tawny-coloured
mortar, mixed in the proportion of four parts of sharp
grit to one of lime. The greater part, however, has been
carried up with the pink or salmon-coloured mortar,
peculiar to Roman work, and mixed in the proportion of
one part of lime to four of more or less finely-pounded
Roman brick. It is nothing like so hard as the concrete
found (for instance) lining the Roman baths discovered
under the west end of the nave of St. Maryâs parish-church;
but it is too peculiar a material not to be recognized
wherever it appears, identifying its Roman make.

[41]

â3.
The red tile-brick
: This, again, is always esteemed
a very distinctive element in materials of Roman building;
but it requires some attention to distinguish justly between
the genuine Roman production and subsequent imitations
of the same thing. Without digressing into the habits
of a Roman brick-yard, it may suffice just to refer to what
is described in well-known ancient authorities, as the careful
process observed in the making of Roman tile-brick.
A very pure and smooth clay was selected, and so treated as
to expel as much as possible all gritty and non-homogeneous
ingredients. Reduced to something like the fineness and
consistency of dough, it underwent a treatment not very
different from that of the dough itself; being laboriously
wrought and tempered by hand or otherwise, like bread
being kneaded in its trough; it was then shaped off in
flat blocks of the various sizes employed. The sizes vary
considerably as found in different places; but those commonly
seen along the Kentish coast in bonding-courses, or
the construction of arches, are something over a foot
square, by about two inches in thickness. They are generally
more or less deeply scored on the under face, either
in a rude pattern, or simply with straight or wavy lines,
making their hold on hard mortar very tenacious; though
these are not unfailing marks of Roman brick.â

Such are the materials of which the Roman pharos was
constructed; materials identical with those which compose
the Tour dâOrdre at Boulogne. When it was first disused
as a lighthouse, it is impossible, to say; but as its
elevation must have constantly enveloped it in mists, and
rendered its fires useless, we should opine that it was not
employed after the Conquest. In course of time it was
devoted to military purposes, its lower chamber being converted
[42]

into a guard-room; and of late years it has been
appropriated as a government store-house. Lights are
now established on the piers of Dover Harbour, and with
those of the South Foreland on the English coast, and of
Cape Grisnez and Boulogne on the French coast, amply
suffice for the due illumination of the Straits.

It is much to be desired that every care should be
taken for the preservation from further injury of so interesting
a relic of Roman times as the pharos at Dover.

[43]

CHAPTER V.

THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES.

âMen
receive with indifference from one another,
and without examination, the traditions of
past events, even of events connected with
the history of their own country. Thus, for
the most part, in their indolence to search out the truth,
they accept at once all the fables and exaggerations forced
upon their notice.â

It is thus that Thucydides expresses himself; and though
his observation is two thousand years old, it has lost
nothing of its point or truth.

A striking example of its applicability is afforded by the
striking illustration now before us;âa representation of the
Colossus of Rhodes, according to the generally received
idea that this celebrated statue of Apollo was planted at
the entrance to the harbour of Rhodes, where it served as
a pharos; and that it was of such surpassing magnitude
that ships under full sail could pass between its gigantic
limbs.

But there is no evidence that the Colossus ever served as
a pharos; at least, no ancient author asserts that such was
[44]

its employment. The first writer who converted it into a
beacon-light was Urbain Chevreau, an industrious but not
particularly able compiler of the seventeenth century; but
he neglects to say from what source he obtained his information.

In the second place, the attitude traditionally ascribed
to the Rhodian Colossusâan attitude neither graceful nor
dignifiedâis also a pure conceit of comparatively modern
times. It is, however, more ancient than the former, since
it dates from the sixteenth century, when Blaise de
VigenÃ¨re, the translator of Philostratus, transformed the
masterpiece of Chares, the pupil of Lysippus, into a fantastic
impossibility. Where he, too, obtained his information,
no one can ascertain; for on this important point
he preserved the prudent silence of Chevreau.

In an interesting paper, published by the French

AcadÃ©mie des Inscriptions
, the Comte de Caylus provesâ1st,
That the Rhodian Apollo was not constructed at the
mouth of the harbour; and 2nd, That no ships ever
passed between its legs. He did not satisfy everybody,
however, and reference was made to the pages of the
geographer Strabo. It was found that he made no mention
of the remarkable circumstance narrated by VigenÃ¨re.
He cites a fragment of an epigram in iambic metre, in
which the name of the sculptor, Chares of Lindos, is mentioned,
and the dimensions of his workânamely, seventy
cubitsâare given. Strabo adds that the Colossus, in his
time, lay prostrate on the groundâoverthrown by an
earthquake, and with shattered knees; and that the
Rhodians had not restored it to its position because forbidden
by an oracle.

[45]

IMAGINARY RESTORATION OF THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES.

[47]

Turning to Pliny, we find that he confirms all the
statements of Strabo, and fixes the date of the fall of the
statue at fifty-six years after its erection. Though overthrown,
he says, it is still a marvel. Few men can embrace
its thumb; its fingers are larger than those of
statues. Its disfigured limbs appear so many vast
caverns; and in the interior the enormous stones are seen
with which they had been weighted. It cost, says Pliny,
300 talents; being exactly the sum of money which the
Rhodians plundered from the war-ships abandoned before
their city by Demetrius, when he raised the siege,
after protracting it for many months.

Philo of Byzantium, a mechanician who lived about the
end of the third century
B.C.
, and to whom is attributed a
brief treatise on the âSeven Wonders of the World,â describes
at some length the Rhodian Colossus, but makes
no allusion to its supposed straddling attitude, or to its
employment as a pharos. The same silence is preserved
by another historian of the Seven Wonders, Lucius
Ampellius. But as he possessed, like Chevreau and
VigenÃ¨re, an inventive faculty, this author says: âAt
Rhodes is the colossal statue of the Sun, placed on a
marble column, with a chariot drawn by four horses.â

Putting aside the embellishments of tradition, let us
inquire what this monument really was:â

The brazen statue of Helios, popularly called the
Colossus, was seventy cubits in height; its gigantic size
may be inferred from the fact that few could compass one
of its thumbs with their arms.
[12]
Fifty-six years after its
erection it was overthrown by an earthquake (
circa

B.C.
[48]

224), and as already related, the Rhodians would not
attempt its restoration, though PtolemÃ¦us offered them a
contribution of 3000 talents, because prohibited by an
oracle. And yet later authorities describe it as standing
erect; and the Emperor Commodus, among his other extravagances,
ordered his bust to be set upon its summit.

In 672 Rhodes was captured by the Saracens, and their
leader, one of the lieutenants of Othman, sold the brass
of which the famous statue was composed, to a Jewish
merchant of Edessa, for a sum, it is said, of Â£36,000. The
bargain must have been very profitable, if it be true that
the materials thus acquired loaded a thousand camels.

A few words may be added in reference to the sculptor
of the Colossus. According to Pliny, he was a pupil of
Lysippus, a native of Lindos, and named Chares. Such,
too, is the evidence of Strabo and the anonymous author of
the Greek epigram. But in the writings of the Pyrrhonist,
Sextus Empiricus, we find the honour of the achievement
ascribed to one Laches. According to Sextus, Chares,
discovering that he was cheated of half the sum of money
promised for the completion of the statue, killed himself
in despair; and Laches, succeeding him, perfected the
glorious work. The authority of Pliny and Strabo, however,
seems to us preferable to that of Sextus: the Colossus
was truly the work of Chares, alone and unaided, and to
him belongs the glory of having, as Philo of Byzantium
says,
[49]
âMade a god like to a god, and endowed the world
with a second sun.â

BOOK II.

THE SCIENCE OF LIGHTHOUSES.

CHAPTER I.

HOW THEY ARE ADMINISTERED.

From
antiquity we return to our own time, with
the view of examining the present condition
of our coast-defences, so far as they include
the lighthouse, the lightship, the beacon,
and the buoy.

To England belongs the praise, among modern nations,
of having first understood all the importance of lighthouses,
and of having made their erection, mode of illumination,
and maintenance, a matter of national concern.

The direction of the Imperial lighthouses is confided
to three Boardsâone for each of the three kingdoms:â

1st, The
Corporation of the Trinity House of Deptford
Strand
, who possess the control of all the English lighthouses;â

2nd, The
Corporation of the Commissioners of Northern

[50]

Lights
, to whom is intrusted the management of the lighthouses
of Scotland; and,â

3rd, The
Corporation for Preserving and Improving the
Port of Dublin
, who administer the coast-illumination of
Ireland.

The history of the
Trinity House
is but imperfectly
known, owing to the destruction of a considerable portion
of its archives by fire in 1714. It was founded by a
charter of Henry VIII.âwho may almost be called the
Father of English Navigationâon the 20th of March
1512, and received the appellation of the âBrotherhood
of the Trinity House of Deptford of Strand and St.
Clement,â This document opens with a curious declaration:ââOut
of the sincere and complete love and devotion
which we have for the very glorious and indivisible
Trinity, and also for Saint Clement the Confessor, His
Majesty grants and gives license for the establishment of
a corporation, or perpetual brotherhood, to certain of his
subjects and their associates, men or women.â

At the outset, the duty of the members of the guild
seems simply to have been to pray for the souls of sailors
drowned at sea, and for the lives of those who were
battling against the tempest. After a while their functions
increased in number, and, assuredly, in importance.
The charters which they received from Elizabeth, James I.,
Charles II., and James II., placed in their hands the
general control of the mercantile marine, and even, under
certain conditions, of the royal fleet. The illumination of
dangerous parts of the English coast necessarily became a
portion of their mission of patriotic beneficence. But the
[51]

reader must not suppose that no lighthouses burned along
our shores until the Trinity House was established. Rude
signal-lights and beacon-fires already blazed on rocky
headlands, and at the mouths of the ports most frequented
by our shipping; but a greater number of lighthouses
became necessary, and on a more perfect system of organization,
as English commerce in the seventeenth century
assumed its extraordinary development.

But this was not all. The constructors of private lights
and beacons were not animated by a pure unadulterated
zeal for the public welfare; they levied excessive tolls on
the vessels which profited by their guiding rays. To
erect and maintain a lighthouse constituted an industry
of so profitable a character that the privileges in virtue of
which they existed, and which were nearly all found in
the hands of the Trinity House, excited a very widespread
feeling of jealousy and discontent. The legislation
which had taken place on this subject was rigorously
examined, and as a result these privileges disappeared.
This important discovery was made in the reign of James I.
The king found himself specially interested in making it;
for, by its return to the crown, the monopoly of licensing
the erection of lighthouses would have largely increased
his private income.

The pretensions put forward by James I. greatly embarrassed
the judges charged with the examination of the
rights of the Trinity House; and the inquiry might have
lasted for years had it not been abruptly concluded, after
our English fashion, by a compromise. It was decided
that the fraternity of the Trinity House should be
[52]

authorized to erect lighthouses, but that the crown
should enjoy the same privilege in virtue of the common
law. From this decision it naturally came to pass that,
instead of remaining, as Elizabeth had designed, the
exclusive property of the Trinity House, the lease and
monopoly of the fires lighted on the coasts were granted
or sold by the sovereign to certain private individuals.

As a result of this decision, says M. Esquiros, in his
lively manner, there was not a bare and desolate angle of
rock in the kingdom which was not coveted by speculators
as a site for a tower and a beacon-fire. Lord Grenville,
an able statesman and shrewd man of the world,
wrote in his diary in the form of a note or memorandum:
â
Mem.
To watch the moment when the King is in a
good temper, to ask of him a lighthouse.â It would be
difficult to estimate the amount realized by those persons
whom the king favoured with such marks of his goodwill;
but from the luxurious state they maintained it is
evident their profits must have been immense.

We may readily conjecture the evil results of such a
system. Many of the lights were deficient in power;
others were never kindled; yet in every case heavy tolls
were exacted from passing vessels. At length the scandal
grew intolerable, and in the reign of William IV. Parliament
interfered to establish a certain uniformity in the
administration of lighthouses, and to provide for a considerable
reduction of the dues. All the interests of the
Crown were made over to the Trinity House, which,
moreover, was empowered to buy up the lighthouses
belonging to private individuals; and the Corporation
[53]

having always acted with singular zeal, efficiency, and
public spirit, the system of our coast-defences has gradually
attained to a remarkable degree of completeness.

A word or two may now be said on the interior organization
of the Trinity House. It includes two bodies of
associates: the
Elder
, and the
Younger Brothers
. At
first no such distinction existed; but the pretext put forward
to justify the exclusion of the Younger Brethren
from sharing in the conduct of the Society was, that they
showed too much fervour at its meetings. The Younger
Brethren, now-a-days, are chosen by the Council on the
motion of one of the Elder Brethren. Their number was
formerly unlimited. It cannot be too large, say the
ancient charters, because our seamen represent the strength
of the nation. At the present time there are 360.

The Elder Brethren, 31 in number, are chosen from
the Younger. No one can offer himself as a candidate if
he has not first undergone an examination, and served for
at least four years as captain on board a Queenâs ship or a
merchant-vessel. On his election he pays Â£30 as a contribution
to the poor-box, and an equal sum for a complimentary
dinner.

The Elder Brethren, however, are divided into honorary
and active members. From a very early period, the
Company recognized the advantage of including in its
ranks the most illustrious living Englishmen, even
though they should in no wise be concerned with navigation.
In 1673, the Bishop of Rochester, having preached
before the Corporation on Trinity Thursday, was admitted
a member. For seventeen years William Pitt occupied
[54]

the honourable position of Master, which was afterwards
filled by William IV., when Duke of Clarence. Wellington,
Prince Albert, and Lord Palmerston, formerly
belonged to the Corporation; and, at present, the Prince
of Wales, the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, and Earl
Russell, are among its members, while the Duke of
Edinburgh officiates as Master. These honorary members,
limited to eleven, do not engage in the administrative
duties of the Trinity House; but they add to its dignity,
and serve to connect it with the highest classes of English
society. In fact, it would be difficult to name an
association which is more truly national in character.

The twenty active members, on whom the real burden
of the work of the Corporation rests, are experienced
captains of men-of-war or merchant-ships, who have
retired from service. They are formed into six committees,
each of which has its separate functions; for, in
addition to its superintendence of the lighting of our
coasts, the Trinity Board examines our pilots, and
delivers them their certificates; watches over the ballasting
of ships in the Thames; establishes and keeps in
order the various sea-marks; examines the scholars of
Christâs Hospital, who are intended for a maritime career;
collects the revenues; and superintends the boarders in
the houses of refuge which belong to the Corporation.
Its charters, moreover, confer upon it the right of punishing
seamen for mutiny, ill conduct, or desertion; but this
power is now-a-days never exercised.

The story of our two other Corporations may be briefly
told. The
Commission of Northern Lights
, incorporated
[55]

in 1786, by an Act of George III., is composed of two
magistrates appointed by the Crown, of the sheriffs of the
sea-board counties, of the provosts of certain royal burghs,
and of the provost of Greenock.

The
Board of Ballast of Dublin
, which has under its
charge the lightage of the Irish coast, consists of merchants,
bankers, magistrates, railway directors; and the
only seaman associated with them is a coast-guard officer.
It is subordinate to the Board of Trade.

The Trinity House, Northern Lights, and Ballast Board
are under the control of the Board of Trade. Before new
lighthouses are erected by the Trinity House, they must
be sanctioned by the Board of Trade; and before Scotch
or Irish lighthouses are erected, the Trinity House are
consulted, and in the event of that Board differing with
the Irish or Scotch, the Board of Trade give their decision,
which is final. It is to be regretted that there should
still exist a considerable number of lighthouses which are
under the control of about one hundred and seventy local
authorities;
[13]
and every person who appreciates the importance
of securing a vigorous and able administration
will join us in expressing a hope that before long the
lightage of the United Kingdom may form the subject of
efficacious legislative action.

The number and nature of the lights of the United
Kingdom are as follows:â

[56]

In England: lighthouses, lights on piers, harbour lights,
&c., 237. Add 49 lightshipsâtotal, 286.

In Scotland: lighthouses, lights on piers, harbour lights,
&c., 134. Add 1 lightshipâtotal, 135.

In Ireland: lighthouses, lights on piers, harbour lights,
&c., 85. Add 8 lightshipsâtotal, 93.

The general result for the United Kingdom is, that we
have 456 lighthouses, harbour lights, local lights, &c.,
and 58 lightships. Total, 514.

We may compare these figures with those of the French
lights.

Coast-line of England
measures 2405 nautical miles.

Coast-line of Scotland
measures 4467 nautical miles.

Coast-line of Ireland
measures 2518 nautical miles.

Coast-line of France
measures 2763 nautical miles.

Now France has 224 lighthouses, but no floating lights.
The proportion of lights to the coast-line is,
[14]
therefore, as
follows:â

In England
1 to every 8Â½ miles (nearly).

In Scotland
1 to every 33 miles.

In Ireland
1 to every 27 miles.

In France
1 to every 12.3 miles.

We may here explain the French system of administration,
which, however, cannot be said to equal our own in
efficiency or comprehensiveness, nor to surpass it in
[57]

economy. At all events, the foregoing figures show that
the English coast is far more numerously lighted than the
French.

The French system dates from the beginning of the
present century, and is administered by the Department
of
Ponts et ChaussÃ©es
, composed of naval officers, hydrographic
engineers, members of the French Institute, and
other persons acquainted with the sciences which bear
upon navigation. The general direction of the service is
committed to the Inspector-General of Ponts et ChaussÃ©es,
who has under his orders a certain number of engineers,
in each maritime district, charged with the supervision,
construction, and administration of lighthouses. This
board or directorate has its own manufactories in Paris,
where experiments are tried with lighting apparatus, and
where the artisan receives all the information necessary to
guide him in the construction of every part of the apparatus,
such as the calculation of angles, prisms, curves,
lenses, and the like. One of the best results of this
centralization is the economy it insures; the entire cost
of the French service not exceeding Â£40,000 per annum.
It may be added, that to France, as to the United States,
belongs the praise of having looked upon the lightage of
her coasts, not as a source of public or private revenue,
but as a work of humanity. We trust that England,
before any long period has elapsed, will abolish the tolls
now levied upon shipping for the maintenance of her
lighthouses. We admit that they have been considerably
reduced; but they still remain a burden upon
commerce, and a burden which commerce ought not to
bear.

[58]

TRINITY HOUSE.

Let us now pay a visit to the
Trinity House
, in London,
taking as our guide the shrewd and lively author of âThe
English at Home.â

Opposite the Tower of London, he says, or, more strictly
speaking, opposite the ancient fosses of that fortress, now
converted into an agreeable promenade, extends a fine
open area of green turf, edged round with shrubs; and, in
the rear of this square, rises an edifice which seems purposedly
to isolate itself from the noise of the multitudeâit
is the Trinity House.

The abode of this important maritime Society was formerly
situated in Water Lane, whence it was driven out by
two successive conflagrations; otherwise, could any better
choice be made than the immediate neighbourhood of the
Thames, of the great docks, and of the forest of masts
[59]

which crowds it for many miles, like the parks or plantations
of great trees which surround at a distance the
manorial mansions of the English aristocracy?

The principal features of the edifice, erected in 1793 by
James Wyatt, are, a massive basement, surmounted by a
single story enriched with Doric columns and pilasters,
the whole built of Portland stone. On the faÃ§ade, numerous
genii, which, with round faces and puffed-out cheeks,
might be taken for so many cupids, hold in their hands
anchors, compasses, and marine charts. These emblems,
however, sufficiently indicate the character of the institution.

The ground-floor in the interior is occupied by offices;
the upper contains some noble apartments, to which
admission can only be procured by special favour. A
noble vestibule leads to a double staircase of stone, whose
two branches, after ascending in different directions, unite
in a central landing-place, enriched with ornaments and
sculptures. On the right, in a semicircle described by the
wall, is framed a large oil painting, by Gainsboroughâs
nephew, representing a body of
past
âElder Brethren,â
grouped together, and in uniform. On the left, in panels of
glass, are inscribed the names of various benefactors of the
establishment, and the amount of their bequests. Massive
doors of mahogany introduce the visitor into the Board
Room, whose ceiling, painted in 1796, by a French artist
named Rigaud, and loaded with sprawling allegories,
exhibits the Prosperity of England as springing from
Navigation and Commerce. The British Neptune advances
in triumph, surrounded by sea-horses, and attended
by Tritons. In one hand he carries a trident, in the
[60]

other the shield of the United Kingdom. His march is
protected by cannons and other instruments of war, while
genii hovering round him wave the standard of Great
Britain. The standard may pass muster; but cannons!
Is not this an abuse of anachronism even for a picture?
On the other side, Britannia, seated on a rock, receives in
her bosom the products of different countries. Sea
nymphs, bending under their weight of riches, hasten
from every quarter, and seamen spread upon the shores of
England the fruits of an extended commerce. Children
wave to and fro their torches in representation of the
lights which encircle the coasts of the British Isles, and
during the darkness of night direct the movements of her
ships.

The walls of this saloon are decorated with portraits
of George IV., William IV., and their queens, for royalty
itself is no stranger to the annals of the Trinity House,
and monarchs honour themselves by figuring among the
insignia of the fraternity of which they have been the
members and the patrons. The Duke of Wellingtonâs
portrait, by Lucas, is considered the best in existence of
the Conqueror of Waterloo. The busts of the Queen and
the late Prince Consort, in white marble, by Nobleâone
of the few living sculptors who have attained to celebrity in
Englandârest solemnly at the two corners of the mantelpiece.
Twenty arm-chairs ranged round a large table
shaped like a crescent, and covered with a green cloth,
mark the places of the members of the Council at their
various meetings. The associates of the Trinity House
think, with Ben Jonson, that good repasts encourage
brotherly feeling. The dining-room, lighted by a kind
[61]

of circular lantern which surmounts the ceiling, displays
what may very justly be called a quiet and substantial
luxury. Here we may remark the bust of William Pitt,
by Chantrey; portraits of the Earl of Sandwich, the
Duke of Bedford, Sir Francis Drake, and, especially, that
of Sir Kenelm Digby, by Vandyke. At regular intervals,
some excellent models of lighthouses in relief, preserved
under glass, remind the visitor of the all-important object
of this ancient Corporation.

The French Lighthouses Commission is not so splendidly
lodged as the Trinity Board, nor is its Museum equal to
the one at Edinburgh.
[15]
But, side by side with models of
modern lighthouses, are models of the most ancient, from
the ungainly tower whose summit was lit up with a rude
fire of sea-coal, to the elegant edifice of the HÃ©aux de
BrÃ©hat. It also contains numerous examples of all the
catoptric or dioptric apparatus which are, or have been, in
use, as well as specimens of clocks, buoys, and beacons.
The Lighthouse Museum is, finally, the central depÃ´t where
experiments are conducted in reference to all the elements
of maritime lightage, under the supreme direction of M.
Emile Allard, the engineer-in-chief.

[62]

CHAPTER II.

GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF LIGHTHOUSES.

In
reference to the military protection of our
coasts, the civilian is frequently warned of the
necessity of maintaining more than one âline
of defence;â a similar necessity exists as regards
their complete and satisfactory lightage. We know,
too, that at one point a battery is erected; at another, a
simple earthwork is pronounced sufficient; at a third, the
eye ranges over an intricate combination of forts. The
same variety exists in the disposition of those coast-defences
which are designed in the interests of secure and
peaceful navigation. Follow, with the mindâs eye, the long
coast-line of our country, and how many differences we
shall note in the situation of its lighthouses, in their
mode of construction, their elevation, their system of
illumination. Each pharos has, as it were, a speech of
its own; each addresses, in significant language, the seaman
who turns to it for advice or warning. This points
out the entrance to a commodious haven, where, after
being much tossed by unquiet waves, the weary mariner
may repose in safety; that indicates the site of a perilous
[63]

rock or sand-bank, on which a storm-driven vessel must
assuredly perish. Here we see a noble tower, whose
genial rays are visible at a distance of twenty-seven
nautical miles; there burns a steady light, whose extent
of illumination is restricted to five miles. One is a fixed
light, glowing constantly like a brilliant star; another,
more mysterious, suddenly flashes forth from the deep
darkness, flings over the sea its arrow of flame, and then
is again extinguished, to reappear, a few moments later,
in the same strange and impressive manner. Nor are all
lights of an uniform colour. Some are red, with an
intense ruby-like splendour; others white; others, again,
are blue or green. This variety in the range and aspect
of the âbeacon-firesâ has, like the variety in the size and
position of our forts and batteries, a special object.

The system of lightage generally adopted, says M.
Renard, consists in surrounding the coast with
three
lines
of defence; the outmost being composed of lighthouses
with a very extensive range. It has justly been deemed
of the highest importance to signal to the mariner the
proximity of the land, since it is in the waters near the
coast that navigation is exposed to the greatest dangers.
The littoral presents a number of capes, promontories, and
headlands, more or less projecting beyond the general level,
as well as islets, and reefs, and shallows, which require to
be carefully avoided. Now, lighthouses of the first class,
as we may call them, or âsea-lights,â are usually planted
on these promontories or rocks; and along the British shore
they are so arranged that it is impossible, except in a
dense fog, to arrive in its neighbourhood without catching
sight of one or more of them.

[64]

THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE ROCKY HEADLAND.

When he has overpassed the first line of defence, the
navigator encounters a second circleââsecondary-lightsââcomposed
of lighthouses of the second and third orders,
indicating secondary capes, reefs, and sand-banks, to which
it is prudent to give a good offing. When the mouth of
a river or the entrance of a port is only accessible by
narrow channels, whose direction an experienced and
veteran pilot can hardly determine by night, other lights
of the same class are placed in the line of the channel, and
point out the exact course which should be taken.

Finally, when the ship has arrived near the port
which is the goal of her voyage, she perceives lightsââharbour-lightsââupon
[65]

its piers or breakwaters, which
guide her to her much-wished-for berth.

When the best positions for illumination have been
selected, the most difficult task is, or rather was, to provide
for their easy distinction, so that the sailor may not
be misled by too close a resemblance of one to another.
Suitable variations and modifications have been, fortunately,
supplied by the valuable labours of Fresnel, and of the
engineers who have followed in his track.

At first, however, the embarrassment was considerable.
Thus, the code laid down by the celebrated French Commission
in 1825, admitted of only three characters for
lighthouses of the first order: the âfixed light,â the
ârevolving minute light,â and the ârevolving half-minute
light.â But it was soon discovered that merchant seamen
did not sufficiently heed the differences observed between
the intervals of the appearance and disappearance of the
latter lights; and the number of lighthouses, moreover,
having multiplied beyond all prevision, it became absolutely
indispensable to allow of a greater number of
distinctive characters.

Now-a-days we recognize five: the âfixed light,â the
âflashing light,â the ârevolving,â the âintermittent,â and
the âdouble lights in one tower.â

The âflashing lightâ is that which shows alternately
two flashes and two eclipses, or more, in the interval of a
minute.

The âflashing light,â the âintermittent,â and the
âdouble lights in one towerâ were all first proposed and
introduced into Scotland by the late Mr. R. Stevenson.

[66]

The lustre of the ârevolving lightâ gradually increases
to a maximum, and diminishes to a minimum, until wholly
eclipsed, at equal intervals of half a minute, one, two, or
three minutes, and sometimes thrice in a minute.

We designate it an âintermittent lightâ when the ray
suddenly appears, remains visible for a moment, and afterwards
is again suddenly eclipsed for a brief interval.

With this scientific arrangement before us, it seems
strange to recollect that even so lately as the year 1816,
the Isle of May light, in the Firth of Forth, consisted of
nothing better than a coal-fire. Nor had England made
any greater progress in the art of illumination, for the
magnificent tower of the Eddystone, says Mr. Stevenson,
about fifty years after it came from the hands of Smeaton,
could boast of no better light than that derived from a few
miserable tallow candles. Nay, so lately as the year 1801,
the light at Harwich, in addition to the coal-fires, had a

flat plate
of rough brass on the landward side, to serve as
a reflector! Such methods, continues Mr. Stevenson, were
most imperfect, not only in point of efficiency and power,
but also as respects the distinction of one light from
another; an object which, on a difficult and rugged coast,
may be considered as of almost equal importance with the
distance at which the lights can be seen.
[16]

It must also be remembered that too great a multiplicity
of lights would not be less dangerous than a deficiency in
number. Were the littoral too abundantly illuminated,
the effect produced on the navigator would be that of a
continuous and confused line of fire. He would be dazzled
[67]

by the blaze, and unable to determine the particular point
to which he should steer his vessel. Before the Royal
Commission of 1861, one witness actually gave it as his
opinion that there were too many lights on the English
coast, and that the consequence was an increase of collisions,
a neglect of the lead, and continual shipwrecks.
He added, however, that without the increase of light,
steamers could not run in and out of ports at night. The
extent of illumination being necessary, the only method of
reducing the danger of confusion to a minimum is that
adopted by our engineersâa clear and distinct variety of
lights.

[68]

CHAPTER III.

THE ILLUMINATING APPARATUS OF LIGHTHOUSES.

It
has very justly been said that the object of
placing in a lighthouse an illuminating apparatus
is, that, whether it be constructed of
glass or of metal, it may
bend the rays
(which
would otherwise and naturally proceed in straight lines),
and illuminate a hollow sphere, so that those rays which
would otherwise be thrown upon the sky, and thereby
wasted, may be made to fall on points at sea, where they
will be clearly visible. If the light is to be a fixed one,
intended to be seen all round, and from the horizon to the
base of the light-tower, the upper rays issuing from an
illuminating apparatus must be directed downwards, and the
lower rays upwards, so as to increase the illumination. If it is
desired to light up a narrow belt of the sea, extending from
the horizon to the base of the lighthouse, all the rays must
be bent laterally; or they may all be concentrated and thrown
upon one or more spots of larger or smaller size, according
as the light may be neededâas in the case of fixed lights
placed at the end of narrow channels, and of revolving
lights which are made visible all round by causing the
[69]

lenses and reflectors to revolve about the source of light,
or with that source about a centre.
[17]

Two methods have been employed for the purpose of
throwing light in the desired direction: first, by silvered
parabolic reflectors, which is called the
Catoptric System
;
second, by the employment of lenses of a peculiar construction,
which is known as the
Dioptric
(or
Refracting
)

System
.

Occasionally these two systems are combined, as in the
ordinary
Catadioptric
, and in Mr. Stevensonâs admirable

Holophotal
arrangement, whether Catoptric or Dioptric.

Before describing them, however, it will be desirable to
offer a brief history of lighthouse illumination.

It was at a comparatively recent epoch that wood and
coal fires were for the first time replaced by candles, and
the open summit of the tower covered in with glass.
About the end of the eighteenth century, for these insufficient
producers of light, lamps were substituted, whose
lustre was directed to a distance by reflectors of polished
metal. Many of the lighthouses of this epoch were provided
with the species of apparatus here described; among
others, those of Capes de lâAilly and de la HÃ¨ve, the isles
RhÃ© and OlÃ©ron. In 1782, an identical mode of lightage
was established at Cordouan; but though this lighthouse
did not include less than twenty-four lamps, accompanied
each by a reflector, it diffused so feeble a light, that the
seamen immediately insisted on a return to the barbarous
system of the Middle Ages.

The apparatus of which they complained was, in truth,
exceedingly defective; its lamps, differing but little from
[70]

those which the seven foolish virgins suffered to die out,
had broad wicks, and if they produced but little light, by
way of compensation they emitted an enormous amount of
smoke. It was natural, therefore, that men of science
should, with a view to improvement, first direct their
attention to the
lamp
. The pioneer in this course of
inquiry was Argand, who, about 1748, contrived to secure
âa double current of air;â which consists, as any one may
see in the first lamp he meets with, of a wick, shaped like
a hollow cylinder, enclosed in a glass tube. The heat
caused by the combustion of the oil produces a vigorous
draught, which leads to an abundant circulation of air
both internally and externally; and air is for the lamp, as
for man, the plant, and the animalâlife!

Various modifications and improvements of Argandâs
system have been successively introduced. The glass
tube, for instance, by one inventor, was contracted at a
short distance above the burner, so as to project more
immediately the current of air upon the flame, and stimulate
combustion. In his turn, Carcel bethought himself
of supplying the wick with a superabundant quantity of
oil, so as to avoid the heating of the burner, and to render
the flame more regular; he thus succeeded in keeping the
lamps burning for a longer period without a replenishment
of the wick.

There then remained the
reflectors
. Curved in the form
of a spherical segment, these received but a small portion
of the luminous rays, and rarely returned them in the
proper direction. TeulÃ¨re, the engineer-in-chief of the
province of Bordeaux, who was to distinguish himself at a
later period by the erection of the Cordouan Tower, was
[71]

ordered to make an examination of both the lamps and
the reflectors, and to study the best means of remedying
the evils complained of. His studies resulted in a paper
of great interest, published in 1783. To concentrate in a
single direction a large portion of the rays which were lost
on all sides, he proposed the use of mirrors of perfect polish
and a better form. By causing these mirrors to revolve
around a lampâthat is, by projecting successively towards
every point of the horizon the lustre formed by a large
portion of the rays thus collected into a single sheafâhe
invented at the same time the eclipse.

It was not at Cordouan, nevertheless, that the system
was first applied, but at Dieppe, where the celebrated
Borda, having studied TeulÃ¨reâs paper, had a small revolving
apparatus of five parabolic reflectors made
[18]
in 1784.
The apparatus of Cordouan, likewise established by Borda,
was not placed in the lighthouse tower until after its
restoration by TeulÃ¨reâthat is, in 1790.

This method of lightage was obviously a great improvement,
and all the maritime powers hastened to adopt it.
As the
Catoptric System
, it was, until within the last few
[72]

years, exclusively employed on the coast of England.
Though less esteemed in France, its use has not been entirely
abandoned; and the French still employ catoptric
apparatus for âthe illumination of narrow channels, or
for harbour-lights; to strengthen in a given direction a
light whose range is sufficient for the maritime horizon
generally; to illuminate lightships; and for service as
provisional appliances.â

CATOTROPIC APPARATUS.

In the accompanying
design we represent
a plan and elevation
of a catoptric
apparatus, which is
composed, as will be
seen, of nine reflectors
arranged in groups
of threes. A small
rotatory machine sets
the system in motion,
and eclipses at greater
or shorter intervals
are obtained by the
varying speed with
which it is worked.
The range of the apparatus
depends partly
on its power, and
partly on its position.

The reflectors, as
used in the best lighthouses, are made, says Mr. Stevenson,
[73]
[19]

of sheet copper, plated in the proportion of six ounces of
silver to sixteen ounces of copper. They are moulded to
a paraboloidal form by a delicate and laborious process of
beating with mallets and hammers of various forms and
materials, and are frequently tested during the operation
by the application of a mould carefully formed. After
being brought to the curve, they are stiffened round the
edge by means of a strong bizzle, and a strap of brass
which is attached to it for the purpose of preventing any
accidental alteration of the figure of the reflector. Polishing
powders are then applied, and the instrument receives
its latest finish.

To prove the form of the reflector, two gauges of brass
are employed. One is for the back, and used by the
workmen during the process of hammering; the otherâwhile
the mirror undergoes its final touchesâis applied
to the concave face. The mirror is then tested by trying
a burner in the focus, and measuring the intensity
of the light at various points of the reflected conical
beam.

The flame generally used in reflectors is derived from
an Argand lamp, with wicks an inch in diameter. The
burners are sometimes tipped with silver to prevent the
wick from being wasted by the great heat which is
evolved. They are also fitted, in many of the Scottish
lighthouses, with a sliding apparatus of accurate shape,
by which they can be removed from the interior of the
mirror at cleaning time, returned exactly to the same
place, and locked by means of a key.

Catoptric lights, we may add, are divided into
nine
[74]

separate classes, differing in some respect from those
recognized by the French authorities. The nine classes
are called
fixed
,
revolving white
,
revolving
red and white
,
revolving red
with two whites
,
revolving white with
two reds
,
flashing
,
intermittent
,
double
fixed lights
, and
double revolving
white lights
.

AN ARGAND FOUNTAIN
LAMP.

The following account of the distinctive
character of each class of
light is condensed from a valuable
treatise by Mr. Alan Stevenson:â

The
fixed
exhibits a regular and
steady appearance, and is not subject
to any change; and the reflectors
employed are smaller than those
required for revolving lights. This
is necessary, in order that they may
be ranged round the circular frame, with their axes so
inclined as to admit of their illuminating every point of
the horizon.

The
revolving light
is produced by the revolution of a
three or four sided frame, having large reflectors grouped
on each side, with their axes parallel; and as the revolution
exhibits once a minute, or once in two minutes, a
light gradually increasing to the maximum, and then just
as gradually decreasing to total darkness, its effect is
remarkably impressive.

The
revolving red and white
is obtained by the revolution
of a frame whose different sides present red and
white lights, and exhibit the following succession:âtwo
[75]

white lights after one red, or two red lights after one
white.

The
flashing light
is effected in the same manner as
the revolving; but,
owing to a different
construction of the
frame, the reflectors
on each of the eight
sides are arranged with
their rims or faces in
one vertical plane, and
their axes in a line
inclined to the perpendicularâa
disposition
of the mirrors which,
together with the
greater quickness of
the revolution, showing
a flash once in five
seconds of time, produces
an impressive
effect, wholly different
from that of a revolving
light, and presenting
the appearance of an
alternating rising and
sinking illumination.
The brightest and darkest periods being but momentary,
this light is also characterized by a rapid succession of
bright flashes; whence its name.

REVOLVING APPARATUS ON THE
CATOPTRIC PRINCIPLE.

The
intermittent light
is distinguished by bursting suddenly
[76]

into view and continuing steady for a short time,
after which it is suddenly eclipsed for half a minute.
This is due to the perpendicular motion of circular shades
in front of the reflectors, by which the light is alternately
revealed and hidden.

The
double lights
(âwhich are seldom used except
where exists a necessity for a
leading
line, as a guide for
taking some channel or avoiding some dangerâ) are
generally exhibited from two towers, one of which is
higher than the other. At the Calf of Man, says
Mr. Stevenson,
[20]
a striking variety has been introduced
into the character of leading lights, by substituting for
two
fixed
lights, two lights which revolve in the same
periods, and exhibit their flashes at the same instant; and
these lights are, of course, susceptible of the other variety
enumerated above, that of the revolving red and white
lights, or flashing lights, coming into view at equal intervals
of time. The utility of all these distinctions is to be
estimated with reference to their property of at once
striking the eye of an observer, and being instantaneously
obvious to strangers.

The introduction of
colour
as a source of distinction, is
the only means of obtaining a sufficient number of
varieties. Yet, in itself, it is an evil of no small magnitude.
The effect being produced by interposing coloured
media between the burner and the eye of the observer,
much light is lost by the absorption of those rays which
are retained in order to produce the desired appearance.
Experiments have been made with almost every colour;
but only red, blue, and green have proved useful, and the
[77]

two latter merely at such short distances as to unfit them
for âsea-lights.â Owing to the depth of tint required to
produce a marked effect, the red shades generally absorb
about from six-sevenths to five-sevenths of the whole
light; a loss so immense as certainly to discourage their
adoption whenever it can possibly be avoided. The red
glass used in France absorbs only four-sevenths of the
light; but then, as might be expected, its colour produces
a much less signal distinction to the seamanâs eye. In
some of the British lighthouses, the lights are very simply
and conveniently coloured, by the use of chimneys of red
glass, instead of placing large discs in front of the
reflectors.

We come now to the
Dioptric
[21]

System of Lights
.

The application of lenses to lighthouses seems to have
been proposed in England, and essayed at the South
Foreland, as far back as 1752; but owing to mechanical
imperfection, they were found to give a light inferior to
that of the paraboloidal reflectors, and consequently were
abandoned. Buffon, the great naturalist, suggested that
a lens might be constructed in concentric zones out of a
solid piece of glass; but the difficulties of the process have
proved too great to be overcome. In, or about 1773,
Condorcet proposed that burning lenses should be built
up in separate pieces; and a similar method was
described by Sir David Brewster in 1811. The same
construction was quite independently discovered by the
ingenious Fresnel in 1819; and soon afterwards he constructed
[78]

a lens, placed a powerful lamp in its focus,
and rendered it available for the practical purposes
of a lighthouse. He is
therefore the author, if
not the inventor, of the
highly successful system of
illumination which bears
his name.

But before entering
into a minuter description
of the work, let us
learn a few particulars of
the man.

ANNULAR BUILT LENS.

Jean Augustin Fresnel
was born at Broglie, near
Bernay, in the French
department of the Eure,
on the 10th of May 1788.
When eight years old
the future savant was still
ignorant of his letters; a fact, says one of his biographers,
to be attributed not so much to his delicate constitution
as to a deep-rooted dislike for the study of languages,
and, in general, for all exercises dependent upon the
memory. But, on the other hand, at nine years of
age, he was already distinguished by the experimental
researches he had made in the domain of physics; which
induced his parents to send him to the Polytechnic
School. Here, rising step by step with remarkable
rapidity, he eventually became Engineer of Ports et
ChaussÃ¨es.

[79]

In 1819 he carried off the prize proposed by the
Academy of Sciences on the difficult question of the
diffraction of light. His investigations had long been
directed to optical subjects, and hence, when the French
Government established the Lighthouse Commission,
Arago, who was nominated president, immediately appointed
Fresnel to the important post of secretary.

Fresnel recognized the peculiar advantages of a plano-convex
lens to refract in lines nearly parallel to their axis
all the rays emanating from their foci. Like Condorcet
and Brewster, who, as we have seen, had also turned their
attention to the problem, though only for so far as concerned
burning instruments, he asked himself whether, by arranging
the lenses in stages, it was not possible to correct their
spherical aberrationâa defect which becomes all the more
signal as the size of the lenses is enlargedâand, consequently,
to obtain full command over the rays of a lamp.

Let us now transport ourselves to the upper story of a
lighthouse, and putting aside the motive mechanism of
the apparatus, let us penetrate into the lantern. Cast your
glance upon the interior of that immense diamond which we
call a
dioptric apparatus
. The first object which strikes our
attention is the lamp. As the fire which shone on the summit
of the edifice was the soul of the pharos, so the lamp
is the soul of the modern lighthouse. It was to this
lamp TeulÃ¨re first directed his attention, when he brought
the catoptric system to perfection; and it was to this
lamp that Arago and Fresnel addressed themselves when
engaged, in their time, in improving the work of TeulÃ¨re,
Argand, and Borda. Only, every lighthouse does not
[80]

employ the same kind of lamp. In one, we meet with the
Carcel lamp, where the oil is elevated to the wick by a
clock-work mechanism. In another, it is the Moderator,
in which the same function is discharged by a heavy
weight surrounding a roller. In others, whose range is
limited, it is the Permanent-level lamp, where the reservoir
of oil is placed by the side and on the level of the
burner, which possesses the power of regulating the
supply.

Let us draw near, however, and carefully examine the
lamp now before us, because in several details it differs
from those we have described. It will specially interest
us as an English invention.

At the epoch when TeulÃ¨re and Argand had made the
progress already specified in the construction of a suitable
lamp, Rumford, desirous of effecting a still greater improvement,
asked himself whether, by adapting it to
burners with several concentric wicks, it would not be
possible to increase its power of illumination. The
attempt was made, but did not prove successful; he
experienced considerable difficulty in regulating the
flame of these multiple wicks, and in preventing their
carbonization under the action of the intense heat developed
by their combination. It was the study of this
question which led Fresnel and Arago to their beautiful
experiments on the illumination of lighthouses.

After repeated essays, these two men of science decided
on the type of the lamp which we are now contemplating;
an instrument remarkable not only for the whiteness and
intensity of its light, but also for what I may call its
power of endurance; it will burn for upwards of twelve
[81]

hours without requiring to be touched. And that this advantage
is most important the reader will apprehend,
when he remembers that the lighthouse-flame must be
kept kindled throughout the longest nights of winter.

At the present day, lighthouses of the third class are
illuminated by lamps with two concentric wicks; which, in
a certain sense, means two lamps in one. In lighthouses
of the second class, each lamp has three; and in those of
the first class, each has four wicks. In the latter we
obtain, with a single illuminating apparatus, the full
power of twenty-three Carcel lamps. The luminous focus,
though gifted with so much potency, presents, nevertheless,
but a flame of moderate breadth, and its light is as
white as it is brilliant.

The oil employed in the lighthouses of Great Britain,
Ireland, and France is the colza, which has of late years
entirely superseded spermaceti oil, as producing an equal
quantity of light at little more than half the expense.
The electric light has, however, been proposed as a more
powerful method of illumination. One system, in which
the light is produced between carbon points by the revolution
of magnets fixed on wheels, worked by a steam-engine,
was tried with much success by Professor Holmes at the
South Foreland; and is still, we believe, in use at Dungeness,
as it is, in France, at the two lighthouses of
La HÃ¨ve. In the latter case, the mechanism producing
the currents is composed of two steam-engines, each with
a five-horse power, and of four electro-magnetic machines
of six discs, composed each of sixteen bobbins. It is
placed in a boat, adapted for the purpose, at an equal
[82]

distance from the two towers. Under ordinary atmospheric
conditions, a
single steam-engine
is kept in motion,
communicating with
a magneto-electric
machine for each
lighthouse. During
fogs and mists, both
engines are in activity,
and each lighthouse
receives the
currents of two magneto-electric
batteries,
which are then associated.

ELECTRIC APPARATUS FOR A FIXED LIGHT.

Both lighthouses
are supplied with
two lenticular apparatus,
placed one above
another in the same
lantern. The regulators
of the progress of
the carbons were invented by M. Serrin, whose object has
been to augment their sensibility, and, consequently, the
regularity of the light; in which respect, now-a-days, little
is left to be desired. The mean intensity of the light produced
by a machine of six discs is computed as equal to
200 Carcel burners. The intensity of the cone of light
emanating from the lenticular apparatus, when illuminated
in this manner, rises to 5000 burners.

[83]

The electric light, as yet, is applied only to lighthouses
with fixed lights, for a special arrangement would
be necessary in the lenticular apparatus before it could be
employed with the same advantage in the production
of intermittent lights (
feux Ã  Ã©clipses
). Experiments,
however, have been made in this direction, which promise
good results. Yet, in the present state of its mechanical
conditions, the system of electric illumination does
not seem susceptible of any very great development
upon our shores. It cannot be applied economically
to lights which require no very great intensity,âand
these lights are the most numerous; and, on the other
hand, the intricate constructions which it necessitates, the
chances of accident which it presents, and the quantity of
coal which it consumes, are obstacles to its employment
in lighthouses isolated at sea, whose communications
with the mainland are liable to interruption, and where
it is of importance to reduce as much as possible the
dimensions of the edifice as well as the amount of transport.
However this may be, the electric light would
seem destined to render valuable services to navigation at
every point where it can be employed, and like the two
great inventions which the history of marine lightage
signalizesâthat of paraboloidal reflectors, and next, that
of the lenticular apparatusâit constitutes a special and
noteworthy progress, under the threefold aspect of intensity
of light, diversity of character, and the value of
luminous unity.

We may add that Mr. Wilde, of Manchester, has
invented a powerful electro-magnetic apparatus for lighthouse
illumination, which may probably prove valuable.
[84]

Modifications of the lime light, resulting from the action
of an oxy-hydrogen flame upon a surface of prepared lime,
have also been suggested; and the least powerful of these
surpasses in brilliancy the best oil-lamp, as that surpasses
the open coal-fire. We may, therefore, expect that as the
latter barbarous mode of illumination gave way to the
catoptric, or
reflecting
system, so will the dioptric, before
many years have passed, succumb to some ingenious
apparatus capable of utilizing either the lime or the
electric light.

We now return to Fresnelâs system, the
dioptric
,
which is pretty generally adopted in the British lighthouses.

We must here premise that the system is based upon
the laws of the refraction of light.

But, says the non-scientific reader, what do you mean
by the
refraction
of light? I know very well what
reflection is; I am not so clear as to refraction.

A ray of light, when transmitted
obliquely
from one
transparent body to another of different density, undergoes,
at the point where it strikes the common surface of the
two planes, a sudden change of direction. This change
of direction is called
refraction
. For instance, plunge
one half of a straight ruler into a basin of water. The
ruler no longer appears straight, but
bent back
or
broken

(
re
, and
>fractum
) at the point where it enters the water.

We have already stated that the great object to be
gained in lighthouse illumination is this very
refraction
;
that is, the rays of the lamp must be refracted, or bent
back, so as to strike and illuminate the sea.

[85]

Fresnel saw that this object might be secured by the
employment of lenses to intercept, as it were, and refract
the rays proceeding from the lamp. What kind of lens
possessed the greatest power of refraction? He preferred
the plano-convex lenses, which, instead of having two curve
surfaces, have one surface a curve, and the other a plane.
And the lens thus adopted he built up in separate pieces,
for the still greater economization and intensity of light;
and, says Mr. Stevenson, he has subdivided with so much
judgment the whole surface of the lens into a centre lens
and concentric annular bands, and has so carefully determined
the elements of curvature for each, that it seems
unlikely any improvement will soon be effected in their
construction.

ANNULAR LENS OF FIRST ORDER.

The central disc of the lens, marked B in the accompanying
diagramâas employed in lights of the first orderâis
about 11 inches in diameter, and the focus distance
equals 920 millimÃ¨tres, or 36.22 inches. The annular
rings surrounding it gradually decrease in breadth as they
recede from the centre, from 2Â¾ to 1Â¼ inches. The lens,
we should add, is made of crown glass.

[86]

A lens of this magnitude costs about Â£60. Its weight
is about 109 lbs., and its surface consists of about 1300
square inches; but though composed of so many parts, it
is held together simply by two narrow strips of polished
glass, united by a thin film of cement.

The following illustration, representing a segment of
the profile of a dioptric apparatus, will give the reader a
sufficient idea of the manner in which the rays proceeding
from the focus of a lamp are refracted on issuing from the
lens; it also shows the central disc, and the rings placed
above and below it.

When the drum is circular instead of being polygonal,
the lenses are cylindrical and not annular; the luminous
rays are uniformly distributed in the horizontal plane, and
actâin a meridian sectionâin the same manner as those
of the annular lenses.

Yet there is something more than lenses in a dioptric
apparatus, for this reason, that the lamp does something
more than illuminate the frame. The rays streaming below
it vainly poured their light at the foot of the
tower, and those which rose above it were diffused in the
upper region of the atmosphere, and consequently, for all
purposes of marine illumination, would have been useless,
had not Fresnel conceived the idea of collecting, concentrating,
and despatching them in the same direction as
the lenses threw the others. This he effected by means
of the cylindrical rings of glass which, above and beneath
the lenses, cover over the framework, as it were, or make
use of it as a base, in expanding themselves as they approach
the centre of the apparatus.

[87]

DIAGRAM, ILLUSTRATING THE PROGRESS
OF A LUMINOUS RAY IN A CATADIOPTRIC
RING.

The subjoined illustration represents the progress of a
luminous ray in one of the
rings of glass, technically
termed
catadioptric rings
.
Issuing from the focus F at
the summit of the angle
formed by the lines G and
I, it is refracted at A in the
direction A B, undergoes a
complete reflection on the
surface M N, takes the
direction B C, and finally
emerges from the ring in
the horizontal line C H.

At this solution of the difficulty
Fresnel did not arrive all at once, owing to the
absolute want of workmen suitable for carrying out the
novel industry which his genius had created. But by
degrees these were trained and perfected; and the inventor
had, moreover, the good fortune of discovering in an able
and ingenious optician, M. Soleil, an efficient assistant in
the construction on a large scale of the novel instrument
he required. Afterwards the erection of lighthouses becoming
an important branch of industry, he completed several
edifices, which prospered all the more that strangers immediately
gave up any attempt at rivalry, and left to him
the work of supplying every maritime nation with lenticular
apparatus.

Having said thus much of the central lens and its concentric
rings of glass, a few words become necessary in
[88]

reference to the lamp which feeds them, as it were, with
light. Fresnelâs lamp may be shortly described as containing
four concentric burners, which are defended from
the excessive heat produced by their own combined flames
by a superabundant supply of oil. This oil is pumped up
from a cistern below by means of a clockwork movement,
and overflows the wicks incessantly. To supply fresh
currents of air to each wick with a rapidity sufficient to
support the combustion, a very tall chimney-tube is found
requisite. And yet the wicks do not carbonize with the
extreme speed that might be supposed. It is even found,
we are told, that after they have suffered a good deal, the
flame does not perceptibly decrease, because the intense
heat evolved from its mass encourages the rising of the
oil in the cotton. Mr. Stevenson informs us that he has
seen the large lamp in the Tour de Corduan burn for
seven hours, and yet the wicks were neither snuffed nor
raised. In the Scotch lighthouses a full flame is often
maintained, with Colza oil, for no less a period than
seventeen hours, and yet the lamp is untouched.

The only risk in using the Fresnel lamp, says Mr.
Stevenson, arises from the liability to occasional derangement
of the leathern valves that force up the oil by
means of clockwork. Several lights on the French coast,
and, more especially, the Tour de Corduan, have been
extinguished by the failure of the lamp for a few minutes;
an accident which has never happened, and scarcely
can

happen, with the fountain lamps of the Catoptric
system. To prevent such dangerous mishaps, which,
under some circumstances, might entail the loss of a
[89]
âtall
ship,â various precautions have been adopted. The most
efficacious seems to be this: an alarum is attached to the
lamp, consisting of a small cup pierced in the bottom,
which receives a portion of the oil overflowing from the
wicks, and is capable, when full, of balancing a weight
placed at the opposite end of a lever. The moment the
machinery stops, the cup ceases to receive the supply of
oil, and the remainder escaping at the bottom, the equilibrium
of the lever is destroyed; it falls, and disengages
a spring, which rings a bell with sufficient force to arouse
a sleeping keeper. But, says Mr. Stevenson, shrewdly, it
may justly be doubted whether such an arrangement might
not actually tempt a keeper to relax in his vigilance, and
rely on the alarum to waken him in case of need. In all
the dioptric lamps on the British coast, therefore, the converse
method is adopted of causing the bell to cease when
the clockwork stops.

Another and more important precaution consists in
keeping always at hand, in the light-room, a
spare lamp
,
trimmed, and adjusted to the proper height for the focus,
and in every respect ready to act as a substitute for the
other if any accident occurs.

But while I am tracing these words, I read that experiments
have been successfully made with
gas
for the illumination
of the lenticular apparatus, and that, if it will
afford a steadier and fuller light, at less expense, and with
no risk of accident, it will probably be adopted.

To continue:â

Once having acquired a full command of all the rays
amplified from the lamp, the next desideratum was to
[90]

diversify the appearance of the light which they constituted;
for, as I have already said, it is not enough to
stretch a belt of warning fires around the coast,âwe must
take care that each shall in some wise be distinguished
from the other, so as to afford the navigator a clue to its
particular locality. Hence arose the division into fixed,
revolving, intermittent lights, and so on, which I have
already described, and which is secured in the following
manner:â

FRESNELâS REVOLVING LIGHT.

If a
fixed light
be required, the apparatus as invented by
Fresnel takes the form of an annular glass frame produced
by the revolution of the section passing through the centre
of a circular lens, and reflecting prisms around a vertical
elevated on the principal axis of this section, as shown in
the diagram.

[91]

For
revolving apparatus
, Fresnelâs apparatus, as employed
in all lighthouses prior to the introduction of the holophotal
arrangement, consisted, as may be seen in the diagram, of
annular lenses,
L
, for acting on the central part of the light,
while the upper rays were refracted by inclined hanging
lenses,
a
, and ultimately reflected into the proper direction
by silvered mirrors marked
b
, placed above. The lower
rays were intercepted by fixed light prisms,
p p
(
which did
not revolve
), and which, showing a fixed light all round,
were, of course, of very inferior power to the solid beams
proceeding from the large lenses
L
, and the smaller lenses
and mirrors placed above. Strictly speaking, Fresnelâs
revolving light consisted of a
revolving
and a weak
fixed

light. As the frame revolved round the central lamp, the
mariner saw the
luminous beam when
the lenses were turned
towards him, and the
number of flashes depended
on the quickness
of the rotation.

STEVENSONâS HOLOPHOTAL REVOLVING LIGHT.

The apparatus
adopted by Fresnel
for the
fixed
light
may be regarded as
perfect; but his
revolving

light has been now
superseded by the
holophotal apparatus
of Mr. Thomas Stevenson.
The inclined mirrors and lenses employed in
[92]

Fresnelâs apparatus are done away with in Mr. Stevensonâs,
shown in the diagram, in which, by the single agency of
lenses,
L
, and totally reflecting prisms,
p
, all the rays are
rendered parallel. In this form the
whole
glass frame, consisting
of lenses and reflecting prisms, revolves round the
central lamp. As Fresnelâs lighthouse prisms only gathered
the light vertically, they could not produce the sheaf of
rays required for the revolving light unless when combined
with others which gathered the rays horizontally. The
first lighthouse in which single prisms were made to revolve
was the Horsburgh light, near Singapore, the apparatus of
which was designed by Mr. Stevenson in 1850. In this
form of revolving light apparatus the prisms are generated
about a horizontal instead of a vertical axis, as in fixed
light. The forms of the beams of light issuing forth from
Fresnel and Stevensonâs apparatus are shown opposite
to the diagram of each, and
marked
x, y
.

STEVENSONâS FIXED LIGHT VARIED
BY FLASHES.

In France there is frequently
employed what Fresnel called
a â
fixed light varied by flashes
.â
This effect is produced, as
already explained, by causing
panels of glass, curved horizontally
but not vertically, to revolve
outside of Fresnelâs fixed
apparatus, as shown in the
diagram. The ordinary fixed
apparatus only acts in the vertical
plane, while the straight
panels only act in the horizontal
[93]

plane. So that when the fixed apparatus is alone visible
the rays are only gathered from the vertical plane, and the
light is comparatively weak; but when the panels come
opposite the eye, the rays are gathered from both planes
into one powerful beam, as in a revolving light. Here, as
in the former case, two agents are employed, causing great
loss of light and great unnecessary expense, where one,
[94]

if of the proper form, is sufficient. Mr. Stevensonâs modification
of the holophotal arrangement for this purpose is
shown in the diagram. It consists of alternate panels of
the fixed light and holophotal apparatus; and thus, by
single agency, a weak fixed light and a stronger revolving
light are shown time-about to the mariner, which is the
required characteristic.

FRESNELâS FIXED LIGHT
APPARATUS.

FRENCH FORM OF APPARATUS FOR A
FIXED LIGHT VARIED BY FLASHES.

If, for the sake of further diversity, the lights are to be
coloured, we content ourselves in the case of a fixed light,
as already stated, with enclosing the flame in a green or
red tube. In the French eclipsing apparatus, polished
sheets of coloured glass are placed, on one side or the other,
against the lenses intended to emit the flashes of colour.

While doing all honour to Fresnel and his great invention,
we must not forget that its present comparative
perfection is due to Mr. Thomas Stevenson, whose
improvements, in truth, have eventuated in almost a
new system, now known as the
Holophotal
,
[22]
and already
partially described. By a peculiar combination of dioptric
spherical mirrors and other apparatus, it also succeeds
in economizing and condensing into one beam the
whole of the rays thrown off from the burners; but I fear
that any explanation of it which could here be attempted
would, from its necessary introduction of technical language,
prove unintelligible to the non-scientific reader.

[95]

CHAPTER IV.

THE INTERIOR OF A LIGHTHOUSE.

After
having devoted so many pages to what
we have calledâperhaps somewhat fancifullyâthe

soul
of the lighthouse, it becomes
necessary to say a few words in reference to
the
body
which encases it.

In building up this body, no less ingenuity and science
have been displayed than in perfecting and expanding the
light which gives it life and value. Whether the lighthouse-tower
is situated on some wave-washed rock
surrounded by a hungry sea, or on the summit of a
conspicuous headland, the highest skill is exercised upon
its construction, and it becomes, in many instances, a
monument of the most brilliant architectural genius. Not,
indeed, that it exhibits those beautiful features of clustered
columns and lofty arches, or that elaboration of picturesque
ornament, which delight us in the lordly mansion and the
ancient cathedral; but that an equal perfection of art is
revealed in its massive simplicity and impregnable solidity,
and in its admirable adaptation to the grand purposes for
which it is intended.

[96]

Two primary conditions, it is obvious, must always
govern the construction of a lighthouse: it must be
raised to an elevation suitable for the full display of its
warning radiance, and it must be built with a strength
and solidity which will defy the assault of wind or
wave.

So far as the first condition is concerned, the proper
height of a lighthouse-tower is easily ascertained, when
the distance is determined at which its rays should be
visible. This distance will necessarily depend on the
character of the neighbouring seas, and the nature of the
reef, rock, or shallow from which the lighthouse is to
warn the navigator; but, once determined, the elevation
of the tower will easily be calculated by means of the
known relations existing between the form of the earth,
the effects of atmospheric refraction, and the proper height
of an object which is to be seen from a given distance.
The state of the atmosphere at any particular point is
also an important point of consideration. It is quite
possible that the lighthouse, when erected at what seems
a suitable elevation, may be rendered useless by a prevalence
at that elevation of dense mists and heavy fogs.
In 1785, the Trinity Board commenced the erection of a
lighthouse on the summit of St. Catherineâs Down, in the
Isle of Wight, and from so lofty an altitude it might well
be supposed that its radiance would illuminate the
Channel for leagues around. But, unfortunately, the
crest of St. Catherineâs is, for the greater part of the year,
enveloped in cloud and mist, which effectually prevents
the escape of a single ray of light; and, consequently, the
Trinity Board were compelled to abandon their design.
[97]

The shell of the building still crowns the bleak summit
of the down, as a warning to future lighthouse-builders.

Still more recently, the lighthouse on the Needles
Down (also in the Isle of Wight), which for years had
pointed out the dangerous character of the western
entrance to the Solent, has been abandoned on account of
the mists so frequently obscuring its lustre; and a new
lighthouse has been erected on the outermost of the
celebrated Needle Rocks, in a position of far greater
utility.

The question regarding the
interior
accommodation of
the tower must, in like manner, be answered by the nature
of the locality where it is erected. Where it is easily accessible,
and its stores can be replenished with ease at very
short intervals, obviously the interior accommodation may
be reduced within very narrow limits. But in exposed
situations, as, for instance, on an isolated rock, whose
communication with the mainland may be cut off for
weeks at a time, room must be provided for ample
supplies, and conveniences for the keepers must be
arranged on a liberal scale. In the long and dreary
nights of winter, where, in the northern parts of Great
Britain, it is necessary to keep the light burning for about
seventeen hours, not even for a moment is it left without
the watchful care of at least one keeper; and thus, as he
will require an interval of repose, its superintendence will
occupy
two
persons; but in open, exposed places like the Eddystone,
the Bell Rock, the Wolf, and the Skerryvore, where
it is frequently impossible to communicate with the mainland
for three, four, and even six weeks, circumstances have
[98]

rendered it desirable that there should not be fewer than

three
men on duty. Hence, sleeping apartments have to
be provided, as well as receptacles for sufficient supplies
of water, food, fuel, and other matters.

The second condition to which we have adverted is,
that the building shall be capable of resisting the force of
the wind and waves. The wind is baffled with comparative
ease, but the sea is a far more formidable, and, moreover,
is an ever-present foe. Even in the summer months the
pressure of the waves is very considerable, averaging, perhaps,
about 611 lbs. per square foot of surface exposed to it. In
the winter, however, the average rises to 2086 lbs. per square
foot; while, during stormy weather, the force has amounted
to no less than 4335 lbs.
[23]
To oppose this immense pressure,
not only must the masonry be of the solidest description,
but such a form must be given to the building as
will expose that masonry to the least possible stress. From
various experiments it has been found that the most effective
form is that of the cylinder; and with certain modifications,
the cylindrical is now almost universally adopted
in the erection of lighthouses. Scientifically speaking,
however, it is not so much a cylinder as the union of
frustra of different cones, with a curve osculating the outline
of the successive frustra. To the youthful reader this
may not be very intelligible, and we will, therefore, refer
him to the form of the Eddystone as an illustration of what
we mean. Smeaton himself relates that it was suggested
to him by the trunk of an oak, but there seems reason to
[99]

believe that this was an after-thought, intended for the
benefit of the large class of minds which cannot appreciate
scientific reasonings.

Let us now pass into the interior of a lighthouse, and
take notice of its general arrangements.

And, first, observe the massive door of bronze which
opens to admit us into the lowermost story. Here are
collected the stores of wood, cordage, oil, and water; and
here too is placed the carpenterâs shop. On the next
story we find the kitchen and the dining-room. Then we
ascend to the sleeping-rooms of the three keepers; they
are exquisitely neat and clean, but in other respects do
not call for notice. On the highest story we enter that
portion of the structure more particularly destined for the
special service of the tower. It contains numerous vessels
of oil, lenses, lamps, a thermometer, a barometer, and a
chronometer. The spiral staircase by which we have
hitherto ascended terminates at this point, and to reach
the lantern we must climb a ladder before us. Entering
the cupola, which enshrines the magic light, we are surprised
by its exquisite propriety of arrangement. The form
of the lantern is light and graceful; and to avoid the
necessity of painting it, the framework is made of gun
metal, and the dome of copper. A lantern for a light of
the first order is twelve feet in diameter, and its glass frames
are two feet high. The glazing is thick, and great care
is exercised in fixing it that the plates may not be broken
during high winds. Panes glazed in frames padded with
cushions, and capable of being temporarily fixed in a few
minutes, are always kept ready for use in Scotland. These are
[100]

called
storm-panes
. The total cost of a lantern such as we
have been describing is about Â£1260.

CUPOLA OF A LIGHTHOUSE OF THE FIRST CLASS.

To secure a good and efficient light it is necessary that
[101]

the lantern should be well ventilated. Otherwise its sides
will be continually covered by the water of condensation
produced by the contact of the ascending current of heated
air, and the glass, thus obscured, impedes the passage of
the rays and diminishes their power. To prevent such an
evil an excellent system of mechanical ventilation was devised
by the late Professor Faraday.

The ventilating pipe or chimney is a copper tube four
inches in diameter, divided into three or four lengths; the
lower end of each for about an inch and a half being opened
out into a conical form, about five inches and a half in
diameter at the lowest part. When the chimney is put
together, the upper end of the bottom piece is inserted
about half an inch into the cone of the next piece above,
and fixed there by three ties or pins, so that the two
pieces are firmly held together; but there is still plenty of
airway or entrance into the chimney between them.
The same arrangement holds good with each succeeding
piece. When the ventilating chimney is fixed in its place,
it is so adjusted that the lamp chimney enters about half
an inch into the lower cone, and the top of the ventilating
chimney into the cowl or head of the lantern.

With this arrangement (I use the Professorâs own words)
it is found that the action of the ventilating flue is to
carry up every portion of the products of combustion into
the cowl; none passes by the cone apertures out of the
flue into the air by the lantern, but a portion of the air
passes from the lantern by these apertures into the flue, and
so the lantern itself is in some degree ventilated.

The important use of these cone apertures is, that when
a sudden gust or eddy of wind strikes into the cowl of the
[102]

lantern, it should not have any effect in disturbing or altering
the flame. It is found that the wind may blow suddenly
in at the cowl, and the effect never reaches the lamp. The
upper, or the second, or the third, or even the fourth portion
of the ventilating flue might be entirely closed, yet
without influencing the flame. The cone junctions in no way
interfere with the tube in carrying up all the products of
combustion; but if any downward current occurs, they dispose
of the whole of it into the room without ever affecting
the lamp. The ventilating flue is, in fact, a tube which,
as regards the lamp, can carry everything up but conveys
nothing
down
.

The British lighthouses, as I have stated, are under the
charge of either two or three keepers, whose duties are to
cleanse and prepare the apparatus for nocturnal illumination,
and to mount guard alternately after the light is
exhibited. The rule is, that under no circumstance shall
the keeper on duty leave the light-room until relieved by
his comrade; and that no pretence may exist for disobeying
this all-important regulation, the dwelling-houses are invariably
built in immediate proximity to the light-tower,
and means are provided for signaling directly from the
light-room to the sleeping apartments below.

For greater security in all such exposed situations as
the Eddystone or the Bell Rock,
four
keepers are provided
for one light-room. One of these is always ashore, on
leave, with his family, and the other three are on guard
in the lighthouse, so that, in the case of the illness of one
light-keeper, an efficient establishment of two keepers for
watching the light may remain.

[103]

The following interesting details we borrow verbatim
from Mr. Alan Stevenson:
[24]
â

Each of the two (or three) light-keepers has a house for
himself and family, both being under a common roof, but
entering by separate doors. The principal keeperâs house
consists of six rooms, two of which are at the disposal of
the visiting officers of the Board, whose duty in inspecting
the lighthouse or superintending repairs may call them to
the station; and the assistant has four rooms, one of which
is used as a barrack-room for the workmen who, under
the direction of the foreman of the light-room works,
execute the annual repairs of the apparatus.

The greatest care must be bestowed on securing the
utmost cleanliness in every detail connected with a lighthouse,
whose optical apparatus is peculiarly sensitive to
the effect of dust. For this purpose covered ash-pits are
provided at all the dwelling-houses, in order that the
refuse of the fireplaces may not be carried on âthe
wings of the windâ to the light-room; and, for similar
reasons, iron floors are used in the light-rooms instead
of stone, which is often liable to abrasion, and all
the stonework near the lantern is regularly painted
in oil.

If, in all that belongs to a lighthouse, the greatest
cleanliness is desirable, it is in a still higher degree necessary
in every part of the light-room apparatus, without
which the optical instruments and the machinery will
neither last long nor work well. Every part of the apparatus,
whether lenses or reflectors, should be carefully
freed from dust before being either washed or burnished;
[104]

and without such a precaution the cleansing process would
only serve to scratch them.

For burnishing the reflectors, prepared
rouge
(tritoxide
of iron) of the finest description, which should be prepared
in the state of an impalpable powder of a deep orange-red
colour, is applied by means of soft chamois skins, as occasion
may require; but the great art of keeping reflectors clean
consists in the daily patient and skilful application of
manual labour in rubbing the surface of the instrument
with a perfectly dry, soft, and clean skin, without rouge.
The form of the hollow paraboloid is such that some practice
is necessary in order to acquire a free movement of the
hand in rubbing reflectors; and its attainment forms one of
the principal lessons in the course of the preliminary instruction
to which candidates for the situation of a
lighthouse-keeper are subjected. For cleansing the lenses
and glass-mirrors spirit of wine is used. Having washed
the surface of the instrument with a linen cloth steeped
in spirit of wine, it is carefully dried with a soft and dry
linen rubber, and finally rubbed with a fine chamois skin
free from any dust, which would injure the polish of the
glass, as well as from grease. It is sometimes necessary to
use a little fine rouge with a chamois skin for restoring
any deficiency of polish which may occur from time to
time; but in a well-managed lighthouse this application
will seldom, if ever, be required.

Before we quit this subject, it may interest the reader
to be informed that the glass of the lantern is frequently
broken, not by wind and wave, but by the sea-birds
which dash violently against it. In a single night at

[107]
Cape de BrÃ©hat nine panes were shattered from this cause.
At the lighthouse of BrÃ©hat a wild duck forced its way
through two rows of mirrors and fell upon the lamp. A
thousand of these birds were on one occasion caught by
the crew of a British lightship, who made them into a
gigantic pie. It is necessary to defend with trellis-work
the lights most exposed to visits of this kind.

SEA-BIRDS ATTRACTED BY THE RAYS OF A LIGHTHOUSE.

Fortunately, all sea-birds are not so dangerous. Some
of them even render to the navigator a service like that
which the goose of the capitol, according to Livy, once
rendered to the Romans. At the South Stock lighthouse,
near Holyhead, which is situated in the middle of an
islet, tamed sea-birds are made use of as signals. The
gulls perch on the lighthouse walls and utter loud cries,
which wave off approaching seamen. This lighthouse
possesses a bell and a cannon, but the natural signal has
been esteemed so superior that the cannon has been removed
to a distance from the rock, lest its discharge should
alarm the birds. The young gulls roam about the island
among the white rabbits, living in perfect harmony with
them, and providing the keepers with society; a pleasanter
society than that of the wind and waves which incessantly
vent their fury on the solitary pharos.

BOOK III.

LIGHTHOUSES OF GREAT BRITAIN.

CHAPTER I.

THE STORY OF THE EDDYSTONE: A.D. 1696, 1706, 1759.

The
first lighthouse of a regular character erected
on the shores of England seems to have been
that of Lowestoft, in 1609. Among its successors
we may refer to those of Hunstanton
Point, 1665, and of the Scilly Islands, 1680. To the
same epoch belong the lighthouses of Dungeness, Orfordness,
and the Eddystone; the latter being the most important,
the most remarkable, and the most interesting,
as, I think, the following brief narrative will not fail to
show.

The
Eddystone
is the name of the highest summit of a
reef of rocks which lie in deep water about fourteen miles
to the south-west of Plymouth harbour. As they are in
a line with Lizard Head, in Cornwall, and Start Point, in
[109]

Devonshire, they are not only in the track of vessels
bound for the great Devonian seaport, but of vessels coasting
up and down the English Channel. At high water
they are barely visible, and their position could only be
told by the waves which
eddy
and seethe above them; at
low water several low, broken, and dismal-looking ridges
of gneiss become conspicuous. When the wind blows from
the south-west, they are the centre of âa hell of waters,â
and no ship involved in the vortex could hope to escape
destruction.

It may readily be conceived that so perilous a reef,
when unprotected by any beacon, was a source of deep
alarm to the mariner, who, to give it the widest possible
berth, was accustomed to enter the Channel in a much
more southerly latitude than is now done. But in avoiding
Scylla he often fell into Charybdis, and hence the
numerous wrecks which occurred on the French coast, and
more particularly upon the dangerous rocks surrounding
the islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney.

The erection of a lighthouse upon the Eddystone was,
therefore, a matter of national concern; yet no one could
be found to undertake a task whose accomplishment nature
seemed to have rendered impossible, until Henry Winstanley,
a country gentleman of Littleberry, in Essex,
chivalrously came forward in the year 1696, and having
obtained the necessary legal powers, proceeded to carry
his design into execution. This same Winstanley was
one of those eccentric geniuses who find a pleasure in
mystifying their friends, and in investing their daily life
with an air of legerdemain. He adapted science to
practical jokes with an ingenuity which, we think, has never
[110]

been surpassed. If a guest in his bedroom kicked an old
slipper out of his way, immediately a ghost started from
the floor. If, in another, he threw himself into a chair,
it suddenly flung out its two arms, and held him fast as a
prisoner. Or if in the garden he retired into an arbour,
and rested on a particular seat, he was straightway set
afloat in the middle of the adjoining canal.

To the native eccentricity of the man, it has been justly
remarked, may be ascribed the fantastical character of the
first Eddystone Lighthouse. Its erection was begun in
1696. The first summerâand it was only in summer the
work could be carried onâwas occupied in making twelve
holes in the rock, and fastening as many irons in them, to
serve as the superstructure.
[25]
The task progressed but
slowly, for, as Winstanley himself relates, though it was
summer, the weather would at times prove of such terrible
violence, that for ten or fourteen days together the sea
would so rage about the rocksâagitated by out-winds and
the inrush of the ground-swell from the main oceanâas to
mount and leap upwards some two hundred feet, completely
burying the works, and preventing all approach to
them.

The second summer was spent in constructing a solid
round pillar twelve feet high and fourteen feet in diameter.
In the third year the pillar was enlarged two feet at the
base, and the edifice carried up to a height of sixty feet.
âBeing all finished,â says the engineer,
[112]
âwith the lantern,
and all the rooms that were in it, we ventured to lodge
there soon after midsummer, for the greater dispatch of
the work. But the first night the weather came bad, and
so continued, that it was eleven days before any boats
could come near us again; and not being acquainted with
the height of the seaâs rising, we were almost drowned
with wet, and our provisions in as bad a condition, though
we worked night and day as much as possible to make
shelter for ourselves. In this storm we lost some of our
materials, although we did what we could to save them;
but the boat then returning, we all left the house to be
refreshed on shore: and as soon as the weather did permit
we returned and finished all, and put up the light on the
14th November 1698; which being so late in the year, it
was three days before Christmas before we had relief to
go on shore again, and were almost at the last extremity
for want of provisions; but, by good Providence, then two
boats came with provisions and the family that was to
take care of the light; and so ended this yearâs work.â

WINSTANLEYâS LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDDYSTONE.

The fourth year was devoted to strengthening the
foundations and enlarging the structure, which, when
completed, resembled nothing so much as âa Chinese
pagoda, with open galleries and fantastic projections.â
The gallery around the lantern was so wide and open, that
it was possible, when the sea ran high, for a six-oared
boat to be lifted by the waves and driven through it.
Such an edifice could not long resist the fury of the waters
or the violence of the gale; but, at least, it served to prove
that a lighthouse
could
be erected on the rock, and its
achievement was one of the most laudable enterprises
which any heroic mind could undertake, for it filled the
breast of the mariner with new hope.

Winstanley was proud of his work, and so convinced,
[113]

it is said, of its entire solidity, that he expressed a wish
to be beneath its roof in the greatest storm that ever blew
under the face of heaven, convinced that it could not shake
one joist or beam. He had his presumptuous wish fulfilled.
With his workmen and keepers he had taken up
his abode in the lighthouse, when a terrible gale blew up,
and on the 26th of November attained to an unparalleled
excess of fury. In truth, it was of so frightful a character
that contemporary annals vividly record its destructive
effects, and the alarm it produced.

All through that memorable night the tempest raged.
As soon as morning came the people of Plymouth hastened
to the beach, and turned their gaze instinctively
towards the Eddystone. But no structure crowned the
rock, over which the waves were tossing and swirling all
unchecked. The lighthouse was swept away, and no
vestiges remained of its adventurous occupants.

The question now arose, Who was to rebuild the lighthouse?
Three years passed before it was answered; and
then the task was taken up by one Captain Lovet, who
obtained a ninety-nine yearsâ lease from the Trinity Corporation,
and immediately engaged as his architect a
silk-mercer

on Ludgate Hill, named John Rudyerd. What
reasons guided Lovet in his curious choice we cannot
ascertain; probably Rudyerd had given some signal proofs
of mechanical ingenuity; but, at all events, the choice
proved a felicitous one. Rudyerd submitted for the new
building an elegant and admirable design; instead of a
polygon, he chose a circle for the outline, and instead of
the projections and ornaments with which Winstanley had
[114]

arrested every breeze that blew, he studied the utmost simplicity,
so as to offer wind or wave the slightest possible
resistance.

He secured the foundation with the utmost care. He
divided the irregular surface of the rock into seven rather
unequal stages, and cut thirty-six holes in these, to the
depth of from twenty to thirty inches. These holes were
six inches square at the top, gradually narrowing to five
inches, and then again expanding and flattening to nine
inches by three at the bottom. Into these dove-tailed
holes strong iron bolts or branches were keyed; each bolt
being fitted exactly in size to the hole it was intended to
fill, and weighing from two to five hundredweight, according
to its length and structure.

The bolts made fast, Rudyerd proceeded to fix a course
of squared oak timbers lengthwise upon the lowest step, so
as to reach the level of the step above. Another set of
timbers were then laid crosswise, so as to cover those
already laid, and to raise the level surface to the height of
the third stage. The third structure was again laid
lengthwise, the fourth crosswise, and so on, alternately,
until a basement of solid wood was secured, two courses
higher than the highest point of the rock; all being fitted
together and to the rock, by means of the bolts, as firmly
as possible, and all, in their intersections with one another,
being closely trenailed.

The bolts originally let into the solid rock were perforated
in their upper partsâsome with three, and some
with four holes; so that in every pair, collectively called
a
branch
, there would be about seven holes. As the
branches numbered thirty-six, there would be 252 holes,
[115]

each about seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, and consequently
as many large âbearded spikesâ or âjag-bolts,â
which, being driven through the branches into the solid
timber, held the mass firmly down.

Rudyerdâs lighthouse is generally described as a timber
edifice. This is not correct. Knowing that weight is
best resisted and counteracted by weight, and to insure a
sufficient amount of resistance, he combined with his
courses of timber solid courses of Cornish granite, in this
manner: the foundation was of oak for two courses; then
came five courses of stone, each a foot in thickness, kept
together by iron cramps; and then two courses more of
timber. Thus was completed the basement.

The remainder of the edifice, which rose to an elevation
of 69 feet, on a base of 23 feet, was built of timber. The
interior consisted of four rooms, one above the other; and
above the topmost was the lanternâan octagon of
10 feet 6 inches in diameter, crowned by a ball of 2 feet
3 inches in diameter. The whole height of the lighthouse,
from the lowest side of the rock to the top of the ball,
was 92 feet. It was completely finished in 1709.

In connection with this ingenious structure an anecdote
is always related, illustrative of the kindly feeling which
Louis XIV. occasionally exhibited. There was war at
the time between England and France, and a French privateer
seized the opportunity of carrying off the workmen
employed in building the lighthouse as prisoners. As
soon as their capture was made known to the king, he
ordered their immediate release, and that they should be
sent back to their work, with some presents to compensate
[116]

for their detention. âThough at war with England,â said
the king, âI am not at war with mankind.â The Eddystone
lighthouse is so situated as to be of equal service
to all nations having occasion to navigate the Channel that
separates France from England.

Yet another anecdote: Some visitors to the lighthouse,
after inspecting its internal arrangements, observed to one
of the keepers that he thought it quite possible to live
very comfortably in its quiet seclusion. âThat might be,â
said the man, âif we had but the use of our tongues; but
it is now fully a month since my partner and I have spoken
to each other.â

Rudyerdâs lighthouse continued to brave âthe elemental
fury,â and warn the seamen from the fatal rocks,
until the 2nd of December 1755, when it fell before a most
unexpected enemy. Through some unknown cause the
building caught fire. Three keepers at the time were
within the lighthouse; and when one of them, whose
turn it was to watch, entered the lantern, at about two
oâclock in the morning, to snuff the candles, he discovered
it to be filled with smoke,
[26]
and on his opening the door
which led to the balcony, a flame instantly burst from the
inside of the cupola. He hastened to alarm his companions,
and they used every exertion to extinguish the
fire; but, owing to the difficulty of raising a sufficient
supply of water to the top of the building, and the dryness
of the internal timber, they soon found their efforts
[117]

vain, and as the fire increased in force, were compelled to
retreat downwards from stage to stage.

Early in the morning the fire was descried by some
fishermen, who carried the news ashore, and a well-manned
boat was immediately dispatched to the relief of the poor
keepers.

It reached the Eddystone at ten oâclock, when the fire
had been burning eight hours. The light-keepers had
been driven from the building to avoid the falling beams,
and molten lead and red-hot iron; and were found, stupefied
with terror, in a cave on the east side of the rock.
With difficulty they were removed into the boat, and carried
ashore. No sooner were they landed than one of
them, strange to say, immediately made off, and was never
afterwards heard of. So singular a circumstance naturally
engendered a suspicion that he had originated the fire;
but when we remember that a lighthouse affords no
means of retreat for its inmates, and that the probability
is they will perish with it, we can barely believe it to be
the place which an incendiary would choose for his nefarious
design. As Smeaton says, we would rather impute
the manâs sudden flight to that kind of panic which sometimes,
on important occasions, overpowers a weak mind;
making it act without reason, and influencing it to commit
unwittingly the most preposterous and injurious
mistakes.

Of the other two light-keepers, one, named Henry Hall,
met his death in an extraordinary manner. While engaged
in throwing some buckets of water on the flaming roof of
the cupola, he happened to look upwards, and a quantity
of lead, melted by the heat, descended suddenly from the
[118]

roof, and fell on his head, face, and shoulders, burning him
severely. His mouth was open at the time, and he persisted
in declaring that a portion of the lead had gone
down his throat. The medical practitioner who attended
him after his removal ashore not unnaturally regarded the
story as incredible; but the man continued to grow worse,
and on the twelfth day of his illness, after some violent
spasms, expired. A post-mortem examination of his body
was then made, and the poor manâs assertion found to be
literally true, for in the stomach lay a flat oval piece of
lead seven ounces and five drachms in weight.

Before we quit the subject of Rudyerdâs Lighthouse,
we must refer to another romantic narrative of which it
was the scene.

For some years after its establishment it was attended
by two custodians only, whose duty it was to keep the
windows of the lantern clean, and who were on guard for
four hours alternately. Each at the conclusion of his watch
was bound to call the other, and before he retired, to see
that his successor took up his proper post. It happened,
however, that, on one occasion, when the keeper on duty
went to call his colleague, he found himâdead. Immediately
he hoisted his flag on the balcony, from whence it
was visible at the Rame Head, near Plymouth, and
waited eagerly for the assistance this signal usually
brought. Unhappily, the weather became so boisterous
that no boat could put out from the shore, and the lonely
keeper was reduced to the miserable companionship of a
dead body. It is difficult to conceive of any situation
more wretched or alarming; he dared not dispose of the
[119]

corpse; for if he flung it into the wavesâhis only means
of getting rid of itâhe justly feared that he might be
charged with the murder of his companion; and yet, each
day that it remained, his own life was endangered by its
extremely offensive condition. For nearly a month this
long agony lasted. When, at last, a boat succeeded in
reaching the rock, the building was found to be filled
with an intolerable odour, and the corpse in such a condition
that it was impossible to remove it to Plymouth for
interment; it was therefore consigned to the deep.

This incident led to the employment thenceforward of
three keepers, so that in case one of them died, or was
sick, there might always be two on duty.

The value of a lighthouse on the Eddystone had been
so abundantly proved, and, owing to the rapidly increasing
commerce of the kingdom, its necessity was now so
absolute, that the authorities resolved to lose no time in
erecting a new one in the place of Rudyerdâs unfortunate
structure.

As on the two previous occasions, says Mr. Smiles, when,
first, a country gentleman, and, next, a London mercer,
had been called upon to undertake this difficult work, the
person now appointed was neither a builder, an architect,
nor an engineer, but a mathematical instrument maker.
John Smeaton, howeverâto whom the difficult task was
entrustedâhad already given proof of a signal capacity for
mechanics, and in the general estimation of scientific men
no better or more fortunate selection could possibly have
been made.

At this time Smeaton was only thirty-two years of age,
[120]

having been born at Ansthorpe Lodge, near Leeds, on the
8th of June 1724. His father was a respectable attorney,
but, from his earliest youth, John Smeaton had exhibited
a natural predisposition for the engineerâs business. In
truth, he was a mechanic born; in his childhood his playthings
were mechanical tools; and before his sixth year he
had designed a windmill and the model of a pump. He
was sent to school at Leeds, but seems to have made no
progress in any other branches than geometry and arithmetic.
He occupied his holidays with mechanical pursuits,
and on one occasion constructed a forcing-pump, which
exhausted all the water in his fatherâs fish-pond. At the
age of fourteen he was an adept at smithery and turnery.
He forged his iron and steel, and melted his metal. Tools
had he in abundance, and of every kind, for working in
metals, wood, or ivory. What was to be done with such
a lad? His father wished him to be a âgentleman,â and
follow his own profession; Smeaton was content to become
an âoperative,â and apprenticed himself to a mathematical
instrument maker. He soon attained to such proficiency,
that, in 1750, he commenced business on his own
account. In 1751 he invented a machine to measure a
shipâs way at sea, as also a compass of peculiar construction.
Enlarging the range of his studies, he submitted
to the Royal Society, in 1752, some improvements which
he had contrived in the air-pump, and experiments on the
natural power of water and wind to turn mills and other
machines dependent on circular motion.

Such was the manâingenious, able, earnest, patient,
and perseveringâto whom was entrusted the erection of
the
third
lighthouse upon the Eddystone rock.

[121]

On examining into the nature of the work he was required
to undertake, his first conclusion was, that both
Winstanleyâs and Rudyerdâs lighthouses had been deficient
in want of
weight
, and he announced it as his intention
to build a structure of such solidity that the sea
should give way to the lighthouse, and not the lighthouse
to the sea. He therefore resolved to build it of
stone.

His predecessors had lost much valuable time from the
difficulty of landing on the rock, and of working on it
continuously for any considerable period. To obviate this,
Smeaton decided on mooring a vessel within a quarter of
a mile of it, which should accommodate the workmen and
their tools, and enable them to seize every favourable opportunity
of putting out their boat and carrying their
materials to the Eddystone, instead of making a long
voyage from Plymouth on each occasion.

With respect to the
form
of his intended erection, he
resolved to adopt Rudyerdâs idea of a cone, but to enlarge
the diameter considerably, and, on the whole, to
keep before him as a model the trunk of a stately oak
tree.
[27]

The first actual work done on the rock was in August
1756, but the autumn was mainly occupied in the transportation
and preparation of the granite and other materials,
and in excavating the steps or stages for the reception
of the foundation.

Early in June 1757 Smeaton resumed his task with
[122]

great energy and decision. On the 12th, the first stone
was laid, weighing two tons and a quarter. On the next
day the first course was finished, consisting of four stones.
These were ingeniously dove-tailed together, and into the
rock, so as to form a compact mass, from which it was impossible
to separate any particular stone. The sloping
form of the rock, remarks Mr. Smiles,
[28]
to which the foundation
of the building was adapted, required but this
small number of stones for the first course; the diameter
of the building increasing until it reached the level of the
rock. Then the second course, completed on the 30th of
June, consisted of thirteen stones; the third, completed
on the 11th of July, of twenty-five pieces; the fourth, on
the 31st, of thirty-three. The sixth course was finished
on the 11th of August, and rose above the general wash
of the tide, so that Smeaton might fairly consider he had
surmounted the greatest difficulties of his task.

Up to this level, the highest point of the rock, all the
courses had been begun by the stones that were securely
dove-tailed into the rock, and also made fast by oak
wedges and cement. To receive these wedges, a couple
of grooves were cut in the waist of each stone, from the
top to the bottom of the course, an inch deep and three
inches wide. We borrow from Smeatonâs own narrative
his description of the manner in which each stone was
laid:â

[123]

âThe stone to be set being hung in the tackle, and its
bed of mortar spread, was then lowered into its place, and
beaten with a heavy wooden mall, and levelled with a
spirit-level; and the stone being accurately brought to its
marks, it was then considered as set in its place. The
business now was to retain it exactly in that position, notwithstanding
the utmost violence of the sea might come
upon it before the mortar was hard enough to resist it.
The carpenter now dropped into each groove two of the
oaken wedges, one upon its head, the other with its point
downwards, so that the two wedges in each groove would
lie heads and points. With a bar of iron about two inches
and a half broad, a quarter of an inch thick, and two feet
and a half long, the ends being square, he could easily
(as with a rammer) drive down one wedge upon the other;
very gently at first, so that the opposite pairs of wedges,
being equally tightened, they would equally resist each
other, and the stone would therefore keep place. A
couple of wedges were also, in like manner, pitched at the
top of each groove; the dormant wedge, or that with the
point upward, being held in the hand, while the drift-wedge,
or that with its point downward, was driven with
a hammer. The whole of what remained above the upper
surface of the stone was then cut off with a saw or chisel;
and, generally, a couple of thin wedges were driven very
moderately at the butt-end of the stone; whose tendency
being to force it out of its dove-tail, they would, by
moderate driving, only tend to preserve the whole mass
steady together, in opposition to the violent agitation that
might arise from the sea.â

When the stone was firmly secured, the next step was
to liquefy a certain portion of mortar; and the joints having
been carefully pointed, up to the upper surface, this
mortar or cement was poured in with iron ladles so as to
occupy every empty space. The more consistent parts of
[124]

the cement naturally fell to the bottom, and the watery
were absorbed by the stone; the vacancy thus left at the
top was repeatedly refilled, until all remained solid; then
the top was pointed, and, where necessary, defended by a
layer of plaster.

The whole of the foundation having thus been elevated
to a proper level, some other means was required to obtain
a similar amount of security for the substructure.

A hole of one foot square was accordingly cut right
through the middle of the central stone in the sixth
course; and at equal distances in the circumference were
sunk eight other depressions of one foot square and six
inches deep. A strong plug of hard marble, from the
rocks near Plymouth, one foot square, and
twenty-two
inches
long, was set with mortar in the central cavity, and
driven firmly into it with wedges. As this course was

thirteen inches high
, it is evident that the marble plug
which reached through it rose
nine inches
above the surface.
Upon this was fixed the central stone of the next
course, having a similar bore in its middle, bedded with
mortar, and wedged as before. By this means, no force
of the sea acting horizontally upon the central stone, unless
it was able to cut in two the marble plug, could move
it from its position; and the more effectually to prevent
the stone from being lifted, in case its bed of mortar
should chance to be destroyed, it was fixed down by four
trenails. The stones surrounding the central were dove-tailed
to it in the same manner as before, and thus one
course rose above another, with no other interruption
than the occasional violence of the waves or inclemency of
the weather.

[125]

In every stage of the laborious and difficult work Smeaton
himself was foremost. When it had proceeded so far
as to present the appearance of a level platform, he could
not deny himself the gratification of enjoying the limited
promenade which it afforded; but making a false step, and
being unable to recover himself, he fell over the brink of
the work, and among the rocks on the west side. The
tide having retired, he sustained no very serious injury;
but he dislocated his thumb, and as no medical assistance
could be procured, set it himself, and returned to his work.
The incident is characteristic of the courage and tenacity
of the man.

The ninth course was laid on the 30th of September, and
the weather becoming boisterous, further operations were
suspended for that year.

The following winter was very tempestuous, and it was
the 12th of May before Smeaton and his workmen again
saw the Eddystone. To their delight and surprise they
found the entire work in the same condition as when they
left it. The cement appeared to have become as hard
as the stone itself, the whole being concreted into one
solid mass.

Thenceforward the work made vigorous and successful
progress, and, by September, the twenty-fourth course was
reached and laid. This completed what is called âthe
Solidâ part of the building, and formed the floor of the
store-room; so that Smeaton had no reason to be dissatisfied
with the operations of the season. But as he had
long been meditating on the advantage to the public which
would accrue if a light could be exhibited that very winter,
[126]

he resolved on a vigorous effort to complete the store-room
and erect a light above it.

The building, says an accurate authority,
[29]
had hitherto
been carried up solid as high as there was any reason to
imagine it would be subjected to the heavy rush of the
sea; that is, to 35 feet 4 inches above its base, and 27
feet above the top of the rock, on the common spring-tide
high-water mark. At this elevation it was reduced to 16
feet 8 inches diameter; and it was needful to make the
best use of this space, and economize it to the utmost advantage
consistent with the one primary and indispensable
condition of
strength
. The rooms were built with a
diameter of 12 feet 4 inches, having for the walls a thickness
of 2 feet 2 inches. These walls were made of single
blocks, and so shaped that a complete circle was formed
by sixteen pieces, which were cramped together with iron,
and also secured to the lower courses by marble plugs as
before. To prevent any humidity penetrating through the
vertical joints, flat stones were introduced into each, in
such a manner as to be lodged partly in one stone and
partly in another. With all these ingenious precautions,
the twenty-eighth course was completely set on the 30th
of September.

This, and the next course, received the vaulted floor,
which formed at once the
ceiling
of the store-room, and
the
floor
of the upper store-room. For additional security,
therefore, a groove was cut round the upper surface of the
course, in which was lodged a massive chain of iron.
Upon this chain, in the groove, melted lead was poured,
until the cavity was filled up. The next course was laid
[127]

and completed in a similar manner; and by the 10th of
October Smeaton had nearly perfected his arrangements
for establishing a light and light-keepers at the Eddystone,
when his hopes were suddenly stricken by a prohibition
from the Trinity House, based upon legal difficulties.
But this being at last removed, the work was recommenced
for the next and last season on the 5th of July. On the
21st, the second floor was finished; on the 29th, the
fortieth course was laid, and the third floor finished.

SMEATONâS LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDDYSTONE.

On the 17th of August 1759, the main column of the
lighthouse was completed. Forty-six courses of masonry
had been laid, and the graceful structure raised to its
specified height of seventy feet. The last work done,
very appropriately, was the engraving of the words âLaus
Deoâ (Praise be to God!) on the last stone set over the
lantern. At an earlier date, Smeaton, with devout
humility, had inscribed on the course beneath the ceiling
[128]

of the upper store-room, âExcept the Lord build the
house, they labour in vain that build it.â The iron-work
of the balcony and the lantern were next erected, and the
whole was surmounted by a gilt ball.

The internal arrangements of the lighthouse were as
follow:â

First, the store-room, with a doorway, but no windows.

Second, the upper store-room.

Third, the kitchen, with a fireplace and sink, two settles
with lockers, a dresser with drawers, two cupboards, and
a rack for dishes.

Fourth, the bedroom, with three cabin-beds, to hold one
man in each, with three drawers and two lockers in each
to receive his separate property.

Fifth, the lantern, in which a seat was placed all round,
except at the doorway.

Besides the windows of the lantern, ten other windows
were constructed for the edificeânamely, for the store-room
two, and for each of the upper rooms four. In fixing
their bars, an accident happened to Smeaton, which
was nearly attended with fatal results.

âAfter the boat was gone,â he says, âand it became so
dark that we could not see any longer to pursue our occupations,
I ordered a charcoal-fire to be made in the upper
store-room, in one of the iron pots we used for melting
lead, for the purpose of annealing the blank ends of the
bars; and they were made red-hot altogether in the charcoal.
Most of the workmen were set round the fire, and
by way of making ourselves comfortable, by screening
ourselves and the fire from the wind, the windows were
[129]

shut; and, as well as I remember, the copper cover or
hatch put over the man-hole of the floor of the room
where the fire wasâthe hatch above being left open for
the heated vapour to ascend. I remember to have looked
into the fire attentively to see that the iron was made
hot enough, but not overheated: I also remember I felt
my head a very little giddy; but the next thing of which
I had any sensation or idea was finding myself upon the
floor of the room below, half drowned with water. It
seems that, without being further sensible of anything to
give me warning, the effluvia of the charcoal so suddenly
overcame all sensation, that I dropped down upon the
floor; and had not the people hauled me down to the
room below, where they did not spare for cold water to
throw in my face and upon me, I certainly should have
expired upon the spot.â

Escaping this and other perils, Smeaton saw his beautiful
edifice finally brought to completion; and on the 16th
of October a light was once more shown from the Eddystone
rock.

The lighthouse has now, as Mr. Smiles remarks, withstood
the storms of upwards of a centuryâa solid monument
to the genius of its architect and builder. Sometimes,
he says,
[30]
when the sea rolls in with more than
ordinary fury from the Atlantic, and the billows are
driven up the Channel by the force of a south-west wind,
the lighthouse is enveloped in spray, and its light
momentarily obscured. But the shadow passes, and once
more it beams across the waters like a star, a signal and a
warning to the homeward bound. Occasionally, when a
[130]

strong wave strikes it, the central portion of the wave
shoots up the perpendicular shaft and leaps quite over the
lantern. At other times, a colossal billow hurls itself
upon the lighthouse, as if to shake it from its foundation;
and to its inmates the shock is like that of a cannon; the
windows rattle, the doors jar, and the building trembles
to its very base. But the vibration felt throughout the
lighthouse on such an occasion, instead of being a sign of
weakness, is the best evidence that can be desired of the
unity of the fabric and the cohesion of all its parts.

When the Eddystone was built, scarcely any other light
guided the mariner in his intricate navigation of the
Channel; but now it is abundantly illuminated along its
whole extent, and its course is almost as easily tracked as
that of a main thoroughfare in London. First comes the
St. Agnes Light, on one of the Scilly Isles, revolving every
minute, at an elevation of 138 feet above high water.
Next are made the two Lizard Lights, which crown the
rugged cliffs at the southernmost point of the English
coast. In the deep curve between this bold headland and
the craggy promontories of Bolt Head and Start Point, lie
the revolving light on St Anthonyâs Point, and the two
lights on Plymouth Breakwater; while out at sea, almost
in front of Plymouth Sound, and midway between the
Lizard and the Start, the waves beat and swirl around the
Eddystone. On Start Point there are two lights: one
revolving, for the Channel; and another fixed, to guide
ships inshore clear of the Skerries.

THE LIGHTSHIP AT THE NORE.

Continuing our voyage up Channel, we see on the
south, off the coast of Jersey, the three Casquet Lights,
[131]

and on the north the two fixed lights of Portland Hill.
If we make for Portsmouth, we are guided by the light
on the outermost Needle Rock and the harbour signals;
but keeping out at sea, we pass St. Catherineâs, on the
extreme southerly headland of the Isle of Wight, and
next, the lights displayed at different heights on the Nab,
and the single fixed light on the Owers vessel.

[132]

At Beachy Head the light, which revolves in two
minutes, is 285 feet above high water. At Dungeness,
the light, a red one of great power, is situated on
the low projection of Dungeness beach. Next are
sighted the harbour lights of Folkestone and Dover;
whilst on the French coast beams the flashing light of
the Varne Bank, and the splendid revolving light of Cape
Grisnez.

We quit the Channel with the South Foreland Lights,
one above the other, on our left, and enter the historic
waters of the Downsâso often traversed by the keels of
our victorious fleetsâwith the South Sandhead floating
light on the right. Then, on the one hand, our course is
guided by the floating lights of the Gull and the North
Sandheadâon the other by the friendly ray of the
North Foreland lighthouseâuntil we reach the broad
estuary of the Thames, where the lightship of the Nore
marks the entrance of the greatest marine highway in the
world.

[133]

CHAPTER II.

THE SMALLS LIGHTHOUSE.

The
motive which inspired the founder of the
Smalls Lighthouse was of a higher order than
those of most of his contemporaries. In erecting
a warning light upon these dangerous
rocks, Mr. Philips (for this was his name) proposed to
himself, as his great and enduring recompense, âto serve
and save humanity.â But, in this instance, generosity
met with its due reward even upon earth; and when the
descendants of the philanthropist disposed of their establishment
to the Trinity House, they received, by way of
compensation, a sum of Â£15,000.

The undertaking which Philips set himself was one of
no ordinary difficulty, of no common danger. The rock
on which he resolved to erect his lighthouse, in ordinary
weather rose fully twelve feet above the water; but when
the waves were heavyâa very common occurrence in those
partsâit was completely submerged. And in Philipsâs
time engineers were not so numerous as they are to-day;
the professors and practical expositors of science were then
but few, were misunderstood, frequently persecuted or
[134]

slandered, notwithstanding the precious contributions they
were making yearly to the great sum of human knowledge
and human happiness. Philips, therefore, searched
far and wide before he discovered a man able to carry out
his idea. At length he found him, but neither among
architects nor engineers; the assistant he chose was named
Whiteside, a musical instrument maker at Liverpool,
and gifted with a remarkable aptitude for mechanical
pursuits.

It was in the summer of 1772 that Whiteside first explored
the maze of rocks, with which it is no flight of
fancy to say his name will be ever associated. He landed
on the Smalls with a gallant little band of Cornish miners;
but the obstacles which he encountered at the very
beginning might well have disgusted him with the enterprise.
Scarcely was the foundation begun, before the
weather suddenly grew tempestuous, and so furious was
the gale, that the cutter which had disembarked them was
compelled to weigh anchor and put to sea. The unfortunate
workmen left upon the rock clung to it as best
they mightâclung to it as a drowning seaman to the
fragment of broken spar which alone interposes between
him and death; and in this wretched position they remained
for two days and nights. Yet even this rough prelude
could not discourage Whiteside, and he persevered through
a long series of difficulties and dangers until his task was
finished.

THE SMALLS LIGHTHOUSE.

One day the dwellers on the neighbouring coast picked
up on the beach what is so expressively called âa message
from the seaâânamely, a strip of paper enclosed in a

[135]

bottle very carefully sealedâthe bottle itself being
deposited in a cask or barrel. On the barrel were written
these words:â
[137]

âOpen this, and you will find a letter.â

The finders obeyed the injunction, and found the following:â

âThe Smalls
,
February 1st, 1777
.

âSir,âBeing now in a most dangerous and distressed condition
upon the Smalls, do hereby trust Providence will bring to your
hand this, which prayeth for your immediate assistance to fetch
us off the Smalls before the next spring, or we fear we shall perish;
our water near all gone, our fire quite gone, and our house in a
most melancholy manner. I doubt not but you will fetch us from
here as fast as possible; we can be got off at some part of the tide
almost any weather. I need say no more, but remain your distressed,

âHumble servant,

â
H. Whiteside.â

Beneath this signature a postscript had been added:â

âWe were distressed in a gale of wind upon the 13th of January,
since which have not been able to keep any light; but we
could not have kept any light above sixteen nights longer for want
of oil and candles, which makes us murmur and think we are forgotten.

âEdward Edwards
,
G. Adams
,
J. Price
.

â
P.S.
âWe doubt not that whoever takes up this will be so
merciful as to cause it to be sent to Thomas Williams, Esq.,
Trelethin, near St. Davidâs, Wales.â

There are sadder pages than this, however, in the brief
chronicle of the Smalls, and one bears a close resemblance
to a painful incident associated with the Eddystone.
It is said that early in the present century, and
[138]

in a stormy winter of peculiar severity, the light-keepers
were deprived of all communication with the land for a
period of four months. It was in vain that ships were
dispatched towards the rocks; a raging sea invariably prevented
their approach. One of them returned, on a certain
occasion, with the singular intelligence that her crew had
observed a man standing upright and motionless, in a
corner of the outer gallery, with a flag of distress floating
beside him. But whether he was alive or dead, none
could say, or even imagine. Every night the gaze of the
inhabitants of the shore was anxiously directed towards
the lighthouse, to see if the lamp was kindled; and every
night the welcome ray shone punctuallyâa proof that
there was still a keeper at the Smalls. But were the two
guardians living; and if only one, which of the two survived?
The curiosity of all, and the deep anxiety of
some, daily increased, as day after day passed without
further intelligence from the sea-girt rock.

One evening a fisherman of Milford contrived to land
on the lighthouse rock in an interval of calm, and to
carry back to Solva the two keepers; but of the two
one was a corpse. The survivor had made a kind of
shroud for his dead comrade, and afterwards placed him
upright in the gallery, and securely bound him. This he
did to avoid the odour which would have arisen from a
dead body preserved within the lighthouse, and yet to
let it remain for the examination of the surgeons, lest any
suspicion of foul play should attach to him.

[139]

CHAPTER III.

THE BELL ROCK, A.D. 1807â1811.

In
the arts of peace a noble rivalry exists between
the sister kingdoms of Great Britain;
and as England may boast in her Eddystone
tower of a splendid work of science and philanthropy,
and in her Smeaton of an engineer not less remarkable
for genius than resolution, so may Scotland
proudly point to the lighthouse on the Bell Rock as a
national monument, and to her Robert Stevenson as
scarcely inferior to Smeaton in skill and intrepidity.

We have already stated that the charge of lighting
the Scottish coastâwhich, owing to its exposure to
heavy seas and furious winds, to its numerous rocks and
islands and rugged promontories, is one of the most
dangerous in Europe, perhaps in the worldâis intrusted
to a body called the âCommissioners of Northern Lights,â
incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1786. At first the
erection of only
four
lights was contemplated: at Kinnaird
Head, in Aberdeenshire; on the Orkney Islands; on the
Harris Islands; and at the Mull of Kintyre, in Argyleshire.
[140]

But the vast development of the commerce of
Scotland soon called for additional assistance to the navigators
of her waters, and at the present time her shores
are surrounded with a ring of warning lights.

The most ancient public light on the Scottish coast is
that situated on the Isle of May; an island which, like a
natural breakwater, lies off the mouth of the Firth of
Forth, and commands, as it were, the great highway to
the Scotch capital and its prosperous port. It seems to
have been erected at a very early period; and over the
entrance-door of the weather-beaten tower is cut the
figure of the sun, with the date of 1635.

After the Union, very considerable discontent was expressed
by the English and Irish merchants that, for the
maintenance of this beacon, they were charged exactly double
the rate paid by Scottish vessels. They also complained of
the insufficiency of the light, which was simply a coal-fire
exposed in an open chauffer, or brazier. The Edinburgh
Chamber of Commerce taking up the matter, the proprietor
of the light consented to increase its magnitude, and accordingly
enlarged his chauffer to three feet square, doubling
the consumption of coal, which had formerly been about
200 tons per annum. Thenceforth it became the âmost
powerful coal-light in the kingdom;â but, owing to its
exposure, was frequently unsteady in foul weather; and,
moreover, was apt to be confused with the lime-kilns and
accidental fires on the neighbouring coast. The Duke of
Portland had by this time become proprietorâthrough
marriageâof the light and the island; but to repeated
applications that he would substitute an oil-light and reflectors
for the wavering and uncertain coal-fire, he turned
[141]

a deaf ear. At length, on the 19th of December 1810,
two men-of-war were wrecked near Dunbar, in consequence,
it was believed, of a lime-kiln on the Haddingtonshire
coast being mistaken for the Isle of May light.
The Admiralty were thus led to interfere, and, after some
negotiations with the Duke of Portland, an Act of Parliament
was passed in 1814 empowering the Commissioners
of Northern Lights to purchase the island and its
lighthouse for a sum of Â£60,000. The tolls were then
reduced to an uniform scale, a new tower was erected, and
a light on the catoptric system was first exhibited on the
1st of February 1816.

Meanwhile, the progress made in lighting other important
points of the Scottish coast had been considerable.

The lighthouse at Grass Island in Harris was completed
on the 10th of October 1789. On the same date was kindled
a light at North Ronaldshay, in Orkney. In 1790, on the 1st
of October, a light was exhibited at Pladda, a small island
south-west of Arran, in the Firth of Clyde. As a guide
to the Pentland Firth a lighthouse was erected on the
Pentland Skerries in 1794. The Skerries are a couple of
desolate islands, exposed to the stress of the North Sea
and the currents of the Pentland Firth; and the works
here consist of an upper and lower lighthouse, respectively
100 and 80 feet above the sea-level, and 60 feet apart.
They deserve our special notice as the first memorials of
the skill and energy of Robert Stevenson as an engineer.
He was on the spot when the two lights were first exhibited,
October 1, 1794; and, his task completed, sailed
from Orkney on the 9th of October in the sloop
Elizabeth
.
[142]

On the following day he landed within a few miles of
Kinnaird Head lighthouse, and continued his journey to
Edinburgh by road, reaching the capital in safety. A
different fate, however, awaited his former companions;
the sloop having put back to Cromarty Roads, was afterwards
driven to Orkney, and ultimately lost, when all on
board perished.
[31]

We have spoken of a lighthouse erected on North
Ronaldshay in 1789. An experience of twelve years
showed that its position had been unfortunately selected,
and that it by no means assisted the mariner in navigating
the difficult straits of the Orkney archipelago.
Every winter ships were cast away, and precious lives
were lost, on the islands of Stronsay and Sanday, though
the latter is only eight miles distant from North Ronaldshay.
In 1796 three homeward-bound vessels were
lost on this fatal island, and eight more in the next
three years. It was therefore resolved, in 1801, that a
beacon, or tower of masonry, should be erected upon
the Start Point, or eastern extremity of the low shores
of the island of Sanday; and erected in such a manner
that, if found necessary, it might be converted into a
lighthouse.

In 1802 Mr. Stevenson sailed on his annual voyage of
inspection to the Northern Lighthouses, carrying with him
a foreman and sixteen artificers to commence the works on
Start Point. It was the month of April, but, even at this
advanced period of the season, the Orkney Islands were
[143]

found covered to the depth of six inches with snow.
Operations were commenced, however, without a dayâs
delay: a sandstone quarry was opened on the adjacent
island of Edda; and by the middle of May sufficient materials
were collected for the commencement of the edifice.
The foundation-stone was laid, with masonic ceremonies, on
the 15th of May, when an address was delivered by Mr.
Traill, the minister of the parish, some portions of which
may be preserved in these pages:â

âThe moment is auspicious. The foundation-stone is
laid of a building of incalculable value;âa work of use,
not of luxury. Pyramids were erected by the pride of
kings to perpetuate the memory of men whose ambition
enslaved and desolated the world. But it is the benevolent
intention of our Government on this spot to erect a
towerânot to exhaust, butâto increase the wealth and
protect the commerce of this happy kingdom....

âConsider the great national objects for which this
building will be erected. To protect commerce, and to
guard the lives of those intrepid men who for us cheerfully
brave the fury of the waves and the rage of the
battle. The mariner, when he returns to the embraces of
his wife and children, after ascribing praise to the great
Giver of safety, shall bless the friendly light which guided
him over the deep, and recommend to the protection of
Heaven those who urged, who planned, and who executed
the work. This day shall be remembered with gratitude.
It shall be recorded that, at the beginning of a new century,
the pious care of Government was extended to this
remote island. These rocks, so fatal to the most brave
and honourable part of the community, shall lose their
[144]

terror, and safety and life shall spring from danger and
death.â
[32]

By steadily prosecuting the works throughout the
summer, they were brought to a fortunate completion in
the month of September. The beacon rose to a height of
100 feet, and terminated with a massive ball of masonry,
measuring fifteen feet in circumference.

It was found, however, that the construction of this
beacon did not prevent the occurrence of frequent wrecks
upon the island. It was proverbial with its inhabitants
to observe, that if wrecks were to happen, they might as
well be sent to the poor island of Sanday as anywhere else.
In fact, the inhabitants of this and the neighbouring islands
lived upon the proceeds of their wreckage, and melancholy
remains of many a âtall shipâ met the eye in every
direction.

For example, says Mr. Stevenson, although quarries are
to be generally met with in these islands, and the stones
are very suitable for building dykes, yet instances occur of
the land being enclosed, even to a considerable extent,
with ship-timbers. A park
[33]
might be seen paled round,
chiefly with cedar-wood and mahogany from the wreck of
a Honduras-built ship;
[34]
and in one island, after the loss
of a ship laden with wine, the inhabitants took claret to
their barley-meal porridge, instead of their usual beverage.
When Mr. Stevenson complained to one of the pilots of
[145]

the badness of his boatâs sails, he replied, with grim
humour, âHad it been Godâs will that you came na here
wiâ these lights, we might aâ had better sails to our boats,
and more oâ other things.â A much higher rent was
given for the farms than they were absolutely worth, in
consideration of the profits that would probably accrue
from wrecks on their respective shores.

Under these circumstances it was deemed advisable to
convert the North Ronaldshay lighthouse into a beacon,
and the Start Point beacon into a lighthouse, both transformations
being successfully effected in the course of the
year 1805; and the light exhibited on Start Point,
January 1st, 1806.

Continuing our brief chronological resumÃ©, we find that,
for the better navigation of the noble estuary of the Forth,
a lighthouse was erected on the island of Inchkeithâwhich
lies nearly opposite the town of Portobello on the south
shore, and Burntisland on the northâin 1805. Its base
is 175 feet above the sea, and the building itself measures
45 feet in height. The light is a revolving one.

We now come to a description and historical account of
the celebrated lighthouse to which this chapter is more
particularly devoted.

Pharos

loquitur
.

âFar in the bosom of the deep

Oâer these wild shelves my watch I keep,

A ruddy gem of changeful light,

Bound on the dusky brow of Night:

The seaman bids my lustre hail,

And scorns to strike his timorous sail.â

Sir Walter Scott.
[35]

[146]

INCHKEITH LIGHTHOUSE.

The Inch Cape, or Bell Rock, is a âdangerous sunken
reef,â situated on the northern side of the entrance of the
Firth of Forth, at a distance of eleven miles from the promontory
of the Red Head, in Forfarshire; of seventeen
miles from the island of May; and of thirty miles from
St. Abbâs Head, in Berwickshire. Its exact position is in
lat. 56Â° 29Â´ N., and long. 2Â° 22Â´ E. Its extreme length
is estimated by Mr. Stevenson at 1427 feet, and its extreme
breadth at about 30 feet, but its configuration or
margin is extremely irregular. The geological formation
of the rock is a reddish sandstone, which in some places
contains whitish and greenish spots of circular and oval
forms. Its lower portions are covered with various aquatic
plants, such as the great tangle (
fucus digitatus
), and the
badderlock, or hen-ware (
fucus esculentus
); while the
[147]

higher parts are clothed with the smaller fuci, such as

fucus marmillosus
, and
fucus palmatus
, or common dulse.

The name âInch Capeâ occurs in a chart published in
1583, and refers, we suppose, to its situation as an âinch,â
or island, off the Red Head promontory. Its better known
appellation, âthe Bell Rock,â
may
allude to its bell-like
figure, but more probably originated in the circumstance
that a bell with a float was fixed upon it by a former
abbot of Aberbrothock (Arbroath), in such a manner that
it was set in motion by the winds and waves, and by its
deep tones afforded a much-needed warning to navigators
of the dangerous character of the spot.

In connection with this humane deviceâwhose actual
existence there seems no good reason to doubtâan old
tradition has long been current, which Southey embodies
with much picturesque effect in his well-known ballad of
âSir Ralph the Roverâ:â

âNo stir in the air, no stir in the sea,

The ship was still as she could be;

Her sails from heaven received no motion,

Her keel was steady in the ocean.

âWithout either sign or sound of their shock,

The waves flowed over the Inchcape Rock;

So little they rose, so little they fell,

They did not move the Inchcape Bell.

âThe Abbot of Aberbrothok

Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock;

On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung,

And over the waves its warning rung.

âWhen the rock was hid by the surgeâs swell,

The mariners heard the warning bell;

And then they knew the perilous rock,

And blessed the Abbot of Aberbrothok.

âThe sun in heaven was shining gay,

All things were joyful on that day;
[148]

The sea-birds screamed as they wheeled around,

And there was joyaunce in their sound.

âThe buoy of the Inchcape bell was seen,

A darker speck on the ocean green;

Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,

And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.

âHe felt the cheering power of spring,

It made him whistle, it made him sing;

His heart was mirthful to excess,

But the Roverâs mirth was wickedness.

âHis eye was on the Inchcape float;

Quoth he, âMy men, put out the boat,

And row me to the Inchcape Rock,

And Iâll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok.â

âThe boat is lowered, the boatmen row,

And to the Inchcape Rock they go;

Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,

And he cut the bell from the Inchcape float.

âDown sunk the bell with a gurgling sound,

The bubbles rose and burst around;

Quoth Sir Ralph, âThe next who comes to the rock

Wonât bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok.â

âSir Ralph the Rover sailed away,

He scoured the seas for many a day;

And now grown rich with plundered store,

He steers his course for Scotlandâs shore.

âSo thick a haze oâerspreads the sky,

They cannot see the sun on high;

And the wind hath blown a gale all day,â

At evening it hath died away.

âOn the deck the Rover takes his stand,

So dark it is they see no land:

Quoth Sir Ralph, âIt will be lighter soon,

For there is the dawn of the rising moon.â

ââCanst hear,â said one, âthe breakers roar?

For methinks we should be near the shore;â

âNow where we are I cannot tell,

But I wish I could hear the Inchcape bell!â

âThey hear no sound, the swell is strong;

Though the wind hath fallen they drift along,

Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock,â
[149]

âO Christ! it is the Inchcape Rock.â

âSir Ralph the Rover tore his hair,

He curst himself in his despair;

The waves rush in on every side,

The ship is sinking beneath the tide.

âBut even in his dying fear

One dreadful sound could the Rover hear,â

A sound as if with the Inchcape bell

The devil below was ringing his knell.â

It would be difficult to name a position on the Scottish
coast where a lighthouse was more a matter of necessity
for the safety of ships than this long-famous rock. The
beacons which, one after another, had been erected upon it,
the furious waves had swept away; and a structure was
needed not less solid and permanent than that of the
Eddystone. To design such a structure, and to plant it
solidly amid the waves, became, in 1806, the task of Mr.
Robert Stevenson. As the rock was frequently under
water to the depth of twelve feet, the task was scarcely
less difficult than that whose successful achievement has
helped to perpetuate the name and fame of Smeaton.

On the 7th of August 1807 the work was begun. The
first stage was the erection of a wooden workshop and
residence for the artificers, and this apparently simple
operation occupied the whole season, the supports having
to be firmly fixed in holes dug out of the solid rock.
The hardness and compactness of the sandstone, however,
soon blunted their tools, and rendered necessary the constant
employment of a smith with his forge. But it often
happened, says Mr. Stevenson, to our annoyance and disappointment,
in the early state of the work, when the
smith was in the middle of âa favourite heat,â and fashioning
some useful article, or sharpening the tools, after the
flood-tide had compelled the men to strike work, a sea
[150]

would come rolling over the rocks, dash out the fire, and
endanger that indispensable implement, the bellows; or, if
the sea were smooth, while the smith often stood at work
knee-deep in the water, the tide rose imperceptibly, first
cooling the exterior of the fireplace, or hearth, and then
quietly blackening and extinguishing the fire from below.
Mr. Stevenson was frequently amused at the anxiety and
perplexity of the unfortunate smith when coaxing his fire,
and endeavouring in vain to contend against the rising
tide. Obviously the work would go on but slowly, until
the workshop (also intended to serve as a beacon) was
completed, and the smith protected against the insidious
waters.
[36]

Dangers of a far more serious kind also beset the
patient founders of the Bell Rock Lighthouse.

On the 2nd of September, after the first cargo of stones
had been landed, and while thirty-two artificers were
busily occupied in their various departments of labour, a
gale arose, and the attendant vesselânamed the
Smeaton
,
after the great English engineerâbroke adrift from her
moorings. This unfortunate circumstance, at first, was
known only to Mr. Stevenson and his landing-master, who
fully appreciated the gravity of the situationâthirty-two
men on an insulated rock, which, at flood-tide, lay
twelve feet under water, with only two boats at hand, and
these not capable in foul weather of carrying more than
eight men each.

While the artisans were at work, chiefly in sitting and
kneeling postures, excavating the rock, or boring with the
[151]

tools, and while the din of their hammers and the clang
of the smithâs forge filled the air, there was sufficient life
and motion in the scene to keep Stevensonâs mind from
fully realizing the dangers of his position. But by degrees
the water began to rise, and with slowly-swelling
waves it gained upon those engaged in work on the lower
portions of the sites of the beacon and lighthouse. From
the run of the sea upon the rock, the forge-fire was more
quickly extinguished than usual; and the volumes of
smoke having ceased, the men at work could examine
every object around. After having had about three
hoursâ work, the majority began to make towards their
respective boats for their jackets and stockings, when, to
their astonishment, instead of three boats, they found only
two, the third being adrift with the
Smeaton
. Not a word
was uttered, but all appeared to be silently calculating
their numbers, while they gazed from one to another with
dismay and perplexity plainly painted on their countenances.
The landing-master, conceiving that he might be
censured for allowing the boat to quit the rock, remained
at a distance, while Mr. Stevenson placed himself on the
most elevated crag, endeavouring to track the progress of
the
Smeaton
, and surprised that the crew did not cut her
boat adrift, as it greatly retarded her way. The workmen
looked steadfastly upon their engineer, occasionally
turning towards the vessel, which was still far to leeward.

All this took place in the most perfect silence, and the
melancholy solemnity of the scene was such that it produced
an ineffaceable impression on Mr. Stevensonâs mind.

In the meantime the engineer was meditating various
schemes which might be adopted for the general safety of
[152]

the party. The most feasible seemed to be, that as soon
as the waves should reach the highest summit of the rock,
all should disembarrass themselves of their upper garments;
and while a certain number went on board each
boat, the remainder should hang by the gunwales, and the
boats should row gently towards the
Smeaton
, as the

Pharos
, or floating-light, lay too much to the windward
of the rock. Stevenson wished to propose this plan; but,
on attempting to speak, his mouth was so parched that
his tongue refused utterance, and he now learned by experience
that the saliva is as necessary as the tongue itself
for speech. Turning to one of the rock-pools, he lapped
a little water, and obtained immediate relief. But great
was his joy, when, on rising from this unpleasant beverage,
a voice called out, âA boat! a boat!â and, on looking
around, at no great distance a large boat loomed through
the deep, and was evidently making for the rock. She
proved to be a pilot-boat from Arbroath, express with
letters; and willingly taking on board Stevenson and his
company, rescued them from their critical position. In
return for this service, the pilot was pensioned by the
Lighthouse Commissioners in his old age.

On the 6th of September, the whole company on board
of the light-ship, or
Pharos
, was surprised by a tremendous
gale, which prevented them from approaching the rock
for ten days, and exposed them to real danger.

About two oâclock
P.M.
, says Stevenson, a very heavy
sea struck the ship, flooded the deck, and poured into the
berths below. Everybody thought that she had foundered,
and that their last moment had come. Below deck total
[153]

darkness prevailed; several of the artificers were at prayer,
repeating hymns, or uttering devout ejaculations; others
protested that if they should be fortunately spared to
reach land once more, no one would induce them to tempt
the treacherous waves again. Through the confusion
Stevenson made his way upon deck. An astounding
spectacle met his gaze. The billows appeared to be ten
or fifteen feet in height of unbroken water, and each
threatened the little vessel with immediate destruction;
but still, with wonderful buoyancy, she continued to rise
upon the waves, and escape their worst violence.

âOn deck,â we are told,
[37]
âthere was only one solitary
individual looking out to give the alarm, in the event of
the ship breaking from her moorings. The seamen on
watch continued only two hours; he who kept watch at
this time was a tall, slender man of a black complexion;
he had no great-coat nor over-all of any kind, but was
simply dressed in his ordinary jacket and trousers; his
hat was tied under his chin with a napkin, and he stood
aft the foremast, to which he had lashed himself with a
gasket, or small rope round his waist, to prevent his
falling upon deck or being washed overboard. When Mr.
Stevenson looked up he appeared to smile, which afforded
a further symptom of the confidence of the crew in their
ship.â

About six oâclock in the evening the gale abated, and
the sun rose the next morning in a comparatively serene
sky. The waves still rolled very heavily, and at the
Bell Rock they threw up their spray in columns of from
forty to fifty feet in height. When Mr. Stevenson was
[154]

able to visit the rock, he found abundant evidence of their
force: six large blocks of granite had been removed from
their places and flung over a rising ledge into a hole some
twelve or fifteen paces distant. The ash-pan of the
smithâs forge, with its weighty cast-iron back, had also
been washed from their places of supposed security; the
chain of attachment had been broken, and these ponderous
articles were found on the very opposite side of the rock.

Such incidents as these stimulated Stevensonâs desire to
complete the erection of the beacon, which would serve
as a warning to the mariner, and as an asylum for the
artificers on the rock. By dint of persevering exertions,
it was at length completed; and soon afterwards, on the 6th
of October 1807, the works were relinquished for the
season. Though only about one hundred and thirty-three
hours had been actually devoted to them, enough had
been effected to afford an example of what may be accomplished
under similar circumstances, when every heart and
hand labour with conscientious zeal; for the artificers
had wrought at the construction of the beacon as if for
life, or like men stopping a breach in a wall to repress
the inroads of a destroying flood.
[38]

During the winter the men were engaged in quarrying
and preparing the stones, and collecting divers materials.
The stones were laid down in courses in the positions they
would occupy in the future lighthouse; they were then
carefully numbered and marked, bored or fixed with
oaken trenails and stone joggles, after the plan adopted
[155]

by Smeaton in building the Eddystone lighthouse; and in
this state laid aside for trans-shipment to the rock.

The operations of the second season (1808) were
commenced at as early a date as the weather permitted.
A new tender, the
Sir Joseph Banks
, was provided for
the reception of the men when not at work, and as it lay
alongside the rock, protected from the winds, the process
of landing or embarkation was conducted with very great
facility.

The mode in which the different artificers were employed
is thus described by Mr. Stevenson
[39]
:â

[156]

âPreparations having been made for a second forge upon
the beacon, the smiths commenced their operations both
upon the higher and lower platforms, where forges had
been erected. They were employed in sharpening the
picks and irons for the masons, and in making
bats
,
movable cranes, and other apparatus of various descriptions
connected with the railways. The landing-masterâs
crew were occupied in assisting the mill-wrights in laying
the railways to land. Sailors, of all descriptions of men,
are the most accommodating in the use of their hands.
They worked freely with the boring irons, and assisted in
all the operations of the railways, acting by turns as boatmen,
seamen, and artificers. We had no such character
on the Bell Rock as the common labourer. All the
operations of this department were cheerfully undertaken
by the seamen, who, both on the rock and on shipboard,
were the inseparable companions of every work connected
with the erection of the Bell Rock Lighthouse. It will
naturally be supposed, that about twenty-five masons,
occupied with their picks in executing and preparing the
foundation of the lighthouse, in the course of a tide of
about three hours, would make a considerable impression
upon an area even of forty-two feet in diameter. But in
proportion as the foundation was deepened, the rock was
found to be much more hard and difficult to work, while the
baling and pumping of water became much more troublesome.
A joiner was kept almost constantly employed in
fitting the picks to their handles, which, as well as the
points of the irons, were very frequently broken. At
eight oâclock the water overflowed the site of the building,
and the boats left the rock with all hands for breakfast.â

The appearance of the rock at this time was very
curious, and with its effects of light and shade would have
pleased the eye of a Rembrandt. Its surface was thronged
with men; the two forges flamed, one above the other,
like Cyclopean furnaces; while the anvils thundered with
the rebounding clash of their wooden supports, in strange
contrast with the noisy clamour of the ocean-surge.
During the night, if the men were at work, the spectacle
presented to a passing vessel was of the most picturesque
character. To the artificers themselves, the effect of
extinguishing the torches was sometimes startling, and
made terrible the darkness of the night; while the sea,
lit up with a phosphoric glow, rolled in upon the rock
like waves of fire.

As the enterprise proceeded, the smiths were sometimes
left on the beacon throughout the day, and the din of
their anvils formed, in foggy weather, an excellent guide
for the boats. This circumstance confirmed Mr. Stevenson
[157]
âs
opinion as to the propriety of erecting in the lighthouse
large bells to be rung by machinery, and tolled day
and night during the continuance of hazy weather, so as
to prevent the mariner from drawing too near the dangerous
rock.

So much progress had been made in the preliminary
operations by the 10th of July, that on that day it was
determined to lay the foundation-stone. The ceremony
attending it was very simple. Mr. Stevenson, attended
by his three assistants, applied the square, the level, and
the mallet in due form, and pronounced the following
benediction:ââMay the Great Architect of the Universe
complete and bless this building!â Three earnest cheers
were then given, and success to the future operations was
drunk with the greatest enthusiasm.

The first course of masonry was now laid down. It was
only one foot in thickness, yet it contained 508 cubic feet
of granite in outward casing; 8076 cubic feet of Mylnefield
stone in the hearting; 104 tons of solid contents; 132
superficial feet of hewing in the face-work; 4519 superficial
feet of hewing in the beds, joints, and joggles; 420
lineal feet boring of trenail holes; 378 feet lineal cutting
for wedges; 246 oaken trenails; 378 oak wedges in pairs.

By the end of the season the lighthouse was raised to a
level with the highest part of the margin of the foundation-pit,
or about 5Â½ feet above the lower bed of the
foundation-stone. Work was discontinued on the 21st of
September.

Months rolled away, and the third season in due time
[158]

came round. The artificers resumed their building operations,
in 1809, on Saturday, the 27th of May; and in
spite of various accidents and delays, and considerable
obstruction from the inclemency of the weather, had so
far progressed by the end of June as to be able to continue
their labours on the masonry while the rock was under
water. On the 8th of July, it was remarked, with no
small demonstrations of joy, that the tide (a neap one)
ceased for the first time to overflow the building at high-water.
Flags were accordingly hoisted at every vantage-point,
as well as on board the yacht, the tender, the stone-praams,
and the floating light; a salute of three guns
was fired; and, we need hardly say, the loudest and
heartiest cheers pealed through the air and mingled with
the music of the waves.

It is unnecessary to follow, step by step, the operations
of Stevenson and his âundaunted band.â Such details
would possess no interest for the general reader; but he
will understand how great must have been the skill and
perseverance of the engineer, how arduous the industry of
all engaged, when we record that by the 25th of August
the solid part of the building had been raised to the
height of 31Â½ feet above the rock, and of 17 feet above
high-water of spring tides.

Having during two seasons landed and built up more
than one thousand four hundred tons of stone, while the
work was low down in the water, and before the beacon
had been rendered inhabitable, and as not more than seven
hundred tons were required to complete the masonry, Mr.
Stevenson had good reason to conclude that another season

[161]
would consummate his enterprise. But the success of
the work absolutely depending on the stability of the
beacon, he paid frequent visits to the rock in the course of
the winter, to see that it braved unhurt the fury of winds
and waves.

THE BUILDING OF THE BELL ROCK LIGHTHOUSE.

The operations of the fourth and last season were commenced
on the 10th of May. The artificers took permanent
possession of the beacon, which consisted at this
time of three floorsâone occupied as the cook-house and
provision store; the second divided into two cabins, one
for the engineer and the other for the foreman; and the
third provided with three rows or tiers of beds, capable of
accommodating about thirty men. Below these three
floors was a temporary floor, at the height of twenty-five
feet above the rock, used for preparing mortar, and for
the smithâs workshop. The beacon was connected with
the lighthouse by a bridge of timber.

The apartment which Mr. Stevenson himself occupied
he has described in characteristic language.

It measured, he says, not more than four feet three
inches in breadth on the floor; and though, from the
oblique direction of the beams of the building, it widened
towards the top, yet it did not admit of the full extension
of his arms when he stood on the floor; while its
length was little more than sufficient for suspending a cot-bed
during the night. This was tied up to the roof during
the day, leaving free room for the admission of occasional
visitants. His folding-table was attached with hinges immediately
under the small window of the apartment, and
his boots, barometer, thermometer, portmanteau, and two
or three camp-stools, formed the bulk of his movables. His
[162]

diet being plain, the paraphernalia of the table were proportionately
simple; though everything had the appearance
of comfort, and even of neatness, the walls being covered
with green cloth, formed into panels with red tape, and
his bed festooned with curtains of yellow cotton-stuff. If,
in speculating upon the abstract wants of man in such a
seclusion, one were reduced to a single book, the Sacred
Volume, whether considered for the striking diversity of
its story, the morality of its doctrines, or the important
truths of its gospel, would have proved by far the greatest
treasure.

In the early part of July, a visit was paid to the works
by Mrs. Dickson, the only daughter and surviving relative
of Smeaton, the great engineer. She was conveyed
to the rock on board the
Smeaton
tender, which had been
so named by Stevenson from a sense of the deep obligation
he owed to the labours and abilities of his predecessor.
It is unnecessary to say that she was exceedingly
gratified by her visit.

Passing over the daily details of the work, we arrive at
the 29th of July, as one of the epoch days of the undertaking.
The
last stone
was landed on the Bell Rock, and
you may be sure such an occasion was duly celebrated.
On the 30th, the
last course
(the 90th) of the building
was laid, finishing the exterior wall, and the engineer then
solemnly pronounced a suitable benediction:
[163]
âMay the
Great Architect of the Universe, under whose blessing this
perilous work has prospered, preserve it as a guide to
the mariner!â

BELL ROCK LIGHTHOUSE.

With the minute particulars recorded by Stevenson of
the completion of the interior of the building, it is needless
to weary the reader. Their technicalities would puzzle
him, and in their prolonged detail we can find nothing to
excite his interest. He will understand that Stevenson
neglected nothing which could ensure the safety and
efficiency of his structure, and on the 17th of December
1810, the following advertisement intimated to the public
that his enterprise had been successful, and that thenceforth
[164]

the perils of the Bell Rock would virtually cease to
exist:â

âA lighthouse having been erected upon the Inch
Cape, or Bell Rock, situated at the entrance of the Firths
of Forth and Tay, in north latitude 56Â° 29Â´ and west
longitude 2Â° 22Â´,âThe Commissioners of the Northern
Lighthouses hereby give notice, that the light will be from
oil, with reflectors, placed at the height of about 108 feet
above the medium level of the sea. The light will be
exhibited on the night of Friday, the 1st day of February
1811, and each night thereafter, from the going away of
daylight in the evening until the return of daylight in the
morning. To distinguish this light from others on the
coast, it is made to revolve horizontally, and to exhibit a
bright light of the natural appearance, and a red-coloured
light alternately, both respectively attaining their greatest
strength, or most luminous effect, in the space of every
four minutes; during that period the bright light will, to
a distant observer, appear like a star of the first magnitude,
which after attaining its full strength is gradually
eclipsed to total darkness, and is succeeded by the red-coloured
light, which in like manner increases to full
strength, and again diminishes and disappears. The
coloured light, however, being less powerful, may not be
seen for a time after the bright light is first observed.
During the continuance of foggy weather, and showers of
snow, a bell will be tolled by machinery, night and day,
at intervals of half a minute.â

It was found that this light could be clearly seen and
recognized, in fair weather, at a distance of seven
leagues.

[165]

The Bell Rock Lighthouse, thus happily completed, is
a circular building, 42 feet in diameter at the base, and
13 feet at the top. The masonry is 100 feet high, and
the whole structure, including the light-room, 115 feet.
From the entrance door, a circular stair leads to the first
apartment, which is used as a store-room. Wooden steps
ascend to the other apartments, which are appropriated to
the light-keepers, and to the appurtenances of the lighting
apparatus. The light-room, which is formed of cast
iron, and glazed with polished glass, is octagonal in shape,
12 feet in diameter, and 15 feet in height. It is covered
with a dome, and terminates in a ball.

The manner in which this noble structure braves the
assault of waters has been graphically described by Mr.
Stevenson. It is during the winterâs storms, he says, and
when viewed from the Forfarshire coast, that it appears in
one of its most interesting aspects, standing proudly
among the waves, while the sea around it is in the
wildest state of agitation. The light-keepers do not seem
to be in motion, but the scene is by no means still, as the
clang and clamour, the motion and fury of the waves, are
incessant. The seas rise in the most surprising fashion
to the height of about seventy feet above the rock, and
after expending their force in a perpendicular direction,
fall in foaming masses round the base of the lighthouse,
while considerable portions of the spray seem to adhere,
as it were, to the building, and gather down its sides in
the condition of froth as white as snow. Some of the
great waves burst and are expended upon the rock before
they reach the lighthouse; while others strike the base,
and embracing the walls, meet on the western side, where
[166]

the violent collision churns the eddying waters into the
wildest foam.

The management of the Bell Rock lighthouse is provided
for as follows:âThe nearest town is Arbroath,
about eleven miles distant, where a cutter called the

Pharos
is stationed as the lighthouse tender. Once a
fortnight, or in the course of each set of spring-tides, she
visits the rock, to relieve the light-keepers and replenish
their store of provisions and fuel. The keepers are four
in number, three of whom are always on duty, while one
is ashore. If the weather be favourable, each light-keeper
is six weeks on the rock, and a fortnight on land with his
family. The pay is from Â£50 to Â£60 per annum, with a
stated allowance of bread, beef, butter, oatmeal, vegetables,
and small beer, and fourpence a day extra for tea. A suit
of uniform is also provided once in three years.

The watches in the light-room are relieved with as much
punctuality as on board a man-of-war, no keeper being
allowed to leave until his successor presents himself, under
the penalty of immediate dismissal. To ensure the strictest
regularity in this respect, a timepiece is placed in each light-room,
and bells are hung in the bed-rooms of the dwelling-houses,
which, being connected by mechanical appliances
with the lighthouse, can be rung as necessity requires.

At Arbroath, as at other stations, the light-keepersâ
dwellings are very neatly built and comfortably arranged,
each having its little garden attached. There are also
suitable storehouses provided, a room for the master and
crew of the lighthouse tender, and a signal-tower fifty feet
high, on whose summit a small observatory is erected,
[167]

with an excellent achromatic telescope, a flag-staff, and a
copper signal-ball measuring eighteen feet in diameter.
A similar ball crowns the lighthouse dome, and by these
means daily signals are exchanged, to signify that all is
well. Should the ball at the top be allowed to remain
down, as is the case when particular supplies are needed,
or either of the light-keepers have been seized with illness,
assistance is immediately dispatched in the tender.

The total cost of the lighthouse, of the buildings at
Arbroath, of the tender, and the first yearâs stores, was
Â£61,350.

A curious accident is recorded in connection with the
lighthouse as having occurred on the 9th of February
1832, about ten oâclock
P.M.

A large herring-gull flew against one of the south-eastern
mullions of the light-room with so much violence
that two of the polished plates of glass, measuring each
about two feet square and a quarter of an inch thick, were
dashed to atoms, and scattered over the floor, to the great
alarm of the keeper on watch, and of his two associates,
who rushed instantly into the light-room. It happened,
fortunately, that although one of the red-shaded sides of
the reflector-frame was passing in its revolution at the
moment, the fragments were so minute that no injury was
done to the valuable red glass. The gull was found to
measure five feet from tip to tip of its expanded wings.
A large herring was found in its gullet, and in its throat
a piece of plate glass about an inch in length.
[40]

Before quitting the subject of the Bell Rock Lighthouse,
it is desirable we should refer to another of Mr.
[168]

Stevensonâs achievements, the Beacon on the Carr rock.
The Carr is the seaward extremity of a sunken reef, visible
only at low water, which extends about two miles from
the shore of Fifeness, on the northern side of the mouth
of the Forth estuary. Its position is unusually dangerous,
as it lies in the track of shipping ascending and descending
Scotlandâs great eastern river. In the course of nine
years it proved fatal to no fewer than sixteen vessels.
As all attempts had failed to mark its position by a floating
buoy, the authorities resolved to erect a beacon of
masonry upon it, and in 1813 the difficult work was commenced
under Mr. Stevensonâs direction. The dimensions
of the Carr are only 23 feet in breadth by 15 feet in
length, and it was impossible, therefore, to obtain a base
for a building of greater diameter than 18 feet.

Five seasons were spent in the erection of the beacon,
so many were the obstacles which the workmen had to
conquer, especially from the prevalence of rolling seas and
stormy winds. In the fifth year, when the whole of the
masonry had been completed, a November hurricane swept
away the upper part of the structure. A modification of
the original design was then adopted; and on the courses
of masonry left intact by wind and waves six columns of
cast iron were planted, terminating in a cast iron ball of
three feet in diameter, which rose about twenty-five feet
above the average sea-level. The whole was completed
in the sixth season (September 1821).
[41]

The Carr rock is about six miles north-north-east of
the Isle of May lighthouse, and twelve miles south-west
of the Bell Rock.

[169]

In a recent pamphlet,
[42]
Mr. Thomas Stevenson, the engineer
to the Board of Northern Lightsâwho has an
hereditary as well as an individual claim to be heard on
all matters of this kindâhas suggested various modes of
lighting beacons and buoys. As he observes, the importance
of raising them to the rank of illuminated night-marks
must be apparent to all who know anything of
coast navigation; and he is certainly justified in thinking
that the subject is worthy of more attention than has
hitherto been given to it.

He speaks, in the first place, of
apparent
or
borrowed
lights
, where a ray is thrown on a buoy or beaconâas in
the case of the Arnish Rock, referred to on page 274,âfrom
a neighbouring lighthouse. The only other existing
example of an apparent light is to be found at the harbour
of Odessa, in the Black Sea. It was constructed in 1866,
and is situated three hundred feet from the shore.

Mr. Stevensonâs next suggestion applies to
dipping lights
for sunk rocks
, where it would be difficult or impossible to
erect a beacon for containing the necessary optical apparatus.
Here he would so arrange the lamp and reflectors of the lighthouse
as to dip vertically, and thus project a cone of rays
upon the sea for a considerable area round the secret danger.
On seeing the illuminated wave-space the mariner would
alter his course, and give the sunken rock a âwide berth.â

The other methods proposed by Mr. Stevenson are:â

The conduction either of voltaic, magnetic, or frictional
electricity, singly or combined, to the buoy or beacon,
through wires, submarine, or, where practicable, suspended
in the air, so as to produce a spark either with or without
[170]

vacuum tubes, or by means of an electro-magnet and the
deflagration of mercury.

The conduction of gas from the shore in submarine pipes.

Self-acting electrical apparatus, produced by the action
of sea-water or otherwise at the beacon itself, so as to require
no connection with the shore.

And, finally, Mr. Stevenson recommends different applications
of sound, so as to produce distinct and powerfully
audible warnings during the prevalence of a thick fog or
mist:â

The propagation of sound during fogs through pipes
communicating with the shore,
[43]
or the origination of sound
at the beacon or buoy itself, by condensing the column of air,
or by acting on a column of water contained in the pipe.

Bells rung by electricity. Mr. Wilde, of Manchester,
states that bells twelve or eighteen inches in diameter,
placed on different beacons, and as far off as ten miles from
the shore, could be tolled a hundred times a-minute by
means of a three and a half or four inch electro-magnetic
machine worked by an engine of about two-horse power.

And, finally, bells may be rung by the simple pressure
of the waves through the agency of a float, which would
sink or rise according as the tide sunk or rose. This was
proposed for the beacon at the Carr Rock by the late Mr.
Stevenson in 1810.

By the adoption of one or other of these suggestions,
according to the conditions of the locality, there can be no
doubt that the subsidiary illumination of our shores and their
contiguous waters would be very considerably improved.

[171]

CHAPTER IV.

THE SKERRYVORE LIGHTHOUSE.

The
full details which we have given of the
erection of the Bell Rock Lighthouse will
render unnecessary any elaborate account of
the mode of construction of later edifices.
There are some, however, which we are unwilling to pass
over without at least a cursory notice, owing either to
their romantic position or to their special interest as
examples of engineering skill. One of the most important
of these is the Lighthouse of the Skerryvore, situated on a
reef which, in all leading features, is a counterpart of the
Bell Rock. It is placed in the same parallel of latitude,
and occupies the identical position on the west coast of
Scotland which the latter occupies on the eastern. Nor
was it of old less fatal or less ominous to the mariner, but
annually exacted its tribute of precious lives and wrecked
vessels. A few minutes sufficed for the total loss of any
unfortunate ship which dashed against the gneiss crags of
the Skerryvore, and its rent and shattered timbers were
quickly carried by the tide to the fishermen of the island of
Tyree. Not that this formidable memorial of past volcanic
[172]

convulsions was totally submergedâsome of its
higher points rose above the level of the highest tides:
but the extent of its foundations was considerable; and
even in the summer season latent dangers beset the difficult
channel between its eastern extremity and the island
of Tyree, which lies about eleven miles distant.
[44]

For various reasons the attention of the Commissioners
of Northern Lights had been early directed to this formidable
reef; and in 1814 they had determined to mark its
locality by the erection of a lighthouse. It was visited in
this same year by some of the members of the Commission,
accompanied by one whose name alone is sufficient to
render the visit ever memorableâSir Walter Scott. He
was much struck with the desolateness of the situation,
which he thought infinitely surpassed that of the Bell
Rock or the Eddystone.

Owing, perhaps, to the difficulty of the enterprise, it
was deferred until the autumn of 1834, when Mr. Alan
Stevenson was authorized to commence a preliminary
inspection, which he did not complete until 1835. This
difficulty proceeded not only from the position, but from
the nature of the reef itself.

It is true that the distance from the mainland was three
miles less in the case of Skerryvore than in that of the
Bell Rock; but the barren and over-populated island of
Tyree did not offer the resources of the eastern coast,
nor a safe and commodious port like that of Arbroath.
The engineers were therefore compelled to erect, at the
nearest and most favourable point of Tyree, a quay and a
small harbour, with temporary cabins for the workmen, and
[173]

storehouses of every kind; all whose materials, excepting
only stoneâand even the supply of
that
failed after
awhileârequired to be transported from distant parts.

The first and most embarrassing, perhaps, of the numerous
questions which present themselves to the engineer
when entering upon the construction of a lighthouse, are
those of the
height
and the
mass
. In the days of Smeaton,
when the best light in use was that of common candles,
the elevation beyond a certain point could not be of any
utility; while in 1835 the application of the reflector and
the lens, by assisting in the extension and diffusion of the
light, rendered, on the contrary, a considerable elevation
both necessary and desirable.

It was therefore decided that the height of the Skerryvore
should be 135 feet above the highest tides, so as to
command a horizon visible for a radius of eighteen miles.
The diameter of the base was fixed at 42 feet, and that of
the topmost story at 16 feet; consequently the masonry
of the tower would be double that of the Bell Rock, and
four and a half times that of the Eddystone.

Another peculiarity distinguishes the Skerryvore from
the Bell Rock. The sandstone of the latter is wave-worn,
and broken up into a thousand rugged inequalities:
the action of the sea on the igneous formation of the
Skerryvore has, on the contrary, communicated to it the
appearance and polish of a mass of dark-coloured crystal.
It is so compact and smooth that the foreman of the
masons, when he landed on it, said it was like climbing
up the neck of a bottle. Moreover, notwithstanding its
durability, the gneiss of Skerryvore is excavated into
caverns, which considerably limit the area adapted for
[174]

building operations. One of these caverns, we are told, terminates
in a narrow spherical chamber, with an upper opening;
through which, from time to time, springs a bright,
luminous shaft of water, 20 feet high, and white as snow,
except when the sun wreathes it with a thousand rainbows.

Mr. Alan Stevenson commenced actual operations in
1838 by the erection of a provisional barrack on piles, at
such a height as to be beyond the reach of all average
tides. This was designed to shelter the men at night,
saving them the voyage to and from the mainland; and
also to accommodate them when their work was suspended
by bad weather. The first erection was swept away in a
great gale on the night of November 3; but happily the
labours of the season were then ended, and there were no
occupants. On this occasion the grindstone was deposited
in a hole 36 feet deep; the iron anvil was transported
13 yards from the place where it had been left; the iron
stanchions were bent and twisted like corkscrews; and,
finally, a stone weighing half a hundred-weight, lying at
the bottom of an excavation, was carried to the highest surface
of the rock.

Conquering all feelings of discouragement, Mr. Stevenson,
in the following year, renewed his operations. A second
barrack was completed by the 3rd of September. It was
built of timber, and consisted of three stories: the first was
appropriated as a kitchen; the second divided into two
cabins, one for the engineer and one for the master of the
works; and the third belonged to the thirty workmen
engaged in the erection of the lighthouse.

[175]

A more remarkable habitation than this was never
dwelt in by human beings. It was an oasis in a wide
waste of watersâa rude asylum suspended between sea
and sky. Perched forty feet above the wave-beaten crag,
Mr. Stevenson, with a goodly company of thirty men,
in this singular abode, spent many a weary day and night
at those times when the sea prevented a descent to the
rock; anxiously looking for supplies from the shore, and
earnestly longing for a change of weather favourable to
the recommencement of the works. For miles around
nothing could be seen but white foaming breakers, and
nothing heard but howling winds and lashing waves.

In the erection of the lighthouse itself, the first important
operation, and one which occupied the whole of the
season of 1839âfrom the 6th of May to the 30th of Septemberâwas
the excavation of a suitable foundation.
When building the Eddystone, Mr. Smeaton had been
compelled to take into consideration the peculiar structure
of the rock, and to adapt his lower courses of masonry, as
we have seen, to a series of gradually ascending terraces
formed by the successive ledges of the rock itself. This
difficult and expensive process was rendered unnecessary
by the geodesical formation of the Skerryvore. Mr. Stevenson,
therefore, began work by hollowing out a base of
forty feet diameterâthe largest area he could obtain without
any change of level. This portion of his enterprise
occupied twenty men for two hundred and seventeen days;
two hundred and ninety-six charges of gunpowder were
made use of; and two thousand tons of dÃ©bris and refuse
were cast into the sea. The mining or blasting operations
[176]

were not carried on without great difficulty, on account of
the absence of any shelter for the miners, who were unable
to retire more than ten or twelve paces, at the furthest,
from the spot where the charge was fired. The quantities
of gunpowder, therefore, were measured with the utmost
nicety; a few grains too many, and the whole company of
engineers and workmen would have been blown into the
air. Mr. Stevenson himself generally fired the train, or it
was done under his superintendence and in his presence;
and from the precautions suggested by his skill and prudence,
happily no accident occurred.

During the first month of their residence in the barrack,
he informs us
[45]
that he and his men suffered much inconvenience
from the inundation of their apartments. On
one occasion, moreover, they were a fortnight without
receiving any communication from the mainland, or from
the steam-tug attached to the works; and during the
greater part of this time they saw nothing but white
plains of foam spreading as far as the eye could reach,
and the only sounds were the whistling of the wind and
the thunderous roar of the billows, which ever and anon
swelled into such a tumult that it was almost impossible
to hear one another speak. We may well conceive that a
scene so awful, with the ruins of their first barrack lying
within a few feet of them, was calculated to fill their
minds with the most discouraging apprehensions. Mr.
Stevenson records, in simple but graphic language, the
indefinite sensations of terror with which he was aroused
one night when a tremendous wave broke against the
timber structure, and all the occupants of the chamber
[177]

beneath him involuntarily uttered a terrible cry. They
sprang from their beds in the conviction that the whole
building had been precipitated to the depths of ocean.

Up to the 20th of June no materials had been landed
on the rock but iron and timber; next arrived the great
stones, all ready cut and hewn, and weighing not less than
eight hundred tons. But the disembarkation of these very
essential supplies entailed serious risks, which were renewed
with every block, for the loss of a single one would have
delayed the works. At length the foundation-stone was
fixed in its place; the Duke of Argyle presiding over the
ceremony, accompanied by his duchess, his daughter, and
a numerous retinue.

The summer of 1840 was a summer of tempests. Nevertheless,
in the midst of incessant fears, and dangers, and
wearying accidents, and every kind of privation, the devoted
band of workers prosecuted their noble enterprise;
and such, says Mr. Stevenson, was their profound sense of
dutyâsuch the desire of every one that full and complete
success should crown their effortsâthat not a man expressed
a wish to retreat from the battle-field where he was exposed
to so many enemies.

SKERRYVORE LIGHTHOUSE.

The dayâs occupations were thus divided. At half-past
three in the morning they were awakened, and from four
oâclock to eight they laboured without a pause; at eight
they were allowed half an hour for dinner. Work was
then resumed, and continued for seven or eight, or, if it
were very urgent, even for nine hours. Next came supper,
which was eaten leisurely and comfortably in the cool of
the evening. This prolonged toil produced a continual
[178]

sleepiness, so that those who stood still for any time invariably
fell off into a profound slumber; which, adds Mr.
Stevenson, frequently happened to himself during breakfast
and dinner. Several times, also, he woke up, pen
in hand, with a word begun on the page of his diary.
Life, however, on the desert rock of the Skerryvore seems
not to have been without its peculiar pleasures. The
grandeur of oceanâs angry outburstsâthe hoarse murmur
of the watersâthe shrill harsh cries of the sea-birds who
incessantly hovered round themâthe splendour of a sea
polished like a mirrorâthe glory of a cloudless skyâthe
solemn silence of azure nights, sometimes sown thick with
[179]

stars, sometimes illuminated by the full moon,âwere
scenes of a panorama as novel as it was wonderful, and
which could not fail to awaken thought even in the dullest
and most indifferent minds. Consider, tooâwhen we think
of Mr. Stevenson and his devoted companyâthe continual
emotions which they experienced of hope and anxiety;
the necessity, on the part of their leader, of incessant
watchfulness, and of readiness of resource to grapple with
every difficulty; the gratification with which each man
regarded the gradual growth, under his laborious hands,
of a noble and beneficent work; and we think the reader
will admit that life upon the Skerryvore, if it had its troubles
and its perils, was not without its rewards and happiness.

In July 1841 the masonry had been carried to an elevation
which rendered impossible the further employment
of the stationary crane. As a substitute the balance crane
was introducedâthat beautiful machine, invented at the
Bell Rock, which rises simultaneously with the edifice it
assists to raise.

Thanks to this new auxiliary, the mass of masonry
completed in the season of 1841 amounted to 30,000
cubic feet, more than double the mass of the Eddystone,
and exceeding that of the Bell Rock lighthouse. Such
was the delicate precision observed in the previous shaping
and fitting of the stones, that after they had been regularly
fixed in their respective places, the diameter of each
course did not vary one-sixth of an inch from the prescribed
dimensions, and the height was only one inch more
than had been determined by the architect in his previous
calculations.

[180]

On the 21st of July, the steamer saluted with its one gun
the disembarkation of the last cargo of stones intended for
the lighthouse. On the 10th of August the lantern arrived,
which was hauled up to its position, and duly fixed; a temporary
shelter from the weather being also erected for it.

The summer of 1843 was devoted to pointing the external
masonryâa wearisome operation, conducted by
means of suspended scaffoldsâand to the completion of
the internal arrangements. And at length, on the 1st of
February 1844, the welcome light of the Skerryvore pharos
blazed across the waters of the stormy sea.

The illuminating apparatus adopted was the dioptric,
and identical in all respects with the apparatus supplied
a few years before to the Tower of Cordova. It is a revolving
light, whose full brilliancy is apparent only once
in a minute. Elevated 150 feet above the sea level, it is
visible at a distance of eighteen miles.

Such is the stirring history of the Skerryvore lighthouse.
The reader will think, perhaps, that it differs but little from
that of the Bell Rock and the Eddystone. Nevertheless we
could not pass over it in silence, for it completed a work
which may fitly be called âthe art of building lighthouses
in the open seaââan art entirely unknown before the days
of Smeaton, and Robert and Alan Stevensonâthree men
of whom Ocean, if it could translate into words the
ârhythmical smileâ of its summer calm, or the harsher
accents of its equinoctial wrath, might say with the poet,â

âGreat I must call them, for they conquered me!â

[181]

CHAPTER V.

NORTH UNST, 1854.âSUNDERLAND, 1841.

The
erection of the North Unst tower, completed
in 1854, offered no difficulties comparable to
those which tested the skill and perseverance
of the builder of the Bell Rock; yet, not the
less, it is interesting as one of the most important results
obtained by our English engineers. As our illustration shows,
it stands rooted on an isolated reef, near the Shetland Isles,
whose elevation above the sea is estimated at 200 feet.

Its northern front is almost perpendicular, and exposed
to the most violent assaults of Ocean; on the south the
declivity is less abrupt, but scarcely easier of access; and
its summit is only of breadth sufficient to receive the
foundation of the tower. This is 50 feet in height, and
contains, besides the light-room, a sleeping chamber, a
kitchen, and a store-room. At its base is built an additional
store-room for the supplies of oil, charcoal, and fresh
water. It is only accessible in fine weather.

The North Unst lighthouse is provided with a staff of
four keepers, whose habitations are situated on the island
of Unst (one of the Shetland group), about four miles distant.

[182]

It has justly been said that one of the strangest operations
recorded in the history of lighthouses is, undoubtedly,
the work undertaken and successfully accomplished at
Sunderland in 1841. Some important improvements had
been effected in its harbour; and a jetty had been constructed
which rendered useless the old pier, and the lighthouse
built upon it. Consequently, preparations were
made for the demolition of the latter. An engineer, of
the name of Murray, however, conceived the idea of transporting
the monument, in one piece, to the intended site
of the new lighthouse, a distance of about 475 feet. His
proposal was favourably received; for the removal of great
masses of masonry, in Europe at least, is an enterprise
which always excites a very general curiosity. In the
United States, that âgo-aheadâ land of bold projects
and daring inventions, such enterprises are more frequent,
and the process has been several times applied to houses
(as recently at Chicago) and factories, for which it was
desirable to secure a more convenient or a securer site.
In such cases a series of openings is made in the walls,
and through these openings beams are introduced, united
together by cross beams so as to form a kind of flooring;
then the lowest part of the base of the walls is destroyed,
leaving the building to rest upon the timber platform,
which is afterwards set in motion by a system of grooves.

NORTH UNST LIGHTHOUSE.

So far as concerned the Sunderland lighthouse, the
enterprise was much more arduous; for its narrow base
supported a burden relatively more considerable than that
of a house, and one which apparently must crush all
machines interposed between it and the ground. The
weight of the lighthouse was 757,000 lbs.; it consisted

[185]
of an octagonal tower 64 feet high, and 15 feet in diameter
at the base. We must add that the new pier was 19
inches higher than the old, and that its direction was
entirely different; which rendered it necessary that the
building should be turned upon its axis, at the same time
that it had to traverse a broken line, one of whose sections,
from north to south, measured 28 feet, and the other, from
west to east, 447 feet.

The accompanying illustration will afford an idea of
the manner in which this difficult engineering problem
was solved. By means of a series of openings made in
the base of the tower, as above described, the latter was
raised on a solid platform of oaken planks; while it was
surrounded from base to summit by a framework of stays
or props, strengthened by cross beams. The platform
rested on one hundred and forty-four cast-iron wheels,
grooved like those of a locomotive, and running on eight
parallel rails, likewise of cast-iron, which, with their
âsleepers,â were laid along the masonry of the pier and
jetty. When the mass had moved a few feet, the rails
were lifted, and laid down again in front of the machinery,
and this process was repeated until the new site of the
lighthouse was reached. Iron chains attached to the platform
were wound upon windlasses, worked by a band of
sturdy labourers.

The various stages of the operation were accomplished
in thirteen hours and twenty-four minutes. The combined
efforts of forty men were required for five hours to
carry the apparatus over the 28 feet of the first section,
while eighteen men sufficed to carry it in eight hours and
twenty-four minutes over the 447 feet of the second.

[186]

In this latter part the rails were at first laid down on
a curve, so as to bring the pharos into a symmetrical
position with the jetty, then it advanced parallel to itself,
following a slightly inclined plane. It was prevented by
wedges from deviating during this ascent from a perpendicular
line. The object of this twofold disposition was
to veer the pharos round, and to raise it to a higher levelâwhich,
as we have seen, was an indispensable condition.
The removal was eventually accomplished with so much
success, and so little interruption to the business of the
harbour, that the lamp was lighted in the evening at the
usual hour.

[187]

TRANSPORTING A LIGHTHOUSEâSUNDERLAND.

[189]

CHAPTER VI.

LIGHTHOUSES ON THE ENGLISH COAST.

We
propose, in the present chapter, to glance at
a few of the best known pharoses which illuminate
our home-waters, but without observing
any particular order. Our description of
each will be brief, for it is needless to say that, as a rule,
lighthouses closely resemble one another in their principles
of construction as in their general arrangements, and
that the differences between them are simply matters of
detail.

Upon
Needles Point
, the westernmost extremity of the
Isle of Wight, at an elevation of 474 feet, a lighthouse
was erected early in the last century. Notwithstanding
its great height, it is recorded that its windows were sometimes
shattered by stones flung up by the mounting and
raging billows.
[46]
It had ten Argand lamps, and the
same number of plated reflectors; and its light, on clear
and cloudless nights, was visible at a distance of eleven
leagues. Seven hundred gallons of oil, we are told, were
[190]

consumed annually; and in stormy nights the blaze attracted
hundreds of small birds, which dashed themselves
against the glass reflectors, and were killed.

NEEDLES LIGHTHOUSE.

Owing to its great elevation, however, this lighthouse
was of little service in hazy and foggy weather. The
Trinity House, therefore, in 1859, caused a new one to be
constructed on the outer part of the farthest of the celebrated
chalk rocks, called the Needles, which was previously
cut down and levelled almost to the waterâs edge.
[191]

This lighthouse is about 109 feet in height from the base
to the top of the ball, and possesses only one light, with
three concentrated wicks, whose brilliancy, however, is so
great that it can be seen fourteen miles at sea. The shades
are alternately white and red. A fog bell is rung by
mechanical agency during stormy weather; its sounds
may be heard at a distance of five miles. The base of the
building is 38 feet in diameter.

Near the south shore of the Isle of Wight rises the
remarkable and picturesque eminence of
St. Catherineâs
Hill
, 769 feet above the level of the sea. It looks down
upon the rock-bound sweep of Chale Bay, which has been
the scene of many deplorable catastrophes. From its
summit the traveller commands a prospect of singular
beauty, as remarkable for its extent as for its variety;
since it not only includes by far the larger part of the
âgarden-isle,â but the green masses of the New Forest,
the blue line of the misty Hampshire hills, and the undulating
range of the coast of Sussex as far as the bold
bluff promontory of Beachy Head. It is said that, in an
opposite direction, the high lands about Cherbourg have
occasionally been seen. On a calm, clear day the island
lies at your feet like an open map, and you can trace each
bare bold hill; each valley, dusky with its wealth of
foliage; each village church and manor-house, girt with
venerable trees; each distant town, with its floating
canopy of smoke; each stream that trails like a silver
snake through the emerald pastures; and all around and
about, the mighty ocean, heaving with a flood of glorious
light.

[192]

On the lofty summit of this hill, one Walter de Godyton,
in 1323, erected a chantry, and dedicated it to St. Catherine,
who, in the Roman Hagiology, is the invariable patroness
of hills and mountains. He also provided an endowment
for a priest, who should chant masses, and keep up a
burning light through the hours of darkness, for the safety
of mariners approaching this dangerous coast. This duty
was regularly performed until the suppression of the minor
religious houses, when the priest and his endowment disappeared;
though the chantry, built of solid masonry,
remained, and is still to be inspected by the curious.
Many years ago it was carefully repaired, in consideration
of its value as a landmark. The foundation of the whole
chapel was then cleared and levelled, a process revealing
not only its ground-plan, but also the floor and stone
hearth of the priestâs little cell at the south-west corner.
Its height is 35 feet 6 inches; its form, octagonal.

Almost adjoining stands the shell of a lighthouse
erected in 1785 by the Trinity Board; but discontinued
when it was discovered, as might at the outset have been
surmised, that the mists so often gathering about the
crown of the hill would render it of little service.

The dangerous character of the coast, however, was so
widely known, that the Trinity Board felt it necessary to
provide for its better protection, and in 1838 a lighthouse
was commenced on
St. Catherineâs Point
, at the base of
the hill, which was completed in 1840, and lighted for
the first time on the 25th of March. Its dimensions are:âFrom
the water-mark to the level of terrace, 81 feet.
From the terrace to the top of the stone-work, 100 feet.
Height of lantern and pedestal, 1 foot 6 inches. Extension
[193]

of glass frame, 10 feet. Roof, ball, vane, and
lightning conductor, 11Â½ feet. Height of tower, 122 feet.
The diameter of the interior is 14 feet; and the staircase
to the lantern-room numbers one hundred and fifty-two
steps. The illuminating apparatus consists of one lamp,
3Â½ inches diameter, with four concentrated wicks, reflected
through a lens surmounted by two hundred and
fifty mirrors.

St. Catherineâs lighthouse is a graceful structure, and
the visitor, comparing it with the rude chantry on the
brow of the hill, where the solitary priest muttered his
orisons and fed his flickering fire, will obtain a vivid conception
of the vast strides made by practical science in
five centuries.

A graphic writer
[47]
describes the extreme south-western
point of England, the Landâs End, in the following
language:â

âThose,â he says, âwho expect to see a towering or
far-stretching promontory will be disappointed. We form
our ideas from ordinary maps, and imagine Englandâs
utmost cape to be a narrow tongue thrust out from the
firm shore, along which we may walk to meet the advancing
waves. But we find the reality to be merely a protruding
shoulder or buttress of the vast irregular bluff
that terminates the county. Cape Cornwall, which looks
so grand about two miles distant, appears to extend further
to the west than the Landâs End.

[194]

âSit still and gaze: the scene grows upon you. Here
the two channels commingle with the ocean; and far out
as eye can reach, and round on either hand till it meets
the remotest point of the rugged shore, stretches the
watery expanse. The billows come tumbling in, and
break in thunder at the base of the cliffs, dashing the
impatient spray well-nigh to their summit. You may
descend by steep paths to a lower level, and see the
cavernous opening which their plunging assaults have
worn through from one side of the buttress to the other.
With what fury they rush into the recess, and make horrid
whirlpools behind the mass which some day will be an
isolated member of the rocky group scattered along the
shore! There, on the largest of the cluster, nearly two
miles from shore, stands the
Longships Lighthouse
, and all
between is foam and swirl; waves running together, and
leaping high with the shock: a dangerous channel known
as the Kettleâs Bottom. See how the water chafes
around the Armed Knight there on the left, and the Irish
Lady on the right, and all the nameless lumps! Yonder,
under the cape, at the extremity of Whitesand Bay, are
the Brisons, invested by shipwreck with a fearful interest.â

The
Longships Lighthouse
, mentioned in the foregoing
extract, was erected in 1795 by a Mr. Smith, who received
as his reward the right to level a toll upon shipping for a
limited number of years. It was afterwards purchased of
his representatives by the Trinity House. The tower is
built of granite, and the stones are trenailed upon
Smeatonâs plan, as introduced in his great monument of
the Eddystone. The circumference at the base is 62 feet,
the height from the base to the vane of the lantern, and from
the sea to the foot of the building, 51 feet. The total
[195]

height, therefore, exceeds 100 feet. Yet the lantern-panes,
it is said, have been frequently shattered by the waves.

WOLFâS CRAG LIGHTHOUSE.

About eight miles from this part of the Cornish coast
lies a dangerous rock of greenstone, called the
Wolfâs Crag
,
in the midst of a turbulent swirl and eddy of waters. An
attempt was once made to plant on its summit the figure
of an enormous wolf, constructed of copper, and hollow
within, and so constructed that the mouth receiving the
[196]

blasts of the gale should emit a loud hoarse sound to warn
the seaman of his peril. The project, however, was
rendered abortive by the violence of the elements.

In 1870 a lighthouse was successfully erected on the
Wolfâs Crag;âa circular tower, 100 feet high.

The uninhabited island of Annette, one of the Scilly
group, is literally surrounded with reefs and rocks, each of
which is associated with some melancholy tale of suffering
and death. It has been well said that they are the âdogsâ
of Scilly, and fierce as those which, according to the old
fable, howled round the monster of the Italian seas:â

âBut Scylla crouches in the gloom,

Deep in a cavernâs monstrous womb;

Thence darts her ravening mouth, and drags

The helpless vessel on the crags.â
[48]

On the Gilstone Sir Cloudesley Shovel, the gallant old
sea-captain of Queen Anneâs reign, was wrecked in 1707;
on the Crebawethan perished the âDouro,â and all hands, in
1843; and on Jackyâs Rock, in 1841, the âThamesâ steamer
went to pieces, and out of sixty-five on board only three
were saved. The westernmost of those terrible rocks is
the
Bishop Rock
, and here a lighthouse was erected in
1858, from the design of Mr. James Walker. It is built
of granite, and the vane is 147 feet above high water
mark. The first stone, one of the fifth course, was laid
on the 16th of July 1852; and on the 30th of the same
month was laid the lowest stone, one foot below the level
of low water spring-tides, in the chasm of the rock. The
stone-work of the tower was finished on the 28th of
August 1857; and the light, a fixed bright dioptric light
[197]

of the first order, illuminating the entire circle, and visible,
in clear weather, at a distance of fourteen miles, was exhibited
on the 1st of September 1858.

BISHOP ROCK LIGHTHOUSE.

It is satisfactory to add, that this difficult enterprise was
carried to a successful termination without loss of life or
serious accident to any person employed.

LIZARD POINT LIGHTHOUSE.

One of our most famous English headlands is
Lizard
Point
, the
Ocrinum
of Ptolemy, the ancient geographer,
and the most southerly promontory of England. Here
[198]

are two large and massive lighthouses, whose bases are
168 feet above the sea, and 212 feet apart. Each tower
is 61 feet high, and each lantern contains nineteen reflectors,
which can be seen at a distance of twenty-one
miles. Between the two, which were erected by Mr.
Fonnereau, in 1751, and worked with coal-fires up to the
year 1813, are built the residence and offices; so contrived
that a long passage leads from one to the other, whereby
the keepers communicate without going out of doors.
âThese beacons,â says a recent writer,
[199]
âdisplay two
lights, to distinguish the Lizard from Scilly, known to
mariners by one, and from Guernsey, which exhibits three.
Notwithstanding, however, the brilliant illumination which
is hence thrown for miles over the sea, ships, embayed in
thick weather between the Lizard and Tol Pedn Penwith,
are frequently lost in the vicinity of this headland,
and the cliffs are of such a character that it is almost
impossible to render from them the slightest assistance.â

PLYMOUTH BREAKWATER LIGHTHOUSE.

The
Plymouth Breakwater
, which protects the great
Devonshire harbour from the furious gales of the Channel,
carries on its western arm an important lighthouse, erected
in 1841 to 1844,
from the designs
of Messrs. Walker
and Burges. It
consists of a circular
tower, 126
feet in height
from the base of
the breakwater,
71 feet above
high-water mark,
and 18 feet in diameter at its widest part. It is built of
the finest Cornish granite, and divided into five stories;
the highest of which, the lantern, has a floor of polished
slate; the others, of stone. The light, a dioptric one, has
a range of nine miles.

[200]

On the dark craggy headland of
Start Point
, about 112
feet above high-water mark, is situated a lighthouse exhibiting

two
lights; a revolving light for the Channel, and
a fixed light to guide ships inshore clear of the Skerries
shoal. Mr. White thus describes the tower and its
âbelongings:ââ

âA substantial house, connected with the tall circular
tower, in a walled enclosure, all nicely whitened, is the
residence of the light-keepers. The buildings stand within
a few yards of the verge of the cliff, the wall serving as
parapet, from which you look down on the craggy slope
outside and the jutting rocks beyondâthe outermost point.
You may descend by the narrow path, protected also by a
low white wall, and stride and scramble from rock to rock,
with but little risk of slipping, so rough are the surfaces
with minute shells.

âA rude steep stair, chopped in the rock, leads down
still lower to a little cove and a narrow strip of beach at
the foot of the cliffs. It is the landing-place for the
lighthouse-keepers when they go fishing; but can only be
used in calm weather.

[201]

âThe assistant-keeper spoke of the arrival of a visitor
as a pleasure in the monotonous life of the establishment.
Winter, he said, was a dreary time, not so much on
account of cold, as of storms, fogs, and wild weather
generally. In easterly gales the fury of the wind would
be often such that to walk across the yard was impossible;
they had to crawl under shelter of the wall, and the spray
flew from one side of the Point to the other. But indoors
there was no lack of comfort, for the house was solidly
built and conveniently fitted, and the Trinity Board kept
a small collection of books circulating from lighthouse to
lighthouse.â

There are two lighthouses at
Portland Bill
; the lantern
of one 136, and that of the other 210 feet above the sea.
Between the chalk cliffs and a bank called the
Shambles
,
foams the wild impetuous current of the Race of Portland.

The celebrated chalky range of the South Downs terminates
on the Sussex coast in
Beachy Head
, an abrupt
precipitous promontory,
575 feet above
the sea-level. On
a point considerably
lower than this lofty
headland, and projecting
much further
into the sea, stands
the celebrated Belle
Tout Lighthouse,
erected in 1831.

NORTH FORELAND LIGHTHOUSE.

The
North Foreland
,
one of the
great Kentish promontories,
is also
crowned by its lighthouse,
which dates
from 1790. The
light is visible at the
Nore, a distance of twenty miles.

[202]

SOUTH FORELAND LIGHTHOUSE.

At the
South Foreland
lighthouse, a few miles from
Dover, the electric light is used; the electric current being
originated by a set of enormous horse-shoe magnets fixed
in a stand, before which a wheel revolves, loaded with a
number of solid iron cylinders. The whole apparatus is
set in motion by a steam-engine.

HOLYHEAD LIGHTHOUSE.

Both the east and west coasts of our âsea-girt islandâ
are well provided with warning lights, but a mere enumeration
of them would scarcely be satisfactory to the reader,
and a description would prove as wearisome as a twice-told
tale, for the reason stated at the beginning of this chapter.
If we traced the coast-line of Scotland, we should find it
equally well defended; or if we crossed to the Isle of Man,
we should still meet with the monuments of manâs warfare
against the ocean. Then, again, if we cross from Holyhead
[203]

to Dublin, our vessel is guided by the stately light
which glows upon the Stack Rock, and by the Bailey Lighthouse
at the extremity of the Howth peninsula. The Bailey
on the south, and the Kish Lightship on the north, mark
the extreme points of the beautiful Bay of Dublin. Keeping
southward, along the eastern coast, we descry the lighthouses
on the rugged cliffs of Wicklow Head, and in Tuskar
Rock; and, on the south coast, at Hook Tower, marking
the eastern side of the entrance to the port of Waterford;
[204]

at Ballinacourty, as a guide to ships entering Dungarvan
Harbour; at Mine Head, and Ballycottin Point, and Roche
Point, the north-eastern boundary of Cork Harbour; and at
the Old Head of Kinsale, whose light is visible for twenty-one
nautical miles, and proves immeasurably welcome to the
Briton home-bound from the New World, because it is the
first he sees after his departure from American waters.

KINSALE LIGHTHOUSE.

A revolving light, which gradually increases and decreases
every two minutes, is exhibited on the
Fastnet
Rock
, a few miles off the southernmost point of Ireland.

Of iron lighthouses the British coast presents but few
examples. The reader will, therefore, be not unwilling
to gain some particulars of the tower on this well-known
rock; a rock rising about 60 feet above high-water mark.
Its iron structure consists, in the main, of the following
parts:
[49]
âThe shell, composed of cast-iron plates; the
hollow cast-iron central column; five cast-iron floors, the
uppermost of which is the platform at the top of the
[205]

tower, supporting the lantern; a projecting cast-iron
gallery, level with the platform, sustained by cast-iron
brackets, and having a balustrade; an external iron stair,
for access to the doors on the first floor; internal iron
stairs to connect the several floors; a lining of masonry
in the basement, and of brick in the upper stories; and a
cut stone moulding round the base.

MAPLIN SANDS LIGHTHOUSE.

This lighthouse
was erected
in 1848, from
the design of
Mr. Halpin, engineer
to the
Corporation of
Dublin.

Of lighthouses
on piles we shall
take as an example
the
Maplin
Sands Lighthouse
,
designed
by Mr. Walker,
[207]

for the Trinity House Corporation, and erected in
1841.

It stands upon nine piles of wrought-iron, each 26 feet
long and 5 inches in diameter: these are screwed 14 feet
6 inches deep into the sand, and secured by screw-blades
of cast-iron, each 4 feet in diameter. One pile forms the
centre of an octagon; the others are placed one at each of
the eight angles. To the tops of the piles are firmly
fitted hollow iron columns; the central one being perpendicular,
the others bent, so that they incline inwards.
They are braced together by radiating, diagonal, and
horizontal rods. Each terminates at the top in a socket,
into which is fitted a timber post of about one foot square.
The posts, like the columns, are braced together, and
form the foundation of the house, platform, and lantern.

The principal dimensions are as follows:â

A lighthouse of this kind is excellently adapted for any
locality where the light does not require to be seen at a
great distance. The piles offer no appreciable opposition
to the waves, which pass through the open spaces without
rising higher than out at sea.

The
Gunfleet Lighthouse
stands on seven screw piles,
[208]

screwed 40 feet deep into the sand. The
Point of Ayre
Lighthouse
, on nine, screwed 12 feet into the sand.

Before we conclude these desultory notes, it seems
desirable to refer to a lighthouse now in course of erection,
which is not unworthy to rank with the finest of its
predecessors.

About midway between the famous Skerryvore Lighthouse
and that of the Rhins of Islayâor 20 miles from
Islay, 18 miles from Colonsay, 15 miles from Iona, and 15
miles from Mullâin the centre of an archipelago which
ancient legend, and ecclesiastical history, and modern
romance have done their best to render celebratedâlies
the
Dubhe Artach
(or
St. Johnâs
)
Rock
. It forms an
isolated mass of augite about 240 feet in length by 43
feet in breadth, whose rounded summit rises 47 feet above
high-water mark. In stormy weather the sea sweeps
over it with terrific violence, and for miles around it boils
and seethes with counter-currents and opposing waves.
During the severe gales of the winter of 1865â66 many
ships were lost in this dangerous neighbourhood, and it
was therefore determined by the Commissioners of Northern
Lighthouses, with the sanction of the Trinity House
and Board of Trade, to erect a lighthouse on the Dubhe
Artach.

The material of the rock is so excessively hard that the
works, at first, could not be carried forward with much
rapidity. Neither in the building of the Eddystone nor
of the Skerryvore could the engineers have had greater
difficulties to contend with. A foundation has, however,
been at last obtained, and several courses of the masonry
[209]

securely laid, so that the elegant structure, designed by
Messrs. D. and T. Stevenson of Edinburgh, will, in
another twelvemonth, be completed. Its estimated cost
is Â£56,900. It consists of a parabolic frustrum, whose
topmost course is 109 feet above its base. The diameter
at the bottom measures 36 feet, at the top 16 feet. There
will be seven apartments besides the light-room. The
total height of the lantern above the sea will be 154 feet,
commanding a range of about eighteen miles.

ALGUADA REEF LIGHTHOUSE.

Lastly, we propose to
wander away from the
shores of the United Kingdom,
though not to trespass
beyond the confines
of British territory. Had
our limits permitted, we
might have entered upon a
description of the Australian
and North American
pharoses, of the lighthouse
at Perim, of the lighthouses
on the coast of Hindustan;
but such a multiplicity of
details would assuredly
have wearied the reader.
Yet, as a proof that our
engineering operations in
this department are not
less skilfully and boldly
executed abroad than at home, we shall adduce, in terminating
[210]

this chapter, the noble structure situated on the
Alguada Reef.

This reef lies a few miles to the southward of Cape
Negrais, the south-west promontory of Pegu, near one of
the mouths of the great Irrawady river. Being thrown,
as it were, directly in the track of vessels sailing from
Calcutta to the thriving ports of Moulmein and Rangoon,
it was a constant danger to the mariner; for the sea, except
in the calmest weather, always dashes against it with
restless fury, and no vessel cast upon it can hope to escape.
The late Marquis of Dalhousie, appreciating its perilous
character, designed to erect a lighthouse upon it; but no
action was taken in the matter until 1856, when the loss
of a coolie ship and 286 lives induced Lord Canning to
resume his predecessorâs project.

The stone had to be brought from Pulo Obin, near
Singapore, a distance of 1200 miles; and it was not until
January 1860 that the work of excavating the foundation
was commenced. On February 14, 1861, the first stone
was laid, and thenceforth the work proceeded bravely,
though entirely carried on by Coolie labour. The light,
a first-class holophotal light, designed by Messrs. D. and T.
Stevenson of Edinburgh, was first kindled on April 23,
1865, at an elevation of 144 feet above high-water mark.
It commands a range of twenty nautical miles.

In general appearance the Alguada Reef Lighthouse
resembles the Skerryvore, after which, indeed, it was designed,
by Captain Fraser; but it surpasses its model in its
dimensions.

[Here we conclude our sketches of celebrated lighthouses;
[211]

structures, we think, scarcely less deserving of the public
interest and admiration, than the triumphal arches and
stately columns erected to the memory of successful
generals, or the superb palaces which enshrine the magnificence
of kings and princes. For every lighthouse, be it
remembered, is a proof of formidable engineering difficulties
successfully overcome, and, therefore, rises before us as
an impressive monument of human ingenuity, skill, and
perseverance, exerted, for the noblest of purposesâfor the
preservation of human life, for the prevention of that
misery and grief and deep-abiding sorrow which are the
invariable consequences of the âwreck ashore.â]

[212]

BOOK IV.

LIGHTHOUSES IN FRANCE.

CHAPTER I.

THE TOUR DE CORDOUAN.

[50]

âTruly
mysterious is the Channel, in that
narrow gullet where it engulfs the waves
of the North Sea. Violent are the waters of
Brittany, as they eddy to and fro in the
ravines of its basaltic coast. But the Gulf of Gascony,
from Cordouan to Biarritz, is a sea of contradictions; an
enigma of strife and struggle. As it stretches southward,
it suddenly acquires an extraordinary depth, and becomes
an abyss in which the waters are swallowed up. An
ingenious naturalist has compared it to a gigantic funnel,
which abruptly absorbs all that is poured into it. The
flood, escaping from it under an awful pressure, remounts
to a height of which our seas afford no other example.â
[51]

[213]

The eloquent historian of the sea does not paint in colours
too vivid the raging excesses of the Gulf of Gascony;
and, therefore, from a remote epoch, the French government
have sought to guard against its dangers by securing a
proper lightage of the entrance of the Gironde. To trace
the origin of the Lighthouse of Cordouan we must go back
to a very distant antiquity. Unfortunately we know little
of the history of this marvellous erection on a craggy platform,
which is alternately covered and exposed by the
waves at every tide. It is certain that the present structure
had, at least, two predecessors. If tradition may be
credited, the first was raised by Louis the DÃ©bonnair.
But as no document is extant to support this hypothesis,
we are inclined to believe that no lighthouse was built
there until the thirteenth century, and that it was then
erected in compliance with the urgent request of the merchants
of Cordova, and foreign merchants trading in the
wines of Bordeaux. Matthew Paris records, in his well-known
âChronicles,â that the Moors having been driven
back to the extreme south of Spain, extensive commercial
relations were established at this epoch (1236) between
the Gascons and the cities of Cordova and Seville. Hence
came the name of Cordouan. That this etymology is contradicted
by many scholars, and even turned into jest, we
are aware, but to ridicule is not to prove. What appears
certain is, that the town of Cordova (said to contain
300,000 souls in the thirteenth century, and the ancient
capital of the Khalifate of the same name) had two reasons
instead of one for demanding the establishment of a lighthouse
at the mouth of the Gironde; for its merchants
visited Bordeaux not only to deal in its wines, but to sell
[214]

their hides and leather, renowned then as now for their
fineness and excellent quality.

But passing from the domains of conjecture to those of
history, we know that the second lighthouse was built in
the fourteenth century (1362â70), by the order of Edward
the Black Prince. This lighthouse was 48 feet in height.
It terminated in a platform, where was kindled a fire of
wood under the charge of a holy hermit, who received in
reward of his labours a toll from each vessel of two groats
sterling. It is generally believed that the rock on which
the lighthouse stood was, at that epoch, still united to the
MÃ©doc coast. The configuration of the soil, the distance,
the depth of the channel, the ravages still effected by the
sea at Soulac and at the Point de Grave, are arguments in
favour of this opinion.

The lighthouse built by the Black Prince did not stand
alone upon its rock. As a companion it had a chapel,
raised in honour of the Virgin Mary, and several houses,
constructed in this sacred locality, gradually formed a
kind of village. Here dwelt the hermit, his assistants,
and, probably, a small number of pilots and fishermen.

An engraving of the date of the fifteenth century represents
this ancient tower as an octagonal building, with
elongated quadrangular openings. It is doubled, so to
speak, up to its first story, with an exterior casing of stone,
forming an additional protection. Some of the houses
which formerly occupied this particular site were existing
at the epoch when the drawing was executed.

ANCIENT TOWER OF CORDOUAN.

The lighthouse, which at the present time so justly
extorts the admiration of all its visitors, was constructed,
[215]

not on the ruins, but by the side of its predecessor. Begun
in 1584 by Louis de Foix, a Parisian architect, to whom
Philip II. confided at a later date the building of the
Escorial, it was not completed until 1600, and then by his
son. Including the solid mass of the platform or base,
the tower was 60 feet high, and including the stone lantern,
70 feet. At the date of its erection, the ground was,
as undoubtedly it for a long time had been, completely
separated from the mainland, and formed an island of a
certain extentâthe âIsle of Cordouan,â says Louis de Foix
himself, in the contract signed with the authorities of
[216]

Guienne for the construction of the tower. This island
has since disappeared, as well as the houses and chapel of
which we have spoken; and now, at the foot of the monument,
are only the bare rock and some tongues of sand
completely covered at high water.

The pharos, as it issued from the hands of the Des Foix,
father and son, consisted of a circular platform protected
by a broad parapet, and of the tower, which was divided
into four stories, not including the lantern. The ground
floor presented a great vestibule of a quadrangular form,
with four little recesses which served for magazines.
Staircases placed in the embrasures of the entrance-gate
and of the two windows led to the cellars and the water-tank.
On either side of the doorway, prior to the Revolution,
were busts of Henry III. and Henry IV. On the
first story, which bore the titleâprobably without any
justificationâof âthe Kingâs Chamber,â was a saloon of
the same dimensions as the vestibule, but more richly
decorated, from which access was obtained to the first
exterior gallery. A chapel, circular in shape, occupied
the second story, and was illuminated by two rows of
windows, covered by a spherical vault, and enriched with
Corinthian pilasters and elegant sculptures. Above the
door of the chapel stood the bust of Louis de Foix; and
the following sonnet, composed in the purest
galimatias
of
the time, was engraved on a large tablet above it:â

All the parts of the primitive construction still exist,
and have undergone but little alteration during successive
restorations; but such is not the case with the upper portion,
which has been completely destroyed, from the gradual
sinking of the tower.

Above the second gallery, the dome of the chapel was
ornamented on the outside by richly sculptured dormer-windows,
forming the second tier of windows of that story.
It was surmounted by a circular pavilion, vaulted, and
decorated with composite pilasters, whose entablature was
crowned by the open balustrade of an outer gallery leading
into the lantern. This lanternâwhose dimensions were
somewhat limitedâwas built of hewn stone, and composed
of eight arcades, whose piers were embellished with columns,
and whose cupola terminated in a shaft to carry off the
smoke of the furnace.

Under Louis XV., in 1727, an iron structure was substituted
for this stone lantern, whose masonry had been
calcined by the fire, and whose broad piers, moreover, had
the serious inconvenience of obscuring a very considerable
portion of the light; but the furnace was kept at the same
elevation; namely, about 120 feet above the level of the
highest seas.

This elevation, as it did not enable the light to be seen
[218]

at a sufficient distance, was soon pronounced unsatisfactory.
A scheme to raise it 100 feet was planned by the
Chevalier de Borda, who submitted it to TeulÃ¨re, the
chief engineer to the city of Bordeaux. The latter pointed
out that it was both imperative and possible to increase
the height by 65 feet. His designs were accepted, and
their successful execution, in 1788 and 1789, in spite of
many dangers, procured for TeulÃ¨re a reputation scarcely
inferior to that of De Foix himself.

The light is now placed at an elevation above high-water
level of 190 feet, and above the ground of 205 feet.
But, regarded from an artistic point of view, we must
confess that the lighthouse has by no means gained.
There is a certain dryness about the too naked forms of
the modern construction, which contrasts in a manner much
to be deplored with the elegance and richness of the
Renaissance work. The present summit (
couronnement
)
is by no means equal to that which formerly existed. Yet,
as Reynaud justly observes, the first impression which the
edifice produces leaves no room for regret; you are penetrated
with a profound feeling of admiration the moment
you find yourself in the presence of this majestic monument,
towering with so sublime a boldness above the
bosom of the ocean.

PRESENT LIGHTHOUSE OF CORDOVA.

These emotions have been finely expressed by Michelet
in his noble book on âthe Sea.â

âDuring our six monthsâ sojourn on this shore,â he
says, âour ordinary object of contemplationâI had almost
said, our daily societyâwas Cordouan. We felt keenly
how its position as guardian of the seas, as the constant
watcher of the strait, made of it an individuality. Erect

[221]
against the broad eastern horizon, it appeared under a
hundred varied aspects. Sometimes, in a belt of glory,
it triumphed under the sun; sometimes, pale and indistinct,
it hovered through the mist, no augury of good. At
evening, when it abruptly kindled its red light, and darted
forth its glance of fire, it seemed like a zealous inspector,
who watched over the waters, impressed and disquieted by
his responsibility. Whatever occurred at sea was attributed
to it. By illuminating the tempest, it was frequently a
source of safety, and yet men ascribed to it the storm. It
is thus that Ignorance too often treats Genius, accusing
it of the evils which it reveals. Even we ourselves were
not just. If it delayed lighting up, if bad weather came,
we censured it, we growled at it. âAh, Cordouan, Cordouan,
thou white phantom! canst thou, then, bring us
nought but storms?ââ

During the last few years a complete restoration of the
lighthouse of Cordouan has been carried out, with the
view of replacing the stonesâand they were numerousâinjured
by the weather, and of renewing the sculptures,
which it was difficult to trace, they were so worn and
abraded. All the buildings which at different times had
been erected against the platform-wall to supply the insufficiency
of dwelling-apartments in the lighthouse,
have been reconstructed. And in 1854 arrangements
were made to distinguish it from neighbouring lights;
it has now a revolving light, white and red, with a range
of twenty-seven miles.

INTERIOR OF THE CORDOVA LIGHTHOUSE.

The introduction of the dioptric apparatus into the Cordouan
lighthouse took place long ago; it belongs, in fact,
[222]

to the earliest experiments
of Fresnel, for it is a peculiarity
worth notice in the
annals of this patriarch of
pharoses, that attention has
always been directed to it
when any question has arisen
of testing a new invention.
It was one of the first which
saw the inconvenient and
unsatisfactory
chauffer
replaced,
as a means of lightage,
by oil lamps. In 1782
it was provided with at least
eighty of these, each accompanied
by a reflector. A
few years later, when TeulÃ¨re
had furnished Borda with
the elements of the catoptric
system, the largest apparatus
was immediately installed at
Cordouan (1790). Finally,
when Augustin Fresnel, in his
turn, invented the lenticular
system, it was at Cordouan
that experiments
were
first made
with the
most important
model.

[223]

Considering, then, the numerous and valuable services
which Cordouan has rendered, we ask ourselves, says M.
RÃ©nard,
[52]
whether, among the numerous monuments raised
by the pride and daring of man, there are many of so
much respectability as this âPatriarch of the Lighthouses!â
We cannot acknowledge that any one of them is so justly
deserving of our reverent admiration. Nobler, far nobler,
and of infinitely greater utility, than the trophies by which
the conqueror has tracked his bloody path, or the pompous
boundary-stones erected by nations at each stage of their
history, it will also be of a more permanent character.
For these belong only to individuals or peoples: Cordouan
belongs to the whole human race.

[224]

CHAPTER II.

THE LIGHTHOUSES OF CAPE LA HEVE.

A.D. 1774.

Doux feux qui protÃ©gez et ThÃ©tis et la Seine,

SÃ»rs et brillants rivaux des deux frÃ¨res dâHÃ©lÃ¨ne,

Phares, je vous salue; assurez Ã  jamais

Le commerce opulent de lâheureuse Neustrie;

Fixez dans ma patrie

Casimir Delavigne.

Ye fires which guard both Thetis and the Seine,

Bright shining compeers of the brothers twainâ

Castor and Polluxâvigilant fires, all hail!

O gentle lights, I pray ye, never fail

To guide secure each wealthy Neustrian keel,

And to my country all the fruits reveal

Of blessÃ¨d peace, and guard the common weal!

No
one can have visited Havre without devoting
at least an hour to the Cape La HÃ¨ve,
and to the two lighthouses which have
extorted from Casimir Delavigne his poetical
homage. A pilgrimage to this point is made all the more
willingly that the pilgrim who accomplishes it must
necessarily pass through Sainte-Adresse, and Sainte-Adresseâneed
we remind the reader?âis one of the marvels of
Normandy.

[225]

âThe delicious vale of Tempe, which the poets of all
time have pleased themselves with investing in the riches
of their imagination, possesses no attraction which the
valley of Sainte-Adresse need envy: its limpid waters, the
gently sloping hills which enclose it, the little gardens
where for once the hand of Art has not defaced and desecrated
the work of Nature; the pure ethereal freshness
which it inhales from the breath of its myriad flowers, and
which the wind of the plain never respires;âall charms,
all seduces, and we exclaim, Happy he who can spend his
life in an abode which Flora and Pomona embellish! The
goddess Hygeia resides there throughout the year, and,
by a happy alliance with Boreas, both contend for the
pleasure of protecting this new Eden against the hideous
host of human infirmities. Painters, seize your brushes,
and let its image revive on your imitative canvas; poets,
come hither in quest of inspiration!â

It is thus that Morlent expresses himself in his âMonographie
du Havre.â It is true that Morlentâas the
reader will conjectureâwrote in 1825. Since that date
many things have greatly changedâthe descriptive style
as well as the valley of Sainte-Adresse, which is no longer
anything else than a suburb of Havre, covered with
edifices of a more or less picturesque character.

The most curious thing which Sainte-Adresse has preserved
is the story of the origin of its name. Namely: that
a vessel driven by the currents into the immediate vicinity
of the promontory of La HÃ¨ve, which then extended a
greater distance into the sea, was on the point of perishing.
Already the despairing sailors had given up further efforts;
[226]

the pilot, having abandoned the rudder, imitated the rest
of the crew, and commended his soul to St. Denis, patron-saint
of Caux,
[53]
whose spire was at intervals visible
through the haze. âMy friends,â said the captain, who
in these circumstances had retained his presence of mind,
âit is not St. Denis we must invoke, but
Sainte-Adresse

(St. Skill), for it is only she who at this crisis can carry
us safely into port.â The sailors regained courage; the
ship entered Havre; and the phrase âSainte-Adresseâ
became everywhere popular.

In reference to La HÃ¨ve, the great writer, Bernardin de
Saint-Pierre, a native of Havre, relates a fantastic legend:â

âThe Seineââit is Cephas, one of the personages of

the Arcadia
, who speaksââthe daughter of Bacchus and
nymph of Ceres, had pursued into the land of the Gauls
the goddess of wheat, when she was seeking all the earth
over for her daughter Proserpine. When Ceres had
terminated her wanderings, the Seine begged of her,
as a reward for her services, the meadows through which
the river at present flows. The goddess consented, and
granted, moreover, that wine should grow wherever the
daughter of Bacchus planted her feet. She left then the
Seine upon these shores, and gave her as her companion
and follower the nymph HÃ©va, who was bidden to watch
beside her, for fear she might be carried away by some
god of the sea, as her daughter Proserpine had been by
the god of Hades. One day while the Seine was amusing
herself on the sands in quest of shells, and when she fled,
[227]

with loud cries, before the blue sea-waves which sometimes
wetted her feet, HÃ©va, her companion, discovered
under the waters the white locks, the empurpled visage,
and azure robe of Neptune. This god had come from the
Orcades after a great earthquake, and was traversing the
shores of Ocean, examining with his trident whether their
foundations had been shattered. On seeing him, HÃ©va
shrieked loudly, and at her warning cry the Seine immediately
fled towards the meadows. But the sea-god had
also descried the nymph of Ceres, and moved by her
brightness and charming mien, he drove his sea-horses in
swift pursuit. Just as he was on the point of overtaking
her, she cried upon Bacchus her father, and Ceres her
mistress. Both heard her; and as Neptune stretched
forth his arms to seize her, all the body of the Seine dissolved
into water; her green veil and vestments, which
the winds fluttered before her, were changed into emerald
waves; she was transformed into a river of the same
colour, which still finds a pleasure in winding through the
scenes she had loved in her days of nymph-hood: but
what is best worthy of notice is, that Neptune, despite
the metamorphosis, has never ceased to love her, as is also
said of the river Alpheus with regard to the fountain of
Arethusa. But if the god of ocean has preserved his
passion for the Seine, the Seine still cherishes her
antipathy to him. Twice a day he pursues her with
awful roar; and each time the Seine flies from him
into the green inlands, ascending towards her source,
contrary to the natural course of rivers.
[54]
And ever she
[228]

separates her green waters from the cerulean billows of
ocean.

âHÃ©va died of sorrow for the loss of her mistress. But
the Nereids, to reward her for her fidelity, raised to her
memory on the shore a tomb of black and white stones,
which are visible from a great distance. By a celestial
artifice, they also enclosed in them an echo, that HÃ©va,
after her death, might both by sight and hearing forewarn
the sailor of the dangers of the sea. This tomb is yonder
precipitous mountain, composed of funereal strata of white
and black stones. It still bears the name of HÃ©va.â

Cape La HÃ¨ve, the ancient promontory of the Caletes,
is one of the jetties, or breakwaters, of the great embouchure
of the Seine; in the tenth century, it extended
far into the sea, and made an integral part of the bank of
lâEclat, which is now separated from it by a channel upwards
of 2000 yards in width. The bank, as its name
indicates, has been broken up by a sudden eruption of
the currents, or by an earthquake. Nor has ocean ceased
its ravages, for it is calculated that its waters encroach
seven feet upon the land every year.

LIGHTHOUSES OF CAPE LA HEVE.

If we may credit an old chronicle, the origin of the two
lighthouses of La HÃ¨ve is very ancient. They date back
to the epoch when Harfleur was the rendezvous of Spanish
fleets. The tower which then surmounted the groyne
(
groing
) of Caux had been constructed in 1364; a fire was
kindled on its summit in all weathers, and it was called the

Tour des Castillans
. Not a vestige was extant when the
incessant representations of merchants and seamen determined
the Government of Louis XV. to comply with the

[231]
instance of the Chamber of Normandy by constructing
the lighthouses which now illuminate the port of
Havre.

The buildings represented in the accompanying illustration
were erected in 1774. Surmounted at first by
chauffers

in which coal was burned, each of them was crowned in
1781 by a lantern containing an illuminating apparatus
of sixteen spherical reflectors, some lit up by three, and
the others by two broad wicks. There were forty burners
in the apparatus. The double paraboloidal reflectors of
Bordier-Marceat, six to each lighthouse, were substituted
for these faulty appliances in 1811 and 1814, and their
number increased to ten in 1819. Finally, in 1845,
the towers were restored and modified in their superstructure,
so as to fit them for receiving the lenticular
apparatus, and lanterns of 12 feet in diameter.
[55]
In the
meantime, suitable dwellings for the light-keepers were
erected between the two towers. Each keeper has two
apartments, a closet, a store-room, and a wood-shed, which
stands in an enclosed court. He is not, therefore, indifferently
accommodated.

The elevations of the La HÃ¨ve lighthouses present a
very imposing appearance. The view from their summit
is singularly impressive, and has even been compared by
travellers to that of Corinth and Constantinople. When
the air is clear, and the sky unclouded, the spectator can
see as far as Barfleur on the south-west; on the west,
Honfleur, Trouville, and the little picturesque bathing
[232]

places on the Normandy coast: Villers, Houlgate, Cabourg,
Beuzeval; and finally, in the remote distance, La Hogue,
the scene of Admiral Russelâs celebrated victory. To the
north, he discerns the Cape of Antifer, and the rent and
sombre rocks of Etretat.

[233]

CHAPTER III.

THE LIGHTHOUSE OF THE HEAUX OF BREHAT.

A.D. 1836â1840.

One
of the most important of the French lighthouses
is that whose brilliant fixed light radiates
nightly over the vast and dangerous space
comprised between the coast of Brittany and
the Roches-Douvres. In our opulent cities it would be
considered a monument of the first rank, and its celebrity
would, perhaps, rival the renown of the towers of the
Eddystone and the Bell Rock, if, like them, it numbered
as many years, and had been erected at an epoch when
engineering science was less advanced than is the case in
the present day.

As a matter of justice, however, we may remark that,
notwithstanding the self-reliance of its celebrated constructor,
when he cast the foundations of his edifice on the
formidable rocks of the EpÃ©es de TrÃ©guierânotwithstanding
his thorough acquaintance with the labours of his
predecessorsâM. LÃ©once Reynaud found himself called
upon to meet and conquer difficulties scarcely less numerous
[234]

or less arduous than those so successfully vanquished
by a Smeaton and a Stevenson.

These obstacles were of such a formidable character that
the French Lighthouse Commission long hesitated, when
deciding on the erection of a lighthouse at the mouth of
the gulf which extends between Brittany and the Cotentin,
whether its site should be on the mainland or out
at sea. The rock on which the choice of the engineers
finally rested was part of a group which the sea nearly
overwhelms at high tide. It was evident, therefore, that
the artificers would only be able to work for a certain
number of hours daily. More, the ocean-currents of the
region in which it was situated were proverbially very
violent; their rate of speed was not less than eight knots
per second, and when their force is augmented by the
agitation of a tempest, the billows rage with excessive and
formidable fury, swelling to enormous heights, and filling
the air with their clash and clangour.

Nothing daunted by these difficulties, our engineers set
to work, and commenced the erection of the workmenâs
sheds. These were planted on the isle of BrÃ©hat, at about
three leaguesâ distance from the rock. In addition to the
fact that this island possesses numerous perfectly sheltered
harbours, it is placed by the currents under quite peculiar
conditions with respect to the rock of the HÃ©aux: the ebb-tide
swings from the island to the rock, and the flood rushes
from the rock to the island; and it is exactly at low water
that disembarkations must take place. Finally, the island
presented all the resources desirable for the accommodation
and provisioning of the numerous artificers whose services
were called into requisition by so considerable an undertaking.

[235]

In one of the havens a jetty of rough stones, about 170
feet in length, was constructed, to facilitate the embarkations
and disembarkations, which would necessarily be
very frequent. The harbour, that of La Corderie, was
exactly opposite the HÃ©aux. In addition to the boats
which transported to the rock the materials prepared
in

the island, a very large flotilla was employed in conveying
the rough materials, drawn from all quarters,
to
the island.
The granite came from the Ile-Grande, situated about ten
leagues to the westward; the lime from the basin of the
Loire; Saint-Malo furnished the timber; and, finally, as
the wells of BrÃ©hat did not supply sufficient water for
the additional population and the uses of the artificers,
water, as well as provisions, was obtained from the mainland.

Sixty artificers formed the âarmy of labourâ organized
to carry out all M. Raynaudâs bold designs. Lodgings had
to be provided for them, inasmuch as the navigation was
too uncertain, and the time during which boats could
anchor much too short, to admit of their being daily
carried back to the mainland. Fortunately, at a very
short distance from the place chosen for the works, two
aiguilles, or needle-rocks, were found, sufficiently elevated
to remain constantly above the level of the water. The
interval between them was filled up partly with rough
stones and partly with masonry, until an elevation of
thirteen feet above the sea was secured; and a platform
was thus constructed sufficiently durable for the
purpose to which it was intended to put it. Here were
planted the huts of the men, and the framework of a
beacon which was to carry a provisional light. You may
[236]

suppose, gentle reader, that there was no room to be
wasted. In the beacon was placed, besides the store-room
and the keeperâs lodgings, the chamber for the
accommodation of the engineer; his bivouacking hut was
on the right; by blowing up a portion of the rock, a long
but narrow apartment was obtained for the overseers; on
the left, in front, stood the kitchen and larder; at the
side, the workmenâs dining-room; behind, their sitting
and bed-room, which was well filled. The beds were
placed as close to each other as possible, in two tiers. A
third range was situated in the refectory, above the table.
And, lastly, on a projecting crag, to the left, means had
been found to erect a small forge, which had but one
defect, that it was often impossible to keep it lighted at
high water.

At first the workmen were allowed to supply themselves
as they pleased with provisions; but some cases of scurvy
having broken out, the engineer felt the necessity of
enforcing upon them a regular bill of fare. For this purpose
he established a canteen, and bound down its owner
to keep a stock sufficient for six weeksâ supply, as a
precaution against possible bad weather, which might cut
off all communication with the mainland. At this canteen
each workman was compelled to obtain his rations.
Other hygienic measures were adopted. The hammocks
were every morning exposed in the open air, and once
a week the lodging-rooms were lime-washed. Once a
week, too, the whole company bathed. Thanks to these
precautions, the terrible malady whose approach had
been apprehended was driven from the island, and the
sanitary condition of so great a number of men herded
[237]

together in a very limited compass remained constantly
satisfactory.

Every day, as soon as the tide had ebbed, the artificers
repaired to work, and the hours for meals were so arranged
that no interruption took place while the tide lasted.
When the rising waters forced them to abandon the rock,
a bell gave the signal. They then hastened to cover with
a cement which hardened instantaneously the portions of
masonry which had just been finished, and took refuge in
their abodes. Sometimes, however, it would happen that
the sea rose with unusual rapidity; woe, then, to the
tardy! They had no other resource but to throw themselves
into the water before its depth became dangerous;
an amusement for the on-lookers, and almost their only
one. Thanks to these measures of order and supervision,
the engineer had not to regret the loss of any of the members
of his laborious little colony; although, during the course
of their works, many ships, and, still more unfortunately,
several visitors, perished.

Let us now say a few words respecting the work itself.

The principal difficulty of the operation consisted in
erecting the submarine portion of the building. Once the
level of high-water mark was reached, the men could
not only carry on their labours more conveniently, but
were relieved from the most critical chances. Thenceforth
they had nothing further to do with the sea than as
regarded the process of landing, and to a certain extent
they built upon an island. But on this artificial island
everything depended, and in its formation every precaution
had to be studied.

[238]

The rock on which the lighthouse rests consists of an
extremely hard and resistant black porphyry. Nevertheless,
as in some places it showed numerous fissures, the
work began with the removal of all the superficial part, so
as to secure a properly sound basis; and as, at the same
time, it was of great importance that the foundation
should never be exposed, M. Reynaud adopted the necessary
measures to sink it completely in the rock. With
this view, an annular surface of 38 feet in diameter,
destined to support the hewn stone work, was excavated
in the porphyry to a depth of about twenty inches, and
dressed with the utmost exactitude; a labour of excessive
difficulty on account of the tenacity of the rock, but a
certain safeguard against future danger. In the groove
thus protected by the whole mass of porphyry were
deposited the first courses. As for the part of the rock
corresponding to the interior of the tower, no special necessity
for extra precautions existing in respect to it, it was
left in its rough state, with simply a layer of concrete.

With a view to that stability which has become for the
engineer a principle of elegance, the building, 155 feet
in height, has been divided into two principal parts. The
first, concave at its base, is of solid masonry up to three
feet three inches above the level of the highest tides; its
diameter at the base is 38 feet, and at its summit 28 feet.
The second, reposing on this impregnable foundation, presents
that measure of lightness which would have been considered
suitable for a tower of the same elevation built
upon the mainland. The thickness of the wall is 50 inches
below, and 30 inches above.

[239]

As for the methods adopted by the architect, it does not
seem necessary to describe them in detail; they would
only prove interesting to readers of scientific acquirements.
Yet we feel disinclined to pass over in silence a bold conception
which does honour to M. Reynaud; namely, that,
contrary to a generally accepted idea, it is not necessary in
works of this kind to bind together all the stones as a
whole, under a supposition that the sea may sweep them
away during or after the execution of the works. Thus, in
the lighthouses of the Eddystone and the Bell Rock, all the
stones in the lower courses are dove-tailed into one another
after the most ingenious designs, and held together by
plugs of iron and wood. Unquestionably, says Reynaud,
these arrangements are not without efficacy; but it is doubtful
whether sufficient reasons for them exist. Perhaps
they even present more inconveniencies than advantages,
for, in addition to their cost, they necessitate a troublesome
delay in the execution of works which it is of
importance to raise as rapidly as possible above the level
of the sea.

The architect of the lighthouse of the HÃ©aux has not,
then, fixed each single stone; he has confined himself to
arresting at certain points the total mass of water which
he supposed might be set in motion during each tide.
Consequently each layer was divided, for this purpose,
into a certain number of portions; twelve for the lower,
and eight for the upper courses. All the stones of
these great key-stones rested one upon another by means
of salient and re-entering edges; and, more, those of the
angles were securely fastened to the course beneath by
plugs of granite. Experience has proved this simple
[240]

arrangement to be sufficient; no injury has occurred to
contradict the principle on which it was founded.

Such are the means by which this almost unequalled
pharos of the HÃ©aux was completed. It occupied six
years in erection. The first was employed in examining
the localities and perfecting the plans; the second, in the
establishment of the cabins and the formation of the groove
in the rock; the third, in the construction of the solid
masonry; during the fourth, the tower was raised as far
as the first gallery; in the fifth, a little above the cornice;
finally, in 1839, the lantern was fixed and lighted. The
monument bears the following inscription: âThis edifice,
commenced in 1836, was completed in 1839, in the reign
of Louis Philippe.â

Rapid and successful as was the work, it was nevertheless
marked by some accidents. At the commencement of
the campaign of 1836, all the machines were in their
places, and preparations were being made to lay the first
stone, when the whole was swept away by an extraordinary
wave. We have heard the engineer describe the cruel
regret he experienced on arriving at the rock, after having
been separated from it for three days by the tempest, and
discovering all his works prostrated, most of his artificers
wounded, the whole of them demoralized, and in the
midst of the confusion the seamen, who had never been
willing to believe in the feasibility of the matter, laughing
aloud. He did not lose his courage, and skilfully revived
the ardour of his men at the same time that he raised anew
his apparatus. A âcrabâ was planted on the precipitous
rock, at whose foot the barges brought alongside, and the
materials were transported with the assistance of a railway

[243]
laid down on the precipice which separated this natural
landing-place from the site of the tower.

ERECTION OF THE LIGHTHOUSE OF THE HEAUX.

Alone, in the midst of ocean, the lighthouse of the
HÃ©aux of BrÃ©hat acquires, by its very isolation, a character
of severe grandeur which profoundly impresses the voyager.
As Michelet says, it has the sublime simplicity of a
gigantic sea-plant. Enormous, immovable, silent, it
seems, in truth, a defiance flung by the genius of man
in the teeth of the spirit of the storm. Sometimes, says
M. de Quatrefages, you would say that, sensible of the
outrage, the heavens and the sea league together against
the enemy who braves them by its impassability. The
impetuous winds of the north-west roar around the lantern,
and hurl torrents of rain and whirlwinds of hail and snow
against its solid crystal. Under the impulse of their
irresistible breath gigantic billows hurry up from the open
sea, and sometimes reach as high as the first gallery; but
these fluent masses glide over the round polished surface
of the granite, which does not offer them any holding-place;
they even fling long streams of foam above the
cupola, and dash down with a groan on the rocks of
Stallio-Bras or the shingly beach of the Sillon. But
without a quiver the lighthouse supports these terrible
attacks. Yet it bends towards them as if to render
homage to the power of its adversaries. The keepers
have assured me that during a violent tempest, the oil
vessels, placed in one of the highest chambers, show a
variation in level of upwards of an inch, which supposes
that the summit of the tower describes an arc of more
than a yard in extent. For the rest, this very pliancy may
[244]

be regarded as a pledge of durability. At least, we find it
in numerous monuments which have braved for centuries
the inclemencies of the season. The spire of Strasburg
Cathedral, for instance, curves, under the breath of the
winds, its long ogives, and its graceful little columns, and
balances its four-armed cross, elevated 440 feet above the
soil.

The keepers of the lighthouse of the HÃ©aux did not
deceive M. de Quatrefages. Observations made in other
lighthouses, erected in the open sea, confirm the statement
they made to him. If these monuments of human skill
and industry are 130 feet in height and upwards, their
agitation becomes sufficiently perceptible to spill any liquids
in uncovered vessels, to shake the movable weights of the
mechanism, rattle against the sides of the descending
tubes, and, in a word, to suggest to visitors a vivid idea
of the roll of a ship. Towers built after this fashion are,
in fact, reeds of stone which bend before the wind; but,
like the reeds, they raise their heads again as soon as the
hurricane has passed.

[245]

CHAPTER IV.

THE GRAND BARGE DâOLONNE.

A.D. 1861.

We
must not take leave of French oceanic lighthousesâthat
is, of lighthouses built out at
seaâwithout a brief reference to that of the
Grand Barge dâOlonne. Situated on a rock
of shoal about 1.134 nautical miles from the shore, in a
situation surrounded by obstacles of every kind, where the
currents are excessively violent, and where the tempests so
disturb and madden the sea as to render nugatory all
known methods of construction, this lighthouse does the
greatest honour to its architects.

Its foundation is almost completely submerged, and
during high tides the waves leap to a height, it is said, of
100 feet.

The work was undertaken in 1857, and completed in
1861; but such were the difficulties offered by the nature
of the locality, that in these five years only one thousand
nine hundred and sixty hours could be devoted to consecutive
labour. Yet, so familiar are now the principles
[246]

on which edifices of this nature must be constructed, orâto
speak more justlyâso confident in their own resources
are the engineers who devise and erect them,
that even this comparatively brief period proved amply
sufficient.

The entire cost of the work was 450,000 francs, or
Â£18,000. It was executed under the direction of M. Reynaud,
inspector-general, and M. Forestier, engineer-in-chief.
The tower is built of granite, the stones of the face being
mortised and tenoned together; its diameter at the base is
39.37 feet, tapering with a curved outline to 21.23 feet at
the upper part. The door-sill is 13.12 feet above high-water
mark of the highest tides, and up to this level the
tower, with the exception of a cellar for coal and fresh
water, is solid. Above the level the tower is hollow, with
an internal diameter of 11.48 feet, and is divided into five
stories by vaults of brick. The tower has a stout cornice
and parapet of granite. From the centre of its platform
rises the turret, 6.56 feet high, and 8.2 feet in internal
diameter, which supports the lantern. The internal
diameter of the catadioptric illuminating apparatus is 3.28
feet, and gives a white light with red flashes every three
minutes.

The rocky peak on which the âPhare des Bargesâ
stands, rises about one and a half foot above low water
of ordinary spring-tides; but at low water of neap-tides is
covered to the depth of about two feet and a half.

It is situated to the westward of the port of Sables-dâOlonne.

LIGHTHOUSE OF THE ENFANT PERDU (GUIANA).

[249]

CHAPTER V.

THE LIGHTHOUSES OF WALDE, THE ENFANT PERDU, AND
NEW CALEDONIA.

A.D. 1859â1863â1865.

We
have spoken of the patriarch of the French
lighthouses, the venerable Tower of Cordova;
it would be unfair to forget the youngest of
the family, that of New Caledonia. Independently
of the services which it renders in the region it
illuminates, this edifice has, so to speak, a physiognomy of
its own: it is built of iron, and structures of this material
are sufficiently rare to justify us in devoting a few lines to
its description.

Iron is not so suitable as stone for the construction of
lighthouses; it is not so durable, it is more expensive
in working and repairing, and it affords a less efficacious
protection against the thermometrical variations of the
atmosphere. Yet under certain circumstances our engineers
gladly have recourse to it. It has given rise to
various systems of construction. One of these, invented
by Mr. Mitchell, has been successfully applied in several
instances in England; and has been adopted in France for
the lighthouse of Walde, kindled in 1859 to the north of
[250]

Calais, on a sandy shore stretching far out into the sea;
and for the lighthouse erected on the rock of the Enfant
Perdu (coast of Guiana). It consists of iron pillars protected
in the lower part by strong metal screws, strengthened
by cross bars and St. Andrewâs crosses, and surmounted,
at a suitable distance above the sea-level, by a
platform which supports the rooms of the keepers. The
whole erection is crowned by the lantern.

Since we are speaking of this pharos of the Enfant
Perdu, let us say how difficult a task was its construction.
âMore than once,â writes Vivian, the chief engineer of
Cayenne, âit was necessary, in order to fix a running
hawser for landing purposes, that stout and courageous
men should resolutely dash into the sea, and swim with a
rope to the shore. The risk of being flung against the
rocks was not the least they ran, for, as at the bar of the
Senegal, sharks abound in these regions. The ebb and
flow render navigation very difficult; more than one of
the men were wounded, and we may say that all sported
with their lives.â

Yet here, as elsewhere, resolution, industry, and perseverance
have triumphed over every obstacle.

The framework of the pharos at Port de France, New
Caledonia, like that of the Roches-Douvres, is made up of sixteen
uprights, each composed of fourteen pannels. Each
pannel is formed of T irons, consolidated and riveted together
in such a manner as to be perfectly firmâan object fully
attained, for the oscillations experienced in lighthouses of
stone are in this scarcely discernible. These pannels are
pinned one upon another, while cross bars applied both within
[251]

and without, and likewise
pinned, keep the uprights
in their position. Finally,
on these latter cross bars,
and on the inner sides of
the uprights, rest the plates
of sheet iron constituting
the walls, or sides, whose
joints are covered by iron
platbands, fixed by bolts.

The height of the New
Caledonia lighthouse is 164
feet, or 170 feet if we measure
from the base of the
tower to the point of the
lightning-conductor. Its
apparatus is of the first class,
lenticular, with a fixed white
light, whose range is twenty-two
miles. The spot on
which it is raised is an
island of sand, such as the
coral animals form in so
great and dangerous a number
in the southern seas, and
is situated to the south-west
of Noumea.

LIGHTHOUSE AT NEW CALEDONIA.

Constructed at Paris, and
transported in pieces to the
Antipodes, the pharos of
[252]

New Caledonia was inaugurated on the 15th of November
1865, with all the ceremonial appropriate to so important
an event. After the benediction of the monument by the
priests of Noumea, M. the Commandant Guillain pronounced
a discourse, from which we extract the following passage:â

âIf, transporting ourselves in thought into the different
regions of the civilized world, we examine the events transpiring
there, the most magnificent panorama is unrobed
before our eyes. Everywhere,âand this will be the glory
of our epoch,âeverywhere, great works are being executed
to bring the peoples together, to multiply their relations,
to prepare, in a word, that universal brotherhood, destined
and reserved by Providence for future generations.â

The savages, attracted by the brilliancy of the festival,
mingled with the French soldiers, seamen, and colonists.
Did they understand this wise and noble speech? We
fear not. But Time marches onward for them as for us,
and Time, which has already destroyed their horrible custom
of cannibalism, will one day explain its full meaning
to them. Nor is this glorious epoch far remote; wherever
beams the lighthouse-lamps, the sails of rich argosies
whiten the horizon, wafted from sea to sea by the powerful
impulses of civilization!

THE AUXILIARIES OF LIGHTHOUSES.

CHAPTER I.

FLOATING LIGHTS: LIGHTSHIPS.

Lighthouses
form the
first
line of the coast
defences which man raises for his protection
against the fury of the ocean. But there are
many parts of the coasts of every maritime
country which are unsuitable for their construction, whether
they be built of stone or iron, and which, nevertheless,
stand greatly in need of illumination. In England, especially,
these points are numerous. Among others, we
may refer to the Goodwin Sandsâthat fatal tract off the
shore of Kent which has been the destruction of so many
âtall shipsâ and âadventurous mariners,â whose name has
for centuries been associated with the memory of the most
deplorable disasters. On the entire coast of England there
is probably no other locality so fatally connected with dismal
stories of human suffering, and yet it was long impossible
[254]

to warn the sailor from it by any certain agency. Lighthouses
could not be stationed on its shifting sands; and it
seemed as if this one wild waste must of necessity be abandoned
to the pitiless winds and not more compassionate
seas. However, towards the close of the last century, the
idea occurred to one Robert Hamblin of substituting
floating lights for fixed lightsâa light
ship
for a light
house
.

Robert Hamblin was an experienced and reputable
barber of Lynn, who had married the daughter of a shipowner
of that busy little seaport, and in due time had
become master of a vessel. He was engaged in the coasting
tradeâin carrying coal from Newcastle to other portsâand
was thus well enabled to judge of the inadequate
manner in which the eastern coast was lighted. Accident,
after a time, introduced him to a man whose brain was
full of grand projects, but who was cruelly hampered by
povertyâDavid Avery; and the two, combining their resourcesâthe
one finding the money, the other the intellectâestablished
at the Nore a floating light on board a ship,
and assumed a right of levying tolls for the maintenance
of this new pharos (
A.D.
1732).

It was impossible that the Trinity House could regard
this assumption as other than an infraction of their legal
privileges, though they were compelled to own that the
lightship was successful, and that it proved of great
assistance in the navigation of the intricate estuary of the
Thames. Encouraged by the triumphant issue of his experiment,
Avery boldly announced his design of placing a
similar vessel among the waters of the Scilly Islands. The
[255]

corporation of the Trinity House, in their capacity of protectors
of British commerce, then laid a complaint before the
Lords of the Admiralty; who, however, were either unwilling
or unable to act. They next addressed themselves
to the Crown, representing that it was illegal for any private
individual to levy a tax on the mercantile marine;
and acted with so much energy as to obtain a royal
proclamation prohibiting the light at the Nore. Avery,
whose schemes of acquiring almost boundless wealth were
thus rudely broken up, appeared in person before the
Board, and proposed to treat with them in reference to the
Nore light. He asserted that he had expended a sum of
Â£2000; and his offer was, that all right and title to the
floating ship should remain for ever in the hands of the
Trinity House, but that the tolls should be levied by him
and his heirs for a period of sixty-one years, on payment
of a yearly sum of Â£100. These terms were accepted.
[56]

Such, briefly told, was the origin of
Lightships
.

The lightship, be it understood, is not employed only
to indicate the position of a sand-bank, but as a beacon
against perfidious currents, submarine whirlpools, or reefs
which are hidden at certain hours by the high tide. We
borrow from the lively pages of M. Esquiros a sketch of
this most useful vessel:â

âWhen first seen, and especially if seen from a distance,
a lightship closely resembles during the day an ordinary
barque. But if examined from a nearer point of view, a
very great difference between the two is readily discernible.
The lightship floats, but it does not move; its short stout
[256]

masts are without sails, and surmounted by large balls.
Other ships represent motion; this, immobility. We
ask of vessels, as a rule, that they shall obey the wind
and the wave; we ask of the lightship that it shall resist
them. What, indeed, would happen if it drifted before
the gale? Like a meteor, the wandering light would
deceive the pilot, instead of warning him. A ship which
does not navigateâa fixed and fettered ship;âsuch is
the ideal which the builder of the light-vessel keeps ever
before his mind; and this ideal has naturally troubled the
imagination of naval architects in more than one direction.

The form of the lightship varies according to its locality:
in Ireland the hull is more elongated than in England;
but in all cases the object to be attained is the sameâresistance
to the force of the winds and waves. It is
desired that in the most violent tides, in the midst of the
angriest billows, and in situations the most exposed to the
influence of the currents, it shall drag as little as possible
upon its anchor. That it may at all times and in all conditions
preserve the same maritime position, it is securely
moored. Like a galley-slave, riveted to an iron chain, it
can move neither to the right nor to the left. The length
of its cable is, of course, regulated by circumstances: at
the Seven Stones, where it rides in 240 feet deep of water,
it measures upwards of a third of a mile in length. Some
years ago it was found that the addition of certain ingenious
shackles (so to speak) controlled its movements; and
by various improvements in its construction, the result has
been obtained that, slave though it be, it shall weigh as
little as possible on its mooring-chains. Usually, the
moorings consist of a chain lying along the sea-bed for
[257]

1260 feet, with an anchor of 32 cwt., in the shape of a
mushroom at either end, and a swivel in the centre, to
which is attached a veering cable of 630 feet of chain.

THE LIGHTSHIP.

Few instances are on record of a lightship having
broken loose from its moorings, and none of its having
suffered shipwreck. Each vessel carries, for emergencies,
two bower anchors of 20 cwt. and 15 cwt.; and cables
respectively 1260 and 900 feet long. Nor is it known that
the crew have, on any occasion, or whatever the fury of the
tempest, voluntarily changed their position. If, however, the
ship should be driven from its place by the irresistible force
of the elements, so that its light may become a source of
danger to the mariner, they hoist a red signal and fire
a gun, and generally it is soon restored to its normal
situation. The peril of drifting, and the presence of mind
[258]

which the necessary manÅuvres require in such an event,
are evidences, nevertheless, of the courage and resolution
of the men who live, day and night, exposed to the caprice
of the seas. As it is necessary to prepare for every accident,
a spare vessel is always held in readiness at the headquarters
of each district; owing to the telegraphic network
which now surrounds our shores, the slightest mishap is
soon made known to the authorities; and often before sunset
the reserve ship, towed by a powerful steam-tug, occupies
the place of the vessel which the storm has driven
from its moorings. The lightships of the Trinity House
are painted
red
; those of Ireland,
black
. Experiment has
shown that red and black are the two colours which most
vividly contrast with the prevailing hue of the sea. The
name of the vessel is inscribed in large letters on its
sides. A flag, bearing a cross quartered with four
ships, waves at the stern. These are the arms of the
Trinity House.

Our British and Irish lightships numbered fifty-nine in
1870. Each, like the lighthouse on shore, is distinguished
by its own peculiar aspectâby certain differences which
assist the navigator in recognizing it, and, consequently, in
recognizing the particular danger he is called upon to avoid.
Some have one light, some two lights, some three lights.
Of these lights many are fixed, many revolving, many
coloured. The building and equipment of one of these
vessels
[57]
will cost from Â£2000 to Â£3000. Its maintenance,
including the cost of oil, the wages and provisions of the
men, amounts to about Â£1200 per annum.

[259]

The United States stand next to Great Britain in the
number of lightships which they support in the interests
of commercial enterprise. At one time, however, their
organization was very indifferent; but of later years the
system followed in England has been adopted with a few
unimportant modifications. The American ships are
painted in longitudinal stripes of varied colours. In very
bad weather they frequently quit their posts, and return
into harbour.

France has fewer lightships than either Great Britain or
America, and only
five
whose burthen exceeds seventy
tons.

Let us now say a few words in reference to the resolute
crews who man these vessels.

The crew of an English lightship consists of a master, a
mate, and nine men. Three out of the nine are intrusted
with the service of the lamps; the six others, who always
include among them a good carpenter, attend to the order
and cleanliness of the vessel. It must be remembered,
however, that the nine men are never all on board together;
one-third are always enjoying an interval of rest on
shore. Experience has proved that a perpetual sojourn
on board a ship of this kind is too much for the moral and
physical forces of human nature. The crushing monotony
of the same scenes, the eternal spectacle of foam-crested
waters rolling wherever the eye is turned, the ceaseless
noise of the winds, the everlasting murmur of the oceanâswelling
at times into so terrible a roar that it renders
inaudible the human voiceâcould not fail to exercise a
depressing influence on the mind. But even allowing for
[260]

the occasional vacation spent upon land, the life is so uniform
and unexciting that it is wonderful any man can be
found to endure it; and the crews of our lightships may
assuredly be ranked among the curiosities of civilization.

To mitigate the rigours of so strange a profession, the
Trinity Board provides that each man shall pass one month
on shore for every two months he spends on board; while
the captain and the mate change places every month.
But grim old Neptune does not always permit this system
of reliefs to be regularly carried out. It often happens
in winter that the storm and the tide are opposed to every
kind of disembarkation; and between the lightship and
the Scilly Islands, for instance, weeks elapse before the
communication can be re-established. The men ashore
are occupied in cleaning cables, painting buoys, filling the
oil tins, and similar duties. We know not whether what
was acknowledged by an old lightship âhandâ is true of all;
that all the time he was on land, he dreamed of the sea;
all the time he was on board the lightship, he dreamed
of the land.

The visitor of an English lightship cannot fail to be
struck with its admirable condition, and with the fine appearance
of its crew. Sun-tanned and weather-beaten,
they are models of English sailors: frank, self-reliant,
unassuming, obedient, nimble, vigorous, and resolute.
They seem well-contented with their lot, and if they complain
at all, it is of the quantity and quality of their provisions.
The ration of bread (seven pounds a week) is not
quite sufficient for hearty men, and I confess, from my
own experience, that the sharp air to which they are exposed
is well adapted to whet oneâs appetite. When they
[261]

are at sea, their food is supplied by the Trinity House;
when on shore, they receive instead one shilling and threepence
a day. Their wages are fifty-five shillings per
month; the master receives Â£80 per annum.

Two men at a time are charged with the care of the
lamps, the third being on shore; one of these two performs
for a month the functions of a cook. Formerly, if
we may believe public rumour, the lightship crews, isolated
by continual tempests which rendered the sea impracticable,
have been reduced to the extremest necessities,
have even perished of hunger. To prevent the recurrence
of such calamities, a steamboat or a good stout sailing-vessel
regularly visits the lightship once a month. In the
worst weather the communication is never interrupted for a
longer period than six weeks, and the stock of provisions
is always sufficient to last the crew for even a longer time.

The lanterns in which the lamps are fixed are hung
round the mast; during the day they are lowered on deck
that they may be cleaned, and supplied afresh with oil;
at night, this crown of lights is raised to its conspicuous
position by means of a pulley. The ship is also provided
with some small cannon and a gong. But, unfortunately,
these signals are not always comprehended by foreign ships.

The crew of the Scilly lightship, says Esquiros, have
witnessed but two shipwrecks; in the one instance, they
saved a single life; in the other, all the passengers, with
the exception of the wife of a missionary. It is not, however,
a part of their duty to go to the rescue of vessels in
danger; and if the authorities admire, for obvious reasons
they do not encourage such acts of heroism. Their sole
and all-absorbing duty is to take care of the light. The
[262]

discipline to which they are subjected is severe, and no
man may quit his post under any pretence whatever. A
sailor, in 1854, having been informed of his wifeâs death,
deserted the lightship, and repaired to London to attend
her funeral. He was reprimanded, and it was only in
consideration of the motive which had induced his absence
that the authorities refrained from discharging him. The
lightship of the Seven Stones, off the Scilly Islands, is the
most exposed of all the vessels on the British coast;
[58]
its
captain, however, considers that it rides much more easily
on its anchors in a sea where waves are long and regular,
than those ships which are moored in seas with short and
contrary waves. He will tell you that his gallant barque
is always ready for the tempest. And yet its deck is
sometimes washed by the waves, and when the sea strikes
against its broadside, the roar is like the discharge of a
piece of artillery.

On board every lightship the life of the crew is much
the same. On Sunday, at dawn, the lantern is lowered,
and the lamp-lighter cleans and prepares his lamps for the
next nightâs work. At eight oâclock everybody must be
on the alert; the hammocks are hung up, and breakfast
is served. Afterwards, the men wash and put on their
uniform, of which they are very proud, for on its buttons
figure the arms of the Trinity House. At half-past ten
they assemble in the cabin, and the captain or mate performs
divine service. At sunset the lighted lantern is
hoisted upâthe real standard of the vesselâand the crew
[263]

again meet together for prayer and the reading of the
Scriptures. With the exception of the morning and evening
services, the week-days close resemble the Sundays.
Wednesday and Friday are the chief cleaning days, and the
ship then shines with cleanliness. To watch over, and
maintain in due order, the lighting apparatus; to keep
watch on deck; to note seven times in every twenty-four
hours the conditions of the wind and atmosphere; to
attend to the condition of the mooring-chains;âsuch is the
almost invariable circle of their occupations. Their leisure
time, which is not inconsiderable, they employ in reading.
A library is always kept on board, and the books are
circulated from hand to hand, and ship to ship. Under
such circumstances how miserable would be the condition
of a man who could neither read nor write! Yet such is
sometimes the case with a few on first entering the service;
but whether it be the force of example, or the necessity of
overcoming the oppressive ennui of idle hours, it generally
happens that, with the assistance of the captain or mate,
they more or less repair this absolute want of education.
One of the best officers of the company is a man who
taught himself reading and writing in order that he might
obtain an engagement on board a lightship. The seamen
also devote their leisure to all kinds of ingenious manual
work, and some of them set to work as shoemakers, joiners,
tailors, wood-carvers, and the like.

[264]

CHAPTER II.

LANDMARKS, BEACONS, AND BUOYS.

To
complete our account of the defences of our
coast, we must refer to works of less pretension
than lighthouses and lightships, and of less
utility, though still of very considerable importance.
They present themselves under various forms,
and they have different names, according to their respective
positions and objects.
[59]

Let us first direct our attention to landmarks and
beacons; by which, in nautical language, we mean every
terrestrial object that assists the seaman in calculating his
data, and determining his course. The spires of churches,
the towers of castles, windmills, tall isolated trees, or rocks
of a characteristic configuration, are useful for this purpose.
Solitary peaks, like that of Teneriffeâvolcanoes surmounted
by a canopy of smokeâare gigantic landmarks which assist
the navigator in rectifying his geographical position.

Among the very numerous class of landmarks we meet
with a few as celebrated as, or even more celebrated than,
[265]

the majority of our lighthouses. Such are the Pillars of
Herculesâanciently designated the Columns of Saturn or
of Briareusâand Pompeyâs Pillar, near Alexandria.
One thing is wanting, however, to the glory of the Pillars
of Herculesâthat they should have existed. Hesychius,
nevertheless, asserts that there were three or four, while,
according to Edrisi, six were placed on the sea-coast; the
easternmost at Cadiz, in Andalusia; the others in the
islands of the Shadowy Seas, as a warning to navigators
not to advance beyond them. But Strabo, when speaking
of the foundation of Cadiz by the Tyrians, puts forward
some doubts as to the accuracy of this statement, and his
doubts seem not to have been ill-founded. We believe
with him that these famous Pillars of Hercules existed
only in the imagination of the writers of antiquity, who
were frequently as enthusiastic in belief of fable as of truth.

The best known sites of the pillars, whether they were
real or fabulous, were at Calpe, on the European shore of
the Straits of Gibraltar, and at Abyla, on the African. But

what
the pillars were, none of the ancient authorities are
agreed. According to Strabo, some believed them to be
rocky headlands, others, islands; the former rising up from
the land, the latter starting out of the sea, like gigantic
columns. Others, again, understanding the word
ÏÏá¿Î»Î±Î¹

literally, looked for artificial mounds, or columns, or statues,
which Hercules himself had erected to indicate the limit of
his conquests, or the PhÅnician navigators had dedicated
to their tutelary deity, to record the extent of their
discoveries.
[60]
Strabo informs us that this literal interpretation
[266]

was held by the Iberians and Libyans, who denied
that there existed at the Straits anything resembling
columns, but pointed out, as the Pillars of Hercules,
the bronze columns in the temple of the god at Gades,
on which the expenses of building the temple were
inscribed. He adds that this opinion was held by Poseidonius,
in opposition to the Greeks in general, who considered
the pillars to mean
promontories
.

A monument not less famous, and whose existence
cannot be doubted, inasmuch as it still answers the purpose
of a landmark, is the so-called Pompeyâs Pillar, at Alexandria.
This structure is the first object to attract the eye
when you approach the classic shores of Egypt; from afar
it dominates over the town, the minarets, the obelisks, and
the lighthouse.

Pompeyâs Pillarâthe
Amood Ã© sowari
of the Arabsâoccupies
the summit of a dreary, solitary mound, which
overlooks the Lake Mareotis and the modern city of Alexandria.
It may be described as a handsome and stately
Corinthian column; the shaft, a monolith of red granite,
73 feet in height; the total height, including capital and
base, 98 feet 9 inches; the circumference, 29 feet 8 inches.
Its history is involved in considerable obscurity. The
Arab chronicler, Abdallatif, represents it to be the sole remaining
pillar of the four hundred which once adorned
and enclosed the celebrated Serapeion, or Temple of
Serapis; the Portico, where Aristotle expounded his
philosophical theories; the Academy, which Alexander
erected when he founded the city, and where the great
library was placedâthe glory of Alexandriaâerroneously

[269]
said to have been destroyed by order of the Caliph
Omar.

COLUMN AT ALEXANDRIA (
Known as Pompeyâs Pillar
).

The Serapeion was razed to the ground at the instigation
of a furious zealot, the patriarch Theophilus. Its
columns were rent and shattered, and finally piled up, as a
break-water, on the sea-shoreâall save the one stately
pillarâthe loftiest of the four hundredâthe âpillar of
the colonnades,â as the Arabs emphatically termed itâwhich
is still the cynosure of European pilgrims. This
was re-erected by Publius or Pompius, prefect of Egypt,
and a new capital and base were provided for it; the whole
being dedicated, as an inscription on its pedestal records,
in honour of the Emperor Diocletian, âthe Invincible,â
and in commemoration of the deliverance of Alexandria
from the insurgent bonds of the pretender Achilleus
(
A.D.
297).

The summit may either have been crowned with a
statue, or have simply assisted in sustaining the cupola of
the Serapeion.

Pompeyâs Pillarâas, in defiance of history, men still
continue to call itâstands to-day in a wild and dreary
wasteâwidely different from the scene that surrounded it
when, of old, the Nile swarmed with gilded barges, and
the waters of the Mediterranean were ploughed by countless
argosies, and the flickering glare of the pharos was
the guiding star of the commerce of the world. You reach
it, as Miss Martineau tells us, through the dreariest of
cemeteries, where all is of one dust colour, even to the aloe
which is fixed upon every grave. From the base, the view
is curious to novices. Groups of Arabs are at work in the
crumbling, whitish, hot soil, with files of soldiers keeping
[270]

watch over them. To the south-east you obtain a fine
view of Lake Mareotis, whose slender line of shore seems
liable to be broken through by the first ripple of its waters.
The space between it and the sea is one expanse of desolation.
A strip of vegetationâsome marsh, some field, and
some groveâlooks well near the lake; and so do a little
settlement on the canal, and a lateen sail gliding among
the trees.

As commerce increased, and flowed into fresh channels,
men very naturally multiplied on every coast the landmarks
which played the same useful part by day as did
the pharoses by night. If we may believe Coulier, we
owe to the Etruscans the invention of that system of
beacons which, neglected for many centuries, has been
resuscitated of late years, and developed according to fixed
principles. Where natural landmarks are non-existent, we
now-a-days rear small but durable constructions of timber
or masonry, at suitable points of the shore, painting them
of a brown colour if they stand defined against the sky,
as on the summit of a lofty hill, or of a white colour, if
they are projected on the land. When it is desirable to
indicate the position of a submarine reef, on whose hidden
point a good many ships might otherwise go down, a
buoy

is placed thereâthat is, a floating frame-work of iron or
wood, with or without a bell, and painted of various
colours. Some of these buoys, as in the channel of a
river or the water-way of a harbour, are hollow cones of
iron, kept in their positions by stout cables and a heavy
anchor. Others, of larger dimensions, resemble a kind of
cage; not a few are built up of masonry, where the water

[273]
is shallow, like small turrets; and these are provided with
chains and ladders for the convenience of shipwrecked seamen.
The floating buoys are generally furnished with
great bells, which are swung to and fro with a solemn and
overpowering peal, by the oscillations of the waves.
âBeware! beware!â they seem to cry; but, alas! their
warning sounds are often heard too late, and the âtall
ship,â swept onward by the demon of the storm, frequently
clashes against the very buoy that gave warning of the
danger.

A FLOATING BEACON OR BUOY.

As a general rule, the buoys in a river channel are painted
red, striped with white, if the homeward-bound vessel is to
leave them on the right; and black, when she has to pass
them on the left. Others are painted with horizontal
stripes of red and black, or in squares and diamonds,
according to the various purposes they are intended to
serve. Obstacles, such as wrecks, are marked by green
buoys.

A buoy, recently invented by Mr. Hubert, and adopted
by the Trinity Board, is so constructed, with regard to the
centre of flotation, and the point where the mooring-chain
is attached, that it will keep upright in almost any
weather.

Another buoy, invented by Messrs. Brown and Lenox,
is ingeniously contrived to render its
bell
audible even
when the buoy itself is not visible; the stream of water
passing through the lower part of the framework keeps in
motion an undershot water-wheel, which incessantly rings
the bell.

The average size of the buoys now in use is about
eight feet, but many are of larger dimensions; and some,
[274]

like North-east Spit Buoy, at the east end of Margate
Sand, are twenty feet. Various plans for lighting them
have been suggested, but with no very successful result.
The only felicitous instance is that of the Arnish Beacon
on the north coast of Scotland; it consists of a cone of
cast-iron plates, surmounted with a lantern containing a
glass prism. The prism is illuminated by a light directed
upon it from Stornaway Lighthouse; and so perfect is the
deception that the fishermen long refused to believe there
was not a real light on the beacon.

THE ARNISH BEACON.

Nearly a thousand buoys are posted about the coast of
England and in the channels of her principal rivers.
Scotland and Ireland have about two hundred each.
These bear their own particular denominations, forming a
very diversified and somewhat amusing vocabulary. We
find amongst them an âEagle,â a âGull,â a âSwallow,â
a âHorse,â a âMussel,â a âFirefly;â also a âCutler,â a
[275]

âConstable,â a âColumbine,â and a âFairy;â a âRoyal
Sovereign,â a âProtector;â and a âTongue,â an âElbow,â
and a âLongnose.â

The position of every buoy on the British coast is verified
once a quarter; and every half-yearâthat is, in March
and Septemberâall buoys, except the largest, are âshifted,â
being replaced by clean ones. After a certain period of
immersion they lose their brilliancy of colour, and become
encrusted with salt, as well as with organic matter.
âBuoy-shifting,â says a recent writer, âis a duty which
calls forth all the skill and energy of the officers and men
comprising the crews of the Trinity House vessels, for the
buoys are mostly placed to indicate the position of dangerous
shoals, and not unfrequently the change is effected
under very inauspicious circumstances. The buoys brought
in are carefully examined, and if fit for further use, repainted
and repaired.â

The cost of a buoy varies, according to its size, from
twenty-five to two hundred and fifty pounds.

[276]

BOOK VI.

LIFE IN THE LIGHTHOUSE.

CHAPTER I.

THE LIGHTHOUSE-KEEPERS.

The
life of a lighthouse-keeper is not without a
certain monotony; but it must be greatly
cheered by the reflection that it is devoted to
a high and holy service. There is about it a
certain heroic simplicityâit is so completely separated
from the commonplace aims and concerns of the work-day
world; and it is characterized, moreover, by an austere
regularity which reminds one of the existence formerly led
in grotto and cavern by saint and hermit, though its end
is much more useful, and it is in itself of far greater
value to mankind.

The first article of the instructions which every lighthouse-keeper
is bound to obeyâand to obey as implicitly
as a soldier obeys the articles of warâruns thus:â

[277]

âYou are to light the lamps every evening at sun-setting,
and keep them constantly burning, bright and clear,
till sun-rising.â

This is the primary condition of a lighthouse-keeperâs
duty: for this he lives, for this he toils, for this he
watchesâthat the helpful flame which has been the salvation
of so many lives may steadily glow and brightly burn
from sunset until sunrise.

âWhatever else happens,â remarks a lively writer,
[61]

âhe is to do this. He may be isolated through the long
night-watches, twenty miles from land, fifty or a hundred
feet above the level of the sea, with the winds and waves
howling round him, and the sea-birds dashing themselves
to death against the gleaming lantern, like giant moths
against a candle; or it may be a calm, voluptuous, moonlight
night, the soft air laden with the perfumes of the
Highland heather or the Cornish gorse, tempting him to
keep his watch outside the lantern, in the open gallery,
instead of in the watch-room chair within; the Channel
may be full of stately ships, each guided by his light; or
the horizon may be bare of all signs of life, except, remote
and far beneath him, the lantern of some fishing-boat at
sea: but whatever may be going on outside, there is
within for him the duty, simple and easy, by virtue of his
moral method and orderly training, âto light the lamps
every evening at sun-setting, and keep them constantly
burning, bright and clear, till sun-rising.ââ

That this great article of the lighthouse-keeperâs faith
may be the more easily carried out, he is subjected, both
when on probation and afterwards, to a strict discipline,
and is required to gain a thorough acquaintance with all
[278]

the materials he has to handleâlamps, oil, wicks, lighting
apparatus, and revolving machinery. Before being admitted
into the service, he is carefully examined as to his
physical qualities by keen medical eyes; and as to his
moral qualities, the best testimonials are necessary from
persons in whose competency and honesty of judgment
implicit confidence can be placed. He receives liberal
wages, and, when past work, a fair pension; and a deduction
from his pay is regularly applied to the discharge of
a premium on his life insurance. He is enjoined to âthe
constant habit of cleanliness and good order in his own
person, and to the invariable exercise of temperance and
morality in his habits and proceedings; so that, by his
example, he may enforce, as far as lies in his power, the
observance of the same laudable conduct by his wife and
family.â The utmost vigilance is expected of him when
it is his turn to attend to the lantern. âHe whose watch
is about to end is to trim the lamps, and leave them burning
in perfect order, before he quits the lantern and calls
the succeeding watch; and he who has the watch at sunrise,
when he has extinguished the lamps, is to commence
all necessary preparations for the exhibition of the light at
the ensuing sunset.â No bed, sofa, or other article on
which to recline, is permitted, either in the lantern or in
the apartment under the lantern known as the watch-room.

From these requirements we may infer what kind of
life is led by the lighthouse-keeper, and what are its
leading requisites: temperance, cleanliness, honesty, conscientiousness,
zeal, watchfulness. At different stations it
varies considerably in its lighter occupations. In the rock
[279]

lighthouseâsuch as the Eddystoneâthe keeperâs chief
amusements are necessarily reading and fishing: the only
capability of exercise is within the circle of the outer gallery,
or on the belt of rock surrounding the lighthouse
base; and the sole incidents which break up the uniformity
of his daily life are the inspections of the committee,
the visits of the district superintendent, or the monthly
relief which takes the men back to shore. In the shore
lighthouseâas at Harwich or the Forelandsâthere is a
plot of ground to cultivate, frequent intercourse with
visitors from the neighbouring watering-places, and the
wider range of occupation and entertainment which necessarily
can be enjoyed upon
terra firma
.

As a rule, the public take but little interest in the
economy of our lighthouses; and yet there is something
singularly romantic in the idea of the lone tower encircled
by boiling waters, with its warning light flashing through
the deep night shadows, and the heroic men who hour
after hour watch with anxious care lest its radiance should
be obscured or extinguished.

âAnd as the evening darkens, lo! how bright,

Through the deep purple of the twilight air,

Beams forth the sudden radiance of its light

With strange, unearthly splendour in its glare!

âNot one alone: from each projecting cape

And perilous reef along the oceanâs verge,

Starts into life a dim, gigantic shape,

Holding its lantern oâer the restless surge.

âLike the great giant Christopher it stands

Upon the brink of the tempestuous wave;

Wading far out among the rocks and sands,

The night-oâertaken mariner to save.

âAnd the great ships sail outward and return,

Bending and bowing oâer the billowy swells;

And ever joyful, as they see it burn,

They wave their silent welcomes and farewells.
[280]

âThey come forth from the darkness, and their sails

Gleam for a moment only in the blaze;

And eager faces, as the light unveils,

Gaze at the tower, and vanish while they gaze.

âThe mariner remembers when a child,

On his first voyage, he saw it fade and sink;

And when, returning from adventures wild,

He saw it rise again oâer oceanâs brink.

âSteadfast, serene, immovable, the same

Year after year, through all the silent night,

Burns on for evermore that quenchless flame,

Shines on that inextinguishable light!

ââSail on!â it says, âsail on, ye stately ships!

And with your floating bridge the ocean span;

Be mine to guard this light from all eclipse,

Be yours to bring man nearer unto man!ââ
[62]

As a proof of the romance that formerly invested lighthouse
life, we may lay before the reader one or two âtrue
stories.â

Off the coast of Northumberland, and outside, so to
speak, of the Farne Islands, lies the Longstoneâa rock
about four feet above high water-mark, and swept by
every gale with fierce drifts of spray and foam. Here,
about six miles from the shore, is planted a lighthouse,
which has been found of great use to the coasting vessels
navigating these dangerous waters. Two-and-thirty years
ago its keeper was named Darling. He had a daughter,
Graceâa quiet, modest, well-behaved girl, whose name,
through one noble action, will for ever be honoured
among women. On a dark night in September 1838 the

Forfarshire
, a Hull steamer, struck on a hidden reef called
the Harcars, in the vicinity of the lighthouse. She had
on board sixty-three persons, including passengers and
crew. Their signals of distress were observed from the
[281]

lighthouse. It was impossible for Darling, the keeper, to
pull off in his boat alone; no single arm could have
impelled it through the raging sea that then prevailed.
With admirable courage, Grace Darling resolved to assist
him on his noble errand. She sprang into the skiff, and
over the bounding billows father and daughter gallantly
made their way. Their lives hung upon a thread; but
the weak girl never bated a jot of heart or hope, and
rowed with all the vigour which a noble enthusiasm is
apt to inspire. They reached the ship, and took off nine
persons, with whom they contrived to regain the lighthouse.
Nine more escaped in one of the steamerâs boats:
all the rest perished.

Grace Darling did not live many years after the event
which made her famous. She was interred in the old
chapel on Holy Island, and an epitaph to her memory
composed by the poet Wordsworth:â

âThe maiden gentle, yet at dutyâs call

Firm and unflinching, as the lighthouse reared

On the island-rock, her lonely dwelling-place;

Or like the invisible rock itself, that braves,

Age after age, the hostile elements,

As when it guarded holy Cuthbertâs cell.â

Smeaton speaks of a shoemaker who entered the Eddystone
Lighthouse because he longed for a solitary life: he
found himself less a prisoner on his wave-beaten rock than
in his close and confined workshop. When some of his
friends expressed their astonishment at his choiceââEach
to his taste,â said he; âI have always been partial to
independence.â

Perhaps it was the same individual who, after having
served at the Eddystone upwards of fourteen years, conceived
so strong an attachment to his prison that for
[282]

two consecutive years he gave up his turn of relief. He
would fain have continued the same course of life for a
third year, but so much pressure was brought to bear
upon him that he consented to avail himself of the usual
privilege. All the years he had spent in the lighthouse
he had been distinguished for his quiet and orderly behaviour;
on land he found himself âout of his element,â
and drank until he was completely intoxicated. In this
condition he was carried back to the Eddystone, where,
after languishing for a few days, he expired.

Some men have gone mad, or nearly so, by dint of contemplating
the same scenes and the same external impressions.
About a mile and a quarter from the Landâs End,
on a group of granite islets washed by the sea, stands the

Longships Lighthouse
, constructed in 1793. The particular
rock on which it is builtâthe Carn-Brasârises about
forty-five feet above the level of low water. In winter
both the rock and the buildingâas is the case at the
Eddystoneâwill sometimes be covered for a few seconds
by the leaping waters, which have even been known to
surmount the lantern, and, on one occasion at least, to
break through its crystal walls and extinguish the lamps.

One day, in 1862, two black flags floated from the
summit of the tower. They were evidently intended as a
signal of distress. What, then, had happened?

EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE IN A STORM.

Of the three men who inhabited the lighthouse, the one
whose turn it was to keep watch had thrust a knife into
his breast. His companions attempted to stanch the
blood by plugging up the wound with bits of tow. Three
days passed by before the people on shore could reach the
lighthouse; and the sea was then so rude and disembarkation

[285]
so dangerous that the wounded man had to be lowered
into the boat, suspended from a kind of impromptu
crane. When he was conveyed ashore he received every
attention which his condition demanded; but he lived
only a few days. The jury, acting upon the evidence of
his companions, declared that he had committed suicide
under an attack of temporary insanity. Perhaps it is not
astonishing that persons of a susceptible or excitable temperament
should, under the influence of ever-murmuring
seas and ever-blowing winds, and while living in a state
of almost continual solitude and comparative monotony, feel
the vertigo of the abyss ascend to their brain, so that the
control of reason is loosened, and the mind yields to the
first impulse which passes over it.

Let us now take a glance at lighthouse life from a
French point of view.

Sagacious regulations and constant inspection have
banished the dramatic and the surprising from the French
as well as from the English lighthouse. Everything has
been reduced to a system, and the keepers are under a
discipline scarcely less rigid than that of soldiers. In
France, indeed, veteran soldiers or tried seamen are generally
selected to fill up any vacancies that may occur in
the lighthouse administration. This is divided into two
classes: the inspectors, who receive a thousand francs
yearly (about Â£40), and are intrusted with the superintendence
of several lighthouses; and the keepers, who are
divided into six classes, and whose annual wages vary
from 475 to 850 francs (say Â£18 to Â£34). Extra payment
is awarded to those who serve in the sea lighthouses.
[286]

Their number is never less than three in a lighthouse of
the first class, or two in those of the second and third
class lighthouses.

The âcode,â so to speak, from which we borrow these
details is nearly the same among all maritime nations.
It indicates to the keepers their duties, and prescribes to
them the nature of their daily work. As for their mode of
life, it is much the same everywhere, only more or less
agreeable according to the stations. In France the lighthouses
served by a single keeper are intrusted to married
men, who live in the establishment with their family.
Not only does such an arrangement ameliorate their lot,
but it also gives the assurance that in case of need they
will immediately be replaced in attendance on the lampâa
task so easy that it can be discharged by a woman or
even by a child. The habitation allotted to them consists
of one or two apartments, with a chimney, an outhouse,
and sometimes a cellar. A green and a small garden are
invariably attached. In some lighthouses the keeperâs
house is so placed with reference to the tower that the
lamp is visible from one of the windows; but in most the
house is annexed to the tower, in such a manner that if
the keeper is compelled to rise and attend to the lamp,
at least he is not exposed, immediately after leaving his
couch, to the rigour, it may be, of a winter night.

In lenticular lights of the first, second, and third class,
whose flame requires surveillance throughout the night,
several keepers are needed, who take their watch in turn.
Formerly the keepers and their families lodged together.
[287]

But, unfortunately, those dissensions which seem inevitable
when a colony is numerous, and not amenable to a strict
discipline, were found to break out at very short intervals,
and in an exceedingly disagreeable manner. The authorities,
therefore, resolved only to admit their own servants
into the interior of the lighthouses, leaving to them, if
married, the care of securing suitable lodgings for their
wives and children. To each keeper a room was allotted,
and the kitchen was common to all.

The result they had in view was thus obtained. But
it was soon perceived that to separate the keepers from
their families was to impose a heavy tax upon men whose
pay was not too liberal; that to deprive them of the sweet
domestic joys which are the legitimate reward of the cares
and anxieties of paternity, was to increase the gloominess
of their isolation, by rendering it more complete; and,
finally, to expose them to the strong temptation of absenting
themselves from the lighthouse at the hours their
presence was most necessary. These inconveniences have
been remedied by allotting to each keeper a separate house
for himself and his family.

It is, of course, impossible that a keeperâs family should
be accommodated in a sea lighthouse, which consists of a
single tower. They are, therefore, lodged on shore, near
the port which keeps up the communication between the
lighthouse and the mainland. In such a station life to many
minds would be wearisome and monotonous. The wind
sometimes blows with so much violence that the keepers
can with difficulty breathe. They are then compelled to
shut themselves up, as closely as possible, in a tower
darkened by the wreathing fog, or by the foam of swelling
[288]

waves, which envelopes it like a rent veil. On fine summer
days, like the English light-keepers, they amuse themselves
with fishing. If their abode is not encircled by
rocks on which they can stretch their lines, they knot
around the lighthouse tower, at a certain height, and immediately
above the entrance, a stout rope, suspending
some forty or fifty lines, each about four feet long. When
the sea rises, the fish crawl along the wall, and snapping
at the bait, are immediately hooked. The tide goes down,
and lo, the tower is wreathed round with a complete
festoon of fish!

Thus, then, the life of a lighthouse-keeper varies little,
whether his post be situated on the English or the French
shore, on a rock washed by English or by French waters,
in the Mediterranean or the North Atlantic. It is a life
not free from heavy shadows; but it is one eminently
calculated to develop the patient and enduring qualities
of a man, and to cultivate in him a habit of self-reflection.
I do not think it should be stigmatized as dismal, though
it is the fashion so to speak of it; but surely no life
can

be dismal which is spent in the service of humanity, in
steadfast devotion to the interests of others; no life
can
be
dismal which passes in constant contemplation of all the
glories of the sky and all the splendours of the seaâin
constant contemplation of the mightiest and sublimest
of Godâs works under their grandest and most solemn
aspects!

II.

A NIGHT IN A LIGHTSHIP.

While these sheets were passing through the press there appeared
in the
Scotsman
a graphic and interesting sketch of âA Night
in the Gull Lightship, off the Goodwin Sands,â from the able and
popular pen of Mr. R. M. Ballantyne (March 26, 1870). The following
extracts cannot fail to be acceptable to the reader:â

âA little before midnight on Thursday (the 24th), while I was rolling uneasily
in my âbunk,â contending with sleep and sea-sickness, and moralising on
the madness of those who choose âthe seaâ for a profession, I was rousedâand
sickness instantly curedâby the watch on deck suddenly shouting down
the hatchway to the mate, âSouthsand-Head light is firing, sir, and sending
up rockets.â The mate sprang from his âbunk,â and was on the cabin floor
before the sentence was well finished. I followed suit, and pulled on coat,
nether garments, and shoes, as if my life depended on my own speed. There
was unusual need for clothing, for the night was bitterly cold. On gaining
the deck, we found the two men on duty actively at workâthe one loading
the lee gun, the other adjusting a rocket to its stick. A few hurried questions
from the mate elicited all that it was needful to know. The flash of a gun from
the Southsand-Head lightship, about six miles distant, had been seen, followed
by a rocket, indicating that a vessel had got upon the fatal Goodwins. While
the men spoke, I saw the bright flash of another gun, but heard no reportâowing
to the gale carrying the sound to leeward. A rocket followed, and at
the same moment we observed the light of the vessel in distress just on the
southern tail of the Sands. By this time our gun was charged, and the rocket
in position. âLook alive, Jack; get the poker,â cried the mate, as he primed
the gun. Jack dived down the companion hatch, and in another moment
returned with a red-hot poker, which the mate had thrust into the cabin fire
[313]

at the first alarm. Jack applied it in quick succession to the gun and the
rocket. A blinding flash and deafening crash were followed by the whiz of the
rocket, as it sprang with a magnificent curve far away into the surrounding
darkness. This was our answer to the Southsand-Head light, which, having
fired three guns and three rockets to attract our attention, now ceased firing.
It was also our note of warning to the look-out on the pier of Ramsgate Harbour.
âThatâs a beauty,â said our mate, referring to the rocket; âget up
another, Jack; sponge her well out, Jacobs, weâll give âem another shot in a
few minutes.â Loud and clear were both our signals, but four and a half
miles of distance and a fresh gale neutralized their influence. The look-out
did not see them. In less than five minutes the gun and rocket were fired
again. Still no answering signal came from Ramsgate. âLoad the weather
gun,â said the mate. Jacobs obeyed, and I sought shelter under the lee of the
weather bulwarks, for the wind appeared to be composed of penknives and
needles. Our third gun thundered forth, and shook the lightship from stem
to stern; but the rocket struck the rigging and made a low wavering flight.
Another was therefore sent up, but it had scarcely cut its bright line across the
sky when we observed the answering signalâa rocket from Ramsgate Pier.

[314]

ââThatâs all right
now
, sir;
our
work is done,â said the mate, as he went
below, and quietly turned in, while the watch, having sponged out and recovered
the gun, resumed their active perambulation of the deck. I confess
that I felt somewhat disappointed at the sudden termination of the noise and
excitement! I was told that the Ramsgate lifeboat could not well be out in
less than an hour. It seemed to my excited spirit a terrible thing that human
lives should be kept so long in jeopardy, and, of course, I began to think, âIs
it not possible to prevent this delay?â There was nothing for it, however, but
patience, so I turned in âall standing,â as sailors have it, with orders that I
should be called when the lights of the tug should come in sight. It seemed
but a few minutes after, when the voice of the watch was again heard shouting
hastily, âLifeboat close alongside, sir. Didnât see it till this moment. She
carries no lights.â I bounced out, and minus coat, hat, and shoes, scrambled on
deck just in time to see the Broadstairs lifeboat rush past us before the gale.
She was close under our stern, and rendered spectrally visible by the light of
our lantern. âWhat are you firing for?â shouted the coxswain of the boat.
âShip on the sands, bearing south,â replied Jack, at the full pitch of his stentorian
voice. The boat did not pause. It passed with a magnificent rush
into darkness. The reply had been heard, and the lifeboat shot straight as an
arrow to the rescue. We often hear and read of such scenes, but vision is
necessary to enable one to realize the full import of all that goes on. Again
all was silent and unexciting on board of the
Gull
. I went shivering below,
with exalted notions of the courage and endurance of lifeboat men. Soon
after, the watch once more shouted, âTugâs in sight, sir;â and, once again, the
mate and I went on deck. The Ramsgate lifeboat
Bradford
was in tow far
astern. As she passed us, the brief questions and answers were repeated for
the benefit of the coxswain of the boat. I observed that every man in the
boat lay flat on the thwarts except the coxswain. No wonder. It is not an
easy matter to sit up in a gale of wind, with freezing spray, and sometimes
green seas, sweeping over one. They were, doubtless, wide awake and listening;
but, as far as vision went, that boat was manned by ten oilskin coats
and souâ-westers. A few seconds took them out of sight; and thus, as far as
the
Gull
lightship was concerned, the drama ended. There was no possibility
of our ascertaining more, at least during that night, for whatever might be the
result of these efforts, the floating lights had no chance of hearing of them
until the next visit of their tender. I was therefore obliged to turn in once
more, at 3
A.M.
Next forenoon we saw the wreck, bottom up, high on the
Goodwin Sands.â It was that of the good ship
Germania
of Bremen.

To be more exact than have been the majority of authors who have
written on lighthouses, we must add that a small revolving apparatus, with
three reverberators (probably with spherical shells), had been planted at the
mouth of the port of Marstrand, in Sweden, prior to 1783. The French
engineer, however, had thought out the invention for himself, in ignorance
that it had been elsewhere realized, and his was the merit of imagining a
system so complete and so rational in all its parts, that nothing has since been
added to or taken from his conception.

M. Leonel Reynard informs us that we are likewise wrong in attributing to
Argand the idea of a lamp with a double current of air. It is to TeulÃ¨re that
it should, in the main, be attributed. However, this engineer, who has asserted
the priority of his claim to the invention of the reflectors, and the
system of eclipses, has not insisted upon that of the lamp. He limits himself
to saying that Argand entertained the same idea as himself, and derived great
profit from it.

We condense the following report from the
Dundee Advertiser
, March 1,
1870:â

âOn Tuesday night the Scurdyness Lighthouse, at the entrance to Montrose
Harbour, was lit up for the first time, amid the rejoicings of the people of
Montrose and Ferryden. From early morning the vessels in the harbour displayed
numerous flags, and more than the usual stir was observable among
the villagers on the opposite side of the river. Indeed, seldom have the Ferryden
people manifested so much enthusiasm; but it is seldom that they have
so much cause to rejoice. The want of a light at the Scurdyness has long
been felt by the seafaring community. The rock-bound shore stretching
between the Bell Rock and the Girdlenessâa distance of nearly fifty milesâis
perhaps one of the most dangerous parts of the east coast of Scotland, and
has been the scene of numerous shipwrecks and great loss of life. At no point
within these limits have so many disasters occurred as at the entrance to
Montrose Harbour, now fortunately protected by the Scurdyness Light.
Bounded on the one side by large outlying and in some instances hidden
rocks, and on the other by a long stretch of sandy shore, whilst the channel
itself is extremely narrow, the entrance to Montrose Harbour is very difficult
for navigation, and particularly so when the weather is boisterous. Moreover,
on the north side, and within a very short distance of the newly-erected lighthouse,
is the Annatâa sandbank on which many vessels have been wrecked
in attempting to make the harbour. The necessity, therefore, for a light on
Scurdyness was very great, and has been long and deeply felt. Situated at
the Point, on the southern side of the channel, the lighthouse, a substantial
building, commands a clear-weather range of seventeen nautical miles. It is
built on solid rock, the foundation being of stones from Benholm Quarry, and
the tower itself of white brick. The entire height of the tower is about 100 feet
and the lighthouse about 30 feetâin all, 130 feet from base to vane. The
diameter at the base is 23 feet 2 inches, whilst at the top it is 16 feet. A spiral
stair of about 140 steps leads to the top of the tower, after which the ascent
to the various stories is by ladders. There is a room near the top, in which
are deposited the stores. The light is fixed and white, of the second order
(dioptric), and the mechanism for supplying the lamp with oil is of the most
interesting nature. Oil is pumped up to the wick by clock-work; and an
alarm sounds during the whole time the machine is in motion, so that any
irregularity is immediately announced to the attendant. The light will be
seen from about S. W. Â¼ S., round by the east to about N.E. Â¼ N., or as far as
the land will permit. The bearings are magnetic, and from the vessel. A
light of weaker power will be shown from the channel towards Montrose Harbour.â

[66]
This lighthouse reflects a light on Arnish Beacon (see p.
274
).

[67]
Sgeirmaoile, or Skeirvuile.

[68]
It was this lighthouse, we presume, which underwent so extraordinary
an accident on Saturday, February 19th, 1870. About half-past ten
A.M.
, the
schooner
Elizabeth and Jane
, of Preston, approached the mouth of the
channel opposite Fleetwood. Adjoining the channel mouth, and about three
miles from the latter town, is situated a lighthouse upon screw piles. When
about half a mile off the lighthouse, the captain of the schooner found he was
drifting towards it, and, spite of all his exertions, he was unable to change her
course, as the tide flowed rapidly inwards, and a dead calm prevailed. Before
the anchor could get a âhold,â the ship ran bow foremost into the piles,
which were all shattered by the collision, and taking up the body of the lighthouseâa
huge sexangular timber frame, filled in with windows, and surmounted
with âa large revolving (?) lightââcarried it away on her forecastle.
Two keepers were in the lighthouse, but neither was hurt. The vessel, however,
was greatly injured, and some alarm was felt lest she should sink. However
the accident was seen from the shore; a tug steamer came to her assistance,
and, with the lighthouse on board, she was towed into port. Until a
new structure can be raised, a lightship will be stationed in a suitable locality.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE.

The
following work is an
abridgment of Dr. Perronâs French version of the narrative, written
in Arabic, by Sheikh Mohammed of Tunis, of his journey to two of
the most remarkable Black Kingdoms of Central Africa. Dr. Perronâs
work, ably edited by M. Jomard of the Institute, is too voluminous
to have obtained many readers in this country; but it contains so
much that is interesting, so fresh and peculiar a view of manners,
so many good stories and characteristic anecdotes, that I have
thought it worth while to reduce it to a more popular form. The
narrative bears witness itself to its own authenticity; but it is
further recommended to belief by the well-known and respectable
character of the writer, who is
[iv]
now reposing from his many fatigues in a
lucrative position, adapted to a learned man, in Cairo.
[1]

As the narrative forms a complete autobiography, it is not
necessary to say more of the author, save that he was born in 1789,
and commenced his travels when a mere boy, inheriting, and always
preserving, the character of a trader. All his allusions to
well-known public characters and events have been examined, and
found to be correct; so that it is fair to accept his testimony on
other points. He travelled with peculiar advantages in countries,
one of which, Darfur, has been only once visited by a European,
namely, Brown, in 1793; whilst the other has never been described,
except in this instance, by an eyewitness. Accurate geographical
details are, of course, not to be expected from the Sheikh. He
writes from memory, and from an Oriental point of view. But his
descriptions of manners and the general characteristics of tribes
and regions are, to all
[v]

appearance, accurate. They are certainly interesting. The reader is
introduced at the very first page within the circle of Eastern
life, and learns by degrees to view facts, if not with Eastern
eyes, at least without the prejudices of an outside observer.

The countries described, though isolated both by position and
policy, are sufficiently remarkable not to deserve utter neglect.
They form part of the great system of statesâblack in population,
but Mohammedan in religionâwhich stretches like a belt across
Central Africa, with unexplored expanses of Paganism to the south,
and to the north a desert, dotted with oases, and marked with
caravan tracks leading to the Mediterranean. The valley of the
Nile, which seems destined by Nature to be the highroad to this
region, is rendered comparatively useless for that purpose by the
restrictive regulations of Darfur. That cautious little kingdom
stops the way. It is so fearful of aggression from Egyptânot
entirely without causeâthat it will not allow the easiest routes to
be used, and compels all caravans to reach its frontiers exhausted
by a two monthsâ march across the desert from Siout.

The expedition sent by her Majestyâs government, under the late
Mr. Richardsonâwhich already counts two martyrsâwill have vastly
enlarged
[vi]
our
knowledge of the largest, most populous, and most important Central
African kingdoms. Drs. Barth and Vogel are still making gallant
geographical forays towards the southâcreating, as it were, ground
under their feetâfor unexplored countries must be considered as
scientifically non-existing; whilst Mr. Petermann records their
triumphs; as they are won, with a pride which must soften
opposition and disarm criticism. His Atlas, however it may be
modified by subsequent exploration, is so far the best and
completest portraiture of Central Africa that we possess.

It is not probable, however, that the German travellers will be
able or willing to penetrate eastward across the kingdoms described
in this Volume, although Mr. Richardson had contemplated such a
journey, and had communicated, through government, with the English
Consul-General in Egypt, that the way might, to a certain extent,
be prepared. I believe it is still the practice, if not the rule,
in Darfur, to prevent all strangers who penetrate into the interior
of the kingdom from going away again. However, strong
representations from Egypt might have obviated this difficulty. At
present we cannot expect the experiment to be tried, as Dr. Barth
seems to be directing his attention to a still more
[vii]
difficult expedition; and it
is extremely probable that for many years to come the information
contained in the present Volume will not be superseded.

The Sheikh, in the course of his narrative, affords us a good
deal of information, which applies equally well to the present day,
on the state of slavery in the parts of Africa he visited.
According to his unconscious representation, the Mohammedan states
which have formed on the northern limits of Negroland have used the
superior power they have acquired from semi-civilisation as a means
of preying on their savage brethren. In England, forests have been
said to be excrescences of the earth given by God to men to pay
their debts withal. In Africa, the princes and great people regard
their fellow-creatures in the same light. This is, perhaps, the
chief reason why those countries, in spite of their natural
advantages, remain in their present backward state. There seems to
be only one way to induce them to abandon their man-hunting
propensities,ânamely, the development of regular commerce; and
there is ground for hoping that the progress of discovery may lead
to occasions of intercourse, and to the signing of treaties which
may cease some day to be mere inoperative documents. When we can
safely get at Central Africa,
[viii]
and discover some means of obtaining its
productions to meet a regular demand, it will be easy to divert its
population from what will then be the unprofitable employment of
stealing one another. It is on this ground that the exploration of
its water-outlets towards the Atlantic is so important.

Darfur and WadaÃ¯, however, belong to Eastern Africa, the proper
approach to which is the Nile. If a regular government were
established in Egypt, exercising its authority firmly over the
southern provinces that now, for all practical purposes, are but
nominally subject, commerce would soon begin to flow in its natural
channel, and merchandise, which is now principally brought across
the desert, would be directed to the nearest point upon the Nile,
which would be soon laden with fleets of boats dropping down with
the current. There are the elements of an empire more important
than Hindustan, between Alexandria and the fourth parallel of North
Latitude.

My
father, says the pious
Sheikh Mohammed of Tunis, beginning his narrativeâmay God
overshadow him with the clouds of his mercy and goodness!âhas
related to me that my great-grandfather was one of the most
important personages of Tunis; that he was steward of the Sultan of
Barbary, the perfect prince, the victorious king, the shereef
Mohammed El-Hosny.
[2]
In the exercise of his
functions
[2]
he became
wealthy, and died, leaving three sons, who divided the heritage,
and sold the house, which had been their first refuge, so that each
remained alone with his wife and his children.

My grandfather was a man of letters, and wrote a beautiful hand.
The books he copied sold for double the price of others. He had
also learned the art of dyeing, and from the beginning was better
off than his brothers, and better dressed than they. It happened
one day that the desire came upon him to make a pilgrimage to the
Sacred House, the Kaaba, and to visit the tomb of the Prophet. He
sold a portion of his property, and prepared for his journey in the
character of a trader, providing himself with good store of
blankets and tarbooshes. Many persons also confided to him a
certain quantity of merchandise, that he might trade to their
advantage, for his good faith and probity were well known. He
started in a vessel with a good cargo, his brothers accompanied him
to the shore to bid him adieu, and a favourable wind at first
accompanied him; but the weather suddenly changed, and he was
driven in the direction of Rhodes, where a violent tempest overtook
him. The vessel began to leak, the timbers to crack, the waves to
leap over the bulwarks,âin short, they were wrecked upon the coast,
and a few only escaped. Among these was my grandfather, who
contrived to reach the city of Rhodes.

âThy head,â says the poet, âbeing saved from
[3]
destruction, wealth seems of no
more value than the pairing of a nail.â

Luckily the traveller had round his waist a belt full of gold,
which sufficed for his expenses. He bought a stock of provisions,
and, re-embarking, set sail for Alexandria. It was the season of
the departure of the pilgrims to join in the great ceremonies
celebrated near Mount Arafat. He set out on his journey, and having
safely arrived in the Sacred Countries, performed his pious duties
with all the zeal and devotion of which he was capable. But when he
had fully enjoyed the happiness of saluting the Prophet and his two
companions, Abou-Bekr and Omar, who are buried near him, he
recovered from his bewilderment, and began to reflect on the loss
of his fortune and the uncertainty of the future. He was ashamed to
return to Tunis in a state of misery and distressâhe who had lived
there in so much comfort. How would he be received by his
countrymen? Upon this he began to repeat to himself these
words:â

âI will travel in the countries of the East and of the setting
sun. I will win wealth, or I will die far from my country. If my
soul depart from me, God will call it to himself; but if I survive,
it will be easy to revisit the place of my birth.â

He reflected, also, that even the Jew is honoured on account of
his gold, and that the shereef is humiliated by poverty. The very
dogs wag their tails at sight of a well-dressed man, but bark at
those
[4]
that are in rags.
In consequence of these reflections, my grandfather left Mekka, and
went to reside at Jeddah, where he gained his living by copying
manuscripts. In the course of time he formed an acquaintance with
some people from Sennaar, one of whom became his intimate friend.
Now, this man said to him one day:â

âFrom what country art thou?â

He repliedââI am from Tunis.â

âAnd how does it happen that thou hast come to live at
Jeddah?â

Then my grandfather related to him the history of his
misfortunes.

âWhy shouldst thou not make up thy mind,â said the man from
Sennaar, âto come with us to our city? Thou wilt find there honour
and well-being. Our mek (king) is a man with an open hand, caring
neither for gold nor for silver, loving merit, and honouring
shereefs. I answer for it, he will revive thy fortunes, and bestow
upon thee riches, honours, slaves, and camels.â

So my grandfather allowed himself to be persuaded, and, setting
out, arrived in safety at Sennaar, and was presented to the mek in
these words:â

âThis man is a learned man from a foreign country; his ship was
destroyed upon the seas, and he has lost all he possessed.â

The mek received my grandfather with hospitality, saying, âBe
welcome!ââand treated him with great deference, giving him a
lodging and abundant presents.

[5]
Among these presents
was a young girl of charming aspect, and of great price, named
Halymah. Fascinated by her beauty, my father took her as his
concubine, and had by her a son and a daughter, as beautiful as
their mother. The king, moreover, assigned to him a fixed income;
so that he utterly forgot his family, which had remained in Tunis,
and the three young children he had left under the charge of their
mother.

Now, of these children, my late uncle, named Mohammed, was about
that time nine years old; the secondâmay God save his soul!âwas
called Omar, and was six years oldâthis was my father; the third,
Mohammed Tahir, was three years old. They were all placed under the
guardianship of their maternal uncle, Seyd Ahmed, son of the
learned Sulieman-el-Azhary. This was a man of high character and
immense learning, author of many esteemed books. On account of his
great knowledge of theology, the functions of Kady of Tunis had
been offered to him, but he had refused. He occupied himself in
giving lessons, at first in a college, but afterwardsâon account of
ill-healthâin his own house, where all the great people came to
listen to his lectures.

My father remained with him until he came to manâs estate, and
profited much by his instruction. But, then, the desire moved him
to perform the pilgrimage, and he laid the subject before his
uncle, who was at once stirred by the same laudable
wish,
[6]
and gave up his
lectures and prepared for departure. They embarked and proceeded to
Alexandria, and thence to Cairo; and afterwards started for
Cosseir, some months before the season of the pilgrimage. As they
were crossing the desert, they beheld approaching another caravan,
composed of Magrebyns, coming from Sennaar. When they drew nigh
they began to shout out questions one to the other; and those
coming from Sennaar cried,â

âHo! ho! is there any one amongst you from Tunis?â

âYes,â replied my father, âwe are from Tunis.â

âDo you know one Ahmed, son of Suleiman?â

âYes,â said my father; âand who art thou?â

âI am his brother-in-law. I left Tunis a long time agoâmy
children and all my familyâand I know not whether they are dead or
alive.â

Now the uncle of my father was under a kind of palanquin,
covered with cloth; but had overheard this conversation.

âOmar,â said he, âgo and salute thy father. It is he; and tell
him I am here.â

So Omar jumped off his camel, and, running to his father, kissed
his hand, and told him that the brother of his wife was under the
palanquin.

My grandfather hastened and saluted the son of Suleiman, and
when they were somewhat tranquillised, Omar said to his
father,â

âHow comes it that thou hast left us so long,
[7]
without any resource, young as we
are? If God had not awakened the bounty of my uncle, we should have
been lost.â

My grandfather explained that he had been the victim of destiny,
and quoted the words of a poet in support of his statement.

âBut,â said my father, âart thou now thinking of returning to
our country, and of refreshing the eyes of thy family?â

âI will return, if it please God.â

âAnd when?â

âI am now going to Cairo to sell my female slaves. Then I shall
return to Sennaar, to take my children and whatever I possess; and
afterwards I shall set out for Egypt. Go thou upon the pilgrimage,
and we shall meet again at Cairo. Whoever arrives first shall wait
for the other.â

So they said, âAdieu!â and the two caravans separated in the
desert. My father and his uncle went upon their pilgrimage, and my
grandfather continued his journey to Cairo, where he sold his
slaves, and, having made his purchases, returned to his adopted
country. Meanwhile the pilgrims arrived at the holy city, and
performed their pious duties; but the elder of them died, and was
buried near the gate of Mala. So Omar returned alone to Cairo, and,
whilst waiting for his father, attended on the scientific lectures
in the mosque of El-Azhar. But he waited in vain; his father came
not; and,
[8]
in his
impatience, he started with a caravan which was returning direct to
Sennaar.

Having arrived in that country, he found his father comfortably
settled, surrounded by his wives and children, and having no
thoughts of departure. He asked him why he had broken his promise,
and had laughed at him. My grandfather gave an evasive answer, to
the effect that his debtors would not pay him, and persuaded Omar
to wait six months longer. A caravan then preparing to depart for
Egypt, Omar said,â

âMy father! wilt thou come along with us, or shall I go away
alone?â

âNeither the one nor the other. It is not convenient for me to
go to Tunis, where I owe money. Besides, I have learned that thy
mother has married again. As for thy departure, put it off; thou
must be provided for that purpose with slaves, camels, gold, and
merchandise.â

My father refused to remain any longer, saying: âI wish to
become learned, and all the time I spend here is pure loss.â

Upon this they quarrelled, and my father went away in anger with
the caravan, not possessing a single para. But three days
afterwards, my grandfather came riding after him, and gave him
three camels, four young slave-girls, two black slaves, provisions
and water-skins, and a camel-load of gum. My father received the
whole, and continued his
[9]
journey with the caravan; but some time
afterwards they strayed from the track and lost their way. Thirst
made itself felt, the passage of the desert was prolonged, and the
slave-girls and the camels which had been given to my father died,
so that he became as poor as before. Well has a poet said, that
when Fortune is willing to follow you can lead her with a hair, but
when she wishes to turn away, she can break chains of iron.

Heaven, however, had not determined that my father should remain
in an extremity of distress. The chief of the caravan became ill,
and nobody knew a means of cure. His disease was a brain fever; but
my father wrote a passage from the Koran on a piece of paper, and
gave it to the sick man, who, with profound faith, placed it upon
his head and was instantly cured. In gratitude, the chief of the
caravan gave my father a camel to ride on, and placed his bales of
gum upon another, so that he arrived in safety at Cairo, and sold
his merchandise with a good profit. This done, he again entered the
mosque of El-Azhar, and shortly afterwards married my mother. After
two years of marriage, he had a son whom he called Ahmed, but who
died when he was fifteen months old. He consoled himself by
repeating the verses of the poet: âDear child, star of the heaven,
how short was thy time! thou wert like the stars of the last hour
of the night!â

Soon afterwards my father started for Tunis,
[10]
taking with him his wife and
mother-in-law, and was received by his brother, Mohammed, who had
become a tarboosh-manufacturer. Five months afterwards I was born.
It was on a Friday, three hours after the setting of the sun, in
the middle of the month of Zou-l-Kadeh, in the year 1204 (1789).
Three years afterwards my father, having quarrelled with his
brothers, returned to Egypt, and became a humble functionary in the
mosque of El-Azhar. Four years afterwards he received a letter from
his half-brother, in Sennaar, to this effect: âOur father has gone
to the dwelling of pardon of the very high God. He left behind him
a great number of books, which have been stolen from us by a
certain Ahmed, of Benzareh in the States of Tunis, whom we had
received into our house. We are in a condition that rejoices our
enemies and afflicts our friends. On the receipt of this letter
depart, we pray thee, immediately for this place, and take us with
thee. We live as you live. Salutation.â

On reading this letter my father wept, and pitied the misery of
his brother and his sister. He determined at once to go and fetch
them. I was then seven years old. I had already read the whole of
the Koran once, and was reading it a second time, having come to
the end of the chapter on the family of Aaron. I had a brother four
years old. My father left us sufficient to live on for six months;
but we remained a whole year alone. My mother was obliged to sell a
great portion of our copper
[11]
utensils and of her ornaments. Then my uncle
Tahir arrived at Cairo and took us under his protection. He came
with the combined object of pilgrimage and trade. He had a boy as
beautiful as the morning sun in a sky without clouds, named
Mohammed. This boy studied with me for some time; but the plague
came and he died; and was carried away to the tomb and to the
delights of the Houris. My uncle, who had intended to remain some
time in Cairo, was so saddened by the loss of his son, that he
started immediately for the holy city, leaving me money sufficient
for my expenses during four months.
[3]
But this time passed away,
and I was left sometimes not knowing what to eat, and nearly naked.
Meanwhile, however, I studied assiduously at the mosque of
El-Azhar. One day I learned that a caravan was arriving from
Soudan. It came from Darfur. I had learned a short time previously
that my father had departed from Sennaar for that country with his
brother. When, therefore, the caravan had entered the wakalah of
the slave-merchants, I went about amongst them inquiring if any one
knew whether my father was alive. After some time I chanced to fall
in with one of the traders, who was a grave, respectable man, named
Ahmed Bedawee. I kissed his hand and stood up before him.

[12]
âWhat dost thou
desire, my friend?â said he to me, in a voice full of
gentleness.

âI come to ask for news of some one whom you may happen to
know.â

âWho is he, and what is his name?â

âOmar of Tunis, a learned man.â

âThou hast addressed thyself to the right person. I am his
friend; and thou, from thy face, should be his son.â

âYes, I am he;â and I related my misfortunes.

He then told me that my father was among the personages placed
near the Sultan, one of the most honoured members of the divan, and
offered to advance me sufficient money to enable me to set out and
join him. I accepted his offer, saying that I would follow him like
a shadow; so I went to visit him every day until Ahmed said to me:
âWe shall start to-morrow, come and pass the night with us.â I did
so, and next morning at early dawn we rose and pronounced the
prayer of the Sabh, and prepared the baggage and placed it on the
camels. The horns of the gazelle could not have been perceived in
the desert at the time when our camels went away from the wakalah,
swinging their burdens to and fro. We arrived at Fostat, and our
beasts knelt on the banks of the Nile. We transferred our baggage
to a large boat, and, having waited for the mid-day prayerâit being
Fridayâwe started.

When
our boat had pushed
off from the shores of Old Cairo, whilst the men were getting out
the great sail, I began sadly to reflect on the dangers of the
voyage I was undertaking: a warning voice seemed to speak from the
depths of my heart. I trembledâdisquietude overshadowed meâI was
amidst the sons of a race foreign to my own; amidst men whose
language I scarcely knew, whose countenances were not white, and
whose miens not promising. I whispered to myself, whilst tears
stood in my eyes:ââBody, garments, visage, all in them seem black
to theeâblack skins in black clothing.â I repented me that I had
been won
[14]
over by the
sons of Ham. Their hatred for the sons of Shem came to my thoughts.
I felt within myself an indescribable emotion, and was on the point
of begging permission to return to Cairo; but the grace of God
descended upon me, and I remembered all that had been said by men
of learning and of science, and by the prophet, in favour of
travels. If the pearl did not quit its shell, it would never be
placed in a diadem; and if the moon moved not, it would ever be a
crescent. So I determined to persevere. A favourable wind impelled
us during the day, our kanjia moved swiftly up the stream, and at
night-time we reached Minieh.
[5]

Near this town there was a troop of those Ghouz, or Mamlouks,
from whom God had just removed the cloak of power.
[6]

They seized our bark by violence. They were encamped in tents near
the town, along the banks of the Nile, and were on the look-out for
travellers, that they might rob them: they spoiled our chief of all
his money. When we escaped from their hands we proceeded in three
days to Manfaloot, and thence to Beni-Ady, where we remained until
the Darfur caravan was ready to startâuntil it had mended its
water-skins, and got together its provisions.
[7]

[15]
When the camels
were at length laden we struck into the desert, and on the evening
of the fifth day reached Kharjeh, the Theban oasis. This place is
planted with date-trees, that surround it as the anklets surround
the ankles, or as the two arms of a lover surround the neck of his
mistress, on whom he sheds a kiss. These date-trees were laden with
splendid dates, the aspect of which charmed our eyes, and which
were exceedingly cheap. We remained there five days; but on the
morning of the sixth proceeded, and, after hard travelling, on the
third day reached Abyrys. This country has been ruined by the
exactions of its governors; all its population, formerly so happy,
is now dispersed; the date-trees are destroyed, and all the
brilliance of the scenery has been tarnished.

After two days of rest we pushed on two other days to Boulac, a
country also desolated, and nearly without inhabitants. Most of its
houses are ruined. What surprised me was the extreme smallness of
the date-trees, under which we could lie and pick the fruit with
our hands. The name of Boulac recalled to me the Boulac of Cairo,
and some natural tears fell from my eyes as I thought of the place
where I had been brought up.

But there is little time for regret in the desert. We pushed on
hastily and arrived in the evening at Maks, to which this verse may
be applied: âThe country has no inhabitants, except the gazelles
and the caravans that traverse it.â It is related that
[16]
Maks had formerly a large
population, which perished by the hand of Him who destroyed the
last eagle of Lockman: all the inhabitants have disappearedânot a
man is left. Scarcely at present remain there a few trees, some
tamarisks, and thorny bushes. We tarried there two days, and having
filled our water-skins, departed.

We now entered a desert completely arid. For five days we
marched through silent solitudes, over grim plains, where here and
there the wandering eye could scarcely discover some stunted plants
of the same colour as the ground; there was not a tree to cast a
handâs-breadth of shadow. During this part of the journey we were
compelled to cook our food with the dry dung of camels, which the
servants collected.

On the evening of the fifth day we reached a place called
Es-Shebb, situated in the midst of mountains that seemed like vast
cones of sand. An unpleasant wind blew over them; but we remained
there two days to rest, and then went on again for four more, until
we reached the wells of Selineh, near which are the ruins of
ancient buildings. It is situated at the foot of a mountain which
bears the same name. We remained there two days to rest. This place
is a delightful one for the traveller; but that which astonished me
chiefly was that the young men of the caravan, having ascended the
mountain, struck certain blocks of stone with switches, and caused
them to yield a sound exactly resembling that
[17]
of a tambourine. The cause of this curious
circumstance is unknown. Are there hollows in these stones, or are
they placed over caverns? Glory be to God, who knows the truth! At
any rate the people of the caravan told me that, on a certain
night, which they specifiedâthe night of Friday, I believeâthere is
heard from the mountain the playing of a tambourine, as if a
marriage festival were going on. The origin of these nocturnal
musical entertainments is also unknown.

On the third day we filled our water-skins, and leaving Selineh
entered upon the desert, and having travelled for five whole days,
during which we met a caravan of Amaim Arabs coming from the natron
lakes, reached Laguyeh, where we again rested two days and departed
for Zaghawy. We now met a courier, mounted on a dromedary, coming
from Darfur, and announcing the death of the just and glorious
prince, Sultan Abd-er-Rahman-er-Rashid, sovereign of Darfur and its
dependent provinces. The courier was going to Cairo to renew the
state seal, no one in that country being capable of engraving it.
The caravan testified its grief at this melancholy news; all feared
that some disturbance might arise in the country, for the Sultan
who had just died was an equitable and generous prince, loving
science and those who possessed it, and the declared enemy of
ignorance.

We continued our route for five days more, when at length our
camels knelt at the natron lakes of
[18]
Zaghawy. From thence to the frontiers of
Darfur there are still ten days of travel, making forty days in
all. We remained at this place eleven days, pasturing our beasts of
burthen, in order to prepare them for the frightful desert before
us. Some camels were slaughtered at this station, and their flesh
was distributed to the caravan. There came to us some Bedawin Arabs
of Darfur, who offered for sale camel-milk and butter. They had
come to fetch salt and natron from that place.

We now sent forward a courier, mounted on a dromedary, with
letters for the government, and others for the relations of the
caravan folks, announcing our speedy arrival. I also wrote to my
father, kissing his venerable hands, and relating how Ahmed Bedawee
had cared for me. Indeed I had reason to be thankful; of all the
journeys I had ever performed this was the pleasantest; for so soon
as we quitted Beni-Ady my protector ordered his slaves to prepare
for me a kind of tent on a quiet camel, and he himself assisted me
to mount, and held the bridle until I was settled in my seat. He
gave me, also, a great leathern bottle to hold water, and bade all
his servitors to be at my beck and call. He had with him seven
middle-aged slaves and one young one, eight hired domestics, and
sixty-eight camels. With him were five concubines, and a sixth
woman, who was his cousin, Sitti Jamal, of ravishing beauty. He had
also a black Dongola horse, with a saddle of green velvet.

Ahmed treated me with all the kindness of a
[19]
father. When the caravan halted I used to
doze away, fatigued by the swinging of the camel and the heat of
the sun: he would allow me to sleep until the hour of supper
arrived, when he would wake me gently and bring me water, that I
might wash. At meals he guided my hand to the dish, and sometimes
put the morsels into my mouth.

When we left the wells of Zaghawy we marched for ten days
hastily, starting before dawn and trenching on the night. On the
eleventh morning we came to Mazroob, a well situated on the
confines of Darfur, and in a few hours the Arabs came down to us,
bringing large skins of water and little skins full of milk. We
congratulated ourselves on the happy termination of our journey,
and solaced ourselves at the well during the whole of that day; but
next morning we advanced, in four hours, to Souwaineh, where we met
the governor of the country, with a suite of five hundred horsemen,
who wished us a good journey. This was the Melik Mohammed Sanjak.
In Soudan every governor bears the title of Melik, or Mekâthat is
to say, king.

Having rested at this place two days, we again started; but here
our caravan broke up, each taking the direction of his own
district. The greatest number went to Kobeih, the capital; but
Ahmed, my protector, was from Sarf-el-Dajaj, or the Rivulet of
Fowls. I accompanied him, and we advanced slowly for three days,
and on the fourth came under
[20]
the shade of a great mountain, where was a
well, on the brink of which we halted to pass the warm hours. A
number of persons came here to congratulate us upon our arrival,
and among others of my protector, with slaves and servants bearing
provisions. We feasted and talked until the sun went down, and,
then proceeding, arrived in an hour and a-half at
Sarf-el-Dajaj.

The rest of the evening was spent in receiving a crowd of
visitors; but Ahmed did not forget me, and ordered a hut to be
prepared for my repose. I slept soundly, and next morning went to
visit my protector, whom I found sitting gravely surrounded by his
servants, his slave-women, and his children, happy, satisfied, and
quiet, as if he had not just come off so long a journey. He
introduced me to his relations and friends; and several days were
spent by me in passing from one house to another, enjoying the
festivals given to celebrate the return of the travellers.

I returned one day to my house, a little before twilight, and
found there two men and two slaves. One of the two men was short,
bronze-coloured, rather agreeable in aspect, and dressed with some
elegance. The other was black and poorly accoutred. I sat down,
suppressing my surprise at seeing a couple of strangers installed
in my chamber. They made signs to one another, looking at me. Then
one began to say,â

[21]
âIs this really
he?âââCertainly it is he!â

I did not know what they meant, but the bronze-coloured man
said,â

âArt thou of this country?â

âNo! I come from Cairo to meet my father.â

âWho is thy father?â

âOmar of Tunis.â

Then the black said sharply, âSalute, then, thy uncle, Ahmed
Zarrouk!â

So I saluted the bronzed man, who handed to me a letter
addressed to Ahmed Bedawee, in which my father paid numerous
compliments to my protector, thanking him, and announcing that he
had sent, as presents, two slaves of six spans in height, and a
sorrel colt. When I had read this missive, the bronzed man told me
to go and communicate it to Ahmed, and to take the presents with
me. This I did, and my protector, having admired the slaves and the
colt, said,ââBlessings! they are magnificent! I accept them, and I
give them to my sonâthis oneââpointing to me.

Both I and my uncle pressed him to keep them, but he would not,
saying,ââIf I were to expend all my fortune for thy father, it
would be little in comparison with the service he has rendered
me.â

Upon this I took courage to ask, âWhat was this service he so
often alluded to?â

âKnow, my child,â said he, âthat my enemies had spoken calumnies
against me to his highness the
[22]
Sultan. I was accused of selling free-women;
and with so much cunning and appearance of truth, that the Sultan
was convinced, and exclaimed in his rage, âA merchant of his rank,
possessor of so much wealth, to behave thus! Better he were poor!â
Then he called me before him, and received me with flashing eyes
and contemptuous words. I begged that the charges should be
examined. They refused. My words were stifled. I was seized, an
iron collar was put round my neck, and they were about to throw me
into a dungeon. But, thanks to the benevolent providence of God,
thy father was present at this scene. Nobody had dared to intercede
for me, seeing the mighty anger of the Sultan. Thy father came
forward, and having coughed like one about to make a speech,
pronounced certain words of the Prophet on pardon, and on the
necessity of verifying accusations. Then he implored the clemency
of the Sultan for me. The Sultan was moved, and ordered me to be
set at liberty. My innocence was afterwards made manifest; but if,
at that time, God had not roused up thy father, my life and my
property would have been sacrificed. What greater service can be
rendered to a man than this? God will reward it. For my part, I had
long waited an opportunity to be agreeable to thy father, and I
have only been able to do for him this slight kindness. Perhaps it
will be counted as part payment of my debt; but I do not think
so.â

[23]
My uncle wished to
depart on the morrow, but Ahmed would not consent, and we remained
three days more. On the morning of the fourth day my protector gave
me a great quantity of kharaz, or strings of beads used to ornament
womenâs dresses in Soudan: he also gave me some others, more
valuable, used as necklaces. To these he added some beads of yellow
amber, and a large agate of a light red colour. All this was worth
three female slaves. He presented me likewise with a new turban of
green muslin, with some sunbul, sandal-wood, and other perfumes
used by the Soudan ladies. âDistribute this,â he said, âto thy
fatherâs wives.â Afterwards he killed a sheep, and roasted it
entire, as a parting meal, and having properly saluted us, allowed
us to depart.

I mounted a horse, my uncle a dromedary, and the black man an
ass. The slaves preceded us. We were bound for a place six daysâ
distant, called Aboul-Joudoul, where was my father. On our way we
passed Kelkabieh, the environs of which reminded me of the country
places of Egypt; but the town is better built, richer, and more
lively. Many foreigners are seen there. The natives are, for the
most part, wealthy merchants, having great numbers of slaves, with
which they trade. The district belonging to this town is vast and
open, and there are great numbers of wells, the water of which
rises nearly to the brim. The date-tree flourishes there, as well
as abundance of vegetables: as cucumbers, vegetable
[24]
marrows, onions, fenugreek,
cumin, pepper, and various other plants well known in Egypt. The
sour lemon is also found.

Not far off are the mountains of Marrah, which stretch north and
south from one end of Darfur nearly to the other, cutting the
country into two unequal parts. This range is traversed by a series
of defiles, which enable the western and eastern provinces to
communicate. The true Forians inhabit these mountains, and shun the
plain, where they think themselves in less security.

At Kelkabieh there was a well-frequented market, where we bought
provisions and departed, proceeding three days along the mountains
of Marrah, until we came to a country, the inhabitants of which,
hating travellers, especially Arabs, received us very roughly.
Thenceforward we passed over plains, and, having rested at Tarneh,
arrived on the sixth day at Joultou, in the district of
Aboul-Joudoul. Here we saw a house, at the gate of which were
horses, asses, and servants. My father was receiving visitors. We
entered, and a number of young black slave-girls came running to
meet us, and surrounded us, welcoming our arrival. Then the guests
of my father went away, and he approached us, and testified his joy
at beholding me. I kissed his hand, and remained standing before
him out of respect. He ordered me to be seated. I obeyed; and a
little after he said,â

âWhat studies hast thou pursued? What hast thou learned?â

[25]
âThe Koran,â
replied I, âand something of scientific matters.â

These words rejoiced him.

The day after my arrival my father gave a great feast,
slaughtering an ox and several sheep, and inviting all his friends.
We passed a day of joy. A short time afterwards he requested my
uncle and me to get ready and go up to the steps of the throne, to
offer, in his name, presents to the Sultan, to his Grand Vizier,
and to his Vizier.

The Sultan, Mohammed Fadhl, son of Abd-er-Rahman, was at that
time very young, so that the government was in the hands of
Mohammed Kourra, the Grand Vizier. It was he who had placed the boy
on the throne at the death of his father. Report said that he was
derived from the slaves of the palace; but this is not true, for he
was of free birth. He was a devoted minister, and well fitted to
govern, endowed with genius, sagacity, and courage. No man knew
better than he to guide political matters.

We started, according to my fatherâs desire, for Tendelty, at
that time the seat of the Sultan. This place was called the Fasher,
it being the custom in Darfur to apply that name to whatever spot
the Sultan chose for his habitation. On the third day we arrived,
and found the city filled with crowds of people; there was constant
moving to and fro of foot-passengers and of horsemen, and the
people were sitting in groups before their doors; the air was
filled with the sound of tambourines and the trampling
[26]
of cavalry. We repaired at once
to the house of the Vizier, Fakih-Malik, to whom my father was
immediately subject. He was in the midst of his servants and his
suite, and various public officers, but received us with politeness
and benevolence, and ordered a place to be prepared for our
baggage. Then he offered to conduct us to the palace of Sheikh
Mohammed Kourra, which we found surrounded on all sides by the
horses, dromedaries, and asses of people who had come to obtain
audience. The dignitaries of the state surrounded him. I was
introduced as the son of the learned Shereef Omar, of Tunis, and
was well received, as were also the presents. He spoke in terms of
compliment of my father, and ordered Malik to lodge us. We remained
at Tendelty three days, in the midst of honours, festivals, and
contentment. Then I was called to audience, and received a present
of a green shawl and other garments, two beautiful slaves, and a
negro. Then he wrote a complimentary letter, and dismissed me well
pleased. As for Malik, he gave me a young slave-girl, whom he
described in the letter he also sent, as âfirm-bosomed, solid as a
cube, and of the age of the Houris.â She was named Hamaidah. Well
contented to be the bearer of these presents, I returned to my
father, and rejoiced his sight.

I remained
in repose at my
fatherâs house until the month of Ramadhan, when my father went to
the Fasher to salute the Sultan. There he met the Grand Vizier,
Kourra, and begged permission of him to be allowed to go to Tunis,
that he might see his mother before her death. He added, that he
would leave me in Darfur, for the country where my father resided
was a kind of fief which had been confided to him by the late
Sultan. He had at first, however, been placed at Guerly, but had
refused to remain there, because the inhabitants had no knowledge
of the Arabic language. His present district contained three
villages. It was agreed, therefore, that I should be settled in
that country, that I should collect the taxes, and cultivate it for
my advantage.

[28]
When Kourra had
exacted from my father a promise that he would return to Darfur, he
gave him permission to depart, and wrote letters to the chiefs of
the various provinces through which he would have to pass, ordering
them to receive him and furnish him with escorts. So my father bade
adieu to Kourra, and returned to us, thinking of nothing but his
journey. He prepared to set out as soon as possible. He sold his
cotton, of which he had sown twenty feddans, and turned all he
possessed into money, even his flocks, and his oxen, and his asses.
He took with him his slave-women, his blacks, and all that I had
received from Ahmed Bedawee and from the Sheikh Kourra. He left me
only a single slave-woman, who had a web in her eye, called
Farhanah, two blacks, with their wives, an ass, and a sick
dromedary. He also left me one of his wives, called Zohrah, and his
brotherâs wife, each of whom had a daughter. He sold all his
grain-pits, except one, which he gave to me. He then placed in my
hands the contract of donation of lands which had been ceded to him
by the late Sultan. This document, having enumerated the various
titles of the prince, constituted Omar of Tunis the absolute master
of the district of Aboul-Joudoul and its three villages. Having
thus provided for me, my father put his baggage on his camels, and
went away with his slaves, his harem, and his brother, and left me
to myself.

Now it came to pass in the month of Regeb,
[29]
1219, that the Ab Sheikh, Mohammed Kourra,
was killed in a battle during a revolt, in which he was engaged in
spite of himself, and in which he was obliged to make war against
the Sultan Mohammed Fadhl. His enemies excited the prince against
him by their calumnies, accusing him of a desire to dethrone him in
favour of his brother. It was this that caused the weather to
become cloudy between them. The Sultan tried to seize Kourra, but
he escaped from his hands, and went to live among his people in his
house, still in the same province. Not being able to reduce him in
any other way, the Sultan sent soldiers to prevent him from getting
water from the lake in Tendelty. For three days Kourra got water
from a distance, but not in sufficient quantities, so that his
partisans began to suffer from thirst, and murmured against
fortune, and insisted on being led away. But Kourra assembled them,
and marching down to the lake, defeated the guards there placed.
Upon this the royal army advanced, but was defeated with terrible
loss, and the Sultan fled away to the opposite side of the lake.
During the night Kourra began to count his loss, and found that his
brother had been killed. So he exclaimed, âFor whose sake do I now
fight? I care for nothing else in life!â And he ordered his people
on the next battle not to follow him amidst the foe. This order
caused great desertion in his camp, for people felt that he had
ceased to wish for victory. In the morning the tambourines gave the
signal of
[30]
combat, and
the troops of the Sultan advanced on horseback. Kourra mounted on
his war-steed, and dashed at once into the
mÃªlÃ©e
, breaking
the lines opposed to him, until he came in presence of the Sultan,
and might have killed him; but he stopped, remembering the benefits
he had derived from his father, and exclaimed, âThou hast listened
to the calumnies circulated against me, and this is the way in
which you recompense my services.â The Sultan was alarmed, and
trembled, and wished to fly, and called out to his people, âThere
he isâhe is going to kill me!â So from all sides they rushed upon
Kourra, and surrounded him, as the ring surrounds the finger. The
Ab, seeing that there was no salvation for him, fought like a lion,
and many warriors fell beneath his sword. He soon became covered
with wounds, but, in spite thereof, he fought in the midst of the
crowd for nearly an hour, until some one, coming behind, hamstrung
his horse. Then he fell, and, being heavy with his double
iron-mail, could not get up again; so his enemies rushed upon him
like dogs upon their prey, and he was killed. May the mercy of God
be upon him!

Then they stripped him, and found that he had more than a
hundred wounds from sabre or lance. Meanwhile the son of his
wifeâhe was himself an eunuch
[8]
ânamed Shilfoot, came,
breaking through the crowd, in the hopes of finding him still
alive,
[31]
and rescuing
himâbut it was too late; so he fell right and left upon the enemy,
killing numbers of them, and shouting, âCome, the price! the price!
Pay me the price of Kourra!â At length, however, he also fell.

Such was the end of the great Ab Sheikh, Mohammed Kourra; and I
will now relate his life, and how he raised himself to power; and I
will set down, at the same time, what I have learned from several
old men about the history of the Sultans of Darfur.

The Sultan Mohammed Fadhl was son of the Sultan Abd-er-Rahman,
who was son of the Sultan Ahmed Bekr. The latter had seven sons,
Omar, AbÃ»l Kasim, Riz, Rifa, Tyrab, Tahir, and Abd-er-Rahman,
surnamed El-Yatim, or The Orphanâbecause, at the death of his
father, he was still unborn. When Ahmed Bekr saw that his hour was
drawing nigh, he assembled around him the dignitaries of the state,
and declared it to be his last will that the Sultanship should pass
alternately from one of his sons to another, as death took them
off; but that the children of each should not reign until all the
seven were dead. So Omar governed in the first place, and reigned
until he fell in battle against the sovereign of WadaÃ¯. His
successor, AbÃ»l Kasim, also reigned seven years, and was killed in
the same way. To him succeeded Tyrab, surnamed the Seeds of Syria,
who hated war, and remained at home, occupied in the cares of
government for thirty-three years. He loved boisterous amusements,
and was
[32]
fond of
dress. During his reign there was fertility and peace, and all
provisions were cheap. But, towards the end of his life, he was
detested on account of the extravagant conduct of his children, who
were in number more than thirty, without counting the girls. These
princes were ever wandering on horseback through Darfur; and if
they heard of any valuable thing at once seized it as their
property. Every one suffered by them and feared them. One went so
far as to give up riding on horseback, and would only ride upon
men, seizing any passers-by, and compelling them to carry him.
Complaints were made to the prince, who would not, however, believe
or pay any attention to them. The eldest of his sons was called
Izhak, surnamed the Kaliph, and was brave, intelligent, but
avaricious and tyrannical.

Tyrab was addicted to debauch and to pleasure. Often young girls
and boys played and danced together in his presence, and he loved
to behold them. One day a troop of Birguids came to the Fasher.
These people have a particular dance, called Tendegueh, during
which, when the couples are tired, they go, lads and lasses, two by
two, to sit together; and so, after they had danced before the
Sultan, they went thus to sit two by two, and one of the dancers
said to his partner,â

âWilt thou take me for thy husband?â

âYes; but what wilt thou give me for a dowry?â

[33]
âAlas! I am poor;
I can give thee nothing more valuable than he who is opposite
me.â

This was the Sultan.

âVery good,â said the girl: âI accept.â

Now it happened that Tyrab was observing their signs, and called
them to him, and asked for an explanation. The young man boldly
said,â

âI was asking my sweetheart here, if she would marry me; she
consents, but asks for a dowry; and I have answered her that I have
none other to give but thee.â

âThis is a singular dowry,â said Tyrab; âand has she
accepted?â

âCertainly,â said the young man.

Then the Sultan said to the girl,â

âWilt thou allow me to take a substitute, and to pay a
ransom?â

âWillingly,â answered she; âI consentâI accept.â

So Tyrab sent for the father of the young girl, and asked her in
marriage, and drew out the contract with her father; and gave to
the bride for dowry two beautiful slaves, and to the bridegroom a
handsome negro; and, moreover, added wherewith to live comfortably.
Verily, this was a fine trait, for there is nothing more excellent
than to unite those who love by a pure tie.

A similar story is told of the Kaliph, Abou-Bekr. He used to
wander by night through the Brilliant City, in order to know the
true state of his people,
[34]
and to discover who was the victim of
oppression. In one of his rounds he heard in the street a young
girl singing these verses:â

âAlas, I loved him even before they tore
away my talisman;

In his walk he describes the
graceful bending of a branch:

His countenance is like the lustre
of the full moonâ

Like it, he appears and
disappears,

And he is of the stock of
Hashim.â

Abou-Bekr knocked at the door, and said to this young girl,â

âWho is he that thou lovest?â

âDepart from hence,â cried she.

He persisted, saying: âThou must tell me the name of him thou
lovest.â

âBy the name of the Prophet, who is now in his tomb, I conjure
thee to depart from hence!â

âBy the name of God, I will not go away until thou hast told me
who is the object of thy love!â

Then she heaved a profound sigh, and replied,â

âAn unhappy flame consumes me; I am full of trouble. I love
Mohammed, son of Kasim.â

âBut art thou free?â

âNo; I am a slave.â

âOf whom?â

âOf such a one,â naming him.

Then Abou-Bekr went away, and, in the morning, learned that the
son of Kasim was upon an expedition in Irak. So he bought the young
slave-girl, and sent her with a letter to her lover, explaining
what had come to pass; and adding, âMy son,
[35]
how many hearts have sickened unto death
for women! and how many virgins have languished in
disappointment!â

This reminds me of another story. Suleiman, son of Abdel Malik,
was of an extremely jealous disposition, and sometimes put to death
individuals whom he suspected of having cast an eye of covetousness
on any of his women. Once he called a singer to him: it was
daytime; he caused him to sit at the foot of his bed and to sing.
Now, it happened that the weather was warm, and a young slave-girl
was employed in fanning him, and the combined influence of the
music and the cool air sent him to sleep. The singer, whose eyes
had been downcast, suddenly looked up and saw the Kaliph
slumbering, and the young girl still waving the fan. He fixed his
looks upon her, and she seemed to him to be splendid as the sun at
the fourth hour of the day. He became troubled, but he dared not
speak, for the Kaliph was there. Tears of love gushed from beneath
his eyelids, and passion burned within him. He took a piece of
paper and wrote upon it these two verses,â

âI have seen thee in a dreamâI have seen thee beside meâI drank
the cool dew of thy lips.

âYes, yes, we have passed the time together on the same
couch!â

He threw this paper to the young girl, who took it, and added
three other verses,â

[36]
âThou hast seen
aright: everything that thou darest to hope for thou shalt obtain,
even if the jealous one has his face dragged in the dust.

âYes, thou shalt pass the time by my side, between the bracelets
of my wrists: thou shalt come upon my lips and in my arms.

âWe shall be the first lovers who have been united in spite of
fate and the jealous one.â

She threw the paper to the singer, but the Kaliph stretched out
his hand and caught it as it passed, and read it. His eyes flashed,
and he exclaimed,â

âWhat motive has guided you? Is this an old intrigue, or is it
sudden love that has made you drunk?â

âBy the heaven above, it is the love of an instant. No word
bound as together.â

And tears of fear fell from their eyes. The Kaliphâs heart was
softened, and, turning to the singer, he said,â

âTake her, but never again appear in my sight.â

As I have said, Sultan Tyrab lived to a great age. He had many
wives and concubines, and thirty of his sons at a time were able to
ride on horseback: Mohammed Kourra was a mere boy when he entered
his service. The Sultan put him among the korkoas, or lancers, who
march behind the Sultan when he rides out, and guard him during his
audiences. But they are not exclusively devoted
[37]
to the guard of the prince, but
follow also the inferior governors. They suggest the idea of
authority. Kourra remained a certain time in this chosen corps, and
gave proof of great sagacity. Tyrab loved him, and placed him in
the service of the Saum-in-Dogolah, or imperial mansion, a place of
great consequence. In his new position, Kourra rendered himself
indispensable, and Tyrab generally consulted only him. This roused
the jealousy of his colleagues, and one day one of them said to the
Sultan, âKourra is a traitor: I see him every day with one of your
concubines, who slyly gives him the best dishes from the kitchen.â
The Sultan upon this determined to revenge himself, but Kourra,
hearing what had happened, took a knife, and, shutting himself up
alone in a hut, with his own hand mangled himself. Coming forth, he
presented himself before the Sultan who was in a neighbouring hut,
and said,ââI was accused of betraying thee, but that is now
impossible; I hope I shall no longer be suspected,â Then he
fainted, and the Sultan, deeply moved, ordered him be treated with
the greatest care.

When Kourra was cured, Tyrab gave him into the care of one of
his Viziers, the Emin Aly Wad Jami, and ordered him to be well
treated. The Emin received this charge with reluctance. But,
nevertheless, Kourra was at length named chief of the guard of the
Saum-in-Dogolah. In this position he distinguished himself by a
more economical and
[38]

methodical arrangement of the dishes supplied to each department of
the palace; so that every one was better satisfied than before, and
there remained sufficient to serve as presents to people who
happened to be receiving strangers. It was supposed that these
presents came from the Vizier, for Kourra had the prudence to
conceal his share in the matter. Many people came to give thanks
for what they had received, and he, whilst listening to them, was
puzzled, and could not understand wherefore they praised him. One
day, on coming out of the harem, he perceived Kourra distributing
dishes, and stopped and hid himself to listen. Presently he heard a
voice saying,ââHow many strangers are there with such a king?âââSo
many.âââThen take him so many dishes, and do not forget to say that
the Emin sent them.â In this way Kourra forwarded a variety of
presents, and the Vizier discovered the origin of the praises that
had been given him, and was pleased, and raised him to the rank of
superintendent of the studâa very high dignity. Kourra remained at
this post until he accompanied the Vizier to Kordofal with the
Sultan Tyrab.

I shall say a few words of the origin of this expedition. In
former days there was a Sultan, named Saloun, who divided with his
brother the country which they had inheritedâSaloun taking Darfur,
and his brother Kordofal, which had formerly been united under one
government. They swore never to undertake any intrigue one
against
[39]
the other,
and they and their descendants remained in peace for nearly two
centuries, until the time of Sultan Tyrab. Sultan Hashim, prince of
Kordofal, then collected a great army, and being of an ambitious
disposition, determined, it is said, to conquer Darfur. He began by
sending marauding parties to the frontiers, and when his cousin
wrote to him, begging to cease his molestations, answered
insolently. Tyrab, therefore, resolved to make war, or, at least,
chose this as a pretext. The real reason, however, was, that he had
formed a plan for breaking through the law of succession laid down
by Ahmed Bekr at his death. He wished to leave his throne to Izhak,
the Kaliph, and resolved to send the sons and grandsons of Ahmed
Bekr, and of the great people, into battle, that they might be
killed, and so that there should be nobody to oppose his designs.
His secret, however, was discovered, and, indeed, his whole plan
subsequently failed, by the death of his son, Izhak, who was killed
in battle, as will be seen.

At the news of the approach of Tyrab, Hashim fled away with his
suite and family, and took refuge in Sennaar, so that Kordofal was
conquered with ease. The Sultan ransacked the country, and reduced
the people to silence, and remained there until the next year, when
his troops and his followers loudly demanded to be allowed to
return to Darfur. He, however, pretended that Hashim was about to
return, and that it was necessary to remain to resist him. Soon,
however, the disgust of the army increased, and
[40]
secret councils began to be
held. At one of these, the Vizier, Ali Wad Bargou, whose daughter
Tyrab had married, said boldly,ââWhat will you give me if I kill
the Sultan? I will get rid of him, and you shall put in his place
whom you please.â Those whose children Tyrab had taken out to
expose them to the danger of being killed promised him great wealth
if he succeeded, and it was agreed that the roll of a drum should
give the signal of assistance.

At close of day Ali Bargou put on two cuirasses of solid mail,
and concealed them with his clothes and, taking his sword,
penetrated into the palace, where was his daughter. He knew the
love which Tyrab bore her, and thought that the prince might be
there; but he found only the princess, who at once perceived
something sinister in his countenance. Ali asked news of the
Sultan. She replied, that she would go and fetch him, and he told
her to do so; but at the same time she perceived the edge of the
cuirass shining above his garment, and went and betrayed him, and
the guards came, and, after a vigorous resistance, put him to
death. This done, the drum of alarm was beaten, and the Viziers and
other dignitaries began to collect, thinking that the conspiracy
had succeeded. They found the Sultan surrounded by his guards, and
dressed in a black garment, with a red turban pulled over his eyes.
These are the signs of anger. The corpse of Bargou was brought out,
wrapped in a cloak, and uncovered. âNow,â said Tyrab, âdo you know
who that is, and
[41]
why
he is here?â They thought themselves betrayed, and were humble, but
explained that they desired to return to their own country. Their
language revealed that there was danger of a revolt, and the Sultan
determined to temporise. He promised to return as soon as his
health was re-established, for he pretended to be ill, and soon
afterwards shut himself up in his palace, as if he were in danger.
For this deception he was punished. God afflicted him in reality
with disease, so he wrote a letter to the Kaliph, Izhak, begging
him to come and join him, and presently the news got abroad that he
was at the last extremity: some even said that he was really
dead.

Now, Mohammed Kourra used often to visit Kinaneh, the chief wife
of Tyrab, who bore the title of Yakoury, or queen, which, however,
is sometimes given to the other wives. This princess was a woman of
great sagacity, and, knowing that Tyrab was near death, spoke to
Kourra, and asked his advice. He replied, that the best plan would
be to follow the fortunes of the Orphan, to whom the empire would
certainly fall, and promised that he would get her named Yakoury,
and her son appointed Kaliph. Izhak was sprung from another
legitimate wife of Tyrab. Kourra made the treaty in secret, and
stipulated for the position of Ab, which is always held by an
eunuch. Meanwhile the illness of Tyrab increased, and he called his
Viziers around him, and expressed his last desires, especially
stipulating that
[42]
the
army should be placed under the orders of Izhak. They promised to
obey him, and retired. Shortly afterwards Tyrab died, and Kinaneh
immediately despatched Kourra to the Orphan with the chaplet of the
Sultan, his handkerchief, his seal, and his amulet, as a proof of
the death of the prince. The Viziers, who had received the last
orders of Tyrab, returned and found him dead. They regretted that
they had left him, and immediately embalmed the body, and placed it
in a palanquin, and intended to start for Darfur, pretending that
the Sultan was ill. Their object was to deliver the whole country
into the hands of Izhak. But Sheikh Kourra, in the meantime, had
gone to the Orphan, and told him what had happened, and he came to
the palace with two of his elder brothers, and caused it to be
understood that they knew what had occurred. The Viziers, who
wished to obey the last orders of Tyrab, were astonished, and began
to fear that their plan would fail; but among them was the Emin Aly
Wad Jami, who declared that he would abide by the orders he had
received. So he called Kourra, and said to him,ââGo, and tell my
son, Mohammed, to arm his soldiers, and come to the palace.â But
Kourra, who had gone over to the party of the Orphan, ordered the
soldiers to place themselves under his command; and Aly Jami,
finding himself betrayed, poisoned himself.

CHAPTER IV.

New Sultan â Anecdotes of the Orphan â Death of
Izhak â Just Administration â The Ulemas â A Mamlook Refugee â
Conspiracy â How it was defeated â The Reward of Kinaneh â An
ignorant Vizier â Mohammed Kourra â Instance of his great Wisdom â
He is appointed Ab â Death of Abd-er-Rahman â Fadhl succeeds to the
Throne.

It
was now necessary to
proceed to the election of a new Sultan, and after some discussion
the council of princes procured the setting aside of Riz, on
account of his violent character, and of Tahir, on account of the
number of his children, and placed Abd-er-Rahman, the Orphan, upon
the throne. Every one was satisfied with the choice, and great
rejoicings filled the country.

The youth of Abd-er-Rahman had been exemplary. He had learned
the Koran by heart, and had applied himself to the study of laws.
He had never imitated the bad habits common to the sons of the
Sultans of Darfur, who used to ride through the country and treat
every Forian as if he had been a slave. From his earliest age he
had been without
[44]

reproach, and pure, and if he arrived, during his travels, at any
place, he used to say, âI am the host of God,â and if he were well
received, he remained, and, if not, he went his way. It is related
that, in one of his travels, he put up in the house of a man
belonging to the Berli tribe. This man recognised him, and killed a
fat sheep for his sake. Upon which the Orphan said,â

âMy friend, might we not have been satisfied with less than
this? If thou hadst killed a fowl, it would have been
sufficient.â

âNo, my master, no! I swear by God, if I had possessed a
she-camel, I would have killed it for thee! Art thou not
Abd-er-Rahman, the son of our Sultan?â

âAnd how dost thou know me?â

âI know thee by thy virtues and thy piety, and I predict that
days of glory await thee.â

âThen I, too, swear by the name of God, that if ever I become
king, I will give thee wherewith to enjoy better cheer than
this!â

He kept his promise, and when he became Sultan appointed his
host to be tax-gatherer over the Arab tribe called the Madmen. Many
similar stories are told of him, and the country was full of
predictions that it would be the Orphan who would succeed Tyrab.
The latter prince once tried to poison him, but failed. It was
generally reported that his love of science overcame all other
passions. He went about in an old ragged shirt, with a
wooden
[45]
chaplet in his
hand. He remained in celibacy until his beard began to whiten,
being, in fact, too poor to buy a slave or to marry. He never had a
companion until, on his way to Kordofal with his brother, the
Sultan, a king gave him as a present an ugly slave, named Anbousah,
by whom he had a son, the Sultan Mohammed Fadhl, who now
reigns.

Abd-er-Rahman distinguished himself by vigour at the outset of
his reign, abolished the custom of seven days of laziness after the
inauguration, and prepared to depart for Darfur, and dispute the
possession of the country with Izhak. The two hostile armies met
and fought twice. During the second battle, it is said, at mid-day
the stars appeared in the sky. I have seen the battle-field; it is
perfectly arid, and I was told that no plant would grow there on
account of the quantity of blood that had been spilt. Izhak was
defeated on both occasions, and retired into the northern
provinces, where he reigned for some time with great cruelty, and
gained some advantages in the war that ensued. The struggle
continued for a long time, until the Kaliph was killed in a battle
by Zabady, an Egyptian fellah, who shot him from a distance. This
ended the war, and Abd-er-Rahman became sovereign of the whole
country, and established his Fasher at Tendelty.

When the Orphan was free from the anxieties of war he applied
himself to administrative reforms,
[46]
and did everything he could to increase the
prosperity of the country. He repressed the habit of drunkenness
and debauchery that had prevailed, and rendered the roads so secure
that a woman could travel there with all her ornaments. Commerce
increased, and comfort was spread through the country. Justice and
equity prevailed. He had no pity on those who committed an act of
violence or spoliation of any kind, however nearly related.

It has been related to me that he was once met, as he returned
from the chase, by two Arabs, one of whom addressed him in these
words:ââAn injustice has been done me, O Rashid!
[9]
may
God preserve thee, an injustice has been done me!â Now, it is the
custom among the Forians, that whoever has been a victim of
violence utters the cry called Karourak, which is never uttered on
any other occasion. The sound is produced by the help of two
fingers inserted into the mouth, and moved rapidly from side to
side, whilst the letter K is intonated, followed by a paralysed R.
Well, one of our Arabs was rolling the Karourak, and repeating âMay
God preserve the Rashid, I am the victim of an injustice!â but the
Sultan, at first, paid no heed, either being occupied by some idea,
or not hearing, on account of the sound of the tambourines, and the
songs and the hurrahs of the soldiers. The Arab had Karouraked
several times, and the Sultan
[47]
had not asked the reason. Then the other Arab
said to his companion, âLet him alone; Rashid is all for himself,
and cares nothing for thee.â The Sultan heard these words, and
asked what was meant. The man replied,â

âMy friend here has Karouraked several times, and has complained
to thee. This was the origin of my remark.â

The Sultan smiled, and said,â

âNot so, I am not all for myself. Who has done thee injury?â

âBasy-Khabir.â
[10]

Now, Basy-Khabir was one of the relations of the Orphan, who,
however, asked,ââWhat has he taken from thee?â

âHe has taken five she-camels.â

The Sultan inquired into this charge, and having found it to be
true, condemned Khabir to give back ten camels instead of five.

Abd-er-Rahman nominated, as he had promised, Mohammed Kourra to
the post of Father-Sheikh, the highest dignity in Darfur. He who
bears it is invested with the right of life and death, and has a
court and insignia like the Sultan. No one but an eunuch can occupy
this post, because it is feared that whoever occupies it may be
induced to conspire to raise himself to the throne. When Kourra was
confirmed in his dignity of Ab, the Sultan sent him
[48]
to the provinces, and he
established himself at Aboul-Joudoul.

If the Sultan was severe towards criminals, he was remarkable
for his benevolence for Ulemas and Shereefs, and other learned men,
who came flocking to visit him from all sides. Among these was my
father, who, when he arrived in Darfur, had gone to live at Kobeih,
in the house of a sheikh. Many of the principal learned men of the
country came here to visit him, and beg him to explain the book of
the Sheikh Khalil on Muslim canon law, which he did. The news of
his learning came to the ears of the Sultan, who called him to his
court, and lodged him in the house of one of his sons-in-law, named
Nour-el-Ansary. This man was a Fakih, and loved knowledge. He
studied with my father, and spoke of his learning to the Sultan,
who read on scientific subjects with my father during the month of
Ramadhan. He also requested my father to comment for him the book
on the privileges accorded by God to the Prophet, by a Turkish
writer, and he produced a commentary, called âThe Perfect Pearl,â
which he afterwards followed by another work of the same nature,
called âThe Equal Pearls.â

Abd-er-Rahman was likewise generous, as well as just and pure in
manners. He was of middle size, of a dark black complexion, with a
beard speckled with white, and a coarse and deep voice. He easily
became angry, but he calmed promptly, and pardoned easily. He was
possessed of presence of mind and
[49]
tact, of which I shall give some examples.
When the French came to Cairo, and the Mamlouks were driven away,
one of the Kashefs, named Zawanah, fled to Darfur, along with about
ten other Mamlouks. He had with him also considerable property,
with camels, servants, a cook, a valet, and several grooms; he had
also with him a cannon and a howitzer. Upon his arrival, he was
well received by Abd-er-Rahman, who gave him a dwelling-place, and
assigned to him a revenue, and bestowed upon him numerous female
slaves. After a little while he begged permission to build a house,
like those of Cairo; and, having caused bricks to be baked, got
together a number of workmen, chosen among the black slaves, to cut
stones, and constructed a habitation of some grandeur. He
surrounded it by a wall of extraordinary solidity, with two
embrasures turned towards the palace, which this little fortress
completely commanded. The fact was, that this Ghouz had formed the
mad plan of killing Abd-er-Rahman, and seizing on the government of
Darfur. His idea was, that some day, when the Sultan came out with
his courtiers, he would fire a volley of grape-shot among them, and
thus clear the way to the throne.

However, Zawanah feared, that after the accomplishment of the
assassination of the Orphan, the Forians would refuse to obey him.
He therefore put himself in communication with the prince, whose
sister had married Sultan Tyrab, and proposed to him that they
should put his nephew on the throne.
[50]
The prince agreed to this project, and the
conspiracy widened, until one of the chief courtiers was tampered
with. This man went and betrayed the whole to the Sultan, who told
him to seem to consent, and to keep the secret. Next day Zawanah
went to visit Abd-er-Rahman, who received him with more distinction
than ever, and presented him with a hundred male slaves, and a
hundred female slaves, and a hundred she-camels, and a hundred jars
of butter, and a hundred jars of honey, and a hundred loads of
millet. He clothed him also in a red shawl and a piece of red
cloth, and girded him with the sword, and gave him a horse with a
saddle embroidered with gold. The Kashef, transported with joy,
departed. âThese objects,â said he, âare sent to me by God, to help
me towards success!â In the evening, an hour and a-half after the
setting of the sun, the Sultan called one of the kings, and ordered
him to be on the watch with his soldiers for the time when Zawanah
should return to the palace, and then to go and seize his house,
and take possession of everything it contained.

These orders having been given, the Sultan sent a lad to the
Kashef, to invite him to spend the evening, and he came
immediately, and was received with politeness. Some of his servants
tried to follow him, but were stopped at the third gate, and told
to wait for their master. Abd-er-Rahman sat conversing with the
Kashef until a late hour, when he began to say, âI am very hungry,â
and ordered food to be
[51]
brought. A piece of roast meat was placed
before them, and a knife was called for, but none was at hand. Upon
this the Kashef produced one, and wished to carve; but some of
those present begged him not to give himself that trouble, and took
away the knife. He then produced his poignard, which was also taken
from him. The Sultan now gave a signal, and Zawanah was seized and
bound.

âWhat evil have I done thee,â said the prince, âthat thou
shouldest seek to assassinate me, to seduce my soldiers, and lead
them to revolt?â

âPrince, listen to me!â

âGod will not listen to thee, even if I were to listen;â and he
gave orders that the Kashef should be put to death immediately.
They cut his throat as they would that of a sheep. Shortly
afterwards they brought to the palace all the wealth that the
Kashef possessed, and there remained nothing in the house, which
was demolished, so that not a trace was left.
[11]

The servants and people of Zawanah were pardoned, but all the
natives who had been connected with the conspiracy were, one by
one, at different times, seized and put to death. The
brother-in-law of Tyrab, among others, after having been
allowed
[52]
for some time
to suppose that he was not suspected, was put to death much in the
same way as Zawanah, and all his property was confiscated. All this
was accomplished in the adroitest manner possible; and, one by one,
the whole of Abd-er-Rahmanâs enemies fell before him.

It will be remembered that he had promised great privilege and
power to the Yakoury Kinaneh; but, when he had reached the throne,
he neglected to fulfil the promises he had made, either on account
of business, which occupied him, or because he feared something
from this clever woman or her son, Habib. Angry at this
indifference, and finding herself forgotten in the harem, and
separated from her son, who lived at a distance, the Yakoury set on
foot a conspiracy to place Habib on the throne, for she had lost
all hope of his elevation, according to the arrangement made, since
a new son had been born to Abd-er-Rahman. This prince, however,
though he had neglected her, had maintained her in the rank of
Yakoury, having supreme authority in the interior of the
palace.

She set about the execution of her project in the following
manner:â

âMy son,â said she to Abd-er-Rahman, âwishes to give a great
feast, and I should be glad to help him by sending dishes from
hence.â

The Sultan gave permission, and she accordingly prepared great
wooden bowls, and placed therein coats of mail and swords, and put
food upon the top, and
[53]
sent forth a hundred at a time, in order to
prepare for an insurrection. Having succeeded the first time, she
allowed some days to pass, and again asked permission to send to
her son the materials of a second repast. Again the Sultan
consented, for he did not suspect that Kinaneh harboured any evil
design against him, for he was a man without guile or thought of
evil.

Kinaneh was successful a second time, and, some days afterwards,
she determined to make a third attempt. But, about this time,
Abd-er-Rahman perceived, by accident, with Kinaneh, a young girl
whom she was bringing up, and who was of high birth and
extraordinary beauty. He became enamoured of her, and resolved to
speak to the Yakoury, that he might marry her; but Kinaneh, who had
seen the effect produced by the girlâs beauty, and who destined her
for her son Habib, punished her for allowing herself to be seen.
This was the cause of the failure of her conspiracy. The girl,
angered by her ill-treatment, and knowing of her conspiracy,
escaped, and went and spoke secretly to the Sultan, and announced
to him that Kinaneh was carrying away weapons from the armoury of
his highness, and that all the dishes sent for the festivals
concealed cuirasses and swords.

âIf you doubt the truth of this,â said she, âupset one of the
bowls which are to be carried forth to-morrow, and you will be
convinced.â

The Sultan begged her not to speak of what she
[54]
knew to any one, and she left
him agitated and disquieted.

Next day Abd-er-Rahman was informed, by a man whom he had set as
a watch, that the bowls destined for Habib were about to be carried
forth. He went immediately and ordered the covers to be taken off,
that he might look at the dishes prepared. Among them was one of
which he was very fond, so he said,â

âLeave me this, and pour it out into little vases; I want to eat
of it.â

The slaves were about to obey, when Kinaneh came in hastily, and
said,â

âPrince, I conjure you not to touch these dishes. I will prepare
for you exactly similar.â

âNo,â said he, âfor what you may now make may not please me so
well.â

Kinaneh was obliged to yield, and said,â

âWell, let the slaves carry away the others, and keep that
one.â

âNo,â said he, âempty it, and when you have filled it again, you
may take away the whole together.â

So the bowl was emptied, and a cuirass was found at the
bottom.

âOh!â said the Sultan, âwhat is this?â

Kinaneh was troubled, and knew not what to answer. She was
immediately seized, and all the bowls were upset, and found to be
full of weapons and money.

[55]
âWhat evil have I
done to thee?â said the Sultan to the Yakoury. âWherefore dost thou
conspire against me?â

Kinaneh had nothing to say in reply, and she was immediately put
to death. Her son was seized and sent into prison, in the Marrah
mountains, and all his wealth was confiscated. As for his
accomplices, they were put to death every one, and the country
remained tranquil.

Abd-er-Rahman raised to the post of Vizier the Fakih
Malik-el-Foutawy, whom he believed to be a man of knowledge and
property. This man pretended to know the secret of letters and
sciences, although his ignorance was complete. He affected great
piety and contempt of the things of this world. When he was raised
to the Viziership, he caused to be placed under his authority all
the Fullans of Darfur, for he was of that race himself; and he took
their part, and protected them even against just complaints. My
father has related to me, as an instance of the ignorance of this
Vizier, that the Sultan begged him to preach on the day of the
festival of Bairam. He asked my father to compose his oration for
him. So he composed it, and wrote at the end:ââBy the servant of
God, the humble one, who implores his bounty, Omar of Tunis, son of
Suleiman, on such a day, of such a year;â and delivered the paper
to the Fakih. On the day of the festival, having prayed with the
Sultan, the Fakih got into the pulpit, and delivered his sermon
with great energy, ending with
[56]
these words:ââBy the servant of God, the
humble one, who implores his bounty, Omar of Tunis, son of
Suleiman, on such a day, of such a year.â He thought this was part
of the sermon.

Let us now return to Mohammed Kourra. The Sultan considerably
extended the power of this Sheikh, and raised him so high that
nobody in the state could approach him. Now the news came that
Hashim, who had been expelled from Kordofal by Tyrab, had returned,
and retaken the country; so Abd-er-Rahman got together a great
army, and placed it under the command of Kourra, who departed, and
completely succeeded. He reconquered Kordofal, and drove Hashim
into the desert. He remained seven years in that country, sending,
from time to time, great riches to his sovereign. But jealous
enemies calumniated him, and Abd-er-Rahman sent a general, with an
army, to replace him. His object was to test the submission of
Kourra. So he gave to the general a pair of fetters, telling him to
put them upon Kourraâs feet, and send him back to Darfur. When the
general arrived in Kordofal he went to Kourra, expecting to meet
with resistance, but the Ab said,â

âWho has ordered thee, and what must be done?â

âI must put these fetters on thy feet, and send thee to the
Sultan.â

âI am ready. Give me the fetters.â

Kourra put them on with his own hand, and
[57]
called a workman to rivet them, and next
day set out, and in due time arrived in Darfur.

When the Sultan heard of what had taken place, he said to his
courtiers: âWas I not right to say that Kourra would never revolt
against me?â And he sent a person to take off his fetters, and
received the Ab with great state, and gave him a pair of bracelets
of gold, and raised him to a still higher degree of dignity and
power. This wise conduct was afterwards useful to his son, Mohammed
Fadhl. For, when Abd-er-Rahman died, the Ab took charge of the
interests of this prince, and succeeded in placing him upon the
throne. Great energy was required to bring about this result, and
an insurrection took place against the new Sultan, who, in fact,
was a mere boy. Kourra did all he could to instruct him, and to
improve his mind, and to prepare him for government. Fadhl was not
a willing scholar, but he was compelled to obey, and he passed two
years in study, which to him was intolerably disagreeable. During
this time Kourra governed with a strong hand, and kept the country
quiet; but the people around the court, discontented with his
severity, at length excited the Sultan to get rid of him. Kourra,
therefore, was obliged to defend himself by arms, and shortly
afterwards perished, as we have already related, and God knows all
things!

Darfur
, or, more properly,
Dar-el-fur, the country of Fur, is the third kingdom of Soudan,
counting from east to west. The first is Sennaar; the second
Kordofal; the fourth is WadaÃ¯; the fifth Bagirmeh; the sixth
Bornou; the seventh Adagez;
[13]
the eighth Afnou; the
ninth Timbuktou; the tenth Dar-Mella, where resides the King of the
Fullan, or Fellatahs.

Formerly, the name of Takrour was applied only to the
inhabitants of Bornou, but it is now extended
[59]
to all the people who live between the
eastern limit of WadaÃ¯ and the western limit of Bornou; so that it
includes, besides these two countries, Bagirmeh, Katakou, and
Mandarah. Some days ago I met, at Cairo, an individual whom I
recognised as a Soudanee. I asked him to what country he belonged.
He replied, âI am a Takrour.â âBut from what place?â said I. After
some difficulty, he replied that he was from Bagirmeh.

Darfur is bounded on the east by a sandy and nearly sterile
country, and the same description applies to the provinces situated
between it and WadaÃ¯. Southward are vast plains, stretching to
Dar-fertit, and to the north is the desert, which I have described
on my way from Egypt. The country, which is forty days in length
from north to south, and eighteen daysâ breadth, is divided into
numerous provinces, each under the authority of a governor. Some of
these governors bear the title of Sultan, but they are all
dependent on the Sultan of Darfur. Their mode of life is very
similar, and their costume is uniform, except in the case of the
Tunjour, who wear a black turban. I asked one of them the reason.
He told me that his ancestors had formerly been sovereigns of the
whole country, but had been dispossessed by the Forians, and that,
since that time, they had worn the black turban as a sign of
mourning.

On the east and south, Darfur is surrounded by tribes of
wandering Arabs, whose wealth consists
[60]
in cattle, horses, and furniture. They lead a
nomadic life, going from pasturage to pasturage. Some of them
possess great herds of camels. The Sultan of Darfur claims from
them an annual impost, which they sometimes refuse. The Red
Masirieh and the Rezeigat, being the most powerful and most distant
in the desert, only give the refuse of their flocks. The agent who
is sent to collect the tribute is sometimes beaten and killed.
Attempts have been made to punish them by force, but they are
generally repulsed with loss. The Arabs retire, if too hotly
attacked, with their flocks into the Barajoub, a country situated
to the south-east of Darfur. It is a vast marsh, ten daysâ journey
in extent, but covered with thick forest. Rain is said to fall
there all the year round, except during two months.

The whole country of Darfur, on both sides of the chain of
mountains, and north and south, is inhabited by a variety of tribes
which do not belong, properly speaking, to the Forian race. The
latter, who speak a language apart, occupy the range of mountains,
but have conquered the whole surrounding country. There are in the
country also a number of people of mixed race, children of
strangers.

The districts on the northern frontier are the most fully
populated. They are called Zaghawah and Berti, and exhibit a
remarkable contrast; the people of the latter being gentle and
good, and of
[61]

agreeable physiognomy, with women of remarkable beauty, whilst the
people of the latter are different from them in every respect. The
corresponding districts, at the southern extremity, are Dajo and
Bijo, and the women of the latter are also more beautiful than the
women of the former. The people of Birguid and of Tunjour, who
occupy the middle provinces, are not contrasted by personal
appearance, but by character; the former being treacherous,
dishonest, and rapacious, without fear of God or the Prophet,
whilst the latter have a certain amount of religion and
intelligence. The mountaineers of Marrah are all savage and brutal
in the same degree, except that at Dar-Abbima, towards the south,
both men and women are more affable and of more agreeable aspect.
Glory be to the Creator, who has permitted these striking
contrasts! At Dar-el-Massalit the beauty of the women is ravishing,
silencing the reason and captivating the heart. Nevertheless, the
most beautiful women who are found in Darfur are, without
exception, those of Arab descent; and the same remark applies to
the men.

All the provinces of Darfur, properly so called, are divided
into lots, which constitute so many properties, each belonging to
one of the high dignitaries of the state. The two largest appanages
of this kind are those of Abdima and Tekeniwi. They each have under
their orders twelve governors, bearing the title of âShartay,â or
prefect. The Aba Oma has under his orders four governors; the
For-an-Aba has also
[62]

four governors, and the Ab-Sheikh four. Besides the territories
specially assigned to these great functionaries, there are portions
kept for the Emins, Shereefs, Kadis, &c. In this way it happens
that the Sultan really possesses only certain domains, as Guerly,
Tendelty, &c.

About one-half of Darfur is plain country. Towards the east the
land is almost entirely sandy, but the slopes of Mount Marrah are
composed of black mould. This chain, as I have said, traverses
nearly the whole length of Darfur, but is cut into a variety of
groups, by transversal defiles. On this kind of sierra are
established numerous populous tribes. Among these are the Kunjarah,
from which are derived the Sultans of Darfur. In this range are
hollowed out an enormous quantity of caverns, some of which are
used as prisons for the sons of princes, others for viziers,
&c.

The Forians of Marrah are well off, possessing abundance of oxen
and sheep. There is no other province the inhabitants of which can
be compared to these mountaineers. All their flocks and herds feed
alone, without guard, and no care is taken against robbers, or
against lions, or against wolves.

In the year 1220 of the Hegira (1805
A.D.
) I asked permission of Sultan Mohammed Fadhl to
go and visit the mountain of Marrah, with a firman from him. He
hesitated at first, fearing for me, on account of the savageness of
the inhabitants, but afterwards he allowed me to depart. He gave
me
[63]
an escort and a
firman, addressed to all the governors of the mountains, enjoining
them to aid and protect me, and allow me to see every thing that
was curious, whether apparent or hidden. I started, accordingly,
with two Falkanahwy, or policemen, two of my own slaves, and an
inhabitant of my village. We marched for two days, and the third we
arrived near the mountain, and came to a village called Numleh, the
chief of which was Fakih-Nemr. This Nemr had two sons. We stopped
at their house, and were received with politeness. Having explained
the object of our journey, and exhibited our firman, they prepared
to honour us, and served up an excellent meal. Next day we went to
see the market of Numleh, which is held every Monday,â men and
women crowding thither from all parts of the mountain, to buy and
sell. I beheld there a remarkably black population, with blood-shot
eyes and reddish teeth. When I appeared, the astonished crowd
collected around me: they marvelled at my brown complexion, flushed
with red. Every one came in a succession of crowds to examine me.
They had never seen before an Arab of my colour, and it entered
into their heads that it would be a curious thing to kill me, that
they might examine me more at their leisure. But I did not
understand the subject of their discussion until I saw my escort
draw their swords, and interpose between the crowd and me. I asked
what was the reason of this movement, and they answered,â

[64]
âThese blacks wish
to kill thee.â

âAnd wherefore?â

âThey are ignorant brutes, and say that thou camest into the
world before thy time; that thou art not a ripe man. Others pretend
that thy skin is so thin that, if a fly were to prick thee, all thy
blood would start out. Another has proposed to give thee a wound,
to discover how long it would take to empty thy veins. This is why
we feared for thy life.â

My people took me away from the market, beating back the crowd
as we went. It was with some difficulty that we escaped. From
thence we proceeded to a valley, which we found to be shaded by
date-trees and bananas, and some lemon-trees, and plentifully sown
with onions, garlic, red-pepper, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, and
short and long cucumbers. It was autumn, and the dates were just
beginning to blush. They cut for me two clusters of the red fruit,
and two clusters of the yellow, and they gave me a great gourd full
of honey, of which I have never tasted or smelt the equal. We
passed the night pleasantly in that place, and in the morning began
traversing a series of valleys, divided by ranges of hills, each
about a mile in breadth. Everywhere was a luxuriant cultivation,
and the running streams, that glanced over their sandy beds, seemed
like streaks of silver. Each valley is bordered on either hand by a
kind of hedge of trees, which cause it to resemble a winding
avenue.
[65]
We sat down
in a shady place: a fat kid was killed, and we feasted upon it with
delight. We then proceeded to a village at the foot of the
mountain, where we were well received, and rested till next
morning, when we climbed the great range. We were three hours in
reaching the summit. On all sides, upon the slopes, we saw numerous
villages, and an ample population. We were taken to the Sheikh of
the mountain, named Abou-Bekr, whom we found alone. He was a very
old man, covered with wrinkles. When we had saluted him, he
welcomed us, and bade us sit down.

It is remarkable, that the summit of these mountains is only
completely free from clouds for a few days of the year. There is
sufficient rain to allow wheat to come to perfection. Few harvests
can be compared to these, except those of Barbary and Europe. The
rest of Darfur, with the exception of a few cantons, where
well-water is used, does not produce wheat. On a certain day of the
year the Sheikh, or Old Man of the Mountain, of whom we have
spoken, is visited in crowds by the people for consultation. On
that solemn day, set apart for divination, he predicts what is to
come to pass during the year,âdrought or rain, war or peace,
serenity or misfortune, disease or health. His prophecies are
profoundly believed; but the Forians differ in opinion about the
source and the cause of the power which he possesses of seeing into
the future. Some pretend that he works by Divine
[66]
inspiration, and that he who
wears the dignity of Sheikh of the Mountain, is necessarily, and
always, illuminated of God, and a holy personage. This is the
explanation of the learned men of Darfur. Others declare that the
genii tell him what is to come to pass. For my part, I do not know
what value should be assigned to these two opinions; but this I do
know, that many prophecies are attributed to him which have not
been fulfilled.

On hearing the contents of our firman, the Old Man of the
Mountain overwhelmed us with kindness, and ordered a meal to be
prepared. Then he sent out some one to the east of the hill with
orders to beat the great tambourine, called âTenbel,â and presently
from all sides numerous people came streaming towards us. From the
crowd thus collected he chose a hundred young men, and appointed
over them, as chief, one of his relations, called the Fakih Zaid,
celebrated for his courage. He expressly ordered this troop not to
quit me for a moment, and to be ever on their guard against the
rustic brutality of the mountaineers.

We got on horseback and rode away over the high land towards a
solitary peak which specially bears the name of Marrah, and from
which the whole chain has so been called. There we found a kind of
small oratory, esteemed highly sacred by the people, who venerate
it equally with the mosques. An enormous tree overshadows this
oratory, on which the sun never shines. We entered and sat
down
[67]
awhile. There
are several servants of the place whose duty it is to keep it
clean, and to receive the offerings or ex-votoes of visitors.

Proceeding on our journey, the soldiers of Zaid marching in
front, we soon beheld a multitude of men and women running towards
us from all sides. I was looked upon as an extraordinary being.
There was a perfect scramble to get sight of me. They pushed and
shoved one another, and though the escort closed around they could
scarcely keep off the crowd. These strange people were saying one
to the other, âThe Sultan has sent to us a man born before his
time, that we may eat him.â Others exclaimed, âNo; this is not a
human being, but an animal under the form of a man, whose flesh is
good to eat.â These mountaineers cannot believe in the existence of
men with white skins and rosy complexions.

These savages know of Arabic only the few words which compose
the confession of faith, and these they pronounce wildly with a
broken, jerking manner. However, the agreeable reflections of the
populace were translated to me, and I became afraid. Zaid also,
finding it impossible to keep off the crowd in any other way, told
me to hide my face in the shawl of my turban, leaving only my eyes
visible; so I veiled myself and stood in the midst of the soldiers.
The negroes, no longer seeing my face, were stupified and
said,â

âWhere is the red fellow?â

[68]
âHe has returned
to the Sultan,â was the reply, and by degrees they left us.

We now proceeded to the state-prisons, that is to say, the
caverns where the sons of princes and viziers are incarcerated. The
gaolers at first plumply refused admission, and we almost came to a
serious quarrel, but Zaid read out my firman, and the chief was
calmed. He then said that I might go into the caverns alone, if I
pleased, but that my companions must remain aloof. I refused to
take advantage of this permission, fearing that some evil might
befall me, and expressed my wish to depart.

It is the custom among the mountaineers of Marrah, that no one
shall marry a woman until he has lived with her, and had by her one
or two children, and thus convinced himself that she is fruitful.
Then the man remains with the woman, and regards her as his wife.
Women do not, as with us, avoid the society of men. If a husband,
on returning home, finds his wife conversing with a man, he is not
angry unless with good cause. Young boys and girls do not conceal
any part of their bodies until the age of puberty. At that age the
boys wear a shirt and the girls a kind of short petticoat; but from
the navel upwards they remain quite naked.

The Forians of Marrah are brutal and passionate, especially in a
state of drunkenness. They are excessively avaricious, and never
receive any guests besides their parents, except for interested
motives. They have no idea of cleanliness, no variety or
art
[69]
in the
preparation of their food; they eat indifferently whatever they see
that seems eatable. Bitter or rotten substances are not cast away,
and they sometimes even prefer this kind of food to others. In
every village the young men have a chief whom they call Wornan, and
the young girls also have a chief called Meirem. On days of
rejoicing, festivals and ceremonies, the Wornan assembles his lads,
and all go and sit down in a large place. Then the Meirem appears
with her damsels, and advances a little a-head of them and sits
down. The chief of the young men comes forward and talks with her,
and then she orders her girls to divide themselves among the
youths; so each one takes away a companion and goes and passes the
time where he pleases.

In Darfur the men devote themselves alone to no trade except
that of war, from which alone the women are dispensed. Both sexes
follow their occupations pell-mell, except that the most fatiguing
work is given to the women. Men and women remain always together
night and day; and it is remarkable that, contrary to the opinion
of Europe, the constant society of the female sex does not in any
way soften the manners of the country. The people of Marrah do not
consume the wheat which they harvest, but sell it and buy
millet.

The most singular thing I heard related whilst I was in these
mountains is this, that the genii act as guardians of the cattle.
It is for this reason that
[70]
the herds are left to wander where they will.
Many persons assured me seriously that if any one, passing near a
flock and seeing it without a guard, should attempt to steal a
sheep or a cow, and to kill the beast, his hand, still armed with
the knife, would remain fastened to the throat until the arrival of
the owner. I have a hundred times heard instances of protection
afforded by the genii, but was at first inclined to reject the
whole as lies and dreams. But this is what happened to myself.
Being near the Marrah mountains I went to a person of Numleh, to
question him about the genii. On drawing near his hut I saw nobody,
but began to call him by his name. Then a loud and terrible voice,
which made me shiver, shouted âAkibe!â that is to say, âHe is not
here.â Nevertheless, I was going to advance and pursue my
inquiries, when an individual, who was passing by me, took me by
the arm and drew me away, saying,â

âBe off! be off! He who speaks to thee is not a human
being.â

âAnd what is he, then?â

âHe is the guardian genius of the hut. Nearly every one of us is
thus protected. We call the genii in Forian, Damzog.â

Upon this I feared and withdrew.

On returning from the Marrah to the Fasher, I went to visit the
Shereef Ahmed Bedawee, who had brought me from Cairo to Darfur, and
related to him
[71]
this
adventure and my terror. âThe man was perfectly right,â said Ahmed,
who went on to relate to me things still more wonderful. âAt the
time when I first began to trade, my friend, I often heard that
damzogs could be bought and sold, and that to procure one I must
apply to the owner of a damzog, and discuss the price with him.
When the bargain is concluded, it is necessary to give a large
gourd of milk to the seller, who takes it to his house, where are
his damzogs. On entering he salutes them, and goes and hangs up his
vase to a hook, saying,ââOne of my friendsâsuch a oneâvery rich, is
in fear of robbers, and asks me to supply him with a guardian. Will
one of you go and live in his house? There is plenty of milk there,
for it is a house of blessing, and the proof thereof is, that I
bring you this kara of milk.â The damzogs at first refuse to comply
with the invitation. âNo, no,â say they, ânot one of us will go.â
The master of the hut conjures them to comply with his desires,
saying,ââOh! let the one that is willing descend into the kara.â He
then retires a little, and presently one of the damzogs is heard to
flop into the milk, upon which he hastens and claps upon the vase a
cover made of date-leaves. Thus stopped up he unhooks the kara, and
hands it over to the buyer, who takes it away and hangs it on the
wall of his hut, and confides it to the care of a slave or of a
wife, who every morning comes and takes it, emptying out the milk,
washing it and re-plenishing
[72]
it, and hanging it up again. From that time
forward the house is safe from theft or loss. For my part, I
believed all these things to be absurdities.

âWell, my wealth increased; but my slaves and servants
constantly robbed me. Vainly did I have recourse to all kinds of
means to prevent them; I was always duped. One day I complained to
a friend, who recommended me to buy a damzog, certifying that I
should be thus effectually protected. The desire of preserving my
property induced me to comply, and so I went to a possessor of
damzogs, and bought one in the way I have described. I appointed a
slave to watch over the kara, and from that day forward I was free
from care. I even left my warehouse-door open, and nobody in my
absence dared to approach. I had there considerable wealth and
abundance of merchandise. If anybody attempted to steal he was
immediately prevented by the damzog. In this way he killed several
of my slaves.

âMy son, Mohammed, was now growing up. The love of women was his
chief passion. He wished, in order to enable him to pursue his
conquests with greater ease, to make some presents of beads and
ornaments. So he watched a favourable moment, and one day, without
my perceiving it, took the keys of the workshop and opened it; but
he had scarcely entered it when the damzog broke his neck,
and
[73]
killed him on the
spot. I loved my son tenderly. The news of his death was a
thunderbolt to me. My grief was indescribable. I inquired into the
cause of his death, and was told that he was attempting to take my
goods when the damzog killed him. Then I swore that the damzog
should no longer remain in my house, and endeavoured to drive it
away, but in vain. I took counsel of a friend, who said to
me:ââPrepare a great repast, and invite a number of guests, warning
them to come in a single troop, armed with guns and powder. They
must all together fire a volley at the entrance of thy workshop,
shouting aloud in Forian, âDamzog ah aiye?ââ Where is the damzog?
The volleys must be repeated, always accompanied by the same cry,
and the crowd must enter the place where the merchandise is guarded
by the genius. In general the damzog is frightened, and flies
away.â I performed this ceremony, and thanks be to God the damzog
disappeared.â

It has often been related to me, that among the great drums, or
tymbals, preserved in the dwelling of the Sultan, there is one
called the âVictorious,â especially patronised by the damzogs, and
that sometimes this instrument resounds when no one is near. This
phenomenon announces that some great event is about to happenâsome
foreign or intestine war.

The habits and manners of the other tribes of Darfur, such as
the Berti, the Dajo, the Bijo, &c., are pretty nearly the same
as those of the people of
[74]
Marrah. If some of them differ by being more
hospitable and benevolent, they owe this improvement to association
with Bedawin Arabs, and of the merchants who come to them from
Egypt and other distant countries. Those who received strangers
best are those who speak the Arabic language.

CHAPTER VI.

Philosophy of Geography â Absolute Authority of

Customs â Public Audiences â Servility â Barbarian Etiquette â

In
examining the different
forms of empire, the varieties of tastes and habits, it is evident
that the great Creatorâmay His Majesty be glorified!âhas multiplied
their different aspects in order to show us the immensity of his
power and the profoundness of his wisdom. Moreover, God has
impressed a different character on every climate. There are cold
climates and hot climates, and temperate climates, according to
their distance from the equinoctial line. If God had wished it, he
could have made of all nations a single nation; but he has assigned
to them dissemblances, in order to incite men to travel, and to
learn that of which they are ignorant. Having stated these truths,
let us come to the point.

The Forian princes have customs different from those of other
princes. The sovereign of Darfur
[76]
exercises boundless despotic power. He may
put to death thousands of individuals, and no one asks him
wherefore. He may degrade whom he pleases, and no one asks him
wherefore. His orders, however adverse they may be, are always
obeyed, and no one resists, even by a word. The only resource is to
cry for mercy; but, if the Sultan chooses to commit an act of
injustice, the hatred it excites remains for ever concealed.

In Darfur the sovereign must be of the blood of the Sultans. No
stranger, not even a descendant of the Prophet, can pretend to the
throne. When a prince is invested with power, he rests for a week
in his dwelling, without issuing orders of any kind. During this
space of time no affair is brought before his tribunal. The Sultan
Abd-er-Rahman was the first who derogated from this custom.

The Forian Sultans are surrounded by a kind of Aulic body,
composed of old women, called Habbobah, under the orders of one of
their numbers, called the queen. When the Sultan leaves his privacy
of seven days these old women unite, bearing iron switches, about
two feet long, which they clash one against another, producing a
singular sound. One of them bears a kind of broom of date-branches,
which she dips into a prepared liquid, and therewith, from time to
time, sprinkles the Sultan, uttering certain mysterious words. Then
they conduct the new prince from his private dwelling to the House
of Brass, where the tymbals of the
[77]
Sultan are kept. Having entered, they take
the Victorious tymbal and place it in the midst. The Sultan remains
alone with the Habbobah, who continue to clash their twigs of iron,
and to repeat their mysterious exclamations. After this ceremony
they lead the prince to the place where is the imperial throne.

The movement of public affairs now begins, and the sovereign
opens his Divan. He never addresses the ordinary words of
salutation to any one, however great, except through the medium of
an interpreter. Those who obtain audience place themselves on their
knees, and an interpreter repeats their names, adding a form of
word to this effect: âSuch a one salutes you humbly.â Having gone
through the whole, he adds, âand their people or their children are
behind them.â Then the negroes, who are standing in the rear of the
prince, begin to cry out âSalutation! salutation!â If the assembly
is great, a large wooden urn, shaped like an inverted cone, and
covered with a skin, called a dingar, is beaten. It gives a great
sound, and is not used on any other occasion. On grand occasions,
there are seven interpreters ready to explain the petitions of
persons who come to ask for justice. The forms of salutation are
very intricate.

The people of Darfur have many singular ways of expressing
veneration for the majesty of the Sultan. Among others, whenever he
clears his throat, his spittle is immediately gathered up
from
[78]
the ground by
his servants with their hands.
[14]
When he coughs, as if
about to speak, everybody makes the sound of
ts
,

ts
as nurses do to amuse their little ones; and, when he
sneezes, the whole assembly imitates the cry of the jeko, which
resembles that of a man urging on his horse to speed. In grand
council, the Sultan is fanned with a large bunch of
ostrich-feathers. When he goes out to hunt he is shaded by a
parasol of the same material; and these insignia are under the
special care of a high official. If the Sultan, being on horseback,
happens to fall off, all his followers must fall off likewise; and
should any one omit this formality, however great he may be, he is
laid down and beaten.
[15]

A strange ceremony is sometimes celebrated by the Forian
princes. It is called the Clothing of the Buaso, and consists in
renewing the skins of the great tymbals, called in Egypt Nakarieh.
The ceremony is one of the greatest solemnity, and every year lasts
seven days. In the first place, all the tymbals must be stripped on
one dayâwhich done,
[79]

bulls, with dark grey skins, are slaughtered to supply the new
coverings. It is pretended that these bulls are of a particular
species, and that, when they are about to be slaughtered, they lie
down quietly, and submit without resistance. They are killed
without the ordinary preamble of âBâism Illah;â and it is said that
they are thus held down and kept tranquil by genii. When they are
slaughtered the flesh is separated from the bones and skin, and put
into large jars of salt for six days, at the end of which other
animals are slaughtered, and the flesh mixed. Tables are then laid
out, and all the sons of the Sultan, and all the Kings, and all the
Viziers, are invited, and compelled to eat. There are inspectors at
each table to see that nobody fails; for if any one does so, it is
believed that he is a traitor. No conspirator, in fact, can eat of
this food. If any one keeps away, under pretence of illness, a
plate of meat is brought to him, and if he declines to eat, he is
seized. Many pretend that for this festival a young boy and a young
girl, not yet arrived at the age of puberty, are slaughtered, cut
up, and mixed with the salt meat; and it is added that the boy must
be called Mohammed, and the girl Fatmeh. If this be true, these men
must be infidels and barbarians. For my part, I have seen nothing
of this ceremony, foreigners never being allowed to be present.

Before the meat is served up, a general review of all the troops
takes place at the Fasher, and, afterwards,
[80]
the Sultan repairs in state, first to his
palace, and then to the House of Brass. Arrived there, he takes a
drumstick, and strikes three blows on the Victorious Nakarieh. The
corps of old women is there still, beating their twigs of iron. If
any Governor or Vizier happens to be away at the time of this
ceremony, instead of the trial by meat-eating, he is subjected to
the trial by Killi,âthat is to say, he is compelled to drink water
in which the fruit of that name has been infused. If he be not a
conspirator, he immediately vomits; but, if he be guilty, he can
drink a large jar-full without doing so. I have seen the experiment
tried on a person accused of theft. It is possible that these
effects may depend on some particular properties of the Killi, for
in Darfur there are many plants of singular virtue, of which we
shall speak, if it please God.

There is a remarkable custom, called the Festival of the Sowing,
in Darfur. The Sultan possesses, as his domain, cultivable land,
which is sown every year. After the rains, he goes forth in great
pomp, escorted by more than a hundred young women, chosen amidst
the most beautiful, and adorned with their richest garments and
jewels. These women are the best-beloved of his harem. They wear
upon their heads vases filled with the most delicate viands, and
they walk behind the Sultanâs horse with the young slaves, called
korkoa, armed with lances, and with a troop of flute-players. They
move on with music and singing, and even the young girls join in
the concert.
[81]
When the
prince has reached the open country, he gets out of the saddle, and
taking different kinds of grain whilst a slave turns up the ground
with a hoe, casts them in. This is the first seed that falls in the
country where the Sultan then is. Afterwards the kings, viziers,
the officers of the court, following the example of the Sultan,
also cast in grain, and the whole plain is soon quickened for the
harvest. This done, the dishes are brought by the young girls, and
spread out before the Sultan, who begins to eat with his courtiers.
Then the whole party get into the saddle again, and return in a
grand cavalcade to the Fasher. This Festival of the Sowing is one
of the most solemn in Darfur.
[16]

The court of Tendelty is organised in a very complete and
singular manner. The different dignitaries are named after
different parts of the Sultanâs body. The Orondolon, for example,
means the head of the Sultan, and his duty is to march in the van
of the troops; the Kamneh, or neck of the Sultan, is still higher
in rank, but his privileges are counterbalanced by one
extraordinary duty, viz. that of allowing himself to be strangled
if the king happens to be killed in battle. After these
functionaries come the backbone, and the right arm, and the left
arm, each with different duties. The Ab-Sheikh, or Father-Sheikh,
is above all the before-mentioned dignitaries in rank. He is almost
the equal of the Sultan, and possesses
[82]
the right of life and death without control.
There are numerous other officials, each with distinct duties. One
of the principal is the King of the Door of the Women, or Chief of
the Eunuchs. There is also the King of the Slaves, of the
Custom-House, and of the Tax-gatherers. None of these officers
receive any direct payment, but all have extensive districts
assigned to them, from the revenues of which they are expected to
supply arms, clothing, and horses for themselves and their
soldiers.

The tithe of grain and of cattle belongs exclusively to the
Sultan; but each of the governors has private property, which is
cultivated by forced labour. They have also the right to impound
and appropriate all wandering property, as slaves, oxen, sheep, and
asses. All fines also go to them. For example, if one man wounds
another, he pays so much for the blood spilt, all of which goes to
the governor, whilst, if death ensues, only one-half does, the
remainder going to the parents of the deceased. If a man intrigues
with a married woman, both the guilty parties are compelled to pay
a fine. It must also be remembered that all kinds of labour are
taken by force, and used gratuitously.

I must not forget to speak of the Kingship of the Maugueh, or
Buffoon of the Sultan. This is the least respectable office in the
court, but it is sufficiently interesting to describe. The Forians
have a natural tendency to pleasure, to gaiety, to games, and
festivals. They pass no day without some entertainment;
[83]
kings and people share the same
passion; and they have invented every possible means of enjoyment,
and all kinds of instruments. Every king has a train of young boys,
chosen for the beauty of their voice, and called Korkoa. They are
supplied with pipes made of reeds, through which they not only
blow, but sing, mixing up the notes and the words in a singular
manner. They are accompanied by a remarkable instrument, consisting
of a dried gourd, in which some pebbles have been introduced, and
which are shaken in time to the notes and pauses of the flutes.
Often the Sultan, on ceremonial occasions, causes this band to be
followed by his harem, bearing dishes; and on these occasions, a
drum resembling the araboukka of Egypt, is added to the concert.
There are masters in Darfur who teach both music and singing. The
singers precede the Sultan in groups, one individual of which
begins a stanza, while the others sing the chorus. On these
occasions, when the whole crowd of horse and footmen are beating
tambourines, or playing on flutes or pipes, or singing, the noise
created is perfectly stunning. The flutes are called the Birds of
the South, because in Southern Darfur are found many birds with
agreeable notes, from which it is said the Forians have learned
their style of playing.

To the above musical entertainment are added the songs of the
Maugueh, who form a considerable corporation, having a special
king. They have not
[84]

only to perform the droll duties of buffoons, but many others, and
especially the horrible one of executioner. Commonly the Maugueh
wear a kind of band round their heads, with a plate of iron on
their foreheads, in which is loosely fastened a long horn or nail,
which shakes and tinkles as they move. This is shaded by one or two
ostrich-feathers. They wear iron anklets, and each carries a
leathern bag in which to place these ornaments, as well as their
tartour, or tall, conical cap, covered with shells and beads, when
they have finished their sittings. In their hands they carry a
crook, to which are suspended little bells.

Two or three of these buffoons generally stand up before the
Sultan when he holds a divan; and when he travels or hunts several
go before him, singing, dancing, mimicking the bark of a dog or the
mewing of a cat, and uttering various absurdities to create a
laugh. Their songs are in the Forian language, never in Arabic.
Their dance does not consist of contortions of the hips, like that
of Egypt, but they shake the head from one side to the other, and,
striking their legs together, make their anklets jingle. When the
Sultan is very far from the Fasher they cease to sing, but all
together, at the top of their voices, cry, âYa! ya!â as long as the
prince is on horseback.

Every governor has buffoons of his own. These odd beings care
little for the anger of their master. They have a right of
familiarity, even with the Sultan.
[85]
They conceal nothing that they learn against
the private character of the courtiers, but bawl out their
scandalous stories in full divan. They have stentorian voices, and
are also used as criers. They may often be heard after sunset
screaming out in the streets.

The Sultan Abd-er-Rahman loved the Ulemas, and was frequently
with them night and day. He never appeared in council without
having one or two with him. This difference excited the jealousy of
the Viziers. âWhat,â said they, âdoes the Sultan prefer these
fellows to us? Verily, after him we will take care not to put upon
the throne a Sultan who can read and write.â A Maugueh heard these
words, and, dissimulating, waited for a day of public assembly. The
Viziers were present, and the buffoon began to say, âCertainly, we
will take care not again to elect a Sultan who can read and
write.â

The Sultan turned round and inquired, âWherefore?â

âBecause thou preferrest the company of the Ulemas to that of
the Viziers.â

Irritated at this observation, the Sultan glanced furiously at
him, so that he feared for his skin, and added,ââI am not to blame,
for I overheard these people,â pointing to the Viziers, âsay these
words.â

This created a scene of reproach and anger, and suggested to me
this observation,ââThe ignorant are always enemies of the
learned.â

Sultan Tyrab one day gave a great festival. The
[86]
Sultan began examining the
dishes one after another, in order to see which were the best. Some
of them had been prepared by the hands of the Yakoury Kinaneh
herself. Tyrab tasted them, and, finding them excellent, ordered
them to be reserved for the Ulemas. Kinaneh objected,
saying,ââShall I be Yakoury to cook for Sheikhs, whilst others cook
for Viziers and Kings?â The King replied, that she would thereby
gain the blessings of these holy men. But an altercation ensued;
she swore by her head that the Ulemas should not taste them, and
female perseverance prevailed.

I must add that the buffoons are generally chosen amongst the
poorest kind of people. They go begging from door to door, always
with success, for the great people fear them as spies. Whoever
treats them well acquires their praises; but those who seem to
check them are sure to be despised and scandalised. In this they
resemble poets, who have incense for their friends and sarcasms for
their enemies. The Yakoury is the mother of the Sultan. I have seen
the mother of Sultan Mohammed Fadhl. She was an ugly slave, who
would not have fetched ten dollars. I have also seen his
grandmother, a hideous old woman, more hideous than any other in
the whole country, and nearly imbecile. It was her pleasure,
whenever she travelled, to be carried on a kind of stool on the
shoulders of men, and surrounded by a numerous escort of soldiers.
One day
[87]
she was told
that the people said, speaking of her, âThis slave tyrannises over
and torments us.â She caused herself to be carried to the divan,
and cried, âThe slave! The slave has brought forth silver, and
silver has brought forth gold!â alluding to her relationship to the
Sultan.

Horseback â Tendelty â Fountains â Huts â The Palace â Police

a Wife â Betrothal.

The
dwelling of the Sultan
is in the interior of the Fasher; that is to say, the town or
borough which is chosen for his ordinary residence, and the houses
or huts of the inhabitants around. This dwelling-place has two
external gates, one called the gate of the men, and the other the
gate of the women. The first leads to the great divan, which is a
shed built of wood, open on all sides. Large beams support the
roof, which is made of fascines. The ceiling is now sufficiently
high to allow a man upon a camel to ride through. Formerly, only a
man on horseback could pass. It happened, one day, that two Arabs
presented themselves, and quarrelled about their skill in
camel-riding. It was agreed that they should have a race within the
Ligdabeh, or divan. The Sultan and his courtiers went out and
collected around to see this singular contest. The two champions
started
[89]
off from a
distance at full gallop. On arriving near the Ligdabeh, one of them
leaped upon the roof, and, running along, dropped into his seat
again just as the camel came out at the other side. The other threw
himself under, and held on until he was also outside, when he swung
up again into his seat. There was a great discussion as to who had
gained the bet; but the Sultan decided in favour of the second. It
was after this incident that the roof was raised to its present
height. When there is a public meeting, the Sultan sits on an
elevated seat, placed on a platform in the midst, with the Ulemas
on the right, and Shereefs and great people on the left. When a
solemn divan is held for the reception of ambassadors, or for a
public festival, the platform is decorated with trappings
embroidered with gold, and a stool of ebony, with a cushion of
silk, is placed in the midst for the Sultan, who assumes an
imposing and majestic air. All the great dignitaries and the seven
interpreters have their appointed place. On some occasions, the
Sultan gives audience on horseback, and has horses trained to
remain for hours in the same posture.

Tendelty is now the capital of Darfur, and has been so ever
since 1206, or 1791 of the Christians. It is built on a plain of
sand, and traversed by a torrent, which joins the great stream of
the valley of Kou. The rains of autumn fill it, so that it can only
be crossed at a great distance from the city. Towards the end of
winter, the greater part of the water dries
[90]
away, and wells are dug in the sand. The
Sultan uses this water; but, as he fears that some ill-intentioned
persons may cast a charm into the well, he sometimes, without
warning, sends to the well of Gedeed el Seil, which is distant
about a parasang to the east.

The dwellings of the Forians are generally huts constructed of
millet-stalks, and are surrounded with a hedge of prickly bushes,
at some distance, and by a second enclosure of millet-stalks.
Wealthy persons possess many huts within the same enclosure. The
wealth of a man is known by the whiteness and cleanness of his
huts, and the inner enclosure. There are pens within the hedge for
the flocks.

The huts are round, and resemble tents in appearance. They are
of different classes and names. Some of them are surmounted by a
stick, on which are three or four ostrich eggs, separated by balls
of red clay. In addition to these, the huts of the Sultan are
ornamented with horizontal bands of red and white stuff. Those of
the women of the Sultan, and, indeed, of many wealthy people, have
the external wall of mud, and the roof of a rare kind of reed, the
possession of which is considered a sign of wealth.

The imperial enclosure is situated on a slight elevation, a
little to the north of the torrent, and covers an extent of three
hundred paces. The hedge is very thick, and is formed of three rows
of prickly shrubs, with the spaces filled up by trunks of trees.
The whole forms a regular palisade, surpassing the
[91]
height of a man, and is
carefully kept in order. The gates, which are well guarded, are
made of long poles tied together, and are fastened with an iron
chain and padlocks. A great number of dwellings and offices are
included within the enclosure. The women occupy a considerable
space, and there are several sheds where slaves are engaged all day
in grinding millet and wheat between two stones.

All the inhabitants of Tendelty are compelled to remain,
invariably, in the quarter of the city where they are first
established, from father to son. All people employed, also, are
forbidden to change their place. This rigid rule is ever preserved
upon warlike expeditions. Every one is compelled to encamp exactly
in the same relation to the Sultanâs tent, so that, in fact, at
every halt, a miniature representation of the city is created. In
this way, if the Sultan is in want of anybody, it is always
possible to find him immediately.

The garments worn in Darfur are all light, but of various forms
and colours. Rich people have black or white dresses of very fine
tissue. The Sultan and other great people wear two long shirts of
fine stuff, imported from Egypt, or made in Darfur. The white
garments are very brilliant, and all clothing is kept perfectly
clean. The Sultan wears a Cashmere turban on his head, which no one
else is allowed to do. Moreover, he wraps up his face with a piece
of white muslin, which goes round his head several times, covering
his mouth
[92]
and nose
first, and then his forehead, so that only his eyes can be
seen.
[17]
The Orondolon and the Kanineh, and the male
children of the royal family, also cover their face, except when
they are in the palace. The Sultan is also distinguished by a
gilded scimetar, by his sacred amulet box, by his parasol and fans
of feathers, by his gilded saddle and stirrups, and by the peculiar
trappings of his horse.

The stuff with which the rich clothe themselves commonly are
muslin and English calico: silk dresses are only used on great
occasions. The Forians, who are well off, wear a kind of mantle, in
several different ways. Some curious stuffs are imported from the
West: among others, the Gadany, which is black, with a shade of
red. The dye used is indigo. People who can afford it wear drawers,
and upon their heads the tarboosh, or red cap. The poor go
bare-headed, and cover their bodies with a single garment.

The women wear a piece of stuff tied round the waist, and the
young girls hide their bosoms with a kind of kerchief made of silk,
of calico, or of coarse stuff, according to their means. All the
girls wear round their middle a thick band and kind of kilt. When a
girl is married, she wears a great
[93]
izar, which covers her from head to foot.
Most women have a ring in their nose, sometimes of gold, but often
of silver or copper. It sometimes bears a few beads of red coral.
Many wear great ear-rings of silver, six ounces in weight,
supported, in part, by a string, which passes over the head. The
poor thrust a little piece of red coral or a long bead through the
hole in their nostril, and pieces of stick through their ears. They
wear various kinds of necklaces, made of beads, of amber, of coral,
of agate, and of glass. These, indeed, form their principal
ornaments; but they are also fond of wearing little talismanic
chaplets about their heads, made of berries, of beans, or of
shells. The Forian women also cover their bodies with various
strings of beads, load their arms with bracelets made of iron, of
horn, or of copper, and the ankles with anklets. They use different
kinds of perfumes: among others, the sun-bul, or
Spica
Celtica
, sandal-wood, and myrtle. Great people carry
musk-bags.

The Forian women make a kind of kahl with native antimony, but
they do not put it inside the eye as in Egypt, but use it
externally. They also colour therewith the eyelids of their lovers
or their affianced, and for this reason many boys are seen thus
adorned. It is the custom for a lover to receive some object of
dress from his mistress, which he wears with pride, and never
separates from. If any misfortune happen to him, he exclaims, by
way of consolation,ââNo matter, I am the brother (that
[94]
is, the lover) of such a one.â
Under similar circumstances his mistress consoles herself by
similar words.

Jealousy is rare among the Forians. If a man find any one with
his daughter or his sister, he rather rejoices than otherwise,
foreseeing a marriage. When the form of a young Forian girl begins
to develope, she is placed in a hut apart, where she sleeps alone,
and he who loves her comes to see her when he pleases, and passes
the time with her. Many unmarried girls bring forth children; and
this is not considered shameful, even if an incest has taken place.
The offspring, in these cases, is put down to the account of a
maternal uncle; and, if it be a girl, the uncle profits by the
dowry which the husband receives. It is impossible to prevent this
intercourse of men and women. A father sometimes, if he be poor, is
mobbed, or even killed, if he endeavours to preserve his daughterâs
chastity; and even rich people find it difficult to succeed in
this. Whatever be the care taken, some lover will find his way in,
disguised as a woman.

A distinguished man of Darfur once had seven sons and a daughter
of perfect beauty. Many suitors presented themselves for the
latter, but were refused. Time passed, and the young girl had
recourse to stratagem, and introduced into her hut a handsome youth
full of courage and resolution. They remained together as long as
it pleased God. His parents, disquieted by his absence, sought
for
[95]
him everywhere,
but found him not. However, one day, having drunk deeply with his
mistress, he became excited, and wished to go forth. âWait until
the night,â said she. But he refused, and went out. It happened,
however, that the father and his seven sons were sitting at the
gateway of the enclosure, and perceived him as he approached. The
father cried out to the gatekeeper to shut the gate, and to seize
on the intruder. He was assailed and surrounded, but defended
himself so vigorously that many were wounded. The seven brothers
now ran towards him armed, in order to kill him. He begged them to
stand aside; but they would not, and fell upon him. They fought for
some time, but he killed six, one after the other, and wounded the
seventh. Then the father cried out, âOpen the gate!â and it was
opened, and he escaped without a single wound. No one ever knew who
he was. The young girl was thus the cause of the death of her
brothers and the desolation of her family. Similar adventures
happen often, and the women always refuse to betray their lovers.
Great ugliness, or ill-health, can alone preserve a daughter to her
family.

Sultan Abd-er-Rahman endeavoured to repress these abuses, but
without success. He established a police of eunuchs to prevent
conversations between men and women in the market-place, but they
were deceived in a thousand ways. If a man, for
example,
[96]
wanted to
point out to a young girl, whom he found to his taste, where she
might meet him, he would cry out,â

âOh, ho! my lass, whatâs this? Thy ugly head is like the ugly
top of that ugly hut.â

âWhat ugly hut?â would the cunning girl say, in a tone of sham
anger. âWhere is that ugly hut which is like my head?â

âThere.â

So he pointed it out, and in the evening she was sure to come
and meet him.

Abd-er-Rahman endeavoured, also, to put a stop to wine-drinking,
but with equal want of success. He even went so far as to smell the
mouths of his courtiers when they came to see him; but they soon
found out that, by chewing the leaves of a certain plant, named
shalaub, they could entirely take away the odour. The Forians are
naturally drunkards, and religion has no power to keep them
sober.

When a poor man is about to marry, and nobody of his family will
give him enough to supply his bridal expenses, he goes out to the
fields, where the herds and flocks of his relations are feeding,
and slaughters as many as he wants. If the owner endeavours to
repel him, he is sure to be beaten, and, perhaps, killed; but,
generally, he cites the man before the Khadi, who condemns him to
pay for what he has taken by instalments.

On the occasion of a circumcision, the very
[97]
young boys of a village are sent out into
the neighbouring districts to kill all the fowls they can come
near. No one attempts to interfere with them, for the law does not
allow punishments to be applied at so early an age. A similar
custom to the one here alluded to is practised in the case of young
girls; and a very extraordinary method is taken among the poor to
forestall the dangers of familiarity. During all these painful
ceremonies, the girls are expected to suffer without complaint.

Very considerable dowries are given at a marriage, or rather a
high price is paid for a wife. If the girl be pretty, her parents,
even though poor, sometimes require twenty cows, and a male and
female slave; but the father and mother keep all this for
themselves. For this reason the Forians prefer daughters to sons.
Daughters fill the stables, say they, but sons empty them.

Once married, a girl remains for one or two years in her
fatherâs house, along with her husband, who at last has great
difficulty in taking her away. During this time all domestic
expenses are defrayed by the wifeâs father; and whatever the
husband brings is considered as a present. When a youth has been
betrothed to a girl, however intimate he may have been with her
parents before, he ceases to see them until the ceremony has taken
place, and even avoids them in the street. They, on their part,
hide their faces, if they happen to meet him
[98]
unexpectedly. He goes to see his betrothed
in her own hut, and sends his compliments to her parents. After the
ceremony he goes and kisses his father-in-law and his mother-in-law
on the head, and becomes one of the family. From this time forward
both wife and husband consider that they have two fathers and two
mothers.

But
I must enter into
further details on this subject of marriage. When Adam woke from
the light sleep during which Eve was taken out of his side, and
beheld this new creature, richly adorned with grace and beauty, his
heart was moved, and he admired.

âWho art thou, dear creature?â said he.

âI am Eve. God has just created me for thee, according to the
dictates of his supreme will.â

âCome, then, to me.â

âNo! It is thou who shouldst come to me.â

Then Adam advanced towards her, and this was the origin of the
custom, that the man should seek the woman. When he had sat down by
her side, and touched her with his hands, emotion thrilled through
his frame, and he became bewildered; but Eve said: âStay, Adam: Eve
is only legitimately given to thee as a wife, on condition of a
dowry, and
[100]
a common
consent expressed.â Then God, in His Old Language, pronounced a
formula of marriage, and said:ââThere is nothing sublime but my
grandeur; nothing imposing but my majesty; and all creatures revere
and adore me. I take you to witnessâyou, my angels, and you, the
inhabitants of my heavenâthat I unite in marriage this marvel of my
creation, Eve, to this first man, my image upon the earth; but on
condition of a dowryâand this dowry shall be, that he pronounce
these words: âGod is great; there is no god but God.ââ Thus were
established and consecrated the form and conditions of marriage for
the posterity of Adam.

Every nation, however, has since modified the original custom,
and the Forians also have their special forms. Among them the
childrenâboys and girlsâare generally mixed together. From a very
early age they are employed in watching the herds, and are thus in
constant communication. Many of them begin their intimacy at that
time, and become linked in an affection which time cannot break.
Love follows, and then the cares of love and jealousy; and at last
the lover, egotistical in his passions, wishes to keep all the men
away from his mistress. So he demands her in marriage, and the
contract of union is drawn up in presence of witnesses, and the
price of the bride, or the dowry, as it is called, is discussed.
For some time afterwards the ceremony is deferred; but at length
the day is fixed, and preparations are made for the
[101]
nuptial feast. Animals are
slaughtered, drinks are prepared, and invitations are sent out.

Many music-women are hired to enliven the festival. Each of them
carries under her left arm three tambourines, on which she plays,
greeting every new troop of guests with a song in their praise. For
example,ââYou, who brandish the shafts of your spears, may death be
slow to overtake you!âMay the eye which looks enviously on you
become blind!âyou, who brandish the steel of your lances,â
&c.

I was once at a marriage festival where the women greeted me
with these verses,ââThe Shereef comes from the mosque with a book
in one hand, and a sabre in the other; he bears away the Birguids
into slavery!â

Those who give the festival meet the guests as they arrive, and
sit them down in groups. Food is immediately brought them according
to their dignity. Some, for example, are given boiled meats and
roast meats; others, cakes, and the red wine called BulbulâThe
Mother of the Nightingale. When all have eaten, they remain sitting
in the shade until the heat of the day has diminished, and the
shadows are beginning to lengthen. Then the young girls, in their
richest costume, leave the company of the women; and the youth
also, dressed out in their best, run to meet them, and they prepare
to dance. The girls range themselves in long lines, in front of
which lines of equal length
[102]
are formed by the youths; and the women, to
the measured sound of the tambourines, fill the air with their
songs. At this signal, all the lines of young girls begin to move
and to advance with a slow, deliberate step, shrugging their
shoulders in various ways, and crouching down with strange
contortions and inflections of their bodies. Thus they reach by
degrees the line of youths, which remains motionless opposite,
until each comes face to face with her partner, when she begins to
shake her head rapidly, and fan and brush his cheeks with her
tresses, which have been carefully perfumed beforehand. Then the
youths, excited by these blandishments, brandish their lances, and
raise them horizontally over the heads of the girls, who begin to
retire, still dancing, and are pursued by their partners until they
reach the place whence they started. Here the young girls pass
between the young men and go dancing back alone. If there happens
to be among the spectators any young man whom a young girl wishes
to lure into the dance, she singles him out, and goes gently
dancing towards him, and waves her hair in his face. Upon this he
shouts with joy, and brandishes his lance and follows her. This
attention on her part imposes on him the necessity of giving her a
banquet.

When the two lines have thus changed places, they begin to move
at the same time, and meet in the middle, where the girls cast the
whole of their hair upon the breast of their partners, who begin to

rakrak
, that is to say, to utter peculiar cries of
joy.
[103]
The whole
company is now half-intoxicated, but the dance continues until
night-time, when the various groups separate and go to supper.

Besides this dance, which is called Delloukah, the Forians have
the Gyl, the Lengui, the Chekenderi, the Bendalah, and the Tonzy,
which is the dance of the slaves; but the dance peculiarly of
Forian origin, and which is special chiefly to the inhabitants of
the Marrah mountains, is the Tendina. Some of these dances are
peculiar to certain classes. The higher ranks dance the Delloukah;
the middle classes, the Gyl; and the inferior classes, the Lengui.
In the latter, the dancers utter peculiar cries, or rather grunts,
which resemble those emitted by workmen when chopping wood. In the
Chekenderi, a young man takes the waist of a young girl, who stands
before him with her back turned, in his hands. A young girl behind
him places her hands upon his hips; she is followed by a young man,
and thus a circle is formed. The dancers, leaning slightly forward,
move with very little steps; the girls gently shaking their anklets
in measure. This tranquil dance is accompanied by the songs of
women who are sitting by. The Bendalah is a dance, or rather a
game, peculiar to the slaves, in which they tie a string of large
nuts to their right foot, and kick at each other. The Tonzy
resembles the Chekenderi; and the Tendina is an exaggerated form of
the latter.

Each kind of dance is accompanied by special songs. For example,
in the Gyl, the following is
[104]
used:ââYou banei, hei you banein! The night
is passing, oh, my Moutgal; my head is turning; the night is going,
oh, my Moutgal! yes, my head is turning!â The introductory words
have no meaning, and form an arbitrary chorus. One of the singers
sings the first and second lines, and then the others join in with,
âAna rasy indur,ââmy head is turning. They go on to say: âThe night
is passing. Darfur (that is, the world, for the world to them is a
great Darfur) is full of sorrows. Come and rest thy head upon my
bosom.â The complete meaning of another song is as follows:ââOh
thou, whom I love, thou bendest over me like a flexible branch, and
passion draws us away and makes us breathe forth sighs! Thou lovest
me, thou preferrest me to the daughters of thy hamlet, and thereby
thou shalt excite their jealousy against me, and draw their
vengeance upon me, for they will believe that thou hast humbled
them in my eyes! Oh thou, whose love recalls the perfume of the
sandal-wood, thou hast arisen like the odoriferous branches of that
tree, and thou leanest over our dwellings, to shade them for ever;
and happiness will always remain beneath thy branches!â

After the evening repast, the bride is promenaded, to the sound
of the Daloukah, all round the village, and then led to the nuptial
hut. Three or four hours after night-fall, the young men collect
together and take with them the bridegroom, and, with songs and
rakrakhas, conduct him to the
[105]
hut. They remain without, whilst the bride
with her companions remains within. Then the bridegroom nominates
one of his friends as Vizier of the wedding, of which he himself is
the Sultan; whilst the bride within chooses a she-vizier, under the
title of Meirem. The latter is then entreated by the young men to
come out and speak to them, but she refuses for an hour or two, and
then issues forth, when the Vizier approaches her and presents his
compliments, and, in an amiable and polite manner, begs her to
allow the bride to present herself.

âWho are you?â then says the Meirem, âWhence do you come, and of
what bride do you speak?â

âWe are strangers,â answers the Vizier; âwe arrive from a
distant country, and will be delighted if the Queen would honour us
and cheer us with her presence.â

âThe Queen is engaged,â then says the Meirem, âand cannot
appear; she has begged me to entertain all strangers and travellers
who may present themselves. What are your wishes?â

âWe all know,â says the Vizier, âthat thou art full of
graciousness and bounty, that thou art a perfect woman; but we have
a word or two to say to the Queen, and can say them to no other
than her.â

âVery good,â responds the Meirem; âbut what will you give to the
Queen, and what will
[106]
you give to me, if she presents herself?
For it is her custom to show herself only to those who give her a
present.â

âAll that we possess, and even our life, we will give, if she
desires.â

This dialogue continues for some time, whilst the bride,
concealed behind a curtain, is listening, and the bridegroom also
remains silent. At length the Meirem consents to exhibit the Queen,
and raises the curtain, and she steps forth, upon which the Vizier
exclaims,âThe Queen is for the King, but for us what remains?â Then
the Meirem calls forth the companions of the bride, and says,â âMy
friends, I beg that you will treat these guests of our Queen, this
night, in a proper manner.â âWillingly,â they reply. Upon which the
Meirem, who knows who is engaged to whom, leads them forth one by
one and presents them to their lovers. Several couples, thus
brought together, pass the night conversing in the nuptial hut, and
the others go and sleep in the house of some friend.

Next day, the bride and her bridemaids take a bath and perfume
themselves, and the whole wedding party prepares for a new
festival; and sometimes the rejoicings last for seven days, in the
evenings of which there are always dancing and other amusements. If
provisions fail, the men of the party spread through the
neighbourhood, and kill what they want in the first flocks and
herds they find. For this reason all the farmers, as
soon
[107]
as they hear
that a wedding is to take place, drive away their beasts to a
distance.

It must be observed that the marriage is seldom considered as
completely celebrated until the seventh day, and never until after
the third. A husband always shuns the insulting epithet of the
impatient man. Each day of temperance is dedicated to some
particular person: the first to the father of the bride, the second
to the mother, and so on.

It is a strange custom in Darfur, that the wife, under no
pretence whatever, is allowed to eat in the presence of her
husband, or of any other man. If her husband happen to enter whilst
she is eating, she instantly runs away, under penalty of universal
contempt. I once enumerated to some Forians the various liberties
that a husband can take with his wife, and asked why she should not
also eat before him. âWhat you mention,â said they, âare very
rational and proper acts, but for a woman to eat in the presence of
a husband, to open her mouth and introduce food thereinâah, nothing
can be more shameful!â

As I have said, the wife remains in her fatherâs house until she
has borne children; and if her husband propose to take her away,
she may ground a demand of divorce thereon. In the early time of
her marriage the wife never speaks of her husband by his name, but
only as
he
; and if she be asked whom she means, she
replies,
him
. When
[108]
she has had a child she uses the
expression,âThe father of such a one. The husband has no family
expenses until after a year of marriage, and at every repast all
the best food is first offered to him. During the night also, as
long as he sleeps in the house of his wifeâs family, they bring
him, in the course of the night, two or three supplemental meals;
the first of which is called the undress meal; the second, the
Tarna-jisi; and the third, the meal of dawn. These meals are served
up to the husband by the bride herself.

At the festival of the circumcision there are also great
rejoicings. The operation is performed by a barber, and if the
patient support it courageously the father promises him a heifer, a
bull, or a slave, and all those who are present make him some gift.
It is on this occasion that the boys scour the country in search of
fowls.

I shall now describe what is called a Zikr in Darfur, remarking,
by the way, that, in common Forian life, the women are the life and
soul of every thing that takes place, and that, therefore, they
also take a direct part in this religious ceremony. The Darfur Zikr
is of two kinds, one performed by the Arabs, and the other by the
Forians. The former contains a variety of movements and change, and
was instituted by a celebrated Sheikh. A woman places herself near
the circle of the faithful, and sings a few verses, whilst the
other women
[109]
simply
look on, and examine who is most distinguished by his
enthusiasm.
[18]
When the Zikr is in full swing, the woman
becomes silent, and one of the men takes up the song. On one
occasion, I heard a contest between two circles of Zikrs, in which
the performers sung satirical verses one against the other. At
another time, a woman ran into the circle, and began to chant:ââI
will pour out for you a jar of meriseh. I am without a husband, and
I live at the other end of the village. Is there one of you who is
ready for love?â The people of the Zikr were then chanting,ââAllah
hai! Allah hai!ââGod is living, God is living! but one of them
substituted the words âAna zany; ana zany!ââI am your man; and so
the contract was made.

The people of Forian origin stand in two rows or in a circle,
each one with a young girl behind him, and the women standing
around chant in a monotonous tone these words:ââThe green tree is
created for the shadow of men of science and religion. Is it indeed
true that we shall go to paradise? Yes, it is indeed true that we
shall go to paradise:â and they also add these words:ââOh Gabriel!
oh Michael! every deed of goodness is a key of paradise.â

Women in all countries have excited the jealousy of men. There
have been known those who have been jealous not only of their
nearest relations, but
[110]
of the night, of the day, of the eyes of
the Narcissus, even of themselves. The poets have accumulated these
exaggerations. One has said, âOh, Narcissus, turn away thy flower;
do not look at me, for I am ashamed to kiss her I love before thee!
What! shall my cheeks grow pale in sleep, and thou still gaze?â
Another has said:ââMy eyes, myself, thyself, the place where thou
livest, the hours that brush by thee, everything excites my
jealousy. Grant me nothing, for, as I am jealous of thee against
thyself, how should I not be jealous of myself?â And again,
another:ââI am jealous of everything, even of my own thoughts, and
one hand is jealous of the other.â

It is the passion thus described that has given rise to the
custom of employing eunuchs. The Sultan of Darfur has more than a
thousand of them, and all the great people possess several. All
these eunuchs come from Dar-roha, although from time to time one is
made in the country as a punishment.

The eunuchs are celebrated for their cruelty. One day an
Ab-Sheikh led out his soldiers on a hot summerâs day, and forced
them to remain in the sun whilst he was protected by a parasol,
until they all suffered dreadfully, and some even died upon the
spot. He did this for his amusement, and exclaimed from time to
time:ââThis is the day! this is the day!âthe day of misfortune and
desolation!â There were more than twenty thousand men present, but
none dared to resist, until at length a pious Sheikh,
[111]
named Hassan-el-Kau, suddenly
exclaimed, three times,ââSilence, impious man!â Upon this
Our-dikka, which was the name of the eunuch, was seized with
affright and fled, and the pious Hassan, lifting up his hands to
heaven, prayed, and said, âMy God, have pity on thy servants!â
Presently a vast mass of clouds collected over head, and the rain
fell in torrents, and the army was refreshed and dispersed. This
day is remembered as a memorable day.

That which had provoked the pious indignation of the Sheikh
Hassan was, that the eunuch had assimilated himself to God, by
judging the crowd in the words which will be used at the last day
of fiery resurrection. Our-dikka was a very ignorant man, and had
never attempted to learn to read until appointed to his high
dignity. The Sultan ordered him to take lessons, and he studied the
alphabet for a few days. At last he asked for a Koran, and after
having looked over it for some time, managed to make out the letter

waw
standing by itself.

âIs not that a
waw
?â said he.

âCertainly,â replied his master.

âNow I know the Koran,â exclaimed the eunuch, and he shut up the
book and ordered oxen and sheep to be slaughtered, and caused the
tambourines to beat, and gave a great festival on the occasion.

In spite of the number of eunuchs and their vigilance, the
Sultan is often deceived by his slaves, who send out old women into
the city to bring in beardless boys dressed in female garments.
This
[112]
stratagem is
the more easy, because it is the custom for all the young negroes
to wear their hair long like women. In this way access to the harem
is easy; and if God protect the youth he escapes afterwards, if
not, he is massacred without mercy. In general no accident happens;
but sometimes another woman betrays the secret, or else the Sultan
in a jealous mood makes a general search through his huts.

At other times the women themselves go out in disguise, and the
eunuchs often allow them to pass, pretending not to recognise them,
because they fear their vengeance. The fact is, the women of Soudan
are incapable of restraining their passions; and, indeed, it is not
to be wondered at, that the Sultan and the wealthy men, with their
large harems, should be often deceived, especially as there are a
great number of persons who, from want of means, are obliged to
lead a life of celibacy. I have already explained, too, how the
education of the Forian women prepares them for debauchery.

It is the belief among the Forians, that if the city takes fire,
the only means of arresting the progress of the flames is to bring
near them a woman, no longer young, who has never been guilty of
intrigue. If she be pure, by merely waving a mantle, she puts a
stop to the destruction. Success has sometimes rewarded a virtuous
woman. When I was in Darfur, a violent conflagration burst forth.
The Sultan and all his court came and endeavoured to stop it, but
in vain. Then a crier was sent about the city.
[113]
He passed through every street,
exclaiming, âIs there any faithful woman here? Is there a single
faithful woman to be found?â But no one came forward, and we must
believe that none existed.

I must, however, mention, that conjugal virtues are far from
being so uncommon amongst the women of the wandering Arabs in
Darfur and its neighbourhood. These women, being more intelligent,
are more religious and more faithful than the Forians. Among them
there is far more propriety. An Arab woman, for example, who has a
son in an honourable position, will abstain from any love intrigue
out of respect for his name; but the Forian women not so. An
intimate friend of mine, whose name I will not mention, has related
to me that the mother of the Sultan Mohammed Fadhl, who was called
Ambous,
[19]
once married her brother to a slave-girl of
hers. The wedding was celebrated with great pomp, and an enormous
crowd collected, of which my friend was one. âI was standing,â he
said, âlooking on, when the mother of the Sultan appeared,
surrounded by a troop of girls, elegant as gazelles. She was then
thirty-five years old, and her countenance was the most hideous
possible to conceive. I wondered why God had chosen so frightful a
woman to be the mother of a prince. Having led her brother to the
nuptial hut, she came forth jingling her anklets and her strings of
beads, and, in the dark, I felt a cloud
[114]
of perfume surrounding me. She came towards
me in the midst of her slaves, and, seizing my hand, led me away. I
dared not resist, for fear of attracting attention. After
proceeding a little way, she whispered that she was tiredâshe who,
before she had been the mother of a Sultan, had been a hewer of
wood and a drawer of water, complained of a walk of a hundred
yards! I answered politely, and she led me into the hut and made me
sit down, and, after some coquetry, seeing that I would not
understand, said that she had a headache, and wanted me to repeat
some verses of the Koran. I did so, placing my hand upon her
forehead, and the odour of her perfumes troubled me; but suddenly I
began to think of the danger, and trembled. So the queen, with whom
I had been left alone, called out for one of her women, named
Dera-el-Gader, who brought me a dish, which I tasted, and found so
good, that I ate heartily; but suddenly we heard a great noise, and
the servant came running, saying,ââThe Sultan! the Sultan!â Upon
this the women took me and shoved me out, and I was enabled to
hide, although some one did cry out that a man was stealing away.â
Such was the recital of my friend, which proved to me that eunuchs
are not sufficient to prevent women from having lovers if they wish
to do so.

I shall here add, that each tribe and nation of Soudan has women
celebrated for some qualities of beauty. The most beautiful women,
however, are those of Afnan; after them come the women
of
[115]
Bagirmeh, of
Bornou, and of Sennaar; then come those of WadaÃ¯; and after them
those of Darfur. The ugliest, without exception, are those of
Touban and Katakou. God has diversified his creatures in a
marvellous manner; and to produce the effect of variety, little is
required. Everything that is brown is not musk; everything that is
red is not a ruby; and everything that shines is not a diamond;
everything that is black is not charcoal; everything that is
vermilion is not flesh; and everything that is white is not chalk.
The coloured nations, whether they be black or bronzed, have
beauties which the white people do not possess. It may be said that
light and darkness immeasurably differ; but, verily, some admire
the black colour, as this verse proves:ââHer dark complexion is
full of charm and grace. Look at it well, and you will no longer
admire the white and the rose-coloured. Yes! on account of my
sweetheart, I love everything that is black. I love all Soudan on
her account; I love even black dogs.â I also, for a time, was a
passionate admirer of negresses, and I wrote some verses to justify
my taste, and endeavoured to prove that the whole beauty of a
countenance is derived from the black parts of itâas the eyes, the
eye-brows, and the moles. But afterwards I changed my opinion, and
wrote against the poet Safty, who had argued that a black spot on a
white face increased its beauty, whilst a white spot on a black
face was a deformity. I showed, among other things, that
the
[116]
truth is pure
and white. To this Safty replied, that white was the colour of old
menâs beards, and also of shroudsâtwo things which frighten love
away. Perhaps there has been much exaggeration put forth on both
sides.

When a Forian takes an Arab wife, or
vice versÃ¢
, it is
noticed that the offspring is generally weak and short-lived.
[20]

Each people has a particular temperament, and, I am inclined to
think that, as a rule, mixture of races deteriorates them. In
Darfur and WadaÃ¯ it has been found necessary to have recourse to
various means for preserving the lives of children. It is customary
to bleed them on the fortieth day after birth, by scarifying their
bellies on both sides. This operation is repeated at the age of
three months. If it be neglected, the children generally die of
fever and other diseases.

There
is a peculiar malady
in Darfur, called Abou-lessan, or father of the tongue, which
consists in the appearance of an excrescence at the root of the
tongue, which it is necessary to excise.
[21]

Dysentery is sometimes cured by cauterisation round the navel. When
convulsions are brought on by the malice of demons, who find a
child left alone for a moment, it is customary, in Egypt and Tunis,
for an exorciser to be called in to make invocations, and sometimes
the patient is relieved, and sometimes not. But, in Soudan, this
disease is treated by actual cautery on the forehead, and cures
often result. The small-pox is common in Soudan. As soon as a
person is attacked by it he is immediately removed to a
hut
[118]
built in a
lonely placeâa kind of hospital, in fact, where there are servants
who have already had the disease. The Bedawin Arabs are very
frightened at this disease. A man of Birguid, named Othman, once
related to me that, having had the disease, and having escaped
danger, though his skin was still marked, he used to go out with
his face covered with the cloth of his turban to protect him from
the flies. One day, being thus veiled, a party of Arabs approached,
and sent forward a man, who walked with a hesitating and uncertain
step. When he was near he cried out,â

âTell me, I pray thee, if in this village there be any one ill
of the small-pox?â

âGod preserve me,â replied Othman, âfrom exciting in thee a
dangerous security by a false answer!â So he uncovered his face,
and the Arab fell at once to the ground with a great cry.

His companions ran forward and carried him away, and Othman
fled, or otherwise they would have killed him. He afterwards
learned that the unhappy man died in three days. The people of
Soudan have a curious idea on the origin of the small-pox. They
pretend that it is brought by a little animal, imperceptible to the
eye, but which leaves evident traces of its passage on the ground.
This insect fixes on the skin, and thus engenders the disease. I am
told that its track consists of a series of round points, disposed
in a single straight line, so, . . . .; and they say that, whenever
this track is
[119]

observed in the morning directed towards any house, the small-pox
infallibly appears there.

Syphilis is very common in Darfur, but not so common as in
Kordofal, where people endeavour to communicate it, fancying that
they thus cure themselves; whilst in Darfur people generally shut
themselves up. Elephantiasis is common in these countries. Pleurisy
is cured by a number of scarifications on the side. There are a
variety of other diseases, many of which are fatal; but neither the
plague nor phthisis is known. I may add, that the greater number of
the therapeutic means used are surgical, and that they are often
successful. There are oculists, named shallans, who devote
themselves entirely to performing operations for the cataract, in
which they are very successful. The doctors are generally old men
who have studied carefully the effects of scarification and
cautery. The medicaments they use are marvellously simple,
consisting generally of tamarinds, honey, and cowâs butter. The
last-mentioned substance is used with wonderful success by the
Bedawin Arabs to cure gouty pains in the joints. It must be added,
that magic is often resorted to as a means of cure, and that the
patients are treated by writings; that is to say, papers on which
sacred words have been written. The most successful in this kind of
treatment are the Fellatahs.

Women in child-birth are attended on by a number of old women,
who are very expert in their art. A cord is swung from the roof of
the hut, and
[120]
the
woman remains upright, holding on until safely delivered. Eight
days after the birth of the child a feast is given, a sheep killed,
and the name bestowed. When the child is two or three months old,
it is carried about on its motherâs back, in her mantle, even
during her hardest work. She continues to carry it in this manner
even after it can walk, and, according to the general custom in
Muslim countries, she gives it suck for about two years. Unlike the
Egyptians, the Forians never marry their daughters until after the
age of puberty. The betrothment, however, often takes place two or
three years before.

Very little instruction is given to children in Darfur. The
reading of the Koran, which is the only primary education, even in
Egypt, is very imperfectly spread. One of the reasons is, that the
children only go to evening-schools, for all day they are occupied
in keeping the flocks and herds. When evening comes on they take
their slates and go to school. Every one of them in his turn brings
a fagot of wood to make a fire with, and the scholars sit round,
and by the light of the flame pursue their studies for an hour or
two. The result is general ignorance. The country produces scarcely
any Ulemas, and those who do exist give but mediocre lectures on
civil and religious law, and on the proofs of the existence and
unity of God. Rational studies, that is to say, those which have
for their object the sciences of human inventionâthe liberal arts,
the
[121]
humanities,
&c.âare nearly null; a few individuals only possessing a few
simple notions on the Arabic grammar. The study of the rules of
Arab phraseology, that of the delicacies and varieties of
discourse, of tropes, of rhetoric, of logic, and versification, is
entirely neglected, except by a few who have gone to study at
Cairo. Great importance is attached, however, to the science of
demons and magic. Medicine, among the Forians, is a branch of
magic, which is cultivated most especially by the Fullans, or
Fellatahs.

With reference to climate, Darfur is not equally salubrious
throughout its whole extent, and in all its provinces. The most
healthy part is the Gouz, or Country of Sand. The Arabs who inhabit
it, and breathe its pure air, are full of force and courage; but it
contains, unfortunately, little water. The most unhealthy country
for strangers is the SaÃ¯d; and, indeed, all the great capital towns
are remarkably unfavourable to health. In spite, however, of this
prevalence of disease, the people of Darfur love their country and
cherish their huts. However, it must be observed that, as there are
few epidemic diseases in Darfur, the population is tolerably well
kept up. Many men reach the age of a hundred, or even a hundred and
twenty; and very old people are common, despite of wars, and
domestic disturbances, and private quarrels. If it were not for
these causes, and the murders which are committed in a state of
drunkenness, or from jealousy, the population of Darfur
[122]
would equal in number the
Yagog and the Magog, and the vastest plains would not be able to
contain it. Some may object that the women, not being exposed to
the same chances of death, ought to exist in greater numbers; but I
believe that grief for the loss of their husbands, children, and
relations, and the various privations and fatigues they are subject
to, prevent their excessive increase. However, there are more old
women than old men, even among the very poor. I have remarked that,
in this latter class, the misery is so great, that the poor of our
country would never be able to support it.

Food that is bitter and disgusting to us seems to the Forians
exquisite eating. A little time after my arrival a dish called
weykeh was set before me, and I was invited to eat; but this was
impossible. My father, hearing of this, said to me,ââHe who will
not eat weykeh should not come into this country.â However, for
some time, he had prepared for me a few dishes that I liked, such
as rice and milk. When we went to the Fasher to visit the Sultan,
we were lodged by the Fakih Malik. At the first supper a bitter
mess was placed before me. I asked what it was, and was
answered,ââWeykeh, cooked with heglig.â I found it impossible to
touch it. Another dish was brought in, and with it came an
abominable stink. âWhat is that rotten stuff?â cried I. I was told
it was weykeh dandary, which was considered a great delicacy; but I
could not put a single morsel in my mouth, and so Malik was obliged
to send me
[123]
some
fresh milk sweetened with honey. In the evening he asked me why I
did not eat any of his dishes.

âThe first,â said I, âwas too bitter; and the second was too
stinking.â

âMy friend,â replied he, âthese kinds of dishes are necessary
for the preservation of health in our country, and whoever does not
eat them is in danger of disease.â

The dandary is prepared with the residue of bones of sheep and
oxen, which are thrown into a great vase full of water, and left
for several days, until they begin to smell strong.
[22]

Then they are pounded in a mortar, and reduced to a sort of paste,
of which balls are made as big as oranges. To prepare a weykeh, one
of these balls is dissolved in water, strained and mixed with
onions fried in butter, with pepper, salt, and other
condiments.

The common food of the poor is millet, not winnowed. Their
cookery is detestable; they use a salt extracted from wood-ashes.
People a little better off live, for the most part, on milk and
butter. They eat meat only from time to time, when an animal is
killed, and sold in portions for so many measures of millet. The
young men often go out hunting, and kill rabbits, hares, the
gazelle, the wild ox, the fox, and the teytel. The latter animal
has the form and appearance of a tame ox, but is not larger than
a
[124]
middle-sized
calf. It has a couple of horns, one or two spans in length, nearly
straight, and bent sometimes forward, sometimes backward. This
animal is remarkably stupid, and only flies if it sees a great
crowd of people; if one or two people draw nigh, it looks with a
tranquil eye and does not move. If the Forians meet a teytel
standing still in a plain, they generally cry, âYa teytel, ya
kafer!âââO teytel, O infidel!â The beast looks at them with
indifference, unless they endeavour to approach quite near. The
teytel seems to be a variety of the wild ox, but is smaller; its
colour is fallow.

Many people in Darfur gain their living by hunting. They are
divided into two classes, and are generally workers in iron. They
rarely appear in the villages, and form a caste apart, called
Darmoudy. They are people without faith and without law, and it is
dangerous to meet them in bye-places. The other Forians never seek
to ally themselves to them by marriage. The first class hunts
quadrupeds, as the gazelle, the wild ox, the elephant, the buffalo,
the hyÃ¦na, the lion, the rhinoceros, &c. They dig pits, in
which they place stakes, and cover them with slight roofings of
branches and earth. When they catch an elephant, they take the
ivory and the skin; the latter is used to make bucklers and
kurbashes. Sometimes the Darmoudies use fixed lassoes to catch
their prey; at other times lances and javelins.

The second class of hunters devotes itself entirely
[125]
to bird-catching. They seek
principally the hoberah, a kind of bustard, which they catch with a
worm and a line, like a fish. Small birds are taken by nets, to
which they are attracted by millet-seeds. If a Darmoudy catches
paroquets, or parrots, he pulls out the feathers of their wings and
takes them home alive in a basket to sell.

There are some Darmoudies who go into the mountains to hunt
various kinds of monkeys. The gun is never used either on this or
on any other occasion. Some rich people keep a slave always
employed in hunting; and I once tried to procure one who was
clever, but did not succeed. The giraffe and the ostrich are hunted
principally by the Bedawin Arabs, who run them down on
horseback.

The Bedawin Arabs of Darfur and WadaÃ¯ are abundantly supplied
with everything necessary to support life. They derive from Darfur
or WadaÃ¯ only a little millet, some maize, and articles of costume.
In exchange for these they sell their surplus of butter, honey,
cattle, skins of wild or domestic animals, leather sacks, whips, or
cords. Most of them are wealthy in butter and in honey. The latter
is found in certain trees where the wild bees make their hives. The
chase supplies the Arabs with many advantages. Ostrich feathers and
rhinocerosâ horns are so plentiful with them as to be of no value.
When I was in WadaÃ¯, a Fezzan merchant came there to buy ostrich
feathers,
[126]
and
applied to the Shereef, who had succeeded my father as Vizier, for
a letter of introduction to the Sheikh, Shaw-shaw, chief of the
tribe of Mahami, in order to induce him to hunt the ostrich for a
moderate price. The merchant had brought fifty Frank ryals, or
dollars. The Shereef wrote the letter for the Fezzanee, who
departed for the district where the tribe was settled. On his
return, he related to me his commercial expedition in these
words:ââWhen I arrived, I was conducted to the tent of the Sheikh,
Shaw-shaw, who received me with bounty and kindness, and gave me a
tent of camelsâ hair, well furnished. He assigned to me a male and
female servant, who attended me in all things. I had brought him a
present, which he accepted with joy, giving me another in exchange,
and I handed over to him my fifty ryals. He called together a
certain number of his Arabs, and said to them,ââThis man is my
guest; he has come and confided himself to me, and wants ostrich
feathers. Let those who wish to gain some of these dollars go forth
to-morrow at dawn of day. Each zhalym-skin shall be paid half a
dollar, and each rabdah-skin a quarter of a dollar.â
[23]

âNext day, accordingly, the Arabs went out and brought me twenty
zhalym-skins. I remained three weeks, and completed a hundred.
Shaw-shaw put them on his camels, and carried them for
me
[127]
to Warah, the
capital of WadaÃ¯. He gave me, also, a plentiful supply of
provisions; as melted ostrich grease, honey, &c. At Warah I
sold nearly ninety zhalym-skins for three dollars each, so that,
without any fatigue, I gained a pretty profit.â

Milk is so plentiful in Arab encampments that they can never use
the whole, in spite of the quantity of butter they make, and are
obliged to throw away a large portion. In the districts of the
Rezeigat, the Red Masirieh, and others, the pools and ponds are all
white with milk.

Very few of the natives of Soudan are able to distinguish gold
from copper, or tin from lead. Gold-dust is sometimes used,
however, as a medium of exchange. In Darfur there are absolutely no
precious metals but such as are imported from abroad, and even the
ornaments of women are principally composed of glass beads. It is
not astonishing, therefore, that the Forians remained long without
knowing the use of silver or gold coins. When commerce, however,
became extended, they were obliged to invent some kind of money,
and they first used rings of pewter, which they employed for the
purchase of daily necessities. For things of a greater price, a
long piece of stuff, about five yards long, and half a yard wide,
is used. Slaves have also a fixed monetary value, according to
their height. For example, a horse may be worth three or four
sedasy, or slave, who, from the heel to the lower lobe of the ear,
measures six spans. In Darfur
[128]
are known neither the mahboub nor the
piastre, nor any kind of coin used in civilised countries, except
the abou-medfah, or pillar-dollar. In the chief towns glass beads
are used as money; and in the parts about Guerly they use the
falgo, or cake of salt, prepared in a particular manner. There are
three kinds of salt in Darfur,âthe zaghawy, which is procured from
the lakes of the same name; the falgo, which is of a grey colour,
opaque, and rather agreeable to the taste; and the mydaoub, which
is of a blood-red colour, and by far the best. At Krousa tobacco is
used as money, and is called taba. It is pounded into a paste, and
made up into hollow cones, about the size of a pear. By the way, I
have read a piece of verses composed by one of the descendants of
the Kaliph Abou-Bekr, the object of which is to prove that smoking
is not a sin. These verses date from about the middle of the ninth
century of the Hegira. I shall extract one or two verses:â

âThe all-powerful God has produced from the soil of our country
a plant, the true name of which is tabgha.

âIf any one in his ignorance maintains that this plant is
forbidden, say to him, âHow do you prove it? By what verse of the
Koran?â

âThis plant does not inebriate, and this is why God has not
condemned it. Whence hast thou taken thy word of condemnation?

âIf thou inspirest the smoke of the tabgha, it rejoices and
solaces thee; but never forget to say
[129]
before the first puff,âBâism Illah, in the
name of God.

âAnd when thou hast finished, give praise to the single God, and
this will bring upon thee abundant blessings.â

In some places little bundles of cotton-twist are used as money,
and at others strings of onions. At one market the iron head of a
kind of hoe is employed; and in the Gouz the same purpose is served
by handfuls of millet. In many places the measure of value is an
ox; and they say, for example, âthis horse is worth ten or twenty
oxen.â

The
Forians, in their
autumn season, which corresponds to our summer, take advantage of
the rain to sow the ground. It is probably on account of these
rains, which are very heavy, that they generally sow neither wheat
nor barley, nor beans nor lentils, nor chick-peas. In Darfur we
found neither apricots nor peaches, nor apples, nor pomegranates,
nor olives, nor prunes, nor pears, nor the sweet-lemon, nor
oranges, nor almonds, nor nuts, nor pistachios, nor walnuts, nor
the fruit of the service-tree. The principal thing cultivated is
the millet; but they also cultivate different kinds of maize. I
have already mentioned, that in some districts wheat is sown. In
the pools, and in places where water stands for some time, rice
grows without any cultivation, and the people gather it in in the
spring.
[131]
Sessame is
sown, but the grain is eaten, and no oil is made. Honey is common
in Darfur, but the wax is made no use of. Houses are lighted by a
kind of wood. Charcoal is never made.

Darfur produces some small water-melons, which are eaten either
fresh, as in Egypt, or dried and steeped in water, so as to make a
kind of sherbet. Onions, garlic, pepper, and various kinds of
cucumbers are sown, and several species of vegetables are found in
some provinces. The river Kou flows through a great valley, which
it inundates in autumn, after which, when the waters retire, an
immense quantity of bamieh springs up spontaneously. There is a
kind of bean peculiar to Darfur.

The only tree in this country which resembles those of Egypt is
the date-palm, which is found in some districts. One of the most
useful trees in the country is the sheglyg, more properly the
thlyleg.
[24]
There are two varieties, called the yellow and
the red, on account of the colour of the fruit, which is about the
size of a large date. The tree, by its stature and appearance,
reminds one of the Egyptian sycamore. The leaves are slightly oval,
and the fruit has a bitter-sweet taste, and a peculiar odour. It is
prepared in a great variety of manners. Every part of the tree is
put to some use. The young sprouts of the leaves are used as a
seasoning; they are also applied to wounds, in a paste prepared by
chewing, and
[132]
form
an effectual cure. The green fruit, pounded in a mortar, is used as
soap, and answers the purpose admirably; as, indeed, do the roots.
The wood of the tree is burned in torches to light the houses, and
produces no smoke. From it also are prepared the slates on which
the children learn to write and read. When burnt, the ashes produce
a slightly bitter salt, which is used for seasoning. In fine, this
tree answers even more purposes of utility than the palm.

There are two kinds of nebk in Darfur, the fruit of which is
used both as food and medicinally. The tebeldy is a great tree with
a hollow trunk, in which the rain collects and forms reservoirs, to
which the wandering Arabs repair to quench their thirst. Its fruit
is used to cure diarrhÅa. The cocoa-nut is found towards the north.
The geddeim produces a small fruit, to which I know of no other
equal. There are many other trees of useful properties growing wild
about the country. Two kinds of cotton are cultivated.

The ochan is a shrub, the different parts of which are applied
to different purposes. It produces, among other things, a kind of
down, which is twisted into thread, and used to repair the
water-skins, to make cords, and to stop leaks in leather sacks. The
juice, when applied to the skin of an animal, makes the hair fall
off. Horse-stealers use it to disguise the animals which they
steal. The tree which produces gum-arabic is found in sandy places.
The vast branches of the haraz afford shadow to a
hundred
[133]
men. There
are many trees which do not produce fruit, but are used only for
timber. However, I will not endeavour to give a complete account of
the vegetable productions of Darfur, because when I was there I was
still young, and ignorant of botany.

The Fertyts, who inhabit the vast country south of Darfur, and
who are idolaters, possess a tree called the gana, which supplies a
very pretty wood, used for making lance-handles.

Among the remarkable plants is the kyly, which produces the
fruit from which is made the ordeal liquor of which I have already
spoken. The leaves of the shalob, when chewed, take away the taste
of wine from the mouth. The dagarah is used as a medicine in
ophthalmia. I once was at the market of Numleh, and, having handled
pepper incautiously, put my hand to my eyes; a severe pain and
great swelling came on, and I was obliged to stop at a village and
go into an old womanâs house, suffering dreadfully. My hostess,
however, sent for some leaves of the dagarah, pounded them in a
mortar, and dropped the juice upon my eyes, and I was cured by one
or two applications.

The greater part of the trees and other vegetables of Darfur
have their fruit ripe towards the end of autumn, which corresponds
to the end of summer in Egypt. The rains begin at the beginning of
their autumn; and I have learned from various points that it is
these rains which assist in
[134]
swelling the river Nile. In 1841 of the
Christian era the great Kadi of WadaÃ¯ told me that 1837, the year
of famine in Egypt, was signalised by an extraordinary drought in
his country. The rainy season is ushered in by great wind-storms,
which roll enormous clouds from the east, raising also vast columns
of sand from the plains of the Gouz. The horizon becomes also of a
blood-red colour. Rain always follows, accompanied by thunder.
During the whole of the season prodigious showers fall, accompanied
by violent thunder-claps. When the lightning falls it commits great
destruction. I have seen branches torn away from great trees, huts
burnt down, and a manâs arm broken. The Forians say that those who
carry iron about them are never struck, which is exactly contrary
to the opinion of the Europeans.

During the Darfur summer great winds prevail, which raise
enormous clouds of dust, and vast mirages inundate the plains. It
has been noticed that the showers which fall during the night are
much more gentle than those that fall by day. Rainbows are common;
I have seen five or six at the same time, some rising straight up
in the air. The rains last about sixty days; if less, there is
famine. In Darfur and WadaÃ¯ the names of the months are of Arab
origin, without any reference to the denominations used by the
Greeks, the Copts, or the Europeans.

I shall now say something of the marvellous qualities of some
plants of Darfur. I do so with
[135]
some hesitation, fearing to be accused of
falsehood; but there are some extraordinary things which must be
told. The chief properties of these magic plants are in the roots.
There exist in Darfur master-herbalists, who have scholars under
them. They unite from time to time to go on expeditions, and climb
the mountains, and plunge into the valleys in search of plants.
They are called in Darfur, Magicians, and enjoy a certain
reputation. They are all in rivalry one against another, and in
strong competition. They keep their roots in horns of goats, rams,
or oxen.

These roots are used for different purposes; among others, to
compose what is called the narrah. When I was in Darfur, there was
at Jedid es-Seil a certain man named Bakourloukou, who acquired an
astonishing reputation by the magical power of his narrah. When any
one loved a young girl who was too rebellious to his wishes, he
used to go to Bakourloukou and buy of his narrah, and rub his face
and hands therewith. Afterwards, when he met with her he loved, he
passed his hand over her shoulders, or some other part of the body,
and love at once filled her heart, and she could no longer live
without him. Even if her parents refused their consent to her
marriage, she eloped with her lover. Moreover, if any one had a
request to make to the Sultan, and bought some of this narrah, he
was sure to succeed. Bakourloukou obtained in this way an
extraordinary reputation; and it became a saying
[136]
among the women, that he could
obtain for any one two girls for five yards of cotton. One day a
person who had some narrah came to see me, and wanted me to buy;
but I refused, saying, âthat I was young enough to please women for
myself, and that I was in favour with the Sultan.â

The Forians also possess roots by which they can do evil to
their enemies. There is one which causes death if it be buried in
the earth, in the shade of the head of the intended victim, who is
at once struck with bewilderment and loses all consciousness, and
perishes if a proper antidote be not administered. By similar means
any particular member is paralysed. Others stun people by the smoke
of certain roots, collected in a sleeve, which they shake in their
faces.
[25]

The Forians also possess roots, the quality of which is to
overcome people with a singular lethargy. They are principally used
by robbers, who penetrate with them by night into houses, and if
they find the inhabitants awake shake them towards them three
times, upon which God shuts their ears and they understand nothing.
The robber then comes and goes without fear; and sometimes kills a
sheep, skins it, roasts it, and eats some of it, and puts a piece
of the liver into the hands of each of the sleepers, and goes away,
carrying with him what he wants. A little after the people awake
from their trance, and
[137]
ask one another what kind of man it was
they had seen, and what he can have been doing. Then only they
discover, but too late, the robbery that has been committed.

This employment of the mysterious power of plants is a thing
known to every Forian. I once asked a learned man what he thought
of these matters, and he replied:ââThe books sent by God to the
prophets, Adam, Seth, and Abraham, &c., have been buried in the
earth, and God has caused these magical plants to grow above them.
The winds spread their seeds to the four corners of the earth, and
experience has discovered the strange virtues which have been
communicated to them by the Divine Spirit contained in these
ancient writings.â For my part, I see in all these things works of
enchantment and sorcery. The same effects are produced, in fact, by
the magical force of certain figures traced in a certain manner,
and by invocations of the superior and inferior angels. I shall
relate some examples.

Persons of good faith and acknowledged veracity have certified
to me, that in the war which took place between the Kaliph, son of
Tyrab, and the Sultan Abd-er-Rahman, some partisans of the former,
who were armed with guns, were so powerfully charmed by sorcerers
on the other side that their weapons produced no effect. On another
occasion, the Fakih Malik bewildered the sons of the Sultan and
threw them into the hands of Kourra and Fadhl, against whom they
had revolted.

[138]
The persons most
celebrated in Darfur for their charms and magical doings are the
Foulans, or Felattahs. One of them, named Tamourrou, used to
perform the most miraculous acts. A person worthy of credit related
to me the following instance: âI went with Tamourrou,â he said,
âfrom Jedid-kerio to the Fasher; the sun was burning hot; the
magician was mounted on a camel; he took his cloak and spread it
before him, and then folded it up, and, placing it on his knee,
pronounced certain words: afterwards he threw it in the air, and it
unfolded and remained spread over him and me like a parasol, as if
held by invisible hands. Wherever Tamourrouâs camel moved it
followed. This was an extraordinary fact. Well, we were proceeding
on in the shade, when suddenly the rain came on and fell in
torrents. Upon this Tamourrou said to his servant, who was
following him on foot: âGive me a handful of sand;â and having
pronounced certain words, whirled his hand round his head in a
circle, scattering the sand as he did so. The rain-cloud
immediately separated, one part going to the right and the other to
the left, and we continued our route without having a thread
wetted.â

It is also related that some people have the power of paralysing
whoever attempts to attack them. But the most extraordinary facts
are those which are related of the Massalits and the Temourkehs,
who have the power of metamorphosing themselves into different
kinds of animals. All the
[139]
Forians say that the former can change into
hyÃ¦nas, cats, and dogs, and the latter into lions. Another
extraordinary thing related of the Temourkehs is that, according to
their own account, three days after their death, they resuscitate
and come out of their tombs, and go into other countries to marry
again, and accomplish a second life.

In Darfur, every one acknowledges that the Sultan has under his
orders a number of men having the power of metamorphosing
themselves. They are used as agents and ambassadors. If they are in
danger of being seized, they transform themselves into air or wind.
I once became very intimate with one of these people, and at length
ventured to speak on the subject of his wonderful power, but he
turned aside the conversation, and avoided a direct answer. Another
time I pressed the question closer, upon which he smiled and
said:ââI did not think you were so simple as to believe all that is
said on this subject.â Then he talked of other things, and soon
left me, and from that time forward, whenever he met me he turned
aside, and our acquaintance utterly ceased.

I was once following a Ghazwah, or slave-hunt, directed against
the Fertyts by a king. As he owed me a debt, he took me with him to
pay me from the slaves he was to capture.
[26]

We advanced far into Dar-Fertyt, and remained there three months,
in a
[140]
place without
fruits or vegetables. One day the king sent for me, and I found him
surrounded by green onions and long cucumbers, as fresh as if just
plucked from the garden. I asked who had given them to him?

âThey arrived from Darfur,â said he.

âWho brought them? and how can their freshness have been
preserved?â

âThey have been transported hither in an instantâlook at this
letter, and see the date of it.â

I took the letter, and found that it was from one of his friends
in Darfur, and that it was dated the same morning.

âDo not be so surprised,â said the king, âfor we have with us
men of Temourkeh, who have the faculty of transforming themselves
as they please, and of traversing the greatest distance in a very
short period of time.â

âI should wish,â said I, âto see some of these people.â

âYou shall,â said he; and accordingly, on our return, we passed
through a village of the Temourkehs, and stopped there to pass the
night. In the morning the people came to visit the king, and the
chief said to him,â

âI beg, if you see any lions on your way, not to attack them,
for they are our companions metamorphosed.â

âBut,â said the king, âI should like to hear some of them
roar.â

[141]
âThe thing is
easy,â replied the Temourkeh; and he called three of his men by
name, and they came near him, and then went away and disappeared in
the plain. Presently we heard a roar that made us tremble, and the
other animals exhibit their fear.

âThat,â said the Temourkeh, âis such a one;â and called him by
his name. Two other roars, each more terrible still, were heard,
and then the sham lions came back in their human shape. They kissed
the hands of the king, who felicitated them, and made them presents
of new garments.

âWell,â said he, afterwards, to me, âyou have seen these men; it
was they who brought us the onions and the cucumbers in the
solitudes of Dar-Fertyt.â

I must not omit to mention the sand-diviners, who discover
things that are both past and future. I had once reason to believe
in their predictions, on the occasion of my journey from Darfur to
WadaÃ¯. I knew a man, named Salem, who had a son-in-law named Ishak,
who was very learned in the service of the sand. I did not know how
to provide for the expenses of my journey, and went to this
magician, who performed his calculations and uttered his prophecy.
I did not believe him at first, but I swear, before God, that
everything he predicted to me was realised to the letter, as if he
had read in the book of destiny. He answered to me that I should
succeed in departing for WadaÃ¯, with all those who composed my
house, except my fatherâs wife, who would remain
[142]
in Darfur. I said this was
impossible, because she was most interested of any of us in our
departure. But it came to pass that my fatherâs wife refused to go,
and escaped on the eve of departure, leaving to us her daughter,
aged about seven years. We never knew what became of her. Ishak
also said to me,ââThe day that you arrive in your fatherâs house at
WadaÃ¯ you will receive a young slave answering such a description,
but you will not find your father until you come to Tunis. The
house of thy father is red.â These and other predictions were
fulfilled to the letter.

Whilst we were with Ishak many women came, in a state of great
excitement, to learn where they might find things that had been
stolen from them. He pointed out the place, but refused to betray
the robbers.

My uncle Zarouk once related to me that my father lost a camel
in the desert, and found it by means of a sand-diviner; and many
other curious things are told. However, I shall not enter into
further detail on this subject, for God only knows what is
true.

CHAPTER I.

Long Residence of the Sheikh in WadaÃ¯ â Message
from his Father â The Sultan opposes his Departure â He is
Imprisoned â His Slaves begin to desert him â His hard Case â The
Sultan going his rounds â He returns to his Land â A Kingâs Journey
â The Sheikh receives permission to depart â Annoying Delays â
March of an Army in the Desert â The Travellers are abandoned â
Night in the Wilderness â WadaÃ¯ans â Safe Arrival and
Reception.

After
my father left Darfur
I remained there seven years and some months, during which time I
visited many places, and rested under many trees, wandering hither
and thither, mixing with the inhabitants, sometimes going to the
north and sometimes to the south. Everywhere I was received by the
principal persons of each country, and I made a point of seeking
the society of all men at all remarkable for instruction. I
examined everything, great and small, and from whomsoever seemed to
possess any interesting notions I begged the dew of his knowledge
and the rain-shower of his learning. In a
[144]
word, I did my best to obtain information
of every kind, both from persons of high and low degree.

When I had gathered what I desired of this kind, I thought of
taking a little rest, and of earning some gold and silver. I was
tranquilly established in my village, occupied with my agricultural
speculations, enjoying what God had bestowed upon me, and
endeavouring to increase my well-being, when I received a letter
from my father, announcing his approaching departure from WadaÃ¯ to
Tunis. âI want,â said he to me, âto see my mother again, and I wish
not to leave in Soudan any of those who are dear to me. On receipt
of this letter hasten to join me. It is my wish that we should all
set out together. Bring with thee thy family, and come immediately.
Salutations.â So I immediately prepared for departure, and was
ready in a few days. Little did I think of what Fortune had in
store for me.

I departed with my family from the village where I was
established, and repaired to Tendelty, to obtain my leave of
absence. But, on reaching the Fasher, I learned that the Sultan of
WadaÃ¯ was marching against Dar-Tamah, a country situated to the
west of the northern provinces of Darfur. It is of considerable
extent, and bristles all over with mountains. Its Sultan
acknowledges himself as a vassal of Darfur. The news of this
expedition had just reached Tendelty; and it was said that the
Sultan of WadaÃ¯ intended, if he were successful, to
[145]
pursue his conquests, and
attack Darfur itself. These reports had much disquieted Mohammed
Fadhl, who was making preparations for war, and levying a great
army. There could be no worse time for me to make my request.
However, I presented myself at court, and asked permission to go
and join my father. Fadhl frowned terribly, and turned away his
head, and the tranquil air with which he had been discussing
business entirely disappeared.

âThy father,â said he, with a severe aspect, âis verily singular
in his way of going on. Does he imagine that we cannot divine his
intentions? Does he think to deceive me? He wants to have thee by
him, and enjoy thy presence, because his new Sultan is advancing
against us, and is about to enter this country with his army. His
object is to save thee from the dust and the danger of battle. But
no! thou shalt not depart. Thou shalt not procure him this
pleasure.â

Then the Sultan ordered the Sheikh, Abdallah Dagasa, to keep
watch over me until the conclusion of the war. This Sheikh had
succeeded Kourra in the post of Ab. He shut me up, with all those
who were to have departed with me, in a house opposite his own, and
ordered ten of his people to watch me. These ten gaolers came with
their baggage, and installed themselves at the entrance of my
prison, and under the eaves of my hut. For my part, I was forbidden
to cross the threshold, though my people could come and go as they
pleased. Two sentinels
[146]
kept watch all night. God knows what
sadness overwhelmed me, and what dismal thoughts soon filled my
mind. I succeeded, however, in gaining the friendship of the chief
of my guardians, by inviting him to eat with me. He was naturally a
good person, and treated me with politeness. Whenever I rose he
rose also, out of respect.

My store of provisions was soon exhausted. I asked permission to
send some one to my village to get a fresh supply, but this was
refused me, by the influence of Fakih Malik. I was therefore
obliged to make up my mind to sell some of my slaves, and they at
once began to hate me, though they had formerly exhibited the
greatest attachment. A young girl escaped from the prison, and I
could not learn whither she had gone. I wished to go out by day to
seek for her, but my guardians dissuaded me, saying that it would
be wiser to go by night. I went, therefore, after sunset to Fakih
Malik, and informed him of the loss of my slave, with tears in my
eyes. The Fakih seemed to sympathise with me, but said I was
imprudent to venture out of prison, and that if the Sultan came to
know of it he would punish me severely, for his anger against my
father was still great. He added, however, that he would do his
best for me, and promised to cause my beautiful slave to be sought
for. I then told him that my provisions were exhausted, and that
from care I could sleep neither night nor day. I had already been
obliged to sell one slave-girl to have
[147]
wherewith to feed my people. âIs it true,â
I asked, âthat the Sultan refuses me permission to send to my
village for provisions?â âI promise,â replied he, âto obtain for
thee what thou desirest. I swear to thee by the god of this dark
night.â I testified my gratitude to Malik, and went away satisfied
with his reception and his promises. But I waited several days in
my prison in vain, and felt that I had been deceived. Then I wrote
to him a letter, in which, having spoken respectfully, like a son
to his father, I reminded him of his promise, and told him that I
had no longer either provisions or money; that the price of the
slave sold was spent; and that I had no longer even wherewith to
eat. One of my guards carried this letter, and returned soon
afterwards with an answer, in which, after the usual form of
politeness, he said to me:ââA prudent man puts by sufficient for
the hour of want. Do as thou pleasest. I have begged permission for
thee of the Sultan, and thereby roused his anger, so that he gave
me no direct answer. Wait until God creates more favourable
circumstances. His providence watches over all. Know, also, that if
thou wert not of the noble blood of the Shereefs it would have gone
harder with thee. Salutations.â

On receiving this letter I was overwhelmed with grief; but
resignation was the only thing left to me. Some days afterwards,
two slave-girls and a male slave escaped from my prison. Then I
repented
[148]
me that I
had not already sold all my slaves. Their flight drove me to
despair, and I was devoured by disquietude; but I wrote no more to
Fakih Malik. I had now only left a slave-woman, blind of one eye,
who had been the concubine of my uncle, another woman, who was my
own concubine, and two Sedasy slaves. One morning I missed my
concubine. She also had fled. This last blow was too much. I felt
like the bird that has no longer any means of escaping from its
cage. I called the chief of my guards, and related to him my
sorrows. He was saddened, and he sighed and groaned, and, at the
same time, endeavoured to console me.

When the night came I went out with one of my guards, once more
determined to seek an interview with Malik, and to lay my case
before him. We had not gone far when a troop of horsemen came
riding down the street, and were close upon us before we observed
them. The Sultan himself was making his rounds through the city,
and distributing patrols and guards to prevent spies from
penetrating into the capital. Whoever on these occasions was found,
without being able to give a good account of himself, was put to
death. Many thus lost their lives. The expedition of the people of
WadaÃ¯ against Tamah was the reason of this unusual rigour.

When we were met by the cavalcade of the Sultan, some one cried
out,â

[149]
âWho goes
there?â

I answered, âThe Shereef, son of the Shereef Omar of Tunis.â

âStop,â said the horseman; âhere is the Sultan.â

I stood still, and the troop gathered round me, reining in their
horses. I was alone, for my companion, at the first sound of the
trampling of hoofs, had fled away like a bird. The Sultan drew
nigh. Happily for me there was with him one of his viziers, with
whom I was intimately united in friendship, named Suliman Tyr. Then
the Sultan said to me,â

âWho art thou?â

And the man who had hailed me at once put in,ââThis is the man
whose father is at WadaÃ¯.â

âAnd why art thou abroad at this hour?â said the Sultan.

Then I laid before him my misfortunes, and spoke of the loss of
my slaves, and of all I possessed. My teeth chattered for fear.

âBut,â said the Sultan, âdid I not set a guard over thee?â

âYes, prince, and that is the cause of my misfortune. I am kept
in prison, but my slaves are allowed to fly, and none remain to me.
I wished to take advantage of the darkness, to go forth and visit
Malik, and lay before him my case, in the hope that he would speak
to your majesty, and that you would order either my deliverance or
my death; for it is better to die than to live in this
anguish.â

[150]
âHow is
that?â

âPrince of the faithful,â replied I, âI no longer possess
anythingâneither provisions nor slaves. I have passed many days
without eating. I have so suffered from hunger that I can no longer
sleep. In a moment of fever I have stolen a handful of millet from
a measure set before an ass, and devoured it like a beast of
burden. I am in despair. Misfortune holds my two hands down in the
dust.â

Then Suliman Tyr came forward, and bent his knees, and begged,
in the name of our friendship, that I should not be made
responsible for the faults of my father, but that I should be
restored to liberty. His pleading was so eloquent, that the Sultan
was afflicted, and said,â

âI take away thy guards, and restore thee to liberty; but thou
shalt not depart from Tendelty until I am well assured that the
Sultan of WadaÃ¯ has given up the idea of warring upon us, and has
returned to his country.â

These words recalled me to life, and calmed my sorrows, and I
said,â

âI beg that your majesty will allow me to return to my estates,
to take wherewith to live. I have suffered all that can be
suffered. Perfumes are for wedding-nights, not for other nights. I
only ask what is absolutely necessary. Grant me this grace, and may
God reward you.â

The Sultan acquiesced in this demand, and allowed me full right
over my property; so I returned full
[151]
of joy, happy at having attained my object,
and being delivered from my prison. It was now four months from the
commencement of my captivity. I quoted the words of the
Prophet,ââIf Sadness enters the lizardâs hole, Joy follows it, and
drives it out.â I passed the night most tranquilly, and in the
morning my guards were taken away, and I felt myself at liberty. I
went immediately to see Malik, who congratulated me on my
deliverance, but was in reality grieved and disconcerted.

I then sent to my village for grain and provisions for me and my
people, and remained at the Fasher until the season when the rain
began to fall in torrents. Then I received the order to go to
Aboul-Joudoul and remain there. So I departed, and, returning to my
old dwelling, began to cultivate my land, and, above all, to sow
millet, which forms the principal food of the Forians. The
seed-time was favourable, and every one predicted for me an
abundant harvest. My fields were magnificent, and the village
envied me.

Some time before the harvest season I was visited by one of the
kings of Darfur, who invited me to accompany him on a journey he
was about to make. I allowed myself to be persuaded, and departed
from Aboul-Joudoul, in hopes to acquire this kingâs good-will.
After one dayâs journey we reached a country where were many
relations of his, and stopped to pass the night. He was detained
there the next day and treated to a magnificent
[152]
repast. Nothing could exceed
the politeness with which I myself was entertained. I was full of
joy, when suddenly there rode up to us one of the Sultanâs special
couriers, and, having saluted the company, said,â

âWhich of you is the son of the Shereef Omar?â

âI am the man,â replied I; âat thy service.â âThe Sultan asks
for thee. Take the trouble to come to the Fasher.â

âWillingly,â said I; but it was evident to all that I was
troubled. The king said to me,â

âWherefore this fear?â

âIt is because I am ignorant why the Sultan sends for me.â

âThis,â said he, âis no cause of disquietude; why shouldst thou
torment thyself?â

However, I still remained uneasy, and when night came went forth
secretly and ordered my slave to saddle my horse, and, departing
with him, rode all night, and by dawn of day reached Aboul-Joudoul.
Here I learned that the courier had been in search of me. I took
provisions, issued my orders, and, getting upon another horse,
pushed on to Tendelty without stopping. On arriving, I went to the
house of Malik, who received me graciously, and said,â

âThe Sultan, our master, consents to thy departure. Thou art
free; he leaves thee to do as thou wilt, except that thou must be
ready to go
[153]
in a
week. Return to thy house, take thy family, and depart with the
swiftness of a bird.â

âBut,â said I, âmy fields are sown, and we are on the eve of the
harvest. Will not the Sultan allow me time to gather in my
crops?â

âListen to me,â he replied; âthe Sultan, our master, is going to
send the Fakih Ahmed Abou-Sarrah as an ambassador to the Prince of
WadaÃ¯. It is his desire that thou shouldst depart with this
expedition. If thou wilt take advantage of this opportunity,
prepare at once. Think well of the matter, for at a future time it
will not be possible for thee to leave Darfur. As for thy crops,
care not for them. However, thou art wise enough to choose for
thyself.â

I accordingly agreed to go, and returned to Aboul-Joudoul to get
ready. I abandoned, though unwilling, my crops, which would have
been very profitable, and made a present of them, before witnesses,
to one of my servants. Then I returned with my family to the
Fasher, and waited upon Malik, who handed over to me a passport
signed by the Sultan, recommending me to all the chiefs by the way.
We had special orders for the governor of the western province, by
which we were to leave Darfur, requesting him to accompany us with
his soldiers until he brought us to a place of safety. âTake this
order,â said Malik, âand go and join Sarrah, who waits for thee at
Kelkabieh.â
[154]
I took
the paper, and having thanked Malik, bade him adieu.

Next morning I set out, and arrived in two days at Kelkabieh. I
stopped at Sarf-el-Degaj to see Ahmed the younger, son of Ahmed
Bedawee, with whom I had come from Cairo. I remained with him
twelve days, whilst we waited to collect a sufficient number of
travellers for WadaÃ¯. Then we set out, taking the direction of the
western province, that is to say, the province of the Massalit. We
reached it in five days, and on the sixth presented ourselves
before the king of the province, and showed him our firman. He
received us well, and promised to accompany us with his troops, and
to leave us only when we should be out of danger, but he would not
depart, he said, before thirty days were over. We laid before him
our remonstrance, to the effect that this delay would be too long,
and that our provisions would be exhausted; but he told us that he
had business to perform which rendered it necessary for him to
remain. We flattered him, and, so to speak, scratched his head to
soothe him, as the camel-drivers soothe their beasts; but he
remained obstinate, and we were compelled to tarry in that country
until the thirty days had expired. Then we presented ourselves
before him, and reminded him of his promise; but he put us off once
more for three days, swearing that he would then set out. We waited
until the
[155]
three
days passed, and threatened to return. Then he got into a passion,
and made loud complaints, and invented all kinds of explanations.
âThis time,â said he, âin three days I will depart without fail.
God is the hope of us all, and he will relieve me from my
embarrassments.â

We agreed, however unwilling, to wait, and these other three
days being passed, presented ourselves to him, and said,ââThe
honest man performs what he promises, and clouds give rain after
thunder.â This time he set out with us, followed by some of his
troops and guards. Our caravan marched under his protection for
three days, which, such were his attentions to us, seemed like a
continued festival. But the fourth day we halted upon one of his
estates, at the extreme limit of the province. Here he spent the
whole week collecting his soldiers, horse and foot. New
embarrassment on our part, new delaysâwe feared again to see our
journey put off.

However, every day new additions were made to our company;
troops of men came flocking in from all sides; and our encampment
resembled that of an army. One morning he looked abroad and saw
that he had sufficient strength, and ordered the camels to be
laden, and gave the signal of departure. It was still early when we
started; our caravan was placed in the middle of the army, which
marched in one mass. Presently we got beyond the cultivated
country, and entered the uninhabited
[156]
districts which separate, like a wall,
Darfur from WadaÃ¯. In this wilderness we beheld an innumerable
quantity of wild animals, from the elephant down to the gazelle and
the hare. The hares, frightened by the noise we made in marching,
started up from their covers, and flying on all sides, as if blind,
came some of them into the midst of the soldiers, who killed them
nearly at their feet. A great number of gazelles and other animals,
bewildered by this invasion of their territory, were killed without
trouble. The army amused itself thus with hunting until the great
heat of the day had passed, when the king set up his tent, and all
by degrees followed his example. Fires were lighted over the whole
surface of the plain, and all the game taken was roasted. The meal
finished, and the heat somewhat subsiding, we again set out; but
suddenly our progress was arrested, and the vacillating governor
rode up and informed us that he intended to return. I alone dared
to make an objection. âIf thou returnest,â said I, âwe will return
with thee. We will not remain here, unescorted, in the midst of
these solitudes.â He endeavoured to excuse himself, alleging his
numerous occupations, but we insisted that our safety should be
provided for. Then he gave us one of his suite as a guide, with an
escort of fifty or sixty horsemen, and told him to accompany us
until we were in safety, and until we sent him away. Then we bade
adieu to the king, who immediately
[157]
set off at a gallop, followed by the great
mob of his army, and returned towards his country, and as we
pursued our way in the other direction their murmur and trampling
soon no longer came to us, and the last stragglers disappeared
amidst the trees. Our guide escorted us for some hours, and then
pulled up and told us that he intended to leave us. We made what
opposition we could, and repeated to him over and over again that
we were without means of defence; that four armed men would be
sufficient to destroy us; and that, if anything happened to us, our
blood would be upon his head. âNay,â said he, âI will not proceed,
for you are now near the cultivated lands of WadaÃ¯; and we are
afraid, on account of our enemies. If they perceive us, blood will
be spilt, and it will be your fault.â We conjured him in the name
of all the saints and of all the prophets, and exerted ourselves to
persuade him to accompany us a little farther. He yielded; but
scarcely had he escorted us a quarter of an hour more when he and
his companions again reined in, and said that they would not
advance a single step farther. He swore that he had never led out
his escort to so great a distance before, and, having given us a
guide, and received our adieus, galloped off and left us. Then fear
entered our minds: every bush, every clump of trees, seemed to us
to be men approaching to kill us. Uneasiness blinded our eyes;
night was coming on; there seemed to be no longer a
single
[158]
drop of
blood in our veins, so greatly were we terrified.

Darkness came over us in the middle of a forest. We made our
camels kneel down, and hastened to collect wood and light great
fires all around to keep off the lions. We passed a melancholy
night of fear, ever on the watch. Only few of the most stupid were
able to sleep; for the roaring of the lions and the howling of the
wolves and the hyenas continually filled our ears. Sometimes also
the crashing step of an elephant made us shudder for our safety. We
saw an incredible number of these huge animals in the forest; on
the ground, moreover, were spread on all sides great quantities of
tusks, which had grown yellow in the sun, and even black. We
observed some enormous ones, sufficient of themselves to lade a
good camel; others were split in two, or covered with crevices in
an incalculable number.

During the night we kept good watch, and the next day, before
sunrise, we had laden our camels, which soon went swinging away
with their regular step through the trees. Having marched for about
three hours, we entered a district which appeared to be cultivated,
and our guide declared to us that he dared not go any farther, and
bidding us adieu hastened away, fearing for himself. We proceeded
for about a quarter of an hour, when suddenly there appeared coming
down upon us a troop of cavaliers, fully armed, bearing lances with
large iron heads, and javelins. They threw several of the latter
towards
[159]
us, and we
halted and cried, âPeace! peace! we are merely travellers, your
guests!âââDo not move,â they answered; âremain where you are, and
wait till we have informed the governor.â We halted in the sun, not
being allowed even to go under the shade of some trees that were at
a little distance from us; we sat down under cover of four camels.
The horsemen of WadaÃ¯ took position opposite to us, and allowed us
neither to advance nor to retire. But, meanwhile, they had sent a
messenger to their governor, or king, who soon appeared,
accompanied by some ten horsemen. His approach was announced by the
sharp jingling of the bells which hung on the necks of the horses.
The troop drew nigh, and, putting foot to ground, sat under the
shade of a tree, and called us to them. We advanced, and when we
were near at hand one of the horsemen came a little forward, and
said to us: âThe king salutes you.â It is customary for a WadaÃ¯an
king never to address himself directly to his visitors; he
communicates with them only through one of his suite. We returned
the salutation, and the same horseman said to us: âThe king demands
who you may be, whence you come, and what is the object of your
visit?âââWe come from Darfur,â was our reply; âour caravan is
composed of merchants, of an envoy from the Prince of Darfur, and
of another individual, a simple traveller, the Shereef, son of Omar
of Tunis.â

[160]
Our names were
written down upon paper, and the king, mounting his horse, departed
with five of his people, leaving the other five with those who at
first met us. As he departed he said: âRemain here until you
receive my orders.â We made our camels kneel down, and sat
ourselves under the shade of a tree. Our guards gave us some water,
and we waited about two hours, when there came to us, jingling
their bells, another troop of horsemen. They were dressed in a long
and ample garment, like the black dress of the Fellatah women of
Egypt; but they were bareheaded. Every one of them, behind each
ear, had a swelling something like the bubo of a plague-patient.
These swellings are produced artificially, by the means of cups
applied behind the ears, and from which the air is exhausted by
suction. When the cups or horns are taken away the tumefied skin is
puckered up by the fingers, and two lines of incisions being made,
the portion of skin between them is removed, and the cups are again
applied. When a good deal of blood has been drawn, cotton is
applied, and, the wound being healed, there remains a projection
resembling a gland. The people of WadaÃ¯ lay great stress upon these
swellings, which may be called bumps of courage. Whoever does not
possess them is looked upon as a coward, and is repulsed on all
hands. In the language of the country they are called Dauma, in
allusion to the fruit of the Daum. The WadaÃ¯ans despise
strangers
[161]
who are
not thus distinguished, thinking it impossible that any one can be
courageous who does not possess these bumps.

As I have said, all these horsemen were bareheaded, except their
chief, who wore a skull-cap of black stuff; he had also a Melayeb,
or scarf-mantle, over his shoulders. The party alighted at a
certain distance and ordered us to approach, and when we drew nigh
their chief said:ââThe Aguid (or governor), my master, salutes
you.â We answered by compliments to the chief and to the Sultan;
and after some further communications our names were written down,
accompanied by a complete description of ourselves and the
merchandise we brought with us. This done, we were told to wait
during the hot time of the day, when they promised to take us to
the Aguid.

We rested in the shade, and ate, and drank, and slept, until the
heat of the sun diminished, and the shadows were lengthening, when
we were ordered to mount our camels. The WadaÃ¯ans surrounded us,
and we marched rapidly until dark, when we reached the residence of
the governor. This residence had a court nearly as large as the
Roumeileh, one of the great squares of Cairo. We were placed in one
corner, and soon after we had arranged our baggage were called, to
be presented to the Aguid. They took us to the principal hut in the
centre of the enclosure, where we were told to sit down opposite a
partition
[162]
made of
reeds. Some one came out and said the Aguid salutes you. We
returned the salute, and the governor himself, from behind the
partition which separated him from us, said: âWho may you be, and
wherefore do you come to WadaÃ¯? whence do you come, and what
merchandise do you bring?â We answered appropriately, and were then
told that we might consider ourselves as the guests of the Sultan,
who was to be immediately apprised of our arrival. A courier was,
indeed, immediately despatched to the capital, and we waited
patiently under the protection of the governor of the eastern
province for seven days, during which food was given us.

On the eighth day the messenger returned, accompanied by a troop
of horsemen. They had with them a wooden tambourine, the sound of
which may be heard at a great distance, and straight trumpets, at
least three cubits in length, which produce a strong sound. As they
approached the village the troop announced itself by this curious
music. The Aguid, with all his people, went out to receive it. The
bells hung at the necks of the horses jingled. I noticed
particularly that every steed had a housing of red leather.

When the horsemen had alighted and set themselves in a circle on
the ground, we were ordered to approach, and the same series of
questions by which we had already been so often tormented was put
to us, and written down in the same way, and our
[163]
answers written down in the
same way, and compared with the former ones. After this we passed
the night tranquilly, and next day began to march, accompanied by
the Kamkolak Nasser. We advanced three days until we reached Abaly,
a place where all strangers arriving in WadaÃ¯ are placed, as it
were, for three days in quarantine, although there is no reason for
doing so, in the fear of pestilence. We resigned ourselves to our
fate, and prepared to pass our time as best we might; but shortly
after sunset my uncle Zarouk, who had heard of my arrival, came and
told me that my father had departed for Tunis, no longer expecting
me to be able to escape from Darfur. My uncle had asked permission
of the Sultan to withdraw me immediately from Abaly; and I
accordingly loaded my camels, and went with him to a house that
belonged to my father, and was situated at no great distance. A
good nightâs rest soon made me forget my fatigue. Next morning I
remarked the red colour of the walls of the house, and remembered
the sand-diviner, Ishak of Darfur, and his marvellous predictions.
Zarouk prepared in my honour a repast of welcome, and invited
guests, and the Sultan himself sent the materials of a veritable
banquet. The messes were carried in twelve oblong wooden tubs, with
chain handles, each carried by four slaves. This present was
preceded by a young eunuch, according to the custom of the country
on such occasions. I was told that this was meant
[164]
as a compliment to my father,
who had been a vizier of the Sultan. The tubs were full, some of
rice cooked in honey; others of fowls fried in butter; others of
young pigeons; others of cakes of delicious taste. We gave a share
to the slave-porters, and ate ourselves, and fed our servants, and
treated the guests and the neighbours, and yet there remained still
a vast quantity of viands.

Next evening the Sultan sent seven more tubs, and an equal
number the following day. On the third day Nasser and the first
interpreter of the Sultan came to see us, and I gave to them my
presents for his majesty. These presents were very humble;
consisting, among other things, of ten pounds of yemen coffee, in
the berry, ten pounds of soap, and two rings of latten, weighing
each two pounds. My offerings, though of slight value, were
accepted graciously, on account of the respect the prince bore my
father; and on the evening of the same day a eunuch came from the
Sultan, and presented me with a large parcel and two young female
slaves, one still a virgin, but the other, who was not so, much
handsomer and better dressed. I returned my thanks, and we recited
the Fatha in honour of the Sultan. On the following morning another
eunuch came, accompanied by several individuals and by laden
camels, bringing fresh presents. These consisted of five jars of
honey, ten jars of butter, two loads of wheat, a load of salt fish,
a load of tekaki,
[165]

or parcels of thread or cotton used as money, a grey horse, saddled
and bridled, fed by a slave, seven spans high, and two
women-slaves, as servants. We expressed our gratitude, and uttered
sincere prayers for the Sultan. In the packet I have mentioned were
found two garments of the finest tissue, one black and one white,
each worth at least the price of two slaves, and a piece of English
calico. Besides all these things, I received two bulls, ready for
killing, and a young she-camel. From time to time other presents
were sent me; among others, a couple hundreds of eggs of the
speckled hen. In WadaÃ¯ these hens live wild, and lay in the spring,
when the peasants collect immense quantities of eggs. It is
customary every year for each canton to send to the Sultan at least
a hundred camel-loads, which are generally distributed to the
courtiers.

I had been four months in WadaÃ¯ without having seen, or been
seen, by the Sultan. An accident caused my reception. According to
the decrees of God, my hand was burnt by an explosion of gunpowder.
The Sultan learned my misfortune, and was told I suffered
dreadfully; so he sent me a jar of olive-oil, which had been
preserved for more than sixty years, and had acquired a red tint
and bitter taste. This oil was my salvation, for by it God cured
me. I went to the mosque to pray, and was afterwards sent for to
the palace by the Sultan, who received me with benevolence. He
recommended me
[166]
to
pursue my studies, and advised me to put myself under the teaching
of Sheikh Seid Ahmed, who was at that time giving lessons of civil
and religious law at Warah. I did so for some time, and read
several learned books; but a misunderstanding with the Sheikh
caused me to abandon these studies and his society.

[167]
CHAPTER II.

People of WadaÃ¯ â Historical Facts â Sultan Seleih
â How his Dynasty was founded â Abbaside descent â Boundary Mark in
the Desert â Wars between Darfur and WadaÃ¯ â A wise Vizier â Youth
of Saboun â His Schemes â How to win a Throne â A Sea of Blood â
Fratricidal Battles â The Victor and the Vanquished â Ferocious
Conduct â The Afrits or Robbers â A Brother still at large â He is
taken and killed â Pacification of WadaÃ¯.

The
manners and customs of
WadaÃ¯ have many points of resemblance with those of Darfur, but
differ in some respects. The food of the people, the clothing of
the women, and the ornaments used, are almost exactly the same in
both countries; but there is a great difference in the government
and the administration. The character of the people of WadaÃ¯, too,
is remarkable for liberalityâa virtue not common in Darfur. I
shall, however, before entering into detail on this subject, give
some account of the origin of the reigning dynasty, for it is
impossible to understand the manners of a country without knowing
something of its history.

During my sojourn in WadaÃ¯ I noticed, that
[168]
when I went on Friday to the mosque the
ImÃ¢m invariably uttered this prayer,ââMay God grant a victory
everywhere to our Sultan Mohammed Abd-el-Kerim, son of the Sultan
Mohammed Saleh, son of the Sultan Mohammed Gaudeh, son of the
Sultan Seleih!â This suggested to me that I could ask some old men
what was the origin of this Sultan Seleih. The answers given were
various. Some said that he belonged to a tribe named Sennawides,
after one of the mountains of the country.

But I afterwards observed, on the seal of the reigning Sultan,
these words,ââThe Sultan Mohammed, son of the Sultan Seleih, the
Abbaside.â I sought to find out by what genealogical affiliation
the name of that noble family could be mixed up with the history of
these non-Arab peoples. But those whom I consulted gave me
contradictory accounts, some saying that the reigning dynasty had
no connexion with the Arabs, others affirming the contrary. A very
sagacious person, the Aguid Ahmed, related to me, that when the
Tartars had driven the Abbaside family from Bagdad, the kaliphate
was removed to Egypt, and remained there until the Turks and the
Mamlouks drove them out; that is to say, until the time of the
Fatamites. The children of the Abbaside kaliphs, after the
overthrow of their dynasty, were dispersed, and sought refuge in
various countries. One of them went to Sennaar, and thence passed
on to WadaÃ¯, where he settled among the Pagan inhabitants of Mount
Seloun.
[169]
He
fulfilled exactly the duties of his religion, praying, fasting, and
performing the zikr and reciting the Koran. The people, whose
friendship he had acquired, asked him why he did these things, and
he answered, it was to do homage to God. âAnd what is God?â said
they. âGod is he who created the heavens and the earth, the night
and the day, the sun, and the moon, and the stars, the trees and
the rivers; his hand governs all these things.â The people of
Seloun at length embraced Islamism, and Saleh, whom they called
Seleih, after having well-instructed them, caused himself to be
named the religious chief, and set about converting by arms, or
other means, the neighbouring tribes. The four tribes first
converted became, in some sort, the royal family of the country,
from which the mothers of the Sultan must necessarily be derived.
Such of the remaining peoples of WadaÃ¯ as accepted the new faith
with readiness were declared to be free; whilst those who only
yielded to force were reduced to slavery. In this way, according to
this informant, was the dynasty of Seleih founded.

Other persons told me that the Sultans of WadaÃ¯, Darfur, and
Kordofal, were all descended from one father, who belonged to the
Arab tribe called Fezarah; but as all these recitals are founded on
mere oral traditions, God only knows the truth. For my part, I am
inclined to believe the account which derives the great Seleih from
the Abbasides, on account of the elevation of his character,
the
[170]
nobility of his
mind, his piety, and his goodness. If he had preceded Hatim Tai by
a day, Hatim would never have been chosen as the type of generosity
in Arab poetry. How different is the paltry conduct and the
poltroonery of the Forians from the valour and the easy hospitality
of the WadaÃ¯ans! The differences of the qualities of the two
nations are sufficient to prove the different origin of their
Sultans; for a people is, in some sort, the creation of its
governors. At any rate, one thing is certain, that the three states
of WadaÃ¯, Darfur, and Kordofal, are of recent establishment, not
exceeding in age two hundred years.

An old man of Senoun once related to me that Salou Selman,
sultan of Darfur, and Seleih, sultan of WadaÃ¯, once met in the
uninhabited space which separates the two countries, and there
engaged, by oath, to live in peace one with the other. They
measured the space between the cultivated land, and drew a line
exactly in the centre, which they marked by very long and thick
iron nails, driven into the trunks of the largest trees. They
engaged reciprocally not to overpass this line with hostile
intentions, and called God and man to witness what they promised.
When I was travelling from Darfur to WadaÃ¯, indeed, I saw in the
midst of the forest, at the place where we met so great a number of
rabbits and wild beasts, a line of trees, in each of which a bar of
iron was stuck, advancing about a span. Each nail appeared to me
about a cubit and a half
[171]
long. The points did not stick out
straight, but were beaten down, to prevent any accidental injuries
to passers-by. The Fakih Ahmed told me at that time that this was
the ancient boundary-mark of WadaÃ¯ and Darfur.

After the death of the two wise Sultans, their children, as is
the custom with princes, began to cast covetous eyes on their
neighbourâs property. He of WadaÃ¯ invaded Darfur, but was defeated
with great loss, and under the next reign the Forians penetrated
into WadaÃ¯. The war that followed was most terrible, and in one of
the battles the Forian Sultan himself was slain. The whole of this
struggle reminds me of the war of Basous. The corpses of those who
fell were devoured by birds of prey and by lions, or buried in huge
pits.

One of the incidents related in connexion with this war is
curious. The Sultan of WadaÃ¯, Gaudeh, pretending to fly, had
marched round in the rear of the Forian army, and interposed
between them and their country. They believed, however, that he was
utterly routed, and loudly expressed their joy. One vizier,
however, remained silent, and on being asked by his master why he
did not share in the general joy, replied that he did not believe
in this easy victory, and offered to prove that the enemyâs army
was even then marching towards them.

âHow wilt thou do this?â said the Sultan.

âBring me a she-camel,â replied the vizier, âwith a man who
knows how to milk.â

[172]
The camel was
brought, and well washed, and the milk was drawn into a clean bowl,
and placed, with a man to guard it, on the top of the Sultanâs
tent. Next morning the vizier caused the bowl to be brought to him,
and found the milk quite black. So he went to the Sultan and
said,â

âMaster, they are coming down upon us, and have marched all
night.â

âHow dost thou know that?â

âLook at this blackened milk.â

âIn what way has it become black?â

âThe dust raised by the feet of the horses has been carried
hither by the wind.â

Some laughed at this explanation, but others believed, and
looked out anxiously towards the west. In a short time, however,
the manes of the hostile cavalry were seen shaking above the
eastern horizon. Then followed the battle, in which the Forian
Sultan was slain.

The grandson of the conqueror on this occasion was Mohammed
Abd-el-Kerim, surnamed Saboun, who reigned at the time of my
arrival. His father had two other sons, named Ahmed and Asyl, by
another wife, who was his favourite, while the mother of Saboun and
her child were treated with indifference. However, when Saboun grew
up, his intelligence gave him great influence in the government,
though his half-brothers enjoyed all the royal favour and care.

Saboun early created for himself numerous partisans,
[173]
for he felt that he would have
to dispute the throne by arms. Instead of wasting his time in
sensual pleasures, he employed himself in study, in prayer, and,
above all, in collecting arms, coats of mail, horses, and men. On
one occasion he met some Magrebyn merchants armed with guns, and
learned from them the use of them. From that day forward he bought
all the fire-arms that came in his way, and made a large body of
slaves study their use under the Magrebyn merchants.

These preparations alarmed the viziers, who went to Seleih, and
represented to him that his son was making ready for an open
revolt. He accordingly ordered Saboun to be brought before him, and
one of the chiefs of the Turguenaks was sent to arrest him. These
Turguenaks, who are also called Osban, are the instruments of the
anger of the Sultan, and are always employed to effect important
arrests. It happened that Saboun was sitting on his Tirgeh, a kind
of platform, on a mound of earth, raised within the great enclosure
of a palace. He descried the Turguenaks from afar off, and,
collecting his people in time, prepared for resistance. It was,
therefore, impossible to arrest him, and sufficient time was given
for the anger of the Sultan to die away. He took counsel of his
Ulemas, and other wise people, and the result was that Sabounâs
innocence was made manifest, and he was suffered to live in
quiet.

Some months after this event the Sultan fell
[174]
seriously ill. His chief wife,
who had borne no children, fearing that the throne would fall to
Ahmed or Asyl, who had not the high qualities of Saboun, and who
would certainly have deprived her of her title of queen, or,
perhaps, put her to death, sent a secret messenger to the heir,
announcing that his father was ill. He immediately collected his
partisans in the villages in the neighbourhood of Warah, which word
corresponds to the Fasher of the Forians, and waited for the event.
When the Sultan died, the queen despatched a messenger to Saboun,
telling him, that unless he acted that very night all would be
lost, and that he must appear before the gates of the palace two
hours after sunset. The sagacious prince collected his force
accordingly, and appeared at the appointed time at the Warah. The
great difficulty was to force the Iron Gate, which is the fourth of
the seven gates. But, by a stratagem, the Fakih Mousa had obtained
admission, and was ready to open. The guards were asleep. Saboun,
with a few of his friends, advanced with naked feet on tip-toe
until he reached the fourth gate; his signal was understood, and
Mousa, who had won the confidence of the porter, and had taken the
key, immediately went and opened.

âFor whom dost thou undo the gate at night?â said the
porter.

Mousa did not reply, and Saboun passed silently with his troop.
The Fakih then seized a lance
[175]
which belonged to the porter, who was half
asleep, and said to him,â

âDost thou know for whom I have opened the door?â

âNo.â

âFor thy masterâthe master of thy mother and thy father.â

So saying, Mousa stabbed the porter, and then, falling upon the
guard, struck right and left, and killed fifteen of them. Saboun
had collected a considerable force without, and about five hundred
men entered after him and joined Mousa in the carnage. The people
of the palace, on waking up, met with lance-thrusts hotter than
burning coals. Some defended themselves desperately to the death,
whilst others submitted. By the blessing of God some huts took
fire, so that the Prince Saboun was enabled easily to recognise his
enemies and make a horrible massacre of them. The guards of the
palace came running forth to escape from the flames, and a great
number were put to the sword. Without this conflagration to light
up the carnage, Saboun might have been struck by a traitor-hand and
have perished.

When the prince, by these means, saw that he was master of the
palace, and delivered from all danger, he entered the chamber where
were laid out the remains of his father. The corpse was decorated
and adorned, and surrounded with the women of the harem. Saboun
shed some tears, and said, âMay
[176]
God set to my account in heaven the
misfortune that has befallen meâthe death of my father!â Having
made this pious observation,
[27]
he demanded the insignia
of the Sultanship, that is to say, the imperial sealâa heirloom
transmitted from sovereign to sovereignâthe imperial sabre, the
amulet, and the throne or seat of the Sultan. Very shortly all
these objects were brought, except the seat, which the women, being
hostile to the turn things had taken, would not at first give up.
However, by threats and promises, Saboun succeeded in obtaining
this precious article.

Meanwhile the combat continued without, and grew hotter and
hotter. The Turguenaks, by this time being wide awake, attacked the
soldiers of Saboun, who fell upon them with fury. The viziers of
the opposite party came up, but were repulsed. The fight lasted the
whole night, when the people of Saboun, having the upper hand, were
joined by the vacillating, and tranquillity was at length
restored.

The Princes Ahmed and Asyl, who had been journeying through the
provinces, wantonly oppressing the people, came up next day at the
head of an army, but were defeated and put to flight. Saboun
thereupon gave thanks to God for his victory, and,
[177]
appearing in the divan, caused
himself to be recognised as chief of the state. He distributed all
the important offices to his relations, and the whole of WadaÃ¯
submitted to him, partly from affection and partly from fear.
[28]

The rout of Ahmed and his partisans stifled the expression of
malevolence. The number of the dead was considerable, and blood had
flowed in abundance. A poet has well said, âMen of great power
cannot escape from danger unless they surround themselves with an
ocean of blood.â

This event happened towards the middle of the month of Rejeb, I
believe, 1219 of the Hegira (
A.D.
1804).
Saboun remained in peace for nearly two months, after which he
marched against his brother Ahmed, who, having escaped from the
carnage of Warah, had succeeded in collecting a respectable army.
The Sultan feared that, if he did not act with vigour, many tribes
might revolt, and thus produce great disasters. He accordingly
marched a whole night and a whole day without pausing, and came in
presence of his brotherâs army. The partisans of Ahmed had spread
the report that Saleh was not dead, and that Saboun must be
considered to be in a state of revolt against him. The wise Sultan,
before beginning hostilities,
[178]
sent a messenger to the hostile viziers,
challenging them to produce the old king, and offering, if they did
so, to fall at his feet. The only answer made consisted of violent
words; upon which Saboun performed his ablutions, uttered his
prayers, and, in presence of his army, demanded of God to assist
him in triumphing over his enemies.

The battle began. In the twinkling of an eye, swifter than the
flight of the falcon on its prey, swifter than lightning, Saboun
rushed upon his enemies, who were at once thrown into disorder, and
took to flight. A proclamation was at once issued, offering a
generous reward to whoever should bring him his brother prisoner.
In consequence, Ahmed was brought in before the setting of the sun,
overwhelmed with shame and despair. By order of Saboun, he and all
his relations were laden with irons, and thus attended the
victorious prince returned to Warah, where he passed a comfortable
night, rejoicing in his success.

Next morning the tambourines were beaten, and the troops were
assembled. The crowd gathered together and filled the court in
front of the palace. The Sultan appeared; the standards were waving
around him; over his head spread the parasol; and the great fans of
ostrich feathers gently stirred the air. Every emir took his place;
every functionary of the state occupied the position reserved for
him. The interpreters unfolded their line, and the Osban stood
around, clothed in the insignia of
[179]
vengeance and of terror. The Sultan ordered
Ahmed, and all those who had taken part with him, to be brought
forth. These wretched men advanced in the most pitiable plight,
with short, stumbling steps, for they had irons on their hands and
their feet. When they were set out in order Saboun addressed his
brother, and said to him:â

âDebauched scoundrel that thou art, traitor, libertine,
impostor, adulterer, oppressor, contemptible tyrant, brutal despot!
dost thou think that a being such as thou art is capable of acting
as sovereign chief and councillor, of governing men, and dispensing
justice? No! insensate was thy presumption; detestable were thy
thoughts. Thou capable of guiding the servants of the sovereign of
worlds! thou art not even fit to keep sheep.â He then proceeded to
accuse his brother of various acts of tyranny, of dishonouring
modest women, and of spilling blood, of overpassing the bounds set
by God, of trampling on all that was sacred, and concluded by
challenging him to disprove these charges.

Ahmed, with a bold, firm, and resolute voice, replied,ââHold thy
peace! May God split thy mouth and confound thee, coward, rebel to
thy father, excommunicated from the pity of God! Certainly chance
has made a sad mistake in giving sovereign power to thee; but the
mistake will be repaired, let us hope. Dost thou think that I fear
the savage treatment thou art preparing for me? Do I not know that
the utmost of thy power is to say, âLet him
[180]
be killed?â Go; to die is better than to
be in the presence of a being so vile as thou art.â The Sultan then
addressed the Ulemas and the doctors of the law, and said to them:
âWhat is the judgment which the code of Islam pronounces against
this rebel?â They answered that he must be put to death, or have a
hand and a foot cut off. The text of the words of God is as
follows:ââHe who revolts against the Creator and his
representative, and shall spread disorder and rebellion in a
country, shall die a violent death, shall be hanged, or shall have
a hand and a foot cut off, or
shall be exiled
.â
[29]

Upon this the Sultan ordered the Mirwed, or iron tongs, to be
heated, and applied to the eyes of his brother Ahmed, who, being
thus blinded, was thrown into a prison, where he remained to the
end of his life.

In the same sitting Saboun pronounced judgment on the captive
viziers, ordering them to be put to death by the kabartou, or
executioners. These kabartou accordingly surrounded the unhappy
men, and felled them with iron clubs. The viziers contended who
should meet death in the bravest manner, and vied who should first
present his head. They
[181]
feared to dishonour themselves by the
slightest act of timidity; for in WadaÃ¯ there is nothing so
contemptible as cowardice.

Having in this way got rid of the viziers who were related to
Ahmed, and having nothing to fear from their party, Saboun reigned
with justice and equity, and attracted the admiration of his
neighbours. Crowds came to contemplate him in his glory, just as of
old Pagan races used to throng the temples to behold some great
idol.
[30]

One of Sabounâs first cares was to destroy the terrible robbers
called Afrits, or devils. He thus ensured the safety of the roads,
so that during his reign a solitary woman, even covered with gold,
might venture into solitary places and have nothing to fear, except
from the Most High. But whilst the Sultan gave tranquillity to
others he remained himself disquieted. The thought that his brother
Asyl was abroad prevented him from taking rest, and embittered all
his pleasures. He waited impatiently until God should give him an
opportunity of freeing himself from fear. That nothing on his part,
however, might be wanting to effect this desirable result, he
invented a stratagem by which he decoyed Asyl from Darfur, where he
had taken refuge, and, having got him into his power, addressed him
in the same terms which he had used towards Ahmed, and
then
[182]
ordered him to
be put to death. Thus God delivered WadaÃ¯. That was a day of
rejoicing such as the country had never seen.
[31]

CHAPTER III.

The Sultan of Bagirmeh â A Court of Birds of Prey â
Saboun determines to make a War â March over the Desert â Encounter
with a Rhinoceros â Punishment of Cowardice â Veneration for
Sultans â A White Beard â The Crown purifies â Sultan Arous â

When
Sultan Saboun had
fixed himself firmly on the throne he repressed all evil actions,
and did all the good he could. I shall notice how he punished the
culpable conduct of Haj-Ahmed, sultan of Bagirmeh. This prince had
excessively tyrannised over his subjects, so that at length the
Ulemas were excited to present themselves before him and utter the
complaints of the nation. He received them graciously, and asked
what was their business. An old man replied, that they came to beg
him to cause his servants to cease from their excesses, and told a
parable of a great tree which grew in the midst of a field, and
harboured birds of prey that devoured the harvest. âThy subjects,â
he said, âare the harvest, thou art the great tree, and thy
officers the birds
[184]

of prey. We fear lest the tree be cut down; for the master of the
harvest is God, who hateth tyranny.â The good old man farther
quoted some wise saws and some verses from the poets, and also the
words of the Prophet, to the effect that an hour of justice is
worth seventy years of prayer.

When the sermon was concluded the Sultan burst out laughing, and
said, âDo you think that my birds, as you call them, can live
without eating or drinking? I tell you what. My subjects are my
subjects, my soldiers are my soldiers, and what they do is no
business of yours. It is your duty to teach law and religion to
those who are in want of these things. If it were not for your
sacred character I would put you all to death.â Then Ahmed called
his emirs, and said to one of them, âThou art a hawk;â to another,
âThou art a falcon;â to another, âThou art a kite;â to another,
âThou art a vulture.â In this way he applied to each of them the
name of a bird of prey in presence of the Ulemas, who were
stupified by this decision. They went away lamenting the perversity
of the Sultan, and the only result of their step was an increase of
oppression and iniquity. The people revolted in several places, but
were put down with fire and sword. The Ulemas again presented
themselves, and quoted a long list of sentences from the Koran; but
with as little success as before.

The Sultan of Bagirmeh, not content with these excesses, became
enamoured of his sister, who was married to one of his viziers. He
caused her to be
[185]

divorced, and took her to wife, in spite of the opposition of the
priests and the disgust of his people. Still greater turpitudes
were imputed to him.

About this time Ahmed authorised one of his great viziers to
make a wanton incursion on the territories of WadaÃ¯, for the sake
of collecting booty. This incursion being reported to Saboun,
induced him to write a letter of remonstrance to Ahmed, which
remained without any answer, except that a fresh attack was made.
Saboun wrote once more, and received at length a despatch
containing these words: âWe received thy first letter, and
afterwards thy second, and we understood their contents.
Salutations.â This derisive answer induced Saboun to determine to
make war upon Bagirmeh. He consulted my father, who gave it as his
opinion that war under such circumstances would be justifiable. The
preparations were made with the greatest secrecy, and Saboun left
Warah, under pretence of making an excursion through his provinces.
Some of the great men made opposition to this expedition, thus
suddenly planned; but a well-timed severity repressed discontent,
and a considerable army was rapidly collected on the confines of
WadaÃ¯.

When everything was ready, the Sultan gave orders to commence
the march through the wilderness that separates the boundaries of
WadaÃ¯ and Bagirmeh. It is covered with lofty trees and vast
expanses of shrubs. In these savannahs are the repairs of lions and
elephants, and of the abou-kern,
[186]
or unicorn, called in Egypt khartit, that
is to say, rhinoceros.
[32]
Saboun had sent people
ahead to cut down trees, and open for his troops a practicable
road. Six Aguids, each with four thousand slaves, formed the body
of pioneers, which preceded the main army by at least an hour.
These slaves were armed with hatchets, to cut down the trees and
clear the way. Whilst they were breaking through a thickset wood an
enormous abou-kern suddenly rushed upon the workmen, killed several
whom he first met, and then broke through the mass, slaying people
right and left. Every one fled, and the whole body of pioneers fell
back upon the army, which, soon being seized with a panic, took
flight in all directions. The Sultan soon found himself almost
alone, and beheld the abou-kern coming straight towards him.
âWhat!â cried he, âis there no one here that has the courage to
fight this ignoble animal?â Now it happened that there was a slave,
named Ajmain, tall, well-built, and vigorous, armed with buckler
and javelins. He threw aside his javelins, and stepped towards the
animal with his shield and a long knife. The Sultan looked on with
anxiety. Ajmain waited until the beast was near him, and then
suddenly fell and allowed it to pass
[187]
over him. With a dexterous stroke of his
knife, however, he succeeded in ham-stringing the abou-kern, which
rolled upon the ground. He then fetched his javelin, and before the
soldiers could come up he had rendered their assistance
unnecessary. Saboun ordered the corpse to be dragged to an open
place, and then calling together his men, pronounced an angry
speech against those who had been most distinguished by cowardice.
He ordered several of them to be seized and executed on the spot.
Among these was the governor of the Jeataneh Arabs, in whose place
he named the slave Ajmain. After this bloody scene, Saboun said to
his viziers and officers: âWhoever of you flies at the time of
combat, whatever may be the danger, shall be put to death.â All
humbly promised obedience. During the whole war, indeed, the effect
of these words was manifest; for in the eyes of the WadaÃ¯ans
obedience to the Sultan is a duty as sacred as obedience to God and
the Prophet. Indeed these people often neglect their duties of
piety, but never that which they think they owe to the Sultan.

I shall relate an anecdote of the extreme veneration in which
the Sultan is held. It happened under the reign of Gaudeh. The wife
of one of his officers saw the sovereign pass, surrounded by his
courtiers, and in imperial dress. Age had whitened the beard of the
prince. In the evening, having returned home, the woman relating to
her husband what she had seen, said: âThe procession was
fine,
[188]
the Sultan
was fine: what a pity it is that his beard is growing white on both
sides of his face! May God prolong the days of our master!â

Suddenly the husband fell upon his wife with violent blows,
saying:ââAh! dost thou say that the beard on both sides of our
Sultanâs face is beginning to whiten? If any one heard thee,
respect for him would be gone. People would say that he is no
longer fit to go into battle.â

Having well beat her, he bound her, and left her in that spot
till the morning, when he presented himself before the Sultan, and
having related the adventure, added:ââI have left her there,
accursed woman that she is, bound hand and foot! Now, prince, order
what I shall do with her.â

The Sultan praised the officer for his good intentions, and
presented him with a garment; but he recommended him to forgive his
wife this one time, on condition that she should behave better for
the future.

The veneration of the WadaÃ¯ans is encouraged by the Sultan, who
loves to be addressed with hyperbolical phrases and with
extravagant testimonies of respect. The people are persuaded that
whoever is raised to be Sultan of WadaÃ¯ immediately is illuminated
by God, becomes wise, is clothed with sanctity, even though before
his elevation he has given no sign of these things, and has lived
in debauchery and vice. The crown and sceptre are supposed to
purify. This belief is said to have arisen in the time of the
Sultan Arous, who had forbidden his
[189]
name to be pronounced by any person, either
in his presence or out of it. In order to find out whether any one
infringed his order, he sent forth spies on all sidesâold women,
children, youthsâwho were ordered to denounce all delinquents. One
day an officer of the police, made uneasy by this strange order,
went up to the top of a mountain where was a cavern, into which he
penetrated, and said in a low voice:ââThe Sultan Arous! the Sultan
Arous! the Sultan Arous!â He believed it impossible that he should
be overheard by any one; but, by a singular fatality, one of the
spies had followed him unseen, and overheard his words. Next day,
accordingly, the officer was called before Arous, who said to
him,â

âHave I not forbidden thee, as well as others, to pronounce my
name?â

âIt is true.â

âAnd wherefore hast thou done so?â

âPrince, I have not disobeyed.â

âWilt thou swear to me that thou hast not done so?â

âI swear it.â

âLiar! thou didst go yesterday upon the mountain, and entered a
cavern and pronounced my name three times.â

Upon this the officer was forced to admit the truth, and all
present united in proclaiming that the Sultan was a seer.

When Saboun had crossed the frontiers of Bagirmeh, he took the
necessary steps to prevent the
[190]
people from suffering much from the
invasion. Whenever he approached a village, he sent for the Ulemas
and principal personages, and spoke to them with benevolence, and
gave them presents. At all holy places he gave alms. He also
prevented his soldiers from acting violently against the peasants.
Thus most people prayed that victory should be awarded him. He
traversed the country without opposition, and soon arrived near the
Birny, or capital. A first battle was gained by the intrepidity of
Ajmain and other generals, and the city and the palace were soon
taken. The conflict, however, was desperate, and the spectacle of
the frightful carnage that took place was sufficient to whiten the
hair on the head of an infant. The city was sacked, in spite of the
orders of Saboun. An immense booty was obtained; among other
things, a large chamber was found filled with leathern sacks full
of silver dollars. The soldiers of WadaÃ¯ did not know the value of
this money, and changed away whole handfuls for a pound of tobacco.
The number of slaves taken was so great that the price of them fell
almost to nothing.

The Sultan Ahmed fell in this assault, but it was some time
before his body was found. Saboun was principally anxious on this
account, and calm did not enter his heart until the corpse of an
old meagre man was dragged forth and recognised by the women. In
the meanwhile, the Fecha
[33]
of Bagirmeh was
infesting
[191]
the roads
towards Bornou, and Saboun was obliged to send a body of troops
against him. He retired to Logou, the capital of Katakau. After
this my father asked permission of Saboun to go to Bornou, and,
obtaining it, departed with his wife, who was a sister of the
Sultan, and his slaves. He was soon attacked by the soldiers of the
Fecha, and robbed of all he possessed. But the Sultan of Logou,
fearing to be invaded by Saboun, caused everything to be restored
to him.

Saboun now prepared to return to WadaÃ¯. At the commencement of
his march, it must be noticed, an officer had endeavoured to
persuade him not to go to Bagirmeh, predicting defeat. The Sultan
had ordered this man to be tied to a tree, with his legs round the
trunk, and had set guards over him to give him to eat and drink,
until the return of the army. On reaching the spot again, Saboun
passed the night there, and in the morning ordered the officer to
be untied and brought before him. âKnow,â said he, âthat God has
proved thy prophecies to be fallacious, and has given me the
victory over mine enemies.â Then he ordered the wretched man to be
executed, and returned to his country.

Before leaving Bagirmeh, Saboun had placed upon the throne one
of the younger sons of the former Sultan. But the WadaÃ¯an army had
no sooner departed than Chigama, the eldest son, who had fled, came
back with the Fecha and dethroned the young prince, and, throwing
him into prison, caused him to
[192]
be starved to death. This led to a new war.
Ajmain was sent once more to reduce the country. Chigama was made
prisoner; but at last was made Sultan by Saboun himself, and
reigned successfully.

Some time afterwards Saboun undertook an expedition against
Dar-Tamah. His army was at first repulsed; but on a second attack
the mountain was taken, and the whole of the population put to the
sword. My father, with a little troop consisting of twenty-two
Magrebyns, armed with guns, was of great use in this action. The
Sultan of Darfur was angry at this aggression; but took no
effectual means to protect his vassal of Tamah, who finally agreed
to pay tribute to WadaÃ¯. Having finished his wars, Saboun busied
himself with the internal affairs of his country, and did all he
could to make them prosper. One day there was presented to him a
Magrebyn, belonging to the Bedawins dependent on the regency of
Tripoli; he was accompanied by several members of the tribe of
Bidegat, a non-Arab tribe established to the north of WadaÃ¯, who
related that this Bedawin had lost his way in the sands, and had
been found by them dying of thirst. They had given him water to
drink, and having kept and fed him for a month, had brought him to
Warah to present him to the Sultan.

Saboun said to the strange Bedawin, âFrom whence dost thou
come?â

âI belong,â he replied, âto the Wallad-Ali, a tribe neighbouring
to Barca. We started about
[193]
fifty Arab horsemen in the direction of
Soudan, hoping to make a profitable excursion. We lost our road,
and at length our supply of water was exhausted. Three of us, of
which I was one, went out in search of a well. I missed my two
companions, and wandered I knew not whither. At length my horse
broke down, and I abandoned it and proceeded on foot during three
whole days. On the fourth the heat overcame me; I was dying of
thirst; and if God had not sent me these men I should have
perished.â

âHow many days didst thou remain without tasting water?â
inquired the Sultan.

âSix days without a single drop.â

These words astonished the audience, and some believed, whilst
others disbelieved.

It was about this time that I came to WadaÃ¯, for the Sultan of
Darfur had delivered me from my prison, and I often saw this
Bedawin, who was named Ali. He related to me his adventures,
without contradicting himself once. Saboun made him many presents,
and placed under his orders ten slaves, that they might learn the
use of fire-arms. But Ali used often to say,ââIf the Sultan,
instead of making me teach his slaves how to shoot, would confide
to me a caravan, and allow me to return to my tribe by the direct
road, a great advantage would result to the king and to the
country.â

These words were reported to the Sultan, who called Ali before
him, and asked if it were true that
[194]
he had spoken of a caravan road. He replied
that it was, but that he feared to go by it because of the robbers
he might meet at the outset of the journey. The Sultan then sent
for the Chief of Bidegat, and said to him: âPrepare a caravan with
the necessary men and provisions, and go with this Bedawin until he
says, âI know the place where we are,â and proves the truth of his
words.â

The chief Bidegat accordingly departed with Ali and about twenty
men on camel-back, and penetrating into the desert, made forced
marches for fifteen days. At length Ali cried out, âGood news!
there are the palm-trees of Jalou.â

âAnd how dost thou know that this is Jalou?â

âIn this way. During our expedition we halted at this place, and
passed the night there, tying our horses in one direction, and
making a fire in another.â

Ali pointed out these two spots, and convinced the Bidegat that
what he said was true. They returned, therefore, to the Sultan
Saboun, and related the result of their journey. He asked them to
what distance they had penetrated, and they said, âTo reach the
place where we halted would require, with camels and slaves, forty
days, but in a forced march it might be done in twenty-five.â

The Sultan ordered a caravan to be prepared immediately, and
caused it to be proclaimed at Hejeir and at Noumro, that whoever
desired to undertake a commercial expedition to the Magreb, as far
as Derna
[195]
and
Bengazi, should prepare to start with the caravan. He put the
expedition under the charge of the Bidegat as far as Jalou, and Ali
guided it during the rest of the journey. It arrived safely at its
destination and returned. Next year Saboun despatched a second
caravan, under the command of the Shereef Ahmed-el-Fasi, that is to
say, of Fas or Fez, who had succeeded my father in the functions of
Vizier. This Ahmed was remarkable for his instruction, his memory,
and his literary erudition; he was a profound jurisconsult, and
versed in the sacred traditions; he had some knowledge of anatomy,
and even gave lectures on that science. I was present at one of his
demonstrations on the construction of the eye, and he acquitted
himself in a remarkable manner. God had endowed him with wonderful
talents, but he was irascible, and disposed to hate. In the end he
alienated all people from him, and became so odious that he was
assassinated.

From time immemorial the caravans of WadaÃ¯ had been accustomed
to proceed to Fezzan with slaves, and to bring back various kinds
of merchandise. But Saboun was delighted when the Bidegat had
opened a new route to the Magreb. The fact was, that he was angry
with El-Mountaser, sultan of Fezzan, because when my father went to
Tripoli with merchandise on account of Saboun, El-Mountaser wished
to put him to death. Had it not been for the great distance that
separates WadaÃ¯ from Fezzan, and the arid and waterless deserts
which it would
[196]
have
been necessary to traverse, Saboun would have declared war against
Mountaser. This is the reason that he was delighted at the
discovery of the road of Jalou, by which he could send his caravans
direct to Barbary.

I shall relate in a few words the circumstances that indisposed
El-Mountaser against my father. When he had resolved to quit WadaÃ¯,
and go to Tunis, he spoke of his project to Saboun, and begged him
to allow him to depart. Upon this the Sultan asked my father,â

âAfter Fezzan, what country comes?â

âThe regency of Tripoli.â

âThe price of slaves, then, must be higher there than in Fezzan,
and merchandise must be cheaper?â

âDoubtless.â

âShall I send with thee one of my faithful servants, a man who
is devoted to me, and who will take with him slaves, whom thou
shalt sell at Tripoli on my account? From the price of the sale
thou shalt buy for me such and such merchandise.â

âWillingly, prince.â

Then the Sultan chose one of his faithful servants, and confided
to him about three hundred slaves, enjoining him to obey my father
in all things. The caravan arrived safely at Fezzan, Mountaser
hailed its arrival with joy, for the greatest part of his revenue
was derived from taxes upon trade. The merchants who accompanied my
father sold their slaves at the capital, Mourzouk; but the agent
of
[197]
Saboun refused
to sell. Mountaser being informed of this circumstance, called my
father before him and said,â

âIt is thou who hast determined Saboun to send slaves to
Tripoli, instead of having them sold here.â

âIt was not I who counselled Saboun. He learned that slaves were
dearer at Tripoli than Mourzouk, and therefore chose that
market.â

âThis is not the custom of Saboun,â replied Mountaser; âand the
counsel comes from thee.â

These words were pronounced with anger, and my father feared
that he would be arrested and put to death; but he was let off,
after giving a present of six of his finest slaves, and arrived
safely at Tripoli. This extortion, however, irritated the Pacha of
that regency so much, that he swore to destroy Mountaser, who
accordingly was soon violently dispossessed, and replaced by
Mohammed El-Moknee.
[34]

To return to Saboun. When the road of Aujilah was discovered, he
habitually sent his caravans by that route. In other cases he
despatched them by way of Egypt, and thence to Jalou, and thence to
Bengazi; for, by the way of Egypt, the road to
[198]
Bengazi is shorter than by the way of
Tripoli. Saboun learned that his caravans easily traversed Egypt,
and that that country was governed by a just and renowned prince.
He accordingly sent letters and presents to the Pacha, asking for
his friendship; and Ibrahim, son of the Viceroy, returned presents
and a favourable answer, borne by two persons of his suite and a
Kawas. The Zaghawy of Darfur learned that the Egyptian caravan was
to pass near them, and that it was not in strength sufficient to
defend itself. They accordingly attacked and pillaged it, but the
Kawas escaped and carried the letter to Saboun, who received him
well and sent him back with presents, under escort of a caravan.
But the Zaghawy again attacked and destroyed, or made prisoners,
the whole. It was this that led to the conquest of Kordofal by the
Egyptians.

The Sultan Saboun, who had also sent an expedition to chastise
the Zaghawy, now fitted out an immense caravan for the Magreb. The
Shereef Ahmed El-Fasi went with it, bearing considerable riches. It
was ordered to take the route by way of Aujalou, and was protected
in the early part of its course by a strong escort. Then it entered
the desert, and wandered from the track. The supply of water was
rapidly spent, and it became so rare, that a single draught was
sold for seventy dollars (14
l
.). Many camels were killed,
and the water within them was also sold at a high priceâat least so
I am assured by the Marabout Omar of Mesratta, and other
of
[199]
the travellers.
Many slaves and members of the caravan died of thirst.

The Shereef El-Fasi had an abundant supply of water. His
companions asked him for some to save them from perishing, but he
refused. âI am,â said he, âthe head of a numerous family; this
water is my salvation and theirs. I have young children, and must
preserve myself for them. If they die by my fault, I shall have to
answer for it at the day of judgment. I will not be the artisan of
their misfortune.âââSell us water,â cried they, âat any price you
may name. We will give the acknowledgment, and pay exactly on our
arrival.â The Shereef remained inflexible.

But the sufferings of thirst became more and more intense. The
caravan saw that there was another means of salvation. They came in
great crowds to the Shereef, and said to him,ââThou must at once
give us water, or we will take it by force. It is not just, even in
the eyes of God, that thou shouldst have an abundant supply whilst
we are dying of thirst.â The Shereef persisted in his refusal, so
they burst into his tents, and distributed his water equally,
leaving him only his exact share. His numerous slaves, therefore,
soon began to suffer from thirst, and the greater part perished.
The Shereef himself, however, with his children and three camels,
contrived to push on to Jalou, and escape. From this place he, and
the rest of the caravan, returned with hired camels to where
they
[200]
had been
obliged to abandon their wealth, their bales of gum, their
elephantsâ teeth, and their ostrich feathers. The whole was
transported to Bengazi and sold. But the Shereef Ahmed obtained an
opinion from the Ulemas of Tripoli, that the caravan was
responsible for all his losses. When he returned, therefore, to
WadaÃ¯ with this opinion, and was restored to the viziership, he
persecuted all his travelling companions, and cast them into prison
and spoiled them, so that he obtained many times the value of what
he had lost. For this conduct, however, he was punished after the
death of Saboun; for the people, irritated by his tyranny, rose
against him at Noumro, and killed him, and burnt his body, and cast
the ashes to the wind.

It was from the Grand Kadi of WadaÃ¯, who passed through Cairo in
the year 1257 (
A.D.
1841), that I got
information about the death of Saboun, and the events which
followed. It appears that the Sultan went out after dark,

incognito
, on a visit to his mother, who lived in a village
about a quarter of an hour from Warah. He remained some hours, and
returned on horseback. As he advanced, he saw two robbers driving
away a cow, and riding upon them, frightened them away. He told two
slaves who were with him to seize the animal, and went in pursuit
of the thieves, who separated, one flying to the right and the
other to the left. Saboun followed closely at the heels of one of
them, who, finding he could not escape, turned fiercely
round,
[201]
and
exclaimed,ââWhat wouldst thou with me? I have abandoned my
prey.âââI want to seize thee.âââTake my advice, and go back.â
Saboun paid no attention to these words, and rushed upon the
robber, who cast a javelin at him, and inflicted a mortal wound.
The slaves led him back to the palace, where he died in three
days.

After him reigned first his son, named Abd-el-Kader, and then
another son, named Kharifein, who so provoked the people by his
tyranny, that he was murdered. To him succeeded his young son,
named Rechib, chosen by the conspirators. But he soon died of the
small-pox, and, being buried secretly, was replaced by a boy, who
was instructed how to play his part. After another short reign, a
younger brother of Saboun, with the assistance of a Darfur army,
succeeded in placing himself on the throne of WadaÃ¯, where he now
reigns. A quarrel which arose with his allies was the cause that
the pilgrim caravan of WadaÃ¯, instead of passing through Darfur as
usual, went by way of Aujalou to Egypt. But let us here check our
pen, which hurries too far and fast over these historical events.
Lengthy details engender weariness; God and the Prophet know what
has been and what shall be.

[202]
CHAPTER IV.

Beauty of WadaÃ¯ â Compliments to its Fertility â
Comparison with Darfur â The two Capitals â Contracted Characters
of Fadhl and Saboun â Inhabitants of WadaÃ¯ â Beautiful Women of the
Koukah â The Goran â White and Black Women â Government of WadaÃ¯ â
Language â Recent Civilisation of WadaÃ¯ â Punishment of Adultery â
A Bornouese Army â Love of Peace â The Fasher of Warah â The Osban
Guard â Gates of the Palace â The Town.

The
sovereigns and the
peoples of Soudan look upon the establishment of the kingdom of the
descendants of Seleih, or, in other words, the kingdom of WadaÃ¯, as
a most wonderful and memorable event. Their country, indeed, seems
to be a rose amidst other flowersâa large garden in which streams
wander, so bountiful has Providence been to it of its blessings. On
all sides pure and limpid waters of argentine transparency, and
gardens filled with brilliant flowers, are to be seen. On the banks
of the rivulets the arrak weaves its branches into thick hedges,
where the nightingale trills its song, rejoicing the heart and
charming the soul.

[203]
WadaÃ¯ is broader
than Darfur, but not so long. Its territory is much more generous.
There is the same difference between them as between to-day and
yesterday, between the sun and the moon, between a garden and a
desert, between paradise and the great fire. There are, it is true,
some few places in Darfur the soil of which something resembles
that of WadaÃ¯, but the greater part of the former country is sandy,
and almost deprived of water. The Forians, therefore, who inhabit
these deserts are puny, thin, and have a yellow tint in their
complexion; they are, so to speak, always thirsty, and are
compelled to portion out water as if they were in a ship that has
lost its reckoning at sea. But in WadaÃ¯, nearly everywhere there
are springs of living water; nearly everywhere there are leafy
trees filled with the songs of birds. From the province of Saba on
the east, to the river which forms the extreme boundary of the
kingdom on the west, there is no place where it is necessary to
take in a supply of water. At each village, during the twenty-two
days which the Traject requires, there are wells, and streams, and
trees, and fields. The country is nearly everywhere thickly
peopled; and one village gives more profit than ten villages of the
neighbouring country. Compared to WadaÃ¯, Darfur may be said to be
ruined. The same distance separates them as separates the Pleiades
from the earth. Whoever would depreciate WadaÃ¯ would act like the
legitimate wives of a harem, who look upon a beautiful concubine
just
[204]
introduced,
and exclaim in their jealousy and bitter hatred,ââHow ugly she
is!â

The people of WadaÃ¯, although less civilised than the Forians,
are of a more generous nature and a more hospitable character. All
the princes of Soudan admit that the administration of no country
is so well organised. The capital, Warah, is wonderfully situated
and laid out; it is shut in by mountains, so well disposed that
there are only two approaches, one of which could be defended by
ten men and the other by two. The soil of its territory is
excellent, neither too hard nor too sandy, whilst that around
Tendelty reminds one of the plains of Arabia, the foot of the
traveller sinking in, whilst dusty whirlwinds constantly arise. At
Warah the dwellings are better constructed than at Tendelty. At the
latter place both enclosures and houses are made of millet-stalks,
except that the Sultan has two little brick warehouses where his
most precious garments and weapons are kept, to preserve them from
fire. But at Warah most houses, with their enclosures, are of
masonry, and the palace of the Sultan is composed of a number of
pavilions with solid walls, and bow-windows with trellis-work. A
kind of rampart, instead of a hedge of thorns, surrounds it, as the
halo surrounds the moon.

In Darfur there are no lands that are worth those of WadaÃ¯,
except in the western provinces. But all the districts of the
latter country are rich
[205]
and fertile, and well-peopled. In Darfur
most of the villages are nearly devastated by the violence and
tyranny of the governors. The few places that are well inhabited
are those whose chiefs have sufficient power to excite fear.
Beyond, all is desolation. The sufferings of the people, when I was
there, were extreme. Mohammed Fadhl was yet young; he passed his
time in pleasure, in riding, in drinking, and with women. His
governors overwhelmed the people; every one feared to possess
wealth; there were no longer any ranks or classes; the lowest kind
of people were promoted to the greatest honours, slaves became
viziers, the most respectable and revered men became
humiliated.

Meanwhile the affairs of WadaÃ¯ prospered under the hand of
Sultan Mohammed Abd-el-Kerim Saboun. His justice and beneficence
spread over all; under his reign no one had to complain of
injustice or misery. He gave the bow to the bowman, the house to
the mason, to every one his place and his duty. He maintained
Divine law in honour. His equity penetrated to the most distant
part of the kingdom. He was loved by all, except by the wicked,
whose hearts were sick and whose souls were tainted and jealous.
Wherefore did destiny transform these joys into grief and sorrow?
As a dog seizes on its prey, it seized upon this prince in the full
vigour of youth. Too soon was the cup of misfortune poured out
for
[206]
those who loved
him. Everywhere had his arms triumphed. Everywhere he drenched his
enemies in the bitterness of death and desolation. He subjected
Bagirmeh, the dwelling of disorder and crime. He ruined Tamah, the
den of vice and irreligion. He shook the joints of the Forians and
their Sultan by the terror of his arms, and they feared that the
time of their expulsion was come. Saboun died in the year 1226
(
A.D.
1811), after reigning only eight
years, having done more than other princes could have done in
eighty. He lived too little for his country. If his life had been
prolonged, he would have seized on Darfur and other provinces of
Soudan, and have brought back to those countries the beautiful age
of the youth of the universe. The days of his reign were days of
smiling festival; his anger was directed against evil, and he had
no joy but in goodness. Never did his subjects desire any other
master than he.
[35]

Let us now speak of the various inhabitants
[207]
of WadaÃ¯. The great tribes of Dar-Seleih
are the Massalit, the Mimeh, the Dajo, the Kashmereh, and the
Goran, or five primitive tribes; then come the Koukah, the
Jenakherah, and the Birguid. Each of these people inhabits a
particular country. The Massalit occupy the eastern province, and
have relations of interest, family, and origin, with the Massalit
of Darfur. They are of middle height and dark bronze colour, and
thickly cover a large plain country.

The WadaÃ¯ans, properly so called, or primitive inhabitants of
WadaÃ¯, occupy more especially the central portion of the kingdom.
It is amongst them that are chosen the viziers and the especial
troops of the Sultan. The country they inhabit is hilly, and there
is found Mount Absenoun. The people of this mountain consider
themselves as the original source of the WadaÃ¯ans, all of whom,
they say, are issued from them. Some leagues north of Senoun is
Mount Melangan. The Senawans are of a dark black colour, of
elevated stature, and strongly built, reminding one of the
redoubtable Amalekites. The Melangans are less dark, and have
something of a bronze tint.

The Kashmereh are established at four daysâ distance from Warah
to the south, in the Botagha, a charming, well-watered valley,
where they sow a great quantity of vegetables and plants which
serve as condiments, such as pepper, coriander, garlic, and onions.
The tribe has its dwellings
[208]
on the northern side of the valley, and is
spread over a surface of four days in length and of only four hours
in width. The villages are small, and extend along the crest of the
hill like the pearls of the necklace of a houri. Sultan Saboun had
given to my father the administration and the revenue of five of
these Kashmereh villages, which certainly were more profitable than
fifty Forian ones. All their stations are well peopled and full of
life. From the smallest of them, if the trumpet of war were
sounded, at least five hundred vigorous men would issue. I am
persuaded that this tribe alone would furnish an imposing army.
They are, moreover, submissive, and more easy to lead than the
other WadaÃ¯ans. They live in plenty, and their families have
numerous children. Their nature is simple and docile, without
meanness. They are of middle stature, and of a complexion between
white and black. Their language differs from that of the other
WadaÃ¯ans.

The Koukah are established to the south-east of WadaÃ¯, and form
three divisions. They are esteemed by the WadaÃ¯ans on account of
the slaves which are derived from them to serve as concubines.
There is especially one division which supplies magnificent women,
even preferable to the most attractive Abyssinians. The young
slave-girls which are brought from thence are ravishingly
beautiful, and endowed with grace that stirs all the emotions of
the heart. Their charms trouble
[209]
and torment the soul, turn the heads of the
most devout ascetics, and lure them to pleasure. The Koukah tribe
is numerous, and their country is well watered. According to the
WadaÃ¯ans, all the inhabitants of the Dar-Seleih may be bought and
sold, except the five original families.

The Goran inhabit the north of WadaÃ¯, spread in little stations,
each of which suffices for its wants. They are rich in flocks, in
horses, and in camels. The people are of small stature, and of a
clear brown colour, something resembling that of the Egyptians, so
that they seem not to be of Soudan origin. The women that I have
seen from that place appeared to me of remarkable beauty, but the
WadaÃ¯ans differ in opinion. They almost dislike the colour of the
Goran women, whom they consider to be too white, and they are sold
at a low price. In WadaÃ¯, the more an individual varies from the
black colour the more distant does he seem from the position of a
slave, but, at the same time, if there is any tendency to
whiteness, they are displeased. The clear mulatto complexion of the
Abyssinians is to them the type of the beautiful. A Tripoline
saddler once presented to Saboun two slaves, one white and the
other Abyssinian. The latter won the tenderness of the Sultan, but
the former he never approached, and she remained deserted in the
harem until her death.

I did not live long enough in WadaÃ¯ to be able to determine
perfectly the different natures of its
[210]
various people.
[36]

There are many other less important tribes spread here and there
throughout the country. The Birguids, who correspond to the tribe
of the same name in Darfur, are a treacherous, brutal
people,âblack, small, and slender. They occupy themselves
principally in the chace, and in working in iron. I must observe,
that nearly all the tribes that inhabit Darfur have corresponding
or sister tribes in WadaÃ¯.

All the frontiers of the country are surrounded with Arab
tribes,âgenerally rich in camels, horses, flocks, slaves, silver,
and coral. They are well furnished with arms, especially with
excellent lances. The narrow space between Darfur and WadaÃ¯ is left
unoccupied, because the Bedawins fear the extortions of the two
great countries by which they would be hemmed in. As I have said,
the Bidegat, though they live like Arabs, and feed principally on
camelsâ milk, are of negro origin.

All the peoples and tribes of WadaÃ¯ are governed by kings, to
whom the title of Sultan is never given. Indeed, the WadaÃ¯ans will
not admit that there exists in the whole world any other Sultan
than theirs. All the other Sultans, according to them,
[211]
are only Meliks. No one must
say to a WadaÃ¯an that there is a Sultan in his country, under pain
of being taken severely to task; and if any one of the country were
to use that expression he would most probably be insulted.
Nevertheless, in conversation, the people never say Sultan, but use
the word Melik, in speaking of their sovereign. The fact is, their
language does not contain the word Sultan. It is a poor, hard, and
rough dialect, in which the letter
k
constantly occurs.
The commonest syllable is
ak
, God is Kalak, and the same
word means a young child. Karak means a pious man, and also a
pumpkin. One day I heard a kabartou, or crier and public
executioner, blowing his trumpet, and singing his warlike song. I
asked what he was saying, and was told that his words meant âhungry
bird, come and eat;â that is to say, massacre your enemies, and may
the hungry birds feed to satiety upon their flesh. I did not,
however, remain long enough in the country to learn the language,
and, indeed, did not think it necessary to do so, many of them
speaking Arabic. I only knew what was necessary for ordinary
life,âthe names of water, of bread, of meat, household utensils,
clothes, &c.; but as for a long time I have not had occasion to
use these words, I forget them. Moreover, all the tribes of WadaÃ¯
have a particular language, each totally different from the
otherâas different as their physical characteristics. The WadaÃ¯ans,
in fact, have a large head, a long face, strong joints, and
elevated stature;
[212]

generally, the men are handsomer than the women. The Kashmereh have
an oval face, are of middle height, with joints not prominent. The
Birguid have small heads, slender bodies, short stature, and are in
general very black. The Koukah are mulatto-coloured, slight, and
active; the women are handsomer than the men. Each of these people,
therefore, has a physiognomy so distinct that it is recognised at
once. It is not long since the WadaÃ¯ans were almost savages. They
have only begun to be civilised for about half a century. Before
that period they were confined or shut up within their frontiers,
after the manner of the Chinese, allowing no one to go out, not
even strangers who came to visit them. They feared that some
foreign nation might be excited to attack and conquer their
country. If a stranger arrived he was well treated and fed, but
could never hope to depart. This custom was persisted in until the
time of Sultan Saleh, who was a man of intelligence and good sense,
fearing God and loving goodness. Under his reign some merchants
came to trade at WadaÃ¯, and were allowed to depart again. From that
time forth caravans began to arrive, and the movement continued
until Saboun came to the throne. Then the prosperity of the country
increased, and the reign of that prince was a series of blessings.
He gave presents to the merchants, to incite them to return to his
country. The news of his generosity spread far and wide, and
traders began to fall upon
[213]
Dar-Saleh like showers of fertilising rain.
Ulemas and poets came from distant countries to visit the prince.
His reign was beautiful as the spring, generous as the beneficent
dew. The only reproach that could be made against him was, that by
his hospitable treatment strangers were so fascinated that they
forgot all their other friends, and even their families. Saboun,
from his youth upwards, was a rigid observer of all the principles
consecrated by religion. No one could reproach him with neglect of
any duties. When he became Sultan he caused the law to be
respected, and applied it severely to all criminals, however high
placed. In no country have I seen, as in WadaÃ¯, the punishment
prescribed by the law inflicted for adultery. I have seen Saboun
condemn a woman for this crime. She was buried upright, up to her
breast, in the earth, and then stoned to death.
[37]

As for the use of wine, I have seen this crime as severely punished
in other countries as in WadaÃ¯.

The love of Saboun for science caused a great many learned men
to collect around him. The most distinguished was Ahmed-el-Fasi.
After him came the ImÃ¢m Nour, the great Kadi, who was an Arab
belonging to one of the neighbouring tribes. The Fakih Wali of
Bagirmeh was a distinguished poet,
[214]
and composed several copies of verses in
praise of the Sultan. Many other learned and able men were to be
found among the courtiers of Saboun.

I have already mentioned the courage which distinguishes the
people of WadaÃ¯, who surpass in valour most of the neighbouring
tribes. They are far more intrepid than the people of Bornou, which
is a country vaster and richer than theirs. I have often been told
that the Fullans, or Fellatahs, have conquered the Bornouese nearly
every time they have fought with them. When my father went from
Bagirmeh to Bornou, the Fellatahs had just gained a great victory
over that country, and its Sultan had fled away to the province of
Kanoum. Here the able vizier, Emin, received him, and, having
collected a large army, succeeded in replacing him on the imperial
throne.

On one occasion the Sultan of Bornou, about the time of the wars
of Zaky, sent an army, under the command of one of his viziers, to
meet the Fullans. There were with them some Magrebyn and Bedawin
Arabs. The Bornouese, during their march, entered a vast sandy
plain, which stretched farther than the eye could reach, and
perceived in the distance a great black mass, covering the whole
horizon. They imagined that this mass was the army of the
Fellatahs. Fear seized upon them, and chilled their souls. The head
of the column halted in consternation, and soon the whole warlike
array came to a full stop, and then began to retrograde, the
soldiers crying one to the
[215]
other that it was impossible to resist so
great a multitude. A Magrebyn went to the vizier in command, and
said,â

âWhat! do your troops disband at sight of that black mass,
without knowing what it really is?â

âWho,â said the Vizier, âwill go and reconnoitre?â

âI will.â

So the Magrebyn rode out alone across the plain, and soon
discovered that the supposed Fellatah army was nothing but an
immense herd of ostriches that were flapping their wings on the
horizon, and thus figured an army marching, with its banners
spread. The scout wheeled round, and returned shouting, âCome back,
Bornou; come back! They are only ostriches!â But the army, instead
of listening, continued its flight more rapidly, and arrived in
complete rout at the Birny of Kanoum, where was then the Sultan. It
was found necessary, therefore, to put all the chiefs to death, and
to threaten whoever again fled before the enemy should meet with
the same punishment. Thus incited, the army marched out under Emin,
defeated the Fullans, made a hideous massacre of them, and drove
them out of the country.

I explain the conduct of the Bornouese by their long habit of
easy and peaceful life. Wherever habits of repose and inertness
have prevailed in a state, the citizens learn to fear the fatigues
and dangers of war. They have passed their time amidst
[216]
physical enjoyment, rich
dishes, elegant clothing, valuable horses, beautiful women, and the
desire of the constant enjoyment of luxury has become imperative.
If unforeseen circumstances call upon men to abandon these
delights, they naturally resist and refuse to risk their lives, and
abandon their comforts, forgetting that by this conduct the ruin of
the most flourishing state is brought about, and that the fear of
losing some enjoyment often leads to the loss of all.
[38]

I have already said that the customs of WadaÃ¯ and those of
Darfur are similar in some respects. The houses in the latter are
more elegant, but those in the former are more solid. Warah is a
large city, surrounded by a natural rampart of mountains. The
dwelling of the Sultan is entirely of masonry, but is surrounded by
huts inhabited by slaves. To the west, outside of the wall, is a
mosque and a great square, called the Fasher, which word, in WadaÃ¯,
is restricted entirely to this place; whilst, in Darfur, it is
applied to the whole town in which the Sultan resides. Two lines of
acacia-trees adorn the Fasher of Warah. In the first line is a tree
especially set apart for the use of the Sultan, who sits under
it
[217]
every Friday on
coming out of the mosque, for the ceremony of salutation, in order
to review his troops and to receive the complaints of his people. A
little to the west of the first range of trees is another, under
which the Kadis, the Ulemas, and the Shereefs sit. There is another
range of trees, a good deal farther off, which serves as the
permanent tribunal of the Kamkolak.

The great gate of the palace, which opens on the Fasher, may be
used by every one, great or small, rich or poor. Outside are
numerous huts, principally built against the wall, and inhabited by
the Osban who may be on guard. These Osban are really Turguenaks,
although the latter name is more especially applied to the superior
officers of the corps, who are four in number, each commanding a
thousand men. The Osban form the body-guard of the prince, and are
also his executioners and the instruments of his anger. On this
account they wear a uniform of imposing and menacing aspect. They
wear short tunics, carry heavy clubs, and have iron head-pieces.
Every evening a body of one thousand comes to guard the palace,
five hundred remaining without, and five hundred acting as a
garrison within. They march up in four divisions, making a
frightful noise with their tambourines or drums, which are formed
of hollowed trunks of trees, with skins stretched over each end.
They do not wait to be relieved in the morning, but march
away
[218]
without being
replaced, for there is no guard during the day.

The tribunal where the Sultan dispenses justice is a little
square building, built against the wall-enclosure within the first
gate. The second gate is guarded by a number of pages, who have
passed the age of puberty, and who remain within. With them also
are the grooms. The third gate is called the gate of iron, and is,
indeed, covered with iron plates.
[39]
Beyond this, to the right,
is the Kasr; where the Sultan sits in the afternoon during
Ramadâhan to listen to the reading of the Koran. In the interval
which separates the third and fourth walls live the eunuchs and the
young pages who have not yet arrived at the age of puberty. These
alone, with the Sultan, are allowed to pass the fourth gate, which
leads to the harem.

The walls and buildings of which the palace is composed are not
much higher than a man, excepting the private apartment of the
Sultan, which has a story above the ground-floor, with three
windows overlooking the whole city. The windows are merely square
holes, with two sticks placed crosswise. The dwelling-places of the
eunuchs, the pages, and the Osban, spread throughout the palace,
exactly resemble in form the Forian huts, and, like them, are
constructed of millet-stalks; but the houses of Warah
[219]
have nearly all enclosures
built of earth mixed with stones. The earth used is greasy, and,
when submitted to the action of the rain, becomes covered with a
white crust as hard as iron.

Within the third gate of the palace, opposite the apartment of
Ramadâhan, is a kind of large shed, where every day the Sultan
passes some time despatching business. He is separated from those
who come to him by a partition of mats, made of a kind of grass
woven with wonderful delicacy. This enclosure allows the Sultan not
only to hear what is said, but to see those who are present without
being visible to them.

The town of Warah, which is divided into two divisions, the
Tourtalou, or left division, and Toulalou, or right division, is
less populated than Tendelty. The latter place, however, is chiefly
filled with merchants and strangers, who come and go. Neither city
has a large population. The Forians are fond of pageantry and show.
Each king surrounds himself with a number of secondary kings, who
form his court, and endeavour to imitate his manners. In this way
the principal people, instead of, as in other countries, collecting
in the capital, are dispersed throughout the various districts, and
Warah may be said to be inhabited chiefly by the court of the
Sultan.

The topographical position of Warah differs essentially from
that of Tendelty. The latter capital is
[220]
established on a vast Gauz, or sandy
country, where every one constructs a dwelling of the best aspect
he may. Many of the habitations of the viziers approach in
appearance that of the Sultan; but at Warah, which is hemmed close
in by hills, the palace takes up so much space, that the great
people who live there are obliged to occupy very humble
dwellings.

[221]
CHAPTER V.

States of Soudan â Women of Bagirmeh â The
Jenakherah â The Idolatrous Tribes â Their vast Numbers â A
Slave-hunt â A great River â Manners â Manufactures â Peculiar way
of going to bed â Marking Cattle â Cannibals â Origin of the
Fullans â Meaning of âSoudanâ â A Tempest â Thunder-bolts â Darfur
and WadaÃ¯.

Of
the various constituted
states of Soudan, the most vast are Bornou and Dar-Mella, after
which come Darfur, WadaÃ¯, Timbuctoo, and Bagirmeh. The least in
extent are Afnou and Adagez.
[40]
WadaÃ¯, although occupying
the fourth rank as to extent, has many especial advantages. The
slaves are much handsomer than those of Darfur, better trained, and
more attentive to domestic duties; but the best slaves of all
Central Soudan are, without doubt, those of Bagirmeh, especially
the women, whose docility and gentleness are beyond all praise.
When Saboun invaded that country the women turned the heads of all
the WadaÃ¯ans, and almost disgusted them with
[222]
their own wives. âVerily,â said they,
âwe have never seen women before.â Nevertheless, the Jenakherian
girls, which the WadaÃ¯ans take away from the idolatrous tribes
situated to the south of Dar-Seleih, are also remarkable for their
beauty; and in the habitual relations of life have a seductive
character which is not noticed in the slaves taken from the south
of Darfur. And yet the Jenakherian people, to the south of both
countries, touch upon and are confounded with one another; and the
slave-hunts from WadaÃ¯ and Darfur often meet. The name of
Jenakherah, in its general application, designates an immense
conglomeration of people, of which God only knows the number,
divided into an incredible number of tribes and clans, and spread
throughout a zone that extends from the south of Sennaar to the
south of Kashna, constituting Pagan Soudan.

In a straight line from east to west, there is from Sennaar to
Kordofal a distance of fifteen or sixteen days; from Obeid, capital
of the latter country, to Tendelty, there are ten or twelve days;
and from the Forian Fasher to Warah, there are twenty days of
ordinary marching, or ten days of forced marching. If you proceed
still westward, you come to Bagirmeh; but if you take a south-west
direction you reach Katakou, a province dependent on Bornou.
Between WadaÃ¯ and Bagirmeh there is a space of five or six daysâ
journey. From Warah to Bornou there are two roads, one a little
north of west, a distance of less than twenty days; but the second,
which traverses
[223]

Bagirmeh and Katakou, requires thirty-five days. In fine, to go
from Bornou to Adagez, you must proceed fifteen days westward in a
straight line.
[41]
From Adagez to Afnou there are four or five
days of desert.

The idolatrous tribes to the south of Soudan are divided into
groups and families. They are vastly superior in number to the
Muslims, who are thrown like a chain across the desert, and it is
at first surprising that they do not overwhelm them. The
explanation may be found in the spirit of brotherhood which unites
the Muslims, whilst the Pagans are always divided one against
another, each station being inimical to its neighbour. When the
enemy attacks a village, and takes away the women and children, the
people of the next village look on without attempting to give
assistance. They are attacked next, and their neighbours regard
them with equal indifference, and so on. If these idolaters knew
the strength which union gives, none of the Muslim states of Soudan
would dare to attack them.

In fact, the numerous tribes of these Majous, or Pagans, cover a
space which it takes at least three months of ordinary marching to
traverse. The Forian and WadaÃ¯an expeditions have been often out
for six
[224]
months, but
have never succeeded in reaching the southern limits. The Fakih
Medeny once related to me that a Forian expedition once pushed far
into Dar-Fertyt, and resolved not to return until they had reached
the southern boundary of that country. âThey advanced,â he said,
âfor five months, going straight before them. Their friends
wondered at their lengthy absence, and gave them up for lost. At
the end of the five months the expedition reached a great extent of
water, on the opposite banks of which it was difficult to
distinguish an object no bigger than a man. Some people, however,
dressed in red were descried, who took to flight on seeing the
Forian troop. There being no means of crossing the water, they were
now obliged to return. I asked for information on the distant
countries of many persons who had been with the expedition, but
could obtain nothing further. A long time afterwards I met an old
man who had been on several similar excursions, and he said that he
had once penetrated to the plain of water of which I have spoken,
and that a man from Arabia, who was with him, said that the savages
of the Fertyt somewhat resembled in appearance the Hindoos. But God
knows the truth.â

The various tribes of Pagan Soudan, although very numerous, have
all artificial signs, which distinguish them one from the other.
The Bendeh file all their teeth, except the molars, into a round
shape. The Kara are distinguished by the piercing of their lips.
The Shala have the rim of their ears pierced
[225]
with a series of holes, in each of which
a quill might be passed. Their women are distinguished by the
thousands of little cuts which they make upon their
stomachsâfiguring rings, squares, &c., and serving as
ornaments, for they wear nothing but a very slight cloth round the
middle. Others pierce the upper lip, others draw two of their
teeth, and others make three rows of incisions upon each cheek.

The regions of Pagan Soudan are remarkable for the fertility of
their soil and the purity of the air. The rains are abundant and
prolonged, and in some places cease only two months of the year. In
those southern countries are produced many kinds of tubercular
plants for food, one of which, called oppo, when cooked upon hot
coals, has the colour and the taste of a hard egg. Many fruit and
other trees cover the plains. The people, so savage, so
inhospitable, so far distant from the populations that are advanced
in the industrial arts, display, in the fabrication of certain
articles, a most wonderful address, giving them a finish worthy of
the ablest European artisan. They make for the kings and princes of
Soudan stools and seats of elegant shape and perfect finish. They
also manufacture, with a cleverness that reminds one of the
English, the knife-poniards which are worn tied to the arm above
the elbow, and also the iron-work of lances. I have seen among the
Fertyt tubes of iron, the work of which was of surprising purity
and beauty, reminding one of European industry. These tubes, which
are used for pipes, are
[226]
not more than a span long, and are bent and
twisted like some European pipes; but are more elegant, more
graceful, and are so beautifully polished that they resemble
silver. The bowls are made of earthenware, adorned with iron
circlets. They also make bracelets and armlets of elegant
manufacture.

The Fertyt make no kind of tissue, having no need of garments.
The men wear a kind of apron about a span in breadth, and the women
hide themselves only with leaves of trees, which are renewed as
soon as they wither. The tribe of the Jengueh is richest in cattle.
Their oxen are small, with long horns, and each individual has his
flock. These people, men and women, go entirely naked, without
apron or leaves. They are the most intrepid of the Fertyt, the most
audacious, and the best runners. They are so swift that none can
come up with them or escape them. They sleep both sexes together,
buried in ashes. This is the way the women in each family prepare
the beds: towards evening, when they have milked their cows and
finished their domestic labours, they take a large basket and go
through the country collecting dry dung, until they have made a
great heap before their hut. They then set fire to it and reduce it
to ashes. When they want to go to bed, the wife takes a piece of
butter and rubs her husband from top to bottom, after which he
creeps into his heap of ashes, where he sleeps. In the morning he
goes to the first pool of water and washes himself. What I cannot
understand in this habit is,
[227]
that being thus buried in ashes, the
Jengueh can breathe without drawing in the dust through the
nostrils. Is this the result of habit? Do they leave their heads
out in the air, or have they any other particular way of protecting
themselves, against suffocation?
[42]

The Jengueh do not mark their cattle in the same way as other
nations. Every one knows their animals by the shape of their horns,
for each herd have them in a particular direction, which is given
them as soon as they begin to grow. Thus one master has the horns
of his flocks perpendicular, another horizontal, another makes them
advance forwards, another backwards, or to the right or left, or
crosses them or twists them in various ways. These facts are
certified to me by many individuals who have visited Jengueh, and I
have myself seen some of their cows with horns bent in the shape of
crescents.
[43]

The Fertyts constitute an immense population,
[228]
without any religion
whatever.
[44]
When they are reduced to slavery they adopt the
religion of those whose property they become. A year before my
departure from Darfur a great Ghazwah, or expedition fitted out to
catch slaves, set out under the command of a king or sultan of
slave-hunts, authorised by the Forian Sultan according to the
established forms. When the expedition was about to cross the
boundaries of the Fertyt country some Bedawin Arabs presented
themselves to the chief, and said that they had discovered a
considerable tribe which had not hitherto been visited, and praised
emphatically their beauty. The king, delighted with this
information, took a body of men and set out; but some days
afterwards he came back much disconcerted, bringing only a few
slaves. I was afterwards told that this tribe was a tribe of
cannibals who eat people alive. âWhen we reached their territory,â
said a man who had accompanied the expedition, âand appeared before
the first village, an immense crowd of the savages, with a weapon
in the shape of a sickle, very pointed and sharp as a razor, in
their hands, rushed fearlessly towards us. Behind them came an
equal number of women, each carrying on her head a great bowl
filled with a thick paste. The savages rushed upon us, each
choosing a victim, and thrusting the point of their weapons in the
shoulder,
[229]
made an
enormous gash. The blood gushed in abundance, and immediately the
women came up with their bowls, from which the men took large
handfuls, and, having dipped them in the blood, began to eat. They
killed several of our men and devoured them, so that we fled away
in a fright.â

âAnd how,â said I, âdo you call this tribe, whom God
confound?â

âThey are called,â he said, âthe Majanah.â

The Pagans of Southern Soudan stretch, as I have said, far to
the west, even to Dar-Mella, or empire of the Fullans. These
Fullans were formerly considered to be the most contemptible of the
people of Nigritia. In Soudan, it is related that they descend from
a chameleon, and, consequently, never had a human father. The woman
from whom they sprang was found sleeping by a chameleon and bore a
child, from whom all the Fellatahs descended. For my part, I think
that this is a fable, invented with the purpose of contempt.
Now-a-days the Fullans are supposed to be the people who are the
most advanced in intelligence and knowledge, compared with the
other black populations of the centre of Africa. They themselves
pretend to be of the blood of the illustrious Ammar, son of Yasir,
one of the celebrated and virtuous companions of Mohammed.

If we consider the denomination of Soudan, (which means in
Arabic the country of the blacksâ
[230]
Nigritia,) as an expression indicating only
the colour of the people who inhabit that part of Africa, and not
as applied to a certain geographical division, we must comprehend
under it the whole extent of country from Sennaar and Abyssinia
inclusively, that is, from the shores of the Arabian Gulf to the
western limits of Timbuctoo and Mella. But those who consider the
divers regions of this zone in relation to the advantages and
products of each, and the quality of the slaves derived from them,
give the name of Soudan only to the cluster of states that stretch
westward from Bornou exclusively. Thus, when the
merchant-travellers of the Magreb, the Ghadamsees, and the
Fezzanis, say that they have been to Soudan, they mean only that
they have been to Afnou, Niffy, and Timbuctoo.
[45]

Those who have been to Bornou, WadaÃ¯, or Darfur, never use this
expression. They say that these three states are too inferior in
advantages and commercial resources to be counted amidst the states
of Soudan. When I returned to Tunis, I used often to say in the
presence of merchants, when I was in Soudan such and such things
happened. But they always took me up, saying,â âThou hast never
been in Soudan, but only in WadaÃ¯ and Darfur.â

I shall here make some observations on the climate of WadaÃ¯.
Wind, storms, thunder, and
[231]
lightning, are very frequent there at the
time of the Roushach. Their violence is such, especially during the
first days of autumn, that it is almost impossible to describe
their effects. During the whole time that I remained in the country
I scarcely ever saw rain that was not preceded by a great wind that
darkened the atmosphere. These storms generally advance from the
east, and, passing over Gauz, or sandy plains, raise immense
whirlwinds of dust, and carry them to a great distance. At the
commencement of the storm the horizon is wrapped in clouds, either
black or dun red. Presently the thunder bursts forth with terrific
rolls. The people, stricken with fear, run to hide themselves. The
shepherds hastily gather together their flocks and urge them
towards the villages. Those who are working in the fields hasten to
the nearest shelter, or run wildly towards the villages. The
traveller seeks the first refuge he can find, for, if he is found
abroad, there is peril. The storm, like a haughty and terrible
conqueror at the head of his black warriors, strikes and shatters
whatever it meets with. Isolated trees are often torn up by the
roots, crazy huts are borne away, and old enclosures beaten to the
ground. Even the beasts instinctively take to flight. The
whirlwinds come laden with sand and gravel, that strike people down
as if hurled from a sling.

When I first went to Darfur, on perceiving afar off these
immense whirlwinds, I expected great clouds
[232]
and showers to follow, but I was soon
undeceived. These dusty masses are seldom brought by south or west
winds. They are often the effects of violent gusts, without rain or
thunder, and for this reason are the more dangerous, for the rain
soon beats down the dust and sand, and restores tranquillity to the
air. Sometimes, during a whole month, these violent burrascos blow
every day, beginning in the afternoon. Generally, in the last days
of autumn, they are entirely without rain. When they happen at
night, they are commonly accompanied by frightful showers and
thunder-claps. The lightning falls, setting fire to villages, and
dashing trees to pieces. Mischief is announced by terrible
detonations, accompanied by long trains of fire descending from the
clouds. Many WadaÃ¯ans and Forians have assured me that they have
dug pits in the earth, at the place where the thunder has fallen,
and have found substances resembling ferruginous scoriÃ¦. In the
countries of Soudan where I have travelled the thunder is much
louder and more terrible than in Egypt. I do not know what is the
physical reason of this difference.

From what I have hitherto said of the customs of the Forians,
their manner of life, their food, their constitution, their
dwellings, their diseases, their ideas of medicine, the quadrupeds
and birds that are found in the country, it will be seen that in
comparing them with WadaÃ¯ the same conditions of life exist very
nearly in both countries. The analogy is explained by their
neighbourhood, for
[233]

each people borrows something from its neighbours. The tribes on
the two frontiers, likewise, are closely united in bonds of
relationship. In describing the manners of WadaÃ¯, therefore, I
shall only mention those points which are peculiar to them.

[234]
CHAPTER VI.

The Fellatahs â Their Religious Theories â Rise of
Zaky, or Dam-fodio â He undertakes a Reform â The first Battle â
Zaky becomes King â Conquest of Kashna â Laws â The Wahabites in
Arabia â Mohammedan Protestantism â State of Dar-Niffy â Anecdote
of Wealth â The Fullans conquer Niffy â Zakyâs first Defeat â
Muslim Civilisation â Characteristics of Nations.

The
Fellatahs accuse all
the other people of Soudan of impiety and heterodoxy, and maintain
that force of arms should be used to bring them into the right way.
They pretend that their neighbours have changed and adulterated the
principles of Islam; that they have violated the penal
prescriptions of the law, by allowing pecuniary commutations, that
is to say, an illicit trade proscribed by the sacred book; that
they have sapped the basis of religion, and have corrupted the
rules of Islam, by proclaiming illegal and criminal innovations as
legitimate; by shameful habits; by adultery and incest; by the use
of fermented drinks; by the passion for amusements, songs, and
dances; by the neglect of the daily prescribed
[235]
prayers; by indulgence of all kinds of
ill-regulated desires; and by the refusal of tithes for the poor.
Each of these crimes and shames deserves vengeance, and calls for a
Holy War in all the states of Soudan.

These thoughts had been stirring for many years in the minds of
the Fullans, and electrifying their imaginations, when suddenly
there rose a man amongst them revered for his piety and his
religion. This was the Fakih Zaky, known in Europe as Dam-fodio,
which means the son of Fody. He set himself up as a reformer, and
proclaimed a Holy War. A vast crowd responded to his voice. Then he
sent to the King of Mella, capital of the kingdom of the Fullans, a
letter, in which he blamed him sincerely for violating the precepts
of God and his Prophet; and ordered him to conform to the law that
was pure and holy, to abolish the taxes and customs on transit, and
follow exactly the penal laws enacted by the Koran. âIn a word,â he
said, âthou and thy subjects must submit rigorously to the maxims
of Islam and do penitence, or I will rise against thee, as formerly
did the just Abou-Bekr against those who refused the tithe of
Charity.â When the King of Mella received this letter he was shaken
by rage and indignation. âWhat!â he exclaimed, âthis wretch
threatens me with a revolt, and pretends that we are not Muslims!
Let us get rid of him.â He collected an army and sent it against
Zaky, ordering his vizier to put the whole of the insurgents to
the
[236]
sword, except
Zaky, who was to be taken alive and brought bound. News of the
approach of this army was brought Zaky, who said,ââThis is what I
desire.â He collected his partisans, and quietly awaited the
approach of the enemy. When they appeared, he told his men to mount
on horseback, but himself, from humility, got upon a camel, on the
back of which was a sheepâs skin. Then he made this speech:
âRemember that paradise is found under the shadow of swords. These
wretches are come to fight for an impious cause. We have called
them into the right way, and to reward us they threaten us with
arms. Meet their attack with courage, and be certain of victory;
for the Prophet has said, âEven if a mountain is guilty against
another mountain it is swallowed up in the earth.ââ

These words of Zaky filled his partisans with enthusiasm, and
they aspired to the glory of martyrdom. They advanced against the
royal army and routed it, and gathered immense quantities of spoil.
Then Zaky pushed on to the capital, where he defeated the king
himself, and took him prisoner, and slew him, and placed himself on
the throne instead. Then he organised the country and raised
troops. He chose a lieutenant, whom he ordered to comply
scrupulously with the text of the law; to exact only the legal
tithes, and to raise no more taxes than justice commanded. This
done, he set out with his army for Kashna. The hope of plunder
collected an immense number of people to join him; for
whatever
[237]
was taken
he distributed, without keeping anything for himself. From Mella to
Kashna there are about thirty stages, which were traversed without
accident. Even when on a journey Zaky fasted every day, and never
allowed many hours to pass without purifying himself by ablution.
When he was near the city of Kashna, the king, who had heard of the
revolution of Mella, came out to meet him. Zaky now sent a
manifesto similar to that which he had despatched to his deposed
prince. The King of Kashna tore it in pieces, and burst into
invectives against the Fullans, and attacked them, but was defeated
and killed. The Fakih proclaimed himself master of the country, and
his troops plundered the property of the king. He, however,
established the severest rules of justice, and made himself beloved
by all. He threatened the severest punishment to whoever committed
the slightest transgression of the law, or against religion. His
criers announced that when the Muezzin called to prayer, whoever
failed to be at the mosque should be punished with death. After
having spent some time in regulating the country, he announced to
his troops that he was determined to punish all the kings and
sultans of Soudan for their injustice and impiety, and began his
march against Niffy.

Let us here remark a singular coincidence. The war of Reform,
undertaken by the Fakih Zaky, began at the same time that the armed
Protestantism
[238]
of
the Wahabites triumphed in the Hejaz.
[46]

Whilst the fiery Fellatah was proceeding with his religious
conquests, Saoud, son of Abd-el-Azeez, the Wahabite, had come out
of Derieh, and marched in arms against Mekka and Medina, under
pretence that the people of the sacred territory had abandoned the
primitive ways of the law of Islam. It was according to these
principles of Puritanism that Saoud destroyed the tombs of the
saints and the companions of the Prophet. He instituted an overseer
of police, whose duty it was to beat those who abstained from the
mosque. He proscribed the use of tumback and tobacco, and forbade
the use of certain books, condemned the custom of praying to the
Prophet, and allowed of no invocation but to God. If he heard an
individual mix the name of the Prophet with his oaths and
protestations, whatever they were, he caused him to be seized and
beaten, and said to him,ââAcknowledge thy fault and expiate it,
polytheist that thou art!â Zaky fell into the same extremes of
rigour.

When the Fullans approached Niffy, the inhabitants of that city
came out in arms, but were defeated and cut to pieces. This place
is one of the most remarkable of all Soudan. It is celebrated for
the
[239]
easy character
of its inhabitants, and the well-being which they enjoy. Strangers
are received with benevolence, and some learned men have fixed
their dwelling-place there. The cheapness of provisions renders
life agreeable. The population is rich, and consists in a great
measure of merchants, who, at certain periods, go upon commercial
expeditions to Timbuctoo, to Kashna, and to other places of Soudan,
from whence they bring back merchandise, and especially slaves.
Dar-Niffy is situated south of the states of Morocco, and carries
on an active commerce with that empire.
[47]

The city of Niffy, as I have said, is full of very rich
merchants, who carry on a prodigious trade. The following anecdote
is a proof of this:âA merchant of Morocco, who wanted to exhibit
his great wealth, arrived there with at least a thousand slaves and
more than five hundred camels; the great people of the place came
to visit him, and felicitate him on his fortunate voyage. Not
knowing the amount of their fortune, he received them with
haughtiness. The chief was hurt by his airs of importance, but
dissimulated his anger, and resolved to humble the pride of the
stranger. He sent several people to ask what merchandise he had to
sell. âI have,â he said,
[240]
âthis troop of slaves, but I want to sell
all together, camels, cords, sacks, travelling utensils, &c.,
and I wish to find a single buyer. If there is any one who can pay
the price of my whole caravan, let him come.âââVery good,â they
replied; ârest after thy fatigues, and thou wilt easily find what
thou desirest.â

Two or three days afterwards, the Morocco man learned that there
was at Niffy an individual the amount of whose fortune no one knew.
He was the chief of the merchants of the city whom he had received
so coldly. This merchant called one of his inferior slaves, who
acted as a clerk, and said to him: âSaid, go and buy the whole
caravan of that man, slaves, utensils, camelsâeverything.â Said
dressed himself in his best, and went, and was received by the
Morocco man, who thought he had to do with the chief of the
merchants of the city. After a few words, Said observed that he had
a great number of slaves to send to some of his correspondents, and
had heard that there was a large caravan to be sold in a mass. The
bargain was soon struck, at the rate of six thousand cowrie shells
per head, and the price of all the other articles was also fixed.
The merchant only kept a slave-woman, by whom he had had a child.
The rest were led away; and Said told the merchant to come in three
days, and receive payment. At the appointed time the Morocco man
dressed, and went to the house of the chief of the merchants,
thinking that it was with him that he had done business. He found
him in a handsome
[241]

mansion, about which a considerable crowd was moving, whilst he
himself sat in a place apart, like a king, overlooking and
directing all this bustle. When the salutations had been exchanged,
the man of Niffy affected to talk with other persons on matters of
business; add it was not for some time that he condescended to
address the stranger, and say to him,ââFriend, what is the motive
of thy visit?â The other told him that it was to fetch the price of
his slaves, which he had sold to him three days ago. The head of
the merchants affected surprise, and said that he had not found it
necessary to buy slaves for a whole year, and yet had about ten
thousand left. âIs it possible, then, that there is any one else
here besides thyself who could have made this large
purchase?âââCertainly. I have myself thirty clerks who have slaves,
and yet the poorest of them could have bought thy whole lot.â At
this moment a slave came up, and mentioned that he had bought so
many slaves and so much gold dust, that he had received so many
thousands of shells, &c. His master asked him if it were he
that had bought the caravan of the merchant, but he said, âNo.â
Then the other clerks were called one by one, but all denied having
heard of the business; so that the merchant began to think that he
had lost his caravan. At last some one said that he had heard that
Said had bought a whole caravan. âMay Heaven confound him!â
exclaimed the chief of the merchants; âhe is always
[242]
doing those kind of things:
let him be called.â Said soon presented himself, and admitted the
purchase, but affected to be angry with the Morocco man for
speaking on such a trifling business to his master, and then
requested him to come and be paid. Having handed over the amount of
shells agreed on, he said,ââMay God and his Prophet preserve me
from ever buying again from such as thee! Didst thou consider me to
be insolvent, that thou shouldst thus go and complain to my master?
I have bought much greater caravans than thine without his knowing
anything of it.â The Morocco man was so humiliated by this proof of
his comparatively small importance, that he hastened to leave the
city.

Let us now return to the history of the Fullans. Zaky easily
made himself master of Niffy. Struck with the beauty of the
country, and the wealth of the inhabitants, he resolved to build
there a seat of government.
[48]
He became so fond of the
country that he always returned thither after his excursions.
Having rested a year, and organised the government according to the
principles of Islam, he marched upon Afnou, which is celebrated for
the beauty of its slaves, and soon conquered it as well as Aghadez.
Then he proceeded against Bornou, the Sultan of which fled, as I
have related, to Kanoum. Now it was that Emin preached a sacred
league against the invader, whom he accused of having uttered
false
[243]
accusations
against Soudan, as an excuse for extending his authority. Soon
afterwards Zaky was defeated with great loss, and driven out of
Bornou. This was the first revival of courage amongst the princes
of Soudan. It is singular that the defeat of the Fellatahs
coincided in time with the first reverses of the Wahabites, which
took place four or five years after the period when the French
definitively evacuated Egypt.

All these revolutions, which convulsed Central Soudan from Niffy
and Kashna to Bornou, were the consequences, as I have already
suggested, of the sedentary and tranquil life of the inhabitants.
Ibn-Khaldoun has already shown, in his great history, the effects
of luxury in rendering people effeminate. It may be objected that
the developments of industry and wealth in Europe do not produce
similar results. But it must be remembered that, in Islam, whatever
refinement exists is merely material, and has reference to the
pleasures of the table, the relation of the sexes, the laying out
of fine houses, furniture, valuable horses, singing, and domestic
festivals. But there is nothing done for the abstract sciences,
nothing for the departments of knowledge which are the domain of
intelligence, the applications of mathematics to arts and to war,
physics, chemistry, medicine, natural history, botany, and
experimental studies. The knowledge of the Muslim, when he has any
at all, is confined to religious and civil jurisprudence, according
to the rite he has adopted. He adds to
[244]
this certain theological notions on the
unity of God, and the elements of analytical grammar. This is all
that constitutes the science of the Ulemas, the learned men of
Islam, who attack all those who meddle with human sciences as
infidels and philosophers.

I shall now make some observations on the various characters of
the people of Soudan, comparing them with the other countries known
to me. The Forians resemble the Turks something in character, as
well as by a large number of words of their language, by the
ostentation of courage under which they mask their pusillanimity,
by their pride, coupled with their suppleness to humiliation, by
their love of idleness, by their haughtiness, by their fondness for
show, and their eagerness to exercise revenge when an opportunity
presents itself. Like the Turks, the Forians neglect important
things to busy themselves about matters of minor importance. But
that which characterises them essentially, especially those that
are indigenous, inhabiting the Marrah mountains, is an avarice
beyond all expression. Generosity and free and open hospitality are
found only among the kings, who are nearly all of Arab origin. The
Forians are wanting in vivacity of intelligence and in promptitude
of action. This is another feature in which these black men,
habitants of arid and unfertile countries, resemble the Turks, who
occupy a more favourable position.

The temper of the WadaÃ¯ans has some analogy
[245]
with that of the French. They resemble
them even in their fondness for institutions like that of the
quarantine; but, instead of having their narrow and grasping
parsimony, they have the generous hospitality of the Arabs. I also
notice in the councils of the Sultan a certain resemblance with the
parliamentary assemblies of France. The Kamkolaks, who are in
reality WadaÃ¯ans of an inferior rank, are counsellors of the
Sultan. If he were to dissent from their decisions, and oppose the
execution of their judgments, they would probably revolt against
him. This is another trait peculiarly French.

The people of Bagirmeh and Katakou remind me of the Italians in
the softness of their language, and the want of energy of their
character. The Birguid, the Tamians, and the Zagawah, are
perfidious and treacherous, like Greeks. Like them, they are base
and crawling when they fall in war into the hands of their enemies.
The Fullans resemble the Russians in their love of aggression and
conquest, and in the care they take to keep armies always ready for
that purpose; but in religious fanaticism they resemble the
Spaniards, and for a single prayer missed would put a man to death.
The Bornouese resemble the English in their somewhat coarse pride,
in their taste for luxury and show, and in their insatiable
avidity; but they are cowardly. Among Dajo and the Bijo, we find
the natures of the Fellahs, or peasants, of Egyptâthe same
laziness, the same carelessness of their persons, the same dirt
around
[246]
them. They
submit, without a word, to all kinds of oppressions from their
superiorsâto forced labour in every shape. They allow their
children, girls and boys, to be carried away and made to work,
without ever thinking of means of escape from unjust caprice, or of
freedom from odious servitude. This resignation is greater still
among the Berti and the Massalit, who are richer and more numerous.
They turn pale at the slightest glitter of warlike weapons, and at
sight of a few armed men tremble like sheep in presence of the
wolf. A single Forian, with a stick in his hand, can drive before
him two hundred men of Berti.

[247]
CHAPTER VII.

Trade, by whom followed â Exports of Darfur â Price
of Slaves â Imports â Value of Metals â The Tallari â Commerce of
WadaÃ¯ â Pledges of Love â A lost Moudraah â Value of Salt â
Manufactures â Interchange of Services â Burials â A Happy Country
â Counting Prayers â Forian Character â Occupations of Women â
Government of WadaÃ¯ â Offices â Audiences â Kabartou â Servility â
Punishments â Prisons.

The
Sovereign Disposer of
all things has placed commercial men neither among the great nor
among the poor, but among the middle classes. By their means the
productions of various countries are spread abroad, and relations
are established between nations. The most virtuous of men, the holy
Prophet of God, Mohammed himself, honoured this profession, and
went on trading journeys into Syria. His example has been followed
by men of various climates; among others, the people of Soudan,
being in possession of many natural productions, and in want of
manufactured articles, have naturally taken to trade.

From Darfur are exported slaves, gum, elephantsâ teeth,
tamarinds, various kinds of medicaments, ox-hides, from which are
made the great
[248]

square leathern bags, called in Egypt rai,
[49]

and black and white ostrich feathers. All these things are easily
sold in foreign countries, where there is a great demand for the
principal articles.

Darfur imports merchandise which is generally without value or
utility for civilised people, especially karaz, or glass ware,
beads, &c., of various kinds, used as ornaments by the women.
Some kinds serve the purpose of hidden jewellery, if I may so
express myself. They wear several strings of them round their
waist, the jingling of which is supposed to stimulate amorous
sentiments. Women know how to communicate their feelings and
desires to their lovers by this curious language. The Forian women
also wear, for the same purpose, bracelets and anklets, with little
bells, which tinkle as they move. Coral, artificial and otherwise,
is also sent to that country for the manufacture of ornaments. The
red caps worn by the men are brought from Fez. The slave-merchants
take to Darfur some fine cotton stuffs, each piece of which is of
sixty cubits. They cut them into lengths of twenty cubits in the
country where they buy, and having had them dyed, take them away,
and generally procure a slave for each cut. A coarse mixture of
silk and cotton is also used in the barter for slaves, as are also
several other kinds of stuffs. Foreign asses, such as those of
Egypt, are
[249]
highly
esteemed in Darfur.
A Forian will give ten slaves for one
ass!
[50]

They take to Darfur a good deal of sunbul or nard (
Spica
Celtica
), sandal wood, myrtle-leaves, cloves, coffee, and soap.
With the exception of the two last-mentioned articles, which are
imported in very small quantities, all these substances are reduced
to powder for cosmetics. Old vessels of copper, such as worn-out
caldrons, are sent to Darfur, and sold at a high price, to be mixed
with zinc, for making anklets and other ornaments. Yellow copper,
in leaves, is very rare, being used only to make the frontlets for
horses. Latten wire is much sought after, to ornament the shafts of
lances. Needles are very dear; a slave is given for a thousand.
Foreign razors bear also a high price; those made in the country
skinning rather than shaving. Turkish saddles, Mamlook stirrups,
coats of mail, and straight swordsâfor the Sultan only can use the
scimitarâ are in request. To these straight swords are attached
silver pommels, in which are hollows containing pebbles, that
produce a jingling sound. When thus ornamented, a sword is called a
garlic-head.

One of the most profitable articles of importation is the
tallari, or Spanish douroâthe pillar-dollar. A slave is bought for
eight or ten dollars (from 2
l
. to
[250]
2
l
. 10
s
.). Bars of
sulphur are also very valuable in Soudan; so is writing-paper; and
the sale of Muslim books of jurisprudence, and of the Haddyth, or
book of traditions of the Prophet, is very advantageous. Brass
inkstands, with cases for pens attached, and pen-knives, are sold
to the Fakihs. Muslin for turbans, shoes, and yellow slippers for
women, are only sent to private orders. Most of these articles are
supplied by Egypt to Darfur.

WadaÃ¯ imports almost the same articles as Darfur, although the
people are less refined in their taste, and the law interferes in
some respects. For example, the khaddour, which is the ornament of
the common women in Darfur, is restricted in WadaÃ¯ to the wives of
great personages, and no one is allowed to use Turkish saddles
except the Sultan. The articles most sought after are various kinds
of beads, natural and artificial coral, copper, calicoes, melayeh,
various kinds of perfumes, coats of mail, sabres, and yellow copper
in leaves. The WadaÃ¯ans use more silk in their ornaments than the
Forians. Asses are rarely demanded. Most of the merchandise brought
to WadaÃ¯ comes by the way of Fezzan.

In Darfur is bought a kind of bead about three fingersâ breadth
long, and generally black and white, called chor. The women string
these beads on threads taken from the leaves of the daum, or on
grass stalks. The rich interpose between a black bead and a white
bead a round bead of coral. In this way moudraahs, or armlets, worn
above the
[251]
elbow,
are made. Many young Forians wear these ornaments as a sign that
they love a young girl, or are beloved by her. Pledges of affection
are often interchanged in this way. To a young girl is given
generally a ring, or a cadmoul, or sash of cotton striped with
silk. In return, the lover receives a moudraah, and exhibits it on
his arm, proud of his good fortune.

When I arrived in Darfur my father had two concubines, to one of
whom he was passionately attached, being guided in his likes and
dislikes by her. One day she was engaged with some of our slaves in
arranging her collars, and I was sitting on the ground close by. A
young Arab girl of the neighbourhood came and brought a present of
a bowl of milk, which was put aside for my father, but I went and
drank it, upon which my step-mother became angry. It happened that
one of her moudraahs fell to the ground, and, being buried in the
dust, could not be found. She accordingly accused me, as soon as my
father came in, of having fallen in love with the Arab girl, and of
having stolen the armlet to make her a present. I was innocent, but
my father believed the accusation, and next day ordered my uncle
Zarouk to put me in irons and imprison me in a room. I was kept in
this way for three days, regretting that I had come to Soudan. The
anklet, however, was at length found, and I was let loose, and
presented, by way of consolation, with a complete new suit. I went
to kiss the hand of my
[252]
father, who said to me, with emotion, âGive
thanks to God that it was I, and not a judge, who had to examine
this affair, otherwise thou wouldst have been condemned.â A little
while afterwards this woman again accused me of theft, upon which
my father ordered her to be chained and sent to the kitchen to
work. It was with some difficulty that he was induced to forgive
her. Long afterwards he left her in WadaÃ¯ with Zarouk. She was
insubordinate, and was put in prison by the Sultan, and remained
there several years, being only let loose to bear a child.

The most lucrative article of commerce in Darfur and WadaÃ¯ is
red copper, which brings almost its weight in gold. Next comes
zinc, and then tallaris and latten, in leaf. All these things are
brought by the Jellabs, or slave-merchants, on their return
journeys.

The Arabs of the neighbouring desert import other articles, as
melted butter, oxen, cowsâ hides, and honey. The Rezeigat,
especially, bring large quantities of butter. Other tribes trade in
salt, which they fetch from the wells of Zaghawy. This substance is
much sought after in Darfur, where it is often sold one measure for
twenty measures of millet. The salt of Mydaub is especially set
apart for the viziers and other great people. That of Zaghawy is
the worst that can be found in the world, being mixed with great
quantities of earth. People in easy circumstances dissolve it in
water, which they strain off, and afterwards allow to evaporate.
Verily! if the Forians were to behold salt like that of
Rosetta
[253]
or Tunis,
they would fight for it sword in hand. The Falgo salt, found in the
Marrah mountains, is used in pieces as money.
[51]

As might be expected, industry is little developed in Central
Africa. In Darfur and WadaÃ¯ there are no trades scarcely but those
of the weaver, the blacksmith, the cultivator, the spinner, and the
founder, that is to say, the maker of lances, of bows and arrows,
and some rough utensils for agriculture and the ordinary uses of
life. In Darfur there are strangers from Katakou, who dye in blue,
with indigo, and know how to produce the varying blue-black tints
of the Godeny and the Teykan. The Forians are very clever in
tanning skins, for which they have all the necessary implements and
substances. They prepare, with the hides of oxen and camels, sacks,
and large fine pieces of leather, which are used to sit or sleep
upon, or to bolt wheat. With the skins of goats they make excellent
bags for carrying travelling provisions. With sheep-skins, red or
green, they cover scabbards or saddles.

There are scarcely any other arts in Darfur than those which I
have indicated. The wants which in civilised countries have created
the professions are satisfied by mutual assistance. Neighbours
shave the heads of one another, and then there is no need of
barbers. If a man requires a house, he calls in his friends, and
pays them with a dinner and supper, and so there is no need of
builders.

[254]
If a man dies, a
friend, and, above all, a Fakih, performs the last duties, washing
the corpse and burying it, for every one knows the simple
ceremonies necessary. If a woman dies, the funereal duties are
performed by some old person of her own sex. To carry the corpse to
the burial-place, they knock up on the spot a rough litter, made of
two sticks with cross strings. Upon this is placed a kind of bed,
made of mats. The corpse is placed thereon, and thus taken to the
place where the friends of the deceased have dug a grave, which is
in all cases separate from any other. Neither those who wash the
corpse, nor those who carry it, receive any kind of payment; and no
charge whatever is made by those who recite the Koran for the
repose of the soul of the deceased, or who repeat the prayers of
deliverance, or who tell the chaplet of pardon. There is,
therefore, no need of undertakers or priests in that country.

In Darfur I have seen the prayers of the chaplet counted by
means of little fragments of reeds. Whoever wants to take part in
these kind of prayers cuts ten small fragments of reed and ten
large ones. When he has pronounced on his ordinary chaplet the
first hundred of La Illah ilâAllahââThere is no other God but God,â
he puts aside one of the small pieces of reed; after the second
hundred, he puts aside another piece; and so on until all the ten
are united. Then he knows that he has articulated a thousand times
his confession of faith. In order to
[255]
count the thousands, he puts aside one of
the large pieces of reed, so that at last he knows exactly when he
has uttered the sacred words ten thousand times. The Forians
pretend that the fragments of reed thus used acquire beneficent
virtues. If they are burned near a fever patient, they at once cure
him. The ashes mixed with water form an effective collyrium, which
cures ophthalmia, if applied three days successively in the
morning. Some of the fragments placed between a corpse and its
shroud induce God to treat the soul of the deceased with
benevolence, and not to be severe in the appreciation of its
faults. Fraternal charity, in reference to the will of God, is a
common thing in Darfur. He upon whom any misfortune falls is always
succoured by his friends and those who know him.
[52]

The Forian women have no knowledge of the domestic labours to
which the women of civilised countries are accustomed to. The
daughters of the rich spend a part of the day in adorning
themselves; in rubbing their bodies with butter and their hair with
grease, in putting kohl in their eyes, in perfuming themselves, and
curling their hair. When they have finished they occupy themselves
with household duties, and then pass their time in making fine mats
with slips of daum leaves, which they have stained of different
coloursâred, black, green, or
[256]
yellow. These mats are light and handsome,
and seem to invite those who see them to sit down and sleep.

A Forian woman, of whatever class, generally prepares the food
of her husband and the guests who come to the house. The poor
assist the men in sowing and reaping, in gathering grain and
cotton. At other periods of the year they collect a store of fruit
and many kinds of wild grains for their families. It is they also
who gather in the water-melons, and pound them, and prepare them
for eating. They go out into the fields with their husbands and cut
down the weeds, which they collect for fuel. The very young girls
keep the flocks, and afterwards accompany their parents in their
work. In the evening it is the wife who brings home upon her head a
great packet of wood and dry grass or weeds, to serve for the
purposes of cookery and to light up the huts.

The poor people generally endeavour to buy each a she-goat or a
sheep, on the milk of which they live. They are in a most frightful
state of want and misery, suffering from the tyranny of their
governors and the exigencies of war. Their life is that of
slaves.

Let us turn from the consideration of these humble topics to
that of the government and the constitution of the country of
WadaÃ¯.
Certes
, the most powerful and the most respected
sovereign in all Soudan was Sultan Saboun. It is the custom in
WadaÃ¯ to recognise as a prince only one who is born of a mother of
noble origin, whose genealogy
[257]
is pure, and who belongs to one of the five
privileged tribes. The son of a slave, even if she were a
descendant of the Prophet, can never ascend the throne. I have
already traced back Sultan Saboun to the great Seleih, and it is
not necessary to repeat what I then said.

The functions and dignities of Darfur differ in nature from
those of WadaÃ¯. In the latter country there are eight Kamkolaks;
four of the first rank and four of the second. They form a judicial
tribunal, whose decisions can never be reversed by the Sultan. If
he has strong reasons for blaming any particular sentence, and they
persist in it, he may discharge them, but he cannot reverse what
they have decreed without the assistance of the Grand Kadi.

The highest rank after the Kamkolaks is that of Momo, mother of
the Sultan; then comes that of Hobaba, or chief wife; and
afterwards are ranged the Aguid, the Viziers, the Kamna, and the
Turguenak. Then follow the kings of the mountains, the governors of
secondary rank, and the kings.

Twice a-week, on Mondays and Fridays, the WadaÃ¯an Sultan gives a
public audience to receive the complaints of his people. On the
Monday he occupies a room which overlooks the Fasher, where are the
lines of trees I have mentioned, under which is established the
tribunal of the Kamkolaks, indicated by a line of lances stuck up
in the ground. The judges remain there all the morning and
afternoon, and only go away during the great heat, or
[258]
when it rains. As I have
mentioned, it is also under a tree that the Sultan gives audience
on Friday.

Then the Kadi, the Muftis, the Ulemas, the Shereefs, and other
great people, each according to his rank, squat down on the ground
before the Sultan, between whom and the crowd is a row of seven
interpreters, ranged one behind the other. Amongst the Forians the
people begin by uttering their salutations; but in WadaÃ¯ no one
speaks before the Sultan. The interpreters repeat his words,
saying: âKadi, the Sultan salutes thee; Ulemas of Islam, the Sultan
salutes you;â and so on through all the various ranks until they
come to the people. The individuals of each category, as soon as
they have been addressed, clap their hands and incline their heads
even to the earth, at first on the right hand and then to the left.
During this ceremony, and almost without interruption, the baradieh
and tambourine resounds behind the Sultan, and whenever its notes
are strengthened the whole assembly accompanies it by a gentle
clapping of hands. At the same time the soldiers, who are ranged
standing round the crowd, brandish and strike together the iron
rods which they hold in each hand. This beating of the tambourine,
this clapping of hands, this clashing of weapons, is mingled,
moreover, with the cries of the soldiers, who shout out, âGlory to
thee, O Sultan! Buffalo of intrepidity! May God make thee
victorious over our enemies,â thee, our master!â All these sounds
make a strange and savage concert.

[259]
The Kabartou
form a choir who in public ceremonies sound the trumpet and beat
the tambourine; they also act as executioners. In the weekly
assemblies they sit on a slightly-raised platform, some of them
furnished with long trumpets, which assist in increasing the
clamour. When the music ceases to play, the Turguenak advance,
armed with clubs, the knobs of which are covered with iron. They
wear steel headpieces, and most of them have coats of mail, whilst
others have a thick-padded tunic, to protect them in battle against
arrows. Each company is headed by two drums, which are beaten with
tremendous violence. They march through the crowd, and then round
between it and the Sultan, making as if they would strike the
spectators, and crying: âAsk pardon of God and the Prophet.â

At the extremity of the Fasher, opposite the palace, is a little
eminence called Thoraya, on the top of which is a building in which
are deposited the great kettle-drums of the Sultan. At WadaÃ¯ the
covering of these drums, instead of being performed with
ceremonies, as at Darfur, is executed in secret. Whenever the
Sultan appears upon the Fasher the music of Thoraya resounds, and
at the same time is heard the crash of the baradieh, the rolling of
the tambourines of the Kabartou, the trumpets of the Turguenak, the
clashing of the iron rods, the clapping of hands. It is impossible
to conceive a greater clamour. On Friday, after the salutation,
whoever has any complaint to make proceeds in the
following
[260]

manner:âHe first strips his garments off his shoulders and ties it
round his loins; then he walks in front of the spectators from
right to left, stooping down and clapping his hands. He does this
until he succeeds in attracting notice. If the matter is of minor
importance the Sultan sends the plaintiff to the Kamkolak; if
otherwise, he himself decides.

The respect of the WadaÃ¯ans for their Sultan is a kind of
adoration. They never lay any business before him without repeating
the first chapter of the Koran, and praying God to grant him
victory and long life. Everything of value is reserved for him. No
vizier or functionary is allowed to wear silk on his person, or in
the housings of his horses. He must not have a saddle covered with
cloth, nor gilded, nor embroidered in gold, nor garnished with
silver. No one but he, moreover, is allowed to make use of a carpet
to sit upon. No man or woman is permitted to have ornaments of
gold, nor to have fans of ostrich feathers, nor even of coloured
paper, as in Europe. Both sexes indifferently wear clothes, black
or white, of cotton, linen, or coarse muslin. All ornaments, even
of the wives of viziers and emirs, are of silver; the middle
classes wear copper, and the poor iron. If any one were to
transgress this sumptuary law, whatever might be his rank, he would
be put to death without mercy.

The object of these customs is to repress the spirit of
insubordination,âto prevent its being supposed that there is no
difference between a
[261]
sovereign and his subject, and thus to
prevent revolt. The servility of the people is so great that it is
not allowed amongst them to praise any one whatever. No one is
worthy of praise but their Sultan. It is not even allowed for a
subject to bear the same name. Under the reign of Saleh the people
of the provinces came to present themselves to that Sultan. The
interpreter, according to custom, had taken down their names
beforehand in a hurry. Among the visitors was one named Saleh, so,
in addressing him, the interpreter said,â âThe Sultan salutes Fakih
Saleh.â At these words the Prince frowned, and uttered a cry like
that of a peacock. The interpreter felt his danger, and quickly
said,ââThe Sultan salutes thee, Fakih Fakeh.â Near Warah there was
a well called the well of Saboun; when that Sultan came to the
throne it was called the well of Ochar.

The Sultan never drinks water twice following from the same
place. The water-carriers of the palace come suddenly upon one of
the wells, and beat away with whips those who are near it, and then
fill their jars. It is feared that some one may bewitch or poison
the water, which is put carefully in jars, enough for twenty days
being taken at a time.

No person is allowed to appear before the Sultan inside his
palace with a turban, with shoes, or even fully dressed. He takes
off something at each gate, until he is reduced to a single garment
round the
[262]
middle.
When the Sultan calls any one he uses the words, Ya Abd!ââOh
slave!â which appellation is received with pleasure. No one is
allowed to see him face to face in his own dwelling, for he always
speaks from behind a partition or curtain.

When a debtor delays payment too long in WadaÃ¯, the creditor, on
meeting him, whether alone or in company with others, draws a line
round him and says, âI summon thee in the name of God and his
Prophet, in the name of the Sultan, and the mother of the Sultan,
and the judges, not to overpass this line until thou hast paid me.â
After this the debtor dare not pass until he receives permission or
pays his debt, otherwise he may be severely punished.

It is customary in all WadaÃ¯ to give to any pretty girl the
surname of Habbabeh, the title of the first wife of the Sultan.
After this she cannot be married until she has been presented to
the Sultan, who has the option of keeping her for his harem or of
sending her back to her father.

Few persons occupy a lofty position for more than two years.
After that they are removed to other posts or fall into disgrace.
There is an extensive system of inspection organised. Malversation
is severely punished.

There are various kinds of punishment established by the Koran
and by the laws of different countries. Murderers are decapitated
in Egypt, or cut to pieces with swords, or hanged, or
impaled.
[263]
In the
times of the Mamlooks, a frightful punishment was that of the
Shamyal. The body of the criminal was placed in a great basin and
stained with tar, which was set on fire, and in this state he was
carried about the city on the back of a camel. The last person who
suffered this punishment was a woman named Jinieh, who used to
decoy young women into her house to assassinate them. Other
criminals were burned, others were buried alive. In the year 1797
of the Christian era there was a Turk who used to put men in a deep
pit, and sit over it to take his meals until they died. In Tunis it
is still customary to pound people in mortars. A Sultan of Morocco
once put a Jew in a barrel, the inside of which bristled with
nails, and ordered it to be rolled down a hill. There are various
other kinds of punishments, by drowning, strangling, poisoning,
starvation, or the cannon. The Defterdar Bey, in Egypt, used to
call the cannon employed for this purpose his Kadi, and when he
condemned any one to that kind of death, used to say simply,ââTake
him to the Kadi.â

Many of the punishments ordered by the Muslim law have fallen
into disuse. For some time robbers have begun to be sent to the
galleys, instead of having their hands cut off. In Soudan people
are allowed to buy themselves off from condemnations, even for
incest and murder.

In Darfur the most common punishments are imprisonment and
stripes. The prison is an inclosure
[264]
without roof or flooring, in which the
convict is thrown with irons on his feet and a collar round his
neck. The gaolers are eunuchs. The prisoners are obliged to occupy
themselves in tanning hides, and if they do not perform their
appointed task in a proper time they are severely punished. If they
oversleep themselves in the morning, they are dreadfully beaten for
a long time. Those who are condemned for life have their irons
rivetted on.

Among the Forians, they have what they call the bortoan-bau, or
break-melon. When an individual is condemned to death by the
Sultan, he says,â âBreak the melon;â upon which the executioners
seize the condemned man, and raising him in the air, drop him down
several times head foremost until he be dead. Men are sometimes
stretched between two posts and beaten with the prickly branches of
a stinking tree, until death nearly ensues. Murderers are killed
with a lance by the nearest relation of the victim. There is a
commutation established for a broken tooth, or any other wound.

In WadaÃ¯ the punishments determined by the religious laws are
applied according to the very terms of the Koran.
[53]

The Sultan has also the right to condemn to death, to stripes, or
to imprisonment.
[265]

When he wants to put a criminal to death, he says to his Kabartou,
âTake that man and crush him,â and he is immediately led out to the
Fasher and killed with clubs. Stripes are administered with whips
made of the hippopotamusâ hide; and men are often known to receive
a hundred or a thousand blows without a cry. Prisoners have
sometimes their legs tied round trees, at other times their feet
are put in a kind of fetter called a scorpion.

As
in Darfur, hunters and
blacksmiths in WadaÃ¯ form the lowest classes of the population. If
a Shereef passes by a blacksmithâs shop, he has the privilege of
taking away any object he pleases. The origin of this custom was,
that a Shereef once rubbed his hands with an incombustible unguent
and carried a piece of red-hot iron, ever since which they have
been thought to possess a magical power. I have been told in WadaÃ¯
that fire does not burn Shereefs, but I have never seen an example
of this.

In WadaÃ¯ the Sultan has a discretionary power over individuals,
but he cannot change the established custom. The slightest
innovation might cost him his life. Sultan Saboun once wished to
alter the grain measure; but the people refused to
[267]
comply, and my father was
deputed to set forth before the Sultan the danger of an
insurrection. Another time Saboun wished to coin money, and
established a mint; but it was represented to him that the same
proposition had been made, but had been rejected, for fear that it
might destroy the simple customs of the country. Saboun abandoned
his project. The Sultans of Soudan affect an imposing and terrific
appearance, so that no one unaccustomed to address them can speak
without fear. It is related that Sultan Tyrab, of Darfur, once sent
to some Bedawin Arabs an elephant to feed and bring up. This huge
animal committed great destruction, but no one dared to interfere
with it. At last, however, the people went to the Sheikh and
complained, saying,ââWhat an enemy we have here in this elephant!
Why, when the Sultan sent it to thee, didst thou not observe that
we were poor people, unable to bring up such a monstrous beast?
Thou hast received this parasite without saying a word. He devours
our provisions and destroys everything. Get rid of the accursed
brute, or we will kill it.â

âBut,â replied the Sheikh, âI should not dare to say these
things to the Sultan.â

âTake me with thee,â quoth a Bedawin; âif thou art afraid, I
will speak. I only ask one thing, that thou shouldst begin by
saying, âThe elephant!â Then the Sultan will ask, âWhat of the
elephant?â and I will reply, the elephant behaves in such
wise.â

The Sheikh accordingly went one day with the
[268]
Bedawin, and entered the
Fasher on a Friday. On coming to the gate of the palace, they saw a
personage ride out on horseback, with tambourines beating and
trumpets sounding.

âIs that the Sultan?â said the bold Bedawin to his
companion.

âNo, it is one of his viziers.â

Then the orator began to tremble, and to say,â âHow, then, is
the Sultan?â

Immediately afterwards another personage came forth, surrounded
by soldiers, dressed in brilliant garments, preceded by horsemen,
and accompanied by music.

âThat, at least, is our master!â quoth the Bedawin,
stupified.

âNo, it is only one of the grand viziers.â

The poor man then began to understand the danger of his
position. His heart leaped, and he was afraid. At this moment the
Ab galloped into the Fasher, surrounded by a crowd of horsemen, and
with prodigious pomp. The roaring of the tambourines was
deafening.

âHow terrible is the Sultan!â exclaimed the Bedawin, who, on
learning that he was still mistaken, wished the earth would open
and swallow him up. Then the Sultan himself came forth amidst the
crash of cymbals, the roaring of drums, and the trampling of
horses. It seemed as if heaven and earth were coming together. The
Sultan halted, and the soldiers ranged themselves in two lines.
Then the
[269]
Bedawin
Sheikh advanced, and exclaimed aloud,â âMay God protect our master,
and make him victorious over his enemies!âThe elephant!â

âWhat of the elephant?â said the Sultan.

The Sheikh winked at his companion, and whispered, âIt is now
thy turn to speak.â But the unhappy orator had not a word to
say.

âWhy,â exclaimed the Sultan, in a terrible voice, âwhat of the
elephant?â

The Sheikh, seeing that he was to have no assistance, and
fearing punishment, replied,ââThe elephantâwhy, the elephant is
unhappy because he is alone. We wish thee to give us another
elephant to keep him company.â

âLet them have another elephant,â said the Sultan; and they
accordingly departed, and returned to their tribe with a huge
brute, bigger than the former one.

âWhat is this?â said the people; âwe sent you to get rid of one
nuisance, and you bring us another.â

âAh! my friends,â said the orator, who now at length found his
tongue, âthere never was a man who has such presence of mind and
neatness of expression as your Sheikh. Thank God, who has given you
such a blessing!â

The second elephant was accepted, and no more was said.

Some poor devils of WadaÃ¯ans heard one day that honey was a
marvellously sweet thing, and agreed to go to the Sultan and ask
for a taste. They
[270]

accordingly went to Warah, and, waiting till the prince came out,
prostrated themselves, and explained the nature of their visit. The
Sultan flew into a passion, and exclaimed,ââDo you mean to make fun
of me by coming to talk of a thing of so little importance? Let a
whole skinful be brought.â He was obeyed, and the poor fellows were
ordered to eat the whole on pain of death. They soon began to be
disgusted; their stomachs heaved; they could not go on. Then the
Sultan ordered them to be shut up with the skin, and given nothing
to eat until they had swallowed the whole.

Formerly the Sultans were equally simple with the peasants.
Three men once raised three crops of onions, of red pepper, and of
garlic, and each went with a camel-load to make a present to the
Sultan. The latter, who did not know these vegetables in their
natural shape, being told that they were condiments, was charmed
with the handsome colour of the pepper, and put some into his
mouth. He instantly felt a burning sensation, and exclaimed: âThese
people are rascals, and have come to poison me! let them be put in
prison until they have eaten all that they have brought, and
nothing else.â The order was executed, and the three peasants were
kept in confinement for three years, when they were let out; two of
them afflicted with dreadful diseases, and the third, who had fed
on garlic, in good health.

Some insatiable smokers, who had no money left to buy tobacco,
determined to go and ask the Sultan
[271]
for some. The prince was angry, and ordered
a huge pipe-bowl to be made, three cubits in height, and filled
with tobacco, with ten tubesâthe number of the beggars attached;
and ordered them to smoke the whole. After a few whifs, however,
they all fainted, and were sent away with a warning not again to
make such absurd requests.

Formerly the Sultan of WadaÃ¯ was not allowed to drink milk; for,
said the WadaÃ¯ans, if the Sultan drinks milk, what shall his
subjects drink? At length, however, the prince took it into his
head to have a milch cow; the people rose in insurrection and
ordered him to get rid of it, and he was compelled to obey. This
custom, however, is now abolished.

In great ceremonies the WadaÃ¯ans wear ample turbans, but the
common head-dress is the tarboosh. Their chief garment is a loose
gown, generally of black stuff, made of narrow stripes sewed
together. Nearly every one carries a short sword, and a dagger tied
to the arm above the elbow. When a man is appointed to any high
post, the Sultan himself places a turban on his head.

In WadaÃ¯ the people do not enliven their amusements by music;
the drums, tambourines, and trumpets are only used in public
ceremonies. I have already mentioned the use of frontlets for the
horses. These ornaments are much better worked in Darfur than in
WadaÃ¯. Indeed, all the trades have an inferior development in the
latter country. The lances
[272]
used are much less handsome; on the other
hand, the WadaÃ¯ans are much braver than the Forians.

The costume of the women of WadaÃ¯ resembles that of the Forian
women; but they do not wear rings in their noses, replacing them by
pieces of coral or wood. Their handsomest ornament is the amchinga,
elegantly made of a number of crescents of silver, with coral and
amber.

The WadaÃ¯an women have nearly always a toothpick in their hands,
and scarcely ever leave off using it except during sleep. Their
teeth are beautifully white, and their mouths deliciously sweet.
They wear a cloth tied round their loins, and a kind of cape made
of a piece of cloth, with a hole in the middle to cover their
shoulders and their bosom.

In general the WadaÃ¯an men are robust, but not so black as the
Forians and Bagirmians. They do not disdain, as do the Forians, the
white colour, although the European complexion is not to their
taste. The whole nation is large and well developed. Young girls
are obliged to abstain from much food, for fear of acquiring too
great
embonpoint
. The women perform the greater part of the
fatiguing labour. They go to the market with two baskets, which
they carry poised on their shoulders like a pair of scales. They
work in the fields, fetch wood or water, and gather rice,
tamarinds, and karobs. It is the duty of the men to make war, to
weave and spin, and deal in the larger articles of trade, as cattle
and slaves.

[273]
In Darfur and
WadaÃ¯ the men mix freely night and day with the women. Girls and
married women do not scruple to pass their nights with those who
please them. Nothing can prevent lovers from meeting. A Turguenak
became enamoured of one of the concubine slaves of Sultan Saboun,
and was beloved by her also; yet the Sultan was so fond of her that
he had taken her with him on the Tamah war. She corrupted the
slaves, men and women, who served and surrounded her, and escaped
from the tent of the Sultan at night to meet her lover. But this
came to the knowledge of Saboun, who put her to death, and gave to
his Viziers and Ulemas all her accomplices, who were very
beautiful. My father received two. âWhen,â he used to say, âSaboun
told me to take my choice, I did not know which to prefer; as each
passed before me she seemed more beautiful than the former. I was
embarrassed; but, fearing to appear ridiculous by my indecision, I
shut my eyes, and advancing thus, seized two at haphazard.â My
father afterwards learned that one of these girls had long been in
love with the Kamkolak Kidermy, and accordingly sold her to him for
a horse worth four slaves, ten young girls of six spans, and a
magnificent camel. The other, called Zoheirah, was beloved by my
father for some time; but he sold her at Tunis because she
misbehaved herself.

I have already related how the old women in Darfur introduce
youths dressed as girls into harems. These intrigues, in my
opinion, are caused by the
[274]
system of having so vast a number of women
as the property of one man. Evidently there is disproportion in
this; and we must not be surprised if the women, under these
circumstances, in the fullness of youth, undergo all kinds of
dangers. It is customary in WadaÃ¯ not to force the affections of
women. If a girl attaches herself to any one, her choice is left
free; and if, out of ten suitors, one is distinctly chosen, the
nine others are forbidden ever afterwards to address her, except as
âmy sister,â to which she replies, âmy brother.â But if, after her
first choice, she transfer her affections to any other of the nine,
then is the beginning of jealousy and enmity. Now, it happened that
two friends became enamoured of a beautiful girl, and requested her
to choose between them. She did so, and the other said to her,
âThou art now my sister.â But, some time afterwards, she became
weary of her first lover, and desired the other, whose passion also
revived. But he feared, if he confessed his sentiments, to incur
the reproaches of his friends and the hatred of his rival, and to
be the cause of misfortune. He therefore took his friend apart, and
said to him,ââThou knowest that women are the causes of collision
and struggles between men; learn that thy mistress wishes to
separate from thee, and throw herself into my arms; but I fear to
accept her, lest we should become enemies. If thou wishest to know
the truth, I will seek an interview; and thou shalt hide thyself,
and afterwards thou shalt be free to choose whether thou wilt
abandon her with reproaches,
[275]
or whether I shall go away and remain
absent until she has forgotten me.â This plan was agreed upon, and
the interview took place in the hearing of the first lover. The
girl did not scruple to avow her new affection, declared that she
repented of her first choice, said that love was replaced by
hatred, and showed herself willing to abandon herself to new
caresses. Upon this the hidden lover, unable to contain himself,
rushed forward and stabbed her. Then the two friends agreed to cut
her in pieces and bury her, which they did; and no one knew the
truth until after the death of the murderer. Ah! how perfidious are
women! May Heaven never, never forgive an unfaithful woman! The
mercy of God be on the author of the following words:â

âOf women there are certainly some that are worth eighty
she-camels; but there are others not worth the skin of a foal. May
God, in his goodness, burn all unfaithful women in hell for
ever!â
[54]

I have already said that the WadaÃ¯ans are brave. This character
is more strongly developed, of course, in the young men, when their
heads are heated with inebriating drinks. Their conversation, at
such times, becomes often coarse and brutal, and quarrels, in which
blood is shed, often arise. Those who are especially distinguished
for courage and pride are
[276]
called Afrits, or devils. These men at once
render themselves terrible by their murders and robberies. They
frequently exercise their violence near the wells of Saboun, which
are not far from the Fasher, and in more distant places their
boldness is still greater. Whenever one of these Afrits loves a
woman, he marries her in spite of all opposition. One of them
declared his love for a young girl, and asked her in marriage; but
she detested and refused him. He persisted, and went every evening,
killing the suitors he found there. He thus frightened every one
away, but without succeeding in winning her affections. She almost
passed the marriageable age. However, one day, a stranger beheld
her at the market-place, and loved her, and followed her, and
accosted her, declaring his sentiments.

âIn truth,â said she, âthou art a handsome fellow, and I love
thee already; but, as the proverb says, âthere is an obstacle in
the way of the ass.ââ

âArt thou married?â

âNo.â

âWhat withholds thee, then?â

âWhat? why, one of those savage Afrits has forbidden any one to
approach me.â

âWhy does he not marry thee?â

âI do not love him, and will not have him.â

âIs he related to thee?â

âNo! by Heaven!â

âWell, then, fear nothing, and I will release thee from
him.â

[277]
âThat is not so
easy,â said she; âand yet, by Heaven, I am not a coward, and do not
fear the Afrit! It is for thee that I fear, lest he assassinate
thee.â

âBe easy on that point,â replied he; âbut only show me thy
dwelling.â

She did so; and at nightfall the stranger came, and they sat
down, and began to talk quietly together, he sitting with his leg
over that of the young girl. The Afrit soon came in, and saw them
sitting together. The girl wished to move away, but her new lover
kept her in her position, and continued the conversation. The Afrit
then exclaimed, âWho allowed thee to come here?â but obtained no
answer. He spoke twice more, and then, rushing forward, stabbed the
stranger through the thigh, until he reached that of the girl. She
tried to escape, but could not; and the Afrit, struck dumb by the
phlegm of his rival, who still did not move, drew forth his weapon,
and wished to escape. But he was now seized and cast to the ground,
and humiliated, and compelled to swear that he would never again
interfere with the girl, who was soon afterwards united in marriage
with her deliverer. Similar adventures are of frequent occurrence
in WadaÃ¯.

A singular feature in the character of the WadaÃ¯ans is, that
they are jealous of a mistress, but take no care to interfere with
the conduct of their sisters or daughters. They even often seek to
bring admirers to their sisters, by praising their beauty and
physical qualities. And if any one is thus incited
[278]
to come forward as a suitor,
the brother pleads for him, and is angry if he be rejected.
Sometimes the WadaÃ¯ans carry their complaisance so far, that they
take friends to their wives, and leave them with them. The women
themselves are licentiously inclined, and often have many lovers.
In fact, throughout all Soudan, love seems to be the great
occupation. It runs fiery through the veins of the blacks, as sap
runs through the veins of trees. No one thinks it a duty to conceal
the object of passion, except when danger may arise. Otherwise, he
goes about publishing the name of her he loves, and shouting it in
every ear. But let us now pause, for if we dwell too long upon one
subject we shall engender weariness.

The
people of Soudan do
not, in general, possess muskets, or cannons, or fortresses. In
battle, their horsemen are armed with the javelin and the sabre,
and the footmen with the spear or the arrow. The latter has a
buckler to protect himself, and the former a helmet or coat of
mail, or a padded tunic. Horses are covered with thick housing to
protect them against injury.

Each people has a certain traditional system of tactics, which
it clings to, and will not alter or improve in any way. The Forians
divide their army into five divisions,âthe vanguard, the
rear-guard, the main body, and the right and left wings. The
vedettes and scouts are spread all around during the march. Every
great functionary has a military
[280]
character. The flags or standards are
always placed in front of the Sultan, under the command of the king
and a body of chosen men. The Forian flags are either red or white,
and so are those of WadaÃ¯, except that in the latter country the
red are more common. The Forian Sultan is preceded by ten banners,
and the WadaÃ¯an by at least thirty, which are never lowered unless
the prince is killed or taken prisoner. No Sultan must fly after a
battle, so that in case of defeat he must be killed or taken
prisoner. As long as the fight lasts, the drums do not cease a
moment to beat.

On the eve of a battle, each party chooses some sign by which
the soldiers are to be distinguished; as, for example, a band of
bark round the right wrist. In the absence of this precaution, as
soon as the
mÃªlÃ©e
begins, it would be impossible to know
friends from enemies, for there are no uniforms and no distinctions
of colour.

When the Forian troops charge an enemy they display great
animation. The horsemen brandish their swords, and each chief of a
Kardous, or squadron, sets up a song, to which his men reply. At
the time of the revolt of Mohammed Kourra I heard an Emin sing
these words:ââO-nas dio-ba-in,â which means, âThe word which you
have in you;â and the soldiers replied, Kel-boaââCome, say it.â
Then the chief went on, âO-nas dio-Keih,â and the soldiers
answered, Kel-boa ye kel-boaââCome, say it: ha! ha! say it.â In
this way they worked
[281]
up their courage, and each seemed to become
an inexpugnable tower.

The armour of the Forians is of various kinds, consisting of
casques with falls of mail, that cover the shoulders and protect
the neck, or of mere head-pieces. Some horsemen have cuirasses
covered with crocodilesâ skin; and, in the infantry, I have seen
bucklers made of the same material. When a cavalier is fully armed
and equipped, mounted upon a horse completely clothed with red, he
does in reality present a terrible appearance, even alone; but a
thousand men, thus arranged, form a really terrific spectacle. When
a high-placed functionary has been removed, and another by intrigue
substituted, the two generally consider themselves as enemies.
When, therefore, a battle begins, the man who has been disgraced
seeks out his rival, and cries:âYa wendai Bism Illah,ââCome,
comrade, on, in the name of God.â If the person thus challenged
complies, and behaves with courage, no more is said; but, if not,
the affair is reported to the Sultan, and the former occupant is
restored to his place. Similar challenges take place between
subjects who have never occupied any position. If one of them plays
the poltroon, his wife generally asks for a divorce, and no one
seeks his daughter or his sister in marriage.

Foot soldiers, when they go into battle, collect their drapery
like a shawl round their waist, and tuck up their sleeves. Each man
has a buckler and
[282]

three, four, or five lances, one of which is a long pike, whilst
the others are javelins for throwing. It was Zou-Yezen, a
Hamyaritic prince, who first armed the tops of lances with iron.
Before his time sharp horns were used. There are various kinds of
spears used in Darfur, the shafts of which are sometimes made of
ebony wood, and sometimes of hard roots of trees straightened by
fire. The iron heads now used are of various forms, some of them
being smooth, others serrated, others with heavy balls of iron, to
increase the force of the blow. Formerly the people of Soudan used
to have large bucklers as high as themselves; but these were found
to be inconvenient, and small shields used with dexterity supply
their place. The best are made of the skin of an aquatic animal
called issins. Others are manufactured, as I have said, of the skin
of the crocodile, or of the rhinoceros. The worst are those made of
elephant-skin, which, though thick, are easily pierced by a lance.
Bows and arrows are not used by the Muslim blacks of Soudan, but
they have companies of archers composed of Pagan slaves, who form a
redoubtable element in their armies. In the time of the revolt of
Sheikh Kourra, it was these slave-archers who prevented, one
evening after dark, the insurgents from penetrating into the
dwelling of the Sultan. I was a witness of this scene. The archers,
to the number of a thousand, overwhelmed the partisans of Kourra
with a shower of arrows, and forced them to retreat with great
loss.
[283]
The archers
do not aim straight at the enemy, but cause their arrows to
describe a curve in the air. The heads are of the same form as
those of the lances, and are often so slightly fixed to the reed
that they are left in the wound. They are often poisoned. The bows
are wonderfully small, scarcely more than a span in length, and the
arrows are still shorter. The wood used is very hard, and the
strings are made of the tendons of buffaloes. The quivers consist
in a little sack, in which are carried sometimes as many as two
hundred arrows.

When the infantry is ranged in order of battle, it sings various
kinds of songs; for example, this one:ââLellee Lellee, let us go.
The dust of the battle rises in the east. Ask the buffalo if his
helmet be brilliant. The buffalo is in the midst of our horsemen.
Fear shame, soldiers; fear shame. The buffalo shall meet with his
like.â This song, chanted in unison by a vast body of soldiers,
appeared to me in the original very exciting, but, like all other
songs, it loses by translation. The captains begin the first line,
and the men take up the burthen. The corps of Fertyt, specially
attached to the person of the prince, sing a song of which I could
never obtain any translation. These slaves are in great number in
Darfur, but spread throughout the country at separate stations.

Horses form, for the Soudan populations, one of the most
precious articles of property. The Prophet said,ââTo the manes of
coursers shall be attached
[284]
victory to the end of the world.â The
Dongola and Egyptian breeds are much sought after in Darfur. The
former have long legs, brilliant coats, and are generally black;
but the Egyptian horses are better proportioned and more graceful,
and are easily trained for war. They are generally bay. Those which
are preferred are of middle height, with moderately long legs, slim
and short barrels, broad buttocks, and well-developed chest. The
grooms train them to singular habits, teaching them cleanliness
during great ceremonies, and compelling them, when necessary, to
remain for hours perfectly tranquil, like statues. If any horse
ridden by the Sultan commits any act of impropriety, he is
immediately dismounted and sent home to be beaten.

When I was in Darfur I often admired the elegance and grace of
the steeds of the Sultan. On asking the grooms how they succeeded
in producing these qualities, I was told that the animals were fed
on green food from the neighbourhood of Mount Koussa, and on a kind
of paste made of millet mixed with honey. Every morning also they
drink warm milk.

The horses of Forian breed are abominable hacks, with round
bellies and savage characters. I never saw such indocile brutes. It
is almost impossible to keep them to any particular course. They
are, however, very hard and sturdy, and capable of supporting
immense fatigue.

But the best horses in Darfur are those of the
[285]
Bedawin Arabs, which are
directly derived from Arabia. They are carefully fed in the
pasturages, given warm milk to drink, and constantly rubbed down
with melted butter. The Bedawin, in his solitary plains, fasten for
the night, to the leg of his horse, an iron shackle with a long
chain, fixed to his bed. The horse, accustomed to attacks, to
flights, to forays, and incursions of every kind, hears the
slightest noise in the dark, and, if it be at all suspicious,
neighs and stamps on the ground to wake its master. By day it is
always piquetted near the tent. At whatever hour it may be, as soon
as any cry of alarm is heard, the women of the tribe instantly
saddle the horses, whilst the Bedawin gets ready his arms, so that,
in the twinkling of an eye, there is a body of cavalry ready to
ride out of the camp.
[55]

The Arabs value their horses at extravagant prices, especially
if they have acquired any reputation. Sometimes a four-year-old
mare with its foal sells for the price of a hundred cows. The
dearest horses are the runners of three kamins, or relays; for
there are steeds which run races of one, two, or three kamins.
Sometimes a horse is pitted to run
[286]
three relays, and starts with ten
competitors for the distance of an hour. Then there are ten other
competitors ready to take up the race, and so on for another time.
It often happens that a horse wins these three races successively.
In Darfur and WadaÃ¯ there are sometimes found horses worthy of
emulating the Arabs for their swiftness and vigour. The following
narrative is curious, in reference to this subject:âAn inhabitant
of Dar-Tamah once bought a very young foal of noble blood, and
trained it with most careful attention. When it was old enough he
exercised it constantly, and found that it had no rival in speed.
It happens that, between Tamah and WadaÃ¯, there is a ravine or
chasm in the earth, about two kosabah broad, that is to say, about
six fathoms. The Tamahan resolved to peril his life, and see if he
could leap this ravine. He succeeded several times, and, being now
sure of his safety, began riding him to the border provinces of
WadaÃ¯, and hanging about the wells where the young girls used to
come and fetch water. Whenever he perceived any one that pleased
him by her beauty, he used to snatch her up and ride away with her.
Her friends would pursue, thinking that the ravine would be an
insurmountable obstacle to his flight. But the bold Tamahan always
leaped the chasm and escaped in safety.
[56]

In some countries of Soudan there exist very singular ideas
relative to horses. Among others, it
[287]
is said that a man had a magnificent
courser, of whom he was passionately fond, and visited night and
day. One night, however, he went softly, at an unaccustomed hour,
to see him, and beheld great wings spreading out from his side. The
man was petrified with fear, and the horse, suddenly closing up and
concealing his wings, said,ââThe first time that thou comest,
without warning me of thy approach, thou shalt repent.â The people
of Darfur, in fact, are persuaded that the swiftness of horses
arises from their having real, but invisible, wings. They also
believe that these animals have a language of their own, and
possess certain human sentiments, as, for example, modesty. On
certain occasions they throw great veils over their stallions and
their mares.

A Forian possessed a horse which had often saved his life by his
speed, and which he carefully tended. His wife died and he married
again. The new wife sometimes gave the horse its ration mixed with
dust, and left the litter untidy. The man, too, since his new
marriage, no longer attended on his beast with the same care. One
day he was in great danger and could not escape. He was made
prisoner with his horse and reduced to groom it. He now carefully
cleaned and attended on the animal, who one day said to him,ââThis
is the recompense of the man who neglects his horse.â The man was
frightened and remained still, and the horse went on,ââFear
nothing, there is no harm. Wilt
[288]
thou promise me, if I restore thee to
liberty, always to have the same care of me that thou hast now?â âI
promise it.â âWell, then, unloose me, mount, and fear not.â The
Forian did as he was required, and succeeded, in spite of a
pursuit, in escaping.

The Temourkeh have fancies of a different kind. They believe
that, when one of them dies, after remaining three days in his
tomb, he is transported to another country, and marries a new wife.
The Massalit imagine that every one of them, after death, passes
into the body of some animalâof a hyÃ¦na, for example, or a cat.

To return to the subject of horses. Bays, with white feet and a
white star on the forehead, are often celebrated by poets, who
improvise verses for the sake of reward, in the presence of the
Sultan. They are generally nomadic Arabs; the blacks having little
poetical taste. Sometimes, under learned princes, there have been
Ulemas distinguished as poets. The Forians derive auguries from
certain motions of their horses. If they stretch the fore legs
abroad, victory is expected; but if the hind legs, defeat.

All these customs and ideas, which I have described as Forian,
may be applied almost exactly to WadaÃ¯, especially those which have
reference to war. The WadaÃ¯ans, however, are less particular in
their military adornments, and do not sing in battle.

The Fertyt do not possess horsesâoxen are the only domestic
animals they know. In most tribes
[289]
the women act as beasts of burthen. When in
war, they place their king on a kind of ebony stool, borne by
relays of four men.

If they are defeated, they set his majesty down and leave him,
for no Sultan must fly. However, according to ancient custom, no
prince is killed in a
mÃªlÃ©e
, except by accident. If he be
taken prisoner, he is generally treated with respect. Kadis,
Ulemas, and musicians, are also spared, if taken, and set free. It
is not customary, however, if free women and children are taken, to
sell them as slaves, although Saboun did so, as an exemplary
punishment, when he took Bagirmeh.

The Ghazwah, or slave-hunts, in Dar-Fertyt, and amongst the
Jenakherah, are carried on in a different manner in Darfur and
WadaÃ¯. In the latter country, the Sultan sends one of his governors
with a troop, chosen beforehand, to which no strangers attach
themselves; but in Darfur things are managed differently. There,
even a private individual, if he thinks himself capable of
conducting a Ghazwah, demands a salatieh, and, if he obtains it,
sets out with as many people as he can collect.

This is the way in which a complete Ghazia, or Ghazwah, is
managed. He who can make a present to the Sultan, and who has some
friend at court, goes to the Fasher in the first day of summer,
some time before the beginning of the rains. The best offering to
make to a Sultan is a horse ready bridled and saddled, with a slave
to lead him. If the prince accepts
[290]
the present, and permits the expedition, he
gives to the solicitor a salatieh, that is to say, a tall lance,
and delivers a permission of excursion, conceived, for example, in
the following terms:â

âIn the name of the Great Sultan, the refuge and the support of
all, the glory of the Arab kings and of the non-Arab kings, master
of the neck of all nations, sovereign of the two lands and the two
seas, servant of the two holy cities, putting his hope in the God
of justice and longanimity, the Sultan Mohammed Fadhl, the
victorious, to all those who these presents may see, emins,
warriors, shartai, damleg, and chiefs of our armies,

âWe, Sultan favoured of God, sustained by his special grace,
victorious Sultan, have gratified with our favours and our
benevolence
such an one
, son of
such an one
, and
have given to him a salatieh to conduct an expedition into
Dar-Fertyt, and make a Ghazwah, in the direction of
such a
tribe
. All those who may accompany him in his enterprise shall
be free from blame on our partâin testimony of which the present
firman has emanated from our sublime generosity and our noble
bounties. Far, far, may all opposition be, all acts of malevolence,
against this mandate. We have recommended to the bearer of this
permission to act with justice towards those who may follow this
expedition, and to conduct himself with the equity and the
moderation which the fear of God inspires, as regards the portion
of slaves that is to fall to his share. Salutations.â

[291]
Supplied with
the firman of this kind, and with the salatieh, which confers the
authority of chief of a Ghazwah, the solicitor leaves the dwelling
of the Sultan, and, accompanied by one or two servants, places
himself on the great square of the Fasher. There he crouches on a
carpet which is spread upon the ground, and the salatieh is stuck
up before him. Meanwhile a domestic beats a tambourine. People
begin to collect from all sides and crowd around him, and learn
that he has been named chief of a Ghazwah, and has obtained a
firman. Merchants soon come forward with stuffs for garments. The
chief buys as much as he pleases, according to the presumed profit
of his expedition, and always on credit. The price varies according
to circumstances. For example, when a merchant wishes himself to
accompany the expedition, and the quantity of goods he has sold is
worth only one slave at the Fasher, the chief of the Ghazwah agrees
to deliver five or six slaves in the Dar-Fertyt itself; but if, on
the contrary, the merchant does not choose to follow the
expedition, and prefers waiting till it returns, he agrees to
receive only two or three slaves. When the bargain is concluded,
the master of the salatieh gives to the merchant a written
acknowledgment. In this way he collects, not only garments, but
horses, camels, asses, &c. Some chiefs, who inspire confidence,
contract in this way for more than five or six hundred slaves.

While these preliminaries are going on, many people come and
offer to associate themselves with
[292]
the leader of the expedition; and he then
causes to be transcribed several copies of his firman, and gives
one to each, with a horse or camel for the journey.

He also points out to these, his first hunting companions, the
road they are to take, and divides them into ten squads, each of
which has a chief. The rendezvous is always beyond the southern
limits of Darfur.

Each chief of a squad now takes a different route, and passes
through the towns and villages beating a tambourine, collecting the
inhabitants, communicating the contents of the firman, pointing out
the conditions offered by the undertaker of the hunt, and
promising, for example, that the owner of the salatieh will only
take, at the first jebayeh, or division of spoil, the third of the
slaves which each hunter has taken, and at the second division a
quarter. Generally a certain number of young Forians, of poor
families, join the expedition.

The master of the salatieh also stops in the places which he
traverses to collect companions, and having rested awhile in his
own village, proceeds to the general rendezvous. Once there, he
takes the title of Sultan, and composes a kind of court out of
those to whom he has delivered copies of the firman. There have
been sultans of Ghazwah who have found themselves at the head of
nine or ten thousand people or more. His court is a perfect
imitation of the court of the real Sultan. He delivers clothes to
his body-guard, and distributes to them his camels, his asses, and
his horses. Sometimes
[293]
a great many people come flocking in
without having been recruited; but all are obliged to admit the
absolute authority of this temporary sultan.

The rules of distribution of the products of the hunt are fixed
and known. All slaves taken without resistance fall to the lot of
the sultan, amongst whose perquisites, likewise, are the presents
given by the kings of the adjoining provinces. The expedition
pushes on as far as it can, and then one evening it is announced
that the division of profit is to be made the next day. This
division takes place as follows:âThe sultan causes a circular
enclosure, or zeribeh, with two openings, to be made. The people of
the Ghazwah come early in the morning with the slaves they have
caught. If the sultan is reasonable, he takes only a third, but he
sometimes exacts one-half. The zeribeh is made of prickly branches.
The sultan sits in the middle, and his servants station themselves
at the issues. Then all the slave-catchers, one by one, bring in
their lots, the number of which is immediately written down. If
there are only two, the sultan takes the better, and the other is
left to his owner, who receives a paper, certifying that he has
submitted to the law of partition. He who has only taken one slave
is put aside until another in the same predicament comes, when the
sultan takes one and leaves the other to be divided. All those kept
by the sultan remain in the zeribeh. This ceremony lasts sometimes
ten days, or even a month.

[294]
When the
division has been made, the master of the salatieh pays his debts,
and then continues the hunt, returning, however, towards Darfur.
When within a few daysâ march there is a second division made.

The sultan is entitled to every disputed slave, and to the
property of all who die, without direct heirs, on the road. He,
however, is obliged to take from his share the presents to be made
to the Sultan and to the great people who have assisted him in
obtaining his privilege.

The master of a salatieh, when the excursion has been fortunate,
easily acquits all expenses, pays his debts, makes the necessary
presents, and has a hundred slaves left for himself. Besides this,
the horses, the camels, the asses, and all the harness and baggage
brought back, remain as his property. He resumes possession of
everything he has distributed, except the garments. In fine, each
individual returns to his country with the booty which, by the
grace of God, he has been able to take.

The leader of a hunt always treats with consideration the people
who compose his court, and sometimes does not take from them any of
their share. On the other hand, it is they who watch over his
safety, and attend to him. At each halt they get ready a shelter
for him, and send people forward to prepare each station. For this
purpose, they bring with them from Darfur skins of animals,
millet-stalks, and poles sufficient to make every day
[295]
an enclosure or dwelling for
the sultan. These materials are carried from camp to camp. In fine,
the whole ceremonial of this expedition resembles the march of a
real Sultan.

When the troops surround one of the stations of the Fertyt, and
the inhabitants yield without resistance, the sultan takes the
chief as a prisoner, treats him honourably, gives him a dress, and
afterwards liberates him; but he seizes on all the grown men, the
youths, the women, and girls, leaving only the old people and those
who do not seem to be in a state to undergo the fatigues of a
journey. The leader of a hunt may form or break alliances with
tribes who agree to become tributary to Darfur; but he is obliged
to act according to the rules of justice and equity. At any rate,
he is induced to behave well towards his subordinates, by the hope
of taking them along with him another year.

One of the duties of the officers of the sultan is to search out
the nests in which the Fertyt hide their grain; for, finding
themselves constantly attacked by their neighbours, these people
conceal their provisions in the trees so carefully, that an
unaccustomed traveller would never suspect their existence. They
choose for this purpose trees which are very leafy and tufty. They
cut a certain number of branches, with which they make a kind of
large hurdle; on this they spread, first, a bed of leaves, and then
a bed of millet-husks; then they build thereon a little conical
hut, in which they pile their
[296]
grain, and, closing up the opening, leave
it until they require it for their use. The thickness of the
leaves, and the intricacy of the branches, entirely conceal these
aÃ«rial barns. The whole country is covered with monstrous trees
growing in forests, so that it is not easy to discover these
stores.

The Fertyt who inhabit the highlands bury their grain in
matmourah, or deep pits, lined with millet leaves. The Forians also
keep their corn in matmourah, though the rich deposit their
harvests in vast sheds.

The men who obtain permission to go upon slave-hunts have their
itinerary marked down beforehand, and it is forbidden to overpass
the limits set. This is done to prevent different Ghazwah from
meeting and fighting one with the other. The Sultan sometimes
delivers sixty or seventy salatieh in the course of a year; but
many of these expeditions are not important in number. They
sometimes consist of as few as fifteen men. These hunts bring into
the hands of the Forians a considerable number of slaves. If they
all arrived in Darfur, the country would be overstocked; but many
of them die of ill-treatment during the journey, or are killed. If
a slave, from fatigue or other reasons, determines not to proceed,
he sits down and says, âKongorongo,â that is to say, âKill me.â He
is instantly killed with clubs in presence of his companions, in
order to frighten them, and deter them from imitating his example.
Women are treated in the same manner. Many of the
prisoners
[297]
die of
fatigue by the way, and others of diarrhÅa, caused by change of
food. Sometimes epidemic diseases, such as dysentery, seize the
whole flock, and nearly all perish. Two or three out of twenty are
often all that survive. On arriving in Darfur many also perish from
the effects of the climate, though such as are treated with
gentleness, and are submitted to a proper regimen, generally
survive. Acclimated slaves sell for a much higher price than those
who have been recently brought.

But, in any case, this sudden change of condition exposes the
slaves to dangerous diseases. Moreover, melancholy seizes them,
especially if they fear to be sold to stranger Arabs. They are
persuaded that these Arabs are in want of meat, and come and buy
them for food, and to use their brains for soap, and their blood
for dyeing garments red. This belief is deeply implanted in the
minds of all the slaves, and the Forians take advantage of it to
reduce the indocile by fear. It is sufficient to threaten to sell
them to the Jellabs to bring them to a sense of duty. The slaves do
not get quit of their fear until they have been some time in the
hands of the Arabs; but, during the whole length of the journey,
they remain in continual terror. If we add to this cause the
excessive fatigue of the march, the extremes of heat and cold in
the deserts, it will not appear surprising that they die by
thousands on the way. Only the very strong or the very fortunate
reach as far as Egypt. I have seen Jellabs leave WadaÃ¯ with
a
[298]
hundred slaves,
and lose them all by cold; and others have been deprived of still
greater numbers by heat and thirst; whilst others, again, out of a
single flock, find not one wanting. All this depends on the will of
the Most High.

Our holy law permits the sale and exportation of slaves, but on
the express condition that we should act with the fear of God
before our eyes; which sentiment, indeed, should be the guide of
all our actions. The reasons by which slavery is justified are
these:â God has commanded his Prophet, the Prophet of Islam, to
announce the Divine law to men, to call them to believe in the true
God, and to employ the force of arms to constrain unbelievers to
embrace the true faith. According to the Divine word itself, war is
the legitimate and holy means to bring men under the yoke of
religion; for as soon as the infidels feel the arms of Islam, and
see their power humiliated, and their families led away into
slavery, they will desire to enter into the right way, in order to
preserve their persons and their goods. If they resist, and are
obstinate in their unbelief, it is necessary to march in arms
against them. However, before resorting to this extreme means, we
must invite them to submit to the law of Islam, and warn them many
times on the misfortunes they will bring upon themselves by their
incredulity.

But the Prophet has also authorised the ransom of prisoners.
âAfter the fight,â he says, âyou may give liberty to prisoners or
accept a ransom for them,
[299]
in order to put a stop to the calamities of
war. As for those who obstinately repel my law, and reject the
religion of Islam, offer them the choice between war and the
obligation of an annual tribute, by which they may buy security and
life. If they take up arms against you, whoever is made captive
shall be sold.â Nevertheless, all men, as children of Adam, are
equal; the only difference being, that some have adopted the faith
of Islam, and others a different, that is, an erroneous faith.

The inhabitants of Muslim Soudan, in their excursions against
the idolaters, do not observe what is prescribed by the word of
God, and never call upon them before the attack to embrace
Islamism. They rush suddenly on the tribes of the Fertyt and
Jenakherah, and, without preliminaries, without appeal to faith,
without pacific attempts at proselytism, they assail, combat, take
them as slaves, and sell them. But the fact of capture once
accomplished, these people, being idolaters, it becomes lawful for
Muslims to sell them. He who has acquired possession of a slave,
man or woman, is bound to conduct himself towards him or her
according to the principles of justice and religion. He must not
exact from his slaves too great an amount of work. He must feed
them with the food which he prepares for himself and his family,
and he must clothe them with care; for a slave is likewise the
creature of God.

Captives are treated in exactly the same manner in Darfur and
WadaÃ¯, but there is a difference in the
[300]
way in which slave-hunts are carried on. In
the former country, although the authority comes direct from the
Sultan, he has nothing to do with the details. But in WadaÃ¯, where
there is greater respect for the sovereign power, a general is
chosen to perform a Ghazwah, and nearly the whole product goes into
the hands of the Sultan. The slaves taken on these occasions are
all equally without belief in God, without knowledge of a Prophet
or revelation, without religion or civil law. They adore blocks of
stone, and build chapels for these divinities, and make offerings
to them of lances and rods of iron. I had once a slave from
Dar-Binah, who, hearing mention of God, observed that his God was
much greater than ours. I asked him what he meant, and he said his
God was so large, holding his hands at a certain distance the one
from the other. I told him that there was only one God for all the
world, for all countries, and all climates; that he was great,
powerful, and invisible; and I repeated these words until my slave
understood them. The ignorance of these people, and their want of
authoritative traditions, render it easy to instil a new religion
into them. I have seen a young girl learn the Muslim profession of
faith the very day of her capture, and repeat it without emotion or
surprise.

These people are wonderfully ignorant, and only learn that there
are other men on the face of the earth besides themselves by the
periodical appearance of the Ghazwah. They have many
singular
[301]
customs;
among others, they are very particular in preventing marriage
within certain degrees of consanguinity. This is more remarkable,
because both sexes constantly mix together nearly entirely naked.
Women and men wear only a little apron, or cover themselves with
leaves. By what inspiration have they been able to establish and
preserve more rigid restrictions than Muslims?

All these people lead a poor and miserable life; yet they
passionately love their country, and cling to the place which has
given them birth. If they leave their villages and their huts, or
are taken away into slavery, their thoughts and their desires carry
them constantly back to their country. In their childlike
simplicity they often fly away from their masters, to endeavour to
return to their miserable dwelling-places; and, when they are
pursued, they are always found toiling back on the direct road.
They are so simple-minded, that although every year their country
is ravaged by slave-hunts, those that escape always return to the
old spot and reconstruct their villages, and wait until they are
again disturbed.

I have already said that they take one precaution, namely, to
hide their store of grain in the trees. Some also build their
dwelling-places there, cutting out a space amidst the branches, and
constructing a conical hut, well secured against the rain. To this
nest the Fertyt and his wife climb up by means of the nobs and
projections of the trunk.
[302]
Sometimes a single tree bears the
grain-store and the hut; but they are generally separate.

These savages have wonderful skill in certain arts. The shafts
of their javelins and lances are admirably polished; and the ebony
stools they make would do credit to the workshops of the most
civilised nations. But, when we consider their miserable existence,
and how they are deprived of all that contributes to the enjoyment
of life, such as agreeable food and proper garments, we must class
them among the lowest savages. Glory be to the Eternal, who has
distributed societies in various forms, according to his
pleasure!

Thirst of the Desert.

When
I arrived in WadaÃ¯, my
father, as I have said, had departed for Tunis. He thought it was
my fault that I had delayed so long to come and join him; for he
had written to the Sultan of Darfur and the Fakih Malik, praying
them to allow me to depart. Confiding, therefore, the care of his
house, his children, and his crops, to my uncle Zarouk, he had
departed. This annoyed me much, and I resolved not to lay down the
staff of the traveller, but to hasten after my father. The kindness
of Sultan Saboun, however, made me stay. He sent me as presents
many fine horses, beautiful slaves, and robes of price, which
softened my sorrow. But as Ahmed-el-Fasi had succeeded my father in
the post of vizier, and was a personal enemy, I soon
[304]
found that he was undermining
me. The Sultan began to look at me with coldness, and his presents
ceased.

On the other hand, my uncle Zarouk seized on the revenue of my
land, and gave me only sufficient to prevent my dying of hunger. He
forbade me all interference in the management of my fatherâs
property, telling me that I should spend it foolishly. For these
reasons I was soon disgusted with WadaÃ¯, and asked permission of
the Sultan to leave the country and depart for Fezzan. The yearly
caravan was preparing to start. The permission I required was
easily accorded by means of the Shereef Ahmed. I soon got ready,
bought water-skins, provisions, and other necessary articles, and
the day was at length fixed. Then I begged of Sultan Saboun some
camels to carry my baggage; but he only sent me one young one,
incapable as yet of undergoing the fatigue of travelling and
carrying a burden. I complained aloud; but the Shereef Ahmed abused
me for my greediness, and said the Sultan owed me nothing. I
suppressed my disappointment, and exchanged the young camel and a
little additional money for a strong one, and thereupon left Warah.
But the caravan had scarcely reached the district of the
Beni-Mahamyd, on the edge of the desert, when some messengers from
Saboun brought me as a present from him three young slave-girls, a
male slave, two excellent camels, and a fat bull, with which to
make
cadyd
, or dried meat. We killed the bull at
[305]
once, and began to prepare the
cadyd, giving thanks to the Sultan. When the meat was dried we
filled our skins once more and departed. We had already received
the visit of the inspectors, whose business it is to see that we
are not taking away any free persons into slavery. Every slave in
the caravan, young and old, was questioned individually. The
inspectors liberate every one who can show himself to be of free
origin, or prove that he was a Muslim before he was taken; also,
any slave that may have been fraudulently taken from his owner.

For five days at the outset of our journey we traversed great
plains of pasturage, where the Mahamyd wander with their flocks. At
the end of this time we reached a well, at which it is customary
for the Arabs, even Bidegats from the north-east of WadaÃ¯ and other
wandering tribes, to encamp and meet the caravan,âholding a kind of
fair,âselling or letting out to the Jellabs, or the travellers,
provisions, camels, utensils for the journey, skins, ropes, &c.
God is my witness that I forget the name of the well. We halted
there two days, and the camels were turned loose to feed.

Five days more took us to the well of Daum, so called from the
trees of that name that surround it. Now it happened that our
guide, or caravan master, named Ahmed, was an old man, who had
passed the vicissitudes of this life. He belonged to a tribe of the
Tibboos, named in Fezzan the Tibboo-Reshad,âor Tibboos of the
Mountains. Ahmed had formerly
[306]
killed a member of another tribe; and ever
since the people had been waiting for the opportunity of vengeance.
After the accident, the murderer had fled to Dar-Seleih. Here he
remained ten years, not daring to return to his tribe; but at
length the love of home became too strong, and he desired to see
his country, and the huts thereof, with his ancient dwelling-place.
He believed that in ten years his visit would be forgotten; and he
departed with our caravan as a guide, leaving a comfortable
position in WadaÃ¯, where he had amassed wealth, which, along with
his age, produced him great respect, and allowed him to fear
nothing but God.

When he started with us he had with him more than a hundred and
thirty persons, all relatives. The rest of the caravan was composed
of fifteen WadaÃ¯ans and five Arabs, myself, a man of Tripoli, named
the Reis Abdallah; a Fezzani, Mohammed Khayr Yasir; another
Fezzani, the Seid Ahmed, from the village of Zouylah; and one named
Khalyl, of Tripoli. In proceeding towards the well of Daum we lost
our way in the desert, and fearing, if we moved on, that we should
only lose time, we halted, made our camels kneel, and buried our
water-skins, as deep as possible, beneath the baggage, to preserve
them from the heat of the sun. Our caravan started, Ahmed took with
him a certain number of his cousins, and searched through the
desert to the right and to the left, seeking for the well which we
ought by this time to have reached.
[307]
They remained a long time absent, and the
day was far advanced when they returned. Their faces were grey with
dust; but they brought joyful tidings, namely, that the well was
near at hand. So we urged on our camels, and at last beheld the
daum-trees in the distance. Every one began to cry out, âThere they
are! there they are! Those are the trees under which we are to rest
this day!â We had scarcely uttered these words, when we beheld in
front of us a troop of the Tibboos, called Turkman-Tibboos, and
felt alarm. They rarely come to meet caravans, for they station
towards Libya, divided into peoples of varying numbers, each with a
Sultan, or king. The tribe that had met us had its principal
station at a place called Marmar. They had known, for two or three
months, by means of a traveller from WadaÃ¯, that the master of our
caravan was to be Ahmed, against whom they had a blood-feud; and it
was for this reason that they waylaid us on our journey.

They stood right in our path, and sent forward a man on a camel,
who galloped rapidly towards us, as swift as a horse. It is
marvellous to see how skilfully these Tibboo tribes manage their
dromedaries, or riding-camels. They train and exercise them like
horses, to numerous delicate manÅuvres, and have no other rein but
the
zimÃ¢m
, or light cord, which by one end is tied to a hole
pierced in the moving edge of the animalâs nostril. Nearly all
these marauding Tibboos are clothed in sheep-skins with
[308]
the wool on. He who advanced
towards us had the litham over his face; that is to say, part of
the stuff of his turban was wrapped three or four times round his
head and visage, so that the eyes only were to be seen. When he was
near to us he cried out, in his own language,ââHo! people of the
caravan, the Sultan is coming with his soldiers to the well. He
forbids you to approach it. Know that you shall only do so when you
have given up your guide to be killed, in expiation of the murder
of one of our brothers. What are your intentions? Tell me, that I
may inform the Sultan.â

One of the Tibboos of our caravan translated what the messenger
said, and we all decided at once that we would not deliver up Ahmed
to his enemies, and that if the Tibboos asked only for a ropeâs end
they should not have it. âRetrace thy steps,â said we to the envoy,
âand tell thy master that we have nothing to do with himâthat we
have no one to give up. Go!â

The messenger galloped swiftly away to report our answer, and
the Sultan prepared to attack us. Then the Tibboos, who formed part
of our caravan, separated from us, and, with the exception of Ahmed
and his family, went off to some distance. Our party, counting
Ahmed, only contained twenty-five individuals,
[57]

not counting the slaves, who were in
[309]
great numbers. As we approached the well,
the Tibboos advanced in a mass, all mounted two-and-two on about
sixty or seventy camels. They rushed towards us, furiously casting
their javelins. We, that is to say the five Arabs, waited for their
approach, and fired a volley at them. Surprised, they turned back
and fled like beaten wolves. We remained masters of the well, and
encamped there. We drank, and allowed our camels to pasture on the
wild herbage of the neighbourhood.

We thought that these savage Tibboos, whom we had so easily put
to flight, had returned to their dwelling-places, and we rested at
our well for two whole days; but, on the third, we suddenly heard
loud cries and frightful imprecations. We sent to see what was the
matter, and saw four camels resting near a body of armed people.
Near them was our guide Ahmed, who stood amidst his people and the
WadaÃ¯ans of our caravan. With the armed strangers was an old man,
who seemed to be their chief. He had a piece of carpet tissue
rolled round his head, four or six fingers in breadth, and about a
cubit long. This old man was crouching down, like a dog or a hyÃ¦na,
on his heels. The chief of the WadaÃ¯ans said to him,â

âWherefore dost thou return? Thou hadst departed. What dost thou
want? What dost thou expect?â

âKnow,â was the reply, âthat I am the Sultan of these deserts;
and that I have as many soldiers
[310]
as you can count. What do I want? I come to
advise you to deliver up Ahmed, if you wish to depart without blows
or wounds. I know that you and I are not at war, but if you refuse
my request there will be danger. That Ahmed slew my cousin, whom I
loved as if he had been the son of my mother. It is my duty to
avenge my cousin, and cleanse myself from the shame of leaving that
murder unpunished.â

âBut,â said the WadaÃ¯an chief, âart thou not afraid of being
killed as thy cousin was killed?â

âI have no fear. He who kills me will be killed in his turn. We
never forget this dutyânever abandon the vengeance of blood, though
we should be hacked to pieces with a knife.â

At these words of the obstinate old chief, Ahmed flew into a
great rage, and insulted him, and was going to kill him. We
restrained Ahmed; but, taking advantage of the agitation of all
present, he slipped behind the Tibboos, and hamstrung the Sultanâs
camel. Then the Sultan said to him,â âThis, too, thou shalt dearly
pay for. My camel shall be avenged; and I will yet hamstring many
of thy camels. As for you all, not a moment of repose shall you
have. I shall be ever at your heels to torment you.â These words
now irritated the chief of the WadaÃ¯ans, who gave the old Sultan a
heavy blow with his whip over the loins, and said,ââBe off, go to
the devil, and do as thou pleasest! May Heaven confound thee, and
he who begat thee!â

[311]
The Sultan got
up without wincing, and marched off with his men, affecting an air
of contempt, and stifling his anger.

The day passed away. We filled our skins; arranged our luggage;
but next morning, just as we were about to load the beasts of
burden and get ready to march, the cry was heard in the caravan:
âWait, wait; one of the WadaÃ¯an camels has disappeared!â We paused;
and presently afterwards louder cries arose. The caravan was in the
greatest state of alarm; every one inquired what was the matter;
and at last we learned that the Turkman-Tibboos had not only stolen
a camel, but had seized one of our WadaÃ¯ans and slaughtered him. We
divided at once into two parties, one of which hastened to the
place where our companion had been slain, whilst the other remained
to guard the slaves, the baggage, and the Camels. We found the
victim bathed in blood, and struggling in the convulsions of death.
In the distance we saw a cloud of camels, each with two men on its
back, their faces shrouded in black lithams. They looked like crows
perched upon camels. They managed their beasts with wonderful
cleverness, and horses are not more docile and eager in the field
of battle.

One of these Tibboos came forward to our party and cried:
âWhither are you going? what do you expect to do? For the camel of
which you deprived us by ham-stringing yesterday we have taken a
better one. The price of the lash with the whip is
[312]
the life of one of your best
menâthat one who lies killed there. But this is not all; you will
surely repent; and if it were not for your guns we would ride down
on you and cut you all to pieces.â

We answered by firing on the troop in the distance; and they
instantly fled, until they were like black spots on the
horizon.

As for the Tibboos who originally formed part of our caravan,
they remained thenceforward separate from us, marching alone. We
were very much troubled and disquieted, fearing a sudden attack. We
calculated all chances and raised the camp, marching away from the
well; but the Tibboos accompanied us afar off, now and then making
a false charge. They were present all the day long, now
approaching, now flying, manÅuvring all round, till the black night
drew on. Then we halted, needing repose; but the furious Tibboos
left us no peace. In spite of the darkness, one portion of these
kept constantly disturbing us, whilst the other portion slept.
Their object was to wear us out; and as we were few in numbers we
could only get a very little rest. We knew that if any one of us
were taken prisoner by the Tibboos he would instantly be killed. We
dared not make reprisals, even if one of them had come amongst us;
for we knew that this would exasperate them into a general attack.
In their eyes, to kill a man is nothing. We resolved on a system of
passive resistance, merely repelling their attacks. So we marched
on for twenty days in this dreadful
[313]
state, ever in uncertainty and fear, until
we came to the territories of another Sultan,âthe country of the
Tibboo-Reshad, or Tibboos of the Mountains. This is an arid region,
covered with wells: the vegetation is meagre and rare.

But we were now, at length, free from disquietude, and could
rejoice at being delivered from our enemies. It was midday when we
entered the territory of the Tibboo-Reshad; but we continued our
march, and towards evening halted. We now turned out our camels to
graze, having no further fear of the rapacity of the Turkmans; but,
as the sun was setting, we beheld approaching us whole swarms of
the Tibboo-Reshad, who surrounded us like a cloud, though at a
little distance. As each group arrived it alighted and encamped
near the previous comers. We were watching this movement
tranquilly, when we heard in the distance the sound of small
tableh, or tambourines; upon which all the new-comers began crying:
âHere comes the Sultan!â Presently a very common individual, with
his wife behind him, came mounted on a camel. This was the only
woman present. On reaching his people they saluted him, and helped
his queen to dismount. Then they fixed up four stakes, and
surrounded them with a melayeh; making a miserable little tent for
their majesties. A Tibboo came forward and said pompously: âPeople
of the caravan, come and do homage to the Sultan!â We went; and
when we drew near
[314]

this caricature of royalty, we were ordered to sit down in three
rows. An individual, dressed in a sheep-skin, announced himself a
dragoman, and stood in front of us to convey the gracious commands
of his sovereign. It appeared that he expected a good present; and
told us that he wished to eat meat, which he had not done for a
long time, and that he expected us to prepare a meal for the whole
of his people. âMind, be careful in the cookery,â he added; âlet
all be good and soon ready.â We answered that his commands should
be complied with.

Whilst we were at work, the Sultan and his wife came out of
their tent and drew near to us, so that I could examine them at my
leisure. The Sultan was an old man,âdecrepit, dry, lank, with thin
beard, hollow cheeks, awkward gait, and dressed in a blue shirt,
like that sometimes worn in Egypt. His countenance was wrapped in a
black litham, so that he looked like a Copt in an ill-temper. In
his left hand he carried a miserable lance with a broad head; and
in his right a forked stick, used commonly by the Tibboos to drive
their camels and push aside the branches of trees. As for the
Sultana, she was a stunted old lady in a rumpled dress, and looked
comically ugly. Both these potentates prowled through our tents
without addressing a word of politeness to any one. When the supper
was prepared, which was by nightfall, they and their
troop
[315]
ate heartily,
and expressed their satisfaction by ordering a similar repast to be
got ready next day before the rising of the sun.

All this was not very pleasant; and we passed a short,
uncomfortable night. We expected, after breakfast, however, to get
away without further trouble; and, indeed, the strangers allowed us
to depart and travel through the day. But at sunset the Sultan
appeared again with his Tibboos, encamped near us, and claimed
supper again. We began to fear that this famished Sultan would
devour all our provisions. In the morning, having fed him once
more, we proceeded over a rocky road, and by night reached a valley
between three mountains, which we were told was the metropolis of
that kingdom. Of course we had a banquet to prepare, not only for
him and his escort, but for all his people. The hungry wretch,
hearing that we had been attacked, had come to meet us, though,
probably, with no other object than gormandising in this manner.
There was no help. We had to feed the whole people during our stay,
which we were obliged to prolong a little to take in a fresh
provision of water.

The huts of the Tibboo-Reshad are set up at the foot of the
mountains. The country appears sad and miserable, the only riches
being some small flocks of sheep and goats, of which the owners
drink the milk: it is their great luxury. The only trees are the
seyal (
Mimosa seyal
of Forskall) and some
[316]
daums, the fruit of which is
eaten by the Tibboos. When a caravan passes, and a camel dies of
fatigue, these people seize the carcass and divide the flesh,
preparing cadyd from it. The day of our departure, in the morning,
just as we were about to start, I perceived that one of my slaves
was missing. He had escaped during the night, taking with him two
slave-girls, probably in order to sell them. We put off our journey
a day; but I spent money uselessly in endeavouring to get back the
fugitives. This, and other misfortunes, suggested to me the
inflection, that when a man refuses the good that is offered him,
he necessarily is forced to repent afterwards. When the idea of
this unlucky journey presented itself to me, Sultan Saboun tried to
dissuade me from it, advising me to remain in WadaÃ¯ until the
return of my father; but I was obstinate, and suffered in
consequence.

The first of my tribulations was the loss of an excellent ass,
which I prized much. I used to ride it, and preferred it to a
camel. Not very long after we set out there was a frightful plain
of sand, which fatigued our beasts very much. I knew my ass carried
me well, and we often got a good way ahead. So, encouraged by this,
I sat down to rest, and allowed the whole troop to get a long way
ahead of me, thinking it would be easy to catch it up. When I
tried, however, having miscalculated, I found this not easy, and
only succeeded in reaching the rear-guard with great trouble. Now
it happened that
[317]

behind the camels were marching numerous female slaves, one of whom
was of extraordinary beautyâa very pearl. My ass, which was very
tired, ran up to her, and placed itself by her side, as if to ask
the succour of her benevolence, showing her how fatigued it was. I
wished to lure it away; it grew obstinate; I kicked it with my
heels; it stumbled. The young girl and the other slaves began to
laugh at my plight, and say,ââTake away thy ass; go far from us,
and allow us to walk in peace.â It was impossible for me to
overcome the bruteâs obstinacy; so I got down and gave it a kick in
the belly, whereupon it fell dead, as if I had struck it with a
knife. I remained stupified for awhile; but soon took off its
trappings, put them on my shoulders, and with great difficulty
reaching one of my camels, mounted it.

But my mind remained full of the beauty of the slave-girl, and I
began to inquire of what country she was, and who was her master.
It was told me that she belonged to one of our Tibboos, named
Tchay; and I at once went and proposed a bargain. âI will not sell
my slave,â said he, âexcept for four other slaves of the same age;
that is, I shall not sell her at all. I intend her to be the
governess of my house; I am not married; she shall be my wife.â I
insisted, however, and the Tibboo at length agreed to give her to
me for the most beautiful of my women, with a young virgin slave
and a stallion-camel. At nightfall, accordingly, he sent her to me,
and I sent the camel and my two slaves. When,
[318]
however, I led my new acquisition to my
tent, I perceived at once that it was not the one I had seen. This
one appeared detestable to me. I was in great distress, and sent a
man to the Tibboo to explain the mistake. But he answered that he
had no slave but that one; that a bargain was a bargain; and that
he meant to abide by what had been done. This embarrassed me; but
after much praying and begging, and many messages, I obtained my
two slaves back in exchange for his one; but he refused obstinately
to give me back my camel. Then I began to seek for the girl who had
so fascinated me, and soon learned that she belonged to another
Tibboo, who loved her passionately, and who was loved by her in
turn; and that not for her weight in gold would he part with
her.

When we were about to start, once for all, from the Three
Mountains, we received a message that we were expected, each of us,
to give a measure of
dokhn
(millet) to his majesty the
Sultan, and were obliged to comply. The grain was emptied out into
a skin and carried away. We thought this was the last extortion;
but the Sultan himself now appeared and began to ferret about our
tents and baggage, appropriating whatever he took a fancy to,
cords, baskets, &c., making presents to himself, and
murmuring,ââI am the Sultan of this country, the master of this
route; whoever refuses me anything shall not depart.â No sooner was
this visit satisfactorily concluded, than his mercenary queen
came
[319]
to take her
share of the spoils; and then the common Tibboos, each of whom
pretended to be a kingâs son. Thus no apparent object of any value
was left us. We came into the country rich, and we left it poor.
For myself, I departed almost with tears in my eyes, thinking of
the male slave who had escaped, and the girls he had taken with
him.

We now entered on the desert, by which we were to approach
Catroun, the first town on the borders of Fezzan. A hundred and
fifty of the Tibboo-Reshad accompanied us a little in the rear. If
we forgot a knife, or wooden cupâas caravans always doâthey were
ready to snap everything up; and if a camel fell, they were near to
seize on the carcass. When one of our beasts of burden showed signs
of knocking up, indeed, we had to comply with the customs of the
desertânamely, to abandon our own beast, and hire a new one of the
Tibboos. The old one is often kept by them, and fed and nourished
into a useful animal again.

The Tibboos will not allow their hired camels to carry a single
pound above the weight agreed at the outset. They are very careful
of their beasts. The man whose camel I was obliged to hire walked
in the morning in front of his beast, leading it by the bridle,
plucking herbs as he went along, and feeding it; after midday he
left the bridle, and went hither and thither collecting food to
give it at halting time. In this way the camels of the Tibboos are
always
[320]
kept in good
health and strength, whilst those of the caravans become emaciated
and worn out.

These people are very simple and ignorant. One of our people,
named Abd-Allah, had a gold watch, which he used to hang by a
branch of a tree when he rested in the shade. At the last station
in the Tibboo country fatality decreed that he should leave it
suspended. The savages came as usual to search about, and saw what
they imagined to be a lump of precious metal swinging from a
branch. One of them seized it with joy; but suddenly heard a noise
and put it near his ear. Immediately he imagined that there was a
devil inside, and dashing it against the branch of a tree, took to
flight with his companions into the desert When Abd-Allah came
back, therefore, to look for his watch, he found only the
fragments. Cursing the time he had stayed there, he pursued his
journey until the evening, and then inquired among the Tibboos who
had done this thing. One came forward and boasted that he had
dashed the devil to pieces; so Abd-Allah made a note of him, and on
arriving at Mourzouk cited him before the Kadi, and compelled him
to pay damages to the extent of forty dollars.

The Tibboos are the most ceremonious people in the world. When
they meet, they squat down one opposite the other, looking serious
and calm, well wrapped up in their lithams, with a lance in one
hand and a buckler in the other. They then growl
[321]
out an interminable series of
compliments, after which they talk of business, and often end with
a regular fight. If, for example, one of them alludes, by way of
reproach, to any loss he has sustained from the others, blows are
sure to follow. They are the most avaricious of men, and will strip
a whole caravan for a bit of leather.

We were ten days in crossing the desert that separated us from
Fezzan. It is without water. We travelled several hours after night
and before morning, in order to avoid the torment of heat and
thirst. We hastened on as rapidly as possible. On our last nightâs
march most of the travellers had no water left, and some had only a
very small quantity. I had still four skins left, and I had had the
good idea of enclosing two of my skins in the
guerfehs
, or
large leather bags, to prevent evaporation by the sun; the other
two were fastened to my camel. During the last night we marched
hard until worn out with fatigue, and then halting, each slept
where he could. Before closing my eyes I gave drink to such of my
slaves as were thirsty; and then laid my head between my two skins.
Near me lay Abd-Allah with his slaves, who drank all my water in
the night, and I complained in the morning without obtaining
redress.

My favourite slave was then one of the girls whom I had given
with a camel to a Tibboo, as above mentioned, when I was bewildered
with desire for another. About this time the poor thing was
seized
[322]
with what is
called âthe thirst of the desert,â or shÃ´b. She had an unappeasable
craving for drink; but the more water she drank the more she
wanted. I feared for her life; but a Bedawin, named Khalyl, who was
one of the caravan, perceiving my distress, said to me: âGive her
some melted butter to drink, and her sufferings will cease.â I
followed his advice, and in a very short time she was relieved.
Then I placed her on a camel, for slaves usually walk, and the heat
somewhat diminishing, she was quite cured. I afterwards learned
that a caravan on its way to Mekka, having wandered from the right
road, and having not a drop of water left, continued to exist
entirely on a little melted butter for ten whole days. This is more
extraordinary than what happened to my slave.

When we reached the well we halted for forty-eight hours, after
which we proceeded until we reached Catroun.
[58]

This place is surrounded with palms, producing excellent dates,
which the people eat in abundance at every repast. They likewise
feed cattle and horses with them. Their territory is sandy and
sterile. They are as black as the Soudanees; and consist of Tibboos
who have settled there, with a small mixture of Fezzanees.

Having
remained three days
at Catroun, we went in four more to Mourzouk, usually called
Zeylah. At the gates our slaves were counted and registered by the
officers of the customs, as if we had been entering a great city.
But Mourzouk is a wretched borough, inhabited by blacks from Afnou,
and a heterogeneous population of Arabs from Tripoli, Jalou,
Aujila, and Derna. It is situated in a plain, far from any other
town or village. The bazaar is miserably small, containing only
fourteen shops. A market is held every afternoon for about an hour
and a half; and goods are then sold by a crier, who goes up and
down, announcing the prices offered.

We were presented to the Sultan, as he calls
[324]
himself, although he is in
reality a mere governor. He was the well-known Mountaser, who
afterwards rebelled against the Pasha of Tripoli. He received us
with much haughtiness, and with an attempt at state. I never saw
such an enormous white turban as the one he wore. It was folded in
the Mekka fashion,âthat is, swelling more over the right temple
than the left,âbut the size was so ridiculously exaggerated, that
his Majesty dared scarcely bend his head. I could not help laughing
to myself at his airs of importance. He deigned to receive our
presents, but addressed us not except by slight signs. Decorum in
Fezzan consists in restraining the prodigality of ceremonies. The
court of this mighty Sultan consisted of a number of fellows
wrapped in old, worn-out blankets. They looked very wretched. I
afterwards went to the Vizier Othmanâs, and found him surrounded by
a lot of dirty people playing on old tambourines and cracked
flutes. Everything in this country is miserable. I could find no
food to eat with pleasure, and spent three months there very
wretchedly.
[59]

Few strangers from the Magreb, or any other country, who are at
all accustomed to easy living, can make up their minds to settle at
Mourzouk. They say that a learned man, an Ulema, once
[325]
came to teach at that city. He
was immediately surrounded by disciples; the crowd came to his
lessons; he was listened to with avidityâwhich is the supreme
happiness of men of science: yet, in spite of this, one morning the
worthy Ulema ran away from the place in a great hurry. He could not
put up with it any longer. âIt is impossible to stand it,â said he.
âWherefore?â inquired some one.ââWherefore? Why, because it is the
veritable image of hell. Hell is hot,âso is Mourzouk: the damned
are black,âso are the people of Mourzouk: hell has seven gates,âso
has Mourzouk. What the deuce do you expect one to do in a place
which completely answers the definition of hell?â So away he went
as fast as he could.

Verily, it is an abominable country. Women sell themselves for a
handful of barley,âat least so they say. Besides, there is not a
dish which can be eaten with pleasure; there never falls a drop of
rain; man and beasts live on the same foodâ dates: there is the
abiding-place of fever, nourished by continual feeding on dates and
barley-bread. Wheat is so rare that only the great people and the
Sultan can indulge in it: butter is as difficult to be got as red
sulphur. What can one do with the grease which is sold at Mourzouk
for kitchen-stuff? What
can
one do in a country where men
eat clover, with a little salt, as a delicacy, where a fowl costs
half a mitkal of gold, and ten eggs are charged half a riyal? I
have seen servants come before the
[326]
Womenâs Kadi to complain that they had not
enough to eat,âeven of dates. In one word, merchants only have any
cause to be pleased with Mourzouk; for they gain sometimes a
thousand per cent there.

It is by the passage of the caravans that the city subsists. All
those that come from Bornou, from WadaÃ¯, from Bagirmeh, and,
indeed, both Western and Eastern Soudan, meet here. Merchants of
Aujila ply between Egypt and Mourzouk; and those of Sokneh and
Bengazi between Tripoli and Mourzouk, which has become a veritable
central mart of commerce. The slaves preferred there are those of
Haussa, the capital of Afnou; and, indeed, in all markets they
fetch the highest prices. The Tuaricks and the Tuatee come for the
purposes of trade to Mourzouk, where also pass the pilgrim caravans
from all the West.

The people of Fezzan are remarkable for benevolence and probity,
as an example will prove. A Fezzanee had dissipated his moderate
fortune in extravagance, and was reduced to misery. Some days
before the departure of a caravan for Soudan, accordingly, he went
and cut a number of palm-leaves, and, taking the stems, wrapped
them up carefully in thick cloth, making them appear like bales of
merchandise. Then he placed them on a camel, and taking them into
the city, paid a couple of douros on each as a tax; for it is the
custom to make a fixed charge, and not to search. Having
got
[327]
his two bales
safe in his house, the Fezzanee went to the Vizier Othman, and
said,ââTo-morrow a caravan departs for Soudan. I have just received
two bales of merchandise, which I cannot take with me; I will leave
them with thee as a pledge, if thou wilt lend me two hundred
dollars for the speculation I am going to undertake. When I return
I will pay.â âWillingly,â said the vizier, trusting in his good
faith. The bales were brought, the money was counted out, and the
man departed. In six months he returned, having been fortunate, and
went to the vizier, confessed his trick, paid back the money, and
the two were ever afterwards friends. The Prophet has said,ââGood
faith is the ark of salvation.â

I was detained long at Mourzouk, as I have said, and became
weary and disgusted. The roads were infested by the tribe of
Bedawins called the Beni Seyf-en-Nasr, who robbed and murdered
travellers, so that even caravans dared not depart.
[60]

At length, however, I obtained an opportunity of departure under
the conduct of one Bou-Bekr, a chief of the tribe of the Bischr.
This tribe had formerly been defeated by the Beni Seyf, and forced
to take refuge in Fezzan, where they settled, leaving their rivals
in possession of the surrounding desert. Yusef Pasha, of
Tripoli,
[328]
however,
hearing of this, and wishing to employ them to reduce the Beni
Seyf, had sent for their chief men to have an interview. It was
with this deputation that I obtained permission to depart. Bou-Bekr
told me to meet him at Shiatee, and giving me a guide, I departed
with my camels, and in five days reached the place of rendezvous.
Here I was well received by Bischr, the chief of the tribe, and
treated in all respects as if I was one of them. So I waited
patiently until the arrival of Bou-Bekr, rejoiced at having escaped
from Mourzouk, feeding on milk and meat, and seeing with pleasure
my camels pasturing on the excellent herbage which grows in the
Wady of Shiatee.

On the arrival of Bou-Bekr the tribe collected in a general
council to deliberate. Every one, old and young, came to discuss
the general situation. I shall always remember the impression which
this assembly produced upon me, and the freedom with which all the
members expressed their opinions. Young people, children of from
twelve to fifteen years of age, equally with the reverend people of
the tribe, had a deliberative voice, and were listened to without
excitement or indifference. No one held back from giving an
opinion, and all opinions were duly weighed and considered. It was
really a marvellous thing to see old men listening to, and weighing
the words of, unbearded youths and mere children. The sight of no
assembly ever moved me more. Such things are not seen, I believe,
in any other
[329]

country. An assembly so calm, so attentive, so grave, representing
all ages, gathered together to discuss a question of general
interest to all ranks, is a model to be imitated by the peoples of
the earth. I know not how behave the deliberative councils of
France and England, but I am persuaded that both French and English
might go and take a lesson of gravity and freedom, an example for
the forms of public discussion, in the deserts of Africa, among the
children of the tribes of Bischr. There are savages who have some
good in them; there is wisdom even among louts; there are
simpletons who can teach the wise; just as in the desert there are
some oases, some spots of greenery.

It was decided that some of the principal men of the tribe
should go to Tripoli with Bou-Bekr, whilst the others remained at
Shiatee. The preparations that were necessaryâsuch as collecting
provisions, getting together water-skins, and so forthâ lasted five
days. On the sixth we departed, with an escort of twenty Arabs, and
entered upon vast plains beyond the limits of Fezzan. The Bischr
who accompanied us talked much, but had no topics but their own
incursions, battles, and robberies. âDo you remember,â would they
say one to the other, âhow on such a day we made such an
expeditionâhow we were attacked by such a tribeâhow I killed such
an one?âthe whole tribe saw me give that famous blow!â This was the
matter of conversation among these Bedawins during the
entire
[330]
journey. We
advanced for fifteen days over plains dotted with trees and covered
with verdure. The Arabs constantly sent out scouts to watch the
horizon and look sharp for ambuscades wherever the ground seemed to
favour an attack. On the sixteenth day we reached the district of
Gharian, which is well wooded and adorned with gardens, picturesque
and wild places, springs of water and large ponds: saffron grows
here, and fruits of various kinds. The people are good and
hospitable. They lodge under ground; so that on approaching their
villages only the minarets of the mosques are to be seen, and the
houses set apart for strangers. We were well received, and
generally halted at night near a village. All I had to complain of
was the food. Their great dish is a thick paste soaked in oil, and
seasoned with date-marmalade. I could never eat more than a couple
of mouthfuls. We were five days in traversing this district, where
we were in perfect safety, having nothing to fear but God.

I must say, however, that I was displeased with the Bischr, my
companions, on account of their total indifference in matters of
faith and law. They never pray; nothing is reprehensible or
forbidden among them; crime and virtue are all one. They swear only
by the oath of divorce. They continually boast of the number of
enemies they have killed, of people they have robbed; and seem to
think that time is lost which is not devoted to these occupations.
I used to say to them, âSuch works and
[331]
such a life are criminal, forbidden by God.
Give up such habits; be corrected.â They would answer: âWe are men
of forbidden things; we live in them and by them. God has created
us Bedawins of the desert, that we may do them.â I quoted the Koran
and the maxims of the Prophet, at which they laughed and treated me
as a fool. One of them, named Katar, said, that if I had not been
under the protection of Bou-Bekr, he would long ago have seized my
camels and my slaves. In fact, these tribes regard nothing as
sacred: if there are any pious men among them they are very aged
and decrepit. All their Islamism consists in repeating the
Profession of Faith.
[61]

Leaving Gharian, we proceeded towards Tripoli, when the first
thing we saw was a man hanging over the gateway. I did not long
remain there. It is a city not nearly so great as its reputation.
There are two gates, one towards the market-place; the other
towards the sea. The houses remind me of those of Alexandria,
before it was embellished by Mohammed Ali. All the merchants nearly
are natives of the island of Jirbeh. At Tripoli I sold all my
slaves, except one from Bagirmeh, named Zeitoun, whom I loved. Then
I set out by sea for
[332]
Tunis, and having visited Safakes, at
length arrived in sight of my native place. We recognised it by its
dazzling whiteness, by the glittering panes of its houses, by its
eaves of shining tin, by its cupolas covered with semi-cylindrical
tiles, and varnished green.

We went to the okella (hotel) of travellers from Safakes. I
hired two asses, and placing on them my kitchen-utensils and
bedding, mounted one myself, and placed my slave on the other. Then
we penetrated into the interior of the town, asking for my fatherâs
house. I found that he had gone to a country dwelling, and
proceeding thither, found at length my father walking in the
garden. He had a dozen concubines, five fellow-servants, and the
black servant; and he had given a young slave to his mother.

I was received with distinction and apparent joy. My two
cousins, young girls, came to salute me, and so did my sister and
my grandmother. I related my adventures, but said nothing of the
money which was in my belt, and begged my slave to keep the
secret.

Towards evening my father caused a bath to be prepared, and told
me to wash myself from the dust of travel. Unsuspecting, I
complied; and the attendant, when I was undressed, took up my old
garments and carried them away, leaving in their place a new
Tunisian dress. It happened that my father took up my girdle, and
finding it heavy,
[333]

knew that it contained money. He accordingly appropriated the
whole. I dared not at first remonstrate, but did so at length
through the medium of a friend. My father was very angry, and said
that whatever I had belonged to him; that he had supplied the
capital, and was the cause of the favour of the Sultan of WadaÃ¯;
and that if I ever alluded to the subject again I should be turned
out of doors. So I was reduced to silence.

Some time afterwards, however, my father, feeling the roving
disposition come over him again, called to me, and said: âI wish to
undertake a second journey to WadaÃ¯, and bring back my children
with the rest of my family, and arrange all my affairs. Remain,
then, at the sanieh. I give it to you, with the land adjoining, in
exchange for the money I have had of yours. Watch over this little
domain and cultivate it. I leave for that purpose oxen and tools.
In the warehouse is abundance of barley for cattle, and of wheat
for seed. I leave to your care my mother and your cousins.â I
requested my father not to undertake such a journey, and offered to
go in his place, but he would not listen to my advice; and having
made his preparations, started with many presents for the Sultan of
WadaÃ¯.

I settled at the sanieh without money, but with my grandmother
and cousins to support. I cultivated the ground; and when I was in
want sold a portion of my store of barley. Soon after my fatherâs
departure, my grandmother advised me to
[334]
marry the younger of my cousins, and I at
length consented. Two years passed, and I received news of my
fatherâs death from Tripoli. I repaired there, and met Sedan, my
fatherâs slave. He told me that he had been sent to Mourzouk to
sell slaves, and had realised nine hundred and sixty dollars; but
that Moknee, who was then governor of Fezzan, had taken them from
him. This determined me to return across the desert. I reached
Mourzouk in safety, and with some difficulty got back my money.
Then I started for WadaÃ¯ again; but on the borders of the country
of the Tibboo-Reshad I met a large caravan, with which was my Uncle
Zarouk. I found that he had appropriated my fatherâs property; and
it was only after a violent quarrel that I got back a
portionânamely, a number of slaves.

I returned to Tunis with my slaves, and soon afterwards disposed
of my sanieh, which I found to be a losing concern. Then I went to
live in Tunis itself, and passed there two years, during which I
spent a great part of my fortune. Fearing poverty, I determined to
undertake the pilgrimage to Mekka, and carry merchandise with me.
My wife refused to accompany me; so I started alone, on board a
brig, which touched first at Susa. Whilst we stayed here I made a
little excursion to Cairawan. Eleven days afterwards we sighted
Alexandria. From this place I went to Cairo, where I was rejoiced
to find my mother alive and well. I gave her a hundred piastres for
her expenses. Seven days after my arrival
[335]
I bought an Abyssinian slave, a beautiful
girl, gentle and honest. Her heart was good and loving, and she
shared my joys and sorrows. I kept her for six years, until she
died (
A.D.
1821) of the plague. No loss
ever grieved me more than the loss of my beautiful Abyssinian girl,
whom may God regard with mercy!

CONCLUDING NOTE.

The Sheikh now reverts to his last voyage to Fezzan, and gives
further details. After this he promises to write what befell him
during his pilgrimage to Mekka, and in a visit he subsequently made
to the Morea; but this portion of his work he has not yet executed.
I have thought it best to give but a mere outline of the concluding
section of his travels. What I have presented will impart some idea
of the kind of life led by these Oriental wandering merchants, and
enable us to understand the working of the Mohammedan social
system, and especially of polygamy. The reader will not have failed
to perceive that the intercourse of the sexes becomes almost
fortuitous; that filial and parental affection are necessarily
weakened and nearly destroyed; and that natural sentiments, though
they show themselves now and then, do so in a merely
episodical
[336]
and
unimportant way. The great bane of Muslim civilisation is this
idea, that women are an article of property. The worthy Sheikh, who
so regrets his Abyssinian girl, forgets to tell us what became of
Zeitoun. He had loved another slave also, but had endeavoured to
change her away to satisfy a momentary caprice. These reflections,
however, will have suggested themselves to the sagacious
reader.

It will be observed that our Sheikh here
drops all allusion to his mother, who, perhaps, to a certain
extent, abandoned him. Altogether, this narrative illustrates the
slightness of the family bond in the East.

Rashid was one of the titles of the

Basy is a title meaning great, and is

[11]
It is evident that this is the account of a
partisan; and, if we could interest ourselves in these distant
politics, we might perhaps become convinced that Zawanah was the
victim of that jealousy and fear which all powerful foreigners
excite in Darfur. We shall presently see that, in one case at
least, Abd-er-Rahman did not merit the title of Rashid. It is very
possible that he regretted the wealth he had bestowed upon the
Mamlouk.

[12]
The Sheikh, who had already abandoned his
personal narrative to relate the historical incidents that preceded
or were contemporary with his residence in Darfur, now assumes a
didactic tone, and gives the result of his observations,
interspersing personal adventures and anecdotes. It is, perhaps,
necessary to repeat that Darfur is pronounced Darfoor.

It is possible that some filthy custom of
this kind, among our ancestors, was the origin of the contemptuous
expression of lick-spittle.

[15]
Read the private histories of most courts
for instances equally absurd: the origin of high cravats, of
shaving in some periods, of beard-wearing in others; of long hair,
of short hair, of wigs, of pantaloons; of Protestantism, of
Romanism, of adultery, and piety. The poor Forians, falling off
their saddle, in imitation of their sovereign, would, perhaps, feel
offended by this comparison.

[16]
A similar ceremony is celebrated in China by
the emperors.

[17]
This singular custom of concealing the face
with the Litham, as a mark of sovereignty, is found in most parts
of Central Africa. The whole conquering tribe of Touaricks, and,
indeed, all people of Berber race, keep it up. I noticed it at
Siwah.

I once saw at Cairo a Zikr of the kind, in
which a woman stood behind the performers and excited them by her
singing.

In Egypt I have observed that, in spite of
the great number of black concubines, there absolutely exists no
class of mulattoes. The children almost all die young.

[21]
The Sheikh gives a detailed account of the
operation, as also of various other kinds of treatments for
different diseases, which it may be curious for medical men to
consult. I have no doubt that many barbarous nations are in
possession of valuable medical secrets.

[22]
So the Forians, as well as the English,
regard as a delicacy meat in which the process of putrefaction has
commenced.

[23]
The zhalym has on each wing eight beautiful
white plumes, and the rabdah eight grey ones.

[24]
I suppose this is the same tree as the
tholukh, so often mentioned in Mr. Richardsonâs âJournal.â

[25]
Chloroform?

[26]
This royal way of paying debts appears to be
common in Soudan. See the exploits of the Sarkee of Zinder, in
Richardsonâs âJournal.â

[27]
Those who are acquainted with the history of
recent political events, need not go to the centre of Africa for an
example of a prince pausing in the midst of massacre to perform
those pious duties which public opinion is always ready to set down
to the account of the powerful.

[28]
I cannot again refrain from pointing out the
singular similarity which exists between the histories of all
nations in which the idea of authority is developed, and in which a
man or a family presumes to look upon a whole people as personal
property. The fact of this similarity is, perhaps, the only useful
information we can derive from a study of the bloody annals of
empires, present or past, expiring or nascent.

[29]
It is amusing to see the right divine of
kings asserted in the person of the ferocious Saboun, and how
priests of all forms of faith are ready to justify bloodshed in the
interest of authority. It must be observed, that the learned men to
whom this case was submitted made no allusion to the mild
alternative expressed in the last words of the law.

[30]
This splendid description of how an African
prince wades through slaughter to a throne, and at once becomes an
idol, is an unconscious satire of some of the great events of
modern history.

[31]
I have preserved with some regret the
constant reference to a sacred Name in this Chapter, because the
frightful picture it contains, and the terrible code of political
morals which it represents, would be otherwise incomplete. The
Sheikh, who has no suspicion of wrong, goes on to give his theory
of absolute government, and, naturally taking the optimist view,
uses the old comparison of the shepherd and the flock. I may remark
that it is peculiarly characteristic of the bloodiest despotic
governments, and their defenders of all degrees of refinement, to
make a wanton use of the Divine Name.

[32]
M. Fresnel, French consul at Jeddah, has
published a memoir on the abou-kern, which he considers to be the
unicorn, and not the rhinoceros.â
Perron
. In this case,
however, the Sheikh clearly marks that he means the khartit; and in
no part of his work makes allusion to the unicorn.

[33]
This title corresponds to the Ab of WadaÃ¯
and Darfur.

[34]
The Sheikh here enters into considerable
details on the revolution by which this change of government took
place. Those who have read the âJournalâ of Mr. Richardson will be
aware that his principal servant was a descendant of the Moknee
mentioned in the text.

[35]
It is just possible that Saboun may have
been ruthless only against his political enemies. The glowing
character, however, which I have given complete in the text, is
evidently the work of a parasite. The Sheikh has as little respect
for human life as a Soudan prince. In a lengthy episode, which I am
obliged to omit, he refers to Sabounâs murder of his brother, and
says that a man who gets his enemies into his power, and pardons
them, prepares for himself dangers which may cost him his life,
âfor according to the Prophet, on whom be the benediction of God,
no wise man suffers himself to be twice stung by a viper;â and then
he goes on to tell an illustrative story of Noman the One-eyed.

[36]
Let us here admire the Sheikhâs modestyâa
quality not common in travellers. An European doctor, after a week
or twoâs residence in a country of which he does not know the
language, will send home to a learned society an elaborate account,
not only of the present state, but of the history and origins of
all its tribes and families. The Sheikh resided more than a year in
WadaÃ¯, and nearly eight years in the neighbouring country of
Darfur.

[37]
This is the punishment prescribed by the
Muslim law. In most countries, however, the same feeling which
forces women to use the veil leads to the employment of the sack
for women taken in adultery.

[38]
These observations may be transferred from
the Bornouese to the classes which check public opinion at present
in France, and, to a certain extent, in England. I notice that most
people who are opposed to war on principleâsetting aside those who
are guided by religious motives, the smallest numberâare
comfortable and fat.

[39]
In a former Chapter it is said that the
palace has seven gates, the fourth of which is the iron gate.

[40]
This state ought scarcely to be reckoned
amongst those of Soudan. It more properly belongs to the Sahara,
although the neighbourhood of Soudan has certainly influenced its
manners and its population. It is inhabited by people of Berber
origin, mixed with blacks.

[41]
The Sheikh speaks loosely and from report.
The route from Bornou to Adagez (Aghadez) is first slightly north
of west, as far as Zindar, and then turns north-north-west. Adagez
is the capital of the kingdom of Aheir, the northern limits of
which form, in fact, the southern limits of the Central Sahara.

[42]
The Sheikh seems distressed lest the Jengueh
should stifle themselves; but it is evident that, after having
anointed their bodies, they simply roll in the ashes, and collect,
as it were, in this way a peculiar kind of counterpane.

[43]
The French traveller, Le Vaillant, gives, I
remember, some still more curious facts of this nature. Among the
tribes which he visited, advancing towards Central Africa from the
south, he saw bulls which seemed, at first sight, to have four or
even eight horns. He afterwards learned that the owners, as soon as
the horns began to grow, used to split them carefully into two or
four parts, and afterwards carefully bend and twist them into the
shapes they desired.

[44]
Assertions of this kind, so common among
travellers, have generally been disproved by more careful
research.

[45]
In fact, they appear to mean only a single
country, the capital of which is Kanou.

[46]
News travels quicker than we are apt to
think amongst the Easterns, especially if it concerns their faith.
Probably Zaky was excited to begin his crusade by the news that
came from Arabia.

[47]
Niffy is situated on the easternmost bend of
the Niger. It appears certain that the American slave-traders
penetrate sometimes thus far with their schooners. Mr. Richardson
heard, on the confines of Soudan, a very detailed account of white
men who came up the great river to Niffy.

[48]
âThis,â says Mr. Perron, ârefers probably to
the foundation of Sakkatou, which name, however, was not given till
1805.â

[49]
These bags are used to carry water. Two of
them form a camel-load. The water-dealers fill from them the
sheep-skin bags which they carry on their backs.

[50]
It would be difficult to invent any more
effective way of exciting a feeling of horror against this wretched
institution of slavery, which still lags in the rear of the army of
abuses that has been put to flight, than this cold-blooded
statement.

[51]
See âVoyage to Darfur.â

[52]
The Sheikh here relents from his
uncompromising condemnation of the Forian character, which probably
had its origin in the rough treatment he himself received on some
occasions.

[53]
It is worth while to reflect on the
frightful state of society that must be produced by a consistent
adherence to the laws of the Koran, which it is the fashion among
sensualists in all times, and politicians at this particular
moment, to praise directly, or by implication.

[54]
There is something very ludicrous in this
excessive severity against women expressed by a man like the
Sheikh. The same one-sided feeling, in a mitigated form, dictated a
clause in the proposed divorce bill of this last session.

[55]
I have myself noticed the rapidity with
which a Bedawin encampment prepares to meet what may seem to be a
surprise. When our caravan rose over the little hills that command
the settlement of Mudar, scarcely a minute elapsed before the women
were engaged in driving away the cattle on the opposite side,
whilst the men came running to meet us, imagining us to be an
attacking party.

[56]
Here follows a singular story, the principal
incident of which, however, can scarcely be adapted to European
reading.

[57]
I suppose he means âcapable of bearing
arms.â He had not previously mentioned that there were any Tibboos
with him, except the family of Ahmed.

[58]
I have given the Sheikhâs account of the
incidents of this journey in some detailâalthough his geographical
information is wonderfully meagreâbecause I think it is the only
record we have of personal observation in that desert. What he says
of the manners of the Tibboos agrees well with other accounts.

[59]
The Sheikh is prejudiced against Fezzan,
which, however, is not a very delightful oasis. Besides, he was
impatient to reach his own country; and nothing appears so
disagreeable as the vestibule of a house you are anxious to enter,
if you are kept long waiting.

[60]
This tribe was subsequently driven into the
Saharah, and forced to retreat as far as the borders of Soudan,
where its turbulent and marauding disposition engaged it in
constant quarrels with its black neighbours. It was nearly
exterminated in 1851.

[61]
The Sheikh seems to have understood pretty
well the character of the Bedawins, who are, in fact, a set of
coarse barbarians, with some few fine qualities, which sound very
well when spoken of in poetry or romance, apart from the vulgar and
repulsive realities of their ordinary existence.

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

Observe the rising Lily's snowy grace,

Observe the various vegetable race;

They neither toil nor spin, but careless grow,

Yet see how warm they blush! how bright they glow!

What regal vestments can with them compare!

What king so shining, or what queen so fair.

Our plant is undoubtedly the
Spanish blush Mallow
of

Parkinson
, and the
Lavatera althææfolia
of
Miller

according to the former, it is a native of Spain, according to the
latter, of Syria.

Mr.
Miller
considers it as distinct from the
trimestris
; Mr.

Aiton
has no
althææfolia
in his
Hort. Kew.
we are therefore
to conclude that the
althææfolia
of
Miller
, and the

trimestris
of
Linneus
are one and the same species.

Of the annuals commonly raised in our gardens, this is one of the most
shewy, as well as the most easily cultivated; its seeds are to be sown
in March, on the borders where they are to remain, the plants, thinned
as they come up, and kept clear of weeds.

It varies with white blossoms, and flowers from July to September.

The radical leaves of plants usually differ in shape from those of the
stalk, in some plants remarkably so; the
Lepidium perfoliatum
figured
in the
Flora Austriaca
of Professor
Jacquin
is a striking
instance of this dissimilarity: the
Lathyrus Aphaca
, a British plant,
figured in the
Flora Lond.
is still more such, as large entire
leaf-like stipulæ grow in pairs on the stalk, instead of leaves, while
the true leaves next the root, visible when the plant first comes up
from seed, are few in number, and those pinnated. The present plant no
less admirably illustrates the above remark, the leaves which first
appear on the seedling plants being pinnated, as is represented in the
small figure on the plate, while those which afterwards come forth grow
in whorls. We have observed the same disposition to produce dissimilar
leaves in several other species of
Mimosa
, which have arisen from
Botany-Bay seeds, lately introduced.

This singular species, on the authority of Mr.
David Nelson
, is
a native of New South Wales, and was introduced to the royal garden at
Kew by Sir
Joseph Banks
, Bart.

We first saw it in flower, and have since seen it with ripe seed-pods,
at Mr.
Malcolm
's, Kennington.

It is properly a green-house plant, and propagated only by seeds, which
are to be sown on a gentle hot-bed.

It is some years in arriving at its flowering state.

Grows spontaneously in various parts of France and Germany; Mr.

Philip Hurlock
lately shewed me some dried specimens of this
plant, which he gathered in the corn fields, on the
Luneburgh Heide
,
in
Upper Lusatia
, where it grew plentifully, and afforded a pleasing
appearance to the curious traveller:—not so to the husbandman, to whom
it is as noxious as the
Convolvulus arvensis
(
small Bindweed
) is
with us, and equally difficult to extirpate, having powerfully creeping
roots, which somewhat like the
Helianthus tuberosus
(commonly called

Jerusalem Artichoke
) produce large tubera, and which like those of
that plant, are in high esteem with some as an article of food, and as
such even cultivated abroad.

It flowers from June to the end of August. It is certainly a beautiful
hardy perennial, similar to (but of more humble growth) than the
everlasting pea, yet must be cautiously introduced on account of its
creeping roots, by which it is most readily propagated, rarely ripening
its seeds with us.

It is, perhaps, better suited to decorate the unclip'd hedge of the
pleasure-ground, than the border of the flower-garden.

One of the most ornamental hardy shrubs we possess; at once pleasing to
the eye, and grateful to the smell; for, as
Miller
observes,
the whole plant in warm weather exudes a sweet glutinous substance,
which has a very strong balsamic scent, so as to perfume the
circumambient air to a great distance.

Its blossoms, which appear in June and July in great profusion, exhibit
a remarkable instance of quickly-fading beauty, opening and expanding to
the morning sun, and before night strewing the ground with their elegant
remains: as each succeeding day produces new blossoms, this deciduous
disposition of the petals, common to the genus, is the less to be
regretted.

Is a native of Spain and Portugal, prefers a dry soil and warm sheltered
situation, and in very severe seasons requires some kind of covering.

Cultivated 1656, by Mr.
John Tradescant
, jun.
Ait. Hort. Kew.

Is readily increased from cuttings; but
Miller
remarks, that
the best plants are raised from seeds.

Varies with waved leaves, and in having petals without a spot at the
base.

Is not the plant from whence the Ladanum of the shops is produced,
though affording in warmer countries than ours a similar gum, hence its
name of
ladanifera
is not strictly proper.

"Is an annual plant which grows naturally in Asia and America, but has
been long cultivated for ornament in the English gardens, and is
generally known by the title of Convolvulus major. Of this there are
three or four lasting varieties; the most common hath a purple flower,
but there is one with a white, another with a red, and one with a
whitish-blue flower, which hath white seeds. All these varieties I have
cultivated many years, without observing them to change. If the seeds of
these sorts are sown in the spring, upon a warm border where the plants
are designed to remain, they will require no other culture but to keep
them clear from weeds, and place some tall stakes down by them, for
their stalks to twine about, otherwise they will spread on the ground
and make a bad appearance. These plants, if they are properly supported,
will rise ten or twelve feet high in warm Summers: they flower in June,
July, and August, and will continue till the frost kills them. Their
seeds ripen in Autumn."

Grows spontaneously in Sicily and Crete; is an annual of humble growth,
and hence a suitable plant for the borders of the flower garden, or the
decoration of Rock-work, as its blossoms are shewy, and not of very

will come up yearly without any trouble.

A native of France, Spain, and Italy, and distinguishable when in flower
by the blue colour of its blossoms, which are sometimes, however,
milk-white; but its seed-pods afford a more certain mark of distinction,
being unusually short, broad, and winged on the back.

This species grows to the height of about two feet, and is usually sown
in the spring with other annuals; though not so beautiful, it forms a
contrast to the sweet and Tangier Pea, and may be introduced where there
is plenty of room, or a desire of possessing and knowing most of the
plants of a genus.

It flowers in June and July.

For this rare plant I am indebted to the very laudable exertions of a
late Gardener of mine,
James Smith
, who, in the spring of the
year 1788, examining attentively the bog earth which had been brought
over with some plants of the
Dionæa Muscipula
, found several small
tooth-like knobby roots, which being placed in pots of the same earth,
and plunged into a tan-pit having a gentle heat, produced plants the
ensuing summer, two of which flowered, and from the strongest of those
our figure was taken.

From this circumstance we learn, that this species is a native of South
Carolina, and properly a bog plant, growing spontaneously with the

Dionæa Muscipula
.

Both Mr.
Dryander
and Dr.
J. E. Smith
assure me, that
it is the true
Limodorum tuberosum
of
Linnæus
; the one
usually called by that name is a native of the West-Indies, and treated
as a stove plant.

From the little experience we have had of the management of this
species, it appears to us to be scarcely hardy enough for the open
border, yet not tender enough to require a stove. We have succeeded best
by treating it in the manner above mentioned; we may observe, that the
tan-pit spoken of was built in the open garden, not in a stove, and was
for the purpose of raising plants or seeds by a gentle heat, as well as
for striking cuttings and securing plants from cold in the winter.

Our figure will make a description of the plant unnecessary, its
flowering stem with us has arisen to the height of a foot and a half,
the number of flowers has not exceeded five. In its most luxuriant state
it will probably be found much larger, and to produce more flowers.

This species of Bell-flower, which takes its name from its place of
growth, is a native of the Carpatian Alps, and was introduced into the
Royal Garden at Kew, by
Professor

Jacquin
, of
Vienna
, in
the year 1774.

It flowers in June and July.

As yet it is scarce in our gardens, but deserves to be more generally
known and cultivated; its flowers, in proportion to the plant, are large
and shewy: like many other Alpine plants, it is well suited to decorate
certain parts of rock-work, or such borders of the flower garden, as are
not adapted for large plants.

It is a hardy perennial, and propagated by parting its roots in autumn.

Our figure, from a deficiency in the colouring art, gives a very
inadequate idea of its beauty.

Grows spontaneously out of the crevices of the rocks in the South of
France; flowers in our gardens in July and August; is a very hardy
perennial, and in sheltered situations retains its leaves all the year.

The singular manner in which the leaves are attached to the flowering
stem, deserves to be noticed.

As many of the succulent plants are tender, and require a Green-house in
the winter, cultivators of plants are apt indiscriminately to extend the
same kind of care to the whole
[Pg 22]
tribe, hence it is not uncommon to find
this and many other similar hardy plants, nursed up in the Green-house
or stove, when they would thrive much better on a wall or piece of
rock-work, for the decoration of which this plant in particular is
admirably adapted.

Like most of the Sedum tribe it may readily be propagated by cuttings,
or parting its roots in autumn.

it was cultivated in this country by

Gerard

In order that we may give our readers an opportunity of seeing a
coloured representation of one of the most scarce and magnificent plants
introduced into this country, we have this number deviated from our
usual plan, with respect to the plates, and though in so doing we shall
have the pleasure of gratifying the warm wishes of many of our readers,
we are not without our apprehensions least others may not feel perfectly
well satisfied; should it prove so, we wish such to rest assured that
this is a deviation in which we shall very rarely indulge and never but
when something uncommonly beautiful or interesting presents itself: to
avoid the imputation of interested motives, we wish our readers to be
apprized that the expences attendant on the present number, in
consequence of such deviation, have been considerably
augmented
, not
lowered.

It is well known to many Botanists, and others, who have experienced Sir

Joseph Banks
's well known liberality, that previous to the
publication of the
Hortus Kewensis
he made a new genus of this plant,
which had before been considered as a species of
Heliconia
, and named
it
Strelitzia
in honour of our
[Pg 25]
most gracious Queen

Charlotte
; coloured engravings of which, executed under his
direction, he presented to his particular friends; impressions of the
same plate have been given in the aforesaid work, in which we are
informed that this plant was introduced to the royal garden at Kew, by
Sir
Joseph Banks
, Bart. in the year 1773, where it lately
flowered—of some other plants introduced after that period from the
Cape, of which it is a native, one flowered in the Pine stove of

Bamber Gascoyne
, Esq. several years ago, from whence Mr.

Millar
drew his figure, and the plant from which our drawing
was made flowered this spring, in the bark stove of the garden belonging
to the Apothecaries Company, at Chelsea, where it will also soon flower
again.

This plant has usually been confined to the stove, where it has been
placed in a pot, and plunged into the tan, as the plants in such
situations usually are; it has been found that when the roots have been
confined to the narrow limits of a pot, the plant has rarely or never
flowered, but that when the roots have by accident extended into the
rotten tan, it has readily thrown up flowering stems, the best practice
therefore, not only with this, but many other plants, is to let the
roots have plenty of earth to strike into. As it is a Cape plant it may
perhaps be found to succeed best in the conservatory.

It has not, that we know of, as yet ripened its seeds in this country;
till it does, or good seeds of it shall be imported, it must remain a
very scarce and dear plant, as it is found to increase very slowly by
its roots: plants are said to be sold at the Cape for Three Guineas
each.

General Description of the STRELITZIA REGINÆ.

From a perennial stringy root shoot forth a considerable number of
leaves, standing upright on long footstalks, front a sheath of some one
of which, near its base, springs the flowering stem, arising somewhat
higher than the leaves, and terminating in an almost horizontal
long-pointed spatha, containing about six or eight flowers, which
becoming vertical as they spring forth, form a kind of crest, which the
glowing orange of the Corolla, and fine azure of the Nectary, renders
[Pg 26]

truly superb. The outline in the third plate of this number, is intended
to give our readers an idea of its general habit and mode of growth.

Particular Description of the same.

ROOT perennial, stringy, somewhat like that of the tawny Day-lily
(Hemerocallis fulva); strings the thickness of the little finger,
blunt at the extremity, extending horizontally, if not confined,
to the distance of many feet.

LEAVES numerous, standing upright on their footstalks, about a foot in
length, and four inches in breadth, ovato-oblong, coriaceous,
somewhat fleshy, rigid, smooth, concave, entire on the edges,
except on one side towards the base, where they are more or less
curled, on the upper side of a deep green colour, on the under
side covered with a fine glaucous meal, midrib hollow above and
yellowish, veins unbranched, prominent on the inside, and
impressed on the outside of the leaf, young leaves rolled up.

LEAF-STALKS about thrice the length of the leaves, upright, somewhat
flattened, at bottom furnished with a sheath, and received into
each other, all radical.

SCAPUS or flowering stem unbranched, somewhat taller than the leaves,
proceeding from the sheath of one of them, upright, round, not
perfectly straight, nearly of an equal thickness throughout, of a
glaucous hue, covered with four or five sheaths which closely
embrace it. Two or more flowering stems spring from the same root,
according to the age of the plant.

SPATHA terminal, about six inches in length, of a glaucous hue, with a
fine bright purple at its base, running out to a long point,
opening above from the base to within about an inch of the apex,
where the edges roll over to one side, forming an angle of about
forty-five degrees, and containing about six flowers.
[Pg 27]

FLOWERS of a bright orange colour, becoming upright, when perfectly
detached from the spatha, which each flower is a considerable time
in accomplishing. In the plant at Chelsea, the two back petals,
or, more properly segments of the first flower, sprang forth with
the nectary, and while the former became immediately vertical, the
latter formed nearly the same angle as the spatha; four days
afterwards the remaining segment of the first flower, with the two
segments and nectary of the second came forth, and in the same
manner at similar intervals all the flowers, which were six in
number, continued to make their appearance.

COROLLA deeply divided into three segments, which are ovato-lanceolate,
slightly keeled, and somewhat concave, at the base white, fleshy,
and covered with a glutinous substance flowing in great quantities
from the nectary.

NECTARY of a fine azure blue and most singular form, composed of two
petals, the upper petal very short and broad, with a whitish mucro
or point, the sides of which lap over the base of the other petal;
inferior petal about two inches and a half in length, the lower
half somewhat triangular, grooved on the two lowermost sides, and
keeled at bottom, the keel running straight to its extremity, the
upper half gradually dilating towards the base, runs out into two
lobes more or less obtuse, which give it an arrow-shaped form,
bifid at the apex, hollow, and containing the antheræ, the edges
of the duplicature crisped and forming a kind of frill from the

attached to the nectary till the nectary decays.

Mr.
Fairbairn
, to whose abilities and industry the Companies
Garden at Chelsea is indebted for its present flourishing state, being
desirous of obtaining ripe seeds, I had no opportunity of examining the
germen.

Such were the appearances which presented themselves to us in the plant
which flowered at the Chelsea Garden; that they are liable to
considerable variation is apparent from the figure of Mr.

Millar
, which appears to have been drawn from a very luxuriant
specimen, as two spathæ grow from one flowering stem, the stigma is also
remarkably convoluted, many other appearances are likewise represented,
which our plant did not exhibit: in the figure given in the
Hortus
Kewensis
, the stigma appears to have separated from the nectary on the
first opening of the flower, and to be split into three parts, neither
of which circumstances took place in our plant till they were both in a
decaying state.

This species of Narcissus, though well described and figured by the old
Botanists, especially
Parkinson
; has been overlooked by

Linnæus
.

It is undoubtedly the
incomparable Daffodil
of

Parkinson
, figured in his Garden of Pleasant Flowers; and the

incomparabilis
of
Miller
's
Dict. ed. 6. 4to.
the latter
informs us, that he received roots of it from Spain and Portugal, which
fixes its place of growth.

It is a very hardy bulbous plant, and flowers in April; in its single
state it is very ornamental, the petals are usually pale yellow, and the
nectary inclined to orange, which towards the brim is more brilliant in
some than in others; in its double state, it is well known to Gardeners,
by the name of Butter and Egg Narcissus, and of this there are two
varieties, both of which produce large shewy flowers, the one with
colours similar to what we have above described, which is the most
common, the other with petals of a pale sulphur colour, almost white,
and the nectary bright orange; this, which is one of the most ornamental
of the whole tribe, is named in the Dutch catalogues, the
Orange
Phœnix
; its blossoms are so large as frequently to require
supporting; its bulbs may be had of many of the Nurseries about London,
and of those who, profiting by the supineness of our English Gardeners,
import bulbs from abroad.

Like most of the tribe, this species will grow well without any care,
the bulbs of the double sort should be taken up yearly, otherwise they
are apt to degenerate.

The
Hyacinthus racemosus
and
botryoides
are both cultivated in
gardens, but the former here figured is by far the most common;

racemosus
and
botryoides
, though different words, are expressive of
the same meaning, the former being derived from the Latin term

racemus
, the latter from the Greek one βοτρυϛ, both of which
signify a bunch of grapes, the form of which the inflorescence of these
plants somewhat resembles, and hence they have both been called Grape
Hyacinths, but as confusion thereby arises, we have thought it better to
call this species the Starch Hyacinth, the smell of the flower in the
general opinion resembling that substance, and leave the name of Grape
Hyacinth for the
botryoides
.

The
Hyacinthus racemosus
grows wild in the corn fields of Germany, in
which it increases so fast by offsets from the root as to prove a very
troublesome weed, and on this account it must be cautiously introduced
into gardens.

It flowers in April and May.

We have found the Nurserymen very apt to mistake it for the

botryoides
, a figure of which it is our intention to give in some
future number.

We are more and more convinced, that in our eagerness, for novelties, we
daily lose plants by far more ornamental than the new ones we introduce;
the present, a most charming spring plant, with which the Gardens
abounded in the time of
Parkinson
, is now a great rarity; its
blossoms, which are uncommonly brilliant, come forth in April, and, like
those of many other plants, appear to advantage only when the sun
shines.

It may be propagated either by seeds, or by parting its roots in Autumn,
in the former way we may obtain many beautiful varieties.

It prefers a light loamy soil and moderately exposed situation.

Roots of a variety of this plant with scarlet double flowers are
imported from Holland, under the name, of

The flowers of this plant, a native of Gibraltar, bear some resemblance
to those of the Common Candy-Tuft, but when they blow in perfection,
they are usually twice as large; hence they are highly ornamental in the
green-house, which early in the Spring, the time of their coming forth,
stands in need of some such shewy flowers.

This plant is easily raised from cuttings, and easily preserved; it may
be kept through the Winter in a common hot-bed frame, and in mild
Winters will stand abroad, especially if sheltered amongst rock-work;
its greatest enemy is moisture in the Winter season, this often proves
fatal to it, as indeed a long continued damp atmosphere does to many
others; the Nurserymen about London complain of losing more plants the
last mild Winter, from this cause, than they generally do from severe
frosts. In a little green-house which I had in my late garden,
Lambeth-Marsh, most of the plants became absolutely mouldy; in such
seasons then, though in point of cold the plants may not require it, we
must dissipate the superfluous moisture by a gentle heat.

This plant receives its generic name from
Claudius Alstrœmer

(son of Sir
Jonas Alstrœmer
, a most respectable Swedish
Merchant) who first found the other most beautiful species the

Pelegrina
in Spain, whither it had been transmitted from Peru; its
trivial name
Ligtu
is a provincial one.

According to
Fewillee
, who has written on the plants of Peru,
this species is found on the banks of the rivers in Chili: we treat it,
and successfully, as a stove plant; its flowers, which usually make
their appearance in February and March, emit a fragrance scarcely
inferior to Mignonet; its leaves, contrary to most others, grow
inverted, which is effected by a twist of the footstalk, and afford an
excellent example of
Linnæus
's
Folium resupinatum
; the
filaments, after the pollen is discharged, turn upwards, and the antheræ
become almost globular.

It is usually propagated by parting its roots in Autumn.

Our figure was drawn from a plant which flowered extremely well in the
stove of Messrs.
Grimwood
and Co. Kensington.

Plants which flower early, and continue a long while in bloom, are
deservedly preferred, more especially by those who content themselves
with a partial collection; of that number is the present species of
Alyssum, which begins to flower in March, and continues to blossom
through April, May, and June, and, if favourably situated, during most
of the summer.

It is properly a rock plant, being hardy, forming with very little care
a neat tuft of flowers, and not apt to encroach on its neighbours.

May be propagated by parting its roots in Autumn, or by cuttings.

Is a native of the Levant, according to Mr.
Aiton

cultivated by Mr.
Miller

"All the sorts multiply very fast by offsets, so that when once
obtained, there will be no occasion to raise them from seeds: for the
roots put out offsets in great plenty, most of which will flower the
following season, whereas those from seeds are three or four years
before they flower. These plants will not thrive through the winter in
the full ground in England, so must be planted in pots, and placed under
a frame in winter, where they may be protected from frost, but in mild
weather should enjoy the free air; but they must be guarded from mice,
who are very fond of these roots, and if not prevented will devour
them."

There are few old gardens which do not abound with this plant; it bears
great affinity to our Hare-bell, with which it appears to have been
confounded by most Botanists.
Parkinson
thus discriminates it: "This
Spanish bell-flowred Jacinth is very like the former English or Spanish
Jacinth, but greater in all parts, as well of leaves as flowers, many
growing together at the toppe of the stalke; with many short greene
leaves among them, hanging doune their heads with larger, greater, and
wider open mouths, like unto bels of a darke blew colour, and no good
sent."
Park. Parad.

Though not remarkable for the fineness of its colours, or pleasing from
its fragrance, it contributes with other bulbous plants to decorate the
flower border or plantation in the spring, when flowers are most wanted.

It is very hardy, and increases abundantly by offsets; its seeds also
ripen well.

It usually flowers in April or May, but may be forwarded by artificial
heat.

It rarely puts forth offsets from the root, but readily produces seeds,
by which it is propagated without difficulty.

When it blossoms in perfection it truly deserves the name of superb,
which Mr.
Aiton
has given it, the stem rising to the height of
three feet or more, and producing from two to five flowers.

Of this genus there is only one species described by authors, and which

Linnæus
has named in honour of our countryman
Mark
Catesby
, Author of the Natural History of Carolina.

"This shrub was discovered by Mr.
Catesby
, near Nassau-town, in
the Island of Providence, where he saw two of them growing, which were
all he ever saw; from these he gathered the seeds and brought them to
England.

"It is propagated by seeds, which must be procured from the country
where it naturally grows. If the entire fruit are brought over in sand,
the seeds will be better preserved; the seeds must be sown in small pots
filled with light sandy earth, and plunged into a moderate hot-bed of
Tanner's-bark. If the seeds are good, the plants will appear in
[Pg 53]
about
six weeks; these plants make little progress for four or five years. If
the nights should prove cold the glasses must be covered with mats every
evening. As these plants grow slowly, so they will not require to be
removed out of the seed-pots the first year, but in the Autumn the pots
should be removed into the stove, and plunged into the tan-bed; in
spring the plants should be carefully taken up, and each planted in a
separate small pot, filled with light sandy earth, and plunged into a
fresh hot-bed of Tanner's-bark. In Summer when the weather is warm, they
should have a good share of air admitted to them, but in Autumn must be
removed into the stove; where they should constantly remain, and must be
treated afterwards in the same manner as other tender exotic plants."

Miller's Dict.

It is more usual with Nurserymen to increase this plant by cuttings.

Our drawing was made from a plant which flowered this Spring, with Mr.

Colvill
, Nurseryman, King's-Road, Chelsea.

It flowers most part of the Summer, but not so freely as many other
stove-plants.

The Rubus arcticus grows wild in the northern parts of Europe and
America, in moist, sandy, and gravelly places.
Linnæus
has
figured and minutely described it in his
Flora Lapponica
, out of
gratitude, as he expresses himself, for the benefits reaped from it in
his Lapland journey, by the nectareous wine of whose berries he was so
often recruited when sinking with hunger and fatigue; he observes that
the principal people in the north of Sweden make a syrup, a jelly, and a
wine, from the berries, which they partly consume themselves, and partly
transmit to Stockholm, as a dainty of the most delicious kind; and truly
he adds, of all the wild Swedish berries this holds the first place.

Our figure does not correspond altogether with
Linnæus
's
description, but it is drawn as the plant grew; culture doubtless made
it produce more than its usual number of flowering stems and petals.

It grows readily and increases rapidly in bog-earth, on a north border,
and flowers in May and June, but very rarely ripens its fruit in

made a distinct genus of them under the name of
Muscari
, in which he
is followed by
Miller

Linnæus
, for they differ so much that no student would consider
the present plant as belonging to the same genus with the Hare-bell.

This species grows wild in the corn-fields of Spain, Portugal, and some
parts of Germany, and flowers in May and June.

It is distinguished more by its singularity than beauty, the flowers on
the summit of the stalk differing widely in colour from the others, and
being mostly barren:
Parkinson
says, "the whole stalke with the
flowers upon it, doth somewhat resemble a long Purse tassell, and
thereupon divers Gentlewomen have so named it."

It is a hardy bulbous plant, growing readily in most soils and
situations, and usually propagated by offsets.

culture; as the first name taken from its time of flowering is the most
expressive, we have followed Mr.

in adopting it.

It is an old inhabitant of the English gardens, and a most desirable
one, as it flowers in the spring; produces fine shewy blossoms, which
expand wide when exposed to the sun, is hardy and readily cultivated.

Grows wild on the mountainous pastures of some parts of Germany.

It may be increased by parting its roots in Autumn or Spring, or by
seed.

strong plant of it flowered also this summer at Messrs.

It obviously differs from the other more tender plants of this genus, in
the colour of its flowers, which are of a fine scarlet, with large white
somewhat rhomboidal spots, on several of the lowermost divisions of the
Corolla; strong plants will throw up a stem three or four feet high.

It is most probably a native of the Cape, flowers with us in July and

A vein of singularity runs through the whole of this plant, its stalks
are unequally and obtusely quadrangular, sometimes more evidently
triangular; its leaves few, and remarkably small; its flowers, on the
contrary, are uncommonly large, and what is more extraordinary have only
four petals; previous to their expansion they exhibit also an appearance
somewhat outrè, the body of the filaments being bent so as to form a
kind of bow, in which state we have represented one of the blossoms in
our figure.

When it flowers in perfection, which it is not apt to do in all places,
the largeness of its blossoms renders it one of the most ornamental of
the genus.

There is a variety of it with beautifully coloured leaves, of which we
have availed ourselves in its representation.

It flowers from June, to August, and September; requires the same
treatment as the more common Geraniums, and is readily propagated by

Is according to

a native of
Majorca
;
Miller

says that it grows naturally in the Island of
Minorca,
from whence the
seeds were sent to England by Mr.
Salvador
, an Apothecary at
Barcelona, in the year 1718.

The stalks of this species are usually of a bright red colour, and
covered with little warts; the leaves are small with many depressions on
their upper sides like scars; the flowers are not always solitary, but
frequently form a kind of Corymbus.

It is a hardy green-house plant, and readily propagated by cuttings.

It flowers during most of the Summer.

Clusius
informs us in his
Hist. pl. rar. p. 68.
that he
received from
Thomas Penny
, a Physician of London, in the year
1580, a figure of this elegant plant, and who the next year shewed a
dried specimen of the same in London, which had been gathered in the
Island of Majorca, and named by him μυρτο κἱσον, or
Myrtle-Cistus
[2]
it appears therefore that this plant has long been
known, if not cultivated in this country.

We may remark that
Clusius
's figure of this plant is not
equally expressive with many of his others.

This new species of Kalmia which we have called
hirsuta,
the stalk,
leaves, and calyx, being covered with strong hairs, was imported from
Carolina in the Spring of 1790, by Mr.
Watson
, Nurseryman at
Islington, with whom several plants of it flowered this present Autumn,
about the middle of September, from one of which our drawing was made.

The plants were brought over with their roots enclosed in balls of the
earth in which they naturally grew, which on being examined appeared of
a blackish colour, and full of glittering particles of sand; similar
indeed to the bog-earth which we find on our moors and heaths; there is
therefore little doubt (for no account accompanied the plants) but this
Kalmia grows on moorish heaths, or in swamps.

In its general appearance it bears some resemblance to the
Andromeda
Dabœcii
; from the specimens we have seen its usual height would
appear to be from two to three feet; it grows upright; the flowers which
are about the size of those of the
Kalmia glauca
, are of a purple
colour, and contrary to all the other known Kalmia's grow in racemi.

It is propagated by layers, and requires the same treatment as the rest
of the genus, that is, to be planted in bog-earth, on a north border: as
this however is a new, and of course a dear plant, it will be most
prudent till we know what degree of cold it will bear, to keep it in a
pot of the same earth, plunged in the same situation, which may be
removed in the Winter to a green-house or hot-bed frame.

Father
Feuillee
[3]
figures and describes three species of

Alstrœmeria
, viz.
Pelegrina
,
Ligtu
, and
Salsilla
, common
names by which they are severally distinguished in Peru: the present
species, which is much valued by the natives on account of its beauty,
he informs us is found wild on a mountain to the north of, and a mile
distant from Lima.

From Peru, as might be expected, the present plant found its way into
Spain, from whence by the means of his beloved friend

Alstrœmer
,
Linnæus
first received seeds of it; the
value he set on the acquisition is evident from the great care he took
of the seedling plants, preserving them through the winter in his
bed-chamber.

According to Mr.
Aiton
, this species was introduced to the
Royal Garden at Kew, by Messrs.
Kennedy
and
Lee
, as
long ago as the year 1753.

Being a mountainous plant, it is found to be much more hardy than the

Ligtu
already figured, and is generally treated as a green-house
plant; it is found, however, to flower and ripen its seeds better under
the glass of a hot-bed frame, where air is freely admitted.

It flowers from June to October, and, though a perennial, is generally
raised from seeds, yet may sometimes be increased by parting its roots,
which somewhat resemble those of the asparagus: the seeds should be sown
in the spring, in a pot of light earth, on a gentle hot-bed, either of
dung or tan.

The present, with many other species of Lupine, is very generally
cultivated in flower gardens, for the sake of variety, being usually
sown in the spring with other annuals; where the flower-borders are
spacious, they may with propriety be admitted, but as they take up much
room, and as their blossoms are of short duration, they are not so
desirable as many other plants.

It is a native of Sicily, and flowers in June and July.

We have often thought that the management of the kitchen garden, in
point of succession of crops, might be advantageously transplanted to
the flower garden; in the former, care is taken to have a regular
succession of the annual delicacies of the table, while in the latter, a
single sowing in the spring is thought to be all-sufficient; hence the
flower garden, which in August, September, and part of October, might be
covered with a profusion of bloom, exhibits little more than the decayed
stems of departed annuals.

This plant recommends itself by its fragrance rather than its beauty, so
delicious indeed is the odour it diffuses, that it is considered as
essential to every green-house and stove.

"It grows naturally in Peru, from whence the seeds were sent by the
younger Jussieu to the royal garden at Paris, where the plants produced
flowers and seeds; and from the curious garden of the Duke d'Ayen, at
St. Germain's, I was supplied with some of the seeds, which have
succeeded, in the Chelsea garden, where the plants have flowered and
perfected their seeds for some years."
Miller's Gard. Dict.

You may consider it either as a stove or a green-house plant, the former
is more congenial to it in the winter season.

A pure atmosphere is essential to its existence, as I experienced at
Lambeth-Marsh, where I in vain endeavoured to cultivate it.

It is propagated by cuttings as easily as any Geranium, and requires a
similar treatment; in hot weather it must be well supplied with water,
and in winter carefully guarded against frost, so fatal to most of the
natives of Peru.

I am indebted for seeds of this plant to my very worthy and liberal
friend
Nich. Gwyn
, M. D. of Ipswich, to whose penetrating
genius, and learned researches, Botany owes much.

As its name implies, it is a native of the province of Tangier, on the
Barbary coast; appears to have been cultivated here, according to the

Hort. Kew.
in 1713, but is not mentioned in the 6th 4to. edit. of

Miller
's Dictionary.

It may be considered as forming a valuable addition to our stock of
annuals, being a beautiful plant, and easily cultivated: it thrives best
on a moderately dry soil, warmly situated: should be sown in the spring
with other annuals.

I have observed, that in the middle of summer, a hot unclouded sun,
which is favourable to the expansion of most of the flowers of this
class, is too powerful for those of the present plant, which then appear
to the greatest advantage in warm hazy weather.

The leaves of this species exhibit, on being touched, a manifest
viscidity, or clamminess, which, independent of their shape, serves to
characterize the species; the middle of the leaf is also in general
stained with purple, which adds considerably to its beauty; but this
must be regarded rather as the mark of a variety, than of the species.

With most of its congeners, it is a native of the Cape, and of modern
date in this country, being introduced to the royal garden at Kew, by
Messrs.
Kennedy
and
Lee
, in the year 1777.

It flowers from May to September; is readily propagated by cuttings, and
sometimes raised from seeds, from whence several varieties have been

The old Botanists appear to have been wonderfully at a loss to what
family they should refer this very singular plant, as will appear on
consulting the synonyms;
Burman
at length made a distinct genus
of it, naming it
Ferraria
in honour of
Joh.
Baptista Ferrarius
, by whom it was described, and very well
figured, in his
Flora feu de Florum Cultura
, published at Amsterdam,
in 1646.

Mr.
Miller
informs us, that he received roots of this plant
from Dr.
Job Baster
, F. R. S. of Zirkzee, who obtained it from
the Cape, of which it is a native.

In the vegetable line, it is certainly one of the most singular and
beautiful of nature's productions; much it is to be regretted that its
flowers are of very short duration, opening in the morning and finally
closing in the afternoon of the same day; a strong plant will, however,
throw out many blossoms in succession.

In its structure and œconomy, it approaches very near to the

Sisyrinchium
.

It flowers very early in the spring, from February to May, and is
usually propagated by offsets, which its bulbs produce in tolerable
plenty. It requires a treatment similar to the Ixias and other Cape
bulbs. Our figure was drawn from a plant which flowered this spring, in
the possession of
R. Forster
, Esq. of Turnham-Green.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

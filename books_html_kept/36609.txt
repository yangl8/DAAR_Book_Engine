GIORGIONE

Scene
:
A work-room of

Giorgione

on the edge of the Lagoon in which
lie the Campo Santo and Murano. It is littered with brushes, canvases,
casts, etc., and its walls are frescoed indiscriminately with saints and
bacchantes, satyrs and Madonnas, on backgrounds religious or woodland. A
door is on the right back; and foliate Gothic windows, in the rear,
reveal the magic water with its gliding gondolas. On a support toward
the centre of the room is a picture—covered, and not far from it, a
couch.

Late Afternoon.

Giorgione
,
who has been sitting anguished on the couch, rises with
determined bitterness. As he does so,

Bellini

enters anxiously.

[4]

Bellini.
Giorgione!

Giorgione
(
turning
). It is you?

Bellini.
Your word came to me,

In San Lazzario where I labored late,

And shakes my troubled heart. You will not do this!

Giorgione.
Yes!

Bellini.
How my son! her picture! as a wanton's!

Giorgione.
Tho it has been till now my adoration!

The fairest of my dreams and the most holy!

Yes, by the virtue of all honest women,

If such there be in Venice,

I swear it shall be borne by ribald hands

Thro the very streets.

Bellini.
My son!

Giorgione.
A public thing!

[
Points to picture.

Fit for the most lascivious! who now

Shall gaze on what I had beheld alone,

On what was purer to me than the Virgin!

The very pimps and panders of the Piazza

Shall if they will whet appetite upon it,
[5]

And smack their losel lips.

Bellini.
And to what end?

Giorgione.
Her shame!

Bellini.
The deeds of wounded pride and love

Work not so, but fall back upon the doer—

Or on some other.

Giorgione.
I care not!

Bellini.
Nor have,

Ever, to heed me! as Aretino,

Who turns your praise to Titian, has told.

For your wild will runs ever without curb,

And I who reared you, as my very own,

Must pay the fall.

Giorgione.
No!

Bellini.
And the piety

I would have won you to in the past days

Is wasted. The Madonnas

I painted with a heart inspired of Heaven

You paint with pride.

Giorgione.
But with all gratitude!
[6]

Ah yes, believe me,

And with a rich remembrance!

For scarce oblivion could wipe from me

How as a wasted lad I came to Venice—

A miserable, patched and pallid waif,

With but an eye to see and hand to shape!

You took me from the streets and taught me all

The old can teach the young, until my name

Is high in Venice—

Linked with that of Beauty—

"Giorgione! our Giorgione!" do they cry

On the canals, the very gondoliers.

And in a little while it should have glowed

Immortal on the breast of Italy,

As does Apelles on the page of Greece,

For I was half-divine, until——

Bellini.
Until

A girl whom you had fixed your heart upon

With boundless folly, you who should have lived

With but one passion—that of brain and brush—
[7]

Until she——

Giorgione.
Say it!

Bellini.
This Isotta——

Giorgione.
Ai!

Whom I had chosen o'er a hundred others

To soar with!

To soar and then in wedded peace to prize!

This false Isotta

Whom in poverty

I found, as you found me, and loved to madness.

This fair Isotta

Whom I would have made

All Venice to be a halo for—as were

Cities of old for queens of sceptred love:

Until she leaves, departs, forsakes me, goes

Away, worthless away, from my true arms,

With Luzzi, a lank boy.

Bellini.
So. And most strange.

Giorgione.
No, nothing a woman does is ever strange!

Will they not cloak a lie in innocence,
[8]

A treachery in veiling soft caresses—

Tho to the Mass unceasingly they fare

And say like her their aves night and noon?

Have they a want that wantons not with guile,

A tear that is not turgid with deceit?

Are not their passions blown by every wind?

Have they not all the straying heart of Helen?

Then why must I,

Who had in me a hope

That rivalled Raphael's or Leonardo's,

Keep, cozened so, that I contemn her shame?

Bellini.
Because she is a woman—whom you tempted,

Tho with all trust to wed her—and you know not

Whether her going was of shamelessness.

Giorgione
(
laughing bitterly
). Or whether she may not yet return, today,

And with a heart that is a nymph's, a soul

That is a nun's,

Beguile me back to doting?

Whether she may not—
[9]

With that body God

Might once, deceived, have moulded angels after—?

Then flaunt her thralling of me to the world,

Whose ready lips should laugh where'er we went

And whisper, "Isotta, there! Giorgione's mistress!

Who makes a mocking of him?"

Bellini.
Never! never!

Only your unrelenting brain would think it.

For this I know of her, that tho she has

Deserted you for what must seem to be

Only a new-found passion—

Yet is she womanly, and did you give her,

As now you mean, to avid lusting eyes,

Life would be smitten from her.

Giorgione.
As it should!

Bellini.
And then from you, repentant of her fate?

No, no, my son, I have not seen you rise,

A planet from the sea, the world's first painter,

To set in this:
[10]

You owe my fathering more.

And listen, I have brought to you a way

Of laurels for forgetting. I have come

With a commission from the Signoria,

[
Takes it from his breast.

Which names you the chief glory of this city

And votes you proud permission to adorn

San Marco's highest altar with perfection.

Giorgione.
And which I spurn, an insult in its pity!

[
Flings it from him.

As they shall learn—these silk and velvet Signors,

Whose condescending ducats buy the dreams

Of the immortal!

Or no!... I meant not that—to wound a kindness.

Bellini.
Your ways have ever been the ways of wounding.

Giorgione.
And to the end must be. (
Brokenly
)

[11]
For now my hand

Is palsied! I can never paint again.

Colour and shaping light turn in my soul

To chaos and to blindness—to despair!

The brush I lift, to sterile pain more loth!

I yearn and impotence alone arises.

That picture has dried beauty's vein within me

And left me ... Ah!... She shall atone it! (
calls
) Gigia!

Shameless she is and shall be seen it!—Gigia!—

[
Bitterly.

Aretino, who is the tongue of lewdness,

And Titian, who trips to it, may gloat,

[
Gigia

hobbles in.

But they——

Bellini.
Giorgione! you have sent for them?

Giorgione
(
to

Gigia
). Whoever seeks my door is bidden—all!

Gigia.
Yes, Messer Giorgio.

Giorgione
(
as she delays
). Go.

Gigia.
Before I speak?

[12]
Giorgione.
Of what?

Gigia.

How can I tell you, if I may

Not speak? And you should hear.... (
Crossing herself
) It is the plague.

A whisper is about

That it has broken out at last in Venice.

[
Giorgione

staring at her, trembles and seems slowly
stricken—while his eyes fill as with some evil irrecoverable
remembrance.

Bellini
(
fearing for him
). Giorgione!

Giorgione.
Oh!... and yet ... nothing ... a dream

That came to me last night—as if from death.

Bellini.
Then, O my son, it is a premonition,

A pall against this purpose! that you may

Not let these ribald two—

Aretino, this poet and depraver,

And Titian snared within his pagan senses,

Enter and gaze upon.... O boy, you will not!

Despoil the picture,

Scatter it to the seas,

And vow never again to paint another,
[13]

Tho that would break my heart, but promise me——

[
A knocking interrupts, and a voice without calls lustily
:

Voice
: The gods of paint and passion ever gird us!

Where's Messer Giorgione? Ho! Ho, ho!

[
Gigia

hurries out.

Giorgione
(
after a pause, calling
). Aretino!

Aretino.
Ai, light of ladies' eyes!

And with him a better! Shall we sing for entrance?

(
Begins
)—A wench I had,

But where is she—?

A-ho!

Old Gigia, is it? Then we come apace,

[
Enters leeringly with

Titian
.

Like satyrs to the piping of Adonis!

[
With irony.

A health to you, O heaven-born of Venice!

[
To

Bellini
.

And to you, glorious dauber of Madonnas!
[14]

But, bah! the smell of melancholy! Come,

What is it? The tale is out about the maid?

And therefore tears?

[
Laughs.

Well, by the lids of Venus, Giorgio,

It serves you well—or Eve was not a woman!

There were too many ripe for your assay.

Why, I believe that every damsel's lips

On the lagoons were pinched with longing for you!

Titian.
Or enough, at least, to send spleen, Giorgio,

Into my eyes.

Giorgione.
They will no more, Titian.

Aretino.
In sooth! for since one wench in all the world

Prefers another, he will play the monk!

Since she, the amorous sun-kissed Isotta,

Had charms too fair for
one
to satisfy!

And yet—to choose this Luzzi,

[15]
This swaddling acolyte of Innocence,

For her new light-o'-love! to choose him out,

When, for a whiff, she might have had my arms——

[
Giorgione

quivers.

O, Titian, by the gods!

Bellini.
Aretino!...

Giorgione.
Stay, let him speak, my master, as he wills.

Aretino.
I say then, Seraph, of your amorosa,

That she deceived me—

That I thought her dreams

Were chaster than the moon, or by my beard,

Which is not born, I should have tricked her senses

Away from you ... if lies and treachery

And tempting honeyed verses could have done it!

For an Elysium like her warm round body

I never looked upon.

Bellini.
Aretino!

Giorgione.
Peace! he shall speak! for this is what should be.

Aretino.
Ai, Messer Bellini, and your age forgets

That he is well consoled with the dear thought
[16]

That her first joy was his.

Bellini.

Ah!...

Aretino.
And that vision—!

Why, I have peeped upon her face, no farther.

But to have seen the beauty he has seen,

The Aphrodite-dream of loveliness,

I would have dared virginity's last door.

Giorgione.
Then you shall see it.

Bellini.
My son!

Giorgione.
Yes, tho I die!

Aretino.
How, what is this?

Giorgione
(
going to picture
). Aretino, Titian—

You are here, tho there is less than love between us:

For, pardon, if I say that you sometimes

Have loathed my triumphs.

Titian.
That is so, Giorgione.

But with the brush I yet shall equal them.

Giorgione.
You shall surpass them. For my last is done.

Titian.
Come, do you jest?

Giorgione.
My last, and it is there!
[17]

[
Points to picture.

There that you two whose tongues have been so busy

About the streets with laughing and innuendo,

From ear to ear with jest and utter joy—

You, Titian, a sycophant of Fame,

And you, Aretino, who incarnate lust,

May know that Giorgione is above you.

You coveted Isotta with your eyes,

Now you shall have her as shall all the world!

[
Flings the curtain back from the picture then sinks to the couch.

As they gaze on the unclothed form,

Bellini

turns away, when he
sees

Isotta

enter. She is pale and ill, but moves smilingly down
toward

Giorgione
,
till happening to see the picture, she gives a
deep cry.

Giorgione
,
springing to his feet, dazedly beholds her.

Bellini
(
speechless till he sees

Isotta's

pallor
).

Isotta! you are ill!... O would my breath
[18]

Had never lasted to this evil hour—!

Shall I not bring the leech? (
when she does not answer; to

Giorgione
) This price has pride!

[
He goes: then

Aretino

and

Titian
.
The curtain falls back.

Isotta
(
whose eyes have closed
). The flesh of women is their fate forever!

My poor, poor body! all I had to give

So desecrated.

Giorgione
(
hoarsely
). Why have you come here?

Isotta.
To see Messer Giorgione—who is brave.

[
Smiles as one shattered.

To hear Messer Giorgione—who is gentle

And honourable to women who are weak.

To—heal Messer Giorgione—then to die!

Giorgione.
Rather to kill!

Isotta.
Why, it may be. If love

Still leads me, it were best that it be slain.

Giorgione.
The love of a wanton?

Isotta
(
slowly
).
Who beholds her body

Given ... to unabated eyes—yet lives?
[19]

I think it must be so.

Giorgione.
Alluring lies!

Out of pale lips of treachery but lies!

You have returned to me, whom you have cursed

With craving for you,

With an immortal love,

Because this lisping Luzzi,

With whom you fled, weary of falsity,

Has cast you off.

Isotta
(
gently
).   Kind Luzzi!

Giorgione.
Ah! and blind?

Not knowing that you now are here again,

Where you disrobed to my adoring soul,

But thinking that you wait him with fair eyes

Of fond expectancy—as once for me!

Believing that your breath is beating only

With ecstasy for him!

Isotta.
He is—but Luzzi!

Giorgione.
And I but Giorgione, smiling quean!

[
She turns paler.

But Giorgione, a vassal to your sway?
[20]

Back to your orgies! and may Venus, goddess

Of black adulteries, but not of love,

Be with them! May your blood, that I believed

Vestal to all but me, run vile with passions

As any nymph's of Bacchus!

May your body,

That I have painted here, be to all time

An image of soul-cheating chastity!

[
His words have struck her down—and overwhelm him.

O, I am lost, lost, lost forevermore.

[
Falls into a seat.

Isotta
(
at length, from the couch, gathering strength
).

No, I have come for saving, Giorgione.

Now I can speak—but there is little time,

(
Strangely
) For Night is coming.

Giorgione
(
startled to questioning
). Isotta?

Isotta.
The still Night,

With Death's dark Gondola to waft me o'er.

[
Then as he realizes.

Nay, stay, stay! leave me not. There is no help.
[21]

For it must be.... A voice Beyond has said it.

And ere I drift out on the darkening ebb——

Giorgione.
Isotta!

Isotta.
Peace must be Giorgione's too.

Giorgione.
Speak—yet it cannot be—my heart is dead.

Isotta.
Then it shall rise again.—O Giorgione,

My lover once and lord, could you believe,

Even tho I went away from you and with

Another, that unchastity could touch

This body which had been holy to you?

Giorgione.
Isotta!

Isotta.
It is true that I deceived you,

[
With mystic fervor.

True that I went away from you and wed

Another——

Giorgione.
Ah!

Isotta.
And yet it was not Luzzi!

[
As he gazes.

Do you not know? you who so oft have told
[22]

On saintly walls the Magdalen's sad tears?

Sin, sin had seized me!

Sin with you to whom

I gave my body and soul unboundedly.

We revelled in unwedded ecstasy,

Laughed in our love over the starred lagoons.

Sang till the lute was like a thing that lived,

Danced happy as the fauns and nereids

That oft you told me of—

And clasped and kissed,

O kissed—until I knew that but one way

Was left to save my soul, Giorgione, one—

To wed me with the vows and veil to Christ.

[
Gazes at a crucifix.

Giorgione.
Isotta!

Isotta.
I am His! I fled to Him!

The Convent opened its grey arms to take me,

Santa Cecilia of the Healing Heart,

And Luzzi kindly led me to its door—

That you might so be foiled of following.

And with long vigils, fasts and penances
[23]

And prayers I sought oblivion of your face.

Until this illness strangely fell upon me.

I could not die until you, shriven too....

Giorgione.
Isotta! My Isotta!

[
Falls penitent before her, weeping.

Isotta (her heart eased).
Peace, at last.

Giorgione
(
rising
). Ah yes! and I am viler than the vilest!

For who remembers not that purity

Is priceless, ends impoverished of honour.

And yet ... there is no wrong irreparable!

And you must live tho all the angels die—

Live and be loosed from vows too vainly breathed,

That wedded we may win again delight!

Still I am Giorgione, and the sin

That we have sinned shall be painted away

With holy pictures....

Isotta.
Only the dead are holy,

Or they who die, tho living, to the world.

[
Sees the picture.

And eyes have looked upon me—
[24]

Hot eyes that burn my body up with shame.

Farewell, the tide will cool me, the lone wave

That washes in from Lido to my grave.

[
Looks toward the Campo Santo.

Giorgione.
Isotta!

Isotta
(
fainter
).
Night, the Night!...

Giorgione.
O stay!...

Isotta
(
in a fixed vision
)
It comes,

The Gondola! (
as if to an unseen Presence
) Row on, row on.

[
She dies. He sinks beside her stricken and still.

Gigia

enters.

Gigia.
Messer Giorgione, one has come to say——

[
Sees them, goes near and lifts

Isotta's

hand. Then, dropping it
with terror.

The plague! the plague! Ah!

Giorgione
(
rising
).
Woman, is it true?

[
Gigia

flees.

(
Mortally moved
)
[25]

Isotta, this kiss then of all the kisses

That I have slain thee with will God who dwells

In universal chastity forgive.

[
He kneels and presses his lips fervently to hers.

ARDUIN

CHARACTERS
[28]

Arduin
(
of Provence
)

An Alchemist

Ion

His Nephew

Rhasis

An Arab, his attendant and assistant

Myrrha

A Greek Girl

[29]

ARDUIN

Time
:
The Fifteenth Century.

Place
:
Egypt.

Scene
:
The laboratory of

Arduin

in a house on Nile opposite Cairo. It
is a large room on the walls of which mystic figures of the Hermetic
philosophy are drawn, together with the zodiac and other astronomical
signs; and many strange objects, animal and mineral, are to be seen
placed about. In the rear centre is a large sarcophagus. On either side
broad window openings reveal the Egyptian night, and one frames the
moonlit Sphinx and Pyramids. Toward the right front is a furnace with
alembics, retorts, etc.; right and left are doors, and on the left and
back another alcove before which hang curtains. Lamps burn.

[30]
Rhasis
,
who is busy about the furnace, in a troubled manner, lifts a
skull and is gazing at it, when

Ion

enters suddenly and stops, pale
with purpose.

Ion.
Rhasis——

Rhasis
(
starting and looking round
). Young master Ion! what is this?

[
Drops the skull.

Why have you left the city and come here?

Are you aware what hour you have chosen?

Ion.
That of his dreams. I learned today: yet came.

Rhasis.
And wherefore?

Ion.
To restrain calamity,

Which must await his reasonless belief—

And to regain his love that I have lost.

Rhasis.
And have not pondered what calamity

Would fall on you

Who would not learn his Art,

But from its heritage to penury turned,

If here and now he saw you

At this hour
[31]

When he believes that he shall raise the dead?

Ion.
His curse; for he would think me come to thwart him,

And that I had forgot whatever wrong,

Unexpiated still, my father did him;

[
Looks at sarcophagus.

And yet I will not go, for I have purposed—

And you tonight shall help me—(
pauses
)

Rhasis.
Unto what?

Ion.
Forgiveness of my disobedience—

That may be won from him with Myrrha's face.

Rhasis.
Myrrha's!

Ion.
Which can alone of earthly sights,

If what you tell of his dead wife be true:

And well you know it is!—He must behold her—

And hear our pleading.

Rhasis.
At an hour like this!

Ion.
Let her be placed yonder within those curtains,

While he is mingling here his mysteries,
[32]

And when he——

Rhasis.
By the Prophet who is Allah's,

Myrrha! Within this chamber! and tonight!

[
Ion goes to the door and leads Myrrha in.

Is there no heed in youth or hesitation,

But only hurrying want! Do you not know

He is without there, at this moment, saying

Unto the seven planets in their spheres,

The seven incantations against death?

And that he——

Ion.

I know only he must see her.

Rhasis.
And of all nights in the world, only tonight!

Myrrha.
No, Ion! let us go. I fear this place,

Its strangeness and that still sarcophagus

Appal me.

Ion.

And make you forget our love,

And the long bridal-hope of it deferred?

Rhasis.
Young master, she does not, in penury too!

But pleas tonight would ope no nuptial way.
[33]

Better than you I know it is not wise.

For ten years is it

I have dwelt with him

While he has sought in vain this great Elixir.

Ten passings of the pilgrims off to Mecca

His wife has lain in that sarcophagus,

Embalmed and waiting, as he thinks, to rise.

And now, this hour, he hopes that it shall be.

Ion.
And should it, will he not the more forgive me?

Or should it not, then seeing Myrrha's face,

Myrrha whom you have said is so much like her,

Will he not——

Myrrha.
Ion, no! but might—I fear!

So fond his grief is and unfaceable!

Let us return again unto the city

And to my kindred who will hold us dear.

[
Starting.

Listen, is it not he? (
Rhasis goes to window
) Take me away!

Ion.
And have him at the breaking of his dream
[34]

With none near—and our love's desire be lost?

Myrrha.
It will not: let us wait another time!

Ion.
Than this when most your face would deeply move him?

I cannot, and 'twould shame me! for you know

How dear to him is his dead wife who lies there,

[
Takes her hand.

And know our severed days!

And shall we bend the knee to cowardice,

Which ever has a premonition ready,

When you who are so like her might tonight——

[
She starts back, for

Rhasis
,
exclaiming, leaves the window.

Rhasis.
He comes.

Ion.

Now?

Rhasis.

Go: or take this on yourselves.

Ion.
Upon me be it! For there is no rest

Until his pardon weds us—and I pay him.

Rhasis.
Then but a word remains, young master, more:
[35]

To tell you—that I fear—lest thro long toil,

His mind....

Myrrha.
Oh! (
recoils
)

Ion.
It is not true!... No Myrrha! no!

[
Takes her in his arms.

And is ingratitude I scorn to heed.

[
Turns away.

Come then and by your beauty's likeness win him.

[
He leads her behind the curtains then goes, door left. A moment,
which leaves

Rhasis

distraught, and

Arduin

enters. He pauses, as
if at some presence; then, gazing on the sarcophagus, shudders with
hope and comes down.

Arduin.
The night at last when I again shall clasp her

And banish death to biers beyond the stars!

Rhasis
(
kneeling
). Master!

Arduin.

Rise up and never kneel again!
[36]

For from henceforth

I shall be lord of life,

The secret of the phœnix in my hand.

[
Lifts an alembic.

Gray have I grown in quest of it and old,

Youthless and as a leper to delight,

But it has come at last—at last has come!

[
Sets vessel down.

Rhasis.
And I rejoice, master, for I have toiled

With you these many years—but is it sure?

Arduin.
As the moon is in heaven! as the skies!

[
In an ecstasy.

For last night I beheld

In dreams deeper than day how it must be.

I saw a tomb far-hidden in the earth

And Life within it

Mixing salt and sulphur—

Twin elements

Of the great trinity.

I saw her hands pour out quick mercury
[37]

Upon a bat's wing wrought with hieroglyphics,

And then I saw her cast in gold and silver

That melted with strange voice and sudden flame,

The while she gazed on me most meaningly.

And then ... when all was done....

[
The vision consuming him.

My wife, my Rhea, lit with loveliness

And as a spirit clad with resurrection,

Rose up within my dream ... fair, young and glad!...

Rhasis.
But, master ... are dreams true?

Arduin.

Such dreams as these?

[
Kindling.

Rhasis.
Pardon! I know not—only that you say

Some come of Ophiuchus—

The demon you have warned me of—who oft

With thwarting laugh has struck the secret from you....

Many before have followed the mirage

Of dreams—but to more thirst: trust not too much!
[38]

Arduin.
But fear? fear? you are falling from me too?

Like Ion the son of him who ... you? you too?

At the prime moment?

Rhasis.

No, my master, no!

But I would spare you pain unbearable.

Arduin.
Ha! and believe—you do?—that all wise men

Of all the world could so have been deceived?

Believe—do, do?—that she
cannot
arise?

Did not great Hermes say of the Elixir

It should be found—

And did not Polydos,

The Greek, chancing upon it, raise his friends

In battle slain?...

Did not the Jew of Galilee, the Christ,

Whom even you name Prophet, likewise win it?

[
Peacelessly.

Speak!
[39]

Rhasis.
Master, yes!... But O! trust not too much.

Wiser, I know, than all Arabia

Are you—like to Mahomet—were it not

That you have set within your heart a woman.

But if, perchance, the Elixir does not prove——

Arduin.
Availing? Have not all things pointed to it?

The day she died

Did I not hear a voice

That breathed into my brain she should arise?

And as I waited did a book of wisdom

Not chance into my hands to show the way?

Were the first words I read not,
In ten years

The miracle shall come—

Revealed to you within the land of the Sphinx
?

Rhasis.
So read it, so! But——

Arduin.

Is this not that land?

Are not those stones the pyramids that thro

The ages have stood waiting for this hour—

When I shall bring her beauty back, today?
[40]

Is not that face the Sphinx,

Whose timeless and intemperable meaning

No man has read in desert, star, or sea,

But which must be the secret I unsphere?

Rhasis.
O master!

Arduin.

Fail, fail, fail? now to restore her?

Who died as you shall know, here ere she rises,

Because my brother—aieh! the father of Ion—

Who bore as well that name—

Desiring her, vilely accused her——

Myrrha
(
involuntarily, behind curtains
). Oh!...

Arduin
(
bewildered
). Who spoke? It was her voice?

[
Runs to sarcophagus.

Rhasis.

No, master, no!...

Arduin
(
slowly returning
). Fail, fail to bring her fairness from the tomb!

Her face which can alone sow finitude's

Fell desolation with enverdured dreams

And fill the ways of the world again with hope?

I tell you she eternal must arise—
[41]

Tho God die for it!

[
Begins to gird himself.

Must!... and the hour is now!—

Venus is in the house of ready Taurus,

The moon is full, and as I toiled today,

[
Goes to furnace.

From the alembic a strange cloud arose,

And once again her face!... Prepare! prepare!

Rhasis.
I will do all you say. But, master, if——

Arduin
(
immitigably
). No death-word more of doubt. It is the power

Which holds us futile from omnipotence.

Mete out the sulphur

Into the alembic

Of Cleopatra's crystal.—I must see her!

[
Rhasis hastens.

See her again, my Rhea, as she was,

When plucking first the poppies of Provence!

And hear flow from her

Words sweeter than Memnon's in the wind of dawn!
[42]

Here's gold and silver (
hands them
). She shall rise and say:

"Years pale you, pale your brow, my Arduin,

And touch to gray the treasure of your hair,

But not Antinous could be so fair

To me—or wonderful:

For you have brought me from the cold tomb to life!..."

The bat's wing then! And to the sarcophagus

To lift its lid! for I will wait no longer——

[
Takes alembic, as Rhasis obeys, and continues invokingly
:

But now, vial of immortality!

By the presaging of the seven planets,

And by the searchless sources of the Nile,

And by the prayers of Christian and of Heathen,

And by the elements earth, air and fire,

That hold within their intermingled veins

The secret of illimitable life—

By fate and time and God—I here conjure you

Bring forth the Elixir which shall make her rise!
[43]

[
He pours the ingredients, and quickly fumes arise. They clear and
a liquid is seen in the bottom of the glass. With a cry he starts
toward the sarcophagus, when Myrrha's face—which, excited, has
parted the curtains—stops him enspelled. Rhasis, unnerved, quits
the room—leaving them agaze.

Arduin
(
at length, as if to a spirit
).

I do not dream?... you have arisen?... Rhea!

[
Starting toward her.

Arisen ere I touched you?—O fear not!

For I am Arduin! do you not know me?

[
She trembles speechless.

O wonderful awaking! O ... at last!

Tho yet the memory of the tomb is on you!...

This land is Egypt, whither in my grief

I brought you, my dead bride! Look on me! see!

[
Stops quickly.

But no, not yet! until my youth comes back,
[44]

As now it will,

Over the sea from France!

Already passion lifts away the years

That weight its wings and I am as I was.

Now gaze upon me, now! Is it not I?

Myrrha.
Sir—!

Arduin.
Sir! O quickly see. For to my breast

Again has striving brought you, to my bosom!

The bitter nights are ended—the blind pits

Sleepless and infinite. Awake! stare not

So strangely! press your lips in praise to mine,

Your breast upon my breast!... Delay you still?

Myrrha.
O sir—!

Arduin.
See, see! the years have been too long.

[
Clasps her, dropping alembic.

My arms have waited an infinitude.

[
She struggles.

Do you not now remember with my lips

To yours, the brimming beauty of our youth?
[45]

Myrrha.
Release me!

Arduin.

Awake and know me! It is I!

Your lover Arduin whom once you wooed:

Whose every word was to you as a wind

Of God! whose every kiss.... Do you not see?

Myrrha.
No, no! I'm not your love—

Arduin.

Not—? You uprisen?

Has the tomb treachery to change the soul?

Ye skies, must I go mad now at this moment

When I have brought her back from destiny?

Not mine?... Awake! Oblivion enthralls you.

[
Suddenly starting from her.

Or is it that there in the grave, another—?

Myrrha.
No, no! but—

Arduin.

Ha, then! if not—if it be not—

Is it that here returned you wish another?

You who so gaze upon my goaded brow

And face grown old with toil to conquer death?
[46]

O youth ruthless to age! e'en tho its furrows

Were got for your delight!—Ingratitude!—

Have I so hungered thro long years to pluck

A flower of Hell back to the light!... No, No!

It cannot be!... You shall be mine!

Myrrha
(
in terror
).
Sir, sir!

Arduin.
Mad will I be, as they have thought me, mad

In holding that which I have given life.

Myrrha.
But you mistake!... I am not what you think.

Hear me, for I love one who——

Arduin.
Is not—I?

[
As to invisible judges.

You hear her say it?

Myrrha.

O, I love but Ion,

Your—

Arduin.
Ion, my brother! Then, God! it was true,

And being true thy Heaven is but a brothel!
[47]

She was unfaithful to me, as he said!

And in the other world has met and clasped him!

Myrrha.
No, let me speak!

Arduin.

And spurn me more with it?

Shall I abide mockery like a mummy!

Ha-ha! (
A laugh that racks him.
)

Years but to hear her say that she loves him!

To see her come back from the grave, where she

Has still embraced him, still—and to my face,

On which the rage of sleepless toil is wrought,

Tell me....

She shall die for it!        God, whose stars

Are vermin, she shall die!

Myrrha.

O!

Arduin
(
frenziedly
).
Die, die, die!

As trustless women should: until no womb

Of lies is left in the world! Die, and be shut

Again into the curst sarcophagus

From whence I brought her ...

Myrrha
(
in his grasp
). Sir!—help!—sir! do not!

O, I will love you!
[48]

Arduin.

Liar! and turn from him

Whom you betrayed me for—and swear again

False love to me? Then ... in the tomb do it!

[
Begins to choke her.

Myrrha.
O!

Arduin.
Aieh! cry out to him! will he not help you?

Myrrha.
Ion!

Arduin.
That word withering in your throat

Shall stale you past all hope of resurrection.

[
Strangles her—and then looks around.

So, it is done.... And now, back to your tomb,

Which I will bury in the desert sands

So deep that not eternity can find it.

[
Begins to draw her toward sarcophagus.

And yet (
stopping stricken
) all is not well ... I now could weep.

[
With lone anguish.

I know not wherefore—only that my heart
[49]

Is wounded and seems bleeding o'er the hours

That I must live!... O Rhea!... O, my love!

[
Strangely kissing her.

Do you not hear the nightingale that sang

The song of our betrothal in Provence?

It sits upon....

[
Changing again.

Accursed face! accurst! forevermore!

Within the tomb lie (
dragging her
) blind, deaf, motionless,

Until—

[
Looking into the coffin becomes transfixed, while

Myrrha's

limp
body slips slowly from his arms. He gazes at her, at his wife, and
tries to understand. But cannot, and so, standing long troubled,
moans
:

I am not well; perchance Rhasis will come

And tell me what it is that I desired.

Men should not toil o'ermuch; there's madness in it.
[50]

[
Then seeing

Myrrha's

face and starting from it wildly
:

Rhasis! Rhasis! Rhasis!... Oh-oh-oh-oh!

[
Runs madly off right, as

Ion

and

Rhasis

enter left. They look
around, see

Myrrha

and rush to her—with a cry.

O-UMÈ'S GODS

Time
:
The Sixteenth Century.

Place
:
Japan.

Scene
:
A room in the house of O-Umè in a province near the sea.
Its
shoji,
or sliding paper doors, open in the rear upon a
wistaria arbor over-hanging a river, upon which lighted lanterns,
sent forth on the night of the Feast of the Dead, are dimly
floating; while the moon above gleams upon the pale distant
snow-cone of Fujiyama. The room with its deep straw mats and walls
delicately portrayed with pine and bamboo has a paper-paned door on
the right leading to a garden, and is lighted by
andon—
one
beneath a shrine to Buddha on the left wall, and one to the left
centre where

O-Umè

and

Ama

are sitting on their heels,
constrained, foreboding and verging toward inevitable words.

[54]

Ama
(
at length
). Down to the sea! the sea!

Oh the dead!

Do they not seem

On the night air to hover?

There by the lights

Are not their spirits present?

The lights lit for them?

[
O-Umè

is silent.

All our ancestors are they!

Fathers and mothers

Of many lives back!

They hear us speaking,

They hear from the Buddha-shrine

There on the wall.

They see us thinking.

[
Meaningly.

They see in our hearts!

O-Umè
(
who trembles
). Be silent! silent!

Ama
(
bowing but continuing
). They know if we care for them—
[55]

Know as the wind

That visits all shoji,

Know as the night

That searches all places.

Alas for the son

Who does not honor them!

And for the daughter

Who does not cherish them!

They shall——

O-Umè.
Be silent!

[
A pause.

Ama.
Alas for the daughter!

O-Umè
(
who rises disturbedly
).

The lips of the old

Are like leaves dying—

Leaves of Autumn

That ever flutter!

[
Walks about.

Ama.
And a girl's mind

Is like the dawn mist—
[56]

Knowing not whither

To rest or wander—

Until, perchance,

It clings to Fuji,

To Fuji mountain,

Lord of the air!

The mind of a girl ... straying!

And what is O-Umè's?... whose?

O-Umè.
It is O-Umè's!

Ama.

Ai!

Not Sanko's!...

But were I she,

O-Umè the fair,

O-Umè the mist

Of happy karmas,

Sanko should be

My Fuji mountain.

Him would I cling to,

Nor would I hunger

To stray far from him

With a white priest!
[57]

To stray far from him

To foreign gods

That hang on a cross.

[
Again bowing.

Is he not strong?

O-Umè.

Be silent!

[
To herself, troubled.

The lips of the old!

The lips of the old!

Ama.
Is he not brave?

O-Umè.

I care not.

A samurai is he—

One whose sword is his soul.

Ama.
And should his tongue be

Like that of the other,

The priest of the pain-god?

[
Immovably.

Is he not kind?

O-Umè.

He is kind.

Ama.
Kind! as O-Umè is cruel!
[58]

O-Umè.
No, but as men are,

Wanting women:

Yet not once so was he!

For as children

We caught together

The June-night fire-flies

Out by the shrine of Jiso.

Ama.
And then he loved you,

And ever has loved you,

And faithful is he!

O-Umè.
Ai, and terrible!...

Ama.
Terrible only

Because O-Umè

Turns from her fathers

And from the gods.

She sees their soul-ships

Sail to the sea—

The lights lit for them,

[
Motions without.

And yet she offers

No cakes of welcome—
[59]

None of farewell!

No prayer to Buddha,

Lotus-loving,

And none to Kwannon

Who is all mercy.

But inward, inward

She turns her eyes

To see this stranger,

Priest of the Christ-god.

Outward, outward,

Ever she gazes

And ever listens,

Ever, for him!...

Oh false, false one!

False to the dead—

False to Sanko!...

O-Umè
(
more distressedly
). The words of the old

Are like the leaves,

[
Her voice breaks.

Like Autumn leaves

That ever flutter.
[60]

Ama.
And those of the young——

O-Umè
(
becoming distraught
). Oh will she hush not!...

Will this servant,

Whom my mother

Dying left me,

Waste my heart so?

[
Weeps in her sleeve.

Sanko I fear,

And fears of many

Worlds crowd round me—

Many karmas

Of pain and passion,

Births and rebirths.

Ama.
And 'tis because

This evil priest

Stands in the door of your heart.

O-Umè.
Will you revile him?

Ama.
Cursed be he!

O-Umè.
Ama!

Ama.
I pray it!
[61]

[
Rises slowly.

And curst he shall be.

[
O-Umè stares trembling.

For, O blind one,

By him blinded,

Do you not know

The people have heard

How he has bid you

Cast away from you

The gods of your house?

The blessed Buddha

And all the tablets

Kept, ancestral?

Ai, they have heard

And tonight have risen!

This night of the dead

They have gone forth,

With Sanko to lead them—

Gone to tear down

The house of the priest!

Gone to destroy
[62]

The image he worships!

Gone to——

O-Umè
(
stricken
). Ama!

[
Shrinks from her and then speaks wanly.

Never is there

Trust in any?

Only faith that fades?

This was known—

But kept from me,

Kept in silence,

Kept for Sanko?...

O lord Buddha,

Thou, or Christ,

Is there peril?——

[
Turns on her.

You have done ill!

Ama.
I have done well.

O-Umè.
Ill! and ill shall come to you!

For do you think

So to prevent me

From my fate-way?
[63]

No, I will find it!

The Buddha and all

The tablets ancestral

Will I take down from the wall,

And from me cast them

Into the river ...

They shall float down to the sea.

[
Turns and goes to shrine.

Ama.
O-Umè! O-Umè!

[
Catching at her kimono.

The gods forsaken

Will pardon never!

The gods—and the people!

You will become

Eta, an outcast,

From them driven away.

O-Umè!

[
The girl takes the shrine.

Remember your father

Dead, and your mother.

They are hovering
[64]

Round your fingers,

Faint, offended!

Will you pause not?

[
When O-Umè continues.

Ah for Sanko! for Sanko!

[
Runs calling to door.

Sanko! Sanko!

[
O-Umè stops motionless.

Sanko!...

O-Umè
(
after a pause
). He waits then there?

A Voice
(
without
). Ama! (
nearer
) Ama!...

[
Sanko

enters from the garden, dishevelled and breathless, but
controlled. As he does so

O-Umè

drops the shrine and the image
falls out.

Sanko
. O-Umè! O-Umè!

[
Ama goes quickly out.

O-Umè
(
again motionless
). Honourable friend!

[
With polished anger.

You dwell in my garden?

And is my house
[65]

Even as your house?

Sanko.
Be pleased to pardon!...

O-Umè.
And you conspire here

With Ama against me?

Sanko.
O-Umè knows

The samurai's honour.

O-Umè.
O-Umè thought so,

But does no longer!

Sanko.
Ah the plum-blossom!

Then it too

Has thorns and poison?

O-Umè.
Yes, for the hand of Sanko!

Knowing the deed

From whence he comes.

Knowing that ...

[
Breaks off, tensely.

Where is the priest's house?

Sanko
(
angrily
). Cast in the river!

O-Umè.
Ai, for I see

The blood on your hand

From the torn rafters!
[66]

Red, red blood

Of a deed of fury.

So I tell you,

Samurai rude,

Not for one life,

Even for one,

Will I be yours.

Please ... to leave me.

[
He looks at his hand and is going.

And yet ... (
as he stops
) ... not thus!

[
She struggles.

The priest would bid me

Bind up your wound.

And you were once

Sanko my friend!—

Put forth your hand!

[
He does so.

The blood——

Sanko
(
with sudden fierceness
). The blood is his!

[
As she falls back with a cry.

His! I have slain him!
[67]

[
Mockingly.

And did his ghost

Not come here flitting?

Coldly flitting?

Here with moaning

Does it not hang

Upon the roof-tree

Hungering for you?

He lay in the dark—

One lay with him—

One who escaped to the river.

But him I slew

That you might never

Turn from the Buddha

And from your fathers;

Turn dishonoured

Of all who greet you.

O-Umè
(
speech coming at last
).

Ah! A-hi! Slain!...

It cannot be!

Sanko
(
drawing a bloody sword
).
[68]

And is this wet with dew?

O-Umè.
O let it pierce

Your own heart, samurai!

For you shall never

Again know peace.

I will pray to

The lord of Nippon,

To the Shogun—

Who gave entrance

Here to the Christ-priest.

Nay, I will die

Myself that ever

You may be hated

By your own heart.

[
Starts toward river.

I will cast

Myself to the soul-world

And bid the dead

To bring you evil!

Then the priest shall ...

[69]

[
Breaks off—for standing in the arbour is the priest, pale and
spectral. He has come up to the steps from the river. At the sight

Sanko

plucks her back, as if from a ghost. A pause, then the priest
speaks sacrosanctly.

The Priest.
The Christ looks on you,

[
Lifts a crucifix.

You, a murderer—

Tho it is not

I you have murdered.

[
Sanko

gazes.

One slept with me,

A gentle servant,

Slept in my cloak ... you have slain him.

[
Steps forward.

The Christ looks on you.

He will forgive you.

[
A pause.

Sanko
(
recovering
). Priest!

The Priest.
Forgive you.
[70]

[
Holds crucifix toward him.

Sanko.
By the eight million

Gods, he mocks me!

[
Dashes it to floor.

And shall perish

Or go from this village!

The Priest.
Aye ... but only

When goes this maiden

Whom you would hold

Still to her idols.

She must follow

The Cross of Heaven.

Sanko.
She shall follow

O priest, but me.

The Priest.
Murderer, pause!...

There is a Hell

Where the lost burn

Even as say your sutras.

[
Sanko lifts his sword.

Pause! and strike not!

The smitten Christ
[71]

No longer holds

My hands from strife.

[
Towers over him.

O-Umè, I bid you

Now cast away

The gilded gods you have worshipped.

Sanko.
And I forbid

O-Umè
to move
.

O-Umè
(
heedless of either
). And I, O-Umè,

O'er whom you quarrel,

And whom you tear

Twixt Christ and Buddha,

I, O-Umè, will end it.

[
Lifts the

Buddha

from the floor, and the crucifix, over her
head.

Be all the gods forsaken—

Even as these!

[
Goes to river and casts them in. Then meets their horror with ever
increasing passion.

Be all!

And be you gone
[72]

Forevermore!

For if again

I see your faces,

If again

They grieve my hours,

If again

While Fuji stands there—

The river shall gulf me, too.

I swear it by the dead.

[
They look at her awed, then go slowly, silently out. She sinks on
her heels, hands folded, and stares before her. The lights on the
river drift on.

THE IMMORTAL LURE

Time
:
The antiquity of India.

Scene
:
Before the hermitage of

Vishwamya

and

Rishyas
,
in a
forest near the Ganges. It is an open space spread with kusa-grass
and over-hung with trees—the hermitage itself being a cell
constructed of earth and of hanging roots of the banyan, and having
by it an altar before which lies a deer-skin. Glimmering lights and
running water penetrate the shades, whose sacredness is soon
disturbed by the appearance of

Sunandi
,
wantonly compelling

Koïl
,

with alternate harshness and wheedling, to enter with her.

[76]

Sunandi
(
peering about
). The place, my jewel-bird! the place for it!

Under these boughs of peepul and asoka

The young saint dwells

With his restraining sire,

Singing the Vedas morning, eve and noon,

And they are gone somewhither now in the wood

To gather fruit for sacrifice, and flowers.

[
With a leer.

But he, the boy, will soon return, my pretty.

Koïl
(
whom she has released
). And you have drawn me from the city here

To break into his holy breast with passion?

To dance and sing and seize him?

I you have taught the wiles of winning men,

As the cobra-charmer teaches,

Must lure him from his saintly innocence,

And with the beauty I was born unto

Must tangle him?...

You, O Sunandi, are an evil woman,

To lead me to it!

Sunandi.
And you talk as flies talk!
[77]

Who know not that the gods sow food or famine.

[
Harshly.

I tell you that great Indra of the skies

Is wroth with us

And will not send us rain,

So wisest Brahmins vow—

Until this boy,

This saintly one, is brought unto the Raja!

Are we to die because not otherwise

Than with alluring now we can appease them?

[
Leering again.

And why are women fair, my cunning Koïl,

But to tempt men then, when they seek to take us——

Koïl.
Sunandi!

Sunandi.

It is so, unwitted girl!

Be silent then

And do what I command.

[
Wheedling again.

But it will be sweet doing, beamy Koïl,
[78]

For the young saint

Is fairer than the god-born,

His body like warm gold and lotos-lithe—

Made for the wants that tremble in your heart.

And when your eyes rest on him they will kindle

Like passion-stars.

Koïl.

And burn away his peace—

Which is the pearl

Of sainthood thro all worlds!

Unless his father, strange and terrible,

And mighty thro austerities—one whose

Curse were as heavy as an hundred births—!

O let us trust it not! So young a saint

Should be the holy mate of solitude.

I would not have him gaze upon me so,

For he is innocent of love, nor ever

As yet has looked upon a woman's face.

Sunandi.
Then may he loathe you if he does not! for

Only in woman's faces is there beauty

And who beholds not beauty is as dead.
[79]

[
Starts.

But ha? 'tis he?

No, only parakeets,

Chattering as you chatter, idle girl!

Who ever were resistant to my teachings!

I tell you chirp no more these chastities!

If you come back to the Raja

And without him,

Know you what then will happen?

Koïl.

I know not.

[
Hears a voice.

Nor care not. I will return.

Sunandi.

Stop, girl.

Koïl.

I will not.

All others will I tempt, but——

Sunandi
(
holding her
).
Him will
love
!

[
Rishyas

slowly approaches, chanting.

And you were suckled at the breast of fortune

To be the first so fair a saint shall look on.

Use well your charms—and chain him with enchantment.
[80]

[
Sees the girl is enthralled by the voice and goes into wood.

Rishyas

soon enters opposite, laden and singing
:

Spirit of the risen sun!

Now returns the offering-hour.

Fruit I bring to you and flower,

Here receive them, O great—

[
Breaks off, at sight of her, and the offerings fall slowly from
his arms.

Koïl
(
as they gaze long and tremblingly
).

O saint, is it peace with you, and is all well?

And have you roots and fruit enough for food;

And have you joy in singing holy Vedas

Here in this leafy-hearted hermitage?

Rishyas.
O radiant one, yes—all is godly well.

But whence are you?

And whither do you go?

I have dwelt only here, and not before

Have I beheld so fair a vision fall—

Even from skies where wing the Apsaras.
[81]

Koïl.
I am not fair, O son of Vishwamya,

[
Timidly.

But I have come from very far away.

Rishyas
(
quickly
). And I have offered you no laving-water

For hands and feet,

Nor any fruit and herbs!

Will you not sit upon this mat of kusa,

Or on this skin of the wild antelope,

And let me loose your sandals?—O sweet saint,

For saint so bright an one must be!—it will

Be dear to touch and tend you!

For in this place I have beheld no other—

Only my father,

Who is old and mighty

In meditations he would have me mind.

But you are fair as well. Will you not sit?

Koïl.
No, pious one, it is not meet for me

To touch the holy water—yet I thank you.

Rishyas.
Not meet for you? O, unto one who is

So beautiful, are not all things most meet?
[82]

Better are you, I know, than all the devas.

And tho for but a moment I have seen you,

I fain would follow

The holy vows you follow.

For you I would do all things. When I gaze

Upon you all my body is as fire

Upon the altar when I sacrifice.

Will you not eat or drink?

Koïl.

Not at your hands.

But see, O holy one, here are rare cakes,

Brought with me from afar, and here is soma,

Sparkling and ready with divinity

To lift whoever drinks of it to joy.

Drink you with me!

Rishyas.

O gladly will I; give it.

[
Takes the flask; drinks deeply.

A wine of wonder is it and of wisdom,

For now it makes you seem even more fair

Than first you were.

O let me tend about you,

And let me wreathe your brow and limbs with flowers.
[83]

[
Takes some and entwines them over her.

Koïl
(
trembling
). And you are beautiful. So I will weave

Flowers upon you too. And see, and see,

O, Rishyas, see,

For I will dance to you—

The dance of all the dreamers in the world!

[
Unbinds her body-cloth and begins to dance—slowly at first then
more alluringly, as he follows her, marvelling. Then at length she
stops close up to him and murmurs
:

Does it not fill your heart, O Rishyas,

With longing?

Rishyas.
Yes, yes, yes. And with desire,

I know not why, to lay my lips to yours!

Then life, it seems, would burst all ill that binds it.

[
Instinctively; clasping her.

Oh this is sweeter than all other joys

Of holiness that I have ever known.
[84]

Your voice is like to piping of the koïls

That play in spring.

Koïl.
And Koïl am I named.

Rishyas.
And what is this I feel for you, O wise one?

In skies from whence you come, what is its name?

So pure are you that surely you can tell me?

Koïl.
O holy one, the people call it love.

Rishyas.
Then is love better than all other bliss

My father's meditations ever bring.

And I will seek thro all the lapse of lives

To hold you thus,

And have your arms about me,

As vines about the asoka clingingly.

Happy am I that you have found me out,

And never shall you leave me.

Koïl.

No—for ever!

[
More passionately.

But unto the city you shall go with me

And there with Brahmin rites be made my husband.

Rishyas.
Which is—I know not what—yet will I be
[85]

Husband and more to you. For now it seems

That not the tiger in his jungle-might,

Nor any incarnation terrible,

Could tear you from me.

Koïl.
Then come quickly, now,

And I will be for you a champa-flower,

Swung sweetly and forever to your breast.

And often will I dance for you and sing

And love you, Rishyas, as a deva-queen!

Come quickly, one is waiting in the wood

To guide us.

Rishyas.
Yes, O yes! (
remembering
) But stay! my father!

First I will tell him I have won this wisdom.

Koïl.
No, no!

Rishyas.

Yes! (
calls
) Father! father!

Koïl
(
in terror
).
Rishyas, no!

But come, come with me quickly.

Rishyas
(
astonished
).
Do you fear?

Koïl.
He is so old!... You guess not what you do.
[86]

Haste, or he will forbid.

Rishyas.

You know him not.

For I will tell him you are a holier saint

To guide my steps,

Then will he bid me go.

Ho! father! ho!

Vishwamya
(
heard off
). My son, you call? I come.

Koïl.
O, I must flee—

Rishyas
(
dazed
). I do not understand.

Koïl.
Sunandi! Speak, Sunandi!—Ah, he comes.

[
Vishwamya

enters and seeing her stops amazed
.
Sunandi

enters
behind unseen. Deep suspense.

Rishyas
(
uncomprehendingly
). Do you see, father, I have found one here

Holy, and fairer than the Apsaras.

And I shall follow her, she is some goddess.

For I desire only to be with her,

And she has taught me this desire is love.
[87]

O and I love her,

And tho yet I know

Not well what miracle love is in me,

Yet it is better than this hermitage.

For it has made me seem.... But what burns in you?

Vishwamya.
My son, you are beguiled. Let go her hand

That leads you on to ruin. Do you not

Behold what manner of creature you so clasp?

Rishyas.
Yes, yes—a deva!

Vishwamya.

Deva! This is a woman,

And women like the wind are full of wiles,

And tempt saints to abandon Swerga's rest.

He who would rule his mind has naught with them.

Let go her hand and send her away.

Rishyas
(
amazed
).
Away!

Never shall she go from me and without me.

If women are evil, as you say, she is not,

Therefore she is no woman.

Vishwamya.

O vain boy!
[88]

In passion's jungle! Break from her at once!

Rishyas.
I will not. Her I worship, holily.

And she has given me a drink of heaven

That has diffused deity in my limbs.

Vishwamya.
And death, and an eternity of births!—

These flowers (
on his neck
) and her feigning have bewitched you!

[
Seizes them.

I tear them off and trample them to earth.

Koïl.
Rishyas! Rishyas!

Rishyas.
Be not afraid, my Koïl;

He is my father

And he knows you not,

For did he, he would clasp you, as I clasp.

Or it may be that he is little pleased

Because I find you holier than he.

O father, peace. Control your mind. Farewell.

I go with her.

Vishwamya.
Beguilèd boy! you shall not.

Thro all these years I have not, from its lair,
[89]

Unloosed black anger.

But this evil one

And your desire to follow ways of flesh

Compel me. Come, come from her!

Rishyas.

I will never.

Vishwamya.
Then must I drag you—and drive her away.

[
Strikes

Koïl
.

Away, lust-thing! away!

Rishyas.
Oh, oh! Oh, oh!

[
In horror.

A demon enters into you and dupes you

To strike her thus, a holy one. Restrain!

Vishwamya.
No, tho I slay her!

Rishyas.

Slay? O wickedness!

[
Seizes up wood of sacrifice.

Must I beat off your hands?—Touch her no more.

Vishwamya.
Wild-vaunting boy! the drink and this vile girl

Have maddened you. (
To Koïl
) Away!

Rishyas.
Call her not vile!
[90]

Vishwamya.
Viler is she than sin!

[
Again strikes her.

Rishyas
(
uncontrollably
). You do a death-deed.

[
Falls on him with the weapon and fells him quickly to the
ground—then recoils with a cry. The old man strives vainly to
rise.

Koïl.
Oh, oh!—what have you done!

Vishwamya
(
mortally hurt
). Slain ... slain his father!

And lost enlightenment ... and peace ... forever!

[
After a struggle, terribly.

But not to gorge upon the fruit of sin!

[
Turning on

Koïl
.

The curse of bitter karmas be upon you!

May you be born a worm and crawl in slime,

A serpent thro ten score of lives, and slough

Your skin in hideousness and hate and horror!

Koïl.
Oh, oh!

Vishwamya.
At every death may you despair

Of ever acquiring merit!
[91]

Rishyas
(
terrified
). Father!

Vishwamya
(
to him
).
Aye!

[
His strength failing.

For love, blood guilty boy, the love which she

Has slipped into your heart, is the curse of the world,

The immortal lure of all the generations!

Your arms have ached with it about her body,

But know that in the city whence she came

All evil men feel in their hearts this ache.

And that you may escape from it, know this:

Not your arms, yours alone, have been entwined

About this poison-flower—but, perchance,

[
Sinking back.

The arms of many.

Rishyas
(
starting painedly
). What is it he means?

[
With emotions he does not understand.

Koïl, what has he said?

Koïl.
O let me go!

Rishyas.
The arms of many? that can not be true?
[92]

[
Tortured by half-born thoughts.

O, have I fallen into demon-snares?

Is beauty not the bloom of piety?

Speak.

Koïl.
I would go!

Rishyas.

Pain only darker pain!

Koïl
(
at length overwhelmed
). I am not holy—nor am I pollution!

But only one sent hither—O, the gods

Bid us to sin, then fell us with calamity!

[
Hurries weeping off with

Sunandi
,
who has stood in terror
.

Rishyas

stands dazed, then comprehension dawns upon him and he
falls by his father's body in a storm of anguish.

THE END

MANY GODS

By

CALE YOUNG RICE

"These poems are flashingly, glowingly full of the East.... What I am
sure of in Mr. Rice is that here we have an American poet whom we may
claim as ours."
The North American Review
(
William Dean Howells
).

"Mr. Rice has the gift of leadership, and he is a force with whom we
must reckon."
The Boston Transcript.

... "We find here a poet who strives to reach the goal which marks the
best that can be done in poetry."
The Book News Monthly
(
A. S.
Henry
).

"When you hear the pessimists bewailing the good old time when real
poets were abroad in the land ... do not fail to quote them almost
anything by Cale Young Rice, a real poet writing to-day.... He has done
so much splendid work one can scarcely praise him too highly."
The San
Francisco Call.

"In 'Many Gods' the scenes are those of the East, and while it is not
the East of Loti, Arnold or Hearn, it is still a place of brooding,
majesty, mystery and subtle fascination. There is a temptation to quote
such verses for their melody, dignity of form, beauty of imagery and
height of inspiration."
The Chicago Journal.

"'Love's Cynic' (a long poem in the volume) might be by Browning at his
best."
Pittsburg Gazette-Times.

"This is a serious, and from any standpoint, a successful piece of work
... in it are poems that will become classic."
Passaic
(
New Jersey
)

News.

"Mr. Rice must be hailed as one among living masters of his art, one to
whom we may look for yet greater things."
Presbyterian Advance.

"This book is in many respects a remarkable work. The poems are indeed
poems."
The Nashville Banner.

"Mr. Rice's poetical plays reach a high level of achievement.... But
these poems show a higher vision and surer mastery of expression than
ever before."
The London Bookman.

A NIGHT IN AVIGNON

By

CALE YOUNG RICE

Successfully produced by Donald Robertson

"It is as vivid as a page from Browning. Mr. Rice has the dramatic
pulse."
James Huneker.

"It embraces in small compass all the essentials of the drama."
New
York Saturday Times Review
(
Jessie B. Rittenhouse
).

"It presents one of the most striking situations in dramatic literature
and its climax could not be improved."
The San Francisco Call.

"It has undeniable power, and is a very decided poetic achievement."

The Boston Transcript.

"It leaves an enduring impression of a soul tragedy."
The Churchman.

"Since the publication of his 'Charles di Tocca' and other dramas, Cale
Young Rice has justly been regarded as a leading American master of that
difficult form, and many critics have ranked him above Stephen Phillips,
at least on the dramatic side of his art. And this judgment is further
confirmed by 'A Night in Avignon.' It is almost incredible that in less
than 500 lines Mr. Rice should have been able to create so perfect a
play with so powerful a dramatic effect."
The Chicago Record-Herald

(
Edwin S. Shuman
).

"There is poetic richness in this brilliant composition; a beauty of
sentiment and grace in every line. It is impressive, metrically pleasing
and dramatically powerful."
The Philadelphia Record.

"It offers one of the most striking situations in dramatic literature."

The Louisville Courier-Journal.

"The publication of a poetic drama of the quality of Mr. Rice's is an
important event in the present tendency of American literature. He is a
leader in this most significant movement, and 'A Night in Avignon' is
marked, like his other plays, by dramatic directness, high poetic
fervor, clarity of poetic diction, and felicity of phrasing."
The
Chicago Journal.

"It is a dramatically told episode, and the metre is most effectively
handled, making a welcome change for blank verse, and greatly enhancing
the interest."
Sydney Lee.

"Many critics, on hearing Mr. Bryce's prediction that America will one
day have a poet, would be tempted to remind him of Mr. Rice."
The
Hartford
(
Conn.
)
Courant.

YOLANDA OF CYPRUS

A Poetic Drama by

CALE YOUNG RICE

Minnie Maddern Fisk says: "No one can doubt that it is superior
poetically and dramatically to Stephen Phillips' work," and that Mr.
Rice ranks with Mr. Phillips at his best has often been reaffirmed.

"It is encouraging to the hope of a native drama to know that an
American has written a play which is at the same time of decided poetic
merit and of decided dramatic power."
The New York Times
(
Charles M.
Hathaway, Jr.
).

"The most remarkable quality of the play is its sustained dramatic
strength. Poetically it is frequently of great beauty. It is also lofty
in conception, lucid and felicitous in style, and the dramatic pulse
throbs in every line."
The Chicago Record-Herald.

The Springfield Republican
says: "The characters are drawn with force
and the play is dignified and powerful," and adds that if it does not
succeed on the stage it will be "because of its excellence."

"Mr. Rice is one of the few present-day poets who have the steadiness
and weight for a well-sustained drama."
The Louisville Post

(
Margaret Anderson
).

"It has equal command of imagination, dramatic utterance, picturesque
effectiveness and metrical harmony."
The London
(
England
)
Bookman.

T. P.'s Weekly
says: "It might well stand the difficult test of
production and will be welcomed by all who care for serious verse."

The Glasgow
(
Scotland
)
Herald
says: "Yolanda of Cyprus is finely
constructed; the irregular blank verse admirably adapted for the
exigencies of intense emotion; the characters firmly drawn; and the
climax serves the purpose of good stagecraft and poetic justice."

"It is well constructed and instinct with dramatic power."
Sydney Lee.

"It is as readable as a novel."
The Pittsburg Post.

"Here and there an almost Shakespearean note is struck. In makeup,
arrangement, and poetic intensity it ranks with Stephen Phillips' work."

The Book News Monthly.

CHARLES DI TOCCA

By

CALE YOUNG RICE

"I take off my hat to Mr. Rice. His play is full of poetry, and the
pitch and dignity of the whole are remarkable."
James Lane Allen.

"It is a dramatic poem one reads with a heightened sense of its fine
quality throughout. It is sincere, strong, finished and noble, and
sustains its distinction of manner to the end.... The character of
Helena is not unworthy of any of the great masters of dramatic
utterance."
The Chicago Tribune.

"The drama is one of the best of the kind ever written by an American
author. Its whole tone is masterful, and it must be classed as one of
the really literary works of the season." (1903).
The Milwaukee
Sentinel.

"It shows a remarkable sense of dramatic construction as well as poetic
power and strong characterization."
James MacArthur, in Harper's
Weekly.

"This play has many elements of perfection. Its plot is developed with
ease and with a large dramatic force; its characters are drawn with
sympathy and decision; and its thoughts rise to a very real beauty. By
reason of it the writer has gained an assured place among playwrights
who seek to give literary as well as dramatic worth to their plays."

The Richmond
(
Va.
)
News-Leader.

"The action of the play is admirably compact and coherent, and it
contains tragic situations which will afford pleasure not only to the
student, but to the technical reader."
The Nation.

"It is the most powerful, vital, and truly tragical drama written by an
American for some years. There is genuine pathos, mighty yet never
repellent passion, great sincerity and penetration, and great elevation
and beauty of language."
The Chicago Post.

"Mr. Rice ranks among America's choicest poets on account of his power
to turn music into words, his virility, and of the fact that he has
something of his own to say."
The Boston Globe.

"The whole play breathes forth the indefinable spirit of the Italian
renaissance. In poetic style and dramatic treatment it is a work of
art."
The Baltimore Sun.

NIRVANA DAYS

Poems by

CALE YOUNG RICE

"Mr. Rice has the technical cunning that makes up almost the entire
equipment of many poets nowadays, but human nature is more to him always
... and he has the feeling and imaginative sympathy without which all
poetry is but an empty and vain thing."
The London Bookman.

"Mr. Rice's note is a clarion call, and of his two poems, 'The Strong
Man to His Sires' and 'The Young to the Old,' the former will send a
thrill to the heart of every man who has the instinct of race in his
blood, while the latter should be printed above the desk of every minor
poet and pessimist.... The sonnets of the sequence, 'Quest and
Requital,' have the elements of great poetry in them."
The Glasgow

(
Scotland
)
Herald.

"Mr. Rice's poems are singularly free from affectation, and he seems to
have written because of the sincere need of expressing something that
had to take art form."
The Sun
(
New York
).

"The ability to write verse that scans is quite common.... But the
inspired thought behind the lines is a different thing; and it is this
thought untrammeled—the clear vision searching into the deeps of human
emotion—which gives the verse of Mr. Rice weight and potency.... In the
range of his metrical skill he easily stands with the best of living
craftsmen ... and we have in him ... a poet whose dramas and lyrics will
endure."
The Book News Monthly
(
A. S. Henry
).

"These poems are marked by a breadth of outlook, individuality and
beauty of thought. The author reveals deep, sincere feeling on topics
which do not readily lend themselves to artistic expression and which he
makes eminently worth while."
The Buffalo
(
N. Y.
)
Courier.

"We get throughout the idea of a vast universe and of the soul merging
itself in the infinite.... The great poem of the volume, however, is
'The Strong Man to His Sires.'"
The Louisville Post
(
Margaret S.
Anderson
).

"The poems possess much music ... and even in the height of intensified
feeling the clearness of Mr. Rice's ideas is not dimmed by the obscure
haze that too often goes with the divine fire."
The Boston Globe.

DAVID

A Poetic Drama by

CALE YOUNG RICE

"I was greatly impressed with it and derived a sense of personal
encouragement from the evidence of so fine and lofty a product for the
stage."
Richard Mansfield.

"It is a powerful piece of dramatic portraiture in which Cale Young Rice
has again demonstrated his insight and power. What he did before in
'Charles di Tocca' he has repeated and improved upon.... Not a few
instances of his strength might be cited as of almost Shakespearean
force. Indeed the strictly literary merit of the tragedy is altogether
extraordinary. It is a contribution to the drama full of charm and
power."
The Chicago Tribune.

"From the standpoint of poetry, dignity of conception, spiritual
elevation and finish and beauty of line, Mr. Rice's 'David' is, perhaps,
superior to his 'Yolanda of Cyprus,' but the two can scarcely be
compared."
The New York Times
(
Jessie B. Rittenhouse
).

"Never before has the theme received treatment in a manner so worthy of
it." The
St. Louis Globe-Democrat.

"It needs but a word, for it has been passed upon and approved by
critics all over the country."
Book News Monthly.
And again: "But few
recent writers seem to have found the secret of dramatic blank verse;
and of that small number, Mr. Rice is, if not first, at least without
superior."

"With instinctive dramatic and poetic power, Mr. Rice combines a
knowledge of the exigencies of the stage."
Harper's Weekly.

"It is safe to say that were Mr. Rice an Englishman or a Frenchman, his
reputation as his country's most distinguished poetic dramatist would
have been assured by a more universal sign of recognition."

Baltimore News

writing of all Mr. Rice's plays

SONG-SURF

(Being the Lyrics of Plays and Lyrics) by

CALE YOUNG RICE

"Mr. Rice's work betrays wide sympathies with nature and life, and a
welcome originality of sentiment and metrical harmony."
Sydney Lee.

"In his lyrics Mr. Rice's imagination works most successfully. He is an
optimist—and in these days an optimist is irresistible—and he can
touch delicately things too holy for a rough or violent pathos."
The
London Star
(
James Douglas
).

"Mr. Rice's highest gift is essentially lyrical. His lyrics have a charm
and grace of melody distinctively their own."
The London Bookman.

"Mr. Rice is keenly responsive to the loveliness of the outside world,
and he reveals this beauty in words that sing themselves."
The Boston
Transcript.

"Mr. Rice's work is everywhere marked by true imaginative power and
elevation of feeling."
The Scotsman.

"Mr. Rice's work would seem to rank with the best of our American poets
of to-day."
The Atlanta Constitution.

"Mr. Rice's poems are touched with the magic of the muse. They have
inspiration, grace and true lyric quality."
The Book News Monthly.

"Mr. Rice's poetry as a whole is both strongly and delicately spiritual.
Many of these lyrics have the true romantic mystery and charm.... To
write thus is no indifferent matter. It indicates not only long work but
long brooding on the beauty and mystery of life."
The Louisville Post.

"Mr. Rice is indisputably one of the greatest poets who have lived in
America.... And some of these (earlier) poems are truly beautiful."

Times-Union

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

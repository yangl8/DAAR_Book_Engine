REMARKS.

Plays of former times were written to be read, not seen. Dramatic
authors succeeded in their aim; their works were placed in libraries,
and the theatres were deserted.—Now, plays are written to be seen, not
read—and present authors gain their views; for they and the managers
are enriched, and the theatres crowded.

To be both seen and read at the present day, is a degree of honour,
which, perhaps, not one comic dramatist can wholly boast, except
Shakspeare. Exclusive of his, scarcely any of the very best comedies of
the best of former bards will now attract an audience: yet the genius of
ancient writers was assisted by various tales, for plots, of which they
have deprived the moderns; they had, besides, the privilege to write
without either political or moral restraint. Uncurbed by law or
delicacy, they wrote at random; and at random wrote some pages worthy
posterity—but along with these, they produced others, which disgrace
the age that reprints and circulates them.

[Pg 4]
It might be deemed suspicious to insinuate, that those persons, perhaps,
who so vehemently exclaim against modern dramas, give up with reluctance
the old prerogative of listening to wit and repartee, which would make
the refined hearer of the present day blush, and the moral auditor
shudder.

To those who can wisely bear with the faults of their own time, nor
think all that is good is gone by, the representation of the present
comedy will give high entertainment; particularly in those scenes in
which Vapid is concerned.—Reynolds could hardly mistake drawing a
faithful portrait of this character, for it is said—he sat for himself.

Yet those, who expect to be highly delighted with "The Dramatist," must
bring with them to the theatre a proper acquaintance with the stage, and
also of its power over certain of its votaries.

If attraction, if bursts of applause, and still less equivocal
approbation, bursts of laughter, constitute perfect success to a comic
writer, Mr Reynolds, in this, as well as in other of his comedies, has
been preeminently successful.

In this comedy, however, and, perhaps, in one or two more he has
written, there is an obstacle to his independent merit as an author—an
obstacle which too many dramatic writers willingly place in their path
to lasting reputation. He has written for one particular actor to
support his play—Lewis—more worthy to be thus considered than almost
any other performer: but here his very skill gives the alarm—for Lewis
possesses such unaffected spirit on the
[Pg 5]
stage, a kind of vivid fire,
which tempers burlesque with nature, or nature with burlesque, so
happily, that it cannot be hoped any other man will easily support those
characters written purposely for him.

Be that as it may—when Reynolds can no more enliven a theatre by his
Dramatist, this comedy will grow dull in excellent company—for
Congreve's "Way of the World" was hissed, it is said, from a London
stage, the last time it was acted, for insipidity.

THE

DRAMATIST.

ACT THE FIRST.

SCENE I.

The Grove.—
Lady Waitfor't's
House.

Enter
Marianne
, and
Letty
, from the House.

Mari.
But I tell you I will come out—I didn't come to Bath to be
confined, nor I won't—I hate all their company, but sweet Miss
Courtney's.

Letty.
I declare, Miss Marianne, you grow worse and worse every day,
your country manners will be the ruin of you.

Mari.
Don't you talk about that, Letty—It was a shame to bring me up
in the country—if I had been properly taken care of, I might have done
great things—I might have married the poet I danced with at the
ball—But it's all over now.—I shall never get a husband, and, what's
worse, my aunt did it on purpose.—She ruined me, Letty, that nobody
else might.

[Pg 8]
Letty.
How you talk!—I hope Miss Courtney hasn't taught you all this?

Mari.
No,—she's a dear creature,—she has taught me many things; but
nothing improper, I'm sure.

Letty.
Pray, has she taught you why she never plays any tune but the
one we heard just now?

Mari.
Yes—and if you'll keep it a secret, I'll tell you, Letty; Mr
Harry Neville taught it her last summer,—and now she is always playing
it, because it puts her in mind of the dear man;—when it is ended,
don't you observe how she sighs from the bottom of her dear little
heart?

Letty.
Why, I thought they had quarrelled?

Mari.
So they have—she won't see him, and I believe my aunt, Lady
Waitfor't, has been the occasion of it;—poor Mr Neville!—I wish I
could assist him, for indeed, Letty, I always pity any body that is
crossed in love—it may be one's own case one day or other, you know.

Letty.
True—and for the same reason, I suppose, you rejoice when it
is successful.—I'm sure now the intended marriage of Lady Waitfor't and
Lord Scratch gives you great pleasure.

Mari.
What! the country gentleman who has lately come to his title?
No, if you'll believe me, I don't like him at all,—he's a sour old
fellow—is always abusing our sex, and thinks there is only one good
woman under heaven:—now, I'm sure that's a mistake, for I know I'm a
good woman, and I think, Letty, you are another.

Letty.
Yes,—I hope so, though I confess I think your aunt is better
than either of us.

Mari.
More shame for you—she is a woman of sentiment, and hums you
over with her flourishes about purity, and feelings.—Feelings!—'faith,
she ought to be ashamed of herself—no other woman would talk in that
manner.

Letty.
You mistake her—she is a woman of virtue,
[Pg 9]
and can't help
feeling for the vices and misfortunes of others.

Mari.
Then why can't she do as I have done, Letty? keep her feelings
to herself—If I had given way to them half so much as she has—Oh Lord!
I don't know what might have been the consequence.

Letty.
For shame! You never hear Lady Waitfor't speak ill of any body.

Mari.
No,—How should she, when she talks of nobody but herself?

Letty.
Well, your opinion is of little weight; my Lord sees her merit,
and is come to Bath on purpose to marry her—he thinks her a prodigy of
goodness.

Mari.
Then, pray let him have her—every fool knows so, to be sure he
does, Letty, that a prodigy of goodness is a very rare thing;—but when
he finds her out!—'faith, it will be a rare joke, when he finds her
out.

Letty.
Shameful, Miss Marianne! do speak a little intelligibly, and
remember your aunt's favourite observation.

Mari.
What is it?—I have forgot.

Letty.
That good sentiments are always plain.

Mari.
Yes,—so are good women,—bid her remember that, Letty.

Letty.
Hush:—say no more—here she comes, and Mr Willoughby with her.

Mari.
Ay—that man is always with her of late—but come, Letty, let's
get out of their way—let's take a walk, and look at the beaux.

Letty.
The beaux! ah, I see you long to become a woman of fashion.

Mari.
No—though I hate the country, I never will become a woman of
fashion—I know too well what it is to do many things one don't like,
and 'faith, while there is such real pleasure in following my own
incli
[Pg 10]
nations, I see no reason why, merely out of fashion, I should be
obliged to copy other people's.

[
Exit, with
Letty
.

Enter
Lady Waitfor't
and
Willoughby
.

Lady.
[
To
Servant
.
] When my lord returns, tell him I'm gone to Lady
Walton's, and shall be back immediately.

Will.
Then your ladyship is certain Harry Neville is arrived.

Lady.
Yes—the ungrateful man arrived last night, and, as I yet mean
to consult his happiness, I have written to him to come to me this
evening—but I will ever oppose his union with my lord's ward, Louisa
Courtney, because I think it will be the ruin of them both; and you
know, Willoughby, one cannot forget one's feelings on those occasions.

Will.
Certainly—Ennui, the time-killer, whose only business in life
is to murder the hour, is also just arrived; and my lord is resolved on
his marrying Louisa instantly.

Lady.
True—and only because he'll make a quiet member for his brother
in the west. But, for various reasons, I am determined she shall be
yours—yet it must be done artfully—my circumstances are deranged, and
an alliance with my lord Scratch is the only hope of relief.—Such are
the fruits of virtue, Willoughby.

Will.
Well—but her fortune is entirely dependent on my Lord's
consent, and how is that to be obtained? You know I am no favourite, and
Ennui is a great one.

Lady.
I know it, and therefore we must incense him against Ennui—let
me see——can't we contrive some mode,—some little ingenious story—he
is a singular character, you know, and has violent prejudices.

[Pg 11]
Will.
True—and of all his prejudices, none is so violent, or
entertaining, as that against authors and actors.

Lady.
Yes,—the stage is his aversion, and some way or other——I have
it—it's an odd thought, but may do much—suppose we tell him Ennui has
written a play.

Will.
The luckiest thought in the world! it will make him hate him
directly.

Lady.
Well, leave it to me—I'll explain the matter to him
myself,—and my life on't it proves successful. You see, Willoughby, my
only system is to promote happiness.

Will.
It is indeed, Lady Waitfor't—but if this fails, may I still
hope for your interest with Miss Courtney?

Lady.
Yes,—I'm determined she shall be yours, and neither Neville's
nor Ennui's.—But come, it's late—here he is.

Will.
We'll get rid of him.

Enter
Ennui
.

Lady.
Mr Ennui, your most obedient—we are going to the Parade—have
you seen your cousin Neville?

Ennui.
I've an idea—I've just left him.

Lady.
I suppose we shall see you at Lady Walton's this evening?—till
then, adieu.

[
Exeunt
Lady Waitfor't
and
Willoughby
.

Ennui.
I've an idea, I don't like this Lady Waitfor't—she wishes to
trick me out of my match with Miss Courtney, and if I could trick her in
return—[
Takes out his Watch.
] How goes the enemy?—only one
o'clock!—I thought it had been that an hour ago!—heigho!—here's my
patron, Lord Scratch.

Enter
Lord Scratch
.

Lord.
What a wonderful virtue is the art of hear
[Pg 12]
ing!—may I die, if a
listener be found any where:—Zounds! am not I a peer, and don't I talk
by prerogative?—and, if I mayn't talk ten times as much as another
person, what's the use of my peerage?

Ennui.
I've an idea—I don't comprehend you.

Lord.
That fellow Neville wouldn't hear a word I had to
say:—abandoned young dog!—he's come to Bath to invent tales against
that divinity, Lady Waitfor't, again, I suppose—but my ward, Louisa,
shall be put out of his power for ever—she shall marry you to-morrow.

Ennui.
In fact—I always forgot to give your lordship joy of your
title, though not of your dress.

Lord.
Not of my dress!—ay, ay;—that's the difference—you poor
devils, in humble life, are obliged to dress well, to look like
gentlemen—we peers may dress as we please—[
Looking at his watch.
]
but I shall lose my appointments—past two o'clock.

Ennui.
Past two o'clock!—delightful!

Lord.
Delightful!—what, at your old tricks?

Ennui.
I'd an idea—it had been only one.

Lord.
And you're delighted because it's an hour later?

Ennui.
To be sure I am—my dear friend, to be sure I am—the enemy has
lost a limb.

Lord.
So you're happy, because you're an hour nearer the other
world?—tell me now,—do you wish to die?

Ennui.
No.—But I wish somebody would invent a new mode of killing
time—in fact, I think I've found one—private acting.

Lord.
Acting!—never talk to me about the stage—I detest a theatre,
and every thing that belongs to it: and if ever—but no matter—I must
to Lady Waitfor't, and prevail on her to marry me at the same time you
marry my ward.—But, remember our agreement—you are to settle your
estate on Louisa, and I am to bring you into parliament.

[Pg 13]
Ennui.
In fact, I comprehend—I am to be a hearer and not a speaker.

Lord.
Speaker!—if you open your mouth, the Chiltern Hundreds is your
portion.—Look ye—you are to be led quietly to the right side—to sleep
during the debate—give a nod for your vote,—and in every respect, move
like a mandarin, at my command;—in short, you are to be a mandarin
member.—So, fare you well till we're both married.

[
Exit.

Ennui.
I've an idea, here's Neville.—In fact—he knows nothing of my
marrying Louisa, nor shall he, till after the happy day.—Strange news,
Neville.

Enter
Neville
.

Nev.
I've heard it all. Louisa is going to be married; but to whom I
know not,—and my Lord persists in his fatal attachment to Lady
Waitfor't.

Ennui.
In fact—Why fatal?

Nev.
Because it is the source of every mischief.—While she maintains
her power over him, I have no hope of love or fortune:—When my father
died, he left his estate to my brother, relying on my lord providing for
me—and now, how he deserts me!—and all owing to the artifices of an
insidious woman.

Ennui.
I've an idea, I comprehend her motive—she loves you.

Nev.
Yes, 'tis too plain—and, because I would not listen to her
advances, she has ruined me in my uncle's opinion, and degraded me in
Louisa's;—but I will see Miss Courtney herself—I will hear my doom
from her own mouth; and if she avoids me, I will leave her, and this
country, for ever.

Enter
Peter
.

Peter.
A letter, sir.

Nev.
Without direction!—What can it mean?

Peter.
Sir, 'tis from Lady Waitfor't.—The servant, who brought it,
said, her ladyship had reasons for not
[Pg 14]
directing it, which she would
explain to you when she saw you.

[
Exit.

Nev.
Oh, the old stratagem:—as it is not directed, she may swear it
was designed for another person.

[
Reads.

Sir
,

I have heard of your arrival at Bath, and, strange as
my conduct may appear, I think it a duty I owe to the
virtuous part of mankind, to promote their happiness as
much as I can; I have long beheld your merit, and long
wished to encourage it.—I shall be at home at six this

evening. Yours,

A. Waitfor't.

Ennui.
In fact—a very sentimental assignation, that would do as well
for any other man.

Nev.
If I show it to my lord, I know his bigotry is such, that he
would, as usual, only suppose it a trick of my own—the more cause there
is to condemn, the more he approves.

Ennui.
I've an idea, he's incomprehensible.—In fact—who have we
here?

Nev.
As I live, Vapid, the dramatic author—he is come to Bath to pick
up characters, I suppose.

Ennui.
In fact—pick up!

Nev.
Yes—he has the ardor scribendi upon him so strong, that he would
rather you'd ask him to write an epilogue to a new play, than offer him
your whole estate—the theatre is his world, in which are included all
his hopes and wishes.—In short, he is a dramatic maniac. And to such an
extent does he carry his folly, that if he were not the best natured
fellow in the world, every body would kick him out of doors.

Ennui.
Has he not a share of vanity in his composition?

Nev.
Oh yes—he fancies himself a great favourite with the women.

Ennui.
Then I've an idea—I've got a thought, by which you may revenge
yourself on Lady Waitfor't
[Pg 15]
—in fact—give him the letter—he'll
certainly believe 'tis meant for himself.

Nev.
My dear friend, ten thousand thanks!—We'll flatter his vanity,
by persuading him she is young and beautiful, and my life on't it does
wonders;—but, hush, he comes.

Enter
Vapid
.

Nev.
Vapid! I rejoice to see you,—'tis a long time since we met; give
me leave to introduce you to a particular friend of mine—Mr Ennui—Mr
Vapid.

Ennui.
I've an idea—you do me honour—Mr Vapid, I shall be proud to
be better acquainted with you—in fact—any thing of consequence
stirring in the fashionable or political world?

Vapid.
Some whispers about a new pantomime, sir,—nothing else.

Nev.
And I'm afraid, in the present scarcity of good writers, we have
little else to expect.—Pray, Vapid, how is the present dearth of genius
to be accounted for; particularly dramatic genius?

Vapid.
Why, as to dramatic genius, sir, the fact is this—to give a
true picture of life, a man should enter into all its scenes,—should
follow nature, sir—but modern authors plunder from one another—the
mere shades of shadows.—Now, sir, for my part, I dive into the world—I
search the heart of man;—'tis true I'm called a rake—but, upon my
soul, I only game, drink, and intrigue, that I may be better able to
dramatize each particular scene.

Nev.
A good excuse for profligacy.—But tell me, Vapid, have you got
any new characters since you came to Bath?

Vapid.
'Faith, only two—and those not very new either.

Ennui.
In fact—may we ask what they are?

Vapid.
If you don't write.

Nev.
No, we certainly do not.

[Pg 16]
Vapid.
Then I'll tell you:—The first is a charitable divine, who, in
the weighty consideration how he shall best lavish his generosity, never
bestows it at all:—and the other is a cautious apothecary, who, in
determining which of two medicines is best for his patient, lets him die
for want of assistance.—You understand me, I think, this last will do
something, eh?

Ennui.
I've an idea—the apothecary would cut a good figure in a
comedy.

Vapid.
A comedy! pshaw! I mean him for a tragedy.

Ennui.
In fact—I don't comprehend, nor, possibly, the town.

Vapid.
I know it—that's the very thing—hark ye, I've found out a
secret—what every body understands, nobody approves; and people always
applaud most where they least comprehend.—There is a refinement, sir,
in appearing to understand things incomprehensible—else whence arises
the pleasure at an opera, a private play, or a speech in parliament?
why, 'tis the mystery in all these things—'tis the desire to find out
what nobody else can—to be thought wiser than others—therefore—you
take me—the apothecary is the hero of my tragedy.

Nev.
'Faith, there is some reason in all this—and I'm amazed we have
so many writers for the stage.

Vapid.
So am I—and I think I'll write no more for an ungrateful
public—you don't know any body that has a play coming out, do you?

Nev.
No—why do you ask?

Vapid.
He'll want an epilogue you know, that's all.

Nev.
Why, you won't write him one, will you?

Vapid.
I! oh Lord! no;—but genius ought to be encouraged, and as he's
a friend of yours,—what's the name of the play?

[Pg 17]
Nev.
I really don't know any body that has written one.

Vapid.
Yes——yes——you do.

Nev.
Upon my word, I do not—a cousin of mine, indeed, wrote one for
his amusement, but I don't think he could ever be prevailed on to
produce it on the stage.

Vapid.
He prevailed on!—the manager you mean—but what did you think
of it?

Nev.
I never read it, but am told it is a good play—and if performed,
Vapid, he will be proud of your assistance.

Vapid.
I speak in time, because it is material—many a dull play has
been saved by a good epilogue.

Nev.
True—but I had almost forgot.—Why, Vapid, the lady in the Grove
will enlarge your knowledge amazingly.

Ennui.
I've an idea—she's the pattern of perfection.

Nev.
The paragon of beauty! Ah, Vapid! I would give worlds for the
coldest expression in this letter.

Vapid.
That letter!—what do you mean by that letter?

Nev.
And you really pretend not to know the young Lady Waitfor't?

Vapid.
No,—I hav'n't spoke to a woman at Bath,—but a sweet girl I
danced with at the ball; and who she is, by the Lord, I don't know.

Nev.
Well, but, Vapid—young Lady Waitfor't—she loves you to
distraction.

Vapid.
As I hope for fame, I never heard her name before.

Nev.
Then she has heard yours, and admires your genius; however, read
the letter, and be satisfied she loves you.

[
Vapid
reads.

Arrived at Bath—duty I owe—virtuous part of
mankind—beheld your merit—wish to encourage—six this
evening.—A. Waitfor't—Grove.

[Pg 18]
Vapid.
Yes, yes, it's plain enough now—she admires my talents!—It
isn't the first time, Neville, this has happened.—Sweet fond
fool!—I'll go and prepare myself directly.

Nev.
Ay do, Vapid,—she'll be all on fire to see you.

Vapid.
All on fire! I suppose so.—Write a play, Neville, write a
play—you see the effect of the muses and graces when they unite—you
see, Neville, you see——but, hold, hold—how the devil came you by this
letter?

Nev.
That's true enough. [
Aside.
] I'll tell you—I was at her party
last night, and on coming out of the room she slipt it into my hand, and
desired me to direct it, and give it to you—She has often spoke to me
in your favour, and I did you all the good I could—however, to be sure
it's no mistake, ask the servant, who admits you, if the name at the
bottom is not her own hand-writing.

Vapid.
Oh, no!—it's no mistake,—there's no doubt of the
matter.—Write a play, Neville, write a play—and charm the ladies, you
dog!—adieu!

[
Exit.

Ennui.
I've an idea—if we've common fortune, this will do every
thing.

Nev.
No,—Lady Waitfor't's arts are numberless—she is so perfect a
hypocrite, that I even doubt her confessing her real sentiments to her
minion Willoughby; and when she does a bad action, she ever pretends
'tis from a good motive.

Enter
Vapid
.

Vapid.
Gad, I forgot—you'll recollect the epilogue, Neville.

Nev.
Yes,—I'll write to my cousin to-day.

Vapid.
But, not a word of the love affair to him—any where else
indeed it might do one a service—but never tell an intrigue to a
dramatic author.

[Pg 19]
Ennui.
In fact—why not sir?

Vapid.
Because it may furnish a scene for a comedy—I do it
myself.—Indeed, I think the best part of an intrigue is the hopes of
incident, or stage effect—however, I can't stay.

Nev.
Nay, we'll walk with you—I, in pursuit of my brother—you, of
your mistress.

Vapid.
Ay, Neville, there it is—now, do take my advice, and write a
play—if any incident happens, remember, it is better to have written a
damned play, than no play at all—it snatches a man from obscurity—and
being particular, as this world goes, is a very great thing.

Nev.
But I confess I have no desire to get into print.

Vapid.
Get into print!—pshaw! every body gets into print now.—Kings
and quacks—peers and poets—bishops and boxers—tailors and trading
justices—can't go lower, you know—all get into print!—But we soar a
little higher,—we have privileges peculiar to ourselves.—Now, sir,
I—I, for my part, can talk as I please,—say what I will, it is sure to
excite mirth,—for, supposing you don't laugh at my wit, I laugh myself,
Neville, and that makes every body else do the same—so allons!

Ennui.
I've an idea—no bad mode of routing the enemy.

Exeunt.

House.—Two Chairs.

Vapid

Servant

Serv.
Sir, my lady will wait on you immediately.

Vapid.
Hark ye, sir—Is this young lady of yours very handsome?

Serv.
Sir?

Vapid.
Is your young mistress, sir, very handsome?

Serv.
Yes, sir.—My young mistress is thought a perfect beauty.

Vapid.
Charming!—What age do you reckon her?

Serv.
About twenty, sir.

Vapid.
The right interesting age! and fond of the drama, I suppose?

Serv.
Sir?

Vapid.
Very fond of plays, I presume?

Serv.
Yes, sir, very fond of plays, or any thing relating to them.

Vapid.
Delightful!—now am I the happiest dog alive:—yes, yes, Vapid!
let the town damn your plays, the women will never desert you. [

Servant

] That's a good sign,
that fellow isn't used to this kind of business—so much the
better—practice is the destruction of love——yes, I shall indulge a
beautiful woman,—gratify myself, and, perhaps, get the last scene for
my unfinished comedy.

Lady.
Sir, your most obedient.

Ma'am.

Lady.
Pray keep your seat, sir—I beg I mayn't disturb you.

Vapid.
By no means, ma'am, give me leave—[
Both sit.

have we here?

Aside.

Lady.
I am told, sir, you have business for Lady Waitfor't?

Vapid.
Yes, ma'am—being my first appearance in that character, but I
could wait whole hours for so beautiful a woman.

Lady.
Oh, sir!

Vapid.
Yes—I am no stranger to her charms——sweet young creature!

Lady.
Nay, dear sir, not so
very
young.

Vapid.
Your pardon, ma'am,—and her youth enhances her other
merits.—But, oh! she has one charm that surpasses all.

Lady.
Has she, sir?—What may that be?

Vapid.
Her passion for the stage.

Lady.
Sir!

Vapid.
Yes, her passion for the stage; that, in my mind, makes her the
first of her sex.

Lady.
Sir, she has no passion for the stage.

Vapid.
Yes, yes, she has.

Lady.
But I protest she has not.

Vapid.
But I declare and affirm it as a fact, she has a strong passion
for the stage, and a violent attachment for all the people that belong
to it.

Lady.
Sir, I don't understand you—explain.

Vapid.
Hark ye,—we are alone—I promise it shall go no further, and
I'll let you into a secret—I know——

Lady.
Well, what do you know?

Vapid.
I know a certain dramatic author with whom she——he had a
letter from her this morning.

[Pg 22]
Lady.
What?

Vapid.
Yes,—an assignation—don't be alarmed—the man may be depended
on—he is safe—very safe!—Long in the habit of intrigue—a good person
too!—a very good person indeed.

Lady.
Amazement!

Vapid.
[
Whispering her.
] Hark ye, he means to make her happy in less
than half an hour.

Lady.
[
Rising.
] Sir, do you know who you're talking to?—do you know
who I am?

Vapid.
No,—How the devil should I?

Lady.
Then know I am Lady Waitfor't!

Vapid.
You Lady Waitfor't!

Lady.
Yes, sir—the only Lady Waitfor't!

Vapid.
Mercy on me!—here's incident!

Lady.
Yes, and I am convinced you were sent here by that traitor,
Neville.—Speak, is he not your friend?

Vapid.
Yes, ma'am:—I know Mr Neville.—Here's equivoque!

Lady.
This is some trick, some stratagem of his.—He gave you the
letter to perplex and embarrass me.

Vapid.
Gave the letter! 'gad that's great.—Pray, ma'am, give me leave
to ask you one question—Did you write to Mr Neville?

Lady.
Yes, sir,—to confess the truth, I did—but from motives——

Vapid.
Stop, my dear ma'am, stop—I have it—now,—let me be
clear—first, you send him a letter; is it not so? yes: then he gives it
to me—very well: then I come (supposing you only twenty) mighty
well!—then you turn out ninety—charming!—-then comes the
embarrassment: then the eclaircissement! Oh! it's glorious!—Give me
your hand—you have atoned for every thing.

Lady.
O! I owe all this to that villain, Neville—I am not
revengeful—but 'tis a weakness to endure
[Pg 23]
such repeated provocations,
and I am convinced the mind, that too frequently forgives bad actions,
will at last forget good ones.

Vapid.
Bravo! encore, encore—it is the very best sentiment I ever
heard—say it again, pray say it again—I'll take it down, and blend it
with the incident, and you shall be gratified, one day or other, with
seeing the whole on the stage.—"The mind that too frequently forgives
bad actions will at last forget good ones."

[
Taking it down in his
common place book.

Lady.
This madman's folly is not to be borne—if my Lord too should
discover him. [
Vapid
sits, and takes notes.
] Here, the consequences
might be dreadful, and the scheme of Ennui's play all undone.—Sir, I
desire you'll quit my house immediately—Oh! I'll be revenged, I'm
determined.

[
Exit.

Vapid.
What a great exit!—--Very well!—I've got an incident,
however.—'Faith, I have noble talents—to extract gold from lead has
been the toil of numberless philosophers; but I extract it from a baser
metal, human frailty—Oh! it's a great thing to be a dramatic genius!—a
very great thing indeed.

[
As he is going
,

Enter
Lord Scratch
.

Vapid.
Sir, your most devoted,——How d'ye do?

Lord.
Sir, your most obedient.

Vapid.
Very warm tragedy weather, sir!—but, for my part, I hate
summer, and I'll tell you why,—the theatres are shut, and when I pass
by their doors in an evening, it makes me melancholy—I look upon them
as the tombs of departed friends that were wont to instruct and delight
me—I don't know how you feel—perhaps you are not in my way?

Lord.
Sir!

Vapid.
Perhaps you don't write for the stage—if
[Pg 24]
you do,—hark
ye—there is a capital character in this house for a farce.

Lord.
Why! what is all this—who are you?

Vapid.
Who am I?—here's a question! in these times who can tell who
he is?—for aught I know I may be great uncle to yourself, or first
cousin to Lady Waitfor't—the very woman I was about to—but no
matter—since you're so very inquisitive, do you know who you are?

Lord.
Look ye, sir, I am Lord Scratch.

Vapid.
A peer! pshaw! contemptible;—when I ask a man who he is, I
don't want to know what are his titles, and such nonsense; no, Old
Scratch, I want to know what he has written, when he had the curtain up,
and whether he's a true son of the drama.—Harkye, don't make yourself
uneasy on my account—In my next pantomime, perhaps, I'll let you know
who I am, Old Scratch.

[
Exit.

Lord.
Astonishing! can this be Lady Waitfor't's house—"Very warm
tragedy weather, sir!" "In my next pantomime, let you know who I
am."—Gad, I must go and investigate the matter immediately, and if she
has wronged me, by the blood of the Scratches, I'll bring the whole
business before parliament, make a speech ten hours long, reduce the
price of opium, and set the nation in a lethargy.

[
Exit.

SCENE II.

A Library in
Lady Waitfor't's
House.—A Sofa and two Chairs.

Enter
Vapid
.

Vapid.
Either this house is a labyrinth, or I, in reflecting on my
incident, have forgot myself; for so
[Pg 25]
it is I can't find my way out—who
have we here? by the sixtieth night, my little partner!

Enter
Marianne
, with a Book in her Hand.

Mari.
The poet I danced with!—he little thinks how much I've thought
of him since—Sir.

[
Courtesying.

Vapid.
Ma'am.

[
Bowing.
]

Mari.
I hope, sir, you caught no cold the other night?

Vapid.
No, ma'am, I was much nearer a fever than a cold.—Pray, ma'am,
what is your study?

Mari.
I have been reading "All for Love."—Pray, sir, do you know any
thing about plays?

Vapid.
Know any thing about plays!—there's a question!

Mari.
I know so much about them, that I once acted at a private
theatre.

Vapid.
Did you? Then you acted for your own amusement, and nobody's
else: what was the play?

Mari.
I can't tell!

Vapid.
Can't tell?

Mari.
No,—nobody knew,—it's a way they have.

Vapid.
Then they never act a play of mine.—With all this partiality
for the stage—perhaps you would be content with a dramatist for
life—particularly if his morals were fine?

Mari.
Lord! I don't care about fine morals—I'd rather my husband had
fine teeth,—and I'm told most women of fashion are of the same opinion.

Vapid.
To be sure they are,—but could you really consent to run away
with a poet?

Mari.
'Faith—with all my heart—they never have any money, you know,
and, as I have none, our distress would be complete; and, if we had any
luck, our adventures would become public, and then we should get into a
novel at last.

[Pg 26]
Vapid.
Into a prison, more probably—if she goes on in this way, I
must dramatize her first,—and run away with her afterwards. [
Aside.
]
Come, are you ready?

Lady W.
[
Without.
] Tell my lord, sir, I'll wait in the library.

Mari.
Oh lord! my aunt, what's to be done?

Vapid.
What's to be done!—why?

Mari.
She mustn't find you here—she'll be the death of us, she is so
violent.

Vapid.
Well, I'm not afraid—she's no manager.

Mari.
If you have any pity for me—here—hide yourself for a moment
behind this sofa, and I'll get her out of the room directly.

Vapid.
Behind the sofa! here's an incident!

Mari.
Nay—pray—she's here! come—quick!—quick!—

[
Vapid
gets behind the Sofa,
Marianne
sits on it, takes out her work
bag, and begins singing——

Mari.
Toll de roll, &c.

Enter
Lady Waitfor't
.

Lady.
Marianne, how came you here? I desire you'll leave the room
directly.

Mari.
Leave the room, aunt?

Lady.
Yes, leave the room immediately—what are you looking at?

Mari.
Nothing, aunt, nothing—Lord! lord! what will become of poor,
poor Mr Poet?

[
Exit.

Lady.
So—here's my lord—now to mention Ennui's play, and if it does
but prejudice him against him, Willoughby marries Louisa, and Neville is
in my own power.

Enter
Lord Scratch
.

Lord.
That curst pantomime ruffian! nobody knows any thing about
him—perhaps my lady has
[Pg 27]
got a sudden touch of the dramatic mania, and
prefers him—here she is—now if she would talk about the stage.

Lady.
Pray be seated, my lord—I want to ask you a favour.

Lord.
Ask me a favour? Is it possible?

[
They sit.

Lady.
Yes, for your friend Ennui—what do you think he has done?

Lord.
What?

Lady.
Turned author.—He has written a comedy.

Lord.
A comedy!—she has it.

Lady.
Yes—it's very true, and it has been approved of by men of the
first dramatic fame.

Lord.
Dramatic fame! she has it!—dam'me, she has it!

Lady.
Nay, if you need farther proof, my lord, it has been approved by
the manager of one of the theatres, and the curtain is to draw up next
winter.

Lord.
The curtain draw up!—Look ye, madam, I care no more for the
manager or his theatre——

Lady.
Now, my lord, the favour I have to ask of you is this—promise
me to peruse the play, make alterations, and write the epilogue.

Lord.
The epilogue!—fire and forefathers!

[
Lady
holds him.

Lady.
Ay, or the prologue.

Lord.
The prologue! blood and gunpowder!

[
Vapid
comes from behind the sofa, and smacks him on the back.

Vapid.
Prologue or epilogue!—I'm the man—I'll write you both.

Lord.
There he is again!

Lady.
Oh! I shall faint with vexation!—My lord, I desire you'll
misinterpret nothing—every thing shall be explained to you.—Marianne!

Lord.
Here's the curtain up with a vengeance!

[Pg 28]
Enter
Marianne
.

Lady.
Answer me directly, how came that gentleman in this apartment? I
know it is some trick of yours.

Vapid.
[
Coming down the stage.
] To be sure, never any thing was so
fortunate!—upon my soul, I beg your pardon; but, curse me, if I can
help laughing, to think how lucky it was for you both I happened to be
behind the sofa!—ha! ha! ha!

Mari.
[
As if taking the hint.
] 'Faith, no more can I—to be sure it
was the luckiest thing in the world! ha! ha! ha!

[
Here they both laugh loud, and point to my
Lord
, and
Lady Waitfor't
,
who stand, between them in amazement.

Lady.
Sir, I insist you lay aside this levity, and instantly explain
how you came in this room.

Lord.
Ay, sir,—explain.

Vapid.
Never fear, old lady—I'll bring you off, depend on't.

Lady.
Bring me off, sir! speak out, sir, how came you in this
apartment?

Vapid.
With all my heart—by her ladyship's own appointment.

Lady.
My own appointment!—--I shall run wild.

Vapid.
To be sure you have hardly forgot your own hand writing.

Lord.
Her own hand writing!—get on, sir,—I beseech you, get on.

Vapid.
Why, look ye, old Scratch,—you seem to be an admirer of this
lady's.—Now I think it my duty as a moral dramatist—a moral dramatist,
sir, mark that—to expose hypocrisy—therefore, sir, there is the
letter, read it, and be convinced of your error.

Lord.
Very well; have you done, sir—have you
[Pg 29]
done?—consider I'm a
peer of the realm, and I shall die if I don't talk.

Vapid.
And now, sir, I must beg a favour of you—[
Gets close to
him.
]—keep the whole affair secret, for if it gets hacknied, it loses
its force.—To bring it all on the stage: hush! say nothing—it will
have a capital effect, and brother bards will wonder where I stole
it—your situation will be wonderful—you hav'n't an idea how ridiculous
you will look—you will laugh very much at yourself, I assure you.

Lord.
What is all this! Well, now I will speak—I'll wait no longer.

Vapid.
Yes, yes, I shall take care of you,—Falstaff in the buck
basket will be nothing to it—he was only the dupe of another man's
wife,—you'll be the dupe of your own, you know—"think of that, Master
Brook, think of that." Well, your servant.

[
Exit.

Lord.
He's gone without hearing me!—then there's an end of every
thing, for here I stand, once a barrister,—since a country gentleman,
and now a peer; and, though I have made twenty attempts to speak, I
can't be heard a syllable,—mercy! what will this world come to! A peer,
and not be heard!

Lady.
My lord,—assured of my innocence, I have no doubt of justifying
my own conduct, and even by means of that letter increasing your
affection.—It was written to another person—your ungrateful nephew.

Lord.
My nephew?

Lady.
Yes, sir, I could not perceive him losing the esteem of his
friends, without having the desire to reclaim him—indeed, I knew no
better mode of fulfilling my project, than by personally warning him of
his situation.—For this purpose, I wrote that letter, and I never
thought it would have been thus misused.—If there is any improper
warmth in the expressions, it only proceeds from my anxiety of
[Pg 30]
ensuring
an interview.—I hope, sir, you are satisfied.

Lord.
Why, I believe you, my lady; and I should be perfectly satisfied
if I could forget your passion for the stage, and that madman behind the
sofa.

Lady.
As to that, sir, this young lady can best inform you.—I desired
him to leave the house an hour ago.

Mari.
[
Aside.
] I'm afraid my only way is to confess all.—My lord,
if I confess the truth, I hope you'll prevail on my aunt to forgive me.

Lord.
Tell what you know, and I'll answer for your forgiveness.

Mari.
Why, sir, I found the gentleman alone, and not having had a

tête-a-tête
a long time, I pressed him to stay, and, on hearing your
voice, I put him behind the sofa,—that you might not think any thing
had happened,—and, indeed, sir, nothing did happen—upon my word he's
as quiet, inoffensive a gentleman as yourself.

Lord.
My fears are over! Oh! you finished composition! come to my
arms, and when I suspect you again—[
Coughs much.
]—this curst cough,
it takes one so suddenly!

Enter
Ennui
.

Ennui.
I've an idea—Floriville is arrived—in fact—I just now spoke
to him.

Lord.
Floriville arrived!—Come, my lady—let's go see what his
travels have done for him.—Hark ye, Ennui—prepare for your interview
with Louisa, and remember you make a mandarin member.—Come, my
lady—nay, never irritate your feelings.

[
Exeunt
Lord
and
Lady
.

Mari.
So—poor Mr Neville is to lose Miss Courtney.—Her present
quarrel with him is so violent, that she may marry this idiot merely in
revenge.—If I
[Pg 31]
could dupe him now, and ensure her contempt.—I'll
try.—Mr Ennui, have you seen your intended wife yet?

Ennui.
No.

Mari.
So I thought—why you'll never please her while you remain as
you are.—You must alter your manners.—She is all life!—all
spirits!—and loves a man the very opposite to you.

Ennui.
I've an idea—I'm very sorry—in fact—how can I please her?

Mari.
There's the difficulty—let me see—the sort of man she prefers
is—you know Sir Harry Hustle?—a man all activity and confidence!—who
does every thing from fashion, and glories in confessing it.

Ennui.
Sir Harry Hustle?—in fact—he's a modern blood of fashion.

Mari.
I know—that's the reason she likes him, and you must become the
same, if you wish to win her affection—a new dress—bold looks—a few
oaths, and much swaggering, effects the business. [
Ennui
puts himself
in attitudes.
] Ay, that's right, you are the very man already.

Ennui.
I'm a lad of fashion!—eh, dam'me!—I've an idea—I shall fall
asleep in the midst of it.

Mari.
No, no;—go about it directly—see Sir Harry Hustle, and study
your conversation before hand—but remember Louisa is so fond of
fashion, that you can't boast too much of its vices and absurdities.

Ennui.
If virtue was the fashion, I should be virtuous!—I should,
dam'me!

Mari.
Ay, that's the very thing—well;—good bye, Mr Ennui—success
attend you—mind you talk enough.

Ennui.
Talk!—I'll talk till I fall asleep!—I will! dam'me!

[
Exit, swaggering.—
Marianne
laughing.

[Pg 32]

ACT THE THIRD.

SCENE I.

A Saloon in
Lady Waitfor't's
House.

Louisa
discovered reading.

Louisa.
Heigho! these poets are wonderfully tiresome—always on the
same theme—nothing but love—I'm weary of it. [
Lays down the book, and
rises.
] Ungenerous Neville! how could he use me so cruelly? to attempt
to gain my affections, and then address another? Lady Waitfor't has
convinced me of the fact,—I can never forgive him: yet, I fear I love
him still—well, I'll even go examine my heart, and determine whether I
do love him or not.

Enter
Neville
, as she is going out.

Mr Neville!—I thought, sir, I had desired we might never meet again.

Nev.
'Tis true, madam, and I meant to obey your commands, hard as they
were, implicitly obey them—but I came hither to welcome my brother, and
not to intrude on the happiness of her I am doomed to avoid.

Louisa.
If I remember, sir, truth was ever among the foremost of your
virtues?

Nev.
Yes—and I am confident you have no reason to doubt it—though
you have cause to censure my presumption, you have none to suspect my
fidelity.

Louisa.
Oh no!—I don't suspect your fidelity in
[Pg 33]
the least, but when
people are faithful to more than one, you know, Mr Neville——

Nev.
I don't understand you, ma'am.

Louisa.
It is no matter, Mr Neville—you may spare yourself any
trouble in attempting to justify your conduct—I am perfectly satisfied,
sir, I'll assure you.

[
Going.

Nev.
Oh, do not leave me in this anxious state!—perhaps this is the
last time we shall ever meet, and to part thus, would embitter every
future moment of my life. Indeed, I have no hopes that concern not your
happiness—no wishes that relate not to your esteem.

Louisa.
Sir,—I will freely confess to you, had you shown the least
perseverance in your affection or sincerity in your behaviour, I could
have heard your addresses with pleasure—but to listen to them now, Mr
Neville, would be to approve a conduct, my honour prompts me to resent,
and my pride to despise.

Nev.
Then I am lost indeed!—'Tis to the perfidious Lady Waitfor't I
owe all this—my present

Enter
Lady Waitfor't
, behind.

misery—my future pain—are all the product of her jealous rage!—She is
so vile a hypocrite, that—

Lady.
[
Coming forward.
] Who is a hypocrite, sir?

Nev.
Madam!

Lady.
Who is a hypocrite, sir? answer me.

Nev.
Ask your own heart, that can best inform you.

Lady.
Tell me, Mr Neville, what have I done, that you dare insult me
thus?

Nev.
What have you done! look on that lady, madam;—there all my hopes
and wishes were combined!—There was the very summit of my bliss!—I
thought I had attained it; but in the moment of my happiness, you came,
crushed every hope, and baffled all my joys.

[Pg 34]
Lady.
Upon my word, sir, very romantic,—but I thank Heaven, I look
for approbation in a better opinion than that of Mr Neville's.

Nev.
'Tis well you do, madam; for were I your judge, your punishment
should be exemplary.—But I'll waste words no more—I only hope [
To

Louisa
.
] you, madam, are satisfied that one of my errors may at least
be forgiven, and this last suspicion for ever blotted from your memory.

Lady.
Sir,—from that lady's forgiveness you have nothing to
expect—if she consents to pardon you, I'll take care my lord never
shall.

Nev.
No—I do not hope for forgiveness—I have heard her
determination; and, cruel as it is, to that I must resign;—she may be
assured I never will intrude where I know I offend.

Louisa.
Do you then leave us, Mr Neville?

Nev.
Yes, madam,—and for ever!—--May you be as blest in the
gratification of your hopes as I have been wretched in the
disappointment of mine.

[
Exit.

Lady.
Tyrant! I wish he had stayed to hear reason—I hope he is not
serious in leaving us.

Louisa.
You hope!—Why does it concern you?

Lady.
Oh! no further than from that general love I bear mankind.—You
forget my feelings on these occasions, Louisa.

Louisa.
Yes, indeed—I have too much reason to attend to my
own!—You'll excuse me—I have particular business—I'll return
immediately.

[
Exit.

Lady.
Oh! the cause of her confusion is evident—she loves him
still—but they shall never meet again—I have already sent a letter to
Willoughby, which imparts a scheme I have long cherished. My lord, in
his anger about my stage mania, has forgot Ennui's play; so, that there
may be no bars to Willoughby's happiness, I am determined Louisa shall
be his this very night.

[Pg 35]
Enter
Lord Scratch
.

Lord.
Here's a spectacle for a peer! Floriville is below, and has
returned from his travels a finished coxcomb.—I'll not give him a
farthing.

Lady.
Nay, my lord, perhaps you may be mistaken.

Lord.
Mistaken! no,—he has travelled not to see, but to say he had
seen.

Enter
Marianne
, with a French Watch and Chain.

Mari.
Oh, uncle-in-law! look here——I never saw any thing so elegant
in all my life.

Lord.
Whose present is this?

Mari.
Whose!—why the sweet gentleman's just arrived from
Italy.—Lord! he's a dear man!—He has promised to do every thing for
me—to get me a fortune—to get me a husband—to get me a——

Lord.
Hush! you don't know what you are talking about.

Mari.
Yes, but I do, though—he has told me every thing—Lord! I have
heard such things!—Come here, near—[
Lord Scratch
gets close to her.
]
get my aunt out of the room, and I'll tell you stories that shall make
your old heart bound again! Hush! do it quietly—I will, upon my
honour.—What an old fool it is!

[
Aside.

Lady.
Marianne, you mustn't listen to Mr Floriville,—for travellers
may persuade you into any thing—and many a woman has been ruined in one
country, by being told it is the fashion in another.

Lord.
Here he comes: I see, as plain as my peerage, I sha'n't keep my
temper.

Enter
Floriville
.

Flor.
Ladies, a thousand pardons, for not waiting on
[Pg 36]
you before, but
this is the first vacant moment I have had since my arrival in Bath.

Mari.
Sir, your coming at all is taken as a very great compliment,
I'll assure you.

Lady.
Leave the room immediately—no reply—I will be obeyed—[
To

Marianne
, who exits.
] Mr Floriville, we are very happy to see you.

Flor.
Ma'am, you do me honour—my lord, where's Harry?—I thought to
have found him here;—what, he didn't chuse to stay?—so much the
better—it shows he's not a man of ceremony—we do the same in Italy.
But, hark ye, uncle,—is this the lady I'm to call my aunt?

Lord.
My gorge is rising: I shall certainly do him a mischief.

Flor.
[
Spying at her.
] Rather experienced or so—a little antique,
eh!—however, the same motive that makes her a good aunt to me, will
make her a good wife to you—you understand me?

Lord.
Dam'me if I do.

Flor.
Well, well, no matter—come, I want to hear every thing—to know
what remarkable occurrences have happened since I left England.—Pray,
Lady Waitfor't, inform me—do let me know every little circumstance.

Lady.
Rather, sir, we should ask of you what happened in your travels?

Flor.
Oh, nothing so shocking!—no man can be the herald of his own
praise.

Lady.
Yes, sir,—but I wish to know how you like the Chapel of
Loretto, the Venus de Medicis of Florence, the Vatican at Rome, and all
the numberless curiosities peculiar to the countries you have travelled
through?

Lord.
Look ye—I'll answer for it, he knows nothing of the gentlemen
you mention—do you, my sweet pretty?—Oh! you damned puppy!

[Pg 37]
Flor.
Why swear, my lord?

Lord.
Swear, my lord! Zounds! it's my prerogative, and, by——tell me
how you spent your time, sir?

Flor.
Why, in contemplating living angels, not dead antiquities;—in
basking in the rays of beauty, not mouldering in the dust of
ancestry;—in mirth, festivity, and pleasure; not study, pedantry, and
retirement.—Oh, I have lived, sir! lived for myself, not an ungrateful
world, who, should I die a martyr to their cause, would only laugh and
wonder at my folly.

Lady.
You seem to know the world, Mr Floriville.

Flor.
No, ma'am, I know little of mankind, and less of myself,—I have
no pilot, but my pleasures;—no mistress, but my passions;—and I don't
believe, if it was to save my life, I could reason consequentially for a
minute together.

Lord.
Granted:—you have seen every thing worth seeing, yet know
nothing worth knowing;—and now you have just knowledge enough to prove
yourself a fool on every subject.

Flor.
Vastly well, my lord—upon my word, you improve with your title,
but I am perfectly satisfied, believe me—for what I don't know, I take
for granted is not worth knowing—therefore we'll call another
topic.—I'm in love, my lord.

Lord.
In love!—with who, sir?

Flor.
Can't you guess?

Lord.
No, sir, I cannot.

Flor.
With one that will please you very much—at least, ought to
please you—you'll be in raptures, dear uncle.

Lord.
Raptures! and you shall be in agonies, my dear nephew.

Flor.
You have known one another a long while, yet you hav'n't met for
years—you have loved one an
[Pg 38]
other a long while, yet you quarrelled not
an hour ago—you have differed from one another all your lives, yet you
are likely to be friends as long as you live—and, above all, the person
is now in the house.

Lord.
In this house! let me know who it is this moment, or by the
blood of the Scratches——

Flor.
One who has charms enough to set the world on fire;—one who has
fortune enough to set a state at war, sir;—one who has talents, health,
and prosperity, and yet not half what the person deserves:—can you tell
now, sir?

Lord.
No, sir, and if you don't tell this instant——

Flor.
Then I'll tell you, [
Slaps him on the back.
] it's myself, sir!
my own charming self!—I have searched the world over, and I don't find
any thing I like half so well.

[
Walks up the stage.

Lord.
I won't disgrace myself,—I won't lower the dignity of peerage,
by chastising a commoner;—else, you Prince of Butterflies——come, my
lady——look ye, sir—I intend to be handed down to posterity; and,
while you are being lampooned in ballads and newspapers, I mean to cut a
figure in the History of England:—so, come along, my lady—in the
History of England, you coxcomb!

Exeunt
Lord
and
Lady

Flor.
If the face is the picture of the mind, that intended aunt of
mine is a great hypocrite, and the story I heard of the poet proves
it.—But now for a frolic—'gad it's very strange I could never reform,
and become a serious thinking being—but what's the use of thinking?

Reason stays till we call, and then not oft is near,

But honest instinct comes a volunteer!—

SCENE II.

An Apartment in
Lady Waitfor't's
House.

Enter
Willoughby
and
Servant
.

Will.
[
To
Servant
.
] Tell your mistress I shall be punctual to the
appointment. [
Exit
Servant
.
] So, thanks to fortune, Lady Waitfor't has
at length consented to my entreaties, and this night makes Louisa mine
for ever!—now to read the letter once more.

[
Reads.

Louisa accompanies me to-night to Lady Walton's, which
you know is at the extremity of the town—on some
pretence or other I'll tell her I have ordered the
servant at the back gate which adjoins the
paddock,—there I'll leave her—and if you have a
chaise waiting near the spot, you may conduct her where
you please.—You know my feelings on this occasion, but
it is for her good only, I'll assure you—she don't
deserve it, Mr Willoughby:—indeed she don't deserve
it.

A. Waitfor't.

So—this is beyond my hopes!—ha! my Lord, and Louisa with him, come to
receive Ennui, whom, to my astonishment, I met just now swearing and
capering, and boasting of the vices of fashion—but no matter—I must to
the rendezvous immediately—now, Louisa, tremble at my vengeance!

[
Exit.

Enter
Lord Scratch
and
Louisa
.

Lord.
Yes, yes:—Ennui will be here in an instant—but he's so
reserved—and so mild—

Louisa.
So I understand, sir—and so very silent, that he won't talk
so much in a year, as I intend in an hour.

Lord.
I know—that's the reason I bring him into parliament—he'll
never speak—only say "Ay" or
[Pg 40]
"No," and be up stairs to beef-steaks in
an instant, [
Knock.
] Here he is!—now encourage him—don't mind his
diffidence—

Louisa.
No, sir—I'll do all in my power to make him talk.

Lord.
That's well—I'll leave you together—I won't interrupt you,
[
Stamping without.
] Odso!—I must get out of the way,—encourage him;
Louisa—I beseech you encourage him!

[
Exit.

Ennui.
[
Without.
] Stand by! no ceremony, damme!—

Louisa.
Heaven!—is this diffidence?

Enter
Ennui
and
Servant
.

Ennui.
Get down stairs, you dog—get down,—[
Exit
Servant
.
] Here I
am, ma'am:—ease is every thing—I'll seat myself—now for
business!—yaw—aw!—

[
Yawns aside.

Louisa.
Sir!

Ennui.
In one word, I'll tell you my character,—I'm a lad of
fashion!—I love gaming—I hate thinking—I like racing—I despise
reading—I patronize boxing—I detest reasoning—I pay debts of
honour,—not honourable debts—in short, I'll kick your servants—cheat
your family, and fight your guardian—and so if you like me, take
me—heh, damme!—I'm tired already!—yaw—aw.

[
Yawns aside.

Louisa.
Astonishing!—Mr Ennui—

Ennui.
Ma'am? yaw—aw!

[
Aside.

Louisa.
Mr Ennui, can you be in your senses?

Ennui.
In fact—I don't comprehend [
Forgetting
himself.
]—Oh—ay—senses! [
Recollecting himself.
] a lad of fashion
in his senses!—that's a very good joke!—if one of us had any sense,
the rest would shut him up in a cabinet of curiosities, or show him as a
wonderful animal:—they would, damme!—I can't support it!—yaw—aw!

[
Yawns aside.

Louisa.
So, you glory in your ignorance?

[Pg 41]
Ennui.
Ma'am—yaw! aw!

[
Aside.

Louisa.
So, you glory in your ignorance—in your vices?

Ennui.
I've an idea—I can't understand—[
Forgetting
himself.
]—vices! Oh:—ay, damme, to be sure; [
Recollecting himself.
]
you must be wicked, or you can't be visited—singularity is every
thing,—every man must get a character, and I'll tell you how I first
got mine:—I pretended to intrigue with my friend's wife,—paragraph'd
myself in the newspapers,—got caricatured in the print-shops—made the
story believed,—was abused by every body,—noticed for my gallantry by
every body—and at length visited by every body—I was, damme!—I'm
curst sleepy,—yaw—aw!

[
Yawns aside.

Louisa.
Incredible!—but if singularity is your system, perhaps being
virtuous would make you as particular as any thing.

Ennui.
Vastly well!—'gad, you're like me, a wit, and don't know it.
[
Taking out his Watch.
] How goes the enemy?—more than half the day
over!—tol de rol lol! [
Humming a tune.
] I'm as happy as if I was at a
fire, or a general riot.—Come to my arms, thou angel—thou—[
As he
goes to embrace her,
Lord Scratch
enters—he embraces him.
]
Ah,—Scratch!—my friend Scratch!—sit down, my old boy—sit
down,—we've settled every thing.

[
Forces him into a Chair, and sits by
him.
]

Lord.
Why,—what is all this?

Ennui.
She's to intrigue, and you and I are to go halves in the
damages—some rich old Nabob—we'll draw him into
crim. con.
—bring an
action directly, and a ten thousand pound verdict at least—eh, damme!—

Lord.
Why he's mad!—that dramatic maniac has bit him.

Ennui.
Get a divorce—marry another, and go halves again, damme!

[Pg 42]
Lord.
[
Rising.
] Why, look ye, you impostor!—you—didn't you come
here to pay your addresses to this lady? and wasn't I to bring you into
parliament, for your quiet silent disposition?

Ennui.
[
Pushing him out of his way.
] Hold your tongue! out of the
way, Scratch!—out of the way, or I'll do you a mischief—I will,
damme!—Zounds!—a'nt I at the top of the beau monde? and don't I set
the fashions?—if I was to cut off my head, wouldn't half the town do
the same?—they would, damme!—I get sleepy again!—yaw—aw!—

[
Aside.

Lord.
Here now!—here's a mandarin member;—why, he'd have bred a
civil war!—made ten long speeches in a day!—cut your head off,
indeed!—curse me but I wish you would—you must be silent then—you
couldn't talk without a head, could you?

Ennui.
Yes, in parliament—as well without a head as with one—do you
think a man wants a head for a long speech, damme!—

Enter
Servant
.

Servant.
Her ladyship is waiting, ma'am.

Louisa.
Oh, I attend her,—Mr Ennui, your most obedient.

Ennui.
[
Taking her Hand.
] With your leave, ma'am.—You see,
Scratch—you see.

Lord.
Why, Louisa!—

Ennui.
Keep your distance, Scratch—contemplate your superiors,—look
at me with the same awful respect a city beau looks at a prince,—this
way, most angelic—Scratch, cut your head off—this way, most angelic.

[
Exit with
Louisa
.

Lord.
Here's treatment!—was ever poor peer so tormented?—what am I
to do?—I'll go to Lady Waitfor't, for from her alone I meet
relief,—find a silent member, indeed!—by my privilege one might as
soon find a pin in the ocean,—charity in a bench of bishops,—or wit in
Westminster hall!

[
Exit.

[Pg 43]

ACT THE FOURTH.

SCENE I.

The Paddock near
Lady Walton's
House—A View of the House at a
distance, and partly moonlight.

Willoughby
alone.

Willoughby.
'Tis past the hour Lady Waitfor't appointed—why does she delay? I
cannot have mistaken the place—yonder's Lady Walton's house—Oh! 'would
all were past, and Louisa safely mine! I hear a noise—by Heaven 'tis
she! and with her all my happiness—I'll withdraw a while, and observe
them.

[
Retires.

Enter
Lady Waitfor't
and
Louisa Courtney
.

Louisa.
My dear Lady Waitfor't, why do you loiter here? you cannot
find your servants in this place—let us return to Lady Walton's.

Lady.
No, no, they must be here,—I ordered them to wait in this very
spot, to avoid confusion. What can have become of Willoughby?

[
Aside.

Louisa.
If you have the least sense of fear for yourself, or regard
for me, I beg we may return to Lady Walton's.

Lady.
No, no, I tell you I ordered William at the back gate, that he
might conduct us through the paddock to our carriage; you know we might
have been whole hours getting through the crowd the other way—do be a
little patient, hav'n't I as much reason to be alarmed as yourself?

Louisa.
Yes, but you have not the apprehension I have; I don't know
why, but I am terrified beyond description.

Lady.
Well, well, never fear; [
Looking out.
] Oh, yonder's
Willoughby! now for the grand design! [
Aside.
] Louisa, if you'll wait
here a moment I'll
[Pg 44]
step to the next gate, and see if they are
there;—they cannot escape us then.

Louisa.
No, no, don't leave me;—I wouldn't stay by myself for the
world.

Lady.
Ridiculous! can't you protect yourself for an instant? must you
be all your life watch'd like a baby in leading-strings? Oh! I am
ashamed of you—only wait a moment, lest they pass by in my absence, and
I'll return to you immediately.

Louisa.
Well: don't stay.

Lady.
Stay! what have you to be frightened at? I shall not be out of
call;—besides, if there's any fear of a personal attack, may not I be
as terrified as yourself? It isn't the first time, I'll assure you, but
that's no matter;—show yourself a woman of spirit, and, at least,
emulate one of my virtues.—Now, Willoughby, the rest is thine!

[
Exit.

Willoughby
comes forward.

Willoughby.
Be not alarmed, Miss Courtney.

Louisa.
Mr Willoughby!

Willoughby.
Yes, madam; the man you most avoid.

Louisa.
Tell me, sir, immediately, how, and by whose appointment, you
came here?

Willoughby.
By love, madam; the same passion that has prompted me to
pursue you for years, now happily conducts me hither;—I come to lessen
your fears, not to increase them.

Louisa.
Then, leave me, sir, I can protect myself.

Willoughby.
No, not till you have heard and pitied me; I have been
long your suitor, and long scorned by you; you have treated me with
indifference, and preferred my inferiors; how I have deserved all this,
yourself can best explain, but, to prove all former cruelties are
forgotten, I here offer you my hand, and, with it, my heart.

Louisa.
Sir,—this is no time for hearing you on this subject; if you
wish to oblige me, leave me.

[Pg 45]
Willoughby.
No, not till I am answered;—years may elapse ere I shall
have another opportunity like the present, therefore no time can be so
well as now.

Louisa.
Then I command you to leave me,—I will not be threatened into
a compliance.

Willoughby.
Look ye, Miss Courtney—I would avoid taking advantage of
your situation—nay, start not—but if you persist in your contempt of
me, I know not to what extremities passion may hurry me; I have every
motive for redress, and, if you do not instantly give me your word, to
prefer me to that beggar Neville, I may do that, my cooler sense would
scorn.

Louisa.
Beggar, sir!

Willoughby.
Yes; and, were he not beneath my resentment, I'd tell you
more;—but he is too poor—too—

Louisa.
Hold, sir; did you resemble him, I might esteem, nay, adore
you; but as you are, I loath, I despise, I defy you;—you take advantage
of my situation!—Hear me, sir,—though not a friend is near,—though
night opposes me, and Heaven deserts me, yet can I smile upon your
menaces, and make you tremble, villain as you are.

Willoughby.
Have a care, madam! another declaration like that, and
I'll delay no longer;—I'll force you to my purpose.

Louisa.
You dare not, on your life you dare not.

Willoughby.
Nay, then—I am not to be terrified by threats,—[
Lays
hold of her.
] all struggling is in vain; this moment gratifies my
revenge,—away!

Louisa.
Off,—let me go! Oh, help! help!

[
As he is forcing her out, enter
Floriville
, half drunk.
]

Flor.
"Donne, donne, donne, dow." [
Singing part of an Italian air.
]
Oh, this burgundy's a glorious liquor! hey-day! who have we here?

Louisa.
Oh, sir! if you have any pity for an in
[Pg 46]
jured, helpless woman,
assist one who never knew distress till now!

Flor.
Go on, ma'am, go on—both damn'd drunk I perceive.

Louisa.
Do not be deaf to my entreaties—do not desert me—

Flor.
Go on, ma'am, go on—I love oratory in a woman.

Louisa.
Gracious Heaven! how have I deserved all this? I see, sir, you
avoid me. I see you are indifferent to my fate.

Flor.
No, ma'am, you wrong me—but in Italy—observe—we always take
these things coolly—now, sir, will you explain?

Willoughby.
No, sir, I will not.

Flor.
You will not?

Willoughby.
No, sir, and I warn you not to listen to the wild ravings
of a senseless woman—it may be better for you, sir.

Flor.
Why so, Prince Prettiman?

Willoughby.
No matter, sir, I will not be amused from my purpose.

Flor.
You won't, old Pluto, won't you? then, ma'am, observe! you shall
behold my mode of fighting—I'll kill him like a gentleman, and he shall
die without a groan;—you'll be delighted, ma'am—I learnt it all in
Italy.—Come, Belzebub, are you ready?

Willoughby.
'Sdeath! what can I do? he is drunk, perhaps I may disarm
him.

Flor.
Now, thou original sin, thou prince of darkness! come out; never
let her see thy black infernal visage more, or by my life I'll pulverize
you—you see, ma'am, no bad orator either—learnt it all in Italy.

Willoughby.
Come on, sir.

Flor.
Ay, now old Sysiphus, push home—but fight like a gentleman, if
you can, for remember, there is a
[Pg 47]
lady in company—observe, ma'am,
observe; you won't see it again.

[
They fight.—
Floriville
disarms

Willoughby
.
]

Flor.
What, vanquished, Tarquin? hah! hah! [
Parrying up and down the
stage by himself.
]—You see, ma'am, you see!—Oh! Italy's your only
country!—Now, ma'am, would you have me kill him here, "in Allegro," or
postpone it, that you may have the pleasure of pinking him yourself, "in
Penseroso?"

Louisa.
[
Coming near
Floriville
, and discovering him.
] Floriville,
my deliverer!—generous man!—No, sir, whatever are his crimes, do not
kill him; his greatest punishment will be to live.

Flor.
There, then, caitiff, take your sword, and, d'ye hear?
retire;—that black front of thine offends the lady;—if you want
another flourish, you will soon find Floriville—abscond.

Willoughby.
Sir, you shall hear from me—distraction!

[
Exit.

Flor.
And now, my dear little angel, how can I assist you? I'm very
sorry that I can't help it—I'm cursed drunk, and not proper company for
a lady of your dignity,—but I won't affront you,—I mean to make myself
agreeable, and if I do not—it is the fault of that place, [
Pointing to
his head.
] and not of this, [
Pointing to his heart.
]

Louisa.
Sir, your conduct has endeared you to me for ever, and while I
live, your generosity and valour shall be engraven on my heart.

Flor.
Gently, gently, have a care, make no declarations; if you are in
love with me, as I suppose you are, keep it secret,—for at this moment
you might raise a flame that would consume us both;—poor creature! how
fond she is of me! any other time I would indulge her, but not
now—[
Looks at her sometime, then runs, and kisses her hand.
]—Oh, you
paragon!—"Angels must paint to look as fair as you."—[
Goes
[Pg 48]
from her
again.
]—I'll leave you, or, by Heaven, it will be all over with us.

Louisa.
No, no, don't desert me! alas! I have no way left but to
commit myself to your care—if I could bring him to recollect me, all
would be safe. Mr Floriville, don't you know me?

Flor.
No, 'would to Heaven I did.

Louisa.
What, not Miss Courtney?

Flor.
What, Louisa? my brother's idol?

Louisa.
Alas! the very same.

Flor.
Then may I die, if I don't get out of your debt before I leave
you—where—where shall I conduct you?

Louisa.
I know not—return to lady Waitfor't's again, I will not—I
had rather be a wanderer all my life—to lady Walton's there is no
excuse for returning, and I know no friend in Bath I dare intrude
upon.—I have so high an opinion, Mr Floriville, of your honour, that,
notwithstanding your present situation, there is no man on earth I would
sooner confide in;—can you then think of any place where I may rest in
safety for a few hours, and then I will set out for my uncle's in the
country.

Flor.
Indeed I cannot, I am a wanderer myself;—I have no home but
what this gentleman is to purchase me [
Taking out his purse.
]—you
cannot partake of that.

Louisa.
Oh! what will become of me?

Flor.
Let me see—I have it—I'll take her to my brother's;—she'll be
safe there, and not a soul shall come near her.—Well, Miss Courtney,—I
have recollected a place where I know you'll be safe—a friend's house,
that will be as secure—nay, don't droop—in Italy we're never
melancholy.

Louisa.
Oh, Mr Floriville, to what a hazard has lady Waitfor't exposed
me!—to her perfidy I owe it all—but yonder's that wretch again—pray
let us begone.

[Pg 49]
Flor.
Belzebub again,—no, no, we mustn't stir;—what! an angel fly
from a devil? damme, I'll stay and crush him.

Louisa.
Nay, sir, reflect,—'twere madness to remain.

Flor.
'Faith that's true; I believe it's braver to retire,—therefore,
Tarquin, adieu; come, my best angel! I'll fight your battles, and if I
don't sink all your enemies, may I never see Italy again as long as I
live!

[
Exeunt.

Enter
Willoughby
.

Willoughby.
Ha! gone,—I am sorry for it—I would have seen them—lady Waitfor't has
just left me, and treated me like her slave,—insulted and derided me;
but I'll have done with her for ever,—I'll be her dupe no more;—she is
now gone to Neville's lodgings, under pretence of pursuing Louisa, but,
in fact, to see him, and prevent his leaving Bath;—this I will write to
my lord, and then let him follow, and be witness of her infamy;—thus, I
hope, I shall make some reparation for the wrongs I have committed, and
prove at last I have some sense of virtue.

[
Exit.

SCENE II.

Neville's
Lodgings—A Closet in back Scene.—Two Chairs, and a Table,
with Wine on it.—A knocking at the Door.

Enter
Peter
, reading a Card.

Peter.

Vapid presents his compliments to his friend Neville; has thought of
nothing but writing the epilogue for his friend's play since they
parted; he has made great progress, and will wait on him to take his
judgment on it in a few minutes.
If the gentleman
[Pg 50]
should come soon, I
fear my master won't be at home to receive him.

[
Knocks.—
Peter
opens the Door, and lets in
Vapid
.

Vapid.
Well, here it is;—where's Neville?

Peter.
Not within, sir.

Vapid.
Yes, yes, here it is:—I must see him.

Peter.
Sir, he's gone out.

Vapid.
Gone out? impossible!

Peter.
Impossible! it's very true, sir.

Vapid.
Gone out! why, I've brought him the epilogue—the new epilogue
to Mr What's-his-name's comedy; the very best thing I ever wrote in my
life; I knew it would delight him.

Peter.
Sir, he has been gone out above these two hours.

Vapid.
Then he'll never forgive himself as long as he lives; why, it's
all correct—all chaste! only one half line wanting at the end to make
it complete.

Peter.
Indeed, sir, it's very unfortunate.

Vapid.
Unfortunate! I wanted to have heard him read it too; when
another person reads it, one often hits on a thought that might
otherwise have escaped; then, perhaps, he would have hit on that cursed
half line, I have so long been working at.

Peter.
Sir, if it is not impertinent, and you'd permit me to read it—

Vapid.
You read it!

Peter.
Yes, sir, if you'd allow me that honour.

Vapid.
'Faith, I should have no objection,—but wouldn't it lower
one's dignity? No, no, Moliere used to read his plays to his servants,
so I believe all's regular.—Come, sir, begin.

[
Peter
reading
Epilogue.

In ancient times, when agonizing wars,

And bleeding nations, fill'd the world with jars;

When murder, battle, sudden death, prevail'd,

When——

Vapid.
Stop—stop—I have it: not a word for
[Pg 51]
your life; I feel
it—it's coming on—the last line directly—quick! quick!

[
Peter

reads.

The tyrant totters, and the senate nods,

Die all, die nobly!——

Peter.
Here's something wanting, sir.

Vapid.
I know it, say nothing—I have it—

[
Walks backwards and forwards.

The tyrant totters, and the senate nods,

Die all, die nobly!——

Oh, damn it! damn it! damn it!—that cursed half line!—I shall never
accomplish it—all so chaste—all so correct,—and to have it marr'd for
want of one half line,—one curst half line! I could almost weep for
disappointment.

Peter.
Never mind, sir, don't perplex yourself,—put in any thing.

Vapid.
Put in any thing! why, 'tis the last line, and the epilogue
must end with something striking, or it will be no trap for applause—no
trap for applause, after all this fine writing!—Put in any thing!—what
do you mean, sirrah?

Peter.
Methinks this is a strange epilogue to a comedy—[
Knock at the
door.
]—Perhaps this is my master—[
Looks out.
]—no, as I live, 'tis
Mr Floriville and Miss Courtney! she mustn't on any account be seen by
this gentleman.

Vapid.
Well, who is it?—"The tyrant totters"—

Peter.
Sir, it's a friend of my master's who has brought a lady with
him—I'm sure you've too much gallantry to interrupt an amour; and,
therefore, you'll be kind enough to get out of the way directly.

Vapid.
Get out of the way! what the devil, in the middle of my
composition?—"Die all, die nobly"—

Peter.
Nay, sir, only step for a moment into this closet, and you
shall be released,—now, pray, sir,—pray be prevailed on.

[Pg 52]
Vapid.
Well, let me see—in this closet! why, here's china, zounds!
would you put a live author in a china closet?

Peter.
What can I do, sir? there is no way out but that door—get in
here for an instant, and I'll show them into the library—now do, sir.

Vapid.
Well, be brief then,—"Die all! die nobly!"—oh! oh! oh!

[
Enters Closet, and
Floriville
and
Louisa
enter.

Flor.
Hey-day!—my old acquaintance, Peter! where's my brother?

Peter.
Sir, he has been out the whole evening.

Louisa.
In the same house with Neville!—oh, Heavens!

Flor.
Well, Miss Courtney, I hope now you are convinced of your
safety.

Louisa.
Yes, sir, but I would it were in any other place; lady
Waitfor't, ere this, is in pursuit of me, and if she discovers me here,
you know too well how much I have to dread.

[
Knock at the Door.—Exit

Peter
.

Flor.
Don't be alarm'd, there's nothing shall molest you.

Louisa.
Oh, sir, you don't know the endless malice of lady
Waitfor't—she will triumph in my misery, and till my lord is convinced
of her duplicity, I see no hope of your brother's happiness, or my own.

Enter
Peter
.

Peter.
Lady Waitfor't is below, inquiring for that lady, or my master.

Flor.
For my brother?

Peter.
Yes, sir, and my lord has sent to know if Mr Vapid, or her
ladyship, have been here;—he was in bed, but on receiving a letter, got
up, and will be here in an instant.

Louisa.
For Heaven's sake, Mr Floriville, let me retire,—I cannot
support the conflict.

[Pg 53]
Flor.
Promise to recall your spirits, and you shall.

Louisa.
What I can do I will.

Flor.
Then know no apprehension, for, on my life, you shall not be
disturbed.

[
Leads her to the Door of the Library, and talks in dumb show.

Vapid.
[
From Closet.
] Peter! Peter! can't you release me?

Peter.
No, sir, don't move, you'll ruin every thing.

Vapid.
Then give me that candle—I have pen and ink—I think I could
finish my epilogue.

Peter.
Here, sir.

[
Giving Candle.

Vapid.
That curst half line—"Die all"—

[
Peter
shuts him in.

Flor.
So, now, the storm begins, and if I don't have some sport with
the enemy—[
Sits at Table, and begins drinking.
]—here she comes.

Enter
Lady Waitfor't
.

Flor.
Chairs, Peter, chairs,—Sit down, ma'am—sit down—you honour me
exceedingly.

Lady.
Where is your brother, sir? I insist on seeing him.

Enter
Lord Scratch
.

Lord.
There she is!—in a man's lodgings at midnight—here's
treatment!

Lady.
My lord, I came here in search of Louisa, who has been betrayed
from my power.

Lord.
Look ye, my lady—read that letter, that's all; read that
letter, and then say, if we sha'n't both cut a figure in the print
shops.

Lady.
[
Taking Letter.
] Ha! Willoughby's hand! [
Reads.
]
Lady
Waitfor't, (I have only time to tell you) is gone to Neville's lodgings,
to meet one she has long had a passion for—follow her, and be convinced
of her duplicity.
Oh, the villain! well, my lord, and pray who is the
man I come to meet?

[Pg 54]
Lord.
Why, who should it be but the stage ruffian? if there was a sofa
in the room, my life on't, he'd pop from behind it.—Zounds! that fellow
will lay straw before my door every nine months!

Lady.
This is fortunate.—[
Aside.
]—Well, sir, if I discover Louisa,
I hope you'll be convinced I came here to redeem her, and not disgrace
myself. Tell me, sir, immediately, where she is concealed.

[
To
Floriville
.

Flor.
Sit down, ma'am—sit down: drink, drink, then we'll talk over
the whole affair—there is no doing business without wine; come, here's
"The glory of gallantry"—I'm sure you'll both drink that.

Lady.
No trifling, sir; tell me where she is concealed;—nay, then
I'll examine the apartment myself—[
Goes to Door of Library.
]—the
door lock'd! give me the key, sir.

Flor.
[
Drinking.
] "The glory of gallantry, ma'am."

Lord.
Hear me, sir, if the lady's in that apartment, I shall be
convinced that you and your brother are the sole authors of all this
treachery; if she is there, by the honour of my ancestors, she shall be
Willoughby's wife to-morrow morning.

Flor.
[
Rising.
] Shall she, my lord? Pray, were you ever in Italy?

Lord.
Why, coxcomb?

Flor.
Because, I'm afraid you've been bitten by a tarantula—you'll
excuse me, but the symptoms are wonderfully alarming—There is a blazing
fury in your eye—a wild emotion in your countenance, and a green spot—

Lord.
Damn the green spot! open that door, and let me see immediately:
I'm a peer, and have a right to look at any thing.

Flor.
[
Standing before the Door.
] No, sir; this door must not be
open'd.

Lord.
Then I'll forget my peerage, and draw my sword.

[Pg 55]
Flor.
[
To
Lady Waitfor't
, who is going to interfere.
] Don't be
alarm'd, ma'am, I'll only indulge him for my own amusement—mere trout
fishing, ma'am—

Enter
Louisa
, from the Apartment.

Louisa.
Hold! I charge you, hold!—let not my unhappy fate be the
source of more calamities.

Lord.
'Tis she herself:—My lady did not come to meet the madman.

Flor.
By the lord, ma'am, you have ruined all.

Louisa.
I know, sir, the consequences of this discovery, and I abide
by them.—But what I have done, I can justify, and 'would to Heaven all
here could do the same!

Flor.
Indeed, I can't tell—I wish I was in Italy.

Lord.
Mark me, madam,—nay, tears are in vain—to-morrow shall make
you the wife of Willoughby; and he shall answer for your follies.—No
reply, sir, [
To
Floriville
, who is going to speak.
] I wou'dn't hear
the chancellor.

Lady.
Now, who is to blame? Oh, virtue is ever sure to meet its
reward!—Come to meet a mad poet, indeed!—My lord, I forgive you only
on condition of your signing a contract to marry me to-morrow, and
Louisa to Willoughby, at the same time.

Lord.
I will, thou best of women!—draw it up immediately—and Neville
shall starve for his treachery.

[
Lady Waitfor't
goes to the Table, and writes.

Louisa.
[
Falling at the feet of
Lord Scratch
.
] Hear me, sir, not for
myself, but for a wrong'd friend, I speak:—Mr Neville knows not of my
concealment; on my honour, he is innocent:—if that lady's wrongs must
be avenged, confine the punishment to me—I'll bear it, with patience
bear it.

Lord.
Let go!—let go, I say!—Lady Waitfor't, make haste with the
contract.

[Pg 56]
Lady.
It only waits the signature.—Now, my lord.

Flor.
Look ye, uncle—she's the cause of all this mischief, and if you
are not lost——

Lord.
Out of my way!—O'd—noise and nonsense!—don't fancy yourselves
in the House of Commons! we're not speaking twenty at a time. Here! give
me the pen—I'll sign directly; and now—

[
As he is going to sign,
Vapid
breaks the China in the Closet, and
rushes out, with the Epilogue in his Hand.

Vapid.
"Die all! die nobly! die like demi-gods!"—Huzza, huzza! 'tis
done! 'tis past! 'tis perfect.

Flor.
Huzza!—the poet at last; "Stop him who can!"

Lady.
Confusion!—tell me, sir, immediately, what do you mean by this
new insult?

Vapid.
"Die all! die nobly! die like demi-gods!"—oh, it's
glorious!—Ah, old Scratch, are you there?—Joy, joy! give me joy!—I've
done your business! the work's past!—the labour's o'er, my boy!—"think
of that, Master Brook—think of that!"

Lady.
My lord, I am vilely treated.—I desire you'll insist on an
explanation.

Flor.
He can't speak, madam.

[
All this time, my
Lord
is slowly walking away.

Lady.
How! are you going to leave me, my lord?

Vapid.
[
Taking out his Common-place Book.
] 'Faith this musn't be
lost!—here's something worth observing.

[
Exit
Lord Scratch
.

Lady.
Oh, I shall burst with rage!—Mr Vapid, I desire you'll explain
how you came in that closet.—Why don't you answer me, sir?

Vapid.
Your pardon, ma'am, I was taking a note of the affair—and yet
I'm afraid——

Lady.
What are you afraid of, sir?

Vapid.
That it has been dramatized before;—it is certainly not a new
case.

[Pg 57]
Lady.
Insupportable!—But I take my leave of you all!—I abandon you
for ever!—I!—oh, I shall go wild!

[
Exit in a rage.

Flor.
Ay, ay, follow his lordship—virtue is ever sure to meet its
reward. Now, Mr Vapid, tell us how you came in that closet?

Vapid.
'Faith, I can't.—I believe the servant hurried me there on
your approach.

Flor.
Then you didn't come to meet lady Waitfor't?

Vapid.
Meet lady Waitfor't!—no, I came to read my epilogue to
Neville; and a wonderful production it is—"The tyrant totters, and the
senate nods."

[
Walking about.

Louisa.
To what a strange fatality of circumstances has her character
been exposed!—but vice often finds its punishment for a crime it never
committed, when it escapes for thousands it daily practises.

Flor.
Well, Miss Courtney, I hope now your apprehensions are at an
end?

Louisa.
Yes, sir, I shall remain for the short time necessary to
prepare for my journey, and beg I may detain you no longer. I'm afraid I
have already been a great intruder.

Flor.
No, you have been the occasion of more happiness than ever I
experienced. But you won't leave Bath, till you've seen my brother?

Louisa.
Oh, I have been cruelly deceived, Mr Floriville! I have
injured your brother so much, that, though I wish, I almost dread to see
him.

Flor.
Then I'll go in search of him,—and if I don't reconcile
you——Come, Mr Vapid, will you walk?

Vapid.
With all my heart.

Flor.
[
Taking him by the hand.
] By Heaven, you are an honest fellow.

Vapid.
Madam, good night!—if I can be of any service to you in the
dramatic, or any other way, you may command me.

[Pg 58]
Flor.
Ay, I'll answer for him,—he would die to serve you.

Vapid.
Die to serve her! ay, "Die all!—die nobly!—die like
demi-gods!"

[
Exeunt.

ACT THE FIFTH.

SCENE I.

Lady Waitfor't's
Apartment.

Lady Waitfor't
discovered at her Toilette.
Letty
waiting.

Lady.
Mr Vapid not come yet, Letty?

Letty.
No, ma'am,—but the servant, who found him at the tavern, said
he would be here immediately.

Lady.
I protest, I am almost weary of them all.—[
Noise without.
]
See who's there.

[
Letty
listens, and returns.

Letty.
Mr Vapid at last:—now, pray your ladyship, insist on his
explaining every thing to my lord.

Lady.
Yes; but vilely as he has treated me, I must still be calm.

Vapid
, putting his head in.

Walk in, sir, walk in.

Vapid.
No, ma'am, I'd rather stay here.

Lady.
I beg you'll be seated, Mr Vapid—I have something of
consequence to impart to you.

[Pg 59]
Enter
Vapid
, gently.

Vapid.
I'd never have ventured but in hopes of seeing my dear
Marianne.

Lady.
Indeed I will not detain you a moment.

Vapid.
Very well, ma'am, if that's the case——[
Slowly seating
himself.
] It's very alarming.

[
Aside.

Lady.
Letty, leave the room, and fasten the door.

[
Exit
Letty
.

Vapid.
No, no!—don't do that, I beseech you!

Lady.
You're very much frightened, Mr Vapid;—I hope you don't suppose
I have any design against you?

Vapid.
I don't know, really, ma'am—such things are perfectly
dramatic.

Lady.
Well, but, to release you from your fears, I'll tell you why I
have given you this trouble—My business, Mr Vapid, was to converse with
you on the farcical affair that happened at Neville's.

Vapid.
Farcical!

Lady.
Yes, sir, the farcical affair that happened at Mr Neville's.

Vapid.
Farcical?—what, my epilogue, ma'am?—I hope you don't mean to
reflect on that?

Lady.
No, sir, far from it—I have no doubt but it is a very elegant
composition.

Vapid.
Doubt!—here it is, read it!—the very first production of the
age! A regular climax of poetic beauty!—the last line the
ne plus
ultra
of genius.

Lady.
But, to be serious, Mr Vapid——

Vapid.
Why, I am serious:—and I'll tell you, lady Waitfor't, 'tis the
last line of an epilogue, and the last scene of a comedy, that always
distracts me—'tis the reconciliation of lovers—there's the
difficulty!—You find it so in real life, I dare say?

Lady.
Yes.—But Mr Vapid, this affair concerns me excessively, and I
wish to know what is to be done.

[Pg 60]
Vapid.
I'll tell you,—write a play,—and, bad as it may possibly be,
say it's a translation from the French, and interweave a few compliments
on the English, and, my life on't, it does wonders.—Do it, and say you
had the thought from me.

Lady.
Sir, do you mean to deride me?

Vapid.
No.—But only be cautious in your style—women are in general
apt to indulge that pruriency and warm luxuriancy of fancy they
possess,—but do be careful—be decent—if you are not, I have done with
you.

Lady.
Sir, I desire you'll be more respectful.—I don't understand it
at all.

[
Rising.

Enter
Marianne
.

Vapid.
Then here comes one that will explain every thing.

"There's in her all that we believe of Heaven;

Amazing brightness, purity, and truth,

Eternal joy, and everlasting love!"

My dear sweet little partner, I rejoice to see you!

Mari.
And, my dear sweet Mr Poet, I rejoice to see you!

Lady.
Provoking!—Have I not told you a thousand times, never to break
in upon me when I am alone?

Mari.
Alone, my lady! do you call Mr Vapid nobody, then?

Lady.
Suppose I should,—what is that to you?

Mari.
Then I have a wrong notion of your nobodies.—I always thought
them harmless, unmeaning things; but Mr Vapid's not so very harmless
either—are you, Mr Vapid?

Vapid.
Indeed, ma'am, I am not.

Mari.
There now,—I told you so.—Upon my word, you rely too much on
your time of life,—you do indeed. You think, because you're a little
the worse
[Pg 61]
for wear, you may trust yourself any where,—but you're
mistaken—you're not near so bad as you imagine—nay, I don't flatter,
do I, Mr Vapid?

Vapid.
Indeed, ma'am, you do not.

Lady.
Look ye, miss,—your insolence is not to be borne—you have been
the chief cause of all my perplexities.

Mari.
Nay, aunt, don't say that.

Lady.
No matter,—your behaviour is shameless, and it is high time I
exerted the authority of a relation—you are a disgrace to me—to
yourself, and your friends—therefore, I am determined to put into
execution a scheme I have long thought of.

Mari.
What is it? something pleasant I hope.

Lady.
No, you shall retire to a convent, till you take possession of
your fortune.

Mari.
A convent! Oh lord! I can't make up my mind to it, now don't,
pray don't think of it—I declare it's quite shocking.

Lady.
It is a far better place than you deserve; my resolution is
fixed, and we shall see whether a life of solitude and austerity will
not awaken some sense of shame in you.

Mari.
Indeed, I can't bear the thoughts of it.—Oh do speak to her, Mr
Vapid—tell her about the nasty monks, now do,—a convent! mercy! what a
check to the passions! Oh! I can't bear it.

[
Weeping.

Vapid.
Gad, here's a sudden touch of tragedy—pray, Lady Waitfor't,
reflect—you can't send a lady to a convent when the theatres are open.

Mari.
It will be the death of me! pray, my dear aunt——

Lady.
Not a word—I am determined—to-morrow you shall leave this
country, and then I have done with you for ever.

Mari.
Oh! my poor heart! Oh, oh!

[Pg 62]
Vapid.
See! she'll faint!

Mari.
Oh! oh! oh!

[
Marianne
faints in
Lady Waitfor't's
Arms.

Lady.
Oh! I have gone too far, Mr Vapid!

Vapid.
I fly, I'll call the servants. Have you got any drops?

Lady.
I have some drops in this closet may recover her—hold her a
moment, and for heaven's sake take care of her.

[
Exit.

[
Marianne
lays in
Vapid's
Arms.

Vapid.
Here's a situation!—Poor girl!—how I pity her! I really loved her.

Mari.
Did you really love me, Mr Vapid?

Vapid.
Hey-day! recovered!—here's incident!

Mari.
But did you really love me, Mr Vapid?

Vapid.
Yes I did,—here's stage effect!

Mari.
And would you have really run away with me, Mr Vapid?

Vapid.
Yes, I really would.

Mari.
Then come along this moment.

Vapid.
Hush!—here's the old lady! keep dying, as before, and we'll
effect the business—more equivoque!

Enter
Lady Waitfor't
.

Lady.
Well, Mr Vapid, how does she do? lord! she's in strong
convulsions.

Vapid.
Yes, ma'am, she's dying; where are the drops?

Lady.
Here, sir.

Vapid.
There are very few—are there any more of the same kind?

Lady.
Yes, plenty.

Vapid.
Fetch them,—'tis the only hope—if you have any hartshorn too,
bring a little of that.

Lady.
I'm quite shocked!

[
Exit.

Mari.
Well, Mr Vapid, now let's run away—come—why what are you
thinking of?

[Pg 63]
Vapid.
My last act, and I fear—

Mari.
What do you fear?

Vapid.
That it can't be managed—let me see—we certainly run away,
and she returns—'faith, I must see her return.

Mari.
No, no, pray let us begone, think of this another time.

Vapid.
So I will—it will do for the fourth, though not for the fifth
act,—therefore, my dear little girl, come away, and we'll live and die
together.

Mari.
Die together!

Vapid.
Ay, "Die all! die nobly! die like demi-gods!"

[
Exeunt.

Enter
Lady Waitfor't
.

Lady.
Here, Mr Vapid—here are the drops!—What, gone!—ruined by a
writer of epilogues!—Oh! I shall burst with disappointment!

[
Exit.

SCENE II.

Another Apartment in
Neville's
House—In the back Scene, Glass Doors,
with Curtains.

Enter
Louisa Courtney
.

Louisa.
Still in the same house, yet still afraid to meet him! Oh,
Neville! my superior in every thing; how can I hope for your
forgiveness? while you revealed an affection it had done you credit to
deny, I concealed a passion I might have been proud to confess.

Enter
Vapid
and
Marianne
.

Mari.
Oh! Miss Courtney! my sweet Miss Courtney! Mr Vapid, here, has
run away with me, and I am so frightened for fear of Lady Waitfor't.

[Pg 64]
Louisa.
Yes, she may well alarm you,—she has destroyed my peace for
ever! but have you seen Mr Neville? yet, why do I ask!

Vapid.
Seen Mr Neville!—What, doesn't he yet know you are in his
lodgings?

Louisa.
No, and I hope never will—the moment his brother returns, I
shall set out for my uncle's, and perhaps never see him more.

Vapid.
And why not see him, ma'am?

Louisa.
Because I cannot bear the sight of one I have so injured.

Vapid.
This'll do—mutual equivoque! equal misunderstanding! my own
case exactly!

Mari.
Your own case! Lord! you base man, have you got a young lady in
your lodgings?

Vapid.
Ridiculous! don't talk about young ladies at such an awful—the
very situation in my comedy! the last scene to a syllable!—here's an
opportunity of improving the denouement!

Enter
Peter
.

Peter.
Ma'am, my master is returned—the occasion of his delay has
been a long interview with Mr Willoughby,—he doesn't know you are here.

Louisa.
Marianne, excuse me—you'll be safe from Lady Waitfor't
here—indeed I'm very ill.

Mari.
Nay—where are you going?

Louisa.
Alas! any where to avoid him—farewell! and may you enjoy that
happiness I have for ever lost!

[
Exit.

Mari.
Poor dear girl! I mustn't leave her thus—Mr Vapid, we won't run
away till something is done for her.

Vapid.
Go,—there's a good girl—follow her, and comfort her.

Mari.
I will—Lord! if they must be happy in being friends again, what
must I be who make them so!

[
Exit.

[Pg 65]
Vapid.
The picture before me! all from nature,—I must heighten his
distress, for contrast is every thing—Peter, not a word for your life.

Enter
Neville
.

Nev.
Vapid, I am glad to see you—any letter from my brother?

[
To
Peter
.

Peter.
None, sir.

Nev.
Nor message?

Peter.
No, sir.

Nev.
Then I need doubt no longer—'tis evident he avoids me—cruel,
ungenerous Floriville!—

[
Seats himself.

Vapid.
[
Leaning over his Chair.
] Miss Courtney will never see you
again.

Nev.
I know it—too well I know it—that, and that alone, makes me
determined to leave this country for ever.

Vapid.
You are unhappy then?

Nev.
Completely so.

Vapid.
Then stop.—[
Sits by him.
] She was an angel, Harry.

Nev.
Ay, a divinity!

Vapid.
And then to lose her!

Nev.
[
Rising.
] 'Sdeath!—don't torment me!—my griefs are already
beyond bearing.

Vapid.
It will do—he's as unhappy as I could wish.

Peter.
I can hold no longer—sir!

Vapid.
Hush!—you d—d dog, you'll ruin the catastrophe.

Peter.
I don't care—I'll tell him every thing—sir!—Mr Neville!

Vapid.
You villain!—Do you ever go to a play?—did you ever sit in
the gallery?

Peter.
Yes, sir, sometimes.

Vapid.
Then know this is all for your good——you'll applaud it some
day or other, you dog—curse it,
[Pg 66]
won't he have happiness enough bye and
bye?—-What—you are going abroad, Neville?

Nev.
Yes, for ever.—Farewell, Vapid.

Vapid.
Farewell, Neville—good night——Now for the effect!—Miss
Courtney is in the next room.

Nev.
What!

Vapid.
Miss Courtney is in the next room.

Nev.
Louisa! is it possible?

Vapid.
There's light and shade!—Yes, your brother brought her here,
and she expects him to return every moment.

Nev.
My brother! then 'tis he means to marry her—nay, perhaps they
are already married—Heavens! I shall go wild!

Vapid.
Don't, don't go wild—that will ruin the denouement.

Nev.
No matter—I am resolved—I'll bid her farewell for ever—Vapid,
'tis the last favour I shall ask of you—give her this, [
A Letter.
]
and tell her, since I have resented Willoughby's attack on her honour, I
think I may be allowed to vindicate my own; tell her, great as have been
my faults, my truth has still been greater, and wherever I wander—

Vapid.
Here's a flourish, now!—why you misunderstand—she is not
married, nor going to be married.

Nev.
Come, this is no time for raillery.

Vapid.
Raillery!—why, I'm serious—serious as the fifth act—she is
now weeping on your account.

Nev.
Pr'ythee leave fooling, it will produce no effect, believe me.

Vapid.
Won't it? it will produce a very great effect though, believe
me. Zounds! go to her—preserve the unity of action,—marry her
directly, and if the catastrophe does not conclude with spirit, damn my
comedy—damn my comedy—that's all, damn my comedy.

[Pg 67]
Nev.
'Would to Heaven you were in earnest!

Vapid.
Earnest! why there it is now! the women, dear creatures, are
always ready enough to produce effect—but the men are so curst
undramatic.—Go to her, I tell you, go to her.

[
Exit
Neville
.—
Vapid
stands aside.

Enter
Lord Scratch
and
Floriville
.

Lord.
That curst dramatic maniac,—if I see him again——

Flor.
My dear uncle, consent to Harry's marriage, and depend on it he
shall trouble you no more.

Lord.
I tell you again, sir, I will not.

Flor.
Will you give any hopes of future consent?

Lord.
By the word of a peer, I will not.

[
Vapid
, coming forward, touching
Lord Scratch
on the Shoulder, and
writing in common-place book.

Vapid.
Master Brook, let me persuade you.

Lord.
Flames and firebrands, the fiend again!

Vapid.
Give consent, and I'll give Neville a fortune—he shall have
the entire profit of the different plays in which I intend to have the
honour of introducing yourself and the old Lady Hurlothrumbo.

Lord.
Oh, that I was not a peer! if I was any thing else—but, thank
Heaven, Louisa is more averse to the match than myself.

Vapid.
Is she?

Lord.
Yes, she knows his falsehood, and despises him.

Vapid.
What, you are confident of it?

Lord.
Out of my way, sir,—I'll not answer you,—I'll go take her to
town directly.—Out of my way, sir.

Vapid.
Stop—you're wrong, Master Brook—she's in that room.

Lord.
Where?—behind me?

[Pg 68]
Vapid.
Yes—there—there! [
Pointing.
] Now for it!—what an effect!

[
Lord S.
opens the Glass Doors, and discovers
Neville
kneeling to

Louisa
.
Marianne
with them.

Vapid.
There, Peter! there's catastrophe!—Shakspeare's invention
nothing!—Applaud it, you dog—clap, clap, Peter, clap!

Lord.
What are you at, you impudent rascal?—get out of the room.

[
Exit
Peter
.

Vapid.
I should set this down—I may forget.

Mari.
Lord! he has a very bad memory,—I hope he won't forget our
marriage.

Nev.
Oh! Louisa, what am I to think?

Louisa.
That I have wronged thee, Neville!

[
Embracing.

Flor.
My dear Harry, let this be my apology for not having seen you
before. [
Giving him a Paper.
] Miss Courtney, ten thousand joys;—could
I have found my brother, you should have seen him sooner.

Nev.
Why, here is a deed of gift of half your estate!

Flor.
I know it, but say nothing. When you gave me money, five years
ago, did I say any thing?—no, I forgot it as soon as it was over; and
should never have recollected, at this moment, but for my lord's
inhumanity.—Uncle, I thank you,—you have made me the happiest man
alive.

Lord.
Don't perplex me;—what a compound of folly and generosity!

Mari.
Uncle-in-law, what are your feelings on this occasion?—as my
aunt says.

Lord.
Feelings!—I never knew a peer had any.

Mari.
Didn't you?

Lord.
No; but now I find the contrary: I begin to think I've a heart
like other men. It's better to atone for an error, than persist in
one—therefore give me
[Pg 69]
that deed, Neville——there, sir, [
Giving it to

Floriville
.
] do you think nobody has estates but yourself?—Louisa and
her fortune are your own, Neville; and after my death, you shall have
all mine:—and now there's a cursed burden off my mind.

Mari.
Now, you're a dear creature! and I won't marry,—that's what I
won't, without consulting you.

Lord.
You marry! why, who should you marry?—And pray, how came you
here?

Mari.
A gentleman run away with me;—he is now in the room.

Lord.
In the room! what, Floriville?

Mari.
No, behind you.

[
Pointing to
Vapid
, who is writing at a Table.

Lord.
Ghosts and spectres! my evil genius!

Mari.
Come, my dear, haven't you almost finished?

[
Vapid
rises.

Vapid.
Yes, the denouement is complete, and now, Mrs Vapid, I resign
myself to love and you.

Mari.
Come, give consent, my lord,—my husband will get money, though
I have none.

Lord.
None!—I dare say he can tell you, you will have twelve thousand
pounds in less than a year.

Vapid.
That's a new incident!

Mari.
Shall I? then 'faith, Mr Vapid, we'll build a theatre of our
own! you shall write plays, and I'll act them.

Enter
Ennui
.

Ennui.
I've an idea—I give you joy, Neville.—I mean to kill time, by
living single; and, therefore, I hope, the lady and the borough may be
yours.

Mari.
Mr Ennui, I hope you'll forgive me, and Sir Harry Hustle, the
fatigue we occasioned you?

Ennui.
Yaw, aw—don't mention it.—The very recollection makes me
faint.—In fact—my lord, I just
[Pg 70]
met one of Lady Waitfor't's servants,
who tells me she has left Bath in a rage.

Flor.
I am afraid she has escaped too easily.

Lord.
Oh, never think of her! I can answer for her punishment being
adequate to her crimes—Willoughby has told me all her schemes,—and if
ever I hear her name again, may I lose my peerage, and dress like a
gentleman.

Ennui.
My lord—I've an idea—

Vapid.
Sir, I beg your pardon; but really, if you have an idea, I will
trouble you to spare it me for my comedy.

Ennui.
In fact—I don't comprehend. I have read your "die-all"
epilogue, and—

Vapid.
Oh, then I don't wonder at your having ideas!

Lord.
Oh, poor fellow! he's always talking about what he never
has.—Neville, my boy, may you be as happy as I am.

Flor.
Ay, I'll answer for his happiness by my own.—Miss Courtney,
notwithstanding my brother, I will "still live in your eye,—die in your
lap—and be buried in your heart:" and, moreover, I will stay with you
both in England.

Louisa.
Yes, Floriville, if you would behold pure, unsullied love,
never travel out of this country. Depend on't,

No foreign climes such high examples prove,

Of wedded pleasure, or connubial love.

Long in this land have joys domestic grown,

Nursed in the cottage—cherish'd on the throne.

all" in the line "in the middle of my composition?—Die all, die nobly";
and missing brackets were added before the stage directions beginning
"As he is going to sign" and the final "Exeunt".

Vapid.
" was added before the line beginning
"Here's a situation!"

In the advertisements, a missing comma was added after "West Indian".

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

http://www.gutenberg.org/license)
.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License.  You must require such a user to return or
destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

(Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

The Workshop

With a single drop of ink for a mirror, the Egyptian sorcerer undertakes to
reveal to any chance comer far-reaching visions of the past. This is what I
undertake to do for you, reader. With this drop of ink at the end of my pen, I
will show you the roomy workshop of Mr. Jonathan Burge, carpenter and builder,
in the village of Hayslope, as it appeared on the eighteenth of June, in the
year of our Lord 1799.

The afternoon sun was warm on the five workmen there, busy upon doors and
window-frames and wainscoting. A scent of pine-wood from a tentlike pile of
planks outside the open door mingled itself with the scent of the elder-bushes
which were spreading their summer snow close to the open window opposite; the
slanting sunbeams shone through the transparent shavings that flew before the
steady plane, and lit up the fine grain of the oak panelling which stood
propped against the wall. On a heap of those soft shavings a rough, grey
shepherd dog had made himself a pleasant bed, and was lying with his nose
between his fore-paws, occasionally wrinkling his brows to cast a glance at the
tallest of the five workmen, who was carving a shield in the centre of a wooden
mantelpiece. It was to this workman that the strong barytone belonged which was
heard above the sound of plane and hammer singingâ

Awake, my soul, and with the sun

Thy daily stage of duty run;

Shake off dull sloth...

Here some measurement was to be taken which required more concentrated
attention, and the sonorous voice subsided into a low whistle; but it presently
broke out again with renewed vigourâ

Let all thy converse be sincere,

Thy conscience as the noonday clear.

Such a voice could only come from a broad chest, and the broad chest belonged
to a large-boned, muscular man nearly six feet high, with a back so flat and a
head so well poised that when he drew himself up to take a more distant survey
of his work, he had the air of a soldier standing at ease. The sleeve rolled up
above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of
strength; yet the long supple hand, with its broad finger-tips, looked ready
for works of skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and
justified his name; but the jet-black hair, made the more noticeable by its
contrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance of the dark eyes that
shone from under strongly marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows, indicated a
mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly hewn, and when in
repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression of
good-humoured honest intelligence.

It is clear at a glance that the next workman is Adamâs brother. He is nearly
as tall; he has the same type of features, the same hue of hair and complexion;
but the strength of the family likeness seems only to render more conspicuous
the remarkable difference of expression both in form and face. Sethâs broad
shoulders have a slight stoop; his eyes are grey; his eyebrows have less
prominence and more repose than his brotherâs; and his glance, instead of being
keen, is confiding and benign. He has thrown off his paper cap, and you see
that his hair is not thick and straight, like Adamâs, but thin and wavy,
allowing you to discern the exact contour of a coronal arch that predominates
very decidedly over the brow.

The idle tramps always felt sure they could get a copper from Seth; they
scarcely ever spoke to Adam.

The concert of the tools and Adamâs voice was at last broken by Seth, who,
lifting the door at which he had been working intently, placed it against the
wall, and said, âThere! Iâve finished my door to-day, anyhow.â

The workmen all looked up; Jim Salt, a burly, red-haired man known as Sandy
Jim, paused from his planing, and Adam said to Seth, with a sharp glance of
surprise, âWhat! Dost think theeâst finished the door?â

âAye, sure,â said Seth, with answering surprise; âwhatâs awanting toât?â

A loud roar of laughter from the other three workmen made Seth look round
confusedly. Adam did not join in the laughter, but there was a slight smile on
his face as he said, in a gentler tone than before, âWhy, theeâst forgot the
panels.â

The laughter burst out afresh as Seth clapped his hands to his head, and
coloured over brow and crown.

âHoorray!â shouted a small lithe fellow called Wiry Ben, running forward and
seizing the door. âWeâll hang up thâ door at fur end oâ thâ shop anâ write onât
âSeth Bede, the Methody, his work.â Here, Jim, lendâs hould oâ thâ red pot.â

âNonsense!â said Adam. âLet it alone, Ben Cranage. Youâll mayhap be making such
a slip yourself some day; youâll laugh oâ thâ other side oâ your mouth then.â

âCatch me at it, Adam. Itâll be a good while afore my headâs full oâ thâ
Methodies,â said Ben.

âNay, but itâs often full oâ drink, and thatâs worse.â

Ben, however, had now got the âred potâ in his hand, and was about to begin
writing his inscription, making, by way of preliminary, an imaginary S in the
air.

âLet it alone, will you?â Adam called out, laying down his tools, striding up
to Ben, and seizing his right shoulder. âLet it alone, or Iâll shake the soul
out oâ your body.â

Ben shook in Adamâs iron grasp, but, like a plucky small man as he was, he
didnât mean to give in. With his left hand he snatched the brush from his
powerless right, and made a movement as if he would perform the feat of writing
with his left. In a moment Adam turned him round, seized his other shoulder,
and, pushing him along, pinned him against the wall. But now Seth spoke.

âLet be, Addy, let be. Ben will be joking. Why, heâs iâ the right to laugh at
meâI canna help laughing at myself.â

âI shanât loose him till he promises to let the door alone,â said Adam.

âCome, Ben, lad,â said Seth, in a persuasive tone, âdonât letâs have a quarrel
about it. You know Adam will have his way. You mayâs well try to turn a waggon
in a narrow lane. Say youâll leave the door alone, and make an end onât.â

âI binna frighted at Adam,â said Ben, âbut I donna mind sayinâ as Iâll let ât
alone at your askinâ, Seth.â

âCome, thatâs wise of you, Ben,â said Adam, laughing and relaxing his grasp.

They all returned to their work now; but Wiry Ben, having had the worst in the
bodily contest, was bent on retrieving that humiliation by a success in
sarcasm.

âWhich was ye thinkinâ on, Seth,â he beganââthe pretty parsonâs face or her
sarmunt, when ye forgot the panels?â

âCome and hear her, Ben,â said Seth, good-humouredly; âsheâs going to preach on
the Green to-night; happen yeâd get something to think on yourself then,
instead oâ those wicked songs youâre so fond on. Ye might get religion, and
that âud be the best dayâs earnings yâ ever made.â

âAll iâ good time for that, Seth; Iâll think about that when Iâm a-goinâ to
settle iâ life; bachelors doesnât want such heavy earninâs. Happen I shall do
the coortinâ anâ the religion both together, as
ye
do, Seth; but ye
wouldna haâ me get converted anâ chop in atween ye anâ the pretty preacher, anâ
carry her aff?â

âNo fear oâ that, Ben; sheâs neither for you nor for me to win, I doubt. Only
you come and hear her, and you wonât speak lightly on her again.â

âWell, Iâm half a mind tâ haâ a look at her to-night, if there isnât good
company at thâ Holly Bush. Whatâll she take for her text? Happen ye can tell
me, Seth, if so be as I shouldna come up iâ time forât. Willât beâwhat come ye
out for to see? A prophetess? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophetessâa
uncommon pretty young woman.â

âCome, Ben,â said Adam, rather sternly, âyou let the words oâ the Bible alone;
youâre going too far now.â

âWhat! Are
ye
a-turninâ rounâ, Adam? I thought ye war dead again thâ
women preachinâ, a while agoo?â

âNay, Iâm not turninâ noway. I said nought about the women preachinâ. I said,
You let the Bible alone: youâve got a jest-book, hanât you, as youâre rare and
proud on? Keep your dirty fingers to that.â

âWhy, yâ are gettinâ as big a saint as Seth. Yâ are goinâ to thâ preachinâ
to-night, I should think. Yeâll do finely tâ lead the singinâ. But I donâ know
what Parson Irwine âull say at his granâ favright Adam Bede a-turninâ Methody.â

âNever do you bother yourself about me, Ben. Iâm not a-going to turn Methodist
any more nor you areâthough itâs like enough youâll turn to something worse.
Mester Irwineâs got more sense nor to meddle wiâ peopleâs doing as they like in
religion. Thatâs between themselves and God, as heâs said to me many a time.â

âAye, aye; but heâs none so fond oâ your dissenters, for all that.â

âMaybe; Iâm none so fond oâ Josh Todâs thick ale, but I donât hinder you from
making a fool oâ yourself wiât.â

There was a laugh at this thrust of Adamâs, but Seth said, very seriously.
âNay, nay, Addy, thee mustna say as anybodyâs religionâs like thick ale. Thee
dostna believe but what the dissenters and the Methodists have got the root oâ
the matter as well as the church folks.â

âNay, Seth, lad; Iâm not for laughing at no manâs religion. Let âem follow
their consciences, thatâs all. Only I think it âud be better if their
consciences âud let âem stay quiet iâ the churchâthereâs a deal to be learnt
there. And thereâs such a thing as being oversperitial; we must have something
beside Gospel iâ this world. Look at the canals, anâ thâ aqueducâs, anâ thâ
coal-pit engines, and Arkwrightâs mills there at Cromford; a man must learn
summat beside Gospel to make them things, I reckon. But tâ hear some oâ them
preachers, youâd think as a man must be doing nothing allâs life but shuttingâs
eyes and looking whatâs agoing on inside him. I know a man must have the love
oâ God in his soul, and the Bibleâs Godâs word. But what does the Bible say?
Why, it says as God put his sperrit into the workman as built the tabernacle,
to make him do all the carved work and things as wanted a nice hand. And this
is my way oâ looking at it: thereâs the sperrit oâ God in all things and all
timesâweekday as well as Sundayâand iâ the great works and inventions, and iâ
the figuring and the mechanics. And God helps us with our headpieces and our
hands as well as with our souls; and if a man does bits oâ jobs out oâ working
hoursâbuilds a oven for âs wife to save her from going to the bakehouse, or
scrats at his bit oâ garden and makes two potatoes grow istead oâ one, heâs
doinâ more good, and heâs just as near to God, as if he was running after some
preacher and a-praying and a-groaning.â

âWell done, Adam!â said Sandy Jim, who had paused from his planing to shift his
planks while Adam was speaking; âthatâs the best sarmunt Iâve heared this long
while. By thâ same token, my wifeâs been a-plaguinâ on me to build her a oven
this twelvemont.â

âThereâs reason in what thee sayâst, Adam,â observed Seth, gravely. âBut thee
knowâst thyself as itâs hearing the preachers thee findâst so much fault with
has turned many an idle fellow into an industrious un. Itâs the preacher as
empties thâ alehouse; and if a man gets religion, heâll do his work none the
worse for that.â

âOnây heâll lave the panels out oâ thâ doors sometimes, eh, Seth?â said Wiry
Ben.

âAh, Ben, youâve got a joke againâ me as âll last you your life. But it isna
religion as was iâ fault there; it was Seth Bede, as was allays a
wool-gathering chap, and religion hasna cured him, the moreâs the pity.â

âNeâer heed me, Seth,â said Wiry Ben, âyâ are a down-right good-hearted chap,
panels or no panels; anâ ye donna set up your bristles at every bit oâ fun,
like some oâ your kin, as is mayhap cliverer.â

âSeth, lad,â said Adam, taking no notice of the sarcasm against himself, âthee
mustna take me unkind. I wasna driving at thee in what I said just now. Some âs
got one way oâ looking at things and some âs got another.â

âNay, nay, Addy, thee meanâst me no unkindness,â said Seth, âI know that well
enough. Theeât like thy dog Gypâthee barkâst at me sometimes, but thee allays
lickâst my hand after.â

All hands worked on in silence for some minutes, until the church clock began
to strike six. Before the first stroke had died away, Sandy Jim had loosed his
plane and was reaching his jacket; Wiry Ben had left a screw half driven in,
and thrown his screwdriver into his tool-basket; Mum Taft, who, true to his
name, had kept silence throughout the previous conversation, had flung down his
hammer as he was in the act of lifting it; and Seth, too, had straightened his
back, and was putting out his hand towards his paper cap. Adam alone had gone
on with his work as if nothing had happened. But observing the cessation of the
tools, he looked up, and said, in a tone of indignation, âLook there, now! I
canât abide to see men throw away their tools iâ that way, the minute the clock
begins to strike, as if they took no pleasure iâ their work and was afraid oâ
doing a stroke too much.â

Seth looked a little conscious, and began to be slower in his preparations for
going, but Mum Taft broke silence, and said, âAye, aye, Adam lad, ye talk like
a young un. When yâ are six-anâ-forty like me, istid oâ six-anâ-twenty, ye
wonna be so flush oâ workinâ for nought.â

âNonsense,â said Adam, still wrathful; âwhatâs age got to do with it, I wonder?
Ye arena getting stiff yet, I reckon. I hate to see a manâs arms drop down as
if he was shot, before the clockâs fairly struck, just as if heâd never a bit
oâ pride and delight in âs work. The very grindstone âull go on turning a bit
after you loose it.â

âBodderation, Adam!â exclaimed Wiry Ben; âlave a chap aloon, will âee? Ye war
afinding faut wiâ preachers a while agooâyâ are fond enough oâ preachinâ
yoursen. Ye may like work better nor play, but I like play better nor work;
thatâll âcommodate yeâit laves ye thâ more to do.â

With this exit speech, which he considered effective, Wiry Ben shouldered his
basket and left the workshop, quickly followed by Mum Taft and Sandy Jim. Seth
lingered, and looked wistfully at Adam, as if he expected him to say something.

âShalt go home before thee goâst to the preaching?â Adam asked, looking up.

âNay; Iâve got my hat and things at Will Maskeryâs. I shanât be home before
going for ten. Iâll happen see Dinah Morris safe home, if sheâs willing.
Thereâs nobody comes with her from Poyserâs, thee knowâst.â

âThen Iâll tell mother not to look for thee,â said Adam.

âThee artna going to Poyserâs thyself to-night?â said Seth rather timidly, as
he turned to leave the workshop.

âNay, Iâm going to thâ school.â

Hitherto Gyp had kept his comfortable bed, only lifting up his head and
watching Adam more closely as he noticed the other workmen departing. But no
sooner did Adam put his ruler in his pocket, and begin to twist his apron round
his waist, than Gyp ran forward and looked up in his masterâs face with patient
expectation. If Gyp had had a tail he would doubtless have wagged it, but being
destitute of that vehicle for his emotions, he was like many other worthy
personages, destined to appear more phlegmatic than nature had made him.

âWhat! Art ready for the basket, eh, Gyp?â said Adam, with the same gentle
modulation of voice as when he spoke to Seth.

Gyp jumped and gave a short bark, as much as to say, âOf course.â Poor fellow,
he had not a great range of expression.

The basket was the one which on workdays held Adamâs and Sethâs dinner; and no
official, walking in procession, could look more resolutely unconscious of all
acquaintances than Gyp with his basket, trotting at his masterâs heels.

On leaving the workshop Adam locked the door, took the key out, and carried it
to the house on the other side of the woodyard. It was a low house, with smooth
grey thatch and buff walls, looking pleasant and mellow in the evening light.
The leaded windows were bright and speckless, and the door-stone was as clean
as a white boulder at ebb tide. On the door-stone stood a clean old woman, in a
dark-striped linen gown, a red kerchief, and a linen cap, talking to some
speckled fowls which appeared to have been drawn towards her by an illusory
expectation of cold potatoes or barley. The old womanâs sight seemed to be dim,
for she did not recognize Adam till he said, âHereâs the key, Dolly; lay it
down for me in the house, will you?â

âAye, sure; but wunna ye come in, Adam? Miss Maryâs iâ thâ house, and Mester
Burge âull be back anon; heâd be glad tâ haâ ye to supper wiâm, Iâll beâs
warrand.â

âNo, Dolly, thank you; Iâm off home. Good evening.â

Adam hastened with long strides, Gyp close to his heels, out of the workyard,
and along the highroad leading away from the village and down to the valley. As
he reached the foot of the slope, an elderly horseman, with his portmanteau
strapped behind him, stopped his horse when Adam had passed him, and turned
round to have another long look at the stalwart workman in paper cap, leather
breeches, and dark-blue worsted stockings.

Adam, unconscious of the admiration he was exciting, presently struck across
the fields, and now broke out into the tune which had all day long been running
in his head:

Let all thy converse be sincere,

Thy conscience as the noonday clear;

For Godâs all-seeing eye surveys

Thy secret thoughts, thy works and ways.

Chapter II

The Preaching

About a quarter to seven there was an unusual appearance of excitement in the
village of Hayslope, and through the whole length of its little street, from
the Donnithorne Arms to the churchyard gate, the inhabitants had evidently been
drawn out of their houses by something more than the pleasure of lounging in
the evening sunshine. The Donnithorne Arms stood at the entrance of the
village, and a small farmyard and stackyard which flanked it, indicating that
there was a pretty take of land attached to the inn, gave the traveller a
promise of good feed for himself and his horse, which might well console him
for the ignorance in which the weather-beaten sign left him as to the heraldic
bearings of that ancient family, the Donnithornes. Mr. Casson, the landlord,
had been for some time standing at the door with his hands in his pockets,
balancing himself on his heels and toes and looking towards a piece of
unenclosed ground, with a maple in the middle of it, which he knew to be the
destination of certain grave-looking men and women whom he had observed passing
at intervals.

Mr. Cassonâs person was by no means of that common type which can be allowed to
pass without description. On a front view it appeared to consist principally of
two spheres, bearing about the same relation to each other as the earth and the
moon: that is to say, the lower sphere might be said, at a rough guess, to be
thirteen times larger than the upper which naturally performed the function of
a mere satellite and tributary. But here the resemblance ceased, for Mr.
Cassonâs head was not at all a melancholy-looking satellite nor was it a
âspotty globe,â as Milton has irreverently called the moon; on the contrary, no
head and face could look more sleek and healthy, and its expressionâwhich was
chiefly confined to a pair of round and ruddy cheeks, the slight knot and
interruptions forming the nose and eyes being scarcely worth mentionâwas one of
jolly contentment, only tempered by that sense of personal dignity which
usually made itself felt in his attitude and bearing. This sense of dignity
could hardly be considered excessive in a man who had been butler to âthe
familyâ for fifteen years, and who, in his present high position, was
necessarily very much in contact with his inferiors. How to reconcile his
dignity with the satisfaction of his curiosity by walking towards the Green was
the problem that Mr. Casson had been revolving in his mind for the last five
minutes; but when he had partly solved it by taking his hands out of his
pockets, and thrusting them into the armholes of his waistcoat, by throwing his
head on one side, and providing himself with an air of contemptuous
indifference to whatever might fall under his notice, his thoughts were
diverted by the approach of the horseman whom we lately saw pausing to have
another look at our friend Adam, and who now pulled up at the door of the
Donnithorne Arms.

âTake off the bridle and give him a drink, ostler,â said the traveller to the
lad in a smock-frock, who had come out of the yard at the sound of the horseâs
hoofs.

âWhy, whatâs up in your pretty village, landlord?â he continued, getting down.
âThere seems to be quite a stir.â

âItâs a Methodisâ preaching, sir; itâs been gev hout as a young womanâs a-going
to preach on the Green,â answered Mr. Casson, in a treble and wheezy voice,
with a slightly mincing accent. âWill you please to step in, sir, anâ tek
somethink?â

âNo, I must be getting on to Rosseter. I only want a drink for my horse. And
what does your parson say, I wonder, to a young woman preaching just under his
nose?â

âParson Irwine, sir, doesnât live here; he lives at Broxâon, over the hill
there. The parsonage hereâs a tumble-down place, sir, not fit for gentry to
live in. He comes here to preach of a Sunday afternoon, sir, anâ puts up his
hoss here. Itâs a grey cob, sir, anâ he sets great store byât. Heâs allays put
up his hoss here, sir, iver since before I hed the Donnithorne Arms. Iâm not
this countryman, you may tell by my tongue, sir. Theyâre curâous talkers iâ
this country, sir; the gentryâs hard work to hunderstand âem. I was brought hup
among the gentry, sir, anâ got the turn oâ their tongue when I was a bye. Why,
what do you think the folks here says for âhevnât you?ââthe gentry, you know,
says, âhevnât youââwell, the people about here says âhanna yey.â Itâs what they
call the dileck as is spoke hereabout, sir. Thatâs what Iâve heared Squire
Donnithorne say many a time; itâs the dileck, says he.â

âAye, aye,â said the stranger, smiling. âI know it very well. But youâve not
got many Methodists about here, surelyâin this agricultural spot? I should have
thought there would hardly be such a thing as a Methodist to be found about
here. Youâre all farmers, arenât you? The Methodists can seldom lay much hold
on
them
.â

âWhy, sir, thereâs a pretty lot oâ workmen round about, sir. Thereâs Mester
Burge as owns the timber-yard over there, he underteks a good bit oâ building
anâ repairs. Anâ thereâs the stone-pits not far off. Thereâs plenty of emply iâ
this countryside, sir. Anâ thereâs a fine batch oâ Methodisses at
Treddlesâonâthatâs the market town about three mile offâyouâll maybe haâ come
through it, sir. Thereâs pretty nigh a score of âem on the Green now, as come
from there. Thatâs where our people gets it from, though thereâs only two men
of âem in all Hayslope: thatâs Will Maskery, the wheelwright, and Seth Bede, a
young man as works at the carpenterinâ.â

âThe preacher comes from Treddleston, then, does she?â

âNay, sir, she comes out oâ Stonyshire, pretty nigh thirty mile off. But sheâs
a-visitinâ hereabout at Mester Poyserâs at the Hall Farmâitâs them barns anâ
big walnut-trees, right away to the left, sir. Sheâs own niece to Poyserâs
wife, anâ theyâll be fine anâ vexed at her for making a fool of herself iâ that
way. But Iâve heared as thereâs no holding these Methodisses when the maggitâs
once got iâ their head: many of âem goes stark starinâ mad wiâ their religion.
Though this young womanâs quiet enough to look at, by what I can make out; Iâve
not seen her myself.â

âWell, I wish I had time to wait and see her, but I must get on. Iâve been out
of my way for the last twenty minutes to have a look at that place in the
valley. Itâs Squire Donnithorneâs, I suppose?â

âYes, sir, thatâs Donnithorne Chase, that is. Fine hoaks there, isnât there,
sir? I should know what it is, sir, for Iâve lived butler there a-going iâ
fifteen year. Itâs Captain Donnithorne as is thâ heir, sirâSquire Donnithorneâs
grandson. Heâll be cominâ of hage this âay-âarvest, sir, anâ we shall hev fine
doinâs. He owns all the land about here, sir, Squire Donnithorne does.â

âWell, itâs a pretty spot, whoever may own it,â said the traveller, mounting
his horse; âand one meets some fine strapping fellows about too. I met as fine
a young fellow as ever I saw in my life, about half an hour ago, before I came
up the hillâa carpenter, a tall, broad-shouldered fellow with black hair and
black eyes, marching along like a soldier. We want such fellows as he to lick
the French.â

âAye, sir, thatâs Adam Bede, that is, Iâll be boundâThias Bedeâs son everybody
knows him hereabout. Heâs an uncommon clever stiddy fellow, anâ wonderful
strong. Lord bless you, sirâif youâll hexcuse me for saying soâhe can walk
forty mile a-day, anâ lift a matter oâ sixty stonâ. Heâs an uncommon favourite
wiâ the gentry, sir: Captain Donnithorne and Parson Irwine meks a fine fuss wiâ
him. But heâs a little lifted up anâ peppery-like.â

âWell, good evening to you, landlord; I must get on.â

âYour servant, sir; good eveninâ.â

The traveller put his horse into a quick walk up the village, but when he
approached the Green, the beauty of the view that lay on his right hand, the
singular contrast presented by the groups of villagers with the knot of
Methodists near the maple, and perhaps yet more, curiosity to see the young
female preacher, proved too much for his anxiety to get to the end of his
journey, and he paused.

The Green lay at the extremity of the village, and from it the road branched
off in two directions, one leading farther up the hill by the church, and the
other winding gently down towards the valley. On the side of the Green that led
towards the church, the broken line of thatched cottages was continued nearly
to the churchyard gate; but on the opposite northwestern side, there was
nothing to obstruct the view of gently swelling meadow, and wooded valley, and
dark masses of distant hill. That rich undulating district of Loamshire to
which Hayslope belonged lies close to a grim outskirt of Stonyshire, overlooked
by its barren hills as a pretty blooming sister may sometimes be seen linked in
the arm of a rugged, tall, swarthy brother; and in two or three hoursâ ride the
traveller might exchange a bleak treeless region, intersected by lines of cold
grey stone, for one where his road wound under the shelter of woods, or up
swelling hills, muffled with hedgerows and long meadow-grass and thick corn;
and where at every turn he came upon some fine old country-seat nestled in the
valley or crowning the slope, some homestead with its long length of barn and
its cluster of golden ricks, some grey steeple looking out from a pretty
confusion of trees and thatch and dark-red tiles. It was just such a picture as
this last that Hayslope Church had made to the traveller as he began to mount
the gentle slope leading to its pleasant uplands, and now from his station near
the Green he had before him in one view nearly all the other typical features
of this pleasant land. High up against the horizon were the huge conical masses
of hill, like giant mounds intended to fortify this region of corn and grass
against the keen and hungry winds of the north; not distant enough to be
clothed in purple mystery, but with sombre greenish sides visibly specked with
sheep, whose motion was only revealed by memory, not detected by sight; wooed
from day to day by the changing hours, but responding with no change in
themselvesâleft for ever grim and sullen after the flush of morning, the winged
gleams of the April noonday, the parting crimson glory of the ripening summer
sun. And directly below them the eye rested on a more advanced line of hanging
woods, divided by bright patches of pasture or furrowed crops, and not yet
deepened into the uniform leafy curtains of high summer, but still showing the
warm tints of the young oak and the tender green of the ash and lime. Then came
the valley, where the woods grew thicker, as if they had rolled down and
hurried together from the patches left smooth on the slope, that they might
take the better care of the tall mansion which lifted its parapets and sent its
faint blue summer smoke among them. Doubtless there was a large sweep of park
and a broad glassy pool in front of that mansion, but the swelling slope of
meadow would not let our traveller see them from the village green. He saw
instead a foreground which was just as lovelyâthe level sunlight lying like
transparent gold among the gently curving stems of the feathered grass and the
tall red sorrel, and the white ambels of the hemlocks lining the bushy
hedgerows. It was that moment in summer when the sound of the scythe being
whetted makes us cast more lingering looks at the flower-sprinkled tresses of
the meadows.

He might have seen other beauties in the landscape if he had turned a little in
his saddle and looked eastward, beyond Jonathan Burgeâs pasture and woodyard
towards the green corn-fields and walnut-trees of the Hall Farm; but apparently
there was more interest for him in the living groups close at hand. Every
generation in the village was there, from old âFeyther Taftâ in his brown
worsted night-cap, who was bent nearly double, but seemed tough enough to keep
on his legs a long while, leaning on his short stick, down to the babies with
their little round heads lolling forward in quilted linen caps. Now and then
there was a new arrival; perhaps a slouching labourer, who, having eaten his
supper, came out to look at the unusual scene with a slow bovine gaze, willing
to hear what any one had to say in explanation of it, but by no means excited
enough to ask a question. But all took care not to join the Methodists on the
Green, and identify themselves in that way with the expectant audience, for
there was not one of them that would not have disclaimed the imputation of
having come out to hear the âpreacher womanââthey had only come out to see
âwhat war a-goinâ on, like.â The men were chiefly gathered in the neighbourhood
of the blacksmithâs shop. But do not imagine them gathered in a knot. Villagers
never swarm: a whisper is unknown among them, and they seem almost as incapable
of an undertone as a cow or a stag. Your true rustic turns his back on his
interlocutor, throwing a question over his shoulder as if he meant to run away
from the answer, and walking a step or two farther off when the interest of the
dialogue culminates. So the group in the vicinity of the blacksmithâs door was
by no means a close one, and formed no screen in front of Chad Cranage, the
blacksmith himself, who stood with his black brawny arms folded, leaning
against the door-post, and occasionally sending forth a bellowing laugh at his
own jokes, giving them a marked preference over the sarcasms of Wiry Ben, who
had renounced the pleasures of the Holly Bush for the sake of seeing life under
a new form. But both styles of wit were treated with equal contempt by Mr.
Joshua Rann. Mr. Rannâs leathern apron and subdued griminess can leave no one
in any doubt that he is the village shoemaker; the thrusting out of his chin
and stomach and the twirling of his thumbs are more subtle indications,
intended to prepare unwary strangers for the discovery that they are in the
presence of the parish clerk. âOld Joshway,â as he is irreverently called by
his neighbours, is in a state of simmering indignation; but he has not yet
opened his lips except to say, in a resounding bass undertone, like the tuning
of a violoncello, âSehon, King of the Amorites; for His mercy endureth for
ever; and Og the King of Basan: for His mercy endureth for everââa quotation
which may seem to have slight bearing on the present occasion, but, as with
every other anomaly, adequate knowledge will show it to be a natural sequence.
Mr. Rann was inwardly maintaining the dignity of the Church in the face of this
scandalous irruption of Methodism, and as that dignity was bound up with his
own sonorous utterance of the responses, his argument naturally suggested a
quotation from the psalm he had read the last Sunday afternoon.

The stronger curiosity of the women had drawn them quite to the edge of the
Green, where they could examine more closely the Quakerlike costume and odd
deportment of the female Methodists. Underneath the maple there was a small
cart, which had been brought from the wheelwrightâs to serve as a pulpit, and
round this a couple of benches and a few chairs had been placed. Some of the
Methodists were resting on these, with their eyes closed, as if wrapt in prayer
or meditation. Others chose to continue standing, and had turned their faces
towards the villagers with a look of melancholy compassion, which was highly
amusing to Bessy Cranage, the blacksmithâs buxom daughter, known to her
neighbours as Chadâs Bess, who wondered âwhy the folks war amakinâ faces a
thatâns.â Chadâs Bess was the object of peculiar compassion, because her hair,
being turned back under a cap which was set at the top of her head, exposed to
view an ornament of which she was much prouder than of her red cheeksânamely, a
pair of large round ear-rings with false garnets in them, ornaments condemned
not only by the Methodists, but by her own cousin and namesake Timothyâs Bess,
who, with much cousinly feeling, often wished âthem ear-ringsâ might come to
good.

Timothyâs Bess, though retaining her maiden appellation among her familiars,
had long been the wife of Sandy Jim, and possessed a handsome set of matronly
jewels, of which it is enough to mention the heavy baby she was rocking in her
arms, and the sturdy fellow of five in knee-breeches, and red legs, who had a
rusty milk-can round his neck by way of drum, and was very carefully avoided by
Chadâs small terrier. This young olive-branch, notorious under the name of
Timothyâs Bessâs Ben, being of an inquiring disposition, unchecked by any false
modesty, had advanced beyond the group of women and children, and was walking
round the Methodists, looking up in their faces with his mouth wide open, and
beating his stick against the milk-can by way of musical accompaniment. But one
of the elderly women bending down to take him by the shoulder, with an air of
grave remonstrance, Timothyâs Bessâs Ben first kicked out vigorously, then took
to his heels and sought refuge behind his fatherâs legs.

âYe gallows young dog,â said Sandy Jim, with some paternal pride, âif ye donna
keep that stick quiet, Iâll tek it from ye. What dyâe mane by kickinâ foulks?â

âHere! Gie him here to me, Jim,â said Chad Cranage; âIâll tie hirs up anâ shoe
him as I do thâ hosses. Well, Mester Casson,â he continued, as that personage
sauntered up towards the group of men, âhow are ye tâ naight? Are ye coom tâ
help groon? They say folks allays groon when theyâre hearkeninâ to thâ
Methodys, as if they war bad iâ thâ inside. I mane to groon as loud as your cow
did thâ other naight, anâ then the praicher âull think Iâm iâ thâ raight way.â

âIâd advise you not to be up to no nonsense, Chad,â said Mr. Casson, with some
dignity; âPoyser wouldnât like to hear as his wifeâs niece was treated any ways
disrespectful, for all he maynât be fond of her taking on herself to preach.â

âAye, anâ sheâs a pleasant-looked un too,â said Wiry Ben. âIâll stick up for
the pretty women preachinâ; I know theyâd persuade me over a deal sooner nor
thâ ugly men. I shouldna wonder if I turn Methody afore the nightâs out, anâ
begin to coort the preacher, like Seth Bede.â

âWhy, Sethâs looking rether too high, I should think,â said Mr. Casson. âThis
womanâs kin wouldnât like her to demean herself to a common carpenter.â

âTchu!â said Ben, with a long treble intonation, âwhatâs folksâs kin got to do
wiât? Not a chip. Poyserâs wife may turn her nose up anâ forget bygones, but
this Dinah Morris, they tell me, âs as poor as iver she wasâworks at a mill,
anâs much ado to keep hersen. A strappinâ young carpenter as is a ready-made
Methody, like Seth, wouldna be a bad match for her. Why, Poysers make as big a
fuss wiâ Adam Bede as if he war a nevvy oâ their own.â

âIdle talk! idle talk!â said Mr. Joshua Rann. âAdam anâ Sethâs two men; you
wunna fit them two wiâ the same last.â

âMaybe,â said Wiry Ben, contemptuously, âbut Sethâs the lad for me, though he
war a Methody twice oâer. Iâm fair beat wiâ Seth, for Iâve been teasinâ him
iver sinâ weâve been workinâ together, anâ he bears me no more malice nor a
lamb. Anâ heâs a stout-hearted feller too, for when we saw the old tree all
afire a-cominâ across the fields one night, anâ we thought as it war a boguy,
Seth made no more ado, but he up toât as bold as a constable. Why, there he
comes out oâ Will Maskeryâs; anâ thereâs Will hisself, lookinâ as meek as if he
couldna knock a nail oâ the head for fear oâ hurtinât. Anâ thereâs the pretty
preacher woman! My eye, sheâs got her bonnet off. I mun go a bit nearer.â

Several of the men followed Benâs lead, and the traveller pushed his horse on
to the Green, as Dinah walked rather quickly and in advance of her companions
towards the cart under the maple-tree. While she was near Sethâs tall figure,
she looked short, but when she had mounted the cart, and was away from all
comparison, she seemed above the middle height of woman, though in reality she
did not exceed itâan effect which was due to the slimness of her figure and the
simple line of her black stuff dress. The stranger was struck with surprise as
he saw her approach and mount the cartâsurprise, not so much at the feminine
delicacy of her appearance, as at the total absence of self-consciousness in
her demeanour. He had made up his mind to see her advance with a measured step
and a demure solemnity of countenance; he had felt sure that her face would be
mantled with the smile of conscious saintship, or else charged with
denunciatory bitterness. He knew but two types of Methodistâthe ecstatic and
the bilious. But Dinah walked as simply as if she were going to market, and
seemed as unconscious of her outward appearance as a little boy: there was no
blush, no tremulousness, which said, âI know you think me a pretty woman, too
young to preachâ; no casting up or down of the eyelids, no compression of the
lips, no attitude of the arms that said, âBut you must think of me as a saint.â
She held no book in her ungloved hands, but let them hang down lightly crossed
before her, as she stood and turned her grey eyes on the people. There was no
keenness in the eyes; they seemed rather to be shedding love than making
observations; they had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of
what it has to give out, rather than impressed by external objects. She stood
with her left hand towards the descending sun, and leafy boughs screened her
from its rays; but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her face
seemed to gather a calm vividness, like flowers at evening. It was a small oval
face, of a uniform transparent whiteness, with an egg-like line of cheek and
chin, a full but firm mouth, a delicate nostril, and a low perpendicular brow,
surmounted by a rising arch of parting between smooth locks of pale reddish
hair. The hair was drawn straight back behind the ears, and covered, except for
an inch or two above the brow, by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows, of the same
colour as the hair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the
eyelashes, though no darker, were long and abundantânothing was left blurred or
unfinished. It was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers with
light touches of colour on their pure petals. The eyes had no peculiar beauty,
beyond that of expression; they looked so simple, so candid, so gravely loving,
that no accusing scowl, no light sneer could help melting away before their
glance. Joshua Rann gave a long cough, as if he were clearing his throat in
order to come to a new understanding with himself; Chad Cranage lifted up his
leather skull-cap and scratched his head; and Wiry Ben wondered how Seth had
the pluck to think of courting her.

âA sweet woman,â the stranger said to himself, âbut surely nature never meant
her for a preacher.â

Perhaps he was one of those who think that nature has theatrical properties
and, with the considerate view of facilitating art and psychology, âmakes up,â
her characters, so that there may be no mistake about them. But Dinah began to
speak.

âDear friends,â she said in a clear but not loud voice âlet us pray for a
blessing.â

She closed her eyes, and hanging her head down a little continued in the same
moderate tone, as if speaking to some one quite near her: âSaviour of sinners!
When a poor woman laden with sins, went out to the well to draw water, she
found Thee sitting at the well. She knew Thee not; she had not sought Thee; her
mind was dark; her life was unholy. But Thou didst speak to her, Thou didst
teach her, Thou didst show her that her life lay open before Thee, and yet Thou
wast ready to give her that blessing which she had never sought. Jesus, Thou
art in the midst of us, and Thou knowest all men: if there is any here like
that poor womanâif their minds are dark, their lives unholyâif they have come
out not seeking Thee, not desiring to be taught; deal with them according to
the free mercy which Thou didst show to her. Speak to them, Lord, open their
ears to my message, bring their sins to their minds, and make them thirst for
that salvation which Thou art ready to give.

âLord, Thou art with Thy people still: they see Thee in the night-watches, and
their hearts burn within them as Thou talkest with them by the way. And Thou
art near to those who have not known Thee: open their eyes that they may see
Theeâsee Thee weeping over them, and saying âYe will not come unto me that ye
might have lifeââsee Thee hanging on the cross and saying, âFather, forgive
them, for they know not what they doââsee Thee as Thou wilt come again in Thy
glory to judge them at the last. Amen.â

Dinah opened her eyes again and paused, looking at the group of villagers, who
were now gathered rather more closely on her right hand.

âDear friends,â she began, raising her voice a little, âyou have all of you
been to church, and I think you must have heard the clergyman read these words:
âThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the
gospel to the poor.â Jesus Christ spoke those wordsâhe said he came
to
preach the Gospel to the poor:
I donât know whether you ever thought about
those words much, but I will tell you when I remember first hearing them. It
was on just such a sort of evening as this, when I was a little girl, and my
aunt as brought me up took me to hear a good man preach out of doors, just as
we are here. I remember his face well: he was a very old man, and had very long
white hair; his voice was very soft and beautiful, not like any voice I had
ever heard before. I was a little girl and scarcely knew anything, and this old
man seemed to me such a different sort of a man from anybody I had ever seen
before that I thought he had perhaps come down from the sky to preach to us,
and I said, âAunt, will he go back to the sky to-night, like the picture in the
Bible?â

âThat man of God was Mr. Wesley, who spent his life in doing what our blessed
Lord didâpreaching the Gospel to the poorâand he entered into his rest eight
years ago. I came to know more about him years after, but I was a foolish
thoughtless child then, and I remembered only one thing he told us in his
sermon. He told us as âGospelâ meant âgood news.â The Gospel, you know, is what
the Bible tells us about God.

âThink of that now! Jesus Christ did really come down from heaven, as I, like a
silly child, thought Mr. Wesley did; and what he came down for was to tell good
news about God to the poor. Why, you and me, dear friends, are poor. We have
been brought up in poor cottages and have been reared on oat-cake, and lived
coarse; and we havenât been to school much, nor read books, and we donât know
much about anything but what happens just round us. We are just the sort of
people that want to hear good news. For when anybodyâs well off, they donât
much mind about hearing news from distant parts; but if a poor man or womanâs
in trouble and has hard work to make out a living, they like to have a letter
to tell âem theyâve got a friend as will help âem. To be sure, we canât help
knowing something about God, even if weâve never heard the Gospel, the good
news that our Saviour brought us. For we know everything comes from God: donât
you say almost every day, âThis and that will happen, please God,â and âWe
shall begin to cut the grass soon, please God to send us a little more
sunshineâ? We know very well we are altogether in the hands of God. We didnât
bring ourselves into the world, we canât keep ourselves alive while weâre
sleeping; the daylight, and the wind, and the corn, and the cows to give us
milkâeverything we have comes from God. And he gave us our souls and put love
between parents and children, and husband and wife. But is that as much as we
want to know about God? We see he is great and mighty, and can do what he will:
we are lost, as if we was struggling in great waters, when we try to think of
him.

âBut perhaps doubts come into your mind like this: Can God take much notice of
us poor people? Perhaps he only made the world for the great and the wise and
the rich. It doesnât cost him much to give us our little handful of victual and
bit of clothing; but how do we know he cares for us any more than we care for
the worms and things in the garden, so as we rear our carrots and onions? Will
God take care of us when we die? And has he any comfort for us when we are lame
and sick and helpless? Perhaps, too, he is angry with us; else why does the
blight come, and the bad harvests, and the fever, and all sorts of pain and
trouble? For our life is full of trouble, and if God sends us good, he seems to
send bad too. How is it? How is it?

âAh, dear friends, we are in sad want of good news about God; and what does
other good news signify if we havenât that? For everything else comes to an
end, and when we die we leave it all. But God lasts when everything else is
gone. What shall we do if he is not our friend?â

Then Dinah told how the good news had been brought, and how the mind of God
towards the poor had been made manifest in the life of Jesus, dwelling on its
lowliness and its acts of mercy.

âSo you see, dear friends,â she went on, âJesus spent his time almost all in
doing good to poor people; he preached out of doors to them, and he made
friends of poor workmen, and taught them and took pains with them. Not but what
he did good to the rich too, for he was full of love to all men, only he saw as
the poor were more in want of his help. So he cured the lame and the sick and
the blind, and he worked miracles to feed the hungry because, he said, he was
sorry for them; and he was very kind to the little children and comforted those
who had lost their friends; and he spoke very tenderly to poor sinners that
were sorry for their sins.

âAh, wouldnât you love such a man if you saw himâif he were here in this
village? What a kind heart he must have! What a friend he would be to go to in
trouble! How pleasant it must be to be taught by him.

âWell, dear friends, who
was
this man? Was he only a good manâa very
good man, and no moreâlike our dear Mr. Wesley, who has been taken from us?...
He was the Son of Godââin the image of the Father,â the Bible says; that means,
just like God, who is the beginning and end of all thingsâthe God we want to
know about. So then, all the love that Jesus showed to the poor is the same
love that God has for us. We can understand what Jesus felt, because he came in
a body like ours and spoke words such as we speak to each other. We were afraid
to think what God was beforeâthe God who made the world and the sky and the
thunder and lightning. We could never see him; we could only see the things he
had made; and some of these things was very terrible, so as we might well
tremble when we thought of him. But our blessed Saviour has showed us what God
is in a way us poor ignorant people can understand; he has showed us what Godâs
heart is, what are his feelings towards us.

âBut let us see a little more about what Jesus came on earth for. Another time
he said, âI came to seek and to save that which was lostâ; and another time, âI
came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.â

âThe
lost!... Sinners!
... Ah, dear friends, does that mean you and me?â

Hitherto the traveller had been chained to the spot against his will by the
charm of Dinahâs mellow treble tones, which had a variety of modulation like
that of a fine instrument touched with the unconscious skill of musical
instinct. The simple things she said seemed like novelties, as a melody strikes
us with a new feeling when we hear it sung by the pure voice of a boyish
chorister; the quiet depth of conviction with which she spoke seemed in itself
an evidence for the truth of her message. He saw that she had thoroughly
arrested her hearers. The villagers had pressed nearer to her, and there was no
longer anything but grave attention on all faces. She spoke slowly, though
quite fluently, often pausing after a question, or before any transition of
ideas. There was no change of attitude, no gesture; the effect of her speech
was produced entirely by the inflections of her voice, and when she came to the
question, âWill God take care of us when we die?â she uttered it in such a tone
of plaintive appeal that the tears came into some of the hardest eyes. The
stranger had ceased to doubt, as he had done at the first glance, that she
could fix the attention of her rougher hearers, but still he wondered whether
she could have that power of rousing their more violent emotions, which must
surely be a necessary seal of her vocation as a Methodist preacher, until she
came to the words, âLost!âSinners!â when there was a great change in her voice
and manner. She had made a long pause before the exclamation, and the pause
seemed to be filled by agitating thoughts that showed themselves in her
features. Her pale face became paler; the circles under her eyes deepened, as
they did when tears half-gather without falling; and the mild loving eyes took
an expression of appalled pity, as if she had suddenly discerned a destroying
angel hovering over the heads of the people. Her voice became deep and muffled,
but there was still no gesture. Nothing could be less like the ordinary type of
the Ranter than Dinah. She was not preaching as she heard others preach, but
speaking directly from her own emotions and under the inspiration of her own
simple faith.

But now she had entered into a new current of feeling. Her manner became less
calm, her utterance more rapid and agitated, as she tried to bring home to the
people their guilt, their wilful darkness, their state of disobedience to
Godâas she dwelt on the hatefulness of sin, the Divine holiness, and the
sufferings of the Saviour, by which a way had been opened for their salvation.
At last it seemed as if, in her yearning desire to reclaim the lost sheep, she
could not be satisfied by addressing her hearers as a body. She appealed first
to one and then to another, beseeching them with tears to turn to God while
there was yet time; painting to them the desolation of their souls, lost in
sin, feeding on the husks of this miserable world, far away from God their
Father; and then the love of the Saviour, who was waiting and watching for
their return.

There was many a responsive sigh and groan from her fellow-Methodists, but the
village mind does not easily take fire, and a little smouldering vague anxiety
that might easily die out again was the utmost effect Dinahâs preaching had
wrought in them at present. Yet no one had retired, except the children and
âold Feyther Taft,â who being too deaf to catch many words, had some time ago
gone back to his inglenook. Wiry Ben was feeling very uncomfortable, and almost
wishing he had not come to hear Dinah; he thought what she said would haunt him
somehow. Yet he couldnât help liking to look at her and listen to her, though
he dreaded every moment that she would fix her eyes on him and address him in
particular. She had already addressed Sandy Jim, who was now holding the baby
to relieve his wife, and the big soft-hearted man had rubbed away some tears
with his fist, with a confused intention of being a better fellow, going less
to the Holly Bush down by the Stone-pits, and cleaning himself more regularly
of a Sunday.

In front of Sandy Jim stood Chadâs Bess, who had shown an unwonted quietude and
fixity of attention ever since Dinah had begun to speak. Not that the matter of
the discourse had arrested her at once, for she was lost in a puzzling
speculation as to what pleasure and satisfaction there could be in life to a
young woman who wore a cap like Dinahâs. Giving up this inquiry in despair, she
took to studying Dinahâs nose, eyes, mouth, and hair, and wondering whether it
was better to have such a sort of pale face as that, or fat red cheeks and
round black eyes like her own. But gradually the influence of the general
gravity told upon her, and she became conscious of what Dinah was saying. The
gentle tones, the loving persuasion, did not touch her, but when the more
severe appeals came she began to be frightened. Poor Bessy had always been
considered a naughty girl; she was conscious of it; if it was necessary to be
very good, it was clear she must be in a bad way. She couldnât find her places
at church as Sally Rann could, she had often been tittering when she
âcurcheyedâ to Mr. Irwine; and these religious deficiencies were accompanied by
a corresponding slackness in the minor morals, for Bessy belonged
unquestionably to that unsoaped lazy class of feminine characters with whom you
may venture to âeat an egg, an apple, or a nut.â All this she was generally
conscious of, and hitherto had not been greatly ashamed of it. But now she
began to feel very much as if the constable had come to take her up and carry
her before the justice for some undefined offence. She had a terrified sense
that God, whom she had always thought of as very far off, was very near to her,
and that Jesus was close by looking at her, though she could not see him. For
Dinah had that belief in visible manifestations of Jesus, which is common among
the Methodists, and she communicated it irresistibly to her hearers: she made
them feel that he was among them bodily, and might at any moment show himself
to them in some way that would strike anguish and penitence into their hearts.

âSee!â she exclaimed, turning to the left, with her eyes fixed on a point above
the heads of the people. âSee where our blessed Lord stands and weeps and
stretches out his arms towards you. Hear what he says: âHow often would I have
gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
not!â... and ye would not,â she repeated, in a tone of pleading reproach,
turning her eyes on the people again. âSee the print of the nails on his dear
hands and feet. It is your sins that made them! Ah! How pale and worn he looks!
He has gone through all that great agony in the garden, when his soul was
exceeding sorrowful even unto death, and the great drops of sweat fell like
blood to the ground. They spat upon him and buffeted him, they scourged him,
they mocked him, they laid the heavy cross on his bruised shoulders. Then they
nailed him up. Ah, what pain! His lips are parched with thirst, and they mock
him still in this great agony; yet with those parched lips he prays for them,
âFather, forgive them, for they know not what they do.â Then a horror of great
darkness fell upon him, and he felt what sinners feel when they are for ever
shut out from God. That was the last drop in the cup of bitterness. âMy God, my
God!â he cries, âwhy hast Thou forsaken me?â

âAll this he bore for you! For youâand you never think of him; for youâand you
turn your backs on him; you donât care what he has gone through for you. Yet he
is not weary of toiling for you: he has risen from the dead, he is praying for
you at the right hand of GodââFather, forgive them, for they know not what they
do.â And he is upon this earth too; he is among us; he is there close to you
now; I see his wounded body and his look of love.â

Here Dinah turned to Bessy Cranage, whose bonny youth and evident vanity had
touched her with pity.

âPoor child! Poor child! He is beseeching you, and you donât listen to him. You
think of ear-rings and fine gowns and caps, and you never think of the Saviour
who died to save your precious soul. Your cheeks will be shrivelled one day,
your hair will be grey, your poor body will be thin and tottering! Then you
will begin to feel that your soul is not saved; then you will have to stand
before God dressed in your sins, in your evil tempers and vain thoughts. And
Jesus, who stands ready to help you now, wonât help you then; because you wonât
have him to be your Saviour, he will be your judge. Now he looks at you with
love and mercy and says, âCome to me that you may have lifeâ; then he will turn
away from you, and say, âDepart from me into ever-lasting fire!ââ

Poor Bessyâs wide-open black eyes began to fill with tears, her great red
cheeks and lips became quite pale, and her face was distorted like a little
childâs before a burst of crying.

âAh, poor blind child!â Dinah went on, âthink if it should happen to you as it
once happened to a servant of God in the days of her vanity.
She
thought
of her lace caps and saved all her money to buy âem; she thought nothing about
how she might get a clean heart and a right spiritâshe only wanted to have
better lace than other girls. And one day when she put her new cap on and
looked in the glass, she saw a bleeding Face crowned with thorns. That face is
looking at you nowââhere Dinah pointed to a spot close in front of BessyââAh,
tear off those follies! Cast them away from you, as if they were stinging
adders. They
are
stinging youâthey are poisoning your soulâthey are
dragging you down into a dark bottomless pit, where you will sink for ever, and
for ever, and for ever, further away from light and God.â

Bessy could bear it no longer: a great terror was upon her, and wrenching her
ear-rings from her ears, she threw them down before her, sobbing aloud. Her
father, Chad, frightened lest he should be âlaid hold onâ too, this impression
on the rebellious Bess striking him as nothing less than a miracle, walked
hastily away and began to work at his anvil by way of reassuring himself.
âFolks mun haâ hoss-shoes, praichinâ or no praichinâ: the divil canna lay hould
oâ me for that,â he muttered to himself.

But now Dinah began to tell of the joys that were in store for the penitent,
and to describe in her simple way the divine peace and love with which the soul
of the believer is filledâhow the sense of Godâs love turns poverty into riches
and satisfies the soul so that no uneasy desire vexes it, no fear alarms it:
how, at last, the very temptation to sin is extinguished, and heaven is begun
upon earth, because no cloud passes between the soul and God, who is its
eternal sun.

âDear friends,â she said at last, âbrothers and sisters, whom I love as those
for whom my Lord has died, believe me, I know what this great blessedness is;
and because I know it, I want you to have it too. I am poor, like you: I have
to get my living with my hands; but no lord nor lady can be so happy as me, if
they havenât got the love of God in their souls. Think what it isânot to hate
anything but sin; to be full of love to every creature; to be frightened at
nothing; to be sure that all things will turn to good; not to mind pain,
because it is our Fatherâs will; to know that nothingâno, not if the earth was
to be burnt up, or the waters come and drown usânothing could part us from God
who loves us, and who fills our souls with peace and joy, because we are sure
that whatever he wills is holy, just, and good.

âDear friends, come and take this blessedness; it is offered to you; it is the
good news that Jesus came to preach to the poor. It is not like the riches of
this world, so that the more one gets the less the rest can have. God is
without end; his love is without endââ

Its streams the whole creation reach,

Â Â Â Â So plenteous is the store;

Enough for all, enough for each,

Â Â Â Â Enough for evermore.

Dinah had been speaking at least an hour, and the reddening light of the
parting day seemed to give a solemn emphasis to her closing words. The
stranger, who had been interested in the course of her sermon as if it had been
the development of a dramaâfor there is this sort of fascination in all sincere
unpremeditated eloquence, which opens to one the inward drama of the speakerâs
emotionsânow turned his horse aside and pursued his way, while Dinah said, âLet
us sing a little, dear friendsâ; and as he was still winding down the slope,
the voices of the Methodists reached him, rising and falling in that strange
blending of exultation and sadness which belongs to the cadence of a hymn.

Chapter III

After the Preaching

In less than an hour from that time, Seth Bede was walking by Dinahâs side
along the hedgerow-path that skirted the pastures and green corn-fields which
lay between the village and the Hall Farm. Dinah had taken off her little
Quaker bonnet again, and was holding it in her hands that she might have a
freer enjoyment of the cool evening twilight, and Seth could see the expression
of her face quite clearly as he walked by her side, timidly revolving something
he wanted to say to her. It was an expression of unconscious placid gravityâof
absorption in thoughts that had no connection with the present moment or with
her own personalityâan expression that is most of all discouraging to a lover.
Her very walk was discouraging: it had that quiet elasticity that asks for no
support. Seth felt this dimly; he said to himself, âSheâs too good and holy for
any man, let alone me,â and the words he had been summoning rushed back again
before they had reached his lips. But another thought gave him courage:
âThereâs no man could love her better and leave her freer to follow the Lordâs
work.â They had been silent for many minutes now, since they had done talking
about Bessy Cranage; Dinah seemed almost to have forgotten Sethâs presence, and
her pace was becoming so much quicker that the sense of their being only a few
minutesâ walk from the yard-gates of the Hall Farm at last gave Seth courage to
speak.

âYouâve quite made up your mind to go back to Snowfield oâ Saturday, Dinah?â

âYes,â said Dinah, quietly. âIâm called there. It was borne in upon my mind
while I was meditating on Sunday night, as Sister Allen, whoâs in a decline, is
in need of me. I saw her as plain as we see that bit of thin white cloud,
lifting up her poor thin hand and beckoning to me. And this morning when I
opened the Bible for direction, the first words my eyes fell on were, âAnd
after we had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia.â
If it wasnât for that clear showing of the Lordâs will, I should be loath to
go, for my heart yearns over my aunt and her little ones, and that poor
wandering lamb Hetty Sorrel. Iâve been much drawn out in prayer for her of
late, and I look on it as a token that there may be mercy in store for her.â

âGod grant it,â said Seth. âFor I doubt Adamâs heart is so set on her, heâll
never turn to anybody else; and yet it âud go to my heart if he was to marry
her, for I canna think as sheâd make him happy. Itâs a deep mysteryâthe way the
heart of man turns to one woman out of all the rest heâs seen iâ the world, and
makes it easier for him to work seven year for
her
, like Jacob did for
Rachel, sooner than have any other woman for thâ asking. I often think of them
words, âAnd Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a
few days for the love he had to her.â I know those words âud come true with me,
Dinah, if so be youâd give me hope as I might win you after seven years was
over. I know you think a husband âud be taking up too much oâ your thoughts,
because St. Paul says, âShe thatâs married careth for the things of the world
how she may please her husbandâ; and may happen youâll think me overbold to
speak to you about it again, after what you told me oâ your mind last Saturday.
But Iâve been thinking it over again by night and by day, and Iâve prayed not
to be blinded by my own desires, to think whatâs only good for me must be good
for you too. And it seems to me thereâs more texts for your marrying than ever
you can find against it. For St. Paul says as plain as can be in another place,
âI will that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none
occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfullyâ; and then âtwo are better
than oneâ; and that holds good with marriage as well as with other things. For
we should be oâ one heart and oâ one mind, Dinah. We both serve the same
Master, and are striving after the same gifts; and Iâd never be the husband to
make a claim on you as could interfere with your doing the work God has fitted
you for. Iâd make a shift, and fend indoor and out, to give you more
libertyâmore than you can have now, for youâve got to get your own living now,
and Iâm strong enough to work for us both.â

When Seth had once begun to urge his suit, he went on earnestly and almost
hurriedly, lest Dinah should speak some decisive word before he had poured
forth all the arguments he had prepared. His cheeks became flushed as he went
on, his mild grey eyes filled with tears, and his voice trembled as he spoke
the last sentence. They had reached one of those very narrow passes between two
tall stones, which performed the office of a stile in Loamshire, and Dinah
paused as she turned towards Seth and said, in her tender but calm treble
notes, âSeth Bede, I thank you for your love towards me, and if I could think
of any man as more than a Christian brother, I think it would be you. But my
heart is not free to marry. That is good for other women, and it is a great and
a blessed thing to be a wife and mother; but âas God has distributed to every
man, as the Lord hath called every man, so let him walk.â God has called me to
minister to others, not to have any joys or sorrows of my own, but to rejoice
with them that do rejoice, and to weep with those that weep. He has called me
to speak his word, and he has greatly owned my work. It could only be on a very
clear showing that I could leave the brethren and sisters at Snowfield, who are
favoured with very little of this worldâs good; where the trees are few, so
that a child might count them, and thereâs very hard living for the poor in the
winter. It has been given me to help, to comfort, and strengthen the little
flock there and to call in many wanderers; and my soul is filled with these
things from my rising up till my lying down. My life is too short, and Godâs
work is too great for me to think of making a home for myself in this world.
Iâve not turned a deaf ear to your words, Seth, for when I saw as your love was
given to me, I thought it might be a leading of Providence for me to change my
way of life, and that we should be fellow-helpers; and I spread the matter
before the Lord. But whenever I tried to fix my mind on marriage, and our
living together, other thoughts always came inâthe times when Iâve prayed by
the sick and dying, and the happy hours Iâve had preaching, when my heart was
filled with love, and the Word was given to me abundantly. And when Iâve opened
the Bible for direction, Iâve always lighted on some clear word to tell me
where my work lay. I believe what you say, Seth, that you would try to be a
help and not a hindrance to my work; but I see that our marriage is not Godâs
willâHe draws my heart another way. I desire to live and die without husband or
children. I seem to have no room in my soul for wants and fears of my own, it
has pleased God to fill my heart so full with the wants and sufferings of his
poor people.â

Seth was unable to reply, and they walked on in silence. At last, as they were
nearly at the yard-gate, he said, âWell, Dinah, I must seek for strength to
bear it, and to endure as seeing Him who is invisible. But I feel now how weak
my faith is. It seems as if, when you are gone, I could never joy in anything
any more. I think itâs something passing the love of women as I feel for you,
for I could be content without your marrying me if I could go and live at
Snowfield and be near you. I trusted as the strong love God has given me
towards you was a leading for us both; but it seems it was only meant for my
trial. Perhaps I feel more for you than I ought to feel for any creature, for I
often canât help saying of you what the hymn saysâ

In darkest shades if she appear,

Â Â Â Â My dawning is begun;

She is my soulâs bright morning-star,

Â Â Â Â And she my rising sun.

That may be wrong, and I am to be taught better. But you wouldnât be displeased
with me if things turned out so as I could leave this country and go to live at
Snowfield?â

âNo, Seth; but I counsel you to wait patiently, and not lightly to leave your
own country and kindred. Do nothing without the Lordâs clear bidding. Itâs a
bleak and barren country there, not like this land of Goshen youâve been used
to. We mustnât be in a hurry to fix and choose our own lot; we must wait to be
guided.â

âBut youâd let me write you a letter, Dinah, if there was anything I wanted to
tell you?â

âYes, sure; let me know if youâre in any trouble. Youâll be continually in my
prayers.â

They had now reached the yard-gate, and Seth said, âI wonât go in, Dinah, so
farewell.â He paused and hesitated after she had given him her hand, and then
said, âThereâs no knowing but what you may see things different after a while.
There may be a new leading.â

âLet us leave that, Seth. Itâs good to live only a moment at a time, as Iâve
read in one of Mr. Wesleyâs books. It isnât for you and me to lay plans; weâve
nothing to do but to obey and to trust. Farewell.â

Dinah pressed his hand with rather a sad look in her loving eyes, and then
passed through the gate, while Seth turned away to walk lingeringly home. But
instead of taking the direct road, he chose to turn back along the fields
through which he and Dinah had already passed; and I think his blue linen
handkerchief was very wet with tears long before he had made up his mind that
it was time for him to set his face steadily homewards. He was but
three-and-twenty, and had only just learned what it is to loveâto love with
that adoration which a young man gives to a woman whom he feels to be greater
and better than himself. Love of this sort is hardly distinguishable from
religious feeling. What deep and worthy love is so, whether of woman or child,
or art or music. Our caresses, our tender words, our still rapture under the
influence of autumn sunsets, or pillared vistas, or calm majestic statues, or
Beethoven symphonies all bring with them the consciousness that they are mere
waves and ripples in an unfathomable ocean of love and beauty; our emotion in
its keenest moment passes from expression into silence, our love at its highest
flood rushes beyond its object and loses itself in the sense of divine mystery.
And this blessed gift of venerating love has been given to too many humble
craftsmen since the world began for us to feel any surprise that it should have
existed in the soul of a Methodist carpenter half a century ago, while there
was yet a lingering after-glow from the time when Wesley and his
fellow-labourer fed on the hips and haws of the Cornwall hedges, after
exhausting limbs and lungs in carrying a divine message to the poor.

That afterglow has long faded away; and the picture we are apt to make of
Methodism in our imagination is not an amphitheatre of green hills, or the deep
shade of broad-leaved sycamores, where a crowd of rough men and weary-hearted
women drank in a faith which was a rudimentary culture, which linked their
thoughts with the past, lifted their imagination above the sordid details of
their own narrow lives, and suffused their souls with the sense of a pitying,
loving, infinite Presence, sweet as summer to the houseless needy. It is too
possible that to some of my readers Methodism may mean nothing more than
low-pitched gables up dingy streets, sleek grocers, sponging preachers, and
hypocritical jargonâelements which are regarded as an exhaustive analysis of
Methodism in many fashionable quarters.

That would be a pity; for I cannot pretend that Seth and Dinah were anything
else than Methodistsânot indeed of that modern type which reads quarterly
reviews and attends in chapels with pillared porticoes, but of a very
old-fashioned kind. They believed in present miracles, in instantaneous
conversions, in revelations by dreams and visions; they drew lots, and sought
for Divine guidance by opening the Bible at hazard; having a literal way of
interpreting the Scriptures, which is not at all sanctioned by approved
commentators; and it is impossible for me to represent their diction as
correct, or their instruction as liberal. Stillâif I have read religious
history arightâfaith, hope, and charity have not always been found in a direct
ratio with a sensibility to the three concords, and it is possibleâthank
Heaven!âto have very erroneous theories and very sublime feelings. The raw
bacon which clumsy Molly spares from her own scanty store that she may carry it
to her neighbourâs child to âstop the fits,â may be a piteously inefficacious
remedy; but the generous stirring of neighbourly kindness that prompted the
deed has a beneficent radiation that is not lost.

Considering these things, we can hardly think Dinah and Seth beneath our
sympathy, accustomed as we may be to weep over the loftier sorrows of heroines
in satin boots and crinoline, and of heroes riding fiery horses, themselves
ridden by still more fiery passions.

Poor Seth! He was never on horseback in his life except once, when he was a
little lad, and Mr. Jonathan Burge took him up behind, telling him to âhold on
tightâ; and instead of bursting out into wild accusing apostrophes to God and
destiny, he is resolving, as he now walks homewards under the solemn starlight,
to repress his sadness, to be less bent on having his own will, and to live
more for others, as Dinah does.

Chapter IV

Home and Its Sorrows

A green valley with a brook running through it, full almost to overflowing with
the late rains, overhung by low stooping willows. Across this brook a plank is
thrown, and over this plank Adam Bede is passing with his undoubting step,
followed close by Gyp with the basket; evidently making his way to the thatched
house, with a stack of timber by the side of it, about twenty yards up the
opposite slope.

The door of the house is open, and an elderly woman is looking out; but she is
not placidly contemplating the evening sunshine; she has been watching with dim
eyes the gradually enlarging speck which for the last few minutes she has been
quite sure is her darling son Adam. Lisbeth Bede loves her son with the love of
a woman to whom her first-born has come late in life. She is an anxious, spare,
yet vigorous old woman, clean as a snowdrop. Her grey hair is turned neatly
back under a pure linen cap with a black band round it; her broad chest is
covered with a buff neckerchief, and below this you see a sort of short bedgown
made of blue-checkered linen, tied round the waist and descending to the hips,
from whence there is a considerable length of linsey-woolsey petticoat. For
Lisbeth is tall, and in other points too there is a strong likeness between her
and her son Adam. Her dark eyes are somewhat dim nowâperhaps from too much
cryingâbut her broadly marked eyebrows are still black, her teeth are sound,
and as she stands knitting rapidly and unconsciously with her work-hardened
hands, she has as firmly upright an attitude as when she is carrying a pail of
water on her head from the spring. There is the same type of frame and the same
keen activity of temperament in mother and son, but it was not from her that
Adam got his well-filled brow and his expression of large-hearted intelligence.

Family likeness has often a deep sadness in it. Nature, that great tragic
dramatist, knits us together by bone and muscle, and divides us by the subtler
web of our brains; blends yearning and repulsion; and ties us by our
heart-strings to the beings that jar us at every movement. We hear a voice with
the very cadence of our own uttering the thoughts we despise; we see eyesâah,
so like our motherâs!âaverted from us in cold alienation; and our last darling
child startles us with the air and gestures of the sister we parted from in
bitterness long years ago. The father to whom we owe our best heritageâthe
mechanical instinct, the keen sensibility to harmony, the unconscious skill of
the modelling handâgalls us and puts us to shame by his daily errors; the
long-lost mother, whose face we begin to see in the glass as our own wrinkles
come, once fretted our young souls with her anxious humours and irrational
persistence.

It is such a fond anxious motherâs voice that you hear, as Lisbeth says, âWell,
my lad, itâs gone seven by thâ clock. Theeât allays stay till the last childâs
born. Thee wants thy supper, Iâll warrand. Whereâs Seth? Gone arter some oâs
chapellinâ, I reckon?â

âAye, aye, Sethâs at no harm, mother, thee mayst be sure. But whereâs father?â
said Adam quickly, as he entered the house and glanced into the room on the
left hand, which was used as a workshop. âHasnât he done the coffin for Tholer?
Thereâs the stuff standing just as I left it this morning.â

âDone the coffin?â said Lisbeth, following him, and knitting uninterruptedly,
though she looked at her son very anxiously. âEh, my lad, he went aff to
Treddlesâon this forenoon, anâs niver come back. I doubt heâs got to thâ
âWaggin Overthrowâ again.â

A deep flush of anger passed rapidly over Adamâs face. He said nothing, but
threw off his jacket and began to roll up his shirt-sleeves again.

âWhat art goinâ to do, Adam?â said the mother, with a tone and look of alarm.
âThee wouldstna go to work again, wiâout haâin thy bit oâ supper?â

Adam, too angry to speak, walked into the workshop. But his mother threw down
her knitting, and, hurrying after him, took hold of his arm, and said, in a
tone of plaintive remonstrance, âNay, my lad, my lad, thee munna go wiâout thy
supper; thereâs the taters wiâ the gravy in âem, just as thee likâst âem. I
saved âem oâ purpose for thee. Come anâ haâ thy supper, come.â

âLet be!â said Adam impetuously, shaking her off and seizing one of the planks
that stood against the wall. âItâs fine talking about having supper when hereâs
a coffin promised to be ready at Broxâon by seven oâclock to-morrow morning,
and ought to haâ been there now, and not a nail struck yet. My throatâs too
full to swallow victuals.â

âWhy, thee canstna get the coffin ready,â said Lisbeth. âTheeât work thyself to
death. It âud take thee all night to doât.â

âWhat signifies how long it takes me? Isnât the coffin promised? Can they bury
the man without a coffin? Iâd work my right hand off sooner than deceive people
with lies iâ that way. It makes me mad to think onât. I shall overrun these
doings before long. Iâve stood enough of âem.â

Poor Lisbeth did not hear this threat for the first time, and if she had been
wise she would have gone away quietly and said nothing for the next hour. But
one of the lessons a woman most rarely learns is never to talk to an angry or a
drunken man. Lisbeth sat down on the chopping bench and began to cry, and by
the time she had cried enough to make her voice very piteous, she burst out
into words.

âNay, my lad, my lad, thee wouldstna go away anâ break thy motherâs heart, anâ
leave thy feyther to ruin. Thee wouldstna haâ âem carry me to thâ churchyard,
anâ thee not to follow me. I shanna rest iâ my grave if I donna see thee at thâ
last; anâ howâs they to let thee know as Iâm a-dyinâ, if theeât gone a-workinâ
iâ distant parts, anâ Seth belike gone arter thee, and thy feyther not able to
hold a pen forâs hand shakinâ, besides not knowinâ where thee art? Thee mun
forgie thy feytherâthee munna be so bitter againâ him. He war a good feyther to
thee afore he took to thâ drink. Heâs a clever workman, anâ taught thee thy
trade, remember, anâs niver gen me a blow nor so much as an ill wordâno, not
even in âs drink. Thee wouldstna haâ âm go to the workhusâthy own feytherâanâ
him as was a fine-growed man anâ handy at everythinâ amost as thee art thysen,
five-anâ-twenty âear ago, when thee wast a baby at the breast.â

Lisbethâs voice became louder, and choked with sobsâa sort of wail, the most
irritating of all sounds where real sorrows are to be borne and real work to be
done. Adam broke in impatiently.

âNow, Mother, donât cry and talk so. Havenât I got enough to vex me without
that? Whatâs thâ use oâ telling me things as I only think too much on every
day? If I didna think on âem, why should I do as I do, for the sake oâ keeping
things together here? But I hate to be talking where itâs no use: I like to
keep my breath for doing iâstead oâ talking.â

âI know thee dost things as nobody else âud do, my lad. But theeât allays so
hard upoâ thy feyther, Adam. Thee thinkâst nothing too much to do for Seth:
thee snappâst me up if iver I find faut wiâ thâ lad. But theeât so angered wiâ
thy feyther, more nor wiâ anybody else.â

âThatâs better than speaking soft and letting things go the wrong way, I
reckon, isnât it? If I wasnât sharp with him heâd sell every bit oâ stuff iâ
thâ yard and spend it on drink. I know thereâs a duty to be done by my father,
but it isnât my duty to encourage him in running headlong to ruin. And what has
Seth got to do with it? The lad does no harm as I know of. But leave me alone,
Mother, and let me get on with the work.â

Lisbeth dared not say any more; but she got up and called Gyp, thinking to
console herself somewhat for Adamâs refusal of the supper she had spread out in
the loving expectation of looking at him while he ate it, by feeding Adamâs dog
with extra liberality. But Gyp was watching his master with wrinkled brow and
ears erect, puzzled at this unusual course of things; and though he glanced at
Lisbeth when she called him, and moved his fore-paws uneasily, well knowing
that she was inviting him to supper, he was in a divided state of mind, and
remained seated on his haunches, again fixing his eyes anxiously on his master.
Adam noticed Gypâs mental conflict, and though his anger had made him less
tender than usual to his mother, it did not prevent him from caring as much as
usual for his dog. We are apt to be kinder to the brutes that love us than to
the women that love us. Is it because the brutes are dumb?

âGo, Gyp; go, lad!â Adam said, in a tone of encouraging command; and Gyp,
apparently satisfied that duty and pleasure were one, followed Lisbeth into the
house-place.

But no sooner had he licked up his supper than he went back to his master,
while Lisbeth sat down alone to cry over her knitting. Women who are never
bitter and resentful are often the most querulous; and if Solomon was as wise
as he is reputed to be, I feel sure that when he compared a contentious woman
to a continual dropping on a very rainy day, he had not a vixen in his eyeâa
fury with long nails, acrid and selfish. Depend upon it, he meant a good
creature, who had no joy but in the happiness of the loved ones whom she
contributed to make uncomfortable, putting by all the tid-bits for them and
spending nothing on herself. Such a woman as Lisbeth, for exampleâat once
patient and complaining, self-renouncing and exacting, brooding the livelong
day over what happened yesterday and what is likely to happen to-morrow, and
crying very readily both at the good and the evil. But a certain awe mingled
itself with her idolatrous love of Adam, and when he said, âLeave me alone,â
she was always silenced.

So the hours passed, to the loud ticking of the old day-clock and the sound of
Adamâs tools. At last he called for a light and a draught of water (beer was a
thing only to be drunk on holidays), and Lisbeth ventured to say as she took it
in, âThy supper stanâs ready for thee, when thee likâst.â

âDonna thee sit up, mother,â said Adam, in a gentle tone. He had worked off his
anger now, and whenever he wished to be especially kind to his mother, he fell
into his strongest native accent and dialect, with which at other times his
speech was less deeply tinged. âIâll see to Father when he comes home; maybe he
wonna come at all to-night. I shall be easier if theeât iâ bed.â

âNay, Iâll bide till Seth comes. He wonna be long now, I reckon.â

It was then past nine by the clock, which was always in advance of the days,
and before it had struck ten the latch was lifted and Seth entered. He had
heard the sound of the tools as he was approaching.

âWhy, Mother,â he said, âhow is it as Fatherâs working so late?â

âItâs none oâ thy feyther as is a-workinââthee might know that well anoof if
thy head warna full oâ chapellinââitâs thy brother as does iverything, for
thereâs niver nobody else iâ thâ way to do nothinâ.â

Lisbeth was going on, for she was not at all afraid of Seth, and usually poured
into his ears all the querulousness which was repressed by her awe of Adam.
Seth had never in his life spoken a harsh word to his mother, and timid people
always wreak their peevishness on the gentle. But Seth, with an anxious look,
had passed into the workshop and said, âAddy, howâs this? What! Fatherâs forgot
the coffin?â

âAye, lad, thâ old tale; but I shall get it done,â said Adam, looking up and
casting one of his bright keen glances at his brother. âWhy, whatâs the matter
with thee? Theeât in trouble.â

Sethâs eyes were red, and there was a look of deep depression on his mild face.

âYes, Addy, but itâs what must be borne, and canât be helped. Why, theeâst
never been to the school, then?â

âSchool? No, that screw can wait,â said Adam, hammering away again.

âLet me take my turn now, and do thee go to bed,â said Seth.

âNo, lad, Iâd rather go on, now Iâm in harness. Theeât help me to carry it to
Broxâon when itâs done. Iâll call thee up at sunrise. Go and eat thy supper,
and shut the door so as I maynât hear Motherâs talk.â

Seth knew that Adam always meant what he said, and was not to be persuaded into
meaning anything else. So he turned, with rather a heavy heart, into the
house-place.

âAdamâs niver touched a bit oâ victual sinâ home heâs come,â said Lisbeth. âI
reckon theeâst hed thy supper at some oâ thy Methody folks.â

âNay, Mother,â said Seth, âIâve had no supper yet.â

âCome, then,â said Lisbeth, âbut donna thee ate the taters, for Adam âull
happen ate âem if I leave âem stanninâ. He loves a bit oâ taters anâ gravy. But
heâs been so sore anâ angered, he wouldnât ate âem, for all Iâd putten âem by
oâ purpose for him. Anâ heâs been a-threateninâ to go away again,â she went on,
whimpering, âanâ Iâm fast sure heâll go some dawninâ afore Iâm up, anâ niver
let me know aforehand, anâ heâll niver come back again when once heâs gone. Anâ
Iâd better niver haâ had a son, as is like no other bodyâs son for the deftness
anâ thâ handiness, anâ so looked on by thâ grit folks, anâ tall anâ upright
like a poplar-tree, anâ me to be parted from him anâ niver see âm no more.â

âCome, Mother, donna grieve thyself in vain,â said Seth, in a soothing voice.
âTheeâst not half so good reason to think as Adam âull go away as to think
heâll stay with thee. He may say such a thing when heâs in wrathâand heâs got
excuse for being wrathful sometimesâbut his heart âud never let him go. Think
how heâs stood by us all when itâs been none so easyâpaying his savings to free
me from going for a soldier, anâ turninâ his earninâs into wood for father,
when heâs got plenty oâ uses for his money, and many a young man like him âud
haâ been married and settled before now. Heâll never turn round and knock down
his own work, and forsake them as itâs been the labour of his life to stand
by.â

âDonna talk to me aboutâs marrâinâ,â said Lisbeth, crying afresh. âHeâs setâs
heart on that Hetty Sorrel, as âull niver save a penny, anâ âull toss up her
head atâs old mother. Anâ to think as he might haâ Mary Burge, anâ be took
partners, anâ be a big man wiâ workmen under him, like Mester BurgeâDollyâs
told me so oâer and oâer againâif it warna as heâs setâs heart on that bit of a
wench, as is oâ no more use nor the gillyflower on the wall. Anâ he so wise at
bookinâ anâ figurinâ, anâ not to know no better nor that!â

âBut, Mother, thee knowâst we canna love just where other folks âud have us.
Thereâs nobody but God can control the heart of man. I could haâ wished myself
as Adam could haâ made another choice, but I wouldnât reproach him for what he
canât help. And Iâm not sure but what he tries to oâercome it. But itâs a
matter as he doesnât like to be spoke to about, and I can only pray to the Lord
to bless and direct him.â

âAye, theeât allays ready enough at prayinâ, but I donna see as thee gets much
wiâ thy prayinâ. Thee wotna get double earninâs oâ this side Yule. Thâ
Methodies âll niver make thee half the man thy brother is, for all theyâre
a-makinâ a preacher on thee.â

âItâs partly truth thee speakâst there, Mother,â said Seth, mildly; âAdamâs far
before me, anâs done more for me than I can ever do for him. God distributes
talents to every man according as He sees good. But thee mustna undervally
prayer. Prayer mayna bring money, but it brings us what no money can buyâa
power to keep from sin and be content with Godâs will, whatever He may please
to send. If thee wouldst pray to God to help thee, and trust in His goodness,
thee wouldstna be so uneasy about things.â

âUnaisy? Iâm iâ thâ right onât to be unaisy. Itâs well seen on
thee
what
it is niver to be unaisy. Theeât giâ away all thy earninâs, anâ niver be unaisy
as theeâst nothinâ laid up againâ a rainy day. If Adam had been as aisy as
thee, heâd niver haâ had no money to pay for thee. Take no thought for the
morrowâtake no thoughtâthatâs what theeât allays sayinâ; anâ what comes onât?
Why, as Adam has to take thought for thee.â

âThose are the words oâ the Bible, Mother,â said Seth. âThey donât mean as we
should be idle. They mean we shouldnât be overanxious and worreting ourselves
about whatâll happen to-morrow, but do our duty and leave the rest to Godâs
will.â

âAye, aye, thatâs the way wiâ thee: thee allays makes a peck oâ thy own words
out oâ a pint oâ the Bibleâs. I donna see how theeât to know as âtake no
thought for the morrowâ means all that. Anâ when the Bibleâs such a big book,
anâ thee canst read all throât, anâ haâ the pick oâ the texes, I canna think
why thee dostna pick better words as donna mean so much more nor they say. Adam
doesna pick a thatân; I can understanâ the tex as heâs allays a-sayinâ, âGod
helps them as helps theirsens.ââ

âNay, Mother,â said Seth, âthatâs no text oâ the Bible. It comes out of a book
as Adam picked up at the stall at Treddlesâon. It was wrote by a knowing man,
but overworldly, I doubt. However, that sayingâs partly true; for the Bible
tells us we must be workers together with God.â

âWell, howâm I to know? It sounds like a tex. But whatâs thâ matter wiâ thâ
lad? Theeât hardly atinâ a bit oâ supper. Dostna mean to haâ no more nor that
bit oâ oat-cake? Anâ thee lookst as white as a flick oâ new bacon. Whatâs thâ
matter wiâ thee?â

âNothing to mind about, Mother; Iâm not hungry. Iâll just look in at Adam
again, and see if heâll let me go on with the coffin.â

âHaâ a drop oâ warm broth?â said Lisbeth, whose motherly feeling now got the
better of her ânatteringâ habit. âIâll set two-three sticks a-light in a
minute.â

âNay, Mother, thank thee; theeât very good,â said Seth, gratefully; and
encouraged by this touch of tenderness, he went on: âLet me pray a bit with
thee for Father, and Adam, and all of usâitâll comfort thee, happen, more than
thee thinkst.â

âWell, Iâve nothinâ to say againâ it.â

Lisbeth, though disposed always to take the negative side in her conversations
with Seth, had a vague sense that there was some comfort and safety in the fact
of his piety, and that it somehow relieved her from the trouble of any
spiritual transactions on her own behalf.

So the mother and son knelt down together, and Seth prayed for the poor
wandering father and for those who were sorrowing for him at home. And when he
came to the petition that Adam might never be called to set up his tent in a
far country, but that his mother might be cheered and comforted by his presence
all the days of her pilgrimage, Lisbethâs ready tears flowed again, and she
wept aloud.

When they rose from their knees, Seth went to Adam again and said, âWilt only
lie down for an hour or two, and let me go on the while?â

âNo, Seth, no. Make Mother go to bed, and go thyself.â

Meantime Lisbeth had dried her eyes, and now followed Seth, holding something
in her hands. It was the brown-and-yellow platter containing the baked potatoes
with the gravy in them and bits of meat which she had cut and mixed among them.
Those were dear times, when wheaten bread and fresh meat were delicacies to
working people. She set the dish down rather timidly on the bench by Adamâs
side and said, âThee canst pick a bit while theeât workinâ. Iâll bring thee
another drop oâ water.â

âAye, Mother, do,â said Adam, kindly; âIâm getting very thirsty.â

In half an hour all was quiet; no sound was to be heard in the house but the
loud ticking of the old day-clock and the ringing of Adamâs tools. The night
was very still: when Adam opened the door to look out at twelve oâclock, the
only motion seemed to be in the glowing, twinkling stars; every blade of grass
was asleep.

Bodily haste and exertion usually leave our thoughts very much at the mercy of
our feelings and imagination; and it was so to-night with Adam. While his
muscles were working lustily, his mind seemed as passive as a spectator at a
diorama: scenes of the sad past, and probably sad future, floating before him
and giving place one to the other in swift succession.

He saw how it would be to-morrow morning, when he had carried the coffin to
Broxton and was at home again, having his breakfast: his father perhaps would
come in ashamed to meet his sonâs glanceâwould sit down, looking older and more
tottering than he had done the morning before, and hang down his head,
examining the floor-quarries; while Lisbeth would ask him how he supposed the
coffin had been got ready, that he had slinked off and left undoneâfor Lisbeth
was always the first to utter the word of reproach, although she cried at
Adamâs severity towards his father.

âSo it will go on, worsening and worsening,â thought Adam; âthereâs no slipping
uphill again, and no standing still when once you âve begun to slip down.â And
then the day came back to him when he was a little fellow and used to run by
his fatherâs side, proud to be taken out to work, and prouder still to hear his
father boasting to his fellow-workmen how âthe little chap had an uncommon
notion oâ carpentering.â What a fine active fellow his father was then! When
people asked Adam whose little lad he was, he had a sense of distinction as he
answered, âIâm Thias Bedeâs lad.â He was quite sure everybody knew Thias
Bedeâdidnât he make the wonderful pigeon-house at Broxton parsonage? Those were
happy days, especially when Seth, who was three years the younger, began to go
out working too, and Adam began to be a teacher as well as a learner. But then
came the days of sadness, when Adam was someway on in his teens, and Thias
began to loiter at the public-houses, and Lisbeth began to cry at home, and to
pour forth her plaints in the hearing of her sons. Adam remembered well the
night of shame and anguish when he first saw his father quite wild and foolish,
shouting a song out fitfully among his drunken companions at the âWaggon
Overthrown.â He had run away once when he was only eighteen, making his escape
in the morning twilight with a little blue bundle over his shoulder, and his
âmensuration bookâ in his pocket, and saying to himself very decidedly that he
could bear the vexations of home no longerâhe would go and seek his fortune,
setting up his stick at the crossways and bending his steps the way it fell.
But by the time he got to Stoniton, the thought of his mother and Seth, left
behind to endure everything without him, became too importunate, and his
resolution failed him. He came back the next day, but the misery and terror his
mother had gone through in those two days had haunted her ever since.

âNo!â Adam said to himself to-night, âthat must never happen again. It âud make
a poor balance when my doings are cast up at the last, if my poor old mother
stood oâ the wrong side. My backâs broad enough and strong enough; I should be
no better than a coward to go away and leave the troubles to be borne by them
as arenât half so able. âThey that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of
those that are weak, and not to please themselves.â Thereâs a text wants no
candle to showât; it shines by its own light. Itâs plain enough you get into
the wrong road iâ this life if you run after this and that only for the sake oâ
making things easy and pleasant to yourself. A pig may poke his nose into the
trough and think oâ nothing outside it; but if youâve got a manâs heart and
soul in you, you canât be easy a-making your own bed anâ leaving the rest to
lie on the stones. Nay, nay, Iâll never slip my neck out oâ the yoke, and leave
the load to be drawn by the weak uns. Fatherâs a sore cross to me, anâs likely
to be for many a long year to come. What then? Iâve got thâ health, and the
limbs, and the sperrit to bear it.â

At this moment a smart rap, as if with a willow wand, was given at the house
door, and Gyp, instead of barking, as might have been expected, gave a loud
howl. Adam, very much startled, went at once to the door and opened it. Nothing
was there; all was still, as when he opened it an hour before; the leaves were
motionless, and the light of the stars showed the placid fields on both sides
of the brook quite empty of visible life. Adam walked round the house, and
still saw nothing except a rat which darted into the woodshed as he passed. He
went in again, wondering; the sound was so peculiar that the moment he heard it
it called up the image of the willow wand striking the door. He could not help
a little shudder, as he remembered how often his mother had told him of just
such a sound coming as a sign when some one was dying. Adam was not a man to be
gratuitously superstitious, but he had the blood of the peasant in him as well
as of the artisan, and a peasant can no more help believing in a traditional
superstition than a horse can help trembling when he sees a camel. Besides, he
had that mental combination which is at once humble in the region of mystery
and keen in the region of knowledge: it was the depth of his reverence quite as
much as his hard common sense which gave him his disinclination to doctrinal
religion, and he often checked Sethâs argumentative spiritualism by saying,
âEh, itâs a big mystery; thee knowâst but little about it.â And so it happened
that Adam was at once penetrating and credulous. If a new building had fallen
down and he had been told that this was a divine judgment, he would have said,
âMay be; but the bearing oâ the roof and walls wasnât right, else it wouldnât
haâ come downâ; yet he believed in dreams and prognostics, and to his dying day
he bated his breath a little when he told the story of the stroke with the
willow wand. I tell it as he told it, not attempting to reduce it to its
natural elementsâin our eagerness to explain impressions, we often lose our
hold of the sympathy that comprehends them.

But he had the best antidote against imaginative dread in the necessity for
getting on with the coffin, and for the next ten minutes his hammer was ringing
so uninterruptedly, that other sounds, if there were any, might well be
overpowered. A pause came, however, when he had to take up his ruler, and now
again came the strange rap, and again Gyp howled. Adam was at the door without
the loss of a moment; but again all was still, and the starlight showed there
was nothing but the dew-laden grass in front of the cottage.

Adam for a moment thought uncomfortably about his father; but of late years he
had never come home at dark hours from Treddleston, and there was every reason
for believing that he was then sleeping off his drunkenness at the âWaggon
Overthrown.â Besides, to Adam, the conception of the future was so inseparable
from the painful image of his father that the fear of any fatal accident to him
was excluded by the deeply infixed fear of his continual degradation. The next
thought that occurred to him was one that made him slip off his shoes and tread
lightly upstairs, to listen at the bedroom doors. But both Seth and his mother
were breathing regularly.

Adam came down and set to work again, saying to himself, âI wonât open the door
again. Itâs no use staring about to catch sight of a sound. Maybe thereâs a
world about us as we canât see, but thâ earâs quicker than the eye and catches
a sound fromât now and then. Some people think they get a sight onât too, but
theyâre mostly folks whose eyes are not much use to âem at anything else. For
my part, I think itâs better to see when your perpendicularâs true than to see
a ghost.â

Such thoughts as these are apt to grow stronger and stronger as daylight
quenches the candles and the birds begin to sing. By the time the red sunlight
shone on the brass nails that formed the initials on the lid of the coffin, any
lingering foreboding from the sound of the willow wand was merged in
satisfaction that the work was done and the promise redeemed. There was no need
to call Seth, for he was already moving overhead, and presently came
downstairs.

âNow, lad,â said Adam, as Seth made his appearance, âthe coffinâs done, and we
can take it over to Broxâon, and be back again before half after six. Iâll take
a mouthful oâ oat-cake, and then weâll be off.â

The coffin was soon propped on the tall shoulders of the two brothers, and they
were making their way, followed close by Gyp, out of the little woodyard into
the lane at the back of the house. It was but about a mile and a half to
Broxton over the opposite slope, and their road wound very pleasantly along
lanes and across fields, where the pale woodbines and the dog-roses were
scenting the hedgerows, and the birds were twittering and trilling in the tall
leafy boughs of oak and elm. It was a strangely mingled pictureâthe fresh youth
of the summer morning, with its Edenlike peace and loveliness, the stalwart
strength of the two brothers in their rusty working clothes, and the long
coffin on their shoulders. They paused for the last time before a small
farmhouse outside the village of Broxton. By six oâclock the task was done, the
coffin nailed down, and Adam and Seth were on their way home. They chose a
shorter way homewards, which would take them across the fields and the brook in
front of the house. Adam had not mentioned to Seth what had happened in the
night, but he still retained sufficient impression from it himself to say,
âSeth, lad, if Father isnât come home by the time weâve had our breakfast, I
think itâll be as well for thee to go over to Treddlesâon and look after him,
and thee canst get me the brass wire I want. Never mind about losing an hour at
thy work; we can make that up. What dost say?â

âIâm willing,â said Seth. âBut see what clouds have gathered since we set out.
Iâm thinking we shall have more rain. Itâll be a sore time for thâ haymaking if
the meadows are flooded again. The brookâs fine and full now: another dayâs
rain âud cover the plank, and we should have to go round by the road.â

They were coming across the valley now, and had entered the pasture through
which the brook ran.

âWhy, whatâs that sticking against the willow?â continued Seth, beginning to
walk faster. Adamâs heart rose to his mouth: the vague anxiety about his father
was changed into a great dread. He made no answer to Seth, but ran forward
preceded by Gyp, who began to bark uneasily; and in two moments he was at the
bridge.

This was what the omen meant, then! And the grey-haired father, of whom he had
thought with a sort of hardness a few hours ago, as certain to live to be a
thorn in his side was perhaps even then struggling with that watery death! This
was the first thought that flashed through Adamâs conscience, before he had
time to seize the coat and drag out the tall heavy body. Seth was already by
his side, helping him, and when they had it on the bank, the two sons in the
first moment knelt and looked with mute awe at the glazed eyes, forgetting that
there was need for actionâforgetting everything but that their father lay dead
before them. Adam was the first to speak.

âIâll run to Mother,â he said, in a loud whisper. âIâll be back to thee in a
minute.â

Poor Lisbeth was busy preparing her sonsâ breakfast, and their porridge was
already steaming on the fire. Her kitchen always looked the pink of
cleanliness, but this morning she was more than usually bent on making her
hearth and breakfast-table look comfortable and inviting.

âThe lads âull be fine anâ hungry,â she said, half-aloud, as she stirred the
porridge. âItâs a good step to Broxâon, anâ itâs hungry air oâer the hillâwiâ
that heavy coffin too. Eh! Itâs heavier now, wiâ poor Bob Tholer inât. Howiver,
Iâve made a drap more porridge nor common this morninâ. The feyther âull happen
come in arter a bit. Not as heâll ate much porridge. He swallers sixpennâorth
oâ ale, anâ saves a hapâorth oâ por-ridgeâthatâs his way oâ layinâ by money, as
Iâve told him many a time, anâ am likely to tell him again afore the dayâs out.
Eh, poor mon, he takes it quiet enough; thereâs no denyinâ that.â

But now Lisbeth heard the heavy âthudâ of a running footstep on the turf, and,
turning quickly towards the door, she saw Adam enter, looking so pale and
overwhelmed that she screamed aloud and rushed towards him before he had time
to speak.

âHush, Mother,â Adam said, rather hoarsely, âdonât be frightened. Fatherâs
tumbled into the water. Belike we may bring him round again. Seth and me are
going to carry him in. Get a blanket and make it hot as the fire.â

In reality Adam was convinced that his father was dead but he knew there was no
other way of repressing his motherâs impetuous wailing grief than by occupying
her with some active task which had hope in it.

He ran back to Seth, and the two sons lifted the sad burden in heart-stricken
silence. The wide-open glazed eyes were grey, like Sethâs, and had once looked
with mild pride on the boys before whom Thias had lived to hang his head in
shame. Sethâs chief feeling was awe and distress at this sudden snatching away
of his fatherâs soul; but Adamâs mind rushed back over the past in a flood of
relenting and pity. When death, the great Reconciler, has come, it is never our
tenderness that we repent of, but our severity.

Chapter V

The Rector

Before twelve oâclock there had been some heavy storms of rain, and the water
lay in deep gutters on the sides of the gravel walks in the garden of Broxton
Parsonage; the great Provence roses had been cruelly tossed by the wind and
beaten by the rain, and all the delicate-stemmed border flowers had been dashed
down and stained with the wet soil. A melancholy morningâbecause it was nearly
time hay-harvest should begin, and instead of that the meadows were likely to
be flooded.

But people who have pleasant homes get indoor enjoyments that they would never
think of but for the rain. If it had not been a wet morning, Mr. Irwine would
not have been in the dining-room playing at chess with his mother, and he loves
both his mother and chess quite well enough to pass some cloudy hours very
easily by their help. Let me take you into that dining-room and show you the
Rev. Adolphus Irwine, Rector of Broxton, Vicar of Hayslope, and Vicar of
Blythe, a pluralist at whom the severest Church reformer would have found it
difficult to look sour. We will enter very softly and stand still in the open
doorway, without awaking the glossy-brown setter who is stretched across the
hearth, with her two puppies beside her; or the pug, who is dozing, with his
black muzzle aloft, like a sleepy president.

The room is a large and lofty one, with an ample mullioned oriel window at one
end; the walls, you see, are new, and not yet painted; but the furniture,
though originally of an expensive sort, is old and scanty, and there is no
drapery about the window. The crimson cloth over the large dining-table is very
threadbare, though it contrasts pleasantly enough with the dead hue of the
plaster on the walls; but on this cloth there is a massive silver waiter with a
decanter of water on it, of the same pattern as two larger ones that are
propped up on the sideboard with a coat of arms conspicuous in their centre.
You suspect at once that the inhabitants of this room have inherited more blood
than wealth, and would not be surprised to find that Mr. Irwine had a finely
cut nostril and upper lip; but at present we can only see that he has a broad
flat back and an abundance of powdered hair, all thrown backward and tied
behind with a black ribbonâa bit of conservatism in costume which tells you
that he is not a young man. He will perhaps turn round by and by, and in the
meantime we can look at that stately old lady, his mother, a beautiful aged
brunette, whose rich-toned complexion is well set off by the complex wrappings
of pure white cambric and lace about her head and neck. She is as erect in her
comely embonpoint as a statue of Ceres; and her dark face, with its delicate
aquiline nose, firm proud mouth, and small, intense, black eye, is so keen and
sarcastic in its expression that you instinctively substitute a pack of cards
for the chess-men and imagine her telling your fortune. The small brown hand
with which she is lifting her queen is laden with pearls, diamonds, and
turquoises; and a large black veil is very carefully adjusted over the crown of
her cap, and falls in sharp contrast on the white folds about her neck. It must
take a long time to dress that old lady in the morning! But it seems a law of
nature that she should be dressed so: she is clearly one of those children of
royalty who have never doubted their right divine and never met with any one so
absurd as to question it.

âThere, Dauphin, tell me what that is!â says this magnificent old lady, as she
deposits her queen very quietly and folds her arms. âI should be sorry to utter
a word disagreeable to your feelings.â

âAh, you witch-mother, you sorceress! How is a Christian man to win a game off
you? I should have sprinkled the board with holy water before we began. Youâve
not won that game by fair means, now, so donât pretend it.â

âYes, yes, thatâs what the beaten have always said of great conquerors. But
see, thereâs the sunshine falling on the board, to show you more clearly what a
foolish move you made with that pawn. Come, shall I give you another chance?â

âNo, Mother, I shall leave you to your own conscience, now itâs clearing up. We
must go and plash up the mud a little, musânât we, Juno?â This was addressed to
the brown setter, who had jumped up at the sound of the voices and laid her
nose in an insinuating way on her masterâs leg. âBut I must go upstairs first
and see Anne. I was called away to Tholerâs funeral just when I was going
before.â

âItâs of no use, child; she canât speak to you. Kate says she has one of her
worst headaches this morning.â

âOh, she likes me to go and see her just the same; sheâs never too ill to care
about that.â

If you know how much of human speech is mere purposeless impulse or habit, you
will not wonder when I tell you that this identical objection had been made,
and had received the same kind of answer, many hundred times in the course of
the fifteen years that Mr. Irwineâs sister Anne had been an invalid. Splendid
old ladies, who take a long time to dress in the morning, have often slight
sympathy with sickly daughters.

But while Mr. Irwine was still seated, leaning back in his chair and stroking
Junoâs head, the servant came to the door and said, âIf you please, sir, Joshua
Rann wishes to speak with you, if you are at liberty.â

âLet him be shown in here,â said Mrs. Irwine, taking up her knitting. âI always
like to hear what Mr. Rann has got to say. His shoes will be dirty, but see
that he wipes them Carroll.â

In two minutes Mr. Rann appeared at the door with very deferential bows, which,
however, were far from conciliating Pug, who gave a sharp bark and ran across
the room to reconnoitre the strangerâs legs; while the two puppies, regarding
Mr. Rannâs prominent calf and ribbed worsted stockings from a more sensuous
point of view, plunged and growled over them in great enjoyment. Meantime, Mr.
Irwine turned round his chair and said, âWell, Joshua, anything the matter at
Hayslope, that youâve come over this damp morning? Sit down, sit down. Never
mind the dogs; give them a friendly kick. Here, Pug, you rascal!â

It is very pleasant to see some men turn round; pleasant as a sudden rush of
warm air in winter, or the flash of firelight in the chill dusk. Mr. Irwine was
one of those men. He bore the same sort of resemblance to his mother that our
loving memory of a friendâs face often bears to the face itself: the lines were
all more generous, the smile brighter, the expression heartier. If the outline
had been less finely cut, his face might have been called jolly; but that was
not the right word for its mixture of bonhomie and distinction.

âThank Your Reverence,â answered Mr. Rann, endeavouring to look unconcerned
about his legs, but shaking them alternately to keep off the puppies; âIâll
stand, if you please, as more becoming. I hope I see you anâ Mrs. Irwine well,
anâ Miss Irwineâanâ Miss Anne, I hopeâs as well as usual.â

âYes, Joshua, thank you. You see how blooming my mother looks. She beats us
younger people hollow. But whatâs the matter?â

âWhy, sir, I had to come to Broxâon to deliver some work, and I thought it but
right to call and let you know the goins-on as thereâs been iâ the village,
such as I hanna seen iâ my time, and Iâve lived in it man and boy sixty year
come St. Thomas, and collected thâ Easter dues for Mr. Blick before Your
Reverence come into the parish, and been at the ringinâ oâ every bell, and the
digginâ oâ every grave, and sung iâ the choir long afore Bartle Massey come
from nobody knows where, wiâ his counter-singinâ and fine anthems, as puts
everybody out but himselfâone takinâ it up after another like sheep a-bleatinâ
iâ thâ fold. I know what belongs to beinâ a parish clerk, and I know as I
should be wantinâ iâ respect to Your Reverence, anâ church, anâ king, if I was
tâ allow such goins-on wiâout speakinâ. I was took by surprise, anâ knowed
nothinâ on it beforehand, anâ I was so flustered, I was clean as if Iâd lost my
tools. I hanna slepâ more nor four hour this night as is past anâ gone; anâ
then it was nothinâ but nightmare, as tired me worse nor wakinâ.â

âWhy, what in the world is the matter, Joshua? Have the thieves been at the
church lead again?â

âThieves! No, sirâanâ yet, as I may say, it
is
thieves, anâ a-thievinâ
the church, too. Itâs the Methodisses as is like to get thâ upper hand iâ thâ
parish, if Your Reverence anâ His Honour, Squire Donnithorne, doesna think well
to say the word anâ forbid it. Not as Iâm a-dictatinâ to you, sir; Iâm not
forgettinâ myself so far as to be wise above my betters. Howiver, whether Iâm
wise or no, thatâs neither here nor there, but what Iâve got to say I sayâas
the young Methodis woman as is at Mester Poyserâs was a-preachinâ anâ a-prayinâ
on the Green last night, as sure as Iâm a-stanninâ afore Your Reverence now.â

âPreaching on the Green!â said Mr. Irwine, looking surprised but quite serene.
âWhat, that pale pretty young woman Iâve seen at Poyserâs? I saw she was a
Methodist, or Quaker, or something of that sort, by her dress, but I didnât
know she was a preacher.â

âItâs a true word as I say, sir,â rejoined Mr. Rann, compressing his mouth into
a semicircular form and pausing long enough to indicate three notes of
exclamation. âShe preached on the Green last night; anâ sheâs laid hold of
Chadâs Bess, as the girlâs been iâ fits welly iver sinâ.â

âWell, Bessy Cranage is a hearty-looking lass; I daresay sheâll come round
again, Joshua. Did anybody else go into fits?â

âNo, sir, I canna say as they did. But thereâs no knowinâ whatâll come, if
weâre tâ have such preachinâs as that a-goinâ on ivery weekâthereâll be no
livinâ iâ thâ village. For them Methodisses make folks believe as if they take
a mug oâ drink extry, anâ make theirselves a bit comfortable, theyâll have to
go to hell forât as sure as theyâre born. Iâm not a tipplinâ man nor a
drunkardânobody can say it on meâbut I like a extry quart at Easter or
Christmas time, as is natâral when weâre goinâ the rounds a-singinâ, anâ folks
offerât you for nothinâ; or when Iâm a-collectinâ the dues; anâ I like a pint
wiâ my pipe, anâ a neighbourly chat at Mester Cassonâs now anâ then, for I was
brought up iâ the Church, thank God, anâ haâ been a parish clerk this
two-anâ-thirty year: I should know what the church religion is.â

âWell, whatâs your advice, Joshua? What do you think should be done?â

âWell, Your Reverence, Iâm not for takinâ any measures againâ the young woman.
Sheâs well enough if sheâd let alone preachinâ; anâ I hear as sheâs a-goinâ
away back to her own country soon. Sheâs Mr. Poyserâs own niece, anâ I donna
wish to say whatâs anyways disrespectful oâ thâ family at thâ Hall Farm, as
Iâve measured for shoes, little anâ big, welly iver sinâ Iâve been a shoemaker.
But thereâs that Will Maskery, sir as is the rampageousest Methodis as can be,
anâ I make no doubt it was him as stirred up thâ young woman to preach last
night, anâ heâll be a-bringinâ other folks to preach from Treddlesâon, if his
comb isnât cut a bit; anâ I think as he should be let know as he isna tâ have
the makinâ anâ mendinâ oâ church carts anâ implemenâs, let alone stayinâ iâ
that house anâ yard as is Squire Donnithorneâs.â

âWell, but you say yourself, Joshua, that you never knew any one come to preach
on the Green before; why should you think theyâll come again? The Methodists
donât come to preach in little villages like Hayslope, where thereâs only a
handful of labourers, too tired to listen to them. They might almost as well go
and preach on the Binton Hills. Will Maskery is no preacher himself, I think.â

âNay, sir, heâs no gift at stringinâ the words together wiâout book; heâd be
stuck fast like a cow iâ wet clay. But heâs got tongue enough to speak
disrespectful aboutâs neebors, for he said as I was a blind Phariseeâa-usinâ
the Bible iâ that way to find nick-names for folks as are his elders anâ
betters!âand whatâs worse, heâs been heard to say very unbecominâ words about
Your Reverence; for I could bring them as âud swear as he called you a âdumb
dog,â anâ a âidle shepherd.â Youâll forgiâe me for sayinâ such things over
again.â

âBetter not, better not, Joshua. Let evil words die as soon as theyâre spoken.
Will Maskery might be a great deal worse fellow than he is. He used to be a
wild drunken rascal, neglecting his work and beating his wife, they told me;
now heâs thrifty and decent, and he and his wife look comfortable together. If
you can bring me any proof that he interferes with his neighbours and creates
any disturbance, I shall think it my duty as a clergyman and a magistrate to
interfere. But it wouldnât become wise people like you and me to be making a
fuss about trifles, as if we thought the Church was in danger because Will
Maskery lets his tongue wag rather foolishly, or a young woman talks in a
serious way to a handful of people on the Green. We must âlive and let live,â
Joshua, in religion as well as in other things. You go on doing your duty, as
parish clerk and sexton, as well as youâve always done it, and making those
capital thick boots for your neighbours, and things wonât go far wrong in
Hayslope, depend upon it.â

âYour Reverence is very good to say so; anâ Iâm sensable as, you not livinâ iâ
the parish, thereâs more upoâ my shoulders.â

âTo be sure; and you must mind and not lower the Church in peopleâs eyes by
seeming to be frightened about it for a little thing, Joshua. I shall trust to
your good sense, now to take no notice at all of what Will Maskery says, either
about you or me. You and your neighbours can go on taking your pot of beer
soberly, when youâve done your dayâs work, like good churchmen; and if Will
Maskery doesnât like to join you, but to go to a prayer-meeting at Treddleston
instead, let him; thatâs no business of yours, so long as he doesnât hinder you
from doing what you like. And as to people saying a few idle words about us, we
must not mind that, any more than the old church-steeple minds the rooks cawing
about it. Will Maskery comes to church every Sunday afternoon, and does his
wheelwrightâs business steadily in the weekdays, and as long as he does that he
must be let alone.â

âAh, sir, but when he comes to church, he sits anâ shakes his head, anâ looks
as sour anâ as coxy when weâre a-singinâ as I should like to fetch him a rap
across the jowlâGod forgiâe meâanâ Mrs. Irwine, anâ Your Reverence too, for
speakinâ so afore you. Anâ he said as our Christmas singinâ was no better nor
the cracklinâ oâ thorns under a pot.â

âWell, heâs got a bad ear for music, Joshua. When people have wooden heads, you
know, it canât be helped. He wonât bring the other people in Hayslope round to
his opinion, while you go on singing as well as you do.â

âYes, sir, but it turns a manâs stomach tâ hear the Scripture misused iâ that
way. I know as much oâ the words oâ the Bible as he does, anâ could say the
Psalms right through iâ my sleep if you was to pinch me; but I know better nor
to take âem to say my own say wiâ. I might as well take the Sacriment-cup home
and use it at meals.â

âThatâs a very sensible remark of yours, Joshua; but, as I said beforeâââ

While Mr. Irwine was speaking, the sound of a booted step and the clink of a
spur were heard on the stone floor of the entrance-hall, and Joshua Rann moved
hastily aside from the doorway to make room for some one who paused there, and
said, in a ringing tenor voice,

âGodson Arthurâmay he come in?â

âCome in, come in, godson!â Mrs. Irwine answered, in the deep half-masculine
tone which belongs to the vigorous old woman, and there entered a young
gentleman in a riding-dress, with his right arm in a sling; whereupon followed
that pleasant confusion of laughing interjections, and hand-shakings, and âHow
are youâs?â mingled with joyous short barks and wagging of tails on the part of
the canine members of the family, which tells that the visitor is on the best
terms with the visited. The young gentleman was Arthur Donnithorne, known in
Hayslope, variously, as âthe young squire,â âthe heir,â and âthe captain.â He
was only a captain in the Loamshire Militia, but to the Hayslope tenants he was
more intensely a captain than all the young gentlemen of the same rank in his
Majestyâs regularsâhe outshone them as the planet Jupiter outshines the Milky
Way. If you want to know more particularly how he looked, call to your
remembrance some tawny-whiskered, brown-locked, clear-complexioned young
Englishman whom you have met with in a foreign town, and been proud of as a
fellow-countrymanâwell-washed, high-bred, white-handed, yet looking as if he
could deliver well from the left shoulder and floor his man: I will not be so
much of a tailor as to trouble your imagination with the difference of costume,
and insist on the striped waistcoat, long-tailed coat, and low top-boots.

Turning round to take a chair, Captain Donnithorne said, âBut donât let me
interrupt Joshuaâs businessâhe has something to say.â

âHumbly begging Your Honourâs pardon,â said Joshua, bowing low, âthere was one
thing I had to say to His Reverence as other things had drove out oâ my head.â

âOut with it, Joshua, quickly!â said Mr. Irwine.

âBelike, sir, you havena heared as Thias Bedeâs deadâdrownded this morning, or
more like overnight, iâ the Willow Brook, againâ the bridge right iâ front oâ
the house.â

âAh!â exclaimed both the gentlemen at once, as if they were a good deal
interested in the information.

âAnâ Seth Bedeâs been to me this morning to say he wished me to tell Your
Reverence as his brother Adam begged of you particular tâ allow his fatherâs
grave to be dug by the White Thorn, because his motherâs set her heart on it,
on account of a dream as she had; anâ theyâd haâ come theirselves to ask you,
but theyâve so much to see after with the crowner, anâ that; anâ their motherâs
took on so, anâ wants âem to make sure oâ the spot for fear somebody else
should take it. Anâ if Your Reverence sees well and good, Iâll send my boy to
tell âem as soon as I get home; anâ thatâs why I make bold to trouble you wiâ
it, His Honour being present.â

âTo be sure, Joshua, to be sure, they shall have it. Iâll ride round to Adam
myself, and see him. Send your boy, however, to say they shall have the grave,
lest anything should happen to detain me. And now, good morning, Joshua; go
into the kitchen and have some ale.â

âPoor old Thias!â said Mr. Irwine, when Joshua was gone. âIâm afraid the drink
helped the brook to drown him. I should have been glad for the load to have
been taken off my friend Adamâs shoulders in a less painful way. That fine
fellow has been propping up his father from ruin for the last five or six
years.â

âHeâs a regular trump, is Adam,â said Captain Donnithorne. âWhen I was a little
fellow, and Adam was a strapping lad of fifteen, and taught me carpentering, I
used to think if ever I was a rich sultan, I would make Adam my grand-vizier.
And I believe now he would bear the exaltation as well as any poor wise man in
an Eastern story. If ever I live to be a large-acred man instead of a poor
devil with a mortgaged allowance of pocket-money, Iâll have Adam for my right
hand. He shall manage my woods for me, for he seems to have a better notion of
those things than any man I ever met with; and I know he would make twice the
money of them that my grandfather does, with that miserable old Satchell to
manage, who understands no more about timber than an old carp. Iâve mentioned
the subject to my grandfather once or twice, but for some reason or other he
has a dislike to Adam, and
I
can do nothing. But come, Your Reverence,
are you for a ride with me? Itâs splendid out of doors now. We can go to Adamâs
together, if you like; but I want to call at the Hall Farm on my way, to look
at the whelps Poyser is keeping for me.â

âYou must stay and have lunch first, Arthur,â said Mrs. Irwine. âItâs nearly
two. Carroll will bring it in directly.â

âI want to go to the Hall Farm too,â said Mr. Irwine, âto have another look at
the little Methodist who is staying there. Joshua tells me she was preaching on
the Green last night.â

âOh, by Jove!â said Captain Donnithorne, laughing. âWhy, she looks as quiet as
a mouse. Thereâs something rather striking about her, though. I positively felt
quite bashful the first time I saw herâshe was sitting stooping over her sewing
in the sunshine outside the house, when I rode up and called out, without
noticing that she was a stranger, âIs Martin Poyser at home?â I declare, when
she got up and looked at me and just said, âHeâs in the house, I believe: Iâll
go and call him,â I felt quite ashamed of having spoken so abruptly to her. She
looked like St. Catherine in a Quaker dress. Itâs a type of face one rarely
sees among our common people.â

âI should like to see the young woman, Dauphin,â said Mrs. Irwine. âMake her
come here on some pretext or other.â

âI donât know how I can manage that, Mother; it will hardly do for me to
patronize a Methodist preacher, even if she would consent to be patronized by
an idle shepherd, as Will Maskery calls me. You should have come in a little
sooner, Arthur, to hear Joshuaâs denunciation of his neighbour Will Maskery.
The old fellow wants me to excommunicate the wheelwright, and then deliver him
over to the civil armâthat is to say, to your grandfatherâto be turned out of
house and yard. If I chose to interfere in this business, now, I might get up
as pretty a story of hatred and persecution as the Methodists need desire to
publish in the next number of their magazine. It wouldnât take me much trouble
to persuade Chad Cranage and half a dozen other bull-headed fellows that they
would be doing an acceptable service to the Church by hunting Will Maskery out
of the village with rope-ends and pitchforks; and then, when I had furnished
them with half a sovereign to get gloriously drunk after their exertions, I
should have put the climax to as pretty a farce as any of my brother clergy
have set going in their parishes for the last thirty years.â

âIt is really insolent of the man, though, to call you an âidle shepherdâ and a
âdumb dog,ââ said Mrs. Irwine. âI should be inclined to check him a little
there. You are too easy-tempered, Dauphin.â

âWhy, Mother, you donât think it would be a good way of sustaining my dignity
to set about vindicating myself from the aspersions of Will Maskery? Besides,
Iâm not so sure that they
are
aspersions. I
am
a lazy fellow, and
get terribly heavy in my saddle; not to mention that Iâm always spending more
than I can afford in bricks and mortar, so that I get savage at a lame beggar
when he asks me for sixpence. Those poor lean cobblers, who think they can help
to regenerate mankind by setting out to preach in the morning twilight before
they begin their dayâs work, may well have a poor opinion of me. But come, let
us have our luncheon. Isnât Kate coming to lunch?â

âMiss Irwine told Bridget to take her lunch upstairs,â said Carroll; âshe canât
leave Miss Anne.â

âOh, very well. Tell Bridget to say Iâll go up and see Miss Anne presently. You
can use your right arm quite well now, Arthur,â Mr. Irwine continued, observing
that Captain Donnithorne had taken his arm out of the sling.

âYes, pretty well; but Godwin insists on my keeping it up constantly for some
time to come. I hope I shall be able to get away to the regiment, though, in
the beginning of August. Itâs a desperately dull business being shut up at the
Chase in the summer months, when one can neither hunt nor shoot, so as to make
oneâs self pleasantly sleepy in the evening. However, we are to astonish the
echoes on the 30th of July. My grandfather has given me
carte blanche

for once, and I promise you the entertainment shall be worthy of the occasion.
The world will not see the grand epoch of my majority twice. I think I shall
have a lofty throne for you, Godmamma, or rather two, one on the lawn and
another in the ballroom, that you may sit and look down upon us like an
Olympian goddess.â

âI mean to bring out my best brocade, that I wore at your christening twenty
years ago,â said Mrs. Irwine. âAh, I think I shall see your poor mother
flitting about in her white dress, which looked to me almost like a shroud that
very day; and it
was
her shroud only three months after; and your little
cap and christening dress were buried with her too. She had set her heart on
that, sweet soul! Thank God you take after your motherâs family, Arthur. If you
had been a puny, wiry, yellow baby, I wouldnât have stood godmother to you. I
should have been sure you would turn out a Donnithorne. But you were such a
broad-faced, broad-chested, loud-screaming rascal, I knew you were every inch
of you a Tradgett.â

âBut you might have been a little too hasty there, Mother,â said Mr. Irwine,
smiling. âDonât you remember how it was with Junoâs last pups? One of them was
the very image of its mother, but it had two or three of its fatherâs tricks
notwithstanding. Nature is clever enough to cheat even you, Mother.â

âNonsense, child! Nature never makes a ferret in the shape of a mastiff. Youâll
never persuade me that I canât tell what men are by their outsides. If I donât
like a manâs looks, depend upon it I shall never like
him
. I donât want
to know people that look ugly and disagreeable, any more than I want to taste
dishes that look disagreeable. If they make me shudder at the first glance, I
say, take them away. An ugly, piggish, or fishy eye, now, makes me feel quite
ill; itâs like a bad smell.â

âTalking of eyes,â said Captain Donnithorne, âthat reminds me that Iâve got a
book I meant to bring you, Godmamma. It came down in a parcel from London the
other day. I know you are fond of queer, wizardlike stories. Itâs a volume of
poems, âLyrical Ballads.â Most of them seem to be twaddling stuff, but the
first is in a different styleââThe Ancient Marinerâ is the title. I can hardly
make head or tail of it as a story, but itâs a strange, striking thing. Iâll
send it over to you; and there are some other books that
you
may like to
see, Irwineâpamphlets about Antinomianism and Evangelicalism, whatever they may
be. I canât think what the fellow means by sending such things to me. Iâve
written to him to desire that from henceforth he will send me no book or
pamphlet on anything that ends in
ism
.â

âWell, I donât know that Iâm very fond of
isms
myself; but I may as well
look at the pamphlets; they let one see what is going on. Iâve a little matter
to attend to, Arthur,â continued Mr. Irwine, rising to leave the room, âand
then I shall be ready to set out with you.â

The little matter that Mr. Irwine had to attend to took him up the old stone
staircase (part of the house was very old) and made him pause before a door at
which he knocked gently. âCome in,â said a womanâs voice, and he entered a room
so darkened by blinds and curtains that Miss Kate, the thin middle-aged lady
standing by the bedside, would not have had light enough for any other sort of
work than the knitting which lay on the little table near her. But at present
she was doing what required only the dimmest lightâsponging the aching head
that lay on the pillow with fresh vinegar. It was a small face, that of the
poor sufferer; perhaps it had once been pretty, but now it was worn and sallow.
Miss Kate came towards her brother and whispered, âDonât speak to her; she
canât bear to be spoken to to-day.â Anneâs eyes were closed, and her brow
contracted as if from intense pain. Mr. Irwine went to the bedside and took up
one of the delicate hands and kissed it, a slight pressure from the small
fingers told him that it was worth-while to have come upstairs for the sake of
doing that. He lingered a moment, looking at her, and then turned away and left
the room, treading very gentlyâhe had taken off his boots and put on slippers
before he came upstairs. Whoever remembers how many things he has declined to
do even for himself, rather than have the trouble of putting on or taking off
his boots, will not think this last detail insignificant.

And Mr. Irwineâs sisters, as any person of family within ten miles of Broxton
could have testified, were such stupid, uninteresting women! It was quite a
pity handsome, clever Mrs. Irwine should have had such commonplace daughters.
That fine old lady herself was worth driving ten miles to see, any day; her
beauty, her well-preserved faculties, and her old-fashioned dignity made her a
graceful subject for conversation in turn with the Kingâs health, the sweet new
patterns in cotton dresses, the news from Egypt, and Lord Daceyâs lawsuit,
which was fretting poor Lady Dacey to death. But no one ever thought of
mentioning the Miss Irwines, except the poor people in Broxton village, who
regarded them as deep in the science of medicine, and spoke of them vaguely as
âthe gentlefolks.â If any one had asked old Job Dummilow who gave him his
flannel jacket, he would have answered, âthe gentlefolks, last winterâ; and
widow Steene dwelt much on the virtues of the âstuffâ the gentlefolks gave her
for her cough. Under this name too, they were used with great effect as a means
of taming refractory children, so that at the sight of poor Miss Anneâs sallow
face, several small urchins had a terrified sense that she was cognizant of all
their worst misdemeanours, and knew the precise number of stones with which
they had intended to hit Farmer Brittonâs ducks. But for all who saw them
through a less mythical medium, the Miss Irwines were quite superfluous
existencesâinartistic figures crowding the canvas of life without adequate
effect. Miss Anne, indeed, if her chronic headaches could have been accounted
for by a pathetic story of disappointed love, might have had some romantic
interest attached to her: but no such story had either been known or invented
concerning her, and the general impression was quite in accordance with the
fact, that both the sisters were old maids for the prosaic reason that they had
never received an eligible offer.

Nevertheless, to speak paradoxically, the existence of insignificant people has
very important consequences in the world. It can be shown to affect the price
of bread and the rate of wages, to call forth many evil tempers from the
selfish and many heroisms from the sympathetic, and, in other ways, to play no
small part in the tragedy of life. And if that handsome, generous-blooded
clergyman, the Rev. Adolphus Irwine, had not had these two hopelessly maiden
sisters, his lot would have been shaped quite differently: he would very likely
have taken a comely wife in his youth, and now, when his hair was getting grey
under the powder, would have had tall sons and blooming daughtersâsuch
possessions, in short, as men commonly think will repay them for all the labour
they take under the sun. As it wasâhaving with all his three livings no more
than seven hundred a-year, and seeing no way of keeping his splendid mother and
his sickly sister, not to reckon a second sister, who was usually spoken of
without any adjective, in such ladylike ease as became their birth and habits,
and at the same time providing for a family of his ownâhe remained, you see, at
the age of eight-and-forty, a bachelor, not making any merit of that
renunciation, but saying laughingly, if any one alluded to it, that he made it
an excuse for many indulgences which a wife would never have allowed him. And
perhaps he was the only person in the world who did not think his sisters
uninteresting and superfluous; for his was one of those large-hearted,
sweet-blooded natures that never know a narrow or a grudging thought;
Epicurean, if you will, with no enthusiasm, no self-scourging sense of duty;
but yet, as you have seen, of a sufficiently subtle moral fibre to have an
unwearying tenderness for obscure and monotonous suffering. It was his
large-hearted indulgence that made him ignore his motherâs hardness towards her
daughters, which was the more striking from its contrast with her doting
fondness towards himself; he held it no virtue to frown at irremediable faults.

See the difference between the impression a man makes on you when you walk by
his side in familiar talk, or look at him in his home, and the figure he makes
when seen from a lofty historical level, or even in the eyes of a critical
neighbour who thinks of him as an embodied system or opinion rather than as a
man. Mr. Roe, the âtravelling preacherâ stationed at Treddleston, had included
Mr. Irwine in a general statement concerning the Church clergy in the
surrounding district, whom he described as men given up to the lusts of the
flesh and the pride of life; hunting and shooting, and adorning their own
houses; asking what shall we eat, and what shall we drink, and wherewithal
shall we be clothed?âcareless of dispensing the bread of life to their flocks,
preaching at best but a carnal and soul-benumbing morality, and trafficking in
the souls of men by receiving money for discharging the pastoral office in
parishes where they did not so much as look on the faces of the people more
than once a-year. The ecclesiastical historian, too, looking into parliamentary
reports of that period, finds honourable members zealous for the Church, and
untainted with any sympathy for the âtribe of canting Methodists,â making
statements scarcely less melancholy than that of Mr. Roe. And it is impossible
for me to say that Mr. Irwine was altogether belied by the generic
classification assigned him. He really had no very lofty aims, no theological
enthusiasm: if I were closely questioned, I should be obliged to confess that
he felt no serious alarms about the souls of his parishioners, and would have
thought it a mere loss of time to talk in a doctrinal and awakening manner to
old âFeyther Taft,â or even to Chad Cranage the blacksmith. If he had been in
the habit of speaking theoretically, he would perhaps have said that the only
healthy form religion could take in such minds was that of certain dim but
strong emotions, suffusing themselves as a hallowing influence over the family
affections and neighbourly duties. He thought the custom of baptism more
important than its doctrine, and that the religious benefits the peasant drew
from the church where his fathers worshipped and the sacred piece of turf where
they lay buried were but slightly dependent on a clear understanding of the
Liturgy or the sermon. Clearly the rector was not what is called in these days
an âearnestâ man: he was fonder of church history than of divinity, and had
much more insight into menâs characters than interest in their opinions; he was
neither laborious, nor obviously self-denying, nor very copious in alms-giving,
and his theology, you perceive, was lax. His mental palate, indeed, was rather
pagan, and found a savouriness in a quotation from Sophocles or Theocritus that
was quite absent from any text in Isaiah or Amos. But if you feed your young
setter on raw flesh, how can you wonder at its retaining a relish for uncooked
partridge in after-life? And Mr. Irwineâs recollections of young enthusiasm and
ambition were all associated with poetry and ethics that lay aloof from the
Bible.

On the other hand, I must plead, for I have an affectionate partiality towards
the rectorâs memory, that he was not vindictiveâand some philanthropists have
been so; that he was not intolerantâand there is a rumour that some zealous
theologians have not been altogether free from that blemish; that although he
would probably have declined to give his body to be burned in any public cause,
and was far from bestowing all his goods to feed the poor, he had that charity
which has sometimes been lacking to very illustrious virtueâhe was tender to
other menâs failings, and unwilling to impute evil. He was one of those men,
and they are not the commonest, of whom we can know the best only by following
them away from the marketplace, the platform, and the pulpit, entering with
them into their own homes, hearing the voice with which they speak to the young
and aged about their own hearthstone, and witnessing their thoughtful care for
the everyday wants of everyday companions, who take all their kindness as a
matter of course, and not as a subject for panegyric.

Such men, happily, have lived in times when great abuses flourished, and have
sometimes even been the living representatives of the abuses. That is a thought
which might comfort us a little under the opposite factâthat it is better
sometimes
not
to follow great reformers of abuses beyond the threshold
of their homes.

But whatever you may think of Mr. Irwine now, if you had met him that June
afternoon riding on his grey cob, with his dogs running beside himâportly,
upright, manly, with a good-natured smile on his finely turned lips as he
talked to his dashing young companion on the bay mare, you must have felt that,
however ill he harmonized with sound theories of the clerical office, he
somehow harmonized extremely well with that peaceful landscape.

See them in the bright sunlight, interrupted every now and then by rolling
masses of cloud, ascending the slope from the Broxton side, where the tall
gables and elms of the rectory predominate over the tiny whitewashed church.
They will soon be in the parish of Hayslope; the grey church-tower and village
roofs lie before them to the left, and farther on, to the right, they can just
see the chimneys of the Hall Farm.

Chapter VI

The Hall Farm

Evidently that gate is never opened, for the long grass and the great hemlocks
grow close against it, and if it were opened, it is so rusty that the force
necessary to turn it on its hinges would be likely to pull down the square
stone-built pillars, to the detriment of the two stone lionesses which grin
with a doubtful carnivorous affability above a coat of arms surmounting each of
the pillars. It would be easy enough, by the aid of the nicks in the stone
pillars, to climb over the brick wall with its smooth stone coping; but by
putting our eyes close to the rusty bars of the gate, we can see the house well
enough, and all but the very corners of the grassy enclosure.

It is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened by a pale powdery lichen,
which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity, so as to bring the red
brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments
surrounding the three gables, the windows, and the door-place. But the windows
are patched with wooden panes, and the door, I think, is like the gateâit is
never opened. How it would groan and grate against the stone floor if it were!
For it is a solid, heavy, handsome door, and must once have been in the habit
of shutting with a sonorous bang behind a liveried lackey, who had just seen
his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair.

But at present one might fancy the house in the early stage of a chancery suit,
and that the fruit from that grand double row of walnut-trees on the right hand
of the enclosure would fall and rot among the grass, if it were not that we
heard the booming bark of dogs echoing from great buildings at the back. And
now the half-weaned calves that have been sheltering themselves in a
gorse-built hovel against the left-hand wall come out and set up a silly answer
to that terrible bark, doubtless supposing that it has reference to buckets of
milk.

Yes, the house must be inhabited, and we will see by whom; for imagination is a
licensed trespasser: it has no fear of dogs, but may climb over walls and peep
in at windows with impunity. Put your face to one of the glass panes in the
right-hand window: what do you see? A large open fireplace, with rusty dogs in
it, and a bare boarded floor; at the far end, fleeces of wool stacked up; in
the middle of the floor, some empty corn-bags. That is the furniture of the
dining-room. And what through the left-hand window? Several clothes-horses, a
pillion, a spinning-wheel, and an old box wide open and stuffed full of
coloured rags. At the edge of this box there lies a great wooden doll, which,
so far as mutilation is concerned, bears a strong resemblance to the finest
Greek sculpture, and especially in the total loss of its nose. Near it there is
a little chair, and the butt end of a boyâs leather long-lashed whip.

The history of the house is plain now. It was once the residence of a country
squire, whose family, probably dwindling down to mere spinsterhood, got merged
in the more territorial name of Donnithorne. It was once the Hall; it is now
the Hall Farm. Like the life in some coast town that was once a watering-place,
and is now a port, where the genteel streets are silent and grass-grown, and
the docks and warehouses busy and resonant, the life at the Hall has changed
its focus, and no longer radiates from the parlour, but from the kitchen and
the farmyard.

Plenty of life there, though this is the drowsiest time of the year, just
before hay-harvest; and it is the drowsiest time of the day too, for it is
close upon three by the sun, and it is half-past three by Mrs. Poyserâs
handsome eight-day clock. But there is always a stronger sense of life when the
sun is brilliant after rain; and now he is pouring down his beams, and making
sparkles among the wet straw, and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss
on the red tiles of the cow-shed, and turning even the muddy water that is
hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow-billed
ducks, who are seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in
it as possible. There is quite a concert of noises; the great bull-dog, chained
against the stables, is thrown into furious exasperation by the unwary approach
of a cock too near the mouth of his kennel, and sends forth a thundering bark,
which is answered by two fox-hounds shut up in the opposite cow-house; the old
top-knotted hens, scratching with their chicks among the straw, set up a
sympathetic croaking as the discomfited cock joins them; a sow with her brood,
all very muddy as to the legs, and curled as to the tail, throws in some deep
staccato notes; our friends the calves are bleating from the home croft; and,
under all, a fine ear discerns the continuous hum of human voices.

For the great barn-doors are thrown wide open, and men are busy there mending
the harness, under the superintendence of Mr. Goby, the âwhittaw,â otherwise
saddler, who entertains them with the latest Treddleston gossip. It is
certainly rather an unfortunate day that Alick, the shepherd, has chosen for
having the whittaws, since the morning turned out so wet; and Mrs. Poyser has
spoken her mind pretty strongly as to the dirt which the extra number of menâs
shoes brought into the house at dinnertime. Indeed, she has not yet recovered
her equanimity on the subject, though it is now nearly three hours since
dinner, and the house-floor is perfectly clean again; as clean as everything
else in that wonderful house-place, where the only chance of collecting a few
grains of dust would be to climb on the salt-coffer, and put your finger on the
high mantel-shelf on which the glittering brass candlesticks are enjoying their
summer sinecure; for at this time of year, of course, every one goes to bed
while it is yet light, or at least light enough to discern the outline of
objects after you have bruised your shins against them. Surely nowhere else
could an oak clock-case and an oak table have got to such a polish by the hand:
genuine âelbow polish,â as Mrs. Poyser called it, for she thanked God she never
had any of your varnished rubbish in her house. Hetty Sorrel often took the
opportunity, when her auntâs back was turned, of looking at the pleasing
reflection of herself in those polished surfaces, for the oak table was usually
turned up like a screen, and was more for ornament than for use; and she could
see herself sometimes in the great round pewter dishes that were ranged on the
shelves above the long deal dinner-table, or in the hobs of the grate, which
always shone like jasper.

Everything was looking at its brightest at this moment, for the sun shone right
on the pewter dishes, and from their reflecting surfaces pleasant jets of light
were thrown on mellow oak and bright brassâand on a still pleasanter object
than these, for some of the rays fell on Dinahâs finely moulded cheek, and lit
up her pale red hair to auburn, as she bent over the heavy household linen
which she was mending for her aunt. No scene could have been more peaceful, if
Mrs. Poyser, who was ironing a few things that still remained from the Mondayâs
wash, had not been making a frequent clinking with her iron and moving to and
fro whenever she wanted it to cool; carrying the keen glance of her blue-grey
eye from the kitchen to the dairy, where Hetty was making up the butter, and
from the dairy to the back kitchen, where Nancy was taking the pies out of the
oven. Do not suppose, however, that Mrs. Poyser was elderly or shrewish in her
appearance; she was a good-looking woman, not more than eight-and-thirty, of
fair complexion and sandy hair, well-shapen, light-footed. The most conspicuous
article in her attire was an ample checkered linen apron, which almost covered
her skirt; and nothing could be plainer or less noticeable than her cap and
gown, for there was no weakness of which she was less tolerant than feminine
vanity, and the preference of ornament to utility. The family likeness between
her and her niece Dinah Morris, with the contrast between her keenness and
Dinahâs seraphic gentleness of expression, might have served a painter as an
excellent suggestion for a Martha and Mary. Their eyes were just of the same
colour, but a striking test of the difference in their operation was seen in
the demeanour of Trip, the black-and-tan terrier, whenever that much-suspected
dog unwarily exposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs. Poyserâs
glance. Her tongue was not less keen than her eye, and, whenever a damsel came
within earshot, seemed to take up an unfinished lecture, as a barrel-organ
takes up a tune, precisely at the point where it had left off.

The fact that it was churning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to
have the whittaws, and why, consequently, Mrs. Poyser should scold Molly the
housemaid with unusual severity. To all appearance Molly had got through her
after-dinner work in an exemplary manner, had âcleaned herselfâ with great
dispatch, and now came to ask, submissively, if she should sit down to her
spinning till milking time. But this blameless conduct, according to Mrs.
Poyser, shrouded a secret indulgence of unbecoming wishes, which she now
dragged forth and held up to Mollyâs view with cutting eloquence.

âSpinning, indeed! It isnât spinning as youâd be at, Iâll be bound, and let you
have your own way. I never knew your equals for gallowsness. To think of a gell
oâ your age wanting to go and sit with half-a-dozen men! Iâd haâ been ashamed
to let the words pass over my lips if Iâd been you. And you, as have been here
ever since last Michaelmas, and I hired you at Treddlesâon stattits, without a
bit oâ characterâas I say, you might be grateful to be hired in that way to a
respectable place; and you knew no more oâ what belongs to work when you come
here than the mawkin iâ the field. As poor a two-fisted thing as ever I saw,
you know you was. Who taught you to scrub a floor, I should like to know? Why,
youâd leave the dirt in heaps iâ the cornersâanybody âud think youâd never been
brought up among Christians. And as for spinning, why, youâve wasted as much as
your wage iâ the flax youâve spoiled learning to spin. And youâve a right to
feel that, and not to go about as gaping and as thoughtless as if you was
beholding to nobody. Comb the wool for the whittaws, indeed! Thatâs what youâd
like to be doing, is it? Thatâs the way with youâthatâs the road youâd all like
to go, headlongs to ruin. Youâre never easy till youâve got some sweetheart as
is as big a fool as yourself: you think youâll be finely off when youâre
married, I daresay, and have got a three-legged stool to sit on, and never a
blanket to cover you, and a bit oâ oat-cake for your dinner, as three children
are a-snatching at.â

âIâm sure I donna want tâ go wiâ the whittaws,â said Molly, whimpering, and
quite overcome by this Dantean picture of her future, âonây we allays used to
comb the wool for ân at Mester Ottleyâs; anâ so I just axed ye. I donna want to
set eyes on the whittaws again; I wish I may never stir if I do.â

âMr. Ottleyâs, indeed! Itâs fine talking oâ what you did at Mr. Ottleyâs. Your
missis there might like her floors dirted wiâ whittaws for what I know. Thereâs
no knowing what people
wonna
likeâsuch ways as Iâve heard of! I never
had a gell come into my house as seemed to know what cleaning was; I think
people live like pigs, for my part. And as to that Betty as was dairymaid at
Trentâs before she come to me, sheâd haâ left the cheeses without turning from
weekâs end to weekâs end, and the dairy thralls, I might haâ wrote my name on
âem, when I come downstairs after my illness, as the doctor said it was
inflammationâit was a mercy I got well of it. And to think oâ your knowing no
better, Molly, and been here a-going iâ nine months, and not for want oâ
talking to, neitherâand what are you stanning there for, like a jack as is run
down, instead oâ getting your wheel out? Youâre a rare un for sitting down to
your work a little while after itâs time to put by.â

âMunny, my ironâs twite told; pease put it down to warm.â

The small chirruping voice that uttered this request came from a little
sunny-haired girl between three and four, who, seated on a high chair at the
end of the ironing table, was arduously clutching the handle of a miniature
iron with her tiny fat fist, and ironing rags with an assiduity that required
her to put her little red tongue out as far as anatomy would allow.

âCold, is it, my darling? Bless your sweet face!â said Mrs. Poyser, who was
remarkable for the facility with which she could relapse from her official
objurgatory to one of fondness or of friendly converse. âNever mind! Motherâs
done her ironing now. Sheâs going to put the ironing things away.â

âMunny, I tould âike to do into de barn to Tommy, to see de whittawd.â

âNo, no, no; Totty âud get her feet wet,â said Mrs. Poyser, carrying away her
iron. âRun into the dairy and see cousin Hetty make the butter.â

âI tould âike a bit oâ pum-take,â rejoined Totty, who seemed to be provided
with several relays of requests; at the same time, taking the opportunity of
her momentary leisure to put her fingers into a bowl of starch, and drag it
down so as to empty the contents with tolerable completeness on to the ironing
sheet.

âDid ever anybody see the like?â screamed Mrs. Poyser, running towards the
table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream. âThe childâs allays iâ
mischief if your backâs turned a minute. What shall I do to you, you naughty,
naughty gell?â

Totty, however, had descended from her chair with great swiftness, and was
already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run, and an amount
of fat on the nape of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a
white suckling pig.

The starch having been wiped up by Mollyâs help, and the ironing apparatus put
by, Mrs. Poyser took up her knitting which always lay ready at hand, and was
the work she liked best, because she could carry it on automatically as she
walked to and fro. But now she came and sat down opposite Dinah, whom she
looked at in a meditative way, as she knitted her grey worsted stocking.

âYou look thâ image oâ your Aunt Judith, Dinah, when you sit a-sewing. I could
almost fancy it was thirty years back, and I was a little gell at home, looking
at Judith as she sat at her work, after sheâd done the house up; only it was a
little cottage, Fatherâs was, and not a big rambling house as gets dirty iâ one
corner as fast as you clean it in anotherâbut for all that, I could fancy you
was your Aunt Judith, only her hair was a deal darker than yours, and she was
stouter and broader iâ the shoulders. Judith and me allays hung together,
though she had such queer ways, but your mother and her never could agree. Ah,
your mother little thought as sheâd have a daughter just cut out after the very
pattern oâ Judith, and leave her an orphan, too, for Judith to take care on,
and bring up with a spoon when
she
was in the graveyard at Stoniton. I
allays said that oâ Judith, as sheâd bear a pound weight any day to save
anybody else carrying a ounce. And she was just the same from the first oâ my
remembering her; it made no difference in her, as I could see, when she took to
the Methodists, only she talked a bit different and wore a different sort oâ
cap; but sheâd never in her life spent a penny on herself more than keeping
herself decent.â

âShe was a blessed woman,â said Dinah; âGod had given her a loving,
self-forgetting nature, and He perfected it by grace. And she was very fond of
you too, Aunt Rachel. I often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way.
When she had that bad illness, and I was only eleven years old, she used to
say, âYouâll have a friend on earth in your Aunt Rachel, if Iâm taken from you,
for she has a kind heart,â and Iâm sure Iâve found it so.â

âI donât know how, child; anybody âud be cunning to do anything for you, I
think; youâre like the birds oâ thâ air, and live nobody knows how. Iâd haâ
been glad to behave to you like a motherâs sister, if youâd come and live iâ
this country where thereâs some shelter and victual for man and beast, and
folks donât live on the naked hills, like poultry a-scratching on a gravel
bank. And then you might get married to some decent man, and thereâd be plenty
ready to have you, if youâd only leave off that preaching, as is ten times
worse than anything your Aunt Judith ever did. And even if youâd marry Seth
Bede, as is a poor wool-gathering Methodist andâs never like to have a penny
beforehand, I know your uncle âud help you with a pig, and very like a cow, for
heâs allays been good-naturâd to my kin, for all theyâre poor, and made âem
welcome to the house; and âud do for you, Iâll be bound, as much as ever heâd
do for Hetty, though sheâs his own niece. And thereâs linen in the house as I
could well spare you, for Iâve got lots oâ sheeting and table-clothing, and
towelling, as isnât made up. Thereâs a piece oâ sheeting I could give you as
that squinting Kitty spunâshe was a rare girl to spin, for all she squinted,
and the children couldnât abide her; and, you know, the spinningâs going on
constant, and thereâs new linen wove twice as fast as the old wears out. But
whereâs the use oâ talking, if ye wonna be persuaded, and settle down like any
other woman in her senses, iâstead oâ wearing yourself out with walking and
preaching, and giving away every penny you get, so as youâve nothing saved
against sickness; and all the things youâve got iâ the world, I verily believe,
âud go into a bundle no bigger nor a double cheese. And all because youâve got
notions iâ your head about religion more nor whatâs iâ the Catechism and the
Prayer-book.â

âBut not more than whatâs in the Bible, Aunt,â said Dinah.

âYes, and the Bible too, for that matter,â Mrs. Poyser rejoined, rather
sharply; âelse why shouldnât them as know best whatâs in the Bibleâthe parsons
and people as have got nothing to do but learn itâdo the same as you do? But,
for the matter oâ that, if everybody was to do like you, the world must come to
a standstill; for if everybody tried to do without house and home, and with
poor eating and drinking, and was allays talking as we must despise the things
oâ the world as you say, I should like to know where the pick oâ the stock, and
the corn, and the best new-milk cheeses âud have to go. Everybody âud be
wanting bread made oâ tail ends and everybody âud be running after everybody
else to preach to âem, istead oâ bringing up their families, and laying by
against a bad harvest. It stands to sense as that canât be the right religion.â

âNay, dear aunt, you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake
their work and their families. Itâs quite right the land should be ploughed and
sowed, and the precious corn stored, and the things of this life cared for, and
right that people should rejoice in their families, and provide for them, so
that this is done in the fear of the Lord, and that they are not unmindful of
the soulâs wants while they are caring for the body. We can all be servants of
God wherever our lot is cast, but He gives us different sorts of work,
according as He fits us for it and calls us to it. I can no more help spending
my life in trying to do what I can for the souls of others, than you could help
running if you heard little Totty crying at the other end of the house; the
voice would go to your heart, you would think the dear child was in trouble or
in danger, and you couldnât rest without running to help her and comfort her.â

âAh,â said Mrs. Poyser, rising and walking towards the door, âI know it âud be
just the same if I was to talk to you for hours. Youâd make me the same answer,
at thâ end. I might as well talk to the running brook and tell it to stanâ
still.â

The causeway outside the kitchen door was dry enough now for Mrs. Poyser to
stand there quite pleasantly and see what was going on in the yard, the grey
worsted stocking making a steady progress in her hands all the while. But she
had not been standing there more than five minutes before she came in again,
and said to Dinah, in rather a flurried, awe-stricken tone, âIf there isnât
Captain Donnithorne and Mr. Irwine a-coming into the yard! Iâll lay my life
theyâre come to speak about your preaching on the Green, Dinah; itâs you must
answer âem, for Iâm dumb. Iâve said enough aâready about your bringing such
disgrace upoâ your uncleâs family. I wouldnât haâ minded if youâd been Mr.
Poyserâs own nieceâfolks must put up wiâ their own kin, as they put up wiâ
their own nosesâitâs their own flesh and blood. But to think of a niece oâ mine
being cause oâ my husbandâs being turned out of his farm, and me brought him no
fortin but my savinâsâââ

âNay, dear Aunt Rachel,â said Dinah gently, âyouâve no cause for such fears.
Iâve strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the
children from anything Iâve done. I didnât preach without direction.â

âDirection! I know very well what you mean by direction,â said Mrs. Poyser,
knitting in a rapid and agitated manner. âWhen thereâs a bigger maggot than
usual in your head you call it âdirectionâ; and then nothing can stir youâyou
look like the statty oâ the outside oâ Treddlesâon church, a-starinâ and
a-smilinâ whether itâs fair weather or foul. I hanna common patience with you.â

By this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from
their horses: it was plain they meant to come in. Mrs. Poyser advanced to the
door to meet them, curtsying low and trembling between anger with Dinah and
anxiety to conduct herself with perfect propriety on the occasion. For in those
days the keenest of bucolic minds felt a whispering awe at the sight of the
gentry, such as of old men felt when they stood on tiptoe to watch the gods
passing by in tall human shape.

âWell, Mrs. Poyser, how are you after this stormy morning?â said Mr. Irwine,
with his stately cordiality. âOur feet are quite dry; we shall not soil your
beautiful floor.â

âOh, sir, donât mention it,â said Mrs. Poyser. âWill you and the captain please
to walk into the parlour?â

âNo, indeed, thank you, Mrs. Poyser,â said the captain, looking eagerly round
the kitchen, as if his eye were seeking something it could not find. âI delight
in your kitchen. I think it is the most charming room I know. I should like
every farmerâs wife to come and look at it for a pattern.â

âOh, youâre pleased to say so, sir. Pray take a seat,â said Mrs. Poyser,
relieved a little by this compliment and the captainâs evident good-humour, but
still glancing anxiously at Mr. Irwine, who, she saw, was looking at Dinah and
advancing towards her.

âPoyser is not at home, is he?â said Captain Donnithorne, seating himself where
he could see along the short passage to the open dairy-door.

âNo, sir, he isnât; heâs gone to Rosseter to see Mr. West, the factor, about
the wool. But thereâs Father iâ the barn, sir, if heâd be of any use.â

âNo, thank you; Iâll just look at the whelps and leave a message about them
with your shepherd. I must come another day and see your husband; I want to
have a consultation with him about horses. Do you know when heâs likely to be
at liberty?â

âWhy, sir, you can hardly miss him, except itâs oâ Treddlesâon
market-dayâthatâs of a Friday, you know. For if heâs anywhere on the farm we
can send for him in a minute. If weâd got rid oâ the Scantlands, we should have
no outlying fields; and I should be glad of it, for if ever anything happens,
heâs sure to be gone to the Scantlands. Things allays happen so contrairy, if
theyâve a chance; and itâs an unnatâral thing to have one bit oâ your farm in
one county and all the rest in another.â

âAh, the Scantlands would go much better with Choyceâs farm, especially as he
wants dairyland and youâve got plenty. I think yours is the prettiest farm on
the estate, though; and do you know, Mrs. Poyser, if I were going to marry and
settle, I should be tempted to turn you out, and do up this fine old house, and
turn farmer myself.â

âOh, sir,â said Mrs. Poyser, rather alarmed, âyou wouldnât like it at all. As
for farming, itâs putting money into your pocket wiâ your right hand and
fetching it out wiâ your left. As fur as I can see, itâs raising victual for
other folks and just getting a mouthful for yourself and your children as you
go along. Not as youâd be like a poor man as wants to get his breadâyou could
afford to lose as much money as you liked iâ farmingâbut itâs poor fun losing
money, I should think, though I understanâ itâs what the great folks iâ London
play at more than anything. For my husband heard at market as Lord Daceyâs
eldest son had lost thousands upoâ thousands to the Prince oâ Wales, and they
said my lady was going to pawn her jewels to pay for him. But you know more
about that than I do, sir. But, as for farming, sir, I canna think as youâd
like it; and this houseâthe draughts in it are enough to cut you through, and
itâs my opinion the floors upstairs are very rotten, and the rats iâ the cellar
are beyond anything.â

âWhy, thatâs a terrible picture, Mrs. Poyser. I think I should be doing you a
service to turn you out of such a place. But thereâs no chance of that. Iâm not
likely to settle for the next twenty years, till Iâm a stout gentleman of
forty; and my grandfather would never consent to part with such good tenants as
you.â

âWell, sir, if he thinks so well oâ Mr. Poyser for a tenant I wish you could
put in a word for him to allow us some new gates for the Five closes, for my
husbandâs been asking and asking till heâs tired, and to think oâ what heâs
done for the farm, andâs never had a penny allowed him, be the times bad or
good. And as Iâve said to my husband often and often, Iâm sure if the captain
had anything to do with it, it wouldnât be so. Not as I wish to speak
disrespectful oâ them as have got the power iâ their hands, but itâs more than
flesh and blood âull bear sometimes, to be toiling and striving, and up early
and down late, and hardly sleeping a wink when you lie down for thinking as the
cheese may swell, or the cows may slip their calf, or the wheat may grow green
again iâ the sheafâand after all, at thâ end oâ the year, itâs like as if youâd
been cooking a feast and had got the smell of it for your pains.â

Mrs. Poyser, once launched into conversation, always sailed along without any
check from her preliminary awe of the gentry. The confidence she felt in her
own powers of exposition was a motive force that overcame all resistance.

âIâm afraid I should only do harm instead of good, if I were to speak about the
gates, Mrs. Poyser,â said the captain, âthough I assure you thereâs no man on
the estate I would sooner say a word for than your husband. I know his farm is
in better order than any other within ten miles of us; and as for the kitchen,â
he added, smiling, âI donât believe thereâs one in the kingdom to beat it. By
the by, Iâve never seen your dairy: I must see your dairy, Mrs. Poyser.â

âIndeed, sir, itâs not fit for you to go in, for Hettyâs in the middle oâ
making the butter, for the churning was thrown late, and Iâm quite ashamed.â
This Mrs. Poyser said blushing, and believing that the captain was really
interested in her milk-pans, and would adjust his opinion of her to the
appearance of her dairy.

âOh, Iâve no doubt itâs in capital order. Take me in,â said the captain,
himself leading the way, while Mrs. Poyser followed.

Chapter VII

The Dairy

The dairy was certainly worth looking at: it was a scene to sicken for with a
sort of calenture in hot and dusty streetsâsuch coolness, such purity, such
fresh fragrance of new-pressed cheese, of firm butter, of wooden vessels
perpetually bathed in pure water; such soft colouring of red earthenware and
creamy surfaces, brown wood and polished tin, grey limestone and rich
orange-red rust on the iron weights and hooks and hinges. But one gets only a
confused notion of these details when they surround a distractingly pretty girl
of seventeen, standing on little pattens and rounding her dimpled arm to lift a
pound of butter out of the scale.

Hetty blushed a deep rose-colour when Captain Donnithorne entered the dairy and
spoke to her; but it was not at all a distressed blush, for it was inwreathed
with smiles and dimples, and with sparkles from under long, curled, dark
eyelashes; and while her aunt was discoursing to him about the limited amount
of milk that was to be spared for butter and cheese so long as the calves were
not all weaned, and a large quantity but inferior quality of milk yielded by
the shorthorn, which had been bought on experiment, together with other matters
which must be interesting to a young gentleman who would one day be a landlord,
Hetty tossed and patted her pound of butter with quite a self-possessed,
coquettish air, slyly conscious that no turn of her head was lost.

There are various orders of beauty, causing men to make fools of themselves in
various styles, from the desperate to the sheepish; but there is one order of
beauty which seems made to turn the heads not only of men, but of all
intelligent mammals, even of women. It is a beauty like that of kittens, or
very small downy ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills, or
babies just beginning to toddle and to engage in conscious mischiefâa beauty
with which you can never be angry, but that you feel ready to crush for
inability to comprehend the state of mind into which it throws you. Hetty
Sorrelâs was that sort of beauty. Her aunt, Mrs. Poyser, who professed to
despise all personal attractions and intended to be the severest of mentors,
continually gazed at Hettyâs charms by the sly, fascinated in spite of herself;
and after administering such a scolding as naturally flowed from her anxiety to
do well by her husbandâs nieceâwho had no mother of her own to scold her, poor
thing!âshe would often confess to her husband, when they were safe out of
hearing, that she firmly believed, âthe naughtier the little huzzy behaved, the
prettier she looked.â

It is of little use for me to tell you that Hettyâs cheek was like a
rose-petal, that dimples played about her pouting lips, that her large dark
eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes, and that her curly hair,
though all pushed back under her round cap while she was at work, stole back in
dark delicate rings on her forehead, and about her white shell-like ears; it is
of little use for me to say how lovely was the contour of her pink-and-white
neckerchief, tucked into her low plum-coloured stuff bodice, or how the linen
butter-making apron, with its bib, seemed a thing to be imitated in silk by
duchesses, since it fell in such charming lines, or how her brown stockings and
thick-soled buckled shoes lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly
have had when empty of her foot and ankleâof little use, unless you have seen a
woman who affected you as Hetty affected her beholders, for otherwise, though
you might conjure up the image of a lovely woman, she would not in the least
resemble that distracting kittenlike maiden. I might mention all the divine
charms of a bright spring day, but if you had never in your life utterly
forgotten yourself in straining your eyes after the mounting lark, or in
wandering through the still lanes when the fresh-opened blossoms fill them with
a sacred silent beauty like that of fretted aisles, where would be the use of
my descriptive catalogue? I could never make you know what I meant by a bright
spring day. Hettyâs was a spring-tide beauty; it was the beauty of young
frisking things, round-limbed, gambolling, circumventing you by a false air of
innocenceâthe innocence of a young star-browed calf, for example, that, being
inclined for a promenade out of bounds, leads you a severe steeplechase over
hedge and ditch, and only comes to a stand in the middle of a bog.

And they are the prettiest attitudes and movements into which a pretty girl is
thrown in making up butterâtossing movements that give a charming curve to the
arm, and a sideward inclination of the round white neck; little patting and
rolling movements with the palm of the hand, and nice adaptations and
finishings which cannot at all be effected without a great play of the pouting
mouth and the dark eyes. And then the butter itself seems to communicate a
fresh charmâit is so pure, so sweet-scented; it is turned off the mould with
such a beautiful firm surface, like marble in a pale yellow light! Moreover,
Hetty was particularly clever at making up the butter; it was the one
performance of hers that her aunt allowed to pass without severe criticism; so
she handled it with all the grace that belongs to mastery.

âI hope you will be ready for a great holiday on the thirtieth of July, Mrs.
Poyser,â said Captain Donnithorne, when he had sufficiently admired the dairy
and given several improvised opinions on Swede turnips and shorthorns. âYou
know what is to happen then, and I shall expect you to be one of the guests who
come earliest and leave latest. Will you promise me your hand for two dances,
Miss Hetty? If I donât get your promise now, I know I shall hardly have a
chance, for all the smart young farmers will take care to secure you.â

Hetty smiled and blushed, but before she could answer, Mrs. Poyser interposed,
scandalized at the mere suggestion that the young squire could be excluded by
any meaner partners.

âIndeed, sir, you are very kind to take that notice of her. And Iâm sure,
whenever youâre pleased to dance with her, sheâll be proud and thankful, if she
stood still all the rest oâ thâ evening.â

âOh no, no, that would be too cruel to all the other young fellows who can
dance. But you will promise me two dances, wonât you?â the captain continued,
determined to make Hetty look at him and speak to him.

Hetty dropped the prettiest little curtsy, and stole a half-shy,
half-coquettish glance at him as she said, âYes, thank you, sir.â

âAnd you must bring all your children, you know, Mrs. Poyser; your little
Totty, as well as the boys. I want all the youngest children on the estate to
be thereâall those who will be fine young men and women when Iâm a bald old
fellow.â

âOh dear, sir, that âull be a long time first,â said Mrs. Poyser, quite
overcome at the young squireâs speaking so lightly of himself, and thinking how
her husband would be interested in hearing her recount this remarkable specimen
of high-born humour. The captain was thought to be âvery full of his jokes,â
and was a great favourite throughout the estate on account of his free manners.
Every tenant was quite sure things would be different when the reins got into
his handsâthere was to be a millennial abundance of new gates, allowances of
lime, and returns of ten per cent.

âBut where
is
Totty to-day?â he said. âI want to see her.â

âWhere is the little un, Hetty?â said Mrs. Poyser. âShe came in here not long
ago.â

âI donât know. She went into the brewhouse to Nancy, I think.â

The proud mother, unable to resist the temptation to show her Totty, passed at
once into the back kitchen, in search of her, not, however, without misgivings
lest something should have happened to render her person and attire unfit for
presentation.

âAnd do you carry the butter to market when youâve made it?â said the Captain
to Hetty, meanwhile.

âOh no, sir; not when itâs so heavy. Iâm not strong enough to carry it. Alick
takes it on horseback.â

âNo, Iâm sure your pretty arms were never meant for such heavy weights. But you
go out a walk sometimes these pleasant evenings, donât you? Why donât you have
a walk in the Chase sometimes, now itâs so green and pleasant? I hardly ever
see you anywhere except at home and at church.â

âAunt doesnât like me to go a-walking only when Iâm going somewhere,â said
Hetty. âBut I go through the Chase sometimes.â

âAnd donât you ever go to see Mrs. Best, the housekeeper? I think I saw you
once in the housekeeperâs room.â

âIt isnât Mrs. Best, itâs Mrs. Pomfret, the ladyâs maid, as I go to see. Sheâs
teaching me tent-stitch and the lace-mending. Iâm going to tea with her
to-morrow afternoon.â

The reason why there had been space for this
tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte
can only be
known by looking into the back kitchen, where Totty had been discovered rubbing
a stray blue-bag against her nose, and in the same moment allowing some liberal
indigo drops to fall on her afternoon pinafore. But now she appeared holding
her motherâs handâthe end of her round nose rather shiny from a recent and
hurried application of soap and water.

âHere she is!â said the captain, lifting her up and setting her on the low
stone shelf. âHereâs Totty! By the by, whatâs her other name? She wasnât
christened Totty.â

âOh, sir, we call her sadly out of her name. Charlotteâs her christened name.
Itâs a name iâ Mr. Poyserâs family: his grandmother was named Charlotte. But we
began with calling her Lotty, and now itâs got to Totty. To be sure itâs more
like a name for a dog than a Christian child.â

âTottyâs a capital name. Why, she looks like a Totty. Has she got a pocket on?â
said the captain, feeling in his own waistcoat pockets.

Totty immediately with great gravity lifted up her frock, and showed a tiny
pink pocket at present in a state of collapse.

âIt dot notinâ in it,â she said, as she looked down at it very earnestly.

âNo! What a pity! Such a pretty pocket. Well, I think Iâve got some things in
mine that will make a pretty jingle in it. Yes! I declare Iâve got five little
round silver things, and hear what a pretty noise they make in Tottyâs pink
pocket.â Here he shook the pocket with the five sixpences in it, and Totty
showed her teeth and wrinkled her nose in great glee; but, divining that there
was nothing more to be got by staying, she jumped off the shelf and ran away to
jingle her pocket in the hearing of Nancy, while her mother called after her,
âOh for shame, you naughty gell! Not to thank the captain for what heâs given
you, Iâm sure, sir, itâs very kind of you; but sheâs spoiled shameful; her
father wonât have her said nay in anything, and thereâs no managing her. Itâs
being the youngest, and thâ only gell.â

âOh, sheâs a funny little fatty; I wouldnât have her different. But I must be
going now, for I suppose the rector is waiting for me.â

With a âgood-bye,â a bright glance, and a bow to Hetty Arthur left the dairy.
But he was mistaken in imagining himself waited for. The rector had been so
much interested in his conversation with Dinah that he would not have chosen to
close it earlier; and you shall hear now what they had been saying to each
other.

Chapter VIII

A Vocation

Dinah, who had risen when the gentlemen came in, but still kept hold of the
sheet she was mending, curtsied respectfully when she saw Mr. Irwine looking at
her and advancing towards her. He had never yet spoken to her, or stood face to
face with her, and her first thought, as her eyes met his, was, âWhat a
well-favoured countenance! Oh that the good seed might fall on that soil, for
it would surely flourish.â The agreeable impression must have been mutual, for
Mr. Irwine bowed to her with a benignant deference, which would have been
equally in place if she had been the most dignified lady of his acquaintance.

âYou are only a visitor in this neighbourhood, I think?â were his first words,
as he seated himself opposite to her.

âNo, sir, I come from Snowfield, in Stonyshire. But my aunt was very kind,
wanting me to have rest from my work there, because Iâd been ill, and she
invited me to come and stay with her for a while.â

âAh, I remember Snowfield very well; I once had occasion to go there. Itâs a
dreary bleak place. They were building a cotton-mill there; but thatâs many
years ago now. I suppose the place is a good deal changed by the employment
that mill must have brought.â

âIt
is
changed so far as the mill has brought people there, who get a
livelihood for themselves by working in it, and make it better for the
tradesfolks. I work in it myself, and have reason to be grateful, for thereby I
have enough and to spare. But itâs still a bleak place, as you say, sirâvery
different from this country.â

âYou have relations living there, probably, so that you are attached to the
place as your home?â

âI had an aunt there once; she brought me up, for I was an orphan. But she was
taken away seven years ago, and I have no other kindred that I know of, besides
my Aunt Poyser, who is very good to me, and would have me come and live in this
country, which to be sure is a good land, wherein they eat bread without
scarceness. But Iâm not free to leave Snowfield, where I was first planted, and
have grown deep into it, like the small grass on the hill-top.â

âAh, I daresay you have many religious friends and companions there; you are a
Methodistâa Wesleyan, I think?â

âYes, my aunt at Snowfield belonged to the Society, and I have cause to be
thankful for the privileges I have had thereby from my earliest childhood.â

âAnd have you been long in the habit of preaching? For I understand you
preached at Hayslope last night.â

âI first took to the work four years since, when I was twenty-one.â

âYour Society sanctions womenâs preaching, then?â

âIt doesnât forbid them, sir, when theyâve a clear call to the work, and when
their ministry is owned by the conversion of sinners and the strengthening of
Godâs people. Mrs. Fletcher, as you may have heard about, was the first woman
to preach in the Society, I believe, before she was married, when she was Miss
Bosanquet; and Mr. Wesley approved of her undertaking the work. She had a great
gift, and there are many others now living who are precious fellow-helpers in
the work of the ministry. I understand thereâs been voices raised against it in
the Society of late, but I cannot but think their counsel will come to nought.
It isnât for men to make channels for Godâs Spirit, as they make channels for
the watercourses, and say, âFlow here, but flow not there.ââ

âBut donât you find some danger among your peopleâI donât mean to say that it
is so with you, far from itâbut donât you find sometimes that both men and
women fancy themselves channels for Godâs Spirit, and are quite mistaken, so
that they set about a work for which they are unfit and bring holy things into
contempt?â

âDoubtless it is so sometimes; for there have been evil-doers among us who have
sought to deceive the brethren, and some there are who deceive their own
selves. But we are not without discipline and correction to put a check upon
these things. Thereâs a very strict order kept among us, and the brethren and
sisters watch for each otherâs souls as they that must give account. They donât
go every one his own way and say, âAm I my brotherâs keeper?ââ

âBut tell meâif I may ask, and I am really interested in knowing itâhow you
first came to think of preaching?â

âIndeed, sir, I didnât think of it at allâIâd been used from the time I was
sixteen to talk to the little children, and teach them, and sometimes I had had
my heart enlarged to speak in class, and was much drawn out in prayer with the
sick. But I had felt no call to preach, for when Iâm not greatly wrought upon,
Iâm too much given to sit still and keep by myself. It seems as if I could sit
silent all day long with the thought of God overflowing my soulâas the pebbles
lie bathed in the Willow Brook. For thoughts are so greatâarenât they, sir?
They seem to lie upon us like a deep flood; and itâs my besetment to forget
where I am and everything about me, and lose myself in thoughts that I could
give no account of, for I could neither make a beginning nor ending of them in
words. That was my way as long as I can remember; but sometimes it seemed as if
speech came to me without any will of my own, and words were given to me that
came out as the tears come, because our hearts are full and we canât help it.
And those were always times of great blessing, though I had never thought it
could be so with me before a congregation of people. But, sir, we are led on,
like the little children, by a way that we know not. I was called to preach
quite suddenly, and since then I have never been left in doubt about the work
that was laid upon me.â

âBut tell me the circumstancesâjust how it was, the very day you began to
preach.â

âIt was one Sunday I walked with brother Marlowe, who was an aged man, one of
the local preachers, all the way to Hetton-Deepsâthatâs a village where the
people get their living by working in the lead-mines, and where thereâs no
church nor preacher, but they live like sheep without a shepherd. Itâs better
than twelve miles from Snowfield, so we set out early in the morning, for it
was summertime; and I had a wonderful sense of the Divine love as we walked
over the hills, where thereâs no trees, you know, sir, as there is here, to
make the sky look smaller, but you see the heavens stretched out like a tent,
and you feel the everlasting arms around you. But before we got to Hetton,
brother Marlowe was seized with a dizziness that made him afraid of falling,
for he overworked himself sadly, at his years, in watching and praying, and
walking so many miles to speak the Word, as well as carrying on his trade of
linen-weaving. And when we got to the village, the people were expecting him,
for heâd appointed the time and the place when he was there before, and such of
them as cared to hear the Word of Life were assembled on a spot where the
cottages was thickest, so as others might be drawn to come. But he felt as he
couldnât stand up to preach, and he was forced to lie down in the first of the
cottages we came to. So I went to tell the people, thinking weâd go into one of
the houses, and I would read and pray with them. But as I passed along by the
cottages and saw the aged and trembling women at the doors, and the hard looks
of the men, who seemed to have their eyes no more filled with the sight of the
Sabbath morning than if they had been dumb oxen that never looked up to the
sky, I felt a great movement in my soul, and I trembled as if I was shaken by a
strong spirit entering into my weak body. And I went to where the little flock
of people was gathered together, and stepped on the low wall that was built
against the green hillside, and I spoke the words that were given to me
abundantly. And they all came round me out of all the cottages, and many wept
over their sins, and have since been joined to the Lord. That was the beginning
of my preaching, sir, and Iâve preached ever since.â

Dinah had let her work fall during this narrative, which she uttered in her
usual simple way, but with that sincere articulate, thrilling treble by which
she always mastered her audience. She stooped now to gather up her sewing, and
then went on with it as before. Mr. Irwine was deeply interested. He said to
himself, âHe must be a miserable prig who would act the pedagogue here: one
might as well go and lecture the trees for growing in their own shape.â

âAnd you never feel any embarrassment from the sense of your youthâthat you are
a lovely young woman on whom menâs eyes are fixed?â he said aloud.

âNo, Iâve no room for such feelings, and I donât believe the people ever take
notice about that. I think, sir, when God makes His presence felt through us,
we are like the burning bush: Moses never took any heed what sort of bush it
wasâhe only saw the brightness of the Lord. Iâve preached to as rough ignorant
people as can be in the villages about Snowfieldâmen that looked very hard and
wildâbut they never said an uncivil word to me, and often thanked me kindly as
they made way for me to pass through the midst of them.â

â
That
I can believeâthat I can well believe,â said Mr. Irwine,
emphatically. âAnd what did you think of your hearers last night, now? Did you
find them quiet and attentive?â

âVery quiet, sir, but I saw no signs of any great work upon them, except in a
young girl named Bessy Cranage, towards whom my heart yearned greatly, when my
eyes first fell on her blooming youth, given up to folly and vanity. I had some
private talk and prayer with her afterwards, and I trust her heart is touched.
But Iâve noticed that in these villages where the people lead a quiet life
among the green pastures and the still waters, tilling the ground and tending
the cattle, thereâs a strange deadness to the Word, as different as can be from
the great towns, like Leeds, where I once went to visit a holy woman who
preaches there. Itâs wonderful how rich is the harvest of souls up those
high-walled streets, where you seemed to walk as in a prison-yard, and the ear
is deafened with the sounds of worldly toil. I think maybe it is because the
promise is sweeter when this life is so dark and weary, and the soul gets more
hungry when the body is ill at ease.â

âWhy, yes, our farm-labourers are not easily roused. They take life almost as
slowly as the sheep and cows. But we have some intelligent workmen about here.
I daresay you know the Bedes; Seth Bede, by the by, is a Methodist.â

âYes, I know Seth well, and his brother Adam a little. Seth is a gracious young
manâsincere and without offence; and Adam is like the patriarch Joseph, for his
great skill and knowledge and the kindness he shows to his brother and his
parents.â

âPerhaps you donât know the trouble that has just happened to them? Their
father, Matthias Bede, was drowned in the Willow Brook last night, not far from
his own door. Iâm going now to see Adam.â

âAh, their poor aged mother!â said Dinah, dropping her hands and looking before
her with pitying eyes, as if she saw the object of her sympathy. âShe will
mourn heavily, for Seth has told me sheâs of an anxious, troubled heart. I must
go and see if I can give her any help.â

As she rose and was beginning to fold up her work, Captain Donnithorne, having
exhausted all plausible pretexts for remaining among the milk-pans, came out of
the dairy, followed by Mrs. Poyser. Mr. Irwine now rose also, and, advancing
towards Dinah, held out his hand, and said, âGood-bye. I hear you are going
away soon; but this will not be the last visit you will pay your auntâso we
shall meet again, I hope.â

His cordiality towards Dinah set all Mrs. Poyserâs anxieties at rest, and her
face was brighter than usual, as she said, âIâve never asked after Mrs. Irwine
and the Miss Irwines, sir; I hope theyâre as well as usual.â

âYes, thank you, Mrs. Poyser, except that Miss Anne has one of her bad
headaches to-day. By the by, we all liked that nice cream-cheese you sent usâmy
mother especially.â

âIâm very glad, indeed, sir. It is but seldom I make one, but I remembered Mrs.
Irwine was fond of âem. Please to give my duty to her, and to Miss Kate and
Miss Anne. Theyâve never been to look at my poultry this long while, and Iâve
got some beautiful speckled chickens, black and white, as Miss Kate might like
to have some of amongst hers.â

âWell, Iâll tell her; she must come and see them. Good-bye,â said the rector,
mounting his horse.

âJust ride slowly on, Irwine,â said Captain Donnithorne, mounting also. âIâll
overtake you in three minutes. Iâm only going to speak to the shepherd about
the whelps. Good-bye, Mrs. Poyser; tell your husband I shall come and have a
long talk with him soon.â

Mrs. Poyser curtsied duly, and watched the two horses until they had
disappeared from the yard, amidst great excitement on the part of the pigs and
the poultry, and under the furious indignation of the bull-dog, who performed a
Pyrrhic dance, that every moment seemed to threaten the breaking of his chain.
Mrs. Poyser delighted in this noisy exit; it was a fresh assurance to her that
the farm-yard was well guarded, and that no loiterers could enter unobserved;
and it was not until the gate had closed behind the captain that she turned
into the kitchen again, where Dinah stood with her bonnet in her hand, waiting
to speak to her aunt, before she set out for Lisbeth Bedeâs cottage.

Mrs. Poyser, however, though she noticed the bonnet, deferred remarking on it
until she had disburdened herself of her surprise at Mr. Irwineâs behaviour.

âWhy, Mr. Irwine wasnât angry, then? What did he say to you, Dinah? Didnât he
scold you for preaching?â

âNo, he was not at all angry; he was very friendly to me. I was quite drawn out
to speak to him; I hardly know how, for I had always thought of him as a
worldly Sadducee. But his countenance is as pleasant as the morning sunshine.â

âPleasant! and what else did yâ expect to find him but pleasant?â said Mrs.
Poyser impatiently, resuming her knitting. âI should think his countenance

is
pleasant indeed! And him a gentleman born, andâs got a mother like a
picter. You may go the country round and not find such another woman turned
sixty-six. Itâs summat-like to see such a man as that iâ the desk of a Sunday!
As I say to Poyser, itâs like looking at a full crop oâ wheat, or a pasture
with a fine dairy oâ cows in it; it makes you think the worldâs
comfortable-like. But as for such creaturs as you Methodisses run after, Iâd as
soon go to look at a lot oâ bare-ribbed runts on a common. Fine folks they are
to tell you whatâs right, as look as if theyâd never tasted nothing better than
bacon-sword and sour-cake iâ their lives. But what did Mr. Irwine say to you
about that foolâs trick oâ preaching on the Green?â

âHe only said heâd heard of it; he didnât seem to feel any displeasure about
it. But, dear aunt, donât think any more about that. He told me something that
Iâm sure will cause you sorrow, as it does me. Thias Bede was drowned last
night in the Willow Brook, and Iâm thinking that the aged mother will be
greatly in need of comfort. Perhaps I can be of use to her, so I have fetched
my bonnet and am going to set out.â

âDear heart, dear heart! But you must have a cup oâ tea first, child,â said
Mrs. Poyser, falling at once from the key of B with five sharps to the frank
and genial C. âThe kettleâs boilingâweâll have it ready in a minute; and the
young uns âull be in and wanting theirs directly. Iâm quite willing you should
go and see thâ old woman, for youâre one as is allays welcome in trouble,
Methodist or no Methodist; but, for the matter oâ that, itâs the flesh and
blood folks are made on as makes the difference. Some cheeses are made oâ
skimmed milk and some oâ new milk, and itâs no matter what you call âem, you
may tell which is which by the look and the smell. But as to Thias Bede, heâs
better out oâ the way nor inâGod forgiâ me for saying soâfor heâs done little
this ten year but make trouble for them as belonged to him; and I think it âud
be well for you to take a little bottle oâ rum for thâ old woman, for I daresay
sheâs got never a drop oâ nothing to comfort her inside. Sit down, child, and
be easy, for you shanât stir out till youâve had a cup oâ tea, and so I tell
you.â

During the latter part of this speech, Mrs. Poyser had been reaching down the
tea-things from the shelves, and was on her way towards the pantry for the loaf
(followed close by Totty, who had made her appearance on the rattling of the
tea-cups), when Hetty came out of the dairy relieving her tired arms by lifting
them up, and clasping her hands at the back of her head.

âMolly,â she said, rather languidly, âjust run out and get me a bunch of
dock-leaves: the butterâs ready to pack up now.â

âDâ you hear whatâs happened, Hetty?â said her aunt.

âNo; how should I hear anything?â was the answer, in a pettish tone.

âNot as youâd care much, I daresay, if you did hear; for youâre too
feather-headed to mind if everybody was dead, so as you could stay upstairs
a-dressing yourself for two hours by the clock. But anybody besides yourself
âud mind about such things happening to them as think a deal more of you than
you deserve. But Adam Bede and all his kin might be drownded for what youâd
careâyouâd be perking at the glass the next minute.â

âAdam Bedeâdrowned?â said Hetty, letting her arms fall and looking rather
bewildered, but suspecting that her aunt was as usual exaggerating with a
didactic purpose.

âNo, my dear, no,â said Dinah kindly, for Mrs. Poyser had passed on to the
pantry without deigning more precise information. âNot Adam. Adamâs father, the
old man, is drowned. He was drowned last night in the Willow Brook. Mr. Irwine
has just told me about it.â

âOh, how dreadful!â said Hetty, looking serious, but not deeply affected; and
as Molly now entered with the dock-leaves, she took them silently and returned
to the dairy without asking further questions.

Chapter IX

Hettyâs World

While she adjusted the broad leaves that set off the pale fragrant butter as
the primrose is set off by its nest of green I am afraid Hetty was thinking a
great deal more of the looks Captain Donnithorne had cast at her than of Adam
and his troubles. Bright, admiring glances from a handsome young gentleman with
white hands, a gold chain, occasional regimentals, and wealth and grandeur
immeasurableâthose were the warm rays that set poor Hettyâs heart vibrating and
playing its little foolish tunes over and over again. We do not hear that
Memnonâs statue gave forth its melody at all under the rushing of the mightiest
wind, or in response to any other influence divine or human than certain
short-lived sunbeams of morning; and we must learn to accommodate ourselves to
the discovery that some of those cunningly fashioned instruments called human
souls have only a very limited range of music, and will not vibrate in the
least under a touch that fills others with tremulous rapture or quivering
agony.

Hetty was quite used to the thought that people liked to look at her. She was
not blind to the fact that young Luke Britton of Broxton came to Hayslope
Church on a Sunday afternoon on purpose that he might see her; and that he
would have made much more decided advances if her uncle Poyser, thinking but
lightly of a young man whose fatherâs land was so foul as old Luke Brittonâs,
had not forbidden her aunt to encourage him by any civilities. She was aware,
too, that Mr. Craig, the gardener at the Chase, was over head and ears in love
with her, and had lately made unmistakable avowals in luscious strawberries and
hyperbolical peas. She knew still better, that Adam Bedeâtall, upright, clever,
brave Adam Bedeâwho carried such authority with all the people round about, and
whom her uncle was always delighted to see of an evening, saying that âAdam
knew a fine sight more oâ the natur oâ things than those as thought themselves
his bettersââshe knew that this Adam, who was often rather stern to other
people and not much given to run after the lasses, could be made to turn pale
or red any day by a word or a look from her. Hettyâs sphere of comparison was
not large, but she couldnât help perceiving that Adam was âsomething likeâ a
man; always knew what to say about things, could tell her uncle how to prop the
hovel, and had mended the churn in no time; knew, with only looking at it, the
value of the chestnut-tree that was blown down, and why the damp came in the
walls, and what they must do to stop the rats; and wrote a beautiful hand that
you could read off, and could do figures in his headâa degree of accomplishment
totally unknown among the richest farmers of that countryside. Not at all like
that slouching Luke Britton, who, when she once walked with him all the way
from Broxton to Hayslope, had only broken silence to remark that the grey goose
had begun to lay. And as for Mr. Craig, the gardener, he was a sensible man
enough, to be sure, but he was knock-kneed, and had a queer sort of sing-song
in his talk; moreover, on the most charitable supposition, he must be far on
the way to forty.

Hetty was quite certain her uncle wanted her to encourage Adam, and would be
pleased for her to marry him. For those were times when there was no rigid
demarcation of rank between the farmer and the respectable artisan, and on the
home hearth, as well as in the public house, they might be seen taking their
jug of ale together; the farmer having a latent sense of capital, and of weight
in parish affairs, which sustained him under his conspicuous inferiority in
conversation. Martin Poyser was not a frequenter of public houses, but he liked
a friendly chat over his own home-brewed; and though it was pleasant to lay
down the law to a stupid neighbour who had no notion how to make the best of
his farm, it was also an agreeable variety to learn something from a clever
fellow like Adam Bede. Accordingly, for the last three yearsâever since he had
superintended the building of the new barnâAdam had always been made welcome at
the Hall Farm, especially of a winter evening, when the whole family, in
patriarchal fashion, master and mistress, children and servants, were assembled
in that glorious kitchen, at well-graduated distances from the blazing fire.
And for the last two years, at least, Hetty had been in the habit of hearing
her uncle say, âAdam Bede may be working for wage now, but heâll be a
master-man some day, as sure as I sit in this chair. Mester Burge is in the
right onât to want him to go partners and marry his daughter, if itâs true what
they say; the woman as marries him âull have a good take, beât Lady day or
Michaelmas,â a remark which Mrs. Poyser always followed up with her cordial
assent. âAh,â she would say, âitâs all very fine having a ready-made rich man,
but mayhappen heâll be a ready-made fool; and itâs no use filling your pocket
full oâ money if youâve got a hole in the corner. Itâll do you no good to sit
in a spring-cart oâ your own, if youâve got a soft to drive you: heâll soon
turn you over into the ditch. I allays said Iâd never marry a man as had got no
brains; for whereâs the use of a woman having brains of her own if sheâs
tackled to a geck as everybodyâs a-laughing at? She might as well dress herself
fine to sit backâards on a donkey.â

These expressions, though figurative, sufficiently indicated the bent of Mrs.
Poyserâs mind with regard to Adam; and though she and her husband might have
viewed the subject differently if Hetty had been a daughter of their own, it
was clear that they would have welcomed the match with Adam for a penniless
niece. For what could Hetty have been but a servant elsewhere, if her uncle had
not taken her in and brought her up as a domestic help to her aunt, whose
health since the birth of Totty had not been equal to more positive labour than
the superintendence of servants and children? But Hetty had never given Adam
any steady encouragement. Even in the moments when she was most thoroughly
conscious of his superiority to her other admirers, she had never brought
herself to think of accepting him. She liked to feel that this strong, skilful,
keen-eyed man was in her power, and would have been indignant if he had shown
the least sign of slipping from under the yoke of her coquettish tyranny and
attaching himself to the gentle Mary Burge, who would have been grateful enough
for the most trifling notice from him. âMary Burge, indeed! Such a sallow-faced
girl: if she put on a bit of pink ribbon, she looked as yellow as a crow-flower
and her hair was as straight as a hank of cotton.â And always when Adam stayed
away for several weeks from the Hall Farm, and otherwise made some show of
resistance to his passion as a foolish one, Hetty took care to entice him back
into the net by little airs of meekness and timidity, as if she were in trouble
at his neglect. But as to marrying Adam, that was a very different affair!
There was nothing in the world to tempt her to do that. Her cheeks never grew a
shade deeper when his name was mentioned; she felt no thrill when she saw him
passing along the causeway by the window, or advancing towards her unexpectedly
in the footpath across the meadow; she felt nothing, when his eyes rested on
her, but the cold triumph of knowing that he loved her and would not care to
look at Mary Burge. He could no more stir in her the emotions that make the
sweet intoxication of young love than the mere picture of a sun can stir the
spring sap in the subtle fibres of the plant. She saw him as he wasâa poor man
with old parents to keep, who would not be able, for a long while to come, to
give her even such luxuries as she shared in her uncleâs house. And Hettyâs
dreams were all of luxuries: to sit in a carpeted parlour, and always wear
white stockings; to have some large beautiful ear-rings, such as were all the
fashion; to have Nottingham lace round the top of her gown, and something to
make her handkerchief smell nice, like Miss Lydia Donnithorneâs when she drew
it out at church; and not to be obliged to get up early or be scolded by
anybody. She thought, if Adam had been rich and could have given her these
things, she loved him well enough to marry him.

But for the last few weeks a new influence had come over Hettyâvague,
atmospheric, shaping itself into no self-confessed hopes or prospects, but
producing a pleasant narcotic effect, making her tread the ground and go about
her work in a sort of dream, unconscious of weight or effort, and showing her
all things through a soft, liquid veil, as if she were living not in this solid
world of brick and stone, but in a beatified world, such as the sun lights up
for us in the waters. Hetty had become aware that Mr. Arthur Donnithorne would
take a good deal of trouble for the chance of seeing her; that he always placed
himself at church so as to have the fullest view of her both sitting and
standing; that he was constantly finding reason for calling at the Hall Farm,
and always would contrive to say something for the sake of making her speak to
him and look at him. The poor child no more conceived at present the idea that
the young squire could ever be her lover than a bakerâs pretty daughter in the
crowd, whom a young emperor distinguishes by an imperial but admiring smile,
conceives that she shall be made empress. But the bakerâs daughter goes home
and dreams of the handsome young emperor, and perhaps weighs the flour amiss
while she is thinking what a heavenly lot it must be to have him for a husband.
And so, poor Hetty had got a face and a presence haunting her waking and
sleeping dreams; bright, soft glances had penetrated her, and suffused her life
with a strange, happy languor. The eyes that shed those glances were really not
half so fine as Adamâs, which sometimes looked at her with a sad, beseeching
tenderness, but they had found a ready medium in Hettyâs little silly
imagination, whereas Adamâs could get no entrance through that atmosphere. For
three weeks, at least, her inward life had consisted of little else than living
through in memory the looks and words Arthur had directed towards herâof little
else than recalling the sensations with which she heard his voice outside the
house, and saw him enter, and became conscious that his eyes were fixed on her,
and then became conscious that a tall figure, looking down on her with eyes
that seemed to touch her, was coming nearer in clothes of beautiful texture
with an odour like that of a flower-garden borne on the evening breeze. Foolish
thoughts! But all this happened, you must remember, nearly sixty years ago, and
Hetty was quite uneducatedâa simple farmerâs girl, to whom a gentleman with a
white hand was dazzling as an Olympian god. Until to-day, she had never looked
farther into the future than to the next time Captain Donnithorne would come to
the Farm, or the next Sunday when she should see him at church; but now she
thought, perhaps he would try to meet her when she went to the Chase
to-morrowâand if he should speak to her, and walk a little way, when nobody was
by! That had never happened yet; and now her imagination, instead of retracing
the past, was busy fashioning what would happen to-morrowâwhereabout in the
Chase she should see him coming towards her, how she should put her new
rose-coloured ribbon on, which he had never seen, and what he would say to her
to make her return his glanceâa glance which she would be living through in her
memory, over and over again, all the rest of the day.

In this state of mind, how could Hetty give any feeling to Adamâs troubles, or
think much about poor old Thias being drowned? Young souls, in such pleasant
delirium as hers are as unsympathetic as butterflies sipping nectar; they are
isolated from all appeals by a barrier of dreamsâby invisible looks and
impalpable arms.

While Hettyâs hands were busy packing up the butter, and her head filled with
these pictures of the morrow, Arthur Donnithorne, riding by Mr. Irwineâs side
towards the valley of the Willow Brook, had also certain indistinct
anticipations, running as an undercurrent in his mind while he was listening to
Mr. Irwineâs account of Dinahâindistinct, yet strong enough to make him feel
rather conscious when Mr. Irwine suddenly said, âWhat fascinated you so in Mrs.
Poyserâs dairy, Arthur? Have you become an amateur of damp quarries and
skimming dishes?â

Arthur knew the rector too well to suppose that a clever invention would be of
any use, so he said, with his accustomed frankness, âNo, I went to look at the
pretty butter-maker Hetty Sorrel. Sheâs a perfect Hebe; and if I were an
artist, I would paint her. Itâs amazing what pretty girls one sees among the
farmersâ daughters, when the men are such clowns. That common, round, red face
one sees sometimes in the menâall cheek and no features, like Martin
Poyserâsâcomes out in the women of the family as the most charming phiz
imaginable.â

âWell, I have no objection to your contemplating Hetty in an artistic light,
but I must not have you feeding her vanity and filling her little noddle with
the notion that sheâs a great beauty, attractive to fine gentlemen, or you will
spoil her for a poor manâs wifeâhonest Craigâs, for example, whom I have seen
bestowing soft glances on her. The little puss seems already to have airs
enough to make a husband as miserable as itâs a law of nature for a quiet man
to be when he marries a beauty. Apropos of marrying, I hope our friend Adam
will get settled, now the poor old manâs gone. He will only have his mother to
keep in future, and Iâve a notion that thereâs a kindness between him and that
nice modest girl, Mary Burge, from something that fell from old Jonathan one
day when I was talking to him. But when I mentioned the subject to Adam he
looked uneasy and turned the conversation. I suppose the love-making doesnât
run smooth, or perhaps Adam hangs back till heâs in a better position. He has
independence of spirit enough for two menârather an excess of pride, if
anything.â

âThat would be a capital match for Adam. He would slip into old Burgeâs shoes
and make a fine thing of that building business, Iâll answer for him. I should
like to see him well settled in this parish; he would be ready then to act as
my grand-vizier when I wanted one. We could plan no end of repairs and
improvements together. Iâve never seen the girl, though, I thinkâat least Iâve
never looked at her.â

âLook at her next Sunday at churchâshe sits with her father on the left of the
reading-desk. You neednât look quite so much at Hetty Sorrel then. When Iâve
made up my mind that I canât afford to buy a tempting dog, I take no notice of
him, because if he took a strong fancy to me and looked lovingly at me, the
struggle between arithmetic and inclination might become unpleasantly severe. I
pique myself on my wisdom there, Arthur, and as an old fellow to whom wisdom
had become cheap, I bestow it upon you.â

âThank you. It may stand me in good stead some day though I donât know that I
have any present use for it. Bless me! How the brook has overflowed. Suppose we
have a canter, now weâre at the bottom of the hill.â

That is the great advantage of dialogue on horseback; it can be merged any
minute into a trot or a canter, and one might have escaped from Socrates
himself in the saddle. The two friends were free from the necessity of further
conversation till they pulled up in the lane behind Adamâs cottage.

Chapter X

Dinah Visits Lisbeth

At five oâclock Lisbeth came downstairs with a large key in her hand: it was
the key of the chamber where her husband lay dead. Throughout the day, except
in her occasional outbursts of wailing grief, she had been in incessant
movement, performing the initial duties to her dead with the awe and exactitude
that belong to religious rites. She had brought out her little store of
bleached linen, which she had for long years kept in reserve for this supreme
use. It seemed but yesterdayâthat time so many midsummers ago, when she had
told Thias where this linen lay, that he might be sure and reach it out for her
when
she
died, for she was the elder of the two. Then there had been the
work of cleansing to the strictest purity every object in the sacred chamber,
and of removing from it every trace of common daily occupation. The small
window, which had hitherto freely let in the frosty moonlight or the warm
summer sunrise on the working manâs slumber, must now be darkened with a fair
white sheet, for this was the sleep which is as sacred under the bare rafters
as in ceiled houses. Lisbeth had even mended a long-neglected and unnoticeable
rent in the checkered bit of bed-curtain; for the moments were few and precious
now in which she would be able to do the smallest office of respect or love for
the still corpse, to which in all her thoughts she attributed some
consciousness. Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them: they
can be injured by us, they can be wounded; they know all our penitence, all our
aching sense that their place is empty, all the kisses we bestow on the
smallest relic of their presence. And the aged peasant woman most of all
believes that her dead are conscious. Decent burial was what Lisbeth had been
thinking of for herself through years of thrift, with an indistinct expectation
that she should know when she was being carried to the churchyard, followed by
her husband and her sons; and now she felt as if the greatest work of her life
were to be done in seeing that Thias was buried decently before herâunder the
white thorn, where once, in a dream, she had thought she lay in the coffin, yet
all the while saw the sunshine above and smelt the white blossoms that were so
thick upon the thorn the Sunday she went to be churched after Adam was born.

But now she had done everything that could be done to-day in the chamber of
deathâhad done it all herself, with some aid from her sons in lifting, for she
would let no one be fetched to help her from the village, not being fond of
female neighbours generally; and her favourite Dolly, the old housekeeper at
Mr. Burgeâs, who had come to condole with her in the morning as soon as she
heard of Thiasâs death, was too dim-sighted to be of much use. She had locked
the door, and now held the key in her hand, as she threw herself wearily into a
chair that stood out of its place in the middle of the house floor, where in
ordinary times she would never have consented to sit. The kitchen had had none
of her attention that day; it was soiled with the tread of muddy shoes and
untidy with clothes and other objects out of place. But what at another time
would have been intolerable to Lisbethâs habits of order and cleanliness seemed
to her now just what should be: it was right that things should look strange
and disordered and wretched, now the old man had come to his end in that sad
way; the kitchen ought not to look as if nothing had happened. Adam, overcome
with the agitations and exertions of the day after his night of hard work, had
fallen asleep on a bench in the workshop; and Seth was in the back kitchen
making a fire of sticks that he might get the kettle to boil, and persuade his
mother to have a cup of tea, an indulgence which she rarely allowed herself.

There was no one in the kitchen when Lisbeth entered and threw herself into the
chair. She looked round with blank eyes at the dirt and confusion on which the
bright afternoonâs sun shone dismally; it was all of a piece with the sad
confusion of her mindâthat confusion which belongs to the first hours of a
sudden sorrow, when the poor human soul is like one who has been deposited
sleeping among the ruins of a vast city, and wakes up in dreary amazement, not
knowing whether it is the growing or the dying dayânot knowing why and whence
came this illimitable scene of desolation, or why he too finds himself desolate
in the midst of it.

At another time Lisbethâs first thought would have been, âWhere is Adam?â but
the sudden death of her husband had restored him in these hours to that first
place in her affections which he had held six-and-twenty years ago. She had
forgotten his faults as we forget the sorrows of our departed childhood, and
thought of nothing but the young husbandâs kindness and the old manâs patience.
Her eyes continued to wander blankly until Seth came in and began to remove
some of the scattered things, and clear the small round deal table that he
might set out his motherâs tea upon it.

âWhat art goinâ to do?â she said, rather peevishly.

âI want thee to have a cup of tea, Mother,â answered Seth, tenderly. âItâll do
thee good; and Iâll put two or three of these things away, and make the house
look more comfortable.â

âComfortable! How canst talk oâ maâinâ things comfortable? Let a-be, let a-be.
Thereâs no comfort for me no more,â she went on, the tears coming when she
began to speak, ânow thy poor feytherâs gone, as Iân washed for and mended, anâ
gotâs victual for him for thirty âear, anâ him allays so pleased wiâ iverything
I done for him, anâ used to be so handy anâ do the jobs for me when I war ill
anâ cumbered wiâ thâ babby, anâ made me the posset anâ brought it upstairs as
proud as could be, anâ carried the lad as war as heavy as two children for five
mile anâ neâer grumbled, all the way to Warson Wake, âcause I wanted to go anâ
see my sister, as war dead anâ gone the very next Christmas as eâer come. Anâ
him to be drownded in the brook as we passed oâer the day we war married anâ
come home together, anâ heâd made them lots oâ shelves for me to put my plates
anâ things on, anâ showed âem me as proud as could be, âcause he knowâd I
should be pleased. Anâ he war to die anâ me not to know, but to be a-sleepinâ
iâ my bed, as if I caredna nought about it. Eh! Anâ me to live to see that! Anâ
us as war young folks once, anâ thought we should do rarely when we war
married. Let a-be, lad, let a-be! I wonna haâ no tay. I carena if I neâer ate
nor drink no more. When one end oâ thâ bridge tumbles down, whereâs thâ use oâ
thâ other stanninâ? I mayâs well die, anâ foller my old man. Thereâs no knowinâ
but heâll want me.â

Here Lisbeth broke from words into moans, swaying herself backwards and
forwards on her chair. Seth, always timid in his behaviour towards his mother,
from the sense that he had no influence over her, felt it was useless to
attempt to persuade or soothe her till this passion was past; so he contented
himself with tending the back kitchen fire and folding up his fatherâs clothes,
which had been hanging out to dry since morningâafraid to move about in the
room where his mother was, lest he should irritate her further.

But after Lisbeth had been rocking herself and moaning for some minutes, she
suddenly paused and said aloud to herself, âIâll go anâ see arter Adam, for I
canna think where heâs gotten; anâ I want him to go upstairs wiâ me afore itâs
dark, for the minutes to look at the corpse is like the meltinâ snow.â

Seth overheard this, and coming into the kitchen again, as his mother rose from
her chair, he said, âAdamâs asleep in the workshop, mother. Theeâdst better not
wake him. He was oâerwrought with work and trouble.â

âWake him? Whoâs a-goinâ to wake him? I shanna wake him wiâ lookinâ at him. I
hanna seen the lad this two hourâIâd welly forgot as heâd eâer growed up from a
babby whenâs feyther carried him.â

Adam was seated on a rough bench, his head supported by his arm, which rested
from the shoulder to the elbow on the long planing-table in the middle of the
workshop. It seemed as if he had sat down for a few minutesâ rest and had
fallen asleep without slipping from his first attitude of sad, fatigued
thought. His face, unwashed since yesterday, looked pallid and clammy; his hair
was tossed shaggily about his forehead, and his closed eyes had the sunken look
which follows upon watching and sorrow. His brow was knit, and his whole face
had an expression of weariness and pain. Gyp was evidently uneasy, for he sat
on his haunches, resting his nose on his masterâs stretched-out leg, and
dividing the time between licking the hand that hung listlessly down and
glancing with a listening air towards the door. The poor dog was hungry and
restless, but would not leave his master, and was waiting impatiently for some
change in the scene. It was owing to this feeling on Gypâs part that, when
Lisbeth came into the workshop and advanced towards Adam as noiselessly as she
could, her intention not to awaken him was immediately defeated; for Gypâs
excitement was too great to find vent in anything short of a sharp bark, and in
a moment Adam opened his eyes and saw his mother standing before him. It was
not very unlike his dream, for his sleep had been little more than living
through again, in a fevered delirious way, all that had happened since
daybreak, and his mother with her fretful grief was present to him through it
all. The chief difference between the reality and the vision was that in his
dream Hetty was continually coming before him in bodily presenceâstrangely
mingling herself as an actor in scenes with which she had nothing to do. She
was even by the Willow Brook; she made his mother angry by coming into the
house; and he met her with her smart clothes quite wet through, as he walked in
the rain to Treddleston, to tell the coroner. But wherever Hetty came, his
mother was sure to follow soon; and when he opened his eyes, it was not at all
startling to see her standing near him.

âEh, my lad, my lad!â Lisbeth burst out immediately, her wailing impulse
returning, for grief in its freshness feels the need of associating its loss
and its lament with every change of scene and incident, âtheeâst got nobody now
but thy old mother to torment thee and be a burden to thee. Thy poor feyther
âull neâer anger thee no more; anâ thy mother mayâs well go arter himâthe
sooner the betterâfor Iâm no good to nobody now. One old coat âull do to patch
another, but itâs good for nought else. Theeâdst like to haâ a wife to mend thy
clothes anâ get thy victual, better nor thy old mother. Anâ I shall be nought
but cumber, a-sittinâ iâ thâ chimney-corner. (Adam winced and moved uneasily;
he dreaded, of all things, to hear his mother speak of Hetty.) But if thy
feyther had lived, heâd neâer haâ wanted me to go to make room for another, for
he could no more haâ done wiâout me nor one side oâ the scissars can do wiâout
thâ other. Eh, we should haâ been both flung away together, anâ then I shouldna
haâ seen this day, anâ one buryinâ âud haâ done for us both.â

Here Lisbeth paused, but Adam sat in pained silenceâhe could not speak
otherwise than tenderly to his mother to-day, but he could not help being
irritated by this plaint. It was not possible for poor Lisbeth to know how it
affected Adam any more than it is possible for a wounded dog to know how his
moans affect the nerves of his master. Like all complaining women, she
complained in the expectation of being soothed, and when Adam said nothing, she
was only prompted to complain more bitterly.

âI know thee couldst do better wiâout me, for thee couldst go where thee
likedst anâ marry them as thee likedst. But I donna want to say thee nay, let
thee bring home who thee wut; Iâd neâer open my lips to find faut, for when
folks is old anâ oâ no use, they may think theirsens well off to get the bit
anâ the sup, though theyân to swallow ill words wiât. Anâ if theeâst set thy
heart on a lass asâll bring thee nought and waste all, when thee mightst haâ
them as âud make a man on thee, Iâll say nought, now thy feytherâs dead anâ
drownded, for Iâm no better nor an old haft when the bladeâs gone.â

Adam, unable to bear this any longer, rose silently from the bench and walked
out of the workshop into the kitchen. But Lisbeth followed him.

âThee wutna go upstairs anâ see thy feyther then? Iân done everythinâ now, anâ
heâd like thee to go anâ look at him, for he war allays so pleased when thee
wast mild to him.â

Adam turned round at once and said, âYes, mother; let us go upstairs. Come,
Seth, let us go together.â

They went upstairs, and for five minutes all was silence. Then the key was
turned again, and there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs. But Adam did
not come down again; he was too weary and worn-out to encounter more of his
motherâs querulous grief, and he went to rest on his bed. Lisbeth no sooner
entered the kitchen and sat down than she threw her apron over her head, and
began to cry and moan and rock herself as before. Seth thought, âShe will be
quieter by and by, now we have been upstairsâ; and he went into the back
kitchen again, to tend his little fire, hoping that he should presently induce
her to have some tea.

Lisbeth had been rocking herself in this way for more than five minutes, giving
a low moan with every forward movement of her body, when she suddenly felt a
hand placed gently on hers, and a sweet treble voice said to her, âDear sister,
the Lord has sent me to see if I can be a comfort to you.â

Lisbeth paused, in a listening attitude, without removing her apron from her
face. The voice was strange to her. Could it be her sisterâs spirit come back
to her from the dead after all those years? She trembled and dared not look.

Dinah, believing that this pause of wonder was in itself a relief for the
sorrowing woman, said no more just yet, but quietly took off her bonnet, and
then, motioning silence to Seth, who, on hearing her voice, had come in with a
beating heart, laid one hand on the back of Lisbethâs chair and leaned over
her, that she might be aware of a friendly presence.

Slowly Lisbeth drew down her apron, and timidly she opened her dim dark eyes.
She saw nothing at first but a faceâa pure, pale face, with loving grey eyes,
and it was quite unknown to her. Her wonder increased; perhaps it
was
an
angel. But in the same instant Dinah had laid her hand on Lisbethâs again, and
the old woman looked down at it. It was a much smaller hand than her own, but
it was not white and delicate, for Dinah had never worn a glove in her life,
and her hand bore the traces of labour from her childhood upwards. Lisbeth
looked earnestly at the hand for a moment, and then, fixing her eyes again on
Dinahâs face, said, with something of restored courage, but in a tone of
surprise, âWhy, yeâre a workinâ woman!â

âYes, I am Dinah Morris, and I work in the cotton-mill when I am at home.â

âAh!â said Lisbeth slowly, still wondering; âye comed in so light, like the
shadow on the wall, anâ spoke iâ my ear, as I thought ye might be a sperrit.
Yeâve got aâmost the face oâ one as is a-sittinâ on the grave iâ Adamâs new
Bible.â

âI come from the Hall Farm now. You know Mrs. Poyserâsheâs my aunt, and she has
heard of your great affliction, and is very sorry; and Iâm come to see if I can
be any help to you in your trouble; for I know your sons Adam and Seth, and I
know you have no daughter; and when the clergyman told me how the hand of God
was heavy upon you, my heart went out towards you, and I felt a command to come
and be to you in the place of a daughter in this grief, if you will let me.â

âAh! I know who yâ are now; yâ are a Methody, like Seth; heâs tould me on you,â
said Lisbeth fretfully, her overpowering sense of pain returning, now her
wonder was gone. âYeâll make it out as troubleâs a good thing, like
he

allays does. But whereâs the use oâ talkinâ to me a-thatân? Ye canna make the
smart less wiâ talkinâ. Yeâll neâer make me believe as itâs better for me not
to haâ my old man die inâs bed, if he must die, anâ haâ the parson to pray by
him, anâ me to sit by him, anâ tell him neâer to mind thâ ill words Iâve giâen
him sometimes when I war angered, anâ to giâ him a bit anâ a sup, as long as a
bit anâ a sup heâd swallow. But eh! To die iâ the cold water, anâ us close to
him, anâ neâer to know; anâ me a-sleepinâ, as if I neâer belonged to him no
more nor if heâd been a journeyman tramp from nobody knows where!â

Here Lisbeth began to cry and rock herself again; and Dinah said, âYes, dear
friend, your affliction is great. It would be hardness of heart to say that
your trouble was not heavy to bear. God didnât send me to you to make light of
your sorrow, but to mourn with you, if you will let me. If you had a table
spread for a feast, and was making merry with your friends, you would think it
was kind to let me come and sit down and rejoice with you, because youâd think
I should like to share those good things; but I should like better to share in
your trouble and your labour, and it would seem harder to me if you denied me
that. You wonât send me away? Youâre not angry with me for coming?â

âNay, nay; angered! who said I war angered? It war good on you to come. Anâ
Seth, why donna ye get her some tay? Ye war in a hurry to get some for me, as
had no need, but ye donna think oâ gettinâ ât for them as wants it. Sit ye
down; sit ye down. I thank you kindly for cominâ, for itâs little wage ye get
by walkinâ through the wet fields to see an old woman like me.... Nay, Iân got
no daughter oâ my ownâneâer had oneâanâ I warna sorry, for theyâre poor queechy
things, gells is; I allays wanted to haâ lads, as could fend for theirsens. Anâ
the lads âull be marryinââI shall haâ daughters enoâ, anâ too many. But now, do
ye make the tay as ye like it, for Iân got no taste iâ my mouth this dayâitâs
all one what I swallerâitâs all got the taste oâ sorrow wiât.â

Dinah took care not to betray that she had had her tea, and accepted Lisbethâs
invitation very readily, for the sake of persuading the old woman herself to
take the food and drink she so much needed after a day of hard work and
fasting.

Seth was so happy now Dinah was in the house that he could not help thinking
her presence was worth purchasing with a life in which grief incessantly
followed upon grief; but the next moment he reproached himselfâit was almost as
if he were rejoicing in his fatherâs sad death. Nevertheless the joy of being
with Dinah
would
triumphâit was like the influence of climate, which no
resistance can overcome. And the feeling even suffused itself over his face so
as to attract his motherâs notice, while she was drinking her tea.

âThee mayâst well talk oâ trouble beinâ a good thing, Seth, for thee thrivâst
onât. Thee lookâst as if thee knowâdst no more oâ care anâ cumber nor when thee
wast a babby a-lyinâ awake iâ thâ cradle. For theeâdst allays lie still wiâ thy
eyes open, anâ Adam neâer âud lie still a minute when he wakened. Thee wast
allays like a bag oâ meal as can neâer be bruisedâthough, for the matter oâ
that, thy poor feyther war just such another. But
ye
âve got the same
look tooâ (here Lisbeth turned to Dinah). âI reckon itâs wiâ beinâ a Methody.
Not as Iâm a-findinâ faut wiâ ye forât, for yeâve no call to be frettinâ, anâ
somehow ye looken sorry too. Eh! Well, if the Methodies are fond oâ trouble,
theyâre like to thrive: itâs a pity they canna haât all, anâ take it away from
them as donna like it. I could haâ giâen âem plenty; for when Iâd gotten my old
man I war worreted from morn till night; and now heâs gone, Iâd be glad for the
worst oâer again.â

âYes,â said Dinah, careful not to oppose any feeling of Lisbethâs, for her
reliance, in her smallest words and deeds, on a divine guidance, always issued
in that finest womanâs tact which proceeds from acute and ready sympathy; âyes,
I remember too, when my dear aunt died, I longed for the sound of her bad cough
in the nights, instead of the silence that came when she was gone. But now,
dear friend, drink this other cup of tea and eat a little more.â

âWhat!â said Lisbeth, taking the cup and speaking in a less querulous tone,
âhad ye got no feyther and mother, then, as ye war so sorry about your aunt?â

âNo, I never knew a father or mother; my aunt brought me up from a baby. She
had no children, for she was never married and she brought me up as tenderly as
if Iâd been her own child.â

âEh, sheâd fine work wiâ ye, Iâll warrant, bringinâ ye up from a babby, anâ her
a lone womanâitâs ill bringinâ up a cade lamb. But I daresay ye warna franzy,
for ye look as if yeâd neâer been angered iâ your life. But what did ye do when
your aunt died, anâ why didna ye come to live in this country, beinâ as Mrs.
Poyserâs your aunt too?â

Dinah, seeing that Lisbethâs attention was attracted, told her the story of her
early lifeâhow she had been brought up to work hard, and what sort of place
Snowfield was, and how many people had a hard life thereâall the details that
she thought likely to interest Lisbeth. The old woman listened, and forgot to
be fretful, unconsciously subject to the soothing influence of Dinahâs face and
voice. After a while she was persuaded to let the kitchen be made tidy; for
Dinah was bent on this, believing that the sense of order and quietude around
her would help in disposing Lisbeth to join in the prayer she longed to pour
forth at her side. Seth, meanwhile, went out to chop wood, for he surmised that
Dinah would like to be left alone with his mother.

Lisbeth sat watching her as she moved about in her still quick way, and said at
last, âYeâve got a notion oâ cleaninâ up. I wouldna mind haâin ye for a
daughter, for ye wouldna spend the ladâs wage iâ fine clothes anâ waste. Yeâre
not like the lasses oâ this countryside. I reckon folks is different at
Snowfield from what they are here.â

âThey have a different sort of life, many of âem,â said Dinah; âthey work at
different thingsâsome in the mill, and many in the mines, in the villages round
about. But the heart of man is the same everywhere, and there are the children
of this world and the children of light there as well as elsewhere. But weâve
many more Methodists there than in this country.â

âWell, I didna know as the Methody women war like ye, for thereâs Will
Maskeryâs wife, as they sayâs a big Methody, isna pleasant to look at, at all.
Iâd as lief look at a tooad. Anâ Iâm thinkinâ I wouldna mind if yeâd stay anâ
sleep here, for I should like to see ye iâ thâ house iâ thâ morninâ. But
mayhappen theyâll be lookin for ye at Mester Poyserâs.â

âNo,â said Dinah, âthey donât expect me, and I should like to stay, if youâll
let me.â

âWell, thereâs room; Iân got my bed laid iâ thâ little room oâer the back
kitchen, anâ ye can lie beside me. Iâd be glad to haâ ye wiâ me to speak to iâ
thâ night, for yeâve got a nice way oâ talkinâ. It puts me iâ mind oâ the
swallows as was under the thack last âear when they fust begun to sing low anâ
soft-like iâ thâ morninâ. Eh, but my old man war fond oâ them birds! Anâ so war
Adam, but theyân neâer comed again this âear. Happen theyâre dead too.â

âThere,â said Dinah, ânow the kitchen looks tidy, and now, dear Motherâfor Iâm
your daughter to-night, you knowâI should like you to wash your face and have a
clean cap on. Do you remember what David did, when God took away his child from
him? While the child was yet alive he fasted and prayed to God to spare it, and
he would neither eat nor drink, but lay on the ground all night, beseeching God
for the child. But when he knew it was dead, he rose up from the ground and
washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes, and ate and drank; and
when they asked him how it was that he seemed to have left off grieving now the
child was dead, he said, âWhile the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for
I said, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me, that the child may
live? But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him back again?
I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.ââ

âEh, thatâs a true word,â said Lisbeth. âYea, my old man wonna come back to me,
but I shall go to himâthe sooner the better. Well, ye may do as ye like wiâ me:
thereâs a clean cap iâ that drawer, anâ Iâll go iâ the back kitchen anâ wash my
face. Anâ Seth, thee mayâst reach down Adamâs new Bible wiâ thâ picters in, anâ
she shall read us a chapter. Eh, I like them wordsââI shall go to him, but he
wonna come back to me.ââ

Dinah and Seth were both inwardly offering thanks for the greater quietness of
spirit that had come over Lisbeth. This was what Dinah had been trying to bring
about, through all her still sympathy and absence from exhortation. From her
girlhood upwards she had had experience among the sick and the mourning, among
minds hardened and shrivelled through poverty and ignorance, and had gained the
subtlest perception of the mode in which they could best be touched and
softened into willingness to receive words of spiritual consolation or warning.
As Dinah expressed it, âshe was never left to herself; but it was always given
her when to keep silence and when to speak.â And do we not all agree to call
rapid thought and noble impulse by the name of inspiration? After our subtlest
analysis of the mental process, we must still say, as Dinah did, that our
highest thoughts and our best deeds are all given to us.

And so there was earnest prayerâthere was faith, love, and hope pouring forth
that evening in the little kitchen. And poor, aged, fretful Lisbeth, without
grasping any distinct idea, without going through any course of religious
emotions, felt a vague sense of goodness and love, and of something right lying
underneath and beyond all this sorrowing life. She couldnât understand the
sorrow; but, for these moments, under the subduing influence of Dinahâs spirit,
she felt that she must be patient and still.

Chapter XI

In the Cottage

It was but half-past four the next morning when Dinah, tired of lying awake
listening to the birds and watching the growing light through the little window
in the garret roof, rose and began to dress herself very quietly, lest she
should disturb Lisbeth. But already some one else was astir in the house, and
had gone downstairs, preceded by Gyp. The dogâs pattering step was a sure sign
that it was Adam who went down; but Dinah was not aware of this, and she
thought it was more likely to be Seth, for he had told her how Adam had stayed
up working the night before. Seth, however, had only just awakened at the sound
of the opening door. The exciting influence of the previous day, heightened at
last by Dinahâs unexpected presence, had not been counteracted by any bodily
weariness, for he had not done his ordinary amount of hard work; and so when he
went to bed; it was not till he had tired himself with hours of tossing
wakefulness that drowsiness came, and led on a heavier morning sleep than was
usual with him.

But Adam had been refreshed by his long rest, and with his habitual impatience
of mere passivity, he was eager to begin the new day and subdue sadness by his
strong will and strong arm. The white mist lay in the valley; it was going to
be a bright warm day, and he would start to work again when he had had his
breakfast.

âThereâs nothing but whatâs bearable as long as a man can work,â he said to
himself; âthe natur oâ things doesnât change, though it seems as if oneâs own
life was nothing but change. The square oâ four is sixteen, and you must
lengthen your lever in proportion to your weight, is as true when a manâs
miserable as when heâs happy; and the best oâ working is, it gives you a grip
hold oâ things outside your own lot.â

As he dashed the cold water over his head and face, he felt completely himself
again, and with his black eyes as keen as ever and his thick black hair all
glistening with the fresh moisture, he went into the workshop to look out the
wood for his fatherâs coffin, intending that he and Seth should carry it with
them to Jonathan Burgeâs and have the coffin made by one of the workmen there,
so that his mother might not see and hear the sad task going forward at home.

He had just gone into the workshop when his quick ear detected a light rapid
foot on the stairsâcertainly not his motherâs. He had been in bed and asleep
when Dinah had come in, in the evening, and now he wondered whose step this
could be. A foolish thought came, and moved him strangely. As if it could be
Hetty! She was the last person likely to be in the house. And yet he felt
reluctant to go and look and have the clear proof that it was some one else. He
stood leaning on a plank he had taken hold of, listening to sounds which his
imagination interpreted for him so pleasantly that the keen strong face became
suffused with a timid tenderness. The light footstep moved about the kitchen,
followed by the sound of the sweeping brush, hardly making so much noise as the
lightest breeze that chases the autumn leaves along the dusty path; and Adamâs
imagination saw a dimpled face, with dark bright eyes and roguish smiles
looking backward at this brush, and a rounded figure just leaning a little to
clasp the handle. A very foolish thoughtâit could not be Hetty; but the only
way of dismissing such nonsense from his head was to go and see
who
it
was, for his fancy only got nearer and nearer to belief while he stood there
listening. He loosed the plank and went to the kitchen door.

âHow do you do, Adam Bede?â said Dinah, in her calm treble, pausing from her
sweeping and fixing her mild grave eyes upon him. âI trust you feel rested and
strengthened again to bear the burden and heat of the day.â

It was like dreaming of the sunshine and awaking in the moonlight. Adam had
seen Dinah several times, but always at the Hall Farm, where he was not very
vividly conscious of any womanâs presence except Hettyâs, and he had only in
the last day or two begun to suspect that Seth was in love with her, so that
his attention had not hitherto been drawn towards her for his brotherâs sake.
But now her slim figure, her plain black gown, and her pale serene face
impressed him with all the force that belongs to a reality contrasted with a
preoccupying fancy. For the first moment or two he made no answer, but looked
at her with the concentrated, examining glance which a man gives to an object
in which he has suddenly begun to be interested. Dinah, for the first time in
her life, felt a painful self-consciousness; there was something in the dark
penetrating glance of this strong man so different from the mildness and
timidity of his brother Seth. A faint blush came, which deepened as she
wondered at it. This blush recalled Adam from his forgetfulness.

âI was quite taken by surprise; it was very good of you to come and see my
mother in her trouble,â he said, in a gentle grateful tone, for his quick mind
told him at once how she came to be there. âI hope my mother was thankful to
have you,â he added, wondering rather anxiously what had been Dinahâs
reception.

âYes,â said Dinah, resuming her work, âshe seemed greatly comforted after a
while, and sheâs had a good deal of rest in the night, by times. She was fast
asleep when I left her.â

âWho was it took the news to the Hall Farm?â said Adam, his thoughts reverting
to some one there; he wondered whether
she
had felt anything about it.

âIt was Mr. Irwine, the clergyman, told me, and my aunt was grieved for your
mother when she heard it, and wanted me to come; and so is my uncle, Iâm sure,
now heâs heard it, but he was gone out to Rosseter all yesterday. Theyâll look
for you there as soon as youâve got time to go, for thereâs nobody round that
hearth but whatâs glad to see you.â

Dinah, with her sympathetic divination, knew quite well that Adam was longing
to hear if Hetty had said anything about their trouble; she was too rigorously
truthful for benevolent invention, but she had contrived to say something in
which Hetty was tacitly included. Love has a way of cheating itself
consciously, like a child who plays at solitary hide-and-seek; it is pleased
with assurances that it all the while disbelieves. Adam liked what Dinah had
said so much that his mind was directly full of the next visit he should pay to
the Hall Farm, when Hetty would perhaps behave more kindly to him than she had
ever done before.

âBut you wonât be there yourself any longer?â he said to Dinah.

âNo, I go back to Snowfield on Saturday, and I shall have to set out to
Treddleston early, to be in time for the Oakbourne carrier. So I must go back
to the farm to-night, that I may have the last day with my aunt and her
children. But I can stay here all to-day, if your mother would like me; and her
heart seemed inclined towards me last night.â

âAh, then, sheâs sure to want you to-day. If mother takes to people at the
beginning, sheâs sure to get fond of âem; but sheâs a strange way of not liking
young women. Though, to be sure,â Adam went on, smiling, âher not liking other
young women is no reason why she shouldnât like you.â

Hitherto Gyp had been assisting at this conversation in motionless silence,
seated on his haunches, and alternately looking up in his masterâs face to
watch its expression and observing Dinahâs movements about the kitchen. The
kind smile with which Adam uttered the last words was apparently decisive with
Gyp of the light in which the stranger was to be regarded, and as she turned
round after putting aside her sweeping-brush, he trotted towards her and put up
his muzzle against her hand in a friendly way.

âYou see Gyp bids you welcome,â said Adam, âand heâs very slow to welcome
strangers.â

âPoor dog!â said Dinah, patting the rough grey coat, âIâve a strange feeling
about the dumb things as if they wanted to speak, and it was a trouble to âem
because they couldnât. I canât help being sorry for the dogs always, though
perhaps thereâs no need. But they may well have more in them than they know how
to make us understand, for we canât say half what we feel, with all our words.â

Seth came down now, and was pleased to find Adam talking with Dinah; he wanted
Adam to know how much better she was than all other women. But after a few
words of greeting, Adam drew him into the workshop to consult about the coffin,
and Dinah went on with her cleaning.

By six oâclock they were all at breakfast with Lisbeth in a kitchen as clean as
she could have made it herself. The window and door were open, and the morning
air brought with it a mingled scent of southernwood, thyme, and sweet-briar
from the patch of garden by the side of the cottage. Dinah did not sit down at
first, but moved about, serving the others with the warm porridge and the
toasted oat-cake, which she had got ready in the usual way, for she had asked
Seth to tell her just what his mother gave them for breakfast. Lisbeth had been
unusually silent since she came downstairs, apparently requiring some time to
adjust her ideas to a state of things in which she came down like a lady to
find all the work done, and sat still to be waited on. Her new sensations
seemed to exclude the remembrance of her grief. At last, after tasting the
porridge, she broke silence:

âYe might haâ made the parridge worse,â she said to Dinah; âI can ate it wiâout
its turninâ my stomach. It might haâ been a trifle thicker anâ no harm, anâ I
allays putten a sprig oâ mint in mysen; but howâs ye tâ know that? The lads
arena like to get folks as âll make their parridge as Iân made it for âem; itâs
well if they get onybody as âll make parridge at all. But ye might do, wiâ a
bit oâ showinâ; for yeâre a stirrinâ body in a morninâ, anâ yeâve a light heel,
anâ yeâve cleaned thâ house well enough for a maâshift.â

âMakeshift, mother?â said Adam. âWhy, I think the house looks beautiful. I
donât know how it could look better.â

âThee dostna know? Nay; howâs thee to know? Thâ men neâer know whether the
floorâs cleaned or cat-licked. But theeâlt know when thee gets thy parridge
burnt, as itâs like enough to be when Iân giâen oâer makinâ it. Theeâlt think
thy mother war good for summat then.â

âDinah,â said Seth, âdo come and sit down now and have your breakfast. Weâre
all served now.â

âAye, come anâ sit ye downâdo,â said Lisbeth, âanâ ate a morsel; yeâd need,
arter beinâ upoâ your legs this hour anâ half aâready. Come, then,â she added,
in a tone of complaining affection, as Dinah sat down by her side, âIâll be
loath for ye tâ go, but ye canna stay much longer, I doubt. I could put up wiâ
ye iâ thâ house better nor wiâ most folks.â

âIâll stay till to-night if youâre willing,â said Dinah. âIâd stay longer, only
Iâm going back to Snowfield on Saturday, and I must be with my aunt to-morrow.â

âEh, Iâd neâer go back to that country. My old man come from that Stonyshire
side, but he left it when he war a young un, anâ iâ the right onât too; for he
said as there war no wood there, anâ it âud haâ been a bad country for a
carpenter.â

âAh,â said Adam, âI remember father telling me when I was a little lad that he
made up his mind if ever he moved it should be southâard. But Iâm not so sure
about it. Bartle Massey saysâand he knows the Southâas the northern men are a
finer breed than the southern, harder-headed and stronger-bodied, and a deal
taller. And then he says in some oâ those counties itâs as flat as the back oâ
your hand, and you can see nothing of a distance without climbing up the
highest trees. I couldnât abide that. I like to go to work by a road thatâll
take me up a bit of a hill, and see the fields for miles round me, and a
bridge, or a town, or a bit of a steeple here and there. It makes you feel the
worldâs a big place, and thereâs other men working in it with their heads and
hands besides yourself.â

âI like thâ hills best,â said Seth, âwhen the clouds are over your head and you
see the sun shining ever so far off, over the Loamford way, as Iâve often done
oâ late, on the stormy days. It seems to me as if that was heaven where thereâs
always joy and sunshine, though this lifeâs dark and cloudy.â

âOh, I love the Stonyshire side,â said Dinah; âI shouldnât like to set my face
towards the countries where theyâre rich in corn and cattle, and the ground so
level and easy to tread; and to turn my back on the hills where the poor people
have to live such a hard life and the men spend their days in the mines away
from the sunlight. Itâs very blessed on a bleak cold day, when the sky is
hanging dark over the hill, to feel the love of God in oneâs soul, and carry it
to the lonely, bare, stone houses, where thereâs nothing else to give comfort.â

âEh!â said Lisbeth, âthatâs very well for ye to talk, as looks welly like the
snowdrop-flowers as haâ lived for days anâ days when Iân gethered âem, wiâ
nothinâ but a drop oâ water anâ a peep oâ daylight; but thâ hungry foulks had
better leave thâ hungry country. It makes less mouths for the scant cake. But,â
she went on, looking at Adam, âdonna thee talk oâ goinâ southâard or northâard,
anâ leavinâ thy feyther and mother iâ the churchyard, anâ goinâ to a country as
they know nothinâ on. Iâll neâer rest iâ my grave if I donna see thee iâ the
churchyard of a Sunday.â

âDonna fear, mother,â said Adam. âIf I hadna made up my mind not to go, I
should haâ been gone before now.â

He had finished his breakfast now, and rose as he was speaking.

âWhat art goinâ to do?â asked Lisbeth. âSet about thy feytherâs coffin?â

âNo, mother,â said Adam; âweâre going to take the wood to the village and have
it made there.â

âNay, my lad, nay,â Lisbeth burst out in an eager, wailing tone; âthee wotna
let nobody make thy feytherâs coffin but thysen? Whoâd make it so well? Anâ him
as knowâd what good work war, anâs got a son as is the head oâ the village anâ
all Treddlesâon too, for cleverness.â

âVery well, mother, if thatâs thy wish, Iâll make the coffin at home; but I
thought thee wouldstna like to hear the work going on.â

âAnâ why shouldna I like ât? Itâs the right thing to be done. Anâ whatâs liking
got to do wiât? Itâs choice oâ mislikings is all Iân got iâ this world. One
morselâs as good as another when your mouthâs out oâ taste. Thee mun set about
it now this morninâ fust thing. I wonna haâ nobody to touch the coffin but
thee.â

Adamâs eyes met Sethâs, which looked from Dinah to him rather wistfully.

âNo, Mother,â he said, âIâll not consent but Seth shall have a hand in it too,
if itâs to be done at home. Iâll go to the village this forenoon, because Mr.
Burge âull want to see me, and Seth shall stay at home and begin the coffin. I
can come back at noon, and then he can go.â

âNay, nay,â persisted Lisbeth, beginning to cry, âIân set my heart onât as thee
shalt maâ thy feytherâs coffin. Theeât so stiff anâ masterful, theeât neâer do
as thy mother wants thee. Thee wast often angered wiâ thy feyther when he war
alive; thee must be the better to him now heâs gone. Heâd haâ thought nothinâ
onât for Seth to maâs coffin.â

âSay no more, Adam, say no more,â said Seth, gently, though his voice told that
he spoke with some effort; âMotherâs in the right. Iâll go to work, and do thee
stay at home.â

He passed into the workshop immediately, followed by Adam; while Lisbeth,
automatically obeying her old habits, began to put away the breakfast things,
as if she did not mean Dinah to take her place any longer. Dinah said nothing,
but presently used the opportunity of quietly joining the brothers in the
workshop.

They had already got on their aprons and paper caps, and Adam was standing with
his left hand on Sethâs shoulder, while he pointed with the hammer in his right
to some boards which they were looking at. Their backs were turned towards the
door by which Dinah entered, and she came in so gently that they were not aware
of her presence till they heard her voice saying, âSeth Bede!â Seth started,
and they both turned round. Dinah looked as if she did not see Adam, and fixed
her eyes on Sethâs face, saying with calm kindness, âI wonât say farewell. I
shall see you again when you come from work. So as Iâm at the farm before dark,
it will be quite soon enough.â

âThank you, Dinah; I should like to walk home with you once more. Itâll perhaps
be the last time.â

There was a little tremor in Sethâs voice. Dinah put out her hand and said,
âYouâll have sweet peace in your mind to-day, Seth, for your tenderness and
long-suffering towards your aged mother.â

She turned round and left the workshop as quickly and quietly as she had
entered it. Adam had been observing her closely all the while, but she had not
looked at him. As soon as she was gone, he said, âI donât wonder at thee for
loving her, Seth. Sheâs got a face like a lily.â

Sethâs soul rushed to his eyes and lips: he had never yet confessed his secret
to Adam, but now he felt a delicious sense of disburdenment, as he answered,
âAye, Addy, I do love herâtoo much, I doubt. But she doesna love me, lad, only
as one child oâ God loves another. Sheâll never love any man as a
husbandâthatâs my belief.â

âNay, lad, thereâs no telling; thee mustna lose heart. Sheâs made out oâ stuff
with a finer grain than most oâ the women; I can see that clear enough. But if
sheâs better than they are in other things, I canna think sheâll fall short of
âem in loving.â

No more was said. Seth set out to the village, and Adam began his work on the
coffin.

âGod help the lad, and me too,â he thought, as he lifted the board. âWeâre like
enough to find life a tough jobâhard work inside and out. Itâs a strange thing
to think of a man as can lift a chair with his teeth and walk fifty mile on
end, trembling and turning hot and cold at only a look from one woman out of
all the rest iâ the world. Itâs a mystery we can give no account of; but no
more we can of the sprouting oâ the seed, for that matter.â

Chapter XII

In the Wood

That same Thursday morning, as Arthur Donnithorne was moving about in his
dressing-room seeing his well-looking British person reflected in the
old-fashioned mirrors, and stared at, from a dingy olive-green piece of
tapestry, by Pharaohâs daughter and her maidens, who ought to have been minding
the infant Moses, he was holding a discussion with himself, which, by the time
his valet was tying the black silk sling over his shoulder, had issued in a
distinct practical resolution.

âI mean to go to Eagledale and fish for a week or so,â he said aloud. âI shall
take you with me, Pym, and set off this morning; so be ready by half-past
eleven.â

The low whistle, which had assisted him in arriving at this resolution, here
broke out into his loudest ringing tenor, and the corridor, as he hurried along
it, echoed to his favourite song from the Beggarâs Opera, âWhen the heart of a
man is oppressed with care.â Not an heroic strain; nevertheless Arthur felt
himself very heroic as he strode towards the stables to give his orders about
the horses. His own approbation was necessary to him, and it was not an
approbation to be enjoyed quite gratuitously; it must be won by a fair amount
of merit. He had never yet forfeited that approbation, and he had considerable
reliance on his own virtues. No young man could confess his faults more
candidly; candour was one of his favourite virtues; and how can a manâs candour
be seen in all its lustre unless he has a few failings to talk of? But he had
an agreeable confidence that his faults were all of a generous kindâimpetuous,
warm-blooded, leonine; never crawling, crafty, reptilian. It was not possible
for Arthur Donnithorne to do anything mean, dastardly, or cruel. âNo! Iâm a
devil of a fellow for getting myself into a hobble, but I always take care the
load shall fall on my own shoulders.â Unhappily, there is no inherent poetical
justice in hobbles, and they will sometimes obstinately refuse to inflict their
worst consequences on the prime offender, in spite of his loudly expressed
wish. It was entirely owing to this deficiency in the scheme of things that
Arthur had ever brought any one into trouble besides himself. He was nothing if
not good-natured; and all his pictures of the future, when he should come into
the estate, were made up of a prosperous, contented tenantry, adoring their
landlord, who would be the model of an English gentlemanâmansion in first-rate
order, all elegance and high tasteâjolly housekeeping, finest stud in
Loamshireâpurse open to all public objectsâin short, everything as different as
possible from what was now associated with the name of Donnithorne. And one of
the first good actions he would perform in that future should be to increase
Irwineâs income for the vicarage of Hayslope, so that he might keep a carriage
for his mother and sisters. His hearty affection for the rector dated from the
age of frocks and trousers. It was an affection partly filial, partly
fraternalâfraternal enough to make him like Irwineâs company better than that
of most younger men, and filial enough to make him shrink strongly from
incurring Irwineâs disapprobation.

You perceive that Arthur Donnithorne was âa good fellowââall his college
friends thought him such. He couldnât bear to see any one uncomfortable; he
would have been sorry even in his angriest moods for any harm to happen to his
grandfather; and his Aunt Lydia herself had the benefit of that
soft-heartedness which he bore towards the whole sex. Whether he would have
self-mastery enough to be always as harmless and purely beneficent as his
good-nature led him to desire, was a question that no one had yet decided
against him; he was but twenty-one, you remember, and we donât inquire too
closely into character in the case of a handsome generous young fellow, who
will have property enough to support numerous peccadilloesâwho, if he should
unfortunately break a manâs legs in his rash driving, will be able to pension
him handsomely; or if he should happen to spoil a womanâs existence for her,
will make it up to her with expensive
bon-bons
, packed up and directed
by his own hand. It would be ridiculous to be prying and analytic in such
cases, as if one were inquiring into the character of a confidential clerk. We
use round, general, gentlemanly epithets about a young man of birth and
fortune; and ladies, with that fine intuition which is the distinguishing
attribute of their sex, see at once that he is ânice.â The chances are that he
will go through life without scandalizing any one; a seaworthy vessel that no
one would refuse to insure. Ships, certainly, are liable to casualties, which
sometimes make terribly evident some flaw in their construction that would
never have been discoverable in smooth water; and many a âgood fellow,â through
a disastrous combination of circumstances, has undergone a like betrayal.

But we have no fair ground for entertaining unfavourable auguries concerning
Arthur Donnithorne, who this morning proves himself capable of a prudent
resolution founded on conscience. One thing is clear: Nature has taken care
that he shall never go far astray with perfect comfort and satisfaction to
himself; he will never get beyond that border-land of sin, where he will be
perpetually harassed by assaults from the other side of the boundary. He will
never be a courtier of Vice, and wear her orders in his button-hole.

It was about ten oâclock, and the sun was shining brilliantly; everything was
looking lovelier for the yesterdayâs rain. It is a pleasant thing on such a
morning to walk along the well-rolled gravel on oneâs way to the stables,
meditating an excursion. But the scent of the stables, which, in a natural
state of things, ought to be among the soothing influences of a manâs life,
always brought with it some irritation to Arthur. There was no having his own
way in the stables; everything was managed in the stingiest fashion. His
grandfather persisted in retaining as head groom an old dolt whom no sort of
lever could move out of his old habits, and who was allowed to hire a
succession of raw Loamshire lads as his subordinates, one of whom had lately
tested a new pair of shears by clipping an oblong patch on Arthurâs bay mare.
This state of things is naturally embittering; one can put up with annoyances
in the house, but to have the stable made a scene of vexation and disgust is a
point beyond what human flesh and blood can be expected to endure long together
without danger of misanthropy.

Old Johnâs wooden, deep-wrinkled face was the first object that met Arthurâs
eyes as he entered the stable-yard, and it quite poisoned for him the bark of
the two bloodhounds that kept watch there. He could never speak quite patiently
to the old blockhead.

âYou must have Meg saddled for me and brought to the door at half-past eleven,
and I shall want Rattler saddled for Pym at the same time. Do you hear?â

âYes, I hear, I hear, Capân,â said old John very deliberately, following the
young master into the stable. John considered a young master as the natural
enemy of an old servant, and young people in general as a poor contrivance for
carrying on the world.

Arthur went in for the sake of patting Meg, declining as far as possible to see
anything in the stables, lest he should lose his temper before breakfast. The
pretty creature was in one of the inner stables, and turned her mild head as
her master came beside her. Little Trot, a tiny spaniel, her inseparable
companion in the stable, was comfortably curled up on her back.

âWell, Meg, my pretty girl,â said Arthur, patting her neck, âweâll have a
glorious canter this morning.â

âNay, your honour, I donna see as that can be,â said John.

âNot be? Why not?â

âWhy, sheâs got lamed.â

âLamed, confound you! What do you mean?â

âWhy, thâ lad took her too close to Daltonâs hosses, anâ one on âem flung out
at her, anâ sheâs got her shank bruised oâ the near foreleg.â

The judicious historian abstains from narrating precisely what ensued. You
understand that there was a great deal of strong language, mingled with
soothing âwho-hoâsâ while the leg was examined; that John stood by with quite
as much emotion as if he had been a cunningly carved crab-tree walking-stick,
and that Arthur Donnithorne presently repassed the iron gates of the
pleasure-ground without singing as he went.

He considered himself thoroughly disappointed and annoyed. There was not
another mount in the stable for himself and his servant besides Meg and
Rattler. It was vexatious; just when he wanted to get out of the way for a week
or two. It seemed culpable in Providence to allow such a combination of
circumstances. To be shut up at the Chase with a broken arm when every other
fellow in his regiment was enjoying himself at Windsorâshut up with his
grandfather, who had the same sort of affection for him as for his parchment
deeds! And to be disgusted at every turn with the management of the house and
the estate! In such circumstances a man necessarily gets in an ill humour, and
works off the irritation by some excess or other. âSalkeld would have drunk a
bottle of port every day,â he muttered to himself, âbut Iâm not well seasoned
enough for that. Well, since I canât go to Eagledale, Iâll have a gallop on
Rattler to Norburne this morning, and lunch with Gawaine.â

Behind this explicit resolution there lay an implicit one. If he lunched with
Gawaine and lingered chatting, he should not reach the Chase again till nearly
five, when Hetty would be safe out of his sight in the housekeeperâs room; and
when she set out to go home, it would be his lazy time after dinner, so he
should keep out of her way altogether. There really would have been no harm in
being kind to the little thing, and it was worth dancing with a dozen ballroom
belles only to look at Hetty for half an hour. But perhaps he had better not
take any more notice of her; it might put notions into her head, as Irwine had
hinted; though Arthur, for his part, thought girls were not by any means so
soft and easily bruised; indeed, he had generally found them twice as cool and
cunning as he was himself. As for any real harm in Hettyâs case, it was out of
the question: Arthur Donnithorne accepted his own bond for himself with perfect
confidence.

So the twelve oâclock sun saw him galloping towards Norburne; and by good
fortune Halsell Common lay in his road and gave him some fine leaps for
Rattler. Nothing like âtakingâ a few bushes and ditches for exorcising a demon;
and it is really astonishing that the Centaurs, with their immense advantages
in this way, have left so bad a reputation in history.

After this, you will perhaps be surprised to hear that although Gawaine was at
home, the hand of the dial in the courtyard had scarcely cleared the last
stroke of three when Arthur returned through the entrance-gates, got down from
the panting Rattler, and went into the house to take a hasty luncheon. But I
believe there have been men since his day who have ridden a long way to avoid a
rencontre, and then galloped hastily back lest they should miss it. It is the
favourite stratagem of our passions to sham a retreat, and to turn sharp round
upon us at the moment we have made up our minds that the day is our own.

âThe capânâs been ridinâ the devilâs own pace,â said Dalton the coachman, whose
person stood out in high relief as he smoked his pipe against the stable wall,
when John brought up Rattler.

âAnâ I wish heâd get the devil to doâs grooming forân,â growled John.

âAye; heâd hev a deal haimabler groom nor what he has now,â observed Daltonâand
the joke appeared to him so good that, being left alone upon the scene, he
continued at intervals to take his pipe from his mouth in order to wink at an
imaginary audience and shake luxuriously with a silent, ventral laughter,
mentally rehearsing the dialogue from the beginning, that he might recite it
with effect in the servantsâ hall.

When Arthur went up to his dressing-room again after luncheon, it was
inevitable that the debate he had had with himself there earlier in the day
should flash across his mind; but it was impossible for him now to dwell on the
remembranceâimpossible to recall the feelings and reflections which had been
decisive with him then, any more than to recall the peculiar scent of the air
that had freshened him when he first opened his window. The desire to see Hetty
had rushed back like an ill-stemmed current; he was amazed himself at the force
with which this trivial fancy seemed to grasp him: he was even rather tremulous
as he brushed his hairâpooh! it was riding in that break-neck way. It was
because he had made a serious affair of an idle matter, by thinking of it as if
it were of any consequence. He would amuse himself by seeing Hetty to-day, and
get rid of the whole thing from his mind. It was all Irwineâs fault. âIf Irwine
had said nothing, I shouldnât have thought half so much of Hetty as of Megâs
lameness.â However, it was just the sort of day for lolling in the Hermitage,
and he would go and finish Dr. Mooreâs
Zeluco
there before dinner. The
Hermitage stood in Fir-tree Groveâthe way Hetty was sure to come in walking
from the Hall Farm. So nothing could be simpler and more natural: meeting Hetty
was a mere circumstance of his walk, not its object.

Arthurâs shadow flitted rather faster among the sturdy oaks of the Chase than
might have been expected from the shadow of a tired man on a warm afternoon,
and it was still scarcely four oâclock when he stood before the tall narrow
gate leading into the delicious labyrinthine wood which skirted one side of the
Chase, and which was called Fir-tree Grove, not because the firs were many, but
because they were few. It was a wood of beeches and limes, with here and there
a light silver-stemmed birchâjust the sort of wood most haunted by the nymphs:
you see their white sunlit limbs gleaming athwart the boughs, or peeping from
behind the smooth-sweeping outline of a tall lime; you hear their soft liquid
laughterâbut if you look with a too curious sacrilegious eye, they vanish
behind the silvery beeches, they make you believe that their voice was only a
running brooklet, perhaps they metamorphose themselves into a tawny squirrel
that scampers away and mocks you from the topmost bough. It was not a grove
with measured grass or rolled gravel for you to tread upon, but with narrow,
hollow-shaped, earthy paths, edged with faint dashes of delicate mossâpaths
which look as if they were made by the free will of the trees and underwood,
moving reverently aside to look at the tall queen of the white-footed nymphs.

It was along the broadest of these paths that Arthur Donnithorne passed, under
an avenue of limes and beeches. It was a still afternoonâthe golden light was
lingering languidly among the upper boughs, only glancing down here and there
on the purple pathway and its edge of faintly sprinkled moss: an afternoon in
which destiny disguises her cold awful face behind a hazy radiant veil,
encloses us in warm downy wings, and poisons us with violet-scented breath.
Arthur strolled along carelessly, with a book under his arm, but not looking on
the ground as meditative men are apt to do; his eyes
would
fix
themselves on the distant bend in the road round which a little figure must
surely appear before long. Ah! There she comes. First a bright patch of colour,
like a tropic bird among the boughs; then a tripping figure, with a round hat
on, and a small basket under her arm; then a deep-blushing, almost frightened,
but bright-smiling girl, making her curtsy with a fluttered yet happy glance,
as Arthur came up to her. If Arthur had had time to think at all, he would have
thought it strange that he should feel fluttered too, be conscious of blushing
tooâin fact, look and feel as foolish as if he had been taken by surprise
instead of meeting just what he expected. Poor things! It was a pity they were
not in that golden age of childhood when they would have stood face to face,
eyeing each other with timid liking, then given each other a little butterfly
kiss, and toddled off to play together. Arthur would have gone home to his
silk-curtained cot, and Hetty to her home-spun pillow, and both would have
slept without dreams, and to-morrow would have been a life hardly conscious of
a yesterday.

Arthur turned round and walked by Hettyâs side without giving a reason. They
were alone together for the first time. What an overpowering presence that
first privacy is! He actually dared not look at this little butter-maker for
the first minute or two. As for Hetty, her feet rested on a cloud, and she was
borne along by warm zephyrs; she had forgotten her rose-coloured ribbons; she
was no more conscious of her limbs than if her childish soul had passed into a
water-lily, resting on a liquid bed and warmed by the midsummer sun-beams. It
may seem a contradiction, but Arthur gathered a certain carelessness and
confidence from his timidity: it was an entirely different state of mind from
what he had expected in such a meeting with Hetty; and full as he was of vague
feeling, there was room, in those moments of silence, for the thought that his
previous debates and scruples were needless.

âYou are quite right to choose this way of coming to the Chase,â he said at
last, looking down at Hetty; âit is so much prettier as well as shorter than
coming by either of the lodges.â

âYes, sir,â Hetty answered, with a tremulous, almost whispering voice. She
didnât know one bit how to speak to a gentleman like Mr. Arthur, and her very
vanity made her more coy of speech.

âDo you come every week to see Mrs. Pomfret?â

âYes, sir, every Thursday, only when sheâs got to go out with Miss
Donnithorne.â

âAnd sheâs teaching you something, is she?â

âYes, sir, the lace-mending as she learnt abroad, and the stocking-mendingâit
looks just like the stocking, you canât tell itâs been mended; and she teaches
me cutting-out too.â

âWhat! are
you
going to be a ladyâs maid?â

âI should like to be one very much indeed.â Hetty spoke more audibly now, but
still rather tremulously; she thought, perhaps she seemed as stupid to Captain
Donnithorne as Luke Britton did to her.

âI suppose Mrs. Pomfret always expects you at this time?â

âShe expects me at four oâclock. Iâm rather late to-day, because my aunt
couldnât spare me; but the regular time is four, because that gives us time
before Miss Donnithorneâs bell rings.â

âAh, then, I must not keep you now, else I should like to show you the
Hermitage. Did you ever see it?â

âNo, sir.â

âThis is the walk where we turn up to it. But we must not go now. Iâll show it
you some other time, if youâd like to see it.â

âYes, please, sir.â

âDo you always come back this way in the evening, or are you afraid to come so
lonely a road?â

âOh no, sir, itâs never late; I always set out by eight oâclock, and itâs so
light now in the evening. My aunt would be angry with me if I didnât get home
before nine.â

âPerhaps Craig, the gardener, comes to take care of you?â

A deep blush overspread Hettyâs face and neck. âIâm sure he doesnât; Iâm sure
he never did; I wouldnât let him; I donât like him,â she said hastily, and the
tears of vexation had come so fast that before she had done speaking a bright
drop rolled down her hot cheek. Then she felt ashamed to death that she was
crying, and for one long instant her happiness was all gone. But in the next
she felt an arm steal round her, and a gentle voice said, âWhy, Hetty, what
makes you cry? I didnât mean to vex you. I wouldnât vex you for the world, you
little blossom. Come, donât cry; look at me, else I shall think you wonât
forgive me.â

Arthur had laid his hand on the soft arm that was nearest to him, and was
stooping towards Hetty with a look of coaxing entreaty. Hetty lifted her long
dewy lashes, and met the eyes that were bent towards her with a sweet, timid,
beseeching look. What a space of time those three moments were while their eyes
met and his arms touched her! Love is such a simple thing when we have only
one-and-twenty summers and a sweet girl of seventeen trembles under our glance,
as if she were a bud first opening her heart with wondering rapture to the
morning. Such young unfurrowed souls roll to meet each other like two velvet
peaches that touch softly and are at rest; they mingle as easily as two
brooklets that ask for nothing but to entwine themselves and ripple with
ever-interlacing curves in the leafiest hiding-places. While Arthur gazed into
Hettyâs dark beseeching eyes, it made no difference to him what sort of English
she spoke; and even if hoops and powder had been in fashion, he would very
likely not have been sensible just then that Hetty wanted those signs of high
breeding.

But they started asunder with beating hearts: something had fallen on the
ground with a rattling noise; it was Hettyâs basket; all her little workwomanâs
matters were scattered on the path, some of them showing a capability of
rolling to great lengths. There was much to be done in picking up, and not a
word was spoken; but when Arthur hung the basket over her arm again, the poor
child felt a strange difference in his look and manner. He just pressed her
hand, and said, with a look and tone that were almost chilling to her, âI have
been hindering you; I must not keep you any longer now. You will be expected at
the house. Good-bye.â

Without waiting for her to speak, he turned away from her and hurried back
towards the road that led to the Hermitage, leaving Hetty to pursue her way in
a strange dream that seemed to have begun in bewildering delight and was now
passing into contrarieties and sadness. Would he meet her again as she came
home? Why had he spoken almost as if he were displeased with her? And then run
away so suddenly? She cried, hardly knowing why.

Arthur too was very uneasy, but his feelings were lit up for him by a more
distinct consciousness. He hurried to the Hermitage, which stood in the heart
of the wood, unlocked the door with a hasty wrench, slammed it after him,
pitched
Zeluco
into the most distant corner, and thrusting his right
hand into his pocket, first walked four or five times up and down the scanty
length of the little room, and then seated himself on the ottoman in an
uncomfortable stiff way, as we often do when we wish not to abandon ourselves
to feeling.

He was getting in love with Hettyâthat was quite plain. He was ready to pitch
everything elseâno matter whereâfor the sake of surrendering himself to this
delicious feeling which had just disclosed itself. It was no use blinking the
fact nowâthey would get too fond of each other, if he went on taking notice of
herâand what would come of it? He should have to go away in a few weeks, and
the poor little thing would be miserable. He
must not
see her alone
again; he must keep out of her way. What a fool he was for coming back from
Gawaineâs!

He got up and threw open the windows, to let in the soft breath of the
afternoon, and the healthy scent of the firs that made a belt round the
Hermitage. The soft air did not help his resolution, as he leaned out and
looked into the leafy distance. But he considered his resolution sufficiently
fixed: there was no need to debate with himself any longer. He had made up his
mind not to meet Hetty again; and now he might give himself up to thinking how
immensely agreeable it would be if circumstances were differentâhow pleasant it
would have been to meet her this evening as she came back, and put his arm
round her again and look into her sweet face. He wondered if the dear little
thing were thinking of him tooâtwenty to one she was. How beautiful her eyes
were with the tear on their lashes! He would like to satisfy his soul for a day
with looking at them, and he
must
see her againâhe must see her, simply
to remove any false impression from her mind about his manner to her just now.
He would behave in a quiet, kind way to herâjust to prevent her from going home
with her head full of wrong fancies. Yes, that would be the best thing to do
after all.

It was a long whileâmore than an hour before Arthur had brought his meditations
to this point; but once arrived there, he could stay no longer at the
Hermitage. The time must be filled up with movement until he should see Hetty
again. And it was already late enough to go and dress for dinner, for his
grandfatherâs dinner-hour was six.

Chapter XIII

Evening in the Wood

It happened that Mrs. Pomfret had had a slight quarrel with Mrs. Best, the
housekeeper, on this Thursday morningâa fact which had two consequences highly
convenient to Hetty. It caused Mrs. Pomfret to have tea sent up to her own
room, and it inspired that exemplary ladyâs maid with so lively a recollection
of former passages in Mrs. Bestâs conduct, and of dialogues in which Mrs. Best
had decidedly the inferiority as an interlocutor with Mrs. Pomfret, that Hetty
required no more presence of mind than was demanded for using her needle, and
throwing in an occasional âyesâ or âno.â She would have wanted to put on her
hat earlier than usual; only she had told Captain Donnithorne that she usually
set out about eight oâclock, and if he
should
go to the Grove again
expecting to see her, and she should be gone! Would he come? Her little
butterfly soul fluttered incessantly between memory and dubious expectation. At
last the minute-hand of the old-fashioned brazen-faced timepiece was on the
last quarter to eight, and there was every reason for its being time to get
ready for departure. Even Mrs. Pomfretâs preoccupied mind did not prevent her
from noticing what looked like a new flush of beauty in the little thing as she
tied on her hat before the looking-glass.

âThat child gets prettier and prettier every day, I do believe,â was her inward
comment. âThe moreâs the pity. Sheâll get neither a place nor a husband any the
sooner for it. Sober well-to-do men donât like such pretty wives. When I was a
girl, I was more admired than if I had been so very pretty. However, sheâs
reason to be grateful to me for teaching her something to get her bread with,
better than farm-house work. They always told me I was good-naturedâand thatâs
the truth, and to my hurt too, else thereâs them in this house that wouldnât be
here now to lord it over me in the housekeeperâs room.â

Hetty walked hastily across the short space of pleasure-ground which she had to
traverse, dreading to meet Mr. Craig, to whom she could hardly have spoken
civilly. How relieved she was when she had got safely under the oaks and among
the fern of the Chase! Even then she was as ready to be startled as the deer
that leaped away at her approach. She thought nothing of the evening light that
lay gently in the grassy alleys between the fern, and made the beauty of their
living green more visible than it had been in the overpowering flood of noon:
she thought of nothing that was present. She only saw something that was
possible: Mr. Arthur Donnithorne coming to meet her again along the Fir-tree
Grove. That was the foreground of Hettyâs picture; behind it lay a bright hazy
somethingâdays that were not to be as the other days of her life had been. It
was as if she had been wooed by a river-god, who might any time take her to his
wondrous halls below a watery heaven. There was no knowing what would come,
since this strange entrancing delight had come. If a chest full of lace and
satin and jewels had been sent her from some unknown source, how could she but
have thought that her whole lot was going to change, and that to-morrow some
still more bewildering joy would befall her? Hetty had never read a novel; if
she had ever seen one, I think the words would have been too hard for her; how
then could she find a shape for her expectations? They were as formless as the
sweet languid odours of the garden at the Chase, which had floated past her as
she walked by the gate.

She is at another gate nowâthat leading into Fir-tree Grove. She enters the
wood, where it is already twilight, and at every step she takes, the fear at
her heart becomes colder. If he should not come! Oh, how dreary it wasâthe
thought of going out at the other end of the wood, into the unsheltered road,
without having seen him. She reaches the first turning towards the Hermitage,
walking slowlyâhe is not there. She hates the leveret that runs across the
path; she hates everything that is not what she longs for. She walks on, happy
whenever she is coming to a bend in the road, for perhaps he is behind it. No.
She is beginning to cry: her heart has swelled so, the tears stand in her eyes;
she gives one great sob, while the corners of her mouth quiver, and the tears
roll down.

She doesnât know that there is another turning to the Hermitage, that she is
close against it, and that Arthur Donnithorne is only a few yards from her,
full of one thought, and a thought of which she only is the object. He is going
to see Hetty again: that is the longing which has been growing through the last
three hours to a feverish thirst. Not, of course, to speak in the caressing way
into which he had unguardedly fallen before dinner, but to set things right
with her by a kindness which would have the air of friendly civility, and
prevent her from running away with wrong notions about their mutual relation.

If Hetty had known he was there, she would not have cried; and it would have
been better, for then Arthur would perhaps have behaved as wisely as he had
intended. As it was, she started when he appeared at the end of the side-alley,
and looked up at him with two great drops rolling down her cheeks. What else
could he do but speak to her in a soft, soothing tone, as if she were a
bright-eyed spaniel with a thorn in her foot?

âHas something frightened you, Hetty? Have you seen anything in the wood? Donât
be frightenedâIâll take care of you now.â

Hetty was blushing so, she didnât know whether she was happy or miserable. To
be crying againâwhat did gentlemen think of girls who cried in that way? She
felt unable even to say âno,â but could only look away from him and wipe the
tears from her cheek. Not before a great drop had fallen on her rose-coloured
stringsâshe knew that quite well.

âCome, be cheerful again. Smile at me, and tell me whatâs the matter. Come,
tell me.â

Hetty turned her head towards him, whispered, âI thought you wouldnât come,â
and slowly got courage to lift her eyes to him. That look was too much: he must
have had eyes of Egyptian granite not to look too lovingly in return.

âYou little frightened bird! Little tearful rose! Silly pet! You wonât cry
again, now Iâm with you, will you?â

Ah, he doesnât know in the least what he is saying. This is not what he meant
to say. His arm is stealing round the waist again; it is tightening its clasp;
he is bending his face nearer and nearer to the round cheek; his lips are
meeting those pouting child-lips, and for a long moment time has vanished. He
may be a shepherd in Arcadia for aught he knows, he may be the first youth
kissing the first maiden, he may be Eros himself, sipping the lips of Psycheâit
is all one.

There was no speaking for minutes after. They walked along with beating hearts
till they came within sight of the gate at the end of the wood. Then they
looked at each other, not quite as they had looked before, for in their eyes
there was the memory of a kiss.

But already something bitter had begun to mingle itself with the fountain of
sweets: already Arthur was uncomfortable. He took his arm from Hettyâs waist,
and said, âHere we are, almost at the end of the Grove. I wonder how late it
is,â he added, pulling out his watch. âTwenty minutes past eightâbut my watch
is too fast. However, Iâd better not go any further now. Trot along quickly
with your little feet, and get home safely. Good-bye.â

He took her hand, and looked at her half-sadly, half with a constrained smile.
Hettyâs eyes seemed to beseech him not to go away yet; but he patted her cheek
and said âGood-byeâ again. She was obliged to turn away from him and go on.

As for Arthur, he rushed back through the wood, as if he wanted to put a wide
space between himself and Hetty. He would not go to the Hermitage again; he
remembered how he had debated with himself there before dinner, and it had all
come to nothingâworse than nothing. He walked right on into the Chase, glad to
get out of the Grove, which surely was haunted by his evil genius. Those
beeches and smooth limesâthere was something enervating in the very sight of
them; but the strong knotted old oaks had no bending languor in themâthe sight
of them would give a man some energy. Arthur lost himself among the narrow
openings in the fern, winding about without seeking any issue, till the
twilight deepened almost to night under the great boughs, and the hare looked
black as it darted across his path.

He was feeling much more strongly than he had done in the morning: it was as if
his horse had wheeled round from a leap and dared to dispute his mastery. He
was dissatisfied with himself, irritated, mortified. He no sooner fixed his
mind on the probable consequences of giving way to the emotions which had
stolen over him to-dayâof continuing to notice Hetty, of allowing himself any
opportunity for such slight caresses as he had been betrayed into alreadyâthan
he refused to believe such a future possible for himself. To flirt with Hetty
was a very different affair from flirting with a pretty girl of his own
station: that was understood to be an amusement on both sides, or, if it became
serious, there was no obstacle to marriage. But this little thing would be
spoken ill of directly, if she happened to be seen walking with him; and then
those excellent people, the Poysers, to whom a good name was as precious as if
they had the best blood in the land in their veinsâhe should hate himself if he
made a scandal of that sort, on the estate that was to be his own some day, and
among tenants by whom he liked, above all, to be respected. He could no more
believe that he should so fall in his own esteem than that he should break both
his legs and go on crutches all the rest of his life. He couldnât imagine
himself in that position; it was too odious, too unlike him.

And even if no one knew anything about it, they might get too fond of each
other, and then there could be nothing but the misery of parting, after all. No
gentleman, out of a ballad, could marry a farmerâs niece. There must be an end
to the whole thing at once. It was too foolish.

And yet he had been so determined this morning, before he went to Gawaineâs;
and while he was there something had taken hold of him and made him gallop
back. It seemed he couldnât quite depend on his own resolution, as he had
thought he could; he almost wished his arm would get painful again, and then he
should think of nothing but the comfort it would be to get rid of the pain.
There was no knowing what impulse might seize him to-morrow, in this confounded
place, where there was nothing to occupy him imperiously through the livelong
day. What could he do to secure himself from any more of this folly?

There was but one resource. He would go and tell Irwineâtell him everything.
The mere act of telling it would make it seem trivial; the temptation would
vanish, as the charm of fond words vanishes when one repeats them to the
indifferent. In every way it would help him to tell Irwine. He would ride to
Broxton Rectory the first thing after breakfast to-morrow.

Arthur had no sooner come to this determination than he began to think which of
the paths would lead him home, and made as short a walk thither as he could. He
felt sure he should sleep now: he had had enough to tire him, and there was no
more need for him to think.

Chapter XIV

The Return Home

While that parting in the wood was happening, there was a parting in the
cottage too, and Lisbeth had stood with Adam at the door, straining her aged
eyes to get the last glimpse of Seth and Dinah, as they mounted the opposite
slope.

âEh, Iâm loath to see the last on her,â she said to Adam, as they turned into
the house again. âIâd haâ been willinâ tâ haâ her about me till I died and went
to lie by my old man. Sheâd make it easier dyinââshe spakes so gentle anâ moves
about so still. I could be fast sure that picturâ was drawed for her iâ thy new
Bibleâthâ angel a-sittinâ on the big stone by the grave. Eh, I wouldna mind
haâin a daughter like that; but nobody neâer marries them as is good for
aught.â

âWell, Mother, I hope thee wilt have her for a daughter; for Sethâs got a
liking for her, and I hope sheâll get a liking for Seth in time.â

âWhereâs thâ use oâ talkinâ a-thatân? She caresna for Seth. Sheâs goinâ away
twenty mile aff. Howâs she to get a likinâ for him, Iâd like to know? No more
nor the cake âull come wiâout the leaven. Thy figurinâ books might haâ tould
thee better nor that, I should think, else thee mightst as well read the commin
print, as Seth allays does.â

âNay, Mother,â said Adam, laughing, âthe figures tell us a fine deal, and we
couldnât go far without âem, but they donât tell us about folksâs feelings.
Itâs a nicer job to calculate
them
. But Sethâs as good-hearted a lad as
ever handled a tool, and plenty oâ sense, and good-looking too; and heâs got
the same way oâ thinking as Dinah. He deserves to win her, though thereâs no
denying sheâs a rare bit oâ workmanship. You donât see such women turned off
the wheel every day.â

âEh, theeât allays stick up for thy brother. Theeâst been just the same, eâer
sinâ ye war little uns together. Thee wart allays for halving iverything wiâ
him. But whatâs Seth got to do with marryinâ, as is onây three-anâ-twenty? Heâd
more need to learn anâ lay by sixpence. Anâ as for his desarving herâsheâs two
âear older nor Seth: sheâs pretty near as old as thee. But thatâs the way;
folks mun allays choose by contrairies, as if they must be sorted like the
porkâa bit oâ good meat wiâ a bit oâ offal.â

To the feminine mind in some of its moods, all things that might be receive a
temporary charm from comparison with what is; and since Adam did not want to
marry Dinah himself, Lisbeth felt rather peevish on that scoreâas peevish as
she would have been if he
had
wanted to marry her, and so shut himself
out from Mary Burge and the partnership as effectually as by marrying Hetty.

It was more than half-past eight when Adam and his mother were talking in this
way, so that when, about ten minutes later, Hetty reached the turning of the
lane that led to the farmyard gate, she saw Dinah and Seth approaching it from
the opposite direction, and waited for them to come up to her. They, too, like
Hetty, had lingered a little in their walk, for Dinah was trying to speak words
of comfort and strength to Seth in these parting moments. But when they saw
Hetty, they paused and shook hands; Seth turned homewards, and Dinah came on
alone.

âSeth Bede would have come and spoken to you, my dear,â she said, as she
reached Hetty, âbut heâs very full of trouble to-night.â

Hetty answered with a dimpled smile, as if she did not quite know what had been
said; and it made a strange contrast to see that sparkling self-engrossed
loveliness looked at by Dinahâs calm pitying face, with its open glance which
told that her heart lived in no cherished secrets of its own, but in feelings
which it longed to share with all the world. Hetty liked Dinah as well as she
had ever liked any woman; how was it possible to feel otherwise towards one who
always put in a kind word for her when her aunt was finding fault, and who was
always ready to take Totty off her handsâlittle tiresome Totty, that was made
such a pet of by every one, and that Hetty could see no interest in at all?
Dinah had never said anything disapproving or reproachful to Hetty during her
whole visit to the Hall Farm; she had talked to her a great deal in a serious
way, but Hetty didnât mind that much, for she never listened: whatever Dinah
might say, she almost always stroked Hettyâs cheek after it, and wanted to do
some mending for her. Dinah was a riddle to her; Hetty looked at her much in
the same way as one might imagine a little perching bird that could only
flutter from bough to bough, to look at the swoop of the swallow or the
mounting of the lark; but she did not care to solve such riddles, any more than
she cared to know what was meant by the pictures in the Pilgrimâs Progress, or
in the old folio Bible that Marty and Tommy always plagued her about on a
Sunday.

Dinah took her hand now and drew it under her own arm.

âYou look very happy to-night, dear child,â she said. âI shall think of you
often when Iâm at Snowfield, and see your face before me as it is now. Itâs a
strange thingâsometimes when Iâm quite alone, sitting in my room with my eyes
closed, or walking over the hills, the people Iâve seen and known, if itâs only
been for a few days, are brought before me, and I hear their voices and see
them look and move almost plainer than I ever did when they were really with me
so as I could touch them. And then my heart is drawn out towards them, and I
feel their lot as if it was my own, and I take comfort in spreading it before
the Lord and resting in His love, on their behalf as well as my own. And so I
feel sure you will come before me.â

She paused a moment, but Hetty said nothing.

âIt has been a very precious time to me,â Dinah went on, âlast night and
to-dayâseeing two such good sons as Adam and Seth Bede. They are so tender and
thoughtful for their aged mother. And she has been telling me what Adam has
done, for these many years, to help his father and his brother; itâs wonderful
what a spirit of wisdom and knowledge he has, and how heâs ready to use it all
in behalf of them that are feeble. And Iâm sure he has a loving spirit too.
Iâve noticed it often among my own people round Snowfield, that the strong,
skilful men are often the gentlest to the women and children; and itâs pretty
to see âem carrying the little babies as if they were no heavier than little
birds. And the babies always seem to like the strong arm best. I feel sure it
would be so with Adam Bede. Donât you think so, Hetty?â

âYes,â said Hetty abstractedly, for her mind had been all the while in the
wood, and she would have found it difficult to say what she was assenting to.
Dinah saw she was not inclined to talk, but there would not have been time to
say much more, for they were now at the yard-gate.

The still twilight, with its dying western red and its few faint struggling
stars, rested on the farm-yard, where there was not a sound to be heard but the
stamping of the cart-horses in the stable. It was about twenty minutes after
sunset. The fowls were all gone to roost, and the bull-dog lay stretched on the
straw outside his kennel, with the black-and-tan terrier by his side, when the
falling-to of the gate disturbed them and set them barking, like good
officials, before they had any distinct knowledge of the reason.

The barking had its effect in the house, for, as Dinah and Hetty approached,
the doorway was filled by a portly figure, with a ruddy black-eyed face which
bore in it the possibility of looking extremely acute, and occasionally
contemptuous, on market-days, but had now a predominant after-supper expression
of hearty good-nature. It is well known that great scholars who have shown the
most pitiless acerbity in their criticism of other menâs scholarship have yet
been of a relenting and indulgent temper in private life; and I have heard of a
learned man meekly rocking the twins in the cradle with his left hand, while
with his right he inflicted the most lacerating sarcasms on an opponent who had
betrayed a brutal ignorance of Hebrew. Weaknesses and errors must be
forgivenâalas! they are not alien to usâbut the man who takes the wrong side on
the momentous subject of the Hebrew points must be treated as the enemy of his
race. There was the same sort of antithetic mixture in Martin Poyser: he was of
so excellent a disposition that he had been kinder and more respectful than
ever to his old father since he had made a deed of gift of all his property,
and no man judged his neighbours more charitably on all personal matters; but
for a farmer, like Luke Britton, for example, whose fallows were not well
cleaned, who didnât know the rudiments of hedging and ditching, and showed but
a small share of judgment in the purchase of winter stock, Martin Poyser was as
hard and implacable as the north-east wind. Luke Britton could not make a
remark, even on the weather, but Martin Poyser detected in it a taint of that
unsoundness and general ignorance which was palpable in all his farming
operations. He hated to see the fellow lift the pewter pint to his mouth in the
bar of the Royal George on market-day, and the mere sight of him on the other
side of the road brought a severe and critical expression into his black eyes,
as different as possible from the fatherly glance he bent on his two nieces as
they approached the door. Mr. Poyser had smoked his evening pipe, and now held
his hands in his pockets, as the only resource of a man who continues to sit up
after the dayâs business is done.

âWhy, lasses, yeâre rather late to-night,â he said, when they reached the
little gate leading into the causeway. âThe motherâs begun to fidget about you,
anâ sheâs got the little un ill. Anâ how did you leave the old woman Bede,
Dinah? Is she much down about the old man? Heâd been but a poor bargain to her
this five year.â

âSheâs been greatly distressed for the loss of him,â said Dinah, âbut sheâs
seemed more comforted to-day. Her son Adamâs been at home all day, working at
his fatherâs coffin, and she loves to have him at home. Sheâs been talking
about him to me almost all the day. She has a loving heart, though sheâs sorely
given to fret and be fearful. I wish she had a surer trust to comfort her in
her old age.â

âAdamâs sure enough,â said Mr. Poyser, misunderstanding Dinahâs wish. âThereâs
no fear but heâll yield well iâ the threshing. Heâs not one oâ them as is all
straw and no grain. Iâll be bond for him any day, as heâll be a good son to the
last. Did he say heâd be coming to see us soon? But come in, come in,â he
added, making way for them; âI hadnât need keep yâ out any longer.â

The tall buildings round the yard shut out a good deal of the sky, but the
large window let in abundant light to show every corner of the house-place.

Mrs. Poyser, seated in the rocking-chair, which had been brought out of the
âright-hand parlour,â was trying to soothe Totty to sleep. But Totty was not
disposed to sleep; and when her cousins entered, she raised herself up and
showed a pair of flushed cheeks, which looked fatter than ever now they were
defined by the edge of her linen night-cap.

In the large wicker-bottomed arm-chair in the left-hand chimney-nook sat old
Martin Poyser, a hale but shrunken and bleached image of his portly
black-haired sonâhis head hanging forward a little, and his elbows pushed
backwards so as to allow the whole of his forearm to rest on the arm of the
chair. His blue handkerchief was spread over his knees, as was usual indoors,
when it was not hanging over his head; and he sat watching what went forward
with the quiet
outward
glance of healthy old age, which, disengaged from
any interest in an inward drama, spies out pins upon the floor, follows oneâs
minutest motions with an unexpectant purposeless tenacity, watches the
flickering of the flame or the sun-gleams on the wall, counts the quarries on
the floor, watches even the hand of the clock, and pleases itself with
detecting a rhythm in the tick.

âWhat a time oâ night this is to come home, Hetty!â said Mrs. Poyser. âLook at
the clock, do; why, itâs going on for half-past nine, and Iâve sent the gells
to bed this half-hour, and late enough too; when theyâve got to get up at half
after four, and the mowersâ bottles to fill, and the baking; and hereâs this
blessed child wiâ the fever for what I know, and as wakeful as if it was
dinner-time, and nobody to help me to give her the physic but your uncle, and
fine work thereâs been, and half of it spilt on her night-gownâitâs well if
sheâs swallowed more nor âull make her worse iâstead oâ better. But folks as
have no mind to be oâ use have allays the luck to be out oâ the road when
thereâs anything to be done.â

âI did set out before eight, aunt,â said Hetty, in a pettish tone, with a
slight toss of her head. âBut this clockâs so much before the clock at the
Chase, thereâs no telling what time itâll be when I get here.â

âWhat! Youâd be wanting the clock set by gentlefolksâs time, would you? Anâ sit
up burninâ candle, anâ lie a-bed wiâ the sun a-bakinâ you like a cowcumber iâ
the frame? The clock hasnât been put forrard for the first time to-day, I
reckon.â

The fact was, Hetty had really forgotten the difference of the clocks when she
told Captain Donnithorne that she set out at eight, and this, with her
lingering pace, had made her nearly half an hour later than usual. But here her
auntâs attention was diverted from this tender subject by Totty, who,
perceiving at length that the arrival of her cousins was not likely to bring
anything satisfactory to her in particular, began to cry, âMunny, munny,â in an
explosive manner.

âWell, then, my pet, Motherâs got her, Mother wonât leave her; Totty be a good
dilling, and go to sleep now,â said Mrs. Poyser, leaning back and rocking the
chair, while she tried to make Totty nestle against her. But Totty only cried
louder, and said, âDonât yock!â So the mother, with that wondrous patience
which love gives to the quickest temperament, sat up again, and pressed her
cheek against the linen night-cap and kissed it, and forgot to scold Hetty any
longer.

âCome, Hetty,â said Martin Poyser, in a conciliatory tone, âgo and get your
supper iâ the pantry, as the things are all put away; anâ then you can come and
take the little un while your aunt undresses herself, for she wonât lie down in
bed without her mother. Anâ I reckon
you
could eat a bit, Dinah, for
they donât keep much of a house down there.â

âNo, thank you, Uncle,â said Dinah; âI ate a good meal before I came away, for
Mrs. Bede would make a kettle-cake for me.â

âI donât want any supper,â said Hetty, taking off her hat. âI can hold Totty
now, if Aunt wants me.â

âWhy, what nonsense that is to talk!â said Mrs. Poyser. âDo you think you can
live wiâout eatinâ, anâ nourish your inside wiâ stickinâ red ribbons on your
head? Go anâ get your supper this minute, child; thereâs a nice bit oâ cold
pudding iâ the safeâjust what youâre fond of.â

Hetty complied silently by going towards the pantry, and Mrs. Poyser went on
speaking to Dinah.

âSit down, my dear, anâ look as if you knowed what it was to make yourself a
bit comfortable iâ the world. I warrant the old woman was glad to see you,
since you stayed so long.â

âShe seemed to like having me there at last; but her sons say she doesnât like
young women about her commonly; and I thought just at first she was almost
angry with me for going.â

âEh, itâs a poor look-out when thâ ould folks doesna like the young uns,â said
old Martin, bending his head down lower, and seeming to trace the pattern of
the quarries with his eye.

âAye, itâs ill livinâ in a hen-roost for them as doesnât like fleas,â said Mrs.
Poyser. âWeâve all had our turn at beinâ young, I reckon, beât good luck or
ill.â

âBut she must learn to âcommodate herself to young women,â said Mr. Poyser,
âfor it isnât to be counted on as Adam and Seth âull keep bachelors for the
next ten year to please their mother. That âud be unreasonable. It isnât right
for old nor young nayther to make a bargain all oâ their own side. Whatâs good
for oneâs good all round iâ the long run. Iâm no friend to young fellows
a-marrying afore they know the difference atween a crab anâ a apple; but they
may wait oâer long.â

âTo be sure,â said Mrs. Poyser; âif you go past your dinner-time, thereâll be
little relish oâ your meat. You turn it oâer anâ oâer wiâ your fork, anâ donât
eat it after all. You find faut wiâ your meat, anâ the fautâs all iâ your own
stomach.â

Hetty now came back from the pantry and said, âI can take Totty now, Aunt, if
you like.â

âCome, Rachel,â said Mr. Poyser, as his wife seemed to hesitate, seeing that
Totty was at last nestling quietly, âtheeâdst better let Hetty carry her
upstairs, while thee takâst thy things off. Theeât tired. Itâs time thee wast
in bed. Theeât bring on the pain in thy side again.â

âWell, she may hold her if the child âull go to her,â said Mrs. Poyser.

Hetty went close to the rocking-chair, and stood without her usual smile, and
without any attempt to entice Totty, simply waiting for her aunt to give the
child into her hands.

âWilt go to Cousin Hetty, my dilling, while mother gets ready to go to bed?
Then Totty shall go into Motherâs bed, and sleep there all night.â

Before her mother had done speaking, Totty had given her answer in an
unmistakable manner, by knitting her brow, setting her tiny teeth against her
underlip, and leaning forward to slap Hetty on the arm with her utmost force.
Then, without speaking, she nestled to her mother again.

âHey, hey,â said Mr. Poyser, while Hetty stood without moving, ânot go to
Cousin Hetty? Thatâs like a babby. Tottyâs a little woman, anâ not a babby.â

âItâs no use trying to persuade her,â said Mrs. Poyser. âShe allays takes
against Hetty when she isnât well. Happen sheâll go to Dinah.â

Dinah, having taken off her bonnet and shawl, had hitherto kept quietly seated
in the background, not liking to thrust herself between Hetty and what was
considered Hettyâs proper work. But now she came forward, and, putting out her
arms, said, âCome Totty, come and let Dinah carry her upstairs along with
Mother: poor, poor Mother! sheâs so tiredâshe wants to go to bed.â

Totty turned her face towards Dinah, and looked at her an instant, then lifted
herself up, put out her little arms, and let Dinah lift her from her motherâs
lap. Hetty turned away without any sign of ill humour, and, taking her hat from
the table, stood waiting with an air of indifference, to see if she should be
told to do anything else.

âYou may make the door fast now, Poyser; Alickâs been come in this long while,â
said Mrs. Poyser, rising with an appearance of relief from her low chair. âGet
me the matches down, Hetty, for I must have the rushlight burning iâ my room.
Come, Father.â

The heavy wooden bolts began to roll in the house doors, and old Martin
prepared to move, by gathering up his blue handkerchief, and reaching his
bright knobbed walnut-tree stick from the corner. Mrs. Poyser then led the way
out of the kitchen, followed by the grandfather, and Dinah with Totty in her
armsâall going to bed by twilight, like the birds. Mrs. Poyser, on her way,
peeped into the room where her two boys lay; just to see their ruddy round
cheeks on the pillow, and to hear for a moment their light regular breathing.

âCome, Hetty, get to bed,â said Mr. Poyser, in a soothing tone, as he himself
turned to go upstairs. âYou didna mean to be late, Iâll be bound, but your
auntâs been worrited to-day. Good-night, my wench, good-night.â

Chapter XV

The Two Bed-Chambers

Hetty and Dinah both slept in the second story, in rooms adjoining each other,
meagrely furnished rooms, with no blinds to shut out the light, which was now
beginning to gather new strength from the rising of the moonâmore than enough
strength to enable Hetty to move about and undress with perfect comfort. She
could see quite well the pegs in the old painted linen-press on which she hung
her hat and gown; she could see the head of every pin on her red cloth
pin-cushion; she could see a reflection of herself in the old-fashioned
looking-glass, quite as distinct as was needful, considering that she had only
to brush her hair and put on her night-cap. A queer old looking-glass! Hetty
got into an ill temper with it almost every time she dressed. It had been
considered a handsome glass in its day, and had probably been bought into the
Poyser family a quarter of a century before, at a sale of genteel household
furniture. Even now an auctioneer could say something for it: it had a great
deal of tarnished gilding about it; it had a firm mahogany base, well supplied
with drawers, which opened with a decided jerk and sent the contents leaping
out from the farthest corners, without giving you the trouble of reaching them;
above all, it had a brass candle-socket on each side, which would give it an
aristocratic air to the very last. But Hetty objected to it because it had
numerous dim blotches sprinkled over the mirror, which no rubbing would remove,
and because, instead of swinging backwards and forwards, it was fixed in an
upright position, so that she could only get one good view of her head and
neck, and that was to be had only by sitting down on a low chair before her
dressing-table. And the dressing-table was no dressing-table at all, but a
small old chest of drawers, the most awkward thing in the world to sit down
before, for the big brass handles quite hurt her knees, and she couldnât get
near the glass at all comfortably. But devout worshippers never allow
inconveniences to prevent them from performing their religious rites, and Hetty
this evening was more bent on her peculiar form of worship than usual.

Having taken off her gown and white kerchief, she drew a key from the large
pocket that hung outside her petticoat, and, unlocking one of the lower drawers
in the chest, reached from it two short bits of wax candleâsecretly bought at
Treddlestonâand stuck them in the two brass sockets. Then she drew forth a
bundle of matches and lighted the candles; and last of all, a small red-framed
shilling looking-glass, without blotches. It was into this small glass that she
chose to look first after seating herself. She looked into it, smiling and
turning her head on one side, for a minute, then laid it down and took out her
brush and comb from an upper drawer. She was going to let down her hair, and
make herself look like that picture of a lady in Miss Lydia Donnithorneâs
dressing-room. It was soon done, and the dark hyacinthine curves fell on her
neck. It was not heavy, massive, merely rippling hair, but soft and silken,
running at every opportunity into delicate rings. But she pushed it all
backward to look like the picture, and form a dark curtain, throwing into
relief her round white neck. Then she put down her brush and comb and looked at
herself, folding her arms before her, still like the picture. Even the old
mottled glass couldnât help sending back a lovely image, none the less lovely
because Hettyâs stays were not of white satinâsuch as I feel sure heroines must
generally wearâbut of a dark greenish cotton texture.

Oh yes! She was very pretty. Captain Donnithorne thought so. Prettier than
anybody about Hayslopeâprettier than any of the ladies she had ever seen
visiting at the Chaseâindeed it seemed fine ladies were rather old and uglyâand
prettier than Miss Bacon, the millerâs daughter, who was called the beauty of
Treddleston. And Hetty looked at herself to-night with quite a different
sensation from what she had ever felt before; there was an invisible spectator
whose eye rested on her like morning on the flowers. His soft voice was saying
over and over again those pretty things she had heard in the wood; his arm was
round her, and the delicate rose-scent of his hair was with her still. The
vainest woman is never thoroughly conscious of her own beauty till she is loved
by the man who sets her own passion vibrating in return.

But Hetty seemed to have made up her mind that something was wanting, for she
got up and reached an old black lace scarf out of the linen-press, and a pair
of large ear-rings out of the sacred drawer from which she had taken her
candles. It was an old old scarf, full of rents, but it would make a becoming
border round her shoulders, and set off the whiteness of her upper arm. And she
would take out the little ear-rings she had in her earsâoh, how her aunt had
scolded her for having her ears bored!âand put in those large ones. They were
but coloured glass and gilding, but if you didnât know what they were made of,
they looked just as well as what the ladies wore. And so she sat down again,
with the large ear-rings in her ears, and the black lace scarf adjusted round
her shoulders. She looked down at her arms: no arms could be prettier down to a
little way below the elbowâthey were white and plump, and dimpled to match her
cheeks; but towards the wrist, she thought with vexation that they were
coarsened by butter-making and other work that ladies never did.

Captain Donnithorne couldnât like her to go on doing work: he would like to see
her in nice clothes, and thin shoes, and white stockings, perhaps with silk
clocks to them; for he must love her very muchâno one else had ever put his arm
round her and kissed her in that way. He would want to marry her and make a
lady of her; she could hardly dare to shape the thoughtâyet how else could it
be? Marry her quite secretly, as Mr. James, the doctorâs assistant, married the
doctorâs niece, and nobody ever found it out for a long while after, and then
it was of no use to be angry. The doctor had told her aunt all about it in
Hettyâs hearing. She didnât know how it would be, but it was quite plain the
old Squire could never be told anything about it, for Hetty was ready to faint
with awe and fright if she came across him at the Chase. He might have been
earth-born, for what she knew. It had never entered her mind that he had been
young like other men; he had always been the old Squire at whom everybody was
frightened. Oh, it was impossible to think how it would be! But Captain
Donnithorne would know; he was a great gentleman, and could have his way in
everything, and could buy everything he liked. And nothing could be as it had
been again: perhaps some day she should be a grand lady, and ride in her coach,
and dress for dinner in a brocaded silk, with feathers in her hair, and her
dress sweeping the ground, like Miss Lydia and Lady Dacey, when she saw them
going into the dining-room one evening as she peeped through the little round
window in the lobby; only she should not be old and ugly like Miss Lydia, or
all the same thickness like Lady Dacey, but very pretty, with her hair done in
a great many different ways, and sometimes in a pink dress, and sometimes in a
white oneâshe didnât know which she liked best; and Mary Burge and everybody
would perhaps see her going out in her carriageâor rather, they would

hear
of it: it was impossible to imagine these things happening at
Hayslope in sight of her aunt. At the thought of all this splendour, Hetty got
up from her chair, and in doing so caught the little red-framed glass with the
edge of her scarf, so that it fell with a bang on the floor; but she was too
eagerly occupied with her vision to care about picking it up; and after a
momentary start, began to pace with a pigeon-like stateliness backwards and
forwards along her room, in her coloured stays and coloured skirt, and the old
black lace scarf round her shoulders, and the great glass ear-rings in her
ears.

How pretty the little puss looks in that odd dress! It would be the easiest
folly in the world to fall in love with her: there is such a sweet babylike
roundness about her face and figure; the delicate dark rings of hair lie so
charmingly about her ears and neck; her great dark eyes with their long
eye-lashes touch one so strangely, as if an imprisoned frisky sprite looked out
of them.

Ah, what a prize the man gets who wins a sweet bride like Hetty! How the men
envy him who come to the wedding breakfast, and see her hanging on his arm in
her white lace and orange blossoms. The dear, young, round, soft, flexible
thing! Her heart must be just as soft, her temper just as free from angles, her
character just as pliant. If anything ever goes wrong, it must be the husbandâs
fault there: he can make her what he likesâthat is plain. And the lover himself
thinks so too: the little darling is so fond of him, her little vanities are so
bewitching, he wouldnât consent to her being a bit wiser; those kittenlike
glances and movements are just what one wants to make oneâs hearth a paradise.
Every man under such circumstances is conscious of being a great physiognomist.
Nature, he knows, has a language of her own, which she uses with strict
veracity, and he considers himself an adept in the language. Nature has written
out his brideâs character for him in those exquisite lines of cheek and lip and
chin, in those eyelids delicate as petals, in those long lashes curled like the
stamen of a flower, in the dark liquid depths of those wonderful eyes. How she
will dote on her children! She is almost a child herself, and the little pink
round things will hang about her like florets round the central flower; and the
husband will look on, smiling benignly, able, whenever he chooses, to withdraw
into the sanctuary of his wisdom, towards which his sweet wife will look
reverently, and never lift the curtain. It is a marriage such as they made in
the golden age, when the men were all wise and majestic and the women all
lovely and loving.

It was very much in this way that our friend Adam Bede thought about Hetty;
only he put his thoughts into different words. If ever she behaved with cold
vanity towards him, he said to himself it is only because she doesnât love me
well enough; and he was sure that her love, whenever she gave it, would be the
most precious thing a man could possess on earth. Before you despise Adam as
deficient in penetration, pray ask yourself if you were ever predisposed to
believe evil of any pretty womanâif you ever
could
, without hard
head-breaking demonstration, believe evil of the
one
supremely pretty
woman who has bewitched you. No: people who love downy peaches are apt not to
think of the stone, and sometimes jar their teeth terribly against it.

Arthur Donnithorne, too, had the same sort of notion about Hetty, so far as he
had thought of her nature of all. He felt sure she was a dear, affectionate,
good little thing. The man who awakes the wondering tremulous passion of a
young girl always thinks her affectionate; and if he chances to look forward to
future years, probably imagines himself being virtuously tender to her, because
the poor thing is so clingingly fond of him. God made these dear women soâand
it is a convenient arrangement in case of sickness.

After all, I believe the wisest of us must be beguiled in this way sometimes,
and must think both better and worse of people than they deserve. Nature has
her language, and she is not unveracious; but we donât know all the intricacies
of her syntax just yet, and in a hasty reading we may happen to extract the
very opposite of her real meaning. Long dark eyelashes, nowâwhat can be more
exquisite? I find it impossible not to expect some depth of soul behind a deep
grey eye with a long dark eyelash, in spite of an experience which has shown me
that they may go along with deceit, peculation, and stupidity. But if, in the
reaction of disgust, I have betaken myself to a fishy eye, there has been a
surprising similarity of result. One begins to suspect at length that there is
no direct correlation between eyelashes and morals; or else, that the eyelashes
express the disposition of the fair oneâs grandmother, which is on the whole
less important to us.

No eyelashes could be more beautiful than Hettyâs; and now, while she walks
with her pigeon-like stateliness along the room and looks down on her shoulders
bordered by the old black lace, the dark fringe shows to perfection on her pink
cheek. They are but dim ill-defined pictures that her narrow bit of an
imagination can make of the future; but of every picture she is the central
figure in fine clothes; Captain Donnithorne is very close to her, putting his
arm round her, perhaps kissing her, and everybody else is admiring and envying
herâespecially Mary Burge, whose new print dress looks very contemptible by the
side of Hettyâs resplendent toilette. Does any sweet or sad memory mingle with
this dream of the futureâany loving thought of her second parentsâof the
children she had helped to tendâof any youthful companion, any pet animal, any
relic of her own childhood even? Not one. There are some plants that have
hardly any roots: you may tear them from their native nook of rock or wall, and
just lay them over your ornamental flower-pot, and they blossom none the worse.
Hetty could have cast all her past life behind her and never cared to be
reminded of it again. I think she had no feeling at all towards the old house,
and did not like the Jacobâs Ladder and the long row of hollyhocks in the
garden better than other flowersâperhaps not so well. It was wonderful how
little she seemed to care about waiting on her uncle, who had been a good
father to herâshe hardly ever remembered to reach him his pipe at the right
time without being told, unless a visitor happened to be there, who would have
a better opportunity of seeing her as she walked across the hearth. Hetty did
not understand how anybody could be very fond of middle-aged people. And as for
those tiresome children, Marty and Tommy and Totty, they had been the very
nuisance of her lifeâas bad as buzzing insects that will come teasing you on a
hot day when you want to be quiet. Marty, the eldest, was a baby when she first
came to the farm, for the children born before him had died, and so Hetty had
had them all three, one after the other, toddling by her side in the meadow, or
playing about her on wet days in the half-empty rooms of the large old house.
The boys were out of hand now, but Totty was still a day-long plague, worse
than either of the others had been, because there was more fuss made about her.
And there was no end to the making and mending of clothes. Hetty would have
been glad to hear that she should never see a child again; they were worse than
the nasty little lambs that the shepherd was always bringing in to be taken
special care of in lambing time; for the lambs
were
got rid of sooner or
later. As for the young chickens and turkeys, Hetty would have hated the very
word âhatching,â if her aunt had not bribed her to attend to the young poultry
by promising her the proceeds of one out of every brood. The round downy chicks
peeping out from under their motherâs wing never touched Hetty with any
pleasure; that was not the sort of prettiness she cared about, but she did care
about the prettiness of the new things she would buy for herself at Treddleston
Fair with the money they fetched. And yet she looked so dimpled, so charming,
as she stooped down to put the soaked bread under the hen-coop, that you must
have been a very acute personage indeed to suspect her of that hardness. Molly,
the housemaid, with a turn-up nose and a protuberant jaw, was really a
tender-hearted girl, and, as Mrs. Poyser said, a jewel to look after the
poultry; but her stolid face showed nothing of this maternal delight, any more
than a brown earthenware pitcher will show the light of the lamp within it.

It is generally a feminine eye that first detects the moral deficiencies hidden
under the âdear deceitâ of beauty, so it is not surprising that Mrs. Poyser,
with her keenness and abundant opportunity for observation, should have formed
a tolerably fair estimate of what might be expected from Hetty in the way of
feeling, and in moments of indignation she had sometimes spoken with great
openness on the subject to her husband.

âSheâs no better than a peacock, as âud strut about on the wall and spread its
tail when the sun shone if all the folks iâ the parish was dying: thereâs
nothing seems to give her a turn iâ thâ inside, not even when we thought Totty
had tumbled into the pit. To think oâ that dear cherub! And we found her wiâ
her little shoes stuck iâ the mud anâ crying fit to break her heart by the far
horse-pit. But Hetty never minded it, I could see, though sheâs been at the
nussinâ oâ the child ever since it was a babby. Itâs my belief her heartâs as
hard as a pebble.â

âNay, nay,â said Mr. Poyser, âthee mustnât judge Hetty too hard. Them young
gells are like the unripe grain; theyâll make good meal by and by, but theyâre
squashy as yet. Theeât see Hetty âll be all right when sheâs got a good husband
and children of her own.â

â
I
donât want to be hard upoâ the gell. Sheâs got cliver fingers of her
own, and can be useful enough when she likes and I should miss her wiâ the
butter, for sheâs got a cool hand. Anâ let be what may, Iâd strive to do my
part by a niece oâ yoursâanâ that Iâve done, for Iâve taught her everything as
belongs to a house, anâ Iâve told her her duty often enough, though, God knows,
Iâve no breath to spare, anâ that catchinâ pain comes on dreadful by times. Wiâ
them three gells in the house Iâd need have twice the strength to keep âem up
to their work. Itâs like having roast meat at three fires; as soon as youâve
basted one, anotherâs burninâ.â

Hetty stood sufficiently in awe of her aunt to be anxious to conceal from her
so much of her vanity as could be hidden without too great a sacrifice. She
could not resist spending her money in bits of finery which Mrs. Poyser
disapproved; but she would have been ready to die with shame, vexation, and
fright if her aunt had this moment opened the door, and seen her with her bits
of candle lighted, and strutting about decked in her scarf and ear-rings. To
prevent such a surprise, she always bolted her door, and she had not forgotten
to do so to-night. It was well: for there now came a light tap, and Hetty, with
a leaping heart, rushed to blow out the candles and throw them into the drawer.
She dared not stay to take out her ear-rings, but she threw off her scarf, and
let it fall on the floor, before the light tap came again. We shall know how it
was that the light tap came, if we leave Hetty for a short time and return to
Dinah, at the moment when she had delivered Totty to her motherâs arms, and was
come upstairs to her bedroom, adjoining Hettyâs.

Dinah delighted in her bedroom window. Being on the second story of that tall
house, it gave her a wide view over the fields. The thickness of the wall
formed a broad step about a yard below the window, where she could place her
chair. And now the first thing she did on entering her room was to seat herself
in this chair and look out on the peaceful fields beyond which the large moon
was rising, just above the hedgerow elms. She liked the pasture best where the
milch cows were lying, and next to that the meadow where the grass was
half-mown, and lay in silvered sweeping lines. Her heart was very full, for
there was to be only one more night on which she would look out on those fields
for a long time to come; but she thought little of leaving the mere scene, for,
to her, bleak Snowfield had just as many charms. She thought of all the dear
people whom she had learned to care for among these peaceful fields, and who
would now have a place in her loving remembrance for ever. She thought of the
struggles and the weariness that might lie before them in the rest of their
lifeâs journey, when she would be away from them, and know nothing of what was
befalling them; and the pressure of this thought soon became too strong for her
to enjoy the unresponding stillness of the moonlit fields. She closed her eyes,
that she might feel more intensely the presence of a Love and Sympathy deeper
and more tender than was breathed from the earth and sky. That was often
Dinahâs mode of praying in solitude. Simply to close her eyes and to feel
herself enclosed by the Divine Presence; then gradually her fears, her yearning
anxieties for others, melted away like ice-crystals in a warm ocean. She had
sat in this way perfectly still, with her hands crossed on her lap and the pale
light resting on her calm face, for at least ten minutes when she was startled
by a loud sound, apparently of something falling in Hettyâs room. But like all
sounds that fall on our ears in a state of abstraction, it had no distinct
character, but was simply loud and startling, so that she felt uncertain
whether she had interpreted it rightly. She rose and listened, but all was
quiet afterwards, and she reflected that Hetty might merely have knocked
something down in getting into bed. She began slowly to undress; but now, owing
to the suggestions of this sound, her thoughts became concentrated on
Hettyâthat sweet young thing, with life and all its trials before herâthe
solemn daily duties of the wife and motherâand her mind so unprepared for them
all, bent merely on little foolish, selfish pleasures, like a child hugging its
toys in the beginning of a long toilsome journey in which it will have to bear
hunger and cold and unsheltered darkness. Dinah felt a double care for Hetty,
because she shared Sethâs anxious interest in his brotherâs lot, and she had
not come to the conclusion that Hetty did not love Adam well enough to marry
him. She saw too clearly the absence of any warm, self-devoting love in Hettyâs
nature to regard the coldness of her behaviour towards Adam as any indication
that he was not the man she would like to have for a husband. And this blank in
Hettyâs nature, instead of exciting Dinahâs dislike, only touched her with a
deeper pity: the lovely face and form affected her as beauty always affects a
pure and tender mind, free from selfish jealousies. It was an excellent divine
gift, that gave a deeper pathos to the need, the sin, the sorrow with which it
was mingled, as the canker in a lily-white bud is more grievous to behold than
in a common pot-herb.

By the time Dinah had undressed and put on her night-gown, this feeling about
Hetty had gathered a painful intensity; her imagination had created a thorny
thicket of sin and sorrow, in which she saw the poor thing struggling torn and
bleeding, looking with tears for rescue and finding none. It was in this way
that Dinahâs imagination and sympathy acted and reacted habitually, each
heightening the other. She felt a deep longing to go now and pour into Hettyâs
ear all the words of tender warning and appeal that rushed into her mind. But
perhaps Hetty was already asleep. Dinah put her ear to the partition and heard
still some slight noises, which convinced her that Hetty was not yet in bed.
Still she hesitated; she was not quite certain of a divine direction; the voice
that told her to go to Hetty seemed no stronger than the other voice which said
that Hetty was weary, and that going to her now in an unseasonable moment would
only tend to close her heart more obstinately. Dinah was not satisfied without
a more unmistakable guidance than those inward voices. There was light enough
for her, if she opened her Bible, to discern the text sufficiently to know what
it would say to her. She knew the physiognomy of every page, and could tell on
what book she opened, sometimes on what chapter, without seeing title or
number. It was a small thick Bible, worn quite round at the edges. Dinah laid
it sideways on the window ledge, where the light was strongest, and then opened
it with her forefinger. The first words she looked at were those at the top of
the left-hand page: âAnd they all wept sore, and fell on Paulâs neck and kissed
him.â That was enough for Dinah; she had opened on that memorable parting at
Ephesus, when Paul had felt bound to open his heart in a last exhortation and
warning. She hesitated no longer, but, opening her own door gently, went and
tapped on Hettyâs. We know she had to tap twice, because Hetty had to put out
her candles and throw off her black lace scarf; but after the second tap the
door was opened immediately. Dinah said, âWill you let me come in, Hetty?â and
Hetty, without speaking, for she was confused and vexed, opened the door wider
and let her in.

What a strange contrast the two figures made, visible enough in that mingled
twilight and moonlight! Hetty, her cheeks flushed and her eyes glistening from
her imaginary drama, her beautiful neck and arms bare, her hair hanging in a
curly tangle down her back, and the baubles in her ears. Dinah, covered with
her long white dress, her pale face full of subdued emotion, almost like a
lovely corpse into which the soul has returned charged with sublimer secrets
and a sublimer love. They were nearly of the same height; Dinah evidently a
little the taller as she put her arm round Hettyâs waist and kissed her
forehead.

âI knew you were not in bed, my dear,â she said, in her sweet clear voice,
which was irritating to Hetty, mingling with her own peevish vexation like
music with jangling chains, âfor I heard you moving; and I longed to speak to
you again to-night, for it is the last but one that I shall be here, and we
donât know what may happen to-morrow to keep us apart. Shall I sit down with
you while you do up your hair?â

âOh yes,â said Hetty, hastily turning round and reaching the second chair in
the room, glad that Dinah looked as if she did not notice her ear-rings.

Dinah sat down, and Hetty began to brush together her hair before twisting it
up, doing it with that air of excessive indifference which belongs to confused
self-consciousness. But the expression of Dinahâs eyes gradually relieved her;
they seemed unobservant of all details.

âDear Hetty,â she said, âIt has been borne in upon my mind to-night that you
may some day be in troubleâtrouble is appointed for us all here below, and
there comes a time when we need more comfort and help than the things of this
life can give. I want to tell you that if ever you are in trouble, and need a
friend that will always feel for you and love you, you have got that friend in
Dinah Morris at Snowfield, and if you come to her, or send for her, sheâll
never forget this night and the words she is speaking to you now. Will you
remember it, Hetty?â

âYes,â said Hetty, rather frightened. âBut why should you think I shall be in
trouble? Do you know of anything?â

Hetty had seated herself as she tied on her cap, and now Dinah leaned forwards
and took her hands as she answered, âBecause, dear, trouble comes to us all in
this life: we set our hearts on things which it isnât Godâs will for us to
have, and then we go sorrowing; the people we love are taken from us, and we
can joy in nothing because they are not with us; sickness comes, and we faint
under the burden of our feeble bodies; we go astray and do wrong, and bring
ourselves into trouble with our fellow-men. There is no man or woman born into
this world to whom some of these trials do not fall, and so I feel that some of
them must happen to you; and I desire for you, that while you are young you
should seek for strength from your Heavenly Father, that you may have a support
which will not fail you in the evil day.â

Dinah paused and released Hettyâs hands that she might not hinder her. Hetty
sat quite still; she felt no response within herself to Dinahâs anxious
affection; but Dinahâs words uttered with solemn pathetic distinctness,
affected her with a chill fear. Her flush had died away almost to paleness; she
had the timidity of a luxurious pleasure-seeking nature, which shrinks from the
hint of pain. Dinah saw the effect, and her tender anxious pleading became the
more earnest, till Hetty, full of a vague fear that something evil was some
time to befall her, began to cry.

It is our habit to say that while the lower nature can never understand the
higher, the higher nature commands a complete view of the lower. But I think
the higher nature has to learn this comprehension, as we learn the art of
vision, by a good deal of hard experience, often with bruises and gashes
incurred in taking things up by the wrong end, and fancying our space wider
than it is. Dinah had never seen Hetty affected in this way before, and, with
her usual benignant hopefulness, she trusted it was the stirring of a divine
impulse. She kissed the sobbing thing, and began to cry with her for grateful
joy. But Hetty was simply in that excitable state of mind in which there is no
calculating what turn the feelings may take from one moment to another, and for
the first time she became irritated under Dinahâs caress. She pushed her away
impatiently, and said, with a childish sobbing voice, âDonât talk to me so,
Dinah. Why do you come to frighten me? Iâve never done anything to you. Why
canât you let me be?â

Poor Dinah felt a pang. She was too wise to persist, and only said mildly,
âYes, my dear, youâre tired; I wonât hinder you any longer. Make haste and get
into bed. Good-night.â

She went out of the room almost as quietly and quickly as if she had been a
ghost; but once by the side of her own bed, she threw herself on her knees and
poured out in deep silence all the passionate pity that filled her heart.

As for Hetty, she was soon in the wood againâher waking dreams being merged in
a sleeping life scarcely more fragmentary and confused.

Chapter XVI

Links

Arthur Donnithorne, you remember, is under an engagement with himself to go and
see Mr. Irwine this Friday morning, and he is awake and dressing so early that
he determines to go before breakfast, instead of after. The rector, he knows,
breakfasts alone at half-past nine, the ladies of the family having a different
breakfast-hour; Arthur will have an early ride over the hill and breakfast with
him. One can say everything best over a meal.

The progress of civilization has made a breakfast or a dinner an easy and
cheerful substitute for more troublesome and disagreeable ceremonies. We take a
less gloomy view of our errors now our father confessor listens to us over his
egg and coffee. We are more distinctly conscious that rude penances are out of
the question for gentlemen in an enlightened age, and that mortal sin is not
incompatible with an appetite for muffins. An assault on our pockets, which in
more barbarous times would have been made in the brusque form of a pistol-shot,
is quite a well-bred and smiling procedure now it has become a request for a
loan thrown in as an easy parenthesis between the second and third glasses of
claret.

Still, there was this advantage in the old rigid forms, that they committed you
to the fulfilment of a resolution by some outward deed: when you have put your
mouth to one end of a hole in a stone wall and are aware that there is an
expectant ear at the other end, you are more likely to say what you came out
with the intention of saying than if you were seated with your legs in an easy
attitude under the mahogany with a companion who will have no reason to be
surprised if you have nothing particular to say.

However, Arthur Donnithorne, as he winds among the pleasant lanes on horseback
in the morning sunshine, has a sincere determination to open his heart to the
rector, and the swirling sound of the scythe as he passes by the meadow is all
the pleasanter to him because of this honest purpose. He is glad to see the
promise of settled weather now, for getting in the hay, about which the farmers
have been fearful; and there is something so healthful in the sharing of a joy
that is general and not merely personal, that this thought about the
hay-harvest reacts on his state of mind and makes his resolution seem an easier
matter. A man about town might perhaps consider that these influences were not
to be felt out of a childâs story-book; but when you are among the fields and
hedgerows, it is impossible to maintain a consistent superiority to simple
natural pleasures.

Arthur had passed the village of Hayslope and was approaching the Broxton side
of the hill, when, at a turning in the road, he saw a figure about a hundred
yards before him which it was impossible to mistake for any one else than Adam
Bede, even if there had been no grey, tailless shepherd-dog at his heels. He
was striding along at his usual rapid pace, and Arthur pushed on his horse to
overtake him, for he retained too much of his boyish feeling for Adam to miss
an opportunity of chatting with him. I will not say that his love for that good
fellow did not owe some of its force to the love of patronage: our friend
Arthur liked to do everything that was handsome, and to have his handsome deeds
recognized.

Adam looked round as he heard the quickening clatter of the horseâs heels, and
waited for the horseman, lifting his paper cap from his head with a bright
smile of recognition. Next to his own brother Seth, Adam would have done more
for Arthur Donnithorne than for any other young man in the world. There was
hardly anything he would not rather have lost than the two-feet ruler which he
always carried in his pocket; it was Arthurâs present, bought with his
pocket-money when he was a fair-haired lad of eleven, and when he had profited
so well by Adamâs lessons in carpentering and turning as to embarrass every
female in the house with gifts of superfluous thread-reels and round boxes.
Adam had quite a pride in the little squire in those early days, and the
feeling had only become slightly modified as the fair-haired lad had grown into
the whiskered young man. Adam, I confess, was very susceptible to the influence
of rank, and quite ready to give an extra amount of respect to every one who
had more advantages than himself, not being a philosopher or a proletaire with
democratic ideas, but simply a stout-limbed clever carpenter with a large fund
of reverence in his nature, which inclined him to admit all established claims
unless he saw very clear grounds for questioning them. He had no theories about
setting the world to rights, but he saw there was a great deal of damage done
by building with ill-seasoned timberâby ignorant men in fine clothes making
plans for outhouses and workshops and the like without knowing the bearings of
thingsâby slovenly joinersâ work, and by hasty contracts that could never be
fulfilled without ruining somebody; and he resolved, for his part, to set his
face against such doings. On these points he would have maintained his opinion
against the largest landed proprietor in Loamshire or Stonyshire either; but he
felt that beyond these it would be better for him to defer to people who were
more knowing than himself. He saw as plainly as possible how ill the woods on
the estate were managed, and the shameful state of the farm-buildings; and if
old Squire Donnithorne had asked him the effect of this mismanagement, he would
have spoken his opinion without flinching, but the impulse to a respectful
demeanour towards a âgentlemanâ would have been strong within him all the
while. The word âgentlemanâ had a spell for Adam, and, as he often said, he
âcouldnât abide a fellow who thought he made himself fine by being coxy toâs
betters.â I must remind you again that Adam had the blood of the peasant in his
veins, and that since he was in his prime half a century ago, you must expect
some of his characteristics to be obsolete.

Towards the young squire this instinctive reverence of Adamâs was assisted by
boyish memories and personal regard so you may imagine that he thought far more
of Arthurâs good qualities, and attached far more value to very slight actions
of his, than if they had been the qualities and actions of a common workman
like himself. He felt sure it would be a fine day for everybody about Hayslope
when the young squire came into the estateâsuch a generous open-hearted
disposition as he had, and an âuncommonâ notion about improvements and repairs,
considering he was only just coming of age. Thus there was both respect and
affection in the smile with which he raised his paper cap as Arthur Donnithorne
rode up.

âWell, Adam, how are you?â said Arthur, holding out his hand. He never shook
hands with any of the farmers, and Adam felt the honour keenly. âI could swear
to your back a long way off. Itâs just the same back, only broader, as when you
used to carry me on it. Do you remember?â

âAye, sir, I remember. It âud be a poor look-out if folks didnât remember what
they did and said when they were lads. We should think no more about old
friends than we do about new uns, then.â

âYouâre going to Broxton, I suppose?â said Arthur, putting his horse on at a
slow pace while Adam walked by his side. âAre you going to the rectory?â

âNo, sir, Iâm going to see about Bradwellâs barn. Theyâre afraid of the roof
pushing the walls out, and Iâm going to see what can be done with it before we
send the stuff and the workmen.â

âWhy, Burge trusts almost everything to you now, Adam, doesnât he? I should
think he will make you his partner soon. He will, if heâs wise.â

âNay, sir, I donât see as heâd be much the better off for that. A foreman, if
heâs got a conscience and delights in his work, will do his business as well as
if he was a partner. I wouldnât give a penny for a man as âud drive a nail in
slack because he didnât get extra pay for it.â

âI know that, Adam; I know you work for him as well as if you were working for
yourself. But you would have more power than you have now, and could turn the
business to better account perhaps. The old man must give up his business
sometime, and he has no son; I suppose heâll want a son-in-law who can take to
it. But he has rather grasping fingers of his own, I fancy. I daresay he wants
a man who can put some money into the business. If I were not as poor as a rat,
I would gladly invest some money in that way, for the sake of having you
settled on the estate. Iâm sure I should profit by it in the end. And perhaps I
shall be better off in a year or two. I shall have a larger allowance now Iâm
of age; and when Iâve paid off a debt or two, I shall be able to look about
me.â

âYouâre very good to say so, sir, and Iâm not unthankful. ButââAdam continued,
in a decided toneââI shouldnât like to make any offers to Mr. Burge, or tâ have
any made for me. I see no clear road to a partnership. If he should ever want
to dispose of the business, that âud be a different matter. I should be glad of
some money at a fair interest then, for I feel sure I could pay it off in
time.â

âVery well, Adam,â said Arthur, remembering what Mr. Irwine had said about a
probable hitch in the love-making between Adam and Mary Burge, âweâll say no
more about it at present. When is your father to be buried?â

âOn Sunday, sir; Mr. Irwineâs coming earlier on purpose. I shall be glad when
itâs over, for I think my mother âull perhaps get easier then. It cuts one
sadly to see the grief of old people; theyâve no way oâ working it off, and the
new spring brings no new shoots out on the withered tree.â

âAh, youâve had a good deal of trouble and vexation in your life, Adam. I donât
think youâve ever been hare-brained and light-hearted, like other youngsters.
Youâve always had some care on your mind.â

âWhy, yes, sir; but thatâs nothing to make a fuss about. If weâre men and have
menâs feelings, I reckon we must have menâs troubles. We canât be like the
birds, as fly from their nest as soon as theyâve got their wings, and never
know their kin when they see âem, and get a fresh lot every year. Iâve had
enough to be thankful for: Iâve allays had health and strength and brains to
give me a delight in my work; and I count it a great thing as Iâve had Bartle
Masseyâs night-school to go to. Heâs helped me to knowledge I could never haâ
got by myself.â

âWhat a rare fellow you are, Adam!â said Arthur, after a pause, in which he had
looked musingly at the big fellow walking by his side. âI could hit out better
than most men at Oxford, and yet I believe you would knock me into next week if
I were to have a battle with you.â

âGod forbid I should ever do that, sir,â said Adam, looking round at Arthur and
smiling. âI used to fight for fun, but Iâve never done that since I was the
cause oâ poor Gil Tranter being laid up for a fortnight. Iâll never fight any
man again, only when he behaves like a scoundrel. If you get hold of a chap
thatâs got no shame nor conscience to stop him, you must try what you can do by
bunging his eyes up.â

Arthur did not laugh, for he was preoccupied with some thought that made him
say presently, âI should think now, Adam, you never have any struggles within
yourself. I fancy you would master a wish that you had made up your mind it was
not quite right to indulge, as easily as you would knock down a drunken fellow
who was quarrelsome with you. I mean, you are never shilly-shally, first making
up your mind that you wonât do a thing, and then doing it after all?â

âWell,â said Adam, slowly, after a momentâs hesitation, âno. I donât remember
ever being see-saw in that way, when Iâd made my mind up, as you say, that a
thing was wrong. It takes the taste out oâ my mouth for things, when I know I
should have a heavy conscience after âem. Iâve seen pretty clear, ever since I
could cast up a sum, as you can never do whatâs wrong without breeding sin and
trouble more than you can ever see. Itâs like a bit oâ bad workmanshipâyou
never see thâ end oâ the mischief itâll do. And itâs a poor look-out to come
into the world to make your fellow-creatures worse off instead oâ better. But
thereâs a difference between the things folks call wrong. Iâm not for making a
sin of every little foolâs trick, or bit oâ nonsense anybody may be let into,
like some oâ them dissenters. And a man may have two minds whether it isnât
worthwhile to get a bruise or two for the sake of a bit oâ fun. But it isnât my
way to be see-saw about anything: I think my fault lies thâ other way. When
Iâve said a thing, if itâs only to myself, itâs hard for me to go back.â

âYes, thatâs just what I expected of you,â said Arthur. âYouâve got an iron
will, as well as an iron arm. But however strong a manâs resolution may be, it
costs him something to carry it out, now and then. We may determine not to
gather any cherries and keep our hands sturdily in our pockets, but we canât
prevent our mouths from watering.â

âThatâs true, sir, but thereâs nothing like settling with ourselves as thereâs
a deal we must do without iâ this life. Itâs no use looking on life as if it
was Treddlesâon Fair, where folks only go to see shows and get fairings. If we
do, we shall find it different. But whereâs the use oâ me talking to you, sir?
You know better than I do.â

âIâm not so sure of that, Adam. Youâve had four or five years of experience
more than Iâve had, and I think your life has been a better school to you than
college has been to me.â

âWhy, sir, you seem to think oâ college something like what Bartle Massey does.
He says college mostly makes people like bladdersâjust good for nothing but tâ
hold the stuff as is poured into âem. But heâs got a tongue like a sharp blade,
Bartle hasâit never touches anything but it cuts. Hereâs the turning, sir. I
must bid you good-morning, as youâre going to the rectory.â

âGood-bye, Adam, good-bye.â

Arthur gave his horse to the groom at the rectory gate, and walked along the
gravel towards the door which opened on the garden. He knew that the rector
always breakfasted in his study, and the study lay on the left hand of this
door, opposite the dining-room. It was a small low room, belonging to the old
part of the houseâdark with the sombre covers of the books that lined the
walls; yet it looked very cheery this morning as Arthur reached the open
window. For the morning sun fell aslant on the great glass globe with gold fish
in it, which stood on a scagliola pillar in front of the ready-spread bachelor
breakfast-table, and by the side of this breakfast-table was a group which
would have made any room enticing. In the crimson damask easy-chair sat Mr.
Irwine, with that radiant freshness which he always had when he came from his
morning toilet; his finely formed plump white hand was playing along Junoâs
brown curly back; and close to Junoâs tail, which was wagging with calm
matronly pleasure, the two brown pups were rolling over each other in an
ecstatic duet of worrying noises. On a cushion a little removed sat Pug, with
the air of a maiden lady, who looked on these familiarities as animal
weaknesses, which she made as little show as possible of observing. On the
table, at Mr. Irwineâs elbow, lay the first volume of the Foulis Ãschylus,
which Arthur knew well by sight; and the silver coffee-pot, which Carroll was
bringing in, sent forth a fragrant steam which completed the delights of a
bachelor breakfast.

âHallo, Arthur, thatâs a good fellow! Youâre just in time,â said Mr. Irwine, as
Arthur paused and stepped in over the low window-sill. âCarroll, we shall want
more coffee and eggs, and havenât you got some cold fowl for us to eat with
that ham? Why, this is like old days, Arthur; you havenât been to breakfast
with me these five years.â

âIt was a tempting morning for a ride before breakfast,â said Arthur; âand I
used to like breakfasting with you so when I was reading with you. My
grandfather is always a few degrees colder at breakfast than at any other hour
in the day. I think his morning bath doesnât agree with him.â

Arthur was anxious not to imply that he came with any special purpose. He had
no sooner found himself in Mr. Irwineâs presence than the confidence which he
had thought quite easy before, suddenly appeared the most difficult thing in
the world to him, and at the very moment of shaking hands he saw his purpose in
quite a new light. How could he make Irwine understand his position unless he
told him those little scenes in the wood; and how could he tell them without
looking like a fool? And then his weakness in coming back from Gawaineâs, and
doing the very opposite of what he intended! Irwine would think him a
shilly-shally fellow ever after. However, it must come out in an unpremeditated
way; the conversation might lead up to it.

âI like breakfast-time better than any other moment in the day,â said Mr.
Irwine. âNo dust has settled on oneâs mind then, and it presents a clear mirror
to the rays of things. I always have a favourite book by me at breakfast, and I
enjoy the bits I pick up then so much, that regularly every morning it seems to
me as if I should certainly become studious again. But presently Dent brings up
a poor fellow who has killed a hare, and when Iâve got through my âjusticing,â
as Carroll calls it, Iâm inclined for a ride round the glebe, and on my way
back I meet with the master of the workhouse, who has got a long story of a
mutinous pauper to tell me; and so the day goes on, and Iâm always the same
lazy fellow before evening sets in. Besides, one wants the stimulus of
sympathy, and I have never had that since poor DâOyley left Treddleston. If you
had stuck to your books well, you rascal, I should have had a pleasanter
prospect before me. But scholarship doesnât run in your family blood.â

âNo indeed. Itâs well if I can remember a little inapplicable Latin to adorn my
maiden speech in Parliament six or seven years hence. âCras ingens iterabimus
aequor,â and a few shreds of that sort, will perhaps stick to me, and I shall
arrange my opinions so as to introduce them. But I donât think a knowledge of
the classics is a pressing want to a country gentleman; as far as I can see,
heâd much better have a knowledge of manures. Iâve been reading your friend
Arthur Youngâs books lately, and thereâs nothing I should like better than to
carry out some of his ideas in putting the farmers on a better management of
their land; and, as he says, making what was a wild country, all of the same
dark hue, bright and variegated with corn and cattle. My grandfather will never
let me have any power while he lives, but thereâs nothing I should like better
than to undertake the Stonyshire side of the estateâitâs in a dismal
conditionâand set improvements on foot, and gallop about from one place to
another and overlook them. I should like to know all the labourers, and see
them touching their hats to me with a look of goodwill.â

âBravo, Arthur! A man who has no feeling for the classics couldnât make a
better apology for coming into the world than by increasing the quantity of
food to maintain scholarsâand rectors who appreciate scholars. And whenever you
enter on your career of model landlord may I be there to see. Youâll want a
portly rector to complete the picture, and take his tithe of all the respect
and honour you get by your hard work. Only donât set your heart too strongly on
the goodwill you are to get in consequence. Iâm not sure that men are the
fondest of those who try to be useful to them. You know Gawaine has got the
curses of the whole neighbourhood upon him about that enclosure. You must make
it quite clear to your mind which you are most bent upon, old boyâpopularity or
usefulnessâelse you may happen to miss both.â

âOh! Gawaine is harsh in his manners; he doesnât make himself personally
agreeable to his tenants. I donât believe thereâs anything you canât prevail on
people to do with kindness. For my part, I couldnât live in a neighbourhood
where I was not respected and beloved. And itâs very pleasant to go among the
tenants hereâthey seem all so well inclined to me I suppose it seems only the
other day to them since I was a little lad, riding on a pony about as big as a
sheep. And if fair allowances were made to them, and their buildings attended
to, one could persuade them to farm on a better plan, stupid as they are.â

âThen mind you fall in love in the right place, and donât get a wife who will
drain your purse and make you niggardly in spite of yourself. My mother and I
have a little discussion about you sometimes: she says, âIâll never risk a
single prophecy on Arthur until I see the woman he falls in love with.â She
thinks your lady-love will rule you as the moon rules the tides. But I feel
bound to stand up for you, as my pupil you know, and I maintain that youâre not
of that watery quality. So mind you donât disgrace my judgment.â

Arthur winced under this speech, for keen old Mrs. Irwineâs opinion about him
had the disagreeable effect of a sinister omen. This, to be sure, was only
another reason for persevering in his intention, and getting an additional
security against himself. Nevertheless, at this point in the conversation, he
was conscious of increased disinclination to tell his story about Hetty. He was
of an impressible nature, and lived a great deal in other peopleâs opinions and
feelings concerning himself; and the mere fact that he was in the presence of
an intimate friend, who had not the slightest notion that he had had any such
serious internal struggle as he came to confide, rather shook his own belief in
the seriousness of the struggle. It was not, after all, a thing to make a fuss
about; and what could Irwine do for him that he could not do for himself? He
would go to Eagledale in spite of Megâs lamenessâgo on Rattler, and let Pym
follow as well as he could on the old hack. That was his thought as he sugared
his coffee; but the next minute, as he was lifting the cup to his lips, he
remembered how thoroughly he had made up his mind last night to tell Irwine.
No! He would not be vacillating againâhe
would
do what he had meant to
do, this time. So it would be well not to let the personal tone of the
conversation altogether drop. If they went to quite indifferent topics, his
difficulty would be heightened. It had required no noticeable pause for this
rush and rebound of feeling, before he answered, âBut I think it is hardly an
argument against a manâs general strength of character that he should be apt to
be mastered by love. A fine constitution doesnât insure one against smallpox or
any other of those inevitable diseases. A man may be very firm in other matters
and yet be under a sort of witchery from a woman.â

âYes; but thereâs this difference between love and smallpox, or bewitchment
eitherâthat if you detect the disease at an early stage and try change of air,
there is every chance of complete escape without any further development of
symptoms. And there are certain alternative doses which a man may administer to
himself by keeping unpleasant consequences before his mind: this gives you a
sort of smoked glass through which you may look at the resplendent fair one and
discern her true outline; though Iâm afraid, by the by, the smoked glass is apt
to be missing just at the moment it is most wanted. I daresay, now, even a man
fortified with a knowledge of the classics might be lured into an imprudent
marriage, in spite of the warning given him by the chorus in the Prometheus.â

The smile that flitted across Arthurâs face was a faint one, and instead of
following Mr. Irwineâs playful lead, he said, quite seriouslyââYes, thatâs the
worst of it. Itâs a desperately vexatious thing, that after all oneâs
reflections and quiet determinations, we should be ruled by moods that one
canât calculate on beforehand. I donât think a man ought to be blamed so much
if he is betrayed into doing things in that way, in spite of his resolutions.â

âAh, but the moods lie in his nature, my boy, just as much as his reflections
did, and more. A man can never do anything at variance with his own nature. He
carries within him the germ of his most exceptional action; and if we wise
people make eminent fools of ourselves on any particular occasion, we must
endure the legitimate conclusion that we carry a few grains of folly to our
ounce of wisdom.â

âWell, but one may be betrayed into doing things by a combination of
circumstances, which one might never have done otherwise.â

âWhy, yes, a man canât very well steal a bank-note unless the bank-note lies
within convenient reach; but he wonât make us think him an honest man because
he begins to howl at the bank-note for falling in his way.â

âBut surely you donât think a man who struggles against a temptation into which
he falls at last as bad as the man who never struggles at all?â

âNo, certainly; I pity him in proportion to his struggles, for they foreshadow
the inward suffering which is the worst form of Nemesis. Consequences are
unpitying. Our deeds carry their terrible consequences, quite apart from any
fluctuations that went beforeâconsequences that are hardly ever confined to
ourselves. And it is best to fix our minds on that certainty, instead of
considering what may be the elements of excuse for us. But I never knew you so
inclined for moral discussion, Arthur? Is it some danger of your own that you
are considering in this philosophical, general way?â

In asking this question, Mr. Irwine pushed his plate away, threw himself back
in his chair, and looked straight at Arthur. He really suspected that Arthur
wanted to tell him something, and thought of smoothing the way for him by this
direct question. But he was mistaken. Brought suddenly and involuntarily to the
brink of confession, Arthur shrank back and felt less disposed towards it than
ever. The conversation had taken a more serious tone than he had intendedâit
would quite mislead Irwineâhe would imagine there was a deep passion for Hetty,
while there was no such thing. He was conscious of colouring, and was annoyed
at his boyishness.

âOh no, no danger,â he said as indifferently as he could. âI donât know that I
am more liable to irresolution than other people; only there are little
incidents now and then that set one speculating on what might happen in the
future.â

Was there a motive at work under this strange reluctance of Arthurâs which had
a sort of backstairs influence, not admitted to himself? Our mental business is
carried on much in the same way as the business of the State: a great deal of
hard work is done by agents who are not acknowledged. In a piece of machinery,
too, I believe there is often a small unnoticeable wheel which has a great deal
to do with the motion of the large obvious ones. Possibly there was some such
unrecognized agent secretly busy in Arthurâs mind at this momentâpossibly it
was the fear lest he might hereafter find the fact of having made a confession
to the rector a serious annoyance, in case he should
not
be able quite
to carry out his good resolutions? I dare not assert that it was not so. The
human soul is a very complex thing.

The idea of Hetty had just crossed Mr. Irwineâs mind as he looked inquiringly
at Arthur, but his disclaiming indifferent answer confirmed the thought which
had quickly followedâthat there could be nothing serious in that direction.
There was no probability that Arthur ever saw her except at church, and at her
own home under the eye of Mrs. Poyser; and the hint he had given Arthur about
her the other day had no more serious meaning than to prevent him from noticing
her so as to rouse the little chitâs vanity, and in this way perturb the rustic
drama of her life. Arthur would soon join his regiment, and be far away: no,
there could be no danger in that quarter, even if Arthurâs character had not
been a strong security against it. His honest, patronizing pride in the
good-will and respect of everybody about him was a safeguard even against
foolish romance, still more against a lower kind of folly. If there had been
anything special on Arthurâs mind in the previous conversation, it was clear he
was not inclined to enter into details, and Mr. Irwine was too delicate to
imply even a friendly curiosity. He perceived a change of subject would be
welcome, and said, âBy the way, Arthur, at your colonelâs birthday fÃªte there
were some transparencies that made a great effect in honour of Britannia, and
Pitt, and the Loamshire Militia, and, above all, the âgenerous youth,â the hero
of the day. Donât you think you should get up something of the same sort to
astonish our weak minds?â

The opportunity was gone. While Arthur was hesitating, the rope to which he
might have clung had drifted awayâhe must trust now to his own swimming.

In ten minutes from that time, Mr. Irwine was called for on business, and
Arthur, bidding him good-bye, mounted his horse again with a sense of
dissatisfaction, which he tried to quell by determining to set off for
Eagledale without an hourâs delay.

Book Second

Chapter XVII

In Which the Story Pauses a Little

âThis Rector of Broxton is little better than a pagan!â I hear one of my
readers exclaim. âHow much more edifying it would have been if you had made him
give Arthur some truly spiritual advice! You might have put into his mouth the
most beautiful thingsâquite as good as reading a sermon.â

Certainly I could, if I held it the highest vocation of the novelist to
represent things as they never have been and never will be. Then, of course, I
might refashion life and character entirely after my own liking; I might select
the most unexceptionable type of clergyman and put my own admirable opinions
into his mouth on all occasions. But it happens, on the contrary, that my
strongest effort is to avoid any such arbitrary picture, and to give a faithful
account of men and things as they have mirrored themselves in my mind. The
mirror is doubtless defective, the outlines will sometimes be disturbed, the
reflection faint or confused; but I feel as much bound to tell you as precisely
as I can what that reflection is, as if I were in the witness-box, narrating my
experience on oath.

Sixty years agoâit is a long time, so no wonder things have changedâall
clergymen were not zealous; indeed, there is reason to believe that the number
of zealous clergymen was small, and it is probable that if one among the small
minority had owned the livings of Broxton and Hayslope in the year 1799, you
would have liked him no better than you like Mr. Irwine. Ten to one, you would
have thought him a tasteless, indiscreet, methodistical man. It is so very
rarely that facts hit that nice medium required by our own enlightened opinions
and refined taste! Perhaps you will say, âDo improve the facts a little, then;
make them more accordant with those correct views which it is our privilege to
possess. The world is not just what we like; do touch it up with a tasteful
pencil, and make believe it is not quite such a mixed entangled affair. Let all
people who hold unexceptionable opinions act unexceptionably. Let your most
faulty characters always be on the wrong side, and your virtuous ones on the
right. Then we shall see at a glance whom we are to condemn and whom we are to
approve. Then we shall be able to admire, without the slightest disturbance of
our prepossessions: we shall hate and despise with that true ruminant relish
which belongs to undoubting confidence.â

But, my good friend, what will you do then with your fellow-parishioner who
opposes your husband in the vestry? With your newly appointed vicar, whose
style of preaching you find painfully below that of his regretted predecessor?
With the honest servant who worries your soul with her one failing? With your
neighbour, Mrs. Green, who was really kind to you in your last illness, but has
said several ill-natured things about you since your convalescence? Nay, with
your excellent husband himself, who has other irritating habits besides that of
not wiping his shoes? These fellow-mortals, every one, must be accepted as they
are: you can neither straighten their noses, nor brighten their wit, nor
rectify their dispositions; and it is these peopleâamongst whom your life is
passedâthat it is needful you should tolerate, pity, and love: it is these more
or less ugly, stupid, inconsistent people whose movements of goodness you
should be able to admireâfor whom you should cherish all possible hopes, all
possible patience. And I would not, even if I had the choice, be the clever
novelist who could create a world so much better than this, in which we get up
in the morning to do our daily work, that you would be likely to turn a harder,
colder eye on the dusty streets and the common green fieldsâon the real
breathing men and women, who can be chilled by your indifference or injured by
your prejudice; who can be cheered and helped onward by your fellow-feeling,
your forbearance, your outspoken, brave justice.

So I am content to tell my simple story, without trying to make things seem
better than they were; dreading nothing, indeed, but falsity, which, in spite
of oneâs best efforts, there is reason to dread. Falsehood is so easy, truth so
difficult. The pencil is conscious of a delightful facility in drawing a
griffinâthe longer the claws, and the larger the wings, the better; but that
marvellous facility which we mistook for genius is apt to forsake us when we
want to draw a real unexaggerated lion. Examine your words well, and you will
find that even when you have no motive to be false, it is a very hard thing to
say the exact truth, even about your own immediate feelingsâmuch harder than to
say something fine about them which is
not
the exact truth.

It is for this rare, precious quality of truthfulness that I delight in many
Dutch paintings, which lofty-minded people despise. I find a source of
delicious sympathy in these faithful pictures of a monotonous homely existence,
which has been the fate of so many more among my fellow-mortals than a life of
pomp or of absolute indigence, of tragic suffering or of world-stirring
actions. I turn, without shrinking, from cloud-borne angels, from prophets,
sibyls, and heroic warriors, to an old woman bending over her flower-pot, or
eating her solitary dinner, while the noonday light, softened perhaps by a
screen of leaves, falls on her mob-cap, and just touches the rim of her
spinning-wheel, and her stone jug, and all those cheap common things which are
the precious necessaries of life to herâor I turn to that village wedding, kept
between four brown walls, where an awkward bridegroom opens the dance with a
high-shouldered, broad-faced bride, while elderly and middle-aged friends look
on, with very irregular noses and lips, and probably with quart-pots in their
hands, but with an expression of unmistakable contentment and goodwill. âFoh!â
says my idealistic friend, âwhat vulgar details! What good is there in taking
all these pains to give an exact likeness of old women and clowns? What a low
phase of life! What clumsy, ugly people!â

But bless us, things may be lovable that are not altogether handsome, I hope? I
am not at all sure that the majority of the human race have not been ugly, and
even among those âlords of their kind,â the British, squat figures, ill-shapen
nostrils, and dingy complexions are not startling exceptions. Yet there is a
great deal of family love amongst us. I have a friend or two whose class of
features is such that the Apollo curl on the summit of their brows would be
decidedly trying; yet to my certain knowledge tender hearts have beaten for
them, and their miniaturesâflattering, but still not lovelyâare kissed in
secret by motherly lips. I have seen many an excellent matron, who could have
never in her best days have been handsome, and yet she had a packet of yellow
love-letters in a private drawer, and sweet children showered kisses on her
sallow cheeks. And I believe there have been plenty of young heroes, of middle
stature and feeble beards, who have felt quite sure they could never love
anything more insignificant than a Diana, and yet have found themselves in
middle life happily settled with a wife who waddles. Yes! Thank God; human
feeling is like the mighty rivers that bless the earth: it does not wait for
beautyâit flows with resistless force and brings beauty with it.

All honour and reverence to the divine beauty of form! Let us cultivate it to
the utmost in men, women, and childrenâin our gardens and in our houses. But
let us love that other beauty too, which lies in no secret of proportion, but
in the secret of deep human sympathy. Paint us an angel, if you can, with a
floating violet robe, and a face paled by the celestial light; paint us yet
oftener a Madonna, turning her mild face upward and opening her arms to welcome
the divine glory; but do not impose on us any aesthetic rules which shall
banish from the region of Art those old women scraping carrots with their
work-worn hands, those heavy clowns taking holiday in a dingy pot-house, those
rounded backs and stupid weather-beaten faces that have bent over the spade and
done the rough work of the worldâthose homes with their tin pans, their brown
pitchers, their rough curs, and their clusters of onions. In this world there
are so many of these common coarse people, who have no picturesque sentimental
wretchedness! It is so needful we should remember their existence, else we may
happen to leave them quite out of our religion and philosophy and frame lofty
theories which only fit a world of extremes. Therefore, let Art always remind
us of them; therefore let us always have men ready to give the loving pains of
a life to the faithful representing of commonplace thingsâmen who see beauty in
these commonplace things, and delight in showing how kindly the light of heaven
falls on them. There are few prophets in the world; few sublimely beautiful
women; few heroes. I canât afford to give all my love and reverence to such
rarities: I want a great deal of those feelings for my every-day fellow-men,
especially for the few in the foreground of the great multitude, whose faces I
know, whose hands I touch, for whom I have to make way with kindly courtesy.
Neither are picturesque lazzaroni or romantic criminals half so frequent as
your common labourer, who gets his own bread and eats it vulgarly but
creditably with his own pocket-knife. It is more needful that I should have a
fibre of sympathy connecting me with that vulgar citizen who weighs out my
sugar in a vilely assorted cravat and waistcoat, than with the handsomest
rascal in red scarf and green feathersâmore needful that my heart should swell
with loving admiration at some trait of gentle goodness in the faulty people
who sit at the same hearth with me, or in the clergyman of my own parish, who
is perhaps rather too corpulent and in other respects is not an Oberlin or a
Tillotson, than at the deeds of heroes whom I shall never know except by
hearsay, or at the sublimest abstract of all clerical graces that was ever
conceived by an able novelist.

And so I come back to Mr. Irwine, with whom I desire you to be in perfect
charity, far as he may be from satisfying your demands on the clerical
character. Perhaps you think he was notâas he ought to have beenâa living
demonstration of the benefits attached to a national church? But I am not sure
of that; at least I know that the people in Broxton and Hayslope would have
been very sorry to part with their clergyman, and that most faces brightened at
his approach; and until it can be proved that hatred is a better thing for the
soul than love, I must believe that Mr. Irwineâs influence in his parish was a
more wholesome one than that of the zealous Mr. Ryde, who came there twenty
years afterwards, when Mr. Irwine had been gathered to his fathers. It is true,
Mr. Ryde insisted strongly on the doctrines of the Reformation, visited his
flock a great deal in their own homes, and was severe in rebuking the
aberrations of the fleshâput a stop, indeed, to the Christmas rounds of the
church singers, as promoting drunkenness and too light a handling of sacred
things. But I gathered from Adam Bede, to whom I talked of these matters in his
old age, that few clergymen could be less successful in winning the hearts of
their parishioners than Mr. Ryde. They learned a great many notions about
doctrine from him, so that almost every church-goer under fifty began to
distinguish as well between the genuine gospel and what did not come precisely
up to that standard, as if he had been born and bred a Dissenter; and for some
time after his arrival there seemed to be quite a religious movement in that
quiet rural district. âBut,â said Adam, âIâve seen pretty clear, ever since I
was a young un, as religionâs something else besides notions. It isnât notions
sets people doing the right thingâitâs feelings. Itâs the same with the notions
in religion as it is with mathâmaticsâa man may be able to work problems
straight off inâs head as he sits by the fire and smokes his pipe, but if he
has to make a machine or a building, he must have a will and a resolution and
love something else better than his own ease. Somehow, the congregation began
to fall off, and people began to speak light oâ Mr. Ryde. I believe he meant
right at bottom; but, you see, he was sourish-tempered, and was for beating
down prices with the people as worked for him; and his preaching wouldnât go
down well with that sauce. And he wanted to be like my lord judge iâ the
parish, punishing folks for doing wrong; and he scolded âem from the pulpit as
if heâd been a Ranter, and yet he couldnât abide the Dissenters, and was a deal
more set against âem than Mr. Irwine was. And then he didnât keep within his
income, for he seemed to think at first go-off that six hundred a-year was to
make him as big a man as Mr. Donnithorne. Thatâs a sore mischief Iâve often
seen with the poor curates jumping into a bit of a living all of a sudden. Mr.
Ryde was a deal thought on at a distance, I believe, and he wrote books, but as
for mathâmatics and the natur oâ things, he was as ignorant as a woman. He was
very knowing about doctrines, and used to call âem the bulwarks of the
Reformation; but Iâve always mistrusted that sort oâ learning as leaves folks
foolish and unreasonable about business. Now Mester Irwine was as different as
could be: as quick!âhe understood what you meant in a minute, and he knew all
about building, and could see when youâd made a good job. And he behaved as
much like a gentleman to the farmers, and thâ old women, and the labourers, as
he did to the gentry. You never saw
him
interfering and scolding, and
trying to play thâ emperor. Ah, he was a fine man as ever you set eyes on; and
so kind toâs mother and sisters. That poor sickly Miss Anneâhe seemed to think
more of her than of anybody else in the world. There wasnât a soul in the
parish had a word to say against him; and his servants stayed with him till
they were so old and pottering, he had to hire other folks to do their work.â

âWell,â I said, âthat was an excellent way of preaching in the weekdays; but I
daresay, if your old friend Mr. Irwine were to come to life again, and get into
the pulpit next Sunday, you would be rather ashamed that he didnât preach
better after all your praise of him.â

âNay, nay,â said Adam, broadening his chest and throwing himself back in his
chair, as if he were ready to meet all inferences, ânobody has ever heard me
say Mr. Irwine was much of a preacher. He didnât go into deep speritial
experience; and I know thereâs a deal in a manâs inward life as you canât
measure by the square, and say, âDo this and that âll follow,â and, âDo that
and this âll follow.â Thereâs things go on in the soul, and times when feelings
come into you like a rushing mighty wind, as the Scripture says, and part your
life in two aâmost, so you look back on yourself as if you was somebody else.
Those are things as you canât bottle up in a âdo thisâ and âdo thatâ; and Iâll
go so far with the strongest Methodist ever youâll find. That shows me thereâs
deep speritial things in religion. You canât make much out wiâ talking about
it, but you feel it. Mr. Irwine didnât go into those thingsâhe preached short
moral sermons, and that was all. But then he acted pretty much up to what he
said; he didnât set up for being so different from other folks one day, and
then be as like âem as two peas the next. And he made folks love him and
respect him, and that was better nor stirring up their gall wiâ being overbusy.
Mrs. Poyser used to sayâyou know she would have her word about everythingâshe
said, Mr. Irwine was like a good meal oâ victual, you were the better for him
without thinking on it, and Mr. Ryde was like a dose oâ physic, he gripped you
and worreted you, and after all he left you much the same.â

âBut didnât Mr. Ryde preach a great deal more about that spiritual part of
religion that you talk of, Adam? Couldnât you get more out of his sermons than
out of Mr. Irwineâs?â

âEh, I knowna. He preached a deal about doctrines. But Iâve seen pretty clear,
ever since I was a young un, as religionâs something else besides doctrines and
notions. I look at it as if the doctrines was like finding names for your
feelings, so as you can talk of âem when youâve never known âem, just as a man
may talk oâ tools when he knows their names, though heâs never so much as seen
âem, still less handled âem. Iâve heard a deal oâ doctrine iâ my time, for I
used to go after the Dissenting preachers along wiâ Seth, when I was a lad oâ
seventeen, and got puzzling myself a deal about thâ Arminians and the
Calvinists. The Wesleyans, you know, are strong Arminians; and Seth, who could
never abide anything harsh and was always for hoping the best, held fast by the
Wesleyans from the very first; but I thought I could pick a hole or two in
their notions, and I got disputing wiâ one oâ the class leaders down at
Treddlesâon, and harassed him so, first oâ this side and then oâ that, till at
last he said, âYoung man, itâs the devil making use oâ your pride and conceit
as a weapon to war against the simplicity oâ the truth.â I couldnât help
laughing then, but as I was going home, I thought the man wasnât far wrong. I
began to see as all this weighing and sifting what this text means and that
text means, and whether folks are saved all by Godâs grace, or whether there
goes an ounce oâ their own will toât, was no part oâ real religion at all. You
may talk oâ these things for hours on end, and youâll only be all the more coxy
and conceited forât. So I took to going nowhere but to church, and hearing
nobody but Mr. Irwine, for he said nothing but what was good and what youâd be
the wiser for remembering. And I found it better for my soul to be humble
before the mysteries oâ Godâs dealings, and not be making a clatter about what
I could never understand. And theyâre poor foolish questions after all; for
what have we got either inside or outside of us but what comes from God? If
weâve got a resolution to do right, He gave it us, I reckon, first or last; but
I see plain enough we shall never do it without a resolution, and thatâs enough
for me.â

Adam, you perceive, was a warm admirer, perhaps a partial judge, of Mr. Irwine,
as, happily, some of us still are of the people we have known familiarly.
Doubtless it will be despised as a weakness by that lofty order of minds who
pant after the ideal, and are oppressed by a general sense that their emotions
are of too exquisite a character to find fit objects among their everyday
fellowmen. I have often been favoured with the confidence of these select
natures, and find them to concur in the experience that great men are
overestimated and small men are insupportable; that if you would love a woman
without ever looking back on your love as a folly, she must die while you are
courting her; and if you would maintain the slightest belief in human heroism,
you must never make a pilgrimage to see the hero. I confess I have often meanly
shrunk from confessing to these accomplished and acute gentlemen what my own
experience has been. I am afraid I have often smiled with hypocritical assent,
and gratified them with an epigram on the fleeting nature of our illusions,
which any one moderately acquainted with French literature can command at a
momentâs notice. Human converse, I think some wise man has remarked, is not
rigidly sincere. But I herewith discharge my conscience, and declare that I
have had quite enthusiastic movements of admiration towards old gentlemen who
spoke the worst English, who were occasionally fretful in their temper, and who
had never moved in a higher sphere of influence than that of parish overseer;
and that the way in which I have come to the conclusion that human nature is
lovableâthe way I have learnt something of its deep pathos, its sublime
mysteriesâhas been by living a great deal among people more or less commonplace
and vulgar, of whom you would perhaps hear nothing very surprising if you were
to inquire about them in the neighbourhoods where they dwelt. Ten to one most
of the small shopkeepers in their vicinity saw nothing at all in them. For I
have observed this remarkable coincidence, that the select natures who pant
after the ideal, and find nothing in pantaloons or petticoats great enough to
command their reverence and love, are curiously in unison with the narrowest
and pettiest. For example, I have often heard Mr. Gedge, the landlord of the
Royal Oak, who used to turn a bloodshot eye on his neighbours in the village of
Shepperton, sum up his opinion of the people in his own parishâand they were
all the people he knewâin these emphatic words: âAye, sir, Iâve said it often,
and Iâll say it again, theyâre a poor lot iâ this parishâa poor lot, sir, big
and little.â I think he had a dim idea that if he could migrate to a distant
parish, he might find neighbours worthy of him; and indeed he did subsequently
transfer himself to the Saracenâs Head, which was doing a thriving business in
the back street of a neighbouring market-town. But, oddly enough, he has found
the people up that back street of precisely the same stamp as the inhabitants
of Sheppertonââa poor lot, sir, big and little, and them as comes for a go oâ
gin are no better than them as comes for a pint oâ twopennyâa poor lot.â

Chapter XVIII

Church

âHetty, Hetty, donât you know church begins at two, and itâs gone half after
one aâready? Have you got nothing better to think on this good Sunday as poor
old Thias Bedeâs to be put into the ground, and him drownded iâ thâ dead oâ the
night, as itâs enough to make oneâs back run cold, but you must be âdizening
yourself as if there was a wedding iâstid of a funeral?â

âWell, Aunt,â said Hetty, âI canât be ready so soon as everybody else, when
Iâve got Tottyâs things to put on. And Iâd ever such work to make her stand
still.â

Hetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her plain bonnet and shawl,
was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if she had been made of roses,
that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock. For her hat was trimmed with
pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a white ground. There was
nothing but pink and white about her, except in her dark hair and eyes and her
little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser was provoked at herself, for she could hardly
keep from smiling, as any mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round
things. So she turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house
door, followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some
one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she trod on.

And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit of
drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having a large
cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that promontory where
his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his
neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted by Mrs. Poyserâs own hand,
setting off the proportions of his leg. Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed
of his leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other
fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable
degeneracy of the human calf. Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his
round jolly face, which was good humour itself as he said, âCome, Hettyâcome,
little uns!â and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway
gate into the yard.

The âlittle unsâ addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven, in
little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy cheeks and
black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small elephant is like
a very large one. Hetty walked between them, and behind came patient Molly,
whose task it was to carry Totty through the yard and over all the wet places
on the road; for Totty, having speedily recovered from her threatened fever,
had insisted on going to church to-day, and especially on wearing her
red-and-black necklace outside her tippet. And there were many wet places for
her to be carried over this afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the
morning, though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery
masses on the horizon.

You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the farmyard.
The cocks and hens seemed to know it, and made only crooning subdued noises;
the very bull-dog looked less savage, as if he would have been satisfied with a
smaller bite than usual. The sunshine seemed to call all things to rest and not
to labour. It was asleep itself on the moss-grown cow-shed; on the group of
white ducks nestling together with their bills tucked under their wings; on the
old black sow stretched languidly on the straw, while her largest young one
found an excellent spring-bed on his motherâs fat ribs; on Alick, the shepherd,
in his new smock-frock, taking an uneasy siesta, half-sitting, half-standing on
the granary steps. Alick was of opinion that church, like other luxuries, was
not to be indulged in often by a foreman who had the weather and the ewes on
his mind. âChurch! NayâIân gotten summat else to think on,â was an answer which
he often uttered in a tone of bitter significance that silenced further
question. I feel sure Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind
was not of a speculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed
going to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and âWhissuntide.â But he had
a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies, like other
non-productive employments, were intended for people who had leisure.

âThereâs Father a-standing at the yard-gate,â said Martin Poyser. âI reckon he
wants to watch us down the field. Itâs wonderful what sight he has, and him
turned seventy-five.â

âAh, I often think itâs wiâ thâ old folks as it is wiâ the babbies,â said Mrs.
Poyser; âtheyâre satisfied wiâ looking, no matter what theyâre looking at. Itâs
God Aâmightyâs way oâ quietening âem, I reckon, afore they go to sleep.â

Old Martin opened the gate as he saw the family procession approaching, and
held it wide open, leaning on his stickâpleased to do this bit of work; for,
like all old men whose life has been spent in labour, he liked to feel that he
was still usefulâthat there was a better crop of onions in the garden because
he was by at the sowingâand that the cows would be milked the better if he
stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon to look on. He always went to church on
Sacrament Sundays, but not very regularly at other times; on wet Sundays, or
whenever he had a touch of rheumatism, he used to read the three first chapters
of Genesis instead.

âTheyâll haâ putten Thias Bede iâ the ground afore ye get to the churchyard,â
he said, as his son came up. âIt âud haâ been better luck if theyâd haâ buried
him iâ the forenoon when the rain was fallinâ; thereâs no likelihoods of a drop
now; anâ the moon lies like a boat there, dost see? Thatâs a sure sign oâ fair
weatherâthereâs a many as is false but thatâs sure.â

âAye, aye,â said the son, âIâm in hopes itâll hold up now.â

âMind what the parson says, mind what the parson says, my lads,â said
Grandfather to the black-eyed youngsters in knee-breeches, conscious of a
marble or two in their pockets which they looked forward to handling, a little,
secretly, during the sermon.

âDood-bye, Dandad,â said Totty. âMe doinâ to church. Me dot my neklace on. Dive
me a peppermint.â

Grandad, shaking with laughter at this âdeep little wench,â slowly transferred
his stick to his left hand, which held the gate open, and slowly thrust his
finger into the waistcoat pocket on which Totty had fixed her eyes with a
confident look of expectation.

And when they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate again, watching
them across the lane along the Home Close, and through the far gate, till they
disappeared behind a bend in the hedge. For the hedgerows in those days shut
out oneâs view, even on the better-managed farms; and this afternoon, the
dog-roses were tossing out their pink wreaths, the nightshade was in its yellow
and purple glory, the pale honeysuckle grew out of reach, peeping high up out
of a holly bush, and over all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its
shadow across the path.

There were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let them
pass: at the gate of the Home Close there was half the dairy of cows standing
one behind the other, extremely slow to understand that their large bodies
might be in the way; at the far gate there was the mare holding her head over
the bars, and beside her the liver-coloured foal with its head towards its
motherâs flank, apparently still much embarrassed by its own straddling
existence. The way lay entirely through Mr. Poyserâs own fields till they
reached the main road leading to the village, and he turned a keen eye on the
stock and the crops as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a
running commentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a large share
in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on stock and
their âkeepââan exercise which strengthens her understanding so much that she
finds herself able to give her husband advice on most other subjects.

âThereâs that shorthorned Sally,â she said, as they entered the Home Close, and
she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud and looking at her
with a sleepy eye. âI begin to hate the sight oâ the cow; and I say now what I
said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid of her the better, for thereâs that
little yallow cow as doesnât give half the milk, and yet Iâve twice as much
butter from her.â

âWhy, theeât not like the women in general,â said Mr. Poyser; âthey like the
shorthorns, as give such a lot oâ milk. Thereâs Chowneâs wife wants him to buy
no other sort.â

âWhatâs it sinnify what Chowneâs wife likes? A poor soft thing, wiâ no more
head-piece nor a sparrow. Sheâd take a big cullender to strain her lard wiâ,
and then wonder as the scratchinâs run through. Iâve seen enough of her to know
as Iâll niver take a servant from her house againâall hugger-muggerâand youâd
niver know, when you went in, whether it was Monday or Friday, the wash
dragginâ on to thâ end oâ the week; and as for her cheese, I know well enough
it rose like a loaf in a tin last year. And then she talks oâ the weather beinâ
iâ fault, as thereâs folks âud stand on their heads and then say the fault was
iâ their boots.â

âWell, Chowneâs been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if thee
likâst,â said Mr. Poyser, secretly proud of his wifeâs superior power of
putting two and two together; indeed, on recent market-days he had more than
once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of shorthorns. âAye, them
as choose a soft for a wife mayâs well buy up the shorthorns, for if you get
your head stuck in a bog, your legs mayâs well go after it. Eh! Talk oâ legs,
thereâs legs for you,â Mrs. Poyser continued, as Totty, who had been set down
now the road was dry, toddled on in front of her father and mother. âThereâs
shapes! Anâ sheâs got such a long foot, sheâll be her fatherâs own child.â

âAye, sheâll be welly such a one as Hetty iâ ten yearsâ time, onây sheâs got

thy
coloured eyes. I niver remember a blue eye iâ my family; my mother
had eyes as black as sloes, just like Hettyâs.â

âThe child âull be none the worse for having summat as isnât like Hetty. Anâ
Iâm none for having her so overpretty. Though for the matter oâ that, thereâs
people wiâ light hair anâ blue eyes as pretty as them wiâ black. If Dinah had
got a bit oâ colour in her cheeks, anâ didnât stick that Methodist cap on her
head, enough to frighten the cows, folks âud think her as pretty as Hetty.â

âNay, nay,â said Mr. Poyser, with rather a contemptuous emphasis, âthee dostna
know the pints of a woman. The men âud niver run after Dinah as they would
after Hetty.â

âWhat care I what the men âud run after? Itâs well seen what choice the most of
âem know how to make, by the poor draggle-tails oâ wives you see, like bits oâ
gauze ribbin, good for nothing when the colourâs gone.â

âWell, well, thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a choice when I
married thee,â said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled little conjugal disputes by
a compliment of this sort; âand thee wast twice as buxom as Dinah ten year
ago.â

âI niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good missis of a house.
Thereâs Chowneâs wife ugly enough to turn the milk anâ save the rennet, but
sheâll niver save nothing any other way. But as for Dinah, poor child, sheâs
niver likely to be buxom as long as sheâll make her dinner oâ cake and water,
for the sake oâ giving to them as want. She provoked me past bearing sometimes;
and, as I told her, she went clean againâ the Scripturâ, for that says, âLove
your neighbour as yourselfâ; âbut,â I said, âif you loved your neighbour no
better nor you do yourself, Dinah, itâs little enough youâd do for him. Youâd
be thinking he might do well enough on a half-empty stomach.â Eh, I wonder
where she is this blessed Sunday! Sitting by that sick woman, I daresay, as
sheâd set her heart on going to all of a sudden.â

âAh, it was a pity she should take such megrims into her head, when she might
haâ stayed wiâ us all summer, and eaten twice as much as she wanted, and it âud
niver haâ been missed. She made no odds in thâ house at all, for she sat as
still at her sewing as a bird on the nest, and was uncommon nimble at running
to fetch anything. If Hetty gets married, theedâst like to haâ Dinah wiâ thee
constant.â

âItâs no use thinking oâ that,â said Mrs. Poyser. âYou might as well beckon to
the flying swallow as ask Dinah to come anâ live here comfortable, like other
folks. If anything could turn her,
I
should haâ turned her, for Iâve
talked to her for a hour on end, and scolded her too; for sheâs my own sisterâs
child, and it behoves me to do what I can for her. But eh, poor thing, as soon
as sheâd said us âgood-byeâ anâ got into the cart, anâ looked back at me with
her pale face, as is welly like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven, I begun
to be frightened to think oâ the set-downs Iâd given her; for it comes over you
sometimes as if sheâd a way oâ knowing the rights oâ things more nor other
folks have. But Iâll niver give in as thatâs âcause sheâs a Methodist, no more
nor a white calfâs white âcause it eats out oâ the same bucket wiâ a black un.â

âNay,â said Mr. Poyser, with as near an approach to a snarl as his good-nature
would allow; âIâm no opinion oâ the Methodists. Itâs onây tradesfolks as turn
Methodists; you nuver knew a farmer bitten wiâ them maggots. Thereâs maybe a
workman now anâ then, as isnât overclever atâs work, takes to preachinâ anâ
that, like Seth Bede. But you see Adam, as has got one oâ the best head-pieces
hereabout, knows better; heâs a good Churchman, else Iâd never encourage him
for a sweetheart for Hetty.â

âWhy, goodness me,â said Mrs. Poyser, who had looked back while her husband was
speaking, âlook where Molly is with them lads! Theyâre the fieldâs length
behind us. How
could
you let âem do so, Hetty? Anybody might as well set
a picturâ to watch the children as you. Run back and tell âem to come on.â

Mr. and Mrs. Poyser were now at the end of the second field, so they set Totty
on the top of one of the large stones forming the true Loamshire stile, and
awaited the loiterers; Totty observing with complacency, âDey naughty, naughty
boysâme dood.â

The fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with great
excitement to Marty and Tommy, who saw a perpetual drama going on in the
hedgerows, and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had
been a couple of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite sure he saw a
yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while he was peeping, he
missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had run across the path and
was described with much fervour by the junior Tommy. Then there was a little
greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering along the ground, and it seemed quite
possible to catch it, till it managed to flutter under the blackberry bush.
Hetty could not be got to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on
for her ready sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and
said âLawks!â whenever she was expected to wonder.

Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to them
that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting, âWeâve found the
speckled turkeyâs nest, Mother!â with the instinctive confidence that people
who bring good news are never in fault.

âAh,â said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this pleasant
surprise, âthatâs a good lad; why, where is it?â

âDown in ever such a hole, under the hedge. I saw it first, looking after the
greenfinch, and she sat on thâ nest.â

âYou didnât frighten her, I hope,â said the mother, âelse sheâll forsake it.â

âNo, I went away as still as still, and whispered to Mollyâdidnât I, Molly?â

âWell, well, now come on,â said Mrs. Poyser, âand walk before Father and
Mother, and take your little sister by the hand. We must go straight on now.
Good boys donât look after the birds of a Sunday.â

âBut, Mother,â said Marty, âyou said youâd give half-a-crown to find the
speckled turkeyâs nest. Maynât I have the half-crown put into my money-box?â

âWeâll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good boy.â

The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at their
eldest-bornâs acuteness; but on Tommyâs round face there was a cloud.

âMother,â he said, half-crying, âMartyâs got ever so much more money in his box
nor Iâve got in mine.â

âMunny,
me
want half-a-toun in
my
bots,â said Totty.

âHush, hush, hush,â said Mrs. Poyser, âdid ever anybody hear such naughty
children? Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if they donât make
haste and go on to church.â

This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two remaining
fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any serious
interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles, alias âbullheads,â
which the lads looked at wistfully.

The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was not a
cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had often some
mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but no temptation would
have induced him to carry on any field-work, however early in the morning, on a
Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a pair of oxen âswelteredâ while he
was ploughing on Good Friday? That was a demonstration that work on sacred days
was a wicked thing; and with wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite
clear that he would have nothing to do, since money got by such means would
never prosper.

âIt aâmost makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines so,â he
observed, as they passed through the âBig Meadow.â âBut itâs poor foolishness
to think oâ saving by going against your conscience. Thereâs that Jim
Wakefield, as they used to call âGentleman Wakefield,â used to do the same of a
Sunday as oâ weekdays, and took no heed to right or wrong, as if there was
nayther God nor devil. Anâ whatâs he come to? Why, I saw him myself last
market-day a-carrying a basket wiâ oranges inât.â

âAh, to be sure,â said Mrs. Poyser, emphatically, âyou make but a poor trap to
catch luck if you go and bait it wiâ wickedness. The money as is got soâs like
to burn holes iâ your pocket. Iâd niver wish us to leave our lads a sixpence
but what was got iâ the rightful way. And as for the weather, thereâs One above
makes it, and we must put up wiât: itâs nothing of a plague to what the wenches
are.â

Notwithstanding the interruption in their walk, the excellent habit which Mrs.
Poyserâs clock had of taking time by the forelock had secured their arrival at
the village while it was still a quarter to two, though almost every one who
meant to go to church was already within the churchyard gates. Those who stayed
at home were chiefly mothers, like Timothyâs Bess, who stood at her own door
nursing her baby and feeling as women feel in that positionâthat nothing else
can be expected of them.

It was not entirely to see Thias Bedeâs funeral that the people were standing
about the churchyard so long before service began; that was their common
practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at once, and the
farmersâ wives talked in an undertone to each other, over the tall pews, about
their illnesses and the total failure of doctorâs stuff, recommending
dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as far preferableâabout the
servants, and their growing exorbitance as to wages, whereas the quality of
their services declined from year to year, and there was no girl nowadays to be
trusted any further than you could see herâabout the bad price Mr. Dingall, the
Treddleston grocer, was giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might
be held as to his solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible
woman, and they were all sorry for
her
, for she had very good kin.
Meantime the men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers,
who had a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church
until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature
entranceâwhat could they do in church if they were there before service
began?âand they did not conceive that any power in the universe could take it
ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about âbusâness.â

Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got his
clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry at him as a
stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at once as the village
blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow
took off his hat and stroked his hair to the farmers; for Chad was accustomed
to say that a working-man must hold a candle to a personage understood to be as
black as he was himself on weekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he
meant what was, after all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men who
had horses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and the rougher sort
of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn, where the burial
was going forward; but Sandy Jim, and several of the farm-labourers, made a
group round it, and stood with their hats off, as fellow-mourners with the
mother and sons. Others held a midway position, sometimes watching the group at
the grave, sometimes listening to the conversation of the farmers, who stood in
a knot near the church door, and were now joined by Martin Poyser, while his
family passed into the church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson,
the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking attitudeâthat is to
say, with the forefinger of his right hand thrust between the buttons of his
waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his head very much on one
side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who has only a mono-syllabic part
entrusted to him, but feels sure that the audience discern his fitness for the
leading business; curiously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his
hands behind him and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward
scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The talk was in
rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr.
Irwineâs voice reading the final prayers of the burial-service. They had all
had their word of pity for poor Thias, but now they had got upon the nearer
subject of their own grievances against Satchell, the Squireâs bailiff, who
played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr.
Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to receive his own
rents and make bargains about his own timber. This subject of conversation was
an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell himself might presently
be walking up the paved road to the church door. And soon they became suddenly
silent; for Mr. Irwineâs voice had ceased, and the group round the white thorn
was dispersing itself towards the church.

They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine passed.
Adam and Seth were coming next, with their mother between them; for Joshua Rann
officiated as head sexton as well as clerk, and was not yet ready to follow the
rector into the vestry. But there was a pause before the three mourners came
on: Lisbeth had turned round to look again towards the grave! Ah! There was
nothing now but the brown earth under the white thorn. Yet she cried less
to-day than she had done any day since her husbandâs death. Along with all her
grief there was mixed an unusual sense of her own importance in having a
âburial,â and in Mr. Irwineâs reading a special service for her husband; and
besides, she knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this
counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with her
sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods of their
fellow-parishioners.

The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the loiterers
followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr. Donnithorneâs
carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps helping to make them
feel that there was no need for haste.

But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth; the
evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every one must
now enter and take his place.

I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for anything
except for the grey age of its oaken pewsâgreat square pews mostly, ranged on
each side of a narrow aisle. It was free, indeed, from the modern blemish of
galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to themselves in the middle of the
right-hand row, so that it was a short process for Joshua Rann to take his
place among them as principal bass, and return to his desk after the singing
was over. The pulpit and desk, grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of
the arch leading into the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr.
Donnithorneâs family and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the
buff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior, and
agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats. And there
were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel, for the pulpit and Mr.
Donnithorneâs own pew had handsome crimson cloth cushions; and, to close the
vista, there was a crimson altar-cloth, embroidered with golden rays by Miss
Lydiaâs own hand.

But even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and cheering
when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on that simple
congregationâon the hardy old men, with bent knees and shoulders, perhaps, but
with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and thatching; on the tall stalwart
frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of the stone-cutters and carpenters; on
the half-dozen well-to-do farmers, with their apple-cheeked families; and on
the clean old women, mostly farm-labourersâ wives, with their bit of snow-white
cap-border under their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from
the elbow, folded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held
booksâwhy should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a few âgood
wordsâ by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved silently, following
the service without any very clear comprehension indeed, but with a simple
faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and bring blessing. And now all faces
were visible, for all were standing upâthe little children on the seats peeping
over the edge of the grey pews, while good Bishop Kenâs evening hymn was being
sung to one of those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation
of rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of Pan,
with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in his usual
place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother and Seth, and he
noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent tooâall the more agreeable
for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass notes with unusual complacency and
threw an extra ray of severity into the glances he sent over his spectacles at
the recusant Will Maskery.

I beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this scene, in his ample
white surplice that became him so well, with his powdered hair thrown back, his
rich brown complexion, and his finely cut nostril and upper lip; for there was
a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen countenance as there is in all
human faces from which a generous soul beams out. And over all streamed the
delicious June sunshine through the old windows, with their desultory patches
of yellow, red, and blue, that threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite
wall.

I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant longer
than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his family. And
there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible not to wander
thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But Hetty was at that
moment quite careless of any glancesâshe was absorbed in the thought that
Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church, for the carriage must
surely be at the church-gate by this time. She had never seen him since she
parted with him in the wood on Thursday evening, and oh, how long the time had
seemed! Things had gone on just the same as ever since that evening; the
wonders that had happened then had brought no changes after them; they were
already like a dream. When she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat
so, she dared not look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied
herself. That must be old Mr. Donnithorneâhe always came first, the wrinkled
small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing and
curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia was passing, and though Hetty
liked so much to look at her fashionable little coal-scuttle bonnet, with the
wreath of small roses round it, she didnât mind it to-day. But there were no
more curtsiesâno, he was not come; she felt sure there was nothing else passing
the pew door but the house-keeperâs black bonnet and the ladyâs maidâs
beautiful straw hat that had once been Miss Lydiaâs, and then the powdered
heads of the butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet she would look
nowâshe might be mistakenâfor, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted up
her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the chancelâthere was
no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles with his white
handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged prayer-book. The
chill disappointment was too hard to bear. She felt herself turning pale, her
lips trembling; she was ready to cry. Oh, what
should
she do? Everybody
would know the reason; they would know she was crying because Arthur was not
there. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful hothouse plant in his button-hole, was
staring at her, she knew. It was dreadfully long before the General Confession
began, so that she could kneel down. Two great drops
would
fall then,
but no one saw them except good-natured Molly, for her aunt and uncle knelt
with their backs towards her. Molly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in
church except faintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew
out of her pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after much
labour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against Hettyâs
nostrils. âIt donna smell,â she whispered, thinking this was a great advantage
which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good without biting your
nose. Hetty pushed it away peevishly; but this little flash of temper did what
the salts could not have doneâit roused her to wipe away the traces of her
tears, and try with all her might not to shed any more. Hetty had a certain
strength in her vain little nature: she would have borne anything rather than
be laughed at, or pointed at with any other feeling than admiration; she would
have pressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should know
a secret she did not want them to know.

What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings, while Mr.
Irwine was pronouncing the solemn âAbsolutionâ in her deaf ears, and through
all the tones of petition that followed! Anger lay very close to
disappointment, and soon won the victory over the conjectures her small
ingenuity could devise to account for Arthurâs absence on the supposition that
he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her again. And by the time she
rose from her knees mechanically, because all the rest were rising, the colour
had returned to her cheeks even with a heightened glow, for she was framing
little indignant speeches to herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her
this painâshe would like him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was
going on in her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the
eyelids with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so,
as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.

But Adamâs thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they rather
blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church service was a
channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness of our entire past
and our imagined future blends itself with all our moments of keen sensibility.
And to Adam the church service was the best channel he could have found for his
mingled regret, yearning, and resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries
for help with outbursts of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the
familiar rhythm of its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of
worship could have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from
their childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have
seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the streets.
The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but in its subtle
relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes the unsympathizing
observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to discern odours.

But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the service
in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village nooks in the
kingdomâa reason of which I am sure you have not the slightest suspicion. It
was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where that good shoemaker got his
notion of reading from remained a mystery even to his most intimate
acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it chiefly from Nature, who had
poured some of her music into this honest conceited soul, as she had been known
to do into other narrow souls before his. She had given him, at least, a fine
bass voice and a musical ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone
had sufficed to inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the
responses. The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence,
subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance, like
the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to nothing for
its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the wind among the
autumn boughs. This may seem a strange mode of speaking about the reading of a
parish clerkâa man in rusty spectacles, with stubbly hair, a large occiput, and
a prominent crown. But that is Natureâs way: she will allow a gentleman of
splendid physiognomy and poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and
not give him the slightest hint of it; and takes care that some narrow-browed
fellow, trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house, shall be as true to his
intervals as a bird.

Joshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing, and it was
always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from the desk to
the choir. Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an old man,
familiar to all the parish, had died a sad deathânot in his bed, a circumstance
the most painful to the mind of the peasantâand now the funeral psalm was to be
sung in memory of his sudden departure. Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at
church, and Joshuaâs importance in the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a
solemn minor strain they sang. The old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them,
and the wordsâ

âThou sweepâst us off as with a flood;

We vanish hence like dreamsââ

seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor Thias. The
mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings. Lisbeth had a vague
belief that the psalm was doing her husband good; it was part of that decent
burial which she would have thought it a greater wrong to withhold from him
than to have caused him many unhappy days while he was living. The more there
was said about her husband, the more there was done for him, surely the safer
he would be. It was poor Lisbethâs blind way of feeling that human love and
pity are a ground of faith in some other love. Seth, who was easily touched,
shed tears, and tried to recall, as he had done continually since his fatherâs
death, all that he had heard of the possibility that a single moment of
consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and reconcilement; for
was it not written in the very psalm they were singing that the Divine dealings
were not measured and circumscribed by time? Adam had never been unable to join
in a psalm before. He had known plenty of trouble and vexation since he had
been a lad, but this was the first sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and
strangely enough it was sorrow because the chief source of his past trouble and
vexation was for ever gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his
fatherâs hand before their parting, and say, âFather, you know it was all right
between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive me if
I have been too hot and hasty now and then!â Adam thought but little to-day of
the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his father: his thoughts ran
constantly on what the old manâs feelings had been in moments of humiliation,
when he had held down his head before the rebukes of his son. When our
indignation is borne in submissive silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt
afterwards as to our own generosity, if not justice; how much more when the
object of our anger has gone into everlasting silence, and we have seen his
face for the last time in the meekness of death!

âAh! I was always too hard,â Adam said to himself. âItâs a sore fault in me as
Iâm so hot and out oâ patience with people when they do wrong, and my heart
gets shut up against âem, so as I canât bring myself to forgive âem. I see
clear enough thereâs more pride nor love in my soul, for I could sooner make a
thousand strokes with thâ hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind
word to him. And there went plenty oâ pride and temper to the strokes, as the
devil
will
be having his finger in what we call our duties as well as
our sins. Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was
easiest for myself. Itâs allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still,
but the real tough job for me âud be to master my own will and temper and go
right against my own pride. It seems to me now, if I was to find Father at home
to-night, I should behave different; but thereâs no knowingâperhaps nothing âud
be a lesson to us if it didnât come too late. Itâs well we should feel as
lifeâs a reckoning we canât make twice over; thereâs no real making amends in
this world, any more nor you can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your
addition right.â

This was the key-note to which Adamâs thoughts had perpetually returned since
his fatherâs death, and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm was only an
influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger emphasis. So was the
sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference to Thiasâs funeral. It spoke
briefly and simply of the words, âIn the midst of life we are in deathââhow the
present moment is all we can call our own for works of mercy, of righteous
dealing, and of family tenderness. All very old truthsâbut what we thought the
oldest truth becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked
on the dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want
to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do they not
let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure its intensity by
remembering the former dimness?

Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime words,
âThe peace of God, which passeth all understanding,â seemed to blend with the
calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of the congregation; and
then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the bonnets of the little maidens
who had slept through the sermon, the fathers collecting the prayer-books,
until all streamed out through the old archway into the green churchyard and
began their neighbourly talk, their simple civilities, and their invitations to
tea; for on a Sunday every one was ready to receive a guestâit was the day when
all must be in their best clothes and their best humour.

Mr. and Mrs. Poyser paused a minute at the church gate: they were waiting for
Adam to come up, not being contented to go away without saying a kind word to
the widow and her sons.

âWell, Mrs. Bede,â said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on together, âyou must keep
up your heart; husbands and wives must be content when theyâve lived to rear
their children and see one anotherâs hair grey.â

âAye, aye,â said Mr. Poyser; âthey wonna have long to wait for one another
then, anyhow. And yeâve got two oâ the strappingâst sons iâ thâ country; and
well you may, for I remember poor Thias as fine a broad-shouldered fellow as
need to be; and as for you, Mrs. Bede, why youâre straighter iâ the back nor
half the young women now.â

âEh,â said Lisbeth, âitâs poor luck for the platter to wear well when itâs
broke iâ two. The sooner Iâm laid under the thorn the better. Iâm no good to
nobody now.â

Adam never took notice of his motherâs little unjust plaints; but Seth said,
âNay, Mother, thee mustna say so. Thy sons âull never get another mother.â

âThatâs true, lad, thatâs true,â said Mr. Poyser; âand itâs wrong on us to give
way to grief, Mrs. Bede; for itâs like the children cryinâ when the fathers and
mothers take things from âem. Thereâs One above knows better nor us.â

âAh,â said Mrs. Poyser, âanâ itâs poor work allays settinâ the dead above the
livinâ. We shall all on us be dead some time, I reckonâit âud be better if
folks âud make much on us beforehand, iâstid oâ beginninâ when weâre gone. Itâs
but little good youâll do a-watering the last yearâs crop.â

âWell, Adam,â said Mr. Poyser, feeling that his wifeâs words were, as usual,
rather incisive than soothing, and that it would be well to change the subject,
âyouâll come and see us again now, I hope. I hanna had a talk with you this
long while, and the missis here wants you to see what can be done with her best
spinning-wheel, for itâs got broke, and itâll be a nice job to mend itâthereâll
want a bit oâ turning. Youâll come as soon as you can now, will you?â

Mr. Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking, as if to see where
Hetty was; for the children were running on before. Hetty was not without a
companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about her than ever, for
she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white hot-house plant, with a very
long nameâa Scotch name, she supposed, since people said Mr. Craig the gardener
was Scotch. Adam took the opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you
will not require of him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting
expression on Hettyâs face as she listened to the gardenerâs small talk. Yet in
her secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps
learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she cared to
ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be given
spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond of giving
information.

Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were received
coldly, for to shift oneâs point of view beyond certain limits is impossible to
the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of us aware of the impression
we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble understandingâit is possible they see
hardly anything in us. Moreover, Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was
already in his tenth year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of
matrimony and bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a
little heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty that
the âlass was well enough,â and that âa man might do worseâ; but on convivial
occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.

Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who âknew his businessâ and
who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he was less of a
favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said in confidence to her
husband, âYouâre mighty fond oâ Craig, but for my part, I think heâs welly like
a cock as thinks the sunâs rose oâ purpose to hear him crow.â For the rest, Mr.
Craig was an estimable gardener, and was not without reasons for having a high
opinion of himself. He had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung
his head forward a little, as he walked along with his hands in his breeches
pockets. I think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being
Scotch, and not his âbringing upâ; for except that he had a stronger burr in
his accent, his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people about
him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a French teacher is Parisian.

âWell, Mr. Poyser,â he said, before the good slow farmer had time to speak,
âyeâll not be carrying your hay to-morrow, Iâm thinking. The glass sticks at
âchange,â and ye may rely upoâ my word as weâll haâ more downfall afore
twenty-four hours is past. Ye see that darkish-blue cloud there upoâ the
ârizonâye know what I mean by the ârizon, where the land and sky seems to
meet?â

âAye, aye, I see the cloud,â said Mr. Poyser, âârizon or no ârizon. Itâs right
oâer Mike Holdsworthâs fallow, and a foul fallow it is.â

âWell, you mark my words, as that cloud âull spread oâer the sky pretty nigh as
quick as youâd spread a tarpaulin over one oâ your hay-ricks. Itâs a great
thing to haâ studied the look oâ the clouds. Lord bless you! Thâ metâorological
almanecks can learn me nothing, but thereâs a pretty sight oâ things I could
let
them
up to, if theyâd just come to me. And how are
you
, Mrs.
Poyser?âthinking oâ getherinâ the red currants soon, I reckon. Youâd a deal
better gether âem afore theyâre oâerripe, wiâ such weather as weâve got to look
forward to. How do ye do, Mistress Bede?â Mr. Craig continued, without a pause,
nodding by the way to Adam and Seth. âI hope yâ enjoyed them spinach and
gooseberries as I sent Chester with thâ other day. If ye want vegetables while
yeâre in trouble, ye know where to come to. Itâs well known Iâm not giving
other folksâ things away, for when Iâve supplied the house, the gardenâs my own
spekilation, and it isna every man thâ old squire could get as âud be equil to
the undertaking, let alone asking whether heâd be willing. Iâve got to run my
calkilation fine, I can tell you, to make sure oâ getting back the money as I
pay the squire. I should like to see some oâ them fellows as make the almanecks
looking as far before their noses as Iâve got to do every year as comes.â

âThey look pretty fur, though,â said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on one side
and speaking in rather a subdued reverential tone. âWhy, what could come truer
nor that pictur oâ the cock wiâ the big spurs, as has got its head knocked down
wiâ thâ anchor, anâ thâ firinâ, anâ the ships behind? Why, that pictur was made
afore Christmas, and yit itâs come as true as thâ Bible. Why, thâ cockâs
France, anâ thâ anchorâs Nelsonâanâ they told us that beforehand.â

âPeeâee-eh!â said Mr. Craig. âA man doesna want to see fur to know as thâ
English âull beat the French. Why, I know upoâ good authority as itâs a big
Frenchman as reaches five foot high, anâ they live upoâ spoon-meat mostly. I
knew a man as his father had a particular knowledge oâ the French. I should
like to know what them grasshoppers are to do against such fine fellows as our
young Captain Arthur. Why, it âud astonish a Frenchman only to look at him; his
armâs thicker nor a Frenchmanâs body, Iâll be bound, for they pinch theirsells
in wiâ stays; and itâs easy enough, for theyâve got nothing iâ their insides.â

âWhere is the captain, as he wasna at church to-day?â said Adam. âI was talking
to him oâ Friday, and he said nothing about his going away.â

âOh, heâs only gone to Eagledale for a bit oâ fishing; I reckon heâll be back
again afore many days are oâer, for heâs to be at all thâ arranging and
preparing oâ things for the cominâ oâ age oâ the 30th oâ July. But heâs fond oâ
getting away for a bit, now and then. Him and thâ old squire fit one another
like frost and flowers.â

Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation, but the
subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the turning in the
road where Adam and his companions must say âgood-bye.â The gardener, too,
would have had to turn off in the same direction if he had not accepted Mr.
Poyserâs invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly seconded the invitation, for she
would have held it a deep disgrace not to make her neighbours welcome to her
house: personal likes and dislikes must not interfere with that sacred custom.
Moreover, Mr. Craig had always been full of civilities to the family at the
Hall Farm, and Mrs. Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she had ânothing to
say againâ him, onây it was a pity he couldna be hatched oâer again, anâ
hatched different.â

So Adam and Seth, with their mother between them, wound their way down to the
valley and up again to the old house, where a saddened memory had taken the
place of a long, long anxietyâwhere Adam would never have to ask again as he
entered, âWhereâs Father?â

And the other family party, with Mr. Craig for company, went back to the
pleasant bright house-place at the Hall Farmâall with quiet minds, except
Hetty, who knew now where Arthur was gone, but was only the more puzzled and
uneasy. For it appeared that his absence was quite voluntary; he need not have
goneâhe would not have gone if he had wanted to see her. She had a sickening
sense that no lot could ever be pleasant to her again if her Thursday nightâs
vision was not to be fulfilled; and in this moment of chill, bare, wintry
disappointment and doubt, she looked towards the possibility of being with
Arthur again, of meeting his loving glance, and hearing his soft words with
that eager yearning which one may call the âgrowing painâ of passion.

Chapter XIX

Adam on a Working Day

Notwithstanding Mr. Craigâs prophecy, the dark-blue cloud dispersed itself
without having produced the threatened consequences. âThe weatherââas he
observed the next morningââthe weather, you see, âs a ticklish thing, anâ a
fool âull hit onât sometimes when a wise man misses; thatâs why the almanecks
get so much credit. Itâs one oâ them chancy things as fools thrive on.â

This unreasonable behaviour of the weather, however, could displease no one
else in Hayslope besides Mr. Craig. All hands were to be out in the meadows
this morning as soon as the dew had risen; the wives and daughters did double
work in every farmhouse, that the maids might give their help in tossing the
hay; and when Adam was marching along the lanes, with his basket of tools over
his shoulder, he caught the sound of jocose talk and ringing laughter from
behind the hedges. The jocose talk of hay-makers is best at a distance; like
those clumsy bells round the cowsâ necks, it has rather a coarse sound when it
comes close, and may even grate on your ears painfully; but heard from far off,
it mingles very prettily with the other joyous sounds of nature. Menâs muscles
move better when their souls are making merry music, though their merriment is
of a poor blundering sort, not at all like the merriment of birds.

And perhaps there is no time in a summerâs day more cheering than when the
warmth of the sun is just beginning to triumph over the freshness of the
morningâwhen there is just a lingering hint of early coolness to keep off
languor under the delicious influence of warmth. The reason Adam was walking
along the lanes at this time was because his work for the rest of the day lay
at a country-house about three miles off, which was being put in repair for the
son of a neighbouring squire; and he had been busy since early morning with the
packing of panels, doors, and chimney-pieces, in a waggon which was now gone on
before him, while Jonathan Burge himself had ridden to the spot on horseback,
to await its arrival and direct the workmen.

This little walk was a rest to Adam, and he was unconsciously under the charm
of the moment. It was summer morning in his heart, and he saw Hetty in the
sunshineâa sunshine without glare, with slanting rays that tremble between the
delicate shadows of the leaves. He thought, yesterday when he put out his hand
to her as they came out of church, that there was a touch of melancholy
kindness in her face, such as he had not seen before, and he took it as a sign
that she had some sympathy with his family trouble. Poor fellow! That touch of
melancholy came from quite another source, but how was he to know? We look at
the one little womanâs face we love as we look at the face of our mother earth,
and see all sorts of answers to our own yearnings. It was impossible for Adam
not to feel that what had happened in the last week had brought the prospect of
marriage nearer to him. Hitherto he had felt keenly the danger that some other
man might step in and get possession of Hettyâs heart and hand, while he
himself was still in a position that made him shrink from asking her to accept
him. Even if he had had a strong hope that she was fond of himâand his hope was
far from being strongâhe had been too heavily burdened with other claims to
provide a home for himself and Hettyâa home such as he could expect her to be
content with after the comfort and plenty of the Farm. Like all strong natures,
Adam had confidence in his ability to achieve something in the future; he felt
sure he should some day, if he lived, be able to maintain a family and make a
good broad path for himself; but he had too cool a head not to estimate to the
full the obstacles that were to be overcome. And the time would be so long! And
there was Hetty, like a bright-cheeked apple hanging over the orchard wall,
within sight of everybody, and everybody must long for her! To be sure, if she
loved him very much, she would be content to wait for him: but
did
she
love him? His hopes had never risen so high that he had dared to ask her. He
was clear-sighted enough to be aware that her uncle and aunt would have looked
kindly on his suit, and indeed, without this encouragement he would never have
persevered in going to the Farm; but it was impossible to come to any but
fluctuating conclusions about Hettyâs feelings. She was like a kitten, and had
the same distractingly pretty looks, that meant nothing, for everybody that
came near her.

But now he could not help saying to himself that the heaviest part of his
burden was removed, and that even before the end of another year his
circumstances might be brought into a shape that would allow him to think of
marrying. It would always be a hard struggle with his mother, he knew: she
would be jealous of any wife he might choose, and she had set her mind
especially against Hettyâperhaps for no other reason than that she suspected
Hetty to be the woman he
had
chosen. It would never do, he feared, for
his mother to live in the same house with him when he was married; and yet how
hard she would think it if he asked her to leave him! Yes, there was a great
deal of pain to be gone through with his mother, but it was a case in which he
must make her feel that his will was strongâit would be better for her in the
end. For himself, he would have liked that they should all live together till
Seth was married, and they might have built a bit themselves to the old house,
and made more room. He did not like âto part wiâ thâ ladâ: they had hardly ever
been separated for more than a day since they were born.

But Adam had no sooner caught his imagination leaping forward in this
wayâmaking arrangements for an uncertain futureâthan he checked himself. âA
pretty building Iâm making, without either bricks or timber. Iâm up iâ the
garret aâready, and havenât so much as dug the foundation.â Whenever Adam was
strongly convinced of any proposition, it took the form of a principle in his
mind: it was knowledge to be acted on, as much as the knowledge that damp will
cause rust. Perhaps here lay the secret of the hardness he had accused himself
of: he had too little fellow-feeling with the weakness that errs in spite of
foreseen consequences. Without this fellow-feeling, how are we to get enough
patience and charity towards our stumbling, falling companions in the long and
changeful journey? And there is but one way in which a strong determined soul
can learn itâby getting his heart-strings bound round the weak and erring, so
that he must share not only the outward consequence of their error, but their
inward suffering. That is a long and hard lesson, and Adam had at present only
learned the alphabet of it in his fatherâs sudden death, which, by annihilating
in an instant all that had stimulated his indignation, had sent a sudden rush
of thought and memory over what had claimed his pity and tenderness.

But it was Adamâs strength, not its correlative hardness, that influenced his
meditations this morning. He had long made up his mind that it would be wrong
as well as foolish for him to marry a blooming young girl, so long as he had no
other prospect than that of growing poverty with a growing family. And his
savings had been so constantly drawn upon (besides the terrible sweep of paying
for Sethâs substitute in the militia) that he had not enough money beforehand
to furnish even a small cottage, and keep something in reserve against a rainy
day. He had good hope that he should be âfirmer on his legsâ by and by; but he
could not be satisfied with a vague confidence in his arm and brain; he must
have definite plans, and set about them at once. The partnership with Jonathan
Burge was not to be thought of at presentâthere were things implicitly tacked
to it that he could not accept; but Adam thought that he and Seth might carry
on a little business for themselves in addition to their journeymanâs work, by
buying a small stock of superior wood and making articles of household
furniture, for which Adam had no end of contrivances. Seth might gain more by
working at separate jobs under Adamâs direction than by his journeymanâs work,
and Adam, in his overhours, could do all the âniceâ work that required peculiar
skill. The money gained in this way, with the good wages he received as
foreman, would soon enable them to get beforehand with the world, so sparingly
as they would all live now. No sooner had this little plan shaped itself in his
mind than he began to be busy with exact calculations about the wood to be
bought and the particular article of furniture that should be undertaken
firstâa kitchen cupboard of his own contrivance, with such an ingenious
arrangement of sliding-doors and bolts, such convenient nooks for stowing
household provender, and such a symmetrical result to the eye, that every good
housewife would be in raptures with it, and fall through all the gradations of
melancholy longing till her husband promised to buy it for her. Adam pictured
to himself Mrs. Poyser examining it with her keen eye and trying in vain to
find out a deficiency; and, of course, close to Mrs. Poyser stood Hetty, and
Adam was again beguiled from calculations and contrivances into dreams and
hopes. Yes, he would go and see her this eveningâit was so long since he had
been at the Hall Farm. He would have liked to go to the night-school, to see
why Bartle Massey had not been at church yesterday, for he feared his old
friend was ill; but, unless he could manage both visits, this last must be put
off till to-morrowâthe desire to be near Hetty and to speak to her again was
too strong.

As he made up his mind to this, he was coming very near to the end of his walk,
within the sound of the hammers at work on the refitting of the old house. The
sound of tools to a clever workman who loves his work is like the tentative
sounds of the orchestra to the violinist who has to bear his part in the
overture: the strong fibres begin their accustomed thrill, and what was a
moment before joy, vexation, or ambition, begins its change into energy. All
passion becomes strength when it has an outlet from the narrow limits of our
personal lot in the labour of our right arm, the cunning of our right hand, or
the still, creative activity of our thought. Look at Adam through the rest of
the day, as he stands on the scaffolding with the two-feet ruler in his hand,
whistling low while he considers how a difficulty about a floor-joist or a
window-frame is to be overcome; or as he pushes one of the younger workmen
aside and takes his place in upheaving a weight of timber, saying, âLet alone,
lad! Theeâst got too much gristle iâ thy bones yetâ; or as he fixes his keen
black eyes on the motions of a workman on the other side of the room and warns
him that his distances are not right. Look at this broad-shouldered man with
the bare muscular arms, and the thick, firm, black hair tossed about like
trodden meadow-grass whenever he takes off his paper cap, and with the strong
barytone voice bursting every now and then into loud and solemn psalm-tunes, as
if seeking an outlet for superfluous strength, yet presently checking himself,
apparently crossed by some thought which jars with the singing. Perhaps, if you
had not been already in the secret, you might not have guessed what sad
memories, what warm affection, what tender fluttering hopes, had their home in
this athletic body with the broken finger-nailsâin this rough man, who knew no
better lyrics than he could find in the Old and New Version and an occasional
hymn; who knew the smallest possible amount of profane history; and for whom
the motion and shape of the earth, the course of the sun, and the changes of
the seasons lay in the region of mystery just made visible by fragmentary
knowledge. It had cost Adam a great deal of trouble and work in overhours to
know what he knew over and above the secrets of his handicraft, and that
acquaintance with mechanics and figures, and the nature of the materials he
worked with, which was made easy to him by inborn inherited facultyâto get the
mastery of his pen, and write a plain hand, to spell without any other mistakes
than must in fairness be attributed to the unreasonable character of
orthography rather than to any deficiency in the speller, and, moreover, to
learn his musical notes and part-singing. Besides all this, he had read his
Bible, including the apocryphal books; Poor Richardâs Almanac, Taylorâs Holy
Living and Dying, The Pilgrimâs Progress, with Bunyanâs Life and Holy War, a
great deal of Baileyâs Dictionary, Valentine and Orson, and part of a History
of Babylon, which Bartle Massey had lent him. He might have had many more books
from Bartle Massey, but he had no time for reading âthe commin print,â as
Lisbeth called it, so busy as he was with figures in all the leisure moments
which he did not fill up with extra carpentry.

Adam, you perceive, was by no means a marvellous man, nor, properly speaking, a
genius, yet I will not pretend that his was an ordinary character among
workmen; and it would not be at all a safe conclusion that the next best man
you may happen to see with a basket of tools over his shoulder and a paper cap
on his head has the strong conscience and the strong sense, the blended
susceptibility and self-command, of our friend Adam. He was not an average man.
Yet such men as he are reared here and there in every generation of our peasant
artisansâwith an inheritance of affections nurtured by a simple family life of
common need and common industry, and an inheritance of faculties trained in
skilful courageous labour: they make their way upwards, rarely as geniuses,
most commonly as painstaking honest men, with the skill and conscience to do
well the tasks that lie before them. Their lives have no discernible echo
beyond the neighbourhood where they dwelt, but you are almost sure to find
there some good piece of road, some building, some application of mineral
produce, some improvement in farming practice, some reform of parish abuses,
with which their names are associated by one or two generations after them.
Their employers were the richer for them, the work of their hands has worn
well, and the work of their brains has guided well the hands of other men. They
went about in their youth in flannel or paper caps, in coats black with
coal-dust or streaked with lime and red paint; in old age their white hairs are
seen in a place of honour at church and at market, and they tell their
well-dressed sons and daughters, seated round the bright hearth on winter
evenings, how pleased they were when they first earned their twopence a-day.
Others there are who die poor and never put off the workmanâs coat on weekdays.
They have not had the art of getting rich, but they are men of trust, and when
they die before the work is all out of them, it is as if some main screw had
got loose in a machine; the master who employed them says, âWhere shall I find
their like?â

Chapter XX

Adam Visits the Hall Farm

Adam came back from his work in the empty waggonâthat was why he had changed
his clothesâand was ready to set out to the Hall Farm when it still wanted a
quarter to seven.

âWhatâs thee got thy Sunday cloose on for?â said Lisbeth complainingly, as he
came downstairs. âThee artna goinâ to thâ school iâ thy best coat?â

âNo, Mother,â said Adam, quietly. âIâm going to the Hall Farm, but mayhap I may
go to the school after, so thee mustna wonder if Iâm a bit late. Seth âull be
at home in half an hourâheâs only gone to the village; so thee wutna mind.â

âEh, anâ whatâs thee got thy best cloose on for to go to thâ Hall Farm? The
Poyser folks seeâd thee in âem yesterday, I warrand. What dost mean by turninâ
workiâday into Sunday a-thatân? Itâs poor keepinâ company wiâ folks as donna
like to see thee iâ thy workinâ jacket.â

âGood-bye, mother, I canât stay,â said Adam, putting on his hat and going out.

But he had no sooner gone a few paces beyond the door than Lisbeth became
uneasy at the thought that she had vexed him. Of course, the secret of her
objection to the best clothes was her suspicion that they were put on for
Hettyâs sake; but deeper than all her peevishness lay the need that her son
should love her. She hurried after him, and laid hold of his arm before he had
got half-way down to the brook, and said, âNay, my lad, thee wutna go away
angered wiâ thy mother, anâ her got nought to do but to sit by hersen anâ think
on thee?â

âNay, nay, Mother,â said Adam, gravely, and standing still while he put his arm
on her shoulder, âIâm not angered. But I wish, for thy own sake, theeâdst be
more contented to let me do what Iâve made up my mind to do. Iâll never be no
other than a good son to thee as long as we live. But a man has other feelings
besides what he owes toâs father and mother, and thee oughtna to want to rule
over me body and soul. And thee must make up thy mind as Iâll not give way to
thee where Iâve a right to do what I like. So let us have no more words about
it.â

âEh,â said Lisbeth, not willing to show that she felt the real bearing of
Adamâs words, âandâ who likes to see thee iâ thy best cloose better nor thy
mother? Anâ when theeâst got thy face washed as clean as the smooth white
pibble, anâ thy hair combed so nice, and thy eyes a-sparklinââwhat else is
there as thy old mother should like to look at half so well? Anâ thee shaât put
on thy Sunday cloose when thee likâst for meâIâll neâer plague thee no moor
aboutân.â

âWell, well; good-bye, mother,â said Adam, kissing her and hurrying away. He
saw there was no other means of putting an end to the dialogue. Lisbeth stood
still on the spot, shading her eyes and looking after him till he was quite out
of sight. She felt to the full all the meaning that had lain in Adamâs words,
and, as she lost sight of him and turned back slowly into the house, she said
aloud to herselfâfor it was her way to speak her thoughts aloud in the long
days when her husband and sons were at their workââEh, heâll be tellinâ me as
heâs goinâ to bring her home one oâ these days; anâ sheâll be missis oâer me,
and I mun look on, belike, while she uses the blue-edged platters, and breaks
âem, mayhap, though thereâs neâer been one broke sinâ my old man anâ me bought
âem at the fair twenty âear come next Whissuntide. Eh!â she went on, still
louder, as she caught up her knitting from the table, âbut sheâll neâer knit
the ladâs stockinâs, nor foot âem nayther, while I live; anâ when Iâm gone,
heâll bethink him as nobody âull neâer fitâs leg anâ foot as his old mother
did. Sheâll know nothinâ oâ narrowinâ anâ heelinâ, I warrand, anâ sheâll make a
long toe as he canna getâs boot on. Thatâs what comes oâ marrâinâ young
wenches. I war gone thirty, anâ thâ feyther too, afore we war married; anâ
young enough too. Sheâll be a poor dratchell by then
sheâs
thirty,
a-marrâinâ a-thatân, afore her teethâs all come.â

Adam walked so fast that he was at the yard-gate before seven. Martin Poyser
and the grandfather were not yet come in from the meadow: every one was in the
meadow, even to the black-and-tan terrierâno one kept watch in the yard but the
bull-dog; and when Adam reached the house-door, which stood wide open, he saw
there was no one in the bright clean house-place. But he guessed where Mrs.
Poyser and some one else would be, quite within hearing; so he knocked on the
door and said in his strong voice, âMrs. Poyser within?â

âCome in, Mr. Bede, come in,â Mrs. Poyser called out from the dairy. She always
gave Adam this title when she received him in her own house. âYou may come into
the dairy if you will, for I canna justly leave the cheese.â

Adam walked into the dairy, where Mrs. Poyser and Nancy were crushing the first
evening cheese.

âWhy, you might think you war come to a dead-house,â said Mrs. Poyser, as he
stood in the open doorway; âtheyâre all iâ the meadow; but Martinâs sure to be
in afore long, for theyâre leaving the hay cocked to-night, ready for carrying
first thing to-morrow. Iâve been forced tâ have Nancy in, upoâ âcount as Hetty
must gether the red currants to-night; the fruit allays ripens so contrairy,
just when every handâs wanted. Anâ thereâs no trustinâ the children to gether
it, for they put more into their own mouths nor into the basket; you might as
well set the wasps to gether the fruit.â

Adam longed to say he would go into the garden till Mr. Poyser came in, but he
was not quite courageous enough, so he said, âI could be looking at your
spinning-wheel, then, and see what wants doing to it. Perhaps it stands in the
house, where I can find it?â

âNo, Iâve put it away in the right-hand parlour; but let it be till I can fetch
it and show it you. Iâd be glad now if youâd go into the garden and tell Hetty
to send Totty in. The child âull run in if sheâs told, anâ I know Hettyâs
lettinâ her eat too many currants. Iâll be much obliged to you, Mr. Bede, if
youâll go and send her in; anâ thereâs the York and Lankester roses beautiful
in the garden nowâyouâll like to see âem. But youâd like a drink oâ whey first,
pârâaps; I know youâre fond oâ whey, as most folks is when they hanna got to
crush it out.â

âThank you, Mrs. Poyser,â said Adam; âa drink oâ wheyâs allays a treat to me.
Iâd rather have it than beer any day.â

âAye, aye,â said Mrs. Poyser, reaching a small white basin that stood on the
shelf, and dipping it into the whey-tub, âthe smell oâ breadâs sweet tâ
everybody but the baker. The Miss Irwines allays say, âOh, Mrs. Poyser, I envy
you your dairy; and I envy you your chickens; and what a beautiful thing a
farm-house is, to be sure!â Anâ I say, âYes; a farm-house is a fine thing for
them as look on, anâ donât know the liftinâ, anâ the stanninâ, anâ the
worritinâ oâ thâ inside as belongs toât.ââ

âWhy, Mrs. Poyser, you wouldnât like to live anywhere else but in a farm-house,
so well as you manage it,â said Adam, taking the basin; âand there can be
nothing to look at pleasanter nor a fine milch cow, standing up toâts knees in
pasture, and the new milk frothing in the pail, and the fresh butter ready for
market, and the calves, and the poultry. Hereâs to your health, and may you
allays have strength to look after your own dairy, and set a pattern tâ all the
farmersâ wives in the country.â

Mrs. Poyser was not to be caught in the weakness of smiling at a compliment,
but a quiet complacency over-spread her face like a stealing sunbeam, and gave
a milder glance than usual to her blue-grey eyes, as she looked at Adam
drinking the whey. Ah! I think I taste that whey nowâwith a flavour so delicate
that one can hardly distinguish it from an odour, and with that soft gliding
warmth that fills oneâs imagination with a still, happy dreaminess. And the
light music of the dropping whey is in my ears, mingling with the twittering of
a bird outside the wire network windowâthe window overlooking the garden, and
shaded by tall Guelder roses.

âHave a little more, Mr. Bede?â said Mrs. Poyser, as Adam set down the basin.

âNo, thank you; Iâll go into the garden now, and send in the little lass.â

âAye, do; and tell her to come to her mother in the dairy.â

Adam walked round by the rick-yard, at present empty of ricks, to the little
wooden gate leading into the gardenâonce the well-tended kitchen-garden of a
manor-house; now, but for the handsome brick wall with stone coping that ran
along one side of it, a true farmhouse garden, with hardy perennial flowers,
unpruned fruit-trees, and kitchen vegetables growing together in careless,
half-neglected abundance. In that leafy, flowery, bushy time, to look for any
one in this garden was like playing at âhide-and-seek.â There were the tall
hollyhocks beginning to flower and dazzle the eye with their pink, white, and
yellow; there were the syringas and Guelder roses, all large and disorderly for
want of trimming; there were leafy walls of scarlet beans and late peas; there
was a row of bushy filberts in one direction, and in another a huge apple-tree
making a barren circle under its low-spreading boughs. But what signified a
barren patch or two? The garden was so large. There was always a superfluity of
broad beansâit took nine or ten of Adamâs strides to get to the end of the
uncut grass walk that ran by the side of them; and as for other vegetables,
there was so much more room than was necessary for them that in the rotation of
crops a large flourishing bed of groundsel was of yearly occurrence on one spot
or other. The very rose-trees at which Adam stopped to pluck one looked as if
they grew wild; they were all huddled together in bushy masses, now flaunting
with wide-open petals, almost all of them of the streaked pink-and-white kind,
which doubtless dated from the union of the houses of York and Lancaster. Adam
was wise enough to choose a compact Provence rose that peeped out
half-smothered by its flaunting scentless neighbours, and held it in his
handâhe thought he should be more at ease holding something in his handâas he
walked on to the far end of the garden, where he remembered there was the
largest row of currant-trees, not far off from the great yew-tree arbour.

But he had not gone many steps beyond the roses, when he heard the shaking of a
bough, and a boyâs voice saying, âNow, then, Totty, hold out your pinnyâthereâs
a duck.â

The voice came from the boughs of a tall cherry-tree, where Adam had no
difficulty in discerning a small blue-pinafored figure perched in a commodious
position where the fruit was thickest. Doubtless Totty was below, behind the
screen of peas. Yesâwith her bonnet hanging down her back, and her fat face,
dreadfully smeared with red juice, turned up towards the cherry-tree, while she
held her little round hole of a mouth and her red-stained pinafore to receive
the promised downfall. I am sorry to say, more than half the cherries that fell
were hard and yellow instead of juicy and red; but Totty spent no time in
useless regrets, and she was already sucking the third juiciest when Adam said,
âThere now, Totty, youâve got your cherries. Run into the house with âem to
Motherâshe wants youâsheâs in the dairy. Run in this minuteâthereâs a good
little girl.â

He lifted her up in his strong arms and kissed her as he spoke, a ceremony
which Totty regarded as a tiresome interruption to cherry-eating; and when he
set her down she trotted off quite silently towards the house, sucking her
cherries as she went along.

âTommy, my lad, take care youâre not shot for a little thieving bird,â said
Adam, as he walked on towards the currant-trees.

He could see there was a large basket at the end of the row: Hetty would not be
far off, and Adam already felt as if she were looking at him. Yet when he
turned the corner she was standing with her back towards him, and stooping to
gather the low-hanging fruit. Strange that she had not heard him coming!
Perhaps it was because she was making the leaves rustle. She started when she
became conscious that some one was nearâstarted so violently that she dropped
the basin with the currants in it, and then, when she saw it was Adam, she
turned from pale to deep red. That blush made his heart beat with a new
happiness. Hetty had never blushed at seeing him before.

âI frightened you,â he said, with a delicious sense that it didnât signify what
he said, since Hetty seemed to feel as much as he did; âlet
me
pick the
currants up.â

That was soon done, for they had only fallen in a tangled mass on the
grass-plot, and Adam, as he rose and gave her the basin again, looked straight
into her eyes with the subdued tenderness that belongs to the first moments of
hopeful love.

Hetty did not turn away her eyes; her blush had subsided, and she met his
glance with a quiet sadness, which contented Adam because it was so unlike
anything he had seen in her before.

âThereâs not many more currants to get,â she said; âI shall soon haâ done now.â

âIâll help you,â said Adam; and he fetched the large basket, which was nearly
full of currants, and set it close to them.

Not a word more was spoken as they gathered the currants. Adamâs heart was too
full to speak, and he thought Hetty knew all that was in it. She was not
indifferent to his presence after all; she had blushed when she saw him, and
then there was that touch of sadness about her which must surely mean love,
since it was the opposite of her usual manner, which had often impressed him as
indifference. And he could glance at her continually as she bent over the
fruit, while the level evening sunbeams stole through the thick apple-tree
boughs, and rested on her round cheek and neck as if they too were in love with
her. It was to Adam the time that a man can least forget in after-life, the
time when he believes that the first woman he has ever loved betrays by a
slight somethingâa word, a tone, a glance, the quivering of a lip or an
eyelidâthat she is at least beginning to love him in return. The sign is so
slight, it is scarcely perceptible to the ear or eyeâhe could describe it to no
oneâit is a mere feather-touch, yet it seems to have changed his whole being,
to have merged an uneasy yearning into a delicious unconsciousness of
everything but the present moment. So much of our early gladness vanishes
utterly from our memory: we can never recall the joy with which we laid our
heads on our motherâs bosom or rode on our fatherâs back in childhood.
Doubtless that joy is wrought up into our nature, as the sunlight of long-past
mornings is wrought up in the soft mellowness of the apricot, but it is gone
for ever from our imagination, and we can only
believe
in the joy of
childhood. But the first glad moment in our first love is a vision which
returns to us to the last, and brings with it a thrill of feeling intense and
special as the recurrent sensation of a sweet odour breathed in a far-off hour
of happiness. It is a memory that gives a more exquisite touch to tenderness,
that feeds the madness of jealousy and adds the last keenness to the agony of
despair.

Hetty bending over the red bunches, the level rays piercing the screen of
apple-tree boughs, the length of bushy garden beyond, his own emotion as he
looked at her and believed that she was thinking of him, and that there was no
need for them to talkâAdam remembered it all to the last moment of his life.

And Hetty? You know quite well that Adam was mistaken about her. Like many
other men, he thought the signs of love for another were signs of love towards
himself. When Adam was approaching unseen by her, she was absorbed as usual in
thinking and wondering about Arthurâs possible return. The sound of any manâs
footstep would have affected her just in the same wayâshe would have

felt
it might be Arthur before she had time to see, and the blood that
forsook her cheek in the agitation of that momentary feeling would have rushed
back again at the sight of any one else just as much as at the sight of Adam.
He was not wrong in thinking that a change had come over Hetty: the anxieties
and fears of a first passion, with which she was trembling, had become stronger
than vanity, had given her for the first time that sense of helpless dependence
on anotherâs feeling which awakens the clinging deprecating womanhood even in
the shallowest girl that can ever experience it, and creates in her a
sensibility to kindness which found her quite hard before. For the first time
Hetty felt that there was something soothing to her in Adamâs timid yet manly
tenderness. She wanted to be treated lovinglyâoh, it was very hard to bear this
blank of absence, silence, apparent indifference, after those moments of
glowing love! She was not afraid that Adam would tease her with love-making and
flattering speeches like her other admirers; he had always been so reserved to
her; she could enjoy without any fear the sense that this strong brave man
loved her and was near her. It never entered into her mind that Adam was
pitiable tooâthat Adam too must suffer one day.

Hetty, we know, was not the first woman that had behaved more gently to the man
who loved her in vain because she had herself begun to love another. It was a
very old story, but Adam knew nothing about it, so he drank in the sweet
delusion.

âThatâll do,â said Hetty, after a little while. âAunt wants me to leave some on
the trees. Iâll take âem in now.â

âItâs very well I came to carry the basket,â said Adam âfor it âud haâ been too
heavy for your little arms.â

âNo; I could haâ carried it with both hands.â

âOh, I daresay,â said Adam, smiling, âand been as long getting into the house
as a little ant carrying a caterpillar. Have you ever seen those tiny fellows
carrying things four times as big as themselves?â

âNo,â said Hetty, indifferently, not caring to know the difficulties of ant
life.

âOh, I used to watch âem often when I was a lad. But now, you see, I can carry
the basket with one arm, as if it was an empty nutshell, and give you thâ other
arm to lean on. Wonât you? Such big arms as mine were made for little arms like
yours to lean on.â

Hetty smiled faintly and put her arm within his. Adam looked down at her, but
her eyes were turned dreamily towards another corner of the garden.

âHave you ever been to Eagledale?â she said, as they walked slowly along.

âYes,â said Adam, pleased to have her ask a question about himself. âTen years
ago, when I was a lad, I went with father to see about some work there. Itâs a
wonderful sightârocks and caves such as you never saw in your life. I never had
a right notion oâ rocks till I went there.â

âHow long did it take to get there?â

âWhy, it took us the best part oâ two daysâ walking. But itâs nothing of a
dayâs journey for anybody as has got a first-rate nag. The captain âud get
there in nine or ten hours, Iâll be bound, heâs such a rider. And I shouldnât
wonder if heâs back again to-morrow; heâs too active to rest long in that
lonely place, all by himself, for thereâs nothing but a bit of a inn iâ that
part where heâs gone to fish. I wish heâd got thâ estate in his hands; that âud
be the right thing for him, for it âud give him plenty to do, and heâd doât
well too, for all heâs so young; heâs got better notions oâ things than many a
man twice his age. He spoke very handsome to me thâ other day about lending me
money to set up iâ business; and if things came round that way, Iâd rather be
beholding to him nor to any man iâ the world.â

Poor Adam was led on to speak about Arthur because he thought Hetty would be
pleased to know that the young squire was so ready to befriend him; the fact
entered into his future prospects, which he would like to seem promising in her
eyes. And it was true that Hetty listened with an interest which brought a new
light into her eyes and a half-smile upon her lips.

âHow pretty the roses are now!â Adam continued, pausing to look at them. âSee!
I stole the prettiest, but I didna mean to keep it myself. I think these as are
all pink, and have got a finer sort oâ green leaves, are prettier than the
striped uns, donât you?â

He set down the basket and took the rose from his button-hole.

âIt smells very sweet,â he said; âthose striped uns have no smell. Stick it in
your frock, and then you can put it in water after. It âud be a pity to let it
fade.â

Hetty took the rose, smiling as she did so at the pleasant thought that Arthur
could so soon get back if he liked. There was a flash of hope and happiness in
her mind, and with a sudden impulse of gaiety she did what she had very often
done beforeâstuck the rose in her hair a little above the left ear. The tender
admiration in Adamâs face was slightly shadowed by reluctant disapproval.
Hettyâs love of finery was just the thing that would most provoke his mother,
and he himself disliked it as much as it was possible for him to dislike
anything that belonged to her.

âAh,â he said, âthatâs like the ladies in the pictures at the Chase; theyâve
mostly got flowers or feathers or gold things iâ their hair, but somehow I
donât like to see âem; they allays put me iâ mind oâ the painted women outside
the shows at Treddlesâon Fair. What can a woman have to set her off better than
her own hair, when it curls so, like yours? If a womanâs young and pretty, I
think you can see her good looks all the better for her being plain dressed.
Why, Dinah Morris looks very nice, for all she wears such a plain cap and gown.
It seems to me as a womanâs face doesna want flowers; itâs almost like a flower
itself. Iâm sure yours is.â

âOh, very well,â said Hetty, with a little playful pout, taking the rose out of
her hair. âIâll put one oâ Dinahâs caps on when we go in, and youâll see if I
look better in it. She left one behind, so I can take the pattern.â

âNay, nay, I donât want you to wear a Methodist cap like Dinahâs. I daresay
itâs a very ugly cap, and I used to think when I saw her here as it was
nonsense for her to dress different tâ other people; but I never rightly
noticed her till she came to see mother last week, and then I thought the cap
seemed to fit her face somehow as th âacorn-cup fits thâ acorn, and I shouldnât
like to see her so well without it. But youâve got another sort oâ face; Iâd
have you just as you are now, without anything tâ interfere with your own
looks. Itâs like when a manâs singing a good tuneâyou donât want tâ hear bells
tinkling and interfering wiâ the sound.â

He took her arm and put it within his again, looking down on her fondly. He was
afraid she should think he had lectured her, imagining, as we are apt to do,
that she had perceived all the thoughts he had only half-expressed. And the
thing he dreaded most was lest any cloud should come over this eveningâs
happiness. For the world he would not have spoken of his love to Hetty yet,
till this commencing kindness towards him should have grown into unmistakable
love. In his imagination he saw long years of his future life stretching before
him, blest with the right to call Hetty his own: he could be content with very
little at present. So he took up the basket of currants once more, and they
went on towards the house.

The scene had quite changed in the half-hour that Adam had been in the garden.
The yard was full of life now: Marty was letting the screaming geese through
the gate, and wickedly provoking the gander by hissing at him; the granary-door
was groaning on its hinges as Alick shut it, after dealing out the corn; the
horses were being led out to watering, amidst much barking of all the three
dogs and many âwhupsâ from Tim the ploughman, as if the heavy animals who held
down their meek, intelligent heads, and lifted their shaggy feet so
deliberately, were likely to rush wildly in every direction but the right.
Everybody was come back from the meadow; and when Hetty and Adam entered the
house-place, Mr. Poyser was seated in the three-cornered chair, and the
grandfather in the large arm-chair opposite, looking on with pleasant
expectation while the supper was being laid on the oak table. Mrs. Poyser had
laid the cloth herselfâa cloth made of homespun linen, with a shining checkered
pattern on it, and of an agreeable whitey-brown hue, such as all sensible
housewives like to seeânone of your bleached âshop-ragâ that would wear into
holes in no time, but good homespun that would last for two generations. The
cold veal, the fresh lettuces, and the stuffed chine might well look tempting
to hungry men who had dined at half-past twelve oâclock. On the large deal
table against the wall there were bright pewter plates and spoons and cans,
ready for Alick and his companions; for the master and servants ate their
supper not far off each other; which was all the pleasanter, because if a
remark about to-morrow morningâs work occurred to Mr. Poyser, Alick was at hand
to hear it.

âWell, Adam, Iâm glad to see ye,â said Mr. Poyser. âWhat! yeâve been helping
Hetty to gether the curranâs, eh? Come, sit ye down, sit ye down. Why, itâs
pretty near a three-week since yâ had your supper with us; and the missis has
got one of her rare stuffed chines. Iâm glad yeâre come.â

âHetty,â said Mrs. Poyser, as she looked into the basket of currants to see if
the fruit was fine, ârun upstairs and send Molly down. Sheâs putting Totty to
bed, and I want her to draw thâ ale, for Nancyâs busy yet iâ the dairy. You can
see to the child. But whativer did you let her run away from you along wiâ
Tommy for, and stuff herself wiâ fruit as she canât eat a bit oâ good victual?â

This was said in a lower tone than usual, while her husband was talking to
Adam; for Mrs. Poyser was strict in adherence to her own rules of propriety,
and she considered that a young girl was not to be treated sharply in the
presence of a respectable man who was courting her. That would not be
fair-play: every woman was young in her turn, and had her chances of matrimony,
which it was a point of honour for other women not to spoilâjust as one
market-woman who has sold her own eggs must not try to balk another of a
customer.

Hetty made haste to run away upstairs, not easily finding an answer to her
auntâs question, and Mrs. Poyser went out to see after Marty and Tommy and
bring them in to supper.

Soon they were all seatedâthe two rosy lads, one on each side, by the pale
mother, a place being left for Hetty between Adam and her uncle. Alick too was
come in, and was seated in his far corner, eating cold broad beans out of a
large dish with his pocket-knife, and finding a flavour in them which he would
not have exchanged for the finest pineapple.

âWhat a time that gell is drawing thâ ale, to be sure!â said Mrs. Poyser, when
she was dispensing her slices of stuffed chine. âI think she sets the jug under
and forgets to turn the tap, as thereâs nothing you canât believe oâ them
wenches: theyâll set the empty kettle oâ the fire, and then come an hour after
to see if the water boils.â

âSheâs drawinâ for the men too,â said Mr. Poyser. âThee shouldst haâ told her
to bring our jug up first.â

âTold her?â said Mrs. Poyser. âYes, I might spend all the wind iâ my body, anâ
take the bellows too, if I was to tell them gells everything as their own
sharpness wonna tell âem. Mr. Bede, will you take some vinegar with your
lettuce? Aye youâre iâ the right not. It spoils the flavour oâ the chine, to my
thinking. Itâs poor eating where the flavour oâ the meat lies iâ the cruets.
Thereâs folks as make bad butter and trusten to the salt tâ hide it.â

Mrs. Poyserâs attention was here diverted by the appearance of Molly, carrying
a large jug, two small mugs, and four drinking-cans, all full of ale or small
beerâan interesting example of the prehensile power possessed by the human
hand. Poor Mollyâs mouth was rather wider open than usual, as she walked along
with her eyes fixed on the double cluster of vessels in her hands, quite
innocent of the expression in her mistressâs eye.

âMolly, I niver knew your equilsâto think oâ your poor mother as is a widow,
anâ I took you wiâ as good as no character, anâ the times anâ times Iâve told
you....â

Molly had not seen the lightning, and the thunder shook her nerves the more for
the want of that preparation. With a vague alarmed sense that she must somehow
comport herself differently, she hastened her step a little towards the far
deal table, where she might set down her cansâcaught her foot in her apron,
which had become untied, and fell with a crash and a splash into a pool of
beer; whereupon a tittering explosion from Marty and Tommy, and a serious
âEllo!â from Mr. Poyser, who saw his draught of ale unpleasantly deferred.

âThere you go!â resumed Mrs. Poyser, in a cutting tone, as she rose and went
towards the cupboard while Molly began dolefully to pick up the fragments of
pottery. âItâs what I told you âud come, over and over again; and thereâs your
monthâs wage gone, and more, to pay for that jug as Iâve had iâ the house this
ten year, and nothing ever happened toât before; but the crockery youâve broke
sinâ here in thâ house youâve been âud make a parson swearâGod forgiâ me for
saying soâanâ if it had been boiling wort out oâ the copper, it âud haâ been
the same, and youâd haâ been scalded and very like lamed for life, as thereâs
no knowing but what you will be some day if you go on; for anybody âud think
youâd got the St. Vitusâs Dance, to see the things youâve throwed down. Itâs a
pity but what the bits was stacked up for you to see, though itâs neither
seeing nor hearing as âull make much odds to youâanybody âud think you war
case-hardened.â

Poor Mollyâs tears were dropping fast by this time, and in her desperation at
the lively movement of the beer-stream towards Alickâs legs, she was converting
her apron into a mop, while Mrs. Poyser, opening the cupboard, turned a
blighting eye upon her.

âAh,â she went on, âyouâll do no good wiâ crying anâ making more wet to wipe
up. Itâs all your own wilfulness, as I tell you, for thereâs nobody no call to
break anything if theyâll only go the right way to work. But wooden folks had
need haâ wooden things tâ handle. And here must I take the brown-and-white jug,
as itâs niver been used three times this year, and go down iâ the cellar
myself, and belike catch my death, and be laid up wiâ inflammation....â

Mrs. Poyser had turned round from the cupboard with the brown-and-white jug in
her hand, when she caught sight of something at the other end of the kitchen;
perhaps it was because she was already trembling and nervous that the
apparition had so strong an effect on her; perhaps jug-breaking, like other
crimes, has a contagious influence. However it was, she stared and started like
a ghost-seer, and the precious brown-and-white jug fell to the ground, parting
for ever with its spout and handle.

âDid ever anybody see the like?â she said, with a suddenly lowered tone, after
a momentâs bewildered glance round the room. âThe jugs are bewitched,
I

think. Itâs them nasty glazed handlesâthey slip oâer the finger like a snail.â

âWhy, theeâst let thy own whip fly iâ thy face,â said her husband, who had now
joined in the laugh of the young ones.

âItâs all very fine to look on and grin,â rejoined Mrs. Poyser; âbut thereâs
times when the crockery seems alive anâ flies out oâ your hand like a bird.
Itâs like the glass, sometimes, âull crack as it stands. What is to be broke

will
be broke, for I never dropped a thing iâ my life for want oâ
holding it, else I should never haâ kept the crockery all these âears as I
bought at my own wedding. And Hetty, are you mad? Whativer do you mean by
coming down iâ that way, and making one think as thereâs a ghost a-walking iâ
thâ house?â

A new outbreak of laughter, while Mrs. Poyser was speaking, was caused, less by
her sudden conversion to a fatalistic view of jug-breaking than by that strange
appearance of Hetty, which had startled her aunt. The little minx had found a
black gown of her auntâs, and pinned it close round her neck to look like
Dinahâs, had made her hair as flat as she could, and had tied on one of Dinahâs
high-crowned borderless net caps. The thought of Dinahâs pale grave face and
mild grey eyes, which the sight of the gown and cap brought with it, made it a
laughable surprise enough to see them replaced by Hettyâs round rosy cheeks and
coquettish dark eyes. The boys got off their chairs and jumped round her,
clapping their hands, and even Alick gave a low ventral laugh as he looked up
from his beans. Under cover of the noise, Mrs. Poyser went into the back
kitchen to send Nancy into the cellar with the great pewter measure, which had
some chance of being free from bewitchment.

âWhy, Hetty, lass, are ye turned Methodist?â said Mr. Poyser, with that
comfortable slow enjoyment of a laugh which one only sees in stout people. âYou
must pull your face a deal longer before youâll do for one; mustna she, Adam?
How come you put them things on, eh?â

âAdam said he liked Dinahâs cap and gown better nor my clothes,â said Hetty,
sitting down demurely. âHe says folks looks better in ugly clothes.â

âNay, nay,â said Adam, looking at her admiringly; âI only said they seemed to
suit Dinah. But if Iâd said youâd look pretty in âem, I should haâ said nothing
but what was true.â

âWhy, thee thoughtâst Hetty war a ghost, didstna?â said Mr. Poyser to his wife,
who now came back and took her seat again. âThee lookâdst as scared as scared.â

âIt little sinnifies how I looked,â said Mrs. Poyser; âlooks âull mend no jugs,
nor laughing neither, as I see. Mr. Bede, Iâm sorry youâve to wait so long for
your ale, but itâs coming in a minute. Make yourself at home wiâ thâ cold
potatoes: I know you like âem. Tommy, Iâll send you to bed this minute, if you
donât give over laughing. What is there to laugh at, I should like to know? Iâd
sooner cry nor laugh at the sight oâ that poor thingâs cap; and thereâs them as
âud be better if they could make theirselves like her iâ more ways nor putting
on her cap. It little becomes anybody iâ this house to make fun oâ my sisterâs
child, anâ her just gone away from us, as it went to my heart to part wiâ her.
Anâ I know one thing, as if trouble was to come, anâ I was to be laid up iâ my
bed, anâ the children was to dieâas thereâs no knowing but what they willâanâ
the murrain was to come among the cattle again, anâ everything went to rack anâ
ruin, I say we might be glad to get sight oâ Dinahâs cap again, wiâ her own
face under it, border or no border. For sheâs one oâ them things as looks the
brightest on a rainy day, and loves you the best when youâre most iâ need
onât.â

Mrs. Poyser, you perceive, was aware that nothing would be so likely to expel
the comic as the terrible. Tommy, who was of a susceptible disposition, and
very fond of his mother, and who had, besides, eaten so many cherries as to
have his feelings less under command than usual, was so affected by the
dreadful picture she had made of the possible future that he began to cry; and
the good-natured father, indulgent to all weaknesses but those of negligent
farmers, said to Hetty, âYouâd better take the things off again, my lass; it
hurts your aunt to see âem.â

Hetty went upstairs again, and the arrival of the ale made an agreeable
diversion; for Adam had to give his opinion of the new tap, which could not be
otherwise than complimentary to Mrs. Poyser; and then followed a discussion on
the secrets of good brewing, the folly of stinginess in âhopping,â and the
doubtful economy of a farmerâs making his own malt. Mrs. Poyser had so many
opportunities of expressing herself with weight on these subjects that by the
time supper was ended, the ale-jug refilled, and Mr. Poyserâs pipe alight she
was once more in high good humour, and ready, at Adamâs request, to fetch the
broken spinning-wheel for his inspection.

âAh,â said Adam, looking at it carefully, âhereâs a nice bit oâ turning wanted.
Itâs a pretty wheel. I must have it up at the turning-shop in the village and
do it there, for Iâve no convenence for turning at home. If youâll send it to
Mr. Burgeâs shop iâ the morning, Iâll get it done for you by Wednesday. Iâve
been turning it over in my mind,â he continued, looking at Mr. Poyser, âto make
a bit more convenence at home for nice jobs oâ cabinet-making. Iâve always done
a deal at such little things in odd hours, and theyâre profitable, for thereâs
more workmanship nor material in âem. I look for me and Seth to get a little
business for ourselves iâ that way, for I know a man at Rosseter as âull take
as many things as we should make, besides what we could get orders for round
about.â

Mr. Poyser entered with interest into a project which seemed a step towards
Adamâs becoming a âmaster-man,â and Mrs. Poyser gave her approbation to the
scheme of the movable kitchen cupboard, which was to be capable of containing
grocery, pickles, crockery, and house-linen in the utmost compactness without
confusion. Hetty, once more in her own dress, with her neckerchief pushed a
little backwards on this warm evening, was seated picking currants near the
window, where Adam could see her quite well. And so the time passed pleasantly
till Adam got up to go. He was pressed to come again soon, but not to stay
longer, for at this busy time sensible people would not run the risk of being
sleepy at five oâclock in the morning.

âI shall take a step farther,â said Adam, âand go on to see Mester Massey, for
he wasnât at church yesterday, and Iâve not seen him for a week past. Iâve
never hardly known him to miss church before.â

âAye,â said Mr. Poyser, âweâve heared nothing about him, for itâs the boysâ
hollodays now, so we can give you no account.â

âBut youâll niver think oâ going there at this hour oâ the night?â said Mrs.
Poyser, folding up her knitting.

âOh, Mester Massey sits up late,â said Adam. âAnâ the night-schoolâs not over
yet. Some oâ the men donât come till lateâtheyâve got so far to walk. And
Bartle himselfâs never in bed till itâs gone eleven.â

âI wouldna have him to live wiâ me, then,â said Mrs. Poyser, âa-dropping
candle-grease about, as youâre like to tumble down oâ the floor the first thing
iâ the morning.â

âAye, eleven oâclockâs lateâitâs late,â said old Martin. âI neâer sot up so iâ

my
life, not to say as it warna a marrâinâ, or a christeninâ, or a wake,
or thâ harvest supper. Eleven oâclockâs late.â

âWhy, I sit up till after twelve often,â said Adam, laughing, âbut it isnât tâ
eat and drink extry, itâs to work extry. Good-night, Mrs. Poyser; good-night,
Hetty.â

Hetty could only smile and not shake hands, for hers were dyed and damp with
currant-juice; but all the rest gave a hearty shake to the large palm that was
held out to them, and said, âCome again, come again!â

âAye, think oâ that now,â said Mr. Poyser, when Adam was out of on the
causeway. âSitting up till past twelve to do extry work! Yeâll not find many
men oâ six-anâ twenty as âull do to put iâ the shafts wiâ him. If you can catch
Adam for a husband, Hetty, youâll ride iâ your own spring-cart some day, Iâll
be your warrant.â

Hetty was moving across the kitchen with the currants, so her uncle did not see
the little toss of the head with which she answered him. To ride in a
spring-cart seemed a very miserable lot indeed to her now.

Chapter XXI

The Night-School and the Schoolmaster

Bartle Masseyâs was one of a few scattered houses on the edge of a common,
which was divided by the road to Treddleston. Adam reached it in a quarter of
an hour after leaving the Hall Farm; and when he had his hand on the
door-latch, he could see, through the curtainless window, that there were eight
or nine heads bending over the desks, lighted by thin dips.

When he entered, a reading lesson was going forward and Bartle Massey merely
nodded, leaving him to take his place where he pleased. He had not come for the
sake of a lesson to-night, and his mind was too full of personal matters, too
full of the last two hours he had passed in Hettyâs presence, for him to amuse
himself with a book till school was over; so he sat down in a corner and looked
on with an absent mind. It was a sort of scene which Adam had beheld almost
weekly for years; he knew by heart every arabesque flourish in the framed
specimen of Bartle Masseyâs handwriting which hung over the schoolmasterâs
head, by way of keeping a lofty ideal before the minds of his pupils; he knew
the backs of all the books on the shelf running along the whitewashed wall
above the pegs for the slates; he knew exactly how many grains were gone out of
the ear of Indian corn that hung from one of the rafters; he had long ago
exhausted the resources of his imagination in trying to think how the bunch of
leathery seaweed had looked and grown in its native element; and from the place
where he sat, he could make nothing of the old map of England that hung against
the opposite wall, for age had turned it of a fine yellow brown, something like
that of a well-seasoned meerschaum. The drama that was going on was almost as
familiar as the scene, nevertheless habit had not made him indifferent to it,
and even in his present self-absorbed mood, Adam felt a momentary stirring of
the old fellow-feeling, as he looked at the rough men painfully holding pen or
pencil with their cramped hands, or humbly labouring through their reading
lesson.

The reading class now seated on the form in front of the schoolmasterâs desk
consisted of the three most backward pupils. Adam would have known it only by
seeing Bartle Masseyâs face as he looked over his spectacles, which he had
shifted to the ridge of his nose, not requiring them for present purposes. The
face wore its mildest expression: the grizzled bushy eyebrows had taken their
more acute angle of compassionate kindness, and the mouth, habitually
compressed with a pout of the lower lip, was relaxed so as to be ready to speak
a helpful word or syllable in a moment. This gentle expression was the more
interesting because the schoolmasterâs nose, an irregular aquiline twisted a
little on one side, had rather a formidable character; and his brow, moreover,
had that peculiar tension which always impresses one as a sign of a keen
impatient temperament: the blue veins stood out like cords under the
transparent yellow skin, and this intimidating brow was softened by no tendency
to baldness, for the grey bristly hair, cut down to about an inch in length,
stood round it in as close ranks as ever.

âNay, Bill, nay,â Bartle was saying in a kind tone, as he nodded to Adam,
âbegin that again, and then perhaps, itâll come to you what d-r-y spells. Itâs
the same lesson you read last week, you know.â

âBillâ was a sturdy fellow, aged four-and-twenty, an excellent stone-sawyer,
who could get as good wages as any man in the trade of his years; but he found
a reading lesson in words of one syllable a harder matter to deal with than the
hardest stone he had ever had to saw. The letters, he complained, were so
âuncommon alike, there was no tellinâ âem one from another,â the sawyerâs
business not being concerned with minute differences such as exist between a
letter with its tail turned up and a letter with its tail turned down. But Bill
had a firm determination that he would learn to read, founded chiefly on two
reasons: first, that Tom Hazelow, his cousin, could read anything âright off,â
whether it was print or writing, and Tom had sent him a letter from twenty
miles off, saying how he was prospering in the world and had got an
overlookerâs place; secondly, that Sam Phillips, who sawed with him, had
learned to read when he was turned twenty, and what could be done by a little
fellow like Sam Phillips, Bill considered, could be done by himself, seeing
that he could pound Sam into wet clay if circumstances required it. So here he
was, pointing his big finger towards three words at once, and turning his head
on one side that he might keep better hold with his eye of the one word which
was to be discriminated out of the group. The amount of knowledge Bartle Massey
must possess was something so dim and vast that Billâs imagination recoiled
before it: he would hardly have ventured to deny that the schoolmaster might
have something to do in bringing about the regular return of daylight and the
changes in the weather.

The man seated next to Bill was of a very different type: he was a Methodist
brickmaker who, after spending thirty years of his life in perfect satisfaction
with his ignorance, had lately âgot religion,â and along with it the desire to
read the Bible. But with him, too, learning was a heavy business, and on his
way out to-night he had offered as usual a special prayer for help, seeing that
he had undertaken this hard task with a single eye to the nourishment of his
soulâthat he might have a greater abundance of texts and hymns wherewith to
banish evil memories and the temptations of old habitâor, in brief language,
the devil. For the brickmaker had been a notorious poacher, and was suspected,
though there was no good evidence against him, of being the man who had shot a
neighbouring gamekeeper in the leg. However that might be, it is certain that
shortly after the accident referred to, which was coincident with the arrival
of an awakening Methodist preacher at Treddleston, a great change had been
observed in the brickmaker; and though he was still known in the neighbourhood
by his old sobriquet of âBrimstone,â there was nothing he held in so much
horror as any further transactions with that evil-smelling element. He was a
broad-chested fellow with a fervid temperament, which helped him better in
imbibing religious ideas than in the dry process of acquiring the mere human
knowledge of the alphabet. Indeed, he had been already a little shaken in his
resolution by a brother Methodist, who assured him that the letter was a mere
obstruction to the Spirit, and expressed a fear that Brimstone was too eager
for the knowledge that puffeth up.

The third beginner was a much more promising pupil. He was a tall but thin and
wiry man, nearly as old as Brimstone, with a very pale face and hands stained a
deep blue. He was a dyer, who in the course of dipping homespun wool and old
womenâs petticoats had got fired with the ambition to learn a great deal more
about the strange secrets of colour. He had already a high reputation in the
district for his dyes, and he was bent on discovering some method by which he
could reduce the expense of crimsons and scarlets. The druggist at Treddleston
had given him a notion that he might save himself a great deal of labour and
expense if he could learn to read, and so he had begun to give his spare hours
to the night-school, resolving that his âlittle chapâ should lose no time in
coming to Mr. Masseyâs day-school as soon as he was old enough.

It was touching to see these three big men, with the marks of their hard labour
about them, anxiously bending over the worn books and painfully making out,
âThe grass is green,â âThe sticks are dry,â âThe corn is ripeââa very hard
lesson to pass to after columns of single words all alike except in the first
letter. It was almost as if three rough animals were making humble efforts to
learn how they might become human. And it touched the tenderest fibre in Bartle
Masseyâs nature, for such full-grown children as these were the only pupils for
whom he had no severe epithets and no impatient tones. He was not gifted with
an imperturbable temper, and on music-nights it was apparent that patience
could never be an easy virtue to him; but this evening, as he glances over his
spectacles at Bill Downes, the sawyer, who is turning his head on one side with
a desperate sense of blankness before the letters d-r-y, his eyes shed their
mildest and most encouraging light.

After the reading class, two youths between sixteen and nineteen came up with
the imaginary bills of parcels, which they had been writing out on their slates
and were now required to calculate âoff-handââa test which they stood with such
imperfect success that Bartle Massey, whose eyes had been glaring at them
ominously through his spectacles for some minutes, at length burst out in a
bitter, high-pitched tone, pausing between every sentence to rap the floor with
a knobbed stick which rested between his legs.

âNow, you see, you donât do this thing a bit better than you did a fortnight
ago, and Iâll tell you whatâs the reason. You want to learn accountsâthatâs
well and good. But you think all you need do to learn accounts is to come to me
and do sums for an hour or so, two or three times a-week; and no sooner do you
get your caps on and turn out of doors again than you sweep the whole thing
clean out of your mind. You go whistling about, and take no more care what
youâre thinking of than if your heads were gutters for any rubbish to swill
through that happened to be in the way; and if you get a good notion in âem,
itâs pretty soon washed out again. You think knowledge is to be got
cheapâyouâll come and pay Bartle Massey sixpence a-week, and heâll make you
clever at figures without your taking any trouble. But knowledge isnât to be
got with paying sixpence, let me tell you. If youâre to know figures, you must
turn âem over in your heads and keep your thoughts fixed on âem. Thereâs
nothing you canât turn into a sum, for thereâs nothing but whatâs got number in
itâeven a fool. You may say to yourselves, âIâm one fool, and Jackâs another;
if my foolâs head weighed four pound, and Jackâs three pound three ounces and
three quarters, how many pennyweights heavier would my head be than Jackâs?â A
man that had got his heart in learning figures would make sums for himself and
work âem in his head. When he sat at his shoemaking, heâd count his stitches by
fives, and then put a price on his stitches, say half a farthing, and then see
how much money he could get in an hour; and then ask himself how much money
heâd get in a day at that rate; and then how much ten workmen would get working
three, or twenty, or a hundred years at that rateâand all the while his needle
would be going just as fast as if he left his head empty for the devil to dance
in. But the long and the short of it isâIâll have nobody in my night-school
that doesnât strive to learn what he comes to learn, as hard as if he was
striving to get out of a dark hole into broad daylight. Iâll send no man away
because heâs stupid: if Billy Taft, the idiot, wanted to learn anything, Iâd
not refuse to teach him. But Iâll not throw away good knowledge on people who
think they can get it by the sixpennâorth, and carry it away with âem as they
would an ounce of snuff. So never come to me again, if you canât show that
youâve been working with your own heads, instead of thinking that you can pay
for mine to work for you. Thatâs the last word Iâve got to say to you.â

With this final sentence, Bartle Massey gave a sharper rap than ever with his
knobbed stick, and the discomfited lads got up to go with a sulky look. The
other pupils had happily only their writing-books to show, in various stages of
progress from pot-hooks to round text; and mere pen-strokes, however perverse,
were less exasperating to Bartle than false arithmetic. He was a little more
severe than usual on Jacob Storeyâs Zâs, of which poor Jacob had written a
pageful, all with their tops turned the wrong way, with a puzzled sense that
they were not right âsomehow.â But he observed in apology, that it was a letter
you never wanted hardly, and he thought it had only been there âto finish off
thâ alphabet, like, though ampusand (&) would haâ done as well, for what he
could see.â

At last the pupils had all taken their hats and said their âGood-nights,â and
Adam, knowing his old masterâs habits, rose and said, âShall I put the candles
out, Mr. Massey?â

âYes, my boy, yes, all but this, which Iâll carry into the house; and just lock
the outer door, now youâre near it,â said Bartle, getting his stick in the
fitting angle to help him in descending from his stool. He was no sooner on the
ground than it became obvious why the stick was necessaryâthe left leg was much
shorter than the right. But the school-master was so active with his lameness
that it was hardly thought of as a misfortune; and if you had seen him make his
way along the schoolroom floor, and up the step into his kitchen, you would
perhaps have understood why the naughty boys sometimes felt that his pace might
be indefinitely quickened and that he and his stick might overtake them even in
their swiftest run.

The moment he appeared at the kitchen door with the candle in his hand, a faint
whimpering began in the chimney-corner, and a brown-and-tan-coloured bitch, of
that wise-looking breed with short legs and long body, known to an unmechanical
generation as turnspits, came creeping along the floor, wagging her tail, and
hesitating at every other step, as if her affections were painfully divided
between the hamper in the chimney-corner and the master, whom she could not
leave without a greeting.

âWell, Vixen, well then, how are the babbies?â said the schoolmaster, making
haste towards the chimney-corner and holding the candle over the low hamper,
where two extremely blind puppies lifted up their heads towards the light from
a nest of flannel and wool. Vixen could not even see her master look at them
without painful excitement: she got into the hamper and got out again the next
moment, and behaved with true feminine folly, though looking all the while as
wise as a dwarf with a large old-fashioned head and body on the most
abbreviated legs.

âWhy, youâve got a family, I see, Mr. Massey?â said Adam, smiling, as he came
into the kitchen. âHowâs that? I thought it was against the law here.â

âLaw? Whatâs the use oâ law when a manâs once such a fool as to let a woman
into his house?â said Bartle, turning away from the hamper with some
bitterness. He always called Vixen a woman, and seemed to have lost all
consciousness that he was using a figure of speech. âIf Iâd known Vixen was a
woman, Iâd never have held the boys from drowning her; but when Iâd got her
into my hand, I was forced to take to her. And now you see what sheâs brought
me toâthe sly, hypocritical wenchââBartle spoke these last words in a rasping
tone of reproach, and looked at Vixen, who poked down her head and turned up
her eyes towards him with a keen sense of opprobriumââand contrived to be
brought to bed on a Sunday at church-time. Iâve wished again and again Iâd been
a bloody minded man, that I could have strangled the mother and the brats with
one cord.â

âIâm glad it was no worse a cause kept you from church,â said Adam. âI was
afraid you must be ill for the first time iâ your life. And I was particularly
sorry not to have you at church yesterday.â

âAh, my boy, I know why, I know why,â said Bartle kindly, going up to Adam and
raising his hand up to the shoulder that was almost on a level with his own
head. âYouâve had a rough bit oâ road to get over since I saw youâa rough bit
oâ road. But Iâm in hopes there are better times coming for you. Iâve got some
news to tell you. But I must get my supper first, for Iâm hungry, Iâm hungry.
Sit down, sit down.â

Bartle went into his little pantry, and brought out an excellent home-baked
loaf; for it was his one extravagance in these dear times to eat bread once
a-day instead of oat-cake; and he justified it by observing, that what a
schoolmaster wanted was brains, and oat-cake ran too much to bone instead of
brains. Then came a piece of cheese and a quart jug with a crown of foam upon
it. He placed them all on the round deal table which stood against his large
arm-chair in the chimney-corner, with Vixenâs hamper on one side of it and a
window-shelf with a few books piled up in it on the other. The table was as
clean as if Vixen had been an excellent housewife in a checkered apron; so was
the quarry floor; and the old carved oaken press, table, and chairs, which in
these days would be bought at a high price in aristocratic houses, though, in
that period of spider-legs and inlaid cupids, Bartle had got them for an old
song, were as free from dust as things could be at the end of a summerâs day.

âNow, then, my boy, draw up, draw up. Weâll not talk about business till weâve
had our supper. No man can be wise on an empty stomach. But,â said Bartle,
rising from his chair again, âI must give Vixen her supper too, confound her!
Though sheâll do nothing with it but nourish those unnecessary babbies. Thatâs
the way with these womenâtheyâve got no head-pieces to nourish, and so their
food all runs either to fat or to brats.â

He brought out of the pantry a dish of scraps, which Vixen at once fixed her
eyes on, and jumped out of her hamper to lick up with the utmost dispatch.

âIâve had my supper, Mr. Massey,â said Adam, âso Iâll look on while you eat
yours. Iâve been at the Hall Farm, and they always have their supper betimes,
you know: they donât keep your late hours.â

âI know little about their hours,â said Bartle dryly, cutting his bread and not
shrinking from the crust. âItâs a house I seldom go into, though Iâm fond of
the boys, and Martin Poyserâs a good fellow. Thereâs too many women in the
house for me: I hate the sound of womenâs voices; theyâre always either a-buzz
or a-squeakâalways either a-buzz or a-squeak. Mrs. Poyser keeps at the top oâ
the talk like a fife; and as for the young lasses, Iâd as soon look at
water-grubs. I know what theyâll turn toâstinging gnats, stinging gnats. Here,
take some ale, my boy: itâs been drawn for youâitâs been drawn for you.â

âNay, Mr. Massey,â said Adam, who took his old friendâs whim more seriously
than usual to-night, âdonât be so hard on the creaturs God has made to be
companions for us. A working-man âud be badly off without a wife to see to thâ
house and the victual, and make things clean and comfortable.â

âNonsense! Itâs the silliest lie a sensible man like you ever believed, to say
a woman makes a house comfortable. Itâs a story got up because the women are
there and something must be found for âem to do. I tell you there isnât a thing
under the sun that needs to be done at all, but what a man can do better than a
woman, unless itâs bearing children, and they do that in a poor make-shift way;
it had better haâ been left to the menâit had better haâ been left to the men.
I tell you, a woman âull bake you a pie every week of her life and never come
to see that the hotter thâ oven the shorter the time. I tell you, a woman âull
make your porridge every day for twenty years and never think of measuring the
proportion between the meal and the milkâa little more or less, sheâll think,
doesnât signify. The porridge
will
be awkâard now and then: if itâs
wrong, itâs summat in the meal, or itâs summat in the milk, or itâs summat in
the water. Look at me! I make my own bread, and thereâs no difference between
one batch and another from yearâs end to yearâs end; but if Iâd got any other
woman besides Vixen in the house, I must pray to the Lord every baking to give
me patience if the bread turned out heavy. And as for cleanliness, my house is
cleaner than any other house on the Common, though the half of âem swarm with
women. Will Bakerâs lad comes to help me in a morning, and we get as much
cleaning done in one hour, without any fuss, as a woman âud get done in three,
and all the while be sending buckets oâ water after your ankles, and let the
fender and the fire-irons stand in the middle oâ the floor half the day for you
to break your shins against âem. Donât tell me about God having made such
creatures to be companions for us! I donât say but He might make Eve to be a
companion to Adam in Paradiseâthere was no cooking to be spoilt there, and no
other woman to cackle with and make mischief, though you see what mischief she
did as soon as sheâd an opportunity. But itâs an impious, unscriptural opinion
to say a womanâs a blessing to a man now; you might as well say adders and
wasps, and foxes and wild beasts are a blessing, when theyâre only the evils
that belong to this state oâ probation, which itâs lawful for a man to keep as
clear of as he can in this life, hoping to get quit of âem for ever in
anotherâhoping to get quit of âem for ever in another.â

Bartle had become so excited and angry in the course of his invective that he
had forgotten his supper, and only used the knife for the purpose of rapping
the table with the haft. But towards the close, the raps became so sharp and
frequent, and his voice so quarrelsome, that Vixen felt it incumbent on her to
jump out of the hamper and bark vaguely.

âQuiet, Vixen!â snarled Bartle, turning round upon her. âYouâre like the rest
oâ the womenâalways putting in
your
word before you know why.â

Vixen returned to her hamper again in humiliation, and her master continued his
supper in a silence which Adam did not choose to interrupt; he knew the old man
would be in a better humour when he had had his supper and lighted his pipe.
Adam was used to hear him talk in this way, but had never learned so much of
Bartleâs past life as to know whether his view of married comfort was founded
on experience. On that point Bartle was mute, and it was even a secret where he
had lived previous to the twenty years in which happily for the peasants and
artisans of this neighbourhood he had been settled among them as their only
schoolmaster. If anything like a question was ventured on this subject, Bartle
always replied, âOh, Iâve seen many placesâIâve been a deal in the south,â and
the Loamshire men would as soon have thought of asking for a particular town or
village in Africa as in âthe south.â

âNow then, my boy,â said Bartle, at last, when he had poured out his second mug
of ale and lighted his pipe, ânow then, weâll have a little talk. But tell me
first, have you heard any particular news to-day?â

âNo,â said Adam, ânot as I remember.â

âAh, theyâll keep it close, theyâll keep it close, I daresay. But I found it
out by chance; and itâs news that may concern you, Adam, else Iâm a man that
donât know a superficial square foot from a solid.â

Here Bartle gave a series of fierce and rapid puffs, looking earnestly the
while at Adam. Your impatient loquacious man has never any notion of keeping
his pipe alight by gentle measured puffs; he is always letting it go nearly
out, and then punishing it for that negligence. At last he said, âSatchellâs
got a paralytic stroke. I found it out from the lad they sent to Treddleston
for the doctor, before seven oâclock this morning. Heâs a good way beyond
sixty, you know; itâs much if he gets over it.â

âWell,â said Adam, âI daresay thereâd be more rejoicing than sorrow in the
parish at his being laid up. Heâs been a selfish, tale-bearing, mischievous
fellow; but, after all, thereâs nobody heâs done so much harm to as to thâ old
squire. Though itâs the squire himself as is to blameâmaking a stupid fellow
like that a sort oâ man-of-all-work, just to save thâ expense of having a
proper steward to look after thâ estate. And heâs lost more by ill management
oâ the woods, Iâll be bound, than âud pay for two stewards. If heâs laid on the
shelf, itâs to be hoped heâll make way for a better man, but I donât see how
itâs like to make any difference to me.â

âBut I see it, but I see it,â said Bartle, âand others besides me. The
captainâs coming of age nowâyou know that as well as I doâand itâs to be
expected heâll have a little more voice in things. And I know, and you know
too, what âud be the captainâs wish about the woods, if there was a fair
opportunity for making a change. Heâs said in plenty of peopleâs hearing that
heâd make you manager of the woods to-morrow, if heâd the power. Why, Carroll,
Mr. Irwineâs butler, heard him say so to the parson not many days ago. Carroll
looked in when we were smoking our pipes oâ Saturday night at Cassonâs, and he
told us about it; and whenever anybody says a good word for you, the parsonâs
ready to back it, that Iâll answer for. It was pretty well talked over, I can
tell you, at Cassonâs, and one and another had their fling at you; for if
donkeys set to work to sing, youâre pretty sure what the tuneâll be.â

âWhy, did they talk it over before Mr. Burge?â said Adam; âor wasnât he there
oâ Saturday?â

âOh, he went away before Carroll came; and Cassonâheâs always for setting other
folks right, you knowâwould have it Burge was the man to have the management of
the woods. âA substantial man,â says he, âwith pretty near sixty yearsâ
experience oâ timber: it âud be all very well for Adam Bede to act under him,
but it isnât to be supposed the squire âud appoint a young fellow like Adam,
when thereâs his elders and betters at hand!â But I said, âThatâs a pretty
notion oâ yours, Casson. Why, Burge is the man to
buy
timber; would you
put the woods into his hands and let him make his own bargains? I think you
donât leave your customers to score their own drink, do you? And as for age,
what thatâs worth depends on the quality oâ the liquor. Itâs pretty well known
whoâs the backbone of Jonathan Burgeâs business.ââ

âI thank you for your good word, Mr. Massey,â said Adam. âBut, for all that,
Casson was partly iâ the right for once. Thereâs not much likelihood that thâ
old squire âud ever consent tâ employ me. I offended him about two years ago,
and heâs never forgiven me.â

âWhy, how was that? You never told me about it,â said Bartle.

âOh, it was a bit oâ nonsense. Iâd made a frame for a screen for Miss
Lyddyâsheâs allays making something with her worsted-work, you knowâand sheâd
given me particular orders about this screen, and there was as much talking and
measuring as if weâd been planning a house. However, it was a nice bit oâ work,
and I liked doing it for her. But, you know, those little friggling things take
a deal oâ time. I only worked at it in overhoursâoften late at nightâand I had
to go to Treddleston over anâ over again about little bits oâ brass nails and
such gear; and I turned the little knobs and the legs, and carved thâ open
work, after a pattern, as nice as could be. And I was uncommon pleased with it
when it was done. And when I took it home, Miss Lyddy sent for me to bring it
into her drawing-room, so as she might give me directions about fastening on
the workâvery fine needlework, Jacob and Rachel a-kissing one another among the
sheep, like a pictureâand thâ old squire was sitting there, for he mostly sits
with her. Well, she was mighty pleased with the screen, and then she wanted to
know what pay she was to give me. I didnât speak at randomâyou know itâs not my
way; Iâd calculated pretty close, though I hadnât made out a bill, and I said,
âOne pound thirteen.â That was paying for the materâals and paying me, but none
too much, for my work. Thâ old squire looked up at this, and peered in his way
at the screen, and said, âOne pound thirteen for a gimcrack like that! Lydia,
my dear, if you must spend money on these things, why donât you get them at
Rosseter, instead of paying double price for clumsy work here? Such things are
not work for a carpenter like Adam. Give him a guinea, and no more.â Well, Miss
Lyddy, I reckon, believed what he told her, and sheâs not overfond oâ parting
with the money herselfâsheâs not a bad woman at bottom, but sheâs been brought
up under his thumb; so she began fidgeting with her purse, and turned as red as
her ribbon. But I made a bow, and said, âNo, thank you, madam; Iâll make you a
present oâ the screen, if you please. Iâve charged the regular price for my
work, and I know itâs done well; and I know, begging His Honourâs pardon, that
you couldnât get such a screen at Rosseter under two guineas. Iâm willing to
give you my workâitâs been done in my own time, and nobodyâs got anything to do
with it but me; but if Iâm paid, I canât take a smaller price than I asked,
because that âud be like saying Iâd asked more than was just. With your leave,
madam, Iâll bid you good-morning.â I made my bow and went out before sheâd time
to say any more, for she stood with the purse in her hand, looking almost
foolish. I didnât mean to be disrespectful, and I spoke as polite as I could;
but I can give in to no man, if he wants to make it out as Iâm trying to
overreach him. And in the evening the footman brought me the one pound thirteen
wrapped in paper. But since then Iâve seen pretty clear as thâ old squire canât
abide me.â

âThatâs likely enough, thatâs likely enough,â said Bartle meditatively. âThe
only way to bring him round would be to show him what was for his own interest,
and that the captain may doâthat the captain may do.â

âNay, I donât know,â said Adam; âthe squireâs âcute enough but it takes
something else besides âcuteness to make folks see whatâll be their interest in
the long run. It takes some conscience and belief in right and wrong, I see
that pretty clear. Youâd hardly ever bring round thâ old squire to believe heâd
gain as much in a straightforâard way as by tricks and turns. And, besides,
Iâve not much mind to work under him: I donât want to quarrel with any
gentleman, more particular an old gentleman turned eighty, and I know we
couldnât agree long. If the captain was master oâ thâ estate, it âud be
different: heâs got a conscience and a will to do right, and Iâd sooner work
for him nor for any man living.â

âWell, well, my boy, if good luck knocks at your door, donât you put your head
out at window and tell it to be gone about its business, thatâs all. You must
learn to deal with odd and even in life, as well as in figures. I tell you now,
as I told you ten years ago, when you pommelled young Mike Holdsworth for
wanting to pass a bad shilling before you knew whether he was in jest or
earnestâyouâre overhasty and proud, and apt to set your teeth against folks
that donât square to your notions. Itâs no harm for me to be a bit fiery and
stiff-backedâIâm an old schoolmaster, and shall never want to get on to a
higher perch. But whereâs the use of all the time Iâve spent in teaching you
writing and mapping and mensuration, if youâre not to get forâard in the world
and show folks thereâs some advantage in having a head on your shoulders,
instead of a turnip? Do you mean to go on turning up your nose at every
opportunity because itâs got a bit of a smell about it that nobody finds out
but yourself? Itâs as foolish as that notion oâ yours that a wife is to make a
working-man comfortable. Stuff and nonsense! Stuff and nonsense! Leave that to
fools that never got beyond a sum in simple addition. Simple addition enough!
Add one fool to another fool, and in six yearsâ time six fools moreâtheyâre all
of the same denomination, big and littleâs nothing to do with the sum!â

During this rather heated exhortation to coolness and discretion the pipe had
gone out, and Bartle gave the climax to his speech by striking a light
furiously, after which he puffed with fierce resolution, fixing his eye still
on Adam, who was trying not to laugh.

âThereâs a good deal oâ sense in what you say, Mr. Massey,â Adam began, as soon
as he felt quite serious, âas there always is. But youâll give in that itâs no
business oâ mine to be building on chances that may never happen. What Iâve got
to do is to work as well as I can with the tools and materâals Iâve got in my
hands. If a good chance comes to me, Iâll think oâ what youâve been saying; but
till then, Iâve got nothing to do but to trust to my own hands and my own
head-piece. Iâm turning over a little plan for Seth and me to go into the
cabinet-making a bit by ourselves, and win a extra pound or two in that way.
But itâs getting late nowâitâll be pretty near eleven before Iâm at home, and
Mother may happen to lie awake; sheâs more fidgety nor usual now. So Iâll bid
you good-night.â

âWell, well, weâll go to the gate with youâitâs a fine night,â said Bartle,
taking up his stick. Vixen was at once on her legs, and without further words
the three walked out into the starlight, by the side of Bartleâs potato-beds,
to the little gate.

âCome to the music oâ Friday night, if you can, my boy,â said the old man, as
he closed the gate after Adam and leaned against it.

âAye, aye,â said Adam, striding along towards the streak of pale road. He was
the only object moving on the wide common. The two grey donkeys, just visible
in front of the gorse bushes, stood as still as limestone imagesâas still as
the grey-thatched roof of the mud cottage a little farther on. Bartle kept his
eye on the moving figure till it passed into the darkness, while Vixen, in a
state of divided affection, had twice run back to the house to bestow a
parenthetic lick on her puppies.

âAye, aye,â muttered the schoolmaster, as Adam disappeared, âthere you go,
stalking alongâstalking along; but you wouldnât have been what you are if you
hadnât had a bit of old lame Bartle inside you. The strongest calf must have
something to suck at. Thereâs plenty of these big, lumbering fellows âud never
have known their
A B C
if it hadnât been for Bartle Massey.
Well, well, Vixen, you foolish wench, what is it, what is it? I must go in,
must I? Aye, aye, Iâm never to have a will oâ my own any more. And those
pupsâwhat do you think Iâm to do with âem, when theyâre twice as big as you?
For Iâm pretty sure the father was that hulking bull-terrier of Will
Bakerâsâwasnât he now, eh, you sly hussy?â(Here Vixen tucked her tail between
her legs and ran forward into the house. Subjects are sometimes broached which
a well-bred female will ignore.)

âBut whereâs the use of talking to a woman with babbies?â continued Bartle.
âSheâs got no conscienceâno conscience; itâs all run to milk.â

Book Third

Chapter XXII

Going to the Birthday Feast

The thirtieth of July was come, and it was one of those half-dozen warm days
which sometimes occur in the middle of a rainy English summer. No rain had
fallen for the last three or four days, and the weather was perfect for that
time of the year: there was less dust than usual on the dark-green hedge-rows
and on the wild camomile that starred the roadside, yet the grass was dry
enough for the little children to roll on it, and there was no cloud but a long
dash of light, downy ripple, high, high up in the far-off blue sky. Perfect
weather for an outdoor July merry-making, yet surely not the best time of year
to be born in. Nature seems to make a hot pause just then: all the loveliest
flowers are gone; the sweet time of early growth and vague hopes is past; and
yet the time of harvest and ingathering is not come, and we tremble at the
possible storms that may ruin the precious fruit in the moment of its ripeness.
The woods are all one dark monotonous green; the waggon-loads of hay no longer
creep along the lanes, scattering their sweet-smelling fragments on the
blackberry branches; the pastures are often a little tanned, yet the corn has
not got its last splendour of red and gold; the lambs and calves have lost all
traces of their innocent frisky prettiness, and have become stupid young sheep
and cows. But it is a time of leisure on the farmâthat pause between hay-and
corn-harvest, and so the farmers and labourers in Hayslope and Broxton thought
the captain did well to come of age just then, when they could give their
undivided minds to the flavour of the great cask of ale which had been brewed
the autumn after âthe heirâ was born, and was to be tapped on his twenty-first
birthday. The air had been merry with the ringing of church-bells very early
this morning, and every one had made haste to get through the needful work
before twelve, when it would be time to think of getting ready to go to the
Chase.

The midday sun was streaming into Hettyâs bedchamber, and there was no blind to
temper the heat with which it fell on her head as she looked at herself in the
old specked glass. Still, that was the only glass she had in which she could
see her neck and arms, for the small hanging glass she had fetched out of the
next roomâthe room that had been Dinahâsâwould show her nothing below her
little chin; and that beautiful bit of neck where the roundness of her cheek
melted into another roundness shadowed by dark delicate curls. And to-day she
thought more than usual about her neck and arms; for at the dance this evening
she was not to wear any neckerchief, and she had been busy yesterday with her
spotted pink-and-white frock, that she might make the sleeves either long or
short at will. She was dressed now just as she was to be in the evening, with a
tucker made of ârealâ lace, which her aunt had lent her for this unparalleled
occasion, but with no ornaments besides; she had even taken out her small round
ear-rings which she wore every day. But there was something more to be done,
apparently, before she put on her neckerchief and long sleeves, which she was
to wear in the day-time, for now she unlocked the drawer that held her private
treasures. It is more than a month since we saw her unlock that drawer before,
and now it holds new treasures, so much more precious than the old ones that
these are thrust into the corner. Hetty would not care to put the large
coloured glass ear-rings into her ears now; for see! she has got a beautiful
pair of gold and pearls and garnet, lying snugly in a pretty little box lined
with white satin. Oh, the delight of taking out that little box and looking at
the ear-rings! Do not reason about it, my philosphical reader, and say that
Hetty, being very pretty, must have known that it did not signify whether she
had on any ornaments or not; and that, moreover, to look at ear-rings which she
could not possibly wear out of her bedroom could hardly be a satisfaction, the
essence of vanity being a reference to the impressions produced on others; you
will never understand womenâs natures if you are so excessively rational. Try
rather to divest yourself of all your rational prejudices, as much as if you
were studying the psychology of a canary bird, and only watch the movements of
this pretty round creature as she turns her head on one side with an
unconscious smile at the ear-rings nestled in the little box. Ah, you think, it
is for the sake of the person who has given them to her, and her thoughts are
gone back now to the moment when they were put into her hands. No; else why
should she have cared to have ear-rings rather than anything else? And I know
that she had longed for ear-rings from among all the ornaments she could
imagine.

âLittle, little ears!â Arthur had said, pretending to pinch them one evening,
as Hetty sat beside him on the grass without her hat. âI wish I had some pretty
ear-rings!â she said in a moment, almost before she knew what she was
sayingâthe wish lay so close to her lips, it
would
flutter past them at
the slightest breath. And the next dayâit was only last weekâArthur had ridden
over to Rosseter on purpose to buy them. That little wish so naively uttered
seemed to him the prettiest bit of childishness; he had never heard anything
like it before; and he had wrapped the box up in a great many covers, that he
might see Hetty unwrapping it with growing curiosity, till at last her eyes
flashed back their new delight into his.

No, she was not thinking most of the giver when she smiled at the ear-rings,
for now she is taking them out of the box, not to press them to her lips, but
to fasten them in her earsâonly for one moment, to see how pretty they look, as
she peeps at them in the glass against the wall, with first one position of the
head and then another, like a listening bird. It is impossible to be wise on
the subject of ear-rings as one looks at her; what should those delicate pearls
and crystals be made for, if not for such ears? One cannot even find fault with
the tiny round hole which they leave when they are taken out; perhaps
water-nixies, and such lovely things without souls, have these little round
holes in their ears by nature, ready to hang jewels in. And Hetty must be one
of them: it is too painful to think that she is a woman, with a womanâs destiny
before herâa woman spinning in young ignorance a light web of folly and vain
hopes which may one day close round her and press upon her, a rancorous
poisoned garment, changing all at once her fluttering, trivial butterfly
sensations into a life of deep human anguish.

But she cannot keep in the ear-rings long, else she may make her uncle and aunt
wait. She puts them quickly into the box again and shuts them up. Some day she
will be able to wear any ear-rings she likes, and already she lives in an
invisible world of brilliant costumes, shimmering gauze, soft satin, and
velvet, such as the ladyâs maid at the Chase has shown her in Miss Lydiaâs
wardrobe. She feels the bracelets on her arms, and treads on a soft carpet in
front of a tall mirror. But she has one thing in the drawer which she can
venture to wear to-day, because she can hang it on the chain of dark-brown
berries which she has been used to wear on grand days, with a tiny flat
scent-bottle at the end of it tucked inside her frock; and she
must
put
on her brown berriesâher neck would look so unfinished without it. Hetty was
not quite as fond of the locket as of the ear-rings, though it was a handsome
large locket, with enamelled flowers at the back and a beautiful gold border
round the glass, which showed a light-brown slightly waving lock, forming a
background for two little dark rings. She must keep it under her clothes, and
no one would see it. But Hetty had another passion, only a little less strong
than her love of finery, and that other passion made her like to wear the
locket even hidden in her bosom. She would always have worn it, if she had
dared to encounter her auntâs questions about a ribbon round her neck. So now
she slipped it on along her chain of dark-brown berries, and snapped the chain
round her neck. It was not a very long chain, only allowing the locket to hang
a little way below the edge of her frock. And now she had nothing to do but to
put on her long sleeves, her new white gauze neckerchief, and her straw hat
trimmed with white to-day instead of the pink, which had become rather faded
under the July sun. That hat made the drop of bitterness in Hettyâs cup to-day,
for it was not quite newâeverybody would see that it was a little tanned
against the white ribbonâand Mary Burge, she felt sure, would have a new hat or
bonnet on. She looked for consolation at her fine white cotton stockings: they
really were very nice indeed, and she had given almost all her spare money for
them. Hettyâs dream of the future could not make her insensible to triumph in
the present. To be sure, Captain Donnithorne loved her so that he would never
care about looking at other people, but then those other people didnât know how
he loved her, and she was not satisfied to appear shabby and insignificant in
their eyes even for a short space.

The whole party was assembled in the house-place when Hetty went down, all of
course in their Sunday clothes; and the bells had been ringing so this morning
in honour of the captainâs twenty-first birthday, and the work had all been got
done so early, that Marty and Tommy were not quite easy in their minds until
their mother had assured them that going to church was not part of the dayâs
festivities. Mr. Poyser had once suggested that the house should be shut up and
left to take care of itself; âfor,â said he, âthereâs no danger of anybodyâs
breaking inâeverybodyâll be at the Chase, thieves anâ all. If we lock thâ house
up, all the men can go: itâs a day they wonna see twice iâ their lives.â But
Mrs. Poyser answered with great decision: âI never left the house to take care
of itself since I was a missis, and I never will. Thereâs been ill-looking
tramps enooâ about the place this last week, to carry off every ham anâ every
spoon weân got; and they all collogue together, them tramps, as itâs a mercy
they hanna come and poisoned the dogs and murdered us all in our beds afore we
knowed, some Friday night when weân got the money in thâ house to pay the men.
And itâs like enough the tramps know where weâre going as well as we do
oursens; for if Old Harry wants any work done, you may be sure heâll find the
means.â

âNonsense about murdering us in our beds,â said Mr. Poyser; âIâve got a gun iâ
our room, hanna I? and theeâst got ears as âud find it out if a mouse was
gnawing the bacon. Howiver, if thee wouldstna be easy, Alick can stay at home
iâ the forepart oâ the day, and Tim can come back towârds five oâclock, and let
Alick have his turn. They may let Growler loose if anybody offers to do
mischief, and thereâs Alickâs dog too, ready enough to set his tooth in a tramp
if Alick gives him a wink.â

Mrs. Poyser accepted this compromise, but thought it advisable to bar and bolt
to the utmost; and now, at the last moment before starting, Nancy, the
dairy-maid, was closing the shutters of the house-place, although the window,
lying under the immediate observation of Alick and the dogs, might have been
supposed the least likely to be selected for a burglarious attempt.

The covered cart, without springs, was standing ready to carry the whole family
except the men-servants. Mr. Poyser and the grandfather sat on the seat in
front, and within there was room for all the women and children; the fuller the
cart the better, because then the jolting would not hurt so much, and Nancyâs
broad person and thick arms were an excellent cushion to be pitched on. But Mr.
Poyser drove at no more than a walking pace, that there might be as little risk
of jolting as possible on this warm day, and there was time to exchange
greetings and remarks with the foot-passengers who were going the same way,
specking the paths between the green meadows and the golden cornfields with
bits of movable bright colourâa scarlet waistcoat to match the poppies that
nodded a little too thickly among the corn, or a dark-blue neckerchief with
ends flaunting across a brand-new white smock-frock. All Broxton and all
Hayslope were to be at the Chase, and make merry there in honour of âthâ heirâ;
and the old men and women, who had never been so far down this side of the hill
for the last twenty years, were being brought from Broxton and Hayslope in one
of the farmerâs waggons, at Mr. Irwineâs suggestion. The church-bells had
struck up again nowâa last tune, before the ringers came down the hill to have
their share in the festival; and before the bells had finished, other music was
heard approaching, so that even Old Brown, the sober horse that was drawing Mr.
Poyserâs cart, began to prick up his ears. It was the band of the Benefit Club,
which had mustered in all its gloryâthat is to say, in bright-blue scarfs and
blue favours, and carrying its banner with the motto, âLet brotherly love
continue,â encircling a picture of a stone-pit.

The carts, of course, were not to enter the Chase. Every one must get down at
the lodges, and the vehicles must be sent back.

âWhy, the Chase is like a fair aâready,â said Mrs. Poyser, as she got down from
the cart, and saw the groups scattered under the great oaks, and the boys
running about in the hot sunshine to survey the tall poles surmounted by the
fluttering garments that were to be the prize of the successful climbers. âI
should haâ thought there wasna so many people iâ the two parishes. Mercy on us!
How hot it is out oâ the shade! Come here, Totty, else your little face âull be
burnt to a scratchinâ! They might haâ cooked the dinners iâ that open space anâ
saved the fires. I shall go to Mrs. Bestâs room anâ sit down.â

âStop a bit, stop a bit,â said Mr. Poyser. âThereâs thâ waggin coming wiâ thâ
old folks inât; itâll be such a sight as wonna come oâer again, to see âem get
down anâ walk along all together. You remember some on âem iâ their prime, eh,
Father?â

âAye, aye,â said old Martin, walking slowly under the shade of the lodge porch,
from which he could see the aged party descend. âI remember Jacob Taft walking
fifty mile after the Scotch raybels, when they turned back from Stoniton.â

He felt himself quite a youngster, with a long life before him, as he saw the
Hayslope patriarch, old Feyther Taft, descend from the waggon and walk towards
him, in his brown nightcap, and leaning on his two sticks.

âWell, Mester Taft,â shouted old Martin, at the utmost stretch of his voiceâfor
though he knew the old man was stone deaf, he could not omit the propriety of a
greetingââyouâre hearty yet. You can enjoy yoursen to-day, for-all youâre
ninety anâ better.â

âYour sarvant, mesters, your sarvant,â said Feyther Taft in a treble tone,
perceiving that he was in company.

The aged group, under care of sons or daughters, themselves worn and grey,
passed on along the least-winding carriage-road towards the house, where a
special table was prepared for them; while the Poyser party wisely struck
across the grass under the shade of the great trees, but not out of view of the
house-front, with its sloping lawn and flower-beds, or of the pretty striped
marquee at the edge of the lawn, standing at right angles with two larger
marquees on each side of the open green space where the games were to be
played. The house would have been nothing but a plain square mansion of Queen
Anneâs time, but for the remnant of an old abbey to which it was united at one
end, in much the same way as one may sometimes see a new farmhouse rising high
and prim at the end of older and lower farm-offices. The fine old remnant stood
a little backward and under the shadow of tall beeches, but the sun was now on
the taller and more advanced front, the blinds were all down, and the house
seemed asleep in the hot midday. It made Hetty quite sad to look at it: Arthur
must be somewhere in the back rooms, with the grand company, where he could not
possibly know that she was come, and she should not see him for a long, long
whileânot till after dinner, when they said he was to come up and make a
speech.

But Hetty was wrong in part of her conjecture. No grand company was come except
the Irwines, for whom the carriage had been sent early, and Arthur was at that
moment not in a back room, but walking with the rector into the broad stone
cloisters of the old abbey, where the long tables were laid for all the cottage
tenants and the farm-servants. A very handsome young Briton he looked to-day,
in high spirits and a bright-blue frock-coat, the highest modeâhis arm no
longer in a sling. So open-looking and candid, too; but candid people have
their secrets, and secrets leave no lines in young faces.

âUpon my word,â he said, as they entered the cool cloisters, âI think the
cottagers have the best of it: these cloisters make a delightful dining-room on
a hot day. That was capital advice of yours, Irwine, about the dinnersâto let
them be as orderly and comfortable as possible, and only for the tenants:
especially as I had only a limited sum after all; for though my grandfather
talked of a
carte blanche
, he couldnât make up his mind to trust me,
when it came to the point.â

âNever mind, youâll give more pleasure in this quiet way,â said Mr. Irwine. âIn
this sort of thing people are constantly confounding liberality with riot and
disorder. It sounds very grand to say that so many sheep and oxen were roasted
whole, and everybody ate who liked to come; but in the end it generally happens
that no one has had an enjoyable meal. If the people get a good dinner and a
moderate quantity of ale in the middle of the day, theyâll be able to enjoy the
games as the day cools. You canât hinder some of them from getting too much
towards evening, but drunkenness and darkness go better together than
drunkenness and daylight.â

âWell, I hope there wonât be much of it. Iâve kept the Treddleston people away
by having a feast for them in the town; and Iâve got Casson and Adam Bede and
some other good fellows to look to the giving out of ale in the booths, and to
take care things donât go too far. Come, let us go up above now and see the
dinner-tables for the large tenants.â

They went up the stone staircase leading simply to the long gallery above the
cloisters, a gallery where all the dusty worthless old pictures had been
banished for the last three generationsâmouldy portraits of Queen Elizabeth and
her ladies, General Monk with his eye knocked out, Daniel very much in the dark
among the lions, and Julius CÃ¦sar on horseback, with a high nose and laurel
crown, holding his Commentaries in his hand.

âWhat a capital thing it is that they saved this piece of the old abbey!â said
Arthur. âIf Iâm ever master here, I shall do up the gallery in first-rate
style. Weâve got no room in the house a third as large as this. That second
table is for the farmersâ wives and children: Mrs. Best said it would be more
comfortable for the mothers and children to be by themselves. I was determined
to have the children, and make a regular family thing of it. I shall be âthe
old squireâ to those little lads and lasses some day, and theyâll tell their
children what a much finer young fellow I was than my own son. Thereâs a table
for the women and children below as well. But you will see them allâyou will
come up with me after dinner, I hope?â

âYes, to be sure,â said Mr. Irwine. âI wouldnât miss your maiden speech to the
tenantry.â

âAnd there will be something else youâll like to hear,â said Arthur. âLet us go
into the library and Iâll tell you all about it while my grandfather is in the
drawing-room with the ladies. Something that will surprise you,â he continued,
as they sat down. âMy grandfather has come round after all.â

âWhat, about Adam?â

âYes; I should have ridden over to tell you about it, only I was so busy. You
know I told you I had quite given up arguing the matter with himâI thought it
was hopelessâbut yesterday morning he asked me to come in here to him before I
went out, and astonished me by saying that he had decided on all the new
arrangements he should make in consequence of old Satchell being obliged to lay
by work, and that he intended to employ Adam in superintending the woods at a
salary of a guinea a-week, and the use of a pony to be kept here. I believe the
secret of it is, he saw from the first it would be a profitable plan, but he
had some particular dislike of Adam to get overâand besides, the fact that I
propose a thing is generally a reason with him for rejecting it. Thereâs the
most curious contradiction in my grandfather: I know he means to leave me all
the money he has saved, and he is likely enough to have cut off poor Aunt
Lydia, who has been a slave to him all her life, with only five hundred a-year,
for the sake of giving me all the more; and yet I sometimes think he positively
hates me because Iâm his heir. I believe if I were to break my neck, he would
feel it the greatest misfortune that could befall him, and yet it seems a
pleasure to him to make my life a series of petty annoyances.â

âAh, my boy, it is not only womanâs love that is
ἀπέρωτος ἒρως as
old Ãschylus calls it. Thereâs plenty of âunloving loveâ in the world of a
masculine kind. But tell me about Adam. Has he accepted the post? I donât see
that it can be much more profitable than his present work, though, to be sure,
it will leave him a good deal of time on his own hands.â

âWell, I felt some doubt about it when I spoke to him and he seemed to hesitate
at first. His objection was that he thought he should not be able to satisfy my
grandfather. But I begged him as a personal favour to me not to let any reason
prevent him from accepting the place, if he really liked the employment and
would not be giving up anything that was more profitable to him. And he assured
me he should like it of all thingsâit would be a great step forward for him in
business, and it would enable him to do what he had long wished to do, to give
up working for Burge. He says he shall have plenty of time to superintend a
little business of his own, which he and Seth will carry on, and will perhaps
be able to enlarge by degrees. So he has agreed at last, and I have arranged
that he shall dine with the large tenants to-day; and I mean to announce the
appointment to them, and ask them to drink Adamâs health. Itâs a little drama
Iâve got up in honour of my friend Adam. Heâs a fine fellow, and I like the
opportunity of letting people know that I think so.â

âA drama in which friend Arthur piques himself on having a pretty part to
play,â said Mr. Irwine, smiling. But when he saw Arthur colour, he went on
relentingly, âMy part, you know, is always that of the old fogy who sees
nothing to admire in the young folks. I donât like to admit that Iâm proud of
my pupil when he does graceful things. But I must play the amiable old
gentleman for once, and second your toast in honour of Adam. Has your
grandfather yielded on the other point too, and agreed to have a respectable
man as steward?â

âOh no,â said Arthur, rising from his chair with an air of impatience and
walking along the room with his hands in his pockets. âHeâs got some project or
other about letting the Chase Farm and bargaining for a supply of milk and
butter for the house. But I ask no questions about itâit makes me too angry. I
believe he means to do all the business himself, and have nothing in the shape
of a steward. Itâs amazing what energy he has, though.â

âWell, weâll go to the ladies now,â said Mr. Irwine, rising too. âI want to
tell my mother what a splendid throne youâve prepared for her under the
marquee.â

âYes, and we must be going to luncheon too,â said Arthur. âIt must be two
oâclock, for there is the gong beginning to sound for the tenantsâ dinners.â

Chapter XXIII

Dinner-Time

When Adam heard that he was to dine upstairs with the large tenants, he felt
rather uncomfortable at the idea of being exalted in this way above his mother
and Seth, who were to dine in the cloisters below. But Mr. Mills, the butler,
assured him that Captain Donnithorne had given particular orders about it, and
would be very angry if Adam was not there.

Adam nodded and went up to Seth, who was standing a few yards off. âSeth, lad,â
he said, âthe captain has sent to say Iâm to dine upstairsâhe wishes it
particular, Mr. Mills says, so I suppose it âud be behaving ill for me not to
go. But I donât like sitting up above thee and mother, as if I was better than
my own flesh and blood. Theeât not take it unkind, I hope?â

âNay, nay, lad,â said Seth, âthy honourâs our honour; and if thee getâst
respect, theeâst won it by thy own deserts. The further I see thee above me,
the better, so long as thee feelâst like a brother to me. Itâs because oâ thy
being appointed over the woods, and itâs nothing but whatâs right. Thatâs a
place oâ trust, and theeât above a common workman now.â

âAye,â said Adam, âbut nobody knows a word about it yet. I havenât given notice
to Mr. Burge about leaving him, and I donât like to tell anybody else about it
before he knows, for heâll be a good bit hurt, I doubt. People âull be
wondering to see me there, and theyâll like enough be guessing the reason and
asking questions, for thereâs been so much talk up and down about my having the
place, this last three weeks.â

âWell, thee canst say thee wast ordered to come without being told the reason.
Thatâs the truth. And mother âull be fine and joyful about it. Letâs go and
tell her.â

Adam was not the only guest invited to come upstairs on other grounds than the
amount he contributed to the rent-roll. There were other people in the two
parishes who derived dignity from their functions rather than from their
pocket, and of these Bartle Massey was one. His lame walk was rather slower
than usual on this warm day, so Adam lingered behind when the bell rang for
dinner, that he might walk up with his old friend; for he was a little too shy
to join the Poyser party on this public occasion. Opportunities of getting to
Hettyâs side would be sure to turn up in the course of the day, and Adam
contented himself with that for he disliked any risk of being âjokedâ about
Hettyâthe big, outspoken, fearless man was very shy and diffident as to his
love-making.

âWell, Mester Massey,â said Adam, as Bartle came up âIâm going to dine upstairs
with you to-day: the captainâs sent me orders.â

âAh!â said Bartle, pausing, with one hand on his back. âThen thereâs something
in the windâthereâs something in the wind. Have you heard anything about what
the old squire means to do?â

âWhy, yes,â said Adam; âIâll tell you what I know, because I believe you can
keep a still tongue in your head if you like, and I hope youâll not let drop a
word till itâs common talk, for Iâve particular reasons against its being
known.â

âTrust to me, my boy, trust to me. Iâve got no wife to worm it out of me and
then run out and cackle it in everybodyâs hearing. If you trust a man, let him
be a bachelorâlet him be a bachelor.â

âWell, then, it was so far settled yesterday that Iâm to take the management oâ
the woods. The captain sent for me tâ offer it me, when I was seeing to the
poles and things here and Iâve agreed toât. But if anybody asks any questions
upstairs, just you take no notice, and turn the talk to something else, and
Iâll be obliged to you. Now, let us go on, for weâre pretty nigh the last, I
think.â

âI know what to do, never fear,â said Bartle, moving on. âThe news will be good
sauce to my dinner. Aye, aye, my boy, youâll get on. Iâll back you for an eye
at measuring and a head-piece for figures, against any man in this county and
youâve had good teachingâyouâve had good teaching.â

When they got upstairs, the question which Arthur had left unsettled, as to who
was to be president, and who vice, was still under discussion, so that Adamâs
entrance passed without remark.

âIt stands to sense,â Mr. Casson was saying, âas old Mr. Poyser, as is thâ
oldest man iâ the room, should sit at top oâ the table. I wasnât butler fifteen
year without learning the rights and the wrongs about dinner.â

âNay, nay,â said old Martin, âIân giâen up to my son; Iâm no tenant now: let my
son take my place. Thâ ould foulks haâ had their turn: they mun make way for
the young uns.â

âI should haâ thought the biggest tenant had the best right, more nor thâ
oldest,â said Luke Britton, who was not fond of the critical Mr. Poyser;
âthereâs Mester Holdsworth has more land nor anybody else on thâ estate.â

âWell,â said Mr. Poyser, âsuppose we say the man wiâ the foulest land shall sit
at top; then whoever gets thâ honour, thereâll be no envying on him.â

âEh, hereâs Mester Massey,â said Mr. Craig, who, being a neutral in the
dispute, had no interest but in conciliation; âthe schoolmaster ought to be
able to tell you whatâs right. Whoâs to sit at top oâ the table, Mr. Massey?â

âWhy, the broadest man,â said Bartle; âand then he wonât take up other folksâ
room; and the next broadest must sit at bottom.â

This happy mode of settling the dispute produced much laughterâa smaller joke
would have sufficed for that. Mr. Casson, however, did not feel it compatible
with his dignity and superior knowledge to join in the laugh, until it turned
out that he was fixed on as the second broadest man. Martin Poyser the younger,
as the broadest, was to be president, and Mr. Casson, as next broadest, was to
be vice.

Owing to this arrangement, Adam, being, of course, at the bottom of the table,
fell under the immediate observation of Mr. Casson, who, too much occupied with
the question of precedence, had not hitherto noticed his entrance. Mr. Casson,
we have seen, considered Adam ârather lifted up and peppery-likeâ: he thought
the gentry made more fuss about this young carpenter than was necessary; they
made no fuss about Mr. Casson, although he had been an excellent butler for
fifteen years.

âWell, Mr. Bede, youâre one oâ them as mounts hupâards apace,â he said, when
Adam sat down. âYouâve niver dined here before, as I remember.â

âNo, Mr. Casson,â said Adam, in his strong voice, that could be heard along the
table; âIâve never dined here before, but I come by Captain Donnithorneâs wish,
and I hope itâs not disagreeable to anybody here.â

âNay, nay,â said several voices at once, âweâre glad yeâre come. Whoâs got
anything to say againâ it?â

âAnd yeâll sing us âOver the hills and far away,â after dinner, wonna ye?â said
Mr. Chowne. âThatâs a song Iâm uncommon fond on.â

âPeeh!â said Mr. Craig; âitâs not to be named by side oâ the Scotch tunes. Iâve
never cared about singing myself; Iâve had something better to do. A man thatâs
got the names and the natur oâ plants inâs head isna likely to keep a hollow
place tâ hold tunes in. But a second cousin oâ mine, a drovier, was a rare hand
at remembering the Scotch tunes. Heâd got nothing else to think on.â

âThe Scotch tunes!â said Bartle Massey, contemptuously; âIâve heard enough oâ
the Scotch tunes to last me while I live. Theyâre fit for nothing but to
frighten the birds withâthatâs to say, the English birds, for the Scotch birds
may sing Scotch for what I know. Give the lads a bagpipe instead of a rattle,
and Iâll answer for it the corn âll be safe.â

âYes, thereâs folks as find a pleasure in undervallying what they know but
little about,â said Mr. Craig.

âWhy, the Scotch tunes are just like a scolding, nagging woman,â Bartle went
on, without deigning to notice Mr. Craigâs remark. âThey go on with the same
thing over and over again, and never come to a reasonable end. Anybody âud
think the Scotch tunes had always been asking a question of somebody as deaf as
old Taft, and had never got an answer yet.â

Adam minded the less about sitting by Mr. Casson, because this position enabled
him to see Hetty, who was not far off him at the next table. Hetty, however,
had not even noticed his presence yet, for she was giving angry attention to
Totty, who insisted on drawing up her feet on to the bench in antique fashion,
and thereby threatened to make dusty marks on Hettyâs pink-and-white frock. No
sooner were the little fat legs pushed down than up they came again, for
Tottyâs eyes were too busy in staring at the large dishes to see where the plum
pudding was for her to retain any consciousness of her legs. Hetty got quite
out of patience, and at last, with a frown and pout, and gathering tears, she
said, âOh dear, Aunt, I wish youâd speak to Totty; she keeps putting her legs
up so, and messing my frock.â

âWhatâs the matter wiâ the child? She can niver please you,â said the mother.
âLet her come by the side oâ me, then.
I
can put up wiâ her.â

Adam was looking at Hetty, and saw the frown, and pout, and the dark eyes
seeming to grow larger with pettish half-gathered tears. Quiet Mary Burge, who
sat near enough to see that Hetty was cross and that Adamâs eyes were fixed on
her, thought that so sensible a man as Adam must be reflecting on the small
value of beauty in a woman whose temper was bad. Mary was a good girl, not
given to indulge in evil feelings, but she said to herself, that, since Hetty
had a bad temper, it was better Adam should know it. And it was quite true that
if Hetty had been plain, she would have looked very ugly and unamiable at that
moment, and no oneâs moral judgment upon her would have been in the least
beguiled. But really there was something quite charming in her pettishness: it
looked so much more like innocent distress than ill humour; and the severe Adam
felt no movement of disapprobation; he only felt a sort of amused pity, as if
he had seen a kitten setting up its back, or a little bird with its feathers
ruffled. He could not gather what was vexing her, but it was impossible to him
to feel otherwise than that she was the prettiest thing in the world, and that
if he could have his way, nothing should ever vex her any more. And presently,
when Totty was gone, she caught his eye, and her face broke into one of its
brightest smiles, as she nodded to him. It was a bit of flirtationâshe knew
Mary Burge was looking at them. But the smile was like wine to Adam.

Chapter XXIV

The Health-Drinking

When the dinner was over, and the first draughts from the great cask of
birthday ale were brought up, room was made for the broad Mr. Poyser at the
side of the table, and two chairs were placed at the head. It had been settled
very definitely what Mr. Poyser was to do when the young squire should appear,
and for the last five minutes he had been in a state of abstraction, with his
eyes fixed on the dark picture opposite, and his hands busy with the loose cash
and other articles in his breeches pockets.

When the young squire entered, with Mr. Irwine by his side, every one stood up,
and this moment of homage was very agreeable to Arthur. He liked to feel his
own importance, and besides that, he cared a great deal for the good-will of
these people: he was fond of thinking that they had a hearty, special regard
for him. The pleasure he felt was in his face as he said, âMy grandfather and I
hope all our friends here have enjoyed their dinner, and find my birthday ale
good. Mr. Irwine and I are come to taste it with you, and I am sure we shall
all like anything the better that the rector shares with us.â

All eyes were now turned on Mr. Poyser, who, with his hands still busy in his
pockets, began with the deliberateness of a slow-striking clock. âCaptain, my
neighbours have put it upoâ me to speak for âem to-day, for where folks think
pretty much alike, one spokesmanâs as good as a score. And though weâve
mayhappen got contrairy ways oâ thinking about a many thingsâone man lays down
his land one way anâ another anotherâanâ Iâll not take it upon me to speak to
no manâs farming, but my ownâthis Iâll say, as weâre all oâ one mind about our
young squire. Weâve pretty nigh all on us known you when you war a little un,
anâ weâve niver known anything on you but what was good anâ honorable. You
speak fair anâ yâ act fair, anâ weâre joyful when we look forrard to your being
our landlord, for we âlieve you mean to do right by everybody, anâ âull make no
manâs bread bitter to him if you can help it. Thatâs what I mean, anâ thatâs
what we all mean; and when a manâs said what he means, heâd better stop, for
thâ ale âull be none the better for stanninâ. Anâ Iâll not say how we like thâ
ale yet, for we couldna well taste it till weâd drunk your health in it; but
the dinner was good, anâ if thereâs anybody hasna enjoyed it, it must be the
fault of his own inside. Anâ as for the rectorâs company, itâs well known as
thatâs welcome tâ all the parish wherever he may be; anâ I hope, anâ we all
hope, as heâll live to see us old folks, anâ our children grown to men anâ
women anâ Your Honour a family man. Iâve no more to say as concerns the present
time, anâ so weâll drink our young squireâs healthâthree times three.â

Hereupon a glorious shouting, a rapping, a jingling, a clattering, and a
shouting, with plentiful
da capo
, pleasanter than a strain of sublimest
music in the ears that receive such a tribute for the first time. Arthur had
felt a twinge of conscience during Mr. Poyserâs speech, but it was too feeble
to nullify the pleasure he felt in being praised. Did he not deserve what was
said of him on the whole? If there was something in his conduct that Poyser
wouldnât have liked if he had known it, why, no manâs conduct will bear too
close an inspection; and Poyser was not likely to know it; and, after all, what
had he done? Gone a little too far, perhaps, in flirtation, but another man in
his place would have acted much worse; and no harm would comeâno harm

should
come, for the next time he was alone with Hetty, he would explain
to her that she must not think seriously of him or of what had passed. It was
necessary to Arthur, you perceive, to be satisfied with himself. Uncomfortable
thoughts must be got rid of by good intentions for the future, which can be
formed so rapidly that he had time to be uncomfortable and to become easy again
before Mr. Poyserâs slow speech was finished, and when it was time for him to
speak he was quite light-hearted.

âI thank you all, my good friends and neighbours,â Arthur said, âfor the good
opinion of me, and the kind feelings towards me which Mr. Poyser has been
expressing on your behalf and on his own, and it will always be my heartiest
wish to deserve them. In the course of things we may expect that, if I live, I
shall one day or other be your landlord; indeed, it is on the ground of that
expectation that my grandfather has wished me to celebrate this day and to come
among you now; and I look forward to this position, not merely as one of power
and pleasure for myself, but as a means of benefiting my neighbours. It hardly
becomes so young a man as I am to talk much about farming to you, who are most
of you so much older, and are men of experience; still, I have interested
myself a good deal in such matters, and learned as much about them as my
opportunities have allowed; and when the course of events shall place the
estate in my hands, it will be my first desire to afford my tenants all the
encouragement a landlord can give them, in improving their land and trying to
bring about a better practice of husbandry. It will be my wish to be looked on
by all my deserving tenants as their best friend, and nothing would make me so
happy as to be able to respect every man on the estate, and to be respected by
him in return. It is not my place at present to enter into particulars; I only
meet your good hopes concerning me by telling you that my own hopes correspond
to themâthat what you expect from me I desire to fulfil; and I am quite of Mr.
Poyserâs opinion, that when a man has said what he means, he had better stop.
But the pleasure I feel in having my own health drunk by you would not be
perfect if we did not drink the health of my grandfather, who has filled the
place of both parents to me. I will say no more, until you have joined me in
drinking his health on a day when he has wished me to appear among you as the
future representative of his name and family.â

Perhaps there was no one present except Mr. Irwine who thoroughly understood
and approved Arthurâs graceful mode of proposing his grandfatherâs health. The
farmers thought the young squire knew well enough that they hated the old
squire, and Mrs. Poyser said, âheâd better not haâ stirred a kettle oâ sour
broth.â The bucolic mind does not readily apprehend the refinements of good
taste. But the toast could not be rejected and when it had been drunk, Arthur
said, âI thank you, both for my grandfather and myself; and now there is one
more thing I wish to tell you, that you may share my pleasure about it, as I
hope and believe you will. I think there can be no man here who has not a
respect, and some of you, I am sure, have a very high regard, for my friend
Adam Bede. It is well known to every one in this neighbourhood that there is no
man whose word can be more depended on than his; that whatever he undertakes to
do, he does well, and is as careful for the interests of those who employ him
as for his own. Iâm proud to say that I was very fond of Adam when I was a
little boy, and I have never lost my old feeling for himâI think that shows
that I know a good fellow when I find him. It has long been my wish that he
should have the management of the woods on the estate, which happen to be very
valuable, not only because I think so highly of his character, but because he
has the knowledge and the skill which fit him for the place. And I am happy to
tell you that it is my grandfatherâs wish too, and it is now settled that Adam
shall manage the woodsâa change which I am sure will be very much for the
advantage of the estate; and I hope you will by and by join me in drinking his
health, and in wishing him all the prosperity in life that he deserves. But
there is a still older friend of mine than Adam Bede present, and I need not
tell you that it is Mr. Irwine. Iâm sure you will agree with me that we must
drink no other personâs health until we have drunk his. I know you have all
reason to love him, but no one of his parishioners has so much reason as I.
Come, charge your glasses, and let us drink to our excellent rectorâthree times
three!â

This toast was drunk with all the enthusiasm that was wanting to the last, and
it certainly was the most picturesque moment in the scene when Mr. Irwine got
up to speak, and all the faces in the room were turned towards him. The
superior refinement of his face was much more striking than that of Arthurâs
when seen in comparison with the people round them. Arthurâs was a much
commoner British face, and the splendour of his new-fashioned clothes was more
akin to the young farmerâs taste in costume than Mr. Irwineâs powder and the
well-brushed but well-worn black, which seemed to be his chosen suit for great
occasions; for he had the mysterious secret of never wearing a new-looking
coat.

âThis is not the first time, by a great many,â he said, âthat I have had to
thank my parishioners for giving me tokens of their goodwill, but neighbourly
kindness is among those things that are the more precious the older they get.
Indeed, our pleasant meeting to-day is a proof that when what is good comes of
age and is likely to live, there is reason for rejoicing, and the relation
between us as clergyman and parishioners came of age two years ago, for it is
three-and-twenty years since I first came among you, and I see some tall
fine-looking young men here, as well as some blooming young women, that were
far from looking as pleasantly at me when I christened them as I am happy to
see them looking now. But Iâm sure you will not wonder when I say that among
all those young men, the one in whom I have the strongest interest is my friend
Mr. Arthur Donnithorne, for whom you have just expressed your regard. I had the
pleasure of being his tutor for several years, and have naturally had
opportunities of knowing him intimately which cannot have occurred to any one
else who is present; and I have some pride as well as pleasure in assuring you
that I share your high hopes concerning him, and your confidence in his
possession of those qualities which will make him an excellent landlord when
the time shall come for him to take that important position among you. We feel
alike on most matters on which a man who is getting towards fifty can feel in
common with a young man of one-and-twenty, and he has just been expressing a
feeling which I share very heartily, and I would not willingly omit the
opportunity of saying so. That feeling is his value and respect for Adam Bede.
People in a high station are of course more thought of and talked about and
have their virtues more praised, than those whose lives are passed in humble
everyday work; but every sensible man knows how necessary that humble everyday
work is, and how important it is to us that it should be done well. And I agree
with my friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne in feeling that when a man whose duty
lies in that sort of work shows a character which would make him an example in
any station, his merit should be acknowledged. He is one of those to whom
honour is due, and his friends should delight to honour him. I know Adam Bede
wellâI know what he is as a workman, and what he has been as a son and
brotherâand I am saying the simplest truth when I say that I respect him as
much as I respect any man living. But I am not speaking to you about a
stranger; some of you are his intimate friends, and I believe there is not one
here who does not know enough of him to join heartily in drinking his health.â

As Mr. Irwine paused, Arthur jumped up and, filling his glass, said, âA bumper
to Adam Bede, and may he live to have sons as faithful and clever as himself!â

No hearer, not even Bartle Massey, was so delighted with this toast as Mr.
Poyser. âTough workâ as his first speech had been, he would have started up to
make another if he had not known the extreme irregularity of such a course. As
it was, he found an outlet for his feeling in drinking his ale unusually fast,
and setting down his glass with a swing of his arm and a determined rap. If
Jonathan Burge and a few others felt less comfortable on the occasion, they
tried their best to look contented, and so the toast was drunk with a goodwill
apparently unanimous.

Adam was rather paler than usual when he got up to thank his friends. He was a
good deal moved by this public tributeâvery naturally, for he was in the
presence of all his little world, and it was uniting to do him honour. But he
felt no shyness about speaking, not being troubled with small vanity or lack of
words; he looked neither awkward nor embarrassed, but stood in his usual firm
upright attitude, with his head thrown a little backward and his hands
perfectly still, in that rough dignity which is peculiar to intelligent,
honest, well-built workmen, who are never wondering what is their business in
the world.

âIâm quite taken by surprise,â he said. âI didnât expect anything oâ this sort,
for itâs a good deal more than my wages. But Iâve the more reason to be
grateful to you, Captain, and to you, Mr. Irwine, and to all my friends here,
whoâve drunk my health and wished me well. It âud be nonsense for me to be
saying, I donât at all deserve thâ opinion you have of me; that âud be poor
thanks to you, to say that youâve known me all these years and yet havenât
sense enough to find out a great deal oâ the truth about me. You think, if I
undertake to do a bit oâ work, Iâll do it well, be my pay big or littleâand
thatâs true. Iâd be ashamed to stand before you here if it wasna true. But it
seems to me thatâs a manâs plain duty, and nothing to be conceited about, and
itâs pretty clear to me as Iâve never done more than my duty; for let us do
what we will, itâs only making use oâ the sperrit and the powers that haâ been
given to us. And so this kindness oâ yours, Iâm sure, is no debt you owe me,
but a free gift, and as such I accept it and am thankful. And as to this new
employment Iâve taken in hand, Iâll only say that I took it at Captain
Donnithorneâs desire, and that Iâll try to fulfil his expectations. Iâd wish
for no better lot than to work under him, and to know that while I was getting
my own bread I was taking care of his intârests. For I believe heâs one oâ
those gentlemen as wishes to do the right thing, and to leave the world a bit
better than he found it, which itâs my belief every man may do, whether heâs
gentle or simple, whether he sets a good bit oâ work going and finds the money,
or whether he does the work with his own hands. Thereâs no occasion for me to
say any more about what I feel towards him: I hope to show it through the rest
oâ my life in my actions.â

There were various opinions about Adamâs speech: some of the women whispered
that he didnât show himself thankful enough, and seemed to speak as proud as
could be; but most of the men were of opinion that nobody could speak more
straightforâard, and that Adam was as fine a chap as need to be. While such
observations were being buzzed about, mingled with wonderings as to what the
old squire meant to do for a bailiff, and whether he was going to have a
steward, the two gentlemen had risen, and were walking round to the table where
the wives and children sat. There was none of the strong ale here, of course,
but wine and dessertâsparkling gooseberry for the young ones, and some good
sherry for the mothers. Mrs. Poyser was at the head of this table, and Totty
was now seated in her lap, bending her small nose deep down into a wine-glass
in search of the nuts floating there.

âHow do you do, Mrs. Poyser?â said Arthur. âWerenât you pleased to hear your
husband make such a good speech to-day?â

âOh, sir, the men are mostly so tongue-tiedâyouâre forced partly to guess what
they mean, as you do wiâ the dumb creaturs.â

âWhat! you think you could have made it better for him?â said Mr. Irwine,
laughing.

âWell, sir, when I want to say anything, I can mostly find words to say it in,
thank God. Not as Iâm a-finding faut wiâ my husband, for if heâs a man oâ few
words, what he says heâll stand to.â

âIâm sure I never saw a prettier party than this,â Arthur said, looking round
at the apple-cheeked children. âMy aunt and the Miss Irwines will come up and
see you presently. They were afraid of the noise of the toasts, but it would be
a shame for them not to see you at table.â

He walked on, speaking to the mothers and patting the children, while Mr.
Irwine satisfied himself with standing still and nodding at a distance, that no
oneâs attention might be disturbed from the young squire, the hero of the day.
Arthur did not venture to stop near Hetty, but merely bowed to her as he passed
along the opposite side. The foolish child felt her heart swelling with
discontent; for what woman was ever satisfied with apparent neglect, even when
she knows it to be the mask of love? Hetty thought this was going to be the
most miserable day she had had for a long while, a moment of chill daylight and
reality came across her dream: Arthur, who had seemed so near to her only a few
hours before, was separated from her, as the hero of a great procession is
separated from a small outsider in the crowd.

Chapter XXV

The Games

The great dance was not to begin until eight oâclock, but for any lads and
lasses who liked to dance on the shady grass before then, there was music
always at handâfor was not the band of the Benefit Club capable of playing
excellent jigs, reels, and hornpipes? And, besides this, there was a grand band
hired from Rosseter, who, with their wonderful wind-instruments and puffed-out
cheeks, were themselves a delightful show to the small boys and girls. To say
nothing of Joshua Rannâs fiddle, which, by an act of generous forethought, he
had provided himself with, in case any one should be of sufficiently pure taste
to prefer dancing to a solo on that instrument.

Meantime, when the sun had moved off the great open space in front of the
house, the games began. There were, of course, well-soaped poles to be climbed
by the boys and youths, races to be run by the old women, races to be run in
sacks, heavy weights to be lifted by the strong men, and a long list of
challenges to such ambitious attempts as that of walking as many yards possible
on one legâfeats in which it was generally remarked that Wiry Ben, being âthe
lissomâst, springest fellow iâ the country,â was sure to be pre-eminent. To
crown all, there was to be a donkey-raceâthat sublimest of all races, conducted
on the grand socialistic idea of everybody encouraging everybody elseâs donkey,
and the sorriest donkey winning.

And soon after four oâclock, splendid old Mrs. Irwine, in her damask satin and
jewels and black lace, was led out by Arthur, followed by the whole family
party, to her raised seat under the striped marquee, where she was to give out
the prizes to the victors. Staid, formal Miss Lydia had requested to resign
that queenly office to the royal old lady, and Arthur was pleased with this
opportunity of gratifying his godmotherâs taste for stateliness. Old Mr.
Donnithorne, the delicately clean, finely scented, withered old man, led out
Miss Irwine, with his air of punctilious, acid politeness; Mr. Gawaine brought
Miss Lydia, looking neutral and stiff in an elegant peach-blossom silk; and Mr.
Irwine came last with his pale sister Anne. No other friend of the family,
besides Mr. Gawaine, was invited to-day; there was to be a grand dinner for the
neighbouring gentry on the morrow, but to-day all the forces were required for
the entertainment of the tenants.

There was a sunk fence in front of the marquee, dividing the lawn from the
park, but a temporary bridge had been made for the passage of the victors, and
the groups of people standing, or seated here and there on benches, stretched
on each side of the open space from the white marquees up to the sunk fence.

âUpon my word itâs a pretty sight,â said the old lady, in her deep voice, when
she was seated, and looked round on the bright scene with its dark-green
background; âand itâs the last fÃªte-day Iâm likely to see, unless you make
haste and get married, Arthur. But take care you get a charming bride, else I
would rather die without seeing her.â

âYouâre so terribly fastidious, Godmother,â said Arthur, âIâm afraid I should
never satisfy you with my choice.â

âWell, I wonât forgive you if sheâs not handsome. I canât be put off with
amiability, which is always the excuse people are making for the existence of
plain people. And she must not be silly; that will never do, because youâll
want managing, and a silly woman canât manage you. Who is that tall young man,
Dauphin, with the mild face? There, standing without his hat, and taking such
care of that tall old woman by the side of himâhis mother, of course. I like to
see that.â

âWhat, donât you know him, Mother?â said Mr. Irwine. âThat is Seth Bede, Adamâs
brotherâa Methodist, but a very good fellow. Poor Seth has looked rather
down-hearted of late; I thought it was because of his fatherâs dying in that
sad way, but Joshua Rann tells me he wanted to marry that sweet little
Methodist preacher who was here about a month ago, and I suppose she refused
him.â

âAh, I remember hearing about her. But there are no end of people here that I
donât know, for theyâre grown up and altered so since I used to go about.â

âWhat excellent sight you have!â said old Mr. Donnithorne, who was holding a
double glass up to his eyes, âto see the expression of that young manâs face so
far off. His face is nothing but a pale blurred spot to me. But I fancy I have
the advantage of you when we come to look close. I can read small print without
spectacles.â

âAh, my dear sir, you began with being very near-sighted, and those
near-sighted eyes always wear the best. I want very strong spectacles to read
with, but then I think my eyes get better and better for things at a distance.
I suppose if I could live another fifty years, I should be blind to everything
that wasnât out of other peopleâs sight, like a man who stands in a well and
sees nothing but the stars.â

âSee,â said Arthur, âthe old women are ready to set out on their race now.
Which do you bet on, Gawaine?â

âThe long-legged one, unless theyâre going to have several heats, and then the
little wiry one may win.â

âThere are the Poysers, Mother, not far off on the right hand,â said Miss
Irwine. âMrs. Poyser is looking at you. Do take notice of her.â

âTo be sure I will,â said the old lady, giving a gracious bow to Mrs. Poyser.
âA woman who sends me such excellent cream-cheese is not to be neglected. Bless
me! What a fat child that is she is holding on her knee! But who is that pretty
girl with dark eyes?â

âThat is Hetty Sorrel,â said Miss Lydia Donnithorne, âMartin Poyserâs nieceâa
very likely young person, and well-looking too. My maid has taught her fine
needlework, and she has mended some lace of mine very respectably indeedâvery
respectably.â

âWhy, she has lived with the Poysers six or seven years, Mother; you must have
seen her,â said Miss Irwine.

âNo, Iâve never seen her, childâat least not as she is now,â said Mrs. Irwine,
continuing to look at Hetty. âWell-looking, indeed! Sheâs a perfect beauty!
Iâve never seen anything so pretty since my young days. What a pity such beauty
as that should be thrown away among the farmers, when itâs wanted so terribly
among the good families without fortune! I daresay, now, sheâll marry a man who
would have thought her just as pretty if she had had round eyes and red hair.â

Arthur dared not turn his eyes towards Hetty while Mrs. Irwine was speaking of
her. He feigned not to hear, and to be occupied with something on the opposite
side. But he saw her plainly enough without looking; saw her in heightened
beauty, because he heard her beauty praisedâfor other menâs opinion, you know,
was like a native climate to Arthurâs feelings: it was the air on which they
thrived the best, and grew strong. Yes! She
was
enough to turn any manâs
head: any man in his place would have done and felt the same. And to give her
up after all, as he was determined to do, would be an act that he should always
look back upon with pride.

âNo, Mother,â and Mr. Irwine, replying to her last words; âI canât agree with
you there. The common people are not quite so stupid as you imagine. The
commonest man, who has his ounce of sense and feeling, is conscious of the
difference between a lovely, delicate woman and a coarse one. Even a dog feels
a difference in their presence. The man may be no better able than the dog to
explain the influence the more refined beauty has on him, but he feels it.â

âBless me, Dauphin, what does an old bachelor like you know about it?â

âOh, that is one of the matters in which old bachelors are wiser than married
men, because they have time for more general contemplation. Your fine critic of
woman must never shackle his judgment by calling one woman his own. But, as an
example of what I was saying, that pretty Methodist preacher I mentioned just
now told me that she had preached to the roughest miners and had never been
treated with anything but the utmost respect and kindness by them. The reason
isâthough she doesnât know itâthat thereâs so much tenderness, refinement, and
purity about her. Such a woman as that brings with her âairs from heavenâ that
the coarsest fellow is not insensible to.â

âHereâs a delicate bit of womanhood, or girlhood, coming to receive a prize, I
suppose,â said Mr. Gawaine. âShe must be one of the racers in the sacks, who
had set off before we came.â

The âbit of womanhoodâ was our old acquaintance Bessy Cranage, otherwise Chadâs
Bess, whose large red cheeks and blowsy person had undergone an exaggeration of
colour, which, if she had happened to be a heavenly body, would have made her
sublime. Bessy, I am sorry to say, had taken to her ear-rings again since
Dinahâs departure, and was otherwise decked out in such small finery as she
could muster. Any one who could have looked into poor Bessyâs heart would have
seen a striking resemblance between her little hopes and anxieties and Hettyâs.
The advantage, perhaps, would have been on Bessyâs side in the matter of
feeling. But then, you see, they were so very different outside! You would have
been inclined to box Bessyâs ears, and you would have longed to kiss Hetty.

Bessy had been tempted to run the arduous race, partly from mere hedonish
gaiety, partly because of the prize. Some one had said there were to be cloaks
and other nice clothes for prizes, and she approached the marquee, fanning
herself with her handkerchief, but with exultation sparkling in her round eyes.

âHere is the prize for the first sack-race,â said Miss Lydia, taking a large
parcel from the table where the prizes were laid and giving it to Mrs. Irwine
before Bessy came up, âan excellent grogram gown and a piece of flannel.â

âYou didnât think the winner was to be so young, I suppose, Aunt?â said Arthur.
âCouldnât you find something else for this girl, and save that grim-looking
gown for one of the older women?â

âI have bought nothing but what is useful and substantial,â said Miss Lydia,
adjusting her own lace; âI should not think of encouraging a love of finery in
young women of that class. I have a scarlet cloak, but that is for the old
woman who wins.â

This speech of Miss Lydiaâs produced rather a mocking expression in Mrs.
Irwineâs face as she looked at Arthur, while Bessy came up and dropped a series
of curtsies.

âThis is Bessy Cranage, mother,â said Mr. Irwine, kindly, âChad Cranageâs
daughter. You remember Chad Cranage, the blacksmith?â

âYes, to be sure,â said Mrs. Irwine. âWell, Bessy, here is your prizeâexcellent
warm things for winter. Iâm sure you have had hard work to win them this warm
day.â

Bessyâs lip fell as she saw the ugly, heavy gownâwhich felt so hot and
disagreeable too, on this July day, and was such a great ugly thing to carry.
She dropped her curtsies again, without looking up, and with a growing
tremulousness about the corners of her mouth, and then turned away.

âPoor girl,â said Arthur; âI think sheâs disappointed. I wish it had been
something more to her taste.â

âSheâs a bold-looking young person,â observed Miss Lydia. âNot at all one I
should like to encourage.â

Arthur silently resolved that he would make Bessy a present of money before the
day was over, that she might buy something more to her mind; but she, not aware
of the consolation in store for her, turned out of the open space, where she
was visible from the marquee, and throwing down the odious bundle under a tree,
began to cryâvery much tittered at the while by the small boys. In this
situation she was descried by her discreet matronly cousin, who lost no time in
coming up, having just given the baby into her husbandâs charge.

âWhatâs the matter wiâ ye?â said Bess the matron, taking up the bundle and
examining it. âYeân sweltered yoursen, I reckon, running that foolâs race. Anâ
here, theyân giâen you lots oâ good grogram and flannel, as should haâ been
giâen by good rights to them as had the sense to keep away from such foolery.
Ye might spare me a bit oâ this grogram to make clothes for the ladâye war
neâer ill-natured, Bess; I neâer said that on ye.â

âYe may take it all, for what I care,â said Bess the maiden, with a pettish
movement, beginning to wipe away her tears and recover herself.

âWell, I could do wiât, if so be ye want to get rid onât,â said the
disinterested cousin, walking quickly away with the bundle, lest Chadâs Bess
should change her mind.

But that bonny-cheeked lass was blessed with an elasticity of spirits that
secured her from any rankling grief; and by the time the grand climax of the
donkey-race came on, her disappointment was entirely lost in the delightful
excitement of attempting to stimulate the last donkey by hisses, while the boys
applied the argument of sticks. But the strength of the donkey mind lies in
adopting a course inversely as the arguments urged, which, well considered,
requires as great a mental force as the direct sequence; and the present donkey
proved the first-rate order of his intelligence by coming to a dead standstill
just when the blows were thickest. Great was the shouting of the crowd, radiant
the grinning of Bill Downes the stone-sawyer and the fortunate rider of this
superior beast, which stood calm and stiff-legged in the midst of its triumph.

Arthur himself had provided the prizes for the men, and Bill was made happy
with a splendid pocket-knife, supplied with blades and gimlets enough to make a
man at home on a desert island. He had hardly returned from the marquee with
the prize in his hand, when it began to be understood that Wiry Ben proposed to
amuse the company, before the gentry went to dinner, with an impromptu and
gratuitous performanceânamely, a hornpipe, the main idea of which was doubtless
borrowed; but this was to be developed by the dancer in so peculiar and complex
a manner that no one could deny him the praise of originality. Wiry Benâs pride
in his dancingâan accomplishment productive of great effect at the yearly
Wakeâhad needed only slightly elevating by an extra quantity of good ale to
convince him that the gentry would be very much struck with his performance of
his hornpipe; and he had been decidedly encouraged in this idea by Joshua Rann,
who observed that it was nothing but right to do something to please the young
squire, in return for what he had done for them. You will be the less surprised
at this opinion in so grave a personage when you learn that Ben had requested
Mr. Rann to accompany him on the fiddle, and Joshua felt quite sure that though
there might not be much in the dancing, the music would make up for it. Adam
Bede, who was present in one of the large marquees, where the plan was being
discussed, told Ben he had better not make a fool of himselfâa remark which at
once fixed Benâs determination: he was not going to let anything alone because
Adam Bede turned up his nose at it.

âWhatâs this, whatâs this?â said old Mr. Donnithorne. âIs it something youâve
arranged, Arthur? Hereâs the clerk coming with his fiddle, and a smart fellow
with a nosegay in his button-hole.â

âNo,â said Arthur; âI know nothing about it. By Jove, heâs going to dance! Itâs
one of the carpentersâI forget his name at this moment.â

âItâs Ben CranageâWiry Ben, they call him,â said Mr. Irwine; ârather a loose
fish, I think. Anne, my dear, I see that fiddle-scraping is too much for you:
youâre getting tired. Let me take you in now, that you may rest till dinner.â

Miss Anne rose assentingly, and the good brother took her away, while Joshuaâs
preliminary scrapings burst into the âWhite Cockade,â from which he intended to
pass to a variety of tunes, by a series of transitions which his good ear
really taught him to execute with some skill. It would have been an
exasperating fact to him, if he had known it, that the general attention was
too thoroughly absorbed by Benâs dancing for any one to give much heed to the
music.

Have you ever seen a real English rustic perform a solo dance? Perhaps you have
only seen a ballet rustic, smiling like a merry countryman in crockery, with
graceful turns of the haunch and insinuating movements of the head. That is as
much like the real thing as the âBird Waltzâ is like the song of birds. Wiry
Ben never smiled: he looked as serious as a dancing monkeyâas serious as if he
had been an experimental philosopher ascertaining in his own person the amount
of shaking and the varieties of angularity that could be given to the human
limbs.

To make amends for the abundant laughter in the striped marquee, Arthur clapped
his hands continually and cried âBravo!â But Ben had one admirer whose eyes
followed his movements with a fervid gravity that equalled his own. It was
Martin Poyser, who was seated on a bench, with Tommy between his legs.

âWhat dost think oâ that?â he said to his wife. âHe goes as pat to the music as
if he was made oâ clockwork. I used to be a pretty good un at dancing myself
when I was lighter, but I could niver haâ hit it just to thâ hair like that.â

âItâs little matter what his limbs are, to my thinking,â re-turned Mrs. Poyser.
âHeâs empty enough iâ the upper story, or heâd niver come jigging anâ stamping
iâ that way, like a mad grasshopper, for the gentry to look at him. Theyâre fit
to die wiâ laughing, I can see.â

âWell, well, so much the better, it amuses âem,â said Mr. Poyser, who did not
easily take an irritable view of things. âBut theyâre going away now, tâ have
their dinner, I reckon. Weâll move about a bit, shall we, and see what Adam
Bedeâs doing. Heâs got to look after the drinking and things: I doubt he hasna
had much fun.â

Chapter XXVI

The Dance

Arthur had chosen the entrance-hall for the ballroom: very wisely, for no other
room could have been so airy, or would have had the advantage of the wide doors
opening into the garden, as well as a ready entrance into the other rooms. To
be sure, a stone floor was not the pleasantest to dance on, but then, most of
the dancers had known what it was to enjoy a Christmas dance on kitchen
quarries. It was one of those entrance-halls which make the surrounding rooms
look like closetsâwith stucco angels, trumpets, and flower-wreaths on the lofty
ceiling, and great medallions of miscellaneous heroes on the walls, alternating
with statues in niches. Just the sort of place to be ornamented well with green
boughs, and Mr. Craig had been proud to show his taste and his hothouse plants
on the occasion. The broad steps of the stone staircase were covered with
cushions to serve as seats for the children, who were to stay till half-past
nine with the servant-maids to see the dancing, and as this dance was confined
to the chief tenants, there was abundant room for every one. The lights were
charmingly disposed in coloured-paper lamps, high up among green boughs, and
the farmersâ wives and daughters, as they peeped in, believed no scene could be
more splendid; they knew now quite well in what sort of rooms the king and
queen lived, and their thoughts glanced with some pity towards cousins and
acquaintances who had not this fine opportunity of knowing how things went on
in the great world. The lamps were already lit, though the sun had not long
set, and there was that calm light out of doors in which we seem to see all
objects more distinctly than in the broad day.

It was a pretty scene outside the house: the farmers and their families were
moving about the lawn, among the flowers and shrubs, or along the broad
straight road leading from the east front, where a carpet of mossy grass spread
on each side, studded here and there with a dark flat-boughed cedar, or a grand
pyramidal fir sweeping the ground with its branches, all tipped with a fringe
of paler green. The groups of cottagers in the park were gradually diminishing,
the young ones being attracted towards the lights that were beginning to gleam
from the windows of the gallery in the abbey, which was to be their
dancing-room, and some of the sober elder ones thinking it time to go home
quietly. One of these was Lisbeth Bede, and Seth went with herânot from filial
attention only, for his conscience would not let him join in dancing. It had
been rather a melancholy day to Seth: Dinah had never been more constantly
present with him than in this scene, where everything was so unlike her. He saw
her all the more vividly after looking at the thoughtless faces and
gay-coloured dresses of the young womenâjust as one feels the beauty and the
greatness of a pictured Madonna the more when it has been for a moment screened
from us by a vulgar head in a bonnet. But this presence of Dinah in his mind
only helped him to bear the better with his motherâs mood, which had been
becoming more and more querulous for the last hour. Poor Lisbeth was suffering
from a strange conflict of feelings. Her joy and pride in the honour paid to
her darling son Adam was beginning to be worsted in the conflict with the
jealousy and fretfulness which had revived when Adam came to tell her that
Captain Donnithorne desired him to join the dancers in the hall. Adam was
getting more and more out of her reach; she wished all the old troubles back
again, for then it mattered more to Adam what his mother said and did.

âEh, itâs fine talkinâ oâ dancinâ,â she said, âanâ thy father not a five week
inâs grave. Anâ I wish I war there too, iâstid oâ beinâ left to take up merrier
folksâs room above ground.â

âNay, donât look at it iâ that way, Mother,â said Adam, who was determined to
be gentle to her to-day. âI donât mean to danceâI shall only look on. And since
the captain wishes me to be there, it âud look as if I thought I knew better
than him to say as Iâd rather not stay. And thee knowâst how heâs behaved to me
to-day.â

âEh, theeât do as thee likâst, for thy old motherâs got no right tâ hinder
thee. Sheâs nought but thâ old husk, and theeâst slipped away from her, like
the ripe nut.â

âWell, Mother,â said Adam, âIâll go and tell the captain as it hurts thy
feelings for me to stay, and Iâd rather go home upoâ that account: he wonât
take it ill then, I daresay, and Iâm willing.â He said this with some effort,
for he really longed to be near Hetty this evening.

âNay, nay, I wonna haâ thee do thatâthe young squire âull be angered. Go anâ do
what theeât ordered to do, anâ me and Seth âull go whome. I know itâs a grit
honour for thee to be so looked onâanâ whoâs to be prouder on it nor thy
mother? Hadna she the cumber oâ rearinâ thee anâ doinâ for thee all these
âears?â

âWell, good-bye, then, Motherâgood-bye, ladâremember Gyp when you get home,â
said Adam, turning away towards the gate of the pleasure-grounds, where he
hoped he might be able to join the Poysers, for he had been so occupied
throughout the afternoon that he had had no time to speak to Hetty. His eye
soon detected a distant group, which he knew to be the right one, returning to
the house along the broad gravel road, and he hastened on to meet them.

âWhy, Adam, Iâm glad to get sight on yâ again,â said Mr. Poyser, who was
carrying Totty on his arm. âYouâre going tâ have a bit oâ fun, I hope, now your
workâs all done. And hereâs Hetty has promised no end oâ partners, anâ Iâve
just been askinâ her if sheâd agreed to dance wiâ you, anâ she says no.â

âWell, I didnât think oâ dancing to-night,â said Adam, already tempted to
change his mind, as he looked at Hetty.

âNonsense!â said Mr. Poyser. âWhy, everybodyâs goinâ to dance to-night, all but
thâ old squire and Mrs. Irwine. Mrs. Bestâs been tellinâ us as Miss Lyddy and
Miss Irwine âull dance, anâ the young squire âull pick my wife for his first
partner, tâ open the ball: so sheâll be forced to dance, though sheâs laid by
ever sinâ the Christmas afore the little un was born. You canna for shame stand
still, Adam, anâ you a fine young fellow and can dance as well as anybody.â

âNay, nay,â said Mrs. Poyser, âit âud be unbecominâ. I know the dancinâs
nonsense, but if you stick at everything because itâs nonsense, you wonna go
far iâ this life. When your brothâs ready-made for you, you mun swallow the
thickeninâ, or else let the broth alone.â

âThen if Hetty âull dance with me,â said Adam, yielding either to Mrs. Poyserâs
argument or to something else, âIâll dance whichever dance sheâs free.â

âIâve got no partner for the fourth dance,â said Hetty; âIâll dance that with
you, if you like.â

âAh,â said Mr. Poyser, âbut you mun dance the first dance, Adam, else itâll
look particâler. Thereâs plenty oâ nice partners to pick anâ choose from, anâ
itâs hard for the gells when the men stanâ by and donât ask âem.â

Adam felt the justice of Mr. Poyserâs observation: it would not do for him to
dance with no one besides Hetty; and remembering that Jonathan Burge had some
reason to feel hurt to-day, he resolved to ask Miss Mary to dance with him the
first dance, if she had no other partner.

âThereâs the big clock strikinâ eight,â said Mr. Poyser; âwe must make haste in
now, else the squire and the ladies âull be in afore us, anâ that wouldna look
well.â

When they had entered the hall, and the three children under Mollyâs charge had
been seated on the stairs, the folding-doors of the drawing-room were thrown
open, and Arthur entered in his regimentals, leading Mrs. Irwine to a
carpet-covered dais ornamented with hot-house plants, where she and Miss Anne
were to be seated with old Mr. Donnithorne, that they might look on at the
dancing, like the kings and queens in the plays. Arthur had put on his uniform
to please the tenants, he said, who thought as much of his militia dignity as
if it had been an elevation to the premiership. He had not the least objection
to gratify them in that way: his uniform was very advantageous to his figure.

The old squire, before sitting down, walked round the hall to greet the tenants
and make polite speeches to the wives: he was always polite; but the farmers
had found out, after long puzzling, that this polish was one of the signs of
hardness. It was observed that he gave his most elaborate civility to Mrs.
Poyser to-night, inquiring particularly about her health, recommending her to
strengthen herself with cold water as he did, and avoid all drugs. Mrs. Poyser
curtsied and thanked him with great self-command, but when he had passed on,
she whispered to her husband, âIâll lay my life heâs brewinâ some nasty turn
against us. Old Harry doesna wag his tail so for nothinâ.â Mr. Poyser had no
time to answer, for now Arthur came up and said, âMrs. Poyser, Iâm come to
request the favour of your hand for the first dance; and, Mr. Poyser, you must
let me take you to my aunt, for she claims you as her partner.â

The wifeâs pale cheek flushed with a nervous sense of unwonted honour as Arthur
led her to the top of the room; but Mr. Poyser, to whom an extra glass had
restored his youthful confidence in his good looks and good dancing, walked
along with them quite proudly, secretly flattering himself that Miss Lydia had
never had a partner in
her
life who could lift her off the ground as he
would. In order to balance the honours given to the two parishes, Miss Irwine
danced with Luke Britton, the largest Broxton farmer, and Mr. Gawaine led out
Mrs. Britton. Mr. Irwine, after seating his sister Anne, had gone to the abbey
gallery, as he had agreed with Arthur beforehand, to see how the merriment of
the cottagers was prospering. Meanwhile, all the less distinguished couples had
taken their places: Hetty was led out by the inevitable Mr. Craig, and Mary
Burge by Adam; and now the music struck up, and the glorious country-dance,
best of all dances, began.

Pity it was not a boarded floor! Then the rhythmic stamping of the thick shoes
would have been better than any drums. That merry stamping, that gracious
nodding of the head, that waving bestowal of the handâwhere can we see them
now? That simple dancing of well-covered matrons, laying aside for an hour the
cares of house and dairy, remembering but not affecting youth, not jealous but
proud of the young maidens by their sideâthat holiday sprightliness of portly
husbands paying little compliments to their wives, as if their courting days
were come againâthose lads and lasses a little confused and awkward with their
partners, having nothing to sayâit would be a pleasant variety to see all that
sometimes, instead of low dresses and large skirts, and scanning glances
exploring costumes, and languid men in lacquered boots smiling with double
meaning.

There was but one thing to mar Martin Poyserâs pleasure in this dance: it was
that he was always in close contact with Luke Britton, that slovenly farmer. He
thought of throwing a little glazed coldness into his eye in the crossing of
hands; but then, as Miss Irwine was opposite to him instead of the offensive
Luke, he might freeze the wrong person. So he gave his face up to hilarity,
unchilled by moral judgments.

How Hettyâs heart beat as Arthur approached her! He had hardly looked at her
to-day: now he
must
take her hand. Would he press it? Would he look at
her? She thought she would cry if he gave her no sign of feeling. Now he was
thereâhe had taken her handâyes, he was pressing it. Hetty turned pale as she
looked up at him for an instant and met his eyes, before the dance carried him
away. That pale look came upon Arthur like the beginning of a dull pain, which
clung to him, though he must dance and smile and joke all the same. Hetty would
look so, when he told her what he had to tell her; and he should never be able
to bear itâhe should be a fool and give way again. Hettyâs look did not really
mean so much as he thought: it was only the sign of a struggle between the
desire for him to notice her and the dread lest she should betray the desire to
others. But Hettyâs face had a language that transcended her feelings. There
are faces which nature charges with a meaning and pathos not belonging to the
single human soul that flutters beneath them, but speaking the joys and sorrows
of foregone generationsâeyes that tell of deep love which doubtless has been
and is somewhere, but not paired with these eyesâperhaps paired with pale eyes
that can say nothing; just as a national language may be instinct with poetry
unfelt by the lips that use it. That look of Hettyâs oppressed Arthur with a
dread which yet had something of a terrible unconfessed delight in it, that she
loved him too well. There was a hard task before him, for at that moment he
felt he would have given up three years of his youth for the happiness of
abandoning himself without remorse to his passion for Hetty.

These were the incongruous thoughts in his mind as he led Mrs. Poyser, who was
panting with fatigue, and secretly resolving that neither judge nor jury should
force her to dance another dance, to take a quiet rest in the dining-room,
where supper was laid out for the guests to come and take it as they chose.

âIâve desired Hetty to remember as sheâs got to dance wiâ you, sir,â said the
good innocent woman; âfor sheâs so thoughtless, sheâd be like enough to go anâ
engage herself for ivery dance. So I told her not to promise too many.â

âThank you, Mrs. Poyser,â said Arthur, not without a twinge. âNow, sit down in
this comfortable chair, and here is Mills ready to give you what you would like
best.â

He hurried away to seek another matronly partner, for due honour must be paid
to the married women before he asked any of the young ones; and the
country-dances, and the stamping, and the gracious nodding, and the waving of
the hands, went on joyously.

At last the time had come for the fourth danceâlonged for by the strong, grave
Adam, as if he had been a delicate-handed youth of eighteen; for we are all
very much alike when we are in our first love; and Adam had hardly ever touched
Hettyâs hand for more than a transient greetingâhad never danced with her but
once before. His eyes had followed her eagerly to-night in spite of himself,
and had taken in deeper draughts of love. He thought she behaved so prettily,
so quietly; she did not seem to be flirting at all, she smiled less than usual;
there was almost a sweet sadness about her. âGod bless her!â he said inwardly;
âIâd make her life a happy âun, if a strong arm to work for her, and a heart to
love her, could do it.â

And then there stole over him delicious thoughts of coming home from work, and
drawing Hetty to his side, and feeling her cheek softly pressed against his,
till he forgot where he was, and the music and the tread of feet might have
been the falling of rain and the roaring of the wind, for what he knew.

But now the third dance was ended, and he might go up to her and claim her
hand. She was at the far end of the hall near the staircase, whispering with
Molly, who had just given the sleeping Totty into her arms before running to
fetch shawls and bonnets from the landing. Mrs. Poyser had taken the two boys
away into the dining-room to give them some cake before they went home in the
cart with Grandfather and Molly was to follow as fast as possible.

âLet me hold her,â said Adam, as Molly turned upstairs; âthe children are so
heavy when theyâre asleep.â

Hetty was glad of the relief, for to hold Totty in her arms, standing, was not
at all a pleasant variety to her. But this second transfer had the unfortunate
effect of rousing Totty, who was not behind any child of her age in peevishness
at an unseasonable awaking. While Hetty was in the act of placing her in Adamâs
arms, and had not yet withdrawn her own, Totty opened her eyes, and forthwith
fought out with her left fist at Adamâs arm, and with her right caught at the
string of brown beads round Hettyâs neck. The locket leaped out from her frock,
and the next moment the string was broken, and Hetty, helpless, saw beads and
locket scattered wide on the floor.

âMy locket, my locket!â she said, in a loud frightened whisper to Adam; ânever
mind the beads.â

Adam had already seen where the locket fell, for it had attracted his glance as
it leaped out of her frock. It had fallen on the raised wooden dais where the
band sat, not on the stone floor; and as Adam picked it up, he saw the glass
with the dark and light locks of hair under it. It had fallen that side
upwards, so the glass was not broken. He turned it over on his hand, and saw
the enamelled gold back.

âIt isnât hurt,â he said, as he held it towards Hetty, who was unable to take
it because both her hands were occupied with Totty.

âOh, it doesnât matter, I donât mind about it,â said Hetty, who had been pale
and was now red.

âNot matter?â said Adam, gravely. âYou seemed very frightened about it. Iâll
hold it till youâre ready to take it,â he added, quietly closing his hand over
it, that she might not think he wanted to look at it again.

By this time Molly had come with bonnet and shawl, and as soon as she had taken
Totty, Adam placed the locket in Hettyâs hand. She took it with an air of
indifference and put it in her pocket, in her heart vexed and angry with Adam
because he had seen it, but determined now that she would show no more signs of
agitation.

âSee,â she said, âtheyâre taking their places to dance; let us go.â

Adam assented silently. A puzzled alarm had taken possession of him. Had Hetty
a lover he didnât know of? For none of her relations, he was sure, would give
her a locket like that; and none of her admirers, with whom he was acquainted,
was in the position of an accepted lover, as the giver of that locket must be.
Adam was lost in the utter impossibility of finding any person for his fears to
alight on. He could only feel with a terrible pang that there was something in
Hettyâs life unknown to him; that while he had been rocking himself in the hope
that she would come to love him, she was already loving another. The pleasure
of the dance with Hetty was gone; his eyes, when they rested on her, had an
uneasy questioning expression in them; he could think of nothing to say to her;
and she too was out of temper and disinclined to speak. They were both glad
when the dance was ended.

Adam was determined to stay no longer; no one wanted him, and no one would
notice if he slipped away. As soon as he got out of doors, he began to walk at
his habitual rapid pace, hurrying along without knowing why, busy with the
painful thought that the memory of this day, so full of honour and promise to
him, was poisoned for ever. Suddenly, when he was far on through the Chase, he
stopped, startled by a flash of reviving hope. After all, he might be a fool,
making a great misery out of a trifle. Hetty, fond of finery as she was, might
have bought the thing herself. It looked too expensive for thatâit looked like
the things on white satin in the great jewellerâs shop at Rosseter. But Adam
had very imperfect notions of the value of such things, and he thought it could
certainly not cost more than a guinea. Perhaps Hetty had had as much as that in
Christmas boxes, and there was no knowing but she might have been childish
enough to spend it in that way; she was such a young thing, and she couldnât
help loving finery! But then, why had she been so frightened about it at first,
and changed colour so, and afterwards pretended not to care? Oh, that was
because she was ashamed of his seeing that she had such a smart thingâshe was
conscious that it was wrong for her to spend her money on it, and she knew that
Adam disapproved of finery. It was a proof she cared about what he liked and
disliked. She must have thought from his silence and gravity afterwards that he
was very much displeased with her, that he was inclined to be harsh and severe
towards her foibles. And as he walked on more quietly, chewing the cud of this
new hope, his only uneasiness was that he had behaved in a way which might
chill Hettyâs feeling towards him. For this last view of the matter
must

be the true one. How could Hetty have an accepted lover, quite unknown to him?
She was never away from her uncleâs house for more than a day; she could have
no acquaintances that did not come there, and no intimacies unknown to her
uncle and aunt. It would be folly to believe that the locket was given to her
by a lover. The little ring of dark hair he felt sure was her own; he could
form no guess about the light hair under it, for he had not seen it very
distinctly. It might be a bit of her fatherâs or motherâs, who had died when
she was a child, and she would naturally put a bit of her own along with it.

And so Adam went to bed comforted, having woven for himself an ingenious web of
probabilitiesâthe surest screen a wise man can place between himself and the
truth. His last waking thoughts melted into a dream that he was with Hetty
again at the Hall Farm, and that he was asking her to forgive him for being so
cold and silent.

And while he was dreaming this, Arthur was leading Hetty to the dance and
saying to her in low hurried tones, âI shall be in the wood the day after
to-morrow at seven; come as early as you can.â And Hettyâs foolish joys and
hopes, which had flown away for a little space, scared by a mere nothing, now
all came fluttering back, unconscious of the real peril. She was happy for the
first time this long day, and wished that dance would last for hours. Arthur
wished it too; it was the last weakness he meant to indulge in; and a man never
lies with more delicious languor under the influence of a passion than when he
has persuaded himself that he shall subdue it to-morrow.

But Mrs. Poyserâs wishes were quite the reverse of this, for her mind was
filled with dreary forebodings as to the retardation of to-morrow morningâs
cheese in consequence of these late hours. Now that Hetty had done her duty and
danced one dance with the young squire, Mr. Poyser must go out and see if the
cart was come back to fetch them, for it was half-past ten oâclock, and
notwithstanding a mild suggestion on his part that it would be bad manners for
them to be the first to go, Mrs. Poyser was resolute on the point, âmanners or
no manners.â

âWhat! Going already, Mrs. Poyser?â said old Mr. Donnithorne, as she came to
curtsy and take leave; âI thought we should not part with any of our guests
till eleven. Mrs. Irwine and I, who are elderly people, think of sitting out
the dance till then.â

âOh, Your Honour, itâs all right and proper for gentlefolks to stay up by
candlelightâtheyâve got no cheese on their minds. Weâre late enough as it is,
anâ thereâs no lettinâ the cows know as they mustnât want to be milked so early
to-morrow morninâ. So, if youâll please tâ excuse us, weâll take our leave.â

âEh!â she said to her husband, as they set off in the cart, âIâd sooner haâ
brewinâ day and washinâ day together than one oâ these pleasurinâ days. Thereâs
no work so tirinâ as danglinâ about anâ starinâ anâ not rightly knowinâ what
youâre goinâ to do next; and keepinâ your face iâ smilinâ order like a grocer
oâ market-day for fear people shouldna think you civil enough. Anâ youâve
nothing to show forât when itâs done, if it isnât a yallow face wiâ eatinâ
things as disagree.â

âNay, nay,â said Mr. Poyser, who was in his merriest mood, and felt that he had
had a great day, âa bit oâ pleasuringâs good for thee sometimes. Anâ thee
dancâst as well as any of âem, for Iâll back thee against all the wives iâ the
parish for a light foot anâ ankle. Anâ it was a great honour for the young
squire to ask thee firstâI reckon it was because I sat at thâ head oâ the table
anâ made the speech. Anâ Hetty tooâ
she
never had such a partner beforeâa
fine young gentleman in regâmentals. Itâll serve you to talk on, Hetty, when
youâre an old womanâhow you danced wiâ thâ young squire the day he come oâ
age.â

Book Fourth

Chapter XXVII

A crisis

It was beyond the middle of Augustânearly three weeks after the birthday feast.
The reaping of the wheat had begun in our north midland county of Loamshire,
but the harvest was likely still to be retarded by the heavy rains, which were
causing inundations and much damage throughout the country. From this last
trouble the Broxton and Hayslope farmers, on their pleasant uplands and in
their brook-watered valleys, had not suffered, and as I cannot pretend that
they were such exceptional farmers as to love the general good better than
their own, you will infer that they were not in very low spirits about the
rapid rise in the price of bread, so long as there was hope of gathering in
their own corn undamaged; and occasional days of sunshine and drying winds
flattered this hope.

The eighteenth of August was one of these days when the sunshine looked
brighter in all eyes for the gloom that went before. Grand masses of cloud were
hurried across the blue, and the great round hills behind the Chase seemed
alive with their flying shadows; the sun was hidden for a moment, and then
shone out warm again like a recovered joy; the leaves, still green, were tossed
off the hedgerow trees by the wind; around the farmhouses there was a sound of
clapping doors; the apples fell in the orchards; and the stray horses on the
green sides of the lanes and on the common had their manes blown about their
faces. And yet the wind seemed only part of the general gladness because the
sun was shining. A merry day for the children, who ran and shouted to see if
they could top the wind with their voices; and the grown-up people too were in
good spirits, inclined to believe in yet finer days, when the wind had fallen.
If only the corn were not ripe enough to be blown out of the husk and scattered
as untimely seed!

And yet a day on which a blighting sorrow may fall upon a man. For if it be
true that Nature at certain moments seems charged with a presentiment of one
individual lot must it not also be true that she seems unmindful, unconscious
of another? For there is no hour that has not its births of gladness and
despair, no morning brightness that does not bring new sickness to desolation
as well as new forces to genius and love. There are so many of us, and our lots
are so different, what wonder that Natureâs mood is often in harsh contrast
with the great crisis of our lives? We are children of a large family, and must
learn, as such children do, not to expect that our hurts will be made much
ofâto be content with little nurture and caressing, and help each other the
more.

It was a busy day with Adam, who of late had done almost double work, for he
was continuing to act as foreman for Jonathan Burge, until some satisfactory
person could be found to supply his place, and Jonathan was slow to find that
person. But he had done the extra work cheerfully, for his hopes were buoyant
again about Hetty. Every time she had seen him since the birthday, she had
seemed to make an effort to behave all the more kindly to him, that she might
make him understand she had forgiven his silence and coldness during the dance.
He had never mentioned the locket to her again; too happy that she smiled at
himâstill happier because he observed in her a more subdued air, something that
he interpreted as the growth of womanly tenderness and seriousness. âAh!â he
thought, again and again, âsheâs only seventeen; sheâll be thoughtful enough
after a while. And her aunt allays says how clever she is at the work. Sheâll
make a wife as Motherâll have no occasion to grumble at, after all.â To be
sure, he had only seen her at home twice since the birthday; for one Sunday,
when he was intending to go from church to the Hall Farm, Hetty had joined the
party of upper servants from the Chase and had gone home with themâalmost as if
she were inclined to encourage Mr. Craig. âSheâs takinâ too much likinâ to them
folks iâ the housekeeperâs room,â Mrs. Poyser remarked. âFor my part, I was
never overfond oâ gentlefolksâs servantsâtheyâre mostly like the fine ladiesâ
fat dogs, nayther good for barking nor butcherâs meat, but onây for show.â And
another evening she was gone to Treddleston to buy some things; though, to his
great surprise, as he was returning home, he saw her at a distance getting over
a stile quite out of the Treddleston road. But, when he hastened to her, she
was very kind, and asked him to go in again when he had taken her to the yard
gate. She had gone a little farther into the fields after coming from
Treddleston because she didnât want to go in, she said: it was so nice to be
out of doors, and her aunt always made such a fuss about it if she wanted to go
out. âOh, do come in with me!â she said, as he was going to shake hands with
her at the gate, and he could not resist that. So he went in, and Mrs. Poyser
was contented with only a slight remark on Hettyâs being later than was
expected; while Hetty, who had looked out of spirits when he met her, smiled
and talked and waited on them all with unusual promptitude.

That was the last time he had seen her; but he meant to make leisure for going
to the Farm to-morrow. To-day, he knew, was her day for going to the Chase to
sew with the ladyâs maid, so he would get as much work done as possible this
evening, that the next might be clear.

One piece of work that Adam was superintending was some slight repairs at the
Chase Farm, which had been hitherto occupied by Satchell, as bailiff, but which
it was now rumoured that the old squire was going to let to a smart man in
top-boots, who had been seen to ride over it one day. Nothing but the desire to
get a tenant could account for the squireâs undertaking repairs, though the
Saturday-evening party at Mr. Cassonâs agreed over their pipes that no man in
his senses would take the Chase Farm unless there was a bit more ploughland
laid to it. However that might be, the repairs were ordered to be executed with
all dispatch, and Adam, acting for Mr. Burge, was carrying out the order with
his usual energy. But to-day, having been occupied elsewhere, he had not been
able to arrive at the Chase Farm till late in the afternoon, and he then
discovered that some old roofing, which he had calculated on preserving, had
given way. There was clearly no good to be done with this part of the building
without pulling it all down, and Adam immediately saw in his mind a plan for
building it up again, so as to make the most convenient of cow-sheds and
calf-pens, with a hovel for implements; and all without any great expense for
materials. So, when the workmen were gone, he sat down, took out his
pocket-book, and busied himself with sketching a plan, and making a
specification of the expenses that he might show it to Burge the next morning,
and set him on persuading the squire to consent. To âmake a good jobâ of
anything, however small, was always a pleasure to Adam, and he sat on a block,
with his book resting on a planing-table, whistling low every now and then and
turning his head on one side with a just perceptible smile of gratificationâof
pride, too, for if Adam loved a bit of good work, he loved also to think, âI
did it!â And I believe the only people who are free from that weakness are
those who have no work to call their own. It was nearly seven before he had
finished and put on his jacket again; and on giving a last look round, he
observed that Seth, who had been working here to-day, had left his basket of
tools behind him. âWhy, thâ ladâs forgot his tools,â thought Adam, âand heâs
got to work up at the shop to-morrow. There never was such a chap for
wool-gathering; heâd leave his head behind him, if it was loose. However, itâs
lucky Iâve seen âem; Iâll carry âem home.â

The buildings of the Chase Farm lay at one extremity of the Chase, at about ten
minutesâ walking distance from the Abbey. Adam had come thither on his pony,
intending to ride to the stables and put up his nag on his way home. At the
stables he encountered Mr. Craig, who had come to look at the captainâs new
horse, on which he was to ride away the day after to-morrow; and Mr. Craig
detained him to tell how all the servants were to collect at the gate of the
courtyard to wish the young squire luck as he rode out; so that by the time
Adam had got into the Chase, and was striding along with the basket of tools
over his shoulder, the sun was on the point of setting, and was sending level
crimson rays among the great trunks of the old oaks, and touching every bare
patch of ground with a transient glory that made it look like a jewel dropt
upon the grass. The wind had fallen now, and there was only enough breeze to
stir the delicate-stemmed leaves. Any one who had been sitting in the house all
day would have been glad to walk now; but Adam had been quite enough in the
open air to wish to shorten his way home, and he bethought himself that he
might do so by striking across the Chase and going through the Grove, where he
had never been for years. He hurried on across the Chase, stalking along the
narrow paths between the fern, with Gyp at his heels, not lingering to watch
the magnificent changes of the lightâhardly once thinking of itâyet feeling its
presence in a certain calm happy awe which mingled itself with his busy
working-day thoughts. How could he help feeling it? The very deer felt it, and
were more timid.

Presently Adamâs thoughts recurred to what Mr. Craig had said about Arthur
Donnithorne, and pictured his going away, and the changes that might take place
before he came back; then they travelled back affectionately over the old
scenes of boyish companionship, and dwelt on Arthurâs good qualities, which
Adam had a pride in, as we all have in the virtues of the superior who honours
us. A nature like Adamâs, with a great need of love and reverence in it,
depends for so much of its happiness on what it can believe and feel about
others! And he had no ideal world of dead heroes; he knew little of the life of
men in the past; he must find the beings to whom he could cling with loving
admiration among those who came within speech of him. These pleasant thoughts
about Arthur brought a milder expression than usual into his keen rough face:
perhaps they were the reason why, when he opened the old green gate leading
into the Grove, he paused to pat Gyp and say a kind word to him.

After that pause, he strode on again along the broad winding path through the
Grove. What grand beeches! Adam delighted in a fine tree of all things; as the
fishermanâs sight is keenest on the sea, so Adamâs perceptions were more at
home with trees than with other objects. He kept them in his memory, as a
painter does, with all the flecks and knots in their bark, all the curves and
angles of their boughs, and had often calculated the height and contents of a
trunk to a nicety, as he stood looking at it. No wonder that, not-withstanding
his desire to get on, he could not help pausing to look at a curious large
beech which he had seen standing before him at a turning in the road, and
convince himself that it was not two trees wedded together, but only one. For
the rest of his life he remembered that moment when he was calmly examining the
beech, as a man remembers his last glimpse of the home where his youth was
passed, before the road turned, and he saw it no more. The beech stood at the
last turning before the Grove ended in an archway of boughs that let in the
eastern light; and as Adam stepped away from the tree to continue his walk, his
eyes fell on two figures about twenty yards before him.

He remained as motionless as a statue, and turned almost as pale. The two
figures were standing opposite to each other, with clasped hands about to part;
and while they were bending to kiss, Gyp, who had been running among the
brushwood, came out, caught sight of them, and gave a sharp bark. They
separated with a startâone hurried through the gate out of the Grove, and the
other, turning round, walked slowly, with a sort of saunter, towards Adam who
still stood transfixed and pale, clutching tighter the stick with which he held
the basket of tools over his shoulder, and looking at the approaching figure
with eyes in which amazement was fast turning to fierceness.

Arthur Donnithorne looked flushed and excited; he had tried to make unpleasant
feelings more bearable by drinking a little more wine than usual at dinner
to-day, and was still enough under its flattering influence to think more
lightly of this unwished-for rencontre with Adam than he would otherwise have
done. After all, Adam was the best person who could have happened to see him
and Hetty togetherâhe was a sensible fellow, and would not babble about it to
other people. Arthur felt confident that he could laugh the thing off and
explain it away. And so he sauntered forward with elaborate carelessnessâhis
flushed face, his evening dress of fine cloth and fine linen, his hands
half-thrust into his waistcoat pockets, all shone upon by the strange evening
light which the light clouds had caught up even to the zenith, and were now
shedding down between the topmost branches above him.

Adam was still motionless, looking at him as he came up. He understood it all
nowâthe locket and everything else that had been doubtful to him: a terrible
scorching light showed him the hidden letters that changed the meaning of the
past. If he had moved a muscle, he must inevitably have sprung upon Arthur like
a tiger; and in the conflicting emotions that filled those long moments, he had
told himself that he would not give loose to passion, he would only speak the
right thing. He stood as if petrified by an unseen force, but the force was his
own strong will.

âWell, Adam,â said Arthur, âyouâve been looking at the fine old beeches, eh?
Theyâre not to be come near by the hatchet, though; this is a sacred grove. I
overtook pretty little Hetty Sorrel as I was coming to my denâthe Hermitage,
there. She ought not to come home this way so late. So I took care of her to
the gate, and asked for a kiss for my pains. But I must get back now, for this
road is confoundedly damp. Good-night, Adam. I shall see you to-morrowâto say
good-bye, you know.â

Arthur was too much preoccupied with the part he was playing himself to be
thoroughly aware of the expression in Adamâs face. He did not look directly at
Adam, but glanced carelessly round at the trees and then lifted up one foot to
look at the sole of his boot. He cared to say no moreâhe had thrown quite dust
enough into honest Adamâs eyesâand as he spoke the last words, he walked on.

âStop a bit, sir,â said Adam, in a hard peremptory voice, without turning
round. âIâve got a word to say to you.â

Arthur paused in surprise. Susceptible persons are more affected by a change of
tone than by unexpected words, and Arthur had the susceptibility of a nature at
once affectionate and vain. He was still more surprised when he saw that Adam
had not moved, but stood with his back to him, as if summoning him to return.
What did he mean? He was going to make a serious business of this affair.
Arthur felt his temper rising. A patronising disposition always has its meaner
side, and in the confusion of his irritation and alarm there entered the
feeling that a man to whom he had shown so much favour as to Adam was not in a
position to criticize his conduct. And yet he was dominated, as one who feels
himself in the wrong always is, by the man whose good opinion he cares for. In
spite of pride and temper, there was as much deprecation as anger in his voice
when he said, âWhat do you mean, Adam?â

âI mean, sirââanswered Adam, in the same harsh voice, still without turning
roundââI mean, sir, that you donât deceive me by your light words. This is not
the first time youâve met Hetty Sorrel in this grove, and this is not the first
time youâve kissed her.â

Arthur felt a startled uncertainty how far Adam was speaking from knowledge,
and how far from mere inference. And this uncertainty, which prevented him from
contriving a prudent answer, heightened his irritation. He said, in a high
sharp tone, âWell, sir, what then?â

âWhy, then, instead of acting like thâ upright, honourable man weâve all
believed you to be, youâve been acting the part of a selfish light-minded
scoundrel. You know as well as I do what itâs to lead to when a gentleman like
you kisses and makes love to a young woman like Hetty, and gives her presents
as sheâs frightened for other folks to see. And I say it again, youâre acting
the part of a selfish light-minded scoundrel though it cuts me to thâ heart to
say so, and Iâd rather haâ lost my right hand.â

âLet me tell you, Adam,â said Arthur, bridling his growing anger and trying to
recur to his careless tone, âyouâre not only devilishly impertinent, but youâre
talking nonsense. Every pretty girl is not such a fool as you, to suppose that
when a gentleman admires her beauty and pays her a little attention, he must
mean something particular. Every man likes to flirt with a pretty girl, and
every pretty girl likes to be flirted with. The wider the distance between
them, the less harm there is, for then sheâs not likely to deceive herself.â

âI donât know what you mean by flirting,â said Adam, âbut if you mean behaving
to a woman as if you loved her, and yet not loving her all the while, I say
thatâs not thâ action of an honest man, and what isnât honest does come tâ
harm. Iâm not a fool, and youâre not a fool, and you know better than what
youâre saying. You know it couldnât be made public as youâve behaved to Hetty
as yâ have done without her losing her character and bringing shame and trouble
on her and her relations. What if you meant nothing by your kissing and your
presents? Other folks wonât believe as youâve meant nothing; and donât tell me
about her not deceiving herself. I tell you as youâve filled her mind so with
the thought of you as itâll mayhap poison her life, and sheâll never love
another man as âud make her a good husband.â

Arthur had felt a sudden relief while Adam was speaking; he perceived that Adam
had no positive knowledge of the past, and that there was no irrevocable damage
done by this eveningâs unfortunate rencontre. Adam could still be deceived. The
candid Arthur had brought himself into a position in which successful lying was
his only hope. The hope allayed his anger a little.

âWell, Adam,â he said, in a tone of friendly concession, âyouâre perhaps right.
Perhaps Iâve gone a little too far in taking notice of the pretty little thing
and stealing a kiss now and then. Youâre such a grave, steady fellow, you donât
understand the temptation to such trifling. Iâm sure I wouldnât bring any
trouble or annoyance on her and the good Poysers on any account if I could help
it. But I think you look a little too seriously at it. You know Iâm going away
immediately, so I shanât make any more mistakes of the kind. But let us say
good-nightââArthur here turned round to walk onââand talk no more about the
matter. The whole thing will soon be forgotten.â

âNo, by God!â Adam burst out with rage that could be controlled no longer,
throwing down the basket of tools and striding forward till he was right in
front of Arthur. All his jealousy and sense of personal injury, which he had
been hitherto trying to keep under, had leaped up and mastered him. What man of
us, in the first moments of a sharp agony, could ever feel that the fellow-man
who has been the medium of inflicting it did not mean to hurt us? In our
instinctive rebellion against pain, we are children again, and demand an active
will to wreak our vengeance on. Adam at this moment could only feel that he had
been robbed of Hettyârobbed treacherously by the man in whom he had trustedâand
he stood close in front of Arthur, with fierce eyes glaring at him, with pale
lips and clenched hands, the hard tones in which he had hitherto been
constraining himself to express no more than a just indignation giving way to a
deep agitated voice that seemed to shake him as he spoke.

âNo, itâll not be soon forgot, as youâve come in between her and me, when she
might haâ loved meâitâll not soon be forgot as youâve robbed me oâ my
happiness, while I thought you was my best friend, and a noble-minded man, as I
was proud to work for. And youâve been kissing her, and meaning nothing, have
you? And I never kissed her iâ my lifeâbut Iâd haâ worked hard for years for
the right to kiss her. And you make light of it. You think little oâ doing what
may damage other folks, so as you get your bit oâ trifling, as means nothing. I
throw back your favours, for youâre not the man I took you for. Iâll never
count you my friend any more. Iâd rather youâd act as my enemy, and fight me
where I standâitâs all thâ amends you can make me.â

Poor Adam, possessed by rage that could find no other vent, began to throw off
his coat and his cap, too blind with passion to notice the change that had
taken place in Arthur while he was speaking. Arthurâs lips were now as pale as
Adamâs; his heart was beating violently. The discovery that Adam loved Hetty
was a shock which made him for the moment see himself in the light of Adamâs
indignation, and regard Adamâs suffering as not merely a consequence, but an
element of his error. The words of hatred and contemptâthe first he had ever
heard in his lifeâseemed like scorching missiles that were making ineffaceable
scars on him. All screening self-excuse, which rarely falls quite away while
others respect us, forsook him for an instant, and he stood face to face with
the first great irrevocable evil he had ever committed. He was only twenty-one,
and three months agoânay, much laterâhe had thought proudly that no man should
ever be able to reproach him justly. His first impulse, if there had been time
for it, would perhaps have been to utter words of propitiation; but Adam had no
sooner thrown off his coat and cap than he became aware that Arthur was
standing pale and motionless, with his hands still thrust in his waistcoat
pockets.

âWhat!â he said, âwonât you fight me like a man? You know I wonât strike you
while you stand so.â

âGo away, Adam,â said Arthur, âI donât want to fight you.â

âNo,â said Adam, bitterly; âyou donât want to fight meâyou think Iâm a common
man, as you can injure without answering for it.â

âI never meant to injure you,â said Arthur, with returning anger. âI didnât
know you loved her.â

âBut youâve made her love
you
,â said Adam. âYouâre a double-faced
manâIâll never believe a word you say again.â

âGo away, I tell you,â said Arthur, angrily, âor we shall both repent.â

âNo,â said Adam, with a convulsed voice, âI swear I wonât go away without
fighting you. Do you want provoking any more? I tell you youâre a coward and a
scoundrel, and I despise you.â

The colour had all rushed back to Arthurâs face; in a moment his right hand was
clenched, and dealt a blow like lightning, which sent Adam staggering backward.
His blood was as thoroughly up as Adamâs now, and the two men, forgetting the
emotions that had gone before, fought with the instinctive fierceness of
panthers in the deepening twilight darkened by the trees. The delicate-handed
gentleman was a match for the workman in everything but strength, and Arthurâs
skill enabled him to protract the struggle for some long moments. But between
unarmed men the battle is to the strong, where the strong is no blunderer, and
Arthur must sink under a well-planted blow of Adamâs as a steel rod is broken
by an iron bar. The blow soon came, and Arthur fell, his head lying concealed
in a tuft of fern, so that Adam could only discern his darkly clad body.

He stood still in the dim light waiting for Arthur to rise.

The blow had been given now, towards which he had been straining all the force
of nerve and muscleâand what was the good of it? What had he done by fighting?
Only satisfied his own passion, only wreaked his own vengeance. He had not
rescued Hetty, nor changed the pastâthere it was, just as it had been, and he
sickened at the vanity of his own rage.

But why did not Arthur rise? He was perfectly motionless, and the time seemed
long to Adam. Good God! had the blow been too much for him? Adam shuddered at
the thought of his own strength, as with the oncoming of this dread he knelt
down by Arthurâs side and lifted his head from among the fern. There was no
sign of life: the eyes and teeth were set. The horror that rushed over Adam
completely mastered him, and forced upon him its own belief. He could feel
nothing but that death was in Arthurâs face, and that he was helpless before
it. He made not a single movement, but knelt like an image of despair gazing at
an image of death.

Chapter XXVIII

A Dilemma

It was only a few minutes measured by the clockâthough Adam always thought it
had been a long whileâbefore he perceived a gleam of consciousness in Arthurâs
face and a slight shiver through his frame. The intense joy that flooded his
soul brought back some of the old affection with it.

âDo you feel any pain, sir?â he said, tenderly, loosening Arthurâs cravat.

Arthur turned his eyes on Adam with a vague stare which gave way to a slightly
startled motion as if from the shock of returning memory. But he only shivered
again and said nothing.

âDo you feel any hurt, sir?â Adam said again, with a trembling in his voice.

Arthur put his hand up to his waistcoat buttons, and when Adam had unbuttoned
it, he took a longer breath. âLay my head down,â he said, faintly, âand get me
some water if you can.â

Adam laid the head down gently on the fern again, and emptying the tools out of
the flag-basket, hurried through the trees to the edge of the Grove bordering
on the Chase, where a brook ran below the bank.

When he returned with his basket leaking, but still half-full, Arthur looked at
him with a more thoroughly reawakened consciousness.

âCan you drink a drop out oâ your hand, sir?â said Adam, kneeling down again to
lift up Arthurâs head.

âNo,â said Arthur, âdip my cravat in and souse it on my head.â

The water seemed to do him some good, for he presently raised himself a little
higher, resting on Adamâs arm.

âDo you feel any hurt inside sir?â Adam asked again

âNoâno hurt,â said Arthur, still faintly, âbut rather done up.â

After a while he said, âI suppose I fainted away when you knocked me down.â

âYes, sir, thank God,â said Adam. âI thought it was worse.â

âWhat! You thought youâd done for me, eh? Come help me on my legs.â

âI feel terribly shaky and dizzy,â Arthur said, as he stood leaning on Adamâs
arm; âthat blow of yours must have come against me like a battering-ram. I
donât believe I can walk alone.â

âLean on me, sir; Iâll get you along,â said Adam. âOr, will you sit down a bit
longer, on my coat here, and Iâll prop yâ up. Youâll perhaps be better in a
minute or two.â

âNo,â said Arthur. âIâll go to the HermitageâI think Iâve got some brandy
there. Thereâs a short road to it a little farther on, near the gate. If youâll
just help me on.â

They walked slowly, with frequent pauses, but without speaking again. In both
of them, the concentration in the present which had attended the first moments
of Arthurâs revival had now given way to a vivid recollection of the previous
scene. It was nearly dark in the narrow path among the trees, but within the
circle of fir-trees round the Hermitage there was room for the growing
moonlight to enter in at the windows. Their steps were noiseless on the thick
carpet of fir-needles, and the outward stillness seemed to heighten their
inward consciousness, as Arthur took the key out of his pocket and placed it in
Adamâs hand, for him to open the door. Adam had not known before that Arthur
had furnished the old Hermitage and made it a retreat for himself, and it was a
surprise to him when he opened the door to see a snug room with all the signs
of frequent habitation.

Arthur loosed Adamâs arm and threw himself on the ottoman. âYouâll see my
hunting-bottle somewhere,â he said. âA leather case with a bottle and glass
in.â

Adam was not long in finding the case. âThereâs very little brandy in it, sir,â
he said, turning it downwards over the glass, as he held it before the window;
âhardly this little glassful.â

âWell, give me that,â said Arthur, with the peevishness of physical depression.
When he had taken some sips, Adam said, âHadnât I better run to thâ house, sir,
and get some more brandy? I can be there and back pretty soon. Itâll be a stiff
walk home for you, if you donât have something to revive you.â

âYesâgo. But donât say Iâm ill. Ask for my man Pym, and tell him to get it from
Mills, and not to say Iâm at the Hermitage. Get some water too.â

Adam was relieved to have an active taskâboth of them were relieved to be apart
from each other for a short time. But Adamâs swift pace could not still the
eager pain of thinkingâof living again with concentrated suffering through the
last wretched hour, and looking out from it over all the new sad future.

Arthur lay still for some minutes after Adam was gone, but presently he rose
feebly from the ottoman and peered about slowly in the broken moonlight,
seeking something. It was a short bit of wax candle that stood amongst a
confusion of writing and drawing materials. There was more searching for the
means of lighting the candle, and when that was done, he went cautiously round
the room, as if wishing to assure himself of the presence or absence of
something. At last he had found a slight thing, which he put first in his
pocket, and then, on a second thought, took out again and thrust deep down into
a waste-paper basket. It was a womanâs little, pink, silk neckerchief. He set
the candle on the table, and threw himself down on the ottoman again, exhausted
with the effort.

When Adam came back with his supplies, his entrance awoke Arthur from a doze.

âThatâs right,â Arthur said; âIâm tremendously in want of some brandy-vigour.â

âIâm glad to see youâve got a light, sir,â said Adam. âIâve been thinking Iâd
better have asked for a lanthorn.â

âNo, no; the candle will last long enoughâI shall soon be up to walking home
now.â

âI canât go before Iâve seen you safe home, sir,â said Adam, hesitatingly.

âNo: it will be better for you to stayâsit down.â

Adam sat down, and they remained opposite to each other in uneasy silence,
while Arthur slowly drank brandy-and-water, with visibly renovating effect. He
began to lie in a more voluntary position, and looked as if he were less
overpowered by bodily sensations. Adam was keenly alive to these indications,
and as his anxiety about Arthurâs condition began to be allayed, he felt more
of that impatience which every one knows who has had his just indignation
suspended by the physical state of the culprit. Yet there was one thing on his
mind to be done before he could recur to remonstrance: it was to confess what
had been unjust in his own words. Perhaps he longed all the more to make this
confession, that his indignation might be free again; and as he saw the signs
of returning ease in Arthur, the words again and again came to his lips and
went back, checked by the thought that it would be better to leave everything
till to-morrow. As long as they were silent they did not look at each other,
and a foreboding came across Adam that if they began to speak as though they
remembered the pastâif they looked at each other with full recognitionâthey
must take fire again. So they sat in silence till the bit of wax candle
flickered low in the socket, the silence all the while becoming more irksome to
Adam. Arthur had just poured out some more brandy-and-water, and he threw one
arm behind his head and drew up one leg in an attitude of recovered ease, which
was an irresistible temptation to Adam to speak what was on his mind.

âYou begin to feel more yourself again, sir,â he said, as the candle went out
and they were half-hidden from each other in the faint moonlight.

âYes: I donât feel good for muchâvery lazy, and not inclined to move; but Iâll
go home when Iâve taken this dose.â

There was a slight pause before Adam said, âMy temper got the better of me, and
I said things as wasnât true. Iâd no right to speak as if youâd known you was
doing me an injury: youâd no grounds for knowing it; Iâve always kept what I
felt for her as secret as I could.â

He paused again before he went on.

âAnd perhaps I judged you too harshâIâm apt to be harshâand you may have acted
out oâ thoughtlessness more than I should haâ believed was possible for a man
with a heart and a conscience. Weâre not all put together alike, and we may
misjudge one another. God knows, itâs all the joy I could have now, to think
the best of you.â

Arthur wanted to go home without saying any moreâhe was too painfully
embarrassed in mind, as well as too weak in body, to wish for any further
explanation to-night. And yet it was a relief to him that Adam reopened the
subject in a way the least difficult for him to answer. Arthur was in the
wretched position of an open, generous man who has committed an error which
makes deception seem a necessity. The native impulse to give truth in return
for truth, to meet trust with frank confession, must be suppressed, and duty
was becoming a question of tactics. His deed was reacting upon himâwas already
governing him tyrannously and forcing him into a course that jarred with his
habitual feelings. The only aim that seemed admissible to him now was to
deceive Adam to the utmost: to make Adam think better of him than he deserved.
And when he heard the words of honest retractationâwhen he heard the sad appeal
with which Adam endedâhe was obliged to rejoice in the remains of ignorant
confidence it implied. He did not answer immediately, for he had to be
judicious and not truthful.

âSay no more about our anger, Adam,â he said, at last, very languidly, for the
labour of speech was unwelcome to him; âI forgive your momentary injusticeâit
was quite natural, with the exaggerated notions you had in your mind. We shall
be none the worse friends in future, I hope, because weâve fought. You had the
best of it, and that was as it should be, for I believe Iâve been most in the
wrong of the two. Come, let us shake hands.â

Arthur held out his hand, but Adam sat still.

âI donât like to say âNoâ to that, sir,â he said, âbut I canât shake hands till
itâs clear what we mean byât. I was wrong when I spoke as if youâd done me an
injury knowingly, but I wasnât wrong in what I said before, about your
behaviour tâ Hetty, and I canât shake hands with you as if I held you my friend
the same as ever till youâve cleared that up better.â

Arthur swallowed his pride and resentment as he drew back his hand. He was
silent for some moments, and then said, as indifferently as he could, âI donât
know what you mean by clearing up, Adam. Iâve told you already that you think
too seriously of a little flirtation. But if you are right in supposing there
is any danger in itâIâm going away on Saturday, and there will be an end of it.
As for the pain it has given you, Iâm heartily sorry for it. I can say no
more.â

Adam said nothing, but rose from his chair and stood with his face towards one
of the windows, as if looking at the blackness of the moonlit fir-trees; but he
was in reality conscious of nothing but the conflict within him. It was of no
use nowâhis resolution not to speak till to-morrow. He must speak there and
then. But it was several minutes before he turned round and stepped nearer to
Arthur, standing and looking down on him as he lay.

âItâll be better for me to speak plain,â he said, with evident effort, âthough
itâs hard work. You see, sir, this isnât a trifle to me, whatever it may be to
you. Iâm none oâ them men as can go making love first to one woman and then tâ
another, and donât think it much odds which of âem I take. What I feel for
Hettyâs a different sort oâ love, such as I believe nobody can know much about
but them as feel it and God as has given it to âem. Sheâs more nor everything
else to me, all but my conscience and my good name. And if itâs true what
youâve been saying all alongâand if itâs only been trifling and flirting as you
call it, as âll be put an end to by your going awayâwhy, then, Iâd wait, and
hope her heart âud turn to me after all. Iâm loath to think youâd speak false
to me, and Iâll believe your word, however things may look.â

âYou would be wronging Hetty more than me not to believe it,â said Arthur,
almost violently, starting up from the ottoman and moving away. But he threw
himself into a chair again directly, saying, more feebly, âYou seem to forget
that, in suspecting me, you are casting imputations upon her.â

âNay, sir,â Adam said, in a calmer voice, as if he were half-relievedâfor he
was too straightforward to make a distinction between a direct falsehood and an
indirect oneââNay, sir, things donât lie level between Hetty and you. Youâre
acting with your eyes open, whatever you may do; but how do you know whatâs
been in her mind? Sheâs all but a childâas any man with a conscience in him
ought to feel bound to take care on. And whatever you may think, I know youâve
disturbed her mind. I know sheâs been fixing her heart on you, for thereâs a
many things clear to me now as I didnât understand before. But you seem to make
light oâ what
she
may feelâyou donât think oâ that.â

âGood God, Adam, let me alone!â Arthur burst out impetuously; âI feel it enough
without your worrying me.â

He was aware of his indiscretion as soon as the words had escaped him.

âWell, then, if you feel it,â Adam rejoined, eagerly; âif you feel as you may
haâ put false notions into her mind, and made her believe as you loved her,
when all the while you meant nothing, Iâve this demand to make of youâIâm not
speaking for myself, but for her. I ask you tâ undeceive her before you go
away. Yâarenât going away for ever, and if you leave her behind with a notion
in her head oâ your feeling about her the same as she feels about you, sheâll
be hankering after you, and the mischief may get worse. It may be a smart to
her now, but itâll save her pain iâ thâ end. I ask you to write a letterâyou
may trust to my seeing as she gets it. Tell her the truth, and take blame to
yourself for behaving as youâd no right to do to a young woman as isnât your
equal. I speak plain, sir, but I canât speak any other way. Thereâs nobody can
take care oâ Hetty in this thing but me.â

âI can do what I think needful in the matter,â said Arthur, more and more
irritated by mingled distress and perplexity, âwithout giving promises to you.
I shall take what measures I think proper.â

âNo,â said Adam, in an abrupt decided tone, âthat wonât do. I must know what
ground Iâm treading on. I must be safe as youâve put an end to what ought never
to haâ been begun. I donât forget whatâs owing to you as a gentleman, but in
this thing weâre man and man, and I canât give up.â

There was no answer for some moments. Then Arthur said, âIâll see you
to-morrow. I can bear no more now; Iâm ill.â He rose as he spoke, and reached
his cap, as if intending to go.

âYou wonât see her again!â Adam exclaimed, with a flash of recurring anger and
suspicion, moving towards the door and placing his back against it. âEither
tell me she can never be my wifeâtell me youâve been lyingâor else promise me
what Iâve said.â

Adam, uttering this alternative, stood like a terrible fate before Arthur, who
had moved forward a step or two, and now stopped, faint, shaken, sick in mind
and body. It seemed long to both of themâthat inward struggle of
Arthurâsâbefore he said, feebly, âI promise; let me go.â

Adam moved away from the door and opened it, but when Arthur reached the step,
he stopped again and leaned against the door-post.

âYouâre not well enough to walk alone, sir,â said Adam. âTake my arm again.â

Arthur made no answer, and presently walked on, Adam following. But, after a
few steps, he stood still again, and said, coldly, âI believe I must trouble
you. Itâs getting late now, and there may be an alarm set up about me at home.â

Adam gave his arm, and they walked on without uttering a word, till they came
where the basket and the tools lay.

âI must pick up the tools, sir,â Adam said. âTheyâre my brotherâs. I doubt
theyâll be rusted. If youâll please to wait a minute.â

Arthur stood still without speaking, and no other word passed between them till
they were at the side entrance, where he hoped to get in without being seen by
any one. He said then, âThank you; I neednât trouble you any further.â

âWhat time will it be convenâent for me to see you to-morrow, sir?â said Adam.

âYou may send me word that youâre here at five oâclock,â said Arthur; ânot
before.â

âGood-night, sir,â said Adam. But he heard no reply; Arthur had turned into the
house.

Chapter XXIX

The Next Morning

Arthur did not pass a sleepless night; he slept long and well. For sleep comes
to the perplexedâif the perplexed are only weary enough. But at seven he rang
his bell and astonished Pym by declaring he was going to get up, and must have
breakfast brought to him at eight.

âAnd see that my mare is saddled at half-past eight, and tell my grandfather
when heâs down that Iâm better this morning and am gone for a ride.â

He had been awake an hour, and could rest in bed no longer. In bed our
yesterdays are too oppressive: if a man can only get up, though it be but to
whistle or to smoke, he has a present which offers some resistance to the
pastâsensations which assert themselves against tyrannous memories. And if
there were such a thing as taking averages of feeling, it would certainly be
found that in the hunting and shooting seasons regret, self-reproach, and
mortified pride weigh lighter on country gentlemen than in late spring and
summer. Arthur felt that he should be more of a man on horseback. Even the
presence of Pym, waiting on him with the usual deference, was a reassurance to
him after the scenes of yesterday. For, with Arthurâs sensitiveness to opinion,
the loss of Adamâs respect was a shock to his self-contentment which suffused
his imagination with the sense that he had sunk in all eyesâas a sudden shock
of fear from some real peril makes a nervous woman afraid even to step, because
all her perceptions are suffused with a sense of danger.

Arthurâs, as you know, was a loving nature. Deeds of kindness were as easy to
him as a bad habit: they were the common issue of his weaknesses and good
qualities, of his egoism and his sympathy. He didnât like to witness pain, and
he liked to have grateful eyes beaming on him as the giver of pleasure. When he
was a lad of seven, he one day kicked down an old gardenerâs pitcher of broth,
from no motive but a kicking impulse, not reflecting that it was the old manâs
dinner; but on learning that sad fact, he took his favourite pencil-case and a
silver-hafted knife out of his pocket and offered them as compensation. He had
been the same Arthur ever since, trying to make all offences forgotten in
benefits. If there were any bitterness in his nature, it could only show itself
against the man who refused to be conciliated by him. And perhaps the time was
come for some of that bitterness to rise. At the first moment, Arthur had felt
pure distress and self-reproach at discovering that Adamâs happiness was
involved in his relation to Hetty. If there had been a possibility of making
Adam tenfold amendsâif deeds of gift, or any other deeds, could have restored
Adamâs contentment and regard for him as a benefactor, Arthur would not only
have executed them without hesitation, but would have felt bound all the more
closely to Adam, and would never have been weary of making retribution. But
Adam could receive no amends; his suffering could not be cancelled; his respect
and affection could not be recovered by any prompt deeds of atonement. He stood
like an immovable obstacle against which no pressure could avail; an embodiment
of what Arthur most shrank from believing inâthe irrevocableness of his own
wrongdoing. The words of scorn, the refusal to shake hands, the mastery
asserted over him in their last conversation in the Hermitageâabove all, the
sense of having been knocked down, to which a man does not very well reconcile
himself, even under the most heroic circumstancesâpressed on him with a galling
pain which was stronger than compunction. Arthur would so gladly have persuaded
himself that he had done no harm! And if no one had told him the contrary, he
could have persuaded himself so much better. Nemesis can seldom forge a sword
for herself out of our consciencesâout of the suffering we feel in the
suffering we may have caused: there is rarely metal enough there to make an
effective weapon. Our moral sense learns the manners of good society and smiles
when others smile, but when some rude person gives rough names to our actions,
she is apt to take part against us. And so it was with Arthur: Adamâs judgment
of him, Adamâs grating words, disturbed his self-soothing arguments.

Not that Arthur had been at ease before Adamâs discovery. Struggles and
resolves had transformed themselves into compunction and anxiety. He was
distressed for Hettyâs sake, and distressed for his own, that he must leave her
behind. He had always, both in making and breaking resolutions, looked beyond
his passion and seen that it must speedily end in separation; but his nature
was too ardent and tender for him not to suffer at this parting; and on Hettyâs
account he was filled with uneasiness. He had found out the dream in which she
was livingâthat she was to be a lady in silks and satinsâand when he had first
talked to her about his going away, she had asked him tremblingly to let her go
with him and be married. It was his painful knowledge of this which had given
the most exasperating sting to Adamâs reproaches. He had said no word with the
purpose of deceiving herâher vision was all spun by her own childish fancyâbut
he was obliged to confess to himself that it was spun half out of his own
actions. And to increase the mischief, on this last evening he had not dared to
hint the truth to Hetty; he had been obliged to soothe her with tender, hopeful
words, lest he should throw her into violent distress. He felt the situation
acutely, felt the sorrow of the dear thing in the present, and thought with a
darker anxiety of the tenacity which her feelings might have in the future.
That was the one sharp point which pressed against him; every other he could
evade by hopeful self-persuasion. The whole thing had been secret; the Poysers
had not the shadow of a suspicion. No one, except Adam, knew anything of what
had passedâno one else was likely to know; for Arthur had impressed on Hetty
that it would be fatal to betray, by word or look, that there had been the
least intimacy between them; and Adam, who knew half their secret, would rather
help them to keep it than betray it. It was an unfortunate business altogether,
but there was no use in making it worse than it was by imaginary exaggerations
and forebodings of evil that might never come. The temporary sadness for Hetty
was the worst consequence; he resolutely turned away his eyes from any bad
consequence that was not demonstrably inevitable. Butâbut Hetty might have had
the trouble in some other way if not in this. And perhaps hereafter he might be
able to do a great deal for her and make up to her for all the tears she would
shed about him. She would owe the advantage of his care for her in future years
to the sorrow she had incurred now.
So
good comes out of evil. Such is
the beautiful arrangement of things!

Are you inclined to ask whether this can be the same Arthur who, two months
ago, had that freshness of feeling, that delicate honour which shrinks from
wounding even a sentiment, and does not contemplate any more positive offence
as possible for it?âwho thought that his own self-respect was a higher tribunal
than any external opinion? The same, I assure you, only under different
conditions. Our deeds determine us, as much as we determine our deeds, and
until we know what has been or will be the peculiar combination of outward with
inward facts, which constitutes a manâs critical actions, it will be better not
to think ourselves wise about his character. There is a terrible coercion in
our deeds, which may first turn the honest man into a deceiver and then
reconcile him to the change, for this reasonâthat the second wrong presents
itself to him in the guise of the only practicable right. The action which
before commission has been seen with that blended common sense and fresh
untarnished feeling which is the healthy eye of the soul, is looked at
afterwards with the lens of apologetic ingenuity, through which all things that
men call beautiful and ugly are seen to be made up of textures very much alike.
Europe adjusts itself to a
fait accompli
, and so does an individual
characterâuntil the placid adjustment is disturbed by a convulsive retribution.

No man can escape this vitiating effect of an offence against his own sentiment
of right, and the effect was the stronger in Arthur because of that very need
of self-respect which, while his conscience was still at ease, was one of his
best safeguards. Self-accusation was too painful to himâhe could not face it.
He must persuade himself that he had not been very much to blame; he began even
to pity himself for the necessity he was under of deceiving Adamâit was a
course so opposed to the honesty of his own nature. But then, it was the only
right thing to do.

Well, whatever had been amiss in him, he was miserable enough in consequence:
miserable about Hetty; miserable about this letter that he had promised to
write, and that seemed at one moment to be a gross barbarity, at another
perhaps the greatest kindness he could do to her. And across all this
reflection would dart every now and then a sudden impulse of passionate
defiance towards all consequences. He would carry Hetty away, and all other
considerations might go to....

In this state of mind the four walls of his room made an intolerable prison to
him; they seemed to hem in and press down upon him all the crowd of
contradictory thoughts and conflicting feelings, some of which would fly away
in the open air. He had only an hour or two to make up his mind in, and he must
get clear and calm. Once on Megâs back, in the fresh air of that fine morning,
he should be more master of the situation.

The pretty creature arched her bay neck in the sunshine, and pawed the gravel,
and trembled with pleasure when her master stroked her nose, and patted her,
and talked to her even in a more caressing tone than usual. He loved her the
better because she knew nothing of his secrets. But Meg was quite as well
acquainted with her masterâs mental state as many others of her sex with the
mental condition of the nice young gentlemen towards whom their hearts are in a
state of fluttering expectation.

Arthur cantered for five miles beyond the Chase, till he was at the foot of a
hill where there were no hedges or trees to hem in the road. Then he threw the
bridle on Megâs neck and prepared to make up his mind.

Hetty knew that their meeting yesterday must be the last before Arthur went
awayâthere was no possibility of their contriving another without exciting
suspicionâand she was like a frightened child, unable to think of anything,
only able to cry at the mention of parting, and then put her face up to have
the tears kissed away. He
could
do nothing but comfort her, and lull her
into dreaming on. A letter would be a dreadfully abrupt way of awakening her!
Yet there was truth in what Adam saidâthat it would save her from a lengthened
delusion, which might be worse than a sharp immediate pain. And it was the only
way of satisfying Adam, who
must
be satisfied, for more reasons than
one. If he could have seen her again! But that was impossible; there was such a
thorny hedge of hindrances between them, and an imprudence would be fatal. And
yet, if he
could
see her again, what good would it do? Only cause him to
suffer more from the sight of her distress and the remembrance of it. Away from
him she was surrounded by all the motives to self-control.

A sudden dread here fell like a shadow across his imaginationâthe dread lest
she should do something violent in her grief; and close upon that dread came
another, which deepened the shadow. But he shook them off with the force of
youth and hope. What was the ground for painting the future in that dark way?
It was just as likely to be the reverse. Arthur told himself he did not deserve
that things should turn out badly. He had never meant beforehand to do anything
his conscience disapproved; he had been led on by circumstances. There was a
sort of implicit confidence in him that he was really such a good fellow at
bottom, Providence would not treat him harshly.

At all events, he couldnât help what would come now: all he could do was to
take what seemed the best course at the present moment. And he persuaded
himself that that course was to make the way open between Adam and Hetty. Her
heart might really turn to Adam, as he said, after a while; and in that case
there would have been no great harm done, since it was still Adamâs ardent wish
to make her his wife. To be sure, Adam was deceivedâdeceived in a way that
Arthur would have resented as a deep wrong if it had been practised on himself.
That was a reflection that marred the consoling prospect. Arthurâs cheeks even
burned in mingled shame and irritation at the thought. But what could a man do
in such a dilemma? He was bound in honour to say no word that could injure
Hetty: his first duty was to guard
her
. He would never have told or
acted a lie on his own account. Good God! What a miserable fool he was to have
brought himself into such a dilemma; and yet, if ever a man had excuses, he
had. (Pity that consequences are determined not by excuses but by actions!)

Well, the letter must be written; it was the only means that promised a
solution of the difficulty. The tears came into Arthurâs eyes as he thought of
Hetty reading it; but it would be almost as hard for him to write it; he was
not doing anything easy to himself; and this last thought helped him to arrive
at a conclusion. He could never deliberately have taken a step which inflicted
pain on another and left himself at ease. Even a movement of jealousy at the
thought of giving up Hetty to Adam went to convince him that he was making a
sacrifice.

When once he had come to this conclusion, he turned Meg round and set off home
again in a canter. The letter should be written the first thing, and the rest
of the day would be filled up with other business: he should have no time to
look behind him. Happily, Irwine and Gawaine were coming to dinner, and by
twelve oâclock the next day he should have left the Chase miles behind him.
There was some security in this constant occupation against an uncontrollable
impulse seizing him to rush to Hetty and thrust into her hand some mad
proposition that would undo everything. Faster and faster went the sensitive
Meg, at every slight sign from her rider, till the canter had passed into a
swift gallop.

âI thought they said thâ young mester war took ill last night,â said sour old
John, the groom, at dinner-time in the servantsâ hall. âHeâs been ridinâ fit to
split the mare iâ two this forenoon.â

âThatâs happen one oâ the symptims, John,â said the facetious coachman.

âThen I wish he war let blood for ât, thatâs all,â said John, grimly.

Adam had been early at the Chase to know how Arthur was, and had been relieved
from all anxiety about the effects of his blow by learning that he was gone out
for a ride. At five oâclock he was punctually there again, and sent up word of
his arrival. In a few minutes Pym came down with a letter in his hand and gave
it to Adam, saying that the captain was too busy to see him, and had written
everything he had to say. The letter was directed to Adam, but he went out of
doors again before opening it. It contained a sealed enclosure directed to
Hetty. On the inside of the cover Adam read:

âIn the enclosed letter I have written everything you wish. I leave it to you
to decide whether you will be doing best to deliver it to Hetty or to return it
to me. Ask yourself once more whether you are not taking a measure which may
pain her more than mere silence.

Â Â Â Â âThere is no need for our seeing each other again now. We shall meet with
better feelings some months hence.

âA.D.â

âPerhaps heâs iâ thâ right on ât not to see me,â thought Adam. âItâs no use
meeting to say more hard words, and itâs no use meeting to shake hands and say
weâre friends again. Weâre not friends, anâ itâs better not to pretend it. I
know forgiveness is a manâs duty, but, to my thinking, that can only mean as
youâre to give up all thoughts oâ taking revenge: it can never mean as youâre
tâ have your old feelings back again, for thatâs not possible. Heâs not the
same man to me, and I canât
feel
the same towards him. God help me! I
donât know whether I feel the same towards anybody: I seem as if Iâd been
measuring my work from a false line, and had got it all to measure over again.â

But the question about delivering the letter to Hetty soon absorbed Adamâs
thoughts. Arthur had procured some relief to himself by throwing the decision
on Adam with a warning; and Adam, who was not given to hesitation, hesitated
here. He determined to feel his wayâto ascertain as well as he could what was
Hettyâs state of mind before he decided on delivering the letter.

Chapter XXX

The Delivery of the Letter

The next Sunday Adam joined the Poysers on their way out of church, hoping for
an invitation to go home with them. He had the letter in his pocket, and was
anxious to have an opportunity of talking to Hetty alone. He could not see her
face at church, for she had changed her seat, and when he came up to her to
shake hands, her manner was doubtful and constrained. He expected this, for it
was the first time she had met him since she had been aware that he had seen
her with Arthur in the Grove.

âCome, youâll go on with us, Adam,â Mr. Poyser said when they reached the
turning; and as soon as they were in the fields Adam ventured to offer his arm
to Hetty. The children soon gave them an opportunity of lingering behind a
little, and then Adam said:

âWill you contrive for me to walk out in the garden a bit with you this
evening, if it keeps fine, Hetty? Iâve something particâlar to talk to you
about.â

Hetty said, âVery well.â She was really as anxious as Adam was that she should
have some private talk with him. She wondered what he thought of her and
Arthur. He must have seen them kissing, she knew, but she had no conception of
the scene that had taken place between Arthur and Adam. Her first feeling had
been that Adam would be very angry with her, and perhaps would tell her aunt
and uncle, but it never entered her mind that he would dare to say anything to
Captain Donnithorne. It was a relief to her that he behaved so kindly to her
to-day, and wanted to speak to
her
alone; for she had trembled when she
found he was going home with them lest he should mean âto tell.â But, now he
wanted to talk to her by herself, she should learn what he thought and what he
meant to do. She felt a certain confidence that she could persuade him not to
do anything she did not want him to do; she could perhaps even make him believe
that she didnât care for Arthur; and as long as Adam thought there was any hope
of her having him, he would do just what she liked, she knew. Besides, she

must
go on seeming to encourage Adam, lest her uncle and aunt should be
angry and suspect her of having some secret lover.

Hettyâs little brain was busy with this combination as she hung on Adamâs arm
and said âyesâ or ânoâ to some slight observations of his about the many
hawthorn-berries there would be for the birds this next winter, and the
low-hanging clouds that would hardly hold up till morning. And when they
rejoined her aunt and uncle, she could pursue her thoughts without
interruption, for Mr. Poyser held that though a young man might like to have
the woman he was courting on his arm, he would nevertheless be glad of a little
reasonable talk about business the while; and, for his own part, he was curious
to hear the most recent news about the Chase Farm. So, through the rest of the
walk, he claimed Adamâs conversation for himself, and Hetty laid her small
plots and imagined her little scenes of cunning blandishment, as she walked
along by the hedgerows on honest Adamâs arm, quite as well as if she had been
an elegantly clad coquette alone in her boudoir. For if a country beauty in
clumsy shoes be only shallow-hearted enough, it is astonishing how closely her
mental processes may resemble those of a lady in society and crinoline, who
applies her refined intellect to the problem of committing indiscretions
without compromising herself. Perhaps the resemblance was not much the less
because Hetty felt very unhappy all the while. The parting with Arthur was a
double pain to herâmingling with the tumult of passion and vanity there was a
dim undefined fear that the future might shape itself in some way quite unlike
her dream. She clung to the comforting hopeful words Arthur had uttered in
their last meetingââI shall come again at Christmas, and then we will see what
can be done.â She clung to the belief that he was so fond of her, he would
never be happy without her; and she still hugged her secretâthat a great
gentleman loved herâwith gratified pride, as a superiority over all the girls
she knew. But the uncertainty of the future, the possibilities to which she
could give no shape, began to press upon her like the invisible weight of air;
she was alone on her little island of dreams, and all around her was the dark
unknown water where Arthur was gone. She could gather no elation of spirits now
by looking forward, but only by looking backward to build confidence on past
words and caresses. But occasionally, since Thursday evening, her dim anxieties
had been almost lost behind the more definite fear that Adam might betray what
he knew to her uncle and aunt, and his sudden proposition to talk with her
alone had set her thoughts to work in a new way. She was eager not to lose this
eveningâs opportunity; and after tea, when the boys were going into the garden
and Totty begged to go with them, Hetty said, with an alacrity that surprised
Mrs. Poyser, âIâll go with her, Aunt.â

It did not seem at all surprising that Adam said he would go too, and soon he
and Hetty were left alone together on the walk by the filbert-trees, while the
boys were busy elsewhere gathering the large unripe nuts to play at âcob-nutâ
with, and Totty was watching them with a puppylike air of contemplation. It was
but a short timeâhardly two monthsâsince Adam had had his mind filled with
delicious hopes as he stood by Hettyâs side in this garden. The remembrance of
that scene had often been with him since Thursday evening: the sunlight through
the apple-tree boughs, the red bunches, Hettyâs sweet blush. It came
importunately now, on this sad evening, with the low-hanging clouds, but he
tried to suppress it, lest some emotion should impel him to say more than was
needful for Hettyâs sake.

âAfter what I saw on Thursday night, Hetty,â he began, âyou wonât think me
making too free in what Iâm going to say. If you was being courted by any man
as âud make you his wife, and Iâd known you was fond of him and meant to have
him, I should have no right to speak a word to you about it; but when I see
youâre being made love to by a gentleman as can never marry you, and doesna
think oâ marrying you, I feel bound tâ interfere for you. I canât speak about
it to them as are iâ the place oâ your parents, for that might bring worse
trouble thanâs needful.â

Adamâs words relieved one of Hettyâs fears, but they also carried a meaning
which sickened her with a strengthened foreboding. She was pale and trembling,
and yet she would have angrily contradicted Adam, if she had dared to betray
her feelings. But she was silent.

âYouâre so young, you know, Hetty,â he went on, almost tenderly, âand yâ
havenât seen much oâ what goes on in the world. Itâs right for me to do what I
can to save you from getting into trouble for want oâ your knowing where youâre
being led to. If anybody besides me knew what I know about your meeting a
gentleman and having fine presents from him, theyâd speak light on you, and
youâd lose your character. And besides that, youâll have to suffer in your
feelings, wiâ giving your love to a man as can never marry you, so as he might
take care of you all your life.â

Adam paused and looked at Hetty, who was plucking the leaves from the
filbert-trees and tearing them up in her hand. Her little plans and
preconcerted speeches had all forsaken her, like an ill-learnt lesson, under
the terrible agitation produced by Adamâs words. There was a cruel force in
their calm certainty which threatened to grapple and crush her flimsy hopes and
fancies. She wanted to resist themâshe wanted to throw them off with angry
contradictionâbut the determination to conceal what she felt still governed
her. It was nothing more than a blind prompting now, for she was unable to
calculate the effect of her words.

âYouâve no right to say as I love him,â she said, faintly, but impetuously,
plucking another rough leaf and tearing it up. She was very beautiful in her
paleness and agitation, with her dark childish eyes dilated and her breath
shorter than usual. Adamâs heart yearned over her as he looked at her. Ah, if
he could but comfort her, and soothe her, and save her from this pain; if he
had but some sort of strength that would enable him to rescue her poor troubled
mind, as he would have rescued her body in the face of all danger!

âI doubt it must be so, Hetty,â he said, tenderly; âfor I canna believe youâd
let any man kiss you by yourselves, and give you a gold box with his hair, and
go a-walking iâ the Grove to meet him, if you didna love him. Iâm not blaming
you, for I know it âud begin by little and little, till at last youâd not be
able to throw it off. Itâs him I blame for stealing your love iâ that way, when
he knew he could never make you the right amends. Heâs been trifling with you,
and making a plaything of you, and caring nothing about you as a man ought to
care.â

âYes, he does care for me; I know better nor you,â Hetty burst out. Everything
was forgotten but the pain and anger she felt at Adamâs words.

âNay, Hetty,â said Adam, âif heâd cared for you rightly, heâd never haâ behaved
so. He told me himself he meant nothing by his kissing and presents, and he
wanted to make me believe as you thought light of âem too. But I know better
nor that. I canât help thinking as youâve been trusting to his loving you well
enough to marry you, for all heâs a gentleman. And thatâs why I must speak to
you about it, Hetty, for fear you should be deceiving yourself. Itâs never
entered his head the thought oâ marrying you.â

âHow do you know? How durst you say so?â said Hetty, pausing in her walk and
trembling. The terrible decision of Adamâs tone shook her with fear. She had no
presence of mind left for the reflection that Arthur would have his reasons for
not telling the truth to Adam. Her words and look were enough to determine
Adam: he must give her the letter.

âPerhaps you canât believe me, Hetty, because you think too well of himâbecause
you think he loves you better than he does. But Iâve got a letter iâ my pocket,
as he wrote himself for me to give you. Iâve not read the letter, but he says
heâs told you the truth in it. But before I give you the letter, consider,
Hetty, and donât let it take too much hold on you. It wouldna haâ been good for
you if heâd wanted to do such a mad thing as marry you: it âud haâ led to no
happiness iâ thâ end.â

Hetty said nothing; she felt a revival of hope at the mention of a letter which
Adam had not read. There would be something quite different in it from what he
thought.

Adam took out the letter, but he held it in his hand still, while he said, in a
tone of tender entreaty, âDonât you bear me ill will, Hetty, because Iâm the
means oâ bringing you this pain. God knows Iâd haâ borne a good deal worse for
the sake oâ sparing it you. And thinkâthereâs nobody but me knows about this,
and Iâll take care of you as if I was your brother. Youâre the same as ever to
me, for I donât believe youâve done any wrong knowingly.â

Hetty had laid her hand on the letter, but Adam did not loose it till he had
done speaking. She took no notice of what he saidâshe had not listened; but
when he loosed the letter, she put it into her pocket, without opening it, and
then began to walk more quickly, as if she wanted to go in.

âYouâre in the right not to read it just yet,â said Adam. âRead it when youâre
by yourself. But stay out a little bit longer, and let us call the children:
you look so white and ill, your aunt may take notice of it.â

Hetty heard the warning. It recalled to her the necessity of rallying her
native powers of concealment, which had half given way under the shock of
Adamâs words. And she had the letter in her pocket: she was sure there was
comfort in that letter in spite of Adam. She ran to find Totty, and soon
reappeared with recovered colour, leading Totty, who was making a sour face
because she had been obliged to throw away an unripe apple that she had set her
small teeth in.

âHegh, Totty,â said Adam, âcome and ride on my shoulderâever so highâyouâll
touch the tops oâ the trees.â

What little child ever refused to be comforted by that glorious sense of being
seized strongly and swung upward? I donât believe Ganymede cried when the eagle
carried him away, and perhaps deposited him on Joveâs shoulder at the end.
Totty smiled down complacently from her secure height, and pleasant was the
sight to the motherâs eyes, as she stood at the house door and saw Adam coming
with his small burden.

âBless your sweet face, my pet,â she said, the motherâs strong love filling her
keen eyes with mildness, as Totty leaned forward and put out her arms. She had
no eyes for Hetty at that moment, and only said, without looking at her, âYou
go and draw some ale, Hetty; the gells are both at the cheese.â

After the ale had been drawn and her uncleâs pipe lighted, there was Totty to
be taken to bed, and brought down again in her night-gown because she would cry
instead of going to sleep. Then there was supper to be got ready, and Hetty
must be continually in the way to give help. Adam stayed till he knew Mrs.
Poyser expected him to go, engaging her and her husband in talk as constantly
as he could, for the sake of leaving Hetty more at ease. He lingered, because
he wanted to see her safely through that evening, and he was delighted to find
how much self-command she showed. He knew she had not had time to read the
letter, but he did not know she was buoyed up by a secret hope that the letter
would contradict everything he had said. It was hard work for him to leave
herâhard to think that he should not know for days how she was bearing her
trouble. But he must go at last, and all he could do was to press her hand
gently as he said âGood-bye,â and hope she would take that as a sign that if
his love could ever be a refuge for her, it was there the same as ever. How
busy his thoughts were, as he walked home, in devising pitying excuses for her
folly, in referring all her weakness to the sweet lovingness of her nature, in
blaming Arthur, with less and less inclination to admit that
his
conduct
might be extenuated too! His exasperation at Hettyâs sufferingâand also at the
sense that she was possibly thrust for ever out of his own reachâdeafened him
to any plea for the miscalled friend who had wrought this misery. Adam was a
clear-sighted, fair-minded manâa fine fellow, indeed, morally as well as
physically. But if Aristides the Just was ever in love and jealous, he was at
that moment not perfectly magnanimous. And I cannot pretend that Adam, in these
painful days, felt nothing but righteous indignation and loving pity. He was
bitterly jealous, and in proportion as his love made him indulgent in his
judgment of Hetty, the bitterness found a vent in his feeling towards Arthur.

âHer head was allays likely to be turned,â he thought, âwhen a gentleman, with
his fine manners, and fine clothes, and his white hands, and that way oâ
talking gentlefolks have, came about her, making up to her in a bold way, as a
man couldnât do that was only her equal; and itâs much if sheâll ever like a
common man now.â He could not help drawing his own hands out of his pocket and
looking at themâat the hard palms and the broken finger-nails. âIâm a roughish
fellow, altogether; I donât know, now I come to think onât, what there is much
for a woman to like about me; and yet I might haâ got another wife easy enough,
if I hadnât set my heart on her. But itâs little matter what other women think
about me, if she canât love me. She might haâ loved me, perhaps, as likely as
any other manâthereâs nobody hereabouts as Iâm afraid of, if
he
hadnât
come between us; but now I shall belike be hateful to her because Iâm so
different to him. And yet thereâs no tellingâshe may turn round the other way,
when she finds heâs made light of her all the while. She may come to feel the
vally of a man as âud be thankful to be bound to her all his life. But I must
put up with it whichever way it isâIâve only to be thankful itâs been no worse.
I am not thâ only man thatâs got to do without much happiness iâ this life.
Thereâs many a good bit oâ work done with a bad heart. Itâs Godâs will, and
thatâs enough for us: we shouldnât know better how things ought to be than He
does, I reckon, if we was to spend our lives iâ puzzling. But it âud haâ gone
near to spoil my work for me, if Iâd seen her brought to sorrow and shame, and
through the man as Iâve always been proud to think on. Since Iâve been spared
that, Iâve no right to grumble. When a manâs got his limbs whole, he can bear a
smart cut or two.â

As Adam was getting over a stile at this point in his reflections, he perceived
a man walking along the field before him. He knew it was Seth, returning from
an evening preaching, and made haste to overtake him.

âI thought theeâdst be at home before me,â he said, as Seth turned round to
wait for him, âfor Iâm later than usual to-night.â

âWell, Iâm later too, for I got into talk, after meeting, with John Barnes, who
has lately professed himself in a state of perfection, and Iâd a question to
ask him about his experience. Itâs one oâ them subjects that lead you further
than yâ expectâthey donât lie along the straight road.â

They walked along together in silence two or three minutes. Adam was not
inclined to enter into the subtleties of religious experience, but he was
inclined to interchange a word or two of brotherly affection and confidence
with Seth. That was a rare impulse in him, much as the brothers loved each
other. They hardly ever spoke of personal matters, or uttered more than an
allusion to their family troubles. Adam was by nature reserved in all matters
of feeling, and Seth felt a certain timidity towards his more practical
brother.

âSeth, lad,â Adam said, putting his arm on his brotherâs shoulder, âhast heard
anything from Dinah Morris since she went away?â

âYes,â said Seth. âShe told me I might write her word after a while, how we
went on, and how mother bore up under her trouble. So I wrote to her a
fortnight ago, and told her about thee having a new employment, and how Mother
was more contented; and last Wednesday, when I called at the post at
Treddlesâon, I found a letter from her. I think theeâdst perhaps like to read
it, but I didna say anything about it because theeâst seemed so full of other
things. Itâs quite easy tâ readâshe writes wonderful for a woman.â

Seth had drawn the letter from his pocket and held it out to Adam, who said, as
he took it, âAye, lad, Iâve got a tough load to carry just nowâthee mustna take
it ill if Iâm a bit silenter and crustier nor usual. Trouble doesna make me
care the less for thee. I know we shall stick together to the last.â

âI take nought ill oâ thee, Adam. I know well enough what it means if theeât a
bit short wiâ me now and then.â

âThereâs Mother opening the door to look out for us,â said Adam, as they
mounted the slope. âSheâs been sitting iâ the dark as usual. Well, Gyp, well,
art glad to see me?â

Lisbeth went in again quickly and lighted a candle, for she had heard the
welcome rustling of footsteps on the grass, before Gypâs joyful bark.

âEh, my lads! Thâ hours war neâer so long sinâ I war born as theyân been this
blessed Sunday night. What can ye both haâ been doinâ till this time?â

âThee shouldstna sit iâ the dark, Mother,â said Adam; âthat makes the time seem
longer.â

âEh, what am I to do wiâ burninâ candle of a Sunday, when thereâs onây me anâ
itâs sin to do a bit oâ knittinâ? The daylightâs long enough for me to stare iâ
the booke as I canna read. It âud be a fine way oâ shorteninâ the time, to make
it waste the good candle. But which on youâs for haâinâ supper? Ye mun ayther
be clemmed or full, I should think, seeinâ what time oâ night it is.â

âIâm hungry, Mother,â said Seth, seating himself at the little table, which had
been spread ever since it was light.

âIâve had my supper,â said Adam. âHere, Gyp,â he added, taking some cold potato
from the table and rubbing the rough grey head that looked up towards him.

âThee needstna be giâinâ thâ dog,â said Lisbeth; âIân fed him well aâready. Iâm
not like to forget him, I reckon, when heâs all oâ thee I can get sight on.â

âCome, then, Gyp,â said Adam, âweâll go to bed. Good-night, Mother; Iâm very
tired.â

âWhat ails him, dost know?â Lisbeth said to Seth, when Adam was gone upstairs.
âHeâs like as if he was struck for death this day or twoâheâs so cast down. I
found him iâ the shop this forenoon, arter thee wast gone, a-sittinâ anâ doinâ
nothinâânot so much as a booke afore him.â

âHeâs a deal oâ work upon him just now, Mother,â said Seth, âand I think heâs a
bit troubled in his mind. Donât you take notice of it, because it hurts him
when you do. Be as kind to him as you can, Mother, and donât say anything to
vex him.â

âEh, what dost talk oâ my vexinâ him? Anâ what am I like to be but kind? Iâll
maâ him a kettle-cake for breakfast iâ the morninâ.â

Adam, meanwhile, was reading Dinahâs letter by the light of his dip candle.

ROTHER
S
ETH
âYour letter lay
three days beyond my knowing of it at the post, for I had not money enough by
me to pay the carriage, this being a time of great need and sickness here, with
the rains that have fallen, as if the windows of heaven were opened again; and
to lay by money, from day to day, in such a time, when there are so many in
present need of all things, would be a want of trust like the laying up of the
manna. I speak of this, because I would not have you think me slow to answer,
or that I had small joy in your rejoicing at the worldly good that has befallen
your brother Adam. The honour and love you bear him is nothing but meet, for
God has given him great gifts, and he uses them as the patriarch Joseph did,
who, when he was exalted to a place of power and trust, yet yearned with
tenderness towards his parent and his younger brother.

âMy heart is knit to your aged mother since it was granted me to be near her in
the day of trouble. Speak to her of me, and tell her I often bear her in my
thoughts at evening time, when I am sitting in the dim light as I did with her,
and we held one anotherâs hands, and I spoke the words of comfort that were
given to me. Ah, that is a blessed time, isnât it, Seth, when the outward light
is fading, and the body is a little wearied with its work and its labour. Then
the inward light shines the brighter, and we have a deeper sense of resting on
the Divine strength. I sit on my chair in the dark room and close my eyes, and
it is as if I was out of the body and could feel no want for evermore. For
then, the very hardship, and the sorrow, and the blindness, and the sin I have
beheld and been ready to weep overâyea, all the anguish of the children of men,
which sometimes wraps me round like sudden darknessâI can bear with a willing
pain, as if I was sharing the Redeemerâs cross. For I feel it, I feel
itâinfinite love is suffering tooâyea, in the fulness of knowledge it suffers,
it yearns, it mourns; and that is a blind self-seeking which wants to be freed
from the sorrow wherewith the whole creation groaneth and travaileth. Surely it
is not true blessedness to be free from sorrow, while there is sorrow and sin
in the world: sorrow is then a part of love, and love does not seek to throw it
off. It is not the spirit only that tells me thisâI see it in the whole work
and word of the Gospel. Is there not pleading in heaven? Is not the Man of
Sorrows there in that crucified body wherewith he ascended? And is He not one
with the Infinite Love itselfâas our love is one with our sorrow?

âThese thoughts have been much borne in on me of late, and I have seen with new
clearness the meaning of those words, âIf any man love me, let him take up my
cross.â I have heard this enlarged on as if it meant the troubles and
persecutions we bring on ourselves by confessing Jesus. But surely that is a
narrow thought. The true cross of the Redeemer was the sin and sorrow of this
worldâ
that
was what lay heavy on his heartâand that is the cross we
shall share with him, that is the cup we must drink of with him, if we would
have any part in that Divine Love which is one with his sorrow.

âIn my outward lot, which you ask about, I have all things and abound. I have
had constant work in the mill, though some of the other hands have been turned
off for a time, and my body is greatly strengthened, so that I feel little
weariness after long walking and speaking. What you say about staying in your
own country with your mother and brother shows me that you have a true
guidance; your lot is appointed there by a clear showing, and to seek a greater
blessing elsewhere would be like laying a false offering on the altar and
expecting the fire from heaven to kindle it. My work and my joy are here among
the hills, and I sometimes think I cling too much to my life among the people
here, and should be rebellious if I was called away.

âI was thankful for your tidings about the dear friends at the Hall Farm, for
though I sent them a letter, by my auntâs desire, after I came back from my
sojourn among them, I have had no word from them. My aunt has not the pen of a
ready writer, and the work of the house is sufficient for the day, for she is
weak in body. My heart cleaves to her and her children as the nearest of all to
me in the fleshâyea, and to all in that house. I am carried away to them
continually in my sleep, and often in the midst of work, and even of speech,
the thought of them is borne in on me as if they were in need and trouble,
which yet is dark to me. There may be some leading here; but I wait to be
taught. You say they are all well.

âWe shall see each other again in the body, I trust, though, it may be, not for
a long while; for the brethren and sisters at Leeds are desirous to have me for
a short space among them, when I have a door opened me again to leave
Snowfield.

âFarewell, dear brotherâand yet not farewell. For those children of God whom it
has been granted to see each other face to face, and to hold communion
together, and to feel the same spirit working in both can never more be
sundered though the hills may lie between. For their souls are enlarged for
evermore by that union, and they bear one another about in their thoughts
continually as it were a new strength.âYour faithful Sister and fellow-worker
in Christ,

âI have not skill to write the words so small as you do and my pen moves slow.
And so I am straitened, and say but little of what is in my mind. Greet your
mother for me with a kiss. She asked me to kiss her twice when we parted.â

Adam had refolded the letter, and was sitting meditatively with his head
resting on his arm at the head of the bed, when Seth came upstairs.

âHast read the letter?â said Seth.

âYes,â said Adam. âI donât know what I should haâ thought of her and her letter
if Iâd never seen her: I daresay I should haâ thought a preaching woman
hateful. But sheâs one as makes everything seem right she says and does, and I
seemed to see her and hear her speaking when I read the letter. Itâs wonderful
how I remember her looks and her voice. Sheâd make thee rare and happy, Seth;
sheâs just the woman for thee.â

âItâs no use thinking oâ that,â said Seth, despondingly. âShe spoke so firm,
and sheâs not the woman to say one thing and mean another.â

âNay, but her feelings may grow different. A woman may get to love by
degreesâthe best fire dosna flare up the soonest. Iâd have thee go and see her
by and by: Iâd make it convenient for thee to be away three or four days, and
it âud be no walk for theeâonly between twenty and thirty mile.â

âI should like to see her again, whether or no, if she wouldna be displeased
with me for going,â said Seth.

âSheâll be none displeased,â said Adam emphatically, getting up and throwing
off his coat. âIt might be a great happiness to us all if sheâd have thee, for
mother took to her so wonderful and seemed so contented to be with her.â

âAye,â said Seth, rather timidly, âand Dinahâs fond oâ Hetty too; she thinks a
deal about her.â

Adam made no reply to that, and no other word but âgood-nightâ passed between
them.

Chapter XXXI

In Hettyâs Bed-Chamber

It was no longer light enough to go to bed without a candle, even in Mrs.
Poyserâs early household, and Hetty carried one with her as she went up at last
to her bedroom soon after Adam was gone, and bolted the door behind her.

Now
she would read her letter. It mustâit must have comfort in it. How
was Adam to know the truth? It was always likely he should say what he did say.

She set down the candle and took out the letter. It had a faint scent of roses,
which made her feel as if Arthur were close to her. She put it to her lips, and
a rush of remembered sensations for a moment or two swept away all fear. But
her heart began to flutter strangely, and her hands to tremble as she broke the
seal. She read slowly; it was not easy for her to read a gentlemanâs
handwriting, though Arthur had taken pains to write plainly.

âD
EAREST
H
ETTY
âI have spoken truly when I have
said that I loved you, and I shall never forget our love. I shall be your true
friend as long as life lasts, and I hope to prove this to you in many ways. If
I say anything to pain you in this letter, do not believe it is for want of
love and tenderness towards you, for there is nothing I would not do for you,
if I knew it to be really for your happiness. I cannot bear to think of my
little Hetty shedding tears when I am not there to kiss them away; and if I
followed only my own inclinations, I should be with her at this moment instead
of writing. It is very hard for me to part from herâharder still for me to
write words which may seem unkind, though they spring from the truest kindness.

âDear, dear Hetty, sweet as our love has been to me, sweet as it would be to me
for you to love me always, I feel that it would have been better for us both if
we had never had that happiness, and that it is my duty to ask you to love me
and care for me as little as you can. The fault has all been mine, for though I
have been unable to resist the longing to be near you, I have felt all the
while that your affection for me might cause you grief. I ought to have
resisted my feelings. I should have done so, if I had been a better fellow than
I am; but now, since the past cannot be altered, I am bound to save you from
any evil that I have power to prevent. And I feel it would be a great evil for
you if your affections continued so fixed on me that you could think of no
other man who might be able to make you happier by his love than I ever can,
and if you continued to look towards something in the future which cannot
possibly happen. For, dear Hetty, if I were to do what you one day spoke of,
and make you my wife, I should do what you yourself would come to feel was for
your misery instead of your welfare. I know you can never be happy except by
marrying a man in your own station; and if I were to marry you now, I should
only be adding to any wrong I have done, besides offending against my duty in
the other relations of life. You know nothing, dear Hetty, of the world in
which I must always live, and you would soon begin to dislike me, because there
would be so little in which we should be alike.

âAnd since I cannot marry you, we must partâwe must try not to feel like lovers
any more. I am miserable while I say this, but nothing else can be. Be angry
with me, my sweet one, I deserve it; but do not believe that I shall not always
care for youâalways be grateful to youâalways remember my Hetty; and if any
trouble should come that we do not now foresee, trust in me to do everything
that lies in my power.

âI have told you where you are to direct a letter to, if you want to write, but
I put it down below lest you should have forgotten. Do not write unless there
is something I can really do for you; for, dear Hetty, we must try to think of
each other as little as we can. Forgive me, and try to forget everything about
me, except that I shall be, as long as I live, your affectionate friend,

âA
RTHUR
D
ONNITHORNE
.â

Slowly Hetty had read this letter; and when she looked up from it there was the
reflection of a blanched face in the old dim glassâa white marble face with
rounded childish forms, but with something sadder than a childâs pain in it.
Hetty did not see the faceâshe saw nothingâshe only felt that she was cold and
sick and trembling. The letter shook and rustled in her hand. She laid it down.
It was a horrible sensationâthis cold and trembling. It swept away the very
ideas that produced it, and Hetty got up to reach a warm cloak from her
clothes-press, wrapped it round her, and sat as if she were thinking of nothing
but getting warm. Presently she took up the letter with a firmer hand, and
began to read it through again. The tears came this timeâgreat rushing tears
that blinded her and blotched the paper. She felt nothing but that Arthur was
cruelâcruel to write so, cruel not to marry her. Reasons why he could not marry
her had no existence for her mind; how could she believe in any misery that
could come to her from the fulfilment of all she had been longing for and
dreaming of? She had not the ideas that could make up the notion of that
misery.

As she threw down the letter again, she caught sight of her face in the glass;
it was reddened now, and wet with tears; it was almost like a companion that
she might complain toâthat would pity her. She leaned forward on her elbows,
and looked into those dark overflooding eyes and at the quivering mouth, and
saw how the tears came thicker and thicker, and how the mouth became convulsed
with sobs.

The shattering of all her little dream-world, the crushing blow on her new-born
passion, afflicted her pleasure-craving nature with an overpowering pain that
annihilated all impulse to resistance, and suspended her anger. She sat sobbing
till the candle went out, and then, wearied, aching, stupefied with crying,
threw herself on the bed without undressing and went to sleep.

There was a feeble dawn in the room when Hetty awoke, a little after four
oâclock, with a sense of dull misery, the cause of which broke upon her
gradually as she began to discern the objects round her in the dim light. And
then came the frightening thought that she had to conceal her misery as well as
to bear it, in this dreary daylight that was coming. She could lie no longer.
She got up and went towards the table: there lay the letter. She opened her
treasure-drawer: there lay the ear-rings and the locketâthe signs of all her
short happinessâthe signs of the lifelong dreariness that was to follow it.
Looking at the little trinkets which she had once eyed and fingered so fondly
as the earnest of her future paradise of finery, she lived back in the moments
when they had been given to her with such tender caresses, such strangely
pretty words, such glowing looks, which filled her with a bewildering delicious
surpriseâthey were so much sweeter than she had thought anything could be. And
the Arthur who had spoken to her and looked at her in this way, who was present
with her nowâwhose arm she felt round her, his cheek against hers, his very
breath upon herâwas the cruel, cruel Arthur who had written that letter, that
letter which she snatched and crushed and then opened again, that she might
read it once more. The half-benumbed mental condition which was the effect of
the last nightâs violent crying made it necessary to her to look again and see
if her wretched thoughts were actually trueâif the letter was really so cruel.
She had to hold it close to the window, else she could not have read it by the
faint light. Yes! It was worseâit was more cruel. She crushed it up again in
anger. She hated the writer of that letterâhated him for the very reason that
she hung upon him with all her loveâall the girlish passion and vanity that
made up her love.

She had no tears this morning. She had wept them all away last night, and now
she felt that dry-eyed morning misery, which is worse than the first shock
because it has the future in it as well as the present. Every morning to come,
as far as her imagination could stretch, she would have to get up and feel that
the day would have no joy for her. For there is no despair so absolute as that
which comes with the first moments of our first great sorrow, when we have not
yet known what it is to have suffered and be healed, to have despaired and to
have recovered hope. As Hetty began languidly to take off the clothes she had
worn all the night, that she might wash herself and brush her hair, she had a
sickening sense that her life would go on in this way. She should always be
doing things she had no pleasure in, getting up to the old tasks of work,
seeing people she cared nothing about, going to church, and to Treddleston, and
to tea with Mrs. Best, and carrying no happy thought with her. For her short
poisonous delights had spoiled for ever all the little joys that had once made
the sweetness of her lifeâthe new frock ready for Treddleston Fair, the party
at Mr. Brittonâs at Broxton wake, the beaux that she would say âNoâ to for a
long while, and the prospect of the wedding that was to come at last when she
would have a silk gown and a great many clothes all at once. These things were
all flat and dreary to her now; everything would be a weariness, and she would
carry about for ever a hopeless thirst and longing.

She paused in the midst of her languid undressing and leaned against the dark
old clothes-press. Her neck and arms were bare, her hair hung down in delicate
ringsâand they were just as beautiful as they were that night two months ago,
when she walked up and down this bed-chamber glowing with vanity and hope. She
was not thinking of her neck and arms now; even her own beauty was indifferent
to her. Her eyes wandered sadly over the dull old chamber, and then looked out
vacantly towards the growing dawn. Did a remembrance of Dinah come across her
mind? Of her foreboding words, which had made her angry? Of Dinahâs
affectionate entreaty to think of her as a friend in trouble? No, the
impression had been too slight to recur. Any affection or comfort Dinah could
have given her would have been as indifferent to Hetty this morning as
everything else was except her bruised passion. She was only thinking she could
never stay here and go on with the old lifeâshe could better bear something
quite new than sinking back into the old everyday round. She would like to run
away that very morning, and never see any of the old faces again. But Hettyâs
was not a nature to face difficultiesâto dare to loose her hold on the familiar
and rush blindly on some unknown condition. Hers was a luxurious and vain
natureânot a passionate oneâand if she were ever to take any violent measure,
she must be urged to it by the desperation of terror. There was not much room
for her thoughts to travel in the narrow circle of her imagination, and she
soon fixed on the one thing she would do to get away from her old life: she
would ask her uncle to let her go to be a ladyâs maid. Miss Lydiaâs maid would
help her to get a situation, if she knew Hetty had her uncleâs leave.

When she had thought of this, she fastened up her hair and began to wash: it
seemed more possible to her to go downstairs and try to behave as usual. She
would ask her uncle this very day. On Hettyâs blooming health it would take a
great deal of such mental suffering as hers to leave any deep impress; and when
she was dressed as neatly as usual in her working-dress, with her hair tucked
up under her little cap, an indifferent observer would have been more struck
with the young roundness of her cheek and neck and the darkness of her eyes and
eyelashes than with any signs of sadness about her. But when she took up the
crushed letter and put it in her drawer, that she might lock it out of sight,
hard smarting tears, having no relief in them as the great drops had that fell
last night, forced their way into her eyes. She wiped them away quickly: she
must not cry in the day-time. Nobody should find out how miserable she was,
nobody should know she was disappointed about anything; and the thought that
the eyes of her aunt and uncle would be upon her gave her the self-command
which often accompanies a great dread. For Hetty looked out from her secret
misery towards the possibility of their ever knowing what had happened, as the
sick and weary prisoner might think of the possible pillory. They would think
her conduct shameful, and shame was torture. That was poor little Hettyâs
conscience.

So she locked up her drawer and went away to her early work.

In the evening, when Mr. Poyser was smoking his pipe, and his good-nature was
therefore at its superlative moment, Hetty seized the opportunity of her auntâs
absence to say, âUncle, I wish youâd let me go for a ladyâs maid.â

Mr. Poyser took the pipe from his mouth and looked at Hetty in mild surprise
for some moments. She was sewing, and went on with her work industriously.

âWhy, whatâs put that into your head, my wench?â he said at last, after he had
given one conservative puff.

âI should like itâI should like it better than farm-work.â

âNay, nay; you fancy so because you donna know it, my wench. It wouldnât be
half so good for your health, nor for your luck iâ life. Iâd like you to stay
wiâ us till youâve got a good husband: youâre my own niece, and I wouldnât have
you go to service, though it was a gentlemanâs house, as long as Iâve got a
home for you.â

Mr. Poyser paused, and puffed away at his pipe.

âI like the needlework,â said Hetty, âand I should get good wages.â

âHas your aunt been a bit sharp wiâ you?â said Mr. Poyser, not noticing Hettyâs
further argument. âYou mustna mind that, my wenchâshe does it for your good.
She wishes you well; anâ there isnât many aunts as are no kin to you âud haâ
done by you as she has.â

âNo, it isnât my aunt,â said Hetty, âbut I should like the work better.â

âIt was all very well for you to learn the work a bitâanâ I gev my consent to
that fast enough, sinâ Mrs. Pomfret was willing to teach you. For if anything
was tâ happen, itâs well to know how to turn your hand to different sorts oâ
things. But I niver meant you to go to service, my wench; my familyâs ate their
own bread and cheese as fur back as anybody knows, hanna they, Father? You
wouldna like your grand-child to take wage?â

âNa-a-y,â said old Martin, with an elongation of the word, meant to make it
bitter as well as negative, while he leaned forward and looked down on the
floor. âBut the wench takes arter her mother. Iâd hard work tâ hould
her

in, anâ she married iâ spite oâ meâa feller wiâ onây two head oâ stock when
there should haâ been ten onâs farmâshe might well die oâ thâ inflammation
afore she war thirty.â

It was seldom the old man made so long a speech, but his sonâs question had
fallen like a bit of dry fuel on the embers of a long unextinguished
resentment, which had always made the grandfather more indifferent to Hetty
than to his sonâs children. Her motherâs fortune had been spent by that
good-for-nought Sorrel, and Hetty had Sorrelâs blood in her veins.

âPoor thing, poor thing!â said Martin the younger, who was sorry to have
provoked this retrospective harshness. âSheâd but bad luck. But Hettyâs got as
good a chance oâ getting a solid, sober husband as any gell iâ this country.â

After throwing out this pregnant hint, Mr. Poyser recurred to his pipe and his
silence, looking at Hetty to see if she did not give some sign of having
renounced her ill-advised wish. But instead of that, Hetty, in spite of
herself, began to cry, half out of ill temper at the denial, half out of the
dayâs repressed sadness.

âHegh, hegh!â said Mr. Poyser, meaning to check her playfully, âdonât letâs
have any crying. Cryingâs for them as haâ got no home, not for them as want to
get rid oâ one. What dost think?â he continued to his wife, who now came back
into the house-place, knitting with fierce rapidity, as if that movement were a
necessary function, like the twittering of a crabâs antennÃ¦.

âThink? Why, I think we shall have the fowl stole before we are much older, wiâ
that gell forgetting to lock the pens up oâ nights. Whatâs the matter now,
Hetty? What are you crying at?â

âWhy, sheâs been wanting to go for a ladyâs maid,â said Mr. Poyser. âI tell her
we can do better for her nor that.â

âI thought sheâd got some maggot in her head, sheâs gone about wiâ her mouth
buttoned up so all day. Itâs all wiâ going so among them servants at the Chase,
as we war fools for letting her. She thinks it âud be a finer life than being
wiâ them as are akin to her and haâ brought her up sinâ she war no bigger nor
Marty. She thinks thereâs nothing belongs to being a ladyâs maid but wearing
finer clothes nor she was born to, Iâll be bound. Itâs what rag she can get to
stick on her as sheâs thinking on from morning till night, as I often ask her
if she wouldnât like to be the mawkin iâ the field, for then sheâd be made oâ
rags inside and out. Iâll never giâ my consent to her going for a ladyâs maid,
while sheâs got good friends to take care on her till sheâs married to somebody
better nor one oâ them valets, as is neither a common man nor a gentleman, anâ
must live on the fat oâ the land, anâs like enough to stick his hands under his
coat-tails and expect his wife to work for him.â

âAye, aye,â said Mr. Poyser, âwe must have a better husband for her nor that,
and thereâs better at hand. Come, my wench, give over crying and get to bed.
Iâll do better for you nor letting you go for a ladyâs maid. Letâs hear no more
onât.â

When Hetty was gone upstairs he said, âI canna make it out as she should want
to go away, for I thought sheâd got a mind tâ Adam Bede. Sheâs looked like it
oâ late.â

âEh, thereâs no knowing what sheâs got a liking to, for things take no more
hold on her than if she was a dried pea. I believe that gell, Mollyâas is
aggravatinâ enough, for the matter oâ thatâbut I believe sheâd care more about
leaving us and the children, for all sheâs been here but a year come
Michaelmas, nor Hetty would. But sheâs got this notion oâ being a ladyâs maid
wiâ going among them servantsâwe might haâ known what it âud lead to when we
let her go to learn the fine work. But Iâll put a stop to it pretty quick.â

âTheeâdst be sorry to part wiâ her, if it wasnât for her good,â said Mr.
Poyser. âSheâs useful to thee iâ the work.â

âSorry? Yes, Iâm fonder on her nor she deservesâa little hard-hearted hussy,
wanting to leave us iâ that way. I canât haâ had her about me these seven year,
I reckon, and done for her, and taught her everything wiâout caring about her.
Anâ here Iâm having linen spun, anâ thinking all the while itâll make sheeting
and table-clothing for her when sheâs married, anâ sheâll live iâ the parish
wiâ us, and never go out of our sightsâlike a fool as I am for thinking aught
about her, as is no better nor a cherry wiâ a hard stone inside it.â

âNay, nay, thee mustna make much of a trifle,â said Mr. Poyser, soothingly.
âSheâs fond on us, Iâll be bound; but sheâs young, anâ gets things in her head
as she canât rightly give account on. Them young fillies âull run away often
wiâout knowing why.â

Her uncleâs answers, however, had had another effect on Hetty besides that of
disappointing her and making her cry. She knew quite well whom he had in his
mind in his allusions to marriage, and to a sober, solid husband; and when she
was in her bedroom again, the possibility of her marrying Adam presented itself
to her in a new light. In a mind where no strong sympathies are at work, where
there is no supreme sense of right to which the agitated nature can cling and
steady itself to quiet endurance, one of the first results of sorrow is a
desperate vague clutching after any deed that will change the actual condition.
Poor Hettyâs vision of consequences, at no time more than a narrow fantastic
calculation of her own probable pleasures and pains, was now quite shut out by
reckless irritation under present suffering, and she was ready for one of those
convulsive, motiveless actions by which wretched men and women leap from a
temporary sorrow into a lifelong misery.

Why should she not marry Adam? She did not care what she did, so that it made
some change in her life. She felt confident that he would still want to marry
her, and any further thought about Adamâs happiness in the matter had never yet
visited her.

âStrange!â perhaps you will say, âthis rush of impulse towards a course that
might have seemed the most repugnant to her present state of mind, and in only
the second night of her sadness!â

Yes, the actions of a little trivial soul like Hettyâs, struggling amidst the
serious sad destinies of a human being,
are
strange. So are the motions
of a little vessel without ballast tossed about on a stormy sea. How pretty it
looked with its parti-coloured sail in the sunlight, moored in the quiet bay!

âLet that man bear the loss who loosed it from its moorings.â

But that will not save the vesselâthe pretty thing that might have been a
lasting joy.

Chapter XXXII

Mrs. Poyser âHas Her Say Outâ

The next Saturday evening there was much excited discussion at the Donnithorne
Arms concerning an incident which had occurred that very dayâno less than a
second appearance of the smart man in top-boots said by some to be a mere
farmer in treaty for the Chase Farm, by others to be the future steward, but by
Mr. Casson himself, the personal witness to the strangerâs visit, pronounced
contemptuously to be nothing better than a bailiff, such as Satchell had been
before him. No one had thought of denying Mr. Cassonâs testimony to the fact
that he had seen the stranger; nevertheless, he proffered various corroborating
circumstances.

âI see him myself,â he said; âI see him coming along by the Crab-tree Meadow on
a bald-faced hoss. Iâd just been tâ hev a pintâit was half after ten iâ the
fore-noon, when I hev my pint as regâlar as the clockâand I says to Knowles, as
druv up with his waggon, âYouâll get a bit oâ barley to-day, Knowles,â I says,
âif you look about youâ; and then I went round by the rick-yard, and towart the
Treddlesâon road, and just as I come up by the big ash-tree, I see the man iâ
top-boots coming along on a bald-faced hossâI wish I may never stir if I
didnât. And I stood still till he come up, and I says, âGood morning, sir,â I
says, for I wanted to hear the turn of his tongue, as I might know whether he
was a this-country man; so I says, âGood morning, sir: it âll âold hup for the
barley this morning, I think. Thereâll be a bit got hin, if weâve good luck.â
And he says, âEh, ye may be raight, thereâs noo tallinâ,â he says, and I knowed
by thatââhere Mr. Casson gave a winkââas he didnât come from a hundred mile
off. I daresay heâd think me a hodd talker, as you Loamshire folks allays does
hany one as talks the right language.â

âThe right language!â said Bartle Massey, contemptuously. âYouâre about as near
the right language as a pigâs squeaking is like a tune played on a key-bugle.â

âWell, I donât know,â answered Mr. Casson, with an angry smile. âI should think
a man as has lived among the gentry from a by, is likely to know whatâs the
right language pretty nigh as well as a schoolmaster.â

âAy, ay, man,â said Bartle, with a tone of sarcastic consolation, âyou talk the
right language for
you
. When Mike Holdsworthâs goat says ba-a-a, itâs
all rightâit âud be unnatural for it to make any other noise.â

The rest of the party being Loamshire men, Mr. Casson had the laugh strongly
against him, and wisely fell back on the previous question, which, far from
being exhausted in a single evening, was renewed in the churchyard, before
service, the next day, with the fresh interest conferred on all news when there
is a fresh person to hear it; and that fresh hearer was Martin Poyser, who, as
his wife said, ânever went boozinâ with that set at Cassonâs, a-sittinâ soakinâ
in drink, and looking as wise as a lot oâ cod-fish wiâ red faces.â

It was probably owing to the conversation she had had with her husband on their
way from church concerning this problematic stranger that Mrs. Poyserâs
thoughts immediately reverted to him when, a day or two afterwards, as she was
standing at the house-door with her knitting, in that eager leisure which came
to her when the afternoon cleaning was done, she saw the old squire enter the
yard on his black pony, followed by John the groom. She always cited it
afterwards as a case of prevision, which really had something more in it than
her own remarkable penetration, that the moment she set eyes on the squire she
said to herself, âI shouldna wonder if heâs come about that man as is a-going
to take the Chase Farm, wanting Poyser to do something for him without pay. But
Poyserâs a fool if he does.â

Something unwonted must clearly be in the wind, for the old squireâs visits to
his tenantry were rare; and though Mrs. Poyser had during the last twelvemonth
recited many imaginary speeches, meaning even more than met the ear, which she
was quite determined to make to him the next time he appeared within the gates
of the Hall Farm, the speeches had always remained imaginary.

âGood-day, Mrs. Poyser,â said the old squire, peering at her with his
short-sighted eyesâa mode of looking at her which, as Mrs. Poyser observed,
âallays aggravated me: it was as if you was a insect, and he was going to dab
his finger-nail on you.â

However, she said, âYour servant, sir,â and curtsied with an air of perfect
deference as she advanced towards him: she was not the woman to misbehave
towards her betters, and fly in the face of the catechism, without severe
provocation.

âIs your husband at home, Mrs. Poyser?â

âYes, sir; heâs only iâ the rick-yard. Iâll send for him in a minute, if youâll
please to get down and step in.â

âThank you; I will do so. I want to consult him about a little matter; but you
are quite as much concerned in it, if not more. I must have your opinion too.â

âHetty, run and tell your uncle to come in,â said Mrs. Poyser, as they entered
the house, and the old gentleman bowed low in answer to Hettyâs curtsy; while
Totty, conscious of a pinafore stained with gooseberry jam, stood hiding her
face against the clock and peeping round furtively.

âWhat a fine old kitchen this is!â said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round
admiringly. He always spoke in the same deliberate, well-chiselled, polite way,
whether his words were sugary or venomous. âAnd you keep it so exquisitely
clean, Mrs. Poyser. I like these premises, do you know, beyond any on the
estate.â

âWell, sir, since youâre fond of âem, I should be glad if youâd let a bit oâ
repairs be done to âem, for the boardingâs iâ that state as weâre like to be
eaten up wiâ rats and mice; and the cellar, you may stanâ up to your knees iâ
water inât, if you like to go down; but perhaps youâd rather believe my words.
Wonât you please to sit down, sir?â

âNot yet; I must see your dairy. I have not seen it for years, and I hear on
all hands about your fine cheese and butter,â said the squire, looking politely
unconscious that there could be any question on which he and Mrs. Poyser might
happen to disagree. âI think I see the door open, there. You must not be
surprised if I cast a covetous eye on your cream and butter. I donât expect
that Mrs. Satchellâs cream and butter will bear comparison with yours.â

âI canât say, sir, Iâm sure. Itâs seldom I see other folksâs butter, though
thereâs some on it as oneâs no need to seeâthe smellâs enough.â

âAh, now this I like,â said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round at the damp temple
of cleanliness, but keeping near the door. âIâm sure I should like my breakfast
better if I knew the butter and cream came from this dairy. Thank you, that
really is a pleasant sight. Unfortunately, my slight tendency to rheumatism
makes me afraid of damp: Iâll sit down in your comfortable kitchen. Ah, Poyser,
how do you do? In the midst of business, I see, as usual. Iâve been looking at
your wifeâs beautiful dairyâthe best manager in the parish, is she not?â

Mr. Poyser had just entered in shirt-sleeves and open waistcoat, with a face a
shade redder than usual, from the exertion of âpitching.â As he stood, red,
rotund, and radiant, before the small, wiry, cool old gentleman, he looked like
a prize apple by the side of a withered crab.

âWill you please to take this chair, sir?â he said, lifting his fatherâs
arm-chair forward a little: âyouâll find it easy.â

âNo, thank you, I never sit in easy-chairs,â said the old gentleman, seating
himself on a small chair near the door. âDo you know, Mrs. Poyserâsit down,
pray, both of youâIâve been far from contented, for some time, with Mrs.
Satchellâs dairy management. I think she has not a good method, as you have.â

âIndeed, sir, I canât speak to that,â said Mrs. Poyser in a hard voice, rolling
and unrolling her knitting and looking icily out of the window, as she
continued to stand opposite the squire. Poyser might sit down if he liked, she
thought;
she
wasnât going to sit down, as if sheâd give in to any such
smooth-tongued palaver. Mr. Poyser, who looked and felt the reverse of icy, did
sit down in his three-cornered chair.

âAnd now, Poyser, as Satchell is laid up, I am intending to let the Chase Farm
to a respectable tenant. Iâm tired of having a farm on my own handsânothing is
made the best of in such cases, as you know. A satisfactory bailiff is hard to
find; and I think you and I, Poyser, and your excellent wife here, can enter
into a little arrangement in consequence, which will be to our mutual
advantage.â

âOh,â said Mr. Poyser, with a good-natured blankness of imagination as to the
nature of the arrangement.

âIf Iâm called upon to speak, sir,â said Mrs. Poyser, after glancing at her
husband with pity at his softness, âyou know better than me; but I donât see
what the Chase Farm is tâ usâweâve cumber enough wiâ our own farm. Not but what
Iâm glad to hear oâ anybody respectable coming into the parish; thereâs some as
haâ been brought in as hasnât been looked on iâ that character.â

âYouâre likely to find Mr. Thurle an excellent neighbour, I assure youâsuch a
one as you will feel glad to have accommodated by the little plan Iâm going to
mention, especially as I hope you will find it as much to your own advantage as
his.â

âIndeed, sir, if itâs anything tâ our advantage, itâll be the first offer oâ
the sort Iâve heared on. Itâs them as take advantage that get advantage iâ this
world,
I
think: folks have to wait long enough afore itâs brought to
âem.â

âThe fact is, Poyser,â said the squire, ignoring Mrs. Poyserâs theory of
worldly prosperity, âthere is too much dairy land, and too little plough land,
on the Chase Farm to suit Thurleâs purposeâindeed, he will only take the farm
on condition of some change in it: his wife, it appears, is not a clever
dairy-woman, like yours. Now, the plan Iâm thinking of is to effect a little
exchange. If you were to have the Hollow Pastures, you might increase your
dairy, which must be so profitable under your wifeâs management; and I should
request you, Mrs. Poyser, to supply my house with milk, cream, and butter at
the market prices. On the other hand, Poyser, you might let Thurle have the
Lower and Upper Ridges, which really, with our wet seasons, would be a good
riddance for you. There is much less risk in dairy land than corn land.â

Mr. Poyser was leaning forward, with his elbows on his knees, his head on one
side, and his mouth screwed upâapparently absorbed in making the tips of his
fingers meet so as to represent with perfect accuracy the ribs of a ship. He
was much too acute a man not to see through the whole business, and to foresee
perfectly what would be his wifeâs view of the subject; but he disliked giving
unpleasant answers. Unless it was on a point of farming practice, he would
rather give up than have a quarrel, any day; and, after all, it mattered more
to his wife than to him. So, after a few momentsâ silence, he looked up at her
and said mildly, âWhat dost say?â

Mrs. Poyser had had her eyes fixed on her husband with cold severity during his
silence, but now she turned away her head with a toss, looked icily at the
opposite roof of the cow-shed, and spearing her knitting together with the
loose pin, held it firmly between her clasped hands.

âSay? Why, I say you may do as you like about giving up any oâ your corn-land
afore your lease is up, which it wonât be for a year come next Michaelmas, but
Iâll not consent to take more dairy work into my hands, either for love or
money; and thereâs nayther love nor money here, as I can see, onây other
folksâs love oâ theirselves, and the money as is to go into other folksâs
pockets. I know thereâs them as is born tâ own the land, and them as is born to
sweat onâtââhere Mrs. Poyser paused to gasp a littleââand I know itâs
christened folksâs duty to submit to their betters as fur as flesh and blood
âull bear it; but Iâll not make a martyr oâ myself, and wear myself to skin and
bone, and worret myself as if I was a churn wiâ butter a-coming inât, for no
landlord in England, not if he was King George himself.â

âNo, no, my dear Mrs. Poyser, certainly not,â said the squire, still confident
in his own powers of persuasion, âyou must not overwork yourself; but donât you
think your work will rather be lessened than increased in this way? There is so
much milk required at the Abbey that you will have little increase of cheese
and butter making from the addition to your dairy; and I believe selling the
milk is the most profitable way of disposing of dairy produce, is it not?â

âAye, thatâs true,â said Mr. Poyser, unable to repress an opinion on a question
of farming profits, and forgetting that it was not in this case a purely
abstract question.

âI daresay,â said Mrs. Poyser bitterly, turning her head half-way towards her
husband and looking at the vacant arm-chairââI daresay itâs true for men as sit
iâ thâ chimney-corner and make believe as everythingâs cut wiâ ins anâ outs to
fit intâ everything else. If you could make a pudding wiâ thinking oâ the
batter, it âud be easy getting dinner. How do I know whether the milk âull be
wanted constant? Whatâs to make me sure as the house wonât be put oâ board wage
afore weâre many months older, and then I may have to lie awake oâ nights wiâ
twenty gallons oâ milk on my mindâand Dingall âull take no more butter, let
alone paying for it; and we must fat pigs till weâre obliged to beg the butcher
on our knees to buy âem, and lose half of âem wiâ the measles. And thereâs the
fetching and carrying, as âud be welly half a dayâs work for a man anâ
hossâ
thatâs
to be took out oâ the profits, I reckon? But thereâs folks
âud hold a sieve under the pump and expect to carry away the water.â

âThat difficultyâabout the fetching and carryingâyou will not have, Mrs.
Poyser,â said the squire, who thought that this entrance into particulars
indicated a distant inclination to compromise on Mrs. Poyserâs part. âBethell
will do that regularly with the cart and pony.â

âOh, sir, begging your pardon, Iâve never been used tâ having gentlefolksâs
servants coming about my back places, a-making love to both the gells at once
and keeping âem with their hands on their hips listening to all manner oâ
gossip when they should be down on their knees a-scouring. If weâre to go to
ruin, it shanna be wiâ having our back kitchen turned into a public.â

âWell, Poyser,â said the squire, shifting his tactics and looking as if he
thought Mrs. Poyser had suddenly withdrawn from the proceedings and left the
room, âyou can turn the Hollows into feeding-land. I can easily make another
arrangement about supplying my house. And I shall not forget your readiness to
accommodate your landlord as well as a neighbour. I know you will be glad to
have your lease renewed for three years, when the present one expires;
otherwise, I daresay Thurle, who is a man of some capital, would be glad to
take both the farms, as they could be worked so well together. But I donât want
to part with an old tenant like you.â

To be thrust out of the discussion in this way would have been enough to
complete Mrs. Poyserâs exasperation, even without the final threat. Her
husband, really alarmed at the possibility of their leaving the old place where
he had been bred and bornâfor he believed the old squire had small spite enough
for anythingâwas beginning a mild remonstrance explanatory of the inconvenience
he should find in having to buy and sell more stock, with, âWell, sir, I think
as itâs rether hard...â when Mrs. Poyser burst in with the desperate
determination to have her say out this once, though it were to rain notices to
quit and the only shelter were the work-house.

âThen, sir, if I may speakâas, for all Iâm a woman, and thereâs folks as thinks
a womanâs fool enough to stanâ by anâ look on while the men sign her soul away,
Iâve a right to speak, for I make one quarter oâ the rent, and save another
quarterâI say, if Mr. Thurleâs so ready to take farms under you, itâs a pity
but what he should take this, and see if he likes to live in a house wiâ all
the plagues oâ Egypt inâtâwiâ the cellar full oâ water, and frogs and toads
hoppinâ up the steps by dozensâand the floors rotten, and the rats and mice
gnawing every bit oâ cheese, and runninâ over our heads as we lie iâ bed till
we expect âem to eat us up aliveâas itâs a mercy they hanna eat the children
long ago. I should like to see if thereâs another tenant besides Poyser as âud
put up wiâ never having a bit oâ repairs done till a place tumbles downâand not
then, onây wiâ begging and praying and having to pay halfâand being strung up
wiâ the rent as itâs much if he gets enough out oâ the land to pay, for all
heâs put his own money into the ground beforehand. See if youâll get a stranger
to lead such a life here as that: a maggot must be born iâ the rotten cheese to
like it, I reckon. You may run away from my words, sir,â continued Mrs. Poyser,
following the old squire beyond the doorâfor after the first moments of stunned
surprise he had got up, and, waving his hand towards her with a smile, had
walked out towards his pony. But it was impossible for him to get away
immediately, for John was walking the pony up and down the yard, and was some
distance from the causeway when his master beckoned.

âYou may run away from my words, sir, and you may go spinninâ underhand ways oâ
doing us a mischief, for youâve got Old Harry to your friend, though nobody
else is, but I tell you for once as weâre not dumb creatures to be abused and
made money on by them as haâ got the lash iâ their hands, for want oâ knowing
how tâ undo the tackle. Anâ if Iâm thâ only one as speaks my mind, thereâs
plenty oâ the same way oâ thinking iâ this parish and the next to ât, for your
nameâs no better than a brimstone match in everybodyâs noseâif it isna
two-three old folks as you think oâ saving your soul by giving âem a bit oâ
flannel and a drop oâ porridge. Anâ you may be right iâ thinking itâll take but
little to save your soul, for itâll be the smallest savinâ yâ iver made, wiâ
all your scrapinâ.â

There are occasions on which two servant-girls and a waggoner may be a
formidable audience, and as the squire rode away on his black pony, even the
gift of short-sightedness did not prevent him from being aware that Molly and
Nancy and Tim were grinning not far from him. Perhaps he suspected that sour
old John was grinning behind himâwhich was also the fact. Meanwhile the
bull-dog, the black-and-tan terrier, Alickâs sheep-dog, and the gander hissing
at a safe distance from the ponyâs heels carried out the idea of Mrs. Poyserâs
solo in an impressive quartet.

Mrs. Poyser, however, had no sooner seen the pony move off than she turned
round, gave the two hilarious damsels a look which drove them into the back
kitchen, and unspearing her knitting, began to knit again with her usual
rapidity as she re-entered the house.

âTheeâst done it now,â said Mr. Poyser, a little alarmed and uneasy, but not
without some triumphant amusement at his wifeâs outbreak.

âYes, I know Iâve done it,â said Mrs. Poyser; âbut Iâve had my say out, and I
shall be thâ easier forât all my life. Thereâs no pleasure iâ living if youâre
to be corked up for ever, and only dribble your mind out by the sly, like a
leaky barrel. I shanât repent saying what I think, if I live to be as old as
thâ old squire; and thereâs little likelihoodâfor it seems as if them as arenât
wanted here are thâ only folks as arenât wanted iâ thâ other world.â

âBut thee wutna like moving from thâ old place, this Michaelmas twelvemonth,â
said Mr. Poyser, âand going into a strange parish, where thee knowâst nobody.
Itâll be hard upon us both, and upoâ Father too.â

âEh, itâs no use worreting; thereâs plenty oâ things may happen between this
and Michaelmas twelvemonth. The captain may be master afore then, for what we
know,â said Mrs. Poyser, inclined to take an unusually hopeful view of an
embarrassment which had been brought about by her own merit and not by other
peopleâs fault.

â
Iâm
none for worreting,â said Mr. Poyser, rising from his
three-cornered chair and walking slowly towards the door; âbut I should be
loath to leave thâ old place, and the parish where I was bred and born, and
Father afore me. We should leave our roots behind us, I doubt, and niver thrive
again.â

The barley was all carried at last, and the harvest suppers went by without
waiting for the dismal black crop of beans. The apples and nuts were gathered
and stored; the scent of whey departed from the farm-houses, and the scent of
brewing came in its stead. The woods behind the Chase, and all the hedgerow
trees, took on a solemn splendour under the dark low-hanging skies. Michaelmas
was come, with its fragrant basketfuls of purple damsons, and its paler purple
daisies, and its lads and lasses leaving or seeking service and winding along
between the yellow hedges, with their bundles under their arms. But though
Michaelmas was come, Mr. Thurle, that desirable tenant, did not come to the
Chase Farm, and the old squire, after all, had been obliged to put in a new
bailiff. It was known throughout the two parishes that the squireâs plan had
been frustrated because the Poysers had refused to be âput upon,â and Mrs.
Poyserâs outbreak was discussed in all the farm-houses with a zest which was
only heightened by frequent repetition. The news that âBonyâ was come back from
Egypt was comparatively insipid, and the repulse of the French in Italy was
nothing to Mrs. Poyserâs repulse of the old squire. Mr. Irwine had heard a
version of it in every parishionerâs house, with the one exception of the
Chase. But since he had always, with marvellous skill, avoided any quarrel with
Mr. Donnithorne, he could not allow himself the pleasure of laughing at the old
gentlemanâs discomfiture with any one besides his mother, who declared that if
she were rich she should like to allow Mrs. Poyser a pension for life, and
wanted to invite her to the parsonage that she might hear an account of the
scene from Mrs. Poyserâs own lips.

âNo, no, Mother,â said Mr. Irwine; âit was a little bit of irregular justice on
Mrs. Poyserâs part, but a magistrate like me must not countenance irregular
justice. There must be no report spread that I have taken notice of the
quarrel, else I shall lose the little good influence I have over the old man.â

âWell, I like that woman even better than her cream-cheeses,â said Mrs. Irwine.
âShe has the spirit of three men, with that pale face of hers. And she says
such sharp things too.â

âSharp! Yes, her tongue is like a new-set razor. Sheâs quite original in her
talk too; one of those untaught wits that help to stock a country with
proverbs. I told you that capital thing I heard her say about Craigâthat he was
like a cock, who thought the sun had risen to hear him crow. Now thatâs an
Ãsopâs fable in a sentence.â

âBut it will be a bad business if the old gentleman turns them out of the farm
next Michaelmas, eh?â said Mrs. Irwine.

âOh, that must not be; and Poyser is such a good tenant that Donnithorne is
likely to think twice, and digest his spleen rather than turn them out. But if
he should give them notice at Lady Day, Arthur and I must move heaven and earth
to mollify him. Such old parishioners as they are must not go.â

âAh, thereâs no knowing what may happen before Lady day,â said Mrs. Irwine. âIt
struck me on Arthurâs birthday that the old man was a little shaken: heâs
eighty-three, you know. Itâs really an unconscionable age. Itâs only women who
have a right to live as long as that.â

âWhen theyâve got old-bachelor sons who would be forlorn without them,â said
Mr. Irwine, laughing, and kissing his motherâs hand.

Mrs. Poyser, too, met her husbandâs occasional forebodings of a notice to quit
with âThereâs no knowing what may happen before Lady dayââone of those
undeniable general propositions which are usually intended to convey a
particular meaning very far from undeniable. But it is really too hard upon
human nature that it should be held a criminal offence to imagine the death
even of the king when he is turned eighty-three. It is not to be believed that
any but the dullest Britons can be good subjects under that hard condition.

Apart from this foreboding, things went on much as usual in the Poyser
household. Mrs. Poyser thought she noticed a surprising improvement in Hetty.
To be sure, the girl got âcloser tempered, and sometimes she seemed as if
thereâd be no drawing a word from her with cart-ropes,â but she thought much
less about her dress, and went after the work quite eagerly, without any
telling. And it was wonderful how she never wanted to go out nowâindeed, could
hardly be persuaded to go; and she bore her auntâs putting a stop to her weekly
lesson in fine-work at the Chase without the least grumbling or pouting. It
must be, after all, that she had set her heart on Adam at last, and her sudden
freak of wanting to be a ladyâs maid must have been caused by some little pique
or misunderstanding between them, which had passed by. For whenever Adam came
to the Hall Farm, Hetty seemed to be in better spirits and to talk more than at
other times, though she was almost sullen when Mr. Craig or any other admirer
happened to pay a visit there.

Adam himself watched her at first with trembling anxiety, which gave way to
surprise and delicious hope. Five days after delivering Arthurâs letter, he had
ventured to go to the Hall Farm againânot without dread lest the sight of him
might be painful to her. She was not in the house-place when he entered, and he
sat talking to Mr. and Mrs. Poyser for a few minutes with a heavy fear on his
heart that they might presently tell him Hetty was ill. But by and by there
came a light step that he knew, and when Mrs. Poyser said, âCome, Hetty, where
have you been?â Adam was obliged to turn round, though he was afraid to see the
changed look there must be in her face. He almost started when he saw her
smiling as if she were pleased to see himâlooking the same as ever at a first
glance, only that she had her cap on, which he had never seen her in before
when he came of an evening. Still, when he looked at her again and again as she
moved about or sat at her work, there was a change: the cheeks were as pink as
ever, and she smiled as much as she had ever done of late, but there was
something different in her eyes, in the expression of her face, in all her
movements, Adam thoughtâsomething harder, older, less child-like. âPoor thing!â
he said to himself, âthatâs allays likely. Itâs because sheâs had her first
heartache. But sheâs got a spirit to bear up under it. Thank God for that.â

As the weeks went by, and he saw her always looking pleased to see himâturning
up her lovely face towards him as if she meant him to understand that she was
glad for him to comeâand going about her work in the same equable way, making
no sign of sorrow, he began to believe that her feeling towards Arthur must
have been much slighter than he had imagined in his first indignation and
alarm, and that she had been able to think of her girlish fancy that Arthur was
in love with her and would marry her as a folly of which she was timely cured.
And it perhaps was, as he had sometimes in his more cheerful moments hoped it
would beâher heart was really turning with all the more warmth towards the man
she knew to have a serious love for her.

Possibly you think that Adam was not at all sagacious in his interpretations,
and that it was altogether extremely unbecoming in a sensible man to behave as
he didâfalling in love with a girl who really had nothing more than her beauty
to recommend her, attributing imaginary virtues to her, and even condescending
to cleave to her after she had fallen in love with another man, waiting for her
kind looks as a patient trembling dog waits for his masterâs eye to be turned
upon him. But in so complex a thing as human nature, we must consider, it is
hard to find rules without exceptions. Of course, I know that, as a rule,
sensible men fall in love with the most sensible women of their acquaintance,
see through all the pretty deceits of coquettish beauty, never imagine
themselves loved when they are not loved, cease loving on all proper occasions,
and marry the woman most fitted for them in every respectâindeed, so as to
compel the approbation of all the maiden ladies in their neighbourhood. But
even to this rule an exception will occur now and then in the lapse of
centuries, and my friend Adam was one. For my own part, however, I respect him
none the lessânay, I think the deep love he had for that sweet, rounded,
blossom-like, dark-eyed Hetty, of whose inward self he was really very
ignorant, came out of the very strength of his nature and not out of any
inconsistent weakness. Is it any weakness, pray, to be wrought on by exquisite
music? To feel its wondrous harmonies searching the subtlest windings of your
soul, the delicate fibres of life where no memory can penetrate, and binding
together your whole being past and present in one unspeakable vibration,
melting you in one moment with all the tenderness, all the love that has been
scattered through the toilsome years, concentrating in one emotion of heroic
courage or resignation all the hard-learnt lessons of self-renouncing sympathy,
blending your present joy with past sorrow and your present sorrow with all
your past joy? If not, then neither is it a weakness to be so wrought upon by
the exquisite curves of a womanâs cheek and neck and arms, by the liquid depths
of her beseeching eyes, or the sweet childish pout of her lips. For the beauty
of a lovely woman is like music: what can one say more? Beauty has an
expression beyond and far above the one womanâs soul that it clothes, as the
words of genius have a wider meaning than the thought that prompted them. It is
more than a womanâs love that moves us in a womanâs eyesâit seems to be a
far-off mighty love that has come near to us, and made speech for itself there;
the rounded neck, the dimpled arm, move us by something more than their
prettinessâby their close kinship with all we have known of tenderness and
peace. The noblest nature sees the most of this
impersonal
expression in
beauty (it is needless to say that there are gentlemen with whiskers dyed and
undyed who see none of it whatever), and for this reason, the noblest nature is
often the most blinded to the character of the one womanâs soul that the beauty
clothes. Whence, I fear, the tragedy of human life is likely to continue for a
long time to come, in spite of mental philosophers who are ready with the best
receipts for avoiding all mistakes of the kind.

Our good Adam had no fine words into which he could put his feeling for Hetty:
he could not disguise mystery in this way with the appearance of knowledge; he
called his love frankly a mystery, as you have heard him. He only knew that the
sight and memory of her moved him deeply, touching the spring of all love and
tenderness, all faith and courage within him. How could he imagine narrowness,
selfishness, hardness in her? He created the mind he believed in out of his
own, which was large, unselfish, tender.

The hopes he felt about Hetty softened a little his feeling towards Arthur.
Surely his attentions to Hetty must have been of a slight kind; they were
altogether wrong, and such as no man in Arthurâs position ought to have allowed
himself, but they must have had an air of playfulness about them, which had
probably blinded him to their danger and had prevented them from laying any
strong hold on Hettyâs heart. As the new promise of happiness rose for Adam,
his indignation and jealousy began to die out. Hetty was not made unhappy; he
almost believed that she liked him best; and the thought sometimes crossed his
mind that the friendship which had once seemed dead for ever might revive in
the days to come, and he would not have to say âgood-byeâ to the grand old
woods, but would like them better because they were Arthurâs. For this new
promise of happiness following so quickly on the shock of pain had an
intoxicating effect on the sober Adam, who had all his life been used to much
hardship and moderate hope. Was he really going to have an easy lot after all?
It seemed so, for at the beginning of November, Jonathan Burge, finding it
impossible to replace Adam, had at last made up his mind to offer him a share
in the business, without further condition than that he should continue to give
his energies to it and renounce all thought of having a separate business of
his own. Son-in-law or no son-in-law, Adam had made himself too necessary to be
parted with, and his headwork was so much more important to Burge than his
skill in handicraft that his having the management of the woods made little
difference in the value of his services; and as to the bargains about the
squireâs timber, it would be easy to call in a third person. Adam saw here an
opening into a broadening path of prosperous work such as he had thought of
with ambitious longing ever since he was a lad: he might come to build a
bridge, or a town hall, or a factory, for he had always said to himself that
Jonathan Burgeâs building business was like an acorn, which might be the mother
of a great tree. So he gave his hand to Burge on that bargain, and went home
with his mind full of happy visions, in which (my refined reader will perhaps
be shocked when I say it) the image of Hetty hovered, and smiled over plans for
seasoning timber at a trifling expense, calculations as to the cheapening of
bricks per thousand by water-carriage, and a favourite scheme for the
strengthening of roofs and walls with a peculiar form of iron girder. What
then? Adamâs enthusiasm lay in these things; and our love is inwrought in our
enthusiasm as electricity is inwrought in the air, exalting its power by a
subtle presence.

Adam would be able to take a separate house now, and provide for his mother in
the old one; his prospects would justify his marrying very soon, and if Dinah
consented to have Seth, their mother would perhaps be more contented to live
apart from Adam. But he told himself that he would not be hastyâhe would not
try Hettyâs feeling for him until it had had time to grow strong and firm.
However, tomorrow, after church, he would go to the Hall Farm and tell them the
news. Mr. Poyser, he knew, would like it better than a five-pound note, and he
should see if Hettyâs eyes brightened at it. The months would be short with all
he had to fill his mind, and this foolish eagerness which had come over him of
late must not hurry him into any premature words. Yet when he got home and told
his mother the good news, and ate his supper, while she sat by almost crying
for joy and wanting him to eat twice as much as usual because of this
good-luck, he could not help preparing her gently for the coming change by
talking of the old house being too small for them all to go on living in it
always.

It was a dry Sunday, and really a pleasant day for the 2d of November. There
was no sunshine, but the clouds were high, and the wind was so still that the
yellow leaves which fluttered down from the hedgerow elms must have fallen from
pure decay. Nevertheless, Mrs. Poyser did not go to church, for she had taken a
cold too serious to be neglected; only two winters ago she had been laid up for
weeks with a cold; and since his wife did not go to church, Mr. Poyser
considered that on the whole it would be as well for him to stay away too and
âkeep her company.â He could perhaps have given no precise form to the reasons
that determined this conclusion, but it is well known to all experienced minds
that our firmest convictions are often dependent on subtle impressions for
which words are quite too coarse a medium. However it was, no one from the
Poyser family went to church that afternoon except Hetty and the boys; yet Adam
was bold enough to join them after church, and say that he would walk home with
them, though all the way through the village he appeared to be chiefly occupied
with Marty and Tommy, telling them about the squirrels in Binton Coppice, and
promising to take them there some day. But when they came to the fields he said
to the boys, âNow, then, which is the stoutest walker? Him as gets to thâ
home-gate first shall be the first to go with me to Binton Coppice on the
donkey. But Tommy must have the start up to the next stile, because heâs the
smallest.â

Adam had never behaved so much like a determined lover before. As soon as the
boys had both set off, he looked down at Hetty and said, âWonât you hang on my
arm, Hetty?â in a pleading tone, as if he had already asked her and she had
refused. Hetty looked up at him smilingly and put her round arm through his in
a moment. It was nothing to her, putting her arm through Adamâs, but she knew
he cared a great deal about having her arm through his, and she wished him to
care. Her heart beat no faster, and she looked at the half-bare hedgerows and
the ploughed field with the same sense of oppressive dulness as before. But
Adam scarcely felt that he was walking. He thought Hetty must know that he was
pressing her arm a littleâa very little. Words rushed to his lips that he dared
not utterâthat he had made up his mind not to utter yetâand so he was silent
for the length of that field. The calm patience with which he had once waited
for Hettyâs love, content only with her presence and the thought of the future,
had forsaken him since that terrible shock nearly three months ago. The
agitations of jealousy had given a new restlessness to his passionâhad made
fear and uncertainty too hard almost to bear. But though he might not speak to
Hetty of his love, he would tell her about his new prospects and see if she
would be pleased. So when he was enough master of himself to talk, he said,
âIâm going to tell your uncle some news thatâll surprise him, Hetty; and I
think heâll be glad to hear it too.â

âWhatâs that?â Hetty said indifferently.

âWhy, Mr. Burge has offered me a share in his business, and Iâm going to take
it.â

There was a change in Hettyâs face, certainly not produced by any agreeable
impression from this news. In fact she felt a momentary annoyance and alarm,
for she had so often heard it hinted by her uncle that Adam might have Mary
Burge and a share in the business any day, if he liked, that she associated the
two objects now, and the thought immediately occurred that perhaps Adam had
given her up because of what had happened lately, and had turned towards Mary
Burge. With that thought, and before she had time to remember any reasons why
it could not be true, came a new sense of forsakenness and disappointment. The
one thingâthe one personâher mind had rested on in its dull weariness, had
slipped away from her, and peevish misery filled her eyes with tears. She was
looking on the ground, but Adam saw her face, saw the tears, and before he had
finished saying, âHetty, dear Hetty, what are you crying for?â his eager rapid
thought had flown through all the causes conceivable to him, and had at last
alighted on half the true one. Hetty thought he was going to marry Mary
Burgeâshe didnât like him to marryâperhaps she didnât like him to marry any one
but herself? All caution was swept awayâall reason for it was gone, and Adam
could feel nothing but trembling joy. He leaned towards her and took her hand,
as he said:

âI could afford to be married now, HettyâI could make a wife comfortable; but I
shall never want to be married if you wonât have me.â

Hetty looked up at him and smiled through her tears, as she had done to Arthur
that first evening in the wood, when she had thought he was not coming, and yet
he came. It was a feebler relief, a feebler triumph she felt now, but the great
dark eyes and the sweet lips were as beautiful as ever, perhaps more beautiful,
for there was a more luxuriant womanliness about Hetty of late. Adam could
hardly believe in the happiness of that moment. His right hand held her left,
and he pressed her arm close against his heart as he leaned down towards her.

âDo you really love me, Hetty? Will you be my own wife, to love and take care
of as long as I live?â

Hetty did not speak, but Adamâs face was very close to hers, and she put up her
round cheek against his, like a kitten. She wanted to be caressedâshe wanted to
feel as if Arthur were with her again.

Adam cared for no words after that, and they hardly spoke through the rest of
the walk. He only said, âI may tell your uncle and aunt, maynât I, Hetty?â and
she said, âYes.â

The red fire-light on the hearth at the Hall Farm shone on joyful faces that
evening, when Hetty was gone upstairs and Adam took the opportunity of telling
Mr. and Mrs. Poyser and the grandfather that he saw his way to maintaining a
wife now, and that Hetty had consented to have him.

âI hope you have no objections against me for her husband,â said Adam; âIâm a
poor man as yet, but she shall want nothing as I can work for.â

âObjections?â said Mr. Poyser, while the grandfather leaned forward and brought
out his long âNay, nay.â âWhat objections can we haâ to you, lad? Never mind
your being poorish as yet; thereâs money in your head-piece as thereâs money iâ
the sown field, but it must haâ time. Youân got enough to begin on, and we can
do a deal towârt the bit oâ furniture youâll want. Theeâst got feathers and
linen to spareâplenty, eh?â

This question was of course addressed to Mrs. Poyser, who was wrapped up in a
warm shawl and was too hoarse to speak with her usual facility. At first she
only nodded emphatically, but she was presently unable to resist the temptation
to be more explicit.

âIt ud be a poor tale if I hadna feathers and linen,â she said, hoarsely, âwhen
I never sell a fowl but whatâs plucked, and the wheelâs a-going every day oâ
the week.â

âCome, my wench,â said Mr. Poyser, when Hetty came down, âcome and kiss us, and
let us wish you luck.â

Hetty went very quietly and kissed the big good-natured man.

âThere!â he said, patting her on the back, âgo and kiss your aunt and your
grandfather. Iâm as wishful tâ have you settled well as if you was my own
daughter; and soâs your aunt, Iâll be bound, for sheâs done by you this seven
âear, Hetty, as if youâd been her own. Come, come, now,â he went on, becoming
jocose, as soon as Hetty had kissed her aunt and the old man, âAdam wants a
kiss too, Iâll warrant, and heâs a right to one now.â

Hetty turned away, smiling, towards her empty chair.

âCome, Adam, then, take one,â persisted Mr. Poyser, âelse yâ arena half a man.â

Adam got up, blushing like a small maidenâgreat strong fellow as he wasâand,
putting his arm round Hetty stooped down and gently kissed her lips.

It was a pretty scene in the red fire-light; for there were no candlesâwhy
should there be, when the fire was so bright and was reflected from all the
pewter and the polished oak? No one wanted to work on a Sunday evening. Even
Hetty felt something like contentment in the midst of all this love. Adamâs
attachment to her, Adamâs caress, stirred no passion in her, were no longer
enough to satisfy her vanity, but they were the best her life offered her
nowâthey promised her some change.

There was a great deal of discussion before Adam went away, about the
possibility of his finding a house that would do for him to settle in. No house
was empty except the one next to Will Maskeryâs in the village, and that was
too small for Adam now. Mr. Poyser insisted that the best plan would be for
Seth and his mother to move and leave Adam in the old home, which might be
enlarged after a while, for there was plenty of space in the woodyard and
garden; but Adam objected to turning his mother out.

âWell, well,â said Mr. Poyser at last, âwe needna fix everything to-night. We
must take time to consider. You canna think oâ getting married afore Easter.
Iâm not for long courtships, but there must be a bit oâ time to make things
comfortable.â

âAye, to be sure,â said Mrs. Poyser, in a hoarse whisper; âChristian folks
canât be married like cuckoos, I reckon.â

âIâm a bit daunted, though,â said Mr. Poyser, âwhen I think as we may have
notice to quit, and belike be forced to take a farm twenty mile off.â

âEh,â said the old man, staring at the floor and lifting his hands up and down,
while his arms rested on the elbows of his chair, âitâs a poor tale if I mun
leave thâ ould spot an be buried in a strange parish. Anâ youâll happen haâ
double rates to pay,â he added, looking up at his son.

âWell, thee mustna fret beforehand, father,â said Martin the younger. âHappen
the captain âull come home and make our peace wiâ thâ old squire. I build upoâ
that, for I know the captain âll see folks righted if he can.â

Chapter XXXV

The Hidden Dread

It was a busy time for Adamâthe time between the beginning of November and the
beginning of February, and he could see little of Hetty, except on Sundays. But
a happy time, nevertheless, for it was taking him nearer and nearer to March,
when they were to be married, and all the little preparations for their new
housekeeping marked the progress towards the longed-for day. Two new rooms had
been ârun upâ to the old house, for his mother and Seth were to live with them
after all. Lisbeth had cried so piteously at the thought of leaving Adam that
he had gone to Hetty and asked her if, for the love of him, she would put up
with his motherâs ways and consent to live with her. To his great delight,
Hetty said, âYes; Iâd as soon she lived with us as not.â Hettyâs mind was
oppressed at that moment with a worse difficulty than poor Lisbethâs ways; she
could not care about them. So Adam was consoled for the disappointment he had
felt when Seth had come back from his visit to Snowfield and said âit was no
useâDinahâs heart wasna turned towards marrying.â For when he told his mother
that Hetty was willing they should all live together and there was no more need
of them to think of parting, she said, in a more contented tone than he had
heard her speak in since it had been settled that he was to be married, âEh, my
lad, Iâll be as still as thâ ould tabby, anâ neâer want to do aught but thâ
offal work, as
she
wonna like tâ do. Anâ then we needna part the
platters anâ things, as haâ stood on the shelf together sinâ afore thee wast
born.â

There was only one cloud that now and then came across Adamâs sunshine: Hetty
seemed unhappy sometimes. But to all his anxious, tender questions, she replied
with an assurance that she was quite contented and wished nothing different;
and the next time he saw her she was more lively than usual. It might be that
she was a little overdone with work and anxiety now, for soon after Christmas
Mrs. Poyser had taken another cold, which had brought on inflammation, and this
illness had confined her to her room all through January. Hetty had to manage
everything downstairs, and half-supply Mollyâs place too, while that good
damsel waited on her mistress, and she seemed to throw herself so entirely into
her new functions, working with a grave steadiness which was new in her, that
Mr. Poyser often told Adam she was wanting to show him what a good housekeeper
he would have; but he âdoubted the lass was oâerdoing itâshe must have a bit oâ
rest when her aunt could come downstairs.â

This desirable event of Mrs. Poyserâs coming downstairs happened in the early
part of February, when some mild weather thawed the last patch of snow on the
Binton Hills. On one of these days, soon after her aunt came down, Hetty went
to Treddleston to buy some of the wedding things which were wanting, and which
Mrs. Poyser had scolded her for neglecting, observing that she supposed âit was
because they were not for thâ outside, else sheâd haâ bought âem fast enough.â

It was about ten oâclock when Hetty set off, and the slight hoar-frost that had
whitened the hedges in the early morning had disappeared as the sun mounted the
cloudless sky. Bright February days have a stronger charm of hope about them
than any other days in the year. One likes to pause in the mild rays of the
sun, and look over the gates at the patient plough-horses turning at the end of
the furrow, and think that the beautiful year is all before one. The birds seem
to feel just the same: their notes are as clear as the clear air. There are no
leaves on the trees and hedgerows, but how green all the grassy fields are! And
the dark purplish brown of the ploughed earth and of the bare branches is
beautiful too. What a glad world this looks like, as one drives or rides along
the valleys and over the hills! I have often thought so when, in foreign
countries, where the fields and woods have looked to me like our English
Loamshireâthe rich land tilled with just as much care, the woods rolling down
the gentle slopes to the green meadowsâI have come on something by the roadside
which has reminded me that I am not in Loamshire: an image of a great agonyâthe
agony of the Cross. It has stood perhaps by the clustering apple-blossoms, or
in the broad sunshine by the cornfield, or at a turning by the wood where a
clear brook was gurgling below; and surely, if there came a traveller to this
world who knew nothing of the story of manâs life upon it, this image of agony
would seem to him strangely out of place in the midst of this joyous nature. He
would not know that hidden behind the apple-blossoms, or among the golden corn,
or under the shrouding boughs of the wood, there might be a human heart beating
heavily with anguishâperhaps a young blooming girl, not knowing where to turn
for refuge from swift-advancing shame, understanding no more of this life of
ours than a foolish lost lamb wandering farther and farther in the nightfall on
the lonely heath, yet tasting the bitterest of lifeâs bitterness.

Such things are sometimes hidden among the sunny fields and behind the
blossoming orchards; and the sound of the gurgling brook, if you came close to
one spot behind a small bush, would be mingled for your ear with a despairing
human sob. No wonder manâs religion has much sorrow in it: no wonder he needs a
suffering God.

Hetty, in her red cloak and warm bonnet, with her basket in her hand, is
turning towards a gate by the side of the Treddleston road, but not that she
may have a more lingering enjoyment of the sunshine and think with hope of the
long unfolding year. She hardly knows that the sun is shining; and for weeks,
now, when she has hoped at all, it has been for something at which she herself
trembles and shudders. She only wants to be out of the high-road, that she may
walk slowly and not care how her face looks, as she dwells on wretched
thoughts; and through this gate she can get into a field-path behind the wide
thick hedgerows. Her great dark eyes wander blankly over the fields like the
eyes of one who is desolate, homeless, unloved, not the promised bride of a
brave tender man. But there are no tears in them: her tears were all wept away
in the weary night, before she went to sleep. At the next stile the pathway
branches off: there are two roads before herâone along by the hedgerow, which
will by and by lead her into the road again, the other across the fields, which
will take her much farther out of the way into the Scantlands, low shrouded
pastures where she will see nobody. She chooses this and begins to walk a
little faster, as if she had suddenly thought of an object towards which it was
worth while to hasten. Soon she is in the Scantlands, where the grassy land
slopes gradually downwards, and she leaves the level ground to follow the
slope. Farther on there is a clump of trees on the low ground, and she is
making her way towards it. No, it is not a clump of trees, but a dark shrouded
pool, so full with the wintry rains that the under boughs of the elder-bushes
lie low beneath the water. She sits down on the grassy bank, against the
stooping stem of the great oak that hangs over the dark pool. She has thought
of this pool often in the nights of the month that has just gone by, and now at
last she is come to see it. She clasps her hands round her knees, and leans
forward, and looks earnestly at it, as if trying to guess what sort of bed it
would make for her young round limbs.

No, she has not courage to jump into that cold watery bed, and if she had, they
might find herâthey might find out why she had drowned herself. There is but
one thing left to her: she must go away, go where they canât find her.

After the first on-coming of her great dread, some weeks after her betrothal to
Adam, she had waited and waited, in the blind vague hope that something would
happen to set her free from her terror; but she could wait no longer. All the
force of her nature had been concentrated on the one effort of concealment, and
she had shrunk with irresistible dread from every course that could tend
towards a betrayal of her miserable secret. Whenever the thought of writing to
Arthur had occurred to her, she had rejected it. He could do nothing for her
that would shelter her from discovery and scorn among the relatives and
neighbours who once more made all her world, now her airy dream had vanished.
Her imagination no longer saw happiness with Arthur, for he could do nothing
that would satisfy or soothe her pride. No, something else would
happenâsomething
must
happenâto set her free from this dread. In young,
childish, ignorant souls there is constantly this blind trust in some unshapen
chance: it is as hard to a boy or girl to believe that a great wretchedness
will actually befall them as to believe that they will die.

But now necessity was pressing hard upon herânow the time of her marriage was
close at handâshe could no longer rest in this blind trust. She must run away;
she must hide herself where no familiar eyes could detect her; and then the
terror of wandering out into the world, of which she knew nothing, made the
possibility of going to Arthur a thought which brought some comfort with it.
She felt so helpless now, so unable to fashion the future for herself, that the
prospect of throwing herself on him had a relief in it which was stronger than
her pride. As she sat by the pool and shuddered at the dark cold water, the
hope that he would receive her tenderlyâthat he would care for her and think
for herâwas like a sense of lulling warmth, that made her for the moment
indifferent to everything else; and she began now to think of nothing but the
scheme by which she should get away.

She had had a letter from Dinah lately, full of kind words about the coming
marriage, which she had heard of from Seth; and when Hetty had read this letter
aloud to her uncle, he had said, âI wish Dinah âud come again now, for sheâd be
a comfort to your aunt when youâre gone. What do you think, my wench, oâ going
to see her as soon as you can be spared and persuading her to come back wiâ
you? You might happen persuade her wiâ telling her as her aunt wants her, for
all she writes oâ not being able to come.â Hetty had not liked the thought of
going to Snowfield, and felt no longing to see Dinah, so she only said, âItâs
so far off, Uncle.â But now she thought this proposed visit would serve as a
pretext for going away. She would tell her aunt when she got home again that
she should like the change of going to Snowfield for a week or ten days. And
then, when she got to Stoniton, where nobody knew her, she would ask for the
coach that would take her on the way to Windsor. Arthur was at Windsor, and she
would go to him.

As soon as Hetty had determined on this scheme, she rose from the grassy bank
of the pool, took up her basket, and went on her way to Treddleston, for she
must buy the wedding things she had come out for, though she would never want
them. She must be careful not to raise any suspicion that she was going to run
away.

Mrs. Poyser was quite agreeably surprised that Hetty wished to go and see Dinah
and try to bring her back to stay over the wedding. The sooner she went the
better, since the weather was pleasant now; and Adam, when he came in the
evening, said, if Hetty could set off to-morrow, he would make time to go with
her to Treddleston and see her safe into the Stoniton coach.

âI wish I could go with you and take care of you, Hetty,â he said, the next
morning, leaning in at the coach door; âbut you wonât stay much beyond a
weekâthe time âull seem long.â

He was looking at her fondly, and his strong hand held hers in its grasp. Hetty
felt a sense of protection in his presenceâshe was used to it now: if she could
have had the past undone and known no other love than her quiet liking for
Adam! The tears rose as she gave him the last look.

âGod bless her for loving me,â said Adam, as he went on his way to work again,
with Gyp at his heels.

But Hettyâs tears were not for Adamânot for the anguish that would come upon
him when he found she was gone from him for ever. They were for the misery of
her own lot, which took her away from this brave tender man who offered up his
whole life to her, and threw her, a poor helpless suppliant, on the man who
would think it a misfortune that she was obliged to cling to him.

At three oâclock that day, when Hetty was on the coach that was to take her,
they said, to Leicesterâpart of the long, long way to Windsorâshe felt dimly
that she might be travelling all this weary journey towards the beginning of
new misery.

Yet Arthur was at Windsor; he would surely not be angry with her. If he did not
mind about her as he used to do, he had promised to be good to her.

Book Fifth

Chapter XXXVI

The Journey of Hope

A long, lonely journey, with sadness in the heart; away from the familiar to
the strange: that is a hard and dreary thing even to the rich, the strong, the
instructed; a hard thing, even when we are called by duty, not urged by dread.

What was it then to Hetty? With her poor narrow thoughts, no longer melting
into vague hopes, but pressed upon by the chill of definite fear, repeating
again and again the same small round of memoriesâshaping again and again the
same childish, doubtful images of what was to comeâseeing nothing in this wide
world but the little history of her own pleasures and pains; with so little
money in her pocket, and the way so long and difficult. Unless she could afford
always to go in the coachesâand she felt sure she could not, for the journey to
Stoniton was more expensive than she had expectedâit was plain that she must
trust to carriersâ carts or slow waggons; and what a time it would be before
she could get to the end of her journey! The burly old coachman from Oakbourne,
seeing such a pretty young woman among the outside passengers, had invited her
to come and sit beside him; and feeling that it became him as a man and a
coachman to open the dialogue with a joke, he applied himself as soon as they
were off the stones to the elaboration of one suitable in all respects. After
many cuts with his whip and glances at Hetty out of the corner of his eye, he
lifted his lips above the edge of his wrapper and said, âHeâs pretty nigh six
foot, Iâll be bound, isna he, now?â

âWho?â said Hetty, rather startled.

âWhy, the sweetheart as youâve left behind, or else him as youâre goinâ
arterâwhich is it?â

Hetty felt her face flushing and then turning pale. She thought this coachman
must know something about her. He must know Adam, and might tell him where she
was gone, for it is difficult to country people to believe that those who make
a figure in their own parish are not known everywhere else, and it was equally
difficult to Hetty to understand that chance words could happen to apply
closely to her circumstances. She was too frightened to speak.

âHegh, hegh!â said the coachman, seeing that his joke was not so gratifying as
he had expected, âyou munna take it too serâous; if heâs behaved ill, get
another. Such a pretty lass as you can get a sweetheart any day.â

Hettyâs fear was allayed by and by, when she found that the coachman made no
further allusion to her personal concerns; but it still had the effect of
preventing her from asking him what were the places on the road to Windsor. She
told him she was only going a little way out of Stoniton, and when she got down
at the inn where the coach stopped, she hastened away with her basket to
another part of the town. When she had formed her plan of going to Windsor, she
had not foreseen any difficulties except that of getting away, and after she
had overcome this by proposing the visit to Dinah, her thoughts flew to the
meeting with Arthur and the question how he would behave to herânot resting on
any probable incidents of the journey. She was too entirely ignorant of
traveling to imagine any of its details, and with all her store of moneyâher
three guineasâin her pocket, she thought herself amply provided. It was not
until she found how much it cost her to get to Stoniton that she began to be
alarmed about the journey, and then, for the first time, she felt her ignorance
as to the places that must be passed on her way. Oppressed with this new alarm,
she walked along the grim Stoniton streets, and at last turned into a shabby
little inn, where she hoped to get a cheap lodging for the night. Here she
asked the landlord if he could tell her what places she must go to, to get to
Windsor.

âWell, I canât rightly say. Windsor must be pretty nigh London, for itâs where
the king lives,â was the answer. âAnyhow, youâd best go tâ Ashby nextâthatâs
southâard. But thereâs as many places from here to London as thereâs houses in
Stoniton, by what I can make out. Iâve never been no traveller myself. But how
comes a lone young woman like you to be thinking oâ taking such a journey as
that?â

âIâm going to my brotherâheâs a soldier at Windsor,â said Hetty, frightened at
the landlordâs questioning look. âI canât afford to go by the coach; do you
think thereâs a cart goes toward Ashby in the morning?â

âYes, there may be carts if anybody knowed where they started from; but you
might run over the town before you found out. Youâd best set off and walk, and
trust to summat overtaking you.â

Every word sank like lead on Hettyâs spirits; she saw the journey stretch bit
by bit before her now. Even to get to Ashby seemed a hard thing: it might take
the day, for what she knew, and that was nothing to the rest of the journey.
But it must be doneâshe must get to Arthur. Oh, how she yearned to be again
with somebody who would care for her! She who had never got up in the morning
without the certainty of seeing familiar faces, people on whom she had an
acknowledged claim; whose farthest journey had been to Rosseter on the pillion
with her uncle; whose thoughts had always been taking holiday in dreams of
pleasure, because all the business of her life was managed for herâthis
kittenlike Hetty, who till a few months ago had never felt any other grief than
that of envying Mary Burge a new ribbon, or being girded at by her aunt for
neglecting Totty, must now make her toilsome way in loneliness, her peaceful
home left behind for ever, and nothing but a tremulous hope of distant refuge
before her. Now for the first time, as she lay down to-night in the strange
hard bed, she felt that her home had been a happy one, that her uncle had been
very good to her, that her quiet lot at Hayslope among the things and people
she knew, with her little pride in her one best gown and bonnet, and nothing to
hide from any one, was what she would like to wake up to as a reality, and find
that all the feverish life she had known besides was a short nightmare. She
thought of all she had left behind with yearning regret for her own sake. Her
own misery filled her heartâthere was no room in it for other peopleâs sorrow.
And yet, before the cruel letter, Arthur had been so tender and loving. The
memory of that had still a charm for her, though it was no more than a soothing
draught that just made pain bearable. For Hetty could conceive no other
existence for herself in future than a hidden one, and a hidden life, even with
love, would have had no delights for her; still less a life mingled with shame.
She knew no romances, and had only a feeble share in the feelings which are the
source of romance, so that well-read ladies may find it difficult to understand
her state of mind. She was too ignorant of everything beyond the simple notions
and habits in which she had been brought up to have any more definite idea of
her probable future than that Arthur would take care of her somehow, and
shelter her from anger and scorn. He would not marry her and make her a lady;
and apart from that she could think of nothing he could give towards which she
looked with longing and ambition.

The next morning she rose early, and taking only some milk and bread for her
breakfast, set out to walk on the road towards Ashby, under a leaden-coloured
sky, with a narrowing streak of yellow, like a departing hope, on the edge of
the horizon. Now in her faintness of heart at the length and difficulty of her
journey, she was most of all afraid of spending her money, and becoming so
destitute that she would have to ask peopleâs charity; for Hetty had the pride
not only of a proud nature but of a proud classâthe class that pays the most
poor-rates, and most shudders at the idea of profiting by a poor-rate. It had
not yet occurred to her that she might get money for her locket and earrings
which she carried with her, and she applied all her small arithmetic and
knowledge of prices to calculating how many meals and how many rides were
contained in her two guineas, and the odd shillings, which had a melancholy
look, as if they were the pale ashes of the other bright-flaming coin.

For the first few miles out of Stoniton, she walked on bravely, always fixing
on some tree or gate or projecting bush at the most distant visible point in
the road as a goal, and feeling a faint joy when she had reached it. But when
she came to the fourth milestone, the first she had happened to notice among
the long grass by the roadside, and read that she was still only four miles
beyond Stoniton, her courage sank. She had come only this little way, and yet
felt tired, and almost hungry again in the keen morning air; for though Hetty
was accustomed to much movement and exertion indoors, she was not used to long
walks which produced quite a different sort of fatigue from that of household
activity. As she was looking at the milestone she felt some drops falling on
her faceâit was beginning to rain. Here was a new trouble which had not entered
into her sad thoughts before, and quite weighed down by this sudden addition to
her burden, she sat down on the step of a stile and began to sob hysterically.
The beginning of hardship is like the first taste of bitter foodâit seems for a
moment unbearable; yet, if there is nothing else to satisfy our hunger, we take
another bite and find it possible to go on. When Hetty recovered from her burst
of weeping, she rallied her fainting courage: it was raining, and she must try
to get on to a village where she might find rest and shelter. Presently, as she
walked on wearily, she heard the rumbling of heavy wheels behind her; a covered
waggon was coming, creeping slowly along with a slouching driver cracking his
whip beside the horses. She waited for it, thinking that if the waggoner were
not a very sour-looking man, she would ask him to take her up. As the waggon
approached her, the driver had fallen behind, but there was something in the
front of the big vehicle which encouraged her. At any previous moment in her
life she would not have noticed it, but now, the new susceptibility that
suffering had awakened in her caused this object to impress her strongly. It
was only a small white-and-liver-coloured spaniel which sat on the front ledge
of the waggon, with large timid eyes, and an incessant trembling in the body,
such as you may have seen in some of these small creatures. Hetty cared little
for animals, as you know, but at this moment she felt as if the helpless timid
creature had some fellowship with her, and without being quite aware of the
reason, she was less doubtful about speaking to the driver, who now came
forwardâa large ruddy man, with a sack over his shoulders, by way of scarf or
mantle.

âCould you take me up in your waggon, if youâre going towards Ashby?â said
Hetty. âIâll pay you for it.â

âAw,â said the big fellow, with that slowly dawning smile which belongs to
heavy faces, âI can take yâ up fawst enough wiâout beinâ paid forât if you
dooant mind lyinâ a bit closish a-top oâ the wool-packs. Where do you coom
from? And what do you want at Ashby?â

âI come from Stoniton. Iâm going a long wayâto Windsor.â

âWhat! Arter some service, or what?â

âGoing to my brotherâheâs a soldier there.â

âWell, Iâm going no furder nor Leicesterâand fur enough tooâbut Iâll take you,
if you dooant mind being a bit long on the road. Thâ hosses wooant feel

your
weight no more nor they feel the little doog there, as I puck up on
the road a fortniât agoo. He war lost, I bâlieve, anâs been all of a tremble
iver sinâ. Come, giâ us your basket anâ come behind and let me put yâ in.â

To lie on the wool-packs, with a cranny left between the curtains of the awning
to let in the air, was luxury to Hetty now, and she half-slept away the hours
till the driver came to ask her if she wanted to get down and have âsome
victualâ; he himself was going to eat his dinner at this âpublic.â Late at
night they reached Leicester, and so this second day of Hettyâs journey was
past. She had spent no money except what she had paid for her food, but she
felt that this slow journeying would be intolerable for her another day, and in
the morning she found her way to a coach-office to ask about the road to
Windsor, and see if it would cost her too much to go part of the distance by
coach again. Yes! The distance was too greatâthe coaches were too dearâshe must
give them up; but the elderly clerk at the office, touched by her pretty
anxious face, wrote down for her the names of the chief places she must pass
through. This was the only comfort she got in Leicester, for the men stared at
her as she went along the street, and for the first time in her life Hetty
wished no one would look at her. She set out walking again; but this day she
was fortunate, for she was soon overtaken by a carrierâs cart which carried her
to Hinckley, and by the help of a return chaise, with a drunken postilionâwho
frightened her by driving like Jehu the son of Nimshi, and shouting hilarious
remarks at her, twisting himself backwards on his saddleâshe was before night
in the heart of woody Warwickshire: but still almost a hundred miles from
Windsor, they told her. Oh what a large world it was, and what hard work for
her to find her way in it! She went by mistake to Stratford-on-Avon, finding
Stratford set down in her list of places, and then she was told she had come a
long way out of the right road. It was not till the fifth day that she got to
Stony Stratford. That seems but a slight journey as you look at the map, or
remember your own pleasant travels to and from the meadowy banks of the Avon.
But how wearily long it was to Hetty! It seemed to her as if this country of
flat fields, and hedgerows, and dotted houses, and villages, and
market-townsâall so much alike to her indifferent eyesâmust have no end, and
she must go on wandering among them for ever, waiting tired at toll-gates for
some cart to come, and then finding the cart went only a little wayâa very
little wayâto the millerâs a mile off perhaps; and she hated going into the
public houses, where she must go to get food and ask questions, because there
were always men lounging there, who stared at her and joked her rudely. Her
body was very weary too with these days of new fatigue and anxiety; they had
made her look more pale and worn than all the time of hidden dread she had gone
through at home. When at last she reached Stony Stratford, her impatience and
weariness had become too strong for her economical caution; she determined to
take the coach for the rest of the way, though it should cost her all her
remaining money. She would need nothing at Windsor but to find Arthur. When she
had paid the fare for the last coach, she had only a shilling; and as she got
down at the sign of the Green Man in Windsor at twelve oâclock in the middle of
the seventh day, hungry and faint, the coachman came up, and begged her to
âremember him.â She put her hand in her pocket and took out the shilling, but
the tears came with the sense of exhaustion and the thought that she was giving
away her last means of getting food, which she really required before she could
go in search of Arthur. As she held out the shilling, she lifted up her dark
tear-filled eyes to the coachmanâs face and said, âCan you give me back
sixpence?â

âNo, no,â he said, gruffly, ânever mindâput the shilling up again.â

The landlord of the Green Man had stood near enough to witness this scene, and
he was a man whose abundant feeding served to keep his good nature, as well as
his person, in high condition. And that lovely tearful face of Hettyâs would
have found out the sensitive fibre in most men.

âCome, young woman, come in,â he said, âand have a drop oâ something; youâre
pretty well knocked up, I can see that.â

He took her into the bar and said to his wife, âHere, missis, take this young
woman into the parlour; sheâs a little overcomeââfor Hettyâs tears were falling
fast. They were merely hysterical tears: she thought she had no reason for
weeping now, and was vexed that she was too weak and tired to help it. She was
at Windsor at last, not far from Arthur.

She looked with eager, hungry eyes at the bread and meat and beer that the
landlady brought her, and for some minutes she forgot everything else in the
delicious sensations of satisfying hunger and recovering from exhaustion. The
landlady sat opposite to her as she ate, and looked at her earnestly. No
wonder: Hetty had thrown off her bonnet, and her curls had fallen down. Her
face was all the more touching in its youth and beauty because of its weary
look, and the good womanâs eyes presently wandered to her figure, which in her
hurried dressing on her journey she had taken no pains to conceal; moreover,
the strangerâs eye detects what the familiar unsuspecting eye leaves unnoticed.

âWhy, youâre not very fit for travelling,â she said, glancing while she spoke
at Hettyâs ringless hand. âHave you come far?â

âYes,â said Hetty, roused by this question to exert more self-command, and
feeling the better for the food she had taken. âIâve come a good long way, and
itâs very tiring. But Iâm better now. Could you tell me which way to go to this
place?â Here Hetty took from her pocket a bit of paper: it was the end of
Arthurâs letter on which he had written his address.

While she was speaking, the landlord had come in and had begun to look at her
as earnestly as his wife had done. He took up the piece of paper which Hetty
handed across the table, and read the address.

âWhy, what do you want at this house?â he said. It is in the nature of
innkeepers and all men who have no pressing business of their own to ask as
many questions as possible before giving any information.

âI want to see a gentleman as is there,â said Hetty.

âBut thereâs no gentleman there,â returned the landlord. âItâs shut upâbeen
shut up this fortnight. What gentleman is it you want? Perhaps I can let you
know where to find him.â

âItâs Captain Donnithorne,â said Hetty tremulously, her heart beginning to beat
painfully at this disappointment of her hope that she should find Arthur at
once.

âCaptain Donnithorne? Stop a bit,â said the landlord, slowly. âWas he in the
Loamshire Militia? A tall young officer with a fairish skin and reddish
whiskersâand had a servant by the name oâ Pym?â

âOh yes,â said Hetty; âyou know himâwhere is he?â

âA fine sight oâ miles away from here. The Loamshire Militiaâs gone to Ireland;
itâs been gone this fortnight.â

âLook there! Sheâs fainting,â said the landlady, hastening to support Hetty,
who had lost her miserable consciousness and looked like a beautiful corpse.
They carried her to the sofa and loosened her dress.

âHereâs a bad business, I suspect,â said the landlord, as he brought in some
water.

âAh, itâs plain enough what sort of business it is,â said the wife. âSheâs not
a common flaunting dratchell, I can see that. She looks like a respectable
country girl, and she comes from a good way off, to judge by her tongue. She
talks something like that ostler we had that come from the north. He was as
honest a fellow as we ever had about the houseâtheyâre all honest folks in the
north.â

âI never saw a prettier young woman in my life,â said the husband. âSheâs like
a pictur in a shop-winder. It goes to oneâs âeart to look at her.â

âIt âud have been a good deal better for her if sheâd been uglier and had more
conduct,â said the landlady, who on any charitable construction must have been
supposed to have more âconductâ than beauty. âBut sheâs coming to again. Fetch
a drop more water.â

Chapter XXXVII

The Journey in Despair

Hetty was too ill through the rest of that day for any questions to be
addressed to herâtoo ill even to think with any distinctness of the evils that
were to come. She only felt that all her hope was crushed, and that instead of
having found a refuge she had only reached the borders of a new wilderness
where no goal lay before her. The sensations of bodily sickness, in a
comfortable bed, and with the tendance of the good-natured landlady, made a
sort of respite for her; such a respite as there is in the faint weariness
which obliges a man to throw himself on the sand instead of toiling onward
under the scorching sun.

But when sleep and rest had brought back the strength necessary for the
keenness of mental sufferingâwhen she lay the next morning looking at the
growing light which was like a cruel task-master returning to urge from her a
fresh round of hated hopeless labourâshe began to think what course she must
take, to remember that all her money was gone, to look at the prospect of
further wandering among strangers with the new clearness shed on it by the
experience of her journey to Windsor. But which way could she turn? It was
impossible for her to enter into any service, even if she could obtain it.
There was nothing but immediate beggary before her. She thought of a young
woman who had been found against the church wall at Hayslope one Sunday, nearly
dead with cold and hungerâa tiny infant in her arms. The woman was rescued and
taken to the parish. âThe parish!â You can perhaps hardly understand the effect
of that word on a mind like Hettyâs, brought up among people who were somewhat
hard in their feelings even towards poverty, who lived among the fields, and
had little pity for want and rags as a cruel inevitable fate such as they
sometimes seem in cities, but held them a mark of idleness and viceâand it was
idleness and vice that brought burdens on the parish. To Hetty the âparishâ was
next to the prison in obloquy, and to ask anything of strangersâto begâlay in
the same far-off hideous region of intolerable shame that Hetty had all her
life thought it impossible she could ever come near. But now the remembrance of
that wretched woman whom she had seen herself, on her way from church, being
carried into Joshua Rannâs, came back upon her with the new terrible sense that
there was very little now to divide
her
from the same lot. And the dread
of bodily hardship mingled with the dread of shame; for Hetty had the luxurious
nature of a round soft-coated pet animal.

How she yearned to be back in her safe home again, cherished and cared for as
she had always been! Her auntâs scolding about trifles would have been music to
her ears now; she longed for it; she used to hear it in a time when she had
only trifles to hide. Could she be the same Hetty that used to make up the
butter in the dairy with the Guelder roses peeping in at the windowâshe, a
runaway whom her friends would not open their doors to again, lying in this
strange bed, with the knowledge that she had no money to pay for what she
received, and must offer those strangers some of the clothes in her basket? It
was then she thought of her locket and ear-rings, and seeing her pocket lie
near, she reached it and spread the contents on the bed before her. There were
the locket and ear-rings in the little velvet-lined boxes, and with them there
was a beautiful silver thimble which Adam had bought her, the words âRemember
meâ making the ornament of the border; a steel purse, with her one shilling in
it; and a small red-leather case, fastening with a strap. Those beautiful
little ear-rings, with their delicate pearls and garnet, that she had tried in
her ears with such longing in the bright sunshine on the 30th of July! She had
no longing to put them in her ears now: her head with its dark rings of hair
lay back languidly on the pillow, and the sadness that rested about her brow
and eyes was something too hard for regretful memory. Yet she put her hands up
to her ears: it was because there were some thin gold rings in them, which were
also worth a little money. Yes, she could surely get some money for her
ornaments: those Arthur had given her must have cost a great deal of money. The
landlord and landlady had been good to her; perhaps they would help her to get
the money for these things.

But this money would not keep her long. What should she do when it was gone?
Where should she go? The horrible thought of want and beggary drove her once to
think she would go back to her uncle and aunt and ask them to forgive her and
have pity on her. But she shrank from that idea again, as she might have shrunk
from scorching metal. She could never endure that shame before her uncle and
aunt, before Mary Burge, and the servants at the Chase, and the people at
Broxton, and everybody who knew her. They should never know what had happened
to her. What
could
she do? She would go away from Windsorâtravel again
as she had done the last week, and get among the flat green fields with the
high hedges round them, where nobody could see her or know her; and there,
perhaps, when there was nothing else she could do, she should get courage to
drown herself in some pond like that in the Scantlands. Yes, she would get away
from Windsor as soon as possible: she didnât like these people at the inn to
know about her, to know that she had come to look for Captain Donnithorne. She
must think of some reason to tell them why she had asked for him.

With this thought she began to put the things back into her pocket, meaning to
get up and dress before the landlady came to her. She had her hand on the
red-leather case, when it occurred to her that there might be something in this
case which she had forgottenâsomething worth selling; for without knowing what
she should do with her life, she craved the means of living as long as
possible; and when we desire eagerly to find something, we are apt to search
for it in hopeless places. No, there was nothing but common needles and pins,
and dried tulip-petals between the paper leaves where she had written down her
little money-accounts. But on one of these leaves there was a name, which,
often as she had seen it before, now flashed on Hettyâs mind like a newly
discovered message. The name wasâ
Dinah Morris, Snowfield
. There was a
text above it, written, as well as the name, by Dinahâs own hand with a little
pencil, one evening that they were sitting together and Hetty happened to have
the red case lying open before her. Hetty did not read the text now: she was
only arrested by the name. Now, for the first time, she remembered without
indifference the affectionate kindness Dinah had shown her, and those words of
Dinah in the bed-chamberâthat Hetty must think of her as a friend in trouble.
Suppose she were to go to Dinah, and ask her to help her? Dinah did not think
about things as other people did. She was a mystery to Hetty, but Hetty knew
she was always kind. She couldnât imagine Dinahâs face turning away from her in
dark reproof or scorn, Dinahâs voice willingly speaking ill of her, or
rejoicing in her misery as a punishment. Dinah did not seem to belong to that
world of Hettyâs, whose glance she dreaded like scorching fire. But even to her
Hetty shrank from beseeching and confession. She could not prevail on herself
to say, âI will go to Dinahâ: she only thought of that as a possible
alternative, if she had not courage for death.

The good landlady was amazed when she saw Hetty come downstairs soon after
herself, neatly dressed, and looking resolutely self-possessed. Hetty told her
she was quite well this morning. She had only been very tired and overcome with
her journey, for she had come a long way to ask about her brother, who had run
away, and they thought he was gone for a soldier, and Captain Donnithorne might
know, for he had been very kind to her brother once. It was a lame story, and
the landlady looked doubtfully at Hetty as she told it; but there was a
resolute air of self-reliance about her this morning, so different from the
helpless prostration of yesterday, that the landlady hardly knew how to make a
remark that might seem like prying into other peopleâs affairs. She only
invited her to sit down to breakfast with them, and in the course of it Hetty
brought out her ear-rings and locket, and asked the landlord if he could help
her to get money for them. Her journey, she said, had cost her much more than
she expected, and now she had no money to get back to her friends, which she
wanted to do at once.

It was not the first time the landlady had seen the ornaments, for she had
examined the contents of Hettyâs pocket yesterday, and she and her husband had
discussed the fact of a country girl having these beautiful things, with a
stronger conviction than ever that Hetty had been miserably deluded by the fine
young officer.

âWell,â said the landlord, when Hetty had spread the precious trifles before
him, âwe might take âem to the jewellerâs shop, for thereâs one not far off;
but Lord bless you, they wouldnât give you a quarter oâ what the things are
worth. And you wouldnât like to part with âem?â he added, looking at her
inquiringly.

âOh, I donât mind,â said Hetty, hastily, âso as I can get money to go back.â

âAnd they might think the things were stolen, as you wanted to sell âem,â he
went on, âfor it isnât usual for a young woman like you to have fine jewâllery
like that.â

The blood rushed to Hettyâs face with anger. âI belong to respectable folks,â
she said; âIâm not a thief.â

âNo, that you arenât, Iâll be bound,â said the landlady; âand youâd no call to
say that,â looking indignantly at her husband. âThe things were gev to her:
thatâs plain enough to be seen.â

âI didnât mean as I thought so,â said the husband, apologetically, âbut I said
it was what the jeweller might think, and so he wouldnât be offering much money
for âem.â

âWell,â said the wife, âsuppose you were to advance some money on the things
yourself, and then if she liked to redeem âem when she got home, she could. But
if we heard nothing from her after two months, we might do as we liked with
âem.â

I will not say that in this accommodating proposition the landlady had no
regard whatever to the possible reward of her good nature in the ultimate
possession of the locket and ear-rings: indeed, the effect they would have in
that case on the mind of the grocerâs wife had presented itself with remarkable
vividness to her rapid imagination. The landlord took up the ornaments and
pushed out his lips in a meditative manner. He wished Hetty well, doubtless;
but pray, how many of your well-wishers would decline to make a little gain out
of you? Your landlady is sincerely affected at parting with you, respects you
highly, and will really rejoice if any one else is generous to you; but at the
same time she hands you a bill by which she gains as high a percentage as
possible.

âHow much money do you want to get home with, young woman?â said the
well-wisher, at length.

âThree guineas,â answered Hetty, fixing on the sum she set out with, for want
of any other standard, and afraid of asking too much.

âWell, Iâve no objections to advance you three guineas,â said the landlord;
âand if you like to send it me back and get the jewellery again, you can, you
know. The Green Man isnât going to run away.â

âOh yes, Iâll be very glad if youâll give me that,â said Hetty, relieved at the
thought that she would not have to go to the jewellerâs and be stared at and
questioned.

âBut if you want the things again, youâll write before long,â said the
landlady, âbecause when two months are up, we shall make up our minds as you
donât want âem.â

âYes,â said Hetty indifferently.

The husband and wife were equally content with this arrangement. The husband
thought, if the ornaments were not redeemed, he could make a good thing of it
by taking them to London and selling them. The wife thought she would coax the
good man into letting her keep them. And they were accommodating Hetty, poor
thingâa pretty, respectable-looking young woman, apparently in a sad case. They
declined to take anything for her food and bed: she was quite welcome. And at
eleven oâclock Hetty said âGood-byeâ to them with the same quiet, resolute air
she had worn all the morning, mounting the coach that was to take her twenty
miles back along the way she had come.

There is a strength of self-possession which is the sign that the last hope has
departed. Despair no more leans on others than perfect contentment, and in
despair pride ceases to be counteracted by the sense of dependence.

Hetty felt that no one could deliver her from the evils that would make life
hateful to her; and no one, she said to herself, should ever know her misery
and humiliation. No; she would not confess even to Dinah. She would wander out
of sight, and drown herself where her body would never be found, and no one
should know what had become of her.

When she got off this coach, she began to walk again, and take cheap rides in
carts, and get cheap meals, going on and on without distinct purpose, yet
strangely, by some fascination, taking the way she had come, though she was
determined not to go back to her own country. Perhaps it was because she had
fixed her mind on the grassy Warwickshire fields, with the bushy tree-studded
hedgerows that made a hiding-place even in this leafless season. She went more
slowly than she came, often getting over the stiles and sitting for hours under
the hedgerows, looking before her with blank, beautiful eyes; fancying herself
at the edge of a hidden pool, low down, like that in the Scantlands; wondering
if it were very painful to be drowned, and if there would be anything worse
after death than what she dreaded in life. Religious doctrines had taken no
hold on Hettyâs mind. She was one of those numerous people who have had
godfathers and godmothers, learned their catechism, been confirmed, and gone to
church every Sunday, and yet, for any practical result of strength in life, or
trust in death, have never appropriated a single Christian idea or Christian
feeling. You would misunderstand her thoughts during these wretched days, if
you imagined that they were influenced either by religious fears or religious
hopes.

She chose to go to Stratford-on-Avon again, where she had gone before by
mistake, for she remembered some grassy fields on her former way towards
itâfields among which she thought she might find just the sort of pool she had
in her mind. Yet she took care of her money still; she carried her basket;
death seemed still a long way off, and life was so strong in her. She craved
food and restâshe hastened towards them at the very moment she was picturing to
herself the bank from which she would leap towards death. It was already five
days since she had left Windsor, for she had wandered about, always avoiding
speech or questioning looks, and recovering her air of proud self-dependence
whenever she was under observation, choosing her decent lodging at night, and
dressing herself neatly in the morning, and setting off on her way steadily, or
remaining under shelter if it rained, as if she had a happy life to cherish.

And yet, even in her most self-conscious moments, the face was sadly different
from that which had smiled at itself in the old specked glass, or smiled at
others when they glanced at it admiringly. A hard and even fierce look had come
in the eyes, though their lashes were as long as ever, and they had all their
dark brightness. And the cheek was never dimpled with smiles now. It was the
same rounded, pouting, childish prettiness, but with all love and belief in
love departed from itâthe sadder for its beauty, like that wondrous
Medusa-face, with the passionate, passionless lips.

At last she was among the fields she had been dreaming of, on a long narrow
pathway leading towards a wood. If there should be a pool in that wood! It
would be better hidden than one in the fields. No, it was not a wood, only a
wild brake, where there had once been gravel-pits, leaving mounds and hollows
studded with brushwood and small trees. She roamed up and down, thinking there
was perhaps a pool in every hollow before she came to it, till her limbs were
weary, and she sat down to rest. The afternoon was far advanced, and the leaden
sky was darkening, as if the sun were setting behind it. After a little while
Hetty started up again, feeling that darkness would soon come on; and she must
put off finding the pool till to-morrow, and make her way to some shelter for
the night. She had quite lost her way in the fields, and might as well go in
one direction as another, for aught she knew. She walked through field after
field, and no village, no house was in sight; but
there
, at the corner
of this pasture, there was a break in the hedges; the land seemed to dip down a
little, and two trees leaned towards each other across the opening. Hettyâs
heart gave a great beat as she thought there must be a pool there. She walked
towards it heavily over the tufted grass, with pale lips and a sense of
trembling. It was as if the thing were come in spite of herself, instead of
being the object of her search.

There it was, black under the darkening sky: no motion, no sound near. She set
down her basket, and then sank down herself on the grass, trembling. The pool
had its wintry depth now: by the time it got shallow, as she remembered the
pools did at Hayslope, in the summer, no one could find out that it was her
body. But then there was her basketâshe must hide that too. She must throw it
into the waterâmake it heavy with stones first, and then throw it in. She got
up to look about for stones, and soon brought five or six, which she laid down
beside her basket, and then sat down again. There was no need to hurryâthere
was all the night to drown herself in. She sat leaning her elbow on the basket.
She was weary, hungry. There were some buns in her basketâthree, which she had
supplied herself with at the place where she ate her dinner. She took them out
now and ate them eagerly, and then sat still again, looking at the pool. The
soothed sensation that came over her from the satisfaction of her hunger, and
this fixed dreamy attitude, brought on drowsiness, and presently her head sank
down on her knees. She was fast asleep.

When she awoke it was deep night, and she felt chill. She was frightened at
this darknessâfrightened at the long night before her. If she
could
but
throw herself into the water! No, not yet. She began to walk about that she
might get warm again, as if she would have more resolution then. Oh how long
the time was in that darkness! The bright hearth and the warmth and the voices
of home, the secure uprising and lying down, the familiar fields, the familiar
people, the Sundays and holidays with their simple joys of dress and
feastingâall the sweets of her young life rushed before her now, and she seemed
to be stretching her arms towards them across a great gulf. She set her teeth
when she thought of Arthur. She cursed him, without knowing what her cursing
would do. She wished he too might know desolation, and cold, and a life of
shame that he dared not end by death.

The horror of this cold, and darkness, and solitudeâout of all human
reachâbecame greater every long minute. It was almost as if she were dead
already, and knew that she was dead, and longed to get back to life again. But
no: she was alive still; she had not taken the dreadful leap. She felt a
strange contradictory wretchedness and exultation: wretchedness, that she did
not dare to face death; exultation, that she was still in lifeâthat she might
yet know light and warmth again. She walked backwards and forwards to warm
herself, beginning to discern something of the objects around her, as her eyes
became accustomed to the nightâthe darker line of the hedge, the rapid motion
of some living creatureâperhaps a field-mouseârushing across the grass. She no
longer felt as if the darkness hedged her in. She thought she could walk back
across the field, and get over the stile; and then, in the very next field, she
thought she remembered there was a hovel of furze near a sheepfold. If she
could get into that hovel, she would be warmer. She could pass the night there,
for that was what Alick did at Hayslope in lambing-time. The thought of this
hovel brought the energy of a new hope. She took up her basket and walked
across the field, but it was some time before she got in the right direction
for the stile. The exercise and the occupation of finding the stile were a
stimulus to her, however, and lightened the horror of the darkness and
solitude. There were sheep in the next field, and she startled a group as she
set down her basket and got over the stile; and the sound of their movement
comforted her, for it assured her that her impression was rightâthis
was

the field where she had seen the hovel, for it was the field where the sheep
were. Right on along the path, and she would get to it. She reached the
opposite gate, and felt her way along its rails and the rails of the
sheep-fold, till her hand encountered the pricking of the gorsy wall. Delicious
sensation! She had found the shelter. She groped her way, touching the prickly
gorse, to the door, and pushed it open. It was an ill-smelling close place, but
warm, and there was straw on the ground. Hetty sank down on the straw with a
sense of escape. Tears cameâshe had never shed tears before since she left
Windsorâtears and sobs of hysterical joy that she had still hold of life, that
she was still on the familiar earth, with the sheep near her. The very
consciousness of her own limbs was a delight to her: she turned up her sleeves,
and kissed her arms with the passionate love of life. Soon warmth and weariness
lulled her in the midst of her sobs, and she fell continually into dozing,
fancying herself at the brink of the pool againâfancying that she had jumped
into the water, and then awaking with a start, and wondering where she was. But
at last deep dreamless sleep came; her head, guarded by her bonnet, found a
pillow against the gorsy wall, and the poor soul, driven to and fro between two
equal terrors, found the one relief that was possible to itâthe relief of
unconsciousness.

Alas! That relief seems to end the moment it has begun. It seemed to Hetty as
if those dozen dreams had only passed into another dreamâthat she was in the
hovel, and her aunt was standing over her with a candle in her hand. She
trembled under her auntâs glance, and opened her eyes. There was no candle, but
there was light in the hovelâthe light of early morning through the open door.
And there was a face looking down on her; but it was an unknown face, belonging
to an elderly man in a smock-frock.

âWhy, what do you do here, young woman?â the man said roughly.

Hetty trembled still worse under this real fear and shame than she had done in
her momentary dream under her auntâs glance. She felt that she was like a
beggar alreadyâfound sleeping in that place. But in spite of her trembling, she
was so eager to account to the man for her presence here, that she found words
at once.

âI lost my way,â she said. âIâm travellingânorthâard, and I got away from the
road into the fields, and was overtaken by the dark. Will you tell me the way
to the nearest village?â

She got up as she was speaking, and put her hands to her bonnet to adjust it,
and then laid hold of her basket.

The man looked at her with a slow bovine gaze, without giving her any answer,
for some seconds. Then he turned away and walked towards the door of the hovel,
but it was not till he got there that he stood still, and, turning his shoulder
half-round towards her, said, âAw, I can show you the way to Norton, if you
like. But what do you do gettinâ out oâ the highroad?â he added, with a tone of
gruff reproof. âYâull be gettinâ into mischief, if you dooant mind.â

âYes,â said Hetty, âI wonât do it again. Iâll keep in the road, if youâll be so
good as show me how to get to it.â

âWhy dooant you keep where thereâs a finger-poasses anâ folks to ax the way
on?â the man said, still more gruffly. âAnybody âud think you was a wild woman,
anâ look at yer.â

Hetty was frightened at this gruff old man, and still more at this last
suggestion that she looked like a wild woman. As she followed him out of the
hovel she thought she would give him a sixpence for telling her the way, and
then he would not suppose she was wild. As he stopped to point out the road to
her, she put her hand in her pocket to get the six-pence ready, and when he was
turning away, without saying good-morning, she held it out to him and said,
âThank you; will you please to take something for your trouble?â

He looked slowly at the sixpence, and then said, âI want none oâ your money.
Youâd better take care onât, else youâll get it stool from yer, if you go
trapesinâ about the fields like a mad woman a-thatway.â

The man left her without further speech, and Hetty held on her way. Another day
had risen, and she must wander on. It was no use to think of drowning
herselfâshe could not do it, at least while she had money left to buy food and
strength to journey on. But the incident on her waking this morning heightened
her dread of that time when her money would be all gone; she would have to sell
her basket and clothes then, and she would really look like a beggar or a wild
woman, as the man had said. The passionate joy in life she had felt in the
night, after escaping from the brink of the black cold death in the pool, was
gone now. Life now, by the morning light, with the impression of that manâs
hard wondering look at her, was as full of dread as deathâit was worse; it was
a dread to which she felt chained, from which she shrank and shrank as she did
from the black pool, and yet could find no refuge from it.

She took out her money from her purse, and looked at it. She had still
two-and-twenty shillings; it would serve her for many days more, or it would
help her to get on faster to Stonyshire, within reach of Dinah. The thought of
Dinah urged itself more strongly now, since the experience of the night had
driven her shuddering imagination away from the pool. If it had been only going
to Dinahâif nobody besides Dinah would ever knowâHetty could have made up her
mind to go to her. The soft voice, the pitying eyes, would have drawn her. But
afterwards the other people must know, and she could no more rush on that shame
than she could rush on death.

She must wander on and on, and wait for a lower depth of despair to give her
courage. Perhaps death would come to her, for she was getting less and less
able to bear the dayâs weariness. And yetâsuch is the strange action of our
souls, drawing us by a lurking desire towards the very ends we dreadâHetty,
when she set out again from Norton, asked the straightest road northwards
towards Stonyshire, and kept it all that day.

Poor wandering Hetty, with the rounded childish face and the hard, unloving,
despairing soul looking out of itâwith the narrow heart and narrow thoughts, no
room in them for any sorrows but her own, and tasting that sorrow with the more
intense bitterness! My heart bleeds for her as I see her toiling along on her
weary feet, or seated in a cart, with her eyes fixed vacantly on the road
before her, never thinking or caring whither it tends, till hunger comes and
makes her desire that a village may be near.

What will be the end, the end of her objectless wandering, apart from all love,
caring for human beings only through her pride, clinging to life only as the
hunted wounded brute clings to it?

God preserve you and me from being the beginners of such misery!

Chapter XXXVIII

The Quest

The first ten days after Hettyâs departure passed as quietly as any other days
with the family at the Hall Farm, and with Adam at his daily work. They had
expected Hetty to stay away a week or ten days at least, perhaps a little
longer if Dinah came back with her, because there might then be something to
detain them at Snowfield. But when a fortnight had passed they began to feel a
little surprise that Hetty did not return; she must surely have found it
pleasanter to be with Dinah than any one could have supposed. Adam, for his
part, was getting very impatient to see her, and he resolved that, if she did
not appear the next day (Saturday), he would set out on Sunday morning to fetch
her. There was no coach on a Sunday, but by setting out before it was light,
and perhaps getting a lift in a cart by the way, he would arrive pretty early
at Snowfield, and bring back Hetty the next dayâDinah too, if she were coming.
It was quite time Hetty came home, and he would afford to lose his Monday for
the sake of bringing her.

His project was quite approved at the Farm when he went there on Saturday
evening. Mrs. Poyser desired him emphatically not to come back without Hetty,
for she had been quite too long away, considering the things she had to get
ready by the middle of March, and a week was surely enough for any one to go
out for their health. As for Dinah, Mrs. Poyser had small hope of their
bringing her, unless they could make her believe the folks at Hayslope were
twice as miserable as the folks at Snowfield. âThough,â said Mrs. Poyser, by
way of conclusion, âyou might tell her sheâs got but one aunt left, and

sheâs
wasted pretty nigh to a shadder; and we shall pârhaps all be gone
twenty mile farther off her next Michaelmas, and shall die oâ broken hearts
among strange folks, and leave the children fatherless and motherless.â

âNay, nay,â said Mr. Poyser, who certainly had the air of a man perfectly
heart-whole, âit isna so bad as that. Theeât looking rarely now, and getting
flesh every day. But Iâd be glad for Dinah tâ come, for sheâd help thee wiâ the
little uns: they took tâ her wonderful.â

So at daybreak, on Sunday, Adam set off. Seth went with him the first mile or
two, for the thought of Snowfield and the possibility that Dinah might come
again made him restless, and the walk with Adam in the cold morning air, both
in their best clothes, helped to give him a sense of Sunday calm. It was the
last morning in February, with a low grey sky, and a slight hoar-frost on the
green border of the road and on the black hedges. They heard the gurgling of
the full brooklet hurrying down the hill, and the faint twittering of the early
birds. For they walked in silence, though with a pleased sense of
companionship.

âGood-bye, lad,â said Adam, laying his hand on Sethâs shoulder and looking at
him affectionately as they were about to part. âI wish thee wast going all the
way wiâ me, and as happy as I am.â

âIâm content, Addy, Iâm content,â said Seth cheerfully. âIâll be an old
bachelor, belike, and make a fuss wiâ thy children.â

They turned away from each other, and Seth walked leisurely homeward, mentally
repeating one of his favourite hymnsâhe was very fond of hymns:

âDark and cheerless is the morn

Â Â Â Â Unaccompanied by thee:

Joyless is the dayâs return

Â Â Â Â Till thy mercyâs beams I see:

Till thou inward light impart,

Glad my eyes and warm my heart.

Visit, then, this soul of mine,

Â Â Â Â Pierce the gloom of sin and griefâ

Fill me, Radiancy Divine,

Â Â Â Â Scatter all my unbelief.

More and more thyself display,

Shining to the perfect day.â

Adam walked much faster, and any one coming along the Oakbourne road at sunrise
that morning must have had a pleasant sight in this tall broad-chested man,
striding along with a carriage as upright and firm as any soldierâs, glancing
with keen glad eyes at the dark-blue hills as they began to show themselves on
his way. Seldom in Adamâs life had his face been so free from any cloud of
anxiety as it was this morning; and this freedom from care, as is usual with
constructive practical minds like his, made him all the more observant of the
objects round him and all the more ready to gather suggestions from them
towards his own favourite plans and ingenious contrivances. His happy loveâthe
knowledge that his steps were carrying him nearer and nearer to Hetty, who was
so soon to be hisâwas to his thoughts what the sweet morning air was to his
sensations: it gave him a consciousness of well-being that made activity
delightful. Every now and then there was a rush of more intense feeling towards
her, which chased away other images than Hetty; and along with that would come
a wondering thankfulness that all this happiness was given to himâthat this
life of ours had such sweetness in it. For Adam had a devout mind, though he
was perhaps rather impatient of devout words, and his tenderness lay very close
to his reverence, so that the one could hardly be stirred without the other.
But after feeling had welled up and poured itself out in this way, busy thought
would come back with the greater vigour; and this morning it was intent on
schemes by which the roads might be improved that were so imperfect all through
the country, and on picturing all the benefits that might come from the
exertions of a single country gentleman, if he would set himself to getting the
roads made good in his own district.

It seemed a very short walk, the ten miles to Oakbourne, that pretty town
within sight of the blue hills, where he break-fasted. After this, the country
grew barer and barer: no more rolling woods, no more wide-branching trees near
frequent homesteads, no more bushy hedgerows, but greystone walls intersecting
the meagre pastures, and dismal wide-scattered greystone houses on broken lands
where mines had been and were no longer. âA hungry land,â said Adam to himself.
âIâd rather go southâard, where they say itâs as flat as a table, than come to
live here; though if Dinah likes to live in a country where she can be the most
comfort to folks, sheâs iâ the right to live oâ this side; for she must look as
if sheâd come straight from heaven, like thâ angels in the desert, to
strengthen them as haâ got nothing tâ eat.â And when at last he came in sight
of Snowfield, he thought it looked like a town that was âfellow to the
country,â though the stream through the valley where the great mill stood gave
a pleasant greenness to the lower fields. The town lay, grim, stony, and
unsheltered, up the side of a steep hill, and Adam did not go forward to it at
present, for Seth had told him where to find Dinah. It was at a thatched
cottage outside the town, a little way from the millâan old cottage, standing
sideways towards the road, with a little bit of potato-ground before it. Here
Dinah lodged with an elderly couple; and if she and Hetty happened to be out,
Adam could learn where they were gone, or when they would be at home again.
Dinah might be out on some preaching errand, and perhaps she would have left
Hetty at home. Adam could not help hoping this, and as he recognized the
cottage by the roadside before him, there shone out in his face that
involuntary smile which belongs to the expectation of a near joy.

He hurried his step along the narrow causeway, and rapped at the door. It was
opened by a very clean old woman, with a slow palsied shake of the head.

âIs Dinah Morris at home?â said Adam.

âEh?... no,â said the old woman, looking up at this tall stranger with a wonder
that made her slower of speech than usual. âWill you please to come in?â she
added, retiring from the door, as if recollecting herself. âWhy, yeâre brother
to the young man as come afore, arena ye?â

âYes,â said Adam, entering. âThat was Seth Bede. Iâm his brother Adam. He told
me to give his respects to you and your good master.â

âAye, the same tâ him. He was a gracious young man. Anâ ye feature him, onây
yeâre darker. Sit ye down iâ thâ arm-chair. My man isna come home from
meeting.â

Adam sat down patiently, not liking to hurry the shaking old woman with
questions, but looking eagerly towards the narrow twisting stairs in one
corner, for he thought it was possible Hetty might have heard his voice and
would come down them.

âSo youâre come to see Dinah Morris?â said the old woman, standing opposite to
him. âAnâ you didnâ know she was away from home, then?â

âNo,â said Adam, âbut I thought it likely she might be away, seeing as itâs
Sunday. But the other young womanâis she at home, or gone along with Dinah?â

The old woman looked at Adam with a bewildered air.

âGone along wiâ her?â she said. âEh, Dinahâs gone to Leeds, a big town ye may
haâ heared on, where thereâs a many oâ the Lordâs people. Sheâs been gone sinâ
Friday was a fortnight: they sent her the money for her journey. You may see
her room here,â she went on, opening a door and not noticing the effect of her
words on Adam. He rose and followed her, and darted an eager glance into the
little room with its narrow bed, the portrait of Wesley on the wall, and the
few books lying on the large Bible. He had had an irrational hope that Hetty
might be there. He could not speak in the first moment after seeing that the
room was empty; an undefined fear had seized himâsomething had happened to
Hetty on the journey. Still the old woman was so slow of speech and
apprehension, that Hetty might be at Snowfield after all.

âItâs a pity ye didna know,â she said. âHave ye come from your own country oâ
purpose to see her?â

âBut HettyâHetty Sorrel,â said Adam, abruptly; âWhere is
she?
â

âI know nobody by that name,â said the old woman, wonderingly. âIs it anybody
yeâve heared on at Snowfield?â

âDid there come no young woman hereâvery young and prettyâFriday was a
fortnight, to see Dinah Morris?â

âNay; Iân seen no young woman.â

âThink; are you quite sure? A girl, eighteen years old, with dark eyes and dark
curly hair, and a red cloak on, and a basket on her arm? You couldnât forget
her if you saw her.â

âNay; Friday was a fortnightâit was the day as Dinah went awayâthere come
nobody. Thereâs neâer been nobody asking for her till you come, for the folks
about know as sheâs gone. Eh dear, eh dear, is there summat the matter?â

The old woman had seen the ghastly look of fear in Adamâs face. But he was not
stunned or confounded: he was thinking eagerly where he could inquire about
Hetty.

âYes; a young woman started from our country to see Dinah, Friday was a
fortnight. I came to fetch her back. Iâm afraid something has happened to her.
I canât stop. Good-bye.â

He hastened out of the cottage, and the old woman followed him to the gate,
watching him sadly with her shaking head as he almost ran towards the town. He
was going to inquire at the place where the Oakbourne coach stopped.

No! No young woman like Hetty had been seen there. Had any accident happened to
the coach a fortnight ago? No. And there was no coach to take him back to
Oakbourne that day. Well, he would walk: he couldnât stay here, in wretched
inaction. But the innkeeper, seeing that Adam was in great anxiety, and
entering into this new incident with the eagerness of a man who passes a great
deal of time with his hands in his pockets looking into an obstinately
monotonous street, offered to take him back to Oakbourne in his own âtaxed
cartâ this very evening. It was not five oâclock; there was plenty of time for
Adam to take a meal and yet to get to Oakbourne before ten oâclock. The
innkeeper declared that he really wanted to go to Oakbourne, and might as well
go to-night; he should have all Monday before him then. Adam, after making an
ineffectual attempt to eat, put the food in his pocket, and, drinking a draught
of ale, declared himself ready to set off. As they approached the cottage, it
occurred to him that he would do well to learn from the old woman where Dinah
was to be found in Leeds: if there was trouble at the Hall Farmâhe only
half-admitted the foreboding that there would beâthe Poysers might like to send
for Dinah. But Dinah had not left any address, and the old woman, whose memory
for names was infirm, could not recall the name of the âblessed womanâ who was
Dinahâs chief friend in the Society at Leeds.

During that long, long journey in the taxed cart, there was time for all the
conjectures of importunate fear and struggling hope. In the very first shock of
discovering that Hetty had not been to Snowfield, the thought of Arthur had
darted through Adam like a sharp pang, but he tried for some time to ward off
its return by busying himself with modes of accounting for the alarming fact,
quite apart from that intolerable thought. Some accident had happened. Hetty
had, by some strange chance, got into a wrong vehicle from Oakbourne: she had
been taken ill, and did not want to frighten them by letting them know. But
this frail fence of vague improbabilities was soon hurled down by a rush of
distinct agonizing fears. Hetty had been deceiving herself in thinking that she
could love and marry him: she had been loving Arthur all the while; and now, in
her desperation at the nearness of their marriage, she had run away. And she
was gone to
him
. The old indignation and jealousy rose again, and
prompted the suspicion that Arthur had been dealing falselyâhad written to
Hettyâhad tempted her to come to himâbeing unwilling, after all, that she
should belong to another man besides himself. Perhaps the whole thing had been
contrived by him, and he had given her directions how to follow him to
Irelandâfor Adam knew that Arthur had been gone thither three weeks ago, having
recently learnt it at the Chase. Every sad look of Hettyâs, since she had been
engaged to Adam, returned upon him now with all the exaggeration of painful
retrospect. He had been foolishly sanguine and confident. The poor thing hadnât
perhaps known her own mind for a long while; had thought that she could forget
Arthur; had been momentarily drawn towards the man who offered her a
protecting, faithful love. He couldnât bear to blame her: she never meant to
cause him this dreadful pain. The blame lay with that man who had selfishly
played with her heartâhad perhaps even deliberately lured her away.

At Oakbourne, the ostler at the Royal Oak remembered such a young woman as Adam
described getting out of the Treddleston coach more than a fortnight agoâwasnât
likely to forget such a pretty lass as that in a hurryâwas sure she had not
gone on by the Buxton coach that went through Snowfield, but had lost sight of
her while he went away with the horses and had never set eyes on her again.
Adam then went straight to the house from which the Stoniton coach started:
Stoniton was the most obvious place for Hetty to go to first, whatever might be
her destination, for she would hardly venture on any but the chief coach-roads.
She had been noticed here too, and was remembered to have sat on the box by the
coachman; but the coachman could not be seen, for another man had been driving
on that road in his stead the last three or four days. He could probably be
seen at Stoniton, through inquiry at the inn where the coach put up. So the
anxious heart-stricken Adam must of necessity wait and try to rest till
morningânay, till eleven oâclock, when the coach started.

At Stoniton another delay occurred, for the old coachman who had driven Hetty
would not be in the town again till night. When he did come he remembered Hetty
well, and remembered his own joke addressed to her, quoting it many times to
Adam, and observing with equal frequency that he thought there was something
more than common, because Hetty had not laughed when he joked her. But he
declared, as the people had done at the inn, that he had lost sight of Hetty
directly she got down. Part of the next morning was consumed in inquiries at
every house in the town from which a coach startedâ(all in vain, for you know
Hetty did not start from Stoniton by coach, but on foot in the grey
morning)âand then in walking out to the first toll-gates on the different lines
of road, in the forlorn hope of finding some recollection of her there. No, she
was not to be traced any farther; and the next hard task for Adam was to go
home and carry the wretched tidings to the Hall Farm. As to what he should do
beyond that, he had come to two distinct resolutions amidst the tumult of
thought and feeling which was going on within him while he went to and fro. He
would not mention what he knew of Arthur Donnithorneâs behaviour to Hetty till
there was a clear necessity for it: it was still possible Hetty might come
back, and the disclosure might be an injury or an offence to her. And as soon
as he had been home and done what was necessary there to prepare for his
further absence, he would start off to Ireland: if he found no trace of Hetty
on the road, he would go straight to Arthur Donnithorne and make himself
certain how far he was acquainted with her movements. Several times the thought
occurred to him that he would consult Mr. Irwine, but that would be useless
unless he told him all, and so betrayed the secret about Arthur. It seems
strange that Adam, in the incessant occupation of his mind about Hetty, should
never have alighted on the probability that she had gone to Windsor, ignorant
that Arthur was no longer there. Perhaps the reason was that he could not
conceive Hettyâs throwing herself on Arthur uncalled; he imagined no cause that
could have driven her to such a step, after that letter written in August.
There were but two alternatives in his mind: either Arthur had written to her
again and enticed her away, or she had simply fled from her approaching
marriage with himself because she found, after all, she could not love him well
enough, and yet was afraid of her friendsâ anger if she retracted.

With this last determination on his mind, of going straight to Arthur, the
thought that he had spent two days in inquiries which had proved to be almost
useless, was torturing to Adam; and yet, since he would not tell the Poysers
his conviction as to where Hetty was gone, or his intention to follow her
thither, he must be able to say to them that he had traced her as far as
possible.

It was after twelve oâclock on Tuesday night when Adam reached Treddleston;
and, unwilling to disturb his mother and Seth, and also to encounter their
questions at that hour, he threw himself without undressing on a bed at the
âWaggon Overthrown,â and slept hard from pure weariness. Not more than four
hours, however, for before five oâclock he set out on his way home in the faint
morning twilight. He always kept a key of the workshop door in his pocket, so
that he could let himself in; and he wished to enter without awaking his
mother, for he was anxious to avoid telling her the new trouble himself by
seeing Seth first, and asking him to tell her when it should be necessary. He
walked gently along the yard, and turned the key gently in the door; but, as he
expected, Gyp, who lay in the workshop, gave a sharp bark. It subsided when he
saw Adam, holding up his finger at him to impose silence, and in his dumb,
tailless joy he must content himself with rubbing his body against his masterâs
legs.

Adam was too heart-sick to take notice of Gypâs fondling. He threw himself on
the bench and stared dully at the wood and the signs of work around him,
wondering if he should ever come to feel pleasure in them again, while Gyp,
dimly aware that there was something wrong with his master, laid his rough grey
head on Adamâs knee and wrinkled his brows to look up at him. Hitherto, since
Sunday afternoon, Adam had been constantly among strange people and in strange
places, having no associations with the details of his daily life, and now that
by the light of this new morning he was come back to his home and surrounded by
the familiar objects that seemed for ever robbed of their charm, the
realityâthe hard, inevitable reality of his troubles pressed upon him with a
new weight. Right before him was an unfinished chest of drawers, which he had
been making in spare moments for Hettyâs use, when his home should be hers.

Seth had not heard Adamâs entrance, but he had been roused by Gypâs bark, and
Adam heard him moving about in the room above, dressing himself. Sethâs first
thoughts were about his brother: he would come home to-day, surely, for the
business would be wanting him sadly by to-morrow, but it was pleasant to think
he had had a longer holiday than he had expected. And would Dinah come too?
Seth felt that that was the greatest happiness he could look forward to for
himself, though he had no hope left that she would ever love him well enough to
marry him; but he had often said to himself, it was better to be Dinahâs friend
and brother than any other womanâs husband. If he could but be always near her,
instead of living so far off!

He came downstairs and opened the inner door leading from the kitchen into the
workshop, intending to let out Gyp; but he stood still in the doorway, smitten
with a sudden shock at the sight of Adam seated listlessly on the bench, pale,
unwashed, with sunken blank eyes, almost like a drunkard in the morning. But
Seth felt in an instant what the marks meantânot drunkenness, but some great
calamity. Adam looked up at him without speaking, and Seth moved forward
towards the bench, himself trembling so that speech did not come readily.

âGod have mercy on us, Addy,â he said, in a low voice, sitting down on the
bench beside Adam, âwhat is it?â

Adam was unable to speak. The strong man, accustomed to suppress the signs of
sorrow, had felt his heart swell like a childâs at this first approach of
sympathy. He fell on Sethâs neck and sobbed.

Seth was prepared for the worst now, for, even in his recollections of their
boyhood, Adam had never sobbed before.

âIs it death, Adam? Is she dead?â he asked, in a low tone, when Adam raised his
head and was recovering himself.

âNo, lad; but sheâs goneâgone away from us. Sheâs never been to Snowfield.
Dinahâs been gone to Leeds ever since last Friday was a fortnight, the very day
Hetty set out. I canât find out where she went after she got to Stoniton.â

Seth was silent from utter astonishment: he knew nothing that could suggest to
him a reason for Hettyâs going away.

âHast any notion what sheâs done it for?â he said, at last.

âShe canât haâ loved me. She didnât like our marriage when it came nighâthat
must be it,â said Adam. He had determined to mention no further reason.

âI hear Mother stirring,â said Seth. âMust we tell her?â

âNo, not yet,â said Adam, rising from the bench and pushing the hair from his
face, as if he wanted to rouse himself. âI canât have her told yet; and I must
set out on another journey directly, after Iâve been to the village and thâ
Hall Farm. I canât tell thee where Iâm going, and thee must say to her Iâm gone
on business as nobody is to know anything about. Iâll go and wash myself now.â
Adam moved towards the door of the workshop, but after a step or two he turned
round, and, meeting Sethâs eyes with a calm sad glance, he said, âI must take
all the money out oâ the tin box, lad; but if anything happens to me, all the
rest âll be thine, to take care oâ Mother with.â

Seth was pale and trembling: he felt there was some terrible secret under all
this. âBrother,â he said, faintlyâhe never called Adam âBrotherâ except in
solemn momentsââI donât believe youâll do anything as you canât ask Godâs
blessing on.â

âNay, lad,â said Adam, âdonât be afraid. Iâm for doing nought but whatâs a
manâs duty.â

The thought that if he betrayed his trouble to his mother, she would only
distress him by words, half of blundering affection, half of irrepressible
triumph that Hetty proved as unfit to be his wife as she had always foreseen,
brought back some of his habitual firmness and self-command. He had felt ill on
his journey homeâhe told her when she came downâhad stayed all night at
Tredddleston for that reason; and a bad headache, that still hung about him
this morning, accounted for his paleness and heavy eyes.

He determined to go to the village, in the first place, attend to his business
for an hour, and give notice to Burge of his being obliged to go on a journey,
which he must beg him not to mention to any one; for he wished to avoid going
to the Hall Farm near breakfast-time, when the children and servants would be
in the house-place, and there must be exclamations in their hearing about his
having returned without Hetty. He waited until the clock struck nine before he
left the work-yard at the village, and set off, through the fields, towards the
Farm. It was an immense relief to him, as he came near the Home Close, to see
Mr. Poyser advancing towards him, for this would spare him the pain of going to
the house. Mr. Poyser was walking briskly this March morning, with a sense of
spring business on his mind: he was going to cast the masterâs eye on the
shoeing of a new cart-horse, carrying his spud as a useful companion by the
way. His surprise was great when he caught sight of Adam, but he was not a man
given to presentiments of evil.

âWhy, Adam, lad, isât you? Have ye been all this time away and not brought the
lasses back, after all? Where are they?â

âNo, Iâve not brought âem,â said Adam, turning round, to indicate that he
wished to walk back with Mr. Poyser.

âWhy,â said Martin, looking with sharper attention at Adam, âye look bad. Is
there anything happened?â

âYes,â said Adam, heavily. âA sad thingâs happened. I didna find Hetty at
Snowfield.â

Mr. Poyserâs good-natured face showed signs of troubled astonishment. âNot find
her? Whatâs happened to her?â he said, his thoughts flying at once to bodily
accident.

âThat I canât tell, whether anythingâs happened to her. She never went to
Snowfieldâshe took the coach to Stoniton, but I canât learn nothing of her
after she got down from the Stoniton coach.â

âWhy, you donna mean sheâs run away?â said Martin, standing still, so puzzled
and bewildered that the fact did not yet make itself felt as a trouble by him.

âShe must haâ done,â said Adam. âShe didnât like our marriage when it came to
the pointâthat must be it. Sheâd mistook her feelings.â

Martin was silent for a minute or two, looking on the ground and rooting up the
grass with his spud, without knowing what he was doing. His usual slowness was
always trebled when the subject of speech was painful. At last he looked up,
right in Adamâs face, saying, âThen she didna deserve tâ haâ ye, my lad. Anâ I
feel iâ fault myself, for she was my niece, and I was allays hot for her
marrâing ye. Thereâs no amends I can make ye, ladâthe moreâs the pity: itâs a
sad cut-up for ye, I doubt.â

Adam could say nothing; and Mr. Poyser, after pursuing his walk for a little
while, went on, âIâll be bound sheâs gone after trying to get a ladyâs maidâs
place, for sheâd got that in her head half a year ago, and wanted me to giâ my
consent. But Iâd thought better on herââhe added, shaking his head slowly and
sadlyââIâd thought better on her, nor to look for this, after sheâd giâen yâ
her word, anâ everything been got ready.â

Adam had the strongest motives for encouraging this supposition in Mr. Poyser,
and he even tried to believe that it might possibly be true. He had no warrant
for the
certainty
that she was gone to Arthur.

âIt was better it should be so,â he said, as quietly as he could, âif she felt
she couldnât like me for a husband. Better run away before than repent after. I
hope you wonât look harshly on her if she comes back, as she may do if she
finds it hard to get on away from home.â

âI canna look on her as Iâve done before,â said Martin decisively. âSheâs acted
bad by you, and by all of us. But Iâll not turn my back on her: sheâs but a
young un, and itâs the first harm Iâve knowed on her. Itâll be a hard job for
me to tell her aunt. Why didna Dinah come back wiâ ye? Sheâd haâ helped to
pacify her aunt a bit.â

âDinah wasnât at Snowfield. Sheâs been gone to Leeds this fortnight, and I
couldnât learn from thâ old woman any direction where she is at Leeds, else I
should haâ brought it you.â

âSheâd a deal better be staying wiâ her own kin,â said Mr. Poyser, indignantly,
âthan going preaching among strange folks a-thatân.â

âI must leave you now, Mr. Poyser,â said Adam, âfor Iâve a deal to see to.â

âAye, youâd best be after your business, and I must tell the missis when I go
home. Itâs a hard job.â

âBut,â said Adam, âI beg particular, youâll keep whatâs happened quiet for a
week or two. Iâve not told my mother yet, and thereâs no knowing how things may
turn out.â

âAye, aye; least said, soonest mended. Weân no need to say why the match is
broke off, anâ we may hear of her after a bit. Shake hands wiâ me, lad: I wish
I could make thee amends.â

There was something in Martin Poyserâs throat at that moment which caused him
to bring out those scanty words in rather a broken fashion. Yet Adam knew what
they meant all the better, and the two honest men grasped each otherâs hard
hands in mutual understanding.

There was nothing now to hinder Adam from setting off. He had told Seth to go
to the Chase and leave a message for the squire, saying that Adam Bede had been
obliged to start off suddenly on a journeyâand to say as much, and no more, to
any one else who made inquiries about him. If the Poysers learned that he was
gone away again, Adam knew they would infer that he was gone in search of
Hetty.

He had intended to go right on his way from the Hall Farm, but now the impulse
which had frequently visited him beforeâto go to Mr. Irwine, and make a
confidant of himârecurred with the new force which belongs to a last
opportunity. He was about to start on a long journeyâa difficult oneâby seaâand
no soul would know where he was gone. If anything happened to him? Or, if he
absolutely needed help in any matter concerning Hetty? Mr. Irwine was to be
trusted; and the feeling which made Adam shrink from telling anything which was

her
secret must give way before the need there was that she should have
some one else besides himself who would be prepared to defend her in the worst
extremity. Towards Arthur, even though he might have incurred no new guilt,
Adam felt that he was not bound to keep silence when Hettyâs interest called on
him to speak.

âI must do it,â said Adam, when these thoughts, which had spread themselves
through hours of his sad journeying, now rushed upon him in an instant, like a
wave that had been slowly gathering; âitâs the right thing. I canât stand alone
in this way any longer.â

Chapter XXXIX

The Tidings

Adam turned his face towards Broxton and walked with his swiftest stride,
looking at his watch with the fear that Mr. Irwine might be gone outâhunting,
perhaps. The fear and haste together produced a state of strong excitement
before he reached the rectory gate, and outside it he saw the deep marks of a
recent hoof on the gravel.

But the hoofs were turned towards the gate, not away from it, and though there
was a horse against the stable door, it was not Mr. Irwineâs: it had evidently
had a journey this morning, and must belong to some one who had come on
business. Mr. Irwine was at home, then; but Adam could hardly find breath and
calmness to tell Carroll that he wanted to speak to the rector. The double
suffering of certain and uncertain sorrow had begun to shake the strong man.
The butler looked at him wonderingly, as he threw himself on a bench in the
passage and stared absently at the clock on the opposite wall. The master had
somebody with him, he said, but he heard the study door openâthe stranger
seemed to be coming out, and as Adam was in a hurry, he would let the master
know at once.

Adam sat looking at the clock: the minute-hand was hurrying along the last five
minutes to ten with a loud, hard, indifferent tick, and Adam watched the
movement and listened to the sound as if he had had some reason for doing so.
In our times of bitter suffering there are almost always these pauses, when our
consciousness is benumbed to everything but some trivial perception or
sensation. It is as if semi-idiocy came to give us rest from the memory and the
dread which refuse to leave us in our sleep.

Carroll, coming back, recalled Adam to the sense of his burden. He was to go
into the study immediately. âI canât think what that strange personâs come
about,â the butler added, from mere incontinence of remark, as he preceded Adam
to the door, âheâs gone iâ the dining-room. And master looks unaccountableâas
if he was frightened.â Adam took no notice of the words: he could not care
about other peopleâs business. But when he entered the study and looked in Mr.
Irwineâs face, he felt in an instant that there was a new expression in it,
strangely different from the warm friendliness it had always worn for him
before. A letter lay open on the table, and Mr. Irwineâs hand was on it, but
the changed glance he cast on Adam could not be owing entirely to preoccupation
with some disagreeable business, for he was looking eagerly towards the door,
as if Adamâs entrance were a matter of poignant anxiety to him.

âYou want to speak to me, Adam,â he said, in that low constrainedly quiet tone
which a man uses when he is determined to suppress agitation. âSit down here.â
He pointed to a chair just opposite to him, at no more than a yardâs distance
from his own, and Adam sat down with a sense that this cold manner of Mr.
Irwineâs gave an additional unexpected difficulty to his disclosure. But when
Adam had made up his mind to a measure, he was not the man to renounce it for
any but imperative reasons.

âI come to you, sir,â he said, âas the gentleman I look up to most of anybody.
Iâve something very painful to tell youâsomething as itâll pain you to hear as
well as me to tell. But if I speak oâ the wrong other people have done, youâll
see I didnât speak till Iâd good reason.â

Mr. Irwine nodded slowly, and Adam went on rather tremulously, âYou was tâ haâ
married me and Hetty Sorrel, you know, sir, oâ the fifteenth oâ this month. I
thought she loved me, and I was thâ happiest man iâ the parish. But a dreadful
blowâs come upon me.â

Mr. Irwine started up from his chair, as if involuntarily, but then, determined
to control himself, walked to the window and looked out.

âSheâs gone away, sir, and we donât know where. She said she was going to
Snowfield oâ Friday was a fortnight, and I went last Sunday to fetch her back;
but sheâd never been there, and she took the coach to Stoniton, and beyond that
I canât trace her. But now Iâm going a long journey to look for her, and I
canât trust tâ anybody but you where Iâm going.â

Mr. Irwine came back from the window and sat down.

âHave you no idea of the reason why she went away?â he said.

âItâs plain enough she didnât want to marry me, sir,â said Adam. âShe didnât
like it when it came so near. But that isnât all, I doubt. Thereâs something
else I must tell you, sir. Thereâs somebody else concerned besides me.â

A gleam of somethingâit was almost like relief or joyâcame across the eager
anxiety of Mr. Irwineâs face at that moment. Adam was looking on the ground,
and paused a little: the next words were hard to speak. But when he went on, he
lifted up his head and looked straight at Mr. Irwine. He would do the thing he
had resolved to do, without flinching.

âYou know whoâs the man Iâve reckoned my greatest friend,â he said, âand used
to be proud to think as I should pass my life iâ working for him, and had felt
so ever since we were lads....â

Mr. Irwine, as if all self-control had forsaken him, grasped Adamâs arm, which
lay on the table, and, clutching it tightly like a man in pain, said, with pale
lips and a low hurried voice, âNo, Adam, noâdonât say it, for Godâs sake!â

Adam, surprised at the violence of Mr. Irwineâs feeling, repented of the words
that had passed his lips and sat in distressed silence. The grasp on his arm
gradually relaxed, and Mr. Irwine threw himself back in his chair, saying, âGo
onâI must know it.â

âThat man played with Hettyâs feelings, and behaved to her as heâd no right to
do to a girl in her station oâ lifeâmade her presents and used to go and meet
her out a-walking. I found it out only two days before he went awayâfound him
a-kissing her as they were parting in the Grove. Thereâd been nothing said
between me and Hetty then, though Iâd loved her for a long while, and she knew
it. But I reproached him with his wrong actions, and words and blows passed
between us; and he said solemnly to me, after that, as it had been all nonsense
and no more than a bit oâ flirting. But I made him write a letter to tell Hetty
heâd meant nothing, for I saw clear enough, sir, by several things as I hadnât
understood at the time, as heâd got hold of her heart, and I thought sheâd
belike go on thinking of him and never come to love another man as wanted to
marry her. And I gave her the letter, and she seemed to bear it all after a
while better than Iâd expected... and she behaved kinder and kinder to me... I
daresay she didnât know her own feelings then, poor thing, and they came back
upon her when it was too late... I donât want to blame her... I canât think as
she meant to deceive me. But I was encouraged to think she loved me, andâyou
know the rest, sir. But itâs on my mind as heâs been false to me, and âticed
her away, and sheâs gone to himâand Iâm going now to see, for I can never go to
work again till I know whatâs become of her.â

During Adamâs narrative, Mr. Irwine had had time to recover his self-mastery in
spite of the painful thoughts that crowded upon him. It was a bitter
remembrance to him nowâthat morning when Arthur breakfasted with him and seemed
as if he were on the verge of a confession. It was plain enough
now
what
he had wanted to confess. And if their words had taken another turn... if he
himself had been less fastidious about intruding on another manâs secrets... it
was cruel to think how thin a film had shut out rescue from all this guilt and
misery. He saw the whole history now by that terrible illumination which the
present sheds back upon the past. But every other feeling as it rushed upon him
was thrown into abeyance by pity, deep respectful pity, for the man who sat
before himâalready so bruised, going forth with sad blind resignedness to an
unreal sorrow, while a real one was close upon him, too far beyond the range of
common trial for him ever to have feared it. His own agitation was quelled by a
certain awe that comes over us in the presence of a great anguish, for the
anguish he must inflict on Adam was already present to him. Again he put his
hand on the arm that lay on the table, but very gently this time, as he said
solemnly:

âAdam, my dear friend, you have had some hard trials in your life. You can bear
sorrow manfully, as well as act manfully. God requires both tasks at our hands.
And there is a heavier sorrow coming upon you than any you have yet known. But
you are not guiltyâyou have not the worst of all sorrows. God help him who
has!â

The two pale faces looked at each other; in Adamâs there was trembling
suspense, in Mr. Irwineâs hesitating, shrinking pity. But he went on.

âI have had news of Hetty this morning. She is not gone to
him
. She is
in Stonyshireâat Stoniton.â

Adam started up from his chair, as if he thought he could have leaped to her
that moment. But Mr. Irwine laid hold of his arm again and said, persuasively,
âWait, Adam, wait.â So he sat down.

âShe is in a very unhappy positionâone which will make it worse for you to find
her, my poor friend, than to have lost her for ever.â

Adamâs lips moved tremulously, but no sound came. They moved again, and he
whispered, âTell me.â

âShe has been arrested... she is in prison.â

It was as if an insulting blow had brought back the spirit of resistance into
Adam. The blood rushed to his face, and he said, loudly and sharply, âFor
what?â

âFor a great crimeâthe murder of her child.â

âIt
canât be!
â Adam almost shouted, starting up from his chair and
making a stride towards the door; but he turned round again, setting his back
against the bookcase, and looking fiercely at Mr. Irwine. âIt isnât possible.
She never had a child. She canât be guilty.
Who
says it?â

âGod grant she may be innocent, Adam. We can still hope she is.â

âBut who says she is guilty?â said Adam violently. âTell me everything.â

âHere is a letter from the magistrate before whom she was taken, and the
constable who arrested her is in the dining-room. She will not confess her name
or where she comes from; but I fear, I fear, there can be no doubt it is Hetty.
The description of her person corresponds, only that she is said to look very
pale and ill. She had a small red-leather pocket-book in her pocket with two
names written in itâone at the beginning, âHetty Sorrel, Hayslope,â and the
other near the end, âDinah Morris, Snowfield.â She will not say which is her
own nameâshe denies everything, and will answer no questions, and application
has been made to me, as a magistrate, that I may take measures for identifying
her, for it was thought probable that the name which stands first is her own
name.â

âBut what proof have they got against her, if it
is
Hetty?â said Adam,
still violently, with an effort that seemed to shake his whole frame. âIâll not
believe it. It couldnât haâ been, and none of us know it.â

âTerrible proof that she was under the temptation to commit the crime; but we
have room to hope that she did not really commit it. Try and read that letter,
Adam.â

Adam took the letter between his shaking hands and tried to fix his eyes
steadily on it. Mr. Irwine meanwhile went out to give some orders. When he came
back, Adamâs eyes were still on the first pageâhe couldnât readâhe could not
put the words together and make out what they meant. He threw it down at last
and clenched his fist.

âItâs
his
doing,â he said; âif thereâs been any crime, itâs at his door,
not at hers.
He
taught her to deceiveâ
he
deceived me first. Let
âem put
him
on his trialâlet him stand in court beside her, and Iâll
tell âem how he got hold of her heart, and âticed her tâ evil, and then lied to
me. Is
he
to go free, while they lay all the punishment on her... so
weak and young?â

The image called up by these last words gave a new direction to poor Adamâs
maddened feelings. He was silent, looking at the corner of the room as if he
saw something there. Then he burst out again, in a tone of appealing anguish,

âI
canât
bear it... O God, itâs too hard to lay upon meâitâs too hard to
think sheâs wicked.â

Mr. Irwine had sat down again in silence. He was too wise to utter soothing
words at present, and indeed, the sight of Adam before him, with that look of
sudden age which sometimes comes over a young face in moments of terrible
emotionâthe hard bloodless look of the skin, the deep lines about the quivering
mouth, the furrows in the browâthe sight of this strong firm man shattered by
the invisible stroke of sorrow, moved him so deeply that speech was not easy.
Adam stood motionless, with his eyes vacantly fixed in this way for a minute or
two; in that short space he was living through all his love again.

âShe canât haâ done it,â he said, still without moving his eyes, as if he were
only talking to himself: âit was fear made her hide it... I forgive her for
deceiving me... I forgive thee, Hetty... thee wast deceived too... itâs gone
hard wiâ thee, my poor Hetty... but theyâll never make me believe it.â

He was silent again for a few moments, and then he said, with fierce
abruptness, âIâll go to himâIâll bring him backâIâll make him go and look at
her in her miseryâhe shall look at her till he canât forget itâit shall follow
him night and dayâas long as he lives it shall follow himâhe shanât escape wiâ
lies this timeâIâll fetch him, Iâll drag him myself.â

In the act of going towards the door, Adam paused automatically and looked
about for his hat, quite unconscious where he was or who was present with him.
Mr. Irwine had followed him, and now took him by the arm, saying, in a quiet
but decided tone,

âNo, Adam, no; Iâm sure you will wish to stay and see what good can be done for

her
, instead of going on a useless errand of vengeance. The punishment
will surely fall without your aid. Besides, he is no longer in Ireland. He must
be on his way homeâor would be, long before you arrived, for his grandfather, I
know, wrote for him to come at least ten days ago. I want you now to go with me
to Stoniton. I have ordered a horse for you to ride with us, as soon as you can
compose yourself.â

While Mr. Irwine was speaking, Adam recovered his consciousness of the actual
scene. He rubbed his hair off his forehead and listened.

âRemember,â Mr. Irwine went on, âthere are others to think of, and act for,
besides yourself, Adam: there are Hettyâs friends, the good Poysers, on whom
this stroke will fall more heavily than I can bear to think. I expect it from
your strength of mind, Adamâfrom your sense of duty to God and manâthat you
will try to act as long as action can be of any use.â

In reality, Mr. Irwine proposed this journey to Stoniton for Adamâs own sake.
Movement, with some object before him, was the best means of counteracting the
violence of suffering in these first hours.

âYou
will
go with me to Stoniton, Adam?â he said again, after a momentâs
pause. âWe have to see if it is really Hetty who is there, you know.â

âYes, sir,â said Adam, âIâll do what you think right. But the folks at thâ Hall
Farm?â

âI wish them not to know till I return to tell them myself. I shall have
ascertained things then which I am uncertain about now, and I shall return as
soon as possible. Come now, the horses are ready.â

Chapter XL

The Bitter Waters Spread

Mr. Irwine returned from Stoniton in a post-chaise that night, and the first
words Carroll said to him, as he entered the house, were, that Squire
Donnithorne was deadâfound dead in his bed at ten oâclock that morningâand that
Mrs. Irwine desired him to say she should be awake when Mr. Irwine came home,
and she begged him not to go to bed without seeing her.

âWell, Dauphin,â Mrs. Irwine said, as her son entered her room, âyouâre come at
last. So the old gentlemanâs fidgetiness and low spirits, which made him send
for Arthur in that sudden way, really meant something. I suppose Carroll has
told you that Donnithorne was found dead in his bed this morning. You will
believe my prognostications another time, though I daresay I shanât live to
prognosticate anything but my own death.â

âWhat have they done about Arthur?â said Mr. Irwine. âSent a messenger to await
him at Liverpool?â

âYes, Ralph was gone before the news was brought to us. Dear Arthur, I shall
live now to see him master at the Chase, and making good times on the estate,
like a generous-hearted fellow as he is. Heâll be as happy as a king now.â

Mr. Irwine could not help giving a slight groan: he was worn with anxiety and
exertion, and his motherâs light words were almost intolerable.

âWhat are you so dismal about, Dauphin? Is there any bad news? Or are you
thinking of the danger for Arthur in crossing that frightful Irish Channel at
this time of year?â

âNo, Mother, Iâm not thinking of that; but Iâm not prepared to rejoice just
now.â

âYouâve been worried by this law business that youâve been to Stoniton about.
What in the world is it, that you canât tell me?â

âYou will know by and by, mother. It would not be right for me to tell you at
present. Good-night: youâll sleep now you have no longer anything to listen
for.â

Mr. Irwine gave up his intention of sending a letter to meet Arthur, since it
would not now hasten his return: the news of his grandfatherâs death would
bring him as soon as he could possibly come. He could go to bed now and get
some needful rest, before the time came for the morningâs heavy duty of
carrying his sickening news to the Hall Farm and to Adamâs home.

Adam himself was not come back from Stoniton, for though he shrank from seeing
Hetty, he could not bear to go to a distance from her again.

âItâs no use, sir,â he said to the rector, âitâs no use for me to go back. I
canât go to work again while sheâs here, and I couldnât bear the sight oâ the
things and folks round home. Iâll take a bit of a room here, where I can see
the prison walls, and perhaps I shall get, in time, to bear seeing
her
.â

Adam had not been shaken in his belief that Hetty was innocent of the crime she
was charged with, for Mr. Irwine, feeling that the belief in her guilt would be
a crushing addition to Adamâs load, had kept from him the facts which left no
hope in his own mind. There was not any reason for thrusting the whole burden
on Adam at once, and Mr. Irwine, at parting, only said, âIf the evidence should
tell too strongly against her, Adam, we may still hope for a pardon. Her youth
and other circumstances will be a plea for her.â

âAh, and itâs right people should know how she was tempted into the wrong way,â
said Adam, with bitter earnestness. âItâs right they should know it was a fine
gentleman made love to her, and turned her head wiâ notions. Youâll remember,
sir, youâve promised to tell my mother, and Seth, and the people at the farm,
who it was as led her wrong, else theyâll think harder of her than she
deserves. Youâll be doing her a hurt by sparing him, and I hold him the
guiltiest before God, let her haâ done what she may. If you spare him, Iâll
expose him!â

âI think your demand is just, Adam,â said Mr. Irwine, âbut when you are calmer,
you will judge Arthur more mercifully. I say nothing now, only that his
punishment is in other hands than ours.â

Mr. Irwine felt it hard upon him that he should have to tell of Arthurâs sad
part in the story of sin and sorrowâhe who cared for Arthur with fatherly
affection, who had cared for him with fatherly pride. But he saw clearly that
the secret must be known before long, even apart from Adamâs determination,
since it was scarcely to be supposed that Hetty would persist to the end in her
obstinate silence. He made up his mind to withhold nothing from the Poysers,
but to tell them the worst at once, for there was no time to rob the tidings of
their suddenness. Hettyâs trial must come on at the Lent assizes, and they were
to be held at Stoniton the next week. It was scarcely to be hoped that Martin
Poyser could escape the pain of being called as a witness, and it was better he
should know everything as long beforehand as possible.

Before ten oâclock on Thursday morning the home at the Hall Farm was a house of
mourning for a misfortune felt to be worse than death. The sense of family
dishonour was too keen even in the kind-hearted Martin Poyser the younger to
leave room for any compassion towards Hetty. He and his father were
simple-minded farmers, proud of their untarnished character, proud that they
came of a family which had held up its head and paid its way as far back as its
name was in the parish register; and Hetty had brought disgrace on them
allâdisgrace that could never be wiped out. That was the all-conquering feeling
in the mind both of father and sonâthe scorching sense of disgrace, which
neutralised all other sensibilityâand Mr. Irwine was struck with surprise to
observe that Mrs. Poyser was less severe than her husband. We are often
startled by the severity of mild people on exceptional occasions; the reason
is, that mild people are most liable to be under the yoke of traditional
impressions.

âIâm willing to pay any money as is wanted towards trying to bring her off,â
said Martin the younger when Mr. Irwine was gone, while the old grandfather was
crying in the opposite chair, âbut Iâll not go nigh her, nor ever see her
again, by my own will. Sheâs made our bread bitter to us for all our lives to
come, anâ we shall neâer hold up our heads iâ this parish nor iâ any other. The
parson talks oâ folks pitying us: itâs poor amends pity âull make us.â

âPity?â said the grandfather, sharply. âI neâer wanted folksâs pity iâ

my
life afore... anâ I mun begin to be looked down on now, anâ me turned
seventy-two last St. Thomasâs, anâ all thâ underbearers and pall-bearers as Iân
picked for my funeral are iâ this parish and the next to ât.... Itâs oâ no use
now... I mun be taâen to the grave by strangers.â

âDonât fret so, father,â said Mrs. Poyser, who had spoken very little, being
almost overawed by her husbandâs unusual hardness and decision. âYouâll have
your children wiâ you; anâ thereâs the lads and the little un âull grow up in a
new parish as well as iâ thâ old un.â

âAh, thereâs no staying iâ this country for us now,â said Mr. Poyser, and the
hard tears trickled slowly down his round cheeks. âWe thought it âud be bad
luck if the old squire gave us notice this Lady day, but I must giâ notice
myself now, anâ see if there can anybody be got to come anâ take to the crops
as Iân put iâ the ground; for I wonna stay upoâ that manâs land a day longer
nor Iâm forced toât. Anâ me, as thought him such a good upright young man, as I
should be glad when he come to be our landlord. Iâll neâer lift my hat to him
again, nor sit iâ the same church wiâ him... a man as has brought shame on
respectable folks... anâ pretended to be such a friend tâ everybody.... Poor
Adam there... a fine friend heâs been tâ Adam, making speeches anâ talking so
fine, anâ all the while poisoning the ladâs life, as itâs much if he can stay
iâ this country any more nor we can.â

âAnâ you tâ haâ to go into court, and own youâre akin tâ her,â said the old
man. âWhy, theyâll cast it up to the little un, as isnât four âear old, some
dayâtheyâll cast it up tâ her as sheâd a cousin tried at the âsizes for
murder.â

âItâll be their own wickedness, then,â said Mrs. Poyser, with a sob in her
voice. âBut thereâs One above âull take care oâ the innicent child, else itâs
but little truth they tell us at church. Itâll be harder nor ever to die anâ
leave the little uns, anâ nobody to be a mother to âem.â

âWeâd better haâ sent for Dinah, if weâd known where she is,â said Mr. Poyser;
âbut Adam said sheâd left no direction where sheâd be at Leeds.â

âWhy, sheâd be wiâ that woman as was a friend tâ her Aunt Judith,â said Mrs.
Poyser, comforted a little by this suggestion of her husband. âIâve often heard
Dinah talk of her, but I canât remember what name she called her by. But
thereâs Seth Bede; heâs like enough to know, for sheâs a preaching woman as the
Methodists think a deal on.â

âIâll send to Seth,â said Mr. Poyser. âIâll send Alick to tell him to come, or
else to send up word oâ the womanâs name, anâ thee canst write a letter ready
to send off to Treddlesâon as soon as we can make out a direction.â

âItâs poor work writing letters when you want folks to come to you iâ trouble,â
said Mrs. Poyser. âHappen itâll be ever so long on the road, anâ never reach
her at last.â

Before Alick arrived with the message, Lisbethâs thoughts too had already flown
to Dinah, and she had said to Seth, âEh, thereâs no comfort for us iâ this
world any more, wiâout thee couldst get Dinah Morris to come to us, as she did
when my old man died. Iâd like her to come in anâ take me by thâ hand again,
anâ talk to me. Sheâd tell me the rights onât, belikeâsheâd happen know some
good iâ all this trouble anâ heart-break cominâ upoâ that poor lad, as neâer
done a bit oâ wrong inâs life, but war better nor anybody elseâs son, pick the
country round. Eh, my lad... Adam, my poor lad!â

âThee wouldstna like me to leave thee, to go and fetch Dinah?â said Seth, as
his mother sobbed and rocked herself to and fro.

âFetch her?â said Lisbeth, looking up and pausing from her grief, like a crying
child who hears some promise of consolation. âWhy, what place isât sheâs at, do
they say?â

âItâs a good way off, motherâLeeds, a big town. But I could be back in three
days, if thee couldst spare me.â

âNay, nay, I canna spare thee. Thee must go anâ see thy brother, anâ bring me
word what heâs a-doinâ. Mester Irwine said heâd come anâ tell me, but I canna
make out so well what it means when he tells me. Thee must go thysen, sinâ Adam
wonna let me go to him. Write a letter to Dinah canstna? Theeât fond enough oâ
writinâ when nobody wants thee.â

âIâm not sure where sheâd be iâ that big town,â said Seth. âIf Iâd gone myself,
I could haâ found out by asking the members oâ the Society. But perhaps if I
put Sarah Williamson, Methodist preacher, Leeds, oâ thâ outside, it might get
to her; for most like sheâd be wiâ Sarah Williamson.â

Alick came now with the message, and Seth, finding that Mrs. Poyser was writing
to Dinah, gave up the intention of writing himself; but he went to the Hall
Farm to tell them all he could suggest about the address of the letter, and
warn them that there might be some delay in the delivery, from his not knowing
an exact direction.

On leaving Lisbeth, Mr. Irwine had gone to Jonathan Burge, who had also a claim
to be acquainted with what was likely to keep Adam away from business for some
time; and before six oâclock that evening there were few people in Broxton and
Hayslope who had not heard the sad news. Mr. Irwine had not mentioned Arthurâs
name to Burge, and yet the story of his conduct towards Hetty, with all the
dark shadows cast upon it by its terrible consequences, was presently as well
known as that his grandfather was dead, and that he was come into the estate.
For Martin Poyser felt no motive to keep silence towards the one or two
neighbours who ventured to come and shake him sorrowfully by the hand on the
first day of his trouble; and Carroll, who kept his ears open to all that
passed at the rectory, had framed an inferential version of the story, and
found early opportunities of communicating it.

One of those neighbours who came to Martin Poyser and shook him by the hand
without speaking for some minutes was Bartle Massey. He had shut up his school,
and was on his way to the rectory, where he arrived about half-past seven in
the evening, and, sending his duty to Mr. Irwine, begged pardon for troubling
him at that hour, but had something particular on his mind. He was shown into
the study, where Mr. Irwine soon joined him.

âWell, Bartle?â said Mr. Irwine, putting out his hand. That was not his usual
way of saluting the schoolmaster, but trouble makes us treat all who feel with
us very much alike. âSit down.â

âYou know what Iâm come about as well as I do, sir, I daresay,â said Bartle.

âYou wish to know the truth about the sad news that has reached you... about
Hetty Sorrel?â

âNay, sir, what I wish to know is about Adam Bede. I understand you left him at
Stoniton, and I beg the favour of you to tell me whatâs the state of the poor
ladâs mind, and what he means to do. For as for that bit oâ pink-and-white
theyâve taken the trouble to put in jail, I donât value her a rotten nutânot a
rotten nutâonly for the harm or good that may come out of her to an honest
manâa lad Iâve set such store byâtrusted to, that heâd make my bit oâ knowledge
go a good way in the world.... Why, sir, heâs the only scholar Iâve had in this
stupid country that ever had the will or the head-piece for mathematics. If he
hadnât had so much hard work to do, poor fellow, he might have gone into the
higher branches, and then this might never have happenedâmight never have
happened.â

Bartle was heated by the exertion of walking fast in an agitated frame of mind,
and was not able to check himself on this first occasion of venting his
feelings. But he paused now to rub his moist forehead, and probably his moist
eyes also.

âYouâll excuse me, sir,â he said, when this pause had given him time to
reflect, âfor running on in this way about my own feelings, like that foolish
dog of mine howling in a storm, when thereâs nobody wants to listen to me. I
came to hear you speak, not to talk myselfâif youâll take the trouble to tell
me what the poor ladâs doing.â

âDonât put yourself under any restraint, Bartle,â said Mr. Irwine. âThe fact
is, Iâm very much in the same condition as you just now; Iâve a great deal
thatâs painful on my mind, and I find it hard work to be quite silent about my
own feelings and only attend to others. I share your concern for Adam, though
he is not the only one whose sufferings I care for in this affair. He intends
to remain at Stoniton till after the trial: it will come on probably a week
to-morrow. He has taken a room there, and I encouraged him to do so, because I
think it better he should be away from his own home at present; and, poor
fellow, he still believes Hetty is innocentâhe wants to summon up courage to
see her if he can; he is unwilling to leave the spot where she is.â

âDo you think the creaturâs guilty, then?â said Bartle. âDo you think theyâll
hang her?â

âIâm afraid it will go hard with her. The evidence is very strong. And one bad
symptom is that she denies everythingâdenies that she has had a child in the
face of the most positive evidence. I saw her myself, and she was obstinately
silent to me; she shrank up like a frightened animal when she saw me. I was
never so shocked in my life as at the change in her. But I trust that, in the
worst case, we may obtain a pardon for the sake of the innocent who are
involved.â

âStuff and nonsense!â said Bartle, forgetting in his irritation to whom he was
speaking. âI beg your pardon, sir, I mean itâs stuff and nonsense for the
innocent to care about her being hanged. For my own part, I think the sooner
such women are put out oâ the world the better; and the men that help âem to do
mischief had better go along with âem for that matter. What good will you do by
keeping such vermin alive, eating the victual that âud feed rational beings?
But if Adamâs fool enough to care about it, I donât want him to suffer more
thanâs needful.... Is he very much cut up, poor fellow?â Bartle added, taking
out his spectacles and putting them on, as if they would assist his
imagination.

âYes, Iâm afraid the grief cuts very deep,â said Mr. Irwine. âHe looks terribly
shattered, and a certain violence came over him now and then yesterday, which
made me wish I could have remained near him. But I shall go to Stoniton again
to-morrow, and I have confidence enough in the strength of Adamâs principle to
trust that he will be able to endure the worst without being driven to anything
rash.â

Mr. Irwine, who was involuntarily uttering his own thoughts rather than
addressing Bartle Massey in the last sentence, had in his mind the possibility
that the spirit of vengeance towards Arthur, which was the form Adamâs anguish
was continually taking, might make him seek an encounter that was likely to end
more fatally than the one in the Grove. This possibility heightened the anxiety
with which he looked forward to Arthurâs arrival. But Bartle thought Mr. Irwine
was referring to suicide, and his face wore a new alarm.

âIâll tell you what I have in my head, sir,â he said, âand I hope youâll
approve of it. Iâm going to shut up my schoolâif the scholars come, they must
go back again, thatâs allâand I shall go to Stoniton and look after Adam till
this business is over. Iâll pretend Iâm come to look on at the assizes; he
canât object to that. What do you think about it, sir?â

âWell,â said Mr. Irwine, rather hesitatingly, âthere would be some real
advantages in that... and I honour you for your friendship towards him, Bartle.
But... you must be careful what you say to him, you know. Iâm afraid you have
too little fellow-feeling in what you consider his weakness about Hetty.â

âTrust to me, sirâtrust to me. I know what you mean. Iâve been a fool myself in
my time, but thatâs between you and me. I shanât thrust myself on him only keep
my eye on him, and see that he gets some good food, and put in a word here and
there.â

âThen,â said Mr. Irwine, reassured a little as to Bartleâs discretion, âI think
youâll be doing a good deed; and it will be well for you to let Adamâs mother
and brother know that youâre going.â

âYes, sir, yes,â said Bartle, rising, and taking off his spectacles, âIâll do
that, Iâll do that; though the motherâs a whimpering thingâI donât like to come
within earshot of her; however, sheâs a straight-backed, clean woman, none of
your slatterns. I wish you good-bye, sir, and thank you for the time youâve
spared me. Youâre everybodyâs friend in this businessâeverybodyâs friend. Itâs
a heavy weight youâve got on your shoulders.â

âGood-bye, Bartle, till we meet at Stoniton, as I daresay we shall.â

Bartle hurried away from the rectory, evading Carrollâs conversational
advances, and saying in an exasperated tone to Vixen, whose short legs pattered
beside him on the gravel, âNow, I shall be obliged to take you with me, you
good-for-nothing woman. Youâd go fretting yourself to death if I left youâyou
know you would, and perhaps get snapped up by some tramp. And youâll be running
into bad company, I expect, putting your nose in every hole and corner where
youâve no business! But if you do anything disgraceful, Iâll disown youâmind
that, madam, mind that!â

Chapter XLI

The Eve of the Trial

An upper room in a dull Stoniton street, with two beds in itâone laid on the
floor. It is ten oâclock on Thursday night, and the dark wall opposite the
window shuts out the moonlight that might have struggled with the light of the
one dip candle by which Bartle Massey is pretending to read, while he is really
looking over his spectacles at Adam Bede, seated near the dark window.

You would hardly have known it was Adam without being told. His face has got
thinner this last week: he has the sunken eyes, the neglected beard of a man
just risen from a sick-bed. His heavy black hair hangs over his forehead, and
there is no active impulse in him which inclines him to push it off, that he
may be more awake to what is around him. He has one arm over the back of the
chair, and he seems to be looking down at his clasped hands. He is roused by a
knock at the door.

âThere he is,â said Bartle Massey, rising hastily and unfastening the door. It
was Mr. Irwine.

Adam rose from his chair with instinctive respect, as Mr. Irwine approached him
and took his hand.

âIâm late, Adam,â he said, sitting down on the chair which Bartle placed for
him, âbut I was later in setting off from Broxton than I intended to be, and I
have been incessantly occupied since I arrived. I have done everything now,
howeverâeverything that can be done to-night, at least. Let us all sit down.â

Adam took his chair again mechanically, and Bartle, for whom there was no chair
remaining, sat on the bed in the background.

âHave you seen her, sir?â said Adam tremulously.

âYes, Adam; I and the chaplain have both been with her this evening.â

âDid you ask her, sir... did you say anything about me?â

âYes,â said Mr. Irwine, with some hesitation, âI spoke of you. I said you
wished to see her before the trial, if she consented.â

As Mr. Irwine paused, Adam looked at him with eager, questioning eyes.

âYou know she shrinks from seeing any one, Adam. It is not only youâsome fatal
influence seems to have shut up her heart against her fellow-creatures. She has
scarcely said anything more than âNoâ either to me or the chaplain. Three or
four days ago, before you were mentioned to her, when I asked her if there was
any one of her family whom she would like to seeâto whom she could open her
mindâshe said, with a violent shudder, âTell them not to come near meâI wonât
see any of them.ââ

Adamâs head was hanging down again, and he did not speak. There was silence for
a few minutes, and then Mr. Irwine said, âI donât like to advise you against
your own feelings, Adam, if they now urge you strongly to go and see her
to-morrow morning, even without her consent. It is just possible,
notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, that the interview might affect
her favourably. But I grieve to say I have scarcely any hope of that. She
didnât seem agitated when I mentioned your name; she only said âNo,â in the
same cold, obstinate way as usual. And if the meeting had no good effect on
her, it would be pure, useless suffering to youâsevere suffering, I fear. She
is very much changed...â

Adam started up from his chair and seized his hat, which lay on the table. But
he stood still then, and looked at Mr. Irwine, as if he had a question to ask
which it was yet difficult to utter. Bartle Massey rose quietly, turned the key
in the door, and put it in his pocket.

âIs he come back?â said Adam at last.

âNo, he is not,â said Mr. Irwine, quietly. âLay down your hat, Adam, unless you
like to walk out with me for a little fresh air. I fear you have not been out
again to-day.â

âYou neednât deceive me, sir,â said Adam, looking hard at Mr. Irwine and
speaking in a tone of angry suspicion. âYou neednât be afraid of me. I only
want justice. I want him to feel what she feels. Itâs his work... she was a
child as it âud haâ gone tâ anybodyâs heart to look at... I donât care what
sheâs done... it was him brought her to it. And he shall know it... he shall
feel it... if thereâs a just God, he shall feel what it is tâ haâ brought a
child like her to sin and misery.â

âIâm not deceiving you, Adam,â said Mr. Irwine. âArthur Donnithorne is not come
backâwas not come back when I left. I have left a letter for him: he will know
all as soon as he arrives.â

âBut you donât mind about it,â said Adam indignantly. âYou think it doesnât
matter as she lies there in shame and misery, and he knows nothing about itâhe
suffers nothing.â

âAdam, he
will
knowâhe
will
suffer, long and bitterly. He has a
heart and a conscience: I canât be entirely deceived in his character. I am
convincedâI am sure he didnât fall under temptation without a struggle. He may
be weak, but he is not callous, not coldly selfish. I am persuaded that this
will be a shock of which he will feel the effects all his life. Why do you
crave vengeance in this way? No amount of torture that you could inflict on

him
could benefit
her
.â

âNoâO God, no,â Adam groaned out, sinking on his chair again; âbut then, thatâs
the deepest curse of all... thatâs what makes the blackness of it...
it can
never be undone
. My poor Hetty... she can never be my sweet Hetty again...
the prettiest thing God had madeâsmiling up at me... I thought she loved me...
and was good...â

Adamâs voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse undertone, as if he were
only talking to himself; but now he said abruptly, looking at Mr. Irwine, âBut
she isnât as guilty as they say? You donât think she is, sir? She canât haâ
done it.â

âThat perhaps can never be known with certainty, Adam,â Mr. Irwine answered
gently. âIn these cases we sometimes form our judgment on what seems to us
strong evidence, and yet, for want of knowing some small fact, our judgment is
wrong. But suppose the worst: you have no right to say that the guilt of her
crime lies with him, and that he ought to bear the punishment. It is not for us
men to apportion the shares of moral guilt and retribution. We find it
impossible to avoid mistakes even in determining who has committed a single
criminal act, and the problem how far a man is to be held responsible for the
unforeseen consequences of his own deed is one that might well make us tremble
to look into it. The evil consequences that may lie folded in a single act of
selfish indulgence is a thought so awful that it ought surely to awaken some
feeling less presumptuous than a rash desire to punish. You have a mind that
can understand this fully, Adam, when you are calm. Donât suppose I canât enter
into the anguish that drives you into this state of revengeful hatred. But
think of this: if you were to obey your passionâfor it
is
passion, and
you deceive yourself in calling it justiceâit might be with you precisely as it
has been with Arthur; nay, worse; your passion might lead you yourself into a
horrible crime.â

âNoânot worse,â said Adam, bitterly; âI donât believe itâs worseâIâd sooner do
itâIâd sooner do a wickedness as I could suffer for by myself than haâ brought

her
to do wickedness and then stand by and see âem punish her while they
let me alone; and all for a bit oâ pleasure, as, if heâd had a manâs heart in
him, heâd haâ cut his hand off sooner than heâd haâ taken it. What if he didnât
foresee whatâs happened? He foresaw enough; heâd no right to expect anything
but harm and shame to her. And then he wanted to smooth it off wiâ lies.
Noâthereâs plenty oâ things folks are hanged for not half so hateful as that.
Let a man do what he will, if he knows heâs to bear the punishment himself, he
isnât half so bad as a mean selfish coward as makes things easy tâ himself and
knows all the while the punishment âll fall on somebody else.â

âThere again you partly deceive yourself, Adam. There is no sort of wrong deed
of which a man can bear the punishment alone; you canât isolate yourself and
say that the evil which is in you shall not spread. Menâs lives are as
thoroughly blended with each other as the air they breathe: evil spreads as
necessarily as disease. I know, I feel the terrible extent of suffering this
sin of Arthurâs has caused to others; but so does every sin cause suffering to
others besides those who commit it. An act of vengeance on your part against
Arthur would simply be another evil added to those we are suffering under: you
could not bear the punishment alone; you would entail the worst sorrows on
every one who loves you. You would have committed an act of blind fury that
would leave all the present evils just as they were and add worse evils to
them. You may tell me that you meditate no fatal act of vengeance, but the
feeling in your mind is what gives birth to such actions, and as long as you
indulge it, as long as you do not see that to fix your mind on Arthurâs
punishment is revenge, and not justice, you are in danger of being led on to
the commission of some great wrong. Remember what you told me about your
feelings after you had given that blow to Arthur in the Grove.â

Adam was silent: the last words had called up a vivid image of the past, and
Mr. Irwine left him to his thoughts, while he spoke to Bartle Massey about old
Mr. Donnithorneâs funeral and other matters of an indifferent kind. But at
length Adam turned round and said, in a more subdued tone, âIâve not asked
about âem at thâ Hall Farm, sir. Is Mr. Poyser coming?â

âHe is come; he is in Stoniton to-night. But I could not advise him to see you,
Adam. His own mind is in a very perturbed state, and it is best he should not
see you till you are calmer.â

âIs Dinah Morris come to âem, sir? Seth said theyâd sent for her.â

âNo. Mr. Poyser tells me she was not come when he left. Theyâre afraid the
letter has not reached her. It seems they had no exact address.â

Adam sat ruminating a little while, and then said, âI wonder if Dinah âud haâ
gone to see her. But perhaps the Poysers would haâ been sorely against it,
since they wonât come nigh her themselves. But I think she would, for the
Methodists are great folks for going into the prisons; and Seth said he thought
she would. Sheâd a very tender way with her, Dinah had; I wonder if she could
haâ done any good. You never saw her, sir, did you?â

âYes, I did. I had a conversation with herâshe pleased me a good deal. And now
you mention it, I wish she would come, for it is possible that a gentle mild
woman like her might move Hetty to open her heart. The jail chaplain is rather
harsh in his manner.â

âBut itâs oâ no use if she doesnât come,â said Adam sadly.

âIf Iâd thought of it earlier, I would have taken some measures for finding her
out,â said Mr. Irwine, âbut itâs too late now, I fear... Well, Adam, I must go
now. Try to get some rest to-night. God bless you. Iâll see you early to-morrow
morning.â

Chapter XLII

The Morning of the Trial

At one oâclock the next day, Adam was alone in his dull upper room; his watch
lay before him on the table, as if he were counting the long minutes. He had no
knowledge of what was likely to be said by the witnesses on the trial, for he
had shrunk from all the particulars connected with Hettyâs arrest and
accusation. This brave active man, who would have hastened towards any danger
or toil to rescue Hetty from an apprehended wrong or misfortune, felt himself
powerless to contemplate irremediable evil and suffering. The susceptibility
which would have been an impelling force where there was any possibility of
action became helpless anguish when he was obliged to be passive, or else
sought an active outlet in the thought of inflicting justice on Arthur.
Energetic natures, strong for all strenuous deeds, will often rush away from a
hopeless sufferer, as if they were hard-hearted. It is the overmastering sense
of pain that drives them. They shrink by an ungovernable instinct, as they
would shrink from laceration. Adam had brought himself to think of seeing
Hetty, if she would consent to see him, because he thought the meeting might
possibly be a good to herâmight help to melt away this terrible hardness they
told him of. If she saw he bore her no ill will for what she had done to him,
she might open her heart to him. But this resolution had been an immense
effortâhe trembled at the thought of seeing her changed face, as a timid woman
trembles at the thought of the surgeonâs knife, and he chose now to bear the
long hours of suspense rather than encounter what seemed to him the more
intolerable agony of witnessing her trial.

Deep unspeakable suffering may well be called a baptism, a regeneration, the
initiation into a new state. The yearning memories, the bitter regret, the
agonized sympathy, the struggling appeals to the Invisible Rightâall the
intense emotions which had filled the days and nights of the past week, and
were compressing themselves again like an eager crowd into the hours of this
single morning, made Adam look back on all the previous years as if they had
been a dim sleepy existence, and he had only now awaked to full consciousness.
It seemed to him as if he had always before thought it a light thing that men
should suffer, as if all that he had himself endured and called sorrow before
was only a momentâs stroke that had never left a bruise. Doubtless a great
anguish may do the work of years, and we may come out from that baptism of fire
with a soul full of new awe and new pity.

âO God,â Adam groaned, as he leaned on the table and looked blankly at the face
of the watch, âand men have suffered like this before... and poor helpless
young things have suffered like her.... Such a little while ago looking so
happy and so pretty... kissing âem all, her grandfather and all of âem, and
they wishing her luck.... O my poor, poor Hetty... dost think on it now?â

Adam started and looked round towards the door. Vixen had begun to whimper, and
there was a sound of a stick and a lame walk on the stairs. It was Bartle
Massey come back. Could it be all over?

Bartle entered quietly, and, going up to Adam, grasped his hand and said, âIâm
just come to look at you, my boy, for the folks are gone out of court for a
bit.â

Adamâs heart beat so violently he was unable to speakâhe could only return the
pressure of his friendâs handâand Bartle, drawing up the other chair, came and
sat in front of him, taking off his hat and his spectacles.

âThatâs a thing never happened to me before,â he observed, âto go out oâ the
door with my spectacles on. I clean forgot to take âem off.â

The old man made this trivial remark, thinking it better not to respond at all
to Adamâs agitation: he would gather, in an indirect way, that there was
nothing decisive to communicate at present.

âAnd now,â he said, rising again, âI must see to your having a bit of the loaf,
and some of that wine Mr. Irwine sent this morning. Heâll be angry with me if
you donât have it. Come, now,â he went on, bringing forward the bottle and the
loaf and pouring some wine into a cup, âI must have a bit and a sup myself.
Drink a drop with me, my ladâdrink with me.â

Adam pushed the cup gently away and said, entreatingly, âTell me about it, Mr.
Masseyâtell me all about it. Was she there? Have they begun?â

âYes, my boy, yesâitâs taken all the time since I first went; but theyâre slow,
theyâre slow; and thereâs the counsel theyâve got for her puts a spoke in the
wheel whenever he can, and makes a deal to do with cross-examining the
witnesses and quarrelling with the other lawyers. Thatâs all he can do for the
money they give him; and itâs a big sumâitâs a big sum. But heâs a âcute
fellow, with an eye that âud pick the needles out of the hay in no time. If a
man had got no feelings, it âud be as good as a demonstration to listen to what
goes on in court; but a tender heart makes one stupid. Iâd have given up
figures for ever only to have had some good news to bring to you, my poor lad.â

âBut does it seem to be going against her?â said Adam. âTell me what theyâve
said. I must know it nowâI must know what they have to bring against her.â

âWhy, the chief evidence yet has been the doctors; all but Martin Poyserâpoor
Martin. Everybody in court felt for himâit was like one sob, the sound they
made when he came down again. The worst was when they told him to look at the
prisoner at the bar. It was hard work, poor fellowâit was hard work. Adam, my
boy, the blow falls heavily on him as well as you; you must help poor Martin;
you must show courage. Drink some wine now, and show me you mean to bear it
like a man.â

Bartle had made the right sort of appeal. Adam, with an air of quiet obedience,
took up the cup and drank a little.

âTell me how
she
looked,â he said presently.

âFrightened, very frightened, when they first brought her in; it was the first
sight of the crowd and the judge, poor creatur. And thereâs a lot oâ foolish
women in fine clothes, with gewgaws all up their arms and feathers on their
heads, sitting near the judge: theyâve dressed themselves out in that way, one
âud think, to be scarecrows and warnings against any man ever meddling with a
woman again. They put up their glasses, and stared and whispered. But after
that she stood like a white image, staring down at her hands and seeming
neither to hear nor see anything. And sheâs as white as a sheet. She didnât
speak when they asked her if sheâd plead âguiltyâ or ânot guilty,â and they
pleaded ânot guiltyâ for her. But when she heard her uncleâs name, there seemed
to go a shiver right through her; and when they told him to look at her, she
hung her head down, and cowered, and hid her face in her hands. Heâd much ado
to speak poor man, his voice trembled so. And the counsellorsâwho look as hard
as nails mostlyâI saw, spared him as much as they could. Mr. Irwine put himself
near him and went with him out oâ court. Ah, itâs a great thing in a manâs life
to be able to stand by a neighbour and uphold him in such trouble as that.â

âGod bless him, and you too, Mr. Massey,â said Adam, in a low voice, laying his
hand on Bartleâs arm.

âAye, aye, heâs good metal; he gives the right ring when you try him, our
parson does. A man oâ senseâsays no more thanâs needful. Heâs not one of those
that think they can comfort you with chattering, as if folks who stand by and
look on knew a deal better what the trouble was than those who have to bear it.
Iâve had to do with such folks in my timeâin the south, when I was in trouble
myself. Mr. Irwine is to be a witness himself, by and by, on her side, you
know, to speak to her character and bringing up.â

âBut the other evidence... does it go hard against her!â said Adam. âWhat do
you think, Mr. Massey? Tell me the truth.â

âYes, my lad, yes. The truth is the best thing to tell. It must come at last.
The doctorsâ evidence is heavy on herâis heavy. But sheâs gone on denying sheâs
had a child from first to last. These poor silly women-thingsâtheyâve not the
sense to know itâs no use denying whatâs proved. Itâll make against her with
the jury, I doubt, her being so obstinate: they may be less for recommending
her to mercy, if the verdictâs against her. But Mr. Irwine âull leave no stone
unturned with the judgeâyou may rely upon that, Adam.â

âIs there nobody to stand by her and seem to care for her in the court?â said
Adam.

âThereâs the chaplain oâ the jail sits near her, but heâs a sharp ferrety-faced
manâanother sort oâ flesh and blood to Mr. Irwine. They say the jail chaplains
are mostly the fag-end oâ the clergy.â

âThereâs one man as ought to be there,â said Adam bitterly. Presently he drew
himself up and looked fixedly out of the window, apparently turning over some
new idea in his mind.

âMr. Massey,â he said at last, pushing the hair off his forehead, âIâll go back
with you. Iâll go into court. Itâs cowardly of me to keep away. Iâll stand by
herâIâll own herâfor all sheâs been deceitful. They oughtnât to cast her
offâher own flesh and blood. We hand folks over to Godâs mercy, and show none
ourselves. I used to be hard sometimes: Iâll never be hard again. Iâll go, Mr.
MasseyâIâll go with you.â

There was a decision in Adamâs manner which would have prevented Bartle from
opposing him, even if he had wished to do so. He only said, âTake a bit, then,
and another sup, Adam, for the love of me. See, I must stop and eat a morsel.
Now, you take some.â

Nerved by an active resolution, Adam took a morsel of bread and drank some
wine. He was haggard and unshaven, as he had been yesterday, but he stood
upright again, and looked more like the Adam Bede of former days.

Chapter XLIII

The Verdict

The place fitted up that day as a court of justice was a grand old hall, now
destroyed by fire. The midday light that fell on the close pavement of human
heads was shed through a line of high pointed windows, variegated with the
mellow tints of old painted glass. Grim dusty armour hung in high relief in
front of the dark oaken gallery at the farther end, and under the broad arch of
the great mullioned window opposite was spread a curtain of old tapestry,
covered with dim melancholy figures, like a dozing indistinct dream of the
past. It was a place that through the rest of the year was haunted with the
shadowy memories of old kings and queens, unhappy, discrowned, imprisoned; but
to-day all those shadows had fled, and not a soul in the vast hall felt the
presence of any but a living sorrow, which was quivering in warm hearts.

But that sorrow seemed to have made it itself feebly felt hitherto, now when
Adam Bedeâs tall figure was suddenly seen being ushered to the side of the
prisonerâs dock. In the broad sunlight of the great hall, among the sleek
shaven faces of other men, the marks of suffering in his face were startling
even to Mr. Irwine, who had last seen him in the dim light of his small room;
and the neighbours from Hayslope who were present, and who told Hetty Sorrelâs
story by their firesides in their old age, never forgot to say how it moved
them when Adam Bede, poor fellow, taller by the head than most of the people
round him, came into court and took his place by her side.

But Hetty did not see him. She was standing in the same position Bartle Massey
had described, her hands crossed over each other and her eyes fixed on them.
Adam had not dared to look at her in the first moments, but at last, when the
attention of the court was withdrawn by the proceedings he turned his face
towards her with a resolution not to shrink.

Why did they say she was so changed? In the corpse we love, it is the

likeness
we seeâit is the likeness, which makes itself felt the more
keenly because something else
was
and
is not
. There they wereâthe
sweet face and neck, with the dark tendrils of hair, the long dark lashes, the
rounded cheek and the pouting lipsâpale and thin, yes, but like Hetty, and only
Hetty. Others thought she looked as if some demon had cast a blighting glance
upon her, withered up the womanâs soul in her, and left only a hard despairing
obstinacy. But the motherâs yearning, that completest type of the life in
another life which is the essence of real human love, feels the presence of the
cherished child even in the debased, degraded man; and to Adam, this pale,
hard-looking culprit was the Hetty who had smiled at him in the garden under
the apple-tree boughsâshe was that Hettyâs corpse, which he had trembled to
look at the first time, and then was unwilling to turn away his eyes from.

But presently he heard something that compelled him to listen, and made the
sense of sight less absorbing. A woman was in the witness-box, a middle-aged
woman, who spoke in a firm distinct voice. She said, âMy name is Sarah Stone. I
am a widow, and keep a small shop licensed to sell tobacco, snuff, and tea in
Church Lane, Stoniton. The prisoner at the bar is the same young woman who
came, looking ill and tired, with a basket on her arm, and asked for a lodging
at my house on Saturday evening, the 27th of February. She had taken the house
for a public, because there was a figure against the door. And when I said I
didnât take in lodgers, the prisoner began to cry, and said she was too tired
to go anywhere else, and she only wanted a bed for one night. And her
prettiness, and her condition, and something respectable about her clothes and
looks, and the trouble she seemed to be in made me as I couldnât find in my
heart to send her away at once. I asked her to sit down, and gave her some tea,
and asked her where she was going, and where her friends were. She said she was
going home to her friends: they were farming folks a good way off, and sheâd
had a long journey that had cost her more money than she expected, so as sheâd
hardly any money left in her pocket, and was afraid of going where it would
cost her much. She had been obliged to sell most of the things out of her
basket, but sheâd thankfully give a shilling for a bed. I saw no reason why I
shouldnât take the young woman in for the night. I had only one room, but there
were two beds in it, and I told her she might stay with me. I thought sheâd
been led wrong, and got into trouble, but if she was going to her friends, it
would be a good work to keep her out of further harm.â

The witness then stated that in the night a child was born, and she identified
the baby-clothes then shown to her as those in which she had herself dressed
the child.

âThose are the clothes. I made them myself, and had kept them by me ever since
my last child was born. I took a deal of trouble both for the child and the
mother. I couldnât help taking to the little thing and being anxious about it.
I didnât send for a doctor, for there seemed no need. I told the mother in the
day-time she must tell me the name of her friends, and where they lived, and
let me write to them. She said, by and by she would write herself, but not
to-day. She would have no nay, but she would get up and be dressed, in spite of
everything I could say. She said she felt quite strong enough; and it was
wonderful what spirit she showed. But I wasnât quite easy what I should do
about her, and towards evening I made up my mind Iâd go, after Meeting was
over, and speak to our minister about it. I left the house about half-past
eight oâclock. I didnât go out at the shop door, but at the back door, which
opens into a narrow alley. Iâve only got the ground-floor of the house, and the
kitchen and bedroom both look into the alley. I left the prisoner sitting up by
the fire in the kitchen with the baby on her lap. She hadnât cried or seemed
low at all, as she did the night before. I thought she had a strange look with
her eyes, and she got a bit flushed towards evening. I was afraid of the fever,
and I thought Iâd call and ask an acquaintance of mine, an experienced woman,
to come back with me when I went out. It was a very dark night. I didnât fasten
the door behind me; there was no lock; it was a latch with a bolt inside, and
when there was nobody in the house I always went out at the shop door. But I
thought there was no danger in leaving it unfastened that little while. I was
longer than I meant to be, for I had to wait for the woman that came back with
me. It was an hour and a half before we got back, and when we went in, the
candle was standing burning just as I left it, but the prisoner and the baby
were both gone. Sheâd taken her cloak and bonnet, but sheâd left the basket and
the things in it.... I was dreadful frightened, and angry with her for going. I
didnât go to give information, because Iâd no thought she meant to do any harm,
and I knew she had money in her pocket to buy her food and lodging. I didnât
like to set the constable after her, for sheâd a right to go from me if she
liked.â

The effect of this evidence on Adam was electrical; it gave him new force.
Hetty could not be guilty of the crimeâher heart must have clung to her
babyâelse why should she have taken it with her? She might have left it behind.
The little creature had died naturally, and then she had hidden it. Babies were
so liable to deathâand there might be the strongest suspicions without any
proof of guilt. His mind was so occupied with imaginary arguments against such
suspicions, that he could not listen to the cross-examination by Hettyâs
counsel, who tried, without result, to elicit evidence that the prisoner had
shown some movements of maternal affection towards the child. The whole time
this witness was being examined, Hetty had stood as motionless as before: no
word seemed to arrest her ear. But the sound of the next witnessâs voice
touched a chord that was still sensitive, she gave a start and a frightened
look towards him, but immediately turned away her head and looked down at her
hands as before. This witness was a man, a rough peasant. He said:

âMy name is John Olding. I am a labourer, and live at Teddâs Hole, two miles
out of Stoniton. A week last Monday, towards one oâclock in the afternoon, I
was going towards Hetton Coppice, and about a quarter of a mile from the
coppice I saw the prisoner, in a red cloak, sitting under a bit of a haystack
not far off the stile. She got up when she saw me, and seemed as if sheâd be
walking on the other way. It was a regular road through the fields, and nothing
very uncommon to see a young woman there, but I took notice of her because she
looked white and scared. I should have thought she was a beggar-woman, only for
her good clothes. I thought she looked a bit crazy, but it was no business of
mine. I stood and looked back after her, but she went right on while she was in
sight. I had to go to the other side of the coppice to look after some stakes.
Thereâs a road right through it, and bits of openings here and there, where the
trees have been cut down, and some of âem not carried away. I didnât go
straight along the road, but turned off towards the middle, and took a shorter
way towards the spot I wanted to get to. I hadnât got far out of the road into
one of the open places before I heard a strange cry. I thought it didnât come
from any animal I knew, but I wasnât for stopping to look about just then. But
it went on, and seemed so strange to me in that place, I couldnât help stopping
to look. I began to think I might make some money of it, if it was a new thing.
But I had hard work to tell which way it came from, and for a good while I kept
looking up at the boughs. And then I thought it came from the ground; and there
was a lot of timber-choppings lying about, and loose pieces of turf, and a
trunk or two. And I looked about among them, but could find nothing, and at
last the cry stopped. So I was for giving it up, and I went on about my
business. But when I came back the same way pretty nigh an hour after, I
couldnât help laying down my stakes to have another look. And just as I was
stooping and laying down the stakes, I saw something odd and round and whitish
lying on the ground under a nut-bush by the side of me. And I stooped down on
hands and knees to pick it up. And I saw it was a little babyâs hand.â

At these words a thrill ran through the court. Hetty was visibly trembling;
now, for the first time, she seemed to be listening to what a witness said.

âThere was a lot of timber-choppings put together just where the ground went
hollow, like, under the bush, and the hand came out from among them. But there
was a hole left in one place and I could see down it and see the childâs head;
and I made haste and did away the turf and the choppings, and took out the
child. It had got comfortable clothes on, but its body was cold, and I thought
it must be dead. I made haste back with it out of the wood, and took it home to
my wife. She said it was dead, and Iâd better take it to the parish and tell
the constable. And I said, âIâll lay my life itâs that young womanâs child as I
met going to the coppice.â But she seemed to be gone clean out of sight. And I
took the child on to Hetton parish and told the constable, and we went on to
Justice Hardy. And then we went looking after the young woman till dark at
night, and we went and gave information at Stoniton, as they might stop her.
And the next morning, another constable came to me, to go with him to the spot
where I found the child. And when we got there, there was the prisoner
a-sitting against the bush where I found the child; and she cried out when she
saw us, but she never offered to move. Sheâd got a big piece of bread on her
lap.â

Adam had given a faint groan of despair while this witness was speaking. He had
hidden his face on his arm, which rested on the boarding in front of him. It
was the supreme moment of his suffering: Hetty was guilty; and he was silently
calling to God for help. He heard no more of the evidence, and was unconscious
when the case for the prosecution had closedâunconscious that Mr. Irwine was in
the witness-box, telling of Hettyâs unblemished character in her own parish and
of the virtuous habits in which she had been brought up. This testimony could
have no influence on the verdict, but it was given as part of that plea for
mercy which her own counsel would have made if he had been allowed to speak for
herâa favour not granted to criminals in those stern times.

At last Adam lifted up his head, for there was a general movement round him.
The judge had addressed the jury, and they were retiring. The decisive moment
was not far off. Adam felt a shuddering horror that would not let him look at
Hetty, but she had long relapsed into her blank hard indifference. All eyes
were strained to look at her, but she stood like a statue of dull despair.

There was a mingled rustling, whispering, and low buzzing throughout the court
during this interval. The desire to listen was suspended, and every one had
some feeling or opinion to express in undertones. Adam sat looking blankly
before him, but he did not see the objects that were right in front of his
eyesâthe counsel and attorneys talking with an air of cool business, and Mr.
Irwine in low earnest conversation with the judgeâdid not see Mr. Irwine sit
down again in agitation and shake his head mournfully when somebody whispered
to him. The inward action was too intense for Adam to take in outward objects
until some strong sensation roused him.

It was not very long, hardly more than a quarter of an hour, before the knock
which told that the jury had come to their decision fell as a signal for
silence on every ear. It is sublimeâthat sudden pause of a great multitude
which tells that one soul moves in them all. Deeper and deeper the silence
seemed to become, like the deepening night, while the jurymenâs names were
called over, and the prisoner was made to hold up her hand, and the jury were
asked for their verdict.

âGuilty.â

It was the verdict every one expected, but there was a sigh of disappointment
from some hearts that it was followed by no recommendation to mercy. Still the
sympathy of the court was not with the prisoner. The unnaturalness of her crime
stood out the more harshly by the side of her hard immovability and obstinate
silence. Even the verdict, to distant eyes, had not appeared to move her, but
those who were near saw her trembling.

The stillness was less intense until the judge put on his black cap, and the
chaplain in his canonicals was observed behind him. Then it deepened again,
before the crier had had time to command silence. If any sound were heard, it
must have been the sound of beating hearts. The judge spoke, âHester
Sorrel....â

The blood rushed to Hettyâs face, and then fled back again as she looked up at
the judge and kept her wide-open eyes fixed on him, as if fascinated by fear.
Adam had not yet turned towards her, there was a deep horror, like a great
gulf, between them. But at the words âand then to be hanged by the neck till
you be dead,â a piercing shriek rang through the hall. It was Hettyâs shriek.
Adam started to his feet and stretched out his arms towards her. But the arms
could not reach her: she had fallen down in a fainting-fit, and was carried out
of court.

Chapter XLIV

Arthurâs Return

When Arthur Donnithorne landed at Liverpool and read the letter from his Aunt
Lydia, briefly announcing his grand-fatherâs death, his first feeling was,
âPoor Grandfather! I wish I could have got to him to be with him when he died.
He might have felt or wished something at the last that I shall never know now.
It was a lonely death.â

It is impossible to say that his grief was deeper than that. Pity and softened
memory took place of the old antagonism, and in his busy thoughts about the
future, as the chaise carried him rapidly along towards the home where he was
now to be master, there was a continually recurring effort to remember anything
by which he could show a regard for his grandfatherâs wishes, without
counteracting his own cherished aims for the good of the tenants and the
estate. But it is not in human natureâonly in human pretenceâfor a young man
like Arthur, with a fine constitution and fine spirits, thinking well of
himself, believing that others think well of him, and having a very ardent
intention to give them more and more reason for that good opinionâit is not
possible for such a young man, just coming into a splendid estate through the
death of a very old man whom he was not fond of, to feel anything very
different from exultant joy.
Now
his real life was beginning; now he
would have room and opportunity for action, and he would use them. He would
show the Loamshire people what a fine country gentleman was; he would not
exchange that career for any other under the sun. He felt himself riding over
the hills in the breezy autumn days, looking after favourite plans of drainage
and enclosure; then admired on sombre mornings as the best rider on the best
horse in the hunt; spoken well of on market-days as a first-rate landlord; by
and by making speeches at election dinners, and showing a wonderful knowledge
of agriculture; the patron of new ploughs and drills, the severe upbraider of
negligent landowners, and withal a jolly fellow that everybody must likeâhappy
faces greeting him everywhere on his own estate, and the neighbouring families
on the best terms with him. The Irwines should dine with him every week, and
have their own carriage to come in, for in some very delicate way that Arthur
would devise, the lay-impropriator of the Hayslope tithes would insist on
paying a couple of hundreds more to the vicar; and his aunt should be as
comfortable as possible, and go on living at the Chase, if she liked, in spite
of her old-maidish waysâat least until he was married, and that event lay in
the indistinct background, for Arthur had not yet seen the woman who would play
the lady-wife to the first-rate country gentleman.

These were Arthurâs chief thoughts, so far as a manâs thoughts through hours of
travelling can be compressed into a few sentences, which are only like the list
of names telling you what are the scenes in a long long panorama full of
colour, of detail, and of life. The happy faces Arthur saw greeting him were
not pale abstractions, but real ruddy faces, long familiar to him: Martin
Poyser was thereâthe whole Poyser family.

WhatâHetty?

Yes; for Arthur was at ease about Hettyânot quite at ease about the past, for a
certain burning of the ears would come whenever he thought of the scenes with
Adam last August, but at ease about her present lot. Mr. Irwine, who had been a
regular correspondent, telling him all the news about the old places and
people, had sent him word nearly three months ago that Adam Bede was not to
marry Mary Burge, as he had thought, but pretty Hetty Sorrel. Martin Poyser and
Adam himself had both told Mr. Irwine all about itâthat Adam had been deeply in
love with Hetty these two years, and that now it was agreed they were to be
married in March. That stalwart rogue Adam was more susceptible than the rector
had thought; it was really quite an idyllic love affair; and if it had not been
too long to tell in a letter, he would have liked to describe to Arthur the
blushing looks and the simple strong words with which the fine honest fellow
told his secret. He knew Arthur would like to hear that Adam had this sort of
happiness in prospect.

Yes, indeed! Arthur felt there was not air enough in the room to satisfy his
renovated life, when he had read that passage in the letter. He threw up the
windows, he rushed out of doors into the December air, and greeted every one
who spoke to him with an eager gaiety, as if there had been news of a fresh
Nelson victory. For the first time that day since he had come to Windsor, he
was in true boyish spirits. The load that had been pressing upon him was gone,
the haunting fear had vanished. He thought he could conquer his bitterness
towards Adam nowâcould offer him his hand, and ask to be his friend again, in
spite of that painful memory which would still make his ears burn. He had been
knocked down, and he had been forced to tell a lie: such things make a scar, do
what we will. But if Adam were the same again as in the old days, Arthur wished
to be the same too, and to have Adam mixed up with his business and his future,
as he had always desired before the accursed meeting in August. Nay, he would
do a great deal more for Adam than he should otherwise have done, when he came
into the estate; Hettyâs husband had a special claim on himâHetty herself
should feel that any pain she had suffered through Arthur in the past was
compensated to her a hundredfold. For really she could not have felt much,
since she had so soon made up her mind to marry Adam.

You perceive clearly what sort of picture Adam and Hetty made in the panorama
of Arthurâs thoughts on his journey homeward. It was March now; they were soon
to be married: perhaps they were already married. And
now
it was
actually in his power to do a great deal for them. Sweetâsweet little Hetty!
The little puss hadnât cared for him half as much as he cared for her; for he
was a great fool about her stillâwas almost afraid of seeing herâindeed, had
not cared much to look at any other woman since he parted from her. That little
figure coming towards him in the Grove, those dark-fringed childish eyes, the
lovely lips put up to kiss himâthat picture had got no fainter with the lapse
of months. And she would look just the same. It was impossible to think how he
could meet her: he should certainly tremble. Strange, how long this sort of
influence lasts, for he was certainly not in love with Hetty now. He had been
earnestly desiring, for months, that she should marry Adam, and there was
nothing that contributed more to his happiness in these moments than the
thought of their marriage. It was the exaggerating effect of imagination that
made his heart still beat a little more quickly at the thought of her. When he
saw the little thing again as she really was, as Adamâs wife, at work quite
prosaically in her new home, he should perhaps wonder at the possibility of his
past feelings. Thank heaven it had turned out so well! He should have plenty of
affairs and interests to fill his life now, and not be in danger of playing the
fool again.

Pleasant the crack of the post-boyâs whip! Pleasant the sense of being hurried
along in swift ease through English scenes, so like those round his own home,
only not quite so charming. Here was a market-townâvery much like
Treddlestonâwhere the arms of the neighbouring lord of the manor were borne on
the sign of the principal inn; then mere fields and hedges, their vicinity to a
market-town carrying an agreeable suggestion of high rent, till the land began
to assume a trimmer look, the woods were more frequent, and at length a white
or red mansion looked down from a moderate eminence, or allowed him to be aware
of its parapet and chimneys among the dense-looking masses of oaks and
elmsâmasses reddened now with early buds. And close at hand came the village:
the small church, with its red-tiled roof, looking humble even among the faded
half-timbered houses; the old green gravestones with nettles round them;
nothing fresh and bright but the children, opening round eyes at the swift
post-chaise; nothing noisy and busy but the gaping curs of mysterious pedigree.
What a much prettier village Hayslope was! And it should not be neglected like
this place: vigorous repairs should go on everywhere among farm-buildings and
cottages, and travellers in post-chaises, coming along the Rosseter road,
should do nothing but admire as they went. And Adam Bede should superintend all
the repairs, for he had a share in Burgeâs business now, and, if he liked,
Arthur would put some money into the concern and buy the old man out in another
year or two. That was an ugly fault in Arthurâs life, that affair last summer,
but the future should make amends. Many men would have retained a feeling of
vindictiveness towards Adam, but
he
would notâhe would resolutely
overcome all littleness of that kind, for he had certainly been very much in
the wrong; and though Adam had been harsh and violent, and had thrust on him a
painful dilemma, the poor fellow was in love, and had real provocation. No,
Arthur had not an evil feeling in his mind towards any human being: he was
happy, and would make every one else happy that came within his reach.

And here was dear old Hayslope at last, sleeping, on the hill, like a quiet old
place as it was, in the late afternoon sunlight, and opposite to it the great
shoulders of the Binton Hills, below them the purplish blackness of the hanging
woods, and at last the pale front of the Abbey, looking out from among the oaks
of the Chase, as if anxious for the heirâs return. âPoor Grandfather! And he
lies dead there.
He
was a young fellow once, coming into the estate and
making his plans. So the world goes round! Aunt Lydia must feel very desolate,
poor thing; but she shall be indulged as much as she indulges her fat Fido.â

The wheels of Arthurâs chaise had been anxiously listened for at the Chase, for
to-day was Friday, and the funeral had already been deferred two days. Before
it drew up on the gravel of the courtyard, all the servants in the house were
assembled to receive him with a grave, decent welcome, befitting a house of
death. A month ago, perhaps, it would have been difficult for them to have
maintained a suitable sadness in their faces, when Mr. Arthur was come to take
possession; but the hearts of the head-servants were heavy that day for another
cause than the death of the old squire, and more than one of them was longing
to be twenty miles away, as Mr. Craig was, knowing what was to become of Hetty
Sorrelâpretty Hetty Sorrelâwhom they used to see every week. They had the
partisanship of household servants who like their places, and were not inclined
to go the full length of the severe indignation felt against him by the farming
tenants, but rather to make excuses for him; nevertheless, the upper servants,
who had been on terms of neighbourly intercourse with the Poysers for many
years, could not help feeling that the longed-for event of the young squireâs
coming into the estate had been robbed of all its pleasantness.

To Arthur it was nothing surprising that the servants looked grave and sad: he
himself was very much touched on seeing them all again, and feeling that he was
in a new relation to them. It was that sort of pathetic emotion which has more
pleasure than pain in itâwhich is perhaps one of the most delicious of all
states to a good-natured man, conscious of the power to satisfy his good
nature. His heart swelled agreeably as he said, âWell, Mills, how is my aunt?â

But now Mr. Bygate, the lawyer, who had been in the house ever since the death,
came forward to give deferential greetings and answer all questions, and Arthur
walked with him towards the library, where his Aunt Lydia was expecting him.
Aunt Lydia was the only person in the house who knew nothing about Hetty. Her
sorrow as a maiden daughter was unmixed with any other thoughts than those of
anxiety about funeral arrangements and her own future lot; and, after the
manner of women, she mourned for the father who had made her life important,
all the more because she had a secret sense that there was little mourning for
him in other hearts.

But Arthur kissed her tearful face more tenderly than he had ever done in his
life before.

âDear Aunt,â he said affectionately, as he held her hand, â
your
loss is
the greatest of all, but you must tell me how to try and make it up to you all
the rest of your life.â

âIt was so sudden and so dreadful, Arthur,â poor Miss Lydia began, pouring out
her little plaints, and Arthur sat down to listen with impatient patience. When
a pause came, he said:

âNow, Aunt, Iâll leave you for a quarter of an hour just to go to my own room,
and then I shall come and give full attention to everything.â

âMy room is all ready for me, I suppose, Mills?â he said to the butler, who
seemed to be lingering uneasily about the entrance-hall.

âYes, sir, and there are letters for you; they are all laid on the
writing-table in your dressing-room.â

On entering the small anteroom which was called a dressing-room, but which
Arthur really used only to lounge and write in, he just cast his eyes on the
writing-table, and saw that there were several letters and packets lying there;
but he was in the uncomfortable dusty condition of a man who has had a long
hurried journey, and he must really refresh himself by attending to his
toilette a little, before he read his letters. Pym was there, making everything
ready for him, and soon, with a delightful freshness about him, as if he were
prepared to begin a new day, he went back into his dressing-room to open his
letters. The level rays of the low afternoon sun entered directly at the
window, and as Arthur seated himself in his velvet chair with their pleasant
warmth upon him, he was conscious of that quiet well-being which perhaps you
and I have felt on a sunny afternoon when, in our brightest youth and health,
life has opened a new vista for us, and long to-morrows of activity have
stretched before us like a lovely plain which there was no need for hurrying to
look at, because it was all our own.

The top letter was placed with its address upwards: it was in Mr. Irwineâs
handwriting, Arthur saw at once; and below the address was written, âTo be
delivered as soon as he arrives.â Nothing could have been less surprising to
him than a letter from Mr. Irwine at that moment: of course, there was
something he wished Arthur to know earlier than it was possible for them to see
each other. At such a time as that it was quite natural that Irwine should have
something pressing to say. Arthur broke the seal with an agreeable anticipation
of soon seeing the writer.

âI send this letter to meet you on your arrival, Arthur, because I may then
be at Stoniton, whither I am called by the most painful duty it has ever been
given me to perform, and it is right that you should know what I have to tell
you without delay.

Â Â Â Â âI will not attempt to add by one word of reproach to the retribution that
is now falling on you: any other words that I could write at this moment must
be weak and unmeaning by the side of those in which I must tell you the simple
fact.

Â Â Â Â âHetty Sorrel is in prison, and will be tried on Friday for the crime of
child-murder.â...

Arthur read no more. He started up from his chair and stood for a single minute
with a sense of violent convulsion in his whole frame, as if the life were
going out of him with horrible throbs; but the next minute he had rushed out of
the room, still clutching the letterâhe was hurrying along the corridor, and
down the stairs into the hall. Mills was still there, but Arthur did not see
him, as he passed like a hunted man across the hall and out along the gravel.
The butler hurried out after him as fast as his elderly limbs could run: he
guessed, he knew, where the young squire was going.

When Mills got to the stables, a horse was being saddled, and Arthur was
forcing himself to read the remaining words of the letter. He thrust it into
his pocket as the horse was led up to him, and at that moment caught sight of
Millsâ anxious face in front of him.

âTell them Iâm goneâgone to Stoniton,â he said in a muffled tone of
agitationâsprang into the saddle, and set off at a gallop.

Chapter XLV

In the Prison

Near sunset that evening an elderly gentleman was standing with his back
against the smaller entrance-door of Stoniton jail, saying a few last words to
the departing chaplain. The chaplain walked away, but the elderly gentleman
stood still, looking down on the pavement and stroking his chin with a
ruminating air, when he was roused by a sweet clear womanâs voice, saying, âCan
I get into the prison, if you please?â

He turned his head and looked fixedly at the speaker for a few moments without
answering.

âI have seen you before,â he said at last. âDo you remember preaching on the
village green at Hayslope in Loamshire?â

âYes, sir, surely. Are you the gentleman that stayed to listen on horseback?â

âYes. Why do you want to go into the prison?â

âI want to go to Hetty Sorrel, the young woman who has been condemned to
deathâand to stay with her, if I may be permitted. Have you power in the
prison, sir?â

âYes; I am a magistrate, and can get admittance for you. But did you know this
criminal, Hetty Sorrel?â

âYes, we are kin. My own aunt married her uncle, Martin Poyser. But I was away
at Leeds, and didnât know of this great trouble in time to get here before
to-day. I entreat you, sir, for the love of our heavenly Father, to let me go
to her and stay with her.â

âHow did you know she was condemned to death, if you are only just come from
Leeds?â

âI have seen my uncle since the trial, sir. He is gone back to his home now,
and the poor sinner is forsaken of all. I beseech you to get leave for me to be
with her.â

âWhat! Have you courage to stay all night in the prison? She is very sullen,
and will scarcely make answer when she is spoken to.â

âOh, sir, it may please God to open her heart still. Donât let us delay.â

âCome, then,â said the elderly gentleman, ringing and gaining admission, âI
know you have a key to unlock hearts.â

Dinah mechanically took off her bonnet and shawl as soon as they were within
the prison court, from the habit she had of throwing them off when she preached
or prayed, or visited the sick; and when they entered the jailerâs room, she
laid them down on a chair unthinkingly. There was no agitation visible in her,
but a deep concentrated calmness, as if, even when she was speaking, her soul
was in prayer reposing on an unseen support.

After speaking to the jailer, the magistrate turned to her and said, âThe
turnkey will take you to the prisonerâs cell and leave you there for the night,
if you desire it, but you canât have a light during the nightâit is contrary to
rules. My name is Colonel Townley: if I can help you in anything, ask the
jailer for my address and come to me. I take some interest in this Hetty
Sorrel, for the sake of that fine fellow, Adam Bede. I happened to see him at
Hayslope the same evening I heard you preach, and recognized him in court
to-day, ill as he looked.â

âAh, sir, can you tell me anything about him? Can you tell me where he lodges?
For my poor uncle was too much weighed down with trouble to remember.â

âClose by here. I inquired all about him of Mr. Irwine. He lodges over a
tinmanâs shop, in the street on the right hand as you entered the prison. There
is an old school-master with him. Now, good-bye: I wish you success.â

âFarewell, sir. I am grateful to you.â

As Dinah crossed the prison court with the turnkey, the solemn evening light
seemed to make the walls higher than they were by day, and the sweet pale face
in the cap was more than ever like a white flower on this background of gloom.
The turnkey looked askance at her all the while, but never spoke. He somehow
felt that the sound of his own rude voice would be grating just then. He struck
a light as they entered the dark corridor leading to the condemned cell, and
then said in his most civil tone, âItâll be pretty nigh dark in the cell
aâready, but I can stop with my light a bit, if you like.â

âNay, friend, thank you,â said Dinah. âI wish to go in alone.â

âAs you like,â said the jailer, turning the harsh key in the lock and opening
the door wide enough to admit Dinah. A jet of light from his lantern fell on
the opposite corner of the cell, where Hetty was sitting on her straw pallet
with her face buried in her knees. It seemed as if she were asleep, and yet the
grating of the lock would have been likely to waken her.

The door closed again, and the only light in the cell was that of the evening
sky, through the small high gratingâenough to discern human faces by. Dinah
stood still for a minute, hesitating to speak because Hetty might be asleep,
and looking at the motionless heap with a yearning heart. Then she said,
softly, âHetty!â

There was a slight movement perceptible in Hettyâs frameâa start such as might
have been produced by a feeble electrical shockâbut she did not look up. Dinah
spoke again, in a tone made stronger by irrepressible emotion, âHetty... itâs
Dinah.â

Again there was a slight startled movement through Hettyâs frame, and without
uncovering her face, she raised her head a little, as if listening.

âHetty... Dinah is come to you.â

After a momentâs pause, Hetty lifted her head slowly and timidly from her knees
and raised her eyes. The two pale faces were looking at each other: one with a
wild hard despair in it, the other full of sad yearning love. Dinah
unconsciously opened her arms and stretched them out.

âDonât you know me, Hetty? Donât you remember Dinah? Did you think I wouldnât
come to you in trouble?â

Hetty kept her eyes fixed on Dinahâs faceâat first like an animal that gazes,
and gazes, and keeps aloof.

âIâm come to be with you, Hettyânot to leave youâto stay with youâto be your
sister to the last.â

Slowly, while Dinah was speaking, Hetty rose, took a step forward, and was
clasped in Dinahâs arms.

They stood so a long while, for neither of them felt the impulse to move apart
again. Hetty, without any distinct thought of it, hung on this something that
was come to clasp her now, while she was sinking helpless in a dark gulf; and
Dinah felt a deep joy in the first sign that her love was welcomed by the
wretched lost one. The light got fainter as they stood, and when at last they
sat down on the straw pallet together, their faces had become indistinct.

Not a word was spoken. Dinah waited, hoping for a spontaneous word from Hetty,
but she sat in the same dull despair, only clutching the hand that held hers
and leaning her cheek against Dinahâs. It was the human contact she clung to,
but she was not the less sinking into the dark gulf.

Dinah began to doubt whether Hetty was conscious who it was that sat beside
her. She thought suffering and fear might have driven the poor sinner out of
her mind. But it was borne in upon her, as she afterwards said, that she must
not hurry Godâs work: we are overhasty to speakâas if God did not manifest
himself by our silent feeling, and make his love felt through ours. She did not
know how long they sat in that way, but it got darker and darker, till there
was only a pale patch of light on the opposite wall: all the rest was darkness.
But she felt the Divine presence more and moreânay, as if she herself were a
part of it, and it was the Divine pity that was beating in her heart and was
willing the rescue of this helpless one. At last she was prompted to speak and
find out how far Hetty was conscious of the present.

âHetty,â she said gently, âdo you know who it is that sits by your side?â

âYes,â Hetty answered slowly, âitâs Dinah.â

âAnd do you remember the time when we were at the Hall Farm together, and that
night when I told you to be sure and think of me as a friend in trouble?â

âYes,â said Hetty. Then, after a pause, she added, âBut you can do nothing for
me. You canât make âem do anything. Theyâll hang me oâ Mondayâitâs Friday now.â

As Hetty said the last words, she clung closer to Dinah, shuddering.

âNo, Hetty, I canât save you from that death. But isnât the suffering less hard
when you have somebody with you, that feels for youâthat you can speak to, and
say whatâs in your heart?... Yes, Hetty: you lean on me: you are glad to have
me with you.â

âYou wonât leave me, Dinah? Youâll keep close to me?â

âNo, Hetty, I wonât leave you. Iâll stay with you to the last.... But, Hetty,
there is some one else in this cell besides me, some one close to you.â

Hetty said, in a frightened whisper, âWho?â

âSome one who has been with you through all your hours of sin and troubleâwho
has known every thought you have hadâhas seen where you went, where you lay
down and rose up again, and all the deeds you have tried to hide in darkness.
And on Monday, when I canât follow youâwhen my arms canât reach youâwhen death
has parted usâHe who is with us now, and knows all, will be with you then. It
makes no differenceâwhether we live or die, we are in the presence of God.â

âOh, Dinah, wonât nobody do anything for me?
Will
they hang me for
certain?... I wouldnât mind if theyâd let me live.â

âMy poor Hetty, death is very dreadful to you. I know itâs dreadful. But if you
had a friend to take care of you after deathâin that other worldâsome one whose
love is greater than mineâwho can do everything?... If God our Father was your
friend, and was willing to save you from sin and suffering, so as you should
neither know wicked feelings nor pain again? If you could believe he loved you
and would help you, as you believe I love you and will help you, it wouldnât be
so hard to die on Monday, would it?â

âBut I canât know anything about it,â Hetty said, with sullen sadness.

âBecause, Hetty, you are shutting up your soul against him, by trying to hide
the truth. Godâs love and mercy can overcome all thingsâour ignorance, and
weakness, and all the burden of our past wickednessâall things but our wilful
sin, sin that we cling to, and will not give up. You believe in my love and
pity for you, Hetty, but if you had not let me come near you, if you wouldnât
have looked at me or spoken to me, youâd have shut me out from helping you. I
couldnât have made you feel my love; I couldnât have told you what I felt for
you. Donât shut Godâs love out in that way, by clinging to sin.... He canât
bless you while you have one falsehood in your soul; his pardoning mercy canât
reach you until you open your heart to him, and say, âI have done this great
wickedness; O God, save me, make me pure from sin.â While you cling to one sin
and will not part with it, it must drag you down to misery after death, as it
has dragged you to misery here in this world, my poor, poor Hetty. It is sin
that brings dread, and darkness, and despair: there is light and blessedness
for us as soon as we cast it off. God enters our souls then, and teaches us,
and brings us strength and peace. Cast it off now, Hettyânow: confess the
wickedness you have doneâthe sin you have been guilty of against your Heavenly
Father. Let us kneel down together, for we are in the presence of God.â

Hetty obeyed Dinahâs movement, and sank on her knees. They still held each
otherâs hands, and there was long silence. Then Dinah said, âHetty, we are
before God. He is waiting for you to tell the truth.â

Still there was silence. At last Hetty spoke, in a tone of beseechingâ

âDinah... help me... I canât feel anything like you...my heart is hard.â

Dinah held the clinging hand, and all her soul went forth in her voice:

âJesus, thou present Saviour! Thou hast known the depths of all sorrow: thou
hast entered that black darkness where God is not, and hast uttered the cry of
the forsaken. Come Lord, and gather of the fruits of thy travail and thy
pleading. Stretch forth thy hand, thou who art mighty to save to the uttermost,
and rescue this lost one. She is clothed round with thick darkness. The fetters
of her sin are upon her, and she cannot stir to come to thee. She can only feel
her heart is hard, and she is helpless. She cries to me, thy weak creature....
Saviour! It is a blind cry to thee. Hear it! Pierce the darkness! Look upon her
with thy face of love and sorrow that thou didst turn on him who denied thee,
and melt her hard heart.

âSee, Lord, I bring her, as they of old brought the sick and helpless, and thou
didst heal them. I bear her on my arms and carry her before thee. Fear and
trembling have taken hold on her, but she trembles only at the pain and death
of the body. Breathe upon her thy life-giving Spirit, and put a new fear within
herâthe fear of her sin. Make her dread to keep the accursed thing within her
soul. Make her feel the presence of the living God, who beholds all the past,
to whom the darkness is as noonday; who is waiting now, at the eleventh hour,
for her to turn to him, and confess her sin, and cry for mercyânow, before the
night of death comes, and the moment of pardon is for ever fled, like yesterday
that returneth not.

âSaviour! It is yet timeâtime to snatch this poor soul from everlasting
darkness. I believeâI believe in thy infinite love. What is
my
love or

my
pleading? It is quenched in thine. I can only clasp her in my weak
arms and urge her with my weak pity. Thouâthou wilt breathe on the dead soul,
and it shall arise from the unanswering sleep of death.

âYea, Lord, I see thee, coming through the darkness, coming, like the morning,
with healing on thy wings. The marks of thy agony are upon theeâI see, I see
thou art able and willing to saveâthou wilt not let her perish for ever. Come,
mighty Saviour! Let the dead hear thy voice. Let the eyes of the blind be
opened. Let her see that God encompasses her. Let her tremble at nothing but at
the sin that cuts her off from him. Melt the hard heart. Unseal the closed
lips: make her cry with her whole soul, âFather, I have sinned.â...â

âDinah,â Hetty sobbed out, throwing her arms round Dinahâs neck, âI will
speak... I will tell... I wonât hide it any more.â

But the tears and sobs were too violent. Dinah raised her gently from her knees
and seated her on the pallet again, sitting down by her side. It was a long
time before the convulsed throat was quiet, and even then they sat some time in
stillness and darkness, holding each otherâs hands. At last Hetty whispered, âI
did do it, Dinah... I buried it in the wood... the little baby... and it
cried... I heard it cry... ever such a way off... all night... and I went back
because it cried.â

She paused, and then spoke hurriedly in a louder, pleading tone.

âBut I thought perhaps it wouldnât dieâthere might somebody find it. I didnât
kill itâI didnât kill it myself. I put it down there and covered it up, and
when I came back it was gone.... It was because I was so very miserable,
Dinah... I didnât know where to go... and I tried to kill myself before, and I
couldnât. Oh, I tried so to drown myself in the pool, and I couldnât. I went to
WindsorâI ran awayâdid you know? I went to find him, as he might take care of
me; and he was gone; and then I didnât know what to do. I darednât go back home
againâI couldnât bear it. I couldnât have bore to look at anybody, for theyâd
have scorned me. I thought oâ you sometimes, and thought Iâd come to you, for I
didnât think youâd be cross with me, and cry shame on me. I thought I could
tell you. But then the other folks âud come to know it at last, and I couldnât
bear that. It was partly thinking oâ you made me come toward Stoniton; and,
besides, I was so frightened at going wandering about till I was a
beggar-woman, and had nothing; and sometimes it seemed as if I must go back to
the farm sooner than that. Oh, it was so dreadful, Dinah... I was so
miserable... I wished Iâd never been born into this world. I should never like
to go into the green fields againâI hated âem so in my misery.â

Hetty paused again, as if the sense of the past were too strong upon her for
words.

âAnd then I got to Stoniton, and I began to feel frightened that night, because
I was so near home. And then the little baby was born, when I didnât expect it;
and the thought came into my mind that I might get rid of it and go home again.
The thought came all of a sudden, as I was lying in the bed, and it got
stronger and stronger... I longed so to go back again... I couldnât bear being
so lonely and coming to beg for want. And it gave me strength and resolution to
get up and dress myself. I felt I must do it... I didnât know how... I thought
Iâd find a pool, if I could, like that other, in the corner of the field, in
the dark. And when the woman went out, I felt as if I was strong enough to do
anything... I thought I should get rid of all my misery, and go back home, and
never let âem know why I ran away. I put on my bonnet and shawl, and went out
into the dark street, with the baby under my cloak; and I walked fast till I
got into a street a good way off, and there was a public, and I got some warm
stuff to drink and some bread. And I walked on and on, and I hardly felt the
ground I trod on; and it got lighter, for there came the moonâoh, Dinah, it
frightened me when it first looked at me out oâ the cloudsâit never looked so
before; and I turned out of the road into the fields, for I was afraid oâ
meeting anybody with the moon shining on me. And I came to a haystack, where I
thought I could lie down and keep myself warm all night. There was a place cut
into it, where I could make me a bed, and I lay comfortable, and the baby was
warm against me; and I must have gone to sleep for a good while, for when I
woke it was morning, but not very light, and the baby was crying. And I saw a
wood a little way off... I thought thereâd perhaps be a ditch or a pond
there... and it was so early I thought I could hide the child there, and get a
long way off before folks was up. And then I thought Iâd go homeâIâd get rides
in carts and go home and tell âem Iâd been to try and see for a place, and
couldnât get one. I longed so for it, Dinah, I longed so to be safe at home. I
donât know how I felt about the baby. I seemed to hate itâit was like a heavy
weight hanging round my neck; and yet its crying went through me, and I
darednât look at its little hands and face. But I went on to the wood, and I
walked about, but there was no water....â

Hetty shuddered. She was silent for some moments, and when she began again, it
was in a whisper.

âI came to a place where there was lots of chips and turf, and I sat down on
the trunk of a tree to think what I should do. And all of a sudden I saw a hole
under the nut-tree, like a little grave. And it darted into me like
lightningâIâd lay the baby there and cover it with the grass and the chips. I
couldnât kill it any other way. And Iâd done it in a minute; and, oh, it cried
so, DinahâI
couldnât
cover it quite upâI thought perhaps somebody âud
come and take care of it, and then it wouldnât die. And I made haste out of the
wood, but I could hear it crying all the while; and when I got out into the
fields, it was as if I was held fastâI couldnât go away, for all I wanted so to
go. And I sat against the haystack to watch if anybody âud come. I was very
hungry, and Iâd only a bit of bread left, but I couldnât go away. And after
ever such a whileâhours and hoursâthe man cameâhim in a smock-frock, and he
looked at me so, I was frightened, and I made haste and went on. I thought he
was going to the wood and would perhaps find the baby. And I went right on,
till I came to a village, a long way off from the wood, and I was very sick,
and faint, and hungry. I got something to eat there, and bought a loaf. But I
was frightened to stay. I heard the baby crying, and thought the other folks
heard it tooâand I went on. But I was so tired, and it was getting towards
dark. And at last, by the roadside there was a barnâever such a way off any
houseâlike the barn in Abbotâs Close, and I thought I could go in there and
hide myself among the hay and straw, and nobody âud be likely to come. I went
in, and it was half full oâ trusses of straw, and there was some hay too. And I
made myself a bed, ever so far behind, where nobody could find me; and I was so
tired and weak, I went to sleep.... But oh, the babyâs crying kept waking me,
and I thought that man as looked at me so was come and laying hold of me. But I
must have slept a long while at last, though I didnât know, for when I got up
and went out of the barn, I didnât know whether it was night or morning. But it
was morning, for it kept getting lighter, and I turned back the way Iâd come. I
couldnât help it, Dinah; it was the babyâs crying made me goâand yet I was
frightened to death. I thought that man in the smock-frock âud see me and know
I put the baby there. But I went on, for all that. Iâd left off thinking about
going homeâit had gone out oâ my mind. I saw nothing but that place in the wood
where Iâd buried the baby... I see it now. Oh Dinah! shall I allays see it?â

Hetty clung round Dinah and shuddered again. The silence seemed long before she
went on.

âI met nobody, for it was very early, and I got into the wood.... I knew the
way to the place... the place against the nut-tree; and I could hear it crying
at every step.... I thought it was alive.... I donât know whether I was
frightened or glad... I donât know what I felt. I only know I was in the wood
and heard the cry. I donât know what I felt till I saw the baby was gone. And
when Iâd put it there, I thought I should like somebody to find it and save it
from dying; but when I saw it was gone, I was struck like a stone, with fear. I
never thought oâ stirring, I felt so weak. I knew I couldnât run away, and
everybody as saw me âud know about the baby. My heart went like a stone. I
couldnât wish or try for anything; it seemed like as if I should stay there for
ever, and nothing âud ever change. But they came and took me away.â

Hetty was silent, but she shuddered again, as if there was still something
behind; and Dinah waited, for her heart was so full that tears must come before
words. At last Hetty burst out, with a sob, âDinah, do you think God will take
away that crying and the place in the wood, now Iâve told everything?â

âLet us pray, poor sinner. Let us fall on our knees again, and pray to the God
of all mercy.â

Chapter XLVI

The Hours of Suspense

On Sunday morning, when the church bells in Stoniton were ringing for morning
service, Bartle Massey re-entered Adamâs room, after a short absence, and said,
âAdam, hereâs a visitor wants to see you.â

Adam was seated with his back towards the door, but he started up and turned
round instantly, with a flushed face and an eager look. His face was even
thinner and more worn than we have seen it before, but he was washed and shaven
this Sunday morning.

âIs it any news?â he said.

âKeep yourself quiet, my lad,â said Bartle; âkeep quiet. Itâs not what youâre
thinking of. Itâs the young Methodist woman come from the prison. Sheâs at the
bottom oâ the stairs, and wants to know if you think well to see her, for she
has something to say to you about that poor castaway; but she wouldnât come in
without your leave, she said. She thought youâd perhaps like to go out and
speak to her. These preaching women are not so backâard commonly,â Bartle
muttered to himself.

âAsk her to come in,â said Adam.

He was standing with his face towards the door, and as Dinah entered, lifting
up her mild grey eyes towards him, she saw at once the great change that had
come since the day when she had looked up at the tall man in the cottage. There
was a trembling in her clear voice as she put her hand into his and said, âBe
comforted, Adam Bede, the Lord has not forsaken her.â

âBless you for coming to her,â Adam said. âMr. Massey brought me word yesterday
as you was come.â

They could neither of them say any more just yet, but stood before each other
in silence; and Bartle Massey, too, who had put on his spectacles, seemed
transfixed, examining Dinahâs face. But he recovered himself first, and said,
âSit down, young woman, sit down,â placing the chair for her and retiring to
his old seat on the bed.

âThank you, friend; I wonât sit down,â said Dinah, âfor I must hasten back. She
entreated me not to stay long away. What I came for, Adam Bede, was to pray you
to go and see the poor sinner and bid her farewell. She desires to ask your
forgiveness, and it is meet you should see her to-day, rather than in the early
morning, when the time will be short.â

Adam stood trembling, and at last sank down on his chair again.

âIt wonât be,â he said, âitâll be put offâthereâll perhaps come a pardon. Mr.
Irwine said there was hope. He said, I neednât quite give it up.â

âThatâs a blessed thought to me,â said Dinah, her eyes filling with tears.
âItâs a fearful thing hurrying her soul away so fast.â

âBut let what will be,â she added presently. âYou will surely come, and let her
speak the words that are in her heart. Although her poor soul is very dark and
discerns little beyond the things of the flesh, she is no longer hard. She is
contrite, she has confessed all to me. The pride of her heart has given way,
and she leans on me for help and desires to be taught. This fills me with
trust, for I cannot but think that the brethren sometimes err in measuring the
Divine love by the sinnerâs knowledge. She is going to write a letter to the
friends at the Hall Farm for me to give them when she is gone, and when I told
her you were here, she said, âI should like to say good-bye to Adam and ask him
to forgive me.â You will come, Adam? Perhaps you will even now come back with
me.â

âI canât,â Adam said. âI canât say good-bye while thereâs any hope. Iâm
listening, and listeningâI canât think oâ nothing but that. It canât be as
sheâll die that shameful deathâI canât bring my mind to it.â

He got up from his chair again and looked away out of the window, while Dinah
stood with compassionate patience. In a minute or two he turned round and said,

âI
will
come, Dinah... to-morrow morning... if it must be. I may have
more strength to bear it, if I know it
must
be. Tell her, I forgive her;
tell her I will comeâat the very last.â

âI will not urge you against the voice of your own heart,â said Dinah. âI must
hasten back to her, for it is wonderful how she clings now, and was not willing
to let me out of her sight. She used never to make any return to my affection
before, but now tribulation has opened her heart. Farewell, Adam. Our heavenly
Father comfort you and strengthen you to bear all things.â Dinah put out her
hand, and Adam pressed it in silence.

Bartle Massey was getting up to lift the stiff latch of the door for her, but
before he could reach it, she had said gently, âFarewell, friend,â and was
gone, with her light step down the stairs.

âWell,â said Bartle, taking off his spectacles and putting them into his
pocket, âif there must be women to make trouble in the world, itâs but fair
there should be women to be comforters under it; and sheâs oneâsheâs one. Itâs
a pity sheâs a Methodist; but thereâs no getting a woman without some
foolishness or other.â

Adam never went to bed that night. The excitement of suspense, heightening with
every hour that brought him nearer the fatal moment, was too great, and in
spite of his entreaties, in spite of his promises that he would be perfectly
quiet, the schoolmaster watched too.

âWhat does it matter to me, lad?â Bartle said: âa nightâs sleep more or less? I
shall sleep long enough, by and by, underground. Let me keep thee company in
trouble while I can.â

It was a long and dreary night in that small chamber. Adam would sometimes get
up and tread backwards and forwards along the short space from wall to wall;
then he would sit down and hide his face, and no sound would be heard but the
ticking of the watch on the table, or the falling of a cinder from the fire
which the schoolmaster carefully tended. Sometimes he would burst out into
vehement speech,

âIf I could haâ done anything to save herâif my bearing anything would haâ done
any good... but tâ have to sit still, and know it, and do nothing... itâs hard
for a man to bear... and to think oâ what might haâ been now, if it hadnât been
for
him
.... O God, itâs the very day we should haâ been married.â

âAye, my lad,â said Bartle tenderly, âitâs heavyâitâs heavy. But you must
remember this: when you thought of marrying her, youâd a notion sheâd got
another sort of a nature inside her. You didnât think she could have got
hardened in that little while to do what sheâs done.â

âI knowâI know that,â said Adam. âI thought she was loving and tender-hearted,
and wouldnât tell a lie, or act deceitful. How could I think any other way? And
if heâd never come near her, and Iâd married her, and been loving to her, and
took care of her, she might never haâ done anything bad. What would it haâ
signifiedâmy having a bit oâ trouble with her? It âud haâ been nothing to
this.â

âThereâs no knowing, my ladâthereâs no knowing what might have come. The
smartâs bad for you to bear now: you must have timeâyou must have time. But
Iâve that opinion of you, that youâll rise above it all and be a man again, and
there may good come out of this that we donât see.â

âGood come out of it!â said Adam passionately. âThat doesnât alter thâ evil:

her
ruin canât be undone. I hate that talk oâ people, as if there was a
way oâ making amends for everything. Theyâd more need be brought to see as the
wrong they do can never be altered. When a manâs spoiled his fellow-creaturâs
life, heâs no right to comfort himself with thinking good may come out of it.
Somebody elseâs good doesnât alter her shame and misery.â

âWell, lad, well,â said Bartle, in a gentle tone, strangely in contrast with
his usual peremptoriness and impatience of contradiction, âitâs likely enough I
talk foolishness. Iâm an old fellow, and itâs a good many years since I was in
trouble myself. Itâs easy finding reasons why other folks should be patient.â

âMr. Massey,â said Adam penitently, âIâm very hot and hasty. I owe you
something different; but you mustnât take it ill of me.â

âNot I, ladânot I.â

So the night wore on in agitation till the chill dawn and the growing light
brought the tremulous quiet that comes on the brink of despair. There would
soon be no more suspense.

âLet us go to the prison now, Mr. Massey,â said Adam, when he saw the hand of
his watch at six. âIf thereâs any news come, we shall hear about it.â

The people were astir already, moving rapidly, in one direction, through the
streets. Adam tried not to think where they were going, as they hurried past
him in that short space between his lodging and the prison gates. He was
thankful when the gates shut him in from seeing those eager people.

No; there was no news comeâno pardonâno reprieve.

Adam lingered in the court half an hour before he could bring himself to send
word to Dinah that he was come. But a voice caught his ear: he could not shut
out the words.

âThe cart is to set off at half-past seven.â

It must be saidâthe last good-bye: there was no help.

In ten minutes from that time, Adam was at the door of the cell. Dinah had sent
him word that she could not come to him; she could not leave Hetty one moment;
but Hetty was prepared for the meeting.

He could not see her when he entered, for agitation deadened his senses, and
the dim cell was almost dark to him. He stood a moment after the door closed
behind him, trembling and stupefied.

But he began to see through the dimnessâto see the dark eyes lifted up to him
once more, but with no smile in them. O God, how sad they looked! The last time
they had met his was when he parted from her with his heart full of joyous
hopeful love, and they looked out with a tearful smile from a pink, dimpled,
childish face. The face was marble now; the sweet lips were pallid and
half-open and quivering; the dimples were all goneâall but one, that never
went; and the eyesâO, the worst of all was the likeness they had to Hettyâs.
They were Hettyâs eyes looking at him with that mournful gaze, as if she had
come back to him from the dead to tell him of her misery.

She was clinging close to Dinah; her cheek was against Dinahâs. It seemed as if
her last faint strength and hope lay in that contact, and the pitying love that
shone out from Dinahâs face looked like a visible pledge of the Invisible
Mercy.

When the sad eyes metâwhen Hetty and Adam looked at each otherâshe felt the
change in him too, and it seemed to strike her with fresh fear. It was the
first time she had seen any being whose face seemed to reflect the change in
herself: Adam was a new image of the dreadful past and the dreadful present.
She trembled more as she looked at him.

âSpeak to him, Hetty,â Dinah said; âtell him what is in your heart.â

Hetty obeyed her, like a little child.

âAdam... Iâm very sorry... I behaved very wrong to you... will you forgive
me... before I die?â

Adam answered with a half-sob, âYes, I forgive thee Hetty. I forgave thee long
ago.â

It had seemed to Adam as if his brain would burst with the anguish of meeting
Hettyâs eyes in the first moments, but the sound of her voice uttering these
penitent words touched a chord which had been less strained. There was a sense
of relief from what was becoming unbearable, and the rare tears cameâthey had
never come before, since he had hung on Sethâs neck in the beginning of his
sorrow.

Hetty made an involuntary movement towards him, some of the love that she had
once lived in the midst of was come near her again. She kept hold of Dinahâs
hand, but she went up to Adam and said timidly, âWill you kiss me again, Adam,
for all Iâve been so wicked?â

Adam took the blanched wasted hand she put out to him, and they gave each other
the solemn unspeakable kiss of a lifelong parting.

âAnd tell him,â Hetty said, in rather a stronger voice, âtell him... for
thereâs nobody else to tell him... as I went after him and couldnât find him...
and I hated him and cursed him once... but Dinah says I should forgive him...
and I try... for else God wonât forgive me.â

There was a noise at the door of the cell nowâthe key was being turned in the
lock, and when the door opened, Adam saw indistinctly that there were several
faces there. He was too agitated to see moreâeven to see that Mr. Irwineâs face
was one of them. He felt that the last preparations were beginning, and he
could stay no longer. Room was silently made for him to depart, and he went to
his chamber in loneliness, leaving Bartle Massey to watch and see the end.

Chapter XLVII

The Last Moment

It was a sight that some people remembered better even than their own
sorrowsâthe sight in that grey clear morning, when the fatal cart with the two
young women in it was descried by the waiting watching multitude, cleaving its
way towards the hideous symbol of a deliberately inflicted sudden death.

All Stoniton had heard of Dinah Morris, the young Methodist woman who had
brought the obstinate criminal to confess, and there was as much eagerness to
see her as to see the wretched Hetty.

But Dinah was hardly conscious of the multitude. When Hetty had caught sight of
the vast crowd in the distance, she had clutched Dinah convulsively.

âClose your eyes, Hetty,â Dinah said, âand let us pray without ceasing to God.â

And in a low voice, as the cart went slowly along through the midst of the
gazing crowd, she poured forth her soul with the wrestling intensity of a last
pleading, for the trembling creature that clung to her and clutched her as the
only visible sign of love and pity.

Dinah did not know that the crowd was silent, gazing at her with a sort of
aweâshe did not even know how near they were to the fatal spot, when the cart
stopped, and she shrank appalled at a loud shout hideous to her ear, like a
vast yell of demons. Hettyâs shriek mingled with the sound, and they clasped
each other in mutual horror.

But it was not a shout of execrationânot a yell of exultant cruelty.

It was a shout of sudden excitement at the appearance of a horseman cleaving
the crowd at full gallop. The horse is hot and distressed, but answers to the
desperate spurring; the rider looks as if his eyes were glazed by madness, and
he saw nothing but what was unseen by others. See, he has something in his
handâhe is holding it up as if it were a signal.

The Sheriff knows him: it is Arthur Donnithorne, carrying in his hand a
hard-won release from death.

Chapter XLVIII

Another Meeting in the Wood

The next day, at evening, two men were walking from opposite points towards the
same scene, drawn thither by a common memory. The scene was the Grove by
Donnithorne Chase: you know who the men were.

The old squireâs funeral had taken place that morning, the will had been read,
and now in the first breathing-space, Arthur Donnithorne had come out for a
lonely walk, that he might look fixedly at the new future before him and
confirm himself in a sad resolution. He thought he could do that best in the
Grove.

Adam too had come from Stoniton on Monday evening, and to-day he had not left
home, except to go to the family at the Hall Farm and tell them everything that
Mr. Irwine had left untold. He had agreed with the Poysers that he would follow
them to their new neighbourhood, wherever that might be, for he meant to give
up the management of the woods, and, as soon as it was practicable, he would
wind up his business with Jonathan Burge and settle with his mother and Seth in
a home within reach of the friends to whom he felt bound by a mutual sorrow.

âSeth and me are sure to find work,â he said. âA man thatâs got our trade at
his finger-ends is at home everywhere; and we must make a new start. My mother
wonât stand in the way, for sheâs told me, since I came home, sheâd made up her
mind to being buried in another parish, if I wished it, and if Iâd be more
comfortable elsewhere. Itâs wonderful how quiet sheâs been ever since I came
back. It seems as if the very greatness oâ the trouble had quieted and calmed
her. We shall all be better in a new country, though thereâs some I shall be
loath to leave behind. But I wonât part from you and yours, if I can help it,
Mr. Poyser. Troubleâs made us kin.â

âAye, lad,â said Martin. âWeâll go out oâ hearing oâ that manâs name. But I
doubt we shall neâer go far enough for folks not to find out as weâve got them
belonging to us as are transported oâer the seas, and were like to be hanged.
We shall have that flyinâ up in our faces, and our childrenâs after us.â

That was a long visit to the Hall Farm, and drew too strongly on Adamâs
energies for him to think of seeing others, or re-entering on his old
occupations till the morrow. âBut to-morrow,â he said to himself, âIâll go to
work again. I shall learn to like it again some time, maybe; and itâs right
whether I like it or not.â

This evening was the last he would allow to be absorbed by sorrow: suspense was
gone now, and he must bear the unalterable. He was resolved not to see Arthur
Donnithorne again, if it were possible to avoid him. He had no message to
deliver from Hetty now, for Hetty had seen Arthur. And Adam distrusted
himselfâhe had learned to dread the violence of his own feeling. That word of
Mr. Irwineâsâthat he must remember what he had felt after giving the last blow
to Arthur in the Groveâhad remained with him.

These thoughts about Arthur, like all thoughts that are charged with strong
feeling, were continually recurring, and they always called up the image of the
Groveâof that spot under the overarching boughs where he had caught sight of
the two bending figures, and had been possessed by sudden rage.

âIâll go and see it again to-night for the last time,â he said; âitâll do me
good; itâll make me feel over again what I felt when Iâd knocked him down. I
felt what poor empty work it was, as soon as Iâd done it,
before
I began
to think he might be dead.â

In this way it happened that Arthur and Adam were walking towards the same spot
at the same time.

Adam had on his working-dress again, now, for he had thrown off the other with
a sense of relief as soon as he came home; and if he had had the basket of
tools over his shoulder, he might have been taken, with his pale wasted face,
for the spectre of the Adam Bede who entered the Grove on that August evening
eight months ago. But he had no basket of tools, and he was not walking with
the old erectness, looking keenly round him; his hands were thrust in his side
pockets, and his eyes rested chiefly on the ground. He had not long entered the
Grove, and now he paused before a beech. He knew that tree well; it was the
boundary mark of his youthâthe sign, to him, of the time when some of his
earliest, strongest feelings had left him. He felt sure they would never
return. And yet, at this moment, there was a stirring of affection at the
remembrance of that Arthur Donnithorne whom he had believed in before he had
come up to this beech eight months ago. It was affection for the dead:

that
Arthur existed no longer.

He was disturbed by the sound of approaching footsteps, but the beech stood at
a turning in the road, and he could not see who was coming until the tall slim
figure in deep mourning suddenly stood before him at only two yardsâ distance.
They both started, and looked at each other in silence. Often, in the last
fortnight, Adam had imagined himself as close to Arthur as this, assailing him
with words that should be as harrowing as the voice of remorse, forcing upon
him a just share in the misery he had caused; and often, too, he had told
himself that such a meeting had better not be. But in imagining the meeting he
had always seen Arthur, as he had met him on that evening in the Grove, florid,
careless, light of speech; and the figure before him touched him with the signs
of suffering. Adam knew what suffering wasâhe could not lay a cruel finger on a
bruised man. He felt no impulse that he needed to resist. Silence was more just
than reproach. Arthur was the first to speak.

âAdam,â he said, quietly, âit may be a good thing that we have met here, for I
wished to see you. I should have asked to see you to-morrow.â

He paused, but Adam said nothing.

âI know it is painful to you to meet me,â Arthur went on, âbut it is not likely
to happen again for years to come.â

âNo, sir,â said Adam, coldly, âthat was what I meant to write to you to-morrow,
as it would be better all dealings should be at an end between us, and somebody
else put in my place.â

Arthur felt the answer keenly, and it was not without an effort that he spoke
again.

âIt was partly on that subject I wished to speak to you. I donât want to lessen
your indignation against me, or ask you to do anything for my sake. I only wish
to ask you if you will help me to lessen the evil consequences of the past,
which is unchangeable. I donât mean consequences to myself, but to others. It
is but little I can do, I know. I know the worst consequences will remain; but
something may be done, and you can help me. Will you listen to me patiently?â

âYes, sir,â said Adam, after some hesitation; âIâll hear what it is. If I can
help to mend anything, I will. Anger âull mend nothing, I know. Weâve had
enough oâ that.â

âI was going to the Hermitage,â said Arthur. âWill you go there with me and sit
down? We can talk better there.â

The Hermitage had never been entered since they left it together, for Arthur
had locked up the key in his desk. And now, when he opened the door, there was
the candle burnt out in the socket; there was the chair in the same place where
Adam remembered sitting; there was the waste-paper basket full of scraps, and
deep down in it, Arthur felt in an instant, there was the little pink silk
handkerchief. It would have been painful to enter this place if their previous
thoughts had been less painful.

They sat down opposite each other in the old places, and Arthur said, âIâm
going away, Adam; Iâm going into the army.â

Poor Arthur felt that Adam ought to be affected by this announcementâought to
have a movement of sympathy towards him. But Adamâs lips remained firmly
closed, and the expression of his face unchanged.

âWhat I want to say to you,â Arthur continued, âis this: one of my reasons for
going away is that no one else may leave Hayslopeâmay leave their home on my
account. I would do anything, there is no sacrifice I would not make, to
prevent any further injury to others through myâthrough what has happened.â

Arthurâs words had precisely the opposite effect to that he had anticipated.
Adam thought he perceived in them that notion of compensation for irretrievable
wrong, that self-soothing attempt to make evil bear the same fruits as good,
which most of all roused his indignation. He was as strongly impelled to look
painful facts right in the face as Arthur was to turn away his eyes from them.
Moreover, he had the wakeful suspicious pride of a poor man in the presence of
a rich man. He felt his old severity returning as he said, âThe timeâs past for
that, sir. A man should make sacrifices to keep clear of doing a wrong;
sacrifices wonât undo it when itâs done. When peopleâs feelings have got a
deadly wound, they canât be cured with favours.â

âFavours!â said Arthur, passionately; âno; how can you suppose I meant that?
But the PoysersâMr. Irwine tells me the Poysers mean to leave the place where
they have lived so many yearsâfor generations. Donât you see, as Mr. Irwine
does, that if they could be persuaded to overcome the feeling that drives them
away, it would be much better for them in the end to remain on the old spot,
among the friends and neighbours who know them?â

âThatâs true,â said Adam coldly. âBut then, sir, folksâs feelings are not so
easily overcome. Itâll be hard for Martin Poyser to go to a strange place,
among strange faces, when heâs been bred up on the Hall Farm, and his father
before him; but then it âud be harder for a man with his feelings to stay. I
donât see how the thingâs to be made any other than hard. Thereâs a sort oâ
damage, sir, that canât be made up for.â

Arthur was silent some moments. In spite of other feelings dominant in him this
evening, his pride winced under Adamâs mode of treating him. Wasnât he himself
suffering? Was not he too obliged to renounce his most cherished hopes? It was
now as it had been eight months agoâAdam was forcing Arthur to feel more
intensely the irrevocableness of his own wrong-doing. He was presenting the
sort of resistance that was the most irritating to Arthurâs eager ardent
nature. But his anger was subdued by the same influence that had subdued Adamâs
when they first confronted each otherâby the marks of suffering in a long
familiar face. The momentary struggle ended in the feeling that he could bear a
great deal from Adam, to whom he had been the occasion of bearing so much; but
there was a touch of pleading, boyish vexation in his tone as he said, âBut
people may make injuries worse by unreasonable conductâby giving way to anger
and satisfying that for the moment, instead of thinking what will be the effect
in the future.

âIf I were going to stay here and act as landlord,â he added presently, with
still more eagernessââif I were careless about what Iâve doneâwhat Iâve been
the cause of, you would have some excuse, Adam, for going away and encouraging
others to go. You would have some excuse then for trying to make the evil
worse. But when I tell you Iâm going away for yearsâwhen you know what that
means for me, how it cuts off every plan of happiness Iâve ever formedâit is
impossible for a sensible man like you to believe that there is any real ground
for the Poysers refusing to remain. I know their feeling about disgraceâMr.
Irwine has told me all; but he is of opinion that they might be persuaded out
of this idea that they are disgraced in the eyes of their neighbours, and that
they canât remain on my estate, if you would join him in his effortsâif you
would stay yourself and go on managing the old woods.â

Arthur paused a moment and then added, pleadingly, âYou know thatâs a good work
to do for the sake of other people, besides the owner. And you donât know but
that they may have a better owner soon, whom you will like to work for. If I
die, my cousin Tradgett will have the estate and take my name. He is a good
fellow.â

Adam could not help being moved: it was impossible for him not to feel that
this was the voice of the honest warm-hearted Arthur whom he had loved and been
proud of in old days; but nearer memories would not be thrust away. He was
silent; yet Arthur saw an answer in his face that induced him to go on, with
growing earnestness.

âAnd then, if you would talk to the Poysersâif you would talk the matter over
with Mr. Irwineâhe means to see you to-morrowâand then if you would join your
arguments to his to prevail on them not to go.... I know, of course, that they
would not accept any favour from meâI mean nothing of that kindâbut Iâm sure
they would suffer less in the end. Irwine thinks so too. And Mr. Irwine is to
have the chief authority on the estateâhe has consented to undertake that. They
will really be under no man but one whom they respect and like. It would be the
same with you, Adam, and it could be nothing but a desire to give me worse pain
that could incline you to go.â

Arthur was silent again for a little while, and then said, with some agitation
in his voice, âI wouldnât act so towards you, I know. If you were in my place
and I in yours, I should try to help you to do the best.â

Adam made a hasty movement on his chair and looked on the ground. Arthur went
on, âPerhaps youâve never done anything youâve had bitterly to repent of in
your life, Adam; if you had, you would be more generous. You would know then
that itâs worse for me than for you.â

Arthur rose from his seat with the last words, and went to one of the windows,
looking out and turning his back on Adam, as he continued, passionately,

âHavenât
I
loved her too? Didnât I see her yesterday? Shanât I carry the
thought of her about with me as much as you will? And donât you think you would
suffer more if youâd been in fault?â

There was silence for several minutes, for the struggle in Adamâs mind was not
easily decided. Facile natures, whose emotions have little permanence, can
hardly understand how much inward resistance he overcame before he rose from
his seat and turned towards Arthur. Arthur heard the movement, and turning
round, met the sad but softened look with which Adam said,

âItâs true what you say, sir. Iâm hardâitâs in my nature. I was too hard with
my father, for doing wrong. Iâve been a bit hard tâ everybody but
her
. I
felt as if nobody pitied her enoughâher suffering cut into me so; and when I
thought the folks at the farm were too hard with her, I said Iâd never be hard
to anybody myself again. But feeling overmuch about her has perhaps made me
unfair to you. Iâve known what it is in my life to repent and feel itâs too
late. I felt Iâd been too harsh to my father when he was gone from meâI feel it
now, when I think of him. Iâve no right to be hard towards them as have done
wrong and repent.â

Adam spoke these words with the firm distinctness of a man who is resolved to
leave nothing unsaid that he is bound to say; but he went on with more
hesitation.

âI wouldnât shake hands with you once, sir, when you asked meâbut if youâre
willing to do it now, for all I refused then...â

Arthurâs white hand was in Adamâs large grasp in an instant, and with that
action there was a strong rush, on both sides, of the old, boyish affection.

âAdam,â Arthur said, impelled to full confession now, âit would never have
happened if Iâd known you loved her. That would have helped to save me from it.
And I
did
struggle: I never meant to injure her. I deceived you
afterwardsâand that led on to worse; but I thought it was forced upon me, I
thought it was the best thing I could do. And in that letter I told her to let
me know if she were in any trouble: donât think I would not have done
everything I could. But I was all wrong from the very first, and horrible wrong
has come of it. God knows, Iâd give my life if I could undo it.â

They sat down again opposite each other, and Adam said, tremulously, âHow did
she seem when you left her, sir?â

âDonât ask me, Adam,â Arthur said; âI feel sometimes as if I should go mad with
thinking of her looks and what she said to me, and then, that I couldnât get a
full pardonâthat I couldnât save her from that wretched fate of being
transportedâthat I can do nothing for her all those years; and she may die
under it, and never know comfort any more.â

âAh, sir,â said Adam, for the first time feeling his own pain merged in
sympathy for Arthur, âyou and meâll often be thinking oâ the same thing, when
weâre a long way off one another. Iâll pray God to help you, as I pray him to
help me.â

âBut thereâs that sweet womanâthat Dinah Morris,â Arthur said, pursuing his own
thoughts and not knowing what had been the sense of Adamâs words, âshe says she
shall stay with her to the very last momentâtill she goes; and the poor thing
clings to her as if she found some comfort in her. I could worship that woman;
I donât know what I should do if she were not there. Adam, you will see her
when she comes back. I could say nothing to her yesterdayânothing of what I
felt towards her. Tell her,â Arthur went on hurriedly, as if he wanted to hide
the emotion with which he spoke, while he took off his chain and watch, âtell
her I asked you to give her this in remembrance of meâof the man to whom she is
the one source of comfort, when he thinks of... I know she doesnât care about
such thingsâor anything else I can give her for its own sake. But she will use
the watchâI shall like to think of her using it.â

âIâll give it to her, sir,â Adam said, âand tell her your words. She told me
she should come back to the people at the Hall Farm.â

âAnd you
will
persuade the Poysers to stay, Adam?â said Arthur, reminded
of the subject which both of them had forgotten in the first interchange of
revived friendship. âYou
will
stay yourself, and help Mr. Irwine to
carry out the repairs and improvements on the estate?â

âThereâs one thing, sir, that perhaps you donât take account of,â said Adam,
with hesitating gentleness, âand that was what made me hang back longer. You
see, itâs the same with both me and the Poysers: if we stay, itâs for our own
worldly interest, and it looks as if weâd put up with anything for the sake oâ
that. I know thatâs what theyâll feel, and I canât help feeling a little of it
myself. When folks have got an honourable independent spirit, they donât like
to do anything that might make âem seem base-minded.â

âBut no one who knows you will think that, Adam. That is not a reason strong
enough against a course that is really more generous, more unselfish than the
other. And it will be knownâit shall be made known, that both you and the
Poysers stayed at my entreaty. Adam, donât try to make things worse for me; Iâm
punished enough without that.â

âNo, sir, no,â Adam said, looking at Arthur with mournful affection. âGod
forbid I should make things worse for you. I used to wish I could do it, in my
passionâbut that was when I thought you didnât feel enough. Iâll stay, sir,
Iâll do the best I can. Itâs all Iâve got to think of nowâto do my work well
and make the world a bit better place for them as can enjoy it.â

âThen weâll part now, Adam. You will see Mr. Irwine to-morrow, and consult with
him about everything.â

âAre you going soon, sir?â said Adam.

âAs soon as possibleâafter Iâve made the necessary arrangements. Good-bye,
Adam. I shall think of you going about the old place.â

âGood-bye, sir. God bless you.â

The hands were clasped once more, and Adam left the Hermitage, feeling that
sorrow was more bearable now hatred was gone.

As soon as the door was closed behind him, Arthur went to the waste-paper
basket and took out the little pink silk handkerchief.

Book Sixth

Chapter XLIX

At the Hall Farm

The first autumnal afternoon sunshine of 1801âmore than eighteen months after
that parting of Adam and Arthur in the Hermitageâwas on the yard at the Hall
Farm; and the bull-dog was in one of his most excited moments, for it was that
hour of the day when the cows were being driven into the yard for their
afternoon milking. No wonder the patient beasts ran confusedly into the wrong
places, for the alarming din of the bull-dog was mingled with more distant
sounds which the timid feminine creatures, with pardonable superstition,
imagined also to have some relation to their own movementsâwith the tremendous
crack of the waggonerâs whip, the roar of his voice, and the booming thunder of
the waggon, as it left the rick-yard empty of its golden load.

The milking of the cows was a sight Mrs. Poyser loved, and at this hour on mild
days she was usually standing at the house door, with her knitting in her
hands, in quiet contemplation, only heightened to a keener interest when the
vicious yellow cow, who had once kicked over a pailful of precious milk, was
about to undergo the preventive punishment of having her hinder-legs strapped.

To-day, however, Mrs. Poyser gave but a divided attention to the arrival of the
cows, for she was in eager discussion with Dinah, who was stitching Mr.
Poyserâs shirt-collars, and had borne patiently to have her thread broken three
times by Totty pulling at her arm with a sudden insistence that she should look
at âBaby,â that is, at a large wooden doll with no legs and a long skirt, whose
bald head Totty, seated in her small chair at Dinahâs side, was caressing and
pressing to her fat cheek with much fervour. Totty is larger by more than two
yearsâ growth than when you first saw her, and she has on a black frock under
her pinafore. Mrs. Poyser too has on a black gown, which seems to heighten the
family likeness between her and Dinah. In other respects there is little
outward change now discernible in our old friends, or in the pleasant
house-place, bright with polished oak and pewter.

âI never saw the like to you, Dinah,â Mrs. Poyser was saying, âwhen youâve once
took anything into your head: thereâs no more moving you than the rooted tree.
You may say what you like, but I donât believe
thatâs
religion; for
whatâs the Sermon on the Mount about, as youâre so fond oâ reading to the boys,
but doing what other folks âud have you do? But if it was anything unreasonable
they wanted you to do, like taking your cloak off and giving it to âem, or
letting âem slap you iâ the face, I daresay youâd be ready enough. Itâs only
when one âud have you do whatâs plain common sense and good for yourself, as
youâre obstinate thâ other way.â

âNay, dear Aunt,â said Dinah, smiling slightly as she went on with her work,
âIâm sure your wish âud be a reason for me to do anything that I didnât feel it
was wrong to do.â

âWrong! You drive me past bearing. What is there wrong, I should like to know,
iâ staying along wiâ your own friends, as are thâ happier for having you with
âem anâ are willing to provide for you, even if your work didnât more nor pay
âem for the bit oâ sparrowâs victual yâ eat and the bit oâ rag you put on? Anâ
who is it, I should like to know, as youâre bound tâ help and comfort iâ the
world more nor your own flesh and bloodâanâ me thâ only aunt youâve got
above-ground, anâ am brought to the brink oâ the grave welly every winter as
comes, anâ thereâs the child as sits beside you âull break her little heart
when you go, anâ the grandfather not been dead a twelvemonth, anâ your uncle
âull miss you so as never wasâa-lighting his pipe anâ waiting on him, anâ now I
can trust you wiâ the butter, anâ have had all the trouble oâ teaching you, and
thereâs all the sewing to be done, anâ I must have a strange gell out oâ
Treddlesâon to do itâanâ all because you must go back to that bare heap oâ
stones as the very crows fly over anâ wonât stop at.â

âDear Aunt Rachel,â said Dinah, looking up in Mrs. Poyserâs face, âitâs your
kindness makes you say Iâm useful to you. You donât really want me now, for
Nancy and Molly are clever at their work, and youâre in good health now, by the
blessing of God, and my uncle is of a cheerful countenance again, and you have
neighbours and friends not a fewâsome of them come to sit with my uncle almost
daily. Indeed, you will not miss me; and at Snowfield there are brethren and
sisters in great need, who have none of those comforts you have around you. I
feel that I am called back to those amongst whom my lot was first cast. I feel
drawn again towards the hills where I used to be blessed in carrying the word
of life to the sinful and desolate.â

âYou feel! Yes,â said Mrs. Poyser, returning from a parenthetic glance at the
cows, âthatâs allays the reason Iâm to sit down wiâ, when youâve a mind to do
anything contrairy. What do you want to be preaching for more than youâre
preaching now? Donât you go off, the Lord knows where, every Sunday a-preaching
and praying? Anâ havenât you got Methodists enow at Treddlesâon to go and look
at, if church-folksâs faces are too handsome to please you? Anâ isnât there
them iâ this parish as youâve got under hand, and theyâre like enough to make
friends wiâ Old Harry again as soon as your backâs turned? Thereâs that Bessy
Cranageâsheâll be flaunting iâ new finery three weeks after youâre gone, Iâll
be bound. Sheâll no more go on in her new ways without you than a dog âull
stand on its hind-legs when thereâs nobody looking. But I suppose it doesna
matter so much about folksâs souls iâ this country, else youâd be for staying
with your own aunt, for sheâs none so good but what you might help her to be
better.â

There was a certain something in Mrs. Poyserâs voice just then, which she did
not wish to be noticed, so she turned round hastily to look at the clock, and
said: âSee there! Itâs tea-time; anâ if Martinâs iâ the rick-yard, heâll like a
cup. Here, Totty, my chicken, let mother put your bonnet on, and then you go
out into the rick-yard and see if Fatherâs there, and tell him he mustnât go
away again without coming tâ have a cup oâ tea; and tell your brothers to come
in too.â

Totty trotted off in her flapping bonnet, while Mrs. Poyser set out the bright
oak table and reached down the tea-cups.

âYou talk oâ them gells Nancy and Molly being clever iâ their work,â she began
again; âitâs fine talking. Theyâre all the same, clever or stupidâone canât
trust âem out oâ oneâs sight a minute. They want somebodyâs eye on âem constant
if theyâre to be kept to their work. Anâ suppose Iâm ill again this winter, as
I was the winter before last? Whoâs to look after âem then, if youâre gone? Anâ
thereâs that blessed childâsomethingâs sure tâ happen to herâtheyâll let her
tumble into the fire, or get at the kettle wiâ the boiling lard inât, or some
mischief as âull lame her for life; anâ itâll be all your fault, Dinah.â

âAunt,â said Dinah, âI promise to come back to you in the winter if youâre ill.
Donât think I will ever stay away from you if youâre in real want of me. But,
indeed, it is needful for my own soul that I should go away from this life of
ease and luxury in which I have all things too richly to enjoyâat least that I
should go away for a short space. No one can know but myself what are my inward
needs, and the besetments I am most in danger from. Your wish for me to stay is
not a call of duty which I refuse to hearken to because it is against my own
desires; it is a temptation that I must resist, lest the love of the creature
should become like a mist in my soul shutting out the heavenly light.â

âIt passes my cunning to know what you mean by ease and luxury,â said Mrs.
Poyser, as she cut the bread and butter. âItâs true thereâs good victual enough
about you, as nobody shall ever say I donât provide enough and to spare, but if
thereâs ever a bit oâ odds anâ ends as nobody else âud eat, youâre sure to pick
it out... but look there! Thereâs Adam Bede a-carrying the little un in. I
wonder how it is heâs come so early.â

Mrs. Poyser hastened to the door for the pleasure of looking at her darling in
a new position, with love in her eyes but reproof on her tongue.

âOh for shame, Totty! Little gells oâ five year old should be ashamed to be
carried. Why, Adam, sheâll break your arm, such a big gell as that; set her
downâfor shame!â

âNay, nay,â said Adam, âI can lift her with my handâIâve no need to take my arm
to it.â

Totty, looking as serenely unconscious of remark as a fat white puppy, was set
down at the door-place, and the mother enforced her reproof with a shower of
kisses.

âYouâre surprised to see me at this hour oâ the day,â said Adam.

âYes, but come in,â said Mrs. Poyser, making way for him; âthereâs no bad news,
I hope?â

âNo, nothing bad,â Adam answered, as he went up to Dinah and put out his hand
to her. She had laid down her work and stood up, instinctively, as he
approached her. A faint blush died away from her pale cheek as she put her hand
in his and looked up at him timidly.

âItâs an errand to you brought me, Dinah,â said Adam, apparently unconscious
that he was holding her hand all the while; âmotherâs a bit ailing, and sheâs
set her heart on your coming to stay the night with her, if youâll be so kind.
I told her Iâd call and ask you as I came from the village. She overworks
herself, and I canât persuade her to have a little girl tâ help her. I donât
know whatâs to be done.â

Adam released Dinahâs hand as he ceased speaking, and was expecting an answer,
but before she had opened her lips Mrs. Poyser said, âLook there now! I told
you there was folks enow tâ help iâ this parish, wiâout going further off.
Thereâs Mrs. Bede getting as old and casâalty as can be, and she wonât let
anybody but you go a-nigh her hardly. The folks at Snowfield have learnt by
this time to do better wiâout you nor she can.â

âIâll put my bonnet on and set off directly, if you donât want anything done
first, Aunt,â said Dinah, folding up her work.

âYes, I do want something done. I want you tâ have your tea, child; itâs all
readyâand youâll have a cup, Adam, if yâ arena in too big a hurry.â

âYes, Iâll have a cup, please; and then Iâll walk with Dinah. Iâm going
straight home, for Iâve got a lot oâ timber valuations to write out.â

âWhy, Adam, lad, are you here?â said Mr. Poyser, entering warm and coatless,
with the two black-eyed boys behind him, still looking as much like him as two
small elephants are like a large one. âHow is it weâve got sight oâ you so long
before foddering-time?â

âI came on an errand for Mother,â said Adam. âSheâs got a touch of her old
complaint, and she wants Dinah to go and stay with her a bit.â

âWell, weâll spare her for your mother a little while,â said Mr. Poyser. âBut
we wonna spare her for anybody else, onây her husband.â

âHusband!â said Marty, who was at the most prosaic and literal period of the
boyish mind. âWhy, Dinah hasnât got a husband.â

âSpare her?â said Mrs. Poyser, placing a seed-cake on the table and then
seating herself to pour out the tea. âBut we must spare her, it seems, and not
for a husband neither, but for her own megrims. Tommy, what are you doing to
your little sisterâs doll? Making the child naughty, when sheâd be good if
youâd let her. You shanna have a morsel oâ cake if you behave so.â

Tommy, with true brotherly sympathy, was amusing himself by turning Dollyâs
skirt over her bald head and exhibiting her truncated body to the general
scornâan indignity which cut Totty to the heart.

âWhat do you think Dinahâs been a-telling me since dinner-time?â Mrs. Poyser
continued, looking at her husband.

âEh! Iâm a poor un at guessing,â said Mr. Poyser.

âWhy, she means to go back to Snowfield again, and work iâ the mill, and starve
herself, as she used to do, like a creatur as has got no friends.â

Mr. Poyser did not readily find words to express his unpleasant astonishment;
he only looked from his wife to Dinah, who had now seated herself beside Totty,
as a bulwark against brotherly playfulness, and was busying herself with the
childrenâs tea. If he had been given to making general reflections, it would
have occurred to him that there was certainly a change come over Dinah, for she
never used to change colour; but, as it was, he merely observed that her face
was flushed at that moment. Mr. Poyser thought she looked the prettier for it:
it was a flush no deeper than the petal of a monthly rose. Perhaps it came
because her uncle was looking at her so fixedly; but there is no knowing, for
just then Adam was saying, with quiet surprise, âWhy, I hoped Dinah was settled
among us for life. I thought sheâd given up the notion oâ going back to her old
country.â

âThought! Yes,â said Mrs. Poyser, âand so would anybody else haâ thought, as
had got their right end upâards. But I suppose you must
be
a Methodist
to know what a Methodist âull do. Itâs ill guessing what the bats are flying
after.â

âWhy, what have we done to you, Dinah, as you must go away from us?â said Mr.
Poyser, still pausing over his tea-cup. âItâs like breaking your word, welly,
for your aunt never had no thought but youâd make this your home.â

âNay, Uncle,â said Dinah, trying to be quite calm. âWhen I first came, I said
it was only for a time, as long as I could be of any comfort to my aunt.â

âWell, anâ who said youâd ever left off being a comfort to me?â said Mrs.
Poyser. âIf you didna mean to stay wiâ me, youâd better never haâ come. Them as
haâ never had a cushion donât miss it.â

âNay, nay,â said Mr. Poyser, who objected to exaggerated views. âThee mustna
say so; we should haâ been ill off wiâout her, Lady day was a twelvemontâ. We
mun be thankful for that, whether she stays or no. But I canna think what she
mun leave a good home for, to go back intâ a country where the land, most onât,
isna worth ten shillings an acre, rent and profits.â

âWhy, thatâs just the reason she wants to go, as fur as she can give a reason,â
said Mrs. Poyser. âShe says this countryâs too comfortable, anâ thereâs too
much tâ eat, anâ folks arena miserable enough. And sheâs going next week. I
canna turn her, say what I will. Itâs allays the way wiâ them meek-faced
people; you mayâs well pelt a bag oâ feathers as talk to âem. But I say it isna
religion, to be so obstinateâis it now, Adam?â

Adam saw that Dinah was more disturbed than he had ever seen her by any matter
relating to herself, and, anxious to relieve her, if possible, he said, looking
at her affectionately, âNay, I canât find fault with anything Dinah does. I
believe her thoughts are better than our guesses, let âem be what they may. I
should haâ been thankful for her to stay among us, but if she thinks well to
go, I wouldnât cross her, or make it hard to her by objecting. We owe her
something different to that.â

As it often happens, the words intended to relieve her were just too much for
Dinahâs susceptible feelings at this moment. The tears came into the grey eyes
too fast to be hidden and she got up hurriedly, meaning it to be understood
that she was going to put on her bonnet.

âMother, whatâs Dinah crying for?â said Totty. âShe isnât a naughty dell.â

âTheeâst gone a bit too fur,â said Mr. Poyser. âWeâve no right tâ interfere
with her doing as she likes. Anâ theeâdst be as angry as could be wiâ me, if I
said a word against anything she did.â

âBecause youâd very like be finding fault wiâout reason,â said Mrs. Poyser.
âBut thereâs reason iâ what I say, else I shouldna say it. Itâs easy talking
for them as canât love her so well as her own aunt does. Anâ me got so used to
her! I shall feel as uneasy as a new sheared sheep when sheâs gone from me. Anâ
to think of her leaving a parish where sheâs so looked on. Thereâs Mr. Irwine
makes as much of her as if she was a lady, for all her being a Methodist, anâ
wiâ that maggot oâ preaching in her headâGod forgiâe me if Iâm iâ the wrong to
call it so.â

âAye,â said Mr. Poyser, looking jocose; âbut thee dostna tell Adam what he said
to thee about it one day. The missis was saying, Adam, as the preaching was the
only fault to be found wiâ Dinah, and Mr. Irwine says, âBut you mustnât find
fault with her for that, Mrs. Poyser; you forget sheâs got no husband to preach
to. Iâll answer for it, you give Poyser many a good sermon.â The parson had
thee there,â Mr. Poyser added, laughing unctuously. âI told Bartle Massey on
it, anâ he laughed too.â

âYes, itâs a small joke sets men laughing when they sit a-staring at one
another with a pipe iâ their mouths,â said Mrs. Poyser. âGive Bartle Massey his
way and heâd have all the sharpness to himself. If the chaff-cutter had the
making of us, we should all be straw, I reckon. Totty, my chicken, go upstairs
to cousin Dinah, and see what sheâs doing, and give her a pretty kiss.â

This errand was devised for Totty as a means of checking certain threatening
symptoms about the corners of the mouth; for Tommy, no longer expectant of
cake, was lifting up his eyelids with his forefingers and turning his eyeballs
towards Totty in a way that she felt to be disagreeably personal.

âYouâre rare and busy nowâeh, Adam?â said Mr. Poyser. âBurgeâs getting so bad
wiâ his asthmy, itâs well if heâll ever do much riding about again.â

âYes, weâve got a pretty bit oâ building on hand now,â said Adam, âwhat with
the repairs on thâ estate, and the new houses at Treddlesâon.â

âIâll bet a penny that new house Burge is building on his own bit oâ land is
for him and Mary to go to,â said Mr. Poyser. âHeâll be for laying by business
soon, Iâll warrant, and be wanting you to take to it all and pay him so much by
thâ âear. We shall see you living on thâ hill before another twelvemontâs
over.â

âWell,â said Adam, âI should like tâ have the business in my own hands. It
isnât as I mind much about getting any more money. Weâve enough and to spare
now, with only our two selves and mother; but I should like tâ have my own way
about thingsâI could try plans then, as I canât do now.â

âYou get on pretty well wiâ the new steward, I reckon?â said Mr. Poyser.

âYes, yes; heâs a sensible man enough; understands farmingâheâs carrying on the
draining, and all that, capital. You must go some day towards the Stonyshire
side and see what alterations theyâre making. But heâs got no notion about
buildings. You can so seldom get hold of a man as can turn his brains to more
nor one thing; itâs just as if they wore blinkers like thâ horses and could see
nothing oâ one side of âem. Now, thereâs Mr. Irwine has got notions oâ building
more nor most architects; for as for thâ architects, they set up to be fine
fellows, but the most of âem donât know where to set a chimney so as it shanât
be quarrelling with a door. My notion is, a practical builder thatâs got a bit
oâ taste makes the best architect for common things; and Iâve ten times the
pleasure iâ seeing after the work when Iâve made the plan myself.â

Mr. Poyser listened with an admiring interest to Adamâs discourse on building,
but perhaps it suggested to him that the building of his corn-rick had been
proceeding a little too long without the control of the masterâs eye, for when
Adam had done speaking, he got up and said, âWell, lad, Iâll bid you good-bye
now, for Iâm off to the rick-yard again.â

Adam rose too, for he saw Dinah entering, with her bonnet on and a little
basket in her hand, preceded by Totty.

âYouâre ready, I see, Dinah,â Adam said; âso weâll set off, for the sooner Iâm
at home the better.â

âMother,â said Totty, with her treble pipe, âDinah was saying her prayers and
crying ever so.â

âHush, hush,â said the mother, âlittle gells mustnât chatter.â

Whereupon the father, shaking with silent laughter, set Totty on the white deal
table and desired her to kiss him. Mr. and Mrs. Poyser, you perceive, had no
correct principles of education.

âCome back to-morrow if Mrs. Bede doesnât want you, Dinah,â said Mrs. Poyser:
âbut you can stay, you know, if sheâs ill.â

So, when the good-byes had been said, Dinah and Adam left the Hall Farm
together.

Chapter L

In the Cottage

Adam did not ask Dinah to take his arm when they got out into the lane. He had
never yet done so, often as they had walked together, for he had observed that
she never walked arm-in-arm with Seth, and he thought, perhaps, that kind of
support was not agreeable to her. So they walked apart, though side by side,
and the close poke of her little black bonnet hid her face from him.

âYou canât be happy, then, to make the Hall Farm your home, Dinah?â Adam said,
with the quiet interest of a brother, who has no anxiety for himself in the
matter. âItâs a pity, seeing theyâre so fond of you.â

âYou know, Adam, my heart is as their heart, so far as love for them and care
for their welfare goes, but they are in no present need. Their sorrows are
healed, and I feel that I am called back to my old work, in which I found a
blessing that I have missed of late in the midst of too abundant worldly good.
I know it is a vain thought to flee from the work that God appoints us, for the
sake of finding a greater blessing to our own souls, as if we could choose for
ourselves where we shall find the fulness of the Divine Presence, instead of
seeking it where alone it is to be found, in loving obedience. But now, I
believe, I have a clear showing that my work lies elsewhereâat least for a
time. In the years to come, if my auntâs health should fail, or she should
otherwise need me, I shall return.â

âYou know best, Dinah,â said Adam. âI donât believe youâd go against the wishes
of them that love you, and are akin to you, without a good and sufficient
reason in your own conscience. Iâve no right to say anything about my being
sorry: you know well enough what cause I have to put you above every other
friend Iâve got; and if it had been ordered so that you could haâ been my
sister, and lived with us all our lives, I should haâ counted it the greatest
blessing as could happen to us now. But Seth tells me thereâs no hope oâ that:
your feelings are different, and perhaps Iâm taking too much upon me to speak
about it.â

Dinah made no answer, and they walked on in silence for some yards, till they
came to the stone stile, where, as Adam had passed through first and turned
round to give her his hand while she mounted the unusually high step, she could
not prevent him from seeing her face. It struck him with surprise, for the grey
eyes, usually so mild and grave, had the bright uneasy glance which accompanies
suppressed agitation, and the slight flush in her cheeks, with which she had
come downstairs, was heightened to a deep rose-colour. She looked as if she
were only sister to Dinah. Adam was silent with surprise and conjecture for
some moments, and then he said, âI hope Iâve not hurt or displeased you by what
Iâve said, Dinah. Perhaps I was making too free. Iâve no wish different from
what you see to be best, and Iâm satisfied for you to live thirty mile off, if
you think it right. I shall think of you just as much as I do now, for youâre
bound up with what I can no more help remembering than I can help my heart
beating.â

Poor Adam! Thus do men blunder. Dinah made no answer, but she presently said,
âHave you heard any news from that poor young man, since we last spoke of him?â

Dinah always called Arthur so; she had never lost the image of him as she had
seen him in the prison.

âYes,â said Adam. âMr. Irwine read me part of a letter from him yesterday. Itâs
pretty certain, they say, that thereâll be a peace soon, though nobody believes
itâll last long; but he says he doesnât mean to come home. Heâs no heart for it
yet, and itâs better for others that he should keep away. Mr. Irwine thinks
heâs in the right not to come. Itâs a sorrowful letter. He asks about you and
the Poysers, as he always does. Thereâs one thing in the letter cut me a good
deal: âYou canât think what an old fellow I feel,â he says; âI make no schemes
now. Iâm the best when Iâve a good dayâs march or fighting before me.ââ

âHeâs of a rash, warm-hearted nature, like Esau, for whom I have always felt
great pity,â said Dinah. âThat meeting between the brothers, where Esau is so
loving and generous, and Jacob so timid and distrustful, notwithstanding his
sense of the Divine favour, has always touched me greatly. Truly, I have been
tempted sometimes to say that Jacob was of a mean spirit. But that is our
trial: we must learn to see the good in the midst of much that is unlovely.â

âAh,â said Adam, âI like to read about Moses best, in thâ Old Testament. He
carried a hard business well through, and died when other folks were going to
reap the fruits. A man must have courage to look at his life so, and think
whatâll come of it after heâs dead and gone. A good solid bit oâ work lasts: if
itâs only laying a floor down, somebodyâs the better for it being done well,
besides the man as does it.â

They were both glad to talk of subjects that were not personal, and in this way
they went on till they passed the bridge across the Willow Brook, when Adam
turned round and said, âAh, hereâs Seth. I thought heâd be home soon. Does he
know of youâre going, Dinah?â

âYes, I told him last Sabbath.â

Adam remembered now that Seth had come home much depressed on Sunday evening, a
circumstance which had been very unusual with him of late, for the happiness he
had in seeing Dinah every week seemed long to have outweighed the pain of
knowing she would never marry him. This evening he had his habitual air of
dreamy benignant contentment, until he came quite close to Dinah and saw the
traces of tears on her delicate eyelids and eyelashes. He gave one rapid glance
at his brother, but Adam was evidently quite outside the current of emotion
that had shaken Dinah: he wore his everyday look of unexpectant calm. Seth
tried not to let Dinah see that he had noticed her face, and only said, âIâm
thankful youâre come, Dinah, for Motherâs been hungering after the sight of you
all day. She began to talk of you the first thing in the morning.â

When they entered the cottage, Lisbeth was seated in her arm-chair, too tired
with setting out the evening meal, a task she always performed a long time
beforehand, to go and meet them at the door as usual, when she heard the
approaching footsteps.

âCoom, child, theeât coom at last,â she said, when Dinah went towards her.
âWhat dost mane by lavinâ me a week anâ neâer coominâ a-nigh me?â

âDear friend,â said Dinah, taking her hand, âyouâre not well. If Iâd known it
sooner, Iâd have come.â

âAnâ howâs thee tâ know if thee dostna coom? Thâ lads onây know what I tell
âem. As long as ye can stir hand and foot the men think yeâre hearty. But Iâm
none so bad, onây a bit of a cold sets me achinâ. Anâ thâ lads tease me so tâ
haâ somebody wiâ me tâ do the workâthey make me ache worse wiâ talkinâ. If
theeâdst come and stay wiâ me, theyâd let me alone. The Poysers canna want thee
so bad as I do. But take thy bonnet off, anâ let me look at thee.â

Dinah was moving away, but Lisbeth held her fast, while she was taking off her
bonnet, and looked at her face as one looks into a newly gathered snowdrop, to
renew the old impressions of purity and gentleness.

âWhatâs the matter wiâ thee?â said Lisbeth, in astonishment; âtheeâst been
a-cryinâ.â

âItâs only a grief thatâll pass away,â said Dinah, who did not wish just now to
call forth Lisbethâs remonstrances by disclosing her intention to leave
Hayslope. âYou shall know about it shortlyâweâll talk of it to-night. I shall
stay with you to-night.â

Lisbeth was pacified by this prospect. And she had the whole evening to talk
with Dinah alone; for there was a new room in the cottage, you remember, built
nearly two years ago, in the expectation of a new inmate; and here Adam always
sat when he had writing to do or plans to make. Seth sat there too this
evening, for he knew his mother would like to have Dinah all to herself.

There were two pretty pictures on the two sides of the wall in the cottage. On
one side there was the broad-shouldered, large-featured, hardy old woman, in
her blue jacket and buff kerchief, with her dim-eyed anxious looks turned
continually on the lily face and the slight form in the black dress that were
either moving lightly about in helpful activity, or seated close by the old
womanâs arm-chair, holding her withered hand, with eyes lifted up towards her
to speak a language which Lisbeth understood far better than the Bible or the
hymn-book. She would scarcely listen to reading at all to-night. âNay, nay,
shut the book,â she said. âWe mun talk. I want tâ know what thee was cryinâ
about. Hast got troubles oâ thy own, like other folks?â

On the other side of the wall there were the two brothers so like each other in
the midst of their unlikeness: Adam with knit brows, shaggy hair, and dark
vigorous colour, absorbed in his âfiguringâ; Seth, with large rugged features,
the close copy of his brotherâs, but with thin, wavy, brown hair and blue
dreamy eyes, as often as not looking vaguely out of the window instead of at
his book, although it was a newly bought bookâWesleyâs abridgment of Madame
Guyonâs life, which was full of wonder and interest for him. Seth had said to
Adam, âCan I help thee with anything in here to-night? I donât want to make a
noise in the shop.â

âNo, lad,â Adam answered, âthereâs nothing but what I must do myself. Theeâst
got thy new book to read.â

And often, when Seth was quite unconscious, Adam, as he paused after drawing a
line with his ruler, looked at his brother with a kind smile dawning in his
eyes. He knew âthâ lad liked to sit full oâ thoughts he could give no account
of; theyâd never come tâ anything, but they made him happy,â and in the last
year or so, Adam had been getting more and more indulgent to Seth. It was part
of that growing tenderness which came from the sorrow at work within him.

For Adam, though you see him quite master of himself, working hard and
delighting in his work after his inborn inalienable nature, had not outlived
his sorrowâhad not felt it slip from him as a temporary burden, and leave him
the same man again. Do any of us? God forbid. It would be a poor result of all
our anguish and our wrestling if we won nothing but our old selves at the end
of itâif we could return to the same blind loves, the same self-confident
blame, the same light thoughts of human suffering, the same frivolous gossip
over blighted human lives, the same feeble sense of that Unknown towards which
we have sent forth irrepressible cries in our loneliness. Let us rather be
thankful that our sorrow lives in us as an indestructible force, only changing
its form, as forces do, and passing from pain into sympathyâthe one poor word
which includes all our best insight and our best love. Not that this
transformation of pain into sympathy had completely taken place in Adam yet.
There was still a great remnant of pain, and this he felt would subsist as long
as
her
pain was not a memory, but an existing thing, which he must think
of as renewed with the light of every new morning. But we get accustomed to
mental as well as bodily pain, without, for all that, losing our sensibility to
it. It becomes a habit of our lives, and we cease to imagine a condition of
perfect ease as possible for us. Desire is chastened into submission, and we
are contented with our day when we have been able to bear our grief in silence
and act as if we were not suffering. For it is at such periods that the sense
of our lives having visible and invisible relations, beyond any of which either
our present or prospective self is the centre, grows like a muscle that we are
obliged to lean on and exert.

That was Adamâs state of mind in this second autumn of his sorrow. His work, as
you know, had always been part of his religion, and from very early days he saw
clearly that good carpentry was Godâs willâwas that form of Godâs will that
most immediately concerned him. But now there was no margin of dreams for him
beyond this daylight reality, no holiday-time in the working-day world, no
moment in the distance when duty would take off her iron glove and breast-plate
and clasp him gently into rest. He conceived no picture of the future but one
made up of hard-working days such as he lived through, with growing contentment
and intensity of interest, every fresh week. Love, he thought, could never be
anything to him but a living memoryâa limb lopped off, but not gone from
consciousness. He did not know that the power of loving was all the while
gaining new force within him; that the new sensibilities bought by a deep
experience were so many new fibres by which it was possible, nay, necessary to
him, that his nature should intertwine with another. Yet he was aware that
common affection and friendship were more precious to him than they used to
beâthat he clung more to his mother and Seth, and had an unspeakable
satisfaction in the sight or imagination of any small addition to their
happiness. The Poysers, tooâhardly three or four days passed but he felt the
need of seeing them and interchanging words and looks of friendliness with
them. He would have felt this, probably, even if Dinah had not been with them,
but he had only said the simplest truth in telling Dinah that he put her above
all other friends in the world. Could anything be more natural? For in the
darkest moments of memory the thought of her always came as the first ray of
returning comfort. The early days of gloom at the Hall Farm had been gradually
turned into soft moonlight by her presence; and in the cottage, too, for she
had come at every spare moment to soothe and cheer poor Lisbeth, who had been
stricken with a fear that subdued even her querulousness at the sight of her
darling Adamâs grief-worn face. He had become used to watching her light quiet
movements, her pretty loving ways to the children, when he went to the Hall
Farm; to listen for her voice as for a recurrent music; to think everything she
said and did was just right, and could not have been better. In spite of his
wisdom, he could not find fault with her for her overindulgence of the
children, who had managed to convert Dinah the preacher, before whom a circle
of rough men had often trembled a little, into a convenient household
slaveâthough Dinah herself was rather ashamed of this weakness, and had some
inward conflict as to her departure from the precepts of Solomon. Yes, there
was one thing that might have been better; she might have loved Seth and
consented to marry him. He felt a little vexed, for his brotherâs sake, and he
could not help thinking regretfully how Dinah, as Sethâs wife, would have made
their home as happy as it could be for them allâhow she was the one being that
would have soothed their motherâs last days into peacefulness and rest.

âItâs wonderful she doesnât love thâ lad,â Adam had said sometimes to himself,
âfor anybody âud think he was just cut out for her. But her heartâs so taken up
with other things. Sheâs one oâ those women that feel no drawing towards having
a husband and children oâ their own. She thinks she should be filled up with
her own life then, and sheâs been used so to living in other folksâs cares, she
canât bear the thought of her heart being shut up from âem. I see how it is,
well enough. Sheâs cut out oâ different stuff from most women: I saw that long
ago. Sheâs never easy but when sheâs helping somebody, and marriage âud
interfere with her waysâthatâs true. Iâve no right to be contriving and
thinking it âud be better if sheâd have Seth, as if I was wiser than she isâor
than God either, for He made her what she is, and thatâs one oâ the greatest
blessings Iâve ever had from His hands, and others besides me.â

This self-reproof had recurred strongly to Adamâs mind when he gathered from
Dinahâs face that he had wounded her by referring to his wish that she had
accepted Seth, and so he had endeavoured to put into the strongest words his
confidence in her decision as rightâhis resignation even to her going away from
them and ceasing to make part of their life otherwise than by living in their
thoughts, if that separation were chosen by herself. He felt sure she knew
quite well enough how much he cared to see her continuallyâto talk to her with
the silent consciousness of a mutual great remembrance. It was not possible she
should hear anything but self-renouncing affection and respect in his assurance
that he was contented for her to go away; and yet there remained an uneasy
feeling in his mind that he had not said quite the right thingâthat, somehow,
Dinah had not understood him.

Dinah must have risen a little before the sun the next morning, for she was
downstairs about five oâclock. So was Seth, for, through Lisbethâs obstinate
refusal to have any woman-helper in the house, he had learned to make himself,
as Adam said, âvery handy in the housework,â that he might save his mother from
too great weariness; on which ground I hope you will not think him unmanly, any
more than you can have thought the gallant Colonel Bath unmanly when he made
the gruel for his invalid sister. Adam, who had sat up late at his writing, was
still asleep, and was not likely, Seth said, to be down till breakfast-time.
Often as Dinah had visited Lisbeth during the last eighteen months, she had
never slept in the cottage since that night after Thiasâs death, when, you
remember, Lisbeth praised her deft movements and even gave a modified approval
to her porridge. But in that long interval Dinah had made great advances in
household cleverness, and this morning, since Seth was there to help, she was
bent on bringing everything to a pitch of cleanliness and order that would have
satisfied her Aunt Poyser. The cottage was far from that standard at present,
for Lisbethâs rheumatism had forced her to give up her old habits of dilettante
scouring and polishing. When the kitchen was to her mind, Dinah went into the
new room, where Adam had been writing the night before, to see what sweeping
and dusting were needed there. She opened the window and let in the fresh
morning air, and the smell of the sweet-brier, and the bright low-slanting rays
of the early sun, which made a glory about her pale face and pale auburn hair
as she held the long brush, and swept, singing to herself in a very low
toneâlike a sweet summer murmur that you have to listen for very closelyâone of
Charles Wesleyâs hymns:

Eternal Beam of Light Divine,

Â Â Â Â Fountain of unexhausted love,

In whom the Fatherâs glories shine,

Â Â Â Â Through earth beneath and heaven above;

Jesus! the weary wandererâs rest,

Â Â Â Â Give me thy easy yoke to bear;

With steadfast patience arm my breast,

Â Â Â Â With spotless love and holy fear.

Speak to my warring passions, âPeace!â

Â Â Â Â Say to my trembling heart, âBe still!â

Thy power my strength and fortress is,

Â Â Â Â For all things serve thy sovereign will.

She laid by the brush and took up the duster; and if you had ever lived in Mrs.
Poyserâs household, you would know how the duster behaved in Dinahâs handâhow
it went into every small corner, and on every ledge in and out of sightâhow it
went again and again round every bar of the chairs, and every leg, and under
and over everything that lay on the table, till it came to Adamâs papers and
rulers and the open desk near them. Dinah dusted up to the very edge of these
and then hesitated, looking at them with a longing but timid eye. It was
painful to see how much dust there was among them. As she was looking in this
way, she heard Sethâs step just outside the open door, towards which her back
was turned, and said, raising her clear treble, âSeth, is your brother wrathful
when his papers are stirred?â

âYes, very, when they are not put back in the right places,â said a deep strong
voice, not Sethâs.

It was as if Dinah had put her hands unawares on a vibrating chord. She was
shaken with an intense thrill, and for the instant felt nothing else; then she
knew her cheeks were glowing, and dared not look round, but stood still,
distressed because she could not say good-morning in a friendly way. Adam,
finding that she did not look round so as to see the smile on his face, was
afraid she had thought him serious about his wrathfulness, and went up to her,
so that she was obliged to look at him.

âWhat! You think Iâm a cross fellow at home, Dinah?â he said, smilingly.

âNay,â said Dinah, looking up with timid eyes, ânot so. But you might be put
about by finding things meddled with; and even the man Moses, the meekest of
men, was wrathful sometimes.â

âCome, then,â said Adam, looking at her affectionately, âIâll help you move the
things, and put âem back again, and then they canât get wrong. Youâre getting
to be your auntâs own niece, I see, for particularness.â

They began their little task together, but Dinah had not recovered herself
sufficiently to think of any remark, and Adam looked at her uneasily. Dinah, he
thought, had seemed to disapprove him somehow lately; she had not been so kind
and open to him as she used to be. He wanted her to look at him, and be as
pleased as he was himself with doing this bit of playful work. But Dinah did
not look at himâit was easy for her to avoid looking at the tall manâand when
at last there was no more dusting to be done and no further excuse for him to
linger near her, he could bear it no longer, and said, in rather a pleading
tone, âDinah, youâre not displeased with me for anything, are you? Iâve not
said or done anything to make you think ill of me?â

The question surprised her, and relieved her by giving a new course to her
feeling. She looked up at him now, quite earnestly, almost with the tears
coming, and said, âOh, no, Adam! how could you think so?â

âI couldnât bear you not to feel as much a friend to me as I do to you,â said
Adam. âAnd you donât know the value I set on the very thought of you, Dinah.
That was what I meant yesterday, when I said Iâd be content for you to go, if
you thought right. I meant, the thought of you was worth so much to me, I
should feel I ought to be thankful, and not grumble, if you see right to go
away. You know I do mind parting with you, Dinah?â

âYes, dear friend,â said Dinah, trembling, but trying to speak calmly, âI know
you have a brotherâs heart towards me, and we shall often be with one another
in spirit; but at this season I am in heaviness through manifold temptations.
You must not mark me. I feel called to leave my kindred for a while; but it is
a trialâthe flesh is weak.â

Adam saw that it pained her to be obliged to answer.

âI hurt you by talking about it, Dinah,â he said. âIâll say no more. Letâs see
if Sethâs ready with breakfast now.â

That is a simple scene, reader. But it is almost certain that you, too, have
been in loveâperhaps, even, more than once, though you may not choose to say so
to all your feminine friends. If so, you will no more think the slight words,
the timid looks, the tremulous touches, by which two human souls approach each
other gradually, like two little quivering rain-streams, before they mingle
into oneâyou will no more think these things trivial than you will think the
first-detected signs of coming spring trivial, though they be but a faint
indescribable something in the air and in the song of the birds, and the
tiniest perceptible budding on the hedge-row branches. Those slight words and
looks and touches are part of the soulâs language; and the finest language, I
believe, is chiefly made up of unimposing words, such as âlight,â âsound,â
âstars,â âmusicââwords really not worth looking at, or hearing, in themselves,
any more than âchipsâ or âsawdust.â It is only that they happen to be the signs
of something unspeakably great and beautiful. I am of opinion that love is a
great and beautiful thing too, and if you agree with me, the smallest signs of
it will not be chips and sawdust to you: they will rather be like those little
words, âlightâ and âmusic,â stirring the long-winding fibres of your memory and
enriching your present with your most precious past.

Chapter LI

Sunday Morning

Lisbethâs touch of rheumatism could not be made to appear serious enough to
detain Dinah another night from the Hall Farm, now she had made up her mind to
leave her aunt so soon, and at evening the friends must part. âFor a long
while,â Dinah had said, for she had told Lisbeth of her resolve.

âThen itâll be for all my life, anâ I shall neâer see thee again,â said
Lisbeth. âLong while! Iân got no long while tâ live. Anâ I shall be took bad
anâ die, anâ thee canst neâer come a-nigh me, anâ I shall die a-longing for
thee.â

That had been the key-note of her wailing talk all day; for Adam was not in the
house, and so she put no restraint on her complaining. She had tried poor Dinah
by returning again and again to the question, why she must go away; and
refusing to accept reasons, which seemed to her nothing but whim and
âcontrairinessâ; and still more, by regretting that she âcouldnaâ haâ one oâ
the ladsâ and be her daughter.

âThee couldstna put up wiâ Seth,â she said. âHe isna cliver enough for thee,
happen, but heâd haâ been very good tâ theeâheâs as handy as can be at doinâ
things for me when Iâm bad, anâ heâs as fond oâ the Bible anâ chappellinâ as
thee art thysen. But happen, theeâdst like a husband better as isna just the
cut oâ thysen: the runninâ brook isna athirst for thâ rain. Adam âud haâ done
for theeâI know he wouldâanâ he might come tâ like thee well enough, if
theeâdst stop. But heâs as stubborn as thâ iron barâthereâs no bending him no
way butâs own. But heâd be a fine husband for anybody, be they who they will,
so looked-on anâ so cliver as he is. And heâd be rare anâ lovinâ: it does me
good onây a look oâ the ladâs eye when he means kind towârt me.â

Dinah tried to escape from Lisbethâs closest looks and questions by finding
little tasks of housework that kept her moving about, and as soon as Seth came
home in the evening she put on her bonnet to go. It touched Dinah keenly to say
the last good-bye, and still more to look round on her way across the fields
and see the old woman still standing at the door, gazing after her till she
must have been the faintest speck in the dim aged eyes. âThe God of love and
peace be with them,â Dinah prayed, as she looked back from the last stile.
âMake them glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted them, and the
years wherein they have seen evil. It is thy will that I should part from them;
let me have no will but thine.â

Lisbeth turned into the house at last and sat down in the workshop near Seth,
who was busying himself there with fitting some bits of turned wood he had
brought from the village into a small work-box, which he meant to give to Dinah
before she went away.

âTheeât see her again oâ Sunday afore she goes,â were her first words. âIf thee
wast good for anything, theeâdst make her come in again oâ Sunday night wiâ
thee, and see me once more.â

âNay, Mother,â said Seth. âDinah âud be sure to come again if she saw right to
come. I should have no need to persuade her. She only thinks it âud be
troubling thee for nought, just to come in to say good-bye over again.â

âSheâd neâer go away, I know, if Adam âud be fond on her anâ marry her, but
everythingâs so contrairy,â said Lisbeth, with a burst of vexation.

Seth paused a moment and looked up, with a slight blush, at his motherâs face.
âWhat! Has she said anything oâ that sort to thee, Mother?â he said, in a lower
tone.

âSaid? Nay, sheâll say nothinâ. Itâs onây the men as have to wait till folks
say things afore they find âem out.â

âWell, but what makes thee think so, Mother? Whatâs put it into thy head?â

âItâs no matter whatâs put it into my head. My headâs none so hollow as it must
get in, anâ nought to put it there. I know sheâs fond on him, as I know thâ
windâs cominâ in at the door, anâ thatâs anoof. Anâ he might be willinâ to
marry her if he knowâd sheâs fond on him, but heâll neâer think onât if
somebody doesna put it intoâs head.â

His motherâs suggestion about Dinahâs feeling towards Adam was not quite a new
thought to Seth, but her last words alarmed him, lest she should herself
undertake to open Adamâs eyes. He was not sure about Dinahâs feeling, and he
thought he
was
sure about Adamâs.

âNay, Mother, nay,â he said, earnestly, âthee mustna think oâ speaking oâ such
things to Adam. Theeâst no right to say what Dinahâs feelings are if she hasna
told thee, and it âud do nothing but mischief to say such things to Adam. He
feels very grateful and affectionate toward Dinah, but heâs no thoughts towards
her that âud incline him to make her his wife, and I donât believe Dinah âud
marry him either. I donât think sheâll marry at all.â

âEh,â said Lisbeth, impatiently. âThee thinkâst so âcause she wouldna haâ thee.
Sheâll neâer marry thee; thee mightst as well like her tâ haâ thy brother.â

Seth was hurt. âMother,â he said, in a remonstrating tone, âdonât think that of
me. I should be as thankful tâ have her for a sister as thee wouldst tâ have
her for a daughter. Iâve no more thoughts about myself in that thing, and I
shall take it hard if ever thee sayâst it again.â

âWell, well, then thee shouldstna cross me wiâ sayinâ things arena as I say
they are.â

âBut, Mother,â said Seth, âtheeâdst be doing Dinah a wrong by telling Adam what
thee thinkâst about her. It âud do nothing but mischief, for it âud make Adam
uneasy if he doesna feel the same to her. And Iâm pretty sure he feels nothing
oâ the sort.â

âEh, donna tell me what theeât sure on; thee knowâst nought about it. Whatâs he
allays goinâ to the Poysersâ for, if he didna want tâ see her? He goes twice
where he used tâ go once. Happen he knowsna as he wants tâ see her; he knowsna
as I put salt inâs broth, but heâd miss it pretty quick if it warna there.
Heâll neâer think oâ marrying if it isna put intoâs head, anâ if theeâdst any
love for thy mother, theeâdst put him up toât anâ not let her go away out oâ my
sight, when I might haâ her to make a bit oâ comfort for me afore I go to bed
to my old man under the white thorn.â

âNay, Mother,â said Seth, âthee mustna think me unkind, but I should be going
against my conscience if I took upon me to say what Dinahâs feelings are. And
besides that, I think I should give offence to Adam by speaking to him at all
about marrying; and I counsel thee not to doât. Thee mayâst be quite deceived
about Dinah. Nay, Iâm pretty sure, by words she said to me last Sabbath, as
sheâs no mind to marry.â

âEh, theeât as contrairy as the rest on âem. If it war summat I didna want, it
âud be done fast enough.â

Lisbeth rose from the bench at this, and went out of the workshop, leaving Seth
in much anxiety lest she should disturb Adamâs mind about Dinah. He consoled
himself after a time with reflecting that, since Adamâs trouble, Lisbeth had
been very timid about speaking to him on matters of feeling, and that she would
hardly dare to approach this tenderest of all subjects. Even if she did, he
hoped Adam would not take much notice of what she said.

Seth was right in believing that Lisbeth would be held in restraint by
timidity, and during the next three days, the intervals in which she had an
opportunity of speaking to Adam were too rare and short to cause her any strong
temptation. But in her long solitary hours she brooded over her regretful
thoughts about Dinah, till they had grown very near that point of unmanageable
strength when thoughts are apt to take wing out of their secret nest in a
startling manner. And on Sunday morning, when Seth went away to chapel at
Treddleston, the dangerous opportunity came.

Sunday morning was the happiest time in all the week to Lisbeth, for as there
was no service at Hayslope church till the afternoon, Adam was always at home,
doing nothing but reading, an occupation in which she could venture to
interrupt him. Moreover, she had always a better dinner than usual to prepare
for her sonsâvery frequently for Adam and herself alone, Seth being often away
the entire dayâand the smell of the roast meat before the clear fire in the
clean kitchen, the clock ticking in a peaceful Sunday manner, her darling Adam
seated near her in his best clothes, doing nothing very important, so that she
could go and stroke her hand across his hair if she liked, and see him look up
at her and smile, while Gyp, rather jealous, poked his muzzle up between
themâall these things made poor Lisbethâs earthly paradise.

The book Adam most often read on a Sunday morning was his large pictured Bible,
and this morning it lay open before him on the round white deal table in the
kitchen; for he sat there in spite of the fire, because he knew his mother
liked to have him with her, and it was the only day in the week when he could
indulge her in that way. You would have liked to see Adam reading his Bible. He
never opened it on a weekday, and so he came to it as a holiday book, serving
him for history, biography, and poetry. He held one hand thrust between his
waistcoat buttons, and the other ready to turn the pages, and in the course of
the morning you would have seen many changes in his face. Sometimes his lips
moved in semi-articulationâit was when he came to a speech that he could fancy
himself uttering, such as Samuelâs dying speech to the people; then his
eyebrows would be raised, and the corners of his mouth would quiver a little
with sad sympathyâsomething, perhaps old Isaacâs meeting with his son, touched
him closely; at other times, over the New Testament, a very solemn look would
come upon his face, and he would every now and then shake his head in serious
assent, or just lift up his hand and let it fall again. And on some mornings,
when he read in the Apocrypha, of which he was very fond, the son of Sirachâs
keen-edged words would bring a delighted smile, though he also enjoyed the
freedom of occasionally differing from an Apocryphal writer. For Adam knew the
Articles quite well, as became a good churchman.

Lisbeth, in the pauses of attending to her dinner, always sat opposite to him
and watched him, till she could rest no longer without going up to him and
giving him a caress, to call his attention to her. This morning he was reading
the Gospel according to St. Matthew, and Lisbeth had been standing close by him
for some minutes, stroking his hair, which was smoother than usual this
morning, and looking down at the large page with silent wonderment at the
mystery of letters. She was encouraged to continue this caress, because when
she first went up to him, he had thrown himself back in his chair to look at
her affectionately and say, âWhy, Mother, thee lookâst rare and hearty this
morning. Eh, Gyp wants me tâ look at him. He canât abide to think I love thee
the best.â Lisbeth said nothing, because she wanted to say so many things. And
now there was a new leaf to be turned over, and it was a pictureâthat of the
angel seated on the great stone that has been rolled away from the sepulchre.
This picture had one strong association in Lisbethâs memory, for she had been
reminded of it when she first saw Dinah, and Adam had no sooner turned the
page, and lifted the book sideways that they might look at the angel, than she
said, âThatâs herâthatâs Dinah.â

Adam smiled, and, looking more intently at the angelâs face, said,

âIt
is
a bit like her; but Dinahâs prettier, I think.â

âWell, then, if thee thinkâst her so pretty, why arnât fond on her?â

Adam looked up in surprise. âWhy, Mother, dost think I donât set store by
Dinah?â

âNay,â said Lisbeth, frightened at her own courage, yet feeling that she had
broken the ice, and the waters must flow, whatever mischief they might do.
âWhatâs thâ use oâ settinâ store by things as are thirty mile off? If thee wast
fond enough on her, thee wouldstna let her go away.â

âBut Iâve no right tâ hinder her, if she thinks well,â said Adam, looking at
his book as if he wanted to go on reading. He foresaw a series of complaints
tending to nothing. Lisbeth sat down again in the chair opposite to him, as she
said:

âBut she wouldna think well if thee wastna so contrairy.â Lisbeth dared not
venture beyond a vague phrase yet.

âContrairy, mother?â Adam said, looking up again in some anxiety. âWhat have I
done? What dost mean?â

âWhy, theeât never look at nothinâ, nor think oâ nothinâ, but thy figurin, anâ
thy work,â said Lisbeth, half-crying. âAnâ dost think thee canst go on so all
thy life, as if thee wast a man cut out oâ timber? Anâ what wut do when thy
motherâs gone, anâ nobody to take care on thee as thee gettâst a bit oâ victual
comfortable iâ the morninâ?â

âWhat hast got iâ thy mind, Mother?â said Adam, vexed at this whimpering. âI
canna see what theeât driving at. Is there anything I could do for thee as I
donât do?â

âAye, anâ that there is. Thee mightâst do as I should haâ somebody wiâ me to
comfort me a bit, anâ wait on me when Iâm bad, anâ be good to me.â

âWell, Mother, whose fault is it there isna some tidy body iâ thâ house tâ help
thee? It isna by my wish as thee hast a stroke oâ work to do. We can afford
itâIâve told thee often enough. It âud be a deal better for us.â

âEh, whatâs the use oâ talking oâ tidy bodies, when thee meanâst one oâ thâ
wenches out oâ thâ village, or somebody from Treddlesâon as I neâer set eyes on
iâ my life? Iâd sooner make a shift anâ get into my own coffin afore I die, nor
haâ them folks to put me in.â

Adam was silent, and tried to go on reading. That was the utmost severity he
could show towards his mother on a Sunday morning. But Lisbeth had gone too far
now to check herself, and after scarcely a minuteâs quietness she began again.

âThee mightst know well enough who âtis Iâd like tâ haâ wiâ me. It isna many
folks I send for tâ come anâ see me, I reckon. Anâ theeâst had the fetchinâ on
her times enow.â

âThee meanâst Dinah, Mother, I know,â said Adam. âBut itâs no use setting thy
mind on what canât be. If Dinah âud be willing to stay at Hayslope, it isnât
likely she can come away from her auntâs house, where they hold her like a
daughter, and where sheâs more bound than she is to us. If it had been so that
she could haâ married Seth, that âud haâ been a great blessing to us, but we
canât have things just as we like in this life. Thee must try and make up thy
mind to do without her.â

âNay, but I canna maâ up my mind, when sheâs just cut out for thee; anâ nought
shall maâ me believe as God didna make her anâ send her there oâ purpose for
thee. Whatâs it sinnify about her beinâ a Methody! It âud happen wear out on
her wiâ marryinâ.â

Adam threw himself back in his chair and looked at his mother. He understood
now what she had been aiming at from the beginning of the conversation. It was
as unreasonable, impracticable a wish as she had ever urged, but he could not
help being moved by so entirely new an idea. The chief point, however, was to
chase away the notion from his motherâs mind as quickly as possible.

âMother,â he said, gravely, âtheeât talking wild. Donât let me hear thee say
such things again. Itâs no good talking oâ what can never be. Dinahâs not for
marrying; sheâs fixed her heart on a different sort oâ life.â

âVery like,â said Lisbeth, impatiently, âvery like sheâs none for marrâing,
when them as sheâd be willinâ tâ marry wonna ax her. I shouldna haâ been for
marrâing thy feyther if heâd neâer axed me; anâ sheâs as fond oâ thee as eâer I
war oâ Thias, poor fellow.â

The blood rushed to Adamâs face, and for a few moments he was not quite
conscious where he was. His mother and the kitchen had vanished for him, and he
saw nothing but Dinahâs face turned up towards his. It seemed as if there were
a resurrection of his dead joy. But he woke up very speedily from that dream
(the waking was chill and sad), for it would have been very foolish in him to
believe his motherâs wordsâshe could have no ground for them. He was prompted
to express his disbelief very stronglyâperhaps that he might call forth the
proofs, if there were any to be offered.

âWhat dost say such things for, Mother, when theeâst got no foundation for âem?
Thee knowâst nothing as gives thee a right to say that.â

âThen I knowna nought as giâes me a right to say as the yearâs turned, for all
I feel it fust thing when I get up iâ thâ morning. She isna fond oâ Seth, I
reckon, is she? She doesna want to marry
him?
But I can see as she
doesna behave towârt thee as she daes towârt Seth. She makes no more oâ Sethâs
coming a-nigh her nor if he war Gyp, but sheâs all of a tremble when theeât
a-sittinâ down by her at breakfast anâ a-looking at her. Thee thinkâst thy
mother knows nought, but she war alive afore thee wast born.â

âBut thee canstna be sure as the trembling means love?â said Adam anxiously.

âEh, what else should it mane? It isna hate, I reckon. Anâ what should she do
but love thee? Theeât made to be lovedâfor whereâs there a straighter cliverer
man? Anâ whatâs it sinnify her beinâ a Methody? Itâs onây the marigold iâ thâ
parridge.â

Adam had thrust his hands in his pockets, and was looking down at the book on
the table, without seeing any of the letters. He was trembling like a
gold-seeker who sees the strong promise of gold but sees in the same moment a
sickening vision of disappointment. He could not trust his motherâs insight;
she had seen what she wished to see. And yetâand yet, now the suggestion had
been made to him, he remembered so many things, very slight things, like the
stirring of the water by an imperceptible breeze, which seemed to him some
confirmation of his motherâs words.

Lisbeth noticed that he was moved. She went on, âAnâ theeât find out as theeât
poorly aff when sheâs gone. Theeât fonder on her nor thee knowâst. Thy eyes
follow her about, welly as Gypâs follow thee.â

Adam could sit still no longer. He rose, took down his hat, and went out into
the fields.

The sunshine was on them: that early autumn sunshine which we should know was
not summerâs, even if there were not the touches of yellow on the lime and
chestnut; the Sunday sunshine too, which has more than autumnal calmness for
the working man; the morning sunshine, which still leaves the dew-crystals on
the fine gossamer webs in the shadow of the bushy hedgerows.

Adam needed the calm influence; he was amazed at the way in which this new
thought of Dinahâs love had taken possession of him, with an overmastering
power that made all other feelings give way before the impetuous desire to know
that the thought was true. Strange, that till that moment the possibility of
their ever being lovers had never crossed his mind, and yet now, all his
longing suddenly went out towards that possibility. He had no more doubt or
hesitation as to his own wishes than the bird that flies towards the opening
through which the daylight gleams and the breath of heaven enters.

The autumnal Sunday sunshine soothed him, but not by preparing him with
resignation to the disappointment if his motherâif he himselfâproved to be
mistaken about Dinah. It soothed him by gentle encouragement of his hopes. Her
love was so like that calm sunshine that they seemed to make one presence to
him, and he believed in them both alike. And Dinah was so bound up with the sad
memories of his first passion that he was not forsaking them, but rather giving
them a new sacredness by loving her. Nay, his love for her had grown out of
that past: it was the noon of that morning.

But Seth? Would the lad be hurt? Hardly; for he had seemed quite contented of
late, and there was no selfish jealousy in him; he had never been jealous of
his motherâs fondness for Adam. But had
he
seen anything of what their
mother talked about? Adam longed to know this, for he thought he could trust
Sethâs observation better than his motherâs. He must talk to Seth before he
went to see Dinah, and, with this intention in his mind, he walked back to the
cottage and said to his mother, âDid Seth say anything to thee about when he
was coming home? Will he be back to dinner?â

âAye, lad, heâll be back for a wonder. He isna gone to Treddlesâon. Heâs gone
somewhere else a-preachinâ and a-prayinâ.â

âHast any notion which way heâs gone?â said Adam.

âNay, but he aften goes to thâ Common. Thee knowâst more oâs goings nor I do.â

Adam wanted to go and meet Seth, but he must content himself with walking about
the near fields and getting sight of him as soon as possible. That would not be
for more than an hour to come, for Seth would scarcely be at home much before
their dinner-time, which was twelve oâclock. But Adam could not sit down to his
reading again, and he sauntered along by the brook and stood leaning against
the stiles, with eager intense eyes, which looked as if they saw something very
vividly; but it was not the brook or the willows, not the fields or the sky.
Again and again his vision was interrupted by wonder at the strength of his own
feeling, at the strength and sweetness of this new loveâalmost like the wonder
a man feels at the added power he finds in himself for an art which he had laid
aside for a space. How is it that the poets have said so many fine things about
our first love, so few about our later love? Are their first poems their best?
Or are not those the best which come from their fuller thought, their larger
experience, their deeper-rooted affections? The boyâs flutelike voice has its
own spring charm; but the man should yield a richer deeper music.

At last, there was Seth, visible at the farthest stile, and Adam hastened to
meet him. Seth was surprised, and thought something unusual must have happened,
but when Adam came up, his face said plainly enough that it was nothing
alarming.

âWhere hast been?â said Adam, when they were side by side.

âIâve been to the Common,â said Seth. âDinahâs been speaking the Word to a
little company of hearers at Brimstoneâs, as they call him. Theyâre folks as
never go to church hardlyâthem on the Commonâbut theyâll go and hear Dinah a
bit. Sheâs been speaking with power this forenoon from the words, âI came not
to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.â And there was a little thing
happened as was pretty to see. The women mostly bring their children with âem,
but to-day there was one stout curly headed fellow about three or four year
old, that I never saw there before. He was as naughty as could be at the
beginning while I was praying, and while we was singing, but when we all sat
down and Dinah began to speak, thâ young un stood stock still all at once, and
began to look at her withâs mouth open, and presently he ran away fromâs mother
and went to Dinah, and pulled at her, like a little dog, for her to take notice
of him. So Dinah lifted him up and held thâ lad on her lap, while she went on
speaking; and he was as good as could be till he went to sleepâand the mother
cried to see him.â

âItâs a pity she shouldna be a mother herself,â said Adam, âso fond as the
children are of her. Dost think sheâs quite fixed against marrying, Seth? Dost
think nothing âud turn her?â

There was something peculiar in his brotherâs tone, which made Seth steal a
glance at his face before he answered.

âIt âud be wrong of me to say nothing âud turn her,â he answered. âBut if thee
meanâst it about myself, Iâve given up all thoughts as she can ever be

my
wife. She calls me her brother, and thatâs enough.â

âBut dost think she might ever get fond enough of anybody else to be willing to
marry âem?â said Adam rather shyly.

âWell,â said Seth, after some hesitation, âitâs crossed my mind sometimes oâ
late as she might; but Dinah âud let no fondness for the creature draw her out
oâ the path as she believed God had marked out for her. If she thought the
leading was not from Him, sheâs not one to be brought under the power of it.
And sheâs allays seemed clear about thatâas her work was to minister tâ others,
and make no home for herself iâ this world.â

âBut suppose,â said Adam, earnestly, âsuppose there was a man as âud let her do
just the same and not interfere with herâshe might do a good deal oâ what she
does now, just as well when she was married as when she was single. Other women
of her sort have marriedâthatâs to say, not just like her, but women as
preached and attended on the sick and needy. Thereâs Mrs. Fletcher as she talks
of.â

A new light had broken in on Seth. He turned round, and laying his hand on
Adamâs shoulder, said, âWhy, wouldst like her to marry
thee
, brother?â

Adam looked doubtfully at Sethâs inquiring eyes and said, âWouldst be hurt if
she was to be fonder oâ me than oâ thee?â

âNay,â said Seth warmly, âhow canst think it? Have I felt thy trouble so little
that I shouldna feel thy joy?â

There was silence a few moments as they walked on, and then Seth said, âIâd no
notion as theeâdst ever think of her for a wife.â

âBut is it oâ any use to think of her?â said Adam. âWhat dost say? Motherâs
made me as I hardly know where I am, with what sheâs been saying to me this
forenoon. She says sheâs sure Dinah feels for me more than common, and âud be
willing tâ have me. But Iâm afraid she speaks without book. I want to know if
theeâst seen anything.â

âItâs a nice point to speak about,â said Seth, âand Iâm afraid oâ being wrong;
besides, weâve no right tâ intermeddle with peopleâs feelings when they
wouldnât tell âem themselves.â

Seth paused.

âBut thee mightst ask her,â he said presently. âShe took no offence at

me
for asking, and theeâst more right than I had, only theeât not in the
Society. But Dinah doesnât hold wiâ them as are for keeping the Society so
strict to themselves. She doesnât mind about making folks enter the Society, so
as theyâre fit tâ enter the kingdom oâ God. Some oâ the brethren at Treddlesâon
are displeased with her for that.â

âWhere will she be the rest oâ the day?â said Adam.

âShe said she shouldnât leave the farm again to-day,â said Seth, âbecause itâs
her last Sabbath there, and sheâs going tâ read out oâ the big Bible wiâ the
children.â

Adam thoughtâbut did not sayââThen Iâll go this afternoon; for if I go to
church, my thoughts âull be with her all the while. They must sing thâ anthem
without me to-day.â

Chapter LII

Adam and Dinah

It was about three oâclock when Adam entered the farmyard and roused Alick and
the dogs from their Sunday dozing. Alick said everybody was gone to church âbut
thâ young missisââso he called Dinahâbut this did not disappoint Adam, although
the âeverybodyâ was so liberal as to include Nancy the dairymaid, whose works
of necessity were not unfrequently incompatible with church-going.

There was perfect stillness about the house. The doors were all closed, and the
very stones and tubs seemed quieter than usual. Adam heard the water gently
dripping from the pumpâthat was the only soundâand he knocked at the house door
rather softly, as was suitable in that stillness.

The door opened, and Dinah stood before him, colouring deeply with the great
surprise of seeing Adam at this hour, when she knew it was his regular practice
to be at church. Yesterday he would have said to her without any difficulty, âI
came to see you, Dinah: I knew the rest were not at home.â But to-day something
prevented him from saying that, and he put out his hand to her in silence.
Neither of them spoke, and yet both wished they could speak, as Adam entered,
and they sat down. Dinah took the chair she had just left; it was at the corner
of the table near the window, and there was a book lying on the table, but it
was not open. She had been sitting perfectly still, looking at the small bit of
clear fire in the bright grate. Adam sat down opposite her, in Mr. Poyserâs
three-cornered chair.

âYour mother is not ill again, I hope, Adam?â Dinah said, recovering herself.
âSeth said she was well this morning.â

âNo, sheâs very hearty to-day,â said Adam, happy in the signs of Dinahâs
feeling at the sight of him, but shy.

âThereâs nobody at home, you see,â Dinah said; âbut youâll wait. Youâve been
hindered from going to church to-day, doubtless.â

âYes,â Adam said, and then paused, before he added, âI was thinking about you:
that was the reason.â

This confession was very awkward and sudden, Adam felt, for he thought Dinah
must understand all he meant. But the frankness of the words caused her
immediately to interpret them into a renewal of his brotherly regrets that she
was going away, and she answered calmly, âDo not be careful and troubled for
me, Adam. I have all things and abound at Snowfield. And my mind is at rest,
for I am not seeking my own will in going.â

âBut if things were different, Dinah,â said Adam, hesitatingly. âIf you knew
things that perhaps you donât know now....â

Dinah looked at him inquiringly, but instead of going on, he reached a chair
and brought it near the corner of the table where she was sitting. She
wondered, and was afraidâand the next moment her thoughts flew to the past: was
it something about those distant unhappy ones that she didnât know?

Adam looked at her. It was so sweet to look at her eyes, which had now a
self-forgetful questioning in themâfor a moment he forgot that he wanted to say
anything, or that it was necessary to tell her what he meant.

âDinah,â he said suddenly, taking both her hands between his, âI love you with
my whole heart and soul. I love you next to God who made me.â

Dinahâs lips became pale, like her cheeks, and she trembled violently under the
shock of painful joy. Her hands were cold as death between Adamâs. She could
not draw them away, because he held them fast.

âDonât tell me you canât love me, Dinah. Donât tell me we must part and pass
our lives away from one another.â

The tears were trembling in Dinahâs eyes, and they fell before she could
answer. But she spoke in a quiet low voice.

âYes, dear Adam, we must submit to another Will. We must part.â

âNot if you love me, Dinahânot if you love me,â Adam said passionately. âTell
meâtell me if you can love me better than a brother?â

Dinah was too entirely reliant on the Supreme guidance to attempt to achieve
any end by a deceptive concealment. She was recovering now from the first shock
of emotion, and she looked at Adam with simple sincere eyes as she said, âYes,
Adam, my heart is drawn strongly towards you; and of my own will, if I had no
clear showing to the contrary, I could find my happiness in being near you and
ministering to you continually. I fear I should forget to rejoice and weep with
others; nay, I fear I should forget the Divine presence, and seek no love but
yours.â

Adam did not speak immediately. They sat looking at each other in delicious
silenceâfor the first sense of mutual love excludes other feelings; it will
have the soul all to itself.

âThen, Dinah,â Adam said at last, âhow can there be anything contrary to whatâs
right in our belonging to one another and spending our lives together? Who put
this great love into our hearts? Can anything be holier than that? For we can
help one another in everything as is good. Iâd never think oâ putting myself
between you and God, and saying you oughtnât to do this and you oughtnât to do
that. Youâd follow your conscience as much as you do now.â

âYes, Adam,â Dinah said, âI know marriage is a holy state for those who are
truly called to it, and have no other drawing; but from my childhood upwards I
have been led towards another path; all my peace and my joy have come from
having no life of my own, no wants, no wishes for myself, and living only in
God and those of his creatures whose sorrows and joys he has given me to know.
Those have been very blessed years to me, and I feel that if I was to listen to
any voice that would draw me aside from that path, I should be turning my back
on the light that has shone upon me, and darkness and doubt would take hold of
me. We could not bless each other, Adam, if there were doubts in my soul, and
if I yearned, when it was too late, after that better part which had once been
given me and I had put away from me.â

âBut if a new feeling has come into your mind, Dinah, and if you love me so as
to be willing to be nearer to me than to other people, isnât that a sign that
itâs right for you to change your life? Doesnât the love make it right when
nothing else would?â

âAdam, my mind is full of questionings about that; for now, since you tell me
of your strong love towards me, what was clear to me has become dark again. I
felt before that my heart was too strongly drawn towards you, and that your
heart was not as mine; and the thought of you had taken hold of me, so that my
soul had lost its freedom, and was becoming enslaved to an earthly affection,
which made me anxious and careful about what should befall myself. For in all
other affection I had been content with any small return, or with none; but my
heart was beginning to hunger after an equal love from you. And I had no doubt
that I must wrestle against that as a great temptation, and the command was
clear that I must go away.â

âBut now, dear, dear Dinah, now you know I love you better than you love me...
itâs all different now. You wonât think oâ going. Youâll stay, and be my dear
wife, and I shall thank God for giving me my life as I never thanked him
before.â

âAdam, itâs hard to me to turn a deaf ear... you know itâs hard; but a great
fear is upon me. It seems to me as if you were stretching out your arms to me,
and beckoning me to come and take my ease and live for my own delight, and
Jesus, the Man of Sorrows, was standing looking towards me, and pointing to the
sinful, and suffering, and afflicted. I have seen that again and again when I
have been sitting in stillness and darkness, and a great terror has come upon
me lest I should become hard, and a lover of self, and no more bear willingly
the Redeemerâs cross.â

Dinah had closed her eyes, and a faint shudder went through her. âAdam,â she
went on, âyou wouldnât desire that we should seek a good through any
unfaithfulness to the light that is in us; you wouldnât believe that could be a
good. We are of one mind in that.â

âYes, Dinah,â said Adam sadly, âIâll never be the man tâ urge you against your
conscience. But I canât give up the hope that you may come to see different. I
donât believe your loving me could shut up your heartâitâs only adding to what
youâve been before, not taking away from it. For it seems to me itâs the same
with love and happiness as with sorrowâthe more we know of it the better we can
feel what other peopleâs lives are or might be, and so we shall only be more
tender to âem, and wishful to help âem. The more knowledge a man has, the
better heâll doâs work; and feelingâs a sort oâ knowledge.â

Dinah was silent; her eyes were fixed in contemplation of something visible
only to herself. Adam went on presently with his pleading, âAnd you can do
almost as much as you do now. I wonât ask you to go to church with me of a
Sunday. You shall go where you like among the people, and teach âem; for though
I like church best, I donât put my soul above yours, as if my words was better
for you to follow than your own conscience. And you can help the sick just as
much, and youâll have more means oâ making âem a bit comfortable; and youâll be
among all your own friends as love you, and can help âem and be a blessing to
âem till their dying day. Surely, Dinah, youâd be as near to God as if you was
living lonely and away from me.â

Dinah made no answer for some time. Adam was still holding her hands and
looking at her with almost trembling anxiety, when she turned her grave loving
eyes on his and said, in rather a sad voice, âAdam there is truth in what you
say, and thereâs many of the brethren and sisters who have greater strength
than I have, and find their hearts enlarged by the cares of husband and
kindred. But I have not faith that it would be so with me, for since my
affections have been set above measure on you, I have had less peace and joy in
God. I have felt as it were a division in my heart. And think how it is with
me, Adam. That life I have led is like a land I have trodden in blessedness
since my childhood; and if I long for a moment to follow the voice which calls
me to another land that I know not, I cannot but fear that my soul might
hereafter yearn for that early blessedness which I had forsaken; and where
doubt enters there is not perfect love. I must wait for clearer guidance. I
must go from you, and we must submit ourselves entirely to the Divine Will. We
are sometimes required to lay our natural lawful affections on the altar.â

Adam dared not plead again, for Dinahâs was not the voice of caprice or
insincerity. But it was very hard for him; his eyes got dim as he looked at
her.

âBut you may come to feel satisfied... to feel that you may come to me again,
and we may never part, Dinah?â

âWe must submit ourselves, Adam. With time, our duty will be made clear. It may
be when I have entered on my former life, I shall find all these new thoughts
and wishes vanish, and become as things that were not. Then I shall know that
my calling is not towards marriage. But we must wait.â

âDinah,â said Adam mournfully, âyou canât love me so well as I love you, else
youâd have no doubts. But itâs natural you shouldnât, for Iâm not so good as
you. I canât doubt itâs right for me to love the best thing Godâs ever given me
to know.â

âNay, Adam. It seems to me that my love for you is not weak, for my heart waits
on your words and looks, almost as a little child waits on the help and
tenderness of the strong on whom it depends. If the thought of you took slight
hold of me, I should not fear that it would be an idol in the temple. But you
will strengthen meâyou will not hinder me in seeking to obey to the uttermost.â

âLet us go out into the sunshine, Dinah, and walk together. Iâll speak no word
to disturb you.â

They went out and walked towards the fields, where they would meet the family
coming from church. Adam said, âTake my arm, Dinah,â and she took it. That was
the only change in their manner to each other since they were last walking
together. But no sadness in the prospect of her going awayâin the uncertainty
of the issueâcould rob the sweetness from Adamâs sense that Dinah loved him. He
thought he would stay at the Hall Farm all that evening. He would be near her
as long as he could.

âHey-day! Thereâs Adam along wiâ Dinah,â said Mr. Poyser, as he opened the far
gate into the Home Close. âI couldna think how he happened away from church.
Why,â added good Martin, after a momentâs pause, âwhat dost think has just
jumped into my head?â

âSummat as hadna far to jump, for itâs just under our nose. You mean as Adamâs
fond oâ Dinah.â

âAye! hast ever had any notion of it before?â

âTo be sure I have,â said Mrs. Poyser, who always declined, if possible, to be
taken by surprise. âIâm not one oâ those as can see the cat iâ the dairy anâ
wonder what sheâs come after.â

âThee never saidst a word to me about it.â

âWell, I arenât like a bird-clapper, forced to make a rattle when the wind
blows on me. I can keep my own counsel when thereâs no good iâ speaking.â

âBut Dinah âll haâ none oâ him. Dost think she will?â

âNay,â said Mrs. Poyser, not sufficiently on her guard against a possible
surprise, âsheâll never marry anybody, if he isnât a Methodist and a cripple.â

âIt âud haâ been a pretty thing though for âem tâ marry,â said Martin, turning
his head on one side, as if in pleased contemplation of his new idea. âTheeâdst
haâ liked it too, wouldstna?â

âAh! I should. I should haâ been sure of her then, as she wouldnât go away from
me to Snowfield, welly thirty mile off, and me not got a creatur to look to,
only neighbours, as are no kin to me, anâ most of âem women as Iâd be ashamed
to show my face, if
my
dairy things war like theirân. There may well be
streaky butter iâ the market. Anâ I should be glad to see the poor thing
settled like a Christian woman, with a house of her own over her head; and weâd
stock her well wiâ linen and feathers, for I love her next to my own children.
Anâ she makes one feel safer when sheâs iâ the house, for sheâs like the driven
snow: anybody might sin for two as had her at their elbow.â

âDinah,â said Tommy, running forward to meet her, âmother says youâll never
marry anybody but a Methodist cripple. What a silly you must be!â a comment
which Tommy followed up by seizing Dinah with both arms, and dancing along by
her side with incommodious fondness.

âWhy, Adam, we missed you iâ the singing to-day,â said Mr. Poyser. âHow was
it?â

âI wanted to see Dinahâsheâs going away so soon,â said Adam.

âAh, lad! Can you persuade her to stop somehow? Find her a good husband
somewhere iâ the parish. If youâll do that, weâll forgive you for missing
church. But, anyway, she isna going before the harvest supper oâ Wednesday, and
you must come then. Thereâs Bartle Massey cominâ, anâ happen Craig. Youâll be
sure anâ come, now, at seven? The missis wunna have it a bit later.â

âAye,â said Adam, âIâll come if I can. But I canât often say what Iâll do
beforehand, for the work often holds me longer than I expect. Youâll stay till
the end oâ the week, Dinah?â

âYes, yes!â said Mr. Poyser. âWeâll have no nay.â

âSheâs no call to be in a hurry,â observed Mrs. Poyser. âScarceness oâ victual
âull keep: thereâs no need to be hasty wiâ the cooking. Anâ scarceness is what
thereâs the biggest stock of iâ that country.â

Dinah smiled, but gave no promise to stay, and they talked of other things
through the rest of the walk, lingering in the sunshine to look at the great
flock of geese grazing, at the new corn-ricks, and at the surprising abundance
of fruit on the old pear-tree; Nancy and Molly having already hastened home,
side by side, each holding, carefully wrapped in her pocket-handkerchief, a
prayer-book, in which she could read little beyond the large letters and the
Amens.

Surely all other leisure is hurry compared with a sunny walk through the fields
from âafternoon churchââas such walks used to be in those old leisurely times,
when the boat, gliding sleepily along the canal, was the newest locomotive
wonder; when Sunday books had most of them old brown-leather covers, and opened
with remarkable precision always in one place. Leisure is goneâgone where the
spinning-wheels are gone, and the pack-horses, and the slow waggons, and the
pedlars, who brought bargains to the door on sunny afternoons. Ingenious
philosophers tell you, perhaps, that the great work of the steam-engine is to
create leisure for mankind. Do not believe them: it only creates a vacuum for
eager thought to rush in. Even idleness is eager nowâeager for amusement; prone
to excursion-trains, art museums, periodical literature, and exciting novels;
prone even to scientific theorizing and cursory peeps through microscopes. Old
Leisure was quite a different personage. He only read one newspaper, innocent
of leaders, and was free from that periodicity of sensations which we call
post-time. He was a contemplative, rather stout gentleman, of excellent
digestion; of quiet perceptions, undiseased by hypothesis; happy in his
inability to know the causes of things, preferring the things themselves. He
lived chiefly in the country, among pleasant seats and homesteads, and was fond
of sauntering by the fruit-tree wall and scenting the apricots when they were
warmed by the morning sunshine, or of sheltering himself under the orchard
boughs at noon, when the summer pears were falling. He knew nothing of weekday
services, and thought none the worse of the Sunday sermon if it allowed him to
sleep from the text to the blessing; liking the afternoon service best, because
the prayers were the shortest, and not ashamed to say so; for he had an easy,
jolly conscience, broad-backed like himself, and able to carry a great deal of
beer or port-wine, not being made squeamish by doubts and qualms and lofty
aspirations. Life was not a task to him, but a sinecure. He fingered the
guineas in his pocket, and ate his dinners, and slept the sleep of the
irresponsible, for had he not kept up his character by going to church on the
Sunday afternoons?

Fine old Leisure! Do not be severe upon him, and judge him by our modern
standard. He never went to Exeter Hall, or heard a popular preacher, or read

Tracts for the Times
or
Sartor Resartus
.

Chapter LIII

The Harvest Supper

As Adam was going homeward, on Wednesday evening, in the six oâclock sunlight,
he saw in the distance the last load of barley winding its way towards the
yard-gate of the Hall Farm, and heard the chant of âHarvest Home!â rising and
sinking like a wave. Fainter and fainter, and more musical through the growing
distance, the falling dying sound still reached him, as he neared the Willow
Brook. The low westering sun shone right on the shoulders of the old Binton
Hills, turning the unconscious sheep into bright spots of light; shone on the
windows of the cottage too, and made them a-flame with a glory beyond that of
amber or amethyst. It was enough to make Adam feel that he was in a great
temple, and that the distant chant was a sacred song.

âItâs wonderful,â he thought, âhow that sound goes to oneâs heart almost like a
funeral bell, for all it tells one oâ the joyfullest time oâ the year, and the
time when men are mostly the thankfullest. I suppose itâs a bit hard to us to
think anythingâs over and gone in our lives; and thereâs a parting at the root
of all our joys. Itâs like what I feel about Dinah. I should never haâ come to
know that her love âud be the greatest oâ blessings to me, if what I counted a
blessing hadnât been wrenched and torn away from me, and left me with a greater
need, so as I could crave and hunger for a greater and a better comfort.â

He expected to see Dinah again this evening, and get leave to accompany her as
far as Oakbourne; and then he would ask her to fix some time when he might go
to Snowfield, and learn whether the last best hope that had been born to him
must be resigned like the rest. The work he had to do at home, besides putting
on his best clothes, made it seven before he was on his way again to the Hall
Farm, and it was questionable whether, with his longest and quickest strides,
he should be there in time even for the roast beef, which came after the plum
pudding, for Mrs. Poyserâs supper would be punctual.

Great was the clatter of knives and pewter plates and tin cans when Adam
entered the house, but there was no hum of voices to this accompaniment: the
eating of excellent roast beef, provided free of expense, was too serious a
business to those good farm-labourers to be performed with a divided attention,
even if they had had anything to say to each otherâwhich they had not. And Mr.
Poyser, at the head of the table, was too busy with his carving to listen to
Bartle Masseyâs or Mr. Craigâs ready talk.

âHere, Adam,â said Mrs. Poyser, who was standing and looking on to see that
Molly and Nancy did their duty as waiters, âhereâs a place kept for you between
Mr. Massey and the boys. Itâs a poor tale you couldnât come to see the pudding
when it was whole.â

Adam looked anxiously round for a fourth womanâs figure, but Dinah was not
there. He was almost afraid of asking about her; besides, his attention was
claimed by greetings, and there remained the hope that Dinah was in the house,
though perhaps disinclined to festivities on the eve of her departure.

It was a goodly sightâthat table, with Martin Poyserâs round good-humoured face
and large person at the head of it helping his servants to the fragrant roast
beef and pleased when the empty plates came again. Martin, though usually blest
with a good appetite, really forgot to finish his own beef to-nightâit was so
pleasant to him to look on in the intervals of carving and see how the others
enjoyed their supper; for were they not men who, on all the days of the year
except Christmas Day and Sundays, ate their cold dinner, in a makeshift manner,
under the hedgerows, and drank their beer out of wooden bottlesâwith relish
certainly, but with their mouths towards the zenith, after a fashion more
endurable to ducks than to human bipeds. Martin Poyser had some faint
conception of the flavour such men must find in hot roast beef and fresh-drawn
ale. He held his head on one side and screwed up his mouth, as he nudged Bartle
Massey, and watched half-witted Tom Tholer, otherwise known as âTom Saft,â
receiving his second plateful of beef. A grin of delight broke over Tomâs face
as the plate was set down before him, between his knife and fork, which he held
erect, as if they had been sacred tapers. But the delight was too strong to
continue smouldering in a grinâit burst out the next instant in a long-drawn
âhaw, haw!â followed by a sudden collapse into utter gravity, as the knife and
fork darted down on the prey. Martin Poyserâs large person shook with his
silent unctuous laugh. He turned towards Mrs. Poyser to see if she too had been
observant of Tom, and the eyes of husband and wife met in a glance of
good-natured amusement.

âTom Saftâ was a great favourite on the farm, where he played the part of the
old jester, and made up for his practical deficiencies by his success in
repartee. His hits, I imagine, were those of the flail, which falls quite at
random, but nevertheless smashes an insect now and then. They were much quoted
at sheep-shearing and haymaking times, but I refrain from recording them here,
lest Tomâs wit should prove to be like that of many other bygone jesters
eminent in their dayârather of a temporary nature, not dealing with the deeper
and more lasting relations of things.

Tom excepted, Martin Poyser had some pride in his servants and labourers,
thinking with satisfaction that they were the best worth their pay of any set
on the estate. There was Kester Bale, for example (Beale, probably, if the
truth were known, but he was called Bale, and was not conscious of any claim to
a fifth letter), the old man with the close leather cap and the network of
wrinkles on his sun-browned face. Was there any man in Loamshire who knew
better the ânaturâ of all farming work? He was one of those invaluable
labourers who can not only turn their hand to everything, but excel in
everything they turn their hand to. It is true Kesterâs knees were much bent
outward by this time, and he walked with a perpetual curtsy, as if he were
among the most reverent of men. And so he was; but I am obliged to admit that
the object of his reverence was his own skill, towards which he performed some
rather affecting acts of worship. He always thatched the ricksâfor if anything
were his forte more than another, it was thatchingâand when the last touch had
been put to the last beehive rick, Kester, whose home lay at some distance from
the farm, would take a walk to the rick-yard in his best clothes on a Sunday
morning and stand in the lane, at a due distance, to contemplate his own
thatching, walking about to get each rick from the proper point of view. As he
curtsied along, with his eyes upturned to the straw knobs imitative of golden
globes at the summits of the beehive ricks, which indeed were gold of the best
sort, you might have imagined him to be engaged in some pagan act of adoration.
Kester was an old bachelor and reputed to have stockings full of coin,
concerning which his master cracked a joke with him every pay-night: not a new
unseasoned joke, but a good old one, that had been tried many times before and
had worn well. âThâ young measterâs a merry mon,â Kester frequently remarked;
for having begun his career by frightening away the crows under the last Martin
Poyser but one, he could never cease to account the reigning Martin a young
master. I am not ashamed of commemorating old Kester. You and I are indebted to
the hard hands of such menâhands that have long ago mingled with the soil they
tilled so faithfully, thriftily making the best they could of the earthâs
fruits, and receiving the smallest share as their own wages.

Then, at the end of the table, opposite his master, there was Alick, the
shepherd and head-man, with the ruddy face and broad shoulders, not on the best
terms with old Kester; indeed, their intercourse was confined to an occasional
snarl, for though they probably differed little concerning hedging and ditching
and the treatment of ewes, there was a profound difference of opinion between
them as to their own respective merits. When Tityrus and Meliboeus happen to be
on the same farm, they are not sentimentally polite to each other. Alick,
indeed, was not by any means a honeyed man. His speech had usually something of
a snarl in it, and his broad-shouldered aspect something of the bull-dog
expressionââDonât you meddle with me, and I wonât meddle with you.â But he was
honest even to the splitting of an oat-grain rather than he would take beyond
his acknowledged share, and as âclose-fistedâ with his masterâs property as if
it had been his ownâthrowing very small handfuls of damaged barley to the
chickens, because a large handful affected his imagination painfully with a
sense of profusion. Good-tempered Tim, the waggoner, who loved his horses, had
his grudge against Alick in the matter of corn. They rarely spoke to each
other, and never looked at each other, even over their dish of cold potatoes;
but then, as this was their usual mode of behaviour towards all mankind, it
would be an unsafe conclusion that they had more than transient fits of
unfriendliness. The bucolic character at Hayslope, you perceive, was not of
that entirely genial, merry, broad-grinning sort, apparently observed in most
districts visited by artists. The mild radiance of a smile was a rare sight on
a field-labourerâs face, and there was seldom any gradation between bovine
gravity and a laugh. Nor was every labourer so honest as our friend Alick. At
this very table, among Mr. Poyserâs men, there is that big Ben Tholoway, a very
powerful thresher, but detected more than once in carrying away his masterâs
corn in his pocketsâan action which, as Ben was not a philosopher, could hardly
be ascribed to absence of mind. However, his master had forgiven him, and
continued to employ him, for the Tholoways had lived on the Common time out of
mind, and had always worked for the Poysers. And on the whole, I daresay,
society was not much the worse because Ben had not six months of it at the
treadmill, for his views of depredation were narrow, and the House of
Correction might have enlarged them. As it was, Ben ate his roast beef to-night
with a serene sense of having stolen nothing more than a few peas and beans as
seed for his garden since the last harvest supper, and felt warranted in
thinking that Alickâs suspicious eye, for ever upon him, was an injury to his
innocence.

But
now
the roast beef was finished and the cloth was drawn, leaving a
fair large deal table for the bright drinking-cans, and the foaming brown jugs,
and the bright brass candlesticks, pleasant to behold.
Now
, the great
ceremony of the evening was to beginâthe harvest-song, in which every man must
join. He might be in tune, if he liked to be singular, but he must not sit with
closed lips. The movement was obliged to be in triple time; the rest was
ad
libitum
.

As to the origin of this songâwhether it came in its actual state from the
brain of a single rhapsodist, or was gradually perfected by a school or
succession of rhapsodists, I am ignorant. There is a stamp of unity, of
individual genius upon it, which inclines me to the former hypothesis, though I
am not blind to the consideration that this unity may rather have arisen from
that consensus of many minds which was a condition of primitive thought,
foreign to our modern consciousness. Some will perhaps think that they detect
in the first quatrain an indication of a lost line, which later rhapsodists,
failing in imaginative vigour, have supplied by the feeble device of iteration.
Others, however, may rather maintain that this very iteration is an original
felicity, to which none but the most prosaic minds can be insensible.

The ceremony connected with the song was a drinking ceremony. (That is perhaps
a painful fact, but then, you know, we cannot reform our forefathers.) During
the first and second quatrain, sung decidedly
forte
, no can was filled.

âHereâs a health unto our master,

Â Â Â Â The founder of the feast;

Hereâs a health unto our master

Â Â Â Â And to our mistress!

And may his doings prosper,

Â Â Â Â Whateâer he takes in hand,

For we are all his servants,

Â Â Â Â And are at his command.â

But now, immediately before the third quatrain or chorus, sung

fortissimo
, with emphatic raps of the table, which gave the effect of
cymbals and drum together, Alickâs can was filled, and he was bound to empty it
before the chorus ceased.

âThen drink, boys, drink!

Â Â Â Â And see ye do not spill,

For if ye do, ye shall drink two,

Â Â Â Â For âtis our masterâs will.â

When Alick had gone successfully through this test of steady-handed manliness,
it was the turn of old Kester, at his right handâand so on, till every man had
drunk his initiatory pint under the stimulus of the chorus. Tom Saftâthe
rogueâtook care to spill a little by accident; but Mrs. Poyser (too
officiously, Tom thought) interfered to prevent the exaction of the penalty.

To any listener outside the door it would have been the reverse of obvious why
the âDrink, boys, drink!â should have such an immediate and often-repeated
encore; but once entered, he would have seen that all faces were at present
sober, and most of them seriousâit was the regular and respectable thing for
those excellent farm-labourers to do, as much as for elegant ladies and
gentlemen to smirk and bow over their wine-glasses. Bartle Massey, whose ears
were rather sensitive, had gone out to see what sort of evening it was at an
early stage in the ceremony, and had not finished his contemplation until a
silence of five minutes declared that âDrink, boys, drink!â was not likely to
begin again for the next twelvemonth. Much to the regret of the boys and Totty:
on them the stillness fell rather flat, after that glorious thumping of the
table, towards which Totty, seated on her fatherâs knee, contributed with her
small might and small fist.

When Bartle re-entered, however, there appeared to be a general desire for solo
music after the choral. Nancy declared that Tim the waggoner knew a song and
was âallays singing like a lark iâ the stable,â whereupon Mr. Poyser said
encouragingly, âCome, Tim, lad, letâs hear it.â Tim looked sheepish, tucked
down his head, and said he couldnât sing, but this encouraging invitation of
the masterâs was echoed all round the table. It was a conversational
opportunity: everybody could say, âCome, Tim,â except Alick, who never relaxed
into the frivolity of unnecessary speech. At last, Timâs next neighbour, Ben
Tholoway, began to give emphasis to his speech by nudges, at which Tim, growing
rather savage, said, âLet me alooan, will ye? Else Iâll maâ ye sing a toon ye
wonna like.â A good-tempered waggonerâs patience has limits, and Tim was not to
be urged further.

âWell, then, David, yeâre the lad to sing,â said Ben, willing to show that he
was not discomfited by this check. âSing âMy looveâs a roos wiâout a thorn.ââ

The amatory David was a young man of an unconscious abstracted expression,
which was due probably to a squint of superior intensity rather than to any
mental characteristic; for he was not indifferent to Benâs invitation, but
blushed and laughed and rubbed his sleeve over his mouth in a way that was
regarded as a symptom of yielding. And for some time the company appeared to be
much in earnest about the desire to hear Davidâs song. But in vain. The
lyricism of the evening was in the cellar at present, and was not to be drawn
from that retreat just yet.

Meanwhile the conversation at the head of the table had taken a political turn.
Mr. Craig was not above talking politics occasionally, though he piqued himself
rather on a wise insight than on specific information. He saw so far beyond the
mere facts of a case that really it was superfluous to know them.

âIâm no reader oâ the paper myself,â he observed to-night, as he filled his
pipe, âthough I might read it fast enough if I liked, for thereâs Miss Lyddy
has âem and âs done with âem iâ no time. But thereâs Mills, now, sits iâ the
chimney-corner and reads the paper pretty nigh from morning to night, and when
heâs got to thâ end onât heâs more addle-headed than he was at the beginning.
Heâs full oâ this peace now, as they talk on; heâs been reading and reading,
and thinks heâs got to the bottom onât. âWhy, Lorâ bless you, Mills,â says I,
âyou see no more into this thing nor you can see into the middle of a potato.
Iâll tell you what it is: you think itâll be a fine thing for the country. And
Iâm not againâ itâmark my wordsâIâm not againâ it. But itâs my opinion as
thereâs them at the head oâ this country as are worse enemies to us nor Bony
and all the mounseers heâs got at âs back; for as for the mounseers, you may
skewer half-a-dozen of âem at once as if they war frogs.ââ

âAye, aye,â said Martin Poyser, listening with an air of much intelligence and
edification, âthey neâer ate a bit oâ beef iâ their lives. Mostly sallet, I
reckon.â

âAnd says I to Mills,â continued Mr. Craig, ââWill
you
try to make me
believe as furriners like them can do us half thâ harm them ministers do with
their bad government? If King George âud turn âem all away and govern by
himself, heâd see everything righted. He might take on Billy Pitt again if he
liked; but I donât see myself what we want wiâ anybody besides King and
Parliament. Itâs that nest oâ ministers does the mischief, I tell you.ââ

âAh, itâs fine talking,â observed Mrs. Poyser, who was now seated near her
husband, with Totty on her lapââitâs fine talking. Itâs hard work to tell which
is Old Harry when everybodyâs got boots on.â

âAs for this peace,â said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on one side in a
dubitative manner and giving a precautionary puff to his pipe between each
sentence, âI donât know. Thâ warâs a fine thing for the country, anâ howâll you
keep up prices wiâout it? Anâ them French are a wicked sort oâ folks, by what I
can make out. What can you do better nor fight âem?â

âYeâre partly right there, Poyser,â said Mr. Craig, âbut Iâm not againâ the
peaceâto make a holiday for a bit. We can break it when we like, anâ
Iâm

in no fear oâ Bony, for all they talk so much oâ his cliverness. Thatâs what I
says to Mills this morning. Lorâ bless you, he sees no more through Bony!...
why, I put him up to more in three minutes than he gets fromâs paper all the
year round. Says I, âAm I a gardener as knows his business, or arnât I, Mills?
Answer me that.â âTo be sure yâ are, Craig,â says heâheâs not a bad fellow,
Mills isnât, for a butler, but weak iâ the head. âWell,â says I, âyou talk oâ
Bonyâs cliverness; would it be any use my being a first-rate gardener if Iâd
got nought but a quagmire to work on?â âNo,â says he. âWell,â I says, âthatâs
just what it is wiâ Bony. Iâll not deny but he may be a bit cliverâheâs no
Frenchman born, as I understandâbut whatâs he got atâs back but mounseers?ââ

Mr. Craig paused a moment with an emphatic stare after this triumphant specimen
of Socratic argument, and then added, thumping the table rather fiercely, âWhy,
itâs a sure thingâand thereâs them âull bear witness toâtâas iâ one regiment
where there was one man a-missing, they put the regimentals on a big monkey,
and they fit him as the shell fits the walnut, and you couldnât tell the monkey
from the mounseers!â

âAh! Think oâ that, now!â said Mr. Poyser, impressed at once with the political
bearings of the fact and with its striking interest as an anecdote in natural
history.

âCome, Craig,â said Adam, âthatâs a little too strong. You donât believe that.
Itâs all nonsense about the French being such poor sticks. Mr. Irwineâs seen
âem in their own country, and he says theyâve plenty oâ fine fellows among âem.
And as for knowledge, and contrivances, and manufactures, thereâs a many things
as weâre a fine sight behind âem in. Itâs poor foolishness to run down your
enemies. Why, Nelson and the rest of âem âud have no merit iâ beating âem, if
they were such offal as folks pretend.â

Mr. Poyser looked doubtfully at Mr. Craig, puzzled by this opposition of
authorities. Mr. Irwineâs testimony was not to be disputed; but, on the other
hand, Craig was a knowing fellow, and his view was less startling. Martin had
never âheard tellâ of the French being good for much. Mr. Craig had found no
answer but such as was implied in taking a long draught of ale and then looking
down fixedly at the proportions of his own leg, which he turned a little
outward for that purpose, when Bartle Massey returned from the fireplace, where
he had been smoking his first pipe in quiet, and broke the silence by saying,
as he thrust his forefinger into the canister, âWhy, Adam, how happened you not
to be at church on Sunday? Answer me that, you rascal. The anthem went limping
without you. Are you going to disgrace your schoolmaster in his old age?â

âNo, Mr. Massey,â said Adam. âMr. and Mrs. Poyser can tell you where I was. I
was in no bad company.â

âSheâs gone, Adamâgone to Snowfield,â said Mr. Poyser, reminded of Dinah for
the first time this evening. âI thought youâd haâ persuaded her better. Nought
âud hold her, but she must go yesterday forenoon. The missis has hardly got
over it. I thought sheâd haâ no sperrit for thâ harvest supper.â

Mrs. Poyser had thought of Dinah several times since Adam had come in, but she
had had âno heartâ to mention the bad news.

âWhat!â said Bartle, with an air of disgust. âWas there a woman concerned? Then
I give you up, Adam.â

âBut itâs a woman youân spoke well on, Bartle,â said Mr. Poyser. âCome now, you
canna draw back; you said once as women wouldna haâ been a bad invention if
theyâd all been like Dinah.â

âI meant her voice, manâI meant her voice, that was all,â said Bartle. âI can
bear to hear her speak without wanting to put wool in my ears. As for other
things, I daresay sheâs like the rest oâ the womenâthinks two and two âll come
to make five, if she cries and bothers enough about it.â

âAye, aye!â said Mrs. Poyser; âone âud think, anâ hear some folks talk, as the
men war âcute enough to count the corns in a bag oâ wheat wiâ only smelling at
it. They can see through a barn-door,
they
can. Perhaps thatâs the
reason they can see so little oâ this side onât.â

Martin Poyser shook with delighted laughter and winked at Adam, as much as to
say the schoolmaster was in for it now.

âAh!â said Bartle sneeringly, âthe women are quick enoughâtheyâre quick enough.
They know the rights of a story before they hear it, and can tell a man what
his thoughts are before he knows âem himself.â

âLike enough,â said Mrs. Poyser, âfor the men are mostly so slow, their
thoughts overrun âem, anâ they can only catch âem by the tail. I can count a
stocking-top while a manâs gettingâs tongue ready anâ when he outs wiâ his
speech at last, thereâs little broth to be made onât. Itâs your dead chicks
take the longest hatchinâ. Howiver, Iâm not denyinâ the women are foolish: God
Almighty made âem to match the men.â

âMatch!â said Bartle. âAye, as vinegar matches oneâs teeth. If a man says a
word, his wife âll match it with a contradiction; if heâs a mind for hot meat,
his wife âll match it with cold bacon; if he laughs, sheâll match him with
whimpering. Sheâs such a match as the horse-fly is to thâ horse: sheâs got the
right venom to sting him withâthe right venom to sting him with.â

âYes,â said Mrs. Poyser, âI know what the men likeâa poor soft, as âud simper
at âem like the picture oâ the sun, whether they did right or wrong, anâ say
thank you for a kick, anâ pretend she didna know which end she stood uppermost,
till her husband told her. Thatâs what a man wants in a wife, mostly; he wants
to make sure oâ one fool as âull tell him heâs wise. But thereâs some men can
do wiâout thatâthey think so much oâ themselves aâready. Anâ thatâs how it is
thereâs old bachelors.â

âCome, Craig,â said Mr. Poyser jocosely, âyou mun get married pretty quick,
else youâll be set down for an old bachelor; anâ you see what the women âull
think on you.â

âWell,â said Mr. Craig, willing to conciliate Mrs. Poyser and setting a high
value on his own compliments, â
I
like a cleverish womanâa woman oâ
sperritâa managing woman.â

âYouâre out there, Craig,â said Bartle, dryly; âyouâre out there. You judge oâ
your garden-stuff on a better plan than that. You pick the things for what they
can excel inâfor what they can excel in. You donât value your peas for their
roots, or your carrots for their flowers. Now, thatâs the way you should choose
women. Their cleverness âll never come to muchânever come to muchâbut they make
excellent simpletons, ripe and strong-flavoured.â

âWhat dost say to that?â said Mr. Poyser, throwing himself back and looking
merrily at his wife.

âSay!â answered Mrs. Poyser, with dangerous fire kindling in her eye. âWhy, I
say as some folksâ tongues are like the clocks as run on strikinâ, not to tell
you the time oâ the day, but because thereâs summat wrong iâ their own
inside...â

Mrs. Poyser would probably have brought her rejoinder to a further climax, if
every oneâs attention had not at this moment been called to the other end of
the table, where the lyricism, which had at first only manifested itself by
Davidâs
sotto voce
performance of âMy loveâs a rose without a thorn,â
had gradually assumed a rather deafening and complex character. Tim, thinking
slightly of Davidâs vocalization, was impelled to supersede that feeble buzz by
a spirited commencement of âThree Merry Mowers,â but David was not to be put
down so easily, and showed himself capable of a copious crescendo, which was
rendering it doubtful whether the rose would not predominate over the mowers,
when old Kester, with an entirely unmoved and immovable aspect, suddenly set up
a quavering trebleâas if he had been an alarum, and the time was come for him
to go off.

The company at Alickâs end of the table took this form of vocal entertainment
very much as a matter of course, being free from musical prejudices; but Bartle
Massey laid down his pipe and put his fingers in his ears; and Adam, who had
been longing to go ever since he had heard Dinah was not in the house, rose and
said he must bid good-night.

âIâll go with you, lad,â said Bartle; âIâll go with you before my ears are
split.â

âIâll go round by the Common and see you home, if you like, Mr. Massey,â said
Adam.

âAye, aye!â said Bartle; âthen we can have a bit oâ talk together. I never get
hold of you now.â

âEh! Itâs a pity but youâd sit it out,â said Martin Poyser. âTheyâll all go
soon, for thâ missis niver lets âem stay past ten.â

But Adam was resolute, so the good-nights were said, and the two friends turned
out on their starlight walk together.

âThereâs that poor fool, Vixen, whimpering for me at home,â said Bartle. âI can
never bring her here with me for fear she should be struck with Mrs. Poyserâs
eye, and the poor bitch might go limping for ever after.â

âIâve never any need to drive Gyp back,â said Adam, laughing. âHe always turns
back of his own head when he finds out Iâm coming here.â

âAye, aye,â said Bartle. âA terrible woman!âmade of needles, made of needles.
But I stick to MartinâI shall always stick to Martin. And he likes the needles,
God help him! Heâs a cushion made on purpose for âem.â

âBut sheâs a downright good-naturâd woman, for all that,â said Adam, âand as
true as the daylight. Sheâs a bit cross wiâ the dogs when they offer to come in
thâ house, but if they depended on her, sheâd take care and have âem well fed.
If her tongueâs keen, her heartâs tender: Iâve seen that in times oâ trouble.
Sheâs one oâ those women as are better than their word.â

âWell, well,â said Bartle, âI donât say thâ apple isnât sound at the core; but
it sets my teeth on edgeâit sets my teeth on edge.â

Chapter LIV

The Meeting on the Hill

Adam understood Dinahâs haste to go away, and drew hope rather than
discouragement from it. She was fearful lest the strength of her feeling
towards him should hinder her from waiting and listening faithfully for the
ultimate guiding voice from within.

âI wish Iâd asked her to write to me, though,â he thought. âAnd yet even that
might disturb her a bit, perhaps. She wants to be quite quiet in her old way
for a while. And Iâve no right to be impatient and interrupting her with my
wishes. Sheâs told me what her mind is, and sheâs not a woman to say one thing
and mean another. Iâll wait patiently.â

That was Adamâs wise resolution, and it throve excellently for the first two or
three weeks on the nourishment it got from the remembrance of Dinahâs
confession that Sunday afternoon. There is a wonderful amount of sustenance in
the first few words of love. But towards the middle of October the resolution
began to dwindle perceptibly, and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion. The
weeks were unusually long: Dinah must surely have had more than enough time to
make up her mind. Let a woman say what she will after she has once told a man
that she loves him, he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first
draught she offers him to care much about the taste of the second. He treads
the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her, and makes light
of all difficulties. But that sort of glow dies out: memory gets sadly diluted
with time, and is not strong enough to revive us. Adam was no longer so
confident as he had been. He began to fear that perhaps Dinahâs old life would
have too strong a grasp upon her for any new feeling to triumph. If she had not
felt this, she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort; but
it appeared that she held it right to discourage him. As Adamâs confidence
waned, his patience waned with it, and he thought he must write himself. He
must ask Dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful. He
sat up late one night to write her a letter, but the next morning he burnt it,
afraid of its effect. It would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter
than from her own lips, for her presence reconciled him to her will.

You perceive how it was: Adam was hungering for the sight of Dinah, and when
that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage, a lover is likely to still it
though he may have to put his future in pawn.

But what harm could he do by going to Snowfield? Dinah could not be displeased
with him for it. She had not forbidden him to go. She must surely expect that
he would go before long. By the second Sunday in October this view of the case
had become so clear to Adam that he was already on his way to Snowfield, on
horseback this time, for his hours were precious now, and he had borrowed
Jonathan Burgeâs good nag for the journey.

What keen memories went along the road with him! He had often been to Oakbourne
and back since that first journey to Snowfield, but beyond Oakbourne the
greystone walls, the broken country, the meagre trees, seemed to be telling him
afresh the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart. But no
story is the same to us after a lapse of timeâor rather, we who read it are no
longer the same interpretersâand Adam this morning brought with him new
thoughts through that grey country, thoughts which gave an altered significance
to its story of the past.

That is a base and selfish, even a blasphemous, spirit which rejoices and is
thankful over the past evil that has blighted or crushed another, because it
has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves. Adam could never cease
to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to
him; he could never thank God for anotherâs misery. And if I were capable of
that narrow-sighted joy in Adamâs behalf, I should still know he was not the
man to feel it for himself. He would have shaken his head at such a sentiment
and said, âEvilâs evil, and sorrowâs sorrow, and you canât alter itâs natur by
wrapping it up in other words. Other folks were not created for my sake, that I
should think all square when things turn out well for me.â

But it is not ignoble to feel that the fuller life which a sad experience has
brought us is worth our own personal share of pain. Surely it is not possible
to feel otherwise, any more than it would be possible for a man with cataract
to regret the painful process by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees
walking had been exchanged for clear outline and effulgent day. The growth of
higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty, bringing with it a
sense of added strength. We can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy
than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner, or a
philosopher to his less complete formula.

Something like this sense of enlarged being was in Adamâs mind this Sunday
morning, as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past. His feeling
towards Dinah, the hope of passing his life with her, had been the distant
unseen point towards which that hard journey from Snowfield eighteen months ago
had been leading him. Tender and deep as his love for Hetty had beenâso deep
that the roots of it would never be torn awayâhis love for Dinah was better and
more precious to him, for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had
come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow. âItâs like as if it was a
new strength to me,â he said to himself, âto love her and know as she loves me.
I shall look tâ her to help me to see things right. For sheâs better than I
amâthereâs less oâ self in her, and pride. And itâs a feeling as gives you a
sort oâ liberty, as if you could walk more fearless, when youâve more trust in
another than yâ have in yourself. Iâve always been thinking I knew better than
them as belonged to me, and thatâs a poor sort oâ life, when you canât look to
them nearest to you tâ help you with a bit better thought than what youâve got
inside you aâready.â

It was more than two oâclock in the afternoon when Adam came in sight of the
grey town on the hill-side and looked searchingly towards the green valley
below, for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near the ugly red mill.
The scene looked less harsh in the soft October sunshine than it had in the
eager time of early spring, and the one grand charm it possessed in common with
all wide-stretching woodless regionsâthat it filled you with a new
consciousness of the overarching skyâhad a milder, more soothing influence than
usual, on this almost cloudless day. Adamâs doubts and fears melted under this
influence as the delicate weblike clouds had gradually melted away into the
clear blue above him. He seemed to see Dinahâs gentle face assuring him, with
its looks alone, of all he longed to know.

He did not expect Dinah to be at home at this hour, but he got down from his
horse and tied it at the little gate, that he might ask where she was gone
to-day. He had set his mind on following her and bringing her home. She was
gone to Slomanâs End, a hamlet about three miles off, over the hill, the old
woman told himâhad set off directly after morning chapel, to preach in a
cottage there, as her habit was. Anybody at the town would tell him the way to
Slomanâs End. So Adam got on his horse again and rode to the town, putting up
at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner there in the company of the too chatty
landlord, from whose friendly questions and reminiscences he was glad to escape
as soon as possible and set out towards Slomanâs End. With all his haste it was
nearly four oâclock before he could set off, and he thought that as Dinah had
gone so early, she would perhaps already be near returning. The little, grey,
desolate-looking hamlet, unscreened by sheltering trees, lay in sight long
before he reached it, and as he came near he could hear the sound of voices
singing a hymn. âPerhaps thatâs the last hymn before they come away,â Adam
thought. âIâll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her, farther off the
village.â He walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again, and
seated himself on a loose stone, against the low wall, to watch till he should
see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill. He
chose this spot, almost at the top of the hill, because it was away from all
eyesâno house, no cattle, not even a nibbling sheep nearâno presence but the
still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky.

She was much longer coming than he expected. He waited an hour at least
watching for her and thinking of her, while the afternoon shadows lengthened
and the light grew softer. At last he saw the little black figure coming from
between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill. Slowly,
Adam thought, but Dinah was really walking at her usual pace, with a light
quiet step. Now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill, but Adam
would not move yet; he would not meet her too soon; he had set his heart on
meeting her in this assured loneliness. And now he began to fear lest he should
startle her too much. âYet,â he thought, âsheâs not one to be overstartled;
sheâs always so calm and quiet, as if she was prepared for anything.â

What was she thinking of as she wound up the hill? Perhaps she had found
complete repose without him, and had ceased to feel any need of his love. On
the verge of a decision we all tremble: hope pauses with fluttering wings.

But now at last she was very near, and Adam rose from the stone wall. It
happened that just as he walked forward, Dinah had paused and turned round to
look back at the villageâwho does not pause and look back in mounting a hill?
Adam was glad, for, with the fine instinct of a lover, he felt that it would be
best for her to hear his voice before she saw him. He came within three paces
of her and then said, âDinah!â She started without looking round, as if she
connected the sound with no place. âDinah!â Adam said again. He knew quite well
what was in her mind. She was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely
spiritual monitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of
the voice.

But this second time she looked round. What a look of yearning love it was that
the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark-eyed man! She did not start again
at the sight of him; she said nothing, but moved towards him so that his arm
could clasp her round.

And they walked on so in silence, while the warm tears fell. Adam was content,
and said nothing. It was Dinah who spoke first.

âAdam,â she said, âit is the Divine Will. My soul is so knit to yours that it
is but a divided life I live without you. And this moment, now you are with me,
and I feel that our hearts are filled with the same love. I have a fulness of
strength to bear and do our heavenly Fatherâs Will that I had lost before.â

Adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes.

âThen weâll never part any more, Dinah, till death parts us.â

And they kissed each other with a deep joy.

What greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel that they are
joined for lifeâto strengthen each other in all labour, to rest on each other
in all sorrow, to minister to each other in all pain, to be one with each other
in silent unspeakable memories at the moment of the last parting?

Chapter LV

Marriage Bells

In little more than a month after that meeting on the hillâon a rimy morning in
departing NovemberâAdam and Dinah were married.

It was an event much thought of in the village. All Mr. Burgeâs men had a
holiday, and all Mr. Poyserâs, and most of those who had a holiday appeared in
their best clothes at the wedding. I think there was hardly an inhabitant of
Hayslope specially mentioned in this history and still resident in the parish
on this November morning who was not either in church to see Adam and Dinah
married, or near the church door to greet them as they came forth. Mrs. Irwine
and her daughters were waiting at the churchyard gates in their carriage (for
they had a carriage now) to shake hands with the bride and bridegroom and wish
them well; and in the absence of Miss Lydia Donnithorne at Bath, Mrs. Best, Mr.
Mills, and Mr. Craig had felt it incumbent on them to represent âthe familyâ at
the Chase on the occasion. The churchyard walk was quite lined with familiar
faces, many of them faces that had first looked at Dinah when she preached on
the Green. And no wonder they showed this eager interest on her marriage
morning, for nothing like Dinah and the history which had brought her and Adam
Bede together had been known at Hayslope within the memory of man.

Bessy Cranage, in her neatest cap and frock, was crying, though she did not
exactly know why; for, as her cousin Wiry Ben, who stood near her, judiciously
suggested, Dinah was not going away, and if Bessy was in low spirits, the best
thing for her to do was to follow Dinahâs example and marry an honest fellow
who was ready to have her. Next to Bessy, just within the church door, there
were the Poyser children, peeping round the corner of the pews to get a sight
of the mysterious ceremony; Tottyâs face wearing an unusual air of anxiety at
the idea of seeing cousin Dinah come back looking rather old, for in Tottyâs
experience no married people were young.

I envy them all the sight they had when the marriage was fairly ended and Adam
led Dinah out of church. She was not in black this morning, for her Aunt Poyser
would by no means allow such a risk of incurring bad luck, and had herself made
a present of the wedding dress, made all of grey, though in the usual Quaker
form, for on this point Dinah could not give way. So the lily face looked out
with sweet gravity from under a grey Quaker bonnet, neither smiling nor
blushing, but with lips trembling a little under the weight of solemn feelings.
Adam, as he pressed her arm to his side, walked with his old erectness and his
head thrown rather backward as if to face all the world better. But it was not
because he was particularly proud this morning, as is the wont of bridegrooms,
for his happiness was of a kind that had little reference to menâs opinion of
it. There was a tinge of sadness in his deep joy; Dinah knew it, and did not
feel aggrieved.

There were three other couples, following the bride and bridegroom: first,
Martin Poyser, looking as cheery as a bright fire on this rimy morning, led
quiet Mary Burge, the bridesmaid; then came Seth serenely happy, with Mrs.
Poyser on his arm; and last of all Bartle Massey, with LisbethâLisbeth in a new
gown and bonnet, too busy with her pride in her son and her delight in
possessing the one daughter she had desired to devise a single pretext for
complaint.

Bartle Massey had consented to attend the wedding at Adamâs earnest request,
under protest against marriage in general and the marriage of a sensible man in
particular. Nevertheless, Mr. Poyser had a joke against him after the wedding
dinner, to the effect that in the vestry he had given the bride one more kiss
than was necessary.

Behind this last couple came Mr. Irwine, glad at heart over this good morningâs
work of joining Adam and Dinah. For he had seen Adam in the worst moments of
his sorrow; and what better harvest from that painful seed-time could there be
than this? The love that had brought hope and comfort in the hour of despair,
the love that had found its way to the dark prison cell and to poor Hettyâs
darker soulâthis strong gentle love was to be Adamâs companion and helper till
death.

There was much shaking of hands mingled with âGod bless youâsâ and other good
wishes to the four couples, at the churchyard gate, Mr. Poyser answering for
the rest with unwonted vivacity of tongue, for he had all the appropriate
wedding-day jokes at his command. And the women, he observed, could never do
anything but put finger in eye at a wedding. Even Mrs. Poyser could not trust
herself to speak as the neighbours shook hands with her, and Lisbeth began to
cry in the face of the very first person who told her she was getting young
again.

Mr. Joshua Rann, having a slight touch of rheumatism, did not join in the
ringing of the bells this morning, and, looking on with some contempt at these
informal greetings which required no official co-operation from the clerk,
began to hum in his musical bass, âOh what a joyful thing it is,â by way of
preluding a little to the effect he intended to produce in the wedding psalm
next Sunday.

âThatâs a bit of good news to cheer Arthur,â said Mr. Irwine to his mother, as
they drove off. âI shall write to him the first thing when we get home.â

Epilogue

It is near the end of June, in 1807. The workshops have been shut up half an
hour or more in Adam Bedeâs timber-yard, which used to be Jonathan Burgeâs, and
the mellow evening light is falling on the pleasant house with the buff walls
and the soft grey thatch, very much as it did when we saw Adam bringing in the
keys on that June evening nine years ago.

There is a figure we know well, just come out of the house, and shading her
eyes with her hands as she looks for something in the distance, for the rays
that fall on her white borderless cap and her pale auburn hair are very
dazzling. But now she turns away from the sunlight and looks towards the door.

We can see the sweet pale face quite well now: it is scarcely at all
alteredâonly a little fuller, to correspond to her more matronly figure, which
still seems light and active enough in the plain black dress.

âI see him, Seth,â Dinah said, as she looked into the house. âLet us go and
meet him. Come, Lisbeth, come with Mother.â

The last call was answered immediately by a small fair creature with pale
auburn hair and grey eyes, little more than four years old, who ran out
silently and put her hand into her motherâs.

âCome, Uncle Seth,â said Dinah.

âAye, aye, weâre coming,â Seth answered from within, and presently appeared
stooping under the doorway, being taller than usual by the black head of a
sturdy two-year-old nephew, who had caused some delay by demanding to be
carried on uncleâs shoulder.

âBetter take him on thy arm, Seth,â said Dinah, looking fondly at the stout
black-eyed fellow. âHeâs troublesome to thee so.â

âNay, nay: Addy likes a ride on my shoulder. I can carry him so for a bit.â A
kindness which young Addy acknowledged by drumming his heels with promising
force against Uncle Sethâs chest. But to walk by Dinahâs side, and be
tyrannized over by Dinahâs and Adamâs children, was Uncle Sethâs earthly
happiness.

âWhere didst see him?â asked Seth, as they walked on into the adjoining field.
âI canât catch sight of him anywhere.â

âBetween the hedges by the roadside,â said Dinah. âI saw his hat and his
shoulder. There he is again.â

âTrust thee for catching sight of him if heâs anywhere to be seen,â said Seth,
smiling. âTheeât like poor mother used to be. She was always on the look out
for Adam, and could see him sooner than other folks, for all her eyes got dim.â

âHeâs been longer than he expected,â said Dinah, taking Arthurâs watch from a
small side pocket and looking at it; âitâs nigh upon seven now.â

âAye, theyâd have a deal to say to one another,â said Seth, âand the meeting
âud touch âem both pretty closish. Why, itâs getting on towards eight years
since they parted.â

âYes,â said Dinah, âAdam was greatly moved this morning at the thought of the
change he should see in the poor young man, from the sickness he has undergone,
as well as the years which have changed us all. And the death of the poor
wanderer, when she was coming back to us, has been sorrow upon sorrow.â

âSee, Addy,â said Seth, lowering the young one to his arm now and pointing,
âthereâs Father comingâat the far stile.â

Dinah hastened her steps, and little Lisbeth ran on at her utmost speed till
she clasped her fatherâs leg. Adam patted her head and lifted her up to kiss
her, but Dinah could see the marks of agitation on his face as she approached
him, and he put her arm within his in silence.

âWell, youngster, must I take you?â he said, trying to smile, when Addy
stretched out his armsâready, with the usual baseness of infancy, to give up
his Uncle Seth at once, now there was some rarer patronage at hand.

âItâs cut me a good deal, Dinah,â Adam said at last, when they were walking on.

âDidst find him greatly altered?â said Dinah.

âWhy, heâs altered and yet not altered. I should haâ known him anywhere. But
his colourâs changed, and he looks sadly. However, the doctors say heâll soon
be set right in his own country air. Heâs all sound in thâ inside; itâs only
the fever shattered him so. But he speaks just the same, and smiles at me just
as he did when he was a lad. Itâs wonderful how heâs always had just the same
sort oâ look when he smiles.â

âIâve never seen him smile, poor young man,â said Dinah.

âBut thee
wilt
see him smile, to-morrow,â said Adam. âHe asked after
thee the first thing when he began to come round, and we could talk to one
another. âI hope she isnât altered,â he said, âI remember her face so well.â I
told him âno,ââ Adam continued, looking fondly at the eyes that were turned
towards his, âonly a bit plumper, as theeâdst a right to be after seven year.
âI may come and see her to-morrow, maynât I?â he said; âI long to tell her how
Iâve thought of her all these years.ââ

âDidst tell him Iâd always used the watch?â said Dinah.

âAye; and we talked a deal about thee, for he says he never saw a woman a bit
like thee. âI shall turn Methodist some day,â he said, âwhen she preaches out
of doors, and go to hear her.â And I said, âNay, sir, you canât do that, for
Conference has forbid the women preaching, and sheâs given it up, all but
talking to the people a bit in their houses.ââ

âAh,â said Seth, who could not repress a comment on this point, âand a sore
pity it was oâ Conference; and if Dinah had seen as I did, weâd haâ left the
Wesleyans and joined a body that âud put no bonds on Christian liberty.â

âNay, lad, nay,â said Adam, âshe was right and thee wast wrong. Thereâs no
rules so wise but what itâs a pity for somebody or other. Most oâ the women do
more harm nor good with their preachingâtheyâve not got Dinahâs gift nor her
sperritâand sheâs seen that, and she thought it right to set thâ example oâ
submitting, for sheâs not held from other sorts oâ teaching. And I agree with
her, and approve oâ what she did.â

Seth was silent. This was a standing subject of difference rarely alluded to,
and Dinah, wishing to quit it at once, said, âDidst remember, Adam, to speak to
Colonel Donnithorne the words my uncle and aunt entrusted to thee?â

âYes, and heâs going to the Hall Farm with Mr. Irwine the day after to-morrow.
Mr. Irwine came in while we were talking about it, and he would have it as the
Colonel must see nobody but thee to-morrow. He saidâand heâs in the right of
itâas itâll be bad for him tâ have his feelings stirred with seeing many people
one after another. âWe must get you strong and hearty,â he said, âthatâs the
first thing to be done Arthur, and then you shall have your own way. But I
shall keep you under your old tutorâs thumb till then.â Mr. Irwineâs fine and
joyful at having him home again.â

Adam was silent a little while, and then said, âIt was very cutting when we
first saw one another. Heâd never heard about poor Hetty till Mr. Irwine met
him in London, for the letters missed him on his journey. The first thing he
said to me, when weâd got hold oâ one anotherâs hands was, âI could never do
anything for her, Adamâshe lived long enough for all the sufferingâand Iâd
thought so of the time when I might do something for her. But you told me the
truth when you said to me once, âThereâs a sort of wrong that can never be made
up for.âââ

âWhy, thereâs Mr. and Mrs. Poyser coming in at the yard gate,â said Seth.

âSo there is,â said Dinah. âRun, Lisbeth, run to meet Aunt Poyser. Come in,
Adam, and rest; it has been a hard day for thee.â

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

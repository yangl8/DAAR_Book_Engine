EDITOR'S NOTE

Cockney humour smacks, of course, of the town and makes up in smartness
and shrewdness what it lacks in mellowness. The Cockney is as a rule a
conscious humorist; you laugh
with
him very often, whereas you nearly
always laugh
at
the rustic humorist.

George Du Maurier concerned himself a good deal with Cockney character,
but he was not in sympathy with the Cockney; generally he had an obvious
contempt for him, and most of his jokes turn on the dropped H, the
mispronounced word, and educational deficiencies. He portrays some of
the Cockney's superficial characteristics; he despises him too much to
be able to get at the heart of him and reveal his character.

Take Phil May's pictures and jokes, and the difference is at once
apparent. He was fully alive to the Cockney's deficiencies of manner and
culture; now and then he quite genially and without the least touch of
scorn or self-complacency makes fun of them; but he really gives you the
Cockney character. Take, for instance, such a picture as his "Politics
and Gallantry," his "I say, 'Arry, don't we look frights!" his "Informal
Introduction"—(the self-consciousness of the girl's expression, and the
blatant pride of the man's)—here, and in almost any of his drawings you
turn to, you have the absolutely natural Cockney; his types are full of
character and so true and free from condescension that not only are we
moved irresistibly to laugh at them, but the Cockney himself would be
the first to recognise their truth and to laugh joyously at them too. We
may say pretty much the same of Charles Keene, of Mr. Raven-Hill, of Mr.
Bernard Partridge, and of others of the "Punch" artists represented
here, who illustrate the essential Cockney character, and do not go on
the easy assumption that dropped H's and mispronounced words and
aggressive vulgarity are the beginning and the end of it.

NOTE BY A COCKNEY NATURALIST

The common blackbeetles (
ScarabÃ¦us niger
) which so abundantly infest
the culinary regions of Cockaigne are alleged to be agreeable, although
profuse, in flavour, provided they be delicately larded before crimping,
and then fricasseed or simply fried. Care should specially be taken not
to injure their antennÃ¦, which, when crisp with egg and breadcrumbs,
exquisitely tickle the palate of the gourmet, and provoke him to the
liveliest of gastronomic feats. There lurks in vulgar minds a savage
prejudice against these interesting insects, by reason, very likely, of
the popular impression that at times they have been manufactured into
Soy. But this may be assumed to be mere idle superstition, and Soyer,
the great
chef
, wisely set his face against it, remarking, as he did
so, "
Honi Soy qui mal y pense.
"

Among the warblers which abound in the vicinity of the metropolis, one
of the most interesting is the little mudlark (
Alauda Greenwichiensis
)
whose plaintive cry may nightly be
[Pg 12]
heard upon the shore of the river,
where these little creatures congregate in flocks, and pick up any grub
which they may chance to meet with.

Doubts have been entertained by sundry Cockney naturalists whether the
pyramids of oyster shells, which in the early part of August used to be
noticed in the streets, should be regarded as a proof of the migratory
habits of the mollusc. That the oyster is a sluggard and objects to
leave his bed seems pretty generally admitted; but that he is endowed
with the power of locomotion has, fortunately for science, been placed
beyond a doubt. Whether oysters shed their shells when they are crossed
in love is a point on which the naturalist is still somewhat in the
dark.

Self-evident.
—It must have been a cockney who said that St. Bees came
from St. 'Ives.

A Dead Letter.
—Too often H.

'Arry.
"Ain't ye comin' to see the 'orse run for yer money?"

Cholley.
"Not me! No bloomin' fear! I'm goin' to see this cove don't

with
my money!"

[Pg 14]

ROYAL ALBERT HALL TO DAY

"I 'ear this 'ere Patti ain't
'arf
bad!"

[Pg 15]

"Would you gentlemen like to look at the old church?"

"Ho, yus. We're
nuts
on old churches!"

[Pg 16]

Quoth an eminent literary man, in the hearing of 'Arry, "All George
Meredith's poetry might be republished under one title as 'Our
Georgics.'"

"Oo's ''Icks'?" asked 'Arry.

"The Teaching of Erse in Ireland."
—"Well," says 'Arry, "it sounds
uncommon funereal. O' course I knew an erse and plumes and coal black
'osses is what they call a 'moral lesson.' But why make such a fuss
about it in Ireland?"

An Awkward Name.
—'Arry, on a marine excursion, hearing mention made of
the two sea-birds the great auk and the little auk, inquired if the
little auk was a sparrow-'awk.

"He is the greatest liar on (H)earth," as the Cockney said of the
lap-dog he often saw lying before the fire.

[Pg 17]

The Vernacular.

"Yer know that young Germin feller as come ter sty in our 'ouse six
months agow? Well, w'en fust 'e come, I give yer my word'e didn' know
nothink but 'is own lengwidge; but we bin learnin' 'im English, an' now

"Do you sell type?"—"Type, sir? No, sir. This is an ironmonger's.
You'll find type at the linendryper's over the w'y!"

"I don't mean

"Oh,

[Pg 21]

MYOPIA

Little Binks (to unsteady party who had lurched heavily against him).

"I beg your pardon, I'm sure, but I'm very short-sighted——"

Dissipated Stranger.
"Do' mensh't, shir—I've met goo' many shor'

[Pg 22]

Our 'Arry Again!

'Arry
is at a hotel where the boarding system prevails, and sees the
following notice posted on the walls—"Breakfast, 9 a.m."

'Arry (to Waiter).
"Breakfast, and some 'am."

Waiter.
"We've no 'am."

'Arry.
"No 'am!
(Pointing to notice.)
What's that?"

Says one 'Arry to another 'Arry.
"I say, old man, the papers say they
'ope 1882 will be the openin' of a new era. What's that?"

Second 'Arry.
"Openin' of a new 'earer? Why, a telephone, of course,
you juggins!"

A SONG FOR COCKNEY SPORTSMEN

The hart's in the Highlands,

Of that there's no fear,

And 'tis there you may buy lands

For stalking the deer:

But the hills are no trifle,

And they're windy and cold,

So your wish you'd best stifle,

Or buy, and be—sold.

[Pg 23]

GOOD NEWS

'Arry.
"T'aint no good miking a fuss about it, yer know, guv'nor! Me
and my pals must 'ave our 'd'y out'!"

Foreign Fellow-traveller.
"Aha! Die out! You go to die out? Mon Dieu!
I am vairy glad to 'ear it. It is time!"

[Pg 24]

FORCE OF HABIT; OR, CITY SUSPICIONS

'Arry (who is foraging for his camping party).
"Look here, my good
woman, are these cabbages fresh?"

[Pg 25]

Little Dobbs.
"Hullo! what's that? Looks like a mowing
machine."

Hairdresser (who does not appreciate "chaff").
"No, sir, 'tain't a
mowin' machine. It's meant to give gentlemen fresh
h
air."

[Pg 26]

BITING SARCASM

Gentleman with the Broom (who has inadvertently splashed the artist's
favourite shipwreck).
"Ow yus! I suppose yer think ye're the president
o' the Roy'l Acadermy! A settin' there in the lap er luxury!!"

[Pg 27]

FOREIGN COMPETITION

British Habitual Criminal.
"Well, if these 'ere furrin aliens is
a-goin' ter take the bread out of a honest man's mouth—blimey if I
don't turn copper!"

[Pg 28]

Very Appropriate.
—Says 'Arry, "Regular good place for a medical man to
live in is 'Ill Street, Berkeley Square. But why don't he cure it and
make it Quite Well Street?"

COMMENT BY A COCKNEY

Bad-Gastein! Sounds more fit than nice, and yet

They say most healing waters there are had.

Strange, though, that people fancy good to get

By going to the Bad!

'Arriet read from a daily paper, "Navigation in the Ouse." "I s'pose,"
said 'Arry, "as the members are goin' to 'ave a 'ouse-boat this season.
Which 'ouse? Hupper or lower? Whichever's to steer? The Speaker or Lord
'Igh Chancellor?"

Two Distinct Classes.
—The aristocracy and the '
Arry
-stocracy.

[Pg 29]

Withering.

'Arry.
"I s'y—does one tip the witers 'ere?"

Alphonse.
"Not onless you are reecher zan ze vaiter, sare!"

THE BLESSED HERITAGE

["Poverty is a blessed heritage."—
Mr. Carnegie.
]

'Ere, Lizer, wheer's yer gratitood? 'E ses, ses Mr. C.,

As it's a blessed 'eritage, is poverty, ses 'e.

Then think 'ow thankful an' 'ow blest we oughter feel, us two,

But yet yer that contrairy that I'm blest, Liz, if yer do.

Wot? 'Ungry? Wot is 'unger? Don't it vary the monotony

An' Wooster sorce yer vittles, that's supposin' as yer've got any?

Then think of them pore millionaires wot misses the delight

Of 'avin' 'ad no breakfast on a roarin' happytite.

Then money! I Think, Elizer, of them cruel stocks and shares

Wot makes their lives a torter to them martyred millionaires

Oh, ain't we much more appy when the sticks is up the spout

An' the kids is wantin' dinner and 'as got ter go without?

And don't it make yer 'eart bleed, too, to think of all the care

Of mansions in the country and an 'ouse in Grosvenor Square?

Ah, what would them pore fellers give if honly they could come

An' live with all their fam'ly in our garret hup the slum?
[Pg 32]

Wot, Liz? Yer'd like ter see 'em come? 'Ere, none o' that theer charf!

Yer'd sell yer bloomin' birthright for a pot of 'arf-an-'arf?

Lor, Liz! Ter think as you should be in sich a thankless mood!

Yer've got a "blessed 'eritage," an' 'ere's yer gratitood!

'Arry Examined.
—
Q.
"What is meant by 'Higher Education'"?

'Arry.
"Getting a tutor at so much a week. That's the way I should
'ire education—if I wanted it."

Why He is Such a Dull Boy.

"'Arry," said an eminent comic singer to his friend, confidentially at
the Oxford, "I'm exclusively engaged at the music 'alls; mayn't perform
in a theatre."

"Then," replied 'Arry, knowingly, "it's all work and no play with you."

The conclusion was so evident that, had it not been for a good deal of
soothing syrup at 'Arry's expense, there might have been a serious
breach of the peace.

[Pg 31]

Toff.
"I say, my boy, would you like to drive me to
Piccadilly?"

Boy.
"I shouldn't mind, old sport, only I don't fink the 'arness would
fit yer!"

[Pg 33]

POOR LETTER H

Tout Contractor (who has been paid a shilling per man, and sees his way
to a little extra profit).
"Now look 'ere, you two H's! The public
don't want yer—nor
I
don't, nor nobody don't; so jist drop them
boards, and then 'ook it!"

[Pg 34]

OBSERVATIONS BY A COCKNEY NATURALIST

A nightingale has been heard singing in Kensington Gardens (
vide
Times
, April 19). A salmon has been seen swimming close to London
Bridge. A trout has been observed (reposing on a marble slab) near to
Charing Cross. Sticklebacks have been captured in the waters of the
Serpentine. Plovers eggs have been discovered in the middle of Covent
Garden: I myself have found there as many as two dozen in a single walk.
There is a rookery in St. Giles's, well known to the police. I have seen
a pigeon shot not far from Shepherd's Bush, and I have heard one has
been plucked by a member of the hawk tribe at another West-End haunt.
Blackbeetles are common in the back kitchens of Belgravia, and
bluebottles abound among the butchers of Whitechapel during the warm
months. There is another kind of fly, which is said to be indigenous to
the stables of the jobmasters, and which also may be seen by
[Pg 36]
observant
Cockney naturalists, but less seldom in Whitechapel than near the
Regent's Park. Sparrow-clubs have not been established yet in London,
but pea-shooters are common in many of its streets. I am told that early
risers may hear a male canary singing in the neighbourhood of Islington
at four o'clock,
A.M.
, and may also hear a cock crow any morning, except
Sunday, between five and six o'clock. The thrush has been observed among
sundry of the children, under medical inspection, in the nurseries and
infant hospitals of town. Little ducks are plentiful in the
salons
of
Tyburnia, and in Bayswater and Brompton there are numbers of great
geese. Welsh rabbits may be seen close to Covent Garden, and wild
turkeys have been noticed even in the Strand, hanging by the beak. In
the purlieus of St. Stephen's, where are the sacred haunts of the
collective wisdom of the kingdom, I have heard the hootings of many an
old owl. From information which I have received from members of the
metropolitan police, I may assert that larks are common in the
Haymarket, and that on the shores of the silver Thames at Wapping there
is frequently observable a
[Pg 38]
goodly flock of mudlarks. From similar
information, I may add that there are careful observers in the streets
who rarely pass a day without their setting their eyes upon a robbin'.
Who shall say that in the very midst of the metropolis there is not
abundant evidence of a truly rural, and a tooral-looral life?

Night-Birds that make West-End Night Hideous.

his larks.

Charade for Costermongers.
—My first is unfathomable, my second
odoriferous, and my whole is a people of Africa.—

Consolation for Cockneys.
—It is all very well to talk of the fine
boulevards of Paris; but in the French metropolis, where the rent is so
high, and the living so dear, there is not one street to be named with
Cheapside.

MISTAKES ABOUT SCOTLAND

(Contributed by a Converted Cockney)

It is a mistake to believe that every Scotchman, when he goes to
Edinburgh, immediately walks down Princes Street clad in the ancient
costume of the Highlanders.

It is a mistake to believe that the
piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance
at every
Scotch dinner-party is a haggis.

It is a mistake to believe that a Scotchman does not enjoy a joke every
bit as much as an Englishman.

It is a mistake to believe that a Scotch Sabbath in the country is a
whit more
triste
than an English Sunday in the provinces.

It is a mistake to believe that a Scotchman sets a greater value upon
his "bawbee" than an Englishman upon his shilling or an American upon
his dollar.

It is a mistake to believe that inns in Scotland are dearer and less
comfortable than hotels in England.

It is a mistake to believe that we have a city in
[Pg 42]
England that can
compare favourably (from an architectural point of view) with the town
of Edinburgh.

It is a mistake to believe that it always rains in the Isle of Skye.

It is a mistake to believe that there are no more "Fair Maids" in the
houses of Perth.

It is a mistake to believe that Hampstead Heath is as beautiful as
Dunkeld.

It is a mistake to believe that the Caledonian Canal is at all like the
Serpentine.

It is a mistake to believe that Aberdeen is less imposing in appearance
than Chelsea or Islington.

It is a mistake to believe that the countrymen of Scott and Burns do not
appreciate the works of Shakspeare, Milton, Byron, Dickens, Thackeray,
and Tennyson.

And, lastly (this is added to the Cockney's list by the wisest sage of
this or any other age), it is the greatest mistake of all to believe
that
Mr. Punch
does not like and respect (in spite of an occasional
joke at their expense) the kindly, homely, sound-hearted people who live
north of the Tweed.

A COCKNEY RHAPSODY

[A critic in the
Daily News
accuses artists generally of
ignorance in their treatment of rural subjects, and declares that
nearly every picture of work in the hay or harvest field is
incorrect.]

Come revel with me in the country's delights,

Its rapturous pleasures, its marvellous sights;

No landscape of common or garden I praise,

But Nature's strange charms that the painter pourtrays.

No summer begins there, and spring never ends,

It mingles with autumn, with winter it blends;

Its primroses bloom when the barley is ripe,

Amid its red apples the nightingales pipe.

There often the shadow falls southward at noon,

And sunrise is hailed by the pale crescent moon,

The sun sets at will in the east or the west,

In the grove where the cuckoo is building her nest.

There the milkmaid sits down to the left of the cow,

In harvest they sow, and in haytime they plough;

While mowers, in attitudes gladsome and blythe,

Impossible antics perform with the scythe.

There huntsmen in June after foxes may roam,

And horses unbridled go champing with foam;

From torrents by winter fierce swollen and high,

The proud salmon leaps in pursuit of the fly.

Ah Nature! it's little—I own for my part—

I know of your face save as mirrored in art;

Yet, vainly shall critics begrudge me that charm,

For a fellow can paint without learning to farm.

[Pg 47]

Spells 'Enery without the haitch!"

Scene
—
Exterior of St. James's Hall on a Schumann

'Arry (meeting High-Art Musical Friend, who has come out during an
interval, after assisting at Madame Schumann's magnificent reception).

'Ullo! What's up? What are they at now?

High-Art Friend (consulting programme).
Let me see. They've done "Op.
13." Ah, yes! They've just got to "Op. 44."

'Arry (astounded).
'Op forty-four! St. James's 'All got a dancin'

it, a waltz or a polka?

THE COMPLAINT OF THE COCKNEY CLERK

"I know of no cure but for the Englishman (1) to do his best to
compete in the particulars where the German now excels; (2) to try
to show that, taken all round, he is worth more than the
German."—
Mr. Gladstone on English Clerks and German Competition.

All very fine, O orator illustrious!

But I as soon would be a mole or merman,

As a short-grubbing, horribly industrious,

Linguistic German.

A clerk's a clerk, that is a cove who scribbles

All day, and then goes in for cue, and "jigger,"

And not a mere machine who feeds by nibbles,

Slaves like a nigger.

Learn languages? And for two quid a week?

Cut barmaids, billiards, bitter beer and betting?

Yah! that may suit a sausage, or a sneak!

Whistles need wetting.

That is if they are genuine English whistles,

And not dry, hoarse, yah-yah Teutonic throttles.

I
'm not a donkey who can thrive on thistles.

No, that's "no bottles."

I've learned my native tongue,—and that's a teaser—

I've also learned a lot of slang and patter;

But German, French, Italian, Portuguese, sir,

For "screw" no fatter?
[Pg 52]

Not me, my old exuberant wood-chopper!

Level
me
to the straw-haired Carls and Hermanns?

No; there's another trick would do me proper,—

Kick out the Germans!

Old Bismarck's "blood and iron's" a receipt meant

For sour-krautt gobblers, sandy and sardonic!

But for us Britons that Teutonic treatment

Is much too tonic.

The cheek of 'em just puts me in a rage,

Send 'em back home, ah! even pay their passage

Or soon, by Jove, we'll have to call our age,

The German "sauce"-age!

'ARRY IN ROME AND LONDON

A kind correspondent calls
Mr. Punch's
attention to the fact that
'Arry the ubiquitous crops up even in the classics as Arrius, in fact,
in
Carmen
lxxxiv. of Catullus. How proud 'Arry will be to hear of his
classical prototype! Our correspondent "dropping into verse,"
exclaims:—

Yes! Your Cockney is eternal;

Arrius speaks in 'Arry still;

Vaunts 'is "hincome" by paternal

"Hartful" tricks hup 'Olborn 'Ill.

How well he is justified may be seen by a glance at the text of  Catullus:—

DE ARRIO.

"C
h
ommoda" dicebat, si quando commoda vellet

Dicere, et "
h
indsidias" Arrius insidias:

Et tum mirifice sperabat se esse locutum.

Cum, quantum poterat, dixerat "
h
insidias."

Credo, sic mater, sic Liber avunculus ejus.

Sic maternus avus dixerit, atque avia.

Catullus,
Carmen
lxxxiv.

Which—for the benefit of 'Arry himself, who is not perhaps
familiar with the "Lingo Romano"—though he may know something of a
"Romano" dear to certain young sportsmen, though not
[Pg 56]
dearer to
them than other caterers—may thus be
very
freely  adapted:—

'Arry to
H
oxford gives the aspirate still

He cruelly denies to 'Igate 'Ill;

Yet deems in diction he can ape the "swell,"

And "git the 'ang of it" exceeding well.

Doubtless his sire, the 'atter, and his mother,

The hupper 'ousemaid, so addressed each other;

For spite of all that wrangling Board Schools teach,

There seems heredity in Cockney speech.

NOTES BY A COCKNEY NATURALIST

There are various kinds of larks to be observed by Cockney naturalists,
which are more or less, and rather less than more, indigenous to London.
There is first of all the cage lark (
Alauda Miserrima
) which is
chiefly found on grass-plats measuring about two inches square, and may
be heard singing plaintively in many a back slum. Then there is the mud
lark (
Alauda Greenwichiensis
), which is principally seen towards
nightfall on the shores of the river, when the whitebait is in season.
This little lark is a migratory bird, and flits from place to place in
quest of anything worth picking up that may happen to be thrown to it.
Finally, there is the street lark (
Alauda Nocturna
), which is known to
most policemen in the neighbourhood of the Haymarket, and the like
nocturnal haunts.

As a gratifying proof of our progressing civilisation, there has been of
recent years a very marked decrease in the number of white mice, and
[Pg 74]

monkeys dressed as soldiers, exhibited by organ-grinders in the London
streets. Trained dogs appear, however, decidedly more numerous, and
performing canaries may be met with not infrequently in the squares of
the West End. The naturalist should note, moreover, that the learned
British pig (
Porcus Sapiens Britannicus
) which, within the memory of
men who are still living, used commonly to infest the fairs near the
metropolis, has recently well nigh completely disappeared and is
believed by sundry naturalists to be utterly extinct.

The rum shrub (
Shrubbus Curiosus
) which, although deserving of close
investigation has somehow escaped mention in the pages of LinnÃ¦us, is
found in great profusion in the purlieus of Whitechapel, as well as
other parts of London where dram-drinkers do congregate. It may be
generally discovered in proximity to the Pot-tree (
Arbor
Pewteriferens
), which may be readily recognised by its metallic fruit.

The common cat of the metropolis (
Felis Catterwaulans
) is remarkable,
especially for the exceeding frequency and shrillness of its cries when
it goes
[Pg 76]
upon the tiles, or proceeds to other spots of feline popular
resort. Sleep becomes impossible within earshot of its yellings, and the
injury they cause to property as well as human temper is immense. It
has, indeed, been roughly estimated that thirty thousand water-jugs are
annually sacrificed, within a circuit of not more than six miles from
St. Paul's, by being hurled from bedroom windows with the aim to stop
these squalling feline "Voices of the night."

A certain proof that oysters are amphibious may be noted in the fact
that they always build their grottoes in the courts and the back streets
of the metropolis where, in the month of August, with extravagant
profusion, their shells are yearly cast.

The scarlet-coated lobster (
Le Homard Militaire
, Cuvier) has been
frequently discovered on the shores of the Serpentine, or basking by the
margin of the water in St. James's Park. This crustacean, when treated
well, will drink like a fish, excepting that, unlike a fish, he does not
confine himself to water for his drink. His shell (jacket) is of a
bright red colour, which is not
[Pg 78]
produced, as in the lobster species
generally, by the agency of the caloric in the act of being boiled. The
scarlet-coated lobster leads, while in London, a very peaceful life,
notwithstanding his presumed propensities for fighting.

If we may credit the statistics which, with no slight labour, have been
recently collected, no fewer than five million and eleven blue-bottles
are annually slaughtered in the butchers' shops of London, before
depositing their ova in the primest joints of meat. The number of the
smaller flies which, merely in the City, are every year destroyed for
buzzing round the bald heads of irritable bank clerks, amounts, it has
been calculated, to one million three hundred thousand and thirteen.

It is evident that the nation is yearning for singable songs in the
'Arry dialect. The late lamented Artemus Ward would probably have said,
"Let her yearn"; but a stern sense of duty impels me to try and meet the
need, created by the
Daily Chronicle
. I have a comforting impression
that all that is necessary to insure correctness is to "chinge" as many
"a"s as possible into "i"s. By this means I secure the "local
colouring," which, by the way, has undergone a complete change since
Dickens spelt Weller "with a wee, my lord." A catchword, Ã  propos of
nothing, is always useful, so I have duly provided it.

'ARRY ON HIS 'OLIDAY

Being an epistle from that notorious and ubiquitous person, luxuriating
for the time in rural parts, to his chum Charlie, confined in town.

Wha' cheer, my dear Charlie? 'Ow are yer? I promised I'd drop yer a line.

I'm out on the trot for a fortnit; and ain't it golumpshusly fine?

Bin dooing the swell pretty proper, I beg to assure yer, old man.

Jest go it tip-top while you're at it, and blow the expense, is
my
plan.

Bin took for a nob, and no error this time; which my tailor's A 1.

The cut of these bags, sir, beats Poole
out of
fits. (Are yer fly to the pun?)

And this gridiron pattern in treacle and mustard is something uneek,

As the girls—but there, Charlie,
you
know me, and so there's no call for to speak.

My merstach is a coming on proper—that fetches 'em, Charlie, my boy;

Though one on 'em called me young spiky, which doubtless was meant to annoy.

But, bless yer! 'twas only a touch of the green-eyed, 'acos I looked sweet

On a tidy young parcel in pink as 'ung out in the very same street.
[Pg 98]

O Charlie, such larks as I'm 'aving. To toddle about on the sands,

And watch the blue beauties a-bathing, and spot the sick muffs as they lands,

Awful flabby and white in the gills, and with hoptics so sheepishly sad,

And twig 'em go green as we chaff 'em; I tell yer it isn't half bad.

Then, s'rimps! Wy, I pooty near lives on 'em; got arf a pocketful here,

There's a flavour of bird's-eye about 'em; but that's soon took off by the beer.

The "bitter" round here is jest lummy, and as for their soda-and-b.,

It's ekal to "fizz" and no error, and suits this small child to a t.

The weeds as I've blown is a caution;—I'm nuts on a tuppenny smoke.

Don't care for the baths, but there's sailing, and rollicking rides on a moke.

I've sung comic songs on the cliffs after dark, and wot's fun if that ain't?

And I've chiselled my name in a church on the cheek of a rummy stone saint.

So, Charlie, I think you will see, I've been doing the tourist to rights.

Good grub and prime larks in the daytime, and billiards and bitter at nights;

That's wot
I
calls 'oliday-making, my pippin. I wish
you
was here,

Jest wouldn't we go it extensive! But now I am off for the pier.

You'll observe there's a hangel in muslin a twisting 'erself all awry,

With some plums, happle-blossoms, and marigolds, backed by a dab o' blue sky.

Dekkyrative it's called, so the mivvy informed me who nobbled my tanner;

I
call it a little bit mixed, like the art on a Odd-Fellow's banner.

But, bless you, it's all of a piece, Charlie—life is so muddled with rot

That it takes rayther more than a judge or a jury to tell yer wot's wot.

Whether knifing a boy 'cos one's peckish means murder if lyings are libels,

Seem questions as bothers the big wigs, in spite of their blue books and Bibles.

Where are we, old pal? that's the question. Perhaps it would add to one's ease

If life wos declared a "mixed wobble," it's motter a "go as you please."
[Pg 108]

But 'tisn't all cinder-path, Charlie, wus luck! if it was, with "all in,"

You wouldn't go fur wrong, I fancy, in backing "yours truly" to win.

"A 'Appy New Year!" That's the cackle all over the shop like to-day.

Wot's 'Appiness? Praps Mister Ruskin and little Lord Garmoyle will say.

You an' me's got
our
notions of yum-yum, as isn't fur wide o' the mark,

But who'll give us change for 'em, Charlie? Ah! that's where we're left in the dark.

The Reform Bill won't do it, my pippin, on that you may lay your last dollar.

The fact is this 'Appy New Year fake is 'oller, mate, hutterly 'oller.

'Twon't fly—like the Christmas card hangels, it doesn't fit into the facks;

All it does is to spread tommy-rot, and to break all the postmen's poor backs.

You'll be thinking I've got the blue-mouldies, old man, and you won't be fur hout.

Funds low with yours truly, my bloater, no chances of getting about.

Larks, any amount of 'em, going, advertisements gassing like fun,

But 'Arry, for once in the way, 's a stone-broker and not in the run.
[Pg 110]

It's cutting, that's wot it is,
cutting
. I'm so used to leading the field,

That place as fust-fly at life's fences is one as I
don't
like to yield,

Espechly to one like Bill Blossit—no style, not a bit about Bill!

And they talk of a 'Appy New Year, mate, and cackle o' peace and goodwill!

Oh yus, I'd goodwill 'em, Bill Blossit and false Fanny Friswell, a lot!

They are off to the world's fair to-night, sir, and
that's
wy I say it's such rot.

If form such as mine's to go 'obbling whilst mugginses win out o' sight,

I say the world's handicap's wrong, mate, and Christmas cards won't set it right.

Lor bless yer, 'e ain't got no patter, not more than a nutmeg, Bill ain't;

But the railway has taken his shop, and he's come out as fresh as new paint.

And so because
I'm
out of luck, and that duffer has landed the chink,

She 'ooks onto him
like
a bat to a belfry, sir! What do
you
think?

A 'Appy New Year? Yus, it looks like it! Charlie, old chap, I've heard tell

Of parties called pessymists, writers as swear the whole world's a big sell;

No doubt they've bin jilted, or jockeyed by some such a juggins as Bill;

And without real jam—cash and kisses—this world is a bitterish pill.
[Pg 112]

Still, I wish you a 'Appy New Year, if you care for the kibosh, old chappie,

Though 'taint 'igh art cards full o' gush and green paint'll make you and me 'appy.

Wot
we
want is lucre and larks, love and lotion as much as you'll carry!

Give me them, and one slap at that Bill,—They're the new year gifts to suit.

'ARRY ON THE MERRY MONTH OF MAY

Dear Charlie,

'Ow are yer, old Turmuts? Gone mouldy, or moon-struck, or wot?

Sticking down in the country, like you do, I tell yer, is all tommy-rot.

Its town makes a man of one, Charlie, as me and the nobs 'as found out,

And a snide 'un like you should be fly to it. Carn't fancy wot you're about.

Old Ruskin, I know, sez quite t'other, but then
he
is clean off his chump.

Where's the
life
in long lanes, with no gas-lamps? Their smell always give me the 'ump.

Come hout on it, mate, it'll spile yer. It's May, and the season's begun,

All the toffs is in town—ah! you trust 'em!
they
know where to drop on the fun.

Don't ketch
them
a-Maying, my pippin, like bloomin' old Jacks-in-the-Green,

A-sloppin' about in damp medders, with never a pub to be seen.

No fear! We've primroses in tons—thanks to Beakey—for them as can pay.

And other larks as
is
larks, mate, they know meet in London in May.
[Pg 120]

It is all very well, on a Sunday, for just arf a dozen or so

To take a chay-cart down to Epsom, and cut down the may as yer go.

I've 'ad 'igh old times on that lay, Charlie, gals, don't yer know, and all that,

Returning at dusk with the beer on, and may branches all round yer 'at.

With plenty of tuppenny smokes and 'am san'wiches, Charlie, old man,

And a bit of good goods in pink musling, it ain't arf a bad sort o' plan.

Concertina, in course, and tin whistle, to give 'em a rouser all round,

And "chorus," all over the shop, till the winders 'll shake at the sound.

That's "May, merry May," if yer like, mate, and does your's ancetrar a treat.

But the rural's a dose as wants mixing, it won't do to swaller it neat;

That's wy the Haristos and 'Arry, and all as is fly to wot's wot,

Likes passing the season in London, in spite of yer poetry rot.

Country's all jolly fine in the autumn, with plenty of killing about—

Day's rabbitin's not a bad barney, and gull-potting's lummy, no doubt;

But green fields with nothink to slorter, no pubs, no theaytres, no gas!—

No, no, it won't wash, and the muggins as tells yer it will is a hass.
[Pg 122]

But May in "the village," my biffin, the mighty metrolopus,—ah!

That's paradise, sir, and no kid, with a dash of the true lah-di-dah.

Covent Garden licks Eden, I reckon, at least it'll do
me
A 1;

Button-'oler and Bond Street, old pal, that's yer fair top-row sarmple for fun!

Wy, we git all the best of the country in London, with dollups chucked in.

Rush in herby!
—ascuse the Hitalian!—Ah, mate, ony wish I'd the tin;

I'd take 'em a trot, and no flounders! It's 'ard, bloomin' 'ard, my dear boy,

When form as is form ain't no fling, as a German ud say,
fo der quoy.

I
'd make Mister Ruskin sit up, and the rest of the 'owlers see snakes,

With their rot about old Mother Nature, as
never
don't make no mistakes.

Yah! Nature's a fraud and a fizzle, that is if yer can't fake her out

With the taste of a man about town, ony sort as knows wot he 's about.

Well, London's all yum-yum jest now. Hexhibitions all hover the shop,

I tell yer it keeps one a-movin'.
I
'm on the perpetual 'op,

Like the prince. Aitch har aitch
is
a stayer, a fair royal Rowell, I say.

(I landed a quid on
that
"Mix," but I carnt git the beggar to pay.)
[Pg 124]

"Inventories" open, you know. Rayther dry, but the
extrys
O.K.

It's the extrys, I 'old, make up life, arf the pleasure and most o' the pay.

Yus, princes and painters, philanterpists, premiers and patriots may gush,

But wot ud become of their shows if it weren't for the larks and the lush?

Lor bless yer, dear boy, picter galleries, balls, sandwich sworries and all,—

It's fun and the fizz makes 'em go, not the picter, the speech or the squall.

Keep yer eye on the buffet's my maxim, look out for the "jam" and the laugh,

And you'll collar the pick o' the basket, the rest is all sordust and chaff.

That's philosophy, Charlie, my pippin; the parsons and prigs may demur,

But if you would foller
their
tip, wy, you'll 'ave to go thundering fur.

Ah! "May, merry May!" up in town, fills your snide 'un as full as he'll carry

Of laughter and lotion. That's gospel to toffs and yours scrumptiously,

'Arry.

THE CAD'S CALENDAR

January.

January! Tailor's bill comes in.

Blow that blooming snip! I'm short o' tin.

Werry much enjoyed my Autumn caper,

But three quid fifteen do look queer paper.

Want another new rig out, wuss luck,

Gurl at Boodle's bar seems awful struck,

Like to take her to the pantermime;

That and oysters after
would
be prime.

Fan's a screamer; this top coat would blue it,

Yaller at the seams, black ink won't do it.

Wonder if old snip would spring another?

Boots, too, rayther seedy; beastly bother!

Lots o' larks that empty pockets "queer."

Can't do much on fifty quid a year.

February.

Febrywary! High old time for sprees!

Now's yer chance the gals to please or tease,

Dowds to guy and pooty ones to wheedle,

And to give all rival chaps the needle.

Crab your enemies,—I've got a many,

You can pot 'em proper for a penny.

My! Them walentines do 'it 'em 'ot.

Fust-rate fun; I always buy a lot.

Prigs complain they're spiteful,

Lor' wot stuff!

I can't ever get 'em strong enough.

Safe too; no one twigs your little spree,

If you do it on the strict Q. T.
[Pg 140]

If you're spoons, a flowery one's your plan.

Mem: I sent a proper one to Fan.

March.

March! I'm nuts upon a windy day,

Gurls do git in such a awful way.

Petticoats yer know, and pooty feet;

Hair all flying—tell you it's a treat.

Pancake day. Don't like 'em—flabby, tough,

Rayther do a pennorth o' plum-duff.

Seediness shows up as Spring advances,

Ah! the gurls do lead us pretty dances.

Days a-lengthening.

Think I spotted Fan

Casting sheep's eyes at another man.

Quarter-day, too, no more chance of tick.

Fancy I shall 'ave to cut my stick.

Got the doldrums dreadful, that is clear.

Two
d.
left—must go and do a beer.

April.

April! All Fools' Day's a proper time.

Cop old gurls and guy old buffers prime.

Scissors! don't they goggle and look blue

When you land them with a regular "do"?

Lor! the world would not be worth a mivvey

If there warn't no fools to cheek and chivy.

Then comes Easter. Got some coin in 'and,

Trot a bonnet out and do the grand.

Fan all flounce and flower; fellows mad

Heye us henvious; nuts to me, my lad.
[Pg 142]

'Ampstead! 'Ampton! Which is it to be?

Fan—no flat—prefers the Crystal P.

Nobby togs, high jinks, and lots o' lotion,

That's the style to go it, I've a notion!

May.

May! The month o' flowers. Spooney sell!

"Rum 'ot with," is wot
I
likes to smell.

Beats yer roses holler. A chice weed

Licks all flowers that ever run to seed.

Nobby button'oler very well

When one wants to do the 'eavy swell;

Otherwise don't care not one brass farden,

For the best ever blowed in Covent Garden.

Fan, though, likes 'em, cost a pretty pile,

Rayther stiff, a tanner for a smile.

Blued ten bob last time I took 'er out,

Left my silver ticker up the spout.

Women are sech sharks! If I don't drop 'er.

Guess that I shall come a hawful cropper!

June.

June! A jolly month; sech stunning weather.

Fan and I have lots of outs together:

Rorty on the river, sech prime 'unts,

Foul the racers, run into the punts.

Prime to 'ear the anglers rave and cuss,

When in quiet "swims" we raise a muss.

Snack on someone's lawn upon the quiet.

Won't the owner raise a tidy riot

When he twigs our scraps and broken bottles?

Cheaper this than rustyrongs or hottles,
[Pg 144]

Whitsuntide 'ud be a lot more gay

If it warn't so near to quarter-day.

Snip turns sour, pulls "county-courting" faces.

Must try and land a little on the races.

July.

'Ot July! Just nicked a handy fiver

(Twenty-five to one on old "Screw-driver"!)

New rig-out. This mustard colour mixture

Suits me nobby. Fan appears a fixture.

Gurls like style, you know, and colour ketches 'em,

But good show of ochre,—
that's
what fetches 'em,

Wimbledon!
I'm
not a Wolunteer.

Discipline don't suit this child—no fear!

But we 'ave fine capers at the camp,

Proper, but for that confounded scamp:

Punched my 'ead because I guyed his shooting.

Fan I fancied rather 'ighfaluting;

Ogled the big beggar as he propped me.

Would 'a licked 'im if
she
'adn't stopped me.

August.

August! Time to think about my outing.

No dibs yet, though, so it's no use shouting.

Make the best of the Bank 'Oliday.

Fan "engaged"! Don't look too bloomin' gay,

Drop into the bar to do a beer,

Twig her talking to that Volunteer.

Sling my 'ook instanter sharp and short,

Took Jemimer down to 'Ampton Court.

Not 'arf bad, that gurl. Got rather screwed,

Little toff complained as I was rude.
[Pg 146]

'It 'im in the wind, he went like death;

Weak, consumptive cove and short o' breath.

Licked 'im proper, dropped 'im like a shot,—

Only wish that Fan had seen
that
lot.

September.

'Ere's September! 'Oliday at last!

Off to Margit—mean to go it fast.

Mustard-coloured togs still fresh as paint,

Like to know who's natty, if
I
ain't.

Got three quid; have cried a go with Fan,

Game to spend my money like a man.

But sticking tight to one gal ain't no fun—

Here's no end of prime 'uns on the run;

Carn't resist me somehow, togs and tile

All A 1—make even swell ones smile.

Lor! if I'd the ochre, make no doubt

I could cut no end of big pots out.

Call me cad? When money's in the game,

Cad and swell are pooty much the same.

October.

Now October! Back again to collar,

Funds run low, reduced to last 'arf-dollar.

Snip on rampage, boots a getting thin,

'Ave to try the turf to raise some tin.

Evenings getting gloomy; high old games;

Music 'alls! Look up the taking names.

Proper swells them pros.! If I'd my choice,

There's my mark. Just wish I'd got a voice;

Cut the old den to-morrow, lots of cham.,

Cabs and diamonds,—ain't that real jam?
[Pg 148]

Got the straight tip for the Siezerwitch,

If I
honly
land it, I'll be rich.

Guess next mornin' wouldn't find me sober—

Allays get the blues about October.

November.

Dull November! Didn't land that lot.

Fear my father's son is going to pot.

Fan jest passed me, turned away 'er eyes,

Guess she ranked me with the
other
guys,

Nobby larks upon the ninth, my joker;

But it queers a chap to want the ochre.

Nothing like a crowd for regular sprees,

Ain't it fine to do a rush, and squeeze?

Twig the women fainting! Oh, it's proper!

Bonnet buffers when the blooming copper

Can't get near yer nohow. Then the fogs!

Rare old time for regular jolly dogs.

If a chap's a genuine 'ot member,

He
can
keep the game up in November!

December.

Dun December! Dismal, dingy, dirty.

Still short commons—makes a chap feel shirty.

Snip rampageous, drops a regular summons.

Fan gets married; ah! them gurls is rum 'uns!

After all the coin I squandered on 'er!

Want it now. A 'eap too bad, 'pon honour,

Snow! Ah, that's yer sort, though, and no error.

Treat to twig the women scud in terror.

Hot 'un in the eye for that old feller;

Cold 'un down 'is neck, bust his umbreller.
[Pg 150]

Ha! ha! Then Christmas,—'ave a jolly feast!

The boss will drop a tip,—hope so, at least.

RUS IN URBE

(
A Cockney Rhapsody
)

As I stroll through Piccadilly,

Scent of blossoms borne from Scilly

Greet me. Jonquil, rose, and lily,

Violet and daffydowndilly.

Oh, the feeling sweet and thrilly

That these blossoms flounced and frilly

From soft plains and headlands hilly

Bring my breast in Piccadilly!

It subdues me, willy nilly,

Though such sentiment seems silly,

And a bunch, dear, buys your Willy,

To dispatch, by post, to Milly,

Dwelling, far from Piccadilly,

In moist lowlands, rushed and rilly,

Blossomy as Penzance or Scilly.

Sweets to the sweet! "Poor Silly-Billy!"

You may say in accents trilly.

When the postman in the stilly

Eve, from distant Piccadilly,

Bears this box of rose and lily,

Violet and daffodilly,
[Pg 152]

To the rural maiden, Milly,

From her urban lover,

Willy.

P.S.—

Dry as toke and skilly,

Is this arid Piccadilly,

Notwithstanding rose and lily,

All the beauteous blooms of Scilly,

Reft of that flower of flowers—Milly.

So, at least, thinks

"Silly Billy."

SHAKESPEARE ON BLACKHEATH

I saw young 'Arry with his billycock on,

Checked trousers on his thighs, with knob stick armed,

Climb from the ground like fat pig up a pole,

And flop with such sore toil into his saddle

As though a bran-bag dropped down from the clouds,

To turn and wind a slow "Jerusalem,"

And shock the world with clumsy assmanship.

'Arry's Latest Conundrum.
—Why is a title-page like charity?—Becos it
always begins a tome. (Begins at 'ome, don'tcher see!)

Most Musical, Most Melancholy.

SONG OF THE COCKNEY SPORTSMAN

How happy could I be in heather,

At the grouse gaily blazing away!

But then, somehow, I can't touch a feather,

So 'tis better at Brighton to stay.

the Cockney's prime aversion—the h-bone.

[Pg 159]

A Model Model.

(
The artist is rather shy, and has left his model to do the honours of
his studio
). "From whom did Mr. M'Gilp paint that head?"

"From yours obediently, madam. I sit for the 'eads of all 'is 'oly men."

"He must find you a very useful person."

Near the new Baker Street Lodging House established by the County

Audacious 'Arryism.

fairy all over 'air, though he might an 'obgoblin.

THE BAGMAN'S BAG

Hark how the cockney sportsman drops

'ARRY ON 'ORSEBACK

Our 'Arry goes 'unting and sings with a will,

The 'eels of our 'Arry are seen in the air!

Cockney Epitaph for a Cook.
—"Peace to his hashes."

"A Horse," observed a Scotch vet., "may have a very good appetite, and
yet be unable to eat a bit."

"Ah," said 'Arry, "there's the difference between a 'oss and a ostridge,
which could eat bit, snaffle, curb and all."

short curly tail and rough hair. Do you keep dogs like that?"

Fancier.

[Pg 174]

Cockney Philosophy.

The Socratic mode of argument is the only true mode of chopping logic,
because it proceeds altogether on the principle of axing questions.

'
Arry puts 'em right.

The
Daily Chronicle
—recently suggested that the plural of rhinoceros
is a disputed point. 'Arry writes: "What O,
Mr. P.
, 'disputed'?—not a
bit. Any kiddy as 'as 'ad 'arf an eddication knows what the plural of
''oss' is, don't he? No matter as to its bein' spelt ''os' or ''oss.'
Plural, anyway ''osses.' 'Bus-'os'—'Bus-'osses.'
'Rhinocer-os'—'Rhinocer-osses.' That's as plain as an 'aystack, ain't
it?

A SONG OF SPRING

By a Cockney Poet.

All hail, thou jocund time of year,

To Cockneys and cock-robins dear!

All hail, thou flowery, showery season,

When throstles, mating, perch the trees on:

When sparrows on the house-tops sit,

And court their loves with cheery twit:

While opera songsters tune their throats,

Exchanging for our gold their notes!

Now Nature her new dress receives,

And dinner-tables spread their leaves;

Asparagus again one sees,

And early ducklings, served with peas;

Again the crisp whitebait we crunch,

And chops of lambkin blithely munch;

Salmon again our shops afford,

And plovers' eggs adorn the board;

While for one day at least our sons

May stuff themselves with hot cross buns!

See now the swells begin to show

Their horsemanship in Rotten Row:

See now the Drive is thronged once more,

And idlers lounge there as of yore:

See now fair April fills Mayfair,

And gives new life to Grosvenor Square.

See now what crowds flock to the Zoo,

Where Master Hippo is on view

See daffodils, and daisies pied

In bloom, and buttercups beside:

See now the thorn, and e'en the rose

Signs of returning Spring disclose:

See now the lilac large in bud;

While costermongers, splashed with mud,

The product of the passing showers,

Cry, "Here's yer all a blowing flowers!"

Or wake the echoes of the groves
[A]

With "Hornaments for yer fire-stoves!"

[A]
Westbourne Grove, Lisson Grove, Camden Grove, &c.

'Appy 'Arry

And tupp'ny ciga-a-ar."

Cockney Art-Teacher (newly arrived and nervous—after a long silence).

"If you

Collapse of expectant student.

[Pg 183]

Standing no Nonsense.

'Arry.
"Phew!"—(
the weather was warm, and they had walked over from
'Ammersmith
)—"bring us a bottle o'champagne, waiter."

Waiter.
"Yessir—dry, sir?"

'Arry (aughtily, to put a stop to this familiarity at once).
"Never
you mind whether we're dry or whether we ain't!—bring the wine!"

[Pg 184]

Sheredity.

Lady.
"You don't mean to tell me that this little girl is fit to wait
at table!"

Mother (proudly).
"Well 'm, she
ought
to be, seein' as 'ow 'er

plate layer
for five-and-twenty year!"

[Pg 185]

Lady (referring to programme, to friend).
"'Schumann,

'Arry (who thinks he is being addressed, and always ready to oblige
with information).
"Oh, op. 2. Second dance; second 'op, yer know. May
I 'ave the pleasure?"

The Sale of Intoxicants to Children Bill.

"It's another hinjustice to hus pore wimmen, it is! They won't let us

Temperance Orator.
"Ho, pause, my dear friends, pause!"

A Voice.
"Ye're right, ole man,

[Pg 190]

Cockney Hobservation.

Cockneys are not the only people who drop or exasperate the "h's." It is
done by common people in the provinces, and you may laugh at them for
it. The deduction therefore is, that a peasant, with an "h," is fair
game.

New Cockney Saint.
—Mrs. Malaprop declares that if she lives to be a
hundred—and all her family detain a venerated age—she will certainly
have a Saint 'Enery.

Riddle by 'Arry.
—"Look 'ere, if you're speakin' of a young unmarried

"Do you pass any pubs on the way to Broadstairs, cabby?"

Cabby.
"Yes. Lots."

'Arry.
"Well,

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

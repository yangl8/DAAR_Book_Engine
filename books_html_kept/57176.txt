INCREASE ALLEN LAPHAM, FIRST SCHOLAR
OF WISCONSIN

By Milo M. Quaife

The most characteristic and comprehensive theme in all
American history is that of the westward movement. From
the time of the first feeble landings at Quebec, at Plymouth,
and at Jamestown, the history of our country has been
characterized by a steady westward surge of the population,
reaching out eagerly for new lands to conquer, and in the
process carrying the banner of civilization ever westward
and establishing successive new communities and states. The
present generation of students of American history has not
been unmindful of the importance and interest which attaches
to this westward movement, and has not failed to accord it,
in the main, all due recognition. With the doings and deserts
of our pioneer farm, canal, railroad, and city builders, our
hewers of wood and drawers of water, in a word, historians
have long made us familiar. Unfortunately, however, too
little attention has been given, and too little recognition
accorded, the equally important service of those among our
western pioneers who laid the foundations of our spiritual
and intellectual civilization. That man may not live by bread
alone was stated long ago on excellent authority. The hewing
down of the forests and breaking of the prairies, the
building of houses, highways, and cities were all essential
steps in the process of transforming the wilderness into an
abode of enlightened civilization. Equally essential was the
establishment of institutions of learning and religion, and the
development of a taste for literature and art. The blossoming
of these finer fruits of civilization inevitably tended to
sweeten and refine the society of the pioneers, which otherwise,

Pg 4

engrossed in a stern physical struggle with the wilderness,
must have become hard and gross in character.

Fortunate indeed is the pioneer community which numbers
among its settlers intellectual and spiritual leaders fired
with enthusiasm and endowed with ability. Fortunate it was
for Wisconsin when in the very year of her birth as a territory,
Increase Allen Lapham cast his lot for the remainder
of his life with her. The service rendered by the intellectual
aristocracy of pioneer Massachusetts and the other New
England colonies has long been accorded ample recognition.
The valiant labors of Increase Lapham in the service of the
state of his adoption have largely gone unheeded and unrewarded
to the present moment. Yet it is safe to predict that
when the future historian shall come to scan the record of the
first half century of Wisconsinâs history as a territory and
state, he will affirm that no man brought greater honor to
her or performed more valuable services in her behalf than
did the modest scholar, Increase Allen Lapham.

The frontier has ever been proud of its self-made men,
esteeming chiefly, not who a man might be but rather what he
was able to do. Lapham was a true frontiersman in this
respect at least, that he was a wholly self-made scholar. He
was born in March, 1811, at Palmyra, New York, âtwo miles
west of the Macedon locks on the Erie Canal.â His father,
Seneca Lapham, was an engineering contractor, the pursuit
of whose profession necessitated frequent family removals.
Thus, in 1818 the family was located at Pottsville, Pennsylvania,
where the father was employed on the Schuylkill
Canal; two years later he was back on the Erie Canal and
the family was residing for a second time at Galen, New
York; the next few years witnessed further removals to
Rochester and Lockport in New York, and to several points
in Ohio.

The boy, Increase Lapham, was evidently a precocious
youth. At thirteen years of age he âfound frequent saleâ

Pg 5

for his drawings of the plan of the locks his father had
assisted in constructing at Lockport. About this time he
gained employment, first at cutting stone for the locks and
then as rodman on the canal. While engaged in stonecutting,
he wrote in later years, âI found my first fossils and
began my collection. The beautiful specimens I found in
the deep rock cut at this place gave me my first ideas of
mineralogy and initiated a habit of observation which has
continued through all my life. I found amusement and
pastime in the study of nature, leading to long walks in the
country, and as I found no others of similar tastes these
rambles were usually without companions.â

When fifteen years of age the youth followed his father
to Ohio where he worked for a short time on the Miami
Canal, removing at the close of the year, 1826, to undertake
similar employment at Louisville. At this time, apparently,
he first attracted the attention of members of the world of
scholarship, for we find the renowned scientist, Professor
Silliman of Yale, writing to thank him âfor the liberal spirit
which you manifest in encouraging a work designed to promote
the public goodâ—the work in question being the

American Journal of Science
, of which Silliman was the
founder and editor. Within a few months the boy made his
first contribution to scholarship by sending to Silliman, for
publication in the
American Journal of Science
, a comprehensive
description of the canal around the Ohio Rapids.

At this time he was only sixteen, and his opportunities
for schooling had been exceedingly scant. Yet his habits
of observation and his powers of reasoning and of expressing
himself in clear and convincing English might well be coveted
by the average college undergraduate of today. A convenient
illustration of these powers is afforded by Laphamâs
journal entry for October 24. 1827:

A smoky day. Mr. Henry, the engineer [of the canal], is of the
opinion that the smoke occasioning our Indian summer, as the smoky
weather is called, does not originate in the burning prairies in the West,

Pg 6

or in other extensive fires; but that it is from the decay of vegetation.
(If it is possible for vegetables to be converted into smoke without combustion
this will appear very probable!!!!)

He relates an instance of a very smoky day at New Madrid being
followed by an earthquake; this he supposed to be the smoke that had
arisen through the ground. I told him that I supposed it was owing to
a peculiar state of the atmosphere which was unfavorable to the decomposition
of smoke; to this he made no reply.

The years of Laphamâs youth and early manhood from
1827-36 must be passed in rapid review. Two years in all
were spent on canal work at Louisville; over three more
followed at Portsmouth, Ohio; in April, 1833, the Ohio
State Board of Canal Commissioners installed the young
engineer (now twenty-two years of age) as its secretary at
an annual salary of $400. Thereafter for three years his
headquarters were in the state capitol at Columbus, his work
being that of secretary of the canal commission. Meanwhile
the elder Lapham, advised and financially assisted by his sons,
Darius and Increase, had abandoned the calling of canal
contractor and settled upon a farm near Mount Tabor. This
became the permanent family home, and here Seneca Lapham
acquired a well-deserved repute among his fellows both
for his sobriety of character and for his progressive ideas
and practices with respect to farming operations. In the
years under review Increase Lapham continued to pursue
with enthusiasm his scientific studies and investigations, the
range of his interests and observations widening with every
passing year. Relations of acquaintance and friendship were
established with a large number of scientific investigators, all
of them, doubtless, much older than was Lapham himself.
The study of botany and zoÃ¶logy, and investigations with
respect to more scientific methods of farming were begun.
In a communication on âAgriculture in Ohio,â contributed to
the
Genesee Farmer
in 1833, the modern doctrine with
respect to rotation of crops and scientific renovation of the
soil through the use of fertilizers was laid down. A third
of a century later, but still over a third of a century in

Pg 7

advance of the recent movement for the conservation of the
natural resources of the country, Lapham followed up this
general line of thought by writing and publishing as a Wisconsin
legislative document a comprehensive argument in
favor of the conservation of the stateâs forest resources.
Happy had it been for both state and nation if heed had
been given in time to the vital problem to which he thus early
called attention.

To a practical application of the Jacksonian theory of
spoils politics was due the migration of Lapham from the
capital of Ohio to the new-born town of Milwaukee in the
spring of 1836. In later years he humorously explained that
he was âreformedâ out of office and employment in Ohio;
at the time, there is reason to believe, the blow was not considered
in a humorous light. Early in his canal career Lapham
had worked under Byron Kilbourn, who now had
thrown in his fortunes with the rising young village of
Milwaukee. As a leading promoter of the coming metropolis
Kilbourn had extensive business projects in view, among
them that of procuring the construction of the Milwaukee
and Rock River Canal, which would, it was fondly believed,
go far toward realizing for the nascent city her dreams of
metropolitan greatness. There was much demand for men
possessed of engineering ability, and Kilbourn, who had conceived
a friendship for Lapham which was to prove lifelong,
now brought him to Wisconsin on a salary of $1,000 a year.
Thus Wisconsin became his permanent home, for he left
Milwaukee only to remove in old age to a farm near Oconomowoc.

At the mouth of the Milwaukee River Lapham found,
on his arrival on July 3, 1836, fifty houses where a few
months before had been but two or three. In coming from
the older settled portion of Ohio to Milwaukee he had entered
a new world. Chicago was still in the height of its first mad
speculative boom and conditions at Milwaukee differed only

Pg 8

in detail from those which prevailed at Chicago. Indeed, on
reaching Detroit on his westward journey, Lapham wrote
to his brother: âI am now, and have been since I arrived
at Sandusky, in what might very properly be called the
world of speculators: everybody you meet is engaged in
some speculation; everything you hear has some speculation
at the bottom. The hotel where I am now writing has suspended
on the walls of the barroom plats of new towns; I
have added the ninth.â No wonder the impecunious young
man, engulfed in such an atmosphere, proceeded, immediately
upon his arrival at Milwaukee, to purchase three town
lots for $5,000, payable âone-half in one one-half in two
years.â How did he expect to provide the money to meet
this obligation? He did not expect to provide it; he âbought
them for the purpose of selling them again at a higher price.â

Lapham, however, was never designed for a business
man, and he never acquired more than a very modest competence
in life. I have spoken of the speculative mania which
then pervaded all the newer West merely to illustrate the
sincerity of the young immigrantâs devotion to scholarship,
from the pursuit of which even the thrill and intoxication of
perhaps the greatest boom the country has ever witnessed
could detain him only momentarily. Within two weeks of
his arrival at Milwaukee he records that he has made a map
of the county (possibly a professional matter) and âdone a
little botanizing.â Even earlier, while at Detroit en route to
the West, he had taken time to write Professor Asa Gray an
offer to collect for him specimens from the new region to
which the writer was going. âLet me entreat you to pay
particular attention to my
pets
, the grasses,â wrote the noted
botanist in reply; âI will see that you have due credit for
every interesting discovery.â Six weeks after his arrival at
Milwaukee Lapham wrote to another botanical friend that
he found many new plants at Milwaukee; and that âin order
to inform my friends of what plants are found here and to

Pg 9

enable them to indicate such as they want I think of publishing
a catalogue of such as I find.â

Thus was conceived the idea responsible for the first
publication of a scientific character within the bounds of the
present state of Wisconsin, for before the close of the
year there issued from the office of Milwaukeeâs newly
founded newspaper a
Catalogue of Plants and Shells, Found
in the Vicinity of Milwaukee, on the West Side of Lake
Michigan
, by I. A. Lapham. It would probably be safe to
affirm that this was the first scientific work to be published
west of the Great Lakes, at least to the north of
St.
Louis.
For in literary matters Chicago, whose commercial progress
Milwaukee never succeeded in equalling, must yield the palm
of leadership to her early North Shore rival. Leaving out of
consideration one or two lyceum lectures which were printed
after delivery, the earliest Chicago imprint of a scholarly
character of which I have any knowledge is Mrs. Kinzieâs
well-known story of the Chicago massacre, published as a
pamphlet in 1844; and this, a reminiscent family narrative,
does not deserve to be regarded as scholarly in the true sense
of the term.

In 1838, two years after his arrival, Lapham began the
collection of material for a gazeteer of Wisconsin. Published
at Milwaukee in 1844, it constitutes both Wisconsinâs first
book of history and the stateâs first home-made book of any
character to be published in more durable binding than paper.
So attractive were its merits that an unscrupulous rival author,
Donald McLeod, more adept at wielding the scissors than the
pen, promptly and brazenly plagiarized a large portion of
its contents for his
History of Wiskonsan
, published, appropriately
enough, by âSteeleâs Pressâ at Buffalo, in 1846: and
a copy of this fraudulent publication was recently offered for
sale by a dealer, with due encomiums upon its rarity and
worth, for the modest sum of thirty dollars.

Pg 10

Thus far we have followed Laphamâs career in due
chronological order. Some thirty years were yet to elapse
before his death in 1875, years crowded with earnest, self-effacing
labors in the cause of scholarship. In what follows
I shall treat of his various scholarly interests and achievements
in topical order, without regard to chronology.

Although himself self-taught Laphamâs active interest in
educational institutions persisted throughout his life. In
1843 he secured the adoption by the territorial legislature
of a resolution to Congress petitioning a grant of land for
the purpose of establishing in Wisconsin an institution for
the instruction of the deaf and dumb, and blind, and an
asylum for the insane. He is the real father of the Milwaukee
public high school system. In 1846 he donated thirteen
acres of land lying within the city limits for the purpose of
establishing the first high school. In the spring of 1848
he was commissioned by the city as its agent to secure a loan
of $16,000 in the East for the building of schoolhouses, and he
made the long trip to New York and Boston on this public
mission. In the same year he proffered the newly authorized
University of Wisconsin the gift of âa pretty extensive
herbariumâ of 1,000 or 1,500 species of plants. In March,
1848, by a meeting of citizens held at the council house âit
was deemed expedient to establish a college in this cityâ and
an executive committee of five townsmen was appointed
with full power to consummate the desired object. Lapham
was one of the five men charged with this weighty responsibility,
and out of this movement proceeded the âMilwaukee
Female Seminary,â which today is represented by the
Milwaukee-Downer College, one of the stateâs noble institutions
of higher learning. In August, 1850, as president of
the executive board of the college, Lapham had the satisfaction
of delivering to its first two graduates their diplomas.
When, in later years, he was offered a professorship in the
school he declined the position, modestly explaining that his

Pg 11

lack of education and of teaching experience rendered him
unfit to discharge the trust.

With our own State Historical Society his connection was
long and honorable. Before coming to Wisconsin he had
actively engaged in the work of the Ohio Historical and
Philosophical Society. He hailed with joy the formation of
the State Historical Society of Wisconsin in 1849 and was
one of the committee of three which drafted its first constitution.
The society being formally organized, he at once
began to labor to promote its collections. He served as its
vice-president for twelve years, and as president for ten
additional years. With the Smithsonian Institution he established
relations of mutual helpfulness almost immediately
upon its organization. Of his relations with this and other
learned institutions more will be said in connection with
certain lines of investigation which he carried on.

In 1849 Dr. Lapham proposed to the American Antiquarian
Society of Worcester, Massachusetts, to make an
extensive survey of the mounds and other ancient remains
in Wisconsin provided the society would defray the actual
outlay of money involved. The enterprise thus proposed
was adopted by the Antiquarian Society, as a result of which
the survey was made, the fruits of it being given to the
scientific world a few years later in Laphamâs
Antiquities of
Wisconsin
. This work, published under the auspices of the
Smithsonian Institution, is filled with the authorâs drawings,
beautifully executed, of the numerous earthworks and
mounds he had located. Students of American archeology
will always owe the patient author a heavy debt of gratitude
for having carefully plotted and described these evidences
of aboriginal habitation in Wisconsin before the work of
destruction which inevitably attended the advance of white
settlement had gained much headway.

Thus in many departments of learning—in geology,
botany, conchology, in meteorology, history, and archeology—Lapham

Pg 12

busied himself, acquiring repute among the scholars
of Europe as in America, all the while earning his simple
living by such professional work as he permitted himself the
time to do. Perhaps no single achievement of his possesses
more of interest to the world in general or has directly added
more to the well-being and comfort of every one of us than
his work in securing the establishment of a weather-service
bureau by the national government. It cannot be claimed
that he fathered the idea of such a service and its attendant
possibility of foretelling weather conditions far enough in
advance to make the information of real commercial value.
Neither can Robert Fulton be credited with having fathered
the idea of the steamboat. Yet we rightly regard Fulton
as its real inventor, since he was the first to demonstrate the
practicability of the idea. So with Lapham and the weather
bureau. For twenty years he urged upon the Smithsonian
Institution, the Wisconsin legislature, and other agencies of
society the practicability and the immense advantage of such
a government service. For twenty years, as a private individual
he made records and observations, seeking to demonstrate
his claims. But in the nature of the case (as Lapham
repeatedly pointed out) only some powerful agency like the
national government could take the many observations at
different points necessary to the success of the work, assemble
their results, and make them known throughout the nation
in time to be of practical use to the public. Finally, the
persistent seeker after the public good succeeded in attracting
the notice of men powerful enough to compel the attention
of Congress. As a result the law for the incorporation of the
signal service was passed. How the result was achieved by
Lapham may best be told in the words of a man to whom he
had appealed for assistance. At the meeting of the National
Board of Fire Underwriters, held in New York in April,
1875, a resolution to appoint a special committee to correspond
with the United States Signal Service Department in

Pg 13

relation to wind as an element in fire risks was under consideration
when Hon. E. D. Holton rose and said:

There is a little man who lives in my town about so high (holding
his hand a little lower than his shoulders) who lives in an obscure part
of the town, and is known to comparatively few people in the town. You
go to his house and find it filled with all the evidences of science,
specimens from the vegetable world and the mineral world. Going to
London a few years ago I was given by this little man a letter of introduction
to Sir William Hooker, custodian of the Kew Gardens, which
secured for me eminent entertainment and influence. Five years ago as
I was about to leave my house to go to Richmond, Virginia, to attend a
meeting of the National Board of Trade, he came to my house and had a
resolution drawn to be submitted to the National Board of Trade, declaring
that the national government should organize a service to
look after
the winds of the continent of America
.

When I came to Richmond I presented that resolution. It received a
most eloquent second from the late General Wolbridge, an eminent citizen
of New York. The National Board of Trade immediately passed the
resolution. As soon as it was passed I sent it to my friend, General
Paine, then member of Congress from my district in Wisconsin, and in
an incredibly short space of time for that august body—which is supposed
to have at least as much red tape as the National Insurance Company—it
was passed. I did not expect that the wind question would meet
me at this angle of the insurance trade, but it seems it has.

That gentleman I will name. I rise to make these remarks and I wish
to speak his name in this connection, because out of his labors so persistent,
in his humble house, so unknown to his countrymen—for he is
better known in foreign circles of science than in his own country—and
through his labors and instrumentality, this thing has been brought into
its present shape. His name is Dr. Increase Allen Lapham of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.

And how, it may be asked, did Laphamâs fellow-men
requite his lifelong labors devoted to the public good? The
answer which must be made affords much support to the
proverbial belief in the ungratefulness of republics. When
in 1870 Congress passed the bill providing for the weather-signal
service, its execution was entrusted to the chief signal
officer of the army. By him Lapham was employed for a
short time as special assistant in the War Department at a
yearly salary of $2,000. When he sent home (he was stationed
at Chicago) to his daughter the proceeds of his first
monthâs wages, she wrote to her brother as follows:

Pg 14

Last Friday father sent home $128.03 to be deposited as the first
money of any amount he ever received for any scientific occupation
(regular salary at least) and Thursday afternoon I was down town and
met B. He said he had been around among some of fatherâs friends and
collected $100 to make father a life member of the Chicago Astronomical
Society—(You know this society owns the âbig telescopeâ at Dearborn
Observatory).

I forbear to quote the daughterâs delighted remarks which
follow; more profitable will it be for us to consider for a
moment the bitter irony of this situation. After more than
forty years of zealous public service to receive so pitiful a
salary, his first tangible reward, and to have this discontinued
within a few months time! To be fitted both by inherent
tastes and lifelong training to enjoy and profit by membership
in such an association, and yet unable, because our
countrymen estimate the services of scholars so low, to pay
the paltry membership fee! Here, indeed, is the cross on
which in the United States today we crucify scholarship.

One other matter and I shall conclude. Before he left
Ohio Dr. Lapham had labored to induce the legislature to
make provision for a geological survey of that state. From
the time of his arrival in Wisconsin he strove as an individual
to carry out such a survey here. Necessarily in order to do it
thoroughly and to publish its results the power of the state
must be brought into play. At length in 1873 provision was
made by statute for a geological survey of Wisconsin and
Governor Washburn appointed Dr. Lapham chief geologist
to have the direction of the enterprise. The work was pushed
vigorously and efficiently throughout the seasons of 1873 and
1874. Suddenly, in January, 1875, Governor Taylor removed
Dr. Lapham in order to make a place for one of his
spoils-seeking supporters. According to the
American
Journal of Science
the new geologistâs âsole recommendation
for the position was political services, no one having ever
heard of him before as acquainted with geology or any other
science.â Thus finally did our state requite its first scholar—first

Pg 15

certainly from the viewpoint of chronology, and probably
first from every other viewpoint. âKnowing that time, which
cures all things,â wrote the three assistant geologists he had
chosen two years before, âwill do you ample justice, and feeling
most strongly the irreparable loss that the state has sustained
in the disseverment of your connection with the survey,
we remain with the most sincere respect, Your obedient
servants.â As an indication of the quality of the assistants
selected by Dr. Lapham it may be noted that one of the men
who thus testified this appreciation of their deposed chief was
Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin, who has been for many years
chief geologist of the University of Chicago.

Time indeed cures all things, notwithstanding that the
mills of the gods grind slowly. Of Dr. Laphamâs spoilsman
successor as chief geologist of Wisconsin, it may still be said,
as at the time of his appointment, that his reputation as a
scientist yet remains to be made. Governor Taylor, who
made the removal, sleeps in silent Forest Hill within sight
of the capitol where formerly he ruled a state; while in the
holy of holies of the beautiful new state capitol, the governorâs
reception chamber, in the midst of famous soldiers, explorers,
and legislators, an eminent artist has chosen to depict
the application of scientific knowledge to the benefit of mankind
in the person of Doctor Lapham seated at his desk, before
him an open manuscript, and on the wall nearby, supported
by two children typifying the winds, his map of the United
States, showing the first storm traced across the country.
More recently still, prompted by the urging of citizens of
the locality, the federal government has given to the highest
eminence in Waukesha County, overlooking the beautiful
lake region which Dr. Lapham so loved in life, the name of
Lapham Peak. Time is slowly proving his worth. More
fitting memorials than these he could not have asked.

A FOREST FIRE IN NORTHERN WISCONSIN

By John L. Bracklin
[1]

I had been running a steamboat on Lake Chetak and
Birch Lake in Sawyer County, Wisconsin, during the summer
of 1898 and had finished my work September 25. I
arrived in Rice Lake with the expectation of having a couple
of weeksâ rest before again taking up my duties as foreman
of one of Knapp, Stout, and Companyâs logging camps for
the winter. I had been in town one day, about long enough
to get cleaned up, when I went down to the companyâs office
to draw some money. While I was in the general office some
one said: âYour father wants to see you in his office.â I
walked into his office and sat down. He had a map showing
camp locations and other data spread out on the desk before
him, which he studied for a few moments and then turned to
me, saying: âJohn, how soon can you get ready to go to the
woods?â This, as you know, could have but one answer, and
that was, âNow!â âAll right,â he said, âI am somewhat
alarmed about this long-continued dry spell and fires might
spring up at any moment, and none of the camps or dams in
your locality have any fire protection, such as back-firing
and water-barrels at hand. Therefore I wish you would pick
up a few men and whatever you might need and get up to
your camp, make your headquarters there, and look after the
camps in that vicinity, namely: Mulvaneyâs, Aronsonâs, Knutsonâs,
Max Downâs, Thompsonâs, and the old Ahern Camp on
Sucker Creek.â

Pg 17

I swallowed the disappointment of a contemplated trip to
Minneapolis to see the only girl I ever thought very much of,
whom I had not seen for about eight months, and stepping
over to the shipping clerkâs desk, I wrote up a list of food
supplies and a requisition for a team to move the same,
expecting to start the following morning. I went out on the
street to pick up some men and came across Lee Miller and
Frank Wirth, inseparable pals, who had worked for me the
previous winter. I asked them how soon they would be ready
to go to the woods, and they said, âRight now.â âAll right,â
said I, âpack your sacks and be here at six in the morning,
and we will load the team and go.â While we were talking,
another man came along, Julius Peterson by name, a hunchback,
who, notwithstanding his deformity, was considered
one of the best sawyers that ever felled a tree. He also was
willing to start immediately, so I went over to the hotel and
wrote the only girl—who, by the way, has been my wife for
the past seventeen years—that I would have to defer that
visit for another seven or eight months. I got my clothes
packed again, and at six-thirty the following morning we
were on our way to my camp at the head of Birch Lake, a
distance of about thirty miles.

We arrived at Cedar Lake Dam for dinner and at camp
about eight oâclock the night of September 27, 1898. We
opened the door of the cook-shanty very cautiously, so as
not to disturb a family of skunks who yearly took up their
abode under the floors of the camps during the summer
months. They did not approve of being disturbed, and from
past experiences we decided not to make any unnecessary
noise, such as moving tables and heavy boxes along the floors,
until such time as they might be more accustomed to our
presence. We built a fire in the stove and made some coffee,
and after what we called a âstore-feed,â consisting of cheese,
crackers, and sardines, we spread our blankets upon the floor
to sleep as only men of that day could. We arose about five-thirty

Pg 18

on the morning of the twenty-eighth, had another
store-breakfast, unloaded the wagon, and started the team
back to town. Then the great question confronted us as to
who was to do the cooking. The regular cook for the winter,
Herman Gottschalk, could not be had for at least two weeks,
as he was cooking for the rafting-crews at Reedâs Landing.
Frank Wirth finally agreed to a compromise: he was to do
the cooking until such time as the first man should kick and
then said man was to cook until someone else should kick, to
which we all agreed.

Leaving Wirth at the camp to cook up a regular dinner,
Miller, Peterson, and I left for Mulvaneyâs Camp to see
what condition it would be in, if we had the unexpected fire.
We arrived there about ten oâclock and opened up the blacksmith
shop, got out empty barrels, cooking utensils, and
everything that would hold water, and started Miller out to
round up a couple of yokes of cattle. He returned in an
hour or so with about ten head. We selected two yokes out
of the bunch and, hooking them up to a breaking-plow,
plowed about a dozen furrows around the camp, after which
we turned them loose. They immediately started off in a
westernly direction, which you may call animal instinct if
you will, for we afterward found that to be the only possible
direction they could have taken and evaded the fire, which
unbeknown to us was so soon to follow. We sat down and
smoked our pipes and joked about the unnecessary precaution
of filling the barrels, as at that time it was one of the
prettiest autumn days I have ever seen, not a cloud in the
sky, not a breeze stirring, no sign of smoke anywhere, and
no possible chance, apparently, of there ever being a fire.
Nevertheless, we were carrying out instructions and we set
to work to fill up the barrels, which took about an hour.

We had just filled the barrels on the roof of the long
barns, when Miller, who was on top of one of the barns, called
my attention to a cloud of smoke that had suddenly sprung

Pg 19

up on the horizon about five or six miles to the south and west
of us. I climbed up on the roof of the barn, where I could
get a better view. The wind suddenly arose and within ten
minutes it had attained the velocity of a cyclone; what followed
happened so quickly it has never as yet been quite clear
to me. I can remember the black cloud settling down and
in less time than it takes to write this, the fire was upon us—not
on the ground as you might imagine, but in the air. The
heat became terrific and the first sign of a blaze sprang up in
the top of a broken stump about twenty feet in height and
a hundred feet from the sleeping-shanty.

I jumped off the roof of the barn, grabbed up a water
bucket, Peterson doing the same, and ran for the sleeping-shanty,
a distance of about 150 feet. Before we could reach
it, it was afire. We threw several buckets of water upon it,
but the water might have been kerosene for all the good it
did. Seeing it was useless to try to save the sleeping-shanty
or the cook-shanty, which were only a few feet apart, we ran
back to the barns, thinking to save them. This may sound
dubious, but it all happened within twenty minutes of the
time we first saw smoke four or five miles away. As quickly
as we reached the barn I motioned to Miller to dump the
barrels of water which we had placed there; those buildings,
if you remember them, were each about sixty feet in length,
standing parallel, with a hay shed between, which contained
about ten tons of baled hay left over from the previous
winter. While Miller ran to the far end of the barn, upsetting
the six or seven barrels as he ran, Peterson and I were throwing
water on the hay shed. I donât suppose we had thrown
more than ten or twelve buckets when the roof of the barn
took fire. As I said before, the fire seemed to be in the very
air, for strange as it may seem, the dry grass and leaves
around the buildings were not yet burned. In less than a
minute the roof was afire from one end to the other. I
motioned to Miller to jump off. He did so and ran towards

Pg 20

me. When he got near enough so that I could hear, he yelled:
âWhat in hell will we do now, and which way will we go?â

Then for the first time I realized the danger we were in.
A glance around showed only one way open and that was due
north towards a wall of virgin green timber, a distance of
about 500 yards. The ground between us and the edge of the
timber had been logged the previous winter, leaving treetops
and brush piled up here and there in great heaps—you
know how it would look after being logged. How we got to
the edge of the timber I can hardly remember, but in the
excitement I still had the empty water-bucket in my hand.
We reached the timber to find that the fire had beaten us.
Perhaps a burning brand from one of the buildings had
dropped just at the edge of the timber among the dry leaves
and had burned a strip of ground about 200 feet in width,
leaving the ground perfectly bare. Luckily for us the timber
was green, with no underbrush to hold the fire, for when we
reached there, there was nothing left on the ground but the
smouldering ashes of the leaves. We stopped to get our
breath, and then it dawned upon us how useless it was to run.
I said to Miller, âIf we ever get out of this, it will be by staying
right here.â He gave me one look, which I shall never
forget, as much as to say, âMan, you are crazy,â and again
started to run, Peterson following. I then turned and looked
back whence we had come. There was a solid wall of fire
similar to a great wave, extending as far to each side as one
could see and mounting fifty feet in height. It is hard to
express just what my feelings were, but I remember that I
ceased to be afraid, knowing that our time had come, there
being not a possible chance to come out alive. The main
body of the fire by that time had reached a point about where
the camps had stood. I was almost tempted to start to run,
when I turned to find Miller and Peterson again at my side.
They had run only a short distance into the tail end of the
advance fire and had come back. I remember Miller lying on

Pg 21

his face on the ground with his head stuck into a hole that
he had dug out with his hands. The ground at the roots of
the trees was damp, and the only way we could breathe was
by lying on the ground, for when we stood up the heat and
smoke were so thick we could not breathe.

It is interesting to hear people relate their experiences
and close encounters with death. After hearing them, I can
judge just how close they really have been to real death. For
as I see it, it has four stages—first, the excitement; then
fear; then resolution; then death itself. At about this time
we had reached the point of resolve; Miller and Peterson were
on their knees praying, while as for myself, nothwithstanding
I have lived a somewhat better life since, I concluded that
as I had never asked God for anything prior to that, it was a
very poor time to start in now that I was about to die. So
I concluded to go just as I was, believing, as I still do, that
a death-bed confession would avail me nothing. You can
best realize our position when I tell you that we were never
over four feet apart for at least four hours and during that
period there was not one word exchanged among us. At the
end of that time I was standing leaning up against a tree.
Other trees were falling all around us, and as I stood there
wishing one might fall on me and end it all, it started to
rain. It must have poured, for before I realized what had
happened I was wet to the skin. That brought me back to
my senses and I realized that I was alive and that I still
wanted to live. I ran a short distance and it came to me like
a flash that I was going the wrong way to get out. I turned
and ran back, and as I ran, stumbled over Peterson, who was
still on his knees. The first word to break the dull silence
of those hours was spoken then, when he said, âWhat in hell
are you trying to do?â We made our way out to the old tote
road, and after walking about a mile west, got out of the
range of the fire.

Pg 22

We made our way back to camp to find Wirth all excited.
His greeting was, âGee, you ought to have been here this
afternoon, for everything at the damâ—meaning Birch Lake
dam
—âhas burned, camps and all, for I could see the hay
stacks as they would catch fire and the flames shoot up in
the air hundreds of feet.â Then the thought flashed upon
me: The dam, suppose it should burn out. With an eleven-foot
head of water on Birch Lake and Big Chetak, what
would happen to the country below? Miller and Peterson
being all in, I asked Wirth if he would go with me and try
to make the dam. The rain had lasted only about half an
hour and the fire, which had again got under way, but with
no wind, was fortunately not burning as furiously as earlier
in the day. The road to the dam took us back into the edge
of the fire, but on making several detours we reached the dam
to find both wings afire. Pete Null, and four or five men who
had been stationed there at the Birch Lake Camp, were
making a desperate fight to save the dam, but they were
almost played out, having fought in vain all afternoon to
save the camps.

One glance and I saw what to do. Wirth and I picked
up a couple of peavies, and climbing down to the apron,
ripped up four or five planks and stuck them on end down
under the bed plates, or stringers, leaving them standing
pointing up stream at an angle of forty-five degrees. We
then climbed back upon the dam and raised the gate four or
five inches. When the current struck those planks it threw
a spray of water all over both wings of the dam and inside
of ten minutes we had the fire completely out.

MAP PREPARED BY MR. BRACKLIN TO ILLUSTRATE HIS NARRATIVE

We all sat down and rested for about half an hour; then
Wirth and I took a boat and rowed back to camp, a distance
of about two miles. When we reached there, about midnight,
the rain set in and it rained until noon the following
day. Miller and Peterson were still unable to move around
much, as their faces and hands were badly blistered and their

Pg 24

eyes pained them terribly. As for myself, aside from being
unable to speak above a whisper, I was in pretty good shape,
and knowing it would only be a couple of days until father,
as soon as he could reach us, would be there to look the situation
over—plans for the coming winter of logging would
have to be changed to include all the timber that had been
burned, for in that country a tree though slightly burned
would be worm-eaten inside of a year unless cut—I started
out with Wirth the next morning to find, if we could, just
how far the fire had extended east and west and to look up
a site for a camp to replace the Mulvaney Camp which had
burned. We found that the fire had taken a course
similar to that of a cyclone, about three miles in width and
about twenty miles in length, extending from a point four
miles south and west of Cedar Lake Dam, crossing the narrows
between Cedar Lake and Hemlock up the east shore
of Cedar Lake to a point about opposite Stoutâs Island, and
then north to the shores of Big Chetak just west of the
Aronson Camp in Section 4—in all an area of about seventeen
miles in length and two to four miles in width.

Father and L. S. Tainter arrived the next day and after
looking over the site for the new camp we came back to the
scene of our experience of a few days before. We had about
reached the point when father turned to me saying, âJohn,
did I understand you to say you were here during this fire?â
I answered âYes.â He looked at me for a moment with,
you will remember, that peculiar squint of his and then he
said, âJohn, you lie, for no man could have been here when
this fire passed and lived to tell the tale.â Nevertheless we
were there, and are still living.

BANKERSâ AID IN 1861-62
[2]

By Louise P. Kellogg

When the news of the firing upon Fort Sumter aroused the
North, all eyes were turned upon New York, not only as the
monetary center of the country, but as a city most closely allied
in financial interests with the South. The moneyed men of
that city responded to the countryâs danger. Upon the stock
exchange cheers were given for Major Anderson, and April
17, 1861, resolutions were passed pledging the loyalty of the
institution to the government. Anderson and his command
from Fort Sumter reached New York on April 18, and on
Saturday, April 20, a monster mass-meeting was held in
Union Square, where five speakerâs stands had been erected.
The resolutions adopted at this meeting not only pledged the
loyalty of the city, but provided for a Union Defense Committee,
comprising thirty of the most prominent financiers
and bankers headed by General John A. Dix, recently secretary
of the treasury under President Buchanan. The mayor
and the comptroller of the city were ex-officio members of
this committee. The city council appropriated $1,000,000
for the immediate needs of the New York troops, and raised
the funds by the sale of Union Defense bonds. The Committee
of Union Defense acted ex-officio as a federal agent,
attending to the equipment and dispatching of regiments,
purchasing steamers for transportation, feeding and sheltering
the troops, without waiting for the action of the federal
authorities. At one time three members of the committee
were entrusted with $2,000,000 federal money without security
or compensation. By these means the Seventh New York

Pg 26

Regiment was dispatched for the protection of Washington,
and other troops were moved toward the front. The Union
Defense Committee was maintained for about one year. Its
later duties were concerned with the care of funds raised for
the benefit of the volunteers and their families. It collected
and disbursed for this purpose about $1,000,000.

Meanwhile the city banks were loyally endeavoring to
prevent a financial crisis. April 25, 1861 they determined
to hold all their specie as a common fund, this being a precautionary
measure to sustain public confidence. There were
in New York City fifty-four banks with a capital of
$69,907,000. Much of their paper was held in the southern
states, where debts to northern holders were quickly repudiated.
Nevertheless, in the entire state of New York only
five banks suspended during 1861, and none of these in New
York City.

Following the example of New York, the banks of Boston
and Philadelphia pooled all their cash reserves. The Boston
banks, of which there were forty-two, with a capital of
$38,231,000, and which had a clearing-house system, aided in
preventing an immediate panic.

Western banks were less well prepared to meet the
emergency. Most of them held southern state bonds as the
basis of their currency system. During 1861 bank after
bank went to the wall, and the notes of others depreciated
with startling rapidity.

All the banks of that period were either state banks or
private banking concerns. The national banking-system did
not come into being until 1863. The first (though indirect)
aid furnished by the banks in the national crisis of 1861 was
the preservation of their own integrity, and therewith the
entire credit system of the North, from collapse. This was
accomplished through the instrumentality of the banks of
the three chief cities of the East—New York, Boston, and
Philadelphia. In the West, a few banks in Cincinnati, Chicago,

Pg 27

and Milwaukee were strong enough to support the situation,
even while the larger part of the western banks went to
the wall.

The direct aid furnished by the banks and bankers of the
country to the state and federal governments during the early
years of the Civil War may be classified under the three heads
of contributions, loans, and agencies.

CONTRIBUTIONS

The call for troops awoke a patriotic fervor in many
hearts, which led to an offering of money as well as of men.
In this outpouring of gifts the bankers took their part, some
giving as individuals, many in the name of their institutions.
No complete record of these patriotic contributions is available.

Harperâs Weekly
of May 25, 1861, estimated that the
individual gifts of more than $1,000 from counties, cities,
societies, corporations, and other organizations totaled
$27,000,000.

LOANS

The first necessity was that of temporary loans for both
the state and federal governments.

Temporary loans to states.
Patriotic impulse prompted
the immediate offering of loans by the banks. In Massachusetts
the bankers of Boston tendered the state government
a loan up to ten per cent of their combined capital. In
Illinois the banks of Springfield offered the state $100,000
on the day Lincoln called for troops. This was supplemented
by the Chicago banksâ tender of $500,000. Throughout the
early days of the war the banks in all localities were called
upon for loans on the credit of the state. These were funded
at seven per cent, then the usual interest for such transactions.

Temporary loans to the federal government.
The
treasury of the United States was in a desperate condition
at the outbreak of the Civil War. Lacking resources even
for its daily needs, it was totally unprepared for the great

Pg 28

strain immediately placed upon it. Secretary Chase did not
have recourse to the bankers, however, until after the battle
of Bull Run in July had proved that the war was not to be an
affair of âthree months.â

On the day that the news of the defeat at Bull Run
reached Philadelphia, a young banker recently removed to
that city from Ohio, an ardent partisan of Secretary Chase,
drew up a paper offering to advance to the Secretary of the
Treasury specified sums for sixty days at six per cent interest,
returnable in specie or interest-bearing treasury notes.
With this proposal he visited the principal banks and financial
houses in his city, and raised for immediate government needs
nearly $2,000,000 in one day. Chase was interested and
grateful, and the fortunes of Jay Cooke, the young banker,
were made from that day.

Early in 1862, when the governmentâs daily needs were
increasing enormously, John J. Cisco, assistant treasurer
of the sub-treasury at New York, made arrangements for a
loan from the city banks of their temporarily idle funds.
These were received on deposit for thirty days, subject to
withdrawal thereafter on ten daysâ notice. At first Cisco by
this means secured much specie at four per cent; later, five and
six per cent were paid for these advances. This money was
largely used for the payment of the interest on the public
debt. One banker in New York, it is said, became uneasy
after lending the sub-treasury $1,000,000, and demanded its
return. Cisco told him to send his carts for it immediately.
The next day his faith in the government was restored and
he concluded to leave his reserve with the sub-treasurer.

An instance of immediate aid to the governmentâs foreign
diplomats is related in the biography of the late J. Pierpont
Morgan. Morgan was in London on business for his house
at a time when Charles Francis Adams was endeavoring to
prove to the English government that certain vessels fitting
in British ports were intended for Confederate privateers.

Pg 29

The officials were slow to accept Adamsâ proofs, and he was
much alarmed lest the commerce-destroyers should get to sea
before he had succeeded in having an embargo placed on
their departure. The British authorities finally agreed to
detain the ships on condition that Adams should deposit
Â£1,000,000 guarantee to indemnify the government should
the owners not prove to be Confederates. Adams was in a
dilemma: he could not well refuse such a proposition, but long
before he could receive the money from America the cruisers
would be at sea. He tried to borrow on his personal credit
from London bankers, only to be rebuffed. Young Morgan
heard of the situation, sought the ambassador, and promised
to deliver $5,000,000 in gold into his hands in two days, asking
only his personal receipt in return, while stipulating absolute
secrecy concerning his patriotic action. In this wise two of
the commerce-destroyers were detained in port, and the
integrity of the American ambassador was vindicated.

Secured, or long-time, loans to states.
Upon the news of
the firing on Fort Sumter and the subsequent call for troops
every northern legislature then in session appropriated a fund
for war purposes. Indiana, for example, voted $500,000 for
arms and equipment, and $100,000 for a contingent fund.
Connecticut made an issue of $800,000 of war bonds. These
funds were raised in various ways. In Massachusetts and
Connecticut they were offered for popular subscription and
sold at par. The western states placed their bonds on the
New York stock market, where in many cases they sold at
a considerable discount. Where the stateâs credit was poor,
and its banking-system insecure, the bonds could not be placed,
and were recalled after being offered. Such was the case with
Iowa and Wisconsin. Ohio recalled its bonds, after they had
been advertised in New York, when it was learned that the
federal government assumed all war expenses, and would
refund these to the states.

Pg 30

Wisconsin adopted an ingenious plan, suggested to the
State Bankersâ Association by Alexander Mitchell. The
state banks had deposited with the state comptroller securities
for their currency issues. The larger proportion of these
securities was made up of the bonds of the southern or border
states. Those of the secession states were considered worthless,
while those of Missouri, large holdings of which were
in Wisconsin, declined rapidly. The comptroller, as required
by law, made assessments upon the state banks, which they
found it difficult to meet. Mitchell proposed that the banks
should purchase the bonds of the state war fund at par, and
that the comptroller should accept them for the assessments.
In this wise the credit of the state was improved and the
currency secured. The details of the arrangement were that
the banks took $800,000 of the war-fund bonds, seventy per
cent of which was paid at once, three-fifths in specie and two-fifths
in sound currency. The remaining thirty per cent was
to be met in fifteen annual installments. The adoption of
this expedient furnished the state with ready money, placed
the banking currency on a sound foundation, and restored
confidence to the community. Wisconsinâs banks resumed
specie payments at the date fixed by law, December 1, 1861,
and maintained them for some time after the New York
banks had suspended such payments.

On the basis of these war-fund appropriations state agents
flocked to New York to arrange for the purchase of war
material. Arms and ammunition had to be largely secured
from Europe. The New York banks arranged these transactions,
and furnished exchange and information. The competition
between the several state agents and those of the
federal government raised prices inordinately. This was
remedied when the federal government assumed full responsibility
for all equipment.

The federal loans.
The most important function of the
banks was the aid they furnished the Secretary of the

Pg 31

Treasury in floating the great federal loans that were required
by the war necessities. The special session of Congress which
met in July, 1861, appropriated $250,000,000 for the immediate
needs of the government, leaving large latitude with the
Secretary of the Treasury as to the method by which this
amount was to be raised.

The defeat at Bull Run put a very serious strain on the
credit of the United States, and the forced sale of securities
in a foreign market would have been disastrous to the future
conduct of the war. In the dilemma in which he was placed,
Secretary Chase paid a visit to New York, where Cisco, the
assistant treasurer, invited the prominent financial authorities
to meet him for consultation. Chase frankly stated the serious
nature of the situation, and requested assistance and advice.
From the standpoint of policy this was a wise measure, since
previous to this time the New York bankers had held somewhat
aloof from the operations of the federal treasury. Their
prompt support at this crisis is to their perpetual credit, for
although they largely profited in the end by this government
connection, at the time of the operation the transactions were
of daring boldness. The banks realized that without a firm
government their own operations were imperiled, and thus
they risked their all to support the government in its crisis.

At the first conference George E. Coe, president of the
Exchange Bank, proposed an association to subscribe for the
government loan. A committee appointed to develop a plan
reported on August 15 for thirty-nine New York banks.
Representatives from Boston and Philadelphia were likewise
present, and the loan was apportioned among the three cities
in accordance with the bank capital of each; that is, seventy
per cent was to come from New York, twenty per cent from
Boston, and ten per cent from Philadelphia. The association
thus formed agreed to take immediately $50,000,000 of treasury
bonds payable in three years with interest at seven and
three-tenths per cent. This rate, representing a payment of

Pg 32

two cents a day on each one hundred dollars loaned, had been
adopted by Secretary Chase in the hope of popularizing the
bonds with the people. The banks composing the association
were to pay over to the sub-treasuries of the three cities in
specie ten per cent of the amount subscribed; the remainder
was to be placed to the credit of the United States upon the
books of the subscribing institutions. Meanwhile the bonds
were to be offered to the people, both by the banks and the
sub-treasurers, and no other United States securities were to
be sold, except in Europe, while these subscriptions were being
solicited. The associated banks also agreed to float a similar
loan of $50,000,000 in October—if it had not by that time
been taken by popular subscription—and another $50,000,000
in December.

This was the largest financial operation that had ever been
attempted in the United States. Its successful accomplishment
at that time was of the greatest possible value in maintaining
public confidence, and in uniting the fortunes of the
financiers with those of the federal government. It was a
tribute to the organizing ability as well as to the patriotism
of the founders of the bank association. The capital of the
united banks was but $120,000,000, and their coin assets only
$63,000,000. Their subscription to $150,000,000 of government
securities was thus an act of faith.

In practice this agreement did not work out as the bankers
had hoped. Chase refused to suspend the sub-treasury act,
though authorized to do so by Congress, in order that the
banks might pay the governmentâs creditors in clearing-house
certificates; thus the specie began draining away from the
banks into the sub-treasuries. The Secretary also began the
issue of demand notes on the treasury in considerable amounts.
Moreover, the public sales were less than had been anticipated.
The bankers were accused of attempting to dictate to the
government concerning the conduct of the war. The inevitable

Pg 33

result of all this friction was the suspension of specie payments
by the New York banks December 30, 1861.

With the immense strain upon the governmentâs resources,
the catastrophe of suspension would no doubt have occurred
sooner or later; but financial historians believe that had Secretary
Chase been more willing to accept the bankersâ propositions,
had he coÃ¶perated with them more fully, the financing
of the Civil War might have wrought less damage in the
business world than it did.

AGENCIES

During the sale of the $150,000,000 bond issue Secretary
Chase appointed a large number of agents in every part of
the United States to secure the popular subscriptions. Most
of these were presidents of local banks. The agents were
allowed a commission of one-fifth of one per cent on the first
$100,000, and one-eighth on later amounts. One hundred and
fifty dollars was allowed for advertising purposes. A traveling
agent went through the West, arranging for local agencies
and assisting in advertising. It was proposed to allow the
country bankers a larger commission with a view to stimulating
wide sales, but this proposal the Secretary of the Treasury
declined to adopt.

The western agents were not very successful in promoting
this loan. Jay Cooke, of Philadelphia, sold more than
one-fourth of all the bonds issued to the agents; but, in order
to do so, spent more than the amount of his commission in
advertising.

Secretary Chase became much interested in the measures
adopted by this Philadelphia banker. As more and more
pressure was put upon him for funds, he often consulted with
Cooke, and frequently permitted the latter to buy United
States securities to buoy up a falling market. On October
23, 1862 Chase appointed Jay Cooke sole agent for the conversion
of legal tender treasury notes into the $500,000,000

Pg 34

six per cent five-twenty bonds authorized by Act of Congress
February 25, 1862. By advertising on a larger scale than
had hitherto been known, and by employment of 2,500 sub-agents,
mostly bank presidents, in every part of the North,
Jay Cooke accomplished his enormous task, the loan being
finally over-subscribed by $11,000,000. His commission was
three-eighths of one per cent on the first $100,000,000, of
which one-eighth went to the sub-agent, and one-eighth to
advertising and to placating the public press. The loan was
sold in small denominations to every class of the population.
Cooke patriotically resisted all proposals to sell large blocks
of the bonds to European holders. He believed a bond issue
held by the people was the safest means of financing and of
prosecuting the war. He made the loan a great democratic
institution. It is not too much to say that his success in selling
this $500,000,000 bond issue âdispirited the South, gave
Europe â¦ useful evidence of the determined courage
and material wealth of the northern people, and was a factor
of vast importance in deciding the fate of the Union.â

DOCUMENTS

THE DIARY OF HARVEY REID: KEPT AT MADISON IN
THE SPRING OF 1861

With Introduction and Notes by Milo M. Quaife

The war time diary of Harvey Reid possesses elements
of permanent interest and value. Aside from this, however,
it should have a special interest now, when we are still passing
through the initial stage of another great war in behalf of
human liberty and human rights. With the events and emotions
of the past few months still fresh in mind, it is well to
relive with our eager diarist the opening scenes of the Civil
War at the capital of Wisconsin. Madison is an interesting
city, with a rich and interesting history; yet it would be impossible
to select, from all its eighty years of life, a period more
crowded with exciting events than were the three months of
April, May, and June, 1861. Fortunately a bright and eager
observer was at hand making his daily record of the thrilling
life of this exciting time.

Harvey Reid, the diarist, typifies the choicest product of
our American civilization. It was not given to him to play a
prominent rÃ´le in the drama of his time. Instead, he belonged
to the great mass of Americans, of whom, as individuals,
posterity will retain no memory. But he was honest, industrious,
and loyal, faithful to his country alike in military and
in civil life. Although his education was limited to the district
school, and to the ten-weeksâ preparatory course at the
University of Wisconsin covered by the diary, he retained
a lifelong interest in educational affairs, laboring effectively
for many years as school director and library trustee. His
intellectual vigor is attested by the fact that after reaching

Pg 36

his sixtieth year he began and diligently pursued the study
of geology. In the historical field two substantial volumes
stand to his credit—a biography of Enoch Long, published
by the Chicago Historical Society, and one of Thomas Cox,
published by the State Historical Society of Iowa.

Reid was born in Washington County, New York, March
30, 1842, of Scotch-Irish ancestry. When two years of age
he was taken by his parents to Wisconsin, the journey being
made by way of the Erie Canal and then around the Lakes to
Racine, which was reached in June, 1844. The elder Reid
shortly removed to Yorkville, and several years later to Union
Corners (now Union Grove) in Racine County. Thus Reid
grew to manhood in pioneer Wisconsin, and became in the
fullest sense a product of the Badger State. In 1859, at
the age of seventeen, he began teaching school in an adjoining
district at a salary of twenty dollars a month. A second
winter was passed in the same way (the summers being
devoted to helping his father), and then, in the spring of
1861, came the prized opportunity of ten weeksâ schooling
at the state university. How fully the young man improved
it the pages of the diary reveal.

Of the three room-mates in old North Hall from Union
Grove, in the spring of 1861, Goldsworthy, Fuller, and Reid,
only the first-named resumed his studies in the autumn. Reid
again taught a winter term of district school in Racine County,
and then followed his parents, who had removed to the new
town of Shannon, Illinois. But in the summer of 1862, in
response to Lincolnâs call for âsix hundred thousand more,â
he returned to Union Grove to enlist with a squad of boys
from the old home neighborhood. Characteristic of the conduct
of the Civil War is the fact that of the twenty-four
boys of the âUnion Grove Squad,â four died of disease, while
but one was killed in battle. Reid enlisted at Racine, August
7, 1862, in the Twenty-second Wisconsin Infantry. The

Pg 37

close of the war terminated his service in June, 1865. During
the war his father had removed to Sabula, Iowa. Following
him thither, on being released from the army, Reid made his
home in Jackson County, Iowa, until his death in 1910. He
played a worthy, albeit quiet, rÃ´le in life, and died sincerely
mourned by the circle of his acquaintances.

The Civil War papers of Mr. Reid were presented to the
State Historical Society of Wisconsin a year ago by his
daughter, Mary A. Reid of Des Moines. They comprise, in
addition to the diary here printed, a voluminous correspondence
during the term of military service, with parents and
sisters at home. At the beginning of his service Mr. Reid
formed the design of writing his home letters in the form of
a journal, instead of keeping, as so many Civil War soldiers
did, a formal diary. Because of this fact, and of the high
order of intelligence and ability possessed by the writer, the
letters constitute a valuable record, well worthy of publication
when the occasion shall offer.

Wednesday 27.
Went to the Capitol at noon the Assembly
were taking the final votes on the amendment to the
Banking Law. It finally passed with only five dissenting
voices. Several of the students visited us today, and invited
us to attend their Societies, of which there are two—the
Hesperian and the Atheneum. There appears to be considerable
rivalry between them. The meetings are on Friday
evening. John will stay with us tonight and probably always
after this.

Thursday, March 28, 1861.
Bought 28 tickets for
bread between us. Wrote a letter home describing our rooms

&c.
Went down town to the P. O. after 4. Nothing especial

Friday 29.
Saw the 2 wonderful clocks & the thermometer
[12]

this morning. Attended both Societies this evening—went
first into the Atheneum—they were discussing
the question, âthat the mentality of the sexes are equal.â a
spirited debate sprang up on a proposition to amend the question
by inserting âmental power,â instead of, âmentality.â
but it was lost. Heard Messrs. Norcross, Green & Salisbury
[13]

& another whose name I do not remember speak.

Pg 40

In the Hesperian they were discussing whether âthe war
of 1812 was justifiable on the part of the U. S.â it was
decided in the
aff.
Johnâs name & mine were presented for
admission.

Saturday 30.
After breakfast, about 8Â½ OâClock, Will
[14]

& I went across the lake to the Asylum. Had considerable
trouble in getting across a large crack in the ice in the middle
of the lake. On arriving on the shore found that the Asylum
folks were making sugar. An Irishman whom we found
there took us immediately to the engine rooms, and showed us
the gas works,—(retort & meter), the engines, a large wheel
with fans for driving air into the principal buildings, the
large force pump worked by steam, the laundry rooms, took
us through the underground passage which leads between
the two buildings. Found Uncle T. in the billiard rooms
where a crazy half breed & two others were playing. Uncle
T. looks quite healthy & appears somewhat better in mind
than when he left home. He took [us] all over the building—let [?]
into the ward in which he is—there we saw about a dozen
insane some sitting, some walking back & forth the length
of the hall, one lying down full length upon the floor, & 2
curled up in the window; one was a man named Jones, who
came from Racine
Co.
and had often been at
U. G.
He
had sometime been injured by a thrashing machine & showed
us a scar where one of his ribs had been taken out. One was
a preacherâs son, named Hall, he would speak to no one. One
had a violin which he commenced playing shortly after we
came in, and kept it up all the while we were there.

Uncle T. showed us in this ward, the water closet, where
opening the door caused water to run through the seats: the
bathing room, the reading room where they keep the daily
& other papers for patients to read. We were invited to
take dinner with the help. Mr. Griswold the keeper, told me
that Uncle T. has improved much; when he came there he
was a great bore. After dinner we went into the cooking
room where most things are cooked by steam.

Pg 41

We went out and visited the Indian mounds between the
Asylum & the beach. several are in the shape of men, and one
is a very accurate representation of a rabbit. We went
around the lake going home and had a pretty hard time of it.

Monday, April 1, 1861.
Yesterday all 3 of us attended
the
Cong.
Heard
Prof.
Butler
[15]
preach from John
XVIII.

38. Joined
Prof.
Conoverâs
[16]
Bible class in this church. In
the eve. went with about 20 of the other students to hear Mr.
Mason of the Universalist. His theme was the âmercy of
the Lord,â and his discourse was strongly Universalist.

To-day, after the regular routine of school duties, John
& I went down town about 5 oâclock so as to be at the depot
when the cars arrived, & see if C. White came he did not
arrive however, & we got home at 9 somewhat disappointed
and very tired John & I hired a P. O. box between us
No.

693.

Tuesday 2.
Went to the depot in the evening to meet
Mr. Bradford if he came, but were disappointed. Received
two letters from the Grove—one from C. & Billy White
[17]

& one from Libbie. It is the first I have heard from the Grove
since I have been here. Will also recd a letter.

No news of importance. It has been quite warm & thawing
all day.

Wednesday 3.
The sun rose clear and warm after a
frosty night, & as we were sitting by our open window, we
were startled by loud & frequent reports, which resembled
the discharge of cannon, but Will says it is the ice cracking
on the lake.

Went to the depot again to meet Bradford, but were again
disappointed. Made arrangements to have bread baked by a
woman near the
Univ.

Thursday, April 4, 1861.
The forenoon passed without
incident worthy of remark, except that when I rose in the

Pg 42

morning I had a very sore throat which I am afraid will
trouble me.

In the evening John & I again started for the depot to
meet Bradford, but the cars having arrived before we could
get there, we went to the Capitol to wait for him. He brought
Johnâs things and also some summer clothes & a letter for me
from Sarah. I sent several of the
Univ.
catalogues to our
Eastern friends

Friday 5.
By advice of Mr. Bradford I slept last night
with a wet towel bound round my throat & this morning it is
much better. Went down town after school, to the depot
after the things which Mr. B. broât & then to Mr. Whiteâs
with John to get some of his things. Did not get back in
time to be initiated into the Society tonight—attended both—the
Hesperian the most of the evening—The Hespâs discussed,
â
Res.
that a man should resist a law which his conscience
tells him is morally law [wrong].â decided in
aff.

The Athâs. discussed â
Res.
That the character of Queen
Elizabeth was worthy of emulation.â I dont know how it
was decided.

Rained
nearly
all
day
&
all
of the evening

Saturday 6.
Commenced with a rain storm, continued
with a rain storm, and ended with a rain storm, i. e. it rained
all day incessantly, which kept us in the house all of the time
until about 4 oâclock when John & I went down town to make
some purchases & there learned that 19
Wis.
banks had been
âthrown outâ & every bill I had ($8) was on them.
[18]
Wrote
a long letter home,—or rather, wrote one & commenced
another
—

Discredited money is worth 80 cts.

Monday, April 8, 1861.
Yesterday was a pleasant day
again—Went with a large company of students to hear
Prof.

Butler preach, it being the last time he is going to preach for

Pg 43

the present. His text was 1
Cor. XI
, 22, and a capital discourse.
Mr. Bradford was with us in
Prof.
Conoverâs Bible
Class. To-day is another rainy day The morning duties
passed as usual, at 3 oâclock, we were invited by some of the
boys to go to the City Hall & hear
Geo.
B. Smith
[19]
speak on
a lawsuit between Bird & Morrison The suit involves
$180,000. Mr. Morrison committed suicide last winter, it
is said because he had perjured himself in the suit. He was
the defât. Mr. Smith made a very able speech.

Tuesday 9.
The day passed as usual, i. e. a continual
rain storm. About 5 oâclock, went down town, and learned
by hand bills that Moses M. Strong would review a speech
of
Jno.
Y. Smith,
[20]
in the Assembly Chamber to-night. Went
to hear him—His speech was on the secession question, arguing
against war and a very sound effort.

A meeting was called after the speech & a resolution
introduced favoring Pres. Lincoln & the war policy, which,
after some talk pro & con, was laid on the table
[21]

Wednesday 10.
A pleasant day at last & the first one
really I have seen since I have been in Madison. Was out
with many others of the students playing on the green after
school.
Recâd
a letter from Couse & the
Adv.
from home.

Thursday, April 11, 1861.
Went to the P. O. about
5 OâClock and received a letter from Libbie. The âdiscredited

Wis.
moneyâ is down to 75 cents in many of the
stores.

Recâd
a letter from Libbie

Friday 12.
is the day for the Prep. Rhetorical Exercises
but our division does not come on this time. The declamations

Pg 44

& compositions were very good. At 4 oâclock went
down town. In the Assembly they were talking on the
Normal School Fund bill—which was passed. Several bills
were ordered to third reading. Went into the City Hall
tower & saw the clock, which struck while we were there. The
view of the city from this tower is the finest I have yet seen.

In the Hesp. Soc. the question, â
Res.
that the U. S. ought
to coÃ«rce the seceding states,â was decided in the
neg.

Hostilities in the South
comcâd
at 4 this morning.

Saturday 13.
Visited this
P. M.
the Mendota Foundry,
but there was nothing interesting going on. Went to the
Capitol & found the Assembly taking an informal recess
waiting for absentees. Mr. Bradford said he could go to
the University now. We first went into the State Treasurerâs
room saw Mr. Hastings—went also into the Secretary of
Stateâs office, & into the State Journal office where they were
printing by steam machinery.

Mr. Bradford visited our rooms & also saw Mr. Muirâs
clocks & other curiosities.

Monday, April 15, 1861.
Went to hear Mr. Taylor
[22]

the new
Cong.
minister, yesterday. He is a good preacher
but preached a doctrinal sermon from
Heb. II.
12. Learned
in
Prof.
Câs Bible class that Spirit in the original means wind.
Wrote a letter home for Mr. Bradford to carry.

In the Geometry recitation to-day the door of the recitation
room opened and an old man entered whom I immediately
recognized as Uncle Thompson. He said they had
brought him over from the asylum to go home with Mr. B.
but the Legislature had been reconvened by the Governor
on acct. of the war news & Mr. B. could not go & he wished
to go to Clinton to see Mr. Tinker, before he went home &
would like to go right along I obtained permission to leave
the class & accompanied him down town—sold my $5 bill for
.65
cts.
(but afterwards saw Mr. B. &
bowd
$3). carried his
trunk to the depot and saw him safely off. Went with John
into the country & got his straw bed filled & helped him carry
it home, as we expected Charlie W. to-night. Went to the
depot at 10Â½
P. M.
but he did not come.

Pg 45

Tuesday 16th.
Charlie came on the 3:45 train to-day.
He brot packages from home for each of us—my linen coat
& shaving tools & a letter. We took him into the
Hist. Soc.
,
then into the Assembly, & saw Mr. Bradford, who came to the
University & took supper with us The Legislature held a
session this evening which we all attended. A Banking law
was passed a part of the debate on which we heard in the
Senate.

Wednesday 17.
Charlie heard the Algebra & Geometry
classes & we also went to
Prof.
Carrâs
[23]
room & heard part of
his lecture on Coral. At noon John & I were excused from
further recitations & went with C. down town. the Legislature
had adjourned & gone home. We found that books had
been opened in the
Gov.
Guards Armory in the City Hall for
receiving enlistments for the Southern army & that about
Â½ a dozen of the
Univ.
boys had enlisted.

The city is in a great military excitement

Thursday, April 18, 1861.
Found that there were seven
of the boys enlisted yesterday—Curtis, Frost, Wyse, High,
Norcross, A. G. Miller & Reed & Bull
[24]
—but High was not
accepted being under 17.

A meeting of citizens being called for tonight to provide
for the maintenance of the families of those enlisting, we
attended it at the Assembly Chamber, the chamber was
crowded as full as they could stand, & the most enthusiastic
meeting I ever attended. They commenced the meeting
with singing the Star Spangled Banner, & then received subscriptions.

Pg 46

Men would get up & offer various sums as they
were able—$500, 400, 200, 100 50 25 & 10 $7,490 were
subscribed altogether. The citizens then escorted the
Gov.

Guards to their Armory, under the marshalship of
Gen.

Atwood.
[25]

Friday 19.
In the Prep. Rhetorical Exercises this
P. M.

I read a composition—âAmerica & Italyâ—John—âThe
Discovery of the Mississippiâ—& Will a declamation—âThe
true vigor in government.â In the Hesperian Soc. tonight
the question was, â
Res.
that expatriation is a natural right.â
decided in the
aff.
While the Debate was going on, Curtis,
Bull & Wyse, of the University Volunteers entered the room
& were greeted with tremendous applause—After the
Soc.

had adjourned it was organized into a meeting, to express
the feelings of the members on the war question,—Norcross
having just entered was loudly called for &
recâd
with uproarious
cheering. The other volunteers, Bull, Curtis &
Wyse also expressed their feelings in regard to the cause in
which they had engaged, after which the principal members
of the Society were called upon—Clawson, Allen, Ball, H.
Vilas, M. Leahy, Parkinson Jr.,
[26]
two from town—Brush
& Lockwood, Wallace,
[27]
and another volunteer belonging to

Pg 47

the Atheneans—E. G. Miller—spoke, & the enthusiasm was
roused to the highest pitch. Then went into the Athenean
where the same kind of exercises were being held, & heard
Bull, Leahy, Ball, Church & Silverthorne
[28]
speak after which
the meeting adjourned at 12Â½ oâclock with three rousing
cheers for the University Volunteers.

Sat. 20th.
The boys held a meeting at 4
P. M.
for
the purpose of organizing a military company here, but as we
went fishing, we could not attend. Curtis has left the
Gov.

Guards, having
recâd
a letter from home forbidding him to
go. Wrote a letter home.

Monday, April 22, 1861.
Got ready to go to the Presbyterian
Church yesterday
A. M.
but it was so late when we got
ready that we concluded not to go. Wrote a letter to Uncle
Edward. In the evening went to the Baptist Church &
heard
Wm.
Henry Brisbane, Jr., preach. Mr. B. is one of
the volunteers in the war, & as he is going with his company
this was his farewell sermon—His text was—
St.
Luke 22:36.
& his subject our duty towards our government. He is a mere
boy and his sermon was not remarkably sound. He wore his
military dress in the pulpit Attack on Ft. Pickens—news
came 21st.

2
22d.
. Meeting of
Univ.
Guards this
P. M.
at 4 oâclock,
when we
U. G.
boys joined it. They are about giving it up
however, as it is not likely that they can get drill master from
town. Drilled a while on the grounds by Campbell, a volunteer
& Marsh,
[29]
a student.

Tuesday 23.
The
Univ.
Guards again met this
P. M.
&
the committee appointed at the first meeting, having reported
yesterday that they had been unable to procure the services
of a drill-master or arms, but that there was a company of
young men organizing down town in which the students
would have the first chance in joining
&c.
; they were instructed
at yesterdays meeting to ascertain the terms of enlisting

&c.
& report today. They reported that the
Co.
would
be organized there, and the boys could join without expense.
& the boys having nearly all previously joined it, the
Univ.

Pg 48

Guards were disbanded. The Volunteers will start tomorrow
& it was voted that we go to the depot in a body and see them
off.

Wednesday 24.
On going to the Geometry recitation
at 11 OâClock, John & I found that we were the only
ones there the rest of the boys having gone down town to see
the soldiers off. We also got excused then. & went to the
Capitol Park, where we found the Artillery
Co.
with their
guns, & both the Fire
Co
âs preparing to accompany the
soldiers to the depot. At Â½ past 12 the procession started.
The Madison Guards were accompanied by the German
Turner Society, the
Govâs
Guards by a procession of citizens
& the sidewalks were crowded with a dense throng the whole
length of the procession. Arriving at the depot the soldiers
were addressed by Judge Vilas,
[30]
&
Gov.
Randall
[31]
& the Star

Three cars were standing on the track which the soldiers filled
about 10 minutes before the time of starting & then bid goodby
to their friends, Norcross & Bull of the

it well, but Miller, Wyse & Smith were much affected. The
boys drilled down town this evening, but as we could not get
our supper on time to go with them, we did not get there till
they had got through.

saw two companies of soldiers who have arrived to rendevous
with the
2d.
Regiment at Camp Randall (the Fair Grounds)
They were the La Crosse Light Guard & the Portage
Light Guard. They were both partially uniformed & armed,
& seemed pretty well drilled. They marched to camp, selected
their quarters, then marched to the general mess room & partook
of a warm supper.

Purchased a copy of the
Wkly
Journal & sent [it] home.

Pg 50

Thursday, May 2, 1861.
The Beloit Guards arrived today
They are without uniform or arms but a very fine looking
company. Followed them to the camp but there was
nothing going on there.

Before they came, Will & I went to the depot, expecting
them but as they would not come for some time we walked
on south from the depot & visited the ridge between Lakes
Monona & Wingra This is a very high ridge & the top is
covered with Indian mounds of all kinds & sizes. The Roman
Catholic Cemet[e]ry is on the side hill, & we also visited it.
Saw an Indian canoe in a dooryard on the way. Was told
it belongs to Dr. Hunt.

Friday 3.
On awakening this morning found that it was
raining smartly, & it continued to do so until about noon when
it turned into snow & did not clear off until nearly evening.
In the
Rhet.
Exercise today I declaimed the extract from
Judge Storyâs oration, âOur duties to the Republic,â Will
read âLetter from Jef. Davis.â John spoke âMen always fit
for freedomâ—Macauley—Going down town after school we
learned that the âBelle City Riflesâ
[35]
arrived this morning
at 4. but we could not go to the camp after the late hour
at which we returned—Athenean—Universal Suffrage question—Hesperian—Polygamy,
laws against
—

Saturday 4.
We all visited the camp this
A. M.
Saw the
Belle City Rifles & was very much surprised at seeing
Geo.

Lincoln
[36]
in the ranks. He is the only acquaintance with
them. Fat Sheldon,
[37]
whom I have often seen before, was
with them however.

The Oshkosh Guards and the Citizens Guards of Fox
Lake having arrived this
P. M.
went to the camp to see them.
Staid till 8 OâClock & had considerable difficulty in passing
the guard.

Sunday, May 5, 1861.
Attended church at the Methodists
to day. Did not hear the name of the preacher. Text—Romans
14:7. Rained during the whole of the service & we
had a fine run through the rain to the
Cong.
Church to
attend Bible class. Visited the camp in the
P. M.
George

Pg 51

had been on guard most of the day. Were kept there by the
rain until nearly dark. & thereby were again made prisoners
of war.

May 6th.
Went down to camp again this
P. M.
Nothing
of consequence occurred only that we were stopped by
the guard again and had to be passed out by the corporal.
They are very strict after 6 oâclock.

Tuesday 7.
John and I went down town after school,
& Will went to Camp Randall. When we came back we
went down there too, but were refused admittance as they
had made a rule that no one should be allowed in after 6
oâclock. While we were standing there, Will & George came
to the gate and we shook hands with G. over the soldierâs
bayonet.

Wednesday 8.
The Trigonometry Class in which Will
is, procured the instruments to day and were practicing surveying.

At 3 oâclock I went out with them and saw them take
angles for measuring the height of University Hall. It
proved to be 115.838 feet, if their work is correct.

Visited the camp again, Mr. Durand was there, and after
the soldiers supper the Bible [Belle] City Rifles were
marched to the Fine Arts Hall hill and drawn up in a line
to hear a speech from him. He endeavored to persuade them
all to remain with the
Co.
as an order has been
rec
d
that they
must now enlist for 3 years or during the war, which many
refuse to do.

Thursday, May 9, 1861.
Will & I procured a boat after
school and went out on the lake to try & get some fish. After
being out two hours we speared one little
bull head
which we
gave to the owner of the boat and agreed to go out with him
to night and furnish light for him to fish. Started at 8, was
out till 10 & caught two fish both of which we gave the boat
owner.

Received a letter announcing the death of P. P. Taber.

Friday 10.
Our fishing excursion caused us to oversleep
ourselves, and when there was a loud rapping at our door
about 15 minutes before 6, it did not wake me enough to
comprehend what it was: but in about Â½ an hour afterwards

Pg 52

Mr. Wildish
[38]
again came to our room and brot a box which
he said a gentleman had left for me. I saw by the name on
the box it was Seth Rice who had brot it from home. Thus
by my sleepiness I missed seeing an acquaintance from
U. G.

John & I took a walk in the
N. E.
part of the town, past

Gov.
Farwellâs Octagon house, & visited the Cemetery.
Attended Societyâs meetings.

Saturday 11.
Nothing particular going on until evening
when the Hesperian celebrated the anniversary of the
Dedication of their new Hall. Ball read a humorous poem,
Baker declaimed âThe Gray Forest Eagle,â and Allen

Monday, May 13, 1861.
Attended Methodist Church
yesterday. Was too late to hear the text. Mr Yokem
preached. attended Bible Class. Wrote letter home—took
it to P. O. in the evening & attended Baptist Church. Was
again too late to hear the text but Mr. Brisbane preached a
very fine sermon. His subject was the natural depravity
of man.

Nothing happened on Monday worthy of note.

Tuesday 14.
This is Library day. Took out
Vols.
1st
& 2nd of Smithsonian Cont. to Knowledge, treating of Indian
Mounds & other American Antiquities. Had one of
the same books last week which contained I. A. Laphamâs
[42]

account of the mounds in Wisconsin which was very interesting.
Went to the P. O. but received nothing. Went into

Pg 53

the Assembly Chamber to try & find out if Mr. Bradford
had come but he had not. The Chamber is all ready to
receive its occupants tomorrow.

Wednesday 15.
Went to the Capitol at 3
OâClk

Assembly was in session, but almost immediately adjourned.
Mr. Bradford has not arrived yet. As Will & I were Coming
home again we were hailed from the opposite side of the
street and looking up saw H. Foster, T. Graham & Alex.
Adams
[43]
who have joined the B. C. Rifles in place of those
who refused to enlist for three years. they told us that W.
White was also with them & had [been] to the
Univ.
with
G. L. to look for us. Went home & found them there. They
left the Grove Sunday.

Had a fish for supper tonight & borrowed Holt & Blackâs
cooker.

Wrote a composition for Friday.

Thursday, May 16, 1861.
Mr Bradford arrived on the
4
OâClk
train this morning. He came to the
Univ.
at 7 &
brot letters for all of us & told [us] there were
pkges
at the
depot for us. Went & got them at noon & found there were
cakes, pies, butter & a chicken, & a dressing gown for me,
which, however, proved too large. Went to camp after
school, and found that I Martyne & H. Ginty
[44]
were with
the new recruits. 2 Zouaves were on the grounds (one,
dressed in full uniform) who entertained the regiment with
specimens of their drill. Went down town about 5. & met
Mr. Bradford there.

Friday 17.
In the Rhetorical Exercises I read a composition—âPolitical
Partiesâ—Will a composition—âA Great
Discoveryâ John obtained an excuse, as he expected his
mother on the cars. After school we washed out the floor of
our rooms, which took so long that, as we had to go down town
for victuals, I did not attend the Societyâs meeting at all.

Saturday 18.
Mrs. Goldsworthy arrived at 4
OâClk

this morning. Went to the Capitol at 11. Assembly had

Monday, May 20, 1861.
Yesterday commenced with a
heavy [rain] which continued till about 9 OâClock when Billy
White &
Wm.
Sheldon of Burlington came from Camp
Randall. On account of the very wet weather and also because
our visitors did not wish to go I did not go to church
in the
A. M.
& as it rained all
P. M.
I could not go then. The
boys staid till nearly evening. John was at Mr. Whiteâs
nearly all day with his mother. Wrote a letter home last

[48]
speak.

Pg 55

After the adjournment went to the camp, & returning to
the
Univ.
took a bathe in the lake.

Wednesday 22.
The Sophs & Freshs got a rich joke on
the Seniors this morning. They had bills printed last night
composed in Artemus Ward style, purporting to be an advertisement
for their lost cushions, and this morning they posted
[them] in the most conspicuous places around the University
& down town. Went to the Capitol immediately after school.
The Assembly were engaged in a very animated discussion
on a proposition that the enlistments should be divided proportionally
among the
Cong. dists.
It was lost. I went with
Mr. B. to Camp & witnessed the dress parade of the
Regt.

John & I subscribed for the State Journal for 3 mos.

Thursday, May 23, 1861.
The Assembly this
P. M.

were discussing a banking law, but it not being interesting
I did not stay long. Went to the Post Office & from there
to the Journal to read the news. They keep there a file of
all the City dailies free to the public.

Friday 24.
Mr. Bradford visited us in our rooms at noon
today. He said the Milwaukee Zouaves, having arrived at
7 OâClock this morning would drill at 2Â½. and the Legislature
had adjourned to witness it. He attended our Latin
recitation & then we all went down to camp with him. The
Zouave maneuvers proved very interesting & we staid till
the troops went to supper at 5Â½ OâClock, then went to the
P. O. George was on guard at the gate. Judge Larrabee,
[49]

being on the grounds was pointed out to us by Mr. B.

Saturday 25.
Went to the Capitol at 11 OâClock. The
Senate had under consideration the war loan bill, which originated
in the
Ass.
15 amendments adopted by
Sen.
3 of
them non-concurred by
Assem.
2 receded from by Sen. &
the
3d.
. was that the loan should be taken & soldiers paid in

Pg 56

coin.
Sen.
Gill moved that the Senate
adhere
to this amendment.
A. I. Bennett said this was unusual & would be very
discourteous to the
Assem.
as no Com. of Conference could
be appointed if it were adopted.
Sen.
Hutchinson moved to
amend that they
insist
instead of
adhere
. After warm discussion
by Gill, Maxon, & Joiner, & Virgin, Hutchinson,
A. I. Bennett & Hazelton it was carried that they adhere.
On coming up in the
Assem.
this action of the
Sen.
was
denounced by Frisby, Webb, Atwood, Spooner, D. H. Johnson
& Hicks
[50]
& the
Assem.

insisted
on their non-concurrence
& asked a Com. of Conference, which was granted by the
Senate & they proposed a bill which passed.

Monday, May 27, 1861.
Attended the
Cong.
Church
yesterday. Mr. Taylorâs Text was John

In the
P. M.
the wind blew from the South a perfect gale.
Wrote home & sent the letter with Mr. Bradford.

To-day went to the depot at noon to see Mr. Bradford off.
After school went to the camp. The exercises on evening
parade are changed today. Saw the maneuvers gone through
with by
Capts.
Strongâs & Randolphâs Cos.
[51]
united but could
not wait until the regular parade

Tuesday 28.
Nothing worthy of note transpired to-day.

Wednesday 29.
Seth Rice visited us today on his return
from Richland
Co.
where he has been about three weeks.
The train on which he came does not stop at the station
(Stoughton) where he wishes to stop & he therefore lays
over at Madison till the 4 oâclock train tomorrow morning.

He arrived about 4 oâclock & soon I went to the camp
with him & we staid till after the evening parade. The exercise
at this time now is—the companies form in line with their
arms, come to parade rest. The band plays a tune & marches

Pg 57

in front of the regiment the whole length of the line & back
again—the gun is fired and the flag comes down—The
Adj.

announces to the
Col.
âthe Parade is formed â The
Col
put
them through the Manual. The Sergeants report they
are dismissed.

Thursday, May 30, 1861.
Got up before 4 oâclock this
morning to see Mr. Rice off. As we were sitting in our room
at noon, the door opened and Charlie White entered without
any previous announcement even the ceremony of knocking.
After attending our Latin recitation we went with him to
the camp. He had not previously heard that Billie was
here. We staid till after parade & then John & I went down
town purchased some meat, & when we got home borrowed a
cooker & had a warm supper.

Friday 31.
As we could not prevail on Charlie to stay
here until Monday we obtained excuse from recitations today,
hired a boat and went over to the Asylum with him. Visited
all the places we had seen when there before and also were
shown into the lower ward, and womenâs ward. The wind
having risen & blowing from the
S. W.
—âalmost directly
ahead—we concluded it would be impossible to row 4 back
in the small boat which we had, so John & Charlie went round
the lake afoot and Will & I rowed across. We went first to
Sugar Bush point, where sheltered by the point, from the
wind we tried to catch some fish but did not succeed. After
starting for home the wind blew so hard that we could not
make an inch headway but a rain coming up the wind ceased.

Saturday, June 1.
Charlie went home at 10 oâclock last
night, via Milwaukee.

John & I took our hooks & went on the
R. R.
bridge to
fish but could catch nothing. But Will & I went out with a
Dutchman in the evening and speared 7 in all—â1 pickerel,
1 sucker, 2 bass & 3 bull heads. We took the sucker and
pickerel & had them for dinner the next day.

Sunday, June
2
d
Attended the Presbyterian Church
today & Prof Câs Bible Class. Mr. Green had one of the most
interesting sermons I ever listened to. He had four texts—
Lev.
X.
1. 2 & 3. The other three I have forgotten. Wrote
a letter home in the
P. M.

Pg 58

Monday, June 3, 1861.
Going down town at noon today
we learned by the dispatch on the Patriot bulletin board &
by the crape hung around some of the stores, the sad intelligence
of the death of Judge Douglas.
[52]
All of the flags in
the city are at half mast and cannon are being fired every
half hour till sundown at the Capitol & at Camp Randall.
A meeting of the citizens was called for tonight, which we
attended.
Gov.
Randall was appointed
Chân
& made a very
affecting & pertinent speech. A committee was appointed
to draft resolutions & speeches were made by E. A. Calkins,
G. B. Smith, L. P. Harvey, M. H. Orton,—Gregory, &
Col.

Fairchild, & Chauncey Abbott.
[53]

Tuesday 4.
Went to the camp after school, to witness
the parade. The boys say that a telegram was
recâd
by
Gov.

Randall today from the
Secây
of War ordering the
2d..
&
3d.

Regtâs.
to Wash. as soon as they can be got ready, and they
will probably go Monday. They have commenced having battalion
drills today but, as they occur at three oâclock we can
never see them. The flags are still flying at half mast and
the com officers all wear crape on their left arms for 10 days.

Wednesday 5.
An accident occurred on the
R. R.
last
night. An axle of a freight car broke in crossing the bridge
over the lake, threw the train off the track, and tore up the
track and ties for some distance. It was a very dangerous
accident as it occurred on the open bridge over quite deep
water; but, fortunately, no one was injured. We finished
the review of Geometry today, and now take propositions

Pg 59

promi[s]cuously anywhere in the book so as to be more thoroughly
prepared for examination. We also commence today
to review Latin. Went to the P. O. after school.

Thursday, June 6, 1861.
Visited the camp this evening
during parade. Heard that they nearly had a mutiny last
night. The sentry at the gun challenged the âgrand roundsâ
when the officer not giving the countersign right he pricked
him with his bayonet when his gun was snatched away from
him and he âpitched inâ to the officer with his fists for which
he was put into the guard house, which the
Capt.
of his
compây

(La Crosse) having heard, he ordered him to be taken out;
that not being done he ordered his company to charge bayonets
& the whole regât being roused they broke into the g.
house & released the man & also all other prisoners who were
there.

Friday 7.
There were no Rhetorical Exercises today,
as in the two weeks before examination students are supposed
to be preparing for that event and cannot perform this extra
duty. âGot stuckâ on a sum in Algebra today, but mean to
stick to it till I get it out.

Went down to the P. O. after school

Saturday 8.
The ladies of Madison gave the soldiers
a picnic today. The tables in the âOperative Machineryâ
room were spread with bread, butter pies, cakes & sweatmeats,
to which the boys did ample justice after which came
speeches, music by the brass band, singing of Star
Sp.
Banner,
and dispersion. The parade was formed almost immediately
after the supper and all present witnessed it.
Recâd

letter from home enclosing a âProgramme of Commencement
of
Ind. Univ.
â from Willie Reid.

Sunday, 9th
—
Rev.
Mr. Britton (
Epis.

A. M.
He preached a patriotic sermon
from the 12th
chap
of Kings. Attended Bible Class &
Masonâs in evening.

Monday, June 10, 1861.
Went to camp in the evening
& there learned that Mrs. Graham & Mrs.
St.
George had
been there today to see their sons; also while we were there

Cap.
Strong told his men that 50 of them could go home that
night to see their friends before starting for âthe wars.â

Pg 60

T. G., T. St G.,
[54]
and W. White were among the
no.
who
obtained permission to go.
Geo.
L. got out of the camp, &
Will & I went with [him] to Father Norrisâ to get the women
to go home with their boys, but when we arrived at the depot
we learned that an order had come from the
Adjâ
t
Gen.
forbidding
their going at this time.

Tuesday 11.
Obtained excuse from
Geom.
recitation
and went to the camp to see if the boys are going today.
They cannot go as they are being mustered in to the U. S.
service. Mrs. G. &
St
G. were there when we arrived at the
camp & went home at 1 OâClock. Staid at the camp till 5
oâclock to see the ceremony of mustering in the troops by

Capt.
M
c
Intyre of the U. S. Infantry. 7 companies took
the oath today.

Wednesday 12.
We were all excused from Latin recitation,
and visited Madison High School. The teacher, Miss
Cowes,
[55]
seemed unprepared for visitors, and the afternoon
session being a short one we heard but two recitations, (reading
& Philos[o]phy) of which the Philosophy (not being a
regular recitation at that hour) was rather poorly recited.
There were but three boys in the room, the school consisting
principally of girls.

Received a letter from Libbie

Thursday, June 13, 1861.
Visited the camp in the

P. M.
Two squads (14 & 18) have gone home from the
B. C.
Co.
but the
U. G.
boys were in neither of them. The
parade tonight was drill & uninteresting, so many of them
having gone home.

Finished review of Geometry today and take original
propositions for remainder of the recitations.

Got the key from Dr. Carr & visited the Mineralogical,
Geological & Natural History Cabinet, with Will & Holt.

Was much interested in some of the curiosities to be seen
there.

Pg 61

Friday 14.
By invitation of the boys we took supper at
the camp this evening and were well pleased with the
fare. There is some prospect of the boys going home to-morrow.
The regiment will probably start for the east Tuesday.

Finished the review of Latin today, and now the class
is going to try and get through
Liber Tertius
by Tuesday.

Attended the Societyâs meetings. The Hesperian discussed
the property qualification question, and the Athâs
âThat the legal profession presents greater inducement than
the othersâ The Aâs elected officers for the ensuing term—Griswold,

Presd.
Silverthorne,
V. P.
Fallows,
[56]

Secy.
Holt,
Censor.

Saturday 15.
On visiting the camp at 9
OâClk
found
that another squad had been made up to go home, and
Geo.

L. & T. St G. were among them. Went back to our rooms
and wrote letters to send by them.

At 4
OâClk
, Billy W. came to our rooms & said that he,
T. Graham & Alec. Adams had also got furloughs and were
going home on the 10 oâclk train, expecting to hire livery
from Milwaukee. Went with Billy down town where he got
his picture taken and the boys ate supper with us.

Sunday 16th.
—Heard Mr. Green preach & attended
Bible Class—
Prof.
C. was not there & Mr Dudley took
charge, which made it very dull.

Monday, June 17, 1861.
Went to G. B. Smithâs law
office to see if he would deliver the address at
U. G.
on the
4th. He was not in; but his student (Mr. Bird) told me
tha[t] his engagements would prevent his accepting the invitation.
Then wrote a letter to âPump Carpenterâ
[57]
for the
same purpose, as he is now living on his farm 6 miles from

Pg 62

the city. Attended the panorama of Dr. Kaneâs Arctic
Expedition & was much pleased with it.

Tuesday 18.
After school Will and I went with Frost
across Lake Monona to his home, where we were treated to a
warm supper, strawberry shortcake and strawberries & cream.

There is an encampment of Indians near by which we
visited. There were two wigwams, in which or near by were
5 men, 4 squaws, & 7 children.

We also saw a young man & 2 boys in a canoe when coming
down. There were two canoes in the river close by and
Frost & Will got into one which came very [near] upsetting
as it requires much practice to get used to them.

Picked up some clams in the lake & cooked them when
we got home. The soup was very good but the clams were
tough.

Wednesday 19.
Examination commences today. At 9
Oâclock & until 11, the Senior Class was examined by
Prof.

Read on International & Constitutional Law. This was by
means of lectures by members of the class on different subjects
connected with this study and proved very interesting
From 11 to 12
Prof.
Sterlingâs class in Analytical Geometry
was examined. This was âall Greekâ to me, but the students
seemed to understand the subject well especially as it was
one of last termâs studies. Between 3 & 4 oâclock attended

Prof.
Butlerâs class in Homerâs Iliad. M
c
Mynn
[58]
was present
at this examination. From there we went into
Prof.

Readâs room where the Seniors were examined on Political

Recâd
a letter from home.

Thursday, June 20, 1861.
Went down to camp at 8
oâclock to see the boys off. The Belle City
Co.
(
Co.
F.) was
in the âOperative Machineryâ room, having just got there
haversacks filled with provision. The regiment soon after
formed on parade & were ordered by the
Col.
to repair to
the pumps & fill their canteens; which being accomplished
they formed in front of the speakers stand and were addressed
by
Gov.
Randall. They then marched to the cars,

Pg 63

which had been run down to the camp ground and filled two
trains one of 11 & the other of 13 cars. We stood near the car
which the Racine
Co.
entered and shook hands with all the
boys as they passed.
[59]
Attended
Prof.
Carrâs examination
of the Chemistry class from 2 to 5
P. M.

Friday 21.
Went strawberrying nearly all forenoon,
and in the afternoon attended Dr. Carrâs examination. This
exercise like his recitation consists of lectures by the students
on subjects which the Dr. himself has previously discussed
before the class. This
P. M.
was devoted principally to
Geology, and, although the boys had only since last night to
prepare their subjects, they were well handled both as orations
and as recitations Visited Camp in the evening. 1

Regt.
has arrived (from Waukesha). The men
are rather small but the
Co.
is well officered and present a
pretty good appearance. In the Ath. discussed whether the
time devoted to the Classics in College could not be better
employed—Decided affirmative

Saturday 22.
Went to the depot at 1 oâclock to learn
the arrangement of trains
&c.
preparatory to going home.
From thence up town—we visited the Jail. There are only
about a dozen prisoners there now, much less, they told us,
than usual. One had his feet in irons having been attempting
to break jail lately. Three of them were crazy.

d
—Went to the Catholic Church this morning
at 9, but the first mass was nearly over when we got there &
as we did not know they would have another, we saw but little
of their proceedings. Attended the Episcopal Church &

Prof.

his teacher, as âa gentleman of excellent education, and a fluent, ready public
speaker.â Reid further states that he was descended in direct line from Governor
William Bradford of Plymouth. Before coming to Wisconsin he had been principal
of an academy at Homer, Cortland County, New York, and had also published
a paper there for several years.

On September 8, 1860, the vessel was wrecked near Waukegan, as the result of
a collision in the night-time with another vessel. The
Lady Elgin
had on board

[13]

Pliny Norcross of La Grange, George G. Green of Milford, and Augustus H.
Salisbury of Oregon. Norcross was the first University of Wisconsin student to
enlist for military service, and his example, says Professor Butler, âwas followed
by so many sons of Mars that the largest and best Greek class I ever had was
sadly thinned out.â Norcross returned to the university after his three monthsâ
enlistment had expired, but within a short time he again left school and raised
a company (Company K, Thirteenth Wisconsin Infantry), of which he was elected
captain. In after life he became a prominent lawyer and business man of
Janesville. Salisbury was graduated from the university in 1867. He became

Writing forty years later the pupil speaks of him as âone who, to a marked
degree, left the impress of his fine character and careful scholarship upon all
of the young people who were so fortunate as to come under his instruction.â

[18]

At the outbreak of the Civil War the currency of Wisconsin was secured in
very large measure by the bonds of southern states. Never considered wholly
safe in the financial world, these securities, as soon as hostilities between the
North and the South began, fell to a third of their face value. Wisconsin bankers
were unable to make good the depreciation, and the value of their currency
reflected their embarrassment. On April 4, 1861, the bankers of Chicago resolved
not to accept the notes of 40 of the 109 Wisconsin banks. On the following day
the Milwaukee bankers rejected the notes of 19 of the institutions proscribed at
Chicago. This affected the value of about $1,000,000 of the $4,500,000 of Wisconsin
currency. Brokers in the state during the succeeding weeks purchased the
discredited money at prices which rapidly sank to fifty cents on the dollar.

[19]

George B. Smith was born in New York in 1823 and came with his father
to Racine, Wisconsin, in 1843. From 1844 until his death in 1877 his residence
was at Madison. He was the youngest member of the first constitutional convention
of the state, served as mayor of Madison several terms and several as
state legislator, was attorney-general of Wisconsin for two years, and engaged
in many other activities of a public nature.

History of Wisconsin
, had been since 1838 one
of the leading public men of the territory and of the state. John Y. Smith had
settled at Green Bay in 1828, and later at Milwaukee and at Madison. He
served in the first constitutional convention and was for many years an influential
editor and publicist. Smith had made a speech denouncing secession and
upholding the Union and the administration at Washington. Strong also
denounced secession but argued that a union held together by force was worthless
and that compulsion should not be resorted to keep the South in the Union.

a leading lawyer of the Chicago bar, being granted the degree of LL.D. both by
his Alma Mater and by the University of Michigan. James Bull became lieutenant-colonel
of the Fifth Wisconsin Infantry. Of him Professor Butler has said: âWhen
this stampede [of the students to enlist] took place we were engaged in Xenophonâs

Memorab lia
. My own pocket copy, TrÃ¼bnerâs edition, I gave to James M. Bull,
one of my most zealous pupils. It was his
vade mecum
throughout the war,
and kept alive in him classical instinctsâ¦. The American soldier found
the notes of the Greek soldier a congenial manual.â Bull returned to the university
after the war and was graduated in 1869.

[25]

David Atwood, a native of New Hampshire, came to Wisconsin in 1847

[59]

Thus the first of the seventy thousand soldiers who were to pass through
Camp Randall during the next few years departed for the war. Of this farewell,
and the further record of the regiment Reid wrote in old age as follows:

âOn the twentieth day of June, the entire student force of the university
formed part of the throng which assembled at the railroad depot to witness
the departure of that gallant regiment, which was destined, before the return
of its remnant to the state, to earn the proud but sad record of losing in battle
more men in proportion to its numbers than any other regiment which fought
on either side among the great hosts engaged in the tremendous struggle. That
twenty per cent of its entire enlistment fell dead on battlefields during three
yearsâ service cannot, indeed, be said of any other regiment of any nation in modern
times.â

HISTORICAL FRAGMENTS

WISCONSINâS FIRST VERSIFIERS

The first volume of verse printed in Wisconsin and written by
a resident of that state, was long supposed to be a volume by Elizabeth
Farnsworth Mears entitled,
Voyage of Pere Marquette and the
Romance of Charles de Langlade, or the Magic Queen
. This book
was published at Fond du Lac in 1860.
[60]
Recently, however, three
different books of early Wisconsin verse have been discovered antedating
Mrs. Mearsâs work, and since they are without doubt the
earliest attempts at versification made in the Badger State, it seems
worth while to describe them.

The earliest is a hitherto unknown edition of a book which is
humorously described by âNym Krinkleâ in his
Chronicles of Milwaukee
.
Two editions of this book were published in New York in
1848 and 1849, but the edition recently discovered was issued in
Milwaukee in 1846 and, though bearing no imprint, is without doubt
the production of a western press.
[61]
Its title is as follows: âThe
History/ of/ Black Hawk,/ with which is interwoven/ a Description/
of the/ Black Hawk War/ and other/ Scenes in the
West/ by E. H. Smith/ Milwaukee/ 1848./
12mo.

pp.
6
â
120.â
This title is somewhat shorter than those of the later editions and
the text varies considerably from that of the later issues. This
edition has no illustrations, but the New York editions have several.
The only copy that can be traced of this firstling of the âWisconsin
Museâ is in the Harris Collection of American Poetry in the library
of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.

The next in point of time is a curious book, or pamphlet, with
title as follows: âThe/ Poetical/ Geography, [cut of lyre]/ with
the Rules of Arithmetic in Verse,
&c.
&C./ By George Van Waters/
Published for the Author by Sidney L. Rood,/ Bookseller,/ Milwaukee:/

Pg 65

Wilson & King,/ 1848,â/ This is a duodecimo of ninety-six
pages, with green paper covers. The cover title is somewhat longer:
âThe/ Poetical Geography,/ made to accompany any of the/ Common
School Atlases;/ to which is added/ The Rules of Arithmetic,/
and a sketch of English History,/ in Verse./ by George Van
Waters./ This work is sold by subscription and cannot be
obtained/ at any bookstore in the United States./ Milwaukee:/
Wilson & King./ 1848./ Price 25 cents.â/

The end cover contains an advertisement of a line of stage
coaches: âTo the Travelling Public/ Stage Routes from Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.â/ Signed, âJohn Frink &
Co.
, Proprietors,â The
routes are to Galena, Green Bay, Janesville, Madison, Fort Winnebago,
Dixon, Chicago, Sheboygan, and other places.

Mr. Legler informs me that he has another edition, which was
published at Cincinnati. Several of the poems contain local allusions
to Wisconsin.

The book begins with âGeographical Definitions,â and the first
lines describe geography:

The surface of the Earth, with all its tribes

Of sea and land Geography describes.

The divisions of water are next described, beginning with the
following couplet:

An ocean is a vast extent of brine,

Or salt sea water boundless and sublime.

Lakes are described as—â

Fresh water seas, by land surrounded;

As Lake Champlain, whose waves by land are bounded.

Couplets similar to these follow on straits, channels, sounds,
rivers, and other divisions of water. After explanation necessary to
the use of maps, there follows a poetical chapter on North America.
Its capes and rivers are poetically described and then, in turn, its
towns, each state being separately mentioned. The author begins
with Maine and ends with his own state, Wisconsin. A chapter on
British America is next in order and this in turn is followed by
chapters on Mexico, Guatamala, South America, Europe, Asia,
and Africa. The book ends with rhymed delineations of islands,
volcanoes, and âThe Rules of Arithmeticâ and a sketch of English

Pg 66

history. A number of notes are interspersed throughout the work,
and a prose preface follows the title. A rhymed introduction is
also introduced.

This book and also the following are in the fine collection of
Wisconsin poetry formed by Mr. Henry E. Legler, now in the possession
of Mr. Henry C. Sturges of New York.
[62]

Probably the earliest specimen of German verse written in Wisconsin,
is that from the pen of one of the German immigrants of 1848.
Its title is: âLieder/ aus/ Wisconsin/ von/ Adolf Schults./ Elberfeld
und Iserlohn./ Verlag von Julius BÃ¤deker./ 1848.â/ This is
a 16mo. pamphlet of forty-one pages followed by an unnumbered page.

The copy I have seen has blue paper covers, with the title on
the cover the same as the foregoing. On the back cover are advertisements.

The pamphlet begins with a dedication to âCarl de Haas, Ph.D.
The friend of my youth, later schoolmaster in Wupperthal [the
authorâs birthplace] and now farmer in Fond du Lac (
Wis.
).â

The first poem is entitled âEuropa, alternde KÃ¶nigin.â The
opening verse follows:

Europa, alternde KÃ¶nigin,

Dein abend ist gekommen!

Der frÃ¶hliche Morgen ist dahin,

Der Mittagstrahl verglommen.

The fifth and last stanza runs:

Europa, sterbende KÃ¶nigin,

Er wird die Herrschaft erben!

Die Krone, die dunkt ihm kein Gewinn,

Die lasst er Dir im Sterben.

Another poem is on the
âThal der Wupper, Mein Heimathland.â

The eighth poem in the book is a stirring one on the Missouri River,
âMissouri, Missouri,
der mÃ¤chtiger Strom,
â while another is
addressed to the authorâs fatherland. In this he cries to the land
of his birth, the land from which he has been exiled. The book
contains altogether thirty-six different poems.

On the back cover is an advertisement of another book of verses
by the same writer, âMÃ¤rzlieder,â which is advertised âto appear
shortly.â The publisher also advertises another book of interest

Pg 67

to the Wisconsin collector,—â
Nordamerika Wisconsin. Winke fÃ¼r
auswanderer von Dr. Carl de Haas.
Farmer in Wisconsin.â This
is described as the second edition, with three views and a map of
Wisconsin. The statement is made that the first edition of one
thousand copies was sold within four weeks. â
Gedichte von
Henriette Davidis
, second edition,â is also advertised. This book
was printed by the Groteschen Buchdruckerei in Arnsberg.

These three books are probably the earliest volumes of verse
written and published by Wisconsin poets. They are of interest
not only because of this fact but because each one relates in some
way to Wisconsin.

MEMORANDUM ON THE SPELLING OF âJOLLIETâ
[63]

Usage in spelling names was very irregular in the seventeenth
century. People spelled a name (or a word) just as it came into
their minds to do so, without fixed rules or custom. Thus the spelling
of the name of the discoverer of the Mississippi was varied—all
the following forms being used: Joliet, Jolliet, Jolyet, Jollyet.
Sometimes all forms were employed in the same document. Marquette
in writing an account of his explorations speaks of his companion
as âJolyet,â âJollyet,â and âJollietâ indifferently.
[64]

Under such circumstances it remains to be decided what the
present usage is, and on what facts it is based. Many, indeed most
English writers, follow Parkman, the greatest of our historians who
have written on this subject, and use the form with one âlâ—âJoliet.â
This has become a part of geographical usage, and we
have, for instance, Joliet, Illinois and Indiana, and Mount Joliet.
And Dr. R. G. Thwaites, in his
Jesuit Relations
,
[65]
uses the one âlâ in
his spelling of the name. Later, however, Doctor Thwaites became
convinced that the double âlâ was the better form and often so
remarked to his assistants.

Pg 68

The change from âJolietâ to âJollietâ is based first on the constant
custom of French writers, both in the Old World and the New.
Pierre Margry, the great French archivist, the most learned man of
his time concerning New France documents, always speaks of Jolliet.
FÃ©lix Martin of the Jesuit order, who wrote in 1861, uses Jolliet.
Father Tailhan, the learned editor of Perrotâs
Memoire
, uses Jolliet.
The same is true of John G. Shea, Henri Harrisse, AbbÃ© Ferland,
and Jollietâs latest biographer, Ernest Gagnon, who in 1902 published
a life of Jolliet derived from many newly discovered and
hitherto unpublished manuscripts. All these authors were familiar
with the seventeenth-century documents in the original form. They
decided that âJollietâ was used more often and more consistently
than any other form, though all of them would admit that in many
documents the spelling âJolietâ may be found. For example, the
baptismal register
[66]
spells the name by which Jolliet was christened,
âJoliet.â While still a boy in the convent at Quebec he was known
as young Joliet.
[67]

After Jolliet entered active life the name was usually spelled
with two âlâs.â His earliest voyage is reported by the Sulpician,
GalinÃ©e, who met him in 1669 at the head of Lake Erie and calls
him âle sieur Jolliet.â
[68]
In 1671 he took part in the pageant of
Sault Ste. Marie, when he was again spoken of as âle sieur Jolliet.â
[69]

Father Claude Dablon, who first reported the voyage of 1673, says,
August 1, 1674, âle sieur Jollietâ has come back from the West.
[70]

Count de Frontenac, the governor-general of New France, in his
first mention of the voyager, speaks of him as âJolietâ;
[71]
but thereafter
in reporting his voyage and mentioning his maps he always
writes the name âJolliet.â
[72]
Several unsigned documents of the same
period refer to him as âJolliet.â
[73]
In 1677 a concession in Illinois

Pg 69

was refused to âle sieur Jolliet.â
[74]
In 1680 a concession of the
island of Anticosti was made to âJolliet.â
[75]
Many more similar
documents could be cited showing that the prevalent use in the
seventeenth century was the form âJolliet.â

Lastly, how did the man himself write his name? A map published
in Dr. R. G. Thwaitesâs
Jesuit Relations
,
[76]
gives in the cartouche
a letter signed âJoliet.â This has usually been supposed to
be the explorerâs writing. A glance, however, at two authentic
signatures will convince that he never wrote the name on the map.
The first signature is from a tracing secured by Henry Legler for
an article in the Wisconsin Historical Society
Proceedings
, 1905,
page 169. The second is the signature to the marriage contract of
which a facsimile is given in Gagnon, page 122. A glance will
show that these two names were written by the same hand, and both
are spelled âJolliet.â

In view, therefore, of first, the usage of the best French authors;
second, the usage of the latter part of the seventeenth century, or
contemporary usage; and third, the signature of the explorer himself,
the spelling âJollietâ is believed to be the proper one.

THE FIRST EDITION OF THE ZENGER
TRIAL
, 1736
[77]

The Wisconsin Historical Society recently purchased an important
file of the
New York Weekly Journal
, consisting of 136 numbers,
ranging from December 17, 1733 to July 11, 1737. Bound in
the same volume with these issues of the second newspaper printed
in New York is an imprint of excessive rarity—namely, the first
edition of
A Brief Narrative of the Case and Tryal of John Peter
Zenger
, 1736. Probably only one other copy—that in the New
York Public Library—is extant. It is a folio of forty pages, printed
by Zenger himself, without a separate title-page. At the head of
the first page is this title: âA Brief Narrative of the Case and
Try/al of
John Peter Zenger
, Printer of the/
New York weekly
Journal
.â/ The caption set between rows of printerâs ornaments,

Pg 70

and the colophon reads: â
New York
, Printed and sold by
John Peter
Zenger
.
MDCCXXXVI.
â There are two lines of errata above
the colophon. The most striking peculiarity of the edition is to be
found in the pagination, pages 15 to 40 being numbered 17 to 42.
James Alexander prepared the narrative for publication.

There are numerous editions of the
Trial
, including four published
in London in 1738. The present copy is in unusually fine
condition and the Wisconsin Historical Society is to be congratulated
upon the possession (acquired with little effort, it is whispered)
of this superlatively rare colonial imprint. It was picked
up, so to speak, in the East, almost at the threshold of several
institutions that would give much to place it upon their shelves. If
put upon the market, it is not unlikely that the pamphlet would
realize several thousand dollars. But, of course, no library ever
parts with such a treasure.

Of the life of John Peter Zenger little is known. He was born
in Germany in 1697, but the name of his native place is not recorded.
He is said to have been one of a large company of Palatines who
were sent to America by Queen Anne in 1710. After serving an
apprenticeship of eight years to William Bradford, the printer,
dating from October 26, 1711, Zenger went to Maryland. Returning
to New York, he there married Anna Catharina Maulin on
September 11, 1722. This was his second marriage, the date of the
first being unknown. For a short time he was Bradfordâs partner.
One book only is known to bear their joint imprint. In 1726 he
started business on his own account, and it is interesting to note
that he printed the first arithmetic issued in the colony—
Vanemaâs
Arithmetica
, 1730.

The administration of William Cosby as governor of New York,
1732-1736, was marked by many arbitrary acts, which aroused deep
public indignation. âThe oppressions,â writes Mr. Livingston
Rutherfurd in his useful book,
[78]
âculminated in the trial of John Peter
Zenger which was one of the most stirring incidents of colonial days.
Its results were of greater magnitude than any of the participants
could have imagined. It established the freedom of the press in

Pg 71

North America, it wrought an important change in the law of libel,
and marked the beginning of a new era in popular government.â
Nor is this an overstatement of the case; for the trial of this humble
printer constitutes an important episode in our colonial history.

The establishment of the
New York Weekly Journal
came as the
result of a determination on the part of the popular leaders to show
Governor Cosby to the people of the colony in his true colors.
Zenger, its printer, was probably aided financially in the venture.
The first number was issued November 5, 1733—a folio of four
pages. The chief contributors were Lewis Morris, James Alexander,
William Smith, Cadwallader Colden, and Lewis Morris Jr.
Apparently, Alexander was the editor, for among his papers are
many articles intended for publication in the
Journal
. Zenger had
been indifferently educated, and his skill as a printer was not great.
Moreover, he was very poor. He appears to have entered upon the
project for commercial considerations only, and without any clear
understanding of its political significance or of where it might lead
him.

The
Journal
was the sensation of the hour; in fact, it was so
popular that of some numbers three editions were required to satisfy
the demand. Although it abounds in errors due to Zengerâs imperfect
knowledge of English, it is in every way superior to its competitor,
Bradfordâs
Gazette
, the organ of the Governor. âThe paper
was sold for three shillings per quarter, and advertisements cost
three shillings for the first insertion and one shilling for each insertion
thereafter.â It contained many articles of merit—and was
extremely outspoken!

With such an administration in power it is not surprising that
all this resulted in the arrest of Zenger on November 17, 1734, âfor
printing and publishing several Seditious Libels dispersed throughout
his Journals or News Papers, entitled,
The New York Weekly
Journal, containing the freshest Advices, foreign and domestick
.â
After many vicissitudes, including nine months of imprisonment,
Zenger was defended by Andrew Hamilton, of Philadelphia, an
eminent advocate nearly eighty years old, and acquitted. There
was much rejoicing among the people, for the victory was indeed a
notable one, full of meaning for future generations. Gouverneur

Pg 72

Morris declared that âthe trial of Zenger in 1735 was the germ of
American freedom, the morning star of that liberty which subsequently
revolutionized America.â

A NOVEL TRANSPORTATION DEVICE

A recent request for information on the subject first brought to
our attention the novel project of Norman Wiard for establishing
a rapid-transit route between Prairie du Chien and
St.
Paul in 1859.
A somewhat cursory examination of contemporary newspaper files
revealed the notices of the project which follow. It seems probable
that a more thorough search would disclose additional information
concerning Wiardâs ingenious project.

The Ice Boat
[79]

Prairie du Chien, Dec. 1, 1859.

Editor Courier.
Dear Sir: As there have been many conjectures
in regard to the Ice Boat published in the various newspapers
of the Northwest, I thought that some definite and reliable
information in regard to the invention would be of interest to the
public.

Norman Wiard Esq., the inventor of the Ice Boat, is now constructing
in New York City, an ice boat with a capacity for carrying
twenty passengers, and will be here with it about the twentieth
of December. He has proved to the satisfaction of some of the
most scientific men of New York that his invention is a success.

It is intended by the parties having the route from here to Saint
Paul to stock the line this winter, and to be prepared to do all
business that may present itself.

The immense advantages arising to the Northwest from this
invention must be apparent to all.

Yours truly,
John Jay Chase

Ice Boats, Chariots, Cutter—Letter from Mr. Wiard
[80]

New York, Nov. 22, 1859.

169 Broadway, Room 35.

J. H. Green
,
Editor of Leader
:

Please say to all, or as much of what I have written as you please,
in your own words, for I assure you I believe it all myself, and I
believe that many of your readers will be glad to have the information.

Yours truly,
Norman Wiard
.

Accordingly, we say as requested, that Norman Wiard, inventor
of the Ice Boat, will be in Prairie du Chien before long with a twenty-passenger
steam ice boat, which he has now in process of construction
at New York, and hopes by such means to keep open communication
with
St.
Paul and Prairie du Chien, connecting, always up to time,
with the Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad.

He will also be prepared with a pioneer machine to level a track,
when it is necessary, where the ice is rough. His twenty-passenger
boat can be raised or lowered, while in motion or at rest, to enable
it to pass through a uniform depth of snow of three feet. It has
devices that are ample and practical, by which it can pass over or
through snow banks and drifts; even if it should be run into a bank
of snow twenty feet in depth and there stopped, it can immediately
be passed through it or over it, or be backed out with the greatest
facility. It is an amphibious machine, is this Ice Boat, as it can
be run off the ice at a speed of twenty miles an hour into the water
with safety; and it can propel itself across the water to contact with
the ice on the other side, and get out upon the ice and be put again
in operation without any material delay. It is, also, almost dangerproof;
for, if it should be thrown into the water by accident, on its
side, or even bottom up, it would right itself instantly; and about
thirty holes would have to be broken in the hull before it could be
sunk, even if it were full of water.

Mr. Wiard exhibited a model of his Ice Boat at the fair of the
American Institute,
N. Y.
, and received therefor the highest award;
the operations of his model corroborate the statements made above;

Pg 74

and the minutes of the Polytechnic Club, before whom he exhibited
his plans at their request, says [
sic
] that the working of the model
âproved his statements.â The practicability of the boat itself will
soon be tested on the ice of the Mississippi, and the judgment which
will then be pronounced [will be] a final one.

[Corner torn off] driver only, and can go up and down hill and
into the water, safely! âPlease to say all this,â says Mr. Wiard,
âfor I assure you, I believe it all!â So will we all, when we see it,
and the sight is promised us.

Mr. John Cleveland, 35 Wall Street,
N. Y.
, is now the trustee
of the patent, and by the liberal subscription of a few intelligent and
responsible gentlemen of that city Mr. Wiard is enabled to fully
develop and test his plans. The machine he is now building is said
to be beautiful as well as useful; and it seems likely to attract a
number of New Yorkers to visit Prairie du Chien when Mr. Wiard
brings it here.

Should this invention prove to be a practical one, Norman
Wiardâs name will be ranked along with that of Fulton, Stephenson,
and Morse. If his machine should prove valueless, the worst that
can or will be said, will be that he
deserved
success.

The Ice Boat
[81]

The Prairie du Chien
Leader
says it is not, and never has been,
the intention of Mr. Wiard to test the practicability of his invention
with the boat half built last winter, and which remains in

statue
[sic]
quo
yet, being too large, heavy, and unwieldy for the
experiment.

This memorandum was prepared for submission to the Committee on State
Affairs of the Wisconsin Assembly in April, 1917. A bill had been introduced in
the assembly by the committee which provided that the name âJolietâ should
be given to the state park at the mouth of the Wisconsin River. As a result of
the memorandum, the bill was amended by substituting the spelling âJollietâ
in the name of the park.

INTRODUCING OURSELVES

The State Historical Society of Wisconsin is now in the
sixty-eighth year of its existence. Quiescent during its first
few years, with the coming of Lyman C. Draper to the secretaryship
of the Society in 1854 it immediately entered upon
a period of aggressive activity which has continued without
interruption to the present moment. During the sixty years
of the remarkable leadership of Dr. Draper and Dr. Thwaites
the Society deservedly acquired the reputation of being one
of the leading historical organizations of the country. Our
library, if not the largest, is one of the best of its kind and
in many respects its collections are unique. In other fields
of activity, too, the Societyâs achievements have been no less
creditable to it and to the state it represents.

No sadder disaster could befall the Society, however, than
the development on the part of its members of a feeling of
serene satisfaction with the record of its achievements. As
with all living organisms, we must go forward or retrograde.
Only dead ones are static. The manifold life of our state
and country is constantly changing. If our Society is to
fulfil its proper function, it must constantly strive to adjust
itself to the current developments of the world to which it
belongs. With the passage of time the ancient good becomes
uncouth and it behooves us to assume the new duties which
new occasions teach.

In this spirit, after much thought and planning, we
launch the
Wisconsin Magazine of History
. The problem
of our historical society differs materially from that of
many others, particularly those in the older-settled sections

Pg 76

of the country. It must justify the support which the taxpayers
so liberally accord by rendering to the public the fullest
possible measure of service, and to this ideal it has long
subscribed. Equally important is it, however, that the public
should be aware of the facilities for service which the Society
possesses in order that these may be utilized. It is believed
that the publication of a quarterly magazine, devoted to the
historical interests of the state will afford a better avenue
of communication with the Societyâs members and the general
public than has been possessed heretofore. Without sacrificing
in any way the scholarly ideals of the Society, it is
hoped to make the magazine as interesting as may be to the
ordinary reader. As our immediate constituency we have in
mind the seven hundred members of the Society, whose tastes
and interests, we have faith to believe, are shared by thousands
of other citizens of Wisconsin. The historical interests of the
professional scholars among our membership are catered to
by numerous historical reviews, but no publication meets the
needs of the far greater proportion of our members who are
not included in this group. To this constituency, primarily,
it is hoped the magazine will appeal. If this hope shall be
realized we will account the magazine a success. If it shall
be disappointed, on the contrary, the energies of the Societyâs
working force will be directed to more fruitful ends as soon
as this fact shall have been established.

OUR STATE FLAG

How many, we wonder, of those into whose hands this
magazine may come are aware that the beautiful banner represented
on its cover is the official state flag of Wisconsin?
That the number is much smaller than it should be is certain.
When we set out in quest of an example of our state flag, our
first application was at the nearby armory, but the officer in
charge confidently assured us that Wisconsin has no state
flag, and appealed to Websterâs
New International
to support

Pg 77

his assertion. Notwithstanding the evidence of both
soldier and dictionary, for over fifty years Wisconsin regiments
have carried the state flag, although its legal definition
and precise present design date back only to 1913. That our
beautiful banner, hallowed on many a bloody battlefield, is so
little known to our citizens is not at all to our credit. Nor is it
creditable that the service flags in the hands of the custodian
of public property at the capitol fail in almost every respect
to conform to the official specifications for the state flag as
set forth in the statutes.

THE SOCIETY AND THE LEGISLATURE

Members and friends of the Society may congratulate
themselves, on the whole, on the treatment accorded it by the
state legislature of 1917. In view of economic and political
conditions generally, and of the local political situation in
particular, it was to have been expected that the legislators
would scrutinize our budget estimates with care, and that
enthusiasm for new advances, whether in work or in appropriations,
would be conspicuous by its absence. It is gratifying
to record that the members of the joint finance committee
of the two houses accorded the representatives of the Society
an appreciative hearing and manifested a desire to provide
for its activities during the coming biennium with enlightened,
albeit prudent, liberality. Since the task of presenting
the Societyâs needs to the legislature devolves chiefly upon
the writer of these lines, the occasion is gladly improved to
acknowledge in particular the broad-minded attitude of
Senator Platt Whitman of Highland, and Assemblyman
E. A. Everett of Eagle River, chairmen of the joint finance
committee.

From one point of view, however, the present financial
situation of the Society is far from gratifying. It is running
on substantially the same budget as was first laid down in
1912, and this will, of course, continue to be the case at least

Pg 78

until July 1, 1919. No one who is mature enough to be reading
these lines, need be told that the purchasing power of a given
sum of money has shrunk alarmingly since 1912. In effect,
therefore, the Societyâs income has decreased in recent years
in proportion as the cost of living generally has steadily
increased. To take a single illustration, the cost of heating
the library building in the year ending June 30, 1916, was
(in round numbers) $5,500; for the succeeding fiscal year
it was $7,400; while the estimates for the year just entered
upon call for an expenditure of $11,000 for this purpose.
Obviously the library building must continue to be heated.
It follows, therefore, with the total income of the Society
stationary from year to year, that the additional sum required
for coal must be gained by curtailing other activities of the
Society, which constitute its real excuse for existence. The
importance of this subject is such that a suitable occasion
will be sought later to lay it before our readers in fuller detail.

THE FIRST WISCONSIN CAPITOL AT BELMONT

NELSON DEWEY PARK AND THE FIRST
WISCONSIN CAPITOL

Several other matters of peculiar interest to the historically-minded
citizens of Wisconsin were acted upon by the
recent legislature. We record with chief pleasure in this connection
the provision made for the preservation of our first
territorial capitol at Belmont (now Leslie). Eleven years
ago the superintendent of the Society, Dr. Thwaites, made
an effort to secure the restoration of this quondam statehouse
for a region imperial in extent, and the story of his effort
is told in the
Proceedings
of the Society for 1906. At that
time the legislature failed to act upon his sensible advice,
however, and the matter was allowed to drop. At the recent
legislative session, Mr. M. P. Rindlaub of Platteville, veteran
editor of southern Wisconsin, took up anew the agitation
for the preservation of the capitol building. This time the
advice was heeded and the sum of $3,000 was appropriated

Pg 79

for the purpose in view. Mr. Rindlaubâs plan contemplated
the removal and renovation of the capitol and the making
of provision for a permanent caretaker who, under the control
of the state conservation commission, should look after it.
For these objects the sum of $10,000 was asked. The amount
granted will suffice but partially to execute the entire project,
but it will at least insure the permanent preservation of the
building.

The action of the legislature in naming the state park
at the mouth of the Wisconsin was, in our opinion, distinctly
unwise. Citizens of Wisconsin do not need to be reminded
that the historical association which provided the driving
motive for securing this splendid tract for a state park
preserve several years ago was the discovery of the Mississippi
River at this point by the famous expedition of Jolliet
and Marquette in 1673. Because of this fact, and of the
additional one that the park was bought by and belongs to
the entire state, the name either of Jolliet or Marquette should
unquestionably have been given to the park. As between
these two there would perhaps be little reason for preference
were it not for the fact that Marquette has twice been signally
honored by the state (by naming a county for him and by
choosing him as one of the two Wisconsin characters whose
statue is placed in the national capitol) while to Jolliet no
recognition, official or otherwise, has ever been accorded in
Wisconsin.

Curiously enough, the park has been allowed to exist for
several years without a legal name. During this time residents
of the vicinity developed the habit of calling it Glenn
Park, after former Senator Glenn who sold the land to the
state, while the conservation commission, as a matter of convenience,
referred to it as Marquette Park. When a bill
was introduced at the recent legislative session providing
that the park be officially named after Senator Glenn, a number
of officers and members of the Society bestirred themselves

Pg 80

to defeat the measure through the process of enlightening
the legislature with respect to the historical and other
considerations involved. It is proper to record in this connection
that Assembly Kurtenacker of La Crosse, on being
apprised of the situation, cheerfully joined with the representatives
of the Society in the effort to have the bill which
he had himself introduced by request, killed in committee.
This effort met with success, and the assembly committee on
state affairs reported a bill to the lower chamber providing
that the park be named in honor of Jolliet. The assembly
passed the bill, but in the senate it was amended by substituting
for Jolliet the name of Nelson Dewey, first governor of
the state, and in this form it became a law.

We believe that the motive which prompted the senate
amendment was laudable, but that the judgment displayed
was weak. Apparently the impression that the park should
be considered in some peculiar sense as a perquisite of the
people of southwestern Wisconsin, as opposed to the state as
a whole, could not be surmounted. With no remote desire to
detract from the fame or merit of Governor Dewey, we do
not think the mere circumstance of his residence having been
at Cassville constitutes a pertinent reason for giving his name
to this park, the very existence of which is due to the famous
discovery of June 17, 1673. Incidentally, however, the entire
discussion was productive of good, since it called the attention
of the public anew to the value and significance of the
factor of historical associations in the selection of place names.

PERROT STATE PARK AND JOHN A. LATSCH

Another park development of the past year which is
peculiarly gratifying to the State Historical Society pertains
to the new state park at Trempealeau. For many years the
Society has been actively interested in this locality because
of the richness of its historical associations. In particular,
in recent years a series of historical articles pertaining to the

Pg 81

locality written by Dr. Eben D. Pierce, member and curator
of the Society, has been published in the volumes of
Proceedings
.
Largely through these activities the interest of
Mr. Latsch, a leading business man of Winona, was
awakened to the desirability of securing historic Trempealeau
Mountain and the adjoining river frontage as a permanent
park preserve. To this end he purchased some 800 acres of
land including the mountain and the adjoining river bluffs,
and offered the whole as a gift to the State Historical Society.
Because the Society lacks the facilities for administering such
a trust, on the Superintendentâs recommendation the gift
was diverted to the conservation commission, which is admirably
qualified to administer it. At the time of writing
these lines (July, 1917) it only remains to complete certain
legal details when the formal transfer of the property to the
state will be made. Thus the famous peak, noted by Pike
and Schoolcraft and many another early explorer, together
with the site of ancient Fort Perrot, one of the earliest establishments
of civilized man in the upper Mississippi Valley,
is added to our already splendid system of state parks. Aside
from the historical associations of the place, the river scenery
at this point is rarely impressive and beautiful; while
Trempealeau Mountain itself is said to be peculiarly rich in
botanical specimens.

But by what authority, it may be asked, have we headed
this editorial âPerrot State Park.â Pressed for an answer,
we must admit that the title expresses a hope merely, rather
than a consummation already realized. One of the motives,
we understand, responsible for the interest Mr. Latsch has
shown in the matter was a feeling of veneration for his boyhood
home and for his Swiss father who settled in Latsch
Valley some two generations ago. Under the circumstances
it would not be strange if the donor, following the example
long since set by a notable giver of libraries to the American
public, should impose as a condition of his gift to the state

Pg 82

the requirement that the park be named in honor of his father.
We understand, instead, that Mr. Latsch himself desires the
park to be named in honor of Nicolas Perrot, the famous
French explorer, who passed the winter of 1685-86 a short
distance down the river from Trempealeau Mountain and
within the confines of the new state park. The fine modesty
and sense of historical appreciation displayed by Mr. Latsch
in thus desiring to honor the intrepid explorer require no
words of commendation at our hands. We may express the
hope, however, that when a future state legislature shall come
to the task of bestowing a legal name on the park, it will
possess a like degree of judgment concerning the historical
fitness of things. Perhaps Mr. Latsch might insure this in
advance by making the gift of the land to the state dependent
upon its acceptance of the name of Perrot for the park.

FOREST FIRES, GENERALLY AND IN PARTICULAR

From the beginning of Wisconsinâs development until
the close of the nineteenth century, lumbering constituted one
of the chief sources of the stateâs wealth and business activity.
In 1860 the lumber industry, still in its infancy in Wisconsin,
ranked second only to agriculture in importance. The
story of its rise and decline constitutes one of the most important
and thrilling chapters in our history as a state. In
this respect our history conforms to the general rule that in
every new country the natural resources closest at hand are
the first to be exploited. Well had it been for state and
nation had our lumbermen, in their mad rush to transmute
our magnificent forests into gold, paid more regard to the
welfare of future generations and squandered less recklessly
this splendid âgift of the ages.â

This statement of these reflections brings us to the point
of suggesting the broader historical significance of Mr.
Bracklinâs article in the present number of the
Wisconsin
Magazine of History
. One of the prolific factors making

Pg 83

for the waste of our lumbering resources was fire. In the
words of a recent writer this was âthe dread scourge of the
lumber industry.â The sawmills and sawmill towns, flimsily
constructed of inflammable pine, were periodically swept by
the flames. Although the mills and mill towns were commonly
rebuilt with characteristic American vigor, the forest
fires were the source of appalling loss to the state. Yet the
public mind was for many years indifferent to these losses,
and the fires were commonly left to burn themselves out,
with no human effort to impede or check the course of the
flames. In 1864 one of the greatest conflagrations which had
ever visited the state swept for weeks through the northern
pinery regions, yet so indifferent were the people of southern
Wisconsin to the matter that it received scarcely any notice
in the newspapers of this section.

Our numerous forest fires, then, have possessed not only
thrilling human interest but vast economic significance. Mr.
Bracklinâs narrative describes a single personal experience
with one small forest fire. What he experienced and here
describes, however, applies with suitable variation of details
to hundreds of similar events in Wisconsin. In this fact
consists its broader significance.

CONSOLATION FOR THE PRESENT CRISIS

It seems evident, from the sources of information at our
command, that the Imperial German Government counted
largely on its ability to neutralize the national will of America
by fostering among Americans of German descent a spirit
of disloyalty to their country. That the citizens of the Badger
State in particular could thus be cajoled into playing a
traitorâs rÃ´le was not only believed in Germany, but widely
feared in our own country as well. That our citizens of
German descent should be enthusiastic about going into the
war was not reasonably to have been expected; that, faced
with a hard duty, they should prefer to play the rÃ´le of

Pg 84

traitor is quite another matter. We do not believe, and from
the beginning have not feared, that any considerable number
will make such a choice.

In such a time of trial and stress as the present we are
fairly entitled to gain what comfort we may from an examination
of our past. The simple truth is that, with the possible
exception of the Spanish War, we enter upon the present
struggle with more of unanimity and resolution than has been
the case with any other great war in our history. Of our
unfortunate divisions and discords during the Revolution
and the War of 1812 every schoolboy is informed. The
North had little enthusiasm for the Mexican War and largely
abstained from participation in it. The Civil War was a
fratricidal contest, but the South eliminated from consideration,
the people of the North were sadly divided in counsels
and desires. That this was true of Wisconsin has been largely
forgotten by our citizens. The present generation has forgotten,
if indeed it was ever aware of, the fact that Wisconsin
was the seat of a formidable copperhead sentiment during the
war; that there was widespread opposition to the enforcement
of the draft by the federal government; and that a
largely attended mass meeting at the state capital in April,
1861, after the firing on Fort Sumter, laid on the table a
resolution pledging support to President Lincoln. It is true
the local paper declared, in the latter instance, that a majority
of those present favored the resolution but were circumvented
in their desire by the chairman of the meeting; but even so it
is evident that there must have been a large element of opposition
to have enabled him to carry through the maneuver. Notwithstanding
the deliberation with which the recent legislature
went about expressing its support of the national government,
it requires no hardihood to affirm that no chairman of a
public gathering, however traitorous his desire, could have
prevented a Madison audience of 1917 from expressing its
intention of standing behind the national government.

Pg 85

To touch for a moment upon another matter, the political
ideals of the period preceding the Civil War were shockingly
low in comparison with those of the present time. If there
has been any graft in connection with the construction of our
new $7,000,000 capitol, the public is as yet totally unconscious
of the fact. Three-quarters of a century ago, on the
contrary, we could not build even a forty-thousand-dollar
capitol without a riot of mismanagement and dishonesty.
The period of âBarstow and the balance,â and of the âforty
thievesâ signifies more than the addition of a picturesque
phrase to our political annals. Instead of constituting a rare
exception, the political morality which these phrases suggest
was painfully commonplace in Wisconsin prior to the Civil
War. It was only a few years before we entered upon that
great struggle that a powerful corporation brazenly established
a pay-counter at the capital and bought with paltry
silver the entire state legislature, and even the governor himself.
Idealists are by no means satisfied with the political
standards and practices of our public men of the present day,
but they are lily-white in comparison with the similar
standards of the fifties in Wisconsin.

Or again, let us glance by way of comparison at the
financial situation. The diary of Harvey Reid, published
elsewhere in this magazine, affords an inkling, at least, of
our deplorable financial condition in 1861. The national
banking-system still lay in the womb of the future, while the
treacherous âwild catsâ flourished at the expense alike of
private fortunes and public credit. With the first breath of
war these institutions toppled in headlong ruin, notwithstanding
that the state legislature, heedless of constitutional prohibitions,
essayed vainly to prevent the crash. Within four
days after the news of the firing on Fort Sumter, specie payments
were suspended in Wisconsin; and the efforts of the
government to float a war loan of $1,200,000 on the credit

Pg 86

of the state of Wisconsin in the summer of 1861 met with
dismal and inglorious failure.

We do not remind the present generation of these things
in any pharisaical attitude, but for the encouragement they
afford to us at this time. The outstanding fact is that in the
very face of such conditions as we have adverted to, Wisconsin
girded herself for the task and played a noble part in the
Civil War. We enter the present struggle immeasurably
better prepared from almost every viewpoint than we did
the one of old. If, as we believe, our people still retain a
fair measure of pluck and ability, the record we are about to
make should be correspondingly better than that of fifty
years ago.

THE QUESTION BOX

The Wisconsin Historical Library has long maintained a
bureau of historical information for the benefit of those who
care to avail themselves of the service it offers. In âThe
Question Boxâ will be printed from time to time such queries,
with the answers made to them, as possess sufficient general
interest to render their publication worth while.

THE OLDEST CHURCH IN WISCONSIN

You will recall the little church in Ephraim where you gave us
your historical address a few years ago. This church was built in
1857, dedicated in 1859, and has been in continuous use ever since.

I have wondered if there is any older church still in use in
Wisconsin. I have gone through the records of two-thirds of the
counties of the state and, while I have found that many churches
were erected prior to this, these have all been superseded by later
structures. I wonder if your staff can give me any assistance in
ascertaining the existence of any older house of worship?

H. R. Holand,

Ephraim, Wisconsin
.

One of the oldest church buildings in Wisconsin is undoubtedly
that known as The Old Mission on Madelaine Island. This was built
in 1839 and dedicated in 1840 for the American Board of Home
Missions, now part of the Presbyterian denomination. This building
is now used for worship at least during the summer season, but has
not been so employed consecutively, as it was closed in the fifties and
not reopened until 1892. In 1901 is was removed to its present location,
and restored and redecorated in 1915.

The oldest frame church in Wisconsin was built in 1839 at
Kelloggâs Corners, now Sylvania, in Racine County, for the use of
the Methodist denomination. So far as we can ascertain, the old
church is still standing, but whether or not it is now used for service
we are not informed.

Pg 88

There is a country church near Waterford in Racine County
which was built in 1846 and is still in excellent condition and in
active use. Only last year it was thoroughly renovated at a cost of
some $3,500—several times as much as the original cost of the building.
This church stands in what is known as the English Settlement
by reason of the fact that the community was largely settled by immigrants
from England in the early forties. The church is unique both
in its organization and in its history.

It is evident, therefore, that while your church at Ephraim may be
among the older structures of the state still used for religious services,
it cannot claim the honor of priority in this respect.

THE FIRST MILLS IN THE FOX RIVER VALLEY

I am preparing recollections of early days in the Fox River
Valley and will be pleased to supply you with results of my efforts in
this direction. I am somewhat confused on some of the items, especially
the establishment of the first saw and grist mill on the south or
east side (my old home), of the river and across from Kaukauna.
My friend, Mr. John D. Lawe, son of the late George W. Lawe,
writes me that James M. Boyd and Paul Hudon
dit
Beaulieu, my
grandfather, âbuilt a saw mill along the rapid,â etc. The date given
by Mr. Lawe for the building of the saw mill is 1832. A few years
later my father, Bazil H. Beaulieu, came in possession of both mills.
I was told when I was a boy that the mills were originally built by the
federal government for the use and purposes of the Menominee, as
also of the Brothertown Indians, the latter being now scattered on
farms on the east shore of Lake Winnebago, across from Oshkosh.
Furthermore, I was told that the said mills were the second of the
kind built in Wisconsin, then the territory of Michigan. Have you
any facts or data at hand which might serve to verify or throw more
light on the subject?

T. H. Beaulieu,

White Earth, Minnesota
.

With regard to the Fox River Valley mills, the earliest, both
saw and grist, were built by Jacob Franks on Devilâs River some time
shortly after 1800. They afterwards came into the possession of
John Lawe, and were operated by him for many years. Pierre A.
Grignon built a grist mill on Reaume or Glaize Creek in 1810. This
was used to provide food for the war parties of Robert Dickson in

Pg 89

the War of 1812. The miller was Grignonâs brother-in-law,
Dominique Brunette usually called Masca.

Augustin Grignon built a grist mill at Kaukauna on the north
side of the stream, about 1818. Two years later the United States
government had a sawmill erected at Little Rapids to prepare
material for Fort Howard and its outlying buildings.

In 1821-22 the Menominee, who had a village at South Kaukauna,
sold a large tract to the New York Indians. In the latter year the
Stockbridge began to move to their tract, which began just above the
Menominee village. The government had built for the Stockbridge
Indians a sawmill, which was finished some time before 1830. At
that date a grist mill was proposed by the Stockbridge. Probably
that was when your father took over the mills and repaired them,
and perhaps enlarged them. The Brothertown Indians were settled
with the Stockbridge, and removed with them to the east side of
Lake Winnebago. The Menominee Indians had mills built for them
by the government, but that was after the Treaty of 1846, and they
were built much higher up the river, at or near Menasha.

COLONEL ELLSWORTHâS MADISON CAREER

I am collecting materials for a life of
Col.
E. E. Ellsworth and
would ask if you have in your library anything concerning his drilling
of the Governorâs Guard in your city in the space between 1858 and
1860. I understand that his stay was not very long, a few weeks
probably, but I cannot state definitely the year. It would be a great
help to me if you would look up this matter, and if you could send
me full information and copies of important phases relating in any
manner to his sojourn in your town, I would be greatly obliged. I
am in this work simply to resurrect and save from oblivion the history
of a great and martyred name of our country, one which has been
strangely neglected. The more I study into his life and collect the
materials from scattered and almost forgotten sources, the more I
am convinced that he was a young man of remarkable genius, worthy
of perpetuation in the annals of the nation.

From the success that has so far rewarded my search, I am encouraged
to believe that ere long I will be in possession of everything
of real importance that belonged to his career. I was well acquainted
with his father and my home is within easy reach of his birthplace.

Pg 90

and of Mechanicsville, New York, where he was buried and where a
fine monument stands to his memory.

C. A. Ingraham,

Cambridge, New York
.

We find in our collections a few memorials of E. E. Ellsworth
that we think would interest you. In an old book of autographs there
is a tiny photograph that has been identified as that of Ellsworth.
It is only about an inch long and yet it is perfectly clear and well-defined;
the uniform shows to great advantage, and there are three
medals on the breast of the coat. Among the other relics is a drawing
about sixteen inches by twelve, the head of a fine-looking man
with lifted eyes. This is signed âEllsworthâ and âEEE.â It was
presented to the Society by N. B. Van Slyke, who gave the information
that it was a âSketch drawn by
Col.
E. E. Ellsworth in 1858
at Madison, Wisconsin, and presented to N. B. Van Slyke while the
young man was at Madison.â Pasted upon this drawing are several
newspaper slips giving Ellsworthâs biography, the last letter which
he wrote to his parents from Washington, May 23, 1861, accounts
of his death and funeral, and a poem in his honor.

Upon consulting the Madison newspapers for 1858 we secured the
following items: The Governorâs Guard was organized February 18,
1858, with Julius P. Atwood as captain. April 20, the Guard appeared
upon the street for the first time trained by Lieutenant C. W.
Harris. The Guard was very prominent socially, and gave many
balls and soirÃ©es. It took part in public celebrations on the Fourth
of July, at the university commencement, and at the state fair. June
25, the Guard first appeared in uniform. No mention appears of
Ellsworth until Oct. 15, 1858, when a Cadet Corps formed.
Twenty-five Madison boys met at the Governorâs Guard Armory, and
Maj. E. E. Ellsworth, who was unanimously elected commandant,
immediately put the cadets to drill. October 18, the Governorâs
Guard was summoned to drill three evenings in the week, no spectators
allowed. October 20 the papers contain notices of the drilling of
the cadets by their commandant, Maj. E. E. Ellsworth, who âIs an
accomplished and thorough drill master.â Another paper says the
cadets âare ambitious to become the best drilled company in the
State and their aptness has called forth a high compliment from
Major Ellsworth.â

Pg 91

An exhaustive search does not reveal his name again. On December
26, 1858, the Governorâs Guard âwere out in full uniform for the
first time since the State Fair and to us appear much improved in a
military point.â

We have not been able to determine what brought Ellsworth to
Madison. W. J. Ellsworth lived in the city at the time. Possibly
they were kinsmen.

One other relic of Ellsworthâs activities among us is in the Keyes
Papers. In 1910,
Col.
Elisha W. Keyes wrote an article for the
Madison
Democrat
on the organization of the Governorâs Guard.
In it he says âSoon after the organization of the guard he [Ellsworth]
appeared in Madison and spent much time, without Compensation,
in drilling the men. He was then a young man, not much over
30 years of age. He had been an apt student of military science and
discipline. His heart and soul were in the work. His enthusiasm
was boundless, although at the time of his work here no one hardly
dreamed that the rebellion was possible. Before he left he contemplated
the full organization of the eighteenth regiment State
militia [of which Keyes was then Colonel]. I have in my possession
now a roll of maps and instructions for regimental drill, which
involved much labor, that he prepared for me, as colonel, without
reward.â These drafts came to the Society with Judge Keyesâs other
papers. They are large map-like drafts, colored, of the positions
of the regiment, and fully written out directions in Ellsworthâs own
hand for the various orders for military positions and movements.

Probably you know that Ellsworthâs diary was given to Frank
Brownell, his avenger. We have two pamphlets giving liberal excerpts
from the diary, but we find therein no mention of Madison.
Probably the full text of this diary would show when and why he came
to Madison.

Your letter of the nineteenth instant concerning Ellsworth is
before me and I wish to thank you earnestly for the time and care
which you have devoted to this subject; it illuminates a portion of his
career with which I was entirely unacquainted and which to have
searched out myself would have involved much expense and inconvenience.
Your communication will be excellent to appear verbatim
in the book.

Pg 92

I am unable to say as to the identity of W. J. Ellsworth, but I
have written to an uncle of Colonel Ellsworth who may be able to
shed light on the matter. Colonel Keyes, when he estimated Ellsworthâs
age as ânot over 30 yearsâ when he was in Madison, was
evidently deceived by his remarkable degree of development, which
was in advance of his age: at that time he was but twenty-one, having
been born April 11, 1837.

Ellsworthâs diary I have not yet unearthed. John Hayâs article
published in
McClureâs Magazine
,
VI
, 354, has many citations from
it, but nothing concerning Madison. Mr. Hay also contributed to
the
Atlantic
, very soon after Ellsworthâs death, a fine article on him
(
VIII
, 119), and the two comprise the best literature so far published
on Ellsworth. These two young men were students in Lincolnâs law
office, and Mr. Hay all his life down to his last years mourned for
him, whom he estimated as a most wonderfully brilliant and patriotically
devoted man whose future would have been exceedingly prominent
and useful. My own investigations lead me to the same conclusion.
Yet he had very few early advantages; practically none, except a
limited district school education. His parents, whom I knew, were
plain people, and others of the relations whom I have met or corresponded
with exhibit nothing out of the common.

THE STORY OF âGLORY OF THE MORNINGâ

We are about to give the play
Glory of the Morning
. I am under
the impression that there was such a character in Wisconsin as
âGlory of the Morning,â and that she was married to a Frenchman,
and deserted by him, as in the play.

Can you give me any information concerning her?

(Mrs.) F. H. Anderson,

Brooklyn, Wisconsin
.

âGlory of the Morningâ was an historical character, and one of
the staff on the Wisconsin Historical Society related to Professor
Leonard the incident on which he founded the play. He has taken
poetâs license with certain parts—with the names, for instance, of the
son and daughter; but in
Wisconsin Historical Collections
,
VII
, 345,
you can read the story as told by a French-Canadian trader. âGlory
of the Morningâ was a Winnebago chieftess, and Jonathan Carver,
when very old, saw her at her village near Menasha, Wisconsin. The
French officer whose name was Sabrevoir Decorah (also spelled

Pg 93

DeCarrie, DesCarie, DeKaury, and other ways), came to Wisconsin
probably during the Fox wars of the early eighteenth century. He
married the daughter (âGlory of the Morningâ) of the head chief of
the tribe; resigned from the army, and became a trader. They had
two sons and a daughter. When the French and Indian War began
Decorah was summoned to become a soldier, and he took his daughter
with him to be educated in Canada. The father was killed at the
battle of
Ste.
Foye in 1760. The girl married a Montreal merchant
and her son or grandson, Laurent Fily, came to Wisconsin as a
trader and lived for many years with Augustin Grignon at Kaukauna.
Many of his letters are in the Wisconsin Historical Library.

The two sons of the chieftess became chiefs of the tribe, and had
many descendants. The Decorah family in the nineteenth century
was the most powerful of the Winnebago families. Several of its
members still live in Nebraska. Two years ago an educated Indian
girl, teacher of art at Carlisle Indian School, visited Madison. Her
maiden name was Angel Decorah, and she traced her lineage directly
to âGlory of the Morning.â The Winnebago name of the chieftess
was HopokoÃ©kaw.

THE ODANAH INDIAN RESERVATION

Will you please give me some information concerning the reservation
near Odanah, Wisconsin? I desire to learn the names of the
chiefs who ceded the reservation and also the terms of the cession;
what each member of the tribe is entitled to receive, and the address
of the agent. I am entitled to the same per-capita allotment as other
members of the tribe and this fact accounts for my interest in the
matter. Please give me, therefore, a history of the reservation.

George Allen,

Bay Shore, Michigan
.

The Chippewa of Lake Superior made a final cession of all their
lands at a treaty held at La Pointe, September 30, 1844. In return
for the cession, the government provided several reservations for the
tribesmen. That at Bad River, of which the chief town is Odanah,
comprises 124,333 acres of land. This land, at the time the reservation
was set aside, was heavily timbered. The Indians were entitled
to annuities for twenty years, and each head of a family or single
person over twenty-one years of age had the right to eighty acres

Pg 94

of land. The chiefs who signed the treaty were members of the
La Pointe band.

In 1875 the annuities were paid for the last time, according to
the treaty stipulations. Congress, however, in consideration of the
Indiansâ need, made appropriations to continue the payments for
several years. After 1882 the Indian Department permitted the sale
of timber from the reservation; logging operations furnished wages
for the working Indians, and the sale of the timber placed a considerable
sum to their credit. The Chippewa claimed additional sums
on treaty stipulations. Whether these claims have ever been settled
or not can be ascertained from the Indian Department at Washington.
As for the land, by 1913, 83,871 acres had been allotted in
eighty-acre tracts to genuine claimants. Enough of the reservation
remains for more eighty-acre tracts to be assigned to those who can
prove their rights to claims. Timber is still being taken from the
reservation.

For further information write to R. S. Buckland, special agent
for the Chippewa Indians, Baraga, Michigan; or to Philip S. Everest,
superintendent, Ashland, Wisconsin.

FIRST EXPLORATION OF EASTERN WISCONSIN

I should be pleased to ascertain who was the first white man to
pass or voyage past the shores of Sheboygan County, Jolliet and
Marquette or Father Claude Allouez? Allouez is said to have been
the first to explore the west shore of Lake Michigan, but I have not
been able to find out whether he reached Sheboygan County.

Alfonse Gerend,

Cato, Wisconsin
.

We dislike very much to say dogmatically who was the first
Frenchman to skirt the coast of Lake Michigan south of Sturgeon
Bay portage. The more we study the subject the more we are inclined
to believe that the records we possess reveal but a fragment of the
activities of the French explorers, traders, and missionaries around
Green Bay during the seventeenth century. We do not know but
that Jean Nicolet may have coasted south in 1634; on the other
hand, we do not know that he did. No one has yet been wise enough
to lay out the course of the wanderings of Radisson and Groseilliers.
For my own part, it seems probable that one of the first, if not

Pg 95

the first, white Frenchman who visited all the villages between Green
Bay and Chicago was Nicolas Perrot, who between 1665-70 spent
five years in the country, much of the time with the Potawatomi
tribesmen. Benjamin Sulte, a very careful Canadian investigator,
asserts categorically that Perrot was the first white man at Chicago.
(Sulteâs articles in French in the Canada Royal Society
Proceedings
,
1903-13, throw much light on early seventeenth century conditions.
They have never been translated, and are known only to a few
scholars.) So far as I am able to judge, however, Sulteâs statement
is based purely upon inference and is not backed by a written account.
Therefore, it is certainly fair to say that the first definite written
record of white men skirting the coast of the western shore of Lake
Michigan is found in the journal of Father Jacques Marquette, who
in September, 1673 came back to Green Bay via the Chicago and
Sturgeon Bay portages.

With regard to Father Claude Allouez, I think we can speak with
more certainty. He did not go to the Illinois mission until after the
death of Marquette. He set out in the autumn of 1676 and wintered
among the Potawatomi near Sturgeon Bay. You will find a synopsis
of his voyage in
Wisconsin Historical Collections
,
XVI
, 96.

A COMMUNITY CHANGES ITS NAME

Some twenty-five years ago there was a place in Wisconsin called
North Greenfield. Evidently the name has been changed for the
reason that letters addressed to individuals at that place are returned,
with the information that there is no such place in the state.

What is the present name of the locality formerly known as North
Greenfield?

Seymour Morris,

Chicago, Illinois

The post office, situated in Milwaukee County, and known as
North Greenfield, changed its name about 1903, when it became
West Allis.

HOW THE APOSTLE ISLANDS WERE NAMED

If such record exists, I should like to obtain from it a statement
of how the individual islands of the Apostle group received their
names, and how the group came to be named Apostle Islands.

H. E. Hale,

Minneapolis, Minnesota
.

The collective name of Apostle Islands for the group off the coast
of Chequamegon Bay is nearly two centuries old. The first map on
which it appears is that of Bellin in 1744. This was founded on the
information given by Father Pierre FranÃ§ois Xavier de Charlevoix,
a noted Jesuit missionary, who in 1721 visited the western country
as an agent for the French government. Charlevoix did not go into
Lake Superior in person, but at Sault Ste. Marie and Mackinac he
made extensive inquiries of competent observers, and noted down the
information given him by traders and officers from that region. Thus
he, no doubt, learned that the islands were known to the French who
frequented that place as âThe Twelve Apostles,â and as such they
appear on the map of Bellin that was issued in Charlevoixâs book
published in Paris in 1744.

The first English traveler to note these islands was Jonathan
Carver, who coasted the shore of Lake Superior in 1767 and on the
map published in his volume of
Travels
(London, 1778) repeats the
name âTwelve Apostle Is.â

The first American travelers in that region were those who accompanied
Lewis Cass, who in 1820 made an official voyage along the
southern shore of Lake Superior. One of the members of this party
was James D. Doty, who was afterwards territorial governor of
Wisconsin. In Dotyâs journal, published in
Wisconsin Historical
Collections
,
XIII
, 201, he says: âThe Islands, called by Charlevoix
'the 12 Apostles,â extend about 20 miles from point Chegoiamegon.â
Another member of the same party was Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, who
later became Indian agent at Sault Ste. Marie, and married a half-breed
Indian girl descended from the Chequamegon chiefs. Schoolcraft
proposed to change the name of the Twelve Apostle Islands to
Federation Islands. He assigned to the several islands the names of
states of the Union, giving that of Virginia to Madelaine, the largest
of the group. Schoolcraftâs proposal was not followed, but the

Pg 97

present names of York and Michigan Islands seem to remain as part
of Schoolcraftâs proposal. Apparently the early traders, counting
the islands loosely, thought there were twelve in all, and since the
mission was named Mission du Saint Esprit (or Holy Ghost Mission)
the name of Twelve Apostles Islands seemed appropriate.
There are (we believe) in reality nineteen, nevertheless the name,
Apostle Islands, has persisted.

With regard to the several names of the separate islands: We
have above accounted for York and Michigan. Outer Island explains
itself, as do Ironwood, Oak, Basswood, Sand, Rocky, North and South
Twin, Bear, Cat (Wild Cat, no doubt), and Otter. Raspberry Island
takes its name from Raspberry River. This name was used in its
French form
RiviÃ¨re Ã  la Framboise
as early as 1804 (probably
earlier). See
Wisconsin Historical Collections
,
XIX
, 174. Devil
Island and Manitou Island are both the same name. That is, the
Indians called all supernatural beings âmanitous.â Hermit Island
and Stockton Island have probably some local significance from
dwellers upon their area. We are not informed concerning them.
Madelaine Island has been known by many names. Its present name
is that of the wife of an early trader, Michel Cadotte. She was an
Indian woman whose father was a local chief. Madelaine was the
name she received when baptized. The island was frequently known
as
St.
Michel, or
St.
Michaelâs, from the given name of Cadotte, who
was the principal trader on the island for many years. Its Indian
name was Moningwanekaning, supposed to mean the Place of the
Golden-breasted Woodpecker (hence, sometimes, Woodpecker
Island). However, Father Chrysostom Verwyst, a Catholic missionary,
now our best authority on Chippewa place names, defines it
recently in
Acta et Dicta
(July, 1916), published by the Catholic
Historical Society of
St.
Paul, as âthe place where there are many
lapwings.â This island has also been called La Ronde, for a French
commandant of the eighteenth century; La Pointe Island, from the
name of the region La Pointe du Chequamegon; and Saint Esprit
Island from the early Mission du
St.
Esprit mentioned above. It was
also sometimes called Middle Island as lying midway between Sault
Ste. Marie and Fort William, the fur-trade post on the northwest
of Lake Superior. Sometimes it appears on maps as Montreal

Pg 98

Island; the reason for this we do not know; perhaps it was the
terminus of the trip from Montreal, Canada, or was so named because
some of its inhabitants had been educated at Montreal.

To recapitulate: the largest island of the Apostle Group was
first known as Moningwanekaning or Woodpecker or Lapwing; in
the eighteenth century as La Ronde, La Pointe, and
St.
Esprit; was
known to the fur traders as Middle and Montreal; was christened by
Schoolcraft, Virginia; has been known since about 1800 as Cadotteâs,

St.
Michaelâs, or Madelaine from its early inhabitants, and the
baptismal name of the Indian woman has persisted.

THE SERVICES OF THE MENOMINEE IN THE BLACK
HAWK WAR

I wish to thank you very much for the information you gave me
in your letter of October 30, 1916. I would have answered sooner
than this but as you requested me to give you a list of my grandfatherâs
descendants I wanted first to find some one who knew how
many children and grandchildren my grandfather, Osh-ka-he-nah-niew,
had. I have not been able to get this information from the old
members of the tribe, but as soon as I get it I will write you again
and let you know.

The name Osh-ka-he-nah-niew in the Menominee Indian language
means âyoung man.â

I received a letter from Mr. J. L. Baity, auditor of the Treasury
Department, Washington, D. C., dated November 25, 1916, in which
he says:

âWith return of the letter from the Superintendent of the State
Historical Society of Wisconsin, dated October 30, 1916, addressed
to Mr. Mitchell Oshkenaniew, you are advised that the information
set forth in said letter is too meager for the War Department to
establish the service of 'Oshkenaniewâ Menominee Indian Warrior
Black Hawk War 1832, and until sufficient information can be furnished
setting forth the organization in which service was rendered
together with the period of service and the names of some commanding
officer, no further action will be taken on the claim.â

Mitchell Oshkenaniew,

Neopit, Wisconsin
.

Col.
George Boyd was Indian agent at Green Bay in the summer
of 1832; he replaced
Col.
Samuel C. Stambaugh early in June.
Stambaugh, although superseded, did not immediately leave Green

Pg 99

Bay and was very popular with the Menominee tribe. During the
course of the war, when all trace of the whereabouts of the Sauk band
had been lost,
Gen.
Henry Atkinson, encamped on Whitewater River
in Wisconsin, sent
Col.
William S. Hamilton (son of Alexander
Hamilton) to Colonel Boyd at Green Bay. Atkinson feared that
Black Hawk and the Sauk hostiles would attempt to escape to the
British at Malden, and he therefore ordered Boyd to enlist and equip
as large a body of Menominee Indians as possible to try to intercept
them. Boyd at once called the Menominee together. They were
willing to go to war against the Sauk if they might have officers of
their own choosing.
Col.
S. C. Stambaugh was thereupon made
commander-in-chief. The second place was offered to
Col.
W. S.
Hamilton, but he declined the honor. The Menominee turned out
about three hundred warriors, who were organized into two companies
commanded by the following officers: 1st Company; Augustin
Grignon, captain, Charles A. Grignon Jr., first lieutenant;
2d.
Company;
George Johnston, captain, James M. Boyd, first lieutenant,
William Powell, second lieutenant and interpreter. Alexander J.
Irwin was charged with the commissariat with rank of first lieutenant.

There is every reason to suppose that Osh-ka-he-nah-niew was a
member of the first company. Augustin Grignon told Doctor Draper
that this Indian was in the war, and in all probability he named
members of his own command. Robert Grignon of this company
received a wound in action, and was in receipt of a pension until his
death.

The documentary material in the Wisconsin Historical Library
includes the official papers of
Col.
George Boyd, Indian agent. Those
relating to the Menominee contingent under Stambaugh in the Black
Hawk War are published in
Wisconsin Historical Collections
,
XII
,
270-98. It will be noticed that August 12, 1832, Boyd wrote that
Stambaugh had informed him that he had arrived at Fort Winnebago
with his command, three hundred Menominees, and was on his way
to report to General Scott. September 2, 1832, Boyd wrote to
G. B. Porter, governor of Michigan territory, enclosing Stambaughâs
report of the expedition and the Muster Rolls of the Menominee.
These should be in the War Department at Washington.

Pg 100

The well-known fact that Osh-ka-he-nah-niew took part in the
Black Hawk War, that he was part of Stambaughâs band, probably
under
Capt.
Augustin Grignon, seems to us established by the historical
evidence. His name on a muster roll must be sought in the
documentary material at Washington.

SURVEY OF HISTORICAL ACTIVITIES

THE SOCIETY AND THE STATE

Since the sixty-fourth meeting in October, 1916, four life and
twenty-four annual members have been enrolled in the State Historical
Society. The new life members are: R. C. Ballard-Thruston
of Louisville, Kentucky, John Strange of Neenah, Chester Lloyd
Jones of Madison, and Harry W. Bolens of Port Washington. The
annual members are Dr. James S. Reeve and Henry L. Tinker of
Appleton; John T. Durward of Baraboo; John J. Wood of Berlin;
Leland S. Kemnitz of Detroit, Michigan; Amasa J. Edminster and
R. C. Rodecker of Holcombe; Oscar G. Boisseau of Holden, Missouri;
Walter M. Atwood, William H. Faust, Clarence B. Lester,
Edwin C. Mason, Mary Oakley, Frederic A. Ogg, and Mrs. Jessie
Russell Skinner of Madison; Clarence R. Falk and Arthur G. Santer
of Milwaukee; Ruth Thompson of Minneapolis, Minnesota; Mrs.
L. T. Hill of Sparta; Katherine A. Rood of Stevens Point; John S.
Roeseler of Superior; Arthur T. Leith of Washington, D. C.; E. P.
Winkelman of Waterloo; and Philip B. Gordon of White Earth,
Minnesota.

In the same period the Society has lost by death five of its members:
David J. Ryan of Appleton; William N. Merriam of Duluth,
Minnesota; Hon. John A. Aylward,
Gen.
Benjamin F. Cram, and
Justice William H. Timlin of Madison. Probably the list should
include names of other members, of whose deaths the administration
of the Society has not yet been apprised.

By the will of Hon. George B. Burrows of Madison, who died in
1909, his entire estate was bequeathed, subject to certain contingencies,
to the State Historical Society. Through the death in October,
1916, of the testatorâs only son and heir the estate at length comes
to the Society. At the time of Mr. Burrowsâ death in 1909 its
appraised value was fixed at $219,000. It is the belief of those best
informed in the premises that its present value is considerably in
excess of that sum. The property will be available for the Societyâs
use when the usual court procedure shall have been gone through with.

By the death of Miss Genevieve Mills of Madison at the close of
1916 another important bequest to the Society became public knowledge.
Miss Mills made a will by the terms of which the Society is
ultimately to receive her half-interest in the old Mills homestead at

Pg 102

the corner of Monona Avenue and Wilson Street, Madison. The will
states that the property is given âas a tribute to the loyalty of my
mother Maria L. Mills and my father Simeon Mills toward the State
and the State Historical Society they loved and helped to found.â
The sum realized from the property is to constitute a perpetual fund,
named in honor of the giverâs parents the âMaria L. and Simeon Mills
Editorial Fundâ; the proceeds of the fund thus established are to be
devoted to the editing of materials for middle-western history, preferably
that of Wisconsin itself. The present value of this wise gift
is supposed to be in the neighborhood of $25,000. How soon it will
become available to the Society is still uncertain.

The last few months have witnessed an unusually large number
of changes in the staff of the Wisconsin Historical Library. In
September, 1916, Mr. Frederick Merk, for five years research assistant
on the Societyâs staff, began an indefinite leave of absence, with
a view to prosecuting his graduate studies at Harvard University,
where he had received a teaching-fellowship appointment. In January
Miss Lydia Brauer of the editorial staff was compelled by illness
to relinquish her position. In February Miss Alice Whitney, assistant
in the museum, withdrew to accept a much better position in the
Emporia Normal School. The close of the fiscal year in June witnessed
several resignations of long-time members of the staff. Miss
Eleanore Lothrop, for several years the superintendentâs secretary,
withdrew in order to accept a position in the East. Mr. Lyell Deaner
of the newspaper division answered the call of his country by enlisting
in the army. Others whose resignations went into effect in June were
Miss Pauline Buell of the reference division, and Miss Ora Smith of
the order department.

To fill these and other gaps in the ranks of the Library staff the
following appointments have been made: In September, 1916, Miss
Ruth Hayward, for several years cataloguer in the Cincinnati Public
Library, became a member of our cataloguing staff. In February,
Miss Genevieve Deming and Miss Ruth Roberts, recent graduates of
the University of Wisconsin, began work as assistants in the order
department and museum, respectively. Mr. Gaige Roberts of Madison
filled the vacant position in the newspaper division. In July
Miss Marguerite Jenison of Fond du Lac, a recent graduate of the
state university, began work as assistant to the superintendent and
calendarer of the Draper manuscripts. Mr. Theodore Blegen,
teacher of history in the Riverside High School, Milwaukee, spent
the summer months as research worker on the Societyâs staff. Finally,
Dr. John W. Oliver, of the Indiana State Library, began work in
September on an appointment as research assistant.

Pg 103

The current year of the Society (October, 1916-October, 1917)
has been one of unusual activity in the field of research and publication.
In the nine months ending July 1, 1917 three substantial volumes
and two bulletins were issued, in addition to certain minor items.
The volumes were:
Frontier Advance on the Upper Ohio
(
Collections

of the Society,
Vol. XXIII
), edited by Louise P. Kellogg;
An Economic
History of Wisconsin During the Civil War Decade
(
Studies

of the Society,
Vol. I
), by Frederick Merk, and the
Proceedings
of
the Society for 1916. Each of these volumes will receive fuller
notice elsewhere. The two bulletins were a
List of Portraits and
Paintings in the Wisconsin Historical Museum
and a checklist of

Periodicals and Newspapers
currently received by the library.

A new publication feature, begun in February, 1917, is a
monthly
Checklist of Wisconsin Public Documents
. Each issue,
appearing about the tenth of the month, lists the documents of the
state issued during the preceding month. Of this publication the

Mississippi Valley Historical Review
for June, 1917 says: âThis is
a unique undertaking for a state historical agency. The value to
historians, librarians, and state officials, of such a series of bulletins
makes it a welcome bibliographical addition.â It may be added that,
so far as the Societyâs administration is aware, the undertaking is
unique not simply for a âstate historical agency,â but for any agency
whatever. The Library of Congress attempts to do for the entire
country what the Wisconsin
Checklist
does for our state alone.
Useful as the Library of Congress list is, however, it cannot possibly
cover the various states with the promptness and comprehensiveness
which attaches to our own list for Wisconsin. The credit for the
conception of this publication enterprise of the Society and for its
execution belongs to Mrs. Anna W. Evans, chief of the public-documents
division of the library.

Of research enterprises under way but not yet completed, or if
completed not yet issued from the press, the following may be noted.
A valuable account, as it is believed, of the public-documents division
of the library, prepared by Mrs. Evans, has been long in the hands
of the state printer. Material for a succeeding volume of the Draper
Series (to be published as Vol. XXIV of the Societyâs
Collections
,
with the title
Frontier Retreat on the Upper Ohio, 1779-1781
)
should, with reasonable promptness on the state printerâs part, be
distributed to our members about the time they receive this magazine.
Copy for Volume
XXV
of the
Collections
was given to the
printer in the spring, and in the usual order of things it may be
expected to be ready for distribution near the close of 1917. It
consists of the letters of Edwin Bottomley, a pioneer Racine County

Pg 104

farmer, written to his father in England in the years 1842-50. At
the time of writing (July) the preparation for the printer of a second
volume of the Draper Calendar Series, is approaching completion,
and its publication may be expected to follow the usual interval of
time required by the state printer. Dr. Edward Kremers of the
University of Wisconsin has been engaged for many months in the
editing of what will become the initial volume of the Societyâs Hollister
Pharmaceutical Series. More definite announcement concerning
it may well be postponed for the present. It is believed, however,
that the Societyâs constituency may anticipate with pleasure the
appearance of this initial volume of what will constitute a new and
unique undertaking among American historical societies. Another,
but minor, research enterprise under way is the preparation by Mr.
Blegen of a comprehensive report on the Wisconsin archives situation—a
subject, it may be noted, concerning which there is crying
need of public enlightenment. To conclude this summary catalogue,
in the
Wisconsin Magazine of History
the reader has before him the
initial installment of the Societyâs most recent publication enterprise.

A sum of money has been placed at the disposal of the National
Board for Historical Service whereby it is enabled to announce a
prize essay contest open to public school teachers in each of the
several states of the Union on the subject âWhy the United States
is at War.â To teachers in the public high schools of Wisconsin five
prizes ranging from $75 down to $10 are offered; for elementary
public school teachers, three prizes ($75, $25, and $10) will be
awarded. Essays must not exceed 3,000 words and must be in the
hands of Waldo G. Leland, 1133 Woodward Building, Washington,
D. C., not later than six oâclock
P. M.
, November 15, 1917. The
awards will be made by boards of Wisconsin judges appointed by
the State Historical Society. The essays will not be signed and the
committees of award will not be informed concerning the authorâs
names until after their decision shall have been rendered. In announcing
the contest the National Board states that it is intended
to lay stress, in making the awards, on intelligent use made of such
materials as may be accessible to the competitor living in small communities
with no large library at hand. It is to be hoped that a large
number of Wisconsin teachers will enter this contest. Every participant
in it will be a winner; this regardless of whether he gains one
of the prizes awarded, since the intellectual and patriotic stimulus
he will experience will in themselves more than repay the labor
involved. For full particulars concerning the contest apply at your
nearest normal school or college, or directly to the National Board
for Historical Service, 1133 Woodward Bldg., Washington, D. C.

Dr. E. D. Pierce of Trempealeau, one of the Societyâs curators,
has been engaged the past year in editing a history of Trempealeau
County, to be published shortly by the Cooper Company of Chicago
and Winona. In this connection, the editor has been given the use
of a short history of Wisconsin to 1848, prepared by Miss Kellogg
for publication by the State Historical Society. Probably this narrative
will appear shortly in this magazine. It was prepared with a
view to placing it freely at the disposal of county historians and any
others who may find it useful; this in the belief that since the subscription
county history is often the only book of a historical character
which comes into the homes of our citizens, the Society is acting
in line with its ideal of serving the public as fully as possible by doing
what it may to improve the quality of these volumes.

Another Wisconsin local history approaching completion at the
hands of a curator of the Society is the history of Door County by
Mr. Hjalmar R. Holand of Ephraim. It is understood that this
is to be published by the Lewis Company of Chicago.

The eleventh annual meeting of the Waukesha County Historical
Society was held at the Congregational Church in Waukesha on
May 5, 1917. Aside from business reports and luncheon and other
social features, the principal part of the program was devoted to
two addresses: one by Judge C. E. Armin on âThe Early Bar of
Waukesha Countyâ; the other by M. M. Quaife on Increase Allen
Lapham. The Society voted at this meeting to send its secretary,
Miss Julia A. Lapham of Oconomowoc, as a delegate to the annual
meeting of the State Historical Society in October. This is an act
which it is hoped will be widely imitated by the other local societies
of the state, since mutual encouragement and profit will undoubtedly
result from a greater participation by them in the affairs of the
parent organization.

On June 16, 1917 under the auspices of the Waukesha County
Historical Society, a bronze tablet in memory of Increase A. Lapham
was unveiled on Lapham Peak. Lapham Peak, until recently known
as Government Hill, is the highest point in Waukesha County. From
an observation tower which formerly stood within a few feet of the
tablet it is said that one could see, on a clear day, Lake Michigan on
the east and as far as Madison on the west. No more appropriate
spot for a memorial to Wisconsinâs first great naturalist could have
been chosen than this, with its far-sweeping view of the beautiful
lakes and valleys and hills of southern Wisconsin. The tablet was
unveiled by Julia A. Lapham, daughter of Dr. Lapham. Present
also were two sons and a granddaughter of the scholar in whose
honor the assemblage had convened. Addresses were given by M. M.

Pg 106

Quaife of the State Historical Society and John G. Gregory, editor
of the Milwaukee
Evening Wisconsin
. The tablet, affixed to a large
gray boulder, bears this inscription:

Mr. W. W. Bartlett of Eau Claire, an enthusiastic cultivator of
the local historical field, has been running for many months a series
of lumbering articles and reminiscences dealing particularly with
the Chippewa Valley. He has recently given a lecture, illustrated
with lantern slides, on the subject of logging in the Chippewa to an
audience of Norwegian-Americans, most of whom were familiar with
the industry before coming to America. Mr. Bartlett is chairman
of the history section of the Eau Claire County Defense Council.

The Agricultural College of the University of Wisconsin has
prepared a moving-picture film depicting the historical stages in the
invention of the Babcock test. Fortunately it was possible to have
as principal actors in the scenario the two men who played the principal
rÃ´les in the original discovery, Professor Babcock and Professor
Henry.

The Wisconsin Archeological Society, which holds monthly meetings
during the year in the Milwaukee Library-Museum, has been
giving during the past year a series of lectures on American anthropology
and archeology, the subjects ranging from descriptions of
the Eskimo to the antiquities of Brazil. For the coming year President
Barrett proposes a series of lectures which will constitute a
course of study in American anthropology, with its relations to
geology, zoÃ¶logy, ethnobotany, folk lore, and the fur trade.

The Milwaukee Museum is planning to install a replica of Solomon
Juneauâs fur-trade post, in anticipation of next yearâs centenary of
Juneauâs first appearance on the site of Milwaukee.

On February 22 the Milwaukee Old Settlersâ Club, organized in
1869, held its annual banquet at the Pfister Hotel. During the year

Pg 107

thirty-two of its members had been claimed by death. On May 17
many members of the club joined in celebrating the ninetieth birthday
of Frederick Layton, the Milwaukee philanthropist.

The old settlers of Pierce and
St.
Croix counties held a âhomecomingâ
at Ellsworth on June 20. The qualification for membership
in the organization is forty yearsâ residence in the
St.
Croix Valley.

On January 17 the old settlers of De Pere met at the Presbyterian
Church. Speeches relating to the early history of the Fox River
Valley were delivered.

In connection with the summer session of the University of Wisconsin
an archeological and local historical excursion was given
July 7. This is the fourth time that Curator Charles E. Brown,
assisted by local historians, has coÃ¶perated with the university in
arranging such a field day. The number of excursionists is limited
to one hundred, and admission to the privilege is eagerly sought by
students from distant parts of the United States, who desire to learn
of the first things in Madisonâs environment.

Pageantry is proving one of the most attractive means of popularizing
and visualizing history. At Milton Collegeâs semi-centennial
its history was vivified by a pageant written by the faculty and produced
by the literary societies. West Allis, under the joint auspices
of the schools and the library, enjoyed a pageant in the early summer,
written by W. E. Jillson, city librarian.

At Monroe on June 7 the commencement exercises of the high
school took the form of a historical pageant. The Mitchell Park
Sane Fourth Committee provided a pageant for Milwaukee southsiders
on our national holiday. A number of other pageants that
had been planned have been postponed because of war conditions.

St.
Gabrielâs Catholic Church at Prairie du Chien celebrated its
one-hundredth anniversary June 10-12. Bishop Schweback was the
guest of honor. To this church undoubtedly belongs the honor of
being the oldest parish in the state, since the records preserved show
that baptisms and marriages were performed, and a cemetery consecrated
in the spring of 1817 by Father Joseph Dunand, a Trappist
monk from the Illinois monastery opposite
St.
Louis.

The eightieth birthday of the Milwaukee
Sentinel
was celebrated
June 27. This famous paper, whose editors have enjoyed national
reputations, was first issued in the second year of Wisconsinâs territorial
career, having been founded by Solomon Juneau to herald the
fame of the east-side town whose interests he was promoting. The
present publishers issued a memorial edition of the paper on June 24,
giving a historical rÃ©sumÃ© of the
Sentinelâs
past.

Nashotah House, the mother seminary of the Episcopal Church
in the Northwest, celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary at the

Pg 108

commencement in May. The historical address was delivered by

Rev.
T. M. McLean of Duluth. This seminary was the outgrowth
of the efforts of Bishop Jackson Kemper, whose extensive private
papers, fully illustrating his missionary career, are included in the
State Historical Societyâs manuscript collections.

The seventy-first anniversary of the inauguration of Solomon
Juneau as first mayor of Milwaukee was noticed by the city press,
which published an illustration of the First Spring Street Methodist
Episcopal Church, within whose walls the ceremony occurred.

The fiftieth anniversary of Milton College was celebrated June
16-20. Six college presidents of the state and the dean of the University
of Wisconsin participated in the exercises.

The Dania Society of Racine, one of the largest Danish-American
organizations in the United States, commemorated its fiftieth anniversary
on May 19.

The Seattle
Post-Intelligencer
of February 25 printed an interview
with Edwin U. Judd, now living in his ninety-first year at Anacortes,
Washington. Mr. Judd was a resident of Waupun during
the fifties of the last century and was the chairman of the Free Soil
party for his district when the Republican party was born in 1854
at Ripon. He is probably the last survivor of those who signed the
call for a mass convention at Madison in July of that year. His
recollections of Alvin A. Bovay and the motives for the caucus at
Ripon, February 12, 1854, are interesting material for the historian
of political parties.

Mrs. Louisa Sawin Brayton, first school teacher of Madison,
died at her home in that city May 30, aged one hundred and one
years. Mrs. Brayton came to Madison in 1838. She was a prophet
not without honor in her home city; for many years her neighbors
had delighted to celebrate her birthday and the Brayton public
school is named for her.

Prof.
Frederick J. Turner, in recent years of Harvard University,
but Wisconsin born and bred, is a member of the National
Board for Historical Service, recently organized at Washington to
mobilize the historical scholarship of the country to serve it in its
time of need.
Prof.
Carl R. Fish of the history department of
the University of Wisconsin is also a member of this board.

Mrs. Lois Kimball Mathews, associate professor of history and
dean of women at the University of Wisconsin, was elected in April
president of the Association of Collegiate AlumnÃ¦, the largest organization
of college women in the United States.

Louis Sky, or Ossawah, of the Chippewa Bad River Reservation,
was recently granted a pension for his services during the Civil War.

Pg 109

This recalls the fact that numbers of Chippewa, Menominee, and
Winnebago braves went from our state to serve their country in
1861-65. Their descendants are now offering themselves in considerable
numbers to fight for Uncle Sam on the plains of France.

Through the generosity of Mrs. John H. Davidson, the Oshkosh
chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution has erected
tablets on the Indian mounds at Oakwood, on the southern shore of
Lake Butte des Morts.

Milwaukeeâs
Eintracht Gesellschaft
was founded June 19, 1867.
In honor of the fiftieth anniversary a banquet was given on June 19
of the present year.

On May 20,
St.
Johnâs Lutheran Church at Boscobel held a commemorative
service in honor of its founding fifty years ago.

Rev.
T. S. Johnson of the Presbyterian Church of Beaver
Dam had the rare distinction of celebrating this spring a pastorate
of fifty yearsâ duration.

A large number of interesting and valuable objects were given
to the Historical Society for the museum during the first half of
1917. A few of the more important are noted below:

The four survivors of the volunteer fire company known as the
Madison Engine Company
No.
2, organized in 1856, have donated
to the Society all their equipment and records, including a silk flag,
silver trumpets, brass lanterns, helmets, and belts. The patriotic
work of the pioneer volunteer fire-fighters constitutes an interesting
chapter in the history of the state.

With the coÃ¶peration of various individuals and governmental
agencies hundreds of war posters and other material pertaining to
the great struggle on which the nation is embarked are coming to the
museum. A number of special exhibits of this material were held
during the summer in the museum halls. It is expected that in a
future issue of this magazine will be presented an article by Mr.
Brown on the collecting and the character of this contemporary historical
material.

From Mr. Thomas Wilson of Black Earth, Civil War soldier in
the Twelfth Wisconsin Regiment, a collection of sixty or more tintypes
of members of his company taken at Memphis, has been received.
Mr. Wilson also gave to the Society an army overcoat worn by himself
and an officerâs sword and sash worn by his brother, Captain
Francis Wilson.

Two Spanish War mementos have been deposited in the museum
by Miss A. C. Anderson of Madison. One is a Spanish flag taken
from the custom house at Santiago by members of Company A,
Second U. S. Cavalry, when the city was captured in 1898. The
other is a Moro flag captured in the Philippines by the same company.

Pg 110

The class of 1897, University of Wisconsin, has given a three-inch
shrapnel shell, properly cross-sectioned, of the type now in use
by the Allies in the European War.

By the will of the late W. W. Warner of Madison the Society
has received a collection of Indian stone and other implements, and
an elaborate Swiss music box. The latter is reputed to be the finest
instrument of its kind in the Northwest.

During the current year especial efforts have been devoted to
developing the Societyâs collection of newspapers. As a result the
list of papers currently received at the library covers in a general
way every section of the United States and more intensively the
middle-western section more immediately tributary to the library.
If this policy can be adhered to permanently, future generations of
students who come to consult the library will find a much more comprehensive
and logically ordered collection of newspapers than do
those of the present time.

Along with this reaching out for current issues, the library continues,
slowly but persistently, to add to its files of old newspapers.
The more important non-current newspaper accessions in the nine
months ending July 1, 1917, are as follows:

The annual meeting of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association
was held at Chicago, April 26-28, 1917.
Prof.
R. B. Way
of Beloit was chairman of the program committee, while
Prof.

Frederic Logan Paxson of the University of Wisconsin, as president
of the association, delivered the annual address. His subject was
âThe Rise of Sports, 1876-93.â Other Wisconsin men who delivered
addresses during the sessions of the association were
Prof.
James
A. James, now of Northwestern University, Theodore C. Blegen of
Milwaukee, and
Prof.
Sherwood of La Crosse. M. M. Quaife of
Madison was elected to the board of editors of the
Mississippi Valley
Historical Review
for a three-year term, while all the newly-elected
members of the executive committee of the association were educated
at Wisconsin. These were
Prof.
O. G. Libby of the University
of North Dakota, Homer C. Hockett of Ohio State University, and
Albert H. Sanford of La Crosse.

The important Bancroft Manuscript Collection at Berkeley,
California has been placed in charge of
Prof.
Herbert E. Bolton.
Mr. Bolton is a native of Wisconsin and was graduated at the
university in 1895.

The annual address before the State Historical Society at the
coming October meeting will be given by
Prof.
Frederic Logan
Paxson of the University of Wisconsin. Plans are being made for a
more active participation on the part of local societies in the program
of the annual meeting than has been the case in the past. With
a reasonable degree of interest on the part of the members of the
state and local societies it is believed that a better and more profitable
annual meeting can be held than any in recent years.

SOME PUBLICATIONS

Volume
XXII
of the Societyâs
Collections
,
The Journals of
Captain Meriwether Lewis and John Ordway
, distributed in the
summer of 1916, has attracted much attention at the hands of historical
editors and others. Of it the
Iowa Journal of History and
Politics
says: âIt is perhaps not too much to say that, no publication
of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin possesses a wider interest
than this book.â The review in the
Washington Historical
Quarterly
concludes: âThose who have collected the works of Lewis
and Clark should certainly secure this book. It makes a rich supplement

Pg 112

to any of the other editions.â In similar fashion the review
of the book published in the
American Historical Review
closes with
the statement, âThe Historical Society of Wisconsin is to be congratulated
on the publication of this volume.â

Volume
XXIII
of the Societyâs
Collections
(
Frontier Advance
on the Upper Ohio, 1778-79
) and Mr. Merkâs
Economic History of
Wisconsin During the Civil War Decade
have been distributed too
recently to have attracted much attention at the hands of the reviewers
at the time of our going to press. On the part of the newspapers
of Wisconsin, however, Mr. Merkâs volume has already evoked
much notice and comment. The Milwaukee
Sentinel
and other papers
of the state have republished numerous extracts from the book, while
the Chippewa Falls
Independent
devoted special attention to the
chapters on the history of the lumbering industry in Wisconsin.
The expected comment of our historical neighbors on these two volumes
will be noted in a future number of the
Magazine
.

The annual volume of
Proceedings
of the Society for the year
1916 came from the press and was distributed to our members and
exchanges in July. The volume is longer than any of its predecessors,
and the workmanship of the printer is probably the best of any
in the long series of annual volumes put out by the Society. Aside
from the business report and other routine proceedings, the book
contains eight historical papers. The most interesting and valuable
of these is Captain Arthur L. Congerâs study of âPresident Lincoln
as War Statesman,â delivered as the annual address before the
Society in 1916. Unless we mistake greatly, this paper will quickly
gain recognition as one of the most trenchant studies yet made of
Lincolnâs career. Four studies of a biographical character are the
reminiscences of Father Chrysostom Verwyst of Bayfield and of
Mary Elizabeth Mears, early Wisconsin authoress; âNew Light on
the Career of Nathaniel Pryor,â sergeant on the exploring expedition
of Lewis and Clark; and an account of the military career of
Major Earl, noted Wisconsin Civil War scout. A study of âThe
Beginnings of the Norwegian Press in Americaâ reveals the fact,
interesting to citizens of Wisconsin, that this state, rather than its
western neighbor, was originally and for long the chief seat of Norwegian
development in America. Hence the story of the beginnings
of the Norwegian press in the United States is almost wholly a Wisconsin
story. Another local study is that of the long-drawn-out
âWatertown Railway Bond Fight,â one of the notable legal
contests in American history. Finally, and of more general import,
is âThe Dream of a Northwestern Confederacy,â which recites the
story of the rise and decline of the hopes of the Southern people to

Pg 113

draw off the Northwest from the remainder of the Union and in so
doing to win the struggle for its disruption.

By the will of Joseph Pulitzer, the noted New York journalist,
provision is made for the establishment of an annual prize of $2,000
by the authorities of Columbia University for the best book of the
year in American history. It is interesting to note that the first
award, announced at the 1917 commencement of Columbia, was made,
not to a professional historian but to a busy man of affairs, the
French ambassador to the United States, Monsieur J. J. Jusserand,
for his volume
With Americans of Past and Present Days
. The book
includes four important and charming historical studies. The
longest, âRochambeau and the French in America,â presents a narrative,
based largely on hitherto unused sources, of this able but
neglected soldier in the war for our national independence. The
other studies deal with âWashington and the French,â âMajor
LâEnfant in the Federal City,â and âAbraham Lincoln.â The latter
paper is particularly interesting as showing the contemporary
French estimate of President Lincoln and the popular sentiment in
France in favor of the Union. Thoroughly scholarly and charmingly
written, the volume is commended as an agreeable companion
for a leisure evening.

A second annual prize established by Mr. Pulitzer is one of $1,000
awarded for the best American biography teaching patriotism and
service. It was first awarded to Mrs. Laura E. Richards and Mrs.
Maud Howe Elliott for their biography of their mother, Julia Ward
Howe. The noble career of this talented woman should ever serve
as an inspiration to her countrymen. Especially at this time of
stress are we grateful for her immortal âBattle Hymn of the Republic.â
Like M. Jusserandâs book, the work is unreservedly commended
to our readers.

One of the most important and scholarly studies in the field of
western history to appear in many years is Clarence W. Alvordâs

The Mississippi Valley in British Politics: A Study of the Trade
Speculation, and Experiments in Imperialism Culminating in the
American Revolution
. The book is beautifully printed in two volumes
by Arthur H. Clark of Cleveland. It is Professor Alvordâs
contention that the seeker after the causes leading to the American
Revolution will find them chiefly in connection with the policies and
efforts of the British ministers to organize the imperial American
domain which came to it from France in the Seven Yearsâ War, rather
than in the incidents and events along the Atlantic seaboard to which
historians have paid chief attention hitherto.

Pg 114

Of particular interest to Wisconsin readers is the volume,
Early
Narratives of the Northwest, 1634-1699
, edited by Louise P. Kellogg
of the Societyâs staff for the
Original Narratives of American History

series. In this volume have been gathered, with appropriate
editing, the principal classics of northwestern exploration in the
seventeenth century. Included are the narratives of (or concerning)
Nicolet, Radisson, Perrot, Allouez, Dollier and GalinÃ©e, Jolliet and
Marquette, La Salle, Duluth, and
St.
Cosme. Thus at length we have
assembled in convenient form the more important sources for the
earliest history of this region, so that anyone who will, may easily
avail himself of them. With this volume the important series of

Original Narratives of Early American History
, sponsored by the
American Historical Association and under the general editorship
of Dr. J. Franklin Jameson of Washington, concludes. It is interesting
to note that the series was begun and finished by Madison
scholars,
Prof.
Julius Olson having edited (jointly with Professor
Bourne) the first volume and Miss Kellogg the final one.

Mr. Lucius C. Colman of La Crosse has had reprinted by photomechanical
process from the copy in the Wisconsin Historical
Library the rare
Brief Sketch of La Crosse Wiscân
published in 1854
by
Rev.
Spencer Carr. The work, a pamphlet of twenty-eight pages,
may be regarded as a city history, directory, census, and promoting
tract all in one. From it we learn that in January, 1854, La Crosse
had a total population of 745. Indicative of the character of the
place at this time is the further information that, among this population
were 78 âsingle Gentlemenâ and but 38 âsingle Ladies.â In
view of the fact that less than three years earlier there were but five
families in La Crosse, the authorâs generally optimistic view of the
townâs advantages and future prospects seems fairly justified. A
further indication of the roseate future which the townsmen saw in
prospect is afforded by the enumeration among the 745 persons in
the community of 9 physicians and 12 lawyers.

Of Ulysses S. Grant, conqueror of the Confederacy, many biographies
have been written. The recently published biography by
Louis A. Coolidge is one of the best in the series, although it still
remains to write an entirely satisfactory account of Grantâs career.
Mr. Coolidgeâs biography devotes a relatively large amount of space
to Grantâs later civilian career (over three-fifths of the volume).
The author believes and seeks to show that Grant was a greater
statesman and more successful president than he is commonly believed
to have been.

The Historical Department of Iowa has issued
Downingâs Civil
War Diary
, edited by
Prof.
O. B. Clark of Des Moines.

Pg 115

Alexander G. Downing was a sergeant in the Eleventh Iowa Infantry.
He served from 1861 to 1865, a period during which he succeeded in
participating in nearly forty battles and skirmishes. Like the

Artillerymanâs Diary
of Jenkin Lloyd Jones, published by the Wisconsin
History Commission three years ago, Downingâs diary gives
a valuable first-hand picture of the war as seen from the standpoint
of the soldier in the ranks. Unlike the
Artillerymanâs Diary
, however,
Downingâs diary, as printed, does not reproduce the original
record. Instead, it is a composite made up by the editor from the
original diary plus a revised version written out by Mr. Downing
in old age, together with such alterations as the editor deemed
desirable. The editorâs work seems to have been done skillfully on
the whole, and author, editor, and historical department are to be
congratulated on the publication of the book. As with the
Artillerymanâs
Diary
, not much of commendation can be accorded the physical
makeup of the book. So worthy a record was deserving of a better
dress.

For several years the Lakeside Press of Chicago has published
an annual Christmas volume of a historical character for complimentary
distribution to patrons and friends. The volume published
in 1916 was a reprint of the autobiography of Black Hawk, the
famous Sauk chief, and was edited by M. M. Quaife of the State
Historical Society of Wisconsin. So great was the demand for the
book that although 3,500 copies were printed the edition was exhausted
within a brief period. For the year 1917 the Indian-captivity
narrative of
Rev.
O. M. Spencer is being edited by Mr.
Quaife. The work was originally written for the
Western Christian
Advocate
of Cincinnati, from whose files the numerous reprint editions
in volume form of seventy years ago were taken. For the new
edition under preparation, recourse has been had to the rare file of
the
Advocate
preserved in the newspaper division of the Wisconsin
Historical Library.

An elaborate report of
Perryâs Victory Centennial
has been issued
by the Perryâs Victory Centennial Commission, State of New York.
As usual with politico-historical publications of this character, the
physiognomies of the several members of the commission are adequately
presented to public gaze in a series of full-page half-tones. The
numerous historical addresses delivered in connection with the celebration
constitute the more interesting portion of the contents of
the volume. Included is the address of Hon. John M. Whitehead
of our Society at the laying of the cornerstone of the Perry Memorial
at Put-in-Bay, Ohio, July 4, 1913.

Pg 116

One of the most laborious, and at the same time useful, pieces of
historical workmanship of recent years is being prosecuted towards its
conclusion by Mr. Clarence Brigham, secretary of the American Antiquarian
Society of Worcester, Massachusetts. This is the compilation
of a calendar of all American newspapers published down to (and
including) the year 1820. Newspapers are as the breath of life to
the serious student of American history, but with no comprehensive
guide to enlighten him as to what papers were published and where
files of these have been preserved, the individual student has been
sadly handicapped heretofore in his efforts to avail himself of this
source of historical information. Aside from its value to students
of American history generally, there are at least two reasons why
the progress of Mr. Brighamâs enterprise should afford peculiar
interest to members of this Society; first, because our Society was
a pioneer in the field of publishing newspaper catalogues, the last
edition of our
Annotated Catalogue
got out by Doctor Thwaites a
few years ago still standing as one of the two chief American publications
of this character in print; and second, because of the creditable
showing made by our Societyâs collection of early American newspapers
in Mr. Brighamâs calendar; this notwithstanding the fact
that the major strength of our newspaper collection lies in a period
more recent than that covered by Mr. Brigham.

Publication of
The Louisiana Historical Quarterly
was begun by
the Louisiana Historical Society in January, 1917. The initial
number contains 119 pages of material, bearing chiefly upon the
history of the state. The Georgia Historical Society issued in March
the first number of the
Georgia Historical Quarterly
. These two
new publications afford gratifying evidence of renewed vigor on the
part of their sponsors, each of which is upwards of eighty years of
age.

To the October, 1916, number of the
Missouri Historical Review

Duane Mowry of Milwaukee contributes an interesting collection of
letters of Carl Schurz, B. Gratz Brown, and other prominent Missourians,
contained in the collection of papers of Senator James R.
Doolittle of Wisconsin, now in Mr. Mowryâs custody. The January,
1917, number of the
Review
contains a further instalment of Senator
Doolittleâs correspondence with leading citizens of Missouri.

The June number of the
Mississippi Valley Historical Review

contains as a leading article a valuable account of the Doukhobors
in Canada. Other articles worthy of note are Professor Robertsonâs
âSectionalism in Kentucky from 1855 to 1865,â and the annual
survey of historical activities in the Old Northwest for the preceding
year. Our Wisconsin readers will be gratified by the opening sentence

Pg 117

of the survey: âThe State Historical Society of Wisconsin continues
to maintain its leading position among historical agencies of
this region.â To those of our readers who are as yet unacquainted
with the
Review
we are glad to commend it as the livest and best
historical periodical in America, saving only the
American Historical
Review
. Because it belongs to our own section of the country its
contents are probably of greater interest and value to most middle-western
readers than are those even of the
American Historical
Review
. Membership in the association is open to all; members
receive the quarterly
Review
together with the annual volume of

Proceedings
of the association.

The leading articles in the July number of the
American Historical
Review
possess an unusual degree of timeliness.
Prof.
S. B.
Fay writes on âThe Beginnings of the Standing Army in Prussia.â
Two Civil War articles are âThe Northern Railroads, April, 1861,â
and âThe Confederate Government and the Railroads.â The former
of these is by
Prof.
Carl R. Fish of the University of Wisconsin.
Finally, James A. Robertson, who went from Wisconsin to the
librarianship of the Manila Public Library, gives an account of
âThe Philippines since the Inauguration of the Philippine Assembly.â
Included in the book reviews are full-page notices of the two recently
issued volumes of this Societyâs
Collections
,
No. XXII
and
No.
XXIII.

Of military history and principles most Americans are woefully
ignorant. Those who would improve their knowledge of these things
can hardly do better than to become readers of
The Military
Historian and Economist
edited jointly by
Capt.
Arthur L.
Conger, U. S. A., and
Prof.
R. M. Johnston of Harvard. Timely
and stimulating articles in the July number of the magazine are
Ãmile Laloyâs discussion of âFrench Military Theoryâ and an
anonymous contributorâs âEstimate of the Situation.â The writer
believes that the most effective military course for the United States
to take is to keep at home the larger part of the army now in process
of creation, and by so doing enable our navy to be sent into the
Pacific to establish there a secure Anglo-American predominance.
The considerations which lead to these conclusions cannot, of course,
be set forth in this brief note.

THE FRONTIER A WORLD PROBLEM
[82]

By Carl Russell Fish

Only by a study of local history can we hope really to
understand the development of human society. The historian
like the scientist must base his knowledge on what can
be seen through a microscope. Wisconsin, from the time of
its formation as a state, has realized this, and has steadily confirmed
itself in the opinion. This institution, which it founded
in the days of its youth and scant resources, it has supported
with a liberality, public and private, growing as its wealth has
grown. Of late years, a corps of local societies, city and
county, have been forming about the central institution.
The University has directed its students to the study of the
localities from which they have come, and stores in its stacks
the facts which they glean. No one of the newer states of the
country knows itself so well as Wisconsin, and if, as is so
often the case, acquired knowledge seems merely to reveal
the knowledge still necessary for real understanding, we have
carefully developed plans to extend it still more widely and
intensively.

Yet how insignificant any locality seems today, when practically
all are plunged into the same calamity, when the
resources of all are concentrated in one struggle. Races and
breeds, nationalities and castes are merged together on the
same battle-field. Their similarities of plight and object dominate
their differences, the protective barriers each erected to
preserve that distinctiveness so dear to human nature seem
leveled, and history has become world history. Men thrown
thus physically into the maelstrom find themselves intellectually
also torn from their safe anchorages and adrift they
know not where. What does the individual count for, what

Pg 122

the locality, what the past? What counts it to study the
development of Rock County cheese-making, when its cheeses
and cheese makers are tumbled promiscuously with those of
all counties and nations, simply as units in a staggering sum
total?

The world has changed, but that is not startling. The
world is always changing. This change is greater, and for
us in America more sudden and dramatic, than any which
preceded, but everything has not changed. The relation of
the past to the present and the future is permanent. The
relations of the individual, the locality, and the whole, shift,
but they are the permanent factors of which life consists.
The world war has not changed these factors, but it should
bring us up sharply to a realization of what they really mean.
Socratesâ dictum âknow thyselfâ was not given in any selfish
spirit. He did not mean that we were to devote ourselves
to ourselves, but that we could know ourselves more
thoroughly than we could know others, that self-knowledge
was the completest knowledge, and therefore the Archimedian
lever to open up knowledge of others. Self-examination
has often become an obsession excluding all else, the study
of local history has often become antiquarianism. The real
reason for the cultivating of both is the formation of known
bases from which to calculate. The German historian, Lamprecht,
became so familiar with the little city of TrÃªves that he
could have conversed intimately with its inhabitants of any
year during the Middle Ages if he might have been dropped
into it, but this devotion was not for the sake of TrÃªves, it
gave the understanding knowledge necessary for his great
work on German civilization as a whole. We can know no
generation unless we have delved deep into the souls of its
greatest men, but such biographical studies are not for themselves
alone, but to contribute to a sympathetic comprehension
of their contemporaries.

Pg 123

Local history to justify itself must be as exact and absolute
as studies dealing with human nature may be, but if no
effort is made to utilize it for an understanding of national
and world history, it has missed its mission. Local history is
not an end in itself. Moreover, if it is written without a wide
knowledge of outside conditions, conditions in other localities,
and other times, it will be but a warped product, as useless
to the community for which it is written as for the outside
world. Such selfishness and egoism have never been profitable.
The only difference today is that for the moment at least
they have become impossible.

The most striking feature in the history of Wisconsin has
been the transformation within a lifetime of a virgin forest
into a civilized area, the drawing together of the sons and
daughters of many widely differing localities and their welding
into a commonwealth. This conquest of the frontier has
been but a portion of that vast movement which in a period
historically short has created the United States, and more
particularly it has been an important and typical battle in
the campaign for the Mississippi Valley, which has resulted
in our sister states of the Middle West.

Different as has been the history of each, the history of the
frontier movement is a whole; the study of any state contributes
to an understanding of all. As the occupation of
Wisconsin has been but a part of the American frontier movement,
so that has not been unique, even in the nineteenth
century. We have liked to think of ourselves as carrying on
a special and distinct task; to its difficulties and inspiration
we have attributed many of our virtues, and on them we have
laid the burden of our defects. The task, however, has not
been unique. The results have, indeed, had their distinctive
differences, but these have come rather from the way the
task has been performed than because we have had a different
thing to do. We know our own frontier with scientific
thoroughness, but we cannot understand it unless we contrast

Pg 124

it with such other frontiers as Australia, Siberia, South
America, and Africa.

One of the essential features of a frontier is that both labor
and capital come from without, and much of the capital is
contributed by people who do not come to the frontier.
Exception must, indeed, be made to this statement. The
Spaniards found labor in Peru and Mexico, and they found
also capital, as did the miners of Australia and California,
the lumber barons of Wisconsin, and the fur traders of
Canada. In none of these instances, however, did either the
local labor or local capital suffice, and in all the instances to
be cited later the bulk of the labor came from away, and the
owners of an important portion of the capital remained away;
the frontier community, therefore, was a debtor community,
and the debt was due to an outside community.

This common condition has in all cases had an important
bearing not only on economic development, but on the whole
texture of the social fabric which was created; it affected
not only the frontier itself, but its reflex influence on the
sections from which the labor and capital were drawn set at
work influences which at times became leading factors in their
existence. So important have their influences been, that where
the study is confined to any one frontier, they seem to dominate
development, and make history their creature. When
we extend our study, however, we find that in spite of the
fundamental resemblance, each has followed its separate
course; that the different balance of other factors, and even
such secondary considerations as laws and constitutions, have
radically altered the actual operation of these powerful
natural resemblances. The control of the frontierâs natural
resources, the distribution of proceeds, the very content of
politics have varied with every frontier. The problem has
been one, the methods and results have been as varied as the
fields in which it occurred.

Pg 125

In the United States the larger part of the capital came
from or through another section of the same country. That
is, the East furnished nearly all that was supplied, although
to do so it had to borrow somewhat from Europe. The direct
loans from Europe to the West were comparatively unimportant.
Consequently the interests of the debtor and creditor
sections conflicted in the arena of national politics. Two
unique features made the working out of the problem different
in this country from any other. The first was the division
of the country into a large number of states, sovereign
within a restricted range of powers, some controlled by the
debtor element, some by the creditor. The other was that at
one time, and that the most critical, the frontier was strong
enough at least to veto the action of the national government.

The result of these conditions was a struggle unusually
complex. The control of banking, of the currency, of natural
resources, such as lands, minerals, and oil, and of transportation
or, as it is phrased in our politics, internal improvements,
were the bone of contention. The desire to have these controlled
by national or state governments varied with the political
situation. The frontier wished banks that would not be
too particular, a currency that would be easy to get; it wished,
and wishes, control of its own systems of transportation and
its natural resources.

The sections furnishing the supplies were more interested
in the capital to which strings were tied, than in the labor
which cut its apron strings on leaving home. The struggle
antedated the Revolution; the high points in its later history
were the Shays Rebellion, the Jackson rÃ©gime, the greenback
movement, the Bryan campaign, and it finds present expression
in the opposition in the Far West to the national conservation
policy.

When the frontier secured the reins of power in the sinewy
hands of Andrew Jackson, it was not in a position to impose
its policy upon the nation, but it was powerful enough to wrest

Pg 126

banking, the currency, and internal improvements from the
control of the national government, and turn them over to the
states. The frontier states, elate, started on a mad career of
making their own internal improvements, by means of borrowed
capital diluted by paper issues, till money ran like fairy
gold into the pockets of the needy. For one golden moment
the problem of the frontier seemed solved to the satisfaction
of the frontier. Jackson himself caused the first crash.
Unable to tell good paper from bad, he could at any rate tell
paper from gold, and in the Specie Circular of 1836 he
brought credit to the touchstone of real value and sent the
house of cards toppling. Feverishly rebuilt within the next
few years, it fell again in 1841, carrying with it the whole
dream of its builders. So severe was the blow that numbers
of the states took advantage of their sovereign rights, and
repudiated a portion of their debts. Securely entrenched
behind their sovereign inviolability to legal attack, they still
enjoyed the inviolability to force which their position as part
of a larger nation afforded. They snapped their fingers at
their creditors; but they could borrow no more. The nation
had left the task of national development to the states; the
states, by impairing their credit, had rendered themselves
incapable of handling it.

This situation left the field free for, in fact rendered
necessary, the intervention of individuals or of individuals
organized as corporations. The legal position of the latter
had already been prepared. The decisions of Justice Marshall
had given corporation charters an unusual degree of
legal sanctity, which the state constitutions modified rather
than reversed. The fears of the Jeffersonian democracy had
incorporated into the national constitution itself special
restrictions upon the government in dealing with the individual,
which the decisions of the Supreme Court under
Justice Taney went far in applying to the corporations.
Corporations became so firmly entrenched in their position

Pg 127

as the chief agency in national development, that even when,
after the Civil War, the national government became more
active and once more assumed control of banking and the
currency, and the credit of the states was reÃ«stablished, both
agencies used their powers chiefly to assist corporations.
When, in the present generation, the necessity of public control
became obvious, it took the form, for the most part, of
regulation of corporations, rather than that of absorbing or
supplanting them.

The direction of the development of transportation and
the exploitation of natural resources, therefore, was, for the
most part, in the hands of individuals, and, in the case of large
projects, of individuals organized as corporations, and, with
the exception of farm land, of individuals and corporations
representing nonresident capital. Many influences, of
course, modified their activities, but these affected rather the
security of their capital than the initiative of their plans.
Many lost the capital which they poured into the new region,
and the result was that the prospect of large returns was
demanded by others before venturing; speculation, lost investments,
and abnormally productive investments characterized
the process as a whole. Politicians concerned themselves
rather with the means, the questions of banking and currency,
than with the end, the character of the development which
should take place.

The other independent portions of the American continents,
for the most part, resembled the United States in
organization, but the distribution of the economic factors differed
and produced different results. Except in the United
States, the capital which has been necessary for the occupation
of the wilderness has come, for the most part, not from other
portions of the same country, but from foreign countries.

The most important of these frontiers during the nineteenth
century has been that of Argentina. Here the established
section was until recently comparatively unimportant,

Pg 128

both labor and capital came in large measure from abroad; the
greater portion of the labor from Italy, of the capital from
Great Britain. The conflict between the debtor and creditor
sections, therefore, was not one of politics, but of diplomacy.
Argentina might have what system of banking and currency
it wished, but most creditors had to be paid in an international
standard of value. In a world state, doubtless, all the
frontiers would unite to further their interests, as the frontier
states have in the United States; in the world as at present
unorganized the ultimate appeal is to force. A debtor country,
and one relatively weak as compared with its creditor,
Argentina has not been without its plans, conceived like those
of the American frontiersman without moral dishonesty
but with incapacity or unwillingness to think the thing
through, for easing its burden. In the efforts of Calvo and
Drago to incorporate into international law the principle that
debts between nations and their citizens may not be collected
by force, we see as surely the reflection of frontier views,
as in the programs of Greenbacker and of Populist. In the
greater interest in international affairs in Argentina than in
the United States, we see a new illustration of the aphorism
âFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.â

In the long run, Argentina has had to pay up, and has had
to pay also in high interest rates, for the lack of a feeling of
absolute security on the part of the investor. Probably few
countries have had more expensive statesmen than Drago and
Calvo.

To attract capital, moreover, it has been necessary to
offer it abundantly the undeveloped natural resources of the
country. On the other hand, the logic of the situation has
kept development in the hands of the nation to a greater
degree than in the United States, for the nation has been able
to borrow money more cheaply than individuals or domestic
corporations, and public ownership has played an important
part in her upbuilding.

Pg 129

Argentina has paid, and so we have a situation which has
never culminated in a crisis. The republics of the Caribbean
have not been so fortunate. Much of the money has been
borrowed, not for the purposes of improvement, but to finance
revolution and for personal expenditure. Frittered away
instead of put at productive work, it has become an increasing
burden, in many cases an unbearable burden, and countries
like Hayti, San Domingo, Honduras, and at times
Mexico, have become internationally bankrupt. Protected
against legal action by their sovereignty, the creditor and the
debtor stood in a situation where force alone could determine
their relationship. What the result would normally have
been, is clearly enough indicated by the intervention of France
in Mexico in 1861, and of Germany in Venezuela in 1902.
The subjugation of the weak debtor by the strong creditor
has been prevented not by sovereignty, but by the interposition
of a third force, the United States inspired by the Monroe
Doctrine.

While, however, the Monroe Doctrine served to maintain
the appearance of independence for the nations concerned,
it produced an
impasse
in the development of the frontier.
Capital did not have to go to countries which could not be
relied upon to pay up and which were protected from foreclosure
by an outside force. The United States served the
republics in somewhat the same manner that it did its own
repudiating states. It was, however, unable to do as much
for them as it did for its own. The wayward republics found
themselves debarred from directing their own development
as did our states in the critical forties, and there was no
domestic capital to undertake the task. The capital willing
to engage in work under such circumstances was that of the
most speculative sort. Some gamblers staked their money
on presidential contenders, seeking to gain control of the
government. Others, more powerful and trusting in their
power, offered to embark huge sums on condition of receiving

Pg 130

stupendous grants of the natural resources and practical
control of the whole development to be made in certain
regions. Such was the much-discussed Morgan syndicate
proposal to Honduras, and that of the English Pearson
syndicate to Columbia. In the latter instance, the United
States again intervened, fearing the influence of such aggregations
of foreign capital, and expressed its opinion that
such special concessions violated the spirit of the Monroe
Doctrine and could not be allowed.

From the tightening deadlock thus produced, Diaz extricated
Mexico for a time, but it lapsed, and the others
showed no signs of the power to emerge. Such European
capital as had been loaned felt not unjustly angry, such as
was for hire sought other avenues and frontiers less peculiarly
hedged in. The situation shouted for action, and action could
come only from the United States, which would not permit
simple logic to work its own conclusion. It was under such
circumstances that President Roosevelt assumed the financial
administration of San Domingo and inaugurated a policy
which has been followed and extended by his successors. Justice,
or approximate justice, has been done between debtor
and creditor, but the active development of these frontiers is
still halted for lack of a machinery for the future.

In striking contrast with these American frontiers has
been that of Siberia. Here has taken place one of the greatest
frontier advances of history, here the same localization of
creditor and debtor has existed, yet the conflict of classes and
sections has led neither to politics as in the United States,
nor to diplomacy as in Latin America. Much of the capital
has been provided by France, but the money has, for the most
part, been borrowed by the national Russian government,
representing a strong nation and an essential ally. The
security of the creditor has rested in the good faith, not of
the frontier but of an established society, which has wished

Pg 131

constantly more and more money and has realized that an
atmosphere of credit must be preserved.

As the frontier has had nothing to say concerning its
credit relationships, so it has been equally powerless in controlling
the expenditures of the money borrowed and the
disposition of its natural resources. The sole check upon the
absolute will of the central government has been the desire
to attract labor to the frontier. Few laborers, as few capitalists,
seek the wild for the mere adventure of subduing it. The
bids and rival bids for settlers by those controlling various
sections of the world-frontier for the last three centuries have
been to a large extent the basis for those more liberal institutions
which have developed on the fringe of society. Their
bids have been determined by the character of the settlers
they desired or found available, and have in considerable
measure determined the character of the communities built
up. Force has played its part as well as lure, and has given
incurious Africa a share in the development of the Americas
that the most psychological advertiser would never have
secured for it. In the nineteenth century, Russia has had
more command of force to populate her waste spaces than
any other country. Consequently the actual frontiersmen
have had less to say about the development of their own region
than elsewhere. Yet it is easily possible to exaggerate the
coercive power of the central government, in popular estimation
it is probably exaggerated; and the plans for the settlement
of Siberia have been to no small degree influenced by
consideration for the ideals of the typical Russian and the
incentives which would coerce him to move his hearthstone.
Yet on the whole, simplicity and the carrying out of preconceived
plans have worked the opening of this great frontier.
That the great release which has just occurred in
Russia will reveal where these plans have bound, and that the
politics of the new republic will be colored by frontier problems,
is inevitable.

Pg 132

Australia and New Zealand have, to an even greater extent
than the American frontier, secured their labor and capital
from another section of the same empire. The relations
between the sections, however, are quite different. The local
organization of the debtor communities resembles that of the
American states; in fact, the scope of their power is much
broader, but they do not possess that inviolability to legal
attack which sovereignty gives, and have not been represented
in the central government. Credit, therefore, has been a
matter of neither politics nor diplomacy, but has been as
firmly controlled by the lending section, England, as that of
Siberia has been by Russia. Judicial unity, which has been
the only organic bond of empire, makes the sovereign, like
the Crown, identical in Brisbane and in London. There is
no chance of reducing debts save by a separation, which other
considerations have rendered furthest from the wishes of the
debtors.

General diplomacy also has been largely excluded from
local consideration. The creditor-debtor relationship was
almost exclusively one within the empire, and the handling of
other diplomatic questions was in the hands of the British
government in which the frontier sections were represented
only by influence. The attempts to arouse an imperial, not to
say international, mind found hard sledging during the real
development period, and only partially succeeded just before
the Great War.

On the other hand, the locality has been absolute master
of the expenditure of its borrowings. No subordinate communities
in the world, most decidedly not the states of our
Union, have been left so entirely free to control their development,
not only to plan their transportation and allot their
natural resources, but even to regulate their tariffs. It is not
surprising that these governments, with credit carefully maintained
by outside and unquestionable forces, found their
politics in the working out of such development, and that,

Pg 133

in large measure, borrowing has been done by the local
governments, which have themselves spent the money borrowed.
There can be no better security than that of a government
incapacitated from repudiation. Creditors have lost
comparatively little money to these frontiers, and so Australia
and New Zealand have received their needed capital upon
better terms, perhaps, than any of the other regions treated.
How wisely they have spent it, is a matter of the most violent
dispute.

Politics in communities barred from the great questions
of credit and diplomacy yet organized on the basis of the
broadest democracy and local autonomy, have naturally had
their strikingly significant characteristics. Everyone knows
how rich their statute books have been in laws relating to the
distribution of natural resources and of all kinds of wealth,
and to conditions of living. Everyone knows the sharp
antagonism between labor, in the narrower sense of wage
earner, and employers. That these frontiers have been experiment
grounds in social legislation has not been due to their
being frontier communities but because they have been frontier
communities freed from some of the most characteristic
frontier problems.

Rhodesia resembles Australia and New Zealand in local
autonomy and lack of representation in the national government.
In other respects, however, it is widely different.
Here capital came first, and labor afterward. The capital,
moreover, was not of the timid sort seeking small return and
security, such as invested in the securities of New Zealand,
Victoria, and New South Wales, nor did it entirely resemble
that of the United States during the development period,
which sought returns both large and immediate. The capitalists
of Rhodesia could wait, in fact, are still waiting.
Alone among the frontiers, Rhodesia has not been under
the strain of seeking to make returns on its invested capital
before development has reached the stage where returns can

Pg 134

properly be expected. It may well hope to be freed from
those complications of individual indebtedness, which have
filled our courts with business, and strewn our advance with
such tragedies as are even today occurring in northern Wisconsin.

Upon the capitalists thus far-sighted and enduring
rested the full burden of development. The region was
autonomous in its relation to the British Empire, but its non-resident
creditors mapped out its future, not its settlers as in
Australia. Capital under such circumstances looks for large
rewards, and in this case expects to secure them by control of
the natural resources, when these have been made available by
the incoming of settlers. Youngest of the frontiers, the working
of the old factors in this new relationship remains a question.
One would expect economy and efficiency in planning,
but possible conflicts between the resident community and its
creditors over the division of the proceeds. The settlers that
it seeks are of the most independent type, men not with energy
alone, but with some small capital of their own. It offers
them not only economic opportunity but also political privileges.
How such a population will react under a system which
restricts politics one degree more than they are restricted in
Australia, by excluding the larger lines of local development
such as transportation, is one of the interesting questions of
tomorrow. One might look for some clue in the history of
the American colonial proprietorships, but how far the intelligent
study of those experiments will have enabled the proprietors
of Rhodesia to avoid their mistakes, and how far the
changed conditions created by two centuries of the most rapid
change the world has seen, will modify the interworking of
similar forces, no one can tell.

In organization, Canada is today, of course, like Australia,
but whereas the commonwealth of Australia is but
recent and was formed only after the scaffolding of development
had been created, the Dominion of Canada was created

Pg 135

in season to direct the most active period of frontiering.
During the most significant period, therefore, Canada has
had an organization that resembled our federal states. The
resemblance, however, is partly superficial; in Canada the
specified powers belong to the provinces, the undefined
powers to the Dominion. Neither provinces nor Dominion,
moreover, have possessed the legal inviolability of absolute
sovereignty. The credit of all has been protected by the judicial
unity of the empire, and the stability of the currency has
not been a subject for politics. Diplomacy, also, has belonged
to the mother country, although the proximity of the United
States has not allowed it to be the blank it was so long in its
Australian sister-colonies.

Economically the development of the Canadian frontier
has more resembled that of the United States, for the capital
required has come most largely from or through other sections
of the same colony. As compared with the United
States, however, development has been, until quite lately, slow.
Consequently those regions which have passed beyond the
frontier stage have continuously controlled the central government.
There has been no parallel to the Jackson rÃ©gime.
Credit, therefore, has been doubly guarded, by the majority
in Canada, and by Canadaâs position within the British
Empire. With the credit of the Dominion and of the provinces
intact, there have been no intrinsic obstacles to the development
of transportation and the control of resources by the
public, and public works have played an important part. At
the same time the period of greatest need coincided with the
high tide of the individualistic movement in the Anglo-Saxon
world. The principles of John Stuart Mill, of Cobbett and
Bright, of Gladstone, Carlyle, and Emerson, dominated a
generation devoted to the task of breaking down time-worn
systems of social control and releasing the individual. The
period of new regulations dictated by rising democracy had
not swung in. Therefore, a very considerable portion of the

Pg 136

task was left to private corporations, to whom were granted
very considerable proportions of the natural resources. Corporation
control and public enterprise, therefore, combined
with unusual harmony in developing and exploiting a
frontier which was, indeed, represented, but which could control
in neither a positive nor a negative sense.

The recent and sudden expansion of the Canadian frontier
in the west and northwest has created a new balance. The
situation in Canada today resembles that in the United States
when the advance of population from the Alleghanies to
beyond the Mississippi gave the frontier an unusual political
weight, and elected Andrew Jackson. This region is just
now in the position where it is so eager to get capital that it is
ready to agree to almost any terms to secure its railroads and
farm machinery. When pay time comes, its sentiments will
change. It is difficult to see how it can upset credit, but that,
in combination with the democracy of the older portions of
Canada, it will make its voice felt and play a part in Canadian
politics that the frontier has never played in the long course
of Canadian history, no student of frontiers can doubt.

On the whole, Canada has secured its capital at low interest
rates, lower probably than any other frontier except
Australia and New Zealand. It has, however, sacrificed the
control of its natural resources to a considerable degree. The
direction of its development has attracted both public attention
and the labor of its strongest men controlling private
capital. In none of the frontiers have the two systems been
so equally blended.

Most hapless of the frontiers is that of Manchuria. It is
at present a represented province of an imperial republic,
which furnishes most of the labor required, but can furnish
neither capital nor protection. Its capital comes, for the most
part, from two rival foreign powers, who are not really creditor
nations, but who are so eager to invest in Manchuria that
they borrow from still other countries for the purpose. The

Pg 137

local community has no more to say in regard to its development
or the partition of its resources than Siberia. It does
not, indeed, rest under any such obligation of paying as does
Australia, for power rather than money return is sought by
Russia and Japan, who furnish it with money on their own
security and, therefore, at reasonably low rates. Undoubtedly,
however, the successful grasp of power will mean such a
hold on natural resources as will give those countries, in return
for their guarantee, rewards which will be more satisfactory
to them than to the actual conquerors of the Manchurian
wilds. It will be interesting to see whether sectional interests
will unite the Russian and Japanese settlers with the Chinese
majority against the foreign capitalists, or whether racial
antagonism will prove stronger than economic. Countless
cross currents already chop the surface, and conditions point
rather to a problem than a state.

Wide as is the field covered by the frontiers discussed, the
Mississippi Valley, Argentina, the wilds encircling the Caribbean,
Siberia, Australia, Canada, and Manchuria, it covers
barely half the area where since the year 1800 European
civilization has been struggling to establish itself by the occupation
of regions wholly or partly vacant. Different as have
been the conditions classified under which the simple underlying
factors universally involved have operated, more have
been left undescribed. Algiers has had a frontier incorporated
as an integral part of France, a centralized republic.
In fact, practically every region of Africa has presented a
frontier, and the handling of frontier conditions by English,
French, and Belgians, Boers, Germans, Portuguese, Italians,
Spaniards, and American negroes. The greatest frontier
area today is Brazil, and every country of Latin America has
a frontier and its own slightly varying organization and
balance of forces, while the British, French, and Dutch are
all severally trying their hand on the particular problem of
a tropical American frontier. Some portions of India, Persia,

Pg 138

Arabia, Indo-China, China, Korea, the Philippines, Formosa,
and many South Sea Islands, present the problem
under special guises. Sweden, Norway, Russia, Canada, and
the United States are all dealing with the possibility of pressing
civilization into the fastnesses of the Arctic.

When one considers the extent of the world frontier in
process of occupation during the last century, the persuasive
effect of its call upon the older world for labor and capital,
the coloring of the whole world by the natural resources it
has unearthed and the institutions it has developed, its conquest
can hardly be considered as second in influence to any
factor of the time. Naturally it is not intended to present
here even a basis for its study. The fundamental factors
and the different systems can be accurately enough described
in general terms, but the differences in their operation are less
precise than has been indicated; private corporations exist
in Siberia, state public improvements in the United States.
Many of the similarities produced everywhere by frontier
conditions have been neglected. The attempt has been merely
to indicate some of the tendencies fostered by different types
of control. The differences between the various frontiers,
resulting from race and geography, which in many cases
explain the different types of organization or modify their
working, have been left untouched. The problem is immense,
its study is one for generations. Yet some things he who
runs may read. Even a partial acquaintance with the main
features of all cannot but render the work of each statesman
and historian more effective in his own particular task.

Some things will be understood only when no frontier, as
we know it, exists. Yet even while we are in the current, we
have accumulated some material, and it would seem to be contributory
negligence not to use it. It must be patent that
one must be honest or must pay for it. Can we not secure
some rough idea of which system of approach has resulted
in the greater justice between the creditor and debtor section,

Pg 139

and what is justice? Has community control of its development
or creditor control been most economical and most effective?
Has exploitation to produce local capital any justification?
What system has called to the task the greater
proportion of ability? Would the United States have fared
better under a system by which Webster, Clay, and Calhoun
would have devoted to moulding the transportation system
the genius they spent in bolstering up public credit? Which
system has been the most responsive to the needs of the situation,
and which has stimulated the greatest amount of public
virtue, and which has been most easily manipulated for selfish
advantage?

I havenât the slightest intention of answering these questions
here; I freely admit that many of them leave me perplexed,
but I dogmatically maintain that it is by pondering
such questions, by studying the comparisons they suggest,
that the frontier problem is to be understood by the historian
and comprehended by the statesman. Without such comparisons
the student of the problem in any one field is less
apt to judge a particular episode rightly than a man with no
knowledge and good intentions. The path to wisdom and
sure-footed action must be founded on the rock of exact
knowledge, but it must be platted on a wide-spread survey.

All life reveals the irony of wisdom attained only by the
experience to deal with which it was needed. It is but today
we have this rich storehouse of experimental frontier building,
and tomorrow we will have no frontier. It might seem
that we could let a dead past bury its dead, that the study of
frontier episodes, however successful, has become sheer antiquarianism.
Such a view, however, minimizes the world
frontier that remains and the time and effort that will be
required in its conquest. As in science, so with the material
world, the nineteenth century made easy sweeping advances;
it left much that was difficult for the slower and more
laborious labors of the twentieth. It overlooks the facts that
great masses of the worldâs inhabitants today count the experience

Pg 140

of meeting the wild first-hand among the most important
of their nearby inheritances, that the frontier set its mark
upon them or their parents, or grandparents, and that the
present generation cannot be understood unless the frontier
is understood. Still more important is the consideration
that in many instances the frontier merely localizes problems
that are general. The factors with which this paper has dealt
are peculiar to the frontier only in that the creditors are
assembled in one section, the debtors in another. This is an
important peculiarity in large part because it isolates the
characteristics of each, and makes them easier of study. When
the world has been fully occupied, new frontiers will appear,
are already appearing. Natural resources now undreamed
of will need capital and labor for their exploitation, will be
susceptible of development in more than one way, and will
raise problems of control. Our experiences with the rude and
simple problem of the first occupation of a waste area will
seem as geometry to calculus compared with those raised by
these new frontiers, but will be as essential to a wise handling
of them as geometry is to calculus.

But the instances that we have reviewed seem to carry a
simpler and more immediate moral. When we see in the
United States people of all nations laboring for the conquest
of the Mississippi Valley, and employing money saved by
New England and the Middle States or borrowed by them
from Europe, when we see Russia borrowing French money
to make Siberia habitable for Russian peasants, when Japan
borrows in England, and Russia in France to pay Chinese to
develop transportation in Manchuria, when Argentina borrows
English money to employ Italians in the pampas, and
Transvaal gold passes through English banks to build
Rhodesian railways, we get glimpses of a new world. Not
that these things are absolutely novel, but that in variety and
extent they are unparalleled, and these experiences on the
frontiers but bring into clearer view general tendencies of
the time. The German invasion of Belgium uncovered for

Pg 141

most of us the tens of thousands of Russians working in the
Liege factories, the hundreds of thousands of Russians working
on German farms, of Italians on the Rhine, of Spaniards
in France; the war itself has hastened the movement with its
vast importations of Indo-Chinese and Arabs into France,
with its tight-woven mesh of international credit. The
frontier still reveals most clearly how in the nineteenth
century the business of life became international and how
poorly devised was the world organization for coping with it.

Again, the experience of the frontier in the nineteenth
century exhibits one step in the process of readjustment. Can
one review the instances which have been noted, without feeling
the theory of absolute sovereignty crumbling beneath his
feet? The United States has in practice divided the sovereignty,
and as a result surrendered the actual control to corporations
they themselves created. The British Empire
preserved unity in theory, but actually divided it still more
effectually. What can a practical man make of the sovereignty
of Honduras, where the native government cannot
control its own development, the British Empire cannot
protect its citizensâ money, and the United States can veto the
actions of both but cannot take positive action; or of Manchuria,
which is an integral portion of a sovereign republic,
but which is actually as to one-half controlled by Russia and
the other by Japan, both of whom are somewhat curtailed in
their actions by promises to the United States. However
one may cling to the legal theory of the absolute and indivisible
character of sovereignty in independent localities, a study of
the world frontier brings out the fact that no localities are
independent in fact, or absolutely sovereign. The inter-growth
of the world, which the development of the world
frontier has so much facilitated, has already weakened the
bulwarks of local independence; let us hope that with its international
character the frontier may facilitate the integration
of a world organization better adapted to the conditions of
today, such an organization as tomorrow will be a necessity.

EARLY RECOLLECTIONS OF LAKE GENEVA
(BIG FOOT LAKE), WISCONSIN

By George Manierre
[83]

My grandfather, William Reid, came to Chicago in 1840.
At that time, although a mere village of 4,479 inhabitants, it
was in the midst of a speculative fever and was even then
speaking of its certain future greatness and of Lake Geneva
(Big Foot Lake) as a probable summer resort for its citizens.
My grandfather came of a well-known family whose ancestor
with his tenants fought at the battle of Bothwell Bridge,
June 22, 1679, under the flag âFor God, King, and Covenant,â
and who inherited through him the estate of Kilbryd,
situated near Glasgow, Scotland. William Reid inherited
wealth which he, as a barrister, increased, so that at about
middle life he made up his mind to retire. Unfortunately
for his family his investments proved unsuccessful, and after
the loss of the greater part of his fortune he came to America
and started anew. When he came to Chicago he had a
relatively large sum of money, which, if invested in Chicago,
might eventually have increased to great wealth; but he was
stricken by the Lake Geneva fever and went there with his
family, locating at the head of the lake. He invested largely
in land by the lake and on Big Foot Prairie, buying a large
tract of land on the higher ground and about seventy acres
along the lake.

HOUSE OF WILLIAM REID AT THE HEAD OF LAKE GENEVA

From a water color in the Wisconsin Historical Library painted in 1842 by Mrs. James Drew

My grandmother, Mary Drew, came of a cultivated
family which was distantly related to the family of the Duke
of Hamilton. Her niece was the first wife of William Gladstone,
the English statesman. Mention is made of these
things to show the change from the ease of their former mode

Pg 143

of living to the vicissitudes which locating on the frontier
entailed.

My grandparents had nine children, five boys and four
girls, part of whom were born in the log house at the head of
the lake. This house stood about two hundred feet from
shore at the bottom of a rise of ground known as the Potawatomi
Indian burial ground, upon which site the electric
railway depot now stands. I remember as a boy digging
Indian relics out of this hill. The house was neatly built of
logs and had two large wings; in the center of one room was
a fireplace suitable for burning large logs. Among the early
settlers in the neighborhood at this time who had land and
houses at the head of the lake were the Van Slykes,
[84]
the
Mohrs,
[85]
the Russells,
[86]
and the Douglasses.
[87]

Here the children grew up with the ordinary opportunities
of farmersâ children and had no better advantages; and years
later my cousin, Jessie (Reid) Donaldson, my brother, Will,
and I used to come here to enjoy the beautiful surroundings
of grandfatherâs place. Will and I had a little pony called
Jenny and a wagon which we used to drive to The Corners
for mail. Whenever Jenny wanted to go into the barn or
whenever we took her to the blacksmithâs to be shod, she had a
funny trick of rapping on the door with her feet.

I remember the Baptist people used frequently to come
down to the lake in front of my grandfatherâs house, and that

Pg 144

the minister would there duck the women under the water,
according to their custom. My aunt, with great sympathy,
would lead the women into the house, where they could change
their clothes.

South of the house, where a stream ran through the inlet
into the lake, was a marsh, in the center of which was an island.
Here in those early days deer were often to be seen. Prairie
chickens were plentiful on Big Foot Prairie, and in the spring
wild pigeons, now extinct, flew over it in countless numbers.
Woodcock, ruffed grouse, and squirrels were also numerous.
In the lake there was a large quantity of game fish, among
which were the cisco. These were seen only during the last
days of May or the early days of June when they came from
the depths of the lake to the shallow water to feed on the May
flies and to spawn. Of the wild life existing at that time, only
a fraction now remains.

Matthias Mohr owned the old sawmill on the rising
ground at the south end of the marsh. The race was fed by
a large brook that emptied into the marsh. This beautiful
spot, surrounded by bushes and trees, was often visited by me.
The old wheel was still, but it was pleasant to listen to the
sound of the clear, cold water of the brook as it rushed over
the dismantled wheel to its outlet in the marsh. This brook
was afterward dammed up and used for raising brook trout.

Numerous beautiful springs were to be found running
from the higher ground to the lake. About half a mile north
of the house was a small schoolhouse where I remember being
spelled down by a little girl. The house was afterward occupied
by an English laborer by the name of Blackwell, and I
have his son Bill in pleasant remembrance. The road past
the schoolhouse at the foot of a high bluff ran south by
Douglassâ Mill and north to the farm belonging to my
grandfather. From Douglassâ Mill,
[88]
which was built by C. L.

Pg 145

Douglass and first used as a sawmill and then as a gristmill,
we used to go on up a very steep hill to the road going
west to The Corners, about three miles from my grandfatherâs
house, where at that early day the mail was obtained.
The village located where the mill once stood has since been
called Fontana.
[89]

Later we went to Walworth for the mail, taking the road
running south. The town of Walworth was founded in 1836
by James Van Slyke who made his residence at the head of
the lake. The only residents there about 1840 were Christopher
Douglass and sons, Marcus Russell, James Van Slyke,
Matthias Mohr, and William Reid. Matthias Mohr purchased
50 acres in the town of Walworth in 1840, and in 1843
he purchased 38 acres more. In 1840 William Reid purchased
960Â¼ acres, in 1840 Marcus Russell purchased 80
acres, and in 1841, Christopher Douglass purchased 480 acres,
all in the town of Walworth.

The village of Walworth had a store, a blacksmith shop,
the Red Lion Hotel, and the Brick Church. In the Brick
Church cemetery are buried today the remains of my grandfather
and my grandmother and a number of their children.
The Red Lion Hotel was used by many people passing on the
main road from town to town in Wisconsin.

A short distance to the north of grandfatherâs house was
the sugar bush. This was at the bottom of the high hills going
north up to Russellâs. Near the place stood the old Potawatomi
village and cornfields which Mrs. Kinzie in her book

Wau Bun
speaks of visiting in 1831.
[90]
I well remember seeing

Pg 146

the Indian trail back of the house leading up to the higher
land in the sugar bush.

The country at the head of the lake was filled with large
butternut, walnut, hickory, basswood, ash, sugar maple, white-,
black-, and burr-oak trees. The sugar bush, through which a
clear, cold brook ran murmuring to its outlet in the lake, was
notable for its many butternut trees and was one of the most
beautiful spots that could be seen anywhere about the lake.
I remember well the large oak tree near my grandfatherâs
house in which a canoe had been placed holding the remains
of a relative
[91]
of Big Foot,
[92]
an Indian chief after whom Big
Foot Prairie was named. The wood of the softer trees near
the farm was used by the Reid family for the rails from
which snake fences were made. I remember my father and
driver taking stakes from a snake fence and putting them in
the mud for my mother to stand on.

In the early days my father and mother in going to
Lake Geneva had to go by wagon. When the railroads were
built, they took a train to Turner Junction (now West Chicago)
located thirty miles west of Chicago, and from there
took a wagon to Lake Geneva. Later they went by the same
railroad (the Northwestern) to Harvard Junction and from
there by wagon to the head of the lake.

At Harvard was located a hotel owned by Elbridge G.
Ayer,
[93]
the father of Edward E. Ayer of this city. This hotel

Pg 147

was a few feet from the track and its dining-room furnished
meals to the people traveling on that road. This dining-room
was known all over the West, for at that time there was no
other that could compete with it. All the vegetables, meat,
poultry, and pastry were cooked in the most appetizing
manner and the products furnished for the table came fresh
from Mr. Ayerâs farm. My father and mother, my brother
Will, and I have often taken meals at this hotel on our way
from the Junction to the lake. The village of Harvard was
afterward beautified by Mr. Ayerâs son, Edward E. Ayer,
who planted fourteen hundred trees about it. Most of these
are standing today and are an evidence of the public spirit
of the donor, which is seen in Chicago in his activities in
behalf of the Newberry Library, Field Museum, and other
institutions.
[94]

My grandmotherâs brother, James Drew, a wealthy barrister
from London, England, and his wife visited his sister at
the head of the lake in 1842. At this time Mrs. Drew made
a small water-color drawing of the house and its vicinity which
has recently been placed in the Wisconsin Historical Library.

My recollections of Geneva go back to the early fifties.
I can remember going with my uncle in a rowboat from the
head to the foot of the lake, some eight miles. At that time
there were no steamboats on the lake and an unbroken forest
covered its shores. The high ground bordering the lake was

Pg 148

about 175 feet above the beach line. The depth of the lake
has since been found to be from 80 to 181 feet. The lake is
eight miles long and from one to two miles wide. It empties
into the Fox River by a deep creek at the east end.

My mother, Ann Hamilton Reid, daughter of William
Reid, was born in Glasgow, Scotland, October 23, 1823. She
was married to my father, George Manierre, after whom I
was named, in Detroit in 1842.

[83]

The authorâs reminiscences of the Manierre family have been printed in
Volume 8 Number 3 of the Illinois State Historical Society
Publications
.

[84]

James Van Slyke made the first settlement near the Potawatomi Indian
village in that place which later became the town of Walworth. He built a
cabin and moved his family there from Geneva in the fall of 1836. Mrs. Van
Slyke is supposed to have been the only white woman who spent that winter
there. Many stories are told of the courage she displayed in this frontier community.

[85]

Matthias Mohr was one of the earliest residents of Walworth County,
settling on part of the Van Slyke claim at the head of Lake Geneva in 1837.
He later went to Kansas where he died in 1887. Glenwood Springs Park now
stands on the site of his farm.

[86]

Marcus and Robert Russell settled at the west end of Lake Geneva in
1837. Robert Russell later moved to Iowa. Marcus Russell died in 1875.

[87]

Christopher Douglass was born in Connecticut in 1797 and moved to Wisconsin
in 1837, settling on Big Foot Prairie. In 1842 he moved to the town of
Walworth, where he kept a hotel for several years. In 1857 he took up his residence
at the head of Lake Geneva where he died in 1866.

[88]

C. L. Douglass, son of Christopher Douglass, was born in New York November
4, 1827, and came to Wisconsin with his father in 1837. In 1857 he built and
equipped Big Foot Mills which he continued to operate for thirty years. He
died January 6, 1898.

[89]

Fontana, a summer resort at the head of Lake Geneva, covers the site of the
old Potawatomi village and is part of the old Van Slyke claim. It was purchased
of Van Slyke in 1838 by Matthias Mohr, Amos Bailey, and Dr. Henry Clark,
who platted and named the village.

[90]

Mrs. John H. Kinzie,
Wau Bun, the early day in the North-west
(New
York, 1856), 318-22. Mrs. Kinzie in company with her husband, U. S. sub-Indian
agent at Fort Winnebago, was making the trip from Chicago to Fort
Winnebago (Portage) in 1831 when she visited Big Footâs village. She describes
the chief as a âlarge, rawboned, ugly Indian with a countenance bloated by intemperance,
and with a sinister, unpleasant expression.â

[91]

This was Big Footâs son, who died about 1830. The body was encased in a
rude coffin and fastened to the limbs of a tree overlooking the lake. Big Foot
is said to have given as his reason for this mode of burial that his son had been
unusually fond of lake scenery, and he would thus enjoy a fine view of it from the
land to which he had gone.

[92]

Big Foot was the last chief of his band to rule his people in their own
land. In 1827, when the Winnebago were on the war path, Big Foot, a sturdy
hater of the whites, tried to incite the Potawatomi to join the northern Indians.
He was prevented by measures taken by
Gov.
Lewis Cass which culminated in
the treaty of September 15, 1827. Being bound by former treaties, Big Foot
remained neutral during the Black Hawk War. By the treaty of 1832 the territory
of the Potawatomi and their allies, the Chippewa and the Ottawa, comprising
southeastern Wisconsin, passed to the United States government. Big Foot
refused to sign the treaty until the other chiefs had done so.

[93]

Elbridge Gerry Ayer, born in Haverhill, Mass., July 25, 1813, came to
Wisconsin in 1836. In 1847 he moved to Walworth, going from there to McHenry
County, Ill. in 1857, where he founded the town of Harvard. There for eighteen
years he and his wife conducted one of the best hotels in the state. During
the Civil War they gave without pay food, lodging, and other assistance to the
wounded Union soldiers detained in that vicinity. On the occasion of their
golden wedding in 1885
Gov.
James Lewis of Wisconsin, on behalf of the Wisconsin
soldiers, presented to Mr. and Mrs. Ayer a gold cup, now in the museum of
the Wisconsin Historical Society. The inscription is as follows: âPresented to
Mr. and Mrs. E. G. Ayer by the Wisconsin soldiers as a token of remembrance
and appreciation of the many acts of kindness toward them during the dark days
of the Rebellion, from 1861 to 1865,
Oct.
29, 1885.â

[94]

Edward Everett Ayer, of Chicago, son of Mr. and Mrs. Elbridge G.
Ayer, has long been connected with enterprises relating to arts and letters. He
is a director of the Newberry Library, of the Field Museum, and of the Art
Institute. He himself has one of the finest private libraries in the United States
which contains manuscripts relating to the early history of North America, the
Indians, Mexico, the West Indies, and the Philippines.

DESCRIPTION OF A JOURNEY TO NORTH
AMERICA

FOREWORD

By Rasmus B. Anderson

I have been asked to prepare a brief introduction for Ole
Nattestadâs description of his journey from Norway to
America in 1837. In complying with this request I shall
make free use of facts and statements published by me in
various other works and particularly in my
First Chapter of
Norwegian Immigration
(1906).

The Norsemen have an honorable place in the annals of
America. We may, indeed, say that the civilized history of
this country begins with the Norsemen. If you look at a map
you will at once find that Greenland and even a part of Iceland
belong to the western hemisphere, and Iceland became
the hinge upon which the door swings that opens America
to Europe. It was the occupation of Iceland by the Norsemen
in the year 874 and the frequent voyages between this
island and Norway that led to the discovery and settlement
first of Greenland and then of America, and it is due to the
culture and fine historical taste of the Icelanders that carefully
prepared records of these Norse voyages were kept, first
to teach pelagic navigation to Columbus and afterwards to
solve for us the mysteries concerning the first discovery of
this continent.

The old republican Vikings well understood the importance
of studying the art of ship-building and of navigation.
They knew how to measure time by the stars and how to
calculate the course of the sun and moon. They were themselves
pioneers in venturing out upon the high seas and taught
the rest of the world to navigate the ocean. Every scrap of
written history sustains me when I say that the other peoples

Pg 150

of the world were limited in their nautical knowledge to
coast navigation. The Norse Vikings who crossed the stormy
North Sea, finding their way to Great Britain, to the Orkneys,
the FarÃ¶es, and to Iceland, all those heroes who found
their way to Greenland and Vinland, taught the world pelagic
navigation. They demonstrated the possibility of venturing
out of sight of land, and in this sense, if in no other, we may
with perfect propriety assert that the Norsemen taught
Columbus how to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

That the Norsemen held an honorable place in the annals
of America is shown by a fact of the greatest importance in
the worldâs history, namely, that the Norsemen anticipated
by five centuries Christopher Columbus and Amerigo
Vespucius and the new world was discovered by Leif
Erikson in the year 1000. About the year 860 the Norsemen
discovered Iceland and soon afterwards (in 874) they established
upon this island a republic which flourished for 400
years. Greenland was seen for the first time in 876 by Gunnbjorn
Ulfson from Norway. About a century later, in the
year 984, Erik the Red resolved to go in search of the lands
in the west which Gunnbjorn as well as others later had seen.
He sailed from Iceland, and found a land as he had expected,
and remained there exploring the country for two years. At
the end of this period he returned to Iceland, giving the
newly-discovered country the name of Greenland in order,
as he said, to attract settlers who would be favorably impressed
with so pleasing a name. Thus, as Greenland belongs
geographically wholly to America, it will be seen that Erik
the Red was the first white man to boom American real estate.
And he was successful. Many Norsemen emigrated, particularly
from Iceland, and a flourishing colony with Gardar as
its capital and Erik the Red as its first governor was established
and became the first settlement of Europeans in the
new world. In the year 1261 it became subject to the crown
of Norway. We have a list of seventeen bishops who served

Pg 151

in Greenland. Erik the Red and his followers were not
Christian when they settled in Greenland, but worshippers of
Odin and Thor, though they relied chiefly on their own might
and strength. Christianity was introduced among them about
the year 1000, though Erik the Red continued to adhere to
the religion of his fathers to his dying day.

The first white man whose eyes beheld any part of the
American continent was the Norseman, Bjarne Herjulfson,
who saw this land in the year 986. The first white man who,
to our knowledge, planted his feet on the soil of the American
continent was Leif Erikson, the son of Erik the Red, in
the year 1000; and Leifâs brother Thorvald, who died in 1002,
was the first white man and the first Christian who was buried
beneath American sod. Thorfin Karlsefne, who landed in
1007, was the first white man to found a settlement within
the limits of the present United States, and his wife, Gudrid,
was the first white woman who came to Vinland. In the year
1008 she gave birth to a son in Vinland. The boy, who received
in baptism the name Snorre, was the first person of
European descent born in the new world. In 1112 Erik Upsi
settled as bishop in Greenland and in 1121 this same bishop
went on a missionary journey from Greenland to Vinland,
the first visit of a Christian minister to the American continent.
The last of these interesting voyages before the rediscovery
of America by Columbus was in the year 1347 when
a Greenland ship with a crew of eighteen men came from Nova
Scotia (Markland) to Straumfjord in Iceland. Thus it appears
that the Vinland voyages extended over a period of
about 350 years and to within 145 years of the rediscovery
of America by Columbus in 1492. From the accounts of
these voyages and settlements we get our first knowledge and
descriptions of the aborigines of America.

While Leif Erikson was the first white man to plant his
feet on the eastern shores of the American continent, it was
left to another plucky Scandinavian to become the discoverer

Pg 152

of the narrow body of water which separates America from
Asia. Vitus Bering was a Dane born in Jutland, in Denmark,
in 1680. He entered the service of Russia and in 1725
was made commander-in-chief of one of the greatest geographical
expeditions ever undertaken. He explored the Sea
of Kamchatka and during this voyage in 1728 he discovered
Bering Strait and ascertained that Asia was not joined to
America, thus becoming the discoverer of the extreme western
boundary line of the continent.

The first visit of Scandinavians to America proper in post-Columbian
times occurred in the year 1619, just a year before
the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth. In the spring of
that year King Christian
IV
fitted out two ships, the

Eenhjorningen
and the
Lamprenen
, for the purpose of finding
a northwest passage to Asia. The commander of this
expedition was the Norwegian, Jens Munk, born at Barby
in southern Norway in 1579. Sailing from Copenhagen with
his two ships and sixty-six men May 9, 1619, he explored
Hudson Bay and took possession of the surrounding country
in the name of his sovereign and gave it the name of Nova
Dania. All the members of this expedition perished except
Jens Munk and two of his crew, who returned to Norway
September 25, 1620, the undertaking having proved a complete
failure. The ship chaplain on this expedition was a
Danish Lutheran minister, Rasmus Jensen Aarhus, the first
minister to preach Lutheranism in the new world. He died
February 20, 1620, on the southwestern shore of Hudson Bay
at the mouth of the Churchill River. His last sermon was a
funeral sermon preached from his own death bed.

Norwegians and Danes came to New Amsterdam (New
York) at a very early period. Traces of Scandinavians in
New York can be found as early as 1617. In 1704 these
Norwegians and Danes built a stone church on the corner
of Broadway and Rector streets, where regular services were
held in the Danish language until the property was sold to

Pg 153

Trinity Church, the present churchyard occupying the site
of the early building. The first directory published in New
York shows many names of unquestionable Norwegian or
Danish origin.

It is well known that the Swedes founded a settlement on
the Delaware in 1638, and the Swedish language was used
in a Philadelphia church as late as 1823. John Morton, one
of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and an
active member of the Continental Congress, was a descendant
of the Swedes of Delaware. Robert Anderson, the
gallant defender of Fort Sumter, against which the first gun
of the Civil War was fired, was also a scion of the Swedes
on the Delaware, and so it appears that love of freedom and
patriotism and statecraft and valor came to America not only
in the
Mayflower
but also in the
Kalmarnyckel
and
Vogelgrip
,
which brought the first Swedish settlers to America
in 1638.

How many Norwegians landed in America between the
years 1492 and 1821 it is impossible to determine. There
are no government statistics to guide us and we know there
was no regular or systematic emigration from any of the
Scandinavian countries. It is certain that no Norwegians
came in collective bodies to form settlements, and we can trace
them only through their descendants who have kept family
records or through public documents or published works
where they happen to be mentioned. In this way some of
the Scandinavians who settled in New Amsterdam have been
found.

In a similar manner we find the names of Norwegians
and Swedes who took part in the war of the Revolution.
There is the case of Thomas Johnson. In Volume 28 (1874)
of the
New England Historical and Genealogical Register

we find a full account of Thomas Johnson who served under
Paul Jones, first in the crew of the
Ranger
and afterwards in
the crew of the
Bonhomme Richard
. Johnson was the son of a

Pg 154

pilot at Mandal, a seaport on the southwest coast of Norway,
where he was born in 1758. In the absence of his father, he
towed the first American vessel, the
Ranger
, commanded by
Paul Jones, into the harbor of Mandal. After their arrival
Jones sent for the young pilot and, presenting him with a piece
of gold, expressed his pleasure at his expert seamanship,
which he had minutely watched during the towing of the ship
into the harbor. Jones had made the port of Mandal for the
purpose of recruiting the crew of the
Ranger
; and, satisfactory
arrangements having been made with his father,
Johnson was received on board as a seaman. Thomas Johnson
died at the age of ninety-three at the United States Naval
Asylum in Philadelphia on July 12, 1851; he had been there
for many years a pensioner, and was known by the soubriquet
âPaul Jones.â The account of Thomas Johnson led me to
investigate further into the history of John Paul Jones, and
in his biography, written by John Henry Sherburne, register
of the navy of the United States, published at Washington
in 1825, I found a roll of officers, seamen, marines, and
volunteers who served on board the
Bonhomme Richard
in her
cruise made in 1779. In this roll the native country of every
man is given and in it I found two seamen born in Norway
and seven born in Sweden.

Here I may also mention the brilliant Swede, Colonel
Axel Fersen, who, in 1779, went to France where he was
appointed colonel of the Royal Regiment of Swedes. He
served with distinction at the head of his regiment in the
later campaigns of the American War, distinguishing himself
on various occasions, particularly in 1781, during the
siege of Yorktown, where he was aide-de-camp to General
Rochambeau. He also took part in the negotiations between
General Washington and General Rochambeau. He afterwards
became Marshal of the kingdom of Sweden.

It is fair to presume that a considerable number of enterprising
Scandinavians found their way to their old Vinland

Pg 155

during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and particularly
during the first quarter of the nineteenth century.

In the early days of the American republic diplomatic and
consular relations were established with the Scandinavian
countries, and there was more or less commerce between Norway,
Sweden, and Denmark and the United States. This
financial and commercial intercourse would naturally induce
some Scandinavians to visit the United States and others to
settle within our gates. The many Scandinavian names found
in the old directories of New York, Philadelphia, and other
eastern cities are largely to be accounted for in this manner.

From the year 1820 the United States government supplies
us with immigration statistics, but in these Sweden and
Norway are grouped together down to the year 1868, and
hence it is impossible to determine until then how many immigrants
came from each country. From the year 1836 we are
helped out by Norway, where the government then began to
collect and prepare statistics of emigration.

The father of Norwegian emigration to the United States
in the nineteenth century was Kleng Peerson from near
Stavanger, Norway. In the year 1821 he with a comrade,
Knud Olson Eide, was sent from Norway to New York by the
Society of Quakers in and near Stavanger for the purpose
of making an investigation of conditions and opportunities
in the United States. After a sojourn of three years in
America, all that time being spent in and around New York
City, they returned to Norway. Here their reports of social,
political, and religious conditions in America and their description
of opportunities in the new world awakened great interest,
inducing a resolution on the part of many to emigrate.
Lars Larsen, the man at whose house the first Quaker meeting
had been held in Stavanger in 1816, at once undertook
to organize a party of emigrants. Being successful in finding
the number of people who were ready and willing to join
him, the heads of families furnished their scanty possessions

Pg 156

in money and purchased a sloop which had been built in the
Hardanger Fjord between Stavanger and Bergen and which
they loaded with a cargo of iron. For this sloop and cargo
they paid the sum of $1,800.

This little Norwegian
Mayflower
of the nineteenth
century received the name
Restaurationen
(the âRestorationâ)
and on the day of American Independence, July 4,
1825, the brave little company of emigrants sailed out of the
harbor of the ancient and grotesque city of Stavanger. The
company consisted of fifty-two persons, including the two
officers, chiefly from Stavanger City and Tysver Parish,
north of Stavanger. They were fifty-two when they left
Stavanger, but when they reached New York on the second
Sunday of October (October 9) they numbered fifty-three,
the wife of the leader, Larsen, having given birth to a beautiful
girl baby on the second of September.

From 1825 to 1836 there was but little emigration from
Norway. Before 1836 there were no vessels carrying emigrants
from Norway to America. Those who did emigrate
came either by way of Gothenborg, Sweden, or Havre, in
which cities passengers to America could be accommodated.

Gothenborg vessels carried Swedish iron to America but
emigrants frequently had to wait for weeks before they found
a ship bound for New York. From Hamburg regular packet
ships carried German emigrants, but these were so numerous
that there was frequently a delay of from two to three weeks
before they could be accommodated. In Havre the emigrant
packets were also regular but there were not so many emigrants
and the Norwegians could count on going on the first
ship leaving port. This made Havre the most popular point
of departure from Europe for the Norwegians.

Of course, a great number of letters were written by the
Norwegians in America to relatives and friends in Norway
and these were read by hundreds who were anxious to better
their fortunes. Finally, one of the sloop passengers, Knud

Pg 157

Anderson Slogvig, returned to Norway in 1835 and the news
that he had arrived at his old home in the Skjold district
spread far and wide and created the greatest excitement. He
was the hero of the day. People traveled hundreds of miles
to see and talk with him. Letters from emigrants had been
read with the deepest interest but here was a man who had
spent ten years in the new world! Through Knud Slogvig
the American fever spread beyond the limits of Stavanger
Amt and Christiansand Stift. This led to the great exodus of
1836, when the two Koehler brigs,
Norden
and
Den Norske
Klippe
, were fitted out for emigrants in Stavanger and left
that summer loaded with about two hundred passengers for
New York. On board the
Norden
my father and mother and
my two oldest brothers were passengers. The American fever
continued, calling for two ships in 1837, the
Aegir
from
Bergen and the
Enighedon
from Egershund. Then there
was a partial lull, until after 1840, when the American fever
set in for good. It has continued to rage ever since, culminating
in the year 1882, when over 29,000 Norwegians landed
in the United States.

Those who came in the sloop
Restaurationen
settled in
Kendall, Orleans County, New York, on the shores of Lake
Ontario. In 1833 we find Kleng Peerson in company with a
Quaker, Ingebret Larsen Narvig, who had come from Norway
to Boston in 1831 and footed it from there to Kendall,
on their way to the far west. Larsen parted company with
Kleng and went to work for a farmer in Michigan. Kleng
continued his journey westward until he reached La Salle
County, Illinois, and there selected the location of the second
Norwegian settlement in this country. Kendall and Fox
River settlement in Illinois was his undying glory. Most of
the settlers in Orleans County, New York, on the advice of
Kleng, moved to the Fox River settlement. In 1836 these
were joined by the 200 immigrants who came in the
Norden

Pg 158

and the
Den Norske Klippe
, and in 1837 by many of those
who came in the
Aegir
and the
Enighedon
.

One of the Norwegians who came in the
Aegir
was Ole
Rynning, a name well known in the annals of Norwegian
immigration. On reaching Chicago he was persuaded by
a couple of Americans to go with some of his friends to inspect
lands some eighty miles south of Chicago along Beaver Creek
with the view of founding a Norwegian settlement there. Ole
Rynning chose as his companions on this journey of inspection
Niels Veste from Etne in Norway, Ingebrigt Brudvig,
and Ole Nattestad from Numedal, Norway, the latter the
author of the book herewith published. Ole Nattestad and
his brother, Ansten, had just arrived by way of Gothenborg,
Sweden, and Fall River, Massachusetts, and joining a group
of other immigrants in Detroit, Michigan, had accompanied
them to Chicago. The rest of the company remained in
Chicago to await the result. Ole Nattestad stated that he
did not like the land, it being sandy and swampy, but as the
others were pleased with it, it was agreed that Nattestad and
Veste should remain and put up a log house for the reception
of the immigrants while Rynning and Brudvig returned
to Chicago to fetch their friends.

Some of those who were left in Chicago in the meantime
had gone to the Fox River settlement but the most of them
went with Rynning and Brudvig to Beaver Creek. There
were no settlers in the immediate vicinity and it was difficult
to procure the common necessities of life, although the most
of these people were well supplied with money. Many of the
new settlers grumbled and were inclined to find fault with
Ole Rynning and the others who were responsible for the
selection of this settlement. All chose land for farms, and
before winter set in a sufficient number of log houses had been
built. The number of settlers here was about fifty. These
people were well and happy in America during the first
winter, but the next spring the whole settlement was flooded

Pg 159

and the swamp was turned into a veritable lake. In the summer
the settlers were attacked by malarial fever. In a short
time no less than fourteen or fifteen deaths occurred and
among those who here found his last resting place was Ole
Rynning. The survivors fled, leaving farms and houses, as
there was nobody to buy land where a malarial atmosphere
threatened the inhabitants with almost certain destruction.
The most of those who fled found their way to the Fox River
settlement, reaching there late in the summer of 1838. Only
a few remained two or three years, defying the dangers to
health and life, the last one to leave the colony being Mons
Aadland, a brother of the well-known journalist and author,
Knud Langland. He finally exchanged his farm for a small
number of cows at auction and went to Racine County, Wisconsin,
where he lived to a ripe old age.

Ole Rynning became particularly conspicuous and influential
on account of a book which he published in Christiania,
Norway, in 1838, the title of which is
âSandfaerdig Beretning
on Amerika til Oplysning og Nytte for Bonde og
Menigmand forfattet af en norsk, som kom derover i Juni
Maaned 1837,â
that is, âA Truthful Account of America for
the Instruction and Help of the Peasant and Commoner
Written by a Norwegian Who Came there in the Month of
June, 1837.â The authorâs name is given at the end of the
preface where we read: âIllinois, February 13, 1838, Ole
Rynning.â

This little book of only thirty-nine pages is now exceedingly
scarce. I obtained a copy of it from
Rev.
B. J. Muus
of Goodhue County, Minnesota. In the nineties I reprinted
it in
Amerika
and struck off about two hundred copies which
I had bound and placed in various libraries. A copy of it may
be found in the library of the Wisconsin State Historical
Society.

We began with Erik the Red and Leif Erikson and have
now come to the brothers, Ole and Ansten Nattestad. Ole K.

Pg 160

Nattestad was born December 24, 1807; died May 28, 1886.
His wife died September 15, 1888. Ansten K. Nattestad
was born August 20, 1813; died April 8, 1889.

The fourth Norwegian settlement in America and the
first in Wisconsin was founded by Ole Knudsen Nattestad
(changed in America to Natesta) who was accordingly the
first Norwegian to set foot on Wisconsin soil. He came to
Clinton, Rock County, Wisconsin, July 1, 1838, and this
was the beginning of the so-called Jefferson Prairie settlement,
which occupies the southeast corner of Rock County
and extends into Boone County, Illinois. They came from
Vegli, Rolloug Parish in Numedal, Norway, by way of
Gothenborg and Fall River, Massachusetts.

When the Beaver Creek settlement was abandoned,
Ansten Nattestad, in the spring of 1838, returned to Norway,
taking with him the Ole Rynning manuscript and also
the manuscript of a journal kept by his brother, Ole
Nattestad. Ansten stated that this manuscript of his brother
was published in Drammen, Norway, that same year but in
spite of the most diligent search I have never been able to
secure a copy of that edition. In Norway copies of all publications
are placed in the University Library. I had this
library searched for a copy of Nattestadâs book but none could
be found. In an interview published in
Billed Magazin
in
Madison, Wisconsin, in 1869, Ansten Nattestad made the following
statement:

In the spring of 1838 I went from Beaver Creek, Illinois, by way of
New Orleans to Liverpool in England and thence to Norway to visit
friends and acquaintances in my native land. I brought with me letters
from nearly all the earlier Norwegian emigrants whom I had met and in
this way information was scattered far and wide in Norway. My
brotherâs journal was published in Drammen and Ole Rynningâs work on
matters of the new world appeared at the same time in Christiania. Of
Rynningâs book I brought the manuscript with me from America. The

Rev.
Mr. Kragh in Eidsvold read the proofs and left out the chapter about
the Norwegian clergymen who therein were accused of intolerance in
religious matters and inactivity in questions concerning the betterment
of the people in temporal affairs and in questions concerning the advancement
of education.

Pg 161

In 1869 Ole Nattestad gave the following account of himself
in the
Billed Magazin
referred to above:

As the next oldest of three brothers, I did not have the right of
primogeniture to my fatherâs farm which, according to law, and custom,
would go to the oldest son. My ambition was to become a farmer, and
I hoped some day to be able to buy a farm in my own neighborhood.
Then my brother entered the military school in Christiania and I was to
manage the farm during his absence. I entered upon my task cheerfully,
worked with all my might and kept a careful account of income and disbursements.
To my great surprise, I soon found that in spite of all my
toil and prudence, I did not make much headway. When the year was
ended, I had little or nothing left as a reward for my labor and it was
clear to me that it would not do to buy an expensive farm and run in debt
for it. Farming did not pay in the locality where I was born. I then
tried the occupation of an itinerant merchant. I could earn a living in
this way, but the laws were against me and I did not like to carry on a
business of such a nature that it was necessary to keep my affairs secret
from the
lensmand
[undersheriff]. Then I worked awhile as a blacksmith.
This furnished me enough to do, but it was difficult to collect the money
I earned. The law did not permit me to work at my trade in the city.
Then [in 1836] my younger brother, Ansten, and I went across the
mountains to the western part of Norway to buy sheep which we intended
to sell again. While we were stopping in the vicinity of Stavanger, we
heard much talk about a country which was called America. This was
the first time we heard this word. We saw letters written by Norwegians
who were living in America and we were told that Knud Slogvig, who,
many years before that had emigrated in a sloop [
Restaurationen
] from
Stavanger, had lately visited his native land and had given so favorable
a report about America that about 150 [should be 200] emigrants from
Stavanger Amt and from Hardanger had gone back with him and had
sailed that very summer [1836] in two brigs from Stavanger across the
ocean. They had gone in spite of all sorts of threats and warnings about
slavery, death, and disease. This was the first large exodus after the
emigration of the sloop party in 1825. All that we here saw was so new
and came to us so unexpectedly that we were not at once able to arrange
all the reports into a systematic whole and thus get a correct idea of
conditions in the new world. But when I spent the following Christmas
with Even Nubbru who was a member of the Storthing from Sigdal we
discussed the hard times in my native valley and I suggested that I might
have better luck in some other part of the country. In replying Even
Nubbru remarked that wherever I went in the world, I would nowhere find
a people who had as good laws as the Americans. He had accidentally
just had the opportunity of reading something about America in a German
newspaper and he described the free institutions of America. This information
had a magic effect on me as I looked upon it as an injustice that
the laws of Norway should forbid me to trade and not allow me to get
my living by honest work as a mechanic wherever I desired to locate.
I had confidence in the judgment of the member of the Storthing and I

Pg 162

compared his remarks with what I had heard about America in the vicinity
of Stavanger. Gradually I got to thinking of emigration and while considering
the matter on my way home, the idea matured into a resolution.
My brother Ansten did not have to be asked a second time. He was willing
at once; he approved of my plans and in April, 1837, we were ready
for our journey. When we left home, we had together about eight hundred
dollars, Norwegian money, but this sum gradually grew less on account
of our expenses on the way and besides we lost considerable in changing
our money into American coin. Ansten also paid the passage for Halsten
Halvorsen Braekke-Eiet who now [1869] resides in Dodgeville [Wisconsin],
and is looked upon as an excellent blacksmith.

Our equipment consisted of the clothes we wore, a pair of skis, and
a knapsack. People looked at us with wonder and intimated that we
must have lost our senses. They suggested that we had better hang
ourselves in the first tree in order to avoid a worse fate. We went on skis
across the mountains from Rolloug to Tin and thence in a direct line over
hills and through forests to Stavanger, where we expected to get passage
across the sea. We did not worry about the roads for all three of us were
experts on skis and our baggage caused us no inconvenience. In Stavanger
we told everybody that we were going to America and wanted to secure
passage across the sea. This open-heartedness came near spoiling our
plans. The report of three mountaineers soon spread over the whole city
and high government officials came to see our passports. We were now
told that the bailiffâs passport only permitted us to go to Stavanger while
the certificate from the pastor correctly stated that we intended to leave
the country and emigrate to America. We were not versed in such things
and thought our papers were in order, especially as the documents we
carried gave testimony that we were men of good habits and Christian
conduct. No suspicious remarks were made but in the evening there came
a man who was angry on account of the wrong the officials were going
to do us and related that it had been resolved that we were to be arrested
the following day and then to be sent from
lensmand
to
lensmand
to our
native valley as we intended to leave the country without permission being
given in the passport from the bailiff. The government here, he said,
was in a bitter rage against all emigrants and we could not count on any
mercy. On this manâs advice we departed secretly from Stavanger under
cover of night in order to avoid the danger that threatened us and without
attracting any attention we got to Tananger. Here we met a skipper
who, with his yacht loaded with herring, was ready to sail to Gothenborg.
He promised to take us on board, but when we told him what had happened
to us in Stavanger, he became doubtful. He praised our honesty,
and on further assurance that we would assume all responsibility if we
got in trouble, he decided to accept us as passengers. We acted
discreetly while we were ashore and we felt greatly relieved when
we finally got to sea. In Gothenborg we had no mishaps, and we secured
passage in a vessel loaded with Swedish iron and bound for Fall River,
Massachusetts. The journey lasted thirty-two days and we paid fifty
dollars each for transportation and board. From Fall River we went
to New York where we met a few Norwegians who helped us to get to

Pg 163

Rochester. Here we talked with some of our countrymen who, twelve
years ago, had come in the sloop from Stavanger that brought the first
Norwegian immigrants to America. Rochester and vicinity did not meet
our expectations in regard to the new world. Many of the first immigrants
had left the first settlement in Kendall and had gone west to find
new lands, particularly to La Salle County, Illinois, near Ottawa on the
Fox River. The Fox River colony received a very considerable increment
by the great exodus from Stavanger in 1836, that is, the year before
I came to America. The most of these immigrants had located in that
settlement. This we learned in Rochester, and there we heard for the
first time the name Chicago. We determined to go west and see what
we could find. When we had reached Detroit, I was walking in the
streets to look at the town. There I accidentally met a man by whose
clothes I could see that he was from the western coast of Norway. I
greeted the man and he returned my greeting, and the meeting was like
that of two brothers who had not seen each other for years. He informed
me that he had left Bergen some months before, together with about
seventy [should be eighty-four] passengers and that the whole company
of which the University secretary, Ole Rynning, was the leader, had been
waiting a week for transportation to Chicago. We were glad to meet
our countrymen and we joined the party, in which there was at least one
[Rynning] who could speak English. On landing in Chicago we met
Bjorn Anderson Kvelve [the father of the present editor] from the
Stavanger company. He had come to America the year before [1836]
and had travelled through various parts of Illinois but all that he had
heard and seen had only served to make him dissatisfied with this side
of the ocean. Broken down in soul and body, he stood before us as a
victim of misery and produced a scene so terrible that it never will be
blotted from my memory. âGod bless and comfort you!â said he. âThere
is neither work nor land nor food to be had and by all means do not go
to Fox River; there you will all die from malarial fever.â These words
had a terrible effect on our little flock, many of whom had already lost
all courage. Like demons from the lower world, all the evil warnings
about the terrors that awaited the emigrants to America were now called
to mind and even the bravest were as by magic stricken by a panic which
bordered on insanity. The women wrung their hands in despair and
uttered terrible shrieks of woe. Some of the men stood immovable like
statues with all the marks of frightful despair on their faces, while
others made threats against those whom they regarded as the promoters
of emigration and the leaders of the party. But in this critical situation
Ole Rynningâs greatness appeared. He stood in the midst of the people
who were ready for mutiny; he comforted those in despair and gave
advice to those who doubted and hesitated and reproved those who were
obstinate. He was not in doubt for a moment and his equanimity,
courage, and noble self-sacrifice for the weal of others had acquired him
influence in the minds of all. The storm abated and the dissatisfaction
gave place to a unanimous confidence. A couple of Americans with
whom Rynning talked advised him to take the immigrants to Beaver
Creek, directly south of Chicago in Iroquois County.

Pg 164

It seems to me that the story told about my father must,
to say the least, be overdrawn. The facts as I have them
from my mother, from Mons Aadland, and even from Ole
Nattestad himself, do not warrant the painting of so weird
a picture. All the prose there is in the romance is that my
father met these people in Chicago and was unwilling to
recommend the Fox River settlement with which he was not
pleased, and as he had never seen Iroquois County, he had no
share in recommending the immigrants to go to Beaver Creek.
His dissatisfaction with the Fox River settlement is further
confirmed by the fact that in 1840 he found a new home in
Albion, Dane County, Wisconsin. In support of my view,
I may here quote the words of
Prof.
Svein Nilsson in
Billed
Magazin
(1869) where, in alluding to the Beaver Creek
settlement he states:

Ole Rynningâs company met Bjorn Anderson Kvelve in Chicago.
The unfavorable description he gave of the land both west and north
frightened the immigrants from locating in any of the existing Norwegian
colonies and this resulted in the founding of the Beaver Creek
Settlement whose sad story is well known to the Scandinavian population
in the northwest. In this connection bitter reproaches have been
directed against Bjorn Anderson Kvelve as being in a great measure to
blame for the fatalities of Beaver Creek. But it is usually the case
that people like to seek in others the cause of their misfortune. This
is true of the individual as well as of corporations and societies and
perhaps a little more so in the case of the immigrants visited by adversity.
At all events, it is our opinion that we do a justice to the man
when we say that the criticism of Bjorn Anderson Kvelve has been too
severe, if not utterly unfounded.

Ole Nattestad continues:

In the spring of 1838 my brother, Ansten, went to Norway and I
worked by the day in the northern part of Illinois.

The first of July, 1838, I came to my present home in about the
middle of the town of Clinton, Rock County, Wisconsin, where I bought
land and I am consequently the first Norwegian to settle in this state.
So far as known, no other Norwegian had planted his feet on Wisconsin
soil before me. For a whole year I saw no countryman but lived alone
without friend, family, or companion. Eight Americans had settled in
the town before me but they lived about as isolated as I did. I found
the soil very fertile and the monotony of the prairie was relieved by
small bunches of trees. Deer and other game were abundant. The
horrid howl of the prairie wolf disturbed my sleep until habit armed

Pg 165

my ears against annoyances of this sort. The following summer [1839]
I built a little log hut and in this residence I received in September a
number of people from my own parish in Norway. They had come as
immigrants with my brother, Ansten. The most of these settled on Jefferson
Prairie and in this way the settlement got a large population in a
comparatively short time.

In 1840 Ole Nattestad married Lena Hiser who died
September 15, 1888. She left seven children, all well educated
and in good circumstances. Henry, the youngest son,
now occupies the old homestead.

We now pass to Ansten Nattestad, the brother of Ole, and
will let him tell the story as published in the
Billed Magazin
:

In the spring of 1838 I went by way of New Orleans to Liverpool
and thence to Norway to visit friends and acquaintances in my native
landâ¦. [What he tells about Rynningâs and his brother Oleâs
manuscripts has already been stated.] I spent the winter in Numedal.
The report of my return spread like wildfire through the land and an
incredible number of people came to see me and to get news from
America. Many came as far as twenty Norwegian [140 English] miles
to have a talk with me. It was impossible to answer all the letters I
received asking questions about the condition of things on the other side
of the ocean. In the spring of 1839 about 100 persons from Numedal
stood ready to go with me across the sea. Among these were many
farmers and heads of families, all, excepting the children, able-bodied
persons in their best years. Besides these there were a number from
Thelemarken and from Numedal who were unable to join me as our
ship was full. We went from Drammen direct to New York. It was
the first time the inhabitants of Drammen saw an emigrant ship. [The
name of the ship was
Emelia
and the Captainâs name was Ankerson].
Each person paid $33.50 for his passage. We were nine weeks on the
sea; the passage was a successful one and there was no death on
board. From New York we took the common route up the country.
In Milwaukee we met those from Tin and Thelemarken and the others
who were unable to come in our ship across the sea. [They had come
by way of Gothenborg, Sweden, to Boston.] They came on board to us
and wanted us to go with them to Muskego, Wisconsin. Men had
been out there to inspect the country and they reported that the grass
was so high that it reached up to their shoulders and told of many other
glorious things. The Americans, too, used every argument to persuade
us to stop in Milwaukee. I objected and we continued our journey.
In Chicago I learned that my brother, Ole, had settled in Wisconsin
during my absence in Norway. Some of the party went to the Fox
River settlement where they had acquaintances, while some unmarried
persons found employment in Chicago and vicinity. The rest of them,
that is to say, the majority, accompanied me to Jefferson Prairie. Among
these were a few who settled in the town of Rock Run, Stevenson

Pg 166

County, in the northern part of Illinois about fifty miles southwest from
Jefferson Prairie, and there they formed the nucelus of the Norwegian
settlement. Others of my company went to Rock Prairie, a few miles
west of Jefferson Prairie. I and the rest came at once to Jefferson
Prairie where we bought land and began to cultivate it.

In 1840 a few came here from Numedal and from that time the
number of settlers steadily increased, chiefly by new arrivals from
Norway. The most of those from Numedal settled in the northern part
of the colony, for we who came after my brother, who was here before
any of us, bought land in the place where he had built his cabin and
those from the same part of Norway who came later as immigrants and
who sought us out in the far west settled as our neighbors. I and the
first Numedalians chose this tract as our home and our choice was made
immediately after our arrival. The same autumn, 1839, a company from
Voss in Norway came to the settlement. These Vossings went farther
south and as âbirds of a feather flock togetherâ so their friends from
Voss gradually settled with them. Hence the Jefferson Prairie settlement,
as to population, may be divided into two districts, of which the
northern consists chiefly of Numedalians while the Vossings predominate
in the southern part.

In searching for the Nattestad book I learned that Ole
Nattestad had preserved a manuscript copy of it and that
sometime in the eighties he had handed this to
Prof.
Peter
Hendrickson, then editor-in-chief of
Skandinaven
in Chicago,
with the view of having the manuscript revised and
reprinted; but before Professor Hendrickson found time to
do this work, his home in Evanston, Illinois, was burned to
the ground and in this fire the Nattestad manuscript was lost.
Not long since, however, it was shown that the Nattestad
book was not a myth. Mr. H. L. Skavlem of Janesville,
Wisconsin, is a most patient and thorough student of Norwegian
pioneer life in America, and especially of everything
pertaining to the people who have emigrated from Numedal.
In 1915 he published an account of the âSkavlem and Odegaarden
Families in this Countryâ which is a masterpiece of
genealogical records and pioneer history. Mr. Skavlem,
beside being an authority on Indian relics and on Wisconsin
bird life, has done much to preserve the history of the Norwegians
in America. It was he who secured a printed copy
of the Nattestad book for preservation in the library of the

Pg 167

State Historical Society, so far as known the only copy in
existence.

TITLE PAGE OF OLE NATTESTADâS âJOURNEY TO NORTH
AMERICAâ

Photographed from the copy in the Wisconsin Historical Library

Of this copy, which is now being printed in an English
translation, Mr. Skavlem gives the following account:

In the summer of the year 1900 James and Henry Natesta, the sons
of Ole K. Nattestad, the author of the pamphlet, took a short trip to
Norway to visit the home of their forefathers, located in Vegli, Numedal.
They made diligent inquiries for a pamphlet said to have been published
from a manuscript sent to Norway in 1838 by their father. An old
gentleman living close by the old homestead told them he had a copy,
which they secured and brought back with them to this country. This
copy has been in the possession of the Natesta brothers until last January
(1916) when it was turned over to me and I handed it over to the State
Historical Society.

In regard to the book, or pamphlet, it is to be stated
that while Ole Nattestad had learned to write, he was entirely
ignorant of Norwegian grammar. Both his orthography
and his syntax are very faulty. There are many subordinate
clauses with the principal clause left out. The surprising
thing is that the printers in Drammen did not make the necessary
corrections. I was requested to follow the original as
closely as possible, so as to convey to the reader of the translation
as complete a presentation of the original as possible.
The mistakes in orthography could only be reproduced in the
translation where they concerned proper names. The faults
in syntax I have generally reproduced. The reader will have
to be the judge of how well I have succeeded. The book is
of more than ordinary interest from the fact that it contains
a description of an emigrantâs journey from Norway to
Chicago in 1837, the only description we have of that kind,
and also from the fact that it is written by the first immigrant
from Norway who set foot on Wisconsin soil.

DESCRIPTION OF A JOURNEY TO NORTH AMERICA

By Ole Knudsen Nattestad

In the year 1837, the 8th of April, we started from our
homestead, the farm Nattestad, in Weglie-Parish, Rolloug
Parsonâs District, in Nummedal in Norway, for the purpose

Pg 168

of trying our fortune in another part of the world, namely in
the free states in North America. We journeyed with an
agreeable weather till in the evening of the 11th of the same
month. That day we came to the farm Flotyl, at the foot of
Storfjeldet (Big Mountain). In the morning the weather was
tolerably clear. We began to climb the mountain. When we
had gone some distance there began a strong storm with snow
and wind and it became so dark that we could not see the
least from us. As luck would have it, we found a path which
had been used with marsh shoes on the horsesâ feet over the
mountain, and this path we stuck to for the most part, so that
we, thanks be to God, made our way safely. We rested a
while at Jordbraek, then we went to Roarquam, where we expected
to stop over night. As soon as we entered the house
there came a man with a boat whose home was 1Â¾ miles [the
Norwegian mile is about seven English miles] farther out on
a farm by name Quildal. We were allowed to follow him
home without pay. There we stayed one day because Ansteen
became so weak in his eyes that he could not see to walk,
but after we left this place we, for the most part got transportation
to Stavanger. There we got trace of a man by name
Elias Tastad, with whom all who wanted to go to America
inscribed their names. To the above named E. Tastad we
arrived the 17th of April. The man named said that
âthey who desire to sail to America from Stavanger will
not get a ship before after
St.
Johnstide, and still it was not
certain what time it would be. But go to Tenager which lies
one mile west from here. There lie herring boats which go
to Gothenborg and see that you get passage with one of them,—that
is the best.â As we were informed we went to the
place mentioned and at once met a man from Kobbervigen, by
name Engebret Rise, from whom we got terms and whom we
were to go with. It was said that the above named person,
E. Tastad, was a Quaker, and he was a particularly kind-hearted
man and he gave us advice in many things. The 18th
of the same month we went on board and sailed to the harbor
Rekfjord; there we lay for 8 days, weather-bound. It is 8
miles north of Lindesnaes. From there we sailed the 28th of
the same month. When we came some distance out they had
neglected to take water on board. They, therefore, sailed in
to Kirkehavn to get water. In the evening when we came out

Pg 169

upon the sea again it was perfectly calm and the fog lay so
thick that we could not see a single thing. The calm continued
until in the afternoon, then we got a little breeze which increased
and came from the southeast until it grew into a perfect
storm so the waves washed entirely over the ship. That
night the storm drove us back to Kirkehavn again. There
we lay till the 3rd of May, then we sailed from there with a
pleasant wind and clear weather. That day all ships that
were there left the harbor, that before had to lie still. Then
there were swarms of ships as far as we could see out upon the
ocean. Oh, how delightful it was to look into this beautiful
weather. The same day we called in Mandal, 3 miles southeast
from Lindesnaes; after a few hours we sailed out from
there with the same wind and the next morning we got sight
of land at Skagen in Jylland (Scaw in Jutland) which is
30 miles from Mandal. The 5th of May we came to Gothenborg.
From New Elfsborgâs Fort Â½ mile outside of the city
came first an officer on board who countersigned our passports
and when we came to the custom house wharf the captain went
ashore to exhibit our passports there. Afterwards there came
officials on board who sealed the cargo of the ship and who
also talked with us about our proposed long journey. The
next day the captain went about in the city with us and went
to the office of Consul Vestberg, who procured passage for
passengers and who has information as to whither all ships
sail from there. Now, there lay a large ship ready to sail
which was loaded with iron which should go to America, and
one by name Vigen was the owner of it and one by name
Captain Ronneberg was to take it across. Vestberg went
at the same time with us to Vigen and talked with him for us.
He demanded 200 dollars Rigsgjelds [Swedish money].
That made about 54 speciedaler [Norwegian money].
Now, we were in distress because it was so awfully dear, but
our former carrier, named Engebret Rise, persuaded us that
we should not refuse it. âConsider,â said he, âthat you might
lie here a whole month and still perhaps have to pay almost
the same.â—We went to Vestberg again and asked if he
could not do it cheaper. âI will go with you up there,â said
he, âso you get to talk with him.â He went up and said that
we asked if he could do it cheaper. He stood a little while.
âFor 50 speciedaler I will do it and that is the very cheapest.

Pg 170

Then you will get on board what you need for sustenance.â
We accepted this and Engebret Rise said that we should
accept. Now, we had gotten transportation. We then went
on board after our baggage and E. Rise accompanied us
ashore again to a shoemaker of whom we bought a pair of
boots and shoes for each of us, and to one by name Fru
Bokkom who had all kinds of clothes for sale. There we
bought clothes. She asked if we had gotten lodgings. We
answered, âNo.â âFrom me you can get a room alone without
pay when you provide yourselves with food and wood
and fuel you shall have what you want to cook it with,â said
she. We accepted this offer with gratitude and there were
very comfortable. On Sunday we went into town and into
the Cathedral and heard sermons or mass and there were to
be seen many strange things besides the other things which
we saw in the city.—On Monday we went on the market to
buy us something of this and that. There stood one and
beckoned to us. He asked if we were from Norway. âPerhaps
you are going over to America,â said he, (and asked)
whether we had gotten transportation. We said, âYes!
We have gotten and we are to go with the ship belonging to
Vigenâ; âhow much are you then to pay?â When he got
to know this he became violently angry and denounced us as
big fools who had paid so much. Had we come to him he
would have saved us 20 speciedaler for each of us—this was
a Jew who stood and changed money and an awfully ugly
person to look at with black hair and beard and indescribably
thick and fat. Then he asked us if we had more money to
change than what we paid in transportation. Then we must
come to him. âYou cannot get your money changed anywhere
else than with me,â said he, and told us how high the
rate was; we would come to him the next day, we said. He
said we should go to Vigen and offer him 20 spd each if we
could get our money back; âbut you will still not get it back
for he well knows what he has done.â

We went to Vigen and said that we might have gotten
transportation almost 20 spd cheaper if we had waited a little
while. âYes!â said he, âif it is so that you regret what you
have done you shall get your money back again, that is the
kind of man I am and will not cheat you if you would rather
have the money back againâ; and then we thought the matter

Pg 171

over and let it be just as it had been done. We noticed something,
that the Jew wanted to talk to his own advantage.
Tuesday morning we were to come to Vestberg to get some
money changed. We came at the time appointed, he counted
the money and kept it. When he had done this he said we
should come back in the afternoon, he did not yet have the
kind of money, he first wanted to go out; we were very much
astonished at this, I went in again and told what I thought
of this, that we had delivered the money and gotten nothing
in return. âYou must not believe that we are that kind of
people,â and then he went away again—we went on the market
and there we discovered Vestberg talking with the Jew.
We stood looking at this and wondering if it was about our
money they were talking, which it also was. When Vestberg
went the Jew discovered us and came to us but it was the
brother of the one heretofore named. He then told us that
Vestberg asked him after the rate of exchange. âVestberg
would get you a note from Vigen that you are to get your
money in America, but this you must not do. Go with me
and you shall get your money changed.â We answered that
we did not have the money in our pockets, but we could come
back in a little while. At the time appointed we came into
Vestberg again and then the Jew stood inside and argued
with the clerk about the changing of our money and that
amused us. Then we plainly heard who was our friend, the
Jew or Vestberg. The Jew wanted us to exchange our money
and Vestberg did not want to give as high a rate as demanded;
he said, âif it is no more than a skilling [a penny] they are
to have it and now they will make 10Â½ skillings on every
spd when they get their money in America, for on the ocean
you need no money,â said Vestberg.

The Jew in his way with a well-nigh matchless eloquence
and who thereon was thundering mad at Vestberg because
he did not get his way, but it was of no help to him when we
learned of the Jewâs speculation for which he fought with us.
When the Jew did not succeed he had to go but he stood in
the door and scolded them as he also had done before. We
got a note each which was printed in the English language
which stated how much money we had and how high the exchange
rate was and how many piasters we were to have in
return; this note was from Vigen, the owner of the ship to

Pg 172

the Swedish Consul in America, from whom we were to get
the money and we got one (note) which was written and
which we were to retain when we delivered the others.

Wednesday morning we went aboard and after that we
lived there; Thursday, the 11th we sailed out of the harbor;
then there was on board the owner of the ship together with
many distinguished men who accompanied it a short distance;
when these had gone into the boat and gotten a little distance
from the ship there were fired 4 salvos with the big cannons.
Afterwards there was shouting of hurrahs, first by those in
the boats, afterwards by the shipâs crew. Off New Elfsborgâs
Fort, a half mile from the city 4 salvos were also fired and
2 in response by the fort; then we took our leave from the
city.

A little story about the ship by name
Hilda
, on which we
were passengers, the most beautiful ship in all Gothenborg,
and almost in all Sweden, it was said; it had made a single
journey to America before, otherwise it was new and with
copper bottom and it was upon the whole as if it were cast
(in a mold), it was furnished with 2 decks, a lower deck 3 ells
high to the ceiling which (the deck) was painted blue on the
sides and up under the upper deck yellow and likewise above
the deck and quarter deck 2Â½ ells high and very tight and
strongly made and blue painted; the upper part was upon
the whole constructed like a door of glass and painted with
yellow brass and the panels blue. Astern stood a cabin
on the deck which was polished both externally and internally
and also on the lower deck and in both of them as beautiful
furniture as can be made. In the front was placed works of
sculpture all gilt, likewise in the stern and a maiden carved
in wood in the most beautiful draperies and fineries that could
be found and as if she were a living being. From Elfsborg,
as heretofore mentioned, we sailed with a fair wind to the
day of Pentecost, then it became calm and we had reached
the FarÃ¶e Islands, which lie north of Scotland. The second
day of Pentecost there came one from Jutland and wanted
to go to the FarÃ¶es with 12 men and these came on board and
got some water; then we first heard English talked. From
there we sailed mostly with good wind but awhile before we
came to the New Foundland banks; we saw 5 icebergs (it

Pg 173

was pieces or lumps which drift south from the polar ocean),
the one was like a large building to look at. Sunday morning,
the 4th of June, came we to the banks, this morning there
were caught 62 pounds and 10 mkr of codfish. The above
named banks are a shallow 80 fathoms deep and a few hundred
miles in circumference, which lie about 300 miles from
America. There always lie ships which only fish. From
there we sailed with a favorable wind; the 11th of June in
the morning, 9 oâclock, we first saw land in America and were
therefore not more than 32 days from leaving until we came
to land. In the evening there came a pilot on board and at
12 oâclock we came into the city Nyport, where we lay at
anchor a little while. In the morning when I arose and came
upon the deck I saw something new; for the city and also
the country around about was delightful for me to see. At
12 oâclock we sailed from there up to Falreva [Fall River]
which lies 18 miles northeast from here. Here the ship
stopped and the cargo was here sold. On the journey from
Nyport to there was many agreeable things to see; the land
on both sides was so splendid and particularly the beautiful
trees which there here grows a multitude of. As soon as we
came to the above named Falreva there came a Norwegian
watchmaker apprentice on board who had gotten knowledge
of the fact that a Swedish boat had entered and he was from
Christiania; it was agreeable to get to talk with our fellow
countryman. He informed us concerning many things which
were useful to us.—Here in the city we have now gone about
and looked at many beautiful curiosities; especially in machine
shops and factories of which there here are a great
number; among other things we first inspected an iron factory,
very strange. What here was used as material was
nothing but burnt and rusty iron such as machine scraps,
boilers, stove pipes, and other scraps. This was first cut up
by a large iron knife which cut it into threads even if it was
2 inches thick. Afterwards it was smelted and cut into
strings. These strings were heated one time and with this it
went through some rollers 10 to 11 times and became hoop-iron
between 1 and 2 inches wide and 15 to 16 ells long and
over. These stringers were delivered to another building in
which there were 50 work benches. There was made nails of
these stringers. The nail was cut from the end of the

Pg 174

stringer and this went so fast almost as corn running
from a mill and was done by one man. These machines were
very strange and many things which I here on account of
time and space cannot describe.—The first mate on board
told us that he had never seen the equal although he had been
in many lands in Europe and in many cities in America.

He said we ought to go there and see, it would be interesting
for us; we did not dare to go because we did not know
the language and none of the shipâs crew had time to go with
us; but the first mate said we might go. âI think you will
be allowed to anyway,â and he told us what we should say
when we came there.—We went there and asked in English
if we could look over the factory; it was permitted. One
went with us from one room to another; it lasted fully 2 hours
and we did not see anything but new things wherever we came
so that for want of space am not able to describe how it was.
From the weaving factory the goods came there and the first
work there was to bleach it and that went fast, afterwards
it was made ready with flowers and colors as it was to be.
Yes, here were some ship-loads of cotton cloths with many
other things which were here which I cannot describe.—The
17th of May we went from Falreva on a steamboat to
Provedens, which is 30 miles. The captain went with us
to Provedens and got transportation to New York for us.
The steamboat we went from Provedens to New York on
was very large. It was certainly 100 ells long, with 2 engines
and so many strange appliances which I had never been able
to imagine before. There were 10 to 12 black negroes which
prepared the food and some carried it to and from the tables.
Ah! here was much to see for us. The room which we were
best able to examine was certainly of 30 ells length and two
dining tables which were loaded with dishes and drinking cups
as close together as possible and all of porcelain stoneware and
the glasses looked like crystal; but all who ate there I have not
the number of; on both sides in this room was bed after bed
[sofas]; curtains and sheets which we saw there were of the
choicest calico and some looked like silk. The carpets looked
like the finest camelâs hair cloth and many other things which
I cannot here describe.—This journey from Provedens to
New York was 230 miles and we were 12 hours on the way;

Pg 175

now we were among foreign nations and did not understand
their language the least. When we came to New York it
became worse as we had to go ashore; there came many who
talked to us but we didnât understand them and no more they
us; but I suppose they asked us where we were going; at
last there came one on board who talked to us; when he heard
that we did not understand he said that we should go with
him. I went with him, he went into a little store; there was
a French man who was to talk to me and asked if I was from
France; I said I was Norwegian. He went away from me.
Then there came one that so far as I could understand was
from the region near France. He asked me where I was
from, I answered from Norwegian, this he understood and
said, âthat is far awayâ; then I was to stop there while one
went out on the street; he soon came back again and had with
him a person who could talk a little Norwegian and would
come with me on board; when we got on the way he told me
that he was Swedish and Norwegian Consul. From the boat
we took our baggage and went with this man to a basement
which was a boarding house and there this consul had his
home and there we should stay and he should advise us and
get transportation to Rochester. When we came into the
city we saw a Norwegian flag on a ship and some Swedish
(flags); now my comrades went to see if they could find
these ships; they met first a Swede and afterwards a Norwegian
who was from Arendal and had come from England
with 140 passengers; when they had talked with these they
came to me again who was sitting inside and keeping watch
over the baggage, now went I and my brother out for I had
letters from our first mate which were addressed to a Swedish
ship which lay in the harbor there and was the same one which
they had been aboard and so I got the letters properly presented.
When we came to the Norwegian ship again there
came on board a shoemaker from Bergen who had come to
America a year before and had come with one from Christiansand
by name Jansen who was married and who was a
merchant; when we came to talk with them the merchant
said we should get lodgings at his home. We first went with
him to his house. He immediately went to the place where

Pg 176

we had our baggage; when we got there the house was so full
of people that we hardly could get in.

Jansen who was with us asked the host whether our baggage
might remain there until in the morning for it was so
near the river and this was permitted. In the morning,
namely Monday, Jansen went with us to secure transportation
to Rochester. A lieutenant from Gothenborg told me that
the year before he had talked with many Norwegians nor did
Jansen know where the Norwegians had located up through
the country, but he knew they had gone that way. Now we
went to the office and Jansen secured transportation for us
to the above Rochester, he then went with us to the house
where the baggage was and got it brought to the office about
5 oâclock in the afternoon, when the steamer was to leave;
afterwards he went with us to some money changers to get
our money changed into silver for the Swedish Consul from
whom we were to have our money in Falreva as above stated,
he cheated us a little; we should have had silver and got
nothing else than paper money and these we had to have
changed again for they would not be accepted up in the
country. I will state that there are many difficulties with
money here; there is an innumerable number of banks and
the money isnât passed more than in the bankâs district; some
of these (banks) are weak so that it is difficult to receive
money with which one is not acquainted; all paper passes for
the same as silver but people very much prefer silver. Jansen
and the other Norwegians we met frightened us very much
and said we must not go farther before we changed our
money to silver and so said Jansen went with us to get our
money changed. We came in to one and Jansen asked him
how much he took in percentage. He wanted 18 per cent
and Jansen said we should take silver. He changed 40 spd
in silver and the rest in pamper which I had to give 2 per cent
for and when we considered the matter all this was to no use
for there would be banks and exchange houses wherever we
happened to stop; but this I could not think of until it was
too late but Ansteen didnât change his money but it was Jansenâs
fault that I gave this money in exchange. We went to
another broker and asked him how much he wanted in exchange.
He said 12 per cent; then I found out how I had

Pg 177

exchanged my money, and for paper money he didnât take
any per cent. Ansteen exchanged his money for paper but
didnât take any silver.

Now I must write something about New York City, but
which is almost indescribable. Jansen went with us in many
streets to show us some of the splendid things in the city.
All the streets in which we walked were nothing but stores
right through the buildings, yes, so large that we could not
see the end of them and was packed as closely as possible with
all kinds of goods. Yes, likewise on the streets and buildings
were all kinds of clothing, besides drawings and pictures of
men, horses, and all kinds of animals in their full shape so
we did not know but that they were alive; and the buildings
were 5 and 6 stories high. But navigation was still more to
be looked at with all the ships that lay here which I guarantee
were in the thousands and an immense number so large that
the largest I have seen in Norway were almost like yachts in
comparison with these and they looked as if they were cast
in a mold. Likewise were steamboats of which there surely
were hundreds here and many which went only across the river
with passengers so that one could go to the wharf whenever
he pleased and there stood passage ready. In the city was
also a street which stood full the whole day with horses and
wagons only to be hired by anybody that wanted them. I will
also tell how it was with passage on the steamboat. Here
there is no question about getting passage but who ever wants
to can get his baggage and go on board and not speak to
anybody. This one can do no matter what country he is from;
for there is never a question about passports and the pay is
collected on board and tickets given until one goes ashore
which are then to be returned. Monday, the 19th of June,
5 oâclock in the afternoon, we went on board the steamboat
in New York for Albany which is 161 miles and arrived there
in the morning; there we did not understand a single person
nor did we meet anybody that we could talk with. When we
were to go ashore there we did not know where we were to go;
but we had a ticket from the office in New York that we were
to have free passage to Rochester, this we exhibited and were
instructed accordingly. There came a man with horse and
cart on which we were to place our baggage; he drove us to

Pg 178

an office and said we should stop until the office was opened
and then we should show our tickets, that we understood.
Soon the office was open and we went in with our tickets which
they took and kept and wrote one for us instead. I asked
the office man what time the boat would go again; but
although each one of us spoke his own tongue, I could understand
that it was not to go before in the afternoon. Now we
walked about in the city to see the sights and there we saw
many strange things; among other things we saw a great
tower which looked as if it were made of pure gold and we
saw the glitter of this tower out on the river before we came
to the city. We went to this tower to look at it; when we
came near to it we could see that it was plated with brass but
this must have been gilt otherwise it would fade. A somewhat
smaller tower glittered like silver plated with tin; likewise
I have in America in several cities seen many houses with
roofs of tin. Here we also were permitted to examine the
house where the steam cars are kept. From there we saw
that they drove the cars with horses and 2 cars for each horse
until they came some distance from the city where the
engine itself received them and which hauled 20 cars at a
time, even if all were filled with freight. This railroad went
over the Philadelphia but the length of it I do not know.—Now
I am going to report something that I have neglected,
namely: when we had come on board the steamboat in Provedens,
and just as we left the shore we saw an engine go from
the carhouse and draw 10 cars with it and all were filled with
people; this we stood on the deck and saw; it went to the
city of Boston.

In the afternoon we went on board on the canal boat here
in Albany. These boats are all the same size. They are
about 30 ells long and 5 ells wide with room for freight in
the center and a cabin in each end with costly curtains in the
windows and painted floor with carpets on; the other furniture
in the rooms were for the most part polished.

At the first start of the canal boat they pushed this forward
with poles a little ways up the locks, that is, a dam
which the boat went up; above the lock there was built a large
dam in which the boat was turned around and under a house.
Now one of the locks was closed and the water tapped off

Pg 179

so that the boat stood dry on some beams; there was an
arrangement whereby the boat was weighed with the cargo
in, excepting the people that went ashore; when this was
done the lock was opened and the boat floated and went back.
From there it was taken with 2 horses and hauled all the way
to Buffalo. With wonderment we looked at the works on
this canal especially the locks which were 85 in number and
between 5 and 6 ells high and all of cut marble, and a large
part of the finest white marble. Along the canal there is an
immense number of cities which are lately founded; but I
do not know the name of them because I did not understand
English. With wonderment we saw near a little town a
large steep hill which was covered with railroads for steam
cars. Yes, there went one railroad which could not escape
this hill and there for the first time we saw many cars hooked
together which came down the hill without both horses and
engines, that we could see; when they came down they were
taken with horses; likewise when the horses came to the hill
from below with the car many were hooked together and
went up the hill of their own accord.

Erik Hougen, from Thiin, stated that he took a ride on
a steam car from Albany, a distance upward which hauled
18 cars full of people; but when they came to such a hill he
said, the engine let go of them and the other cars went down
the hill by themselves; in the middle of the hill they met a car
with an awfully large load of stones which went up on the
other track. I did not see any engine that pulled but by the
side of the load was a big iron beam which went on cushions.
This was probably the machine. Perhaps this was in the same
hill on which we saw the cars go.

In Rochester we had heard it said that there were Norwegians
there; thither we came one morning early and went
ashore and looked about in the city. Ansteen now met a
man that had arrived a year before; this man was going to
work so he did not get to talk much with him; he directed
us to where we might meet one who had been there a few
years but him we did not meet. While we went there and
waited we met a man by a bridge who was from Faaloino in
Stavanger County and had come over the year before. He
told us where the Norwegians had located in the west, namely,

Pg 180

in the State of Illinois, which was over 1000 miles from
Buffalo. He told us that the Norwegians who had come to
Illinois had written to them how it was there, that a plain
laborer could get from 1 to 1Â½ dollars per day and afterwards
about the tradesmen, how much they could get according
to their kind; he said, âif you have so much money that
you can get there, you should not stop before you get there;
if I had so much money I would go tomorrow,â said he. He
went with us into a merchant he was acquainted with and
asked if our money was good enough; but he said that it
did not pass in Illinois and if they desired would exchange
it without any per cent. That was very good for there we
got Illinois money; yes, we got some silver too in place of
paper.—The above mentioned man told us that the canal was
damaged and that we must not make contract with the captain
farther than there for the time being. Now, we parted with
pleasure from this man and betook us on the journey to
Buffalo, which is 100 miles from Rochester.

When we came to the break in the canal referred to above
we got on to another boat; a lot of people came on board
which were from Bavaria in Germany, and some French;
there was certainly 100 of them and all were peasants; and
all their male persons had blue linen shirts outside of their
clothes with large pockets on them which hung outside and
many wore caps which fitted close to the head.—These people
all had to be in the freight room; but we were allowed to be
in the front room with some Scotchmen with whom we were
in company from Albany; these were mostly young people
of both sexes but very good-natured and jolly with singing
and other entertainment; we got so acquainted with these
as if we were the best friends at home, but we did not understand
each othersâ talk. When we came to Buffalo, which
is the end of the canal, we had to go from there on steamboat
to Detroit; from Buffalo the Scotchmen secured passage for
us just as for themselves but some of them parted with us
there.—In Buffalo we first saw Indians; that is, the original
Americans who live about like the Lapps in Norway and
subsist on hunting and without houses; but have tents which
they move from one place to another. Those we saw there
we could notice were women; we came first into a merchant

Pg 181

where one stood and talked with him; when she went out we
asked him what kind of a person that was; he answered it
was an Indian; but we did not yet understand what that
meant.—Their clothes consist of trousers on each hip which
extend from the upper part of the hip with a belt around the
waist and a strap from the trouser hips up to it besides a
shirt above which extends down to the hip, that is the underwear;
outside they have a sort of blanket which consists of
white, blue, and colored stripes which they hang over the
head and which reaches down on the legs and this they hold
around themselves with their hands; on their feet they have
shoes of skin which are fitted tight to the feet and no socks
but the women have the most beautiful etchings outside of
their trousers and some of them wear much of gold and silver
ornaments.

Now we went on the steamboat in company with these
Scotchmen in Buffalo which went to Detroit over the Erie
Lake which is a fresh water and which is so large that we could
not see land only on one side; but when we came to Detroit
we did not know where to go; but 2 carpenters of these Scotchmen
said that they were going to Schicago, the same place
as we were going to. We went with them to the boarding
house; I at once went out and down on the wharf to look
around; on the street I met one of the Norwegians who had
gone out from Bergen the 7th of April this year. When I
came to talk with him he related that there were about 80
persons in the company who were bound for Schicago and
they had been staying here for 5 days and had not got passage
but after 2 days they were to get passage. Now we
took leave of these Scotchmen and went to our fellow countrymen
with whom we have kept company from that time on.
In Detroit we had to pay 10 dollars apiece to Schicago, which
is 700 miles, which also was fresh water. On this steamboat
were such a great number of passengers that we could
hardly sit down. The sailors and others were so thievish that
we could scarcely keep our baggage; yes, a part of it they
took from us.

They went into a city to take wood (fuel), the name
of it I do not remember but there was a fort. Here we got
to see plenty of Indians; when we got ashore there was on

Pg 182

the pier a whole lot of Indians. Among them was one who
was said to be captain who was very grand in clothes and a
big silver ring in the nose, which was fastened to the middle
wing of the nose. In the ears there was a sheaf of silver
blocks and they had silk bands in the ears in which these
ornaments were hung; yes, many more had such things. One
had 3 tassels in the ear and 30 of the above blocks in each
tassel but there was only one with a ring in the nose. At
the knees they had wound pretty bands that were embroidered
with small beads and were very pretty and a whole tassel that
hung down to the foot which was embroidered with beads;
that is the costume of the menfolks. Some of the women
had gold rings on the fingers almost as many as they had
room for. On one we counted them and she had 44 gold
rings on her hands. Another had covered the breasts and over
the shoulder with smooth silver brooches as closely as possible.
Their complexion is for the most part soot-brown
or brown-black with broad faces, without beard and long
black hair. Some of them had painted themselves with red,
blue, and black stripes across the faces, which was to mean
that they would be manly in strife if anybody attacked them.
These people are very curious to look at, still they look fierce;
but they are said to be very good-natured and a separate
language they have. After we entered the city called Gronbay
(Green Bay), there were also some Indians. There lay a
garrison of warriors, which they said was to be for the Indians
if they should break in and make an attack. In this garrison
they wanted more men which they enlisted for 3 years and
would give 50 dollars in enlistment money and then 6 dollars
a month and free board and clothing and not much drill but
good learning do they get there. On a Sunday we came to
Schicago; when we came ashore there came Norwegians to
talk with us but the most of them talked unfavorably of the
condition there. Some of the Norwegians, especially the
women, let themselves be frightened; but when we had made
some investigation it was not true. Many got into great
distress when they heard that there was not free land to be
had. Yes, a Norwegian from Stavanger County had lately
been up in the country but could not hear of any, he said
and insisted that it was much worse than in Norway, but he
was a big talker and probably also a big liar.

Pg 183

When we had remained here in the city a couple of days
we learned that 50 miles south from here there was free land.
Now, it was resolved that some men should go there and
examine and the others should remain in the city and that
everyone that wanted land should help pay for this journey,
whereupon one was hired to take them with team. Those
that were chosen to go was Candidate Rynning, from
Sneaasen, near Tronhjem, 2 men from Bergenâs Stift and I.
When we came there we found that the land was poor but it
was resolved that we should remain there. Now, 2 men were
to stay to build a shanty to live in when the people got there
and the lot fell to me and one from Etne Sogn.—When the
people got there we got much abuse because the land was
not good but when we had hunted a few days all were satisfied
except those who never can be satisfied. The most of us
located near a creek which is called Baeverkrek (Beaver
Creek) and there we took a piece of land each and are now
very well contented therewith if we are able to keep it and
pay for it. Here the land is so free that whatever nation
that comes can locate without asking anybodyâs leave until
the land becomes sold and that is determined by the government;
but here there is much trading among people with free
land. Here we have now been 2 months and built a fine
house with rooms in and now we are going away to learn the
language and to get some work whereby we can earn money.
Halsteen Flose separated from us in Schicago and went in
company with several westward in Illinois to get work; we
soon got the report from them that they all got work and
earned 1Â½ dollars a day besides free keep.—On our journey
we have been in intercourse with people almost from all
European lands, yes, original Americans and negroes. I
have heard that these people have many different religious
sects but one cannot see any great difference in their manner
of living for they are polite and friendly toward each other.
But among the people which I have seen that from the first I
saw them seemed to be so horrible; they are the black negroes
with wool-curly hair and I had no desire to look at them. But
when I now for some time had been in intercourse with them
I thought they were the most lovable and jolly people I ever
have seen; wherever I see them they are all equally jolly,

Pg 184

good-natured and polite, so that I do not think anybody equal
to them in manners. The Indians on the other hand are the
most horrible people I have seen.

Among other stories I will also report that first mate
Malgren from Gothenborg told me of some curious things
which he had seen in Philadelphia. There was namely a
fountain which was built and taken out 6 English miles
above the city and there it was pumped 600 feet high from
the river which was done with an engine so light that one man
could operate it up to 2 large dams which contained an immense
quantity of water. From there it went in iron pipes
down to the city where it was distributed in all streets so
that they had spring water nearly in every house; yes, it went
up in the 4th and 5th stories in the houses. At all corners
and single streets there were large fountains and hydrants
where they put on the water hose when fire breaks out in the
city. There are certainly 60 of that kind of hose which were
of bright brass as well polished that one could hardly look at
them on account of the brilliancy. He said they were indescribably
good and that they never could burn more than one
house, no matter how fierce the fire had broke out for these
hose struck nearly through the houses, such force had they.

The above mentioned canal, namely from Albany to
Buffalo, I have now gotten knowledge of that it was first
planned and begun to be worked on in the year 1817 and in
1827 it was ready to be traveled on in a distance of 60 Norwegian
miles and cost 9 millions.

In the year 1836 work was begun on a canal which is to
go from Schicago to the Mississippi River and which will be
150 miles, that is 26 Norwegian miles. When this is finished
one will be able to go by water from New York to New
Orleans which is 3500 English miles, whereby one passes,
rivers, canals, and fresh water. Likewise there are built tracks
for steam cars from Philadelphia nearly to Schicago. Next
summer there is to be built a railroad which is to go from the
one that comes from Philadelphia to Vaabais [Wabash], a
river which empties into the Mississippi and of this railway
it is said that it shall go across the Mississippi and clear across
America even to the Pacific Ocean. Here we may see there
are good institutions and as land becomes settled it becomes

Pg 185

supplied with canals and railroads everywhere, so that like a
bird one can travel both by land and by water.

In regard to religious sects there are great diversity and
I have as yet but little understanding of their teachings;
but so far as I understand they nearly all believe in one single,
true God, and it looks as if the government took much interest
in a good religion. I have examined many school books and
so far as I understand, the principles are the same as in Norway.
There have been inserted in the newspapers many
examples as warnings for the people that they ought to live
righteously and pleasing to God. Yes, also in the almanac
these things are inserted, yes, and everywhere are many warnings
in regard to drunkenness and it is the greatest foolishness
that a man does to drink liquor, which it certainly also
is. In Norway people are urged and forced to drink liquor
but so it is not here, for here the people are induced by warnings
to moderation; and when a man accepts these warnings
and reports it to his friends who also will be the same, namely
never either drink or treat liquor, and thereby can many and
large societies be freed from this vice.

A short story of the formation of the country.

When one goes from New York up through the country,
it is a perfectly dry, stony field, but quite well wooded and
the soil becomes better and better and everywhere fruitful.
In the State of New York it is quite mountainous in some
places but in the State of Michigan it is flat and level, besides
wooded everywhere until one reaches the State of Illinois.
Here the land looks like the ocean after a storm when the
huge billows are rolling. Here there is timber enough some
places, as along rivers and other places; other places timber
stands in thick groves where people have settled. For the
rest there are only rolling plains which are called prairies
and these are everywhere overgrown with grass and are
for the most part as the best cultivated farms in Norway.
These prairies one can plow and seed with what you
please which there grows abundantly without being fertilized.
Here the best timber land has been taken, but it pays well
to till the soil here, that I can see. The man that I now have
been with and worked for, has 160 acres land fenced in and
from this piece certainly has a crop for over 3000 dollars,
although certainly 40 acres are not seeded; they have little

Pg 186

work with planting. 160 acres costs 200 dollars to buy but
it costs more to get it fenced in. The size of one acre is 208
feet on each side.

Mr. Bekvald, the man I have been with this winter, told
me that if one goes from east to west one always has the
best land before him. Hitherto the people have moved east,
namely to here; but now they are moving from here more
and more to the west where it is also said to be better, although
here it looks like being the best land that anyone can desire;
but I also have in my mind to go more to the west to look
for land.

I will also relate that I have been with a man and worked
this winter from the 14th of October to the present day and
I have earned 50 dollars in a period of 4 months, in spite of
the fact that I did not know the language the least when
I came there. Some said to me that I did work for 20 dollars
a month. I have done heavy work and the same man has
offered me 190 dollars for a year and the best keep that any
official can get in Norway. It is my opinion that everyone
who has his youth and is unmarried certainly can make up his
mind in regard to the journey; but one must consider that he
is leaving his home and his relatives and friends. I have heard
many, especially among the women, say that if they have ever
so good days, they are homesick for Norway. Everyone that
starts on the journey must consider that one must first taste
sour before he can drink sweet. It is difficult here when one
does not understand the language and it is worse when he is
unable to work.

I will also report how big dayâs wages the workingman
gets here. A laborer can get from 12 to 16 dollars a month
in the winter and in the summer nearly the double. The
price is some places more and some places less. A girl can
get from 1 to 2 dollars a week as soon as they have some
knowledge of the language.

Baeverkrek in Illinois, the 21st of February, 1838.

Ole Knudsen Nattestad.

Postscript: More have I not time to write this time; but this
description of travel I send home to you, my relatives and
friends! if you have desire to read herein about what I on
my long journey have experienced and seen since I was at
home with you.

EDITORIALS

HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF

Every twenty-five years, on the average, the American
nation has waged war with an important civilized power.
Again, as on previous occasions we find ourselves involved
in a great struggle, on the outcome of which our existence as
an independent nation probably depends, with practically
no preparation having been made in advance to meet the
issue. Not to go further back than 1914, for three years the
nation gamboled on the brink of war, making practically no
effort to prepare for the struggle the imminence of which
was apparent to every reasoning person. As we write these
lines the daily paper brings to our desk a story from the
Secretary of War, intended to be thrilling, of how, after war
was declared, an airplane engine was devised for adoption
by our government. America was the original home of the
aeroplane, yet we began the present war as little equipped,
to all practical purposes, to wage it in the air as were our
forefathers of 1776.

This is but typical of our situation as a whole. When
war was declared we had ample potential resources in men,
material, and initiative, but we had no army and only an
inadequate navy; and while these are being evolved at a prodigious
expenditure of labor and money, the enemy is kept
from our gates by virtue of no foresight of ours, but rather
by the good fortune which has given us powerful allies whose
armies and navies are fighting in our behalf.

OUR MILITARY RECORD

Thus has it ever been when America went to war. The
pages of our history teem with disasters for which our happy-go-lucky
attitude toward all things military is responsible.
Curiously enough, in the very face of such a record, flourishes

Pg 188

a popular conviction that the history of our warfare is one of
triumph succeeding triumph with monotonous regularity;
and that with respect to our armies, if in no other thing,
America has far excelled the other peoples of the earth. That
this is all a ghastly illusion any one who has access to a
respectable library can quickly satisfy himself. The simple
truth is that our past military record has been far from
extraordinary; that Americans considered as individuals are
no braver than other people; and that when these individuals
are associated in armies they require much the same degree
of organization, equipment, and leadership as other armies
do, if the record they make is to constitute pleasant reading
for the nation that sends them forth to war.

It behooves us to note in this connection that no other
type of human activity calls for so high a degree of organization
and discipline as does the waging of civilized war; and
further, that as a consequence of the industrial development
of the last century the handicap of a nation which is unprepared
to defend itself, in a contest with one which has thus
prepared, is vastly greater than ever before. The ancient
Gauls and Germans were able to wage a respectable fight
against so mighty a military machine as the legions of Julius
Caesar, and on one notable occasion, a few years later, a great
imperial army was utterly destroyed by the forest barbarians.
In modern times the small armies of England have marched
at will over Africa, and the fanatic bravery of the tribesmen
has led to no other result than their more certain and speedy
slaughter at the hands of their civilized foemen. Returning
to our own history, the American militiaman of Revolutionary
days was no match for the British regular; and,
popular belief to the contrary, the naval War of 1812 was not
won by America. Even were the contrary the case, however,
it would avail us nothing at the present time, for the
art of warfare and the circumstances of human life have alike
undergone a complete revolution during the last hundred
years. Mr. Bryanâs fanciful vision of a million men springing
to arms at the first note of danger is but an empty myth,
but unfortunately it is by no means a harmless one. The
nation which neglects to set its defenses in order in advance
of the emergency is, under modern conditions, doomed to
defeat before war shall have been declared.

Pg 189

WHAT OF THE FUTURE?

But what avail, it may be asked, is it to dwell upon our
past military mistakes? None, certainly, unless we are capable
as a people of profiting by the school of experience. Thus
far, in the matter under discussion, our national good luck,
inducing, as it has done, a quite unwarranted feeling of
security, has prevented us from doing so. That we are
permanently incapacitated from guiding our feet by the
lamp of experience, however, the writer at least does not
believe. To a limited extent, indeed, in the conduct of the
present war, we have already evinced a willingness to avoid
repeating our past mistakes. The question of preparation
in advance of the conflict aside, the preliminary stage of the
current war has been waged in materially better fashion than
has that of any of our previous wars. In particular the
principle of universal liability to service has been adopted and
an earnest effort has been made to provide as officers, men
who combine with a high degree of natural capacity at least
a modicum of training for the work intrusted to their charge.

These things are well enough in their way, and encouraging
as indicative of the development of a more intelligent
attitude on the part of our people toward the conduct of the
military arm of the government. No longer, apparently,
can a runaway boy of sixteen convince a secretary of war,
as in the old days, that his desire for a commission in the army
entitles him to precedence over graduates of West Point;
nor will we again witness the spectacle of our president appointing
all the officers of a newly-created military unit direct
from civil life on the ground that the country âgenerally
expectedâ our trained soldiers should thus be ignored. However
gratifying this may be, the nub of the present situation
lies in the fact that whatever has been done thus far has been
with a view solely to meeting a present emergency. The
country has not determined upon, and the government has
not adopted any permanent or general policy. Sooner or

Pg 190

later the present war will end. Shall we then, as in 1815 and
1865, disband our military force and have recourse once more
to the old policy of trusting to Providence for the protection
of our liberty and our existence as a nation? Or shall we now
highly resolve that the destinies of the American people are
too precious, that the success of our great experiment in
democracy is charged with too much importance, not alone to
ourselves but to the remainder of mankind as well, to justify
us in leaving it absolutely unprotected in a world of potential
enemies? What would be thought today of a city which
should maintain no police department, and for protection
against fire should depend upon the unorganized efforts of
volunteers? Scarcely two centuries ago, however, even the
chief city of the world had no police department, while
within the memory of men now living our cities depended
upon volunteers for protection against fire.

In these matters the obvious lesson of experience has been
thoroughly learned. Professional police and fire departments
are the standing armies of our cities, highly organized and
constantly alert to protect them from the perils of disorder
and fire. The American people will not permanently be
content to display a lower order of intelligence in national
affairs than it does in those of merely municipal concern.
Too long, however, have we confided the protection of our
national existence to Providence. We believe it to be the
duty of every citizen to exert the full measure of his influence
upon his governmental representatives to the end that now,
before national disaster shall have overtaken us, a permanent
military policy adequate to our protection be adopted.

AN APPRECIATION AND A SUGGESTION

The September number of the
Magazine
contained news
of the bequest to the Society by Miss Genevieve Mills of
Madison of her interest in the parental homestead. We
return to the subject now for a twofold reason. In the first

Pg 191

place it is proper to render adequate formal acknowledgment
of the fine gift made by Miss Mills to the Society. Of
vain or ill-advised memorials to the departed, America affords
numerous examples; the wisdom and appropriateness of Miss
Millsâs memorial to her parents appears, by contrast with some
of these, all the more obvious. Money which might have
gone to the building of a useless pile of granite has been
devoted to the perpetual enrichment of the commonwealth,
to the upbuilding of which Simeon and Maria Mills dedicated
their lives. To illustrate concretely the work which the
Mills bequest will perform, the annual income from the estimated
value of the estate will suffice to pay the entire cost
of publication of this magazine; or it will print annually such
a volume as those included in the
Collections
of the Society.
If the cost of authorship as well as printing be charged
against the fund, it will suffice to produce a volume of our

Collections
every two or three years. And this work, without
exhausting the principal of the fund, is to go on perpetually.

If the present world war has taught any lesson, it is that
of the value to a nation of its civic and patriotic ideals. But
these cannot be cultivated unless due regard be paid to the
preservation and study of the countryâs historical records.
Thus Miss Millsâs bequest constitutes a permanent factor
making for the development of patriotism in our commonwealth.
Well would it be if all givers of funds for a public
purpose should display equal wisdom. At the present time,
we understand, the Norwegians of Wisconsin are contemplating
the erection of an expensive memorial to Colonel Heg
of the Fifteenth Wisconsin Infantry, the famed Norwegian
regiment. That Colonel Heg richly deserves a suitable memorial
no one will be disposed to dispute. The establishment
of a perpetual fund, the income of which should be devoted
to the study of the Norwegian contribution to Wisconsin and
American history, would constitute, we respectfully suggest,
a more useful and suitable memorial to Colonel Heg than any
bronze or granite pile, however costly it may be.

Pg 192

CANNON FODDER

He slipped into the office with a quiet apology for the
intrusion, to say that he had enlisted in the naval reserve.
Not expecting to be called for a month or more, the call to
service had come immediately. His only concern over this
was due to the fact that he must leave the Library on such
short notice, and he was distressed to think that his leaving
thus might inconvenience those who remained behind. Two
years ago he had entered our employ, in the hope that proximity
to the University would render it possible, while earning
his living, to take part-time work on the hill. So thorough
was his industry that before long, aside from his full-time
employment (with service faithfully rendered), he was carrying
two-thirds of normal undergraduate work. How he carried
it is indicated by the fact that, though preparing himself
for an engineer, he was prevented from winning the annual
prize for excellence in English composition only by virtue
of the limitation of the award to students doing full-time
work.

Thus the Library lost a faithful worker; thus the nation
gained an excellent soldier. Of such stuff are the men of our
new army made. Unless we mistake greatly, the German
nation will live to rue the course by which its government
goaded the American people to the point of taking active
part in settling the great question whether autocracy or
democracy shall perish. Quietly and without heroics our
splendid youth have appraised the situation, and having
appraised it, with a smile have offered themselves and their
hopeful futures upon the altar of human freedom, only
regretting as did our particular hero, the inconvenience to
others which their sacrifice may involve. We will not offend
his modesty by placing his name in type. To him and all
his kind we offer a reverent Godspeed. The nobility of their
offering is inspiring enough; that it should have been necessary
in the full light of the twentieth century is one of the
ghastliest facts in human history.

THE QUESTION BOX

The Wisconsin Historical Library has long maintained a
bureau of historical information for the benefit of those who
care to avail themselves of the service it offers. In âThe Question Boxâ will be printed from time to time such queries,
with the answers made to them, as possess sufficient general
interest to render their publication worth while.

DANIEL WEBSTERâS WISCONSIN INVESTMENTS

I have received the
Wisconsin History Bulletin
[95]
for August. It
would be interesting to know just how much money Daniel Webster
gave for lots in Madison, for lands throughout this state and Iowa,
for capital stock in the railway company from LaFontaine and what
the evidence of such payment is. Not that I am disposed to charge
the godlike Daniel with graft, at least no more than his associates
and compeers were chargeable with at that period.

W. A. P. Morris,

Madison, Wisconsin.

So far as we can ascertain, Websterâs investments, or speculations,
in Wisconsin property were perfectly legitimate and not
influenced by political considerations. In his own account thereof,
after saying that he wished to resign, and was not permitted to do so,
he says: âSo,
seeiâg
, then, that I must do something with a view to
future means of
livâg
I entered on
Western investments
, partly in
company with
Col.
Perkins, partly in a company of which
Gov.
Cass
was Chief, and partly on my own account. These investments were
made by faithful & careful agents, principally in agricultural lands
of excellent quality, in Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, & Wisconsin.
Prospects of profit seemed fair, at the time, & I purchased as far as
means & credit would go.â

George Wallace Jones, in his
Autobiography
, tells of walking
along a street in Washington soon lafter the erection of Wisconsin
Territory, of which he was congressional delegate. Webster overtook

Pg 194

him, invited him to his house, and entered into conversation
with him on the subject of investments. Jones became one of Websterâs
agents. In cooperation with Webster he made about $20,000
and Webster sold his holdings to the United States bank of Philadelphia
for $50,000. Jones states that Webster owed him $15,000
when he died, but as he had made a good thing by him, he never
pressed the debt.

With regard to the Madison investment, the amount should be
$3,000 and not $5,000 (this was a typographical error). In the
biography of Jones is a reference to a letter dated December 24,
1836 from Judge Doty speaking of the association of proprietors
for Madison and stating that these were twenty-four in number,
each of whom paid in $100. By February, 1837, the dividends on the
sales were $170 a share. On the strength of this showing, Jones
sold his share to Webster for âabout $3,000.â

The only thing that looks like political influence is in connection
with the entries of mineral lands in southwestern Wisconsin. Moses
M. Strong, whose papers are in the Societyâs possession, came to
Wisconsin in 1836 as the agent of Hon. Henry Hubbard, United
States senator from New Hampshire, and made large investments
for him and some of his friends. Part of the entries made by Strong
for Hubbard were upon reserved mineral lands, which were not open
to general entry, but were leased by the government. Hubbard tried
to get some decision, the precise nature of which is not evident, from
the United States land commissioner, concerning these mineral lands,
and in the course of his correspondence with Strong he mentions
Websterâs name, and says he will see the commissioner. There is no
evidence that this was in any way an improper proceeding or influence.

As George W. Jones was Websterâs agent in southwestern
Wisconsin, Morgan L. Martin seems to have been his agent in the
eastern part of the state. In the early part of 1837 Martin went
east to be married and incidentally arranged what business he
could. In New York he met Webster and interested him in the
lands along Fox River and upon Lake Winnebago, describing the
projected railroad from La Fontaine, a âpaperâ city on Fox River,
to Winnebago City, another of like importance on the northeastern
shore of Lake Winnebago. This railroad, if built, would have been

Pg 195

thirteen miles in length, and was planned to transport freight around
the Winnebago Rapids at what is now Neenah. This La Fontaine
Railroad Company was the first in the Territory to secure a charter,
which was granted by the legislature at Belmont, December 3, 1836.
Martin succeeded in firing the imagination of Webster by his
description of the importance of the Fox-Wisconsin waterway, and
March 24, 1837, Webster wrote him from New York to invest $5,000
in the stock of the railroad (Wisconsin
Mss.
5C83). June 28, 1837
Martin replied (
Ibid
, 110) saying that the capital stock was $50,000
âof which we do not think it necessary to call in over one-half. Doty
took 20. I put you down for 10 & took the balance myself. I conceived
you would prefer that amount since it would only require
to be paid the sum for which you authorize me to draw on you.â
Martin goes on to discuss the liberal terms of the charter, which they
were planning to have amended by still more liberal provisions at
the next legislature. He discusses land grants along the right of
way. The engineer they expect has not yet arrived. He closes with
a cordial invitation to Webster to visit Green Bay and be his guest.

The negotiation seems to have ended at this point. The panic
of 1837 came on and Martin was badly hampered by his connections
with the bank of Green Bay and by his large speculative enterprises.
No action was ever taken on the railway charter, and in all probability
Webster was never called upon for his subscription to the
companyâs stock.

NAMES PROPOSED FOR A NEW TOWN

We would appreciate it if you would let us know where we can
get some information relative to the early history of Wisconsin,
especially that part of the state through which the Chippewa River
flows. We would like to get the names of some early explorers and
Indian chiefs that make a part of the history of Sawyer County.
Or, could you give us a number of names that you think would be
typical of the region referred to that would make a good name for
a small village?

Wisconsin Colonization Company,

Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

We have looked somewhat into the matter suggested in your
letter of May 17 and have the following suggestions to make in
connection with it.

Pg 196

First, since Sawyer County is drained by the Chippewa River,
and since the first person of the English race who is known to have
visited that region was the famous traveler, Jonathan Carver, the
name Carver would seem to be an appropriate one for the village you
have in mind.

Second, the first resident fur traders of Sawyer County were the
Warren brothers and John Baptiste Corbin. Either Warren or
Corbin would seem to us to make a good name for the town. Either
name would also be easy to spell and sufficiently euphonious.

Third, if an Indian name is desired, the first important Chippewa
chief of this region was Sha-da-wish. Among his descendants were
Ka-ka-ke, Labudee, Mon-so-ne, and Ke-dug-a-be-shew. The last two
names mentioned mean respectively moose tail and spotted lynx.

ORIGIN OF THE WORD âWINNEQUAHâ

Can you give me any information concerning the origin and
historical significance of the name âWinnequah,â applied to the point
projecting into Lake Monona?

Frederick Brandenburg,

Madison, Wisconsin.

The site of Winnequah was originally known as Strawberry Point,
Squaw Point, Old Indian Garden, and Woodâs Point. It was the
village home for the Lake Monona Winnebago, and when Madison
was first built it was occupied by Abraham Wood, who had a Winnebago
chiefâs daughter for his squaw. She was one of the illustrious
family of Decorah, and her father was chief of the band in the vicinity
of Portage. In 1835 William B. Long and Abraham Wood entered
the fifty-two acres of the point in the Mineral Point land office, and
three years later, March 24, 1838, transferred their interest to
Col.

William B. Slaughter. After this transaction Wood moved to Poynette.
Slaughter kept the land as an investment. Thomas B. Sutherland,
one of the founders of the State Historical Society, was wont
to relate his experiences as surveyor in 1835 when he spent some time
at the Indian village at Strawberry Point. The name âWinnequahâ
was bestowed upon the point some time in the late sixties by
Capt.

Francis (Frank) Barnes who ran a steamboat line on Lake Monona.
Barnes had a fancy for odd names; one of his boats was named the
âScutanaubequon.â He built a dancing hall on the point and fitted

Pg 197

it up for picnic parties and seems to have invented the word âWinnequah.â
At least, its meaning is not to be found among the Winnebago
vocabularies, nor is it susceptible of any interpretation except that
it is made up of Winnebago Squaw Point. Barnes carried on his
steamboat line from 1866 to 1873 or 1874, perhaps later. The Madison
directory for 1877-78 lists him as âcaptain of tug.â The owner
of Strawberry Point—to revert to its first name—from 1868 or
earlier was N. W. Dean. He seems to have rented or leased the land
to Barnes for his picnic grounds.

THE DISCOVERY OF LAKE SUPERIOR

In Volume Seven of the
American Nation
Mr. Thwaites states
(page 52) that Lake Superior was discovered in 1616. All other
secondary accounts give 1629. Can you tell me whether or not the
date 1616 is a misprint? If not where can I get the information
about its discovery?

E. G. Doudna,

Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

The dates of the discoveries of the several great lakes are not
definitely known, and there is no uniformity of statement concerning
their first exploration. Dr. Thwaitesâs works reflect this uncertainty.
In the
American Nation
volume to which you refer he was inclined to
accept the theory of Etienne BrulÃ©âs exploration of Lake Superior,
and thought it might have occurred after his journey to the Susquehanna
in 1615, and before his return in 1618 to Quebec. Therefore he
gives the date as 1616. In his
Wisconsin
, published in 1908, he appears
to have rejected the theory of BrulÃ©âs explorations, and states that
Jean Nicolet in 1634 was probably the discoverer of Lake Superior.
In his school
History of the United States
(Boston, 1912) he shows
his doubt by giving âabout 1629â as the date of the discovery. Not
all secondary accounts give the date as 1629. Our own opinion is
that there is no authority for this date, and that it arises from a misinterpretation
of Edward J. Neillâs statement in Justin Winsorâs

Narrative and Critical History of America
,
IV
, 165. One of the
latest histories of the Great Lakes (Channing and Lansingâs
The Story
of the Great Lakes
, New York, 1909) gives no date for the discovery
of Lake Superior, but assigns 1610 to the first white manâs voyage on
Lake Huron, five years earlier than the traditional one of 1615 for

Pg 198

Champlainâs first voyage. The whole matter turns on the career of
Etienne BrulÃ©, one of the youths selected by Champlain to reside
among the Indians and learn their language. His adventures were
first discussed in detail in C. W. Butterfieldâs,
BrulÃ©âs Explorations
and Discoveries
(Cleveland, 1898). A more recent discussion in
French, by the eminent Canadian authority Benjamin Sulte, appeared
in the Canadian Royal Society
Proceedings and Transactions
,

3d.
series,
vol.
1, section 1, 97-125. Butterfield and Sulte substantially
agree, and both consider that Etienne BrulÃ© with a companion
named Grenolle probably visited Lake Superior and explored it in
1622-23. The evidence is somewhat circumstantial, and the point
may never be determined; but Champlain must have had some information,
aside from that furnished by the Indians, for upon his
map of 1632 appears the outline of Lake Superior entering Lake
Huron by the âSault de Gaston,â as he calls the present Sault Ste.
Marie. If one rejects the evidence of BrulÃ©âs voyage, which rests
upon inference chiefly, the date 1629 is the last one in which Champlain
could have obtained his information for his map published in
1632, since he was deported by English conquerors from his colony
in the former year, and did not return until 1633.

Next to BrulÃ© must be placed Jean Nicolet, who visited the Sault
in 1634; whether he ascended the strait to the lake itself is conjectural.
Then in 1641 came the great gathering of Indians attended
by the Jesuit fathers, Jogues and Raymbault. (See L. P. Kelloggâs

Early Narratives of the Northwest
, New York, 1917, 19-25). The
first description of Lake Superior is given by Pierre Esprit Radisson
in his
Journal
. The probable date of his voyage thereon is 1661,
but Father RenÃ© MÃ©nard arrived at Keweenaw Bay in the autumn of
1660.

It appears probable that the date of the discovery of Lake
Superior cannot be determined with accuracy, and must remain uncertain
unless scholars accept the conclusions of Butterfield and
Sulte concerning BrulÃ©. The same is true of the discovery of the
upper Mississippi; it has been claimed for Nicolet in 1634, for Radisson
in 1659, for La Salle in 1669, all antedating the voyage of
Jolliet and Marquette in 1673. The truth is that from the beginning
of French settlement on the
St.
Lawrence there was much roving

Pg 199

to the sources of the great river. Many of these coureurs des bois
were brave and courageous explorers, but they kept no records. It
is thus dogmatic to say that the visit of the first white man to any
given point occurred on such or such a date. We can only say when
the first records were made describing such an event. The records
for the voyage of BrulÃ© and Grenolle in 1622 have not yet been
universally accepted.

THE POTAWATOMI DURING THE REVOLUTION: FATHER ALLOUEZ AMONG THE KICKAPOO

I am sending you some more letters from Quitos. In one of
these letters he refers to War Chief Thunder fighting with George
Washington against the Canadians. I would like to find out what
fight that was. Can you tell me?

I would also like to find out whether Fathers Dablon and Claude
Allouez visited the Kickapoo Indians on Milwaukee River in 1670 a
few years before Jolliet and Marquette discovered the Mississippi.
I have seen something to this effect somewhere.

A. Gerend,

Cato, Wisconsin.

It is an interesting fact that the Potawatomi of the west shore
of Lake Michigan, notably those of Milwaukee, and probably those
farther north, under the influence of Siggenauk or the Blackbird
made a treaty at Cahokia, Illinois, with George Rogers Clark in
September, 1778, and were thereafter for a time American allies.
There was no actual service under
Gen.
George Washington, but
the chiefs probably received medals or certificates in his name, and
thus considered themselves fighting under his care. The Potawatomi
returned to the British allegiance later, and opposed the Americans
during all of the Indian wars. If our surmise of what Quitos means
about Old Thunder is correct, it is a remarkable instance of the
persistence of tradition concerning an American alliance, and a corroboration
of
Col.
George Rogers Clarkâs testimony about the
attitude of the Milwaukee Potawatomi. Clark calls the two chiefs
Saguina or âMr. Black Bird and Nakiowin, two chiefs of the Bands
of the sotairs [Chippewa] and Outaway Nation bordering on Lake
Michigan and the River
St.
Joseph.â De Peyster, the British commandant
at Mackinac, speaks in his poem or rhymed chronicle of

Pg 200

1779 of âThose runagates at Milwakieâ and calls them in a footnote
âA horrid set of refractory Indians.â Thus in the Revolution,
while most of the Wisconsin Indians were strong British supporters,
the mixed band of Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi west of Lake
Michigan were American sympathizers.

With regard to your second question: There is no record in
the
Jesuit Relations
of any visit of Allouez and Dablon to Milwaukee
in 1670. Such a statement was made before Dr. Thwaitesâs
edition of the
Jesuit Relations
appeared. Upon the publication in
English of the exact text of the
Relations
it was seen that Allouez
visited the Kickapoo in 1670 (not accompanied by Dablon) at their
village four leagues (about fifteen miles) from the Mascouten village
which was near the site of the modern Berlin, on the upper Fox
River. Thus it was impossible for the Kickapoo village to have
been at Milwaukee. It is quite probable that Perrot and other traders
may have been at Milwaukee and along the shore of Lake Michigan
before Jolliet and Marquette, but there is no recorded voyage
before theirs.

THE INDIAN TRIBES OF IOWA

Please send me the name and history of any or all the Indian
tribes that at first occupied the state of Iowa. Also give me the name
and history of any Indian tribe that once lived for a time, either long
or short, in Iowa.

Daniel McKenna,

Charles City, Iowa.

The Indian tribes who are known to have dwelt in Iowa since
historic times are the following:

The Illinois were found there by Marquette and Jolliet in 1673,
but returned to the east side of the Mississippi in a few years.

The Iowa (name spelled in a great variety of ways, as Aiouais,
Aoyest, Ayoes, Ayouez) were a Siouan or a Dakotan tribe found on
the Des Moines River about the close of the seventeenth century.

The Sioux, whose eastern and southern branches extended into
northern Iowa, where they were known to the whites in the late
seventeenth century. The Kickapoo and Mascouten, allied tribes,
driven from Wisconsin into Iowa about 1728. The Kickapoo soon
removed; a few of the Mascouten lingered and gave their name to
Muscatine.

Pg 201

The Sauk and Foxes, who after their defeat in Wisconsin in
1733 became allied tribes, and made their home thereafter chiefly
in Iowa. Their villages in 1805 were along the Mississippi from Des
Moines Rapids to Turkey River. By a treaty of 1842 they were
to remove from Iowa; many came back and wandered on the Iowa
and Des Moines rivers until they purchased lands in Tama County
where they still dwell, now called the Musquakie or Meskwaki Indians.

The Winnebago who removed from Wisconsin after the treaty
of 1837 to northeastern Iowa where they had a school and agency
on Yellow River. In 1848 they were removed to Minnesota. The
Omaha or Maha Indians lived in northwestern Iowa when Lewis
and Clark ascended the Missouri in 1804. In 1830 they ceded their
lands to the United States which in 1833 ceded a portion to the
allied Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi tribes. Most of those who
lived on this reservation from about 1835 to 1846 were Potawatomi.

For further history of these tribes apply to the Iowa Department
of History at Des Moines, Edgar R. Harlan, curator.

COMMUNICATIONS

OLD COPPERHEADS AND NEW

The editorial in the September number of the
Wisconsin Magazine
of History
entitled âConsolation for the Present Crisis,â has
prompted me to enlarge upon one of its themes. Those of our citizens
who feel disturbed by the presence among us of an anti-war
element may find encouragement in a further recital of the doings
of the anti-war advocates in Wisconsin half a century ago.

Shortly after the firing on Fort Sumter, when the North was
roused to the utmost pitch of excitement, the democratic members
of the legislature together with certain citizens of Madison, arranged
for a peace mass meeting in the assembly chamber for the
purpose of devising some compromise which should suffice to avert
the impending war. At the appointed time the chamber was thronged
with citizens, and a number of speeches were made by legislators
and townsmen conveying various proposals of compromise which
should be tendered the southern people. These addresses were vigorously
applauded by a large proportion of the audience. Before the
close of the meeting, however, there were calls for Senator Dean, a
republican whose loyalty to the government was unquestioned.
Greeted with tumultuous applause, he proceeded, after a few stirring
sentences about the duties of citizenship, to say: âCompromise? Yes,
we will compromise with them! We will send a million free men down
through the southern states and drive the whole confederate army into
the Gulf of Mexico!â The applause which greeted this sentiment
shook the building, and lasted ten minutes or more. The meeting
immediately adjourned, leaving the peace advocates without a program.

As the war progressed, and the future seemed dark indeed, another
peace meeting was called at Madison, to be held in Capital Park.
Noted speakers were engaged, and it was expected that a great
demonstration in favor of ending the war would be staged. By this
time Camp Randall had come into being as the principal military
encampment for Wisconsinâs soldiers. Naturally the men did not

Pg 203

look with enthusiasm upon the impending peace meeting. On the
appointed day two or three hundred soldiers, having secured leave
of absence from camp, dragged a six-pound cannon to capitol square;
loading it with canister, they planted it in front of the speakerâs
stand, with the quiet assurance to those in charge of the meeting that
as soon as a treasonable word should be uttered the orator and all on
the platform would be blown to hell. Under these circumstances the
meeting proved very tame, the speeches being confined to deprecating
the necessity for the war and hoping it would soon be over.

The Copperheads, as they had come to be called, did not omit
any opportunity to flaunt their sentiments before the supporters
of the government. In Madison alone probably hundreds of old-fashioned
copper cents (a coin nearly an inch and a quarter in diameter)
were filed down so as to leave only the Indian head in profile.
To this a pin was affixed for attachment to the coat lapel, and the
coins were worn to afford evidence that the wearer was a Copperhead
in sentiment. Loyal citizens responded to this challenge by
filing the eagle out of the silver quarter and wearing it as a badge.
One prominent citizen, who wore the copperhead for over a year,
lived to say that it was the one action of his life of which he was
heartily ashamed.

There is today no such villification and abuse of President Wilson
as was heaped upon Lincoln during the Civil War. After every
Union defeat the Copperheads would say: âWhat did we tell you?
You can never whip the South!â Some of the newspapers were so
disloyal in sentiment that they were suppressed by military authority.
In fact, the situation was very grave. In comparison with it the
current pacifist machinations appear tame and insignificant. The
great mass of the people, however, were determined to stand by the
government till victory should be achieved. They persevered in this
determination and the Union was preserved. So will it be today,
whether the end comes in one year or five, whether the cost be five
billions of dollars or fifty. There must be no compromise. Let the
fight be to the finish.

Sincerely yours,

E. C. Mason.

Madison, October 1, 1917.

A PRESBYTERIAN OBJECTS

I have been reading the report of the sixty-fourth annual meeting
of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin which I received
yesterday. I was interested in the article by the pioneer missionary,
especially as much of his work was done in a part of Wisconsin where
I labored years ago. On page 184, in a note about
Rev.
Isaac Baird,
it is said that he was appointed to Odanah, which is correct. Such
positions must be filled by appointment. I may say that, unless
my memory deceives me, the work at Odanah was of more consequence
than Father Verwystâs remarks would indicate. But it is said that
Mr. Baird was removed to Crystal Falls, Michigan. I think it should
rather be that Mr. Baird accepted a call to the pastorate of the
church at Crystal Falls or to be its stated supply. If the writer of
the word had written âMr. Baird removed,â there would be no objection
to the statement from a Presbyterian standpoint. But âwas
removed,â that is another matter.

In a speech delivered in the British House of Commons, July
9, 1845, Macaulay said, âAll staunch Presbyterians think that the
flock is entitled,
jure divino
, to a voice in the appointment of a pastor,
and that to force a pastor on a parish to which he is unacceptable
is a sin forbidden by the Word of God as idolatry or perjury.
I am quite sure that I do not exaggerate when I say that the
highest of our high churchmen at Oxford cannot attach more importance
to episcopal government and episcopal ordination than many
thousands of Scotchmen, shrewd men, respectable men, who fear
God and honor the Queen, attach to this right of the people.â And
to go to the fountain head, in âThe Buke of Disciplineâ by John
Knox, are these words. âIt apperteneth to the Pepill and to every
severall Congregation, to Elect thair Minister.â I quote
verbatim
et literatim
. There is much more to the same effect. Excuse me for
this screed, but I spent a good many years in Wisconsin as a Presbyterian
minister and was used to having this question âspeired at
meâ as the Scotch would say, when I returned from a meeting of
presbytery, âHave you been sent back for another year?â When
I explained to those people the Presbyterian way of doing, no one
but said, âI believe that is the best way.â Yet many Presbyterians
in Wisconsin wish to deny to the people that right. The note I

Pg 205

refer to was written by a man who did not know the Presbyterian
way of doing or else was one of the Presbyterians I referred to just
above.
[96]
But those Presbyterians did not know the history of their
own church. A great fight for democracy is on and we must fight
for democracy in the church as well as in the state if we are to
make the democracy of the state a success. See Fiskeâs
Beginnings
of New England
. Hence I do not wish the Wisconsin Historical
Society to help even by a note the autocratic tendencies of some
Wisconsin Presbyterians. Let us advance in democracy by going
back to the time when people chose their bishop—you know the story
of the election of Ambrose of Milan.

I remain

Yours faithfully and gratefully,

Angus Sillars.

Fairmount,
Ill.
, July 24, 1917.

[96]

The editor of the Society, rather than Father Verwyst, author of the article
is responsible for the footnote statement which Mr. Sillars calls in question. It is
freely admitted that he âdid not know the Presbyterian way of doing.â

SURVEY OF HISTORICAL ACTIVITIES

THE SOCIETY AND THE STATE

Seven new members have joined the State Historical Society
during the quarter ending September 30; Charles D. Rosa, of Beloit;
Edward P. Farley, of Chicago; Earl Murray, of Green Bay;
William T. Evjue, of Madison; Frank M. Crowley, of Madison;
Charles H. Crownhart, of Madison; and Dr. L.A. Quaife, of Rosalia,
Washington. In the same period the Society lost through death
two of its valued members, Otto B. Joerns, of Stevens Point, and
Henry E. Legler, of Chicago.

In the death of Henry E. Legler on September 13 this Society
sustained the loss of a valued friend and member. Many and divers
as were the public positions he occupied—newspaper editor, legislator,
secretary of the Milwaukee School Board, secretary of the
Wisconsin Free Library Commission, librarian of the Chicago Public
Library—it is not to the man as a public official that our thoughts
involuntarily turn, but to the man as a friend. With unusual business
capability, which involved securing the utmost of service and
loyalty from his employees, Mr. Legler was possessed of personal
characteristics that endeared him as well to the office messenger as to
the members of the governing boards under whom he worked. His
associations with this Society and the members of the library staff
were long and close, and it seems fitting that we should express both
sorrow for his loss, and gratification that it had been our privilege
to have known him intimately.

Miss Mabel Swerig, for two years a faithful and efficient worker
in the reference division of the Historical Library, severed her connection
with the Society in September in order to enter upon a course
of library training at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn. Miss Mary
Farley, for three years a member of the library staff, on October 1,
assumed direction of the library maintained by Marshall Field
and Company for its employees. The new position will afford
Miss Farley an excellent opportunity for development in the line of
her chosen profession. At the beginning of September Theron
Brown, for the past two years assistant in the public documents
division of the Library, enlisted for technical service in the United
States Navy.

Carl Russell Fish and Frederic Logan Paxson, curators of the
Society and professors of American history in the University of Wisconsin,
spent the summer in Washington engaged in service for

Pg 207

the government. Professor Fishâs time was given to the National
Board for Historical Service, of which he is a member. Professor
Paxson gave his services to the committee on public information.

Prof.
Winfred T. Root, member of the State Historical Society
and of the faculty of the State University, conducted history courses
at the summer session of the University of Chicago.

Rev.
Eugene Updike recently terminated a twenty-seven year
pastorate of the First Congregational Church of Madison. In the
last fifty-two years this church has had but two pastors, Mr. Updikeâs
predecessor having served a quarter of a century.

Capt.
Arthur L. Conger, who delivered the annual address at the
meeting of the State Historical Society in 1916, is now serving on
General Pershingâs staff in France. Mrs. Conger has recently gone
to France to be near her husband.

At the time of going to press, plans are practically complete for
the annual meeting of the State Historical Society to take place
October 25. Two events new to the annual program are a luncheon
to be tendered by the Society to its members and invited friends and
a conference of local historical societies. Because of
Prof.
Frederic
L. Paxsonâs work for the government, he was unable to prepare the
annual address announced in the September number of the
Magazine
.
In his stead
Prof.
Carl R. Fish will speak on âThe Frontier a World
Problem.â A full report of the meeting will appear in a later number
of the
Magazine
.

The use of pageantry in depicting the historical development of
a community is rapidly gaining headway in Wisconsin. Among those
that attracted state-wide attention was the one given at Portage
during the week of the Columbia County Fair, August 22-25, 1917.
âAmerica and the Nationsâ was the title of the pageant, and it was
given in three episodes. In the first there was a symbolical scene
representing the spirit of the Fox and the Wisconsin rivers. Then
followed the Jesuit fathers, French traders, trappers, and pioneers.
In the second episode the coming of miners, lumbermen, fishermen,
and farmers was witnessed. The closing scene was a grand review
of all the leading nations of the world, symbolizing an international
unity. Over 700 people took part in the pageant.

The citizens of Chippewa County staged an interesting pageant
at Holcombe during the week of their Community Fair, September
13 and 14. The pageant, given under the direction of H. A. Edminster,
portrayed the coming of the fur traders in the Chippewa
Valley, a bit of Indian life, the coming of the priests, lumbermen, and
the first permanent settlers. The closing scene depicted the modern
economic and industrial development of that region. One very interesting

Pg 208

part of the performance was the appearance of an ox team
hitched to an old âjumper,â driven by Mr. and Mrs. Edminister,
representing their coming into that region.

Among those working for the cause of history in Wisconsin,
none are doing more effective or practical work than some of the
history committees of the county councils of defense. Among those
that are rendering a real service is the committee of Eau Claire County,
headed by William W. Bartlett. Their object is to gather, preserve,
index, and make available for public use the proceedings of
every event that takes place in Eau Claire County pertaining to the
war. A complete file of newspaper clippings that deal with the war
will be preserved. Also an effort is being made to secure a photograph
and brief sketch of every young man entering the service
from Eau Claire County. Such practical work as this commends itself
to every patriotic citizen in Wisconsin, and the committees in
other counties might do well to follow Eau Claireâs lead.

Mr. Charles E. Brown, chief of the Wisconsin Historical Museum,
entertained in September a group of friends who are interested
in the study of local Indian history at his attractive home in
Nakoma, a suburb of Madison. A picnic supper was served, after
which Mr. Brown gave an instructive talk upon Nakoma and its
environment. Brief talks relating chiefly to Indian history were
made by others present.

The surviving members of the Fifteenth Wisconsin Infantry
held a joint meeting with the Scandinavian Veteransâ Association
at Madison in September and plans were inaugurated for erecting
a monument to the memory of Colonel Heg. Wisconsin had the
distinction during the war of sending a regiment to the front composed
almost exclusively of Scandinavians.
Col.
Hans Heg, their
famous commander, was born in Norway, and came to America when
eleven years old. At the opening of the Civil War he was holding
the position of state prison commissioner, which he resigned in
order to raise a regiment of troops. The Fifteenth Wisconsin
brought credit to itself and to its state, and the name of Colonel
Heg deserves a permanent place among the Wisconsin heroes of the
Civil War.

At the meeting of the Wisconsin Federation of Womenâs Clubs,
held in Madison during October, the history section met in the museum
of the State Historical Society. The visitors were taken for
an automobile ride and sightseeing trip about the city.

The annual meeting of the Sauk County Historical Society
was held at Baraboo, October 5, 1917. All the officers of the
Society were reÃ«lected for the ensuing year. The report of the

Pg 209

treasurer revealed an especially gratifying condition, a considerable
sum of money in the treasury and practically all membership dues
paid in. A bequest of $200 from the estate of the late W. W.
Warner of Madison, was received during the year. The Society
voted to send two delegates to the annual meeting of the State Historical
Society at Madison, October 25. The address of the evening
was given by Mr. M. M. Quaife, Superintendent of the State Historical
Society, on the subject, âThe Angel of Wisconsin.â

The Old Rivermenâs Association of Minneapolis and
St.
Paul
held their meeting in the latter city on September 4, 1917, and the
chief address of the meeting was given by George B. Merrick, of
Madison. No group of men in the upper Mississippi Valley has
played a more romantic part in the opening up of this region than
the old steamboat men. Their membership now numbers about
150, and the experiences which they relate form an interesting
chapter in early Wisconsin history.

Wisconsinâs Indian drama entitled âGlory of the Morning,â
written by
Prof.
W. E. Leonard, is being produced by Mrs. Emma
Garrett Boyd of the Casino Studio, New York. The proceeds are
being devoted to the war fund. This drama was first produced in
Madison in 1912 by the Wisconsin Dramatic Society under the
direction of
Prof.
T. H. Dickinson. As a summer festival play it
has become one of the most popular in the country.

An interesting old account book kept by Jean Brunet of Brunet
Falls (now Cornell), Wisconsin, was recently given to the Society
by Mrs. Gustave Robart of Holcombe. The old Brunet tavern
was the most widely known of any in the Chippewa Valley, and every
traveler who went up and down the valley stopped with Jean Brunet.
During its palmy days as many as 150 men were fed there at
one time. The entries in the book cover the period from 1862 to
1876. Mrs. Robart, its donor, is a child of the first white settler
in that part of the valley.

Recent accessions to the Societyâs historical museum include
fine examples of early English chinaware, an early American clock,
lamp, childrenâs clothing, laces and embroideries, a steelyard, kitchen
fire shovel, boat-buildersâ rule, a railroad stock certificate, and
other articles of interest. The most valuable single specimen is a
large silver trophy cup given by the
Army and Navy News
and won
by the First Wisconsin Infantry in the Second Brigade football contest
among the troops stationed on the Mexican border in 1916.

An interesting collection of war relics has been placed on exhibit
in one of the rooms of the museum just off the auditorium. The exhibit
represents the current history of the present war, as illustrated

Pg 210

by relics, war implements, and posters. The contents of the exhibit
are changed every few days.

A valuable collection of papers was recently presented to the
Society by Dr. Herbert B. Tanner. The collection contains many
of the letters of John Lawe, the well-known merchant and fur trader
of Green Bay, and some letters of George Boyd, an early Wisconsin
Indian agent. Lawe through an inheritance left him by his uncle,
Jacob Franks of Montreal, became a very wealthy trader, and following
the War of 1812 settled in Green Bay. Here he acted as
agent for the American Fur Company and his operations extended
from Milwaukee as far west and north as the upper Mississippi. As
adviser and counselor for the Indians and fur traders he became the
leading citizen in what is now Wisconsin. Dr. Tannerâs donation contains
fifty-three letters written by Lawe himself, ranging in time from
1824 until his death in 1846. Their chief interest lies in the additional
light that they throw upon the early fur-trading interests of Wisconsin
and the Northwest. The collection contains eighteen letters
written by Jacob Franks covering the period from 1818 to 1830.
Those written during the latter years express a feeling of regret
over the gradual disappearance of the fur trade, and the coming in
of new settlers. There are several letters of a personal nature that
add interest to the collection. The Society is indebted to Doctor
Tanner for this contribution of fur-trading documents.

SOME WISCONSIN PUBLIC DOCUMENTS,
JANUARY-JULY, 1917

The sixty-fourth annual session of the Wisconsin Teachersâ Association
was held at Milwaukee, November 2 to 4, 1916. The chief
value of its published
Proceedings
is in the fifty-nine papers and
abstracts which it contains. Four of the principal addresses form
a symposium on the subject of progress during the last decade in
rural schools, secondary schools, normal schools, and the University
of Wisconsin, the fourth topic being discussed by Dr. Charles R.
Van Hise in his presidential address. Three important papers deal
with recent achievements in elementary, rural, and secondary education.
Notable addresses by persons from outside the state are
those of William Wirt, John Finley, L. D. Coffman, and Dr. Maria
Montessori. In addition to the papers, the volume contains minutes
of business sessions, committee reports, the constitution and by-laws
of the organization, and a list of members.

The twenty-second report of the commissioner of banking deals
with the year closing on November 17, 1916. During this period
state banks and trust companies gained $774,100 in capital invested,

Pg 211

representing in all an investment of $23,672,350. The total resources
of $298,617,175.61 show a gain for the year of $44,675,247.15. The
increase in deposits amounted to $43,424,626.33. Attention is called
to the increase from 21% to 22.7% in the average reserve held by state
banks. The conclusion of the commissioner, based upon an analysis
of the statistics of which the report largely consists, is that âthe
financial outlook for Wisconsin is most encouraging.â In a section
on legislation the passage of a law to create a uniform system of
school savings banks, under state supervision and subject to state
control, is recommended. Most of the report is given over to statements
of state banks, mutual savings banks, trust companies, land
mortgage associations, and national banks.

The Department of English of the University of Wisconsin has
issued a small pamphlet with the title
A List of Books on the War
.
Out of the great mass of books on the subject a rigorous selection of
some 270 titles has been made. These aim to include the most important
works published prior to June 1, 1917. Short pamphlets and
tracts have been excluded, and the titles are chiefly English and
French. They are grouped into six divisions: âBackground and
Origins,â âCourse and Conduct,â âPersonal Narratives,â âThought
concerning the War,â âPeace and Readjustment,â âMiscellaneous.â
The selections are discriminating, and the bulletin should prove of
great value to students of the war.

An admirable innovation has been made in issuing the Governorâs
Memorial Day proclamation as a small pamphlet, very neatly put up,
rather than as a broadside of large, awkward size, and difficult to
preserve in a series.

The importance of the dairy industry in Wisconsin is clearly
brought out in a report of the dairy and food commissioner on
Butter
Factories and Cheese Factories Operated in 1916; Dairy Statistics
for 1915
. The gross profits in all branches of the industry
for 1915 are estimated at more than $110,000,000. Approximately
235,000,000 pounds of cheese were produced. More than
124,000,000 pounds of butter were made in the state, about 20,000,000
pounds in excess of the production of 1909. The report contains
an interesting statistical comparison of cheese and butter production
for the years 1909 and 1915. Lists of operators of butter and
cheese factories, and of cheese factories operated in 1916 by counties,
are included. There is also a list of condenseries in Wisconsin.

Agriculture in the High School, A Manual for the High Schools
of Wisconsin
has been brought out by the Department of Public
Instruction. The authors are Henry N. Goddard and John A. James.
Issued as a guide for high schools giving agricultural work, particularly

Pg 212

for those maintaining four-year departments, the manual illustrates
admirably the new movement in secondary education. A
historical sketch contains an account of the various laws which have
shaped the agricultural movement in Wisconsin. The proper interpretation
and method of applying these laws is made clear. The
practical problems of the needs in the organization and management
of high school agricultural departments are considered in detail, and
a great amount of material helpful to the administration of such a
department—particularly as to the scope and character of the work—is
included. The manual has been prepared with great care, and
appears to be a model of its kind.

The last report of the attorney-general continues the opinions,
January 1, 1916, to December 31, 1916, and the eighth biennial report,
July 1, 1914 to June 30, 1916. The first 65 pages contain
a summary of the work of the attorney-general. An examination
of these pages shows that during the period indicated 68 civil, 59
industrial commission, 2 bankruptcy, and 8 forfeiture cases were
disposed of. Thirty-six criminal cases were disposed of, 23 in lower
courts, 12 in the Supreme Court, and 1 in the United States Supreme
Court. The official opinions of the attorney-general, filling 917
pages, embrace in their scope a great amount of state activity. In
the printing of these opinions there is no classification or grouping of
the material, such as in the reports of the attorney-general of Indiana,
for example. A strictly chronological order is followed.

The report of the dairy and food commissioner for the year
ending June 30, 1916, illustrates the vital need of protecting the
public against the sale of adulterated and misbranded foods. It contains
the reports of the state chemist, dealing with the inspection of
beverages, canned vegetables, dairy products, dried fruit, and drugs;
of the assistant dairy and food commissioner, and of the inspector
of weights and measures. Special attention is called to the new
dairy and food laws, and the new era in the dairy industry of Wisconsin
which these laws introduce. As a result of unsanitary conditions
in cheese factories and meat markets, and misrepresentations
of foods, 79 convictions were secured. Druggists to the number of
226 were selling spirits of camphor not standard. Between April 17
and June 30, 2,221 factories were inspected. It was found that 35%
of the butter factory operators and 24% of the cheese factory
operators were complying with the license law and the new regulations.
Much has been done in the economic interests of the public
by the inspector of weights and measures, for the number of inaccurate
computing scales decreased from 17% in 1914 to 8% in 1916.

The Country Church an Economic and Social Force
is an interesting
bulletin edited by the Agricultural Experiment Station of the
University of Wisconsin. It points out that the thriving church in a
rural community tends to unify agriculture, which in turn serves to
nurture the church. The country or hamlet church thrives best
where population is constant, and successful farming is advanced
through the influence of the church upon daily habits. It is suggested
that principles for the re-parishing of rural districts might be
established through a joint commission of the national religious
bodies, with a view toward creating stronger churches for the farmers.
Several descriptions are given of Wisconsin country churches
in which the religious leaders are fostering a progressive agriculture
through coÃ¶perative social development. The remarkable story of a
great country pastor, John Frederick Oberlin, who for sixty years
labored for the social, industrial, and religious uplift of a poverty-stricken
community, is given in illustration of the theories advanced
in the bulletin.

The seventeenth biennial report of the Wisconsin state prison
is largely statistical. The average number of convicts for the year
ending June 30, 1915, was 807; for the year ending June 30, 1916,
it was 906. During the latter period 140 to 180 convicts were employed
and housed outside of the walls of the institution. Under
the chaplainâs direction, school was held from one to two oâclock,
three days a week, during six months of the year. There were fourteen
classes and an average attendance of 110 men. Instruction was
given the illiterate in four grades in reading, arithmetic, writing,
and spelling. Earnings of inmates for the year were $35,696.50.
New prisoners admitted numbered 511; of these 483 were male; 23
were under twenty years of age, and 117 over fifty years; 495 were
white, 12 black, 3 Indian, and 1 mulatto; 230 were Catholic, 148
Protestants, 108 Lutherans, 3 Hebrews, 1 Greek Orthodox, 1 Seventh
Day Adventist; 17 had no religion; 27 were illiterate, 41 had high
school education, and 7 were college men; 174 were native to Wisconsin,
28 to Illinois, 29 to Michigan, 19 to Minnesota, 20 to New
York, and 11 to Pennsylvania; 26 were born in Austro-Hungary, 20
in Finland, 34 in Germany, 10 in Norway, and 27 in Russia. The
others came from various states and countries throughout the world.
Statistics are given concerning occupations, residence by counties,
crimes, terms of sentences, discharges, pardons, population since the
organization of the prison in 1852, the binder twine plant, farm and
gardening operations, and many other matters.

The merit system for the public service of Wisconsin was established
in 1905, and the sixth biennial report of the Civil Service

Pg 214

Commission has now been issued, covering the work done from July,
1914, to July, 1916. The classified service of the state comprises the
exempt, competitive, noncompetitive, legislative employee, and labor
classes. In these classes there are about 3,200 employees. From
July 1, 1914 to July 1, 1916, 4,995 persons took competitive examinations.
Of these, 2,903 passed, 2,079 failed; 376 permanent and 147
temporary appointments were made. That is, 58% passed, and 10Â½%
were appointed to positions. The number of applicants for positions
at state institutions has decreased, for various reasons. The report
contains a map showing the number and distribution of employees in
the state classified service. It also presents the results of certain
studies aiming to increase the efficiency of the service. Half of the
report consists of financial tables and rules.

The chief functions of the state fire marshal, as indicated in
his ninth annual report, are two: combatting incendiarism, and
doing fire prevention work. CoÃ¶perating with the local departments,
the fire marshal has investigated 389 fires during the period covered
by the report, from July 1, 1915 to December 31, 1916. Forty-six
arrests were made, 12 persons were convicted and sentenced, 5
pleaded guilty and were sentenced, 6 were paroled, and 5 were sent
to the hospital for the insane. In the year ending December 31,
1915, 3,066 fires in the state damaged buildings and contents to the
extent of $5,932,980. These figures show the importance of the
educational campaign for fire prevention conducted by the fire
marshal. Thirteen newspaper articles were issued. These are
printed in full in the report. Some of the titles are:
Some Fires and
Their Lessons
,
Safe Homes
,
Gasoline
,
Kerosene
,
Spring Clean Up
,

Safe Schoolhouses
, and
Holiday Fires
. The report contains tables
dealing with values, losses, classification of property, fire causes,
number of fires according to classification of risk and cause, and
other matters.

The biennial report of the adjutant-general deals with the two
fiscal years ending June 30, 1916. It is a survey of the military
activities of the state of Wisconsin during a period of trial and service.
From July 1, 1914 to June 30, 1916, the Wisconsin National
Guard increased from 201 officers and 2,990 enlisted men to a total
of 208 officers and 4,224 enlisted men. Of these the report states
that â4,168 officers and men are temporarily in the service of the
United States in response to the call of the President issued June
18, 1916.â Since the date of this report, the war has placed a
new responsibility upon the guard. The adjutant-generalâs report
gives information in regard to organization and strength, legislation,
equipment, instruction, small arms firing, naval militia, medical

Pg 215

department, expenses, military reservation, and pensions. The
National Defense Act oath, making obligatory a three-year term of
reserve service by national guard organizations, was taken by officers
and enlisted men of the guard âwith fine zeal and loyalty to their
country, their state, and their organization.â

The first biennial report of the State Conservation Commission
is one of unusual interest. Through a law of 1915 this commission
(consisting of three commissioners and a secretary) succeeded to the
powers and duties of the Forestry Board, State Park Board, Conservation
Commission, Commissioners of Fisheries, and the State Fish
and Game Warden Department. The purpose was to consolidate
âall the closely related duties and problems of administration over
forest and stream, fish and game, and to give powerful impetus to the
conservation of the natural resources of the Badger State.â The
result has been a notable increase in efficiency and economy. The
change, it may be noted, dispensed with the services of twenty-two
members of boards and commissions. A strict civil service rÃ©gime
has been inaugurated. The report contains a considerable number of
papers and division reports dealing with the conditions, problems,
constructive plans and achievements which are shaping the conservation
movement in the state. A large number of admirably chosen
illustrations show the richness, variety, and beauty of the resources
of nature in Wisconsin. These pictures enhance the value of a report
which contains information of peculiar interest and significance
to the people of the state.

The biennial report of the secretary of state is largely a collection
of financial statistics covering the fiscal years ending June 30,
1915 and June 30, 1916. The condition of all state funds, receipts
and disbursements, the net disbursements of the state, the valuation
of taxable property in the counties, and the apportionment of tax
and special charges for 1914 and 1915, collected in 1915, are shown
in detailed statements, and various tabular statements.

Part four of the ninth annual report of the Railroad Commission
is an elaborate collection of financial and operating statistics of
railroad companies for the period from June 30, 1914 to June 30,
1915. The report is divided into three parts: steam railroads, electric
railways, and express companies. There are 234 closely printed
pages of statistical tables and figures, which lay bare with utmost
exactness and detail all phases of the finances and operations of the
three classes of public carriers mentioned. The statistics are not
confined merely to Wisconsin; for example, the tables exhibiting the
income account of steam railroads for the year ending December 31,
1914, show first the accounts of interstate roads in Wisconsin, and

Pg 216

thereafter the records of the entire systems of interstate roads which
operate in Wisconsin.

The Railroad Commission of Wisconsin has published a digest
covering the decisions contained in volumes
I to XV
of the official
reports of the commission. The digest therefore covers all the decisions
from July 20, 1905 to February 4, 1915. The compilation has
been made by Harold L. Geisse. Its purpose is âto state briefly and
yet clearly the principles and facts set forth in the decisions of the
Commissionâ¦.â The subject titles are alphabetically arranged,
and carefully supplemented by cross-references. Precise references
to sources are given for each decision. The value of such a compilation
for lawyers is obvious. It should be noted that the separate
volumes of the reports are each provided with an âindex-digest.â
For example, in volume
XVI
, recently published, this index covers
pages 869 to 936. Volume
XVI
contains the opinions and decisions
of the Railroad Commission from February 10, 1915 to November
15, 1915. Reports are given on hundreds of important cases dealing
with railway, telegraph, telephone, express, and public utility problems.

Though the task of administering the income tax law is not at
all times pleasant or easy, yet, in the opinion of the Wisconsin Tax
Commission, âfive years of experience have proved the law workable;
taxpayers generally comply with its mandates without objection;
and the resulting revenue has exceeded all expectations.â A chapter
dealing especially with problems in the administration of the income
tax law, and a series of tables showing the results of the income
assessments of 1913, 1914, 1915, and 1916, form an interesting
part of the eighth biennial report of the Wisconsin Tax Commission.
This report is a detailed statement of the work of the commission
for the years ending June 30, 1915 and June 30, 1916. In addition
to the section on the income tax, the chief features of the report
are its chapters on âDuties of Tax Commission,â âGeneral Revision
of Tax Laws Recommended,â âAssessment and Taxation of Public
Service Companies,â âInheritance Tax,â âReport of Engineers,â
âMunicipal Statistics,â and âStatistics of Assessments and Taxes.â
A thoughtful address by Thomas E. Lyons on the subject âOur Increasing
Public Expendituresâ is included. Mr. Lyons finds the
remedy for the situation in a closer limitation of the taxing and borrowing
powers.

The Wisconsin state budget for 1917 was compiled for the use
of the legislature of 1917 by the State Board of Public Affairs. In
scientific completeness it represents a considerable advance upon former
publications of the kind. To aid the legislature in âdetermining

Pg 217

policies, and in working out a definite fiscal program and in the
drafting of appropriate measures,â complete information is furnished
along six lines. These are as follows: a report of actual receipts
and disbursements for the three fiscal years prior to July 1, 1916;
departmental estimates of receipts and disbursements for the current
year 1916-1917; estimated treasury balances as of July 1,
1917; departmental receipts and disbursements for the biennial
period beginning July 1, 1917; appropriations available beginning
July 1, 1913; appropriations requested by the state departments,
boards, commissions, and institutions for the biennium, beginning
July 1, 1917. On January 5, 1917, after hearings and investigations,
the Board of Public Affairs issued a typewritten bulletin with its
recommendations on the budget. The 344 pages of the budget are
mimeographed and bound.

The third biennial report of the Wisconsin Highway Commission
deals with the state aid highway operations in the years from
January 1, 1914, to January 1, 1916, together with preliminary
estimates of operations to December 31, 1916. In the first five
years of work under the state aid law, 4,846 miles of all types of
roadway have been constructed in Wisconsin; of this mileage, 2,771
miles have been surfaced with various materials; in grading, approximately
10,300,000 cubic yards of earth have been excavated
and placed in fills; 8,662 concrete culverts have been built on these
roads, containing 100,000 cubic yards of concrete; since July 1,
1911, 2,819 county and state bridges have been constructed in accordance
with the plans of the commission; at the height of the working
season in 1916 the daily employment in the work included 175
engineers, county highway commissioners, and inspectors, 600 foremen,
6,000 laborers, and 2,500 teams. The daily pay roll for state,
counties, and towns was in the vicinity of $22,000. In state aid roads
and bridge construction in 1915, there was expended $4,134,830; in
1916, $4,215,183; the report estimates an expenditure of at least
$4,600,000 in 1917. The report contains many discussions of
phases of the road problem that are of timely importance. Many
interesting illustrations of the types of construction built under the
state aid law are given.

The address on John Muir delivered by President Van Hise upon
the occasion of the unveiling of a bronze bust of the famous naturalist
at the University of Wisconsin has been published as a small
eighteen page pamphlet. At the age of eleven Muir came to America
from Scotland with his father, and settled on a farm a few miles from
Portage. He spent four years at the University of Wisconsin, maintaining
himself by âdoing odd jobs during the term and working in

Pg 218

the harvest, fields in the summer.â In speaking of his departure
from Madison, Muir writes in his book
My Boyhood and Youth
, âBut
I was only leaving one university for another, the Wisconsin University
for the University of Wilderness.â President Van Hise
gives an eloquent account and interpretation of the life of this noted
son of Wisconsin. âThe great public service of John Muir,â writes
President Van Hise, âwas leading the nation through his writings to
appreciate the grandeur of our mountains and the beauty and variety
of their plant and animal life, and the consequent necessity for
holding forever as a heritage for all the people the most precious
of these great scenic areas. Probably to his leadership more than to
that of any other man is due the adoption of the policy of national
parks.â

History of the Civil War Military Pensions, 1861-1885
is the
title of a bulletin recently issued by the University of Wisconsin in
its
History Series
(
vol.
4,
no.
1,
pp.
1-120). It is the doctorâs thesis
of John William Oliver. As the title indicates it is a survey beginning
with the reorganization of the pension system as a consequence
of the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, and it carries the study
through a period of twenty-four years. Beginning with a description
of the situation before the Civil War, the author examines the
succession of acts passed between 1861 and 1870, and the various
administrative problems occasioned by the war. âBy 1871,â writes
Mr. Oliver, âit appears as if Congress had extended the benefits of
the pension laws so as to include all possible claimants. Within ten
years, over 261,000 Civil War pensioners had been added to the rolls,
and the Government had already paid out more than $152,000,000
for their benefit.â The enactment of many contradictory laws led
to the codification act of 1873. This act is described in the second
chapter of the book, together with attempts at reforming the pension
system. A third chapter discusses the act passed January 25,
1879, providing for the payment of arrears——âthe most significant
and far-reaching piece of pension legislation enacted during the period
coveredâ in the study. The effects of this act may be seen in the
increase, during the first six years after its passage, of the number
of pensioners from 223,998 to 345,125, and in the amount expended
annually from $27,000,000 to $68,000,000. The last chapter of the
bulletin deals with the relation of pensions and politics, which assumed
considerable importance in the years following the Arrears
Act. At the conclusion of the thesis, development to 1885 is summarized.
A later monograph is promised, to treat of the new epoch
which the pension system then entered.

The biennial report of the Board of Regents of the University of
Wisconsin for the years 1914-15 and 1915-16 consists largely of the

Pg 219

report of the President, followed by reports of deans, directors,
business manager, and other officers. The Presidentâs report contains
two main divisions: âThe Progress of the University,â and
âThe Needs of the University.â The faculty numbered 389 in
1913-14. The number increased to 437 in 1915-16. In the year preceding
the biennium the total number of students, including the short
course and summer sessions, was 6,765. The number increased to
7,596 in 1914-15, and to 7,624 in 1915-16. Though the survey conducted
by the Board of Public Affairs resulted in controversy, and led
to no direct results, yet in consequence of a spirit of self-inquiry at
the University a large committee was appointed by the faculty in the
autumn of 1915, which was divided into a number of special committees
to consider means of improving the University in undergraduate
instruction, research, graduate, and field work, foreign language
requirements, faculty organization, faculty records, and University
physical plant. As a result of this inquiry, new legislation to be
put in effect during the next biennium is expected materially to improve
the efficiency of the University. These subjects are considered
in some detail in the report. The needs of the University are discussed
under the heads of salaries, and constructional needs. The
varied activities of the University may be comprehended by a study
of the many departmental and other statements included in the
report.

The first annual report of the state chief engineer of Wisconsin
issued in March, 1917, reveals the enormous work that has been taken
over by that department. Five separate divisions known respectively
as the railroad and utility, the highway, the architectural, the power
plant, and the sanitary divisions have been established, and special
experts placed in charge of each. The railroad and utility division
was faced with duties greater than those of any other department.
In making a physical valuation of all the steam railroads in Wisconsin
it was found that there are over 11,000 miles of track in
the state. The cost of the rolling stock, terminals, stores, and other
equipment exceeds $385,000,000. The twenty-eight electric railways
of the state have over 400 miles of track, with properties valued
at $57,000,000. The state highway division reported that over
$3,600,000 had been expended for state aid construction of roads
in 1916. Over a half million dollars was spent in state aid bridge
construction and 352 bridges of all types were built. The architectural
division has formulated a standard for contracts, plans and
specifications for labor and material to be used by the different institutions
of the state. The power plant division supervises the operation
of the various state plants, the purchase of fuel, specifies the
plans for construction work and examines all bids. The sanitary

Pg 220

division, aside from conducting the investigation of different water
supplies, drainage, and sewage systems, is also vitally interested in
enlightening the public upon the importance of sanitation.

According to the
Twentieth Annual Report
of the Building and
Loan Association there are seventy-seven such organizations in Wisconsin.
The past two years have been unusually profitable for
them. Their total assets amount to $16,873,000 which was an increase
of $2,500,000 over the previous year. Their membership now
numbers 45,891, showing a 21 per cent increase over the preceding
year. Although their business showed a considerable increase, yet
the report states in some cases money was so plentiful that it could not
always be loaned with profit.

That there exists among the farmers of this state an unusually
strong system of coÃ¶peration is proved by a bulletin issued by the
Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Wisconsin in
July, 1917. The industries that are managed on a coÃ¶perative basis
in this state do an annual business amounting to more than
$62,000,000. The creamery industry leads all the others, and in
1916 those plants that were run on a coÃ¶perative plan did business
amounting to over $19,000,000. The two organizations that are
most instrumental in promoting this spirit of coÃ¶peration are the
American Society of Equity and the Grange. The former has a membership
in Wisconsin now in excess of 12,000, while the Grange societies
have over 2,200 names on their rolls. In addition to these two organizations
there are sixteen others listed that tend to promote unity
among the farmers of the state. The most important ones mentioned
are the National Agricultural Organization, the farmersâ mutual
insurance companies, the community breedersâ associations, feed and
elevator companies, coÃ¶perative creameries, packing plants and others.
The coÃ¶perative organizations are so numerous throughout the
state that but few farmers can be found who are not identified with
one or more of the agencies. The day of individualism among Wisconsin
farmers is fast disappearing.

The sixteenth edition of the
Manual for Elementary Course
of Study
in the schools of Wisconsin was issued in July, 1917. The
state superintendent of public instruction has rendered a valuable
service by discussing many pedagogical questions and in making concrete
suggestions to the teachers. The object of the department
was to place in the hands of each teacher a brief pedagogical treatise
in connection with the subject matter to be taught. This report
combines what may rightly be called a textbook on pedagogy with
a state manual. More than ever the department of education is
emphasizing the importance of bringing about a closer relationship
between teacher and pupil, and some very practical and simple suggestions

Pg 221

are laid down for promoting this relationship. The method
for teaching children how to study properly, the importance of careful
assignments of lessons, and the manner in which recitations can
be made interesting and spicy are all discussed in a practical way.
The policy of reducing the number of daily recitations is suggested,
and the combining of classes most closely related is advised, especially
in rooms where the work is crowded.

In a leaflet issued by the State Council of Defense, July, 1917,
announcement is made of a course of instruction to be given for health
aides in several of the larger hospitals of the state. The plan is
to offer six months of intensive training to young women in order to
prepare them to care for the civilian sick when the regular registered
nurses are drawn into military hospitals. The cost of training,
board, lodging, and laundry bills will all be paid by the State Council
of Defense. In return for this instruction each of the successful
candidates is required to sign an agreement to attend the sick in the
state of Wisconsin for a period of two years after completing the six
monthsâ course. The first training school was opened at the Milwaukee
County Hospital, Wauwatosa, July 1, 1917.

SOME PUBLICATIONS

Merk, Frederick.

Economic History of Wisconsin During the Civil
War Decade.
Publications of the State Historical Society of
Wisconsin
Studies,
Vol. I.
Published by the Society, Madison,
1916.
Pp.
414.

The Wisconsin Historical Society has inaugurated its series of

Studies
by the most elaborate work of constructive history it has
published, which is also the most comprehensive treatment of the
economic history of any state during the constitutional period, taking
rank with Bruceâs
Virginia
and Weedenâs
New England
. The
author has produced a book which is of interest not only to the
state with which it deals, but to every student of American history.

The American state, at least today and in the West, is an artificial
unit, whose political separateness barely justifies that exclusive
devotion of the historical student which the vastness of the United
States seems to render necessary if the roots of our life are to be
discovered. To recognize the influence of national conditions, without
making the treatment national, to individualize the community
without making it appear a detached entity, requires a variety of
skill which can not be produced by scientific study alone, but demands
also real literary ability. This skill Merk clearly possesses,
and he has created an impression of an economic life, distinctly confined
to the area of the state, yet part of that of the Union, and in

Pg 222

touch with that outside the national limits. He is fully conscious
of the importance of Wisconsin wheat in our relations with Great
Britain, and of the interstate functions of a medium of exchange, but
he is not betrayed into a discussion of diplomacy or of national
banking.

A similar difficulty is always presented when one attempts a cross-section
of any history, for periods are even more artificial than state
lines. Economically the âDecadeâ of the Civil War does not have
those distinguishing features which are generally used to mark off,
for convenience of study, one set of years from another. Doubtless
the consideration which determined the selection was again artificial,
the United States system of decennial censuses. Mr. Merk, however,
allows himself more latitude in this case, and his work actually
covers the real economic period, 1857 to 1873.

The chronological difficulty is intensified by the rapid changes
of a new community. Wheat growing reaches its apex and declines,
lumbering waxes, but neither begins nor culminates, movements
feebly originate that are later of absorbing interest. The adjustment
of proportions between these conflicting interests is delicately
handled. The picture is that of the time, but the stage in the development
of each industry is clearly indicated, and the origins of
later movements given in some detail. The volume will afford a base
for histories of the earlier and later periods, but has not skimmed
their cream.

The technical character of the work is high. Newspapers and
statistics were not only used, but are analyzed. The great resources
of the State Historical Society were supplemented by personal interviews.
The volume contains ample footnotes, illustrations, a
map, index, but no bibliography. Its make-up is in the new, and more
satisfactory, form recently adopted by the Society.

The title indicates that the center of interest is the effect of war
on the Wisconsin community. This problem runs throughout, and is
of especial interest today. Mr. Merk emphasizes the relative facility
of adjustment in an agricultural community. Another general feature
is the tendency toward coÃ¶peration in industry, particularly
agriculture, for the purposes of education and general improvement,
which later became so characteristic of Wisconsin.

Agriculture properly opens the volume with its vital but somewhat
monotonous progress enlivened by the lively episode of hops. Lumbering
receives fewer pages, but two chapters; the first, on the industry,
the second, on the lumber wars. Railroads receive five chapters and
almost as many pages as both, including two picturesque fights,
which formed, in large measure, the basis of state politics during the
period. Banking and trade about equal agriculture, and reveal a

Pg 223

state youthful but less reckless than many others. A chapter on
labor is chiefly concerned with the beginnings of the labor movement,
labor in industry being largely discussed in connection with the various
fields. There are other chapters on mining, manufacturing, the
commerce of the Upper Mississippi, and the commerce of the Great
Lakes. No one reading of the lumber wars or the Anti-Monopoly
Revolt can complain that economic history is dry.

The most unique contribution is doubtless that on the history of
lumbering. Nevertheless the study of railroading reveals the advantages
in taking up so vast a subject by localities. Generalizations
become vivid by the detail that is given them. One sees how the railroads
were unscrupulous, how the voters were unreasonable. The
handling of such questions on a scale that involves personalities is a
searching test of historical poise, and Mr. Merk shows a candor and a
fair-mindedness that are impeccable; he sometimes criticizes action,
but never impugns the motive.

The reviewer hesitates to close without adverse criticism, for fear
that the review may be considered perfunctory. He could not, with
honesty, do otherwise than express his conviction that the work is
unusual in the degree and the well-rounded proportion of its excellence.
If anything more could be desired, it seems to be a concluding
chapter, not to add new facts, but to give a greater sense of development.
Each chapter moves, but the topical method brings its
inevitable result; one cannot entirely escape the impression of a
street corner rather than a river bank.

Two of the four leading articles in the October number of the

American Historical Review
are by Wisconsin men.
Prof.
Herbert
E. Bolton, now of California, discusses âThe Mission as a Frontier
Institution in the Spanish-American Colonies.â
Prof.
W. T. Root, of
the University of Wisconsin, writes of âThe Lords of Trade and
Plantations.â Other leading articles in the magazine are âA Case of
Witchcraftâ by George L. Kittredge, and âThe History of German
Socialism Reconsideredâ by
Prof.
C. J. H. Hayes.

The September number of the
Mississippi Valley Historical Review

contains three articles of special interest to Wisconsin readers.
The first, âThe Rise of Sports,â by
Prof.
Frederic Logan Paxson,
curator of the Society, was delivered as the recent annual presidential
address before the Mississippi Valley Historical Association. It
traces in interesting fashion the development in America between
1876 and 1893 of a widespread interest in out-of-door exercise. B.
H. Schockel writes on the âSettlement and Development of the Lead
and Zinc Mining Region with Special Emphasis on Jo Daviess County,
Illinois.â The district treated of consisted of Grant, Iowa, and

Lafayette Counties in Wisconsin, and of Jo Daviess County, Illinois.
Although the latter county affords the particular locus for the
study, it applies with almost equal force to the three counties of
southwestern Wisconsin included in the lead mining district. Finally,

Prof.
James A. James, of Northwestern University, writes on
âSpanish Influence in the West during the American Revolution.â

The Wisconsin Archeological Society has recently issued two
reports, one describing the antiquities of Green Lake, the other describing
the early Indian remains of Shawano County. The latter
report is based upon the recent surveys made of the Shawano Lake
and Wolf River Region by George R. Fox, a former resident of Wisconsin,
but now a curator of the Chamberlain Museum in Three Oaks,
Michigan. The Society is now making an earnest effort to preserve
a fine Indian mound on the shore of Lake Anderson, in Forest County.
This mound, 10 feet high and 45 feet in diameter, stands at the
edge of an old Indian village site and is the only one in that part of
the country. Relic hunters have already begun to dig into it, and
the state Archeological Society, realizing its historic value, is urging
the owner to preserve it permanently and mark it with a descriptive
tablet.

The first issue of the
Michigan History Magazine
published by
the Michigan Historical Commission appeared in July, 1917. Like
similar magazines, its chief purpose is that of serving as an historical
news bulletin, and as a medium of publication for papers of historical
interest. The first number contains five contributed articles, with
sections devoted to historical news, notes, and comments. One of
the features to be mentioned is that of securing reports from all
the county and local historical societies regarding their activities.
Since the local societies cannot support a joint publication, this
method offers a good substitute. By this exchange of news, each
society is kept in touch with the proceedings of the other. A contributed
article of more than ordinary merit appears in the first issue
by
Rev.
F. X. Barth on âThe Field for the Historian in the Upper
Peninsula.â Aside from indicating the numerous points of historical
interest found in the Upper Peninsula, many of which are shared
jointly by Wisconsin, the paper presents one of the strongest appeals
for the value of local history study that can be found anywhere.
It is recommended to every reader of our Society.

Dr. George N. Fuller, Secretary of the Michigan Historical
Commission, is the author of a new book entitled the
Economic and
Social Beginnings of Michigan
. The study deals with the settlement
of the Lower Peninsula during the territorial period from 1805 to
1837. Doctor Fuller has given special attention to the purely economic

Pg 225

conditions that existed in the Michigan Territory until her
admission into the Union. It is by far the most interesting and
authentic volume on the early history of Michigan that has appeared.
The work is richly illustrated and is printed in large, readable type.

The Michigan Historical Commission proposes to reproduce by
photostatic process the rare files of the
Kentucky Gazette
, 1787-1800,
and the Detroit
Gazette
, 1817-1830. Of the former, but one
file is known to exist, that in the Lexington Public Library. Of the
latter file, the Wisconsin Historical Library possesses six bound volumes,
covering over one-half of the total period. It is proposed to
issue ten sets of each paper for as many subscribing libraries.

The Filson Club of Louisville has issued as number twenty-eight
of its publications
The Kentucky River
by Mary Verhoeff.
In this and other similar studies supported by the Filson Club, Kentucky
is accumulating a valuable history of her state development.
River navigation played a larger part in the early history of Kentucky
than in almost any other of the western states. Miss Verhoeffâs
chapter on the âBeginnings of River Commerceâ contains
one of the most interesting discussions of trade in the early Ohio
Valley that has recently appeared. The study is profusely illustrated,
consisting of six chapters and 257 pages. In marked contrast
with the expensive volumes that thus far have been issued by the
Filson Club, the present one appears in a most simple dress with
covers of heavy paper.

Mr. A. C. Quisenberry has an interesting article in the September
number of the
Register
of the Kentucky State Historical Society
on the âHistory of Morganâs Men.â There are few chapters in
the military history of the Confederacy that compare in interest
with the swift, dashing raids of Generals Morgan and Forrest.
There are many historical readers who do not know that the southern
forces ever came north of the Ohio during the conflict between the
states. But during the summer of 1863 the citizens of Indiana and
Ohio were given the greatest scare they ever experienced when General
Morgan led 2,000 men in a mad dash across these two states
and reached Columbia County, Ohio, where surrounded by over 80,000
regulars, volunteers, and home guards, he surrendered. Mr.
Quisenberryâs article gives us a praiseworthy review of this brilliant
raid.

One of the most important publications of original documents
that has recently appeared relating to the southwestern portion of
the United States and Louisiana Territory is the collection of the
official letter books of
Gov.
William C. C. Claiborne, edited by Dr.
Dunbar Rowland of the Mississippi Historical Society. Governor

Pg 226

Claiborne was perhaps the most important man in the entire Southwest
from 1803 to 1817. He touched American life at many vital
points, and his correspondence during the years in which he served
as Governor of that vast territory is filled with observations and
suggestions that relate to every important activity of the Southwest.
The letters now made available for the first time comprise
the chief source material from which the history of that significant
section of American history must be written. The letters fill six
octavo volumes, personally edited by Dr. Dunbar Rowland.

With the passing of the American frontier and the rapid settlement
of every habitable portion of the western states, the present
generation of readers welcomes with interest the personal reminiscences
of those who figured in such epoch-making events. The death
of
Col.
William F. Cody, more widely known as Buffalo Bill, marks
the passing of the most famous and picturesque character of his time.
In his autobiography entitled
Buffalo Billâs Own Story
published by
John R. Stanton, 1917, we have a vivid and in many respects an
historical work of no slight importance. Mr. William Lightfoot
Visscher who for two score years was a boon companion of Colonel
Cody adds a chapter dealing with the incidents attending the last
days of the noted pioneer, and an account of his death and burial. No
man in all America could approach Colonel Cody in popularizing
the events that played so prominent a part in the passing of the
Indian and the westward migration of the whites. As scout, Pony
express rider, Indian fighter, law maker, and showman he became an
international character, and the dramatic events that marked such
a career have passed from the active stage of western history.

The September, 1917 issue of the
Georgia Historical Quarterly

has as its leading article a biographical sketch of Mrs. Eleanor
Kinzie Gordon, of Savannah, recently deceased, granddaughter of
John Kinzie, the well-known Indian trader of early Chicago. Mrs.
Gordonâs father, John Harris Kinzie, was sub-Indian agent for the
Winnebago, stationed at Fort Winnebago for several years prior to
1834. To this frontier fort her mother, a cultivated New England
girl, was brought as a bride in the year 1830. She is best known to
later times by her charming book
Wau Bun
, a semi-historical narrative
of family traditions and personal experiences in the early northwest.
Its contents deal for the most part with the authorâs life at
Fort Winnebago and the book may fairly be regarded as a classic
of early Wisconsin literature. Mrs. Gordon, the daughter, was
born in Chicago in 1835. In early womanhood she married a citizen
of Georgia and so for upwards of sixty years her home has been
in that state.

Pg 227

Within the last few years Henry Ford has won for himself
a place in the heart of the American public fairly comparable to
that achieved long since by Thomas A. Edison, who, like Ford, was a
Michigan boy. A good biography of Ford would be welcomed, we
believe by thousands of Americans, not including those who own
Ford cars. âHenry Fordâs Own Storyâ as told to Rose Wilder
Lane (New York, 1917) is a hastily constructed narrative put together
in characteristic reportorial fashion and frankly laudatory in
character. Nevertheless it presents the essential facts about the
noted manufacturerâs career, reads interestingly, and should at least
serve to whet the appetite of the reading public for a biography
which should be really worthy of its unique subject.

Bulletin of Information
No.
87 of the Society, which has recently
come from the press, is an account of âThe Public Document
Division of the Wisconsin Historical Library.â The immediate
purpose of the bulletin is to serve as a guide to our own public document
division. The full treatment which the author (Mrs. Anna
W. Evans, chief of the document division of the library) has given
the subject of the bulletin, however, should render it a valuable
bibliographic aid to any library or student who has occasion to deal
with American or British public documents. Members and friends
of the Society will be pleased to know that our collection of public
documents is believed to be the best west of the Alleghanies and to
take high rank among the leading collections of the entire country.
In the treatise under discussion the author has especially sought to
emphasize the friendly, human qualities of the contents of the documents
entrusted to her care. She has fully succeeded in realizing
her aim.

A history of Sauk County, Wisconsin, it is understood, is shortly
to be issued by the Lewis Publishing Company of Chicago.

A Son of the Middle Border
, by Hamlin Garland, published
by the Macmillan Company of New York, is a narrative of unusual
interest to Wisconsin readers. In it the author tells the story of his
early life, first on a âcouleeâ farm in western Wisconsin, later as an
emigrant (with his parents) successively to northern Iowa and the
Dakotas. Many of those of maturer years who read the book will
find depicted in it with extraordinary clearness scenes and conditions
of a life, now largely vanished, which they themselves have shared in
earlier years.

A survey made by the United States Department of Agriculture
in December, 1916, on the number of silos in this country shows
that Wisconsin leads all other states in the Union. Out of a grand
total of 333,160, Wisconsin had 55,992. New York was second with

Pg 228

42,846. The past year saw several thousand more silos constructed
in Wisconsin, and the Agricultural Department of the State Council
of Defense estimates the number will now reach 60,000. The
average capacity of Wisconsin silos is 120 tons, while those of New
York average but 62 tons.

The State Historical Society of Iowa has begun the publication
of a series of pamphlets issued under the general caption
Iowa and
War
. The object of the Society is âto present in attractive form a
series of small pamphlets dealing with a variety of subjects relating
to interesting matters connected with the history of Iowa.â Volume
I, number 1, published in July is devoted to an account of âOld
Fort Snellingâ by Marcus L. Hansen. Old Fort Snelling belongs
to the Upper Mississippi Valley in general and Mr. Hansenâs account
of it should possess as much interest for citizens of Wisconsin
as for those of Iowa. âEnlistments from Iowa during the Civil War,â
by John E. Biggs is published in
No.
2 for August.
No.
3, for September,
contains an account of âThe Iowa Civil War Loan,â written
by Ivan L. Pollock.

Since the declaration of war by the United States upon Germany,
the study of military history in this country has practically monopolized
the attention of historical investigators. The leading article
in the
Iowa Journal of History and Politics
for July, 1917, deals
with âEnlistments during the Civil War.â Like Wisconsin and other
northern states, Iowa found herself utterly unprepared for a war.
The writer states that at the beginning of the conflict in 1861,
there was not a single unit of the regular army in Iowa, nor were
there any forts or garrisons. There was not a military post in the
state and the nearest arsenal was in
St.
Louis. A discussion of the
draft and its administration in Iowa forms a valuable part of the
study.

C. W. Johnston, a Des Moines lawyer of thirty years standing,
âconcluded to discontinue and enter upon a period of travel.â

Along the Pacific by Land and Sea
(Chicago, 1916) contains a series
of breezy letters which he wrote back to the Des Moines
Register
and Leader
. They contain the reactions of this son of the Middle
West toward the new environment afforded by a visit, apparently
his first, to various cities on the Pacific coast. Through dint of
reiterated remarks on the subject the reader leaves the book with
the not entirely valid conviction that one of the âcertaintiesâ for
which Des Moines bears the palm among her sister cities is that of
being the dirtiest place in the United States.

The importance of religious denominations in the growth of
our State and national history is being recognized more and more

Pg 229

by historical students. In the
Indiana Magazine of History
, June,
1917, appears an interesting article by
Rev.
Elmo A. Robinson
entitled âUniversalism in Indiana.â While the writer deals primarily
with the growth of that denomination in Indiana, yet mention
is also made of the influences of Universalism in the other states of
the Old Northwest. A review of the proceedings of the Northwest
Conference of Universalists shows that the Wisconsin delegates figured
prominently in the activities of this denomination.

A WISCONSIN WOMANâS PICTURE OF PRESIDENT
LINCOLN

Cordelia A. P. Harvey

Hundreds of loyal women labored devotedly during the
Civil War ministering to the needs of the northern soldiers.
Of them all, none worked more effectively or earned a larger
measure of appreciation and devotion on the part of those she
served than Mrs. Cordelia A. P. Harvey, wife of Governor
Lewis Harvey of Wisconsin. After his tragic death by
drowning at Savannah, Tennessee, while engaged in a mission
of mercy to Wisconsinâs wounded soldiers, Mrs. Harvey conceived
the idea that it was her duty to carry forward the work
that her husband had left unfinished. In September, 1862,
Governor Salomon appointed her sanitary agent at
St.
Louis,
and until the end of the war she continued in this service.
Some idea of her methods and of their effectiveness may be
gained from the narrative which follows. What the soldiers
thought of her is sufficiently indicated by the title âThe Angel
of Wisconsin,â which they bestowed upon her.

The narrative we print is from Mrs. Harveyâs typewritten
copy of a lecture which she delivered following the close of
the war. This manuscript the owner, Mrs. James Selkirk of
Clinton, Wisconsin, permitted the Wisconsin History Commission
to copy a few years since, and it was made the basis,
in large part, of chapters
VIII and IX
of Hurnâs
Wisconsin
Women in the War between the States
, published by the commission
in 1911. Prior to this the portion of the paper pertaining
to President Lincoln was drawn upon by J. G.
Holland in preparing his life of Lincoln. Thus the paper has
twice been drawn upon freely for publication. Notwithstanding
this, the complete story in Mrs. Harveyâs own words is
sufficiently interesting and important to justify its publication

Pg 234

at this time. In the preparation of the narrative for
publication a few changes in punctuation and typography
have been made, and one paragraph, clearly interpolated for
the benefit of the lecturerâs younger hearers, has been deleted.
These things aside, the story is now printed for the first time
just as Mrs. Harvey composed it.

*  *  *  *  *

Perhaps it is not well to open too frequently the deep
wells of past sorrow that we may drink the bitter draughts
which memory offers. Still, we would not forget the past—our
glorious past—with all its terrible trials, its untold sufferings,
its unwritten history. The Christian never forgets the
dying groans on Calvary that gave to him his soulâs salvation;
neither can an American citizen forget the great price paid
for the life and liberty of this nation. Next to love of God is
love of country.

It is not my object to awaken any morbid feelings of
sentimental sorrow, or to open again the deep wounds which
time has healed. Neither do I wish to serve up to an unhealthy
imagination a dish of fearful horrors from which a
healthy organization must turn away. I would only ask you
to look at the shadows a little while, that the life and light of
peace and plenty which now fill our land may by contrast
impress upon your hearts a picture more beautiful than any
artist could place on canvas. Shadows always make the light
more beautiful.

In the fall of 1862 I found myself in Cape Girardeau,
where hospitals were being improvised for the immediate use
of the sick and dying then being brought in from the swamps
by the returning regiments and up the rivers in closely
crowded hospital boats. These hospitals were mere sheds
filled with cots as thick as they could stand, with scarcely room
for one person to pass between them. Pneumonia, typhoid,
and camp fevers, and that fearful scourge of the southern
swamps and rivers, chronic diarrhea, occupied every bed. A

Pg 235

surgeon once said to me, âThere is nothing else there: here
I see pneumonia, and there fever, and on that cot another
disease, and I see nothing else! You had better stay away;
the air is full of contagion, and contagion and sympathy do
not go well together.â

One day a woman passed through these uncomfortable,
illy-ventilated, hot, unclean, infected, wretched rooms, and
she saw something else there. A hand reached out and
clutched her dress. One caught her shawl and kissed it,
another her hand, and pressed it to his fevered cheek; another
in wild delirium, cried, âI want to go home! I want to go
home! Lady! Lady! Take me in your chariot, take me
away!â This was a fair-haired, blue-eyed boy of the South,
who had left family and friends forever; obeying his countryâs
call, he enlisted under the stars and stripes because he could
not be a traitor. He was therefore disowned, and was now
dying among strangers with his mother and sisters not twenty
miles away; and they knew that he was dying and would not
come to him. Father, forgive them, they knew not what they
did.

As this woman passed, these âdiseases,â as the surgeon
called them, whispered and smiled at each other, and even
reached out and took hold of each othersâ hands, saying, âShe
will take us home, I know her; she will not leave us here to die,â
not dreaming that hovering just above them was a white
robed one, who in a short time would take them to their
heavenly home.

This woman failed to see on these cots aught but the
human [beings] they were to her, the sons, brothers, husbands,
and fathers of anxious weeping ones at home; and as such
she cared for and thought of them. Arm in arm with health,
she visited day by day every suffererâs cot, doing, it is true,
very little, but always taking with her from the outside world
fresh air, fresh flowers, and all the hope and comfort she
could find in her heart to give them. Now and then one would

Pg 236

totter forth into the open air, his good constitution having
overcome disease, and the longings for life so strong within
him that he grasped at straws, determined to live. If perchance
he could get a furlough, in a few weeks a strong man
would return and greet you with, âHow do you do, I am on
my way to my regiment!â Who this stranger might be,
you could never imagine until reminded by him of the skeleton
form and trembling steps you had so recently watched going
to the landing, homeward bound. But if, as was too frequently
the case, he was sent to convalescent camps, in a few
weeks he was returned to hospital, and again to camp, and
thus continued to vibrate between camp and hospital until
hope and life were gone. This was the fate of thousands.

On a steamer from Cape Girardeau to Helena at table one
day when the passengers were dining, among whom were
several military officers, I heard a young major of the regular
army very coolly remark that it was much cheaper for the
government to keep her sick soldiers in hospitals on the river
than to furlough them. A lady present quietly replied,
âThat is true, Major, if all were faithful to the government,
but unfortunately a majority of the surgeons in the army
have conscientious scruples, and verily believe it to be their
duty to keep these sick men alive as long as possible. To be
sure, their uneaten rations increased the hospital fund and
so enabled your surgeons generously to provide all needed
delicacies for the sick, but the pay was drawn by the soldiers
from the government all the same. Donât you think, Sir,
it would be a trifle more economical,â continued the lady, âto
send these poor fellows north for a few weeks, to regain their
strength, that they might return at once to active service?â
The laughter of his brother officers prevented my hearing his
reply.

This young officer was the medical director at Helena,
where I found over two thousand graves of Northeners.
Two-thirds of these men might have been saved, could they

Pg 237

have been sent north. The surgeon in charge of the general
hospital, when asked why he did not furlough some of the men
from his over-crowded hospitals, replied that he had at one
time and another made out certificates of disability for furlough
for nearly every man in his hospital and for hundreds
who rested on the nearby hill, but when sent for the signature
and approval of the medical director, they had invariably been
returned, disapproved; that he had also permitted the men
themselves to go with their papers, only to have them severely
reproved and ordered back to hospital, and, said he, with tears
in his eyes, âmany of them never returned, for, broken-hearted,
they have lain down by the roadside and died.â

I once heard a person who had been instrumental in giving
a dying boy back to his mother, that she might nurse him
back to life, relate how it was done. The mother had succeeded
in getting her son as far as
St.
Louis where his papers
were to be sent. They came in the usual way to the medical
director, were all wrong, of course—not made out according
to army regulations and must therefore be returned to his
regiment, which was somewhere with Sherman and could not
be reached. The mother received the papers with that fearful
word âdisapprovedâ written upon them. There was nothing
to do but to place her sick son in a
St.
Louis hospital, and
leave him there to die; she must return to her family. She
told her story with streaming eyes and a broken heart. The
woman impulsively said, âGive me the papers,â and off she
went to the medical directorâs office. He was a man full six
feet high, over fifty years of age, a head like Oliver Cromwellâs,
a face stern as fate, and of the regular army. She
entered his presence, seated herself, and waited to be spoken
to.

Soon it came with, âWhat do you want?â

âTo talk with you a moment, General,â she replied.

âNo time for talking.â

âI will wait,â she said.

Pg 238

He wrote a few moments, then said, âMay as well hear
it now as ever—what is it?â

âI would like to ask you if you had a son in this volunteer
service, sent up from the South as far as
St.
Louis, sick and
like to die, and some ignorant, careless officer had made out
his furlough papers wrong—â

âWhat do you want!â

â—would you not be glad, if you were away, if your poor
boy could find a friend?â

âWhat do you want, I say? This is nothing to the
purpose.â

âDo you not think that friend ought to do all she could
to save your boy?â

âWhat is all this nonsense?â

âOnly this: a poor mother is at the Soldiersâ Home with
her dying son. The physicians say he may live if he is sent
north, but will surely die if left here. His furlough papers
have been sent on, and I have seen them, and know they are
wrong. His regiment is with Sherman on the march. Cannot
something be done for the boy—for his mother?â

âWe have the army regulations, we cannot go behind
them. You know if I do, they will rap me over the knuckles
at Washington.â

âOh, that your knuckles were mine. I would be willing
to have them skinned; the skin would grow again, you know.â

âWhere are these papers?â he said sharply.

âI have them here in my pocket.â

âLet me see them.â

The woman took them slowly out, blank side upwards,
and gave them to him. He turned them and his face flushed
as he said, âWhy I have had these papers and disapproved
them. This is my signature.â

She replied tremblingly, âI knew it, but forgive me. I
thought maybe when you knew about it, General—and the
mother was weeping with the skeleton arms of her boy around

Pg 239

her neck—I thought maybe you would do something or tell
me something to do.â

âSuppose I do approve these papers, it will do no good.
The general in command will stop them and censure me.â

âBut you will have done all you could and have obeyed
the higher law.â

In the meantime this truly noble man had firmly crossed
out his own words and signature, and rewritten under it words
of approval, and in a quick, husky tone, said, âTake it and
donât you come here again today.â As the woman raised
her eyes to thank him, she saw a scowl on his brow, but a
smile on his lips, and a tear in his eye.

âThe general in command,â said she in relating the story,
ânever went behind the medical directorâs signature. The
boy started for home that night with his mother, full of hope.â

Not long after this an incident occurred showing how
easily man yields to the higher law when once he makes
humanity his standpoint. An erring boy of nineteen, who
had deserted from a Minnesota regiment, changed his name,
enlisted in the gunboat service from which he again deserted,
again changed his name, and enlisted in a Wisconsin regiment,
a little unsteady to be sure, but still a soldier. He was
wounded in a battle, honorably discharged from the service,
and paid off. On Saturday night he reached
St.
Louis
and found his way to one of her lowest dens, was drugged and
robbed of everything he possessed. On Monday he was
found tossing from side to side stricken by disease. His
surroundings were terrible, and he was lying on an old, filthy
mattress which had been thrown into the open hall by the
frightened inmates. He was screaming with pain and was at
times delirious. As soon, however, as he heard the soothing
tones of a human voice, and recognized the hand of kindness
on his burning brow, he cried, âMother! Oh, Mother, forgive
me, God forgive me! I have sinned. What shall I do! What
shall I do!â Conscience and disease were doing their work.

Pg 240

Softly speaking to him words of comfort and hope, our
friend released herself from his grasp, promising to return
in half an hour to take him away. This was easier said than
done. This soldier was now a citizen, and could not, therefore,
be admitted into a military hospital. His disease was
of such a nature that in all probability he must die—but his
widowed mother, far away, must she know that her darling
soldier had died in such a place? God forbid! An order
must be had to place him in a military hospital.

The woman goes to her old friend, the medical director,
and tells her story in as few words as possible, saying, âGeneral,
write an order quick to the surgeon in charge of the Fifth
Street hospital, that the boy may be received. I also want
an ambulance, mattress, and bedding, and some men to help
me move him.â

âYes, yes, but listen, I have no right, I canât do it.â

âI know—I know, but please do hurry—I promised to be
back in half an hour, and the boy will expect me.â

The general, calling a boy and imitating her voice, said,
âHurry, hurry, boy! Get the best ambulance we have, a good
mattress and bedding, and some men and go with Madame
and do whatever she bids you to do. Here is the order, what
else do you want? Henceforth we do what you wish and no
questions asked. It is the easiest way and I guess the only
way to get along with you.â The mother mourned her sonâs
death, but not his disgrace. In after months, this worthy
officer by daring to take responsibility performed many acts
which will gladden his dying hours.

In this way, one could be snatched from suffering and
death now and then, but Oh! the thousands that were beyond
the reach of human aid, and the numbers that no private
individual power could help—only the great military power!
This conviction first led to the thought of providing, if possible,
some place where invalids could be sent north, without
the trouble of furloughs. The idea of northern military hospitals

Pg 241

seemed practicable and so natural that we never once
thought the authorities would oppose the movement. For
nearly a year this question was agitated and urged with all
the force that logic, position, and influence could bring to
bear; but all in vain. Hope was well nigh dead within us.

This depression in the South because of the utter failure
of the government to provide a way by which the enfeebled
soldiers might be restored to strength at last suggested the
thought of going directly to the head, to the President. By
sending it up by one authority and another, by this officer
and that one, we began to feel that the message lost the flavor
of truth, and got cold before it reached the deciding power;
and because it was so lukewarm he spued it out of his mouth.
It is always best if you wish to secure an object, if you have
a certain purpose to accomplish, to go at once to the highest
power, be your own petitioner, in temporal as in spiritual
matters, officiate at your own altar, be your own priest.

I am going to give you another chapter in my own experience,
as it was, if I can do so, without the least coloring.
There is not a more difficult task than that of relating simple
facts in such a manner as to convey an entirely correct impression.
The difficulty is increased when the relator is an
interested party. I trust I shall not be accused of egotism if
I give the exact conversations between Mr. Lincoln and myself,
as taken down at the time, for in no other way can I
so well picture to you our much loved and martyred president
as he then appeared at the White House. As I said before,
the necessity for establishing military hospitals in the North
had long been a subject of much thought among our people,
but it was steadily opposed by the authorities.

By the advice of friends and with an intense feeling that
something must be done, I went to Washington. I entered
the White House, not with fear and trembling, but strong
and self-possessed, fully conscious of the righteousness of my
mission. I was received without delay. I had never seen Mr.

Pg 242

Lincoln before. He was alone, in a medium sized office-like
room, no elegance about him, no elegance in him. He was
plainly clad in a suit of black that illy fitted him. No fault
of his tailor, however; such a figure could not be fitted. He
was tall and lean, and as he sat in a folded up sort of way in
a deep arm chair, one would almost have thought him deformed.
At his side stood a high writing desk and table combined;
plain straw matting covered the floor; a few stuffed
chairs and sofa covered with green worsted completed the
furniture of the presence chamber of the president of this
great republic. When I first saw him his head was bent forward,
his chin resting on his breast, and in his hand a letter
which I had just sent in to him.

He raised his eyes, saying, âMrs. Harvey?â

I hastened forward, and replied, âYes, and I am glad to
see you, Mr. Lincoln.â So much for republican presentations
and ceremony. The President took my hand, hoped I was
well, but there was no smile of welcome on his face. It was
rather the stern look of the judge who had decided against
me. His face was peculiar; bone, nerve, vein, and muscle were
all so plainly seen; deep lines of thought and care were around
his mouth and eyes. The word âjusticeâ came into my mind,
as though I could read it upon his face—I mean that extended
sense of the word that comprehends the practice of every
virtue which reason prescribes and society should expect. The
debt we owe to God, to man, to ourselves, when paid, is but
a simple act of justice, a duty performed. This attribute
seemed the source of Mr. Lincolnâs strength. He motioned
me to a chair. I sat, and silently read his face while he was
reading a paper written by one of our senators, introducing
me and my mission. When he had finished reading this he
looked up, ran his fingers through his hair, well silvered,
though the brown then predominated; his beard was more
whitened.

Pg 243

In a moment he looked at me with a good deal of sad
severity and said, âMadam, this matter of northern hospitals
has been talked of a great deal, and I thought it was settled,
but it seems not. What have you got to say about it?â

âOnly this, Mr. Lincoln, that many soldiers in our western
army on the Mississippi River must have northern air or die.
There are thousands of graves all along our southern rivers
and in the swamps for which the government is responsible,
ignorantly, undoubtedly, but this ignorance must not continue.
If you will permit these men to come north you will
have ten men where you have one now.â

The president could not see the force or logic in this last
argument. He shrugged his shoulders and said, âIf your
reasoning were correct, it would be a good argument.â I
saw that I had misspoken. âI donât see how,â he continued,
âsending one sick man north is going to give us in a year ten
well ones.â

A quizzical smile played over his face at my slight embarrassment.
âMr. Lincoln, you understand me, I think. I
intended to say, if you will let the sick come north, you will
have ten well men in the army one year from today, where
you have one well one now; whereas, if you do not let them
come north, you will not have one from the ten, for they will
all be dead.â

âYes, yes, I understand you; but if they are sent north,
they will desert; where is the difference?â

âDead men cannot fight,â I answered, âand they may not
desert.â

Mr. Lincolnâs eye flashed as he replied, âA fine way, a fine
way to decimate the army, we should never get a man of them
back, not one, not one.â

âIndeed, but you must pardon me when I say you are mistaken;
you do not understand our people. You do not trust
them sufficiently. They are as true and as loyal to the government

Pg 244

as you say. The loyalty is among the common soldiers
and they have ever been the chief sufferers.â

âThis is your opinion,â he said with a sort of a sneer.
âMrs. Harvey, how many men do you suppose the government
was paying in the Army of the Potomac at the battle of
Antietam, and how many men do you suppose could be got
for active service at that time? I wish you would give a
guess.â

âI know nothing of the Army of the Potomac, only there
were some noble sacrifices there. When I spoke of loyalty, I
referred to our western army.â

âWell, now, give a guess. How many?â

âI cannot, Mr. President.â

He threw himself around in the chair, one leg over the arm,
and again spoke slowly: âThis war might have been finished
at that time if every man had been in his place that was able
to be there, but they were scattered hither and thither over
the North, some on furloughs, and in one way or another,
gone; so that out of 170,000 men which the government was
paying at that time, only 83,000 could be got for action. The
consequences, you know, proved nearly disastrous.â

âIt was very sad but the delinquents were certainly not
in northern hospitals, neither were they deserters therefrom,
for there are none. This is, therefore, no argument against
them.â

âWell, well, Mrs. Harvey, you go and see the Secretary
of War and talk with him and hear what he has to say.â This
he said thoughtfully, and took up the letter I had given him,
and after writing something on the back of it gave it to me.

âMay I return to you, Mr. Lincoln?â I asked.

âCertainly,â he replied, and his voice was gentler than it
had been before.

I left him for the war department. I found written on
the back of the letter these words, âAdmit Mrs. Harvey at
once; listen to what she says; she is a lady of intelligence

Pg 245

and talks sense. A. Lincoln.â Not, of course, displeased
with the introduction, I went on my way to Mr. Stanton, our
secretary of war, about whose severity I had heard so much
that I must confess I dreaded the interview; but I was kindly
received, listened to respectfully, and answered politely. And
let me say here, as a passing tribute to this great and good
man, that I never knew a clearer brain, a truer heart, a nobler
spirit than Edwin M. Stanton. I have watched him by the
hour, listening to and deciding questions of minor moment
as well as those of greater importance—those upon which the
fate of the nation depended, and yet he never wavered. Quick
to see the right, he never hesitated to act. His foresight and
his strength seemed at times more than human. His place as
a statesman will not be filled in this century.

But to return to my interview with him. After understanding
the object for which I came, he told me he had sent
the Surgeon-General to New Orleans with directions to come
up the river and examine all hospitals. In short, I understood
he had started on a tour of inspection, which meant nothing
at all so far as the suffering was concerned. I told Mr.
Stanton, âOur western hospitals have never received any
benefit from these inspections, and we have very little confidence
that any good would result from them. Any person
with discernment, with a medium allowance of common
sense and humanity, who is loyal, and has been through our
southern river hospitals, knows and feels the necessity for
what I ask, and yet you say you have never received a report
to this effect. The truth is, the medical authorities know the
heads of departments do not wish hospitals established so far
away from army lines, and report accordingly. I wish this
could be overruled; can nothing be done?â

âNothing, until the Surgeon-General returns,â Mr. Stanton
replied.

âGood morning,â I said, and left him, not at all disappointed.

Pg 246

Returning to Mr. Lincoln, I found it was past the usual
hour for receiving and no one was in the waiting-room. The
messenger said I had better go directly into the Presidentâs
room. It would be more comfortable waiting there, and there
was only one gentleman with him and he would soon be
through. I found my way to the back part of the room, and
seated myself on a sofa in such a position that the desk was
between Mr. Lincoln and me. I do not think that he knew
I was there. The gentleman with him had given him a paper.
The President looked at it carefully and said, âYes, this is
sufficient endorsement for anybody; what do you want?â

I could not hear the reply distinctly, but the promotion
of somebody in the army, either a son or a brother, was
strongly urged. I heard the words, âI see there are no
vacancies among brigadiers, from the fact that so many
colonels are commanding brigades.â

At this the President threw himself forward in his chair
in such a manner as to show me the most curious, comical face
in the world. He was looking the man straight in the eye,
with the left hand raised to a horizontal position, and his
right hand patting it coaxingly, and said, âMy friend, let
me tell you something; you are a farmer, I believe; if not,
you will understand me. Suppose you had a large cattle
yard, full of all sorts of cattle, cows, oxen, and bulls, and you
kept selling your cows and oxen, taking good care of your
bulls; bye and bye, you would find that you had nothing but
a yard full of old bulls, good for nothing under heaven, and
it will be just so with my army if I donât stop making
brigadier generals.â The man was answered; he could scarcely
laugh, though he tried to do so, but you should have seen
Mr. Lincoln laugh—he laughed all over, and fully enjoyed
the point if no one else did. The story, if not elegant, was
certainly apropos.

As I commenced to tell you everything I remember of
this singular man, this must fill its place. The gentleman

Pg 247

soon departed, fully satisfied, I doubt not, for it was a saying
at Washington when one met a petitioner, âHas Mr. Lincoln
told you a story? If he has, it is all day with you. He never
says 'yesâ after a story.â

I stepped forward as soon as the door closed. The President
motioned to a chair near him. âWell, what did the Secretary
of War say?â

I gave a full account of the interview, and then said, âI
have nowhere else to go but to you.â

He replied earnestly, âMr. Stanton knows very well that
there is an acting surgeon-general here, and that Hammond
will not be back these two months. I will see the Secretary
of War myself, and you come in the morning.â

I arose to take leave, when he bade me not to hasten, spoke
kindly of my work, said he fully appreciated the spirit in
which I came. He smiled pleasantly and bade me good evening.

As I left the White House, I met Owen Lovejoy who
greeted me cordially and asked, âHow long are you going to
stay here?â

âUntil I get what I came after,â I replied.

âThatâs right, thatâs right; go on, I believe in the final
perseverance of the saints.â

I have never forgotten these words, perhaps it is because
they were the last I ever heard him utter.

I returned in the morning, full of hope, thinking of the
pleasant face I had left the evening before, but no smile
greeted me. The President was evidently annoyed by something,
and waited for me to speak, which I did not do. I
afterward learned his annoyance was caused by a woman
pleading for the life of a son who was sentenced to be shot for
desertion under very aggravating circumstances.

After a moment he said, âWell,â with a peculiar contortion
of face I never saw in anybody else.

Pg 248

I replied, âWell,â and he looked at me a little astonished,
I fancied, and said, âHave you nothing to say?â

âNothing, Mr. President, until I hear your decision. You
bade me come this morning; have you decided?â

âNo, but I believe this idea of northern hospitals is a
great humbug, and I am tired of hearing about it.â He spoke
impatiently.

I replied, âI regret to add a featherâs weight to your
already overwhelming care and responsibility. I would rather
have stayed at home.â

With a kind of half smile, he said, âI wish you had.â

I answered him as though he had not smiled. âNothing
would have given me greater pleasure; but a keen sense of
duty to this government, justice and mercy to its most loyal
supporters, and regard for your honor and position made me
come. The people cannot understand why their friends are
left to die when with proper care they might live and do good
service for their country. Mr. Lincoln, I believe you will
be grateful for my coming.â He looked at me intently; I
could not tell if he were annoyed or not, and as he did not
speak, I continued: âI do not come to plead for the lives of
criminals, not for the lives of deserters, not for those who
have been in the least disloyal. I come to plead for the lives
of those who were the first to hasten to the support of this
government, who helped to place you where you are, because
they trusted you. Men who have done all they could, and
now when flesh, and nerve, and muscle are gone, still pray
for your life and the life of this republic. They scarcely ask
for that for which I plead—they expect to sacrifice their lives
for their country. Many on their cots, faint, sick, and dying,
say, 'We would gladly do more, but I suppose that is all
right.â I know that a majority of them would live and be
strong men again if they could be sent north. I say I know,
because when I was sick among them last spring, surrounded
by every comfort, with the best of care, and determined to

Pg 249

get well, I grew weaker day by day, until, not being under
military law, my friends brought me north. I recovered
entirely, simply by breathing northern air.â

While I was speaking the expression of Mr. Lincolnâs
face had changed many times. He had never taken his eye
from me. Now every muscle in his face seemed to contract,
and then suddenly expand. As he opened his mouth you
could almost hear them snap as he said, âYou assume to know
more than I do,â and closed his mouth as though he never
expected to open it again, sort of slammed it to.

I could scarcely reply. I was hurt, and thought the tears
would come, but rallied in a moment and said, âYou must
pardon me, Mr. President, I intend no disrespect, but it is
because of this knowledge, because I do know what you do
not know, that I come to you. If you knew what I do and
had not ordered what I ask for, I should know that an appeal
to you would be vain; but I believe the people have not trusted
you for naught. The question only is whether you believe me
or not. If you believe me you will give me hospitals, if not,
well--â

With the same snapping of muscle he again said, âYou
assume to know more than surgeons do.â

âOh, no! Mr. Lincoln, I could not perform an amputation
nearly as well as some of them do; indeed, I do not
think I could do it at all. But this is true—I do not come
here for your favor, I am not an aspirant for military honor.
While it would be the pride of my life to be able to win your
respect and confidence, still, this I can waive for the time
being. Now the medical authorities know as well as I do that
you are opposed to establishing northern military hospitals,
and they report to please you; they desire your favor. I come
to you from no casual tour of inspection, passing rapidly
through the general hospitals, in the principal cities on the
river, with a cigar in my mouth and a rattan in my hand,
talking to the surgeon in charge of the price of cotton and

Pg 250

abusing the generals in our army for not knowing and performing
their duty better, and finally coming into the open
air, with a long-drawn breath as though just having escaped
suffocation, and complacently saying, 'You have a very fine
hospital here; the boys seem to be doing very well, a little more
attention to ventilation is perhaps desirable.â

âIt is not thus; I have visited the hospitals, but from early
morning until late at night sometimes. I have visited the
regimental and general hospitals on the Mississippi River
from Quincy to Vicksburg, and I come to you from the cots
of men who have died, who might have lived had you permitted.
This is hard to say, but it is none the less true.â

During the time that I had been speaking Mr. Lincolnâs
brow had become very much contracted, and a severe scowl
had settled over his whole face. He sharply asked how many
men Wisconsin had in the field, that is, how many did she
send? I replied, âAbout 50,000, I think, I do not know
exactly.â

âThat means she has about 20,000 now.â He looked at
me, and said, âYou need not look so sober, they are not all
dead.â

I did not reply. I had noticed the veins in his face filling
full within a few moments, and one vein across his forehead
was as large as my little finger, and it gave him a frightful
look.

Soon, with a quick, impatient movement of his whole
frame, he said, âI have a good mind to dismiss every man of
them from the service and have no more trouble with them!â

I was surprised at his lack of self-control, and I knew
he did not mean one word of what he said, but what would
come next? As I looked at him, I was troubled, fearing I
had said something wrong. He was very pale.

The silence was painful, and I said as quietly as I could,
âThey have been faithful to the government; they have been
faithful to you; they will still be loyal to the government,

Pg 251

do what you will with them; but if you will grant my petition
you will be glad as long as you live. The prayer of
grateful hearts will give you strength in the hour of trial,
and strong and willing arms will return to fight your battles.â

The President bowed his head, and with a look of sadness
I can never forget, said, âI never shall be glad any more.â
All severity had passed from his face. He seemed looking
backward and heartward, and for a moment he seemed to
forget he was not alone; a more than mortal anguish rested
on his face.

The spell must be broken, so I said, âDo not speak so,
Mr. President. Who will have so much reason to rejoice
when the government is restored, as it will be?â

âI know, I know,â he said, placing a hand on each side
and bowing forward, âbut the springs of life are wearing
away.â

I asked if he felt his great cares were injuring his health.

âNo,â he replied, ânot directly, perhaps.â

I asked if he slept well, and he said he never was a good
sleeper, and, of course, slept less now than ever before. He
said the people did not yet appreciate the magnitude of this
rebellion, and that it would be a long time before the end.

I began to feel I was occupying time valuable to him and
belonging to him. As I arose to take leave, I said, âHave you
decided upon your answer to the object of my visit?â

He replied, âNo. Come tomorrow morning. No, it is
[cabinet] meeting tomorrow—yes, come tomorrow at twelve
oâclock, there is not much for the cabinet to do tomorrow.â
He arose and bade me a cordial goodmorning.

The next morning I arose with a terribly depressed feeling
that perhaps I was to fail in the object for which I came.
I found myself constantly looking at my watch and wondering
if twelve oâclock would ever come. At last I ascended
the steps of the White House as all visitors were being dismissed,
because the President would receive no one on that

Pg 252

day. I asked the messenger if that meant me, and he said,
âNo. The President desires you to wait for the cabinet
will soon adjourn.â I waited, and waited, and waited,
three long hours and more, during which time the President
sent out twice, saying the cabinet would soon adjourn, that I
was to wait. I was fully prepared for defeat, and every
word of my reply was chosen and carefully placed. I walked
the rooms and studied an immense map that covered one side
of the reception room. I listened, and at last heard many
footsteps—the cabinet had adjourned. Mr. Lincoln did
not wait to send for me but came directly into the room where
I was. It was the first time I had noticed him standing.
He was very tall and moved with a shuffling, awkward motion.

He came forward, rubbing his hands, and saying, âMy
dear Madam, I am very sorry to have kept you waiting.
We have but this moment adjourned.â

I replied, âMy waiting is no matter, but you must be
very tired, and we will not talk tonight.â

He said, âNo. Sit down,â and placed himself in a chair
beside me, and said, âMrs. Harvey, I only wish to tell you
that an order equivalent to granting a hospital in your state
has been issued nearly twenty-four hours.â

I could not speak, I was so entirely unprepared for it.
I wept for joy, I could not help it. When I could speak I
said, âGod bless you. I thank you in the name of thousands
who will bless you for the act.â Then, remembering how
many orders had been issued and countermanded, I said,
âDo you mean, really and truly, that we are going to have
a hospital now?â

With a look full of humanity and benevolence, he said,
âI do most certainly hope so.â He spoke very emphatically,
and no reference was made to any previous opposition. He
said he wished me to come and see him in the morning and
he would give me a copy of the order.

Pg 253

I was so much agitated I could not talk with him. He
noticed it and commenced talking upon other subjects. He
asked me to look at the map before referred to, which, he
said, gave a very correct idea of the locality of the principal
battle grounds of Europe. âIt is a fine map,â he said, pointing
out Waterloo and the different battle fields of the Crimea,
then, smiling, said, âI am afraid you will not like it as well
when I tell you whose work it is.â

I replied, âIt is well done, whosever it may be. Who
did it, Mr. Lincoln?â

âMcClellan, and he certainly did do this well. He did it
while he was at West Point.â There was nothing said for
awhile. Perhaps he was balancing in his own mind the two
words which were then agitating the heart of the American
people, words which have ever throbbed the great heart of
nations, words whose power every individual has recognized—âsuccess,â
and âfailure.â

I left shortly after with the promise to call next morning,
as he desired me to do, at nine oâclock. I suppose the
excitement caused the intense suffering of that night. I was
very ill and it was ten oâclock the next morning before I was
able to send for a carriage to keep my appointment with the
President. It was past the hour; more than fifty persons
were in the waiting room. I did not expect an audience,
but sent in my name and said I would call again. The messenger
said, âDo not go, I think the President will see you
now.â

I had been but a moment among anxious, expectant,
waiting faces, when the door opened and the voice said, âMrs.
Harvey, the President will see you now.â I arose, not a
little embarrassed to be gazed at so curiously by so many
with a look that said as plainly as words could, âWho are
you?â As I passed the crowd, one person said, âShe has been
here every day, and what is more, she is going to win.â

Pg 254

I entered the presence of Mr. Lincoln for the last time.
He smiled very graciously and drew a chair near him, and
said, âCome here and sit down.â He had a paper in his hand
which he said was for me to keep. It was a copy of the order
just issued. I thanked him, not only for the order but for
the manner and spirit in which it had been given, then said
I must apologize for not having been there at nine oâclock
as he desired me to be, but that I had been sick all night.

He looked up with, âDid joy make you sick?â

I said, âI donât know, very likely it was the relaxation
of nerve after intense excitement.â

Still looking at me he said, âI suppose you would have
been mad if I had said no?â

I replied, âNo, Mr. Lincoln, I should have been neither
angry nor sick.â

âWhat would you have done?â he asked curiously. âI
should have been here at nine oâclock, Mr. President.â

âWell,â he laughingly said, âI think I acted wisely, then,â
and suddenly looking up, âDonât you ever get angry?â he
asked, âI know a little woman not very unlike you who gets
mad sometimes.â

I replied, âI never get angry when I have an object to
gain of the importance of the one under consideration; to
get angry, you know, would only weaken my cause, and
destroy my influence.â

âThat is true, that is true,â he said, decidedly. âThis
hospital I shall name for you.â

I said, âNo, but if you would not consider the request
indelicate, I would like to have it named for Mr. Harvey.â

âYes, just as well, it shall be so understood if you prefer
it. I honored your husband, and felt his loss, and now let
us have this matter settled at once.â

He took a card and wrote a few words upon it, requesting
the Secretary of War to name the hospital âHarvey Hospital,â
in memory of my husband, and to gratify me he gave

Pg 255

me the card, saying, âNow do you take that directly to the
Secretary of War and have it understood.â I thanked him,
but did not take it to Mr. Stanton. The hospital was already
named. I expressed a wish that he might never regret his
present action, and said I was sorry to have taken so much
of his time.

âOh, no, you need not be,â he said kindly.

âYou will not wish to see me again, Mr. President.â

âI didnât say that and shall not.â

I said, âYou have been very kind to me and I am grateful
for it.â

He looked at me from under his eyebrows and said, âYou
almost think me handsome, donât you?â

His face then beamed with such kind benevolence and was
lighted by such a pleasant smile that I looked at him, and
with my usual impulse, said, clasping my hands together,
âYou are perfectly lovely to me, now, Mr. Lincoln.â He
colored a little and laughed most heartily.

As I arose to go, he reached out his hand, that hand in
which there was so much power and so little beauty, and held
mine clasped and covered in his own. I bowed my head and
pressed my lips most reverently upon the sacred shield, even
as I would upon my countryâs shrine. A silent prayer went
up from my heart, âGod bless you, Abraham Lincoln.â I
heard him say goodbye, and I was gone. Thus ended the
most interesting interview of my life with one of the most
remarkable men of the age.

My impressions of him had been so varied, his character
had assumed so many different phases, his very looks had
changed so frequently and so entirely, that it almost seemed
to me I had been conversing with half a dozen different men.
He blended in his character the most yielding flexibility with
the most unflinching firmness, child-like simplicity and weakness
with statesmanlike wisdom and masterly strength, but
over and around all was thrown the mantle of an unquestioned
integrity.

THE DUTCH SETTLEMENTS OF SHEBOYGAN
COUNTY

By Sipko F. Rederus

Dutch settlements have never been numerous in America
or in any other country not flying the Dutch flag. The
Hollanders, unlike their German and British neighbors, have
no natural inclination to roaming and adventure; and being
strongly attached to their native soil they have preferred
attempting to improve conditions at home to hazarding their
fortune in a foreign country. This love of country has
changed the Netherlands from a boggy land to a beautiful,
productive country with an intelligent, industrious, and artistic
people now numbering about six millions.

Unusual conditions, political, economic, and religious,
have, however, from time to time caused Hollanders to emigrate
to foreign lands, and during the decade 1840-50 many
set sail for the United States. After the fall of Napoleon
the Netherlands had changed from a republican to a limited
monarchical form of government. Belgium reunited with
Holland under the name of Kingdom of Netherlands, with
William I, son of the former Dutch stadtholder, as king.
The union was not successful, and the rebellion of 1830, which
resulted in the separation of Holland and Belgium, necessitated
large armies which William I kept up for years in the
hope of reconquering Belgium. Then in 1825 an inundation
of the ocean swept away the dikes, devastated the land, and
left thousands homeless and without resources. With the
abdication of William I and the accession of his son, William

II
, conditions did not improve. War and flood turned the
thoughts of the suffering lower and middle classes to emigration,
and the period from 1840 to 1850 saw the great exodus
of Dutch to America.

Religious difficulties arising at this time also caused the
emigration of several distinct groups. With the separation
of Holland from Spain came separation from the civil and
religious rule of the Catholic Church and the adoption of
the Reformed Church by the State. The Dutch Reformed
Church was Calvinistic in doctrine and Presbyterian in
government. German philosophy and French liberalism
gradually influenced the lives of members of the State
Church; and the monarch and other governmental officers
being friendly toward the new thought, the church synods
permitted certain changes in the service and doctrine. Again
and again the orthodox party tried to overthrow the new
order, and after many failures in such attempts left the established
church to form a separate ecclesiastical body called the
Free Separate Reformed Church.

The civil government, fearing that civil revolution would
follow this religious upheaval, opposed the new church, forbade
meetings, and fined ministers. With the accession of
William
II
the organization was recognized as a corporate
body, but many restrictions were imposed upon it and
financial aid, granted other denominations, was refused it.
A large number of the Separatists gladly accepted the terms
imposed, but others, smarting under the restrictions and foreseeing
no relief in the near future, resolved to emigrate to
America.

Three separate parties, each under a prominent minister,
were formed for the purpose of founding settlements in the
United States.
Rev.
R. C. Van Raalte led his people to the
eastern shore of Lake Michigan, where they founded settlements
which later came to be among the prosperous communities
of Michigan. Among them are Holland, where
Hope College was founded, Grand Haven, Muskegon, and
Grand Rapids.

Under
Rev.
H. P. Scholte a party of Dutch immigrants
went to southern Iowa and settled a large tract of land

Pg 258

purchased from the government. The city of Pella, where
Central College is located, is the center of a number of communities,
all of which have prosperous industries and beautiful
churches of the Reformed faith.

The party led by
Rev.
P. Zonne secured by purchase from
the government a section of country bordering on Lake
Michigan, some twenty miles south of the present city of
Sheboygan. The settlers arrived in the spring of 1847 after
a stormy voyage across the Atlantic, making the journey
inland by way of the Hudson River, Erie Canal, and Great
Lakes. In settling this region the Zonne party had been
preceded by other Dutch families. In 1844 Lawrence Zuvelt
and his family settled in a locality four and one-half miles
northwest of what later became the Zonne settlement, and
in 1846 they were joined by G. H. KoltsÃ©e and John Boland
and their families.

A tragic event marked the growth of this settlement.
In 1848 the
Mayflower
, filled with immigrants to Wisconsin,
including many Hollanders, had proceeded as far as Sheboygan
when fire was discovered. When, in spite of the
crewâs efforts, the flames seemed to be gaining headway, a
panic ensued, and many lost their lives in the fire or in the
water. Others were landed in pitiful condition on the shores
of Wisconsin. Three Hollanders, Wilterdenk, Oonk, and
Rensink by name, were among those rescued. Wilterdenk
had lost his wife and six children in the catastrophe.

The Zonne community rapidly overtook the earlier settlement
in size and development. Cedar Grove was the name
given it by Reverend Zonne, because cedar formed the
greatest part of the forest near by, in portions of which the
Indians still lived. The land was ideal for the painter, poet,
and hunter, but the matter-of-fact Hollanders, though
belonging to a race which had produced great artists, writers,
and explorers, had not come to dream, paint pictures, or
follow the chase. The land was valued by the settlers as a

Pg 259

means of material improvement; the forest was an obstacle
and had to be removed. The work of destruction went on
systematically from season to season, and in a short time large
clearings could be seen on which were planted maize, wheat,
and barley. All of these grains gave rich return, for the soil
was fertile and not easily exhausted.

Clearing the ground for the first crop, however, was a difficult
process. How to remove the trees after they had been
felled with such difficulty was a problem. The settlers could
not use all the wood for fuel nor could they convert the tree
trunks into lumber. To dispose of the superabundance of
wood, these pioneer farmers had to set it on fire, being careful
to remove the immense pile to a safe distance from the
forest and from the buildings already erected. The hardwood
tree stumps remaining in the fields after the trees had
been cut were a great obstacle to cultivation of the ground.
Digging the stumps out of the field was a long process, and
explosives or machinery for doing this work were not then
available.

The forest, however, was a help as well as a hindrance.
From the logs were made houses and barns, agricultural
implements, wagons, and, to some extent, furniture. The
forest possessed an abundance of game, wild blackberries,
strawberries, wild grapes, and maple trees from which the
settlers secured their sugar. Autumn brought a harvest of
hickorynuts and walnuts. Cattle thrived in the woodland,
and in certain parts flocks of sheep could be kept. From the
wool the housewife knitted stockings and wove the homespun
for the family clothing.

Communication with other settlements was extremely
difficult. For many years the Indian trails and the pathways
blazed by the settlers were the only roads, tortuous at all
times but almost impassable in winter. The principal trading
posts, such as Port Washington and Milwaukee, were far distant
from the Zonne settlement—Milwaukee being forty-five

Pg 260

miles away—and under the best circumstances the slow-moving
oxen made a long journey of it. Often the wagons
broke down in the middle of the forest and the men would
have to leave their loads in the road and go back home or to
the trading post ahead for assistance. The lack of communication
was felt most during sickness and especially epidemics,
for many a time the physician, after a long, hard journey,
would arrive to find his patient dead or beyond help.

Such were the difficulties with which these Dutch pioneers
contended during the first years of their colonization. Their
energy and perseverance, however, defeated one after another.
Gradually the farms were cleared, the newly established
sawmills turned out lumber for better houses and
barns;
water power was utilized for the running of flour mills;
and stores were established within easy distance. Artisans
joined the settlements, although blacksmiths had been found
among the original settlers. As the forest gradually disappeared,
old trails were widened, roads were laid out, villages
sprang up, and post offices were established.

But in the midst of their growing prosperity the black
war cloud gathered on the southern horizon and cast its
shadows over this peaceful community. Many of the men,
whose fathers had obtained liberty after eighty years of conflict,
were aroused, and leaving their plows took up the musket.
Sad times now followed, for now and then the news
reached the settlement that some son or father had died in
battle; but after the years of sorrow the laureled heroes
returned to their firesides and a greater prosperity dawned.

One of the men who was conspicuous in the conflict and
even more so in the days of peace that followed was Peter
Daan. He was born in the Netherlands, in the town of Westkapelle,
Province of Zeeland, March 26, 1835. When he
was seven years of age his parents emigrated to America and
settled in the town of Pultneyville, New York. Later the
family moved to Wisconsin and bought a farm in Sheboygan

Pg 261

County, near the present village of Oostburg. Peter Daan
was one of the first to volunteer on the outbreak of the war,
and through his influence and effort caused many to follow
his example. In 1867 he commenced his mercantile business
on the Sauk Trail, two and one-half miles east of Oostburg.
As that town developed, he moved his business there, built a
large store, an elevator, a steam flour mill, and later founded
the bank of which he became president. He held that office
until his death. The people, having confidence in his ability
and good judgment, several times elected him president of
the town. For years he held the office of justice of the peace,
and because of his amicable manner of settling disputes he
won the title among the people of âthe peacemaker.â

As a young man he became a member of the Presbyterian
Church, and later was made an elder, an office which he held
until he died. Several times his presbytery elected him delegate
to the higher ecclesiastical councils. In 1873 he was
chosen a member of the Wisconsin legislative assembly. His
death occurred June 14, 1914.

After the Civil War the settlements entered a period of
prosperity greater than any experienced before; in fact many
of the farmers, receiving high prices for their products during
the war, laid the foundation of their wealth in this period.
The villages of Oostburg and Cedar Grove expanded, and
the new town of Gibbsville was founded three miles west of
Oostburg. There a large flour mill, driven by water power,
was built, and remains in operation to this day. East of
Cedar Grove, on the lake shore, was built a pier where the
great vessels could land. The settlement of Amsterdam,
which developed here, became an important trading place for
a time but was abandoned when the Chicago and Northwestern
Railroad entered the territory. Oostburg and Cedar
Grove, in both of which stations were erected, received the
benefit of the improved communication. Grain elevators and
business houses of all kinds were erected, and residences

Pg 262

increased and improved. In the country better farmhouses
and more spacious barns rapidly replaced the primitive log
buildings. The acreage of land cleared, fenced in, and cultivated,
increased, and the herds of cattle and flocks of sheep
became more numerous. Along the lake shore a profitable
fishing industry was developed. Everywhere the result of
hard work and thrift was seen.
Luctor et emergo
(I struggle
and rise higher), the motto of the Province of Zeeland from
which these Dutch settlers had come, represented the achievements
of these people as well as those of their sturdy ancestors.

In the midst of their hard struggle for material improvement
these people had not been neglectful of religious matters.
Upon their arrival, under the leadership of Reverend
Zonne they had organized themselves into a church and
united with the Presbyterian organization. In the following
year, 1848, Reverend Zonne built a house of worship on his
own estate and gave it to his congregation. This church,
built about a mile north of the present site of Cedar Grove,
was the first of the Presbyterian denomination in that region.
In the course of time another house of worship was built in
the settlement later known as Cedar Grove by those who
were not in harmony with Reverend Zonne. This congregation
united with the old Dutch Reformed Church of America,
founded in New Amsterdam (now New York) in the eighteenth
century. This is the oldest and wealthiest (in proportion
to size) of all ecclesiastical bodies in America.

In 1853 another Presbyterian church was built four and
one-half miles north of Cedar Grove on the Sauk Trail.
Reverend Van de Schurn was the first pastor and Peter Daan
the first elder. This church with its large membership is
flourishing today under the pastorate of
Rev.
C. Van Griethuizen.
A Dutch Reformed church was later established at
the same place, and others of the same denomination were

Pg 263

erected in the settlement later becoming the village of Oostburg,
and in Gibbsville.

All these churches were in the beginning unpretentious
log structures; but as the people began to amass wealth, the
old churches were replaced by substantial, attractive buildings
surmounted by spires or towers for the church bells.
Comfortable residences for the pastors have been erected on
the church premises. All the congregations are flourishing
today; and although they profess far more liberal views
than their ancestors, the descendants of the early pioneers
are equally devoted to these institutions.

Of all these churches, the one founded by Reverend Zonne
has always been the most prominent, not only because it has
the largest membership but because it possesses greater historic
associations. The second edifice of this organization, a
plain frame building without a tower, was replaced in 1882
by a much larger and more attractive building, the gift of a
pioneer member, J. Lammers. The church is a picturesque
landmark whose spire can be seen for miles. The interior has
been considerably improved of late, and a pipe organ has
recently been installed. An old churchyard is at one side of
the church, and here lie the remains of the Reverend Zonne
and many other early worthies of the church.

The organization has always had a prosperous record, but
its greatest growth began in 1882 when
Rev.
J. J. W. Roth
began his pastorate of more than thirty-two years. Reverend
Roth was born in Capetown, South Africa. There he received
his collegiate training; and, later coming to America with his
father, he studied theology at the McCormick Institute at
Chicago, where he was graduated and ordained in 1878.
After serving two small churches in Minnesota and Wisconsin,
he became pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Cedar
Grove. During the first year of his ministry the present
church was built, and under his pastorate the congregation
became strong and prosperous. Since the young people had

Pg 264

become deficient in the language of their fathers, the introduction
of English into the services had become a necessity.
Dr. Roth, educated to both languages, preached to his people
in both tongues. On May 1, 1914, Dr. Roth was stricken by
apoplexy and remained unconscious for some days. Although
he recovered consciousness, he lost the power of speech and
the use of his limbs, and was compelled to end his active services.
Since his illness he has lived in retirement in Cedar
Grove.

Dr. Roth is a man of scholarly attainment, being proficient
in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, and an artist of some
ability. The church societies, all of which he founded, are in
a flourishing condition. He was for years the leading man
in the Milwaukee presbytery, and was several times elected
its moderator and delegate to higher ecclesiastical councils.
He has been succeeded by
Rev.
P. Van Straten.

During the past twenty years the growth of the Dutch
settlements has been remarkable. The village of Cedar Grove
has grown into a thriving town with many prosperous business
houses, grain elevators, and factories. It has a large public
school, and a classical academy which is conducted by the
Dutch Reformed Church of America. The bank of Cedar
Grove is a flourishing institution founded some ten years ago.
The deposits are over $300,000.

The village of Oostburg has likewise prospered. Peter
Daanâs flour mill has been enlarged; implement, canning,
cheese, and condensed milk factories have been built. Oostburg
and Cedar Grove are connected with each other, Sheboygan,
and Milwaukee by the hourly service of the Milwaukee
Northern Electric Railway. Returns from the planting
of wheat, to which the farmers had devoted their principal
attention had gradually decreased, and barley and rye are
being substituted, also peas and beans which are sold to the
canning factories. Many of the farmers, however, have
turned to cattle raising, dairying, and cheese making as principal

Pg 265

agricultural enterprises. In the making of cheese the
Hollanders of Sheboygan County are recognized as experts
and their brands are among the best in the state.

Always interested in intellectual progress, the Dutch settlers
have built and supported excellent schools, and many are
sending their sons and daughters to colleges. Materially
these people have prospered since the first band of settlers
began to hew down the forest in 1847. The thoroughness
with which they did cut down all timber is being regretted at
present by those who possess land bare of all but a few trees.
This generation, however, is planting trees which, it is hoped,
will soon remedy that great defect.

In customs and manner of thinking the new generation
differs greatly from the pioneers who started to develop the
country. Their language is fast disappearing in public and
in the homes, for only in the church is Dutch even partly used.
This may be due to the similarity between the Dutch and the
Anglo-Saxon languages which have a common factor in the
Fresian tongue.

The similarity of tongues and, in addition, of the political,
religious, and economic struggles of the Dutch and the
English settlers in America has caused the Dutch to be readily
absorbed into the earlier population. The special characteristics,
in addition to those common to both English and Dutch,
make the Dutch element one of the most valuable in the state
of Wisconsin.

PIONEER RECOLLECTIONS OF BELOIT AND
SOUTHERN WISCONSIN
[97]

By Lucius G. Fisher

Edited by Milo M. Quaife

The first of January, 1837, I arranged with the Fairbanks
to leave them and locate in either Louisville or
St.
Louis, and
sell their scales and other goods manufactured by them at
Pittsburgh, on commission. I returned to Derby and remained
there until May, visiting my sister Emeline then teaching in
Montreal. I left Derby the fifteenth of May for the South,
leaving a few hundred dollars with the Fairbanks and taking
some thousands in notes belonging to them to collect between

Pg 267

Burlington, Vermont, and Buffalo, New York, and from
which collections when made I was to take the money due me
and remit to them the balance. I left with my father a fine
span of horses, harness, and wagon with which to follow me
with my sisters when I should get a home for them. My sister
Rosetta had been lame for a year and was under the care of a
physician and surgeon. I left home and friends with a sad
heart, taking the stage for Burlington, my two most intimate
friends riding the first mile with me. One was Stoddart B.
Colby, who was afterwards the leading lawyer of Vermont
and who died Register of the United States currency and
whose wife was burned on the
Swallow
in the Hudson River;
the other, Timothy P. Redfield, now one of the judges of the
supreme court of Vermont and brother of my other very dear
and most intimate friend, Fletcher Redfield, for many years
Chief Justice of Vermont. I have never met either of them
since. I had to get out of the stage the first day to steady it
over snow drifts.

I reached Troy, New York, the third day and that evening
the news came there that the banks had suspended specie
payment in consequence of General Jacksonâs order to the
United States treasurer to remove the United States deposits
from the United States Bank to the Sub-Treasury. All
banks suspended specie redemption and for the time no paper
money was current or debts paid. All confidence was destroyed
between business men, and such a financial panic was
never seen before or since in our country. When I reached
Buffalo I had not collected a cent from $27,000 in notes
against the best business men on the line of the Erie Canal.
In Buffalo I collected in bank bills $70. Here I was with
but little money and all business prostrated. I could not see
in prospect a time when I could hope to engage in the commission
business with success. I had nothing in Vermont to
return to. I was lonely and desolate. Young men were being

Pg 268

discharged from stores and factories in great numbers, and
business men were failing everywhere.

I met at Buffalo a discharged clerk from a house in New
York who was a native of Vermont, and was seeking employment.
Neither of us knew what to do or where to go. We
had been living at the Mansion House several days and on one
Sunday morning we walked down to the wharf and saw a
schooner there with her captain on her deck. I asked him if
he was the captain and where he was bound. He said he was
the captain, that he was bound to Chicago, that his schooner
was a new one, etc. I asked the price of fare in cabin with
board to Chicago. He replied $20. I turned to my friend
Whitcombe and said, âLet us go to Chicago; we may as well
go to one place as another.â He replied, âI will go with
you.â I asked the captain when he sailed. He said, âAt nine
oâclock tomorrow
A. M.
if the wind is fair.â I said, âBook us
as passengers and we will be on board in season.â We sailed
June second. No steamboats had sailed for the upper lakes
then, nor until some days later. There was no railroad west of
Syracuse. The harbor was full of ice. Before leaving Buffalo,
I arranged with a merchant who knew me and who was
from Vermont (the father of Frank Fenton of Beloit) to
furnish me with provisions if on my arrival at Chicago I
should find any sale for them. We were four weeks and two
days on the lakes, with head winds and rough weather most
of the time. Captain Clement was a very agreeable gentleman,
young like his passengers, and very social. Our voyage
was so much enjoyed by me as to have left the most pleasant
memories of it, although it was an aimless one. We were
drifting into the dark future without any plans, yet we were
happy, full of life, had that self-reliance on our own strength
and mental endowments that took away all anxiety for the
future, and enabled us to enjoy the present. The feeling
was a desperate, devil-may-care one. As I look back upon
the first year of my western life, I wonder that I did not

Pg 269

become a reckless and ruined man. Captain Clement was,
after this trip, a large owner of steamboats on the lakes, some
of which he commanded; and for several years he has been
the treasurer of the North Chicago Rolling Mills and a large
stockholder. He landed us in Chicago the night of the third
of July, 1837, and we celebrated the Fourth there. Daniel
Webster was in Chicago for the first and last time in his life.

A delegation from Milwaukee came to Chicago to invite
Webster to visit their city. He had left for the East, and I,
finding no encouragement to go into business in Chicago,
took passage in an old steamer with this delegation to
Milwaukee.

WHAT I FOUND IN CHICAGO

In May, 1837, about a month before my arrival, Chicago
had elected its first mayor, William B. Ogden. Its population
was about 3,000 and was mostly north of the river. There
was a Presbyterian church where the Board of Trade stands,
in which
Rev.
Jeremiah Porter preached. The Russell House
on the North Side was the grand hotel, built of brick. The
Couch brothers had a small hotel on the present site of the
Tremont House of the same name, and the City Hotel was
built on the corner of State and Lake Streets. There were
few buildings south of Lake Street. There was a cornfield
running south from Washington Street and east of State
Street. Lots were worth from $100 to $500 then, but had
been worth as many thousands before the panic of 1837.
John Wentworth had just started his paper, the Chicago

Democrat
, in a little 7 Ã 9 wooden building on La Salle Street
north of Randolph.
[98]
I had a letter of introduction to him
and there made his acquaintance. The first settler, Gurdon
S. Hubbard,
[99]
was here, William H. Brown, and many other

Pg 270

persons with whom I became acquainted, but most of whom
have passed away. Some are here yet, and among them
G. S. Hubbard & Son, S. B. Cobb, Jerome Beecher, and Mr.
Carpenter. Chicago has now a population of 600,000.

I landed in Milwaukee the sixth of July, 1837. The boat
could not land and we were sent ashore in the small boat, at
the mouth of the river, then at Chaseâs Point,
[100]
one mile below
the present mouth. My friend, Ed Whitcombe, was yet with
me and on the boat I made the acquaintance of John H.
Tweedy
[101]
and formed a friendship which has endured the
changes of the last forty-five years. He afterwards married
a Fisher from Boston, who descended from the same ancestor
that I did. I found Milwaukee with a population of about
1,000, the west side of the river mostly under water, many of
the houses built on stilts, abandoned, and doors open, most
of the population of 1836 having left the place by reason of
the panic. I remember the Frenchman and first settler with
a squaw wife was there.
[102]
I stopped at first at the Milwaukee
Hotel, but soon crossed the river to the Leland House where
I found my cousin, Dr. L. J. Barber, and remained with him
at that house. We had not met since we were lads. We soon
became warm friends. I had but little money and several
young men boarding at the Leland House had often to borrow
of me to pay for their weekâs washing. All had been

Pg 271

speculating in lots and were broke. None of us knew what
to do or where to go.

I remained about a week and decided to cross the country
to Galena and go to mining for lead. I started in company
with two men, one by the name of Frink and the other Blood.
We traveled the first day to Waukesha where was the first
house, occupied by a Mr. Pratt.
[103]
It was small, built of logs,
and two berths on one side. The under one was occupied by
Pratt and wife, the upper one by Frink and me, and Blood
slept on the floor. The next day we lunched at the second
house from Milwaukee, at Pewaukee Lake, kept by Harrison
Reed,
[104]
afterwards governor of Florida. We reached Oconomowoc
that night, where we found two bachelors in a log
shanty with a floor of bark and nothing to eat but dry beans,
which they stewed for us and which we ate with a relish from
a bark plate with a chip for a knife. The mosquitoes were
very large and hungry and feasted upon us that night. We
slept but little and left early in the morning on our Indian
trail for Rock River, having learned that there was a camp
there where we could get food. My feet had become very
sore, and the morningâs walk of twelve miles in the rain without
food, and almost gored to death by the mosquitoes, had
so exhausted me that I was sick and could go no farther.
Fortunately, at the river I found Charles Goodhue, Esq.,
and two of his sons from Sherbrooke, Lower Canada, an old
acquaintance in the East, who had a fine camp and ten or
twelve men and three women in camp. They bade me welcome
and gave me to eat and to drink—the best they had and

Pg 272

I was never happier than that day. I was soon refreshed and
ready to travel again. Mr. Goodhue and sons had commenced
building a dam across Rock River, and afterwards a saw mill
was built to cut basswood lumber to raft down the river where
new settlements were being made.

I remained with Mr. Goodhue and sons a few days and
was persuaded by them to visit what was then called New
Albany (now Beloit) before going to Galena, they representing
it as a very desirable point for a town and offering
me an interest in claims which they had recently purchased
there. I accepted the proposition to visit Beloit. There was
a large encampment of Indians on the opposite side of Rock
River from our camp, of whom we purchased a large canoe,
giving them $5 and a gallon of whisky. In it Mr. Goodhue
and son George, Mr. Blood, Mr. Frink, and myself embarked
for Beloit. Goodhue and I owned the canoe and Frink and
Blood worked their passage. The river was very high and
we went to Fort Atkinson the first half day and lodged that
night with Alvin Foster in a log house, the only house there.
[105]

It had but one room of moderate size in which were domiciled
that night Foster and his wife, mother, and niece, and seven
travelers. The next day we reached Koshkonong Lake before
10
A. M.
, and the wind being high we divided, Messrs.
Goodhue, Frink, and Blood going by land around the lake,
while George Goodhue and I kept the boat, preferring our
chances to drown to the tramp by land of six miles on a hot
day over a marsh of some miles. We were to meet at the
outlet of the lake. We in the boat had a rough voyage, bailing
water part of the way to prevent foundering, and on our

Pg 273

arrival at the outlet found none of our party and after waiting
some hours we went on and just after dark we met them on
the river bank about ten miles below the lake, muddy and
tired. We took them [in] and soon reached Janesville, a
village of three families,
viz.
, Messrs. Bailey, Stevens, and
Janes.
[106]
We remained there over night and next morning by
10
A. M.
reached Beloit, where there was one family.

It was Sunday morning, the fifteenth of July, 1837. I
found Caleb Blodgett
[107]
and family there in a log house and
we slept upon the floor two nights while there, in the only
house except a log hut which had just been vacated by an
Indian trader, by name Thibault, whose wife was a squaw.
The first day, Sunday, I took a walk up where the College
now stands and on to the banks of Turtle Creek where I saw
many Indian mounds, some of them still preserved and where
I had an uninterrupted view of prairie such as I had never
had before. I said to my friend with me that it was the most
beautiful landscape view that I had ever seen. Quite a number
of Indian wigwams were standing upon the prairie near
the creek and hurdles for drying their corn, which had been
raised for years upon the Turtle bottoms.

Pg 274

Beloit had been named by Blodgett âNew Albany.â He
with a large family of sons had located there in 1836 and built
their house that fall and had claimed some three miles square
by ploughing a furrow around and putting up several shanties.
The Government was surveying the land; and as it
was not in the market, no title could be obtained except a
so-called squatterâs title, which was obtained by a settlement
upon the land and which gave the settler the right to preÃ«mpt
160 acres when it came into market. In February, 1837,
Dr. Horace White visited Beloit as the agent of a New
England company from Colebrook, New Hampshire, that
had sent him out to select a home for them in the new West.
He left Colebrook in January in company with R. P. Crane
and O. P. Bicknell, who stopped in Michigan while White
continued west exploring the Rock River valley and the
valley of the Des Moines River, all then in the territory of
Wisconsin. At Beloit he found Blodgett and sons (six of
them) and John Hackett, a son-in-law, and being pleased
with the place, he purchased one-third of all the interest or
claims of Blodgett and sons, the interests being undivided.
Blodgett had before bought Thibaultâs interest for $500,
who with his squaw removed to Koshkonong Lake, where I
saw them both on my first voyage down the river and on a
subsequent one in September. The following winter he was
murdered by his squaw and her family.

The following are the names of the colony for whom
White acted: Horace White, Otis Bicknell, George W. and
Charles Bicknell, their father, Captain Bicknell, R. P. Crane,
Messrs. Beach, Eames, and Alfred Field, and Israel Cheney,
and one other whose name I forget, but who never came
west.
[108]
In March, White returned east and O. P. Bicknell

Pg 275

and Crane came to Beloit and built a shanty and occupied it.
That spring a Major Johnson from Newburg, Vermont, and
John Doolittle from Holley, Lower Canada, had reached
Beloit and purchased
2
⁄
12
ths of Blodgettâs claims and lived
in the Thibault shanty. Charles Goodhue from Sherbrooke,
Lower Canada, and his brother-in-law, Tyler H. Moore, had
purchased
3
⁄
12
ths before and had begun the race and a
saw mill on Turtle Creek when I reached the place. The
interests were as follows then: Blodgett and sons
3
⁄
12
ths,
New England Company (so-called)
4
⁄
12
ths, Goodhue and
Moore
3
⁄
12
ths, Johnson & Doolittle
2
⁄
12
ths. I found there
Blodgett and sons, Johnson & Doolittle, Cyrus Eames, Bicknell
& Crane. The lower bench of Beloit or between the bluff
and river was still covered by heavy timber and underbrush,
but little having been removed. The owners had broken some
acres on the bottoms and were breaking 160 acres where Slaymaker
now resides and 100 acres on the high ground south
of him. On Monday after my arrival I purchased of Goodhue
and Moore one-fourth of their interest for $400 and I
paid for my share of the ploughing which was to be cultivated
in common until a division of claims was made. I did not
expect to locate there but bought on speculation.

On Tuesday, the seventeenth, I embarked in our canoe
with Mr. Goodhue and son George, Mr. Frink, and Mr.
Eames for Rockford, leaving Mr. Blood there. We remained
at Rockford over night at the log hotel of Mr. Miller. There
were several families there. Mr. Goodhueâs son Charles met
us there with his team and took us to Belvedere where he had
a little store and where half a dozen families had settled. It
was called Squaw Prairie and a Mr. Doty kept a hotel or
tavern. We left our canoe to the citizens of Rockford. After
a nightâs rest at Belvidere, Frink, Eames, and I started on
foot for Chicago, stopping the first night at Spencerâs Grove.
The next day I was quite sick and reached Tyler & Rausteadâs
house, four miles west of Elgin, about six
P. M.
, and

Pg 276

was so sick that I felt that I could go no farther and proposed
to stay over night, but they would not keep me, fearing that I
should be too sick to leave in the morning. They reluctantly
gave me a cup of tea and I moved on, being virtually dragged
by the arms the four miles by Messrs. Frink and Doolittle.

Here let me correct a mistake in dates and facts. Cyrus
Eames was not at Beloit at this time, and it was not Eames
who left Beloit in the boat with us, but John Doolittle, who
returned to Canada with Mr. Goodhue at this time. We
reached Elgin after dark, where I learned that I had an aunt
and her husband and three children living four miles above
Elgin on Fox River, and in the morning I parted with Frink,
who started for Ottawa, and I hired Mr. Kimball, the landlord,
to take me in a wagon to my Aunt Tylerâs, I being yet
a sick man. Elgin had about ten families. I found my aunt
and husband with three sons on a farm of 400 acres which
George Tyler had squatted upon in 1835 and before the government
survey. Aunt Tyler was the youngest sister of my
mother, and married Noah Tyler of Claremont, New Hampshire,
about 1803 and by him had eight children, four sons
and four daughters. The family became Catholics and the
four daughters became abbesses or superiors. The oldest son,
George, went in early life to Georgia and emigrated from the
South to this state and sent for his father, mother, and two
brothers, who came to him. He married here at the age of
fifty and is now a resident of Texas. The second son, William,
died Catholic bishop of Rhode Island and Connecticut,
in 1854, I think. The third son died at Dundee and the
youngest is living at Elgin and has a large family of nine
children. His name is Calvin. He was educated for the
Catholic priesthood. One daughter, Sallie, is living in Detroit
at the head of a Catholic nunnery.

LUCIUS GEORGE FISHER

From a daguerreotype in the possession of the Fisher family

My good aunt nursed me well and in three days I was
quite well and was sent for by Mr. Goodhue to meet him at
Elgin, which I did and he took me to Chicago with his team.

Pg 277

For miles before we reached Chicago the prairie was on an
average one foot under water. I remained but a day or two
in Chicago, stopping at the Tremont House. I took an old
steamer back to Milwaukee. I boarded at the Leland House
on the west side until September, when I started again for
Beloit by way of Watertown and was accompanied by a
young man by the name of Sanborn, who was or had been a
medical student but had come west to seek his fortune. (He
afterwards returned to New England and finished his studies
and became very eminent in his profession in Keene, New
Hampshire.) We borrowed a horse or pony of Colonel Parks,
receiver of the land office, and rode and tied to Watertown,
and there we spanseled the pony and turned him out to grass.
The next day the Indians had stolen him and he was found
some weeks after at Green Bay. We stopped with a Mr.
Johnson, the first settler there and then the only family there
except one in Goodhueâs camp.
[109]
They gave us a bed separated
from the bed of Mrs. Johnson and her daughter by a
blanket hung between us. Mr. Johnson slept on the floor.
The house was about 12 Ã 12 feet, in one room. We had for
food salt pork, potatoes, and blackberries, and good appetites.

We remained one week and labored diligently with adz
and axe in cutting down a basswood tree and fashioning a
canoe from it, and at the end of a week we hired Mr. Johnsonâs
yoke of oxen and drew the canoe about a mile to the
river. Neither of us were acquainted with the use of tools,
and the canoe was not artistic. We launched it, and on entering
it the first time it shot from under me and left me in the
river. But we soon got the hang of it and we set sail. On

Pg 278

entering Lake Koshkonong we found the wild rice so high
and thick that we could not find a way out of it, and we returned
to an Indian encampment on the river and hired two
Indian boys to go before us and pilot us through the rice
(about half a mile) to clear water. We reached the outlet
about dark and it was then by the river about twenty miles
to Janesville, and we knew there was a log hut with a man and
wife in it somewhere before reaching Janesville.

We pulled on in a bright moonlight and reached the
shanty about midnight, very tired and hungry. On landing
we went to the house and found an opening with a quilt for
a door, which I pushed aside and spoke to a woman whom
I discovered in a bed with her head within a foot of the door.
She answered with a scream and the husband enquired, âWho
is there?â I replied, âA friend,â and made known our
wants. He arose and struck a light and I found we were
in a log room about 12 Ã 8 feet with no windows, door, or
fireplace, the fire for cooking being made against the logs
at one end and a hole in the roof for the escape of the smoke.
The bedstead was made of two upright sticks with sticks,
one end entering holes bored in the logs, the other entering
holes in the standing pieces and slats on these supports.
There were two berths of this kind, one over the other. We
were given the upper one and slept until the party under us
had breakfast ready. The man had been to the river and
caught a fine catfish for breakfast and we had appetites that
gave our food a fine relish. From there we went to Beloit in
one day without accident. This was in September. Mr.
Sanborn remained with me several days. He boarded with
Mr. Blodgett in his log house, sleeping on the floor. Mr.
Johnson, Alfred Field, and some others lived in the Thibault
hut and the Bicknell family in a log hut near the paper mill
or present dam, on the east side of the river. I remained
about four weeks.

Pg 279

While there, a meeting of the settlers was called at the
Beloit House, which was at that time enclosed and partly
finished, to give a better name to the place. Major Johnson,
Deacon Hobart, and myself were appointed a committee to
report one and we proposed several and finally agreed to
place the alphabet in a hat and see if we could not get a
combination of letters that would give us a name that would
be a new one. While proposing this, Mr. Johnson undertook
to sound a French word for handsome ground and in trying
he spoke âBollotte,â and I said after him âBeloit,â like
Detroit in sound and pretty and original I think. All sounded
it and liked it and we reported it to the twenty or thirty who
had sent us out and it was unanimously adopted; and it has
ever since been Beloit and not New Albany.

While at Beloit Major Johnson and Cyrus Eames took
the canoe that Sanborn and I made and floated down to Burlington
where the first territorial legislature for the Wisconsin
Territory was in session. The present states of Iowa
and Wisconsin were called Wisconsin Territory then. At
that session they obtained a charter for a female seminary
in Beloit, it being the first charter for an institution of learning
that was granted in the Territory.
[110]
While at Beloit in
September, a Professor Whitney of Belvidere preached the
first sermon in the Beloit House that was preached in the
county of Rock. I remained into October and then returned
to Milwaukee by the way of Watertown on horseback, riding
one of George Goodhueâs horses in company with him and
remaining over night in his shanty at Watertown. I remained
in Milwaukee until February, 1838, having sprained
my ankle in January, which confined me to crutches for
three months.

Pg 280

My father and sisters, Jane and Amanda, reached Fox
River in December, where my sisters remained with my Aunt
Tyler until March. They left Vermont in October and came
by land with a three-horse team. My father came on to Beloit,
and learning there that I was confined in Milwaukee by lameness,
he started for me with his team, expecting to find his
goods shipped by water from Burlington, Vermont, but
found that the vessel and goods had been sent near Mackinaw
and that a friend of mine had started with me in a jumper
for Beloit, where we met after three days. We rented one-half
of the log house which Blodgett had just left to occupy
a new frame house. We went to Dundee for my sisters in
March and settled in our home with but little furniture. My
father had brought with him two beds and bedding and clothing.
Dr. White, father of Horace White of New York,
occupied the other half of the house with his family. I met
him in April and we soon became fast friends. He was a
good physician and a man of great business capacity, one
who had great command of language and would say more in
the fewest words than any man that I have ever known. He
was a man of sound judgment. He was a very [word illegible]
and reserved man, making but few confidants. We were
more intimate than brothers usually are. We had no secrets
that were withheld by either from the other. He died in December,
1843, and I was left very sad.

In the summer of 1838 I bought four yoke of oxen and
broke prairie for the crop of 1839 after seeding the 20 acres
which was my share of the 320 acres, which was ploughed in
two fields and paid for and owned in common by the colonists.
My father and I harrowed in wheat and oats in March. Bread
and meat were very scarce and dear, and some days we had
nothing but suckers caught out of Turtle Creek. But most
of the time we had meat and as soon as the vegetables grew
we lived very well having plenty of hog product and bread.
Our fall crop of wheat was good.

Pg 281

In the fall of 1838 I went to Milwaukee and arranged
with a merchant for stoves, boots, and shoes to sell on commission,
and with one team I drove them to Beloit and sold
them at a good profit to the settlers who were coming in almost
every day. In the winter of 1838-9 we lived in a part of Mr.
Blodgettâs new frame house. In the summer of 1838 I made
a claim of 160 acres on Rock River, two miles above Fort
Atkinson, which was covered with timber, much of it basswood.
In the winter of 1838-9 I hired four men to cut logs
and rafted them in the spring to Beloit and had them cut on
shares by Messrs. Goodhue and Moore. From the sales of
this lumber I paid my men and from a part of it I built a
comfortable house for my family. My sisters, Emeline and
Rosetta, had been left behind, one in Montreal and Rosetta
with an uncle in Burke, Vermont, under the care of a physician,
having a sprained foot that she did not step upon for
three years and which is not well yet. They came west in the
fall of 1838, so in the new house we all gathered and were very
happy.

In March, 1839, the first land sale took place in Milwaukee,
and I was chosen bidder for all claimants in the south half
of Rock County east of Rock River, the lands on the west side
having been brought into market before at a land sale in Milwaukee.
The claimants all secured their lands, they standing
by me and permitting no one to bid but me on their lands, and
I got all for them at the upset price of $1.25 per acre. Here
I met the cousin and agent of
Gen.
Philip Kearney, and
arranged with him to buy lands for the general and take the
agency of the lands purchased. I made entries for him at
Milwaukee and afterwards at Dixon land sale and subsequently
entered some thousands of acres with Mexican soldiersâ
land warrants on shares and managed his estate in the
west for some years, and in 1856 I bought his remaining lands
at $60,000 and closed my account with him. He visited me
once in Beloit.

Pg 282

The first session of the territorial legislature was held at
Belmont, Lafayette County, the second at Burlington, Iowa,
and the third in Madison in November, 1838, after Iowa was
organized as a separate territory. I attended that and succeeding
sessions for several years as a lobby member. In 1839
I was appointed sheriff of Rock County by Governor Dodge
and held the office six years, in one of which I took the census
of the county and as sheriff collected the taxes of the county.
I had my appointment from Governor Dodge two years,
from Governor Doty three years, and the last year from the
people, the office having been made elective. The statutes
would not permit me to hold it again until after two years.
My business was such that I could not afford to hold it longer,
and I accepted the last election because the county was democratic
and I was the only Whig that could defeat the nominee
of that party. On the night of the election I went to Janesville
to get the returns and found all but four towns reported
and a tie. The next town came in a tie, also the next, and
one more to be heard from and that a democratic one I knew.
When I got the returns from that I had seven majority, and
a great shout went up from my friends.

At the legislative session of 1840 I was appointed a commissioner
to lay out three territorial roads—one from Beloit
to Southport (now Kenosha), one from Beloit to Madison,
the other to Milwaukee. Two others were appointed with me
on each road. I spent much time on them and they are the
roads of today with some slight changes. At the next session
I was commissioned to lay a road from Beloit to Watertown.

In 1839 I met for the first time Miss Caroline Field, the
daughter of Deacon Peter Field, who was at Beloit to visit
her parents. We soon became engaged to marry and after
a courtship of three years we married in June, 1842. I had
built a house, into which we moved on the day of our marriage,
where I lived until 1866 and where all my children
were born.

Pg 283

In 1842 Horace White, Harvey Bundy, and myself
formed a partnership in a general goods business and commenced
building the stone flour mill on the Turtle Creek.
We bought a stock of goods for another store, called the
Mill Store. In December, 1843, Doctor White died and I
was left with all the business and also his family to care for
and his estate to settle, and my partner, Harvey Bundy, a
worthless business man. All the wise ones prophesied that
we should fail and Whiteâs estate was or would be used up.
We owed a large amount and the mill was about half finished.
I felt that I might lose all—for I had not much to lose really
beyond the land that I first purchased and a few hundred
dollars earned. I settled the estate and saved it without loss,
and kept the family together until Mrs. White married Deacon
Samuel Hinman. Horace White of the
Tribune
once,
and now the treasurer of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company,
was the son of Doctor White.
[111]

In 1852 a railroad charter had been obtained for building
a road from Racine to Beloit. Also, one from Southport to
Beloit. The incorporators of each road came to me to assist
them to build, and I chose the road to Racine and made enemies
of the incorporators of the Southport road for the time
being. It was through my influence that it was built. Fisher,
Keep & Tolcott contracted to build it from Fox River to
Freeport, and built it from Fox River or Burlington to
Durand, when the financial crisis of 1867 failed the company
and the work was suspended one year. I was appointed a
receiver by the court and ran it a short time when it was
restored to the directors and I became a director and the
company built it to the Mississippi and sold it out to the
bondholders.

Pg 284

Before this, in 1848 the Chicago and Galena Railroad
had been built to Elgin and the funds of the company were
exhausted, and William B. Ogden and other directors came
to Beloit and offered to build a branch of their road from
Rockford to Beloit, when their road reached Rockford, if the
people of Beloit would subscribe $75,000 to the main line.
I was selected by our citizens to take the subscription and in
one week I got it—part of it without conditions, and part
with my guarantee that if they would subscribe and pay five
per cent, that I would guarantee the stock to be par when
the second installment was called for. The installments were
to be five per cent each month. Mr. Keep, Mr. Cheney,
and myself took $30,000 and I took $15,000 for General
Kearney. When the second installment was called for I had
to take several thousand more that was given me on my agreement
to take it if not at par. Before the third installment
was due the stock was at five per cent premium and I sold
most of it. The company built the road from Belvidere
instead of Rockford, which gave us a shorter line. The next
year the Beloit and Madison Railroad was begun, and I was
elected a director in that and remained on the board until it
was sold to the Chicago & Galena Company, which company
soon after sold out to the Northwestern Railroad Company.
I was a contractor on the Chicago & Northwestern Air Line
between the Rock and Mississippi rivers. In 1856 I was one
of the contractors for building the railroad from Clinton,
Iowa, to Council Bluffs. The contract was for grading,
ironing, and ballasting the road and amounted to about
$13,000,000. The pay was a land grant of every other section
ten miles in width, some cash, and some bonds and some
stock. When we had expended about $400,000 in grading,
the company failed in 1857. We got the first 100 sections of
land and the franchise of the road, which we sold to Mr. Blair
of New Jersey and got even with the company. We took
the land grant and built the road some years after; Morris K.

Pg 285

Jessup, Dean Richmond, Charles Reed of Erie, and Messrs.
Morris & Courtright of New York were partners, also H. S.
Durand and
Wm.
Allen of Racine. I also had a partnership
with the last two and Judge Green of Providence, Rhode
Island, by which the latter gentleman was to furnish $100,000
cash to be used by Durand, Allan, and myself in the purchase
of lands and town sites in Iowa on the line of the road, the
profits to be divided equally between Durand, Allan, and
myself, party of the first part, and Greene and his associates,
party of the second part. The crisis of 1857 ended that
project. In 1852 I prevailed upon a party in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, to open a bank in Beloit. In 1854 John M.
Keep, A. L. Field, and myself bought the bank stock and
elected Keep president and Field cashier. In 1856 I was
elected president and Mr. Keep sold his stock. In the crisis
of 1857 the bank failed and was closed and its charter sold
to Davis & Martin. In 1856 I was elected to the legislature
and served in 1856-7 and declined a reÃ«lection, as at the time
of election the next year, I had more business irons in the
fire than I could attend to.

When the charter of the city of Beloit was obtained, I
was elected an alderman from the second ward and served six
years, and was two years county supervisor. I was a director
in a gas company, also in a car company that went no further
than organizing.

I was a partner of W. T. Goodhue in the purchase and
ownership of considerable real estate. With Goodhue and
R. H. Mills in the purchase and sale of real estate; also, with
R. H. Mills in the purchase and sale of a large amount of
real estate. In the settlement with Mr. Mills, he owed me
over $15,000 which he could not pay, so I gave it to him. Mr.
H. Cheney owed me as much more when he left for Colorado,
where he died. Messrs. Mills, Brooks, and I purchased and
sold much real estate. I was elected a trustee of Beloit College
at its organization and have been to date, also one of

Pg 286

the Executive Committee while I lived in Beloit, and gave
much of the site or grounds. I have been a deacon in the
Congregational church about thirty years. In 1861 I was
appointed by President Lincoln postmaster at Beloit. He
had been my attorney in defending the title to Beloit, which
I did at my own expense mostly and won the suit, and saved
the citizens from a heavy blackmail.

The president offered me any office that I thought myself
competent to fill, through my friend, David Davis. I took
the Beloit post office, as I could not leave my business interests
in Beloit. At the end of four years I was commissioned again
by Lincoln and was afterwards removed by Johnson for
refusing to support his measures. In 1862 I was appointed
by Secretary Chase to take subscriptions to the first or gold
bonds issued to carry on the war, and was one of two appointed
for Wisconsin and received subscriptions.

[97]

Lucius G. Fisher, a native of Vermont, was born at Derby, August 17,
1808. His father was a substantial farmer of Derby, but due to business
reverses the son failed to obtain the anticipated college education, a
fact which he never ceased to lament. While still a youth he formed the
design of migrating to the West, but the execution of this project was delayed
for several years, first by reason of his disinclination to separate from his mother,
and after her death by the necessity of assisting in the support of his father
and sisters. After several years of school teaching and two years of service
as sheriffâs deputy, Fisher in 1834 entered the employ of the Messrs. Fairbanks,
of
St.
Johnsbury, Vermont, to travel for them and introduce their ârecently
inventedâ platform scales. The immediate inducement to this employment was
the proffered salary of $500 yearly and all expenses; but the work was accepted
by Fisher, as he reports in later life, in order to find, in his travels, âthat better
countryâ he had determined, when but sixteen years of age, to seek.

The employment with the Fairbanks company continued profitably for
Fisher for three years. Then the panic of 1837 brought it to a disastrous termination,
under the circumstances set forth in the narrative which follows. The
manuscript from which these facts are drawn, and the greater portion of which
we print, tells the story of the writerâs life from birth until the time of writing,
at Chicago, in the spring of 1883. To summarize its concluding portion, Fisher
left Beloit for Chicago in 1866, where with Ralph Emerson he built a block at
the southeast corner of State and Washington streets on the site of the present
Columbus Memorial Building. Although burned out in the great fire of October 9,
1871, Fisher prospered in Chicago and became comparatively wealthy.

The manuscript narrative of his career was presented to the State Historical
Society of Wisconsin in January, 1917 by a grandson, William Scott Bond, of
Chicago. Because of the valuable picture it presents of pioneer days in Wisconsin,
and particularly of the early development of Beloit, in which Mr. Fisher
played a prominent and creditable part, the narrative seems eminently worthy of
the wider publicity and service which its publication in the Wisconsin Magazine
of History involves. In preparing the manuscript for publication a uniform typographical
style has been imposed, and certain minor lapses in composition have
been eliminated; but these editorial changes affect in no degree the character of
the narrative as it left Mr. Fisherâs hand.

[98]

The
Democrat
, the first newspaper published in Chicago, was founded by
John Calhoun in November, 1833. In 1836 Calhoun sold the paper to John
Wentworth, who continued as its proprietor and editor until the
Democrat
was
merged with the
Tribune
in 1861.

[99]

Gurdon S. Hubbard, a native of Vermont, came west in 1818 as a youth
in the employ of the American Fur Company, and was assigned to the Illinois
Brigade. A number of years later he made Chicago his permanent residence and
became one of the most prominent of the first generation of Chicago business men.
He does not, however, deserve in any sense the title of âfirst settlerâ of Chicago.

[100]

Chaseâs Point was named after Horace Chase, a prominent citizen of early
Milwaukee. Like the Chicago River, the Milwaukee has been subjected to a
civilizing process which has resulted in the acquisition of a new mouth some
distance to the north of the natural one.

[101]

John H. Tweedy, a native of Connecticut and graduate of Yale, came to
Milwaukee in 1836 as a youthful lawyer of twenty-two. He soon became prominent
both in legal and in political circles, and throughout the territorial period was one
of the leaders of the Whig faction in Wisconsin. In 1847 he was elected as
territorial delegate to Congress. Upon the admission of Wisconsin to statehood
Tweedy was put forward by the Whigs as their candidate for the governorship,
but was defeated by Nelson Dewey. During the fifties Tweedy was active in the
development of the railroad system of Wisconsin.

[102]

Apparently the reference is to Solomon Juneau, one of the founders of
Milwaukee, who settled there as an Indian trader in 1818.

[103]

Alexander Pratt had removed from Milwaukee to Waukesha earlier in
the year 1837. Although one of the very early settlers of Waukesha, he was not the
first one, nor was his house the only one at the place at the time of Fisherâs
visit. Pratt was unmarried at this time. He was a man of some means, however,
and had in his employ a man and wife. Probably this couple is the one alluded
to by Fisher.

[104]

Harrison Reed had come west to Milwaukee in 1836, and in 1837 became
virtually the first editor of the
Sentinel
. By an unfortunate quarrel a few years
later he lost control of the paper and was ruined financially. After residences
at Madison and Menasha, Reed in 1862 was appointed tax commissioner of
Florida. He later (1868-72) served as governor of the state.

[105]

The settlement of Fort Atkinson was begun in the autumn of 1836 under the
auspices of the Rock River Claim Company. This company, organized earlier in
the same year, had sent out an exploring party and made claims at several points,
including Fort Atkinson. In order to make good the latter claim it was decided
to locate a family on it, and accordingly a house was built and occupied by
Dwight Foster and family, late in 1836. During the ensuing winter, Edward and
Alvin Foster also came to Fort Atkinson, their houses being built about a mile
up the river from Dwight Fosterâs cabin. Instead of being the first house at
this point, therefore, Alvin Fosterâs was the second or third one built.

[106]

The settlement of Janesville was begun by the erection of a log house by
John Inman and others near the close of the year 1835. Two or three months
later Henry Janes, for whom the town is named, staked out a claim here, and
in the spring of 1836 brought his family to a cabin which workmen had already
built for him. Several other families came during the following months, and
Fisher is probably incorrect in saying there were but three at the time of his
first visit in the autumn of 1837. The Bailey family, mentioned by Fisher,
arrived in the autumn of 1836, and the Stevens family in the spring of 1837.

[107]

Blodgett, a native of Vermont, had come west in search of a fortune, and
in the spring of 1836 had bought Thibaultâs squatter-right claim to all the land
within âthree looksâ of his cabin for $200. Blodgett thereupon set up a claim to
some ten sections of land, and fortified it, according to local histories, by building
a log house and ploughing a furrow around it. Before becoming possessed of any
legal title whatever, Blodgett began disposing of his extensive domain by selling
to Goodhue his claim to one-third of it (one-fourth, according to Fisher) for the
sum of $2,000. Goodhue in turn disposed of one-fourth of his interest to Fisher
for $400. Meanwhile, in March, 1837, Dr. Horace White of Colebrook, N. H., had
visited the place, and on behalf of the New England Emigrating Company had
purchased one-third of Blodgettâs claim for $2,500. This coming of the New
England Emigrating Company to Beloit may be regarded as the most important
event in connection with its early development. At the same time Doctor White
was instrumental in giving to Beloit her most famous citizen in the person of
his three-year old son, Horace.

[108]

The list of members according to Horace White included the following
persons: Cyrus Eames, O. P. Bicknell, John W. Bicknell, Asahel B. Howe,
Leonard Hatch, David J. Bundy, Ira Young, L. C. Beech, S. G. Colley, G. W.
Bicknell, R. P. Crane, Horace Hobart, Horace White, and Alfred Field. William

This was Timothy Johnson, a native of Middletown, Conn., who came to
Wisconsin in 1835. He stopped at Racine for a few months, going from there
to Wisconsin City (now Janesville) at the beginning of 1836. Not satisfied here,
however, he soon went up Rock River to a point about two miles below the site
of Jefferson, where he built a log house and cleared a garden plot. Further
prospecting soon led to the discovery of âJohnsonâs Rapidsâ (modern Watertown),
where he staked out a claim of 1,000 acres in the spring of 1836, bringing
his family to the place in December following. He had thus been settled here
about a year at the time of Fisherâs first visit.

[110]

The charter was granted in 1837 for the establishment of a seminary
âfor young persons of either sex.â The school was not started, according to Horace
White, until 1843 or 1844, when classes were held in the basement of the new
Congregational church. Classes for girls were maintained separately in the
âFemale Seminary.â

[111]

Horace White, widely known as a publicist, and writer on financial
themes, was brought to Beloit by his parents as a child of three years in 1837.
He was graduated at Beloit College in 1853, and in 1854 became city editor of the
Chicago
Evening Journal
. From 1864 to 1874 he was editor and part owner
of the Chicago
Tribune
. In 1883 he bought a part interest in the New York

Evening Post
and thereafter for twenty years was one of its managers, and for
the last few years of the period its editor-in-chief.

DOCUMENTS

THE CHICAGO TREATY OF 1833

With Introduction and Notes by Milo M. Quaife

The Chicago Treaty of 1833, with the negotiating of
which the following documents deal, was an event of considerable
importance, particularly in the history of Illinois
and Wisconsin. From the first advent of the white man in
this region the Potawatomi tribe of Indians had made its
home in some portion of the territory adjacent to Lake Michigan.
By the Chicago Treaty of 1833 the Potawatomi
and allied tribes, the Chippewa and Ottawa, at length agreed
definitely to leave this region and find a new home beyond
the Mississippi. To the whites was surrendered their title to
some 5,000,000 acres of fertile land in northern Illinois and
southern Wisconsin, embracing the tract between Lake Michigan
and Rock River and extending northward from an east
and west line drawn through the southernmost point of
Lake Michigan.

The circumstances attending the negotiation of the treaty
were typical, probably, of those of Indian treaties generally
in the first half of the nineteenth century. Yet two or three
facts give to this treaty a somewhat special degree of interest.
One is that we have left to us fuller and better descriptions
of the negotiation of the treaty than is commonly the case.
Another and more important one is that a larger sum of
money was distributed in the form of gratuities more or less
disguised, to facilitate the conduct of the negotiations. It
is with this phase of the subject that the documents here
presented deal. So far as known, no student of American
history has ever seriously set himself the task of illuminating
the subject of the process whereby the American government
secured from the red man, in successive treaties, title

Pg 288

to the greater portion of the land of continental United
States.
[112]
A comprehensive study of this subject would reveal
much of interest and value; it would be certain, too, to disclose
much of a nature far from flattering to the American
government and nation. That the Chicago Treaty of 1833
would afford some material of this sort for the construction
of the narrative, it requires no hardihood to affirm. Charges
of improper influences and conduct in connection with the
framing of the treaty began to be made as soon as it was
negotiated. Some of them, doubtless, were irresponsible and
unfounded, but there is reason for supposing that this was
far from being true with respect to all of them. The letter
of Governor Porter is preserved in the Burton Library at
Detroit, and acknowledgment is due to Mr. Burton for the
copy we present. The charges against Porter are copied
from a contemporary broadside preserved among the Martin
manuscripts in the Wisconsin Historical Library. The two
documents go hand in hand, for it is evident that the charges
which Porter sought in his letter to Jackson to refute are
identical with those stated in the broadside, although the latter
seems not to contain all the material which had been submitted
to Jackson and which was referred by him to Porter to answer.
Readers who may be interested in pursuing the subject
further may find a discussion of the Chicago Treaty of 1833
in the present editorâs

1673-1835

Old Mr. Kinzie, whose claims are placed on the same
ground, died a subject of the King of Great Britain—he
fought against this country in the late war—his own family
only escaping at the massacre of Chicago. The heirs of Forsyth
and Kinzie, are cousins, consequently the above claims are
all in one family. Major Robert A. Forsyth, a Paymaster in
the U. S. Army, and the individual above named, was one of
the committee on claims who allowed the above sum of $42,516
to himself, his sisters and cousins—one individual only being
associated with him. The Major, and all of his sisters, were
born in the province of Upper Canada, and he to this day
has never been naturalized. He is, however, the especial
protege of the Secretary of War, and Governor Porter. A
large amount of just claims were rejected by the Committee,
to make room for the claims allowed above.

Roberson and Caldwell, the principal Chiefs of the Potawatamie
Nation, half whites, and persons whom Robert A.
Forsyth can control as he pleases, received $10,000 each, as
a bribe to induce them to influence the other Chiefs of the
Nation. It is allowed out of the $100,000 appropriated in
lieu of reservations. Caldwell was the principal Chief at
the massacre of the River Raisin. A Frenchman called
Loranger, an Indian trader, was allowed by the committee on
claims $5000, by assigning his claim to Robert A. Forsyth,
to whom he was indebted $3000. The goods
furnished by
John H. Kinzie, Aid-de-Camp to Governor Porter, (and
the individual named in the list of claims,) and Mr. Kercheval,
(the husband of Maria Kercheval, named in the list of
claims,)
under former treaties, amounted to $100,000. The
practice of
Gov.
Cass has always been to give the furnishing
of goods to be distributed among the Indians, under a regulation
of a former treaty, to the Indian Agent at the Agency
where the goods were to be distributed, as a perquisite of his
office. Had the precedent been followed in the present case,
the Indian Agents at Green Bay, Chicago and Logansport,
would have had the distribution of the goods. But
Gov.

Porter assigned,
over and over again
, as a reason for taking
this perquisite from the Agents, that he was desirous of saving
the per centage usually allowed them, and that in lieu
of this per centage, he had engaged Kinzie and Kercheval
only as agents to purchase the goods in New-York, and was
to give them a per diem allowance for this trouble. Yet, in
express contradiction of this declaration, Governor Porter,

as can be positively proved
, has allowed to Kinzie and Kercheval,
50 per cent. on the whole amount of goods furnished,
making to them a profit of $50,000.

Claims
$42,516

Trust Fund
3,200

Profit on Goods
50,000

$95,716

This amount of public money
is put into the pockets of one
family in the short space of six
weeks. Is it not reasonable to
suppose, that Governor Porter
finds a strong reason for confining the patronage of the
Government to one family, in the
fact that he comes in for a
share of the âplunder?â

Pg 291

In addition to this, Kinzie and Kercheval have received
from Governor Porter, the contract to furnish the Indians
with horses, from which they will undoubtedly realize $10,000.

Kinzie also obtained the exclusive furnishing of the goods
at the forks of the Wabash, amounting to $40,000, and Kercheval
at Nottawassippie, to the amount of $20,000.

It is a fact notorious among all who attended the Chicago
Treaty, that the goods furnished at that treaty, were afterwards
taken from the Indians in large amounts, and furnished
at other places. Kinzie himself, used the goods which he
furnished the Indians as a
gag
to those who complained of his
conduct, by making them presents of cloth,
&c.

Lucius Lyon, our Delegate in Congress, is in possession
of all the foregoing facts, and will vouch for their correctness;
and for their further confirmation, I refer you to
Geo.

W. Ewing, Logansport, Ind.; Alexis Coquillard, South
Bend, Ind.; Thos. J. V. Owen, Indian Agent, Chicago; Peter
Godfroy, Teunis S. Wendell,
Wm.
Brewster, Edward
Brooks, and S. T. Mason, of Detroit; and Robert Stewart,
Mackinac; and
Col.
Ewing, Secretary of the Commissioners.
Most respectfully submitted for your consideration.

Your Obedient Servt.

LETTER FROM GEORGE B. PORTER TO PRESIDENT
ANDREW JACKSON

Detroit, December 15th, 1833.

Genâl Andrew Jackson,

President of the United States,

Sir,

After a fatiguing tour of more than three months, in
performance of the several public duties assigned to me, I
arrived here last evening, and have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt, this morning, of your letter of the 2nd inst. with
its inclosure.

Personal respect for you, Sir, restrains the expression of
feelings, outraged and indignant at having been made the
object of calumnies, so wantonly malicious and grossly untrue,
as those contained in the paper laid before you, a copy
of which you have transmitted.

Pg 292

I appreciate, with a proper sense of the obligation, the
considerate justice which has offered me the means of confronting
my accusers, whenever they shall declare themselves;
and I thank you for the renewed mark of confidence in my
integrity, thus indicated.

The statements contained in this tissue of fabrications,
shall be met fully and fairly, by my own distinct declarations,
which, if deemed insufficient, shall be sustained by ample
testimony, incapable of refutation. And if in vindicating
my honor from unmerited aspersion, the detail should prove
tedious, I ask, not doubting it will be granted, your forbearance
for a temper, smarting under a sense of undeserved
injury.

I may be permitted to premise, that like other public men,
I too, have my enemies. But for this peculiar and vindictive
rancour that assails me, I cannot otherwise account, than by
attributing it to that fruitful source of evil passions—disappointed
expectations. If, in the endeavor faithfully to
discharge my duties, it has not been in my power to accomplish

all
the wishes of
all
, it is but the common lesson which
experience has taught, to others as well as to myself. The
invidious feeling which these causes produce, seeks to gratify
itself, by wresting from me the credit of having effected an
important Treaty, and would willingly sacrifice to its object
the best interests of the country.

To proceed then to the matters alleged against me.

The first proposition contains both an indirect and a direct
falsehood. First, in stating, for the purpose of disparagement,
that but three million acres of land are purchased,
when in point of fact, there are nearly six millions; And
Secondly, that the title not being in the Indians, â
there was
no necessity for a Treaty at all
.â The declaration itself is
utterly without foundation; but waiving this, I remark, that
the province of determining this â
necessity
,â rested not with
the Commissioners but with the President. In the present
instance, it is well known that a cession of country along the
Western shore of Lake Michigan was deemed of so much
importance, that an appropriation for holding the Treaty
was made at the last Session of Congress—Who could be
ignorant of this fact? And yet, those who profess to understand

Pg 293

this matter better than the President and Congress,
and the Secretary of War, whose knowledge of these Indians
and this region of country is minutely particular, assert that
the land did not belong to the Indians ceding it, and that
â
a little investigation will satisfy any reasonable man that
there was no necessity for a Treaty at all
.â

It is stated also that to indulge my favoritism its objects
always found it an easy matter to âpersuade his Excellency
to get up a Treaty.â The mendacity of the writer is equalled
only by his ignorance. The power which assumes the ordering
of Treaties does not lie with me. But without this, the
charge is unfortunate in its application, for I appeal to my
letters on file in the Department to show whether this appointment
was eagerly coveted, or reluctantly accepted, by me.
And the instructions of the Department under which the
Commissioners acted, (an extract from which for your convenience
I enclose), will show, that the Secretary was not
only aware of the importance of the duty but directed us
â
not to abandon it till all hopes of success were exhausted
.â
That we succeeded in effecting all that was required of us
and, in the opinion of every good and intelligent citizen with
whom I have conversed, made a valuable Treaty, advantageous
alike to the Government and the Indians, of importance
to the surrounding country, and this in the most public
and honorable manner, I had never heard doubted, until my
return to this place. Since then, I have heard of boasts that
I should be destroyed. And accordingly, during my
absence
,
falsehood and aspersion were busy with my character and
conduct. To destroy the confidence you repose in me, no
means have been scruppled at.—First, it is boldly proclaimed
that I cannot effect a Treaty—then it is denied that any credit
is due to
me
, for having accomplished it:—and now, I am
held exclusively answerable for the whole Treaty, and every
circumstance attending it.

To my Co-Commissioners, and the gentleman selected

by them
as the Secretary of the Commission, who are all
highly respectable Citizens of Illinois:—to the full Journal
of all our proceedings:—to the many distinguished citizens
of Illinois, Indiana and the surrounding country:—to every
honourable man who was present during the Council, among

Pg 294

whom are Mr. Daniel Jackson of New York—and Mr.
Robert Stewart, the Agent of the American Fur Company
at Michilimackinac, both of whom I understand to be now
in Washington, and whose characters are known to you, I
appeal with confidence, for a refutation of these slanders.
[113]

The suggestion that extra allowances have been made to
me for extra services is not disputed, being an usage of the
Government from its first institution. The labors I have
performed and the fatigues I have undergone, in this tour,
over roads almost impassable, and during a continuation of
the most unfavorable weather, teach me to believe that I have
honestly earned all that the Rule of Department will allow:
But the vile and mean insinuation appended, and which none
but an utterly corrupt heart could generate, that I have
sold

my patronage, does not require an answer.

In reference to the claims or accounts contained in the
Schedules annexed to the Treaty, to some of which particular
exception has been taken, I proceed, in explanation, to state:
That in furtherance of the policy of the Government to
remove these Indians West of the Mississippi, the Commissioners
refused to grant Reservations of land, although these
were greatly preferred, but agreed, in lieu thereof, that a
part of the
consideration money
should be apportioned among
such individuals as the Indians chose to designate. In like
manner another part of the consideration money, the
amount

of which was fixed, was to be applied in satisfaction of claims,
which, on examination, should be admitted by the Indians
to be justly divided. Who, so well as they, could tell whether
they were indebted to an individual or not? But to protect
themselves against unfounded claims, many of which were
presented, the Chiefs and head men employed a gentleman
of high standing and respectability, as their assistant, and
asked permission that he might be present at the investigation
of the claims. This gentleman was Richard E. Hamilton,

Pg 295

Esq.,
[114]
of Chicago—in whom these Indians reposed unbounded
confidence—They farther requested that Major
Forsyth, for whom they professed a like regard, and who
was familiarly known to them, should aid their friend
Col.

Hamilton in the duty confided to him. Impressed, as all
were, with the character of the two gentlemen for integrity
and honor, so reasonable a request was not denied.—In the
presence of the Chiefs and those Assistants, the commissioners
proceeded in the examination of the numerous claims,
the
decision
on each claim being made by the commissioners;
by all of them; and by them
alone
; and the amount allowed on
each claim was then and there written down by the Secretary.
So far as relates to the allowances, (so principal an object of
animadversion), granted to the heirs of Forsyth & Kinzie,
I aver, without fear of contradiction, that neither Major
Forsyth nor any of the persons interested, had anything to
do with the decision upon them; nor, to the best of my knowledge
and recollection, were any of them present, when they
were acted on—The Chiefs and Head men insisted upon
these allowances, and the Commissioners, on hearing the
representation of the Indians unanimously acquiesced in their
justice. These with the several other claims allowed form,
as I have stated, a part of the consideration money of the
Treaty, and if it were possible, which it certainly is not, to
preserve the Treaty, striking these out, the Individuals named
would, I have not a doubt, suffer neither detriment nor loss—The
whole Potawatamie Nation would, I am persuaded,
restore the allowances at the Annuity table.

The name of Robert A. Forsyth, which occurs three times
in the first statement of allowances, belongs to two different
individuals, one of whom is a Merchant in Ohio,
[115]
and the
other, the Paymaster. The extensive trade in which the
Merchant of this name in Ohio is engaged will appear on
reference to several Treaties lately made in Ohio and Indiana.

Pg 296

Nor is this confusion of names mentioned in defence or extenuation—I
am ignorant of any just ground of exception
to my conduct, in the whole history of this transaction, but I
note it, merely, as one of a series of deceptive statements.
The jeering comment follows that âMajor Forsyth of the
United States Army, received his $3000 as an Indian Chief.â
These falsehoods are almost too gross for refutation. The
Treaty states the allowance. Does it say he received it as an
Indian Chief? The Indians stated, themselves, and without
any prompting on the part of the Commissioners, that there
was due to Robert A. Forsyth a reservation, which had long
since been promised by their nation, and which they had
desired Governor Cass and Judge Sibley, Commissioners at
the Treaty of Chicago in 1821, to grant him. This request
has been reiterated at the Treaty of
St.
Joseph, in 1828, as
can be attested by
Gov.
Cass and Mr. Menard, the Commissioners;—the
land being then, and ever since, set apart for
him by the Indians. It was not secured to him in either of
these Treaties, because not included within the bounds of the
lands then ceded. The Commissioners, in this, as in every
other instance when it could be done compatibly with the
policy of the Government, and with justice to Individuals
and the Indians, conceived it their duty to obey their wishes.
[116]

The selection of persons to examine and adjust claims, as
well for reservations as on account of losses, was made, not
by the Commissioners, but by the Indians themselves. The
claims were all subjected to the supervision of the Indians,
or persons they themselves appointed to represent them;—It
is notorious that they expressed at all times the most unhesitating
confidence in their Indian Agent,
Col.
Owen, who
was one of the Commissioners:—in
Col.
Hamilton, whom
they specially deputed to act for them, and in the two persons

Pg 297

scoffed at as â
half whites
,â Caldwell and Robinson.
[117]
With
these was associated also Joseph, an influential Chief, who
was present in every business transaction—Caldwell and
Robinson have been nurtured with, and raised by, these
Indians, one from childhood, and the other from his birth;
they are identified with this tribe, and are Indians in character,
in manners, in mode of life, in sentiments and conduct, and
as such are regarded by them. By reference to the Treaty of
1829, it will be seen that they were then acknowledged as
the principal men, and the Treaty was made with them.
Whom could they trust if not these? After the assent to sell
had been obtained, and the general preliminaries had been
agreed upon, the Indians in open council, as will appear by
the Journal, advised the Commissioners that they had confided
the care of their interests, and all the details of the
Treaty, to these, their principal chiefs; and the Commissioners,
as I considered then and now, properly acquiesced.
When these details were completed, and the Treaty reduced
to form, it was read by
Col.
Hamilton in private Council to
the Indians, and was again read before them in public Council,
by myself, and unanimously approved. It is represented that
old Mr. Forsyth never had $500 in property in his life. This
can be disproved by a hundred witnesses, conversant with
the fact, that he was extensively engaged in the Indian trade.
So, too, the assertion that âold Mr. Kinzie died a subject of
the King of Great Britainâ, can be falsified by the records
of the War Department, showing him to have been for many
years after the war a
Sub Agent of the Government
. Equally
and unqualifiedly false also is the declaration that âhe fought
against his country in the late war,â or âled the Indians in
the Massacre of Chicago.â On the contrary he was a zealous
and efficient partizan of the American party, and as the
books of the American Fur Company will show, was their
agent at his death.

Nor is the declaration that Major Robert A. Forsyth, a
Paymaster in the United States Army, has never been
ânaturalized,â by which it is intended to be conveyed that he
is an alien, less destitute of truth. The Father of Major

Pg 298

Forsyth was an American Citizen, (born in Detroit), and
has always resided in this country, and the accidental circumstance
that Major Fâs mother was, at his birth, among
her friends across the narrow line which divided the Territory
from Canada, did not, nor could, divest him of his national
character. The law of nations recognize no such
principle: Accordingly, the vote of Major Forsyth has never
been challenged at an election; he bore a Commission, as a
Cadet of the Military Academy, and subsequently as an
officer in the Army of the United States. He has been
elected to the Legislature of the Territory, and executed the
trust; where the objection stated, if valid, would have been
fatal. Finally, he has received from the President of United
States, a Commission as Pay Master in the United States
Army. Equally deceptive with every other feature of this
malignant attempt to destroy me, is the perverse meaning
significantly assigned to the trusts, confided to Major Forsyth
and Mr. Kinzie. They are real, substantial trusts, created
under circumstances of perfect notoreity at Chicago, and
challenge scrutiny. In these, as in every other case, the appointment
was made without consulting the individual, and
in some instances against his inclination.

Major Forsyth is charged also with having bribed Caldwell
and Robinson with $10,000 each, to influence the Chiefs
of their Nation. This varies in nothing from the complexion
of the other statements. It is a pure fiction. Major Forsyth
had nothing to do with the matter. The Individuals cited,
received, by the express direction of their people, the sum
of $10,000 each,
as the two head men of the nation
, to whom
the entire direction of their affairs had long before been committed,—on
whom they not infrequently lived, and to whom
they looked for relief in their necessities. A reference to the
Journal will establish the fact of their appointment, because
it is so declared in the speeches of the Indians, delivered in
public Council. If the Indians, in open Council, declare what
shall be done with a part of the consideration money of their
land and, according to their custom, insist that their principal
Chiefs shall be provided for out of it, why should it be objected
to? As well might it be objected that $5000, a part of this
consideration money, is appropriated at the request of the

Pg 299

Chiefs to the students of the Choctaw Academy, of which
sum the Honorable Richard M. Johnson is constituted
Trustee.
[118]

It is said also among other representations that a Frenchman
called Loranger,
[119]
who never had goods in the Indian
country, was allowed by the Commissioners on Claims $5000
by assigning his claim to Robt. A. Forsyth to whom he was
indebted $3,000.

It is with difficulty Sir, that I can sufficiently command
my feelings, or control the disgust with which I am affected,
at these monstrous falsehoods, for while I would speak of
them in the manner they merit, I would not forget the
respect due to you. But in the above proposition of three
lines, are stated three direct, unqualified untruths:—First—That
he had had no goods in the Indian Country which
could be refuted by a common clamor. Second—That he
assigned his claim to Major Forsyth; and Third—That he
was indebted to him for $3000.—I have already named Mr.
Daniel Jackson, of the firm of Suydam, Jackson &
Co.
, of

N. Y.
who are so extensively engaged in the sale of Indian
Goods—Of him I would ask how long he has known Mr.
Loranger to be in the Indian trade, and what has been the
amount of goods sold yearly to Mr. Loranger—The claim
of Mr. Loranger was much greater than the allowance—The
balance is lost to him, because not presented at the Treaty
in Indiana in October 1832, being due by that Band or Party
of Potawatamie Indians—He has been in the Indian trade
since 1804, and lives within sight of this town.

I had intended to close this communication here; but I
cannot remain silent, while slanders are heaped upon the
gallant dead. The characters and memories of John Kinzie
and Robert A. Forsyth deceased have been wickedly assailed—and
by whom? Their descendants would like to
know—For the part each one of these individuals took, and
the important services rendered by them to the American
Government in the late war, reference is made to many of the

Pg 300

first men in the country; Among those immediately around
you is the Secretary of War, Major General Macomb,
General Gratiot and Colonel Croghan.—Having considered
it my duty to make inquiry I have obtained the following
information and believing it to be strictly correct, I give it to
you as such.
—

Memoir of the late John Kinzie of Michigan.
[120]

John Kinzie died at Chicago in 1828, aged 64 years; he
came to this part of the Country when a boy and was in the
Indian trade during the greater part of his life. He went
to Chicago, Illinois, in 1803—was Sutler for the United
States troops for several years, and was the first to take from
Detroit the news of the declaration of War, to Captain Heald
then commanding the Fort at that place.
[121]
On the eve of
the massacre at Chicago, Mr. Kinzie with two friendly Indian
Chiefs, called at Captain Healdâs quarters, and advised him
not to abandon the Fort as was contemplated the next morning,
but to remain as long as possible; for if he left it he
would certainly be attacked by the Indians, who had collected
to the number of five hundred warriors.—Captain Heald
persisted in going—said he had orders from Genl. Hull to
evacuate the post, and to proceed with his command to Fort
Wayne. Captain Heald then requested Mr. Kinzie to accompany
him, which he did, leaving his family with but three
men to protect them on their way to
St.
Joseph (distant by
water 100 miles). Mr. Kinzieâs family were taken prisoners
a few hours previous to the massacre. Mr. Kinzie was in the
battle, as well as one daughter, the wife of Lieutenant Helm,
whose horse was shot from under her. She received a wound
in the foot from the ball which killed her horse. Mr. Kinzie
was taken prisoner with the surviving command of Captain
Heald. Having been long a principal trader among these
Indians, and much esteemed by them, he was next day by a
Council held by the Chiefs, liberated, and his family restored
to him.

Pg 301

He then prevailed upon the Indians to surrender to him
Captain Heald and family, whom he furnished with conveyance
to Mackinac.
[122]
Mrs. Heald now residing at
St.

Louis can prove all these facts.—Having lost all his property
to a very considerable amount (it being a wholesale establishment)
consisting of merchandise, furs and peltries and horses,
etc., taken by the Indians, he went to Detroit. His influence
while there was directed toward affecting a change in the
views and feelings of the Indians at that time unfriendly to
the American Government. This influence with the different
tribes of Indians was very considerable and as a proof
of it General Proctor commanding the British force in
Detroit and its vicinity sent for Mr. Kinzie, and when he
went to see him General Proctor immediately confined him
as he said âfor daring to prejudice the Indians against his
Majestyâs subjects or forces, and would send him where he
would not see an Indian in a hurry.â—Mr. Kinzie was twice
rescued by several Indian Chiefs, and once in the presence
of General Proctor himself. Mr. Kinzie was again taken by
General Proctor and
closely confined in irons
at Fort Malden
(as also a Mr. Jean Bte Chandonnois who subsequently made
his escape and is now living in the
St.
Joseph country) and
kept there for months. He was finally, to conceal him from
the Indians, sent off in the night in irons—was treated in the
most brutal manner by his guard, and was shipped for England
for trial—Fortunately for him, the Ship lost her rudder,
and she was obliged to put into Halifax, having on board a
great number of American prisoners.—He thence made his
escape in a crowd of paroled prisoners, and returned to his
family in Detroit, after it had been taken possession of by
General Harrisonâs Army. Mr. Kinzie had not been long at
home before he was called upon by Colonel Croghan, and accompaned
the expedition under him to Mackinac, and was
Captain of a party of Militia at the battle fought on the
Island of Dousmanâs Farm. Mr. Kinzie, after the close of
the War, held the appointment of Sub Indian Agent for
many years at Chicago.—He was well known to Generals
Harrison, Macomb, Gratiot, and
Col.
Croghan.—During the

Pg 302

time of hostilities, his energies were always devoted to the
American cause.

Robert A. Forsyth was long and extensively engaged in
the Indian trade.—His residence was at Detroit and his trading
establishments in different places in the Indian Country.
He not only enjoyed the confidence of the Indians but that of
his fellow citizens. Every honest man then resident of
Detroit can attest to his bravery during the late War. Such
had been his conduct that, on the surrender of Detroit, he
was marked as a fit subject for British vengeance.—He was
torn from his family and with his only son, the present Major
Forsyth, then a boy of about fourteen years, put on board the
British vessels and carried off; his several infant daughters
being left without a protector; their fatherâs house occupied
by the British troops; and all his valuable property pillaged
and carried away. Being landed on parol at Erie, Penn.,
the father and son soon afterwards found their way to General
Harrisonâs Army. This gentleman can attest to the many
valuable services which they rendered. The father died in the
year 1813, in the service of his country, without having been
permitted to return to his family:—Being early enured to the
hardships of trading among the Indians and being naturally
active and brave the son frequently performed duties, from
undertaking which others were deterred by their severity and
danger. For the history of the son, the hardships he encountered,
his important services before, and his gallant conduct
during the war, I refer you to the Honourable Lewis
Cass, who is familiar with its details.

I have now, Sir, I believe, with one exception, gone over
the whole ground. That exception relates to the furnishing
of goods by Mr. Kercheval and Mr. Kinzie, and as it has
no connection with the Treaty of Chicago, being in fulfilment
of the stipulations of previous treaties, and in the
making of which I had no agency, and concerns myself exclusively,
I shall make it the subject of a communication to
accompany this.

The question so insidiously put, of whether âthe Governor
does not secretly reap a share of the plunderâ I cannot,
consistently with the respect due myself, answer.—Whether
I have forgotten principle and character, and everything

Pg 303

dear to an honourable mind, to defile my hands with the
contamination of a bribe, is a question others must settle
for me.
—

In conclusion, I have only to add that, to the issue I have
here made up, I commit without shadow of fear of the result,
what is dearer to me than all else—my reputation and good
name.

The State Historical Society of Wisconsin has under preparation a volume
devoted to those Indian treaties which are of more direct interest to Wisconsin.

[113]

Daniel Jackson belonged to the firm of Suydam, Jackson and Company of
New York, large importers of goods for the fur trade. Robert Stuart was manager
at Mackinac for the American Fur Company. Porterâs appeal to these men is
not entirely convincing, since they were important representatives of the fur
trade merchants who, as a class, profited most largely by the gratuities and allowances
concerning which complaint was being made.

[114]

Richard J. Hamilton came to Chicago in 1831 as first clerk of the circuit
court of Cook County. During the next few years he held a large number of local
offices of a legal or fiscal nature, much of the time holding several at the same
time. He had much to do with the establishment and early administration of
the public school system of Chicago.

[115]

Robert A. Forsythe of Ohio was an early trader at Maumee City in Lucas
County. He was probably the son of James Forsythe, an early merchant and
tavern keeper of Detroit. He was one of the founders of the lower Maumee
Valley.

[116]

The pronouncement of Meriwether Lewis to President Jefferson on this
point, given in a case which involved the same principle as the one here involved,
is not without interest in this connection: âI am confident that, if the United
States should never confirm the lands to the present claimants, it will not prove
a source of disquiet on the part of the Osages; and should they be ever countenanced
or receive confirmation, on the ground of their being Indian donations,
it would introduce a policy of the most ruinous tendency to the interests of the
United States; in effect it would be, the Government corrupting its own agents; for,
I will venture to assert, that, if the Indians are permitted to bestow lands on such
individuals as they may think proper, the meanest interpreter in our employment
will soon acquire a princely fortune at the expense of the United States.â

Billy Caldwell and Alexander Robinson, halfbreeds, who were influential with
the Potawatomi and the Ottawa.

[118]

Unfortunately for Porterâs justification in this particular instance, the investigations
of students have revealed much that is of questionable propriety
in connection with Johnsonâs conduct of his Indian school.

[119]

Joseph Loranger was a fur trader in the River Raisin and before the War
of 1812 had a store in partnership with Lafontaine. In 1817 he platted the town
of Monroe, Michigan, of which place his descendants were prominent citizens.

[120]

The correctness of this narrative is not above question in all respects. In
general it may be noted that Porter was bent on presenting a favorable account
of Kinzieâs career, and that he evidently drew his information from friendly
sources. Nevertheless, it constitutes an interesting addition to our sources of
information concerning Kinzie, the reputed âfather of Chicago.â

[121]

Kinzie removed to Chicago in 1804, the year following the establishment of
Fort Dearborn. The statement that he brought the news of war to Fort Dearborn
is incorrect.

[122]

This statement is in contradiction with our other sources of information
on the subject.

HISTORICAL FRAGMENTS

THE DISPUTED MICHIGAN-WISCONSIN BOUNDARY

Boundary disputes have ever constituted a fruitful source of
contention between men and nations. Probably no people has more
frequently engaged in them than our own, although, contrary to
Old-World precedent, we commonly wage our boundary contentions
verbally rather than with arms. Wisconsin, like others of the sisterhood
of states, was early in its history a party to a number of
boundary disputes, the fruits of victory commonly going, at least in
local contemporary judgment, to her opponents. Since Wisconsin
has become a state, boundary disputes have until recent years ceased.
Two such have, however, arisen within the twentieth century and are
still pending, one with the state of Minnesota, the other with that
of Michigan. The former is in process of settlement by due governmental
procedure, and accordingly no discussion of it would now be
useful. The latter is at present in a state of quiescence; yet the
boundary paragraphs of the constitutions of Michigan and of Wisconsin
contain mutually contradictory clauses with respect to a strip
of territory over which Michigan claims and Wisconsin exercises
jurisdiction. Moreover, the overtures of our northern neighbor a
few years since looking to a determination of the question met on
our part with rebuff. Sooner or later, the issue will have to be determined;
pending this, an historical rÃ©sumÃ© of the points at issue may
be of some interest, especially to Wisconsin readers.

The boundary between Michigan and Wisconsin was first determined
in the act that in 1836 created Wisconsin Territory. In
ignorance of the real geography of the region this act described a
supposititious line, under the belief that the Montreal River had its
source in Lake Vieux Desert. Two years later Congress appropriated
$3,000 for the survey of the Michigan-Wisconsin boundary.
The appropriation was considered insufficient and no attempt was
made to run the line until 1841. Then, the matter having been
transferred to the War Department, an army engineer, Lieutenant
Thomas J. Cram, was detailed to undertake the survey. Cram spent

Pg 305

the summer of 1841 in Wisconsinâs northern forests, ascertained
many facts about the lakes and streams therein, and reported them
to the department. Two years later Cram was again detailed to
search for the true Wisconsin-Michigan boundary. He spent four
months under conditions involving much hardship, in the attempt
to determine the line as nearly as possible in accordance with official
description. In the report which he made to the head of his department
he recommended the abandonment of Lake Vieux Desert as a
determinating factor in the interstate boundary line.
[123]

The determination of the line rested until 1846, when, in the
enabling act providing for the admission of Wisconsin, Congress
established the line âto the mouth of the Menominee river; thence
up the channel of the said river to the BrulÃ© river; thence up said
last mentioned river to Lake BrulÃ©; thence along the southern shore
of Lake BrulÃ© in a direct line to the center of the channel between
Middle and South Islands, in the Lake of the Desert [Vieux Desert];
thence in a direct line to the head waters of the Montreal river, as
marked upon the survey made by Captain Cramm; thence down the
main channel of the Montreal river to the middle of Lake Superior.â
The constitution of Michigan, adopted in 1850, repeated the boundary
article of Wisconsinâs enabling act with only slight verbal
changes, including the omission of Captain Cramâs name. The fundamental
laws of the two states were thus in accord concerning the
line separating these states.

In the meanwhile, in 1847 a portion of the boundary was surveyed
by William A. Burt, under the direction of Lucius Lyon.
[124]

Burt took the contract on April 27 and performed his work during
the succeeding summer months. The field notes of his survey do not
accompany his printed report, but Lyon stated that Burtâs notes
would be forwarded later, and no doubt they are yet preserved in the
General Land Office at Washington. From these field notes it might
be ascertained why Surveyor Burt chose the eastern branch as the
âmain channel of the said Montreal river.â In so doing he assigned
to Wisconsin 360 square miles of land that now include the towns of

Pg 306

Hurley and Van Buskirk. Had he chosen the western branch, rising
in the Island Lake as the Montrealâs headwaters, the jurisdiction
of this strip would have rested in Michigan.

No one undertook to investigate the matter until quite recent
years. Then Hon. Peter White of Marquette, Michigan, believing
that his state was illegally deprived of the land between the two
branches of the Montreal River, had a survey thereof made at his
private expense. Whiteâs surveyors ascertained, to their own and
his satisfaction, that the western branch was the âmainâ channel of
the Montreal River. Meanwhile Mr. White had interested in Michiganâs
claims Clarence W. Burton of Detroit, the president of the
State Historical Commission. Burton discovered that one of Burtâs
surveyors, George H. Cannon, was still living, and arranged for the
publication of an article from his pen supporting Whiteâs contention
that Michigan had been wrongfully deprived of a portion of her
upper peninsula.
[125]

Shortly after this, in 1907, Michigan held a convention to prepare
a new constitution for the state. Burton was chosen a member
of this body, and became chairman of the committee on boundaries.
That committee, without discussion upon the floor of the convention,
had the boundary article of the new constitution drawn to read:
âthence in a direct line through Lake Superior to the mouth of the
Montreal river; thence through the middle of the main channel of
the westerly branch of the Montreal river to Island Lake, the head
waters thereof, thence in a direct line to the center,â etc. This became
part of Michiganâs fundamental law on February 21, 1908.

Meanwhile in 1907 two resolutions passed the Michigan legislature.
The first, after reciting the mistakes in Captain âCrammâsâ
surveys, authorized the governor to appoint a commissioner to visit
Wisconsin in order to secure a joint commission for the adjudication
of the boundary. In pursuance of this resolution the governor appointed
Hon. Peter White to this office. He came to Madison twice,
but could not interest the stateâs officials in his enterprise, and was
unable to secure any promise of participation in a joint commission.
In June, 1908, Mr. White died, and so far as known no successor to
him as boundary commissioner has ever been appointed.

Pg 307

The second Michigan resolution of 1907 authorized the attorney-general
to direct a survey of the stateâs northwest boundary, and
also to institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to
secure a rectification of the boundary line. Acting on this authorization
the attorney-general employed Professor J. B. Davis, of the
University of Michigan, to investigate the survey and prepare a
brief of Michiganâs claims. The result of Professor Davisâ investigation
has not yet been given to the world. A chronicler of Michigan
wrote in 1908 that âin view of the political excitement of the presidential
year no active measures [concerning the disputed territory]
are likely to be taken this season.â On another page the author
expresses a doubt âwhether the state of Michigan can ever occupy
the territory justly hers.â He concludes with the observation that
it âis believed to be the only instance in this nation where two sovereign
states are occupying a dividing line of doubtful legality,
merely by common consent.â

AN EARLY WISCONSIN PLAY

In the collection of Mr. Henry Cady Sturges, of New York,
there is a copy (the only one the writer has seen) of a play which,
while it may not be the earliest, is certainly one of the first printed
in Milwaukee. While the plot of the production is laid in New York
and is largely local in interest, yet the fact that it was printed in
Wisconsin, and the further fact that no other edition seems to be
known, makes it fairly certain that it is the offspring of a writer
who lived in Wisconsin.

The piece bears title as follows: â
The Drummer, / or / New
York Clerks / and / Country Merchants. / A Local Play, / in two
acts.
/ (2 lines of verse.). / Edited by Mrs. Partington. / Milwaukee:/
Job Press of Cary & Rounds. / Commercial Advertiser Office./
1851./â It has 73 + 1 pages and paper covers, the front cover
bearing the same title as above.

A curious coincidence regarding the characters in the play is
that the father of the present owner, Jonathan Sturges, is among
them, his part being that of âMr. Sturges, a New York Merchant,â

Pg 308

that really being his occupation. âMrs. Partingtonâ is also among
the characters.

This curious production was written at the time of the Jenny
Lind excitement, and that great singer is mentioned in a number of
places throughout the play. Her manager, P. T. Barnum, is there
also, while some of the localities noted are Coney Island, Nibloâs,
The Bowery, and Castle Garden. The first act takes place, first in
a saloon on Broadway, and afterwards in the office of a first class
hotel, also on that well-known thoroughfare. The second act is staged
in Mrs. Partingtonâs parlor in the same hotel.

Some of the popular books of the period are mentioned, among
them
New York in Slices
, while among the names of well-known New
Yorkers are Horace Greeley and James Gordon Bennett, editor of
the
Herald
. Milwaukee is hinted at, and Mr. Sturges is made to say
by the playwright as he addresses his clerks, âFourteen hundred
dollars from Wisconsin. Extremely good. Wisconsin crops are
nearly all destroyed, still the money is sure to come from that state.
More goods are ordered, they shall have them.â

The play is interspersed with songs that are saturated with the
alleged humor of the period, and sad to relate, one of these songs
has been torn from the copy before me, probably because of its
facetious nature.

It is doubtful if the writer ever intended to have his production
staged, although the copy now described has several corrections
such as are found in prompt copies.

I am inclined to believe that the statement on the title that its
editor was Mrs. Partington (Benj. P. Shillaber) was simply put on
to add to the humor of the occasion, as I doubt if Shillaber had a
hand in its composition.

On page 73 is the statement that copyright has been secured.

From a perusal of the piece it seems evident that its author knew
the metropolis very well, but the misspelling of proper names and
other evidence makes it seem almost certain that it was the work of
some one, who, while well acquainted with New York, was not a permanent
resident of that city. Was he a writer from Wisconsin?
If so, who was he, and why was he writing a play of this character,
a piece whose plot was taken from a place so far from home?

EDITORIAL

THE PROFESSOR AND THE FINGER BOWL

To tell a new Lincoln story is something of an achievement.
Colonel Tom Brown, a former citizen of Badgerdom,
who now resides in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has achieved
this distinction, we believe, in relating the following incident.
In view of the nature of our leading article, and of the local
interest which attaches to Mr. Brownâs tale, we gladly give it
such additional currency as lies within our power.

In some sections of southwestern Wisconsin during the
Civil War, so the story runs, certain copperhead organizations,
particularly the Knights of the Golden Circle, became
decidedly outspoken in the expression of their sentiments—so
much so that a group of loyal citizens decided to send a
spokesman to Washington to acquaint the President with
the threatening proceedings. The delegate chosen for this
mission was a certain Professor Kilgore of Evansville Seminary.
On his arrival at Washington he was invited to take
lunch at the White House, where he was seated next to
President Lincoln himself. At this time finger bowls were
coming into fashion, but their advent had not as yet come
within the ken of the simple western professor. Accordingly
he was greatly perplexed by the little dish, containing a slice
of lemon and some liquid, apparently lemonade, which appeared
near the close of the meal. Observing his embarrassment,
President Lincoln, leaning toward him, whispered,
âProfessor, donât sip out of that bowl, watch me.â

Following this kindly instruction the pedagogue concluded
the meal without disgracing himself. When, later,
they found themselves alone together, President Lincoln confided
to the visitor that he himself needed a servant to keep
him informed about âthose little things.â

Pg 310

We cannot vouch for the truth of the story, although it
rests on better authority than most of the tales that are told
about Lincoln. However authentic its details, it presents a
trait of homely kindness, the possession of which constitutes
one of the most attractive aspects of Lincolnâs personality.

THE PRINTING OF HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS

The last day of the year brings to hand the January, 1917,
number of the quarterly
Journal
of a neighboring state historical
society. What the local conditions may be which
render it necessary to be a year behind with the publication
of this periodical, we are unaware. Reference is made to it
by way of calling attention to a practice which is all too
common with respect to the issuance of historical periodicals
and other publications. If a quarterly must appear six
months or a year late it would seem to be a fair question
whether its appearance at all is worth while. If such delays
are due to the slackness or incompetency of the editor, the
proper authorities should apply a much needed stimulant.
If they are due to conditions beyond the editorâs control,
reform (in the quarter responsible for the delay) is still
desirable. We suspect that commonly such delays are caused
by the state printers, by whom, at least in the Middle West,
historical publications are generally issued. We speak the
more feelingly on the subject because our own Society is not
immune from the criticism under discussion. The printer
dallied for a year over our most recently issued volume, while
it required six months to get a forty-page bulletin printed.
It avails little for editors to be punctual and businesslike in
turning out their work, if it may then be hung up indefinitely
by the printer, with the editor deprived of any means of
amending the situation. Quite possibly state printers are
themselves the victims of a system the amendment of which
is beyond their control. Of this we have no particular knowledge.
Wherever the responsibility may justly be placed, the

Pg 311

manner in which most public printing is done in this country
offers a severe commentary upon our boasted American
efficiency.

IS WAR BECOMING MORE HORRIBLE?

There is an ancient story concerning a grave debate
indulged in by a group of English philosophers during the
Stuart period over the question why a fish does not weigh
anything when in the water. At length it occurred to one
of them to weigh a vessel of water with a fish in it, and again
with the fish removed. As a result of this simple test the
philosophers were forced to seek a new subject upon which
to exercise their wits. At the present time it seems to be
generally assumed that with the invention of new implements
of warfare and of improvements upon old ones the horrors
of war have steadily increased; in particular, that the present
war is far more horrible to those who participate in it than
any of its predecessors in the history of the human race have
been. Such a belief as this entails obvious consequences affecting
not only the peace of mind of our people but, in the last
analysis, the success of the cause to which our nation is committed.
For if it is indeed true that our young manhood is
going to certain death under circumstances more awful than
the pages of military history have hitherto ever recorded,
our willingness as individuals to send our loved ones to meet
such a fate must be seriously shaken by the prospect; while,
collectively, the will of the nation to persist in the war upon
which we have embarked will be similarly affected. In a
word, such an impression gravely threatens the morale of
the nation, including both those who go to war and those who
send them forth. That our Teutonic foemen have not been
unmindful of this is amply evidenced by the new and hellish
connotation which in recent years they have succeeded in
attaching to the word
shrecklichkeit
. To German
shrecklichkeit

we will pay our respects presently. Meanwhile we

Pg 312

desire to deal with the question whether under the influence
of modern science and invention the conduct of warfare has
in fact become increasingly horrible.

SOME LEAVES FROM THE PAST

We believe it can be shown, on the contrary, that the direct
opposite is true; that the warfare waged by primitive peoples
and in ancient times was a far more horrible procedure than
is that waged by civilized nations today. It may be taken
as axiomatic that the horrors of battle, like the transports of
love, increase as the distance between the parties concerned
diminishes. All savage warfare, and all civilized warfare as
well, until a very recent date, was waged at close range. In
ancient and in medieval times men battled hand to hand with
spear and sword and ax. The vanquished found slight opportunity
to escape and the hand of the conqueror was stayed
by no considerations of twentieth century humanity. The
chronicles of the Hebrews, the Lordâs anointed, and the
narratives of Alexander the Great and Julius CÃ¦sar tell alike
the same general tale of slaughter of the opposing warriors
and the slaughter, rapine, or enslavement, as the case might
be, of their dependents. In medieval times, it is true, under
the influence of the institution of knighthood, certain rules
foreshadowing the modern rules of war were developed. But
these more humane rules applied only to the aristocracy, the
commoner being excluded from their operation and benefits.

With the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries came two
developments of much importance for their bearing upon our
subject. The one was the application of gunpowder to the
art of war, as the result of which war was democratized;
the business of knighthood soon became as dead as CÃ¦sarâs
ghost, and as firearms improved, the distances at which opposing
armies fought slowly widened. The other was an
indirect result of the Dutch war for independence. Meditating
upon the terrible brutalities to which his people were

Pg 313

subjected by it, Hugo Grotius evolved the treatise on the
laws of war and peace which by common consent has ever
since been regarded as the foundation of modern international
law. Grotius sought, in a word, to humanize warfare
by securing the establishment by common agreement of rules
calculated to prohibit its more debasing and awful manifestations.
In the three hundred years ending with August, 1914,
much progress was made, both along the lines laid down by
Grotius and in other ways, looking to the minimizing of the
horrors of war. At the same time, ever more ingenious and
powerful death-dealing appliances were being devised for
the waging of such combat as the rules of international law
still rendered permissible.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITARIANISM

Notable progress, too, was being made along another line.
Humanitarianism in its modern connotation is the child of
the nineteenth century. To feel distress over the knowledge
that famine or other ill afflicts a distant people is a purely
modern accomplishment of which our forefathers of two or
three centuries ago were wholly innocent. As applied to
armies, the humanitarian impulse has worked a startling
revolution. Organizations designed to care for the sick and
the wounded have developed on an elaborate scale. The Red
Cross was called into being only half a century ago as an
indirect result of the horrors of the battlefield of Solferino.
It was born too late to have any share in alleviating the
miseries of our own Civil War but since that time it has constituted
an ever increasing agency for the relief of human
suffering, whether in peace or in war. Even the âunspeakable
Turkâ has been infected by the virus of humanitarianism
and the Red Crescent plays for the Mohammedan world the
rÃ´le fulfilled by the Red Cross among the nations of
Christendom.

Pg 314

OTHER AGENCIES

The progress made in recent years in the fields of
medicine and surgery has been no less striking than in that
of humanitarianism; while the development of a new social
consciousness (a concomitant, of course, of the humanitarian
movement) has resulted in throwing about the soldier who
wars for America in 1918 a set of safeguards, and in providing
him with a degree of comfort such as no other warriors
in the history of the world ever enjoyed. Against drunkenness
and vice, twin plagues of army life since the beginning
of the world, he is at least as well protected as is the civilian
at home. Libraries and clubhouses and games and lectures
are provided with unstinted generosity for his recreation and
instruction. That his mind may be free from incidental
worry, a system of life insurance on a scale hitherto undreamed
of has been evolved; while the wife or other dependents
at home are insured by the largess of a parental
government against coming to actual want during his absence.

SOME FACTS AND FIGURES

All these things will avail little to comfort the soldier or
his loved ones if it is in fact true that he is being sent to a
certain and awful death—if his span of life, after reaching
France, is limited to a few weeks, and after reaching the front
line trenches to a few hours or minutes. Let us proceed, then,
to weigh this particular fish. We can do it only approximately,
for it is inherent in the nature of warfare that accurate,
dependable statistics are commonly lacking, or
extremely difficult to obtain. The testimony of such as we
have, however, is all in support of the view that never before
in civilized warfare has the individual soldier had so good
a prospect of surviving the term of his enlistment and returning
once more to the homeland as now. It is not contended,
of course, that modern war is simply a pleasant
pastime from which all will return unscathed, but merely
that the current impression concerning its having become

Pg 315

more awful and more fatal than in times past is incorrect.
According to respectable authority the casualties in the entire
French army in proportion to mobilized strength amounted,
for the first six months of 1915, to 2.39 per cent. Since then
the ratio has steadily decreased, the figure for the last six
months of 1916 being 1.28 per cent. At the beginning of
the war, for the battles of Charleroi and the Marne, when the
French suffered more heavily than at any time since, the
casualties were 5.41 per cent of the mobilized strength of the
army. In other words during the period of greatest danger
in the entire war but five men in every hundred received
wounds, while, of these five, it is a safe generalization to say
that only one died as a result thereof.

In view of the enormous numbers of men in the present
war, the absolute figures of losses are appalling enough.
Relatively, however, the losses are lower than in many previous
wars. In no great battle of the war, probably, has the individual
soldier stood so good a chance of being wounded or
killed as did those—to mention a few cases only—who fought
at Fredericksburg or Gettysburg, at Stone River or Chickamauga,
at Waterloo, at Aspern, at Borodino, or Leipsic. At
Fredericksburg, Burnside lost, in a few hours, one-tenth of
his army, the loss in that portion actively engaged amounting
to 16 per cent; at Gettysburg, in three days, one-fifth
of the Union army and almost one-third of the Confederate
army were killed or wounded; at Chickamauga and at Stone
River over one-fourth of the Confederate forces engaged
were lost, while the casualties sustained by Grantâs army in the
seven-daysâ wilderness battles amounted to the same appalling
proportion. As to the Napoleonic wars, at Waterloo
40 per cent of the French army—30,000 out of 74,000—were
lost in a few hoursâ time; at Austerlitz, the French, although
overwhelmingly victorious, lost almost one-ninth of the army
in one dayâs fighting, while the allies lost nearly half of theirs;
at Borodino, in a single day, the victorious French suffered
casualties of 22Â½ per cent, the defeated Russians casualties

Pg 316

of 50 per cent of the armies engaged; at Aspern, a drawn
battle, both French and Austrians lost, in killed and wounded,
over one-fourth of the total armies engaged; at Albuera
over one-fourth of the French and one-fifth of the allied
armies were lost, but the British force, which bore the brunt of
the allied fighting, lost 4,100 men out of a total of 8,000
engaged. In the present war, because of an unrescinded
order, we are told, a Canadian detachment of 800 left 600
men on the field. But this is more than matched on both
sides at Gettysburg, where with no mistake in orders one
Confederate regiment lost 720 men out of 800, while a Union
regiment lost 82 per cent of the men engaged. Sixty-two
Union regiments in this war sustained losses in some single battle
in excess of 50 per cent, a record equalled on the southern
side by forty-three regiments. Those killed in action today are
as irrevocably dead as those killed in any former war; but of
those merely wounded (about four-fifths of all battle casualties)
the prospect of recovering is incomparably better than
in any previous war, while the prospect of death from disease
incurred in service is likewise vastly diminished.

BRAVERY THEN AND NOW

It is a foible of most peoples in all generations fondly to
picture themselves as braver and hardier than those of other
races and times. So, in the present war, it is commonly
assumed that greater demands upon the soldierâs fortitude
and courage are made than in times gone by. In fact, however,
bravery has been throughout the ages probably the commonest
attribute of mankind. Soldiers are as brave today
as in former times, but no more so. To contemplate a modern
bayonet charge or a fight at close grips with gun-butt and
knife is far from pleasant. But whereas such fighting is the
occasional or exceptional thing today, of old it was the normal
mode of fighting. The idea that combat should be waged at
a distance was born only with the development of smokeless
powder and high-power rifles. As late as Cromwellâs time

Pg 317

the pike was the main reliance of infantry in battle. The
favorite tactics of Napoleon were based on the idea of overwhelming
the opposing army by the shock of mass formations.
At Waterloo, for hours his splendid cavalry broke
against the British squares, riding round and round at bayonetâs
length, seeking to break their outer line. From fighting
in the open in mass formation, armies have now largely taken
to cover, even as the American Indian did; partly because
of this, partly for the other reasons noted, the dangers and
the horrors of war today have greatly diminished as compared
with former times. Our people should be made acquainted
with this fact, and both those who go to war and those who
send them forth are entitled to such comfort as may legitimately
be derived from it.

SCHRECKLICHKEIT

One general exception, however, must be taken to the
comforting conclusions which have been reached. Broadly
speaking, warfare among savages knows no rules and recognizes
no limitations of action or honor. Prisoners of war may
be slaughtered at once or reserved for the refinements of
torture. No distinction of treatment is made between warriors
and noncombatants. The lives, the liberty, and the
possessions of the conquered social group are subjected to
such disposition as the caprice or self-interest of the conquerors
may dictate. Following in the path marked out by
Grotius, slowly and painfully yet none the less surely, civilized
nations have humanized warfare to a marked degree.
The rules of civilized war distinguish between soldiers and
noncombatants. The rights of the latter, both of person and
of property, have been clearly established; even as between
contending armies numerous rules have been established, all
based on the general idea of regulating and refining war in
ways calculated to eliminate its most horrible and debasing
manifestations. In this work our own nation has played a
leading part and the rules for the guidance of the Union

Pg 318

armies adopted by President Lincoln half a century ago, still
largely guide the conduct of nations in the waging of war.

With one awful exception, however. Moved by what
atavistic influence we know not, in striking contrast to the
trend of world development during the last three hundred
years, the German government and people in the last half
century have evolved the doctrine and subscribed to the principles
of
shrecklichkeit
. As briefly characterized by Bismarck,
this policy, or principle of conduct, aims to leave to the enemy
nothing except their eyes with which to weep. It lays the ax
to the very foundation of the structure of international law,
slowly reared through three hundred years of effort. For
the rule of right and justice it substitutes the jungle law of
tooth and fang. Under its malign influence the whole circuit
of the earth is filled with spying and treason, with fraud and
strife. On the foul results of this policy, as applied to the
conduct of armies, it is superfluous to dwell when addressing
readers of the present generation. No sharper commentary
upon the sad reversion of modern Germany to the customs
and practices of savagery can be afforded than the fact
that the rules promulgated by Lincoln for the guidance of
the Union armies were drafted by Francis Lieber, one of the
most notable men ever driven from reactionary Prussia to
seek refuge in the United States.
Shrecklichkeit
, like revolutionary
France in 1792, throws down the gage of battle to
the remainder of the civilized world. In 1792, however,
revolutionary France voiced the aspirations of the future
against the dead weight of the past. Today imperial Germany
challenges the civilization of the present and the hopes
of the future in the interest of resurgent savagery. The
world is too small to contain two such antagonistic sets of
ideals and of conduct. Either Prussian
shrecklichkeit
or the
American ideal of order based on reason and justice must
prevail.

May we acquit ourselves like men and carry the fight to
the finish.

THE QUESTION BOX

The Wisconsin Historical Library has long maintained a
bureau of historical information for the benefit of those who
care to avail themselves of the service it offers. In âThe
Question Boxâ will be printed from time to time such queries,
with the answers made to them, as possess sufficient general
interest to render their publication worth while.

THE FIRST SETTLER OF BARABOO

I am not able to fix the exact date when Abraham Wood came to
Baraboo. What is the opinion of the staff as to the time? He was
supposed to be the first permanent settler. A line will be appreciated.

H. E. Cole,

Baraboo, Wisconsin.

We appreciate your difficulty in determining the time of the
advent of Abraham Wood on your river, because of the conflict in
the authorities. So far as we can determine, the account in the

Wisconsin Historical Atlas
seems to be the most authoritative. The
sketches in this volume were carefully written, and were obtained
from survivors then alive. According to that statement the first
man who attempted settlement at the Baraboo Rapids in 1837 was
Archibald Barker, who then lived at Portage. He was driven off by
the Indians. Meanwhile the treaty at Washington had been negotiated,
and there seemed more hope that a settlement might be made.
In the spring or early summer of 1839 a man named James Alban
discovered Devilâs Lake, and he went back to Portage and told Eben
Peck, first settler at Madison. Peck had just sold out at the latter
place to Robert Ream, and he and Alban set out up the Baraboo and
marked out a site at the Rapids, including the water power. As Peck
was going back (after a stay of some weeks), apparently he met
Wallace Rowan and Abraham Wood, whom he had known well at
Madison, coming up from Portage. They staked out their claim at
Lyons, where Wood spent the winter.

Pg 320

In the meanwhile James Van Slyke came up from Walworth
County in the fall of 1839 and determined to jump Peckâs claim.
Van Slyke had had his claim at Lake Geneva jumped by other parties,
and was in a bitter and retaliatory frame of mind. After staking
out his claim to the rapids of the Baraboo he went back to Walworth
and interested James Maxwell in a plan for a mill and persuaded him
to furnish the irons and equipment. Van Slyke went up in the spring
of 1840 and built a dam which was carried out by the freshet of June.
Meanwhile, Peck had brought his claim before the court at Madison
and obtained judgment against Van Slyke. The latter had already
abandoned the enterprise. Van Slyke sold his irons to Wood and
Rowan, who during the summer started a sawmill at the upper rapids.

There seems to be every evidence that the source of this account
was the Peck family, who were in a position to know the facts. If this
account is true, we suppose Wood might be called the first settler,
since he remained in the vicinity during the winter of 1839-40; but
no doubt he lived as the Indians did, if not with them, since his wife
was a squaw. He was thus not much more of a first settler than
Barker, Alban, Rowan, Peck, or Van Slyke.

To return to Wood. We are unable to discover when or how
he came to Wisconsin. He was probably a free trapper or trader,
one of the rough frontiersmen of Scotch descent from the backwoods
of Canada. In the course of trade he came in contact with the
Decorah chiefs and took to wife one of the daughters of the tribe.
He had probably been on the Baraboo often before 1839, since his
squawâs native village was near its mouth, and there her father died
in 1836. Wood was not then at the Baraboo, since he was wintering
near Madison. He was not at this site in 1832, so sometime between
that date and 1836 he set up his wigwam at Squaw Point on Third
Lake opposite the modern city of Madison.

His neighbor at this place was Wallace Rowan, a rough, good-hearted
frontiersman from Indiana with a white wife. There is a
good account of Rowan in
History of Dane County
(Chicago, 1880),
382-83. Rowan seems to have permitted Wood to place his wigwam,
or whatever kind of dwelling he had, on his claim, which he entered
with William B. Long in 1835.

Pg 321

Wood was on Third Lake during the winter of 1836-37, and
during the summer of 1837 he aided in building Madison, being employed
as a mechanic on Peckâs log house. It seems probable that
Wood spent the winter of 1837-38 at the same place, as there is no
record of him at Portage before the spring of 1838. Probably he
moved away from Squaw Point because Rowan that spring sold his
claim and improvements to William B. Slaughter. Rowan moved
to Poynette and opened his noted tavern. Wood went to Portage,
where, no doubt, he had often been before with the relatives of his
squaw.

In 1838 work was begun on the Portage canal, and Wood opened
a house of liquid refreshment just below Carpenterâs on the Wisconsin
River. There, probably in the spring of 1839, Wood killed
Pawnee Blanc, a noted Winnebago chief. Woodâs brother-in-law,
John T. La Ronde, tells the sordid story in
Wisconsin Historical
Collections
,
VII
, 360. He does not give the date of the murder;
Moses Paquette says (
idem
,
XII
, 431) that it was in 1837. Paquette
probably remembered that it was after his fatherâs death in 1836; but
it could hardly have been in 1837 since Wood was then at Madison.
Our inference is that the death of Pawnee Blanc occurred in 1838
or 1839. Wood was probably anxious to leave Portage at this time;
moreover in 1839 Winfield Scott went to Portage and held a council
with the Winnebago concerning their removal from Wisconsin.
Wood knew the Baraboo Valley would soon be open for settlement.
He persuaded his old friend, Rowan, to go prospecting with him.
But on their way out they found Peck and Alban had been there
before them. Wood, not wanting to go back to Portage, spent the
winter in the Baraboo woods; and the next autumn (1840) with
Wallace Rowan began a sawmill, as La Ronde states (
Wis. Hist.
Colls.
, VII
, 360).

The foregoing hypothesis appears to reconcile all the accounts
except Moses Paquetteâs date of the killing of Pawnee Blanc. The
record of Woodâs trial may sometime come to light. Possibly it may
be preserved in the records of the court of Brown County, still kept
at the courthouse at Green Bay.

THE CHIPPEWA RIVER DURING THE FRENCH AND
BRITISH RÃGIMES

Within a short time we expect to issue a special edition of our
local paper that will cover the development of the Chippewa Valley.
It struck me that possibly you could furnish me considerable data
covering the early history of this section of the valley.

Al J. Hartley,

Cornell, Wisconsin.

Probably the first white person to pass the mouth of the Chippewa
was Father Louis Hennepin, who ascended the Mississippi in
1630. He describes the Chippewa under the name of RiviÃ¨re des
Boeufs (Buffalo). It is probable that in his time the Beef Slough
was part of the Chippewa channel, and the present Buffalo River an
affluent of the Chippewa proper. In 1682 La Salle wrote a description
of the rivers of Wisconsin in a letter, the translation of which
is found in volume sixteen of the
Collections
of the Wisconsin Historical
Society. He says âAbout thirty leagues, ascending always
in the same direction [above Black River], one comes to the RiviÃ¨re
des Boeufs which is as wide at its mouth as that of the Islinois. It is
called by that name owing to the great number of those animals found
there; it is followed from ten to twelve leagues, the water being
smooth and without rapids, bordered by mountains which widen out
from time to time, forming meadows. There are several islands at
its mouth, which is bordered by woods on both sides.â La Salleâs
description was without doubt taken from the account of Hennepin.

The next visitor to this region was Duluth, who in 1680 rescued
Father Hennepin from his captors, the Sioux Indians, and brought
him down the Mississippi and by the Wisconsin-Fox route to Green
Bay. Duluth has not left any description of the Chippewa.

In 1685 Nicolas Perrot was governor of all of this region.
In the
Proceedings
of this Society for 1915 you will find an account
of Perrotâs experiences and of the Fort Antoine that he built at the
mouth of the Chippewa. Perrot called the stream River of the Sauteurs,
which was the French name for the Chippewa tribe, whom they
first met at the Sault, hence Saulteurs or Sauters. Perrot seems to
have been the first person to use the name Sauteur or Chippewa for
the river. It so appears on a very remarkable map drawn in 1688,

Pg 323

and now in Paris. A facsimile of this is in the Wisconsin Historical
Library, at Madison, and a photograph appears in L. P. Kelloggâs,

Early Narratives of the Northwest
(New York, 1917), 342. At
Fort
St.
Antoine, Perrot in 1689 held a great ceremony, taking
possession of all the Sioux country for the King of France. A translation
of this document is found in volume eleven of the
Wisconsin
Historical Collections
, 35-36.

The name of the river indicates that the Chippewa was the home
of some portion of the Chippewa tribe. In the early eighteenth century
this valley became the battle ground of the great feud between
the Sioux and Chippewa Indians, which lasted nearly one hundred
and fifty years. Much interesting material on this subject may be
found in
Minnesota Historical Collections
, volume five, which is a
history of the Chippewa tribe by a half-breed, W. W. Warren.

In the year 1766, three years after the French had ceded all this
territory to the British crown, the noted explorer, Jonathan Carver,
ascended the Mississippi and attempted to bring about a peace between
the warring Sioux and Chippewa. The next year he returned
from Mackinac, and with a stock of goods ascended the Chippewa
River, at whose headwaters he found a Chippewa village of one hundred
fine stout warriors. Their customs, however, were very filthy.
This is, so far as we know, the first recorded voyage through the
Chippewa valley. No doubt, however, many fur traders had preceded
Carver, for he speaks of engaging a pilot to accompany him.

In the last years of the French rÃ©gime there was reported a
copper mine on this river, which was then called for a time âBon
Secoursâ or Good Help River. Carver calls it the Chippewa River.
About six years after Carverâs visit a British trader named Hugh
Boyle was killed at this river. See
Wisconsin Historical Collections
,

XVIII
, 312-13. According to the court of inquiry ordered by the
British officials, the affair was his own fault.

The British traders continued to trade on this river, notwithstanding
the danger caused by the fierce intertribal wars. In 1805
the United States government sent Zebulon M. Pike, a young army
lieutenant, to ascend the Mississippi and warn British traders that
this was then American territory. It became so by the treaty of
1783, but the British kept the forts on the Great Lakes until 1796,

Pg 324

and all had continued to act until Pikeâs visit as if the upper Mississippi
region belonged to the British. Pike found that the traders
avoided the Chippewa River because of the danger of falling in with
war parties of contesting Indians. He passed the riverâs mouth about
dusk.

In 1820 an American expedition headed by Lewis Cass descended
the Mississippi, and from that time on there were numerous boats
going up and down. The first steamboat ascended to the Falls of

St.
Anthony in 1823. Some very early logging expeditions in 1822
and 1829 are described in the
Wisconsin Historical Collections
,
II
,
132-41, and
V
, 244-54.

The earliest permanent settlers were the Cadottes. See
Wisconsin
Historical Collections
,
XIX
, 171, and
Minnesota Historical
Collections
, volume five.

THE CAREER OF COLONEL G. W. MANYPENNY

Can you give me any reference to any publication or record in
your library relating to G. W. Manypenny, who was Indian commissioner
in 1855 and in that year made a treaty with the Chippewa
Indians of Wisconsin?

E. S. Gaylord,

Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Colonel George W. Manypenny, who was Indian commissioner
in President Pierceâs administration, was not a Wisconsin man. He
was born in Pennsylvania, and appointed from Ohio. His home was
in Columbus, Ohio, and as early as 1835 he was editor of a prominent
Democratic paper at that place. His appointment was no doubt
a reward for journalistic services during the campaign; but he seems
to have taken his duties seriously and to have undertaken the rÃ´le
of a defender of the red men against the extortions of unscrupulous
speculators. In doing this he incurred the enmity of a powerful
political clique among whom was Senator Benton.

Manypenny went west in August, 1853, and made the series of
treaties that opened up the territories of Kansas and Nebraska for
settlement. It is claimed that he acted in the interests of the South
with regard to the Pacific railroad. See Wisconsin Historical
Society
Proceedings
, 1912, 80. In 1855 Manypenny made the treaty

Pg 325

with the Mississippi bands of Chippewa at Washington, whither their
chiefs had been conducted by Henry M. Rice.

Manypenny retired from office in March, 1857, and returned
to Columbus where, in 1859, he purchased a half interest in the

Ohio Statesman
and was its editor for three years. In 1862 he retired
to become manager of the state public works, of which he was one of
the lessees. His interest in the Indians continued, and in 1876 he
was appointed a chairman of the commission to investigate the troubles
that had led to the Sioux outbreak of that year. In 1880 he
published a book entitled
Our Indian Wards
(Cincinnati, Robert
Clark &
Co.
), which is a plea for more fairness in the management
of Indian affairs, and a recital of many of their wrongs.

The date of his death we have not ascertained, nor whether he
left descendants. An inquiry of E. W. Randall, secretary of the
Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society, at Columbus, would
doubtless put you in possession of these facts.

TREATY HALL AND OLD LA POINTE

Will you kindly advise me what âTreaty Hall,â La Pointe,
Madeline Island, stands for historically? When and by whom was
it built? Some say it was erected in 1836 and others say 1857 or
1858. The treaties were signed before the latter date, so why call
it âTreaty Hallâ? Any information you can give on the subject
will be greatly appreciated.

Mrs. Frank H. Jerrard,

Representative
St.
Paul Chapter, D. A. R.,

St.
Paul, Minnesota.

The information we have obtained concerning the building on
Madeline Island now called âTreaty Hallâ does not give conclusive
proof of the origin of the building. One fact seems clear—the name
âTreaty Hallâ was not applied to it until the eighties of the last
century, and the building was not put up to accommodate the negotiating
of a treaty. Whether a treaty was negotiated in this building
or not is another question. As a rule Indian treaty proceedings
were held in the open air; if any covering was desired, a kind of
shade was built of boughs, or a circle was temporarily enclosed with
poles, boughs, and mats. Nevertheless it is not improbable that in

Pg 326

the northern region of Madeline Island, with the cold winds from the
lake blowing in, a treaty might have been held under shelter, and
that some appropriate building might have been thus used.

There were only two treaties held on Madeline Island, that of
1842 and that of 1854. The former was concluded October 4, 1842,
and the commissioner was Robert Stuart, who had been for many
years the representative of the American Fur Company at Mackinac.
He was at the time of this treaty Indian superintendent at Detroit.
The inference is strong that Stuart was on terms of friendship, even
intimacy, with the American Fur Companyâs agents at La Pointe.
These were at the time of the treaty of 1842 Charles H. Oakes and
Dr. Charles W. Borup, both of whom were present at the treaty.
Moreover,
Rev.
Alfred Brunson of Prairie du Chien, a prominent
Methodist missionary in early-day Wisconsin, was appointed Indian
agent at La Pointe in the autumn of 1842. He reached his post of
duty very late in the year and says both in his printed reminiscences
and in unpublished manuscripts in our Societyâs possession that there
were no agency buildings, but that Dr. Borup had a large storehouse
prepared for a council.

With regard to the Treaty of 1854, it was signed September 30
of that year. The commissioners were Henry C. Gilbert and Daniel
B. Herriman. Among the witnesses was L. H. Wheeler, whose sons
are among our correspondents. H. M. Rice was likewise present.
We believe the Minnesota Historical Society is in possession of the
latterâs papers. If so, something might be gleaned from them.

COMMUNICATIONS

MORE LIGHT ON THE ORIGINATOR OF âWINNEQUAHâ

As a medieval Madisonian, I protest against your summary
termination of the activities of âCapâ Barnes at â1873 or 1874,
perhaps later.â
[127]
He was positively an institution in and of Madison,
and I positively remember him and his steamboat line at least as late
as 1889. His steamboats, the
Scutenaubequon
and the
Waubishnepawau
,
lent new terrors to the aboriginal tongues. His later
divergence to
Silenzioso
bore witness to the liveliness, if not the
expertness, of his linguistic imagination. No Madisonian of the
Victorian age, so to speak, will recall âAngleworm Stationâ without
a warming of the heart to the memory of âCapâ Barnes. His midwinter
straw hat and his irrepressible gaiety are intimately associated
with our tenderest Madison memories. Picnics? Madison was the
home of them, and âCapâ Barnes and his steamboat, in combination,
were preÃ«ssential to them. It was âCapâ Barnes who hit upon the
first discovered practical use of the abortive capitol park driven
well: âPull it up, saw it into lengths, and sell it to the farmers for
post holes.â

Statesmen, prophets, and nabobs, Mr. Editor, may pass into
oblivion—but touch reverently on the memory of âCapâ Barnes.
Madison would never have been the Madison of its golden age without
him.

A HISTORY OF OUR STATE FLAG

I have just received the first copy of the new
Wisconsin Magazine
of History
, and think it a splendid idea. Of course, I have not had
time to examine it carefully, but I did run across the short article
with reference to the state flag, which seems rather to carry the idea
that Wisconsin had no state flag at any time prior to 1913.

Pg 328

I call your attention to a letter written by me to H. W. Rood,
Custodian of Memorial Hall, under date of January 5, 1911, in
which I said:

In response to your verbal request of a few days since, I have investigated
the matter of the state flag of Wisconsin.

Chapter 215 of the Laws of 1863, published April 10th 1863, provided
in part as follows:

âWhenever the state flags of the regiments in the service of the United
States, from this state, shall have become so far worn and damaged by
service that it is deemed necessary to replace them, and the officers commanding
any of the said regiments shall inform the governor of such fact,
and make requisition for new flags, the governor is hereby authorized to
cause to be furnished to such regiments new flags; the state flag to be of the
design, plan and material as adopted by this legislature, by joint resolution
No. 44, Senate; and one of the said flags shall be inscribed with the
names of the battles in which such regiments shall have taken an honorable
part.â

I do not find that there was a joint resolution
No.
44 of that year.
Resolution
No.
4, however, is evidently the one referred to and that
provides as follows:

âResolved, by the senate, the assembly concurring, that the following
be and is hereby adopted as the design for a state flag for the state
of Wisconsin:

âState Flag.—To be of dark blue silk, with the arms of the State of
Wisconsin painted or embroidered in silk on the obverse side, and the arms
of the United States, as prescribed in paragraph 1435 of 'new army regulations,â
painted or embroidered in silk on the reverse side; the name of the
regiment, when used as a regimental flag, to be in a scroll beneath the
state arms.

âThe size of the regiment colors to be six feet, six inches fly, and
six feet deep on the pike; the length of pike for said colors, including
spear and ferrule, to be nine feet, ten inches; the fringe yellow, cords
and tassels blue and white silk intermixed.â

This resolution was approved March 25, 1863.

Chapter 248 of the laws of 1864, published April 15, 1864, repealed
chapter 215 of the laws of 1863, but provided in part as follows:

âThe state flag to be of the design, plan and material as adopted
by the legislature of this state by joint resolution
No.
44, senate, at the
session of 1863, and one of said flags shall be inscribed with the names
of the battles in which such regiment or battery shall have taken an
honorable part.â

Joint Resolution
No.
6, approved March 3, 1863, read as follows:

âResolved, that the superintendent of public property be and he
is hereby authorized to purchase two national flags and two state flags,
one each of which he shall place over the presidentâs chair in the senate
chamber, and one each over the speakerâs chair in the assembly chamber,
where they shall remain during each session of the legislature.â

Pg 329

I do not find any other laws or resolutions relating to this flag until
the adoption of the revised statutes of 1878, section 4978 of which provides
in part that

âThe following acts of the legislature, passed in the several years
hereinafter enumerated, shall be repealed, that is to say:â

Then follows a table of the laws thus repealed and among them I find
chapter 248 of the laws of 1864. I believe that this ends the legislation
in relation to a state flag and that the State of Wisconsin no longer has
such a flag.

In the pamphlet published by Doctor Thwaites entitled
Wisconsinâs
Emblems and Sobriquet
he refers to chapter 167 of the laws of Wisconsin
of 1907 (section 633m of the Wisconsin statutes), which provides:

âThe organization, armament and discipline of the Wisconsin national
guard shall be the same as that which is now, or may hereafter be
prescribed for the regular and volunteer armies of the United States.â

He seems to think that the state flag is now as provided in paragraph
222 of the United States army regulations for 1904—the colors to be of
silk, five feet, six inches fly, and four feet, four inches on the pike, which
shall be nine feet long, including spear head and ferrule. From this
article I should assume that he considers that chapter 167 of the laws
of 1907 is the law that repealed the prior law providing for a state flag.
As will be seen from the references herein given, this law was repealed
upon the adoption of the revised statutes of 1878.

This may not be of any particular importance, except that as
a matter of historical accuracy, it should be noted that Wisconsin,
in fact, did for several years have a State Flag.

Very truly yours,

Winfield W. Gilman

SURVEY OF HISTORICAL ACTIVITIES

THE SOCIETY AND THE STATE

During the quarter ending December 31, 1917, five new life and
twenty-four annual members were added to the State Historical
Society. The new life members are: Henry F. De Puy, of New York
City; Walter S. Lacher, of La Grange, Illinois; Thomas E. Lyons,
of Madison; Chester H. Thordarson, of Chicago; and J. Russell
Wheeler, of Columbus, Wisconsin. The list of new annual members
is as follows:
Rev.
A. S. Badger, Waukesha; George Banta, Menasha;
George Banta, Jr., Menasha; Dr. Robert C. Brown, Milwaukee;
Arthur J. Dopp, Waukesha; Emerson Ela, Madison; Judge Oscar M.
Fritz, Milwaukee; Professor J. L. Gillen, Madison; L. H. Gingles,
Waukesha; George Bird Grinnell, New York City; William G.
Hanson, Milwaukee; George C. Holmes, Madison; John T. Kenney,
Madison; Professor A. C. Kingsford, Baraboo; Gilbert L. Lacher,
Chicago; Judge David W. Maloney, Ladysmith; Dean Lois K.
Mathews, Madison; Carl E. Nord, Sioux City; Cyril A. Peerenboom,
Appleton; A. L. Saltzstein, Milwaukee; Judge James E. Thomas,
Waukesha; Frank J. Wilder, Boston; Edwin E. Witte, Madison;
and Henry M. Youmans, Waukesha.

Dr. James W. Vance of Madison died October 31, 1917. Dr.
Vance had been a member of the State Historical Society for thirty
years. Mr. Walter P. Bishop, vice president of the E. P. Bacon
Company of Milwaukee and since 1909 a member of the State
Historical Society, died October 10, 1917. Mr. Michael A. Hurley
of Wausau, a member of the Society since 1906, died September 25,
1917. Mr. Archie E. Wood, of Whitehall, died October 8, 1917.

Rev.
Eugene G. Updike, of Madison, whose completion of a twenty-seven-year
pastorate of the First Congregational Church was noted
in a recent number of this magazine, died at the Madison General
Hospital December 24, 1917. Dr. Updike was a life member of the
State Historical Society, and throughout his long pastorate at
Madison had taken an active part in civic and educational affairs
generally.

Hon. Thomas E. Nash, of Grand Rapids, for sixteen years a
life member of the State Historical Society, died at his home December
13, 1917. Mr. Nash was brought to Wisconsin in infancy by
his parents. He had been engaged in railroad work for many years
when in 1882 he was appointed by Postmaster General Vilas chief

Pg 331

clerk of the post office department and the following year general
superintendent of the railway mail service. In 1888 Mr. Nash
organized the Nekoosa Pulp and Paper Company with which he
continued to be prominently associated until ill health forced his
retirement from active work a few years ago.

Volume
XXIV
of the Societyâs
Collections
, entitled
Frontier
Retreat on the Upper Ohio, 1779-1781
, copy for which was sent
to the state printer in December, 1916, at length came from the
press in December, 1917, and was distributed the first of the year
to the Societyâs members and exchanges. The reading of galley
proof on Volume
XXV
of the
Collections
was completed early in
December. The contents of this volume, entitled
An English Settler
in Pioneer Wisconsin: the Letters of Edwin Bottomley, 1842-1850
,
differ markedly from those of any preceding volume of the
Collections
.
The papers printed present a rarely intimate picture of the
life and problems of the pioneer Wisconsin farmer and constitute,
it is believed, a valuable contribution of source material to the
history of the territorial period of Wisconsinâs development.

With the establishment of the
Wisconsin Magazine of History

it is no longer necessary, as it has been for upwards of a generation,
to print historical contributions and discussions in the annual
volume known as the
Proceedings
of the Society. Shorn of this supplementary
historical matter, the official report of the activities of
the Society and its auxiliaries for 1917 shrinks to a document of
less than 100 pages. Copy for this was sent to the state printer
in January. Should the
Magazine
prove, on sufficient trial, to
justify the continuance of its existence, the scope and character of
the contents of the
Proceedings
for 1917 will set the standard,
presumably, for the issues of succeeding years.

A brief statement concerning four important editorial enterprises
now being prosecuted may be in order. Work on the series
of volumes designed to constitute a documentary history of Wisconsinâs
constitution, which has been prosecuted intermittently by
the Superintendent for the past two years, has now reached a stage
where it seems likely that copy for one volume can be sent to the
printer before the close of the Societyâs present fiscal year. Probably
four volumes will be requisite to complete the series. After the
editing of the first one shall have been completed, the remaining
ones may be expected to follow in fairly rapid order. Work on the
second volume of the Draper Calendar series, mention of which
was made in the
Magazine
for September, 1917, has progressed
haltingly, due to the war-time disruption of the office staff. It now
seems safe to predict that the copy will be ready for the printer by
the end of the month. The other enterprises alluded to were both

Pg 332

initiated in the autumn of 1917. Dr. Kellogg began work at that
time on the preparation of a volume of source material pertaining to
the Indian treaties and land cessions which are of more particular
interest to Wisconsin. This project has long been in mind, but
its execution was necessarily deferred until the search for documents
in the Indian Office Files, begun three years ago, should be
completed. Dr. Oliver began in September the editing of a volume
of source material in the Societyâs manuscript collection pertaining
to Wisconsinâs activities in the Civil War. With this volume
will be initiated a Civil War series of the
Collections
which will in
time, it is hoped, run to many volumes.

A note may be inserted here concerning three items of lesser
scope and importance than the foregoing, all of them bibliographical
in character. A trenchant and thoroughgoing report on the state
archives situation in Wisconsin, prepared for the Society by Mr.
Theodore Blegen in the summer of 1917, was sent to the printer early
in the winter. Copy for a supplementary checklist of the collection
of newspapers in the Historical Library to list the accessions
from the time of publication in 1911 of the Societyâs monumental

Annotated Catalogue of Newspaper Files
down to January 1, 1918,
has been under preparation for more than a year. It has at length
been sent to the printer, and will appear in due time as one of the
Societyâs
Bulletins of Information
. Taken in conjunction with
the
Annotated Catalogue
, this bulletin will afford a complete index
to the Societyâs splendid collection of newspapers, the second largest,
it is believed, in America. It is hoped that in the future, annual
supplements of the previous yearâs accumulations may be issued
in connection with the annual checklist of
Periodicals and Newspapers
Currently Received
by the Library. In February, 1917, the
Society began the publication of a monthly
Checklist of Wisconsin
Public Documents
the contents of each number pertaining to the
state documents issued during the preceding month. This publication
has proved of much usefulness, apparently, and is in widespread
demand by librarians, students of the social sciences, and
governmental departments. A cumulative checklist of all state
documents issued during the year 1917 has been prepared and will
be issued as soon as practicable.

The project for the initial volume of the Societyâs Hollister
Pharmaceutical Series, made possible by the bequest of the late
Colonel and Mrs. Hollister of Madison, has at length assumed definite
and, it is believed, interesting form. According to the original plan,
Dr. Edward Kremers of the University Pharmacy Department undertook
to translate and edit for the Society Pierre Jartuâs notable
treatise on the ginseng plant. In the course of the work this project

Pg 333

has gradually enlarged until now, with the coÃ¶peration of Dr. Richtmann,
it is proposed to prepare a comprehensive treatise of the several
aspects, pharmaceutical, commercial, and otherwise, of the history
of ginseng. Such a volume should worthily initiate this unique
scientific series for which the Society has long been planning.

Colonel John Hicks of Oshkosh, publisher of the
Daily Northwestern

and one of the best known newspaper men in Wisconsin,
died suddenly at San Antonio, Texas, December 20, 1917. Colonel
Hicks was much interested in Wisconsin history, in the making of
which he had been for fifty years an active participant. At the
time of his death, he was engaged in writing his reminiscences for
publication in the
Northwestern
, and within a few days of his demise
had taken up with the State Historical Society the question of
possible publication by it of his reminiscences in book form. As
a result of Colonel Hickâs public beneficence, statues of Chief Oshkosh
and of Carl Schurz adorn his home city, while in several of the public
schools are bronze busts of prominent Americans for whom the
buildings are severally named.

Mr. William H. Ellsworth of Milwaukee, one of Wisconsinâs
best known archeological collectors, died November 6, 1917. At the
time of his death Mr. Ellsworth was vice president of the Wisconsin
Archeological Society. To the work of that institution he had
devoted a large part of his time and means. Valuable archeological
collections made by him are found in the museums of Beloit College,
in the Minnesota Historical Society, and in the Milwaukee Public
Museum.

John F. Appleby, inventor of the Appleby twine binder, died
at his home in Chicago, November 8, 1917. Mr. Appleby was one
of the notable Wisconsin inventors who have contributed materially
to the scientific and economic development of the country. During
the decade of the fifties, when the great West was unfolding its agricultural
riches, the farmers suddenly realized that the only limitation
upon the amount of their wheat acreage was their ability to
harvest the crop. The McCormick reaper had already made its
appearance, but it served only to cut the grain, leaving it lying loose
upon the ground to be bound by hand. Some device for holding the
grain and binding it into sheaves was essential before the wheat
acreage of the West could be materially increased. After years
of experimentation in a little shop in Beloit, Appleby announced the
construction of a mechanical twine binder. The original model of
his invention, which is substantially identical with the device now
in use on scores of thousands of farms in America and abroad, may
be seen in the museum of the State Historical Society at Madison.

Pg 334

Mr. Christian Abrahamson, of Chicago, has recently painted a
portrait of former Supreme Court Judge J. E. Dodge, of Milwaukee,
for presentation to the State Historical Society. A replica
of the portrait has also been prepared for the Supreme Court room in
the Capitol.

Mr. C. E. Freeman, of Menomonie, Wisconsin, has presented
to the Society an interesting document pertaining to the railroad
farm-mortgage projects of the fifties in Wisconsin. Readers of Mr.
Merkâs
Economic History of Wisconsin During the Civil War Decade
,
published by the Society last year, need not be told how important
was the rÃ´le played by the railroad farm mortgage in the economic
and political annals of early Wisconsin. The document presented
by Mr. Freeman is a contract between the La Crosse and Milwaukee
Railroad and a farmer, whereby the railroad company agrees to
cancel the interest on the individualâs farm mortgage in return
for the relinquishment by the latter of his prospective dividends on
his railroad stock. This was a central feature of the farm mortgage
scheme, yet at the time of writing his
Economic History
, Mr. Merk
was unable to uncover any direct documentary evidence concerning
it. This hiatus in the Societyâs collection of historical material
pertaining to the subject of railroad farm mortgages is now filled by
the gift of Mr. Freeman.

A fine bronze bas relief of Mary Elizabeth Mears, better known,
perhaps, by her pen name, Nellie Wildwood, has been received by
the Society from her daughter in New York. The bas relief is the
work of another daughter of Mrs. Mears, Helen Farnsworth Mears,
who was for many years prior to her death in 1916 one of Wisconsinâs
most notable artists. The âRecollectionsâ of Mrs. Mears
were published in the
Proceedings
of the Society for 1916. The
Madison Art Association has secured for hanging in the State Historical
Museum a copy of Miss Mearsâs Augustus
St.
Gaudens.

Colonel Michael Frank, âfather of the free public school system
of Wisconsin,â was born in New York in 1804 and died in Kenosha
in 1895. He came to Southport (now Kenosha) to reside in October,
1839. Three months later, on January 1, 1840, he began keeping
a diary. Upon its conclusion, December 31, 1890, this work
had continued half a century and filled thirty-nine bound manuscript
volumes. Throughout this half-century Colonel Frank figured as one
of the prominently useful citizens of the territory and state. His
voluminous diary has now come to the State Historical Society
from its possessor, Mr. F. H. Lyman, of Kenosha, an old neighbor
and friend of Colonel Frank. The diary is well preserved and written
in an excellent hand. Although only a cursory examination has
as yet been made of its contents, it seems evident that the work will

Pg 335

prove a valuable aid to students interested in this period of Wisconsinâs
history.

MARY ELIZABETH MEARS

From a bas relief owned by the Wisconsin Historical Society

A collection of papers of Governor Nelson Dewey, consisting
principally of a business account book and several annual volumes
of his diary, has been presented to the Society by Mr. R. A. Watkins
of Lancaster. The diary of Governor Dewey seems to have been
widely scattered. Some volumes of it have long been in the Historical
Library, and several more are in the possession of a resident of
Cassville.

Several interesting additions of noncurrent newspaper files were
made to the Library during the quarter ending December 31, 1917.
Most interesting locally, perhaps, is a file of
Lucifer
, 1884-98, in
fifteen bound volumes. Publication of
Lucifer
was begun at Madison
in 1882; later it was continued at Milwaukee until the demise
of the paper in 1898. Published in German, it was the organ of
the Turner societies, and manifested a liberal and anti-Catholic
viewpoint. To the Societyâs slowly-growing file of photostatic copies
of the
Boston News Letter
all known existing issues for the years
1726-29, inclusive, were acquired during the quarter. Other files of
Massachusetts papers acquired are the Newburyport
Evening Union

(daily), January 1-September 18, 1851, and
Russellâs Gazette
(Boston,
semi-weekly), January-July, 1800. Finally, two Ohio papers
were added: the Cleveland
Recorder
, 1896-97, and July-December,
1899, in four volumes, and the Cincinnati
Graphic
, August, 1885-November,
1886, in two volumes.

From Captain George Jackson of Chicago the Society has received
a rare volume possessed of much sentimental interest. It is
âDr. Mort. Lutherâs
Lesser Catechism
,â published in New York in
1842. But one other copy of the book is known to be in existence
and this is in private hands. The
Lesser Catechism
was the first book
in the Norwegian language to be printed in America.

A scrapbook filled with clippings concerning the Kansas troubles
and the Civil War has been presented to the State Historical Society
by Louis W. Bridgman, son of Edward Bridgman, who died in Madison
in August, 1915. Mr. Bridgman migrated to âBleeding Kansasâ
from Massachusetts in the spring of 1856. Staking out a claim near
Osawatomie, he soon took up living quarters with the brother of
Susan B. Anthony, who was also a Massachusetts crusader in the
cause of freedom. To their cabin one evening late in August, 1856,
came John Brown with his band of tired followers. Here they spent
the night and were having breakfast the next morning, when news
arrived of the impending attack upon Osawatomie by a large band
of proslavery Missourians. Leaving the unfinished meal, Brown
and his men started to meet the invaders. Bridgman and Anthony

Pg 336

followed as soon as they could pull their cooking utensils from the
open fire. Thus Bridgman participated in Osawatomie, John
Brownâs most notable battle, and lived to become probably the last
survivor of Brownâs band of followers on that day.

A few years later, having returned to Massachusetts, he enlisted
in the Thirty-seventh Infantry in which he served during the Civil
War. A school teacher by profession, he wrote frequent letters to
the press, both during his Civil War career and in later years, describing
his experiences, and retailing his recollections. The scrapbook
now presented by his son, and largely made up of such clippings,
constitutes a valuable contribution to the Societyâs collection of
Civil War material.

The September number of the
Magazine
contained an account
of the gift to the state of Perrot State Park, including in its limits
Trempealeau Mountain and the site of Perrotâs âfortâ or wintering
place of 1689. It is gratifying to be able to record the gift at Christmas
time of another splendid park site to the state. Mr. Martin
Pattison of Superior is the donor whose enlightened generosity makes
possible the preservation for public use and enjoyment of the Manitou
Falls of Black River, some fifteen miles out of Superior. Mr. Pattison
has been quietly at work for several years securing the title to
some 600 acres of woodland around the falls, âDouglas Countyâs
most cherished beauty spot,â in order to make this public disposition
of it. Thus another bit of historic Wisconsin scenery gives
promise of being permanently preserved in its virgin state for the
enjoyment of future generations of Wisconsin citizens.

During the holiday season the State Historical Museum had on
exhibit a small Christmas tree, decorated with patriotic emblems
of all the allied countries. Diminutive flags representing the national
colors, Red Cross flags, food conservation buttons, a miniature Red
Cross service flag, tiny bundles of liberty bonds, diminutive airplanes,
and machine guns were all displayed. Small gilt discs, representing
each of the camps in which Wisconsin boys are training, were also
displayed. All of the decorations were arranged so as to embody
the red, white, and blue color scheme.

Mr. Charles E. Graves, formerly exchange librarian of the
University of Illinois, became librarian of the Minnesota Historical
Society at
St.
Paul, November 1, 1917.

During the closing months of 1917 the Minnesota Historical
Society moved into its splendid new home which has been in the
process of erection during the last two years. As the historical
development of Wisconsin and of Minnesota has much in common,
it is but natural that the relations between the historical societies
of the two states should be cordial and intimate. That the further

Pg 337

career of the Minnesota Historical Society shall be such that before
many years the new home will prove to be as inadequate as the old
one has long been, is the best wish we, in behalf of the State Historical
Society of Wisconsin, can extend to it at this season of congratulation.

The Michigan Historical Commission is actively engaged in a
campaign to save the important state documents and archives of the
commonwealth. Recently the original copy of the first Michigan
constitution (1835) was found in the state capitol hidden away in
an old tin can, where it had been placed many years ago. The ends
of the document were so badly mutilated that the names of some of
the signers could no longer be read. Appropriate treatment to
insure against further deterioration of this priceless manuscript
was applied, and it is now suitably housed in the capitol building.
The preliminary step looking to the establishment of an archival
department for Michigan has already been taken by the historical
commission. Messrs. F. B. Streeter and J. H. Russell have been
engaged to collect, arrange, and classify the archives of the state,
and have already entered upon this important work.

SOME WISCONSIN PUBLIC DOCUMENTS

AUGUST-DECEMBER, 1917

In a bulletin published by the Wisconsin Highway Commission
in September, 1917, on the state trunk highway law, the announcement
is made that there is available from the federal government
$128,361.07. During the next four years it is estimated there will
be a total of $1,925,416.05 available for road construction in Wisconsin.
The federal law provides that a state, in order to receive
this appropriation, must set aside each year an amount at least
equal to that provided by the national government. The money
thus derived may be expended upon any public road over which the
United States mails are now or may hereafter be transported. The
State Highway Commission predicts that by the close of the year
1918 Wisconsin will have a system of travelable roads connecting
all county seats and all the principal centers of population in the
state. Wisconsin is already one of the leading good-roads states
in the country; under the operation of the new law this position
of leadership should easily be retained.

The
Biennial Report
of the State Superintendent of Public
Instruction, issued in September, 1917, indicates that the two years
just closed have been the most fruitful and active in the entire history
of public education in Wisconsin. The state educational staff has
been increased by the addition of a supervisor of manual training,

Pg 338

a supervisor of tests and measurements, an editorial and statistical
secretary, and an additional supervisor of city and village grades.
The report is particularly valuable in that it includes not only a
compilation of all the data dealing with the public schools, but also
a system of graphs, diagrams, and charts which set forth in striking
manner the educational facts of the state. By these illustrations
the reader is able to see on a single page all the facts relating to
any one phase of education.

A most suggestive pamphlet entitled
Illiteracy and Americanization
,
prepared by Amy Bronsky, was issued from the office of the
state superintendent of public instruction in October, 1917. The
vital importance of educating and Americanizing every person within
our borders is well set forth. According to the census of 1910,
Wisconsin had 57,769 illiterates over ten years of age, and 120,665
non-English speaking residents over ten years of age. Miss Bronsky
adds that, notwithstanding the efforts made to reduce this number,
it is probable that it has been growing larger rather than smaller
since the year 1910. Wisconsinâs percentage of illiteracy (3.2)
is lower than that of the country at large, but not so low as in two
of our neighboring states, Minnesota (3) and Iowa (1.7). By the
establishment of the continuation schools, night sessions, reading
circles, and other allied agencies, it is believed that the next decade
will show a considerable decrease in the percentage of illiteracy.

The
Proceedings
of the Wisconsin State Conference of Charities
and Corrections for 1916 deal almost exclusively with the one problem
of feeble-mindedness. Never before has the importance of this
subject been brought so strikingly to the attention of the social
workers of Wisconsin. The first report ever submitted dealing with
these unfortunates in our midst was made at this conference. It
reveals the fact, surprising to most people, that there are over 13,000
of them in the state. Of this number only 5,000 can be accommodated
in the institutions that are now provided. The imperative need of
securing additional facilities for their care and instruction was the
chief problem dealt with by the conference.

The 1917
Annual Report
of the State Horticultural Society
shows that field work is now being conducted at eleven different points
throughout the state. At Polar, Maple, Whitehall, Manitowoc,
Sparta, Baraboo, Holcombe, Pewaukee, Gays Mills, Lake Geneva,
and Weston experiments are under way. The supervision of trial
orchards at the stations constitutes the major part of the societyâs
activities, and absorbs the larger portion of its funds. The trial
orchard at Gays Mills is regarded as the best of its age in the state.

That the reading-circle movement has made great progress in
Wisconsin during the last two years is shown by the report issued

Pg 339

for 1917-1918, which reveals an increase of over 175 per cent in the
number of persons who are doing work under the auspices of this
organization. An increase of more than 300 per cent in the number
of boys and girls reading under the direction of the Young Peopleâs
Circles is reported. Upwards of 2,500 teachers and more than 24,000
pupils did the required reading in their respective circles during the
last school year. Fifty-four counties took part in the Young Peopleâs
Reading Circle, and fifty in the Teachersâ Circle. Of the cities that
have taken the lead in the number of members enrolled in the Young
Peopleâs Circle, Janesville heads the list with 507. Marinette County
leads in the number of seals and diplomas granted to teachers with
a total of 158.

That the town mutual fire insurance companies in Wisconsin
experienced their usual increase in business during the last year is
seen from their
Forty-eighth Annual Report
issued in 1917. The
insurance in force at the close of the business year in December, 1916,
was $28,943,362 more than at the close of the preceding year.
Practically the entire agricultural interests of the state are protected
by some one of these mutual companies. The prediction is made that
the territory will remain about the same in the future as at the present.
The only change in business to be looked for will be the gradual
increase in the value of rural property and improved conditions
making for increased insurance. Only one new company has entered
the field—the North Wisconsin Finnish Farmers of Marengo.

The December (1917) number of the
Wisconsin Library Bulletin

presents what is practically a first report of the work done in this
state in raising funds for camp libraries. Wisconsinâs contribution
to the million dollar fund was approximately $41,000. Since our
quota, according to the basis of population, was slightly over
$25,000, it will be seen that the state not only did her share but
greatly exceeded it.

The
Wisconsin State Board of Health Bulletin
for September,
1917, reports that during the preceding three months 6,230 deaths
occurred in the state. This corresponds to an annual death rate of
9.9 a thousand of the population. This record shows a decline of
422 in the total number of deaths when compared to the report for
the same three months in 1916. It is interesting to note that during
the three months covered by this report—July, August, and September—the
death rate in the northern part of the state was only 8.6
a thousand, in the central counties, 10 a thousand, and in the southern
counties, 10.4 a thousand.

The
Proceedings
of the Fifty-first Annual Encampment of the
Department of Wisconsin Grand Army of the Republic, 1917, shows
that at the beginning of the year there were only 4,247 surviving

Pg 340

members left. The highest membership ever reached by the Wisconsin
organization was in 1899 when there were 13,944 enrolled.
Death claimed 420 of the veterans during the year from December
31, 1915, to December 31, 1916.

The
Opinions of the Attorney-General of Wisconsin
issued for
October, 1917, shows that his advice was sought upon thirty-seven
different questions. The uncertainties attending the statutes relating
to the construction of bridges and highways brought forth the
largest number of inquiries. The duties of public officers, particularly
county officials, and the interpretation of the fish and game laws
also required a large number of opinions to be handed down at that
time of the year.

The
Consolidated Annual Reports
of the Wisconsin Dairymanâs
Association for the annual meetings of 1913, 1914, 1915, and 1916
was issued in July, 1917. The report shows that since the organization
of the association in 1872, the dairy products of the state have
increased from $1,000,000 to over $120,000,000. Wisconsin now
stands first among the states both in the value of dairy products and
in the number of dairy cows. In July, 1917, there were 81 cow-testing
associations. The total membership was 2,417, while the
number of cows under test exceeded 38,000. The average cow in
Wisconsin produces 175 pounds of fat a year, although there was
one herd reported where the average reached 564 pounds of fat.

Fuel Conservation by the Economical Combustion of Soft Coal

by Gustus Ludwig Larson is the title of Bulletin
No.
888 of the
University of Wisconsin issued in December, 1917. The author
declares that many plants waste through unscientific firing and inadequate
equipment as much as fifty per cent of the coal they buy. The
criminal waste in the burning of coal in which many firemen engage
is regarded as the most serious problem facing our people during
the winter season. The question of proper combustion, both in the
firing power plants and in domestic heating, and a discussion of
the different devices for burning soft coal without smoke are set
forth in a practical manner by Professor Larson. A table showing
the characteristic analyses of soft coal available to Wisconsin buyers
is included in the bulletin.

SOME PUBLICATIONS

Professor F. A. Ogg of the University of Wisconsin, and a member
of the State Historical Society, is the author of a new volume
entitled
National Progress, 1907 to 1917
. All students of American
history are familiar with the monumental coÃ¶perative history of our
country edited by Professor Hart of Harvard, entitled
The American
Nation
. This work in twenty-seven volumes was completed in 1907.

Pg 341

Professor Oggâs new book is designed to bring the work down to date
by covering the history of the nation for the decade ending with
1917.

The recent volume by Dr. Kellogg, Research Associate in the
State Historical Society, entitled
Early Narratives of the Northwest
1634-1699
, is reviewed in the
American Historical Review
in
part as follows:

âIf the early history of Wisconsin and neighboring regions is
not adequately accessible to future generations, it will be through
no fault of a group of zealous and competent students who, perhaps
inspired by the examples of Draper, the collector, and Thwaites, editor
and collector, continue the work in true historical spirit and scientific
method. If Wisconsin is fortunate in her students, she is also abundantly
rich in material for study. * * * For all of the journals
Miss Kelloggâs abundant annotation is helpful. We wish she had
added one more note, explaining Raddisonâs wonderful word

auxotacicae
(
p.
65). The clearly-penned introduction to each
narrative not merely summarizes it, but informs the student of what
printing it has already had, either in French or English, and makes
plain the editorâs choice of text. Not the least interesting feature of
the work is a facsimile of a contemporary map drawn to illustrate
Marquetteâs discoveries, here reproduced from the original in the
BibliothÃ¨que Nationale, Paris. A portion of Franquelinâs map of
1688 is also given. Few typographical slips are noted; even La Salle
(Cavelier), recorded in more than one work as 'Chevalier,â gets
through safely here, with but one transformation into 'Cavalierâ
(
p.
164).

âThe volume as a whole bespeaks scholarly care and regard for
the needs of a large class of students to whom rare volumes or obscure
texts may not be available; and admirably presents the essential
original material of the first half-century and more, from the first
known advent of the white man in the
pays dâen haut
.â

Wisconsinâs Social Democracy
is a forty-six page pamphlet by
Hon. Frederick W. von Cotzhausen, of Milwaukee, printed in advance
from a projected volume containing the authorâs âHistoric Reminiscences
and Reflections.â The pamphlet now issued consists of three
parts written respectively in 1906, 1914, and 1917, and aims at
âSketching a few Episodesâ in the history of Socialism in Wisconsin
âwhich may be of future historical interest and of which I
may speak from personal observation.â The tone and sentiments
of the author are strongly antisocialistic in character.

Henry Baird Favill, A.B., M.D., LL.D., 1860-1916
, is the
title of a memorial volume, privately printed, to this noted son of
Wisconsin. Wisconsin has produced many great physicians but

Pg 342

of them all none has achieved worthier fame than did Doctor Favill.
Born in Madison in 1860, the capital city continued to be his home
until 1894. He then removed to Chicago where in a few years he
gained recognition not only as one of the cityâs leading physicians
but also as one of the most industrious civic workers and useful
citizens. The memorial volume, compiled by his son, contains two
parts: one devoted to tributes and resolutions, the other to addresses
and papers by Doctor Favill. The wide range of topics covered by
the latter and the charm of style and breadth of vision manifested
in their treatment afford a glimpse, at least, of the intellectual and
human greatness of their author.

To the La Crosse
Tribune
for November 4, 1917, E. S. Hebberd
contributes a proposal that the one-hundredth anniversary of the
birth of Cadwalader C. Washburn, which occurs in 1918, be observed
in fitting manner. The Washburn family is remarkable for the ability
and the public careers of its members. All of the seven brothers
achieved distinction. Four were members of Congress, each representing
a different state. Two were governors of their respective
states, and two, including one of the congressmen, were ministers of
the United States to foreign countries. Wisconsin owes a debt of
gratitude to C. C. Washburn, and it would seem fitting that appropriate
recognition should be made of the centennial of his birth.

The Wisconsin Archeologist
for July, 1917, has as its leading
article a survey of Lake Shawano and the Wolf River, by George R.
Fox and H. O. Younger. As a water route the Wolf River was long
used by the American Trading Company in reaching its trading stations
in northern Wisconsin. The survey here presented constitutes
a valuable historical and archeological discussion of this region. The
October number is chiefly devoted to a survey of Chetek and Rice
lakes written by Charles E. Brown and Robert Becker.

Charles A. Eastmanâs
From the Deep Woods to Civilization
,
published by Little, Brown and Company, is a fascinating volume.
The author, a full-blooded Sioux, began life as a barbarian of the
plains, his family having fled to Canada after the Sioux outbreak
of 1862 in Minnesota. The present volume tells the story of his life
from the time when his father determined to dedicate him to a civilized
career. It is interesting to note that from an enthusiastic believer
in the superiority of civilized life as compared with savagery, the
author has come gradually to doubt the correctness of his earlier
view. Apparently the present world cataclysm, which has swept
many another thinker from his accustomed moorings, has had some
influence upon Mr. Eastmanâs views concerning the respective merits
of the civilized and the savage states. Wisconsin readers of the book
will take special interest in the chapter âCollege Life in the West,â

Pg 343

describing the authorâs experiences at Beloit College, to which place
the young neophyte in the arts of the paleface turned on leaving the
Santee Agency Mission School.

Methodist Heroes of Other Days
by Samuel Gardiner Ayer has
been issued by the Methodist Book Concern. It is a slight volume
containing some thirty-six short appreciative sketches of as many
âheroesâ of the Methodist Episcopal denomination. Wisconsin
readers will be particularly interested in the short account of âAlfred
Brunson, the Soldier Preacher,â one of the founders of the Methodist
Episcopal church in Wisconsin. Readers of the
Magazine
will be
interested still further, perhaps, to learn that a daughter of Reverend
Brunson is at the present time engaged in writing a biography of
her father for the State Historical Society.

The December, 1917, number of the
Mississippi Valley Historical
Review
maintains the high standard of excellence which readers have
been led, by the character of previous numbers, to expect in this
periodical. The three leading articles are: âHowell Cobb and the
Crisis of 1850,â by R. P. Brooks; âA Larger View of the Yellowstone
Expedition, 1819-1820,â by Cardinal Goodwin; and âThe
Beginnings of British West Florida,â by C. E. Carter. Dan E.
Clark contributes the annual review of historical activities in the
trans-Mississippi Northwest, and to complete the number are departments
devoted to âNotes and Documents,â âBook Reviews,â and
âNotes and Comments.â

Announcement has recently been made of the resignation of
Clarence W. Alvord as managing editor of the
Mississippi Valley
Historical Review
, in which capacity he has acted since the founding
of the magazine in 1914. The
Review
, largely because of the efforts
of Mr. Alvord, now ranks among the best of American historical
publications. Its readers will greatly regret Mr. Alvordâs resignation.

The leading article in the October, 1917, issue of the
Iowa
Journal of History and Politics
, describes the Iowa war loan of 1861.
By reason in part of a doubtful provision in the state constitution,
in part of the concerted efforts of the southern sympathizers living
in Iowa, the state administration encountered greater difficulty in
floating a war loan than was the case in any other northern state.
Through the columns of the distant
New York Herald
the enemies
of the loan conducted their campaign to defeat it. The manner in
which Governor Kirkwood and his assistants overbore the opposition
and saved the reputation of the state is vividly described.

The life of Samuel J. Kirkwood, Iowaâs war governor, by D. E.
Clark, has been issued as one of the Biographical Series of the Iowa
Historical Society. The study of Governor Kirkwoodâs life takes

Pg 344

the reader into the history of three commonwealths, but it is with
the development of Iowa that his name is inseparably associated.
As Civil War governor, United States senator, and secretary of the
interior under Garfield, his name is perhaps more widely known than
that of any other person in Iowa history. In preparing the
biography, Mr. Clark had access to seven
Civil War Letter Books
and
three letter books for the period when Kirkwood was secretary of
the interior. Use was also made of a large collection of letters, covering
the period from 1850-1890. From these sources the author has
given us a sketch of Iowaâs noted war governor which is both timely
and valuable.

In a two-volume work on
Burrows of Michigan and the Republican
Party
published by Longman, Green and Company, 1917,
William Dana Orcott has presented a detailed career of one of Michiganâs
most famous men. As lawyer, college professor, military hero,
and United States senator, Burrows gained an acquaintance that was
nation wide. In ability he ranked with Blaine, Garfield, Reed, and
McKinley; and had he not been so blindly devoted to the partisan
principles which he represented, in all probability he would have occupied
a higher office.

The
Michigan Historical Magazine
for October, 1917, contains
an interesting group of Civil War letters written by Hon. Washington
Gardiner while serving as a volunteer in 1863-64. The letters
were all written from the front, and depict the conditions observed
by this youthful soldier of sixteen years.

Those who enjoy reading a frontier narrative will welcome a
little volume recently published, entitled
A Soldier Doctor of our
Army: James P. Kimball
. The book was written by Maria B. Kimball,
wife of Dr. Kimball, and is published by the Houghton Mifflin
Company. Dr. Kimball served in the Civil War and later for a number
of years at Fort Buford and other places on the western frontier.
He was an intimate friend of General Custer, by whom he was chosen
to act as the chief medical officer on the campaign which ended in
Custerâs death in 1876. But for his inability to meet the appointment,
his career would doubtless have terminated at the same time
as Custerâs in the disaster which overwhelmed his army.

The Myth Wawataw
is the subject of a brief dissertation, beautifully
printed, by H. Bedford Jones of Santa Barbara, on the unreliability
of Alexander Henryâs account of the events in the
Northwest connected with Pontiacâs war. A brief discussion is also
included in the booklet on the historical remains at old Michilimackinac.

The October, 1917, number of the
Ohio Archeological Historical
Quarterly
has an article on Muskingum River pilots by Irven Travis

Pg 345

which many of our members would take pleasure in reading. The
palmy days of small river transportation have long since become
a part of history, and any information bearing upon the part they
played in our social and economic development is treasured by all
students of pioneer days.

Two articles comprise the contents of the
Indiana Magazine of
History
for September, 1917. The first, âLincoln in Indiana,â is
the first installment of an interesting and suggestive account of the
obscure period in the great Emancipatorâs life of which it treats.
The second article is the concluding section of a history of the origin
and rise of the Republican Party in Indiana from 1854 to 1860.

A history of
Western Influences on Political Parties to 1825
, by
Homer C. Hockett, formerly of the University of Wisconsin, is the
title of Ohio State University
Bulletin
,
vol.
22, number 3, issued
in 1917. Dr. Hockett sketches the growth of political parties in this
country from about the middle of the eighteenth century down to the
close of the first quarter of the nineteenth. Chief emphasis is placed
upon the new political issues that arose out of western conditions
during this period, and the manner in which they affected national
policies.

Among the important historical periodicals of the country is the

Catholic Historical Review
of Washington, now in its third year
of publication. Its sponsors are valiantly sounding a clarion call
to their fellow religionists to awake to the importance of their priceless
historical heritage, and to put the preservation and study of its
records on a thoroughly scholarly basis. That these matters have
been all too little attended to heretofore can hardly be gainsaid. If
the campaign waged by the
Catholic Historical Review
shall meet
with a reasonable measure of success, however, we may expect to
witness in the not distant future a radical change in the attitude and
actions of the adherents of Catholicism in America with respect to
the cultivation of their historical domain. For the most part the
writing of sectarian religious histories in the United States has
been (and now is) conducted on a regretably low plane of scholarship.
Historians of all the denominations (and, indeed, of whatever
other social groups) would do well to take to heart the principles
of scholarly procedure which the
Review
advocates.

The broadly objective viewpoint of this church organ may be
concretely illustrated by citing two or three items from a single issue
(that for October, 1917). It is argued that the records of the several
dioceses be administered on a scientific basis, and be âeasily accessible
to all qualified students whether Catholic or non-Catholic.â A generous
tribute is paid to the work of the several state historical societies
in conserving the Catholic history of the land, notwithstanding the

Pg 346

membership rolls of these societies contain âvery few Catholic names,
and very little Catholic generosity finds its way into their treasury.â
In passing it may be observed that our own Society may appropriate
to itself a fair portion of this tribute, for much has been done, from
its earliest days, to conserve the history of the oldest of Christian
denominations in Wisconsin. Again, a recently published meretricious
life of George Washington, written by a certain priest, meets
with castigation as thorough at the hands of the reviewer as any historical
periodical free from church connections could have administered.
The example of the
Review
may well be emulated by the
historians of all religious denominations.

The preliminary report of the California Historical Survey Commission,
issued in February, 1917, sets forth one of the most ambitious
undertakings in the field of local history that has ever been launched
in this country. An act passed by the legislature of that state in
June, 1915, provided for the appointment of a commission of three
members to make a survey of all local historical material in California.
An appropriation of ten thousand dollars was made to cover
the expense of the work. The work mapped out by the commission
in its preliminary report includes a careful survey of the several
county archives in the state, of the state archives, and of those of
the local federal offices. Reports are also being gathered from all
the public libraries, from the collections of historical societies and
other similar institutions. Manuscripts in the possession of private
individuals are being listed and the files of early newspapers, records
of the religious and social organizations and large business concerns
of the state are all being examined. Already archival records antedating
the organization of the state government have been found,
the existence of which had been hitherto unsuspected, while records
pertaining to land claims under the Spanish and Mexican governments
have been brought to light.

COLONEL ELMER E. ELLSWORTH: FIRST
HERO OF THE CIVIL WAR
[128]

Charles A. Ingraham

On Monday, the twenty-ninth of April, 1861, fourteen
days after President Lincolnâs call for 75,000 troops, a regiment
composed of 1,100 men, uniformed and equipped,
marched the streets of New York en route to the national
capital. Riding at the head of the column was the Colonel,
a young man of twenty-four, small of stature, with flashing
dark eyes and with a look of authority and power upon his
handsome features. The crowds along the line of march
cheered enthusiastically as the regiment passed—a magnificent
body of men who at his call had rushed in the space
of four days to the colors. It was Ellsworthâs regiment
of Zouaves, recruited from the firemen of New York City,
and afterwards mustered into the service as the Eleventh
New York Volunteer Infantry.

But whence came this wonderful youth who, as if by
magic, had called into being this stalwart array—bold and
fearless men, resenting restraint, but submitting cheerfully
now to his iron discipline? Not many years before, he had
been but an obscure country boy of northern New York,
remote from the places of advancement and culture, a son
of worthy parents, unable, however, to contribute of their
limited means to the furtherance of the ambitious desires of

Pg 350

their offspring. In the brief space of a year he had achieved
national prominence; having had up to the summer of 1860
but a local reputation, confined to Chicago and its vicinity,
he became the popular idol of the entire northern country.
At the head of his United States Zouave Cadets he had
toured the leading eastern cities and won distinction for the
extraordinary perfection of drill exhibited by his command.
Shining through all this historic expedition appears preÃ«minent
the attractive personality of the young captain—knightly,
magnetic, winning, lofty of character, able to control
every one of his cadets under the imperious rule of his native
authority and undeviating rectitude.

On the morning of the twenty-fourth of May, less than
a month from the departure of the Fire Zouaves from New
York, Ellsworth was killed at Alexandria. Not in vain was
his fall, for it caused the hesitating northern people to reach
firmly at last for the rifle. âEllsworthâs Avengers,â the Forty-fourth
New York Volunteer Infantry, recruited from every
county of the Empire State, with unusual physical requirements
and moral standards, marched from their encampment
at Albany for the front on October 21, 1861. Well did they
fulfill the name they bore, for on many a battle field this
somewhat Puritanical regiment, remarkable for the scholarship
and worth of its rank and file, never forgot the assassination
of Ellsworth as they carried their rent colors against
the foe. Still another regiment of New York City firemen,
the Second Fire Zouaves, or the Seventy-third New York
Volunteer Infantry, was recruited under the inspiration of
Ellsworthâs name and was mustered into the service on July
10, 1861. ReÃ«nlisting in 1864, it had a continuous service to
the close of the war and enjoys a magnificent history.

Thus Ellsworth had, to his immediate, demonstrable
credit, the mustering in of three regiments, which constituted,
however, but a small proportion of the multitude whose
patriotic devotion was evoked by his death and who followed

Pg 351

the flag into the service. Yet many believe him to have been
but a rash and adventurous person, vain and superficial. My
study of his life, however, convinces me of the error of such
opinion and that he was a young man of extraordinary gifts,
prudent thought, gentle, loving instincts, and one who had
been baptized with a fervent spirit of patriotism. Abraham
Lincoln recognized his wonderful abilities and admirable
traits of character and loved him for them, had his stricken,
cold body brought to the White House, and wept over his
remains as he would have grieved over those of his own son.
And John Hay, in two notable magazine articles, one written
soon after Ellsworthâs fall, the other towards the close of Mr.
Hayâs career, has nothing but eulogy for the noble youth
whom he had intimately known and loved as a brother.
Surely, young Ellsworth had in him the elements of greatness!
Schooled in poverty, disciplined by hardship and disappointment,
his life is yet a shining path of pure living, high
purpose, devoted patriotism, and worthy fame.

The motorist who seeks the birthplace of Ellsworth leaves
the city of Troy, crosses to the west side of the Hudson at the
northern limits of the town, and follows the macadam road
along the river northward fourteen miles to the city of
Mechanicsville. Here he will leave the river and proceeding
in a northwesterly direction over a fine state road will reach
at a distance of nine miles the little village of Malta, Saratoga
County, seven miles this side of the city of Saratoga Springs.
At Malta, Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth was born on April 11,
1837. The hamlet is much like thousands of others scattered
over our eastern states; it claims its four corners, church,
schoolhouse, and general store, but, with its spacious square,
shade trees, and pleasant dwellings, it is more attractive than
the average small village. The house in which Ellsworth
first saw the light is yet standing, a well preserved, small,
story-and-a-half structure, looking cheerfully out on the
great road where thousands pass, ignorant of the honor which

Pg 352

it possesses. It has been called âthe low-browed cottage,â
a characterization which is appropriate, for two small, oblong
windows are suggestive of eyes peering out from under the
eaves. Ephraim D. Ellsworth, Elmerâs father, a worthy
citizen and a tailor by trade, in 1836 married Phoebe Denton
who resided here, and employed himself at this place in the
business of his calling. He was of English extraction, born
in the town of Halfmoon, Saratoga County, New York,
and a man of bright intellect. His grandfather, George
Ellsworth, as a boy of fifteen joined the American army
operating against Burgoyne, fought in the battle of Saratoga,
and was present at the subsequent surrender of the
British army. George Ellsworth was thus a yet-living influence
to develop the patriotic and martial spirit of his great-grandson,
and, added to the special interest he took in the
exciting story of the boy-soldierâs adventures, was the realizing
assistance afforded by the proximity of the battle field,
nine miles away. Phoebe Denton could no more trace a
distinguished ancestry than could her husband, and all that
is available concerning her is that on her fatherâs side she
had an English lineage, and on her motherâs, a âScotch
Presbyterian.â

BIRTHPLACE OF ELMER E. ELLSWORTH, MALTA, NEW YORK

The boyhood life of Elmer in Malta was isolated enough
but was relieved somewhat by the nearness of Saratoga
Springs, which in those times was a leading watering-place
of the country, where the wealth and fashion of the land
disported itself. Many costly equipages every season would
pass through the village, bound to and from Saratoga, not a
few of them belonging to the southern aristocracy and having
ebony coachmen on the box. Only two miles east is the beautiful
Saratoga Lake, with the charms of which he was familiar.
He was a good student in the district school, but not at all
precocious or remarkable as a scholar. He was cheerful,
fond of and a leader in all games and sports, but his greatest
enjoyment was in reading; he would become lost for hours

Pg 353

in a book, heedless of the lapse of time. His mother was a
pious woman and from her and the services of the Presbyterian
church he derived deep religious convictions which
he maintained throughout his life. He became, also, at an
early age, a pronounced temperance disciple and, having
heard a lecturer say that the devil dwelt in a cider barrel,
wanted to take a âgun and cussion capâ and shoot him. His
mother has left on record many interesting instances of his
philosophical character and original sayings, but there is not
room here to give them place. I may, however, be permitted
to mention his purchase of his brother Charlie, the one other
child in the family. Charlie was three years younger than
Elmer, and the older brother conceiving a great fondness for
him while he was yet a babe, and desiring him for his own,
bought him of his parents for six shillings. From that time
forward Elmer assumed a sort of guardianship over him and
maintained that sense of obligation up to the day of Charlieâs
death. At an early age he began to evidence a proclivity for
military studies and employments by exhibiting a preference
for books dealing with war and battles; when but nine years
of age he drew with wagon-paints on one side of a window
shade a picture of General Washington and staff, and on the
reverse side one of General Jackson and staff. A natural
aptitude for sketching was further developed as he grew
older and was of practical help to him in his military occupations.
Many of his sketches are still preserved and cherished.
After he had spent a year as a clerk in the employ of a Mr.
DeGroff, who kept a general store at Malta, the family
moved to Mechanicsville.

The ambition which Elmer had cherished of entering
West Point Military Academy might have been realized had
there been at Mechanicsville educational advantages whereby
he could have gained the proper preparation, but the village,
then a place of about 800 inhabitants, had nothing higher
than district schools, and his father had not the means to send

Pg 354

him to an academy. He attended the school located on North
Main Street, a brick building still standing and converted
into an attractive residence. Mr. Ellsworthâs trade seems
not to have afforded him a sufficient income, for he adopted
various makeshifts in order to provide for his family, such as
peddling oysters, netting pigeons, and other like employments.
Elmer was sometimes sneered at by his companions
on account of his fatherâs poverty and one day he whipped
a boy soundly who had called him, âoyster-keg.â

All this made a deep wound in the proud and sensitive
heart of the boy, and throughout his career, in his letters and
diary, may still be read the ever-recurring refrain of his desire
to remove his parents from lives of grinding toil and carking
care. This absorbing thought had been observed by President
Lincoln and was mentioned in his letter to Colonel Ellsworthâs
bereaved parents as âconclusive of his good heart.â
But Elmer had the great privilege while living in Mechanicsville
of organizing and having under him a military company:
the Black Plumed Riflemen, of Stillwater, an historic village
three miles above Mechanicsville. At this time, although but
fifteen, short and slight of build, he would go through the
manual of arms with the heavy muskets of those days with
wonderful ease and rapidity. Throughout his life he was ever
of a strong, virile constitution; quick, active, alert, he became
in after years an accurate shot and a fine swordsman. Illustrative
of his strength and agility and as exhibiting his qualification
to lead others in performing startling feats, it is still
told in Mechanicsville that one day a clerk in Hatfieldâs store
(now the Mead Building) having heard a commotion in the
second story, upon investigation, found that Ellsworth and
the Black Plumed Riflemen had ascended there on a âhuman
ladderâ; the last ones were pulled up through the doorway
from the sidewalk. Though Mechanicsville has grown to be
a place of more than 8,000 population, the older parts of the
town remain very much as when Ellsworth paraded the streets

Pg 355

with his riflemen. The old home, a pleasant dwelling on
Ellsworth Street in the southern part of the place, still stands
amid surroundings practically unchanged. The premises
front on the embankment of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad;
in the rear flows the now abandoned section of the
Champlain Canal. Just south of the home and on the rise
of ground is the residence of Robert Sears, deceased, who
was an intimate friend of the family and who accompanied
the stricken parents to New York to meet the remains of
their son. Elmer was a welcome visitor here, where he and
his companion, Charles Sears, had many a happy romp in
the fields about the homestead. It is needless to say that
the remembrance of Colonel Ellsworth is still a sacred one
in the Sears family and that his memorials are cherished in
the white mansion on the hill where he was gladly entertained
and duly appreciated; for even at this early age it was evident
that he was a lad of superior parts. Certain of the citizens
have suggested changing the name of the place to âEllsworthâ
and erecting a fitting monument in the midst of the
city, a commendable proposal, though there are already nine
villages named Ellsworth in as many states of the country,
and notwithstanding that a noble granite memorial to his
memory, unveiled with elaborate and impressive ceremonies
on May 27, 1874, stands in the Mechanicsville cemetery.

Elmerâs stay in Mechanicsville did not embrace above a
year or more, and after having had considerable success in
selling papers on the railway trains, he secured the consent
of his father to leave home and try to make his own way
in the world. He, therefore, in 1852, secured employment
as a clerk in the store of Corliss & House, Troy, dealers in
linen goods, where he remained about a year. The career of
Ellsworth from now on to 1858 is difficult to follow in detail
on account of the as yet scarcity of data from which to construct
a satisfactory narrative. It is known, however, that
from the time he left Mechanicsville to the hour of his death,

Pg 356

his life, though in its last two years astonishingly prominent
and in point of honorable fame highly successful, was
throughout an experience of almost unremitting hardship
and poverty; a beating about from one employment to
another; a weary history of uncongenial labor and foiled
ambition. It is probable that he was, to use his own words,
endeavoring to âmake a bold push for fortune,â that he might
quickly relieve his parents of that toil and privation, the
remembrance of which seems to have burned into his soul to
remain smarting there through the long years. Perhaps it
would be charity to allow the mantle of forgetfulness to remain
upon this period of unrequited effort, though from the
glimpses we have in it of Ellsworth he is smiling and cheerful
through it all, ever maintaining the most scrupulous honor and
unblemished character. But the American people will desire
the uncovering of every detail of the life of this remarkable
young genius and martyr, whose very gifts of mind and heart,
like those of many another, made him the prey of fortune.

On August 2, 1917, there appeared in the
Telegraph-Courier

of Kenosha, Wisconsin, a letter from Charles H.
Goffe, a former resident of the city, and among his reminiscences
of Kenosha is the following concerning Ellsworth in
the summer of 1853, Elmer being then sixteen years old. I
have nothing with which to corroborate Mr. Goffeâs statement,
but as it has the impress of truth and corresponds,
though in an exaggerated manner, with what I have learned
of Ellsworthâs traits of character, I am disposed to give it
acceptance. It is my opinion that, having saved a sum of
money from his salary as a clerk in Troy, he resolved to âplod
alongâ no further but to âmake a bold push for fortuneâ
in the West, and endeavor to find by prospecting a more
promising field. Mr. Goffe writes:

âThere was also boarding at Mrs. Bellâs at this time, a
young man of handsome features and fastidious ways, accentuated
by a repelling hauteur and exclusiveness, so often

Pg 357

found peculiar to genius. His associates were few and his
disposition was not calculated to make intimates of those he
came in contact with. No one seemed able to penetrate the
mystery of his personality and yet there was something about
the youth which arrested the attention of all. But he was
obsessed with a penchant or habit born perhaps of idle vanity
of writing (or scribbling) his name in a bold, flowing, and not
ungraceful hand, upon every scrap of paper, on the weatherboards
of the house, and on gate and fence posts, a name
which a few years later was on every tongue, flashed in the
headlines of the daily press, and stamped in deathless lines
upon the history of his country—the name of Elmer E. Ellsworthâ¦.
In the fall of 1853, when the Kenosha High
School opened for the winter term under Professor DeWolff,
Mr. Ellsworth attended for a while, but was not satisfied
with school life, and suddenly dropped out of view and was
for a time forgotten.â

Mr. Goffe says that when, two years later, he went to
Muskegon, across the lake in Michigan, he learned that Ellsworth
had associated with and been adopted by the Ottawa
Indians who dwelt in those parts. After describing how he
had been created a chief among them, made the recipient of
high honors, and adorned with unique and gaudy apparel.
Mr. Goffe continues:

âBut, alas, when the novelty of barbaric glory and display
had become stale, and the craving for other conquests
and other scenes, and perhaps dreams of awaiting glories
had disturbed his vision, this eccentric child of genius suddenly
disappeared from his tribe and had gone no one could
tell where. His people waited long, but he returned no more,
and the red-skinned maidens of the tamarack swamps waited
and sighed in vain for the handsome young chief on whom
they had doted, and for whom they had hoped and dreamed.
And the seasons came and passed, and the moons had filled

Pg 358

their horns many times only to wane and the white chief
came no more.â

As stated before, it is probable that Ellsworth visited
Kenosha and it is likely, too, that on his way home he stopped
at Muskegon and was with the Indians for a brief period,
but that he remained there a year or more, as Mr. Goffe
was told, or that he made any extended stay among the Redskins
is highly improbable, though I realize that in expressing
this opinion I am throwing ashes on what purports to be a
romantic episode.

Returning to Mechanicsville and casting about for employment,
Ellsworth recalled that in one of his trips between
Troy and his home he had met on the train a gentleman from
New York who, evidently attracted by his intelligent and
prepossessing appearance, drew him into conversation and
impressed himself favorably on the youthâs mind and memory.
Thinking that this transient friend might help him, he
inserted a âpersonalâ in the New York
Herald
which in due
time brought a letter from the gentleman, who proved to
be a drygoods merchant, and after a preparatory correspondence
Ellsworth was made a clerk in his store. This was
in 1853, the year of his visit to the West and Kenosha.

Concerning the two years that he spent in New York
I have been able to secure but fragmentary and disconnected
data. He remained but half of this period in the employ of
the merchant referred to and when, in 1855, he went to Chicago,
he did so in company with a party of engineers by
whom he had been employed in improving the channel at
Hellgate, not far from New York. This work was carried
on by the aid of divers who deposited the explosive on the
surface of the rock and this being fired by electricity and
confined somewhat by the weight of water effected considerable
execution. Just what part Ellsworth played in
this work or how long he was engaged in it is not known.
While in New York he was afforded an opportunity of

Pg 359

acquiring a better knowledge of military tactics through the
drills of the Seventh Regiment, which he attended on every
available occasion.

He was eighteen years of age when, with his brother, he
went to Chicago, hoping to make better progress in providing
means for the ease, security, and happiness of their
parents. For, while yet a little boy in Malta, having been
pained by the cruel words of a companion who had sneeringly
remarked that his mother wore âpatched shoes,â he had told
her that he would some day earn a lot of money so that she
would be a lady as well as the best and âride in a carriage.â
This ambition for his mother, that she might âride in a carriage,â
was referred to hopefully in a letter dated Madison,
Wisconsin, November 15, 1858. Though his brother, after
remaining but a brief season in Chicago, seems to have given
up the battle and returned home, Elmer held on and through
the most discouraging experiences persevered and at last
achieved a success which repaid him for all his suffering and
humiliation.

Not long after his arrival in Chicago he engaged himself
as a clerk to Arthur F. Devereux, of Salem, Massachusetts,
who was in the patent soliciting business and who later became
an officer in the Eighth Massachusetts Regiment. Ellsworth
after a time became a partner with Mr. Devereux and
the firm enjoyed prosperity when, through the defalcation
of one whom they trusted, everything was lost and Elmer
found himself without a dollar struggling again for the bare
necessities of life. Three years had been passed in this business,
as appears from Ellsworthâs own words. He writes:
âIn an evil hour I placed confidence in an infernal scoundrel,
was robbed of everything in a moment, saw the reward of
three yearsâ toil fade from my eyes when about to grasp it.â

The occurrence of this catastrophe brings Ellsworthâs
career down to 1858, he then being of the age of twenty-one.
Connected with the business of a patent solicitor are certain

Pg 360

legal aspects that require attention, and having in this way
in a manner been introduced to the law, he determined to
prepare himself for the full practice of that profession. He
therefore entered the law office of Mr. J. E. Cone as a student.
The remuneration he received for copying legal papers was
wholly inadequate; for a time he slept on the floor of the office,
and suffered, not infrequently, the pangs of hunger. During
these months of hard study, drudgery of copying, and abject
poverty, he retained his interest in military affairs, though
he had no active part in them for the reason that he could
not afford the expense of belonging to a company. However,
he joined a gymnasium and made the acquaintance of
Dr. Charles A. DeVilliers, who was an instructor in fencing,
evidently in that institution. Dr. DeVilliers was destined
to play an important part in the military education and career
of Ellsworth, for he revived in him his ardent martial spirit
and encouraged him in his desire to acquire an intimate
knowledge of the French Zouave system of tactics and uniform
with a view to introducing them into this country.
DeVilliers was competent for this purpose, having served
with a French Zouave regiment in the Crimean War and was
familiar with all the details of their drill and equipment. The
name and system were derived by the French in 1830 from
the members of a mountain tribe of Algeria, (Arab., ZwawÃ¡)
who, arrayed in oriental costume, wide trousers, fez, and loose
jacket, were in their rapidity of movement and ferocity of
courage famed as fighters. Ellsworth, of a romantic nature
and a lover of the novel and dramatic, was attracted by this
now famous and spectacular system, and sent to France for
books fully explaining it and set himself to acquire the
language that he might read them. In the meantime, with
Scottâs and Hardeeâs books of tactics open before him, he
perfected himself in the manual of arms, not hesitating to
introduce improvements of his own where they seemed desirable,
his endeavor being to bring ease, grace, and celerity into

Pg 361

every movement. Under DeVillierâs instruction he became
the best fencer in Chicago, while his âlightning drillâ attracted
attention as he exhibited it in the gymnasium.

His reputation having reached as far as Rockford, Illinois,
he was engaged in the summer of 1858 to drill the Rockford
City Grays, a company that had been organized two
years earlier. The corps made good progress and in September
went into camp on the fairgrounds, remaining four days,
during which time military companies from Elgin, Freeport,
and Chicago visited the encampment. During his stay at
Rockford Ellsworth made the acquaintance of Miss Carrie
Spafford, to whom he became engaged, and for whom to
the day of his death he cherished the highest regard and the
deepest affection. Her father, Mr. Charles H. Spafford,
was one of the pioneers and a leading citizen of the place
and with his family was attached to Ellsworth and befriended
him more, perhaps, than any others outside of his immediate
relatives. In his last letter to Miss Spafford he refers to her
parents as âfather and mother.â Mrs. Charles H. Godfrey,
a sister of Miss Spafford, still resides at Rockford and occupies
the dwelling where Colonel Ellsworth visited the
family in 1858, and though she has no remembrance of him
she cherishes the honor that her Christian name, Eugenia,
was by him proposed for her to the family when he fondled
her on his knee. Miss Carrie Spafford married Charles S.
Brett, both of whom with their only son are deceased, Mrs.
Brett having died in 1911 at the old home where the Colonel
visited her. Not only did Ellsworth win the friendship and
regard of the Spafford family, but his cordial manners and
magnetic personality made him a marked individuality and
a popular hero throughout the town.

In the following month of October Ellsworth went to
Madison, Wisconsin, and was employed there in drilling the
Governorâs Guard, a military company organized in February
of that year and made up of the leading young

Pg 362

men of the place. It is on record that on October 15,
1858, he was elected commandant of the Guard and began
drilling the company, which at the beginning numbered
twenty-five men, three evenings in each week. There is nothing
to indicate how long he remained at Madison, though a
letter to his mother, already referred to, bears date, âCapitol
House, Madison,
Wis.
, Nov. 15th, 1858,â and it is probable
that he was with the Governorâs Guard in its parade of
December 26 following, concerning which a Madison newspaper
says, âThey appear much improved in a military
point.â The State Historical Society of Wisconsin has in
its archives several interesting memorials of Ellsworthâs
sojourn in Madison. There is some evidence that he drilled
a company in Springfield, Illinois, at about this period, but
the statements are so indefinite and inconclusive that I have
refrained from giving them as facts. In a study of this kind
it is necessary carefully to compare, weigh, and sift all the
materials of information.

A definite landmark in the life of Ellsworth is his diary,
commenced on his twenty-second birthday, April 11, 1859,
and continued for a brief period.
[129]
This was in the spring
following his agreeable and successful military employment
at Rockford and Madison, but from which he seems to have
derived no considerable emolument, for the entries in his diary
relate experiences of his struggle with poverty. Concerning
the purpose of the journal, he says: âI do this because
it seems pleasant to be able to look back upon our past lives
and note the gradual change in our sentiments and views
of life; and because my life has been and bids fair to be such

Pg 363

a jumble of strange incidents that, should I become anybody
or anything, this will be useful as a means of showing
how much suffering and temptation a man may undergo and
still keep clear of despair and vice.â These pages afford an
intimate view of his character and one which can be obtained
from no other source; for they are even more personal and
confidential than his letters to the members of his own family.
They tell in easy, fluent style of his poverty, temptations,
dawning success, meditations, and laborious study of the law
in the office of Mr. Cone, to which he had returned after his
engagement had expired in Madison.

Among the earlier entries in the diary is the account of his
election on April 29, 1859, as commandant of the United
States Zouave Cadets, of Chicago, a company superseding
the National Guard Cadets, instituted three years previous,
which company had become practically defunct. On abandoning
the old name and armory the Zouaves made their quarters
in the Garrett Block on ground now occupied by Central
Music Hall. The drill and discipline of the corps grew to
be more exacting and severe probably, than that to which
any military company was ever subjected, for Ellsworthâs
aim was to improve the men âmorally as well as physicallyâ
and âto place the company in a position second to none in
the United States.â The rules adopted and rigidly enforced
proscribed drinking or even entering, without a valid excuse,
a barroom, forbade visiting houses of vulgar resort, and
gambling rooms, and prohibited the playing of billiards in
public places. Ellsworth, himself, all his life was very
abstemious; in a letter to his brother in 1858, he writes: âI
donât use tobacco in any shape whatever; I drink neither tea
or coffee.â Running all through his career is the unmistakable
evidence, especially visible in his private papers, that he
was above all a moral champion: that his ethical principles
overshadowed and governed his military ambitions. The
proficiency of a cadet was no recommendation to his leniency:

Pg 364

if he transgressed the rules, he must go: twelve of his best
drilled men were expelled at one time for drinking; but such
was his influence over his command that as they dwindled
away there was never a stampede, even under the laborious
drills and the prohibitory discipline.

On the Fourth of July Ellsworth, having had the cadets
in training but little more than two months, gave a public
drill in front of the Tremont House and at once won the
admiration of hostile critics, who pronounced the exhibition
unrivaled outside West Point. This success was all the more
remarkable when it is considered that Ellsworth had acquired
his military knowledge entirely from self-instruction, never
having been a member of a company when he began the occupation
of drillmaster. Moreover, he was still very poor,
subsisting part of the time on nothing better than crackers;
but he could write proudly in his diary on the night of the
Fourth: âVictory, and thank God!â

At Chicago on September 15 of the same year, at the
seventh annual fair of the National Agricultural Society,
Ellsworth with his Zouaves won a stand of colors valued at
$500, which had been offered as a prize in a competitive drill.
Owing to the fact that only one other company drilled for
the award, though the contest had been open to any militia
company in the country, great dissatisfaction prevailed
throughout the East and South that the Zouaves should under
the circumstances be accorded such a distinction. The old
military companies of the eastern cities scorned the pretentions
of the âprairie boys,â and ridiculed the idea of their
being able to compete successfully with themselves. For
Ellsworth had added fuel to the fire by challenging any
company in the United States or Canada to drill for the
champion colors, offering to pay their expenses to and from
Chicago and stating that, starting on the following twentieth
of June, the Zouaves would visit the leading cities of the

Pg 365

country for the purpose of meeting those companies which
had not found it convenient to come to Chicago.

The discipline and drill, beginning early in February,
became more exacting than ever, as it was felt by the company
that in order to retain the colors the orders of the commandant
must be scrupulously observed. Ellsworth told them that
âeverything except business and the company must be sacrificedâ
and that till the date set for the departure, drills must
be held every evening, except Sunday, from seven to eleven
oâclock. Associated with the drill, which was practiced with
knapsacks weighing twenty-three pounds, were strenuous
athletic exercises, while through the month of June the men
slept on the floor of the armory wrapped in their blankets.
The start was postponed from June 20 to July 2, owing to
the death from smallpox of Ellsworthâs brother, who was a
member of the company. This bereavement was a hard stroke
for the commandant, who was already burdened with the care
and discipline of the company and anxiety for the results.
It was estimated that five weeks would be consumed in the
tour and that the expenditures would approximate $7,000,
but the funds were far from being raised when the day of
departure arrived. Moreover, the companyâs goods and
chattels were attached by certain ex-members who had loaned
it money and who were now smarting from the effects of
Ellsworthâs severe discipline; but this difficulty was quickly
relieved by the generosity of Chicago citizens.

The last reunion of Ellsworthâs Chicago Zouaves was held
at the Wellington Hotel, Chicago, in November, 1910, at
which eight members were present; five absentees were known
to be living at that time. I have recently corresponded with
Mr. J. M. DeWitt of New York, who is actively engaged
in practical affairs, with Mr. Frank E. Yates of Chicago,
and, through his family, with Mr. J. A. Clybourn, of the
same city, who is in very poor health. This band of men,
sifted out by Ellsworth and tried by the fire of his rigorous

Pg 366

discipline and training, not only achieved the reputation of
being perhaps the most perfectly drilled military company
in history, but held important places in the army during the
Civil War and multiplied the instructions and principles
which they had derived from their commandant.

The Chicago Historical Society has in its Ellsworth collection
a crayon sketch drawn by him and evidently designed
to serve as copy for the printer in preparing memorials of
the tour, to be presented to the members of the company.
Upon it are inscribed in consecutive order the names of the
cities visited and the military organizations by whom the
Zouaves were escorted and entertained, though the dates do
not appear in all cases. The itinerary follows:

Chicago, July 2, 1860; Adrian, Mich., July 3 and 4;
Detroit, July 5; Cleveland, July 6 and 7; Niagara Falls,
Sunday; Rochester, July —; Syracuse, July —; Utica, July
—; Troy, July 12; Albany, July 13; New York, July 14,
15, 16, --, 18, 19, 20; Boston, July 21, 22, 23, 25; Charlestown,
Mass., July 24; Salem, July —; West Point, July 26,
27; Philadelphia, July 28; Baltimore, Aug. —; Washington,
D. C., Mount Vernon, Aug. —; Pittsburgh, Aug. —;
Cincinnati, Aug. —;
St.
Louis, Aug. —; Springfield, Aug.
—; Chicago, Aug. 15.

The Zouaves were accompanied throughout their tour by
a band of eighteen pieces, the Light Guard Band of Chicago;
but though the company went forth with fine melody and
unique and brilliant uniforms, they were hardy soldiers with
bronzed faces and wiry, agile frames, who lived abstemiously
and slept each night on the floor of their quarters. Temptations
to indulge in wines and liquors were before them daily,
but they resolutely turned away to take up the arduous work
of their program. They were very young and somewhat
undersized; by no means a stalwart array, as might be expected;
but the wonderful precision, celerity, and grace of
their drill and evolutions astonished and thrilled every town

Pg 367

they visited, and the accounts of their marvelous proficiency,
telegraphed ahead, aroused widespread curiosity and brought
great crowds to observe them wherever they went. Though
the tour was made for the purpose of inviting competition,
not a company ventured to face them, all cheerfully according
them the palm of superiority.

The period in which the tour was made could not have
been more opportune; a critical presidential election was on,
with Abraham Lincoln heading the Republican party which
stood for the nonextension of slavery, and with the avowal
rife in the South that, should he be elected, war would ensue.
Thus, the people were disposed to look with interest and
enthusiasm upon military demonstrations. Ellsworthâs experience
was not, however, entirely without anxiety, owing
to the lack of funds, which, until New York City was reached,
was a source of worry; but at this point and in Boston large
amounts were derived from exhibition drills given before immense
audiences, and henceforward no difficulty was experienced
on this score. The company reached Chicago on
Tuesday, August 15, was accorded an ovation irrespective of
party affiliations, and escorted to the accompaniment of pyrotechnics
and a torch-light procession, to the âWigwamâ where
Lincoln had been nominated, which was filled with more than
10,000 people. Mayor Wentworth gave a congratulatory
address which was briefly responded to by Captain Ellsworth,
after which, it now being midnight, the company was banqueted
at the Briggs House.

Not long after this triumphant return Ellsworth resigned
his commission and the company disbanded. Its career having
been brilliant, though brief, it was better, it seemed to
him, that the organization should dissolve rather than deteriorate
under less rigorous discipline. Ellsworth, without
delay, seeming to realize that armed strife was at hand,
organized a regiment of Zouaves in northern Illinois, officered
it with men from his old company, and presented the force

Pg 368

to Governor Yates to direct as he might deem expedient.
Having become acquainted with Mr. Lincoln, he now entered
his law office, not so much to pursue his somewhat neglected
law studies as to promote a scheme which he was evolving
of reorganizing the militia of Illinois and eventually of the
whole country: to unify and bring the entire system more
completely under the control of a central authority. Here
begins to be manifest a wide grasp and a broad vision for
which Ellsworth has never been given credit. To enjoy a
reputation as a successful drillmaster and to control efficiently
a company of fifty men was but the rudiment of his ambition
and capacity; his mind went out firmly and sanely to
broad fields, and he impressed his ideas upon Mr. Lincoln,
who sought to give him an opportunity at the national capital
to work out and put in operation these desirable measures.
A start was attempted in a bill dictated by Ellsworth and
introduced in the Illinois legislature while he was in Springfield,
but though it was successful in the House, it failed in
the Senate through causes other than a lack of merit.

During the autumn, Ellsworth employed himself on the
stump, speaking for the Republican candidates, and exhibited
decided gifts as an orator; a fine voice and presence,
abundant humor and fluent expression gained him a ready
hearing. In the meantime he had resumed his legal studies
and later, passing a satisfactory examination, was admitted
to the bar a few weeks before Mr. Lincoln started on his
journey to Washington. The president-elect had invited
Ellsworth to accompany him on the trip in the capacity of
an officer to safeguard him by superintending the disposition
of the crowds that everywhere met him. Arriving at
the capital he was incapacitated with the measles, but when,
on his twenty-fourth birthday, April 11, 1861, Fort Sumter
was summoned to surrender, he soon shook off the lethargy
of his convalescence, resigned his lieutenantâs commission,
borrowed what money John Hay had at his disposal, and

Pg 369

started for New York, resolved to raise a regiment for the
service. In this he was promptly successful among the firemen
of the city and in a remarkably brief space, at the head
of the Eleventh New York Volunteer Infantry, was on May
7 mustered into the service in front of the Capitol at Washington
and in the presence of President Lincoln. For a few
days the regiment was quartered in the Capitol building, but
as the command was acquiring a tendency to disregard the
proprieties of the service, Colonel Ellsworth secured for it
a camp on the south side of the east branch of the Potomac,
on the high ground in the vicinity of the Insane Asylum,
believing that here he would have the men under better control.
An interesting, and to the Fire Zouaves a complimentary,
event occurred while the regiment was in Washington.
Willardâs Hotel having taken fire, Ellsworth and
his men after vigorous efforts quenched the flames and saved
the building, much to the gratification of Mr. Willard, who
entertained them at breakfast and gave Colonel Ellsworth
a purse of $500 to employ for the benefit of the regiment.
This money the Colonel turned over to the committee that
organized and equipped the Fire Zouaves, and it was eventually
divided equally and applied toward the erection of monuments
for Ellsworth and his successor, Colonel Farnham,
who died of wounds sustained at the first battle of Bull Run.

On the evening of Thursday, May 23, the regiment was
ordered to be ready to move at a momentâs notice, and at
2 oâclock
A. M.
of the twenty-fourth marched from its camp
and boarded the steamers
James Guy
and
Mount Vernon
.
In the bustle and stress incident to the departure, the busy
Colonel found time to write two remarkable letters: one to
his parents, the other to Miss Spafford, his fiancÃ©e. They
breathe a presentiment of death and were found (at least the
former, and I think the latter) upon his body. The letter
addressed to Miss Spafford has not appeared before in print
and has been read by but a limited number of persons. Colonel

Pg 370

Ellsworthâs last act before leaving his tent was to look
at her portrait and place it in his bosom.
[130]

My dear Father and Mother: The Regiment is ordered to move across
the river tonight. We have no means of knowing what reception we are
to meet with. I am inclined to the opinion that our entrance to the City
of Alexandria will be hotly contested, as I am just informed that a large
force have arrived there today. Should this happen, my dear parents,
it may be my lot to be injured in some manner. Whatever may happen,
cherish the consolation that I was engaged in the performance of a sacred
duty; and tonight, thinking over the probabilities of tomorrow, and the
occurrences of the past, I am perfectly content to accept whatever my
fortune may be, confident that He who noteth even the fall of a sparrow
will have some purpose even in the fate of one like me.

My darling and ever-loved parents, good-bye. God bless, protect
and care for you.
Elmer.

*  *  *  *  *

My own darling Kitty. My Regiment is ordered to cross the river
& move on Alexandria within six hours. We may meet with a warm
reception & my darling among so many careless fellows one is somewhat
likely to be hit.

If anything
should
happen—Darling just accept this assurance, the
only thing I can leave you—The highest happiness I looked for on earth
was a union with you—You have more than realised the hopes I formed
regarding your advancement—And I believe I love you with all the ardor
I am capable of—You know my darling any attempt of mine to convey
an adequate expression of my feelings must be simply futile—God bless
you, as you deserve and grant you a happy & usefull life & us a union
hereafter. Truly your own,
Elmer
.

P. S.

Give my love to mother & father (such they truly were to me) and
thank them again for all their kindness to me—I regret I can make no
better return for it—Again Good bye. God bless you my own darling.

Elmer.

COLONEL ELLSWORTHâS LAST LETTER

Reproduced by courtesy of Mrs. Charles H. Godfrey, Rockford, Illinois

It was a beautiful moonlight night and the bayonets of
the troops could be seen glittering as they crossed the Long
and Georgetown bridges for the invasion of Virginia. The

Pg 371

regiment arrived at Alexandria, seven miles below, at sunrise,
disembarked unopposed, formed near the wharf, and Colonel
Ellsworth with a squad of men from Company âAâ started
at âdouble quickâ into the city, intending to seize the telegraph
office and dispatches. Observing the Confederate flag
flying from the roof of the Marshall House, he sent a sergeant
with an order for Company âAâ to come up at once. It was
evidently his purpose to detail the company to remove the
flag, for he then passed on; but, as if reconsidering, turned
and entered the hotel. It should be stated here that the regiment
had come to Alexandria under embarrassing circumstances;
for not only had certain of the citizens expressed a
desire that they should not be sent to the town, but General
Mansfield, commanding at Washington, had threatened to
muster them out of the service should they not conduct themselves
in an orderly manner. This partially explains Colonel
Ellsworthâs desire to obtain the flag without delay, fearing
that it might enrage the men and lead to acts of vandalism.
On the other hand, it is affirmed that before he left New York
with his regiment, he remarked that âhe would bring to the
city the first secession flag he might encounter,â and that âhe
would not order any of his men to go where he would not
go himself.â Just what was in the young colonelâs mind will
never be known; probably a variety of motives impelled him
to the act. He knew that the city of Washington would be
looking for the lowering of the âbastard flag,â which for days
had been flaunted as an insult and challenge to the capital
city. President Lincoln at that very moment might be looking
anxiously from the windows of the White House for its
disappearance!

The Marshall House is an old landmark of Alexandria,
constructed of brick and three stories high; it was famous as
having entertained Washington. The flag was flying from
a staff about twenty-five feet in length, attached to the frame
of a rear dormer window, and was reached by ascending to

Pg 372

the attic by a stairway which had a landing and turn at the
middle. Colonel Ellsworth and his party, having left guards
at proper intervals, secured the flag, and were coming down
from the attic, when Corporal Francis E. Brownell, who
was ahead, observed a man with a gun, who proved to be
James W. Jackson, proprietor of the house, standing at the
foot of the stairs. He immediately sprang below, and struck
down the weapon but before he could prevent him Jackson
raised his gun, a double-barrel shotgun, and fired at Colonel
Ellsworth, who had come onto the middle landing and taken
a step or two down, the charge entering his left breast. The
Colonel cried âMy God!â and plunged headlong to the floor
below, uttering soon after but a low moan. He fell near the
room that had been occupied by Washington, and the medal
he wore, inscribed, âNon nobis, sed pro patria,â was wet with
his blood. Brownell with great coolness and rapidity of action
took aim and firing struck Jackson in the middle of the face
and as he reeled to fall plunged his sword bayonet through
him, the assassinâs second shot flying harmlessly over Brownellâs
head. A scene of confusion followed the double tragedy,
heart-rending cries of agony, as Jacksonâs wife bewailed her
loss, resounded through the hotel, while the Zouaves, fearing
that they were trapped in a nest of secessionists, posted
themselves so as to command the corridors and ordered all
guests into their rooms on peril of being shot down. Company
âAâ soon arrived on the ground, however, and on a
litter improvised out of muskets, the body of Ellsworth was
borne to the river, placed on the
James Guy
, and conveyed
immediately to Washington.

Among the many tributes that were published in honor
of Ellsworth, none were comparable to the beautiful words
sent by President Lincoln to his parents. He wrote:
[131]

Pg 373

âIn the untimely loss of your noble son, our affliction here is scarcely
less than your own. So much of promised usefulness to oneâs country,
and of bright hopes for oneâs self and friends, have rarely been so
suddenly darkened as in his fall. In size, in years, and in youthful appearance,
a boy only, his power to command men, was surpassingly great.
This power, combined with a fine intellect, and indomitable energy, and
a taste altogether military, constituted in him, as seemed to me, the best
natural talent, in that department, I ever knew. And yet he was singularly
modest and deferential in social intercourse. My acquaintance with
him began less than two years ago; yet through the latter half of the
intervening period, it was as intimate as the disparity of our ages, and
my engrossing engagements, would permit. To me, he appeared to
have no indulgences or pastimes; and I never heard him utter a profane
or an intemperate word. What was conclusive of his good heart, he
never forgot his parents. The honors he labored for so laudably, and,
in the sad end, so gallantly gave his life, he meant for them, no less
than for himself.

âIn the hope that it may be no intrusion upon the sacredness of your
sorrow, I have ventured to address you this tribute to the memory of my
young friend, and your brave and early fallen child.

âMay God give you the consolation which is beyond all earthly power.

âSincerely your friend in common affliction.

A. Lincoln
.â

Importunate words throng me for expression, but they
cannot be accommodated further; the rage and grief of the
Fire Zouaves and their hardly-prevented purpose of burning
the city of Alexandria; the universal sorrow and demonstrations
of grief all along the funeral route from Washington
to Mechanicsville. I would like to tell of my acquaintance
with and reminiscences of Ellsworthâs parents, of how the
government provided liberally for them, of how their son
Elmer fulfilled in death the desire that he had been unable to
accomplish in life: that his mother might âride in a carriage.â

The fame of Ellsworth is destined to live on and to
increase, for he individualized those elements of character
which are loved and admired by the race universally. There
was a deep well of patriotism in his romantic, generous nature,
informed and directed by a keen and comprehensive intellect.

Pg 374

Though his life is almost like a fairy tale, it is steadied and
rationalized by deep thoughtfulness, filial affection, and unaffected
piety. The far generations will linger reverently
over that final word of love to his parents and will shed a
tear as they read of his last look at the portrait of the bride
of his heart and of his going out to die. Ellsworth will yet
come to his own and be appreciated and valued and loved
for what he was: one of the noblest, purest, and ablest patriots
who ever died for his country.

This article, which is intended to serve as an introduction to a biography
of Colonel Ellsworth which I hope to bring out, comprises but a fraction of the
data bearing upon his life and times which I have in my possession. To those
who have afforded me assistance in the collection of this material I am deeply
grateful; in particular I desire to express my indebtedness to the following persons:
Milo M. Quaife, superintendent, State Historical Society of Wisconsin,
Madison; Caroline M. McIlvaine, librarian, Chicago Historical Society; Eugenia
S. Godfrey, Rockford, Illinois; Mrs. Jessie Palmer Weber, librarian, Illinois State

Public Library; William A. Saxton, chief, Bureau of War Records, Albany, New
York.

[129]

Ellsworthâs diary has disappeared from view and there is a report which
bears considerable evidence of being accurate that it was destroyed in later
years by Ellsworthâs parents. However this may be, it was given, upon his death,
to Corporal Brownell, who had killed Jackson, his assassin. John Hay seems to
have had access to it at one time, for in an article by him in
McClureâs Magazine
,

VI
, 354, many citations from the diary are given. Prior to this, an unidentified
writer in the Chicago
Times
of October 28, 1883, and in the
National Tribune

of October 15, 1885 cites so extensively from Ellsworthâs diary as to render it
probable that he had possession of it either at that or at some prior time.

The letter to Miss Spafford is owned by her sister, Mrs. Charles H. Godfrey,
of Rockford. The letter to Ellsworthâs parents has been published in

WHERE IS THE GERMAN FATHERLAND?

Seventy years ago the people of Wisconsin were deeply
stirred over the issues connected with the framing of a constitution
and admission to statehood. In the
Wisconsin
Banner
, the first German newspaper in the state, was printed
on March 20, 1847, a metrical argument of 168 lines in favor
of âDie Constitution.â The recent posture of public affairs
seems to render apposite the reprinting of a portion of this
poem, which affords a fair idea of the attitude of Wisconsin
Germans of the forties toward certain questions which the
whirligig of time has again brought to the fore. We print
the selection in the original German and in English translation.
For making the latter, acknowledgement is due Dr.
Charles Giessing, of Princeton, formerly of the University
of Wisconsin.

âWas ist des Deutschen Vaterland?

Wo Eide schwÃ¶rt ein Druck der Hand!

Wo Treue hell vom Auge blitzt,

Und Liebe warm im Herzen sitzt!â

So sang ein Mann im HochgefÃ¼hl der Kraft,

Der hat kein Herz, den dieses LÃ¼gen straft.

Was treibt den Deutschen Ã¼ber Land und Meere?

Sagt, warum kÃ¤mpft er fÃ¼r die Union?

Stirbt auf dem Feld des Ruhmes und der Ehre,

FÃ¼r Freiheit und fÃ¼r diese Nation?

Braust nicht der Rhein, der freie deutsche Rhein?

Was treibt ihn fort vom heimathlichen Herde?

StÃ¶sst man ihn aus dem Vaterlande?—Nein!

Dort, dort geht er einher mit krummem RÃ¼cken.

Der Deutsche ist zur Langmuth so geneigt:

Wer leben will, so heisst es, muss sich bÃ¼cken.

Haltâs Maul, ich will Ihn lehren, dass er [Er] schweigt!

In Fesseln wird der freie Geist gebunden,

Er darf nicht reden, was er ausgedacht,

Die Seele wird ihm aus dem Leib geschunden,

Pg 376

Wenn sein beleidigtes GefÃ¼hl erwacht.

Man betet in Egypten heutâger Tage

Die KÃ¼he und die Zwiebeln an,

Allein, bei Gott! den deutschen Mann,

Den sehr Betrognen, treffe unsre Klage,

Der sich so weit, so weit vergehen kann,

Und stÃ¶sst das Recht zurÃ¼ck, das ihm gegeben

Zu einem freien, selbstbewussten Leben.

âWhere is the German Fatherland?

Where oaths are sworn by grasp of hand!

Where loyalty gleams from the eye,

And warm love makes the heart beat high.â

Thus sang a man sure of his powâr and youth,

He has no heart who contradicts its truth.

What drives the German over sea and land,

What force is it that makes the Union dear,

That on the battle-field he takes his stand

To die for liberty, and for this nation here?

Does not the Rhine, free German Rhine still roar,

What drives him forth from hearth and home?

Perchance heâs banished?—Nevermore!

In yonder land stooped oâer a crutch they walk

(The Germans are too supple in their will),

âWho wants to live,â theyâre told, âbend to the yoke!

Shut up! Weâll teach you to be still!â

Freedom of thought in chains is pent,

One may not utter what he thinks,—

His soul perforce is from his body rent,

If pride, awakened, from oppression shrinks.

In Egypt there are men so odd

Who worship cows and onions—their belief.

The German man, howeâer, stirs us to grief,

(Deluded and deceived so oft, good God!)

If he so far be blinded to relief

As to reject this opportunity

Of self-assertive life and free.

THE PAUL REVERE PRINT OF THE BOSTON MASSACRE

Louise Phelps Kellogg

The colony of Massachusetts had successfully resisted the
enforcement of the Stamp Act, and had forced its repeal by
the British Parliament. None the less its rebellious attitude
brought a measure of punishment—the ministry decreed that
four regiments should be quartered in Boston, which had
hitherto been free from the obnoxious presence of a garrison.
The coming of the troops was awaited with apprehension; the
majority of the townspeople considered their presence as a
personal affront. However, the soldiers were disembarked
at the long wharf and marched to the Common without any
hostile demonstration on the part of the populace. The
soldiers soon settled in barracks and entered upon a period
of dull inactivity, broken only by occasional clashes with the
rougher elements of the townâs population. After a year
had passed away two of the four regiments were withdrawn,
leaving the Fourteenth and the Twenty-ninth, which, after
the events of the massacre, were nicknamed the âSam Adams
regiments.â

In the strained relations between the colonial authorities
and the home government, the presence of the troops in
Boston acted as a constant irritant. The ruder class of the
townâs population, sailors, ropemakers, and apprentice lads,
were imbued with the sentiments of the patriotic party, but
lacked the restraint and self-control that marked its leaders.
The soldiers became a constant butt for the rough witticisms
of the lower town element; they were taunted with the
epithets of âbloody-backsâ and âlobstersâ in derision of their
uniform. They were constantly dared to fight, and continually
reminded of the restriction that forbade a movement
of aggression without the orders of a civil magistrate. Several

Pg 378

times individual soldiers were provoked into fisticuff
contests, and frequently came off second best in such encounters
with the town roughs. Upon the whole, the troops
showed commendable restraint, and, in spite of the bad blood
between them and the populace, for nearly two years no
open clash took place.

On the night of March 5, 1770, an incident occurred
which, trivial in itself, led to momentous consequences. A
guard stationed at the Custom House in Kingâs Square was
set upon by a crowd of roughs, and assaulted with a volley
of snowballs. Summoning assistance, the single soldier was
reÃ«nforced by a squad of six under command of Captain
Thomas Preston. The town crowd, instead of dispersing,
continued its insults, while its number was constantly swelled
by fresh recruits. During the excitement someone rang the
town fire bell, and the surrounding populace poured into the
square to witness the nonexistent conflagration. The restraint
of the troops reached the breaking point. In the mÃªlÃ©e an
order to fire was believed to have been heard. The soldiers
leveled their fusees and fired into the crowd, the first volley
killing four bystanders and wounding several more. Aghast
at the consequences of their act, the offending squad withdrew
to the near-by barracks, leaving the âtown-bornâ to
bear away their dead and wounded.

The excitement in the city grew apace throughout the
hours of the night. The townspeople gathered in the streets,
while as the news spread abroad hundreds flocked in from
the countryside. The town committee met at once, and
demanded of the governor that the troops be removed to the
castle in the harbor. After much hesitation and parleying
on the part of the authorities, the request was granted, and
orders were reluctantly given to evacuate the city barracks.
Preston and his firing squad were arrested and placed in the
town gaol. The exasperation and resentment of the populace
threatened dire consequences.

Pg 379

On March 8 occurred the public funeral of the victims,
and the passions of the townspeople were fanned to a still
hotter flame; it was said that fifteen thousand people followed
the four coffins to their last resting place, and that
threats of vengeance were openly expressed. The trial for
murder of Preston and the soldiers in the colonyâs civil courts
soon followed. Excitement against the accused ran high.
Nevertheless, to the honor of Massachusetts the indicted were
given a fair trial, while two of the colonyâs ablest advocates,
John Adams and Josiah Quincy, Jr., offered at the risk of
their reputations and popularity to defend the accused.
Under these circumstances Preston and all but two of the
soldiers were acquitted. The latter received a light sentence
for manslaughter.

In the meantime the town committee, fearing the adverse
effect of this incident upon the British authorities, and dreading
the probable misrepresentation of the facts before the
British public, prepared a defense of the colonyâs position
which they published in a pamphlet entitled:
A Short Narrative
of the horrid Massacre in Boston, Perpetrated in the
Evening of the Fifth Day of March, 1770. By Soldiers of
the
XXIXth
Regiment; which with the
XIVth
Regiment
Were then Quartered there: with some Observations on the
state of things prior to that Catastrophe.
Printed by Order
of the Town of
Boston
, and Sold by
Edes
and
Gill
in
Queen-Street And
T. & J. Fleet
in Cornhill, 1770.

Attached to this pamphlet was a folded plate, which,
according to an inscription in the lower right-hand corner
was âEngraved Printed & Sold by
Paul Revere Boston
.â
Recently Mr. Frank J. Wilder, of Boston, a member of the
State Historical Society, presented to its Library one of the
early reproductions, now become rare, of this celebrated engraving.
The receipt of this interesting gift, which now
hangs in the military history room of the Museum, has

Pg 380

directed attention to the history of the print, which proves
to be of no less interest than is the print itself.

Paul Revere, later so prominently associated with the first
struggle of the Revolutionary War, was of Huguenot descent,
a native of Boston, and had for some time served the
colony as a gold- and silversmith. His first efforts at
engraving were confined to silver plate; later he began to
produce engravings drawn on copper plates and printed on
paper. One of the earliest of these productions was a view
of Boston showing the disembarkation of the troops. Revere
was an ardent patriot, and in all probability formed one of
the crowd of spectators in King Street Square when the soldiers
fired upon the populace. In the Boston Public Library
is still preserved a sketch by his hand of the site of the massacre,
with indications on the diagram showing where the victims
fell. This drawing was no doubt used during the trial
of Captain Preston and his soldiers.

Revere was likewise in close personal relations with Edes
and Gill, the publishers of the exculpatory pamphlet, and he
often prepared wood cuts for the paper they issued, the
Boston
Gazette and Country Journal
. An interesting illustration
of his work appears in the issue of this journal for
March 12, 1770, where above the column devoted to an account
of the public funeral of the victims appear four miniature
black coffins. That these were the work of Revere we
learn from an old account book, found among his papers,
wherein, under the entry for March 9, is a charge to Edes
and Gill of six shillings for âEngraving 5 Coffings for Massacre,â
while pinned to the page is a paper pattern the size
and shape of the tiny coffins appearing in the newspaper.
The State Historical Society of Wisconsin possesses a copy
of this old journal, and there may be seen the heavily black-leaded
page, on which mourning is displayed for the Boston
dead, and the prints of the âcoffingsâ engraved by Revere,
on each of which is cut a skull and crossbones over the initials

Pg 381

of the victim. On that of the youngest of the four appear
the words: âAe. 17,â with a scythe and hourglass indicative
of his having been cut off in the flower of youth. On the
same page with the account of the tragedy and the funeral
occurs the following interesting letter from Captain Preston:

Boston-Gaol
, Monday, 12th March, 1770.

Messieurs
Edes
&
Gill
,

Permit me throâ the Channel of your Paper, to return my Thanks
in the most Publick Manner to the Inhabitants of this Town—who throwing
aside all Party and Prejudice, have with the utmost Humanity and
Freedom stept forth Advocates for Truth, in Defence of my injured
Innocence, in the late unhappy Affair that happened on Monday Night
last: And to assure them, that I shall ever have the highest Sense of the
Justice they have done me, which will be ever gratefully remembered, by

Their much obliged and most obedient humble Servant,

Thomas Preston
.

Let us now examine the picture which Paul Revere prepared
to be presented, with the official pamphlet, to the view
of the British public in order to affect its opinion of the action
of the troops. The engraving is 8Â½ by 9Â¾ inches in size,
and is colored by hand in red, blue, green, and brown. In
the background is the Boston town hall, now known as the
âOld State House,â with its graceful clock-tower rising into
a pale blue sky. At the upper left hand is a chubby, cheerful-looking
crescent moon. The public square is framed on both
sides by its enclosing buildings, over the portal of one of
which, at the right, is the inscription âG R (for Georgius
Rex) Custom House.â Higher still, along the entire faÃ§ade
of the building stretches the imaginary and ironical designation
âButcherâs Hall.â

In the foreground of the picture, and in front of the
Custom House stands in a menacing attitude the file of soldiers,
very red of coats and black of boots. Each has his gun
outstretched with its bayonet pointing to the crowd, while
the clouds of smoke that roll around and behind the figures
testify that the guns have just been discharged among the

Pg 382

unhappy bystanders. At the extreme right of the line of soldiers
stands Captain Preston with uplifted, menacing sword.
Opposite the firing squad is the crowd of citizens, some of
whom have fallen to the ground, or are being supported in
the arms of their comrades. From the breasts and temples
of the wounded streams of blood pour forth and dye the
pavement roundabout. The crowd is in great agitation. One
venturesome townsman lifts his hand as though he would push
back an advancing bayonet. Another clasps his hands in
horror to his breast. Some of the bystanders have turned as
if to flee, but most of them are engaged in succoring their
wounded comrades. One man in brown coat and green vest
is being tenderly lifted by two friends; his head falls helplessly
to one side while a bright red jet of blood pours from
his breast over the green waistcoat. One of the victims lies
on his back, his head drawn up as if he were in agony, one
hand clasps his breast, from a wound in which a crimson
stream flows forth. The boy victim lies motionless on the
ground, a pool of blood from his forehead dyeing the pavement
near his head. In front of this whole group stands a
composed, indifferent-looking dog, quite unmoved by the
tragic scene behind him. The quaint costumes and stiff attitudes
of the actors in the picture, the shapeless, ill-drawn legs
of the soldiers, and the stolid, expressionless faces of the participants
indicate that the engraver was a tyro in his art. To
the observer, however, these defects in some measure enhance
the interest of the picture and give it the charm peculiar to
primitive productions.

PAUL REVERE PRINT OF THE BOSTON MASSACRE

The inscriptions above and below the print add to its intrinsic
interest. The passionate appeal for sympathy for the
slain made by these inscriptions indicates the depths of feeling
aroused by the massacre. Across the top is printed, âThe

Bloody Massacre
perpetrated in King Street
Boston
on
March 5th 1770 by a party of the 29
th

Reg
t
.â Underneath
the picture is the following remarkable effusion, probably

Pg 383

from the pen of Paul Revere himself, who frequently indulged
in such attempts at literary effort:

Unhappy
Boston
! See thy Sons deplore.

Thy hallowâd Walks besmearâd with guiltless Gore.

While faithless P——n [Preston] and his savage Bands,

With murdârous Rancour stretch their bloody Hands;

Like fierce Barbarians grinning oâer their Prey,

Approve the Carnage, and enjoy the Day.

If scalding drops from Rage from Anguish Wrung

If speechless Sorrows labâring for a Tongue,

Or if a weeping World can aught appease

The plaintive Ghosts of Victims such as these;

The Patriotâs copious Tears for each are shed,

A glorious Tribute which embalms the Dead.

But know
Fate
summons to that awful Goal

Where
Justice
strips the Murdârer of his Soul;

Should venal C——ts the scandal of the Land,

Snatch the relentless Villain from her Hand,

Keen Execrations on this Plate inscribâd,

Shall reach a
Judge
who never can be bribâd.

The unhappy Sufferers were Mess

two of them (

&

.

Two hundred copies of the pamphlet were issued in the
first edition, and for his work upon the plate the Revere
papers tell us that the engraver received five pounds. A
number of variants of the original plate appeared within a
few months of its production. One was reduced in size to
accompany an octavo edition of the pamphlet. This latter
engraving was 4Â½ by 6â
 inches. It had no inscription at
the top but underneath bore the following words: âThe
Massacre perpetrated in King Street on March 5
th
1770, in
which Mess
rs
Sam
l
Gray, Sam
l
Maverick, James Caldwell,
Crispus Attucks Patrick Carr were Killed, six others
Wounded two of them Mortally.â The different proportions
of this plate give to the picture more sky and foreground
than the one we have described above. The second

Pg 384

edition of the pamphlet with the smaller engraving was reprinted
without change in London by E. & C. Dilly and J.
Almon in the same year that the
Short Narrative
appeared
in Boston.

Two other London editions of the pamphlet were issued
the same year by the publishing firm of W. Bingley in Newgate
Street. One of these has for its frontispiece an engraving
8Â½ by 12 inches in size, with the following inscription
across the top: âThe Fruits of Arbitrary Power; or the
Bloody Massacre, Perpetrated in King Street, Boston by a
Party of the
XXIX

Regt.
â Underneath is printed Revereâs
original poem, without the accompanying names of the victims.
On the left of the poem the following verse is surmounted
by a skull and crossbones within a wreath: âHow
long shall they utter and speak hard things? And all the
workers of iniquity boast themselves? They break in pieces
thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage.
Ps. XCIV
,
4, 5.â On the right of the poem appears the design of a
liberty cap in clouds from which issue forks of lightning and
two broken swords. Underneath is printed, âThey slay the
widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Yet they
say, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Ps. XCIV
, 6, 7.â Some of these prints have been
found with only the two devices and without the scriptural
quotations.

Still one more print appeared in London in 1770 which
shows marked variations from all those previously described.
These were all variants of Revereâs original plate, and differ
only in size, proportions, and inscriptions. The print which
we now describe is so different in composition and so much
better in execution that it would seem to be the work of another
artist than Revere. Not only are the proportions of
the picture changed, but the handling of the perspective is
much better, the drawing of the figures, and the expression
of the faces show the handiwork of a genuine artist. The

Pg 385

arrangement of the figures is the same, but the soldiersâ legs
become quite possible members of their bodies, able to bear
a manâs weight. The fallen figures lie in better and easier
attitudes. The grouping of the crowd is less confused, and
in the background appear the heads of two women wearing
bonnets, that are not seen in the original Revere prints.
Moreover, there is no dog in the foreground and no moon
in the sky of this latter print. The question arises whether
some other artist adapted Revereâs composition, materially
improving it in so doing, or whether Revere himself secured
his suggestions for his work from the author of this latter
print. This is answered by a letter found some years since
among the Pelham-Copley papers in the British Public
Record Office and printed by the Massachusetts Historical
Society in one of its recent volumes of
Collections
.

Henry Pelham was a young half brother of the famous
colonial artist Copley, and the original of the latterâs lovely
picture, âThe Boy with a Squirrel.â Young Pelham lived in
a family of artists and himself early displayed considerable
talent. He learned engraving from his father Peter Pelham,
one of Bostonâs earliest engravers. The following letter
was written by the younger Pelham to Paul Revere:

Thursday Morng. Boston, March 29, 1770.

Sir,

When I heard that you was cutting a plate of the late Murder. I
thought it impossible, as I knew you was not capable of doing it unless
you coppied it from mine and as I thought I had entrusted it in the hands
of a person who had more regard to the dictates of Honour and Justice
than to take the undue advantage you have done of the confidence and
Trust I reposed in you. But I find I was mistaken, and after being at
the great Trouble and Expence of making a design paying for paper,
printing &c, find myself in the most ungenerous Manner deprived, not
only of any proposed Advantage, but even of the expence I have been at,
as truly as if you had plundered me on the highway. It you are insensible
of the Dishonour you have brought on yourself by this Act, the World will

Pg 386

not be so. However, I leave you to reflect upon and consider of one of
the most dishonorable Actions you could well be guilty of.

H. Pelham.

In the absence of any defense by Paul Revere, and in the
presence of the better engraving made along the lines and
with the same general arrangement as that claimed by Revere,
it would seem that we must convict the latter of the plagiarism
with which Pelham charged him. Some of the latterâs
prints were issued, since among his papers is the charge in
March, 1770, of three pounds nine shillings by one Daniel
Rea âTo printing 575 of your Prints @ 12| Pr. Hund.â
Pelham was a much abler artist than Revere; moreover, it
should be noted that the latter prints upon his engraving only
the words, âengraved, printed, and sold by Paul Revere,â all
of which might have been the literal truth, had he utilized the
design of the younger artist. None the less his appropriation
without compensation of his young neighborâs design is much
to his discredit, and detracts from the interest and enjoyment
with which we examine this most famous and interesting of
Paul Revereâs engravings.

The vogue for this picture of the massacre has been very
great from the time of its first printing until the present.
We have seen how many editions appeared in 1770. These
spread rapidly throughout all the English colonies in
America. So popular did the prints become that as early as
1785 a new edition became necessary, while the original prints
were much in demand, and formed part of early collections
of Americana. Originals of 1770 are now so highly prized
that single copies sell for anywhere from $750 to $1,000. In
1832 an excellent reproduction was issued, which has in its
turn become rare enough to command $50 upon the market.

How much the publication of the original prints had to
do with the profound sensation that the âBoston Massacreâ
awakened everywhere among the American colonies we have
no means of judging. Certainly the representation was calculated

Pg 387

to arouse intense resentment against the British soldiery,
and this feeling may have contributed to the alacrity
with which the colonists took up arms in defense of their
liberty. From a trivial encounter between imperial troops
and the Boston mob, the incident arose to a position of international
importance. Its pictorial presentation, therefore,
has become a part of our national history.

DOCUMENTS

SOME LETTERS OF PAUL O. HUSTING CONCERNING
THE PRESENT CRISIS

The advent of the world struggle which still rages between
the forces of autocracy and democracy found our
nation as a whole, and many of us as individuals, unprepared
to meet the new conditions and to withstand the test of the
new issues with which we were confronted. But it did not
find the mind of Paul Husting wanting in the needful qualities
of intellect, or his soul in those of courage.

In the brief period of service as senator from Wisconsin
he revealed himself as one of Wisconsinâs greatest sons, and
his untimely death in October, 1917, was a genuine calamity
both to state and to nation in their hour of trial and danger.
Not often does the opportunity occur to a historical journal
to publish documents fraught at the same time with a high
degree of historical value and of interest for their bearing
on issues still current. Such an opportunity, we think, is
afforded the
Wisconsin Magazine of History
in connection
with the documents which follow. The letters speak for
themselves and aside from certain minor typographical corrections
we present them unedited. However, we cannot
refrain, in concluding this introductory note, from calling
the readerâs attention to the significance of the dates of the
several letters: the first, following the sinking of the
Lusitania
;
the second, at the time the embargo-on-munitions discussion
was rife; the third, following our entrance into the
world war.

Your letter of May 10th, enclosing clipping from a Chilton
newspaper, was duly received and read. The clipping

Pg 389

which you have enclosed entitled âThe United States, an
Ally of England against Germany and Austria-Hungaryâ
is a very coarse and vituperative and un-American attack on
President Wilson and his administration. In this article, the
President in substance and effect is portrayed as a weakling,
a tool of England, a hypocrite, who pretends to be what he is
not, and with sanctimonious phrase is trying to mislead the
people. The administration is charged with being in a secret
pact with England against Germany and winds up with
asking the people of this country how long they are going
to stand the disgrace of having such a government.

I do not believe that I have the honor of your acquaintance
but, nevertheless, I feel that the article sent me and your
letter should be replied to because there are other papers and
other men engaged in carrying out this sort of propaganda.

There are, I know, a number of good and patriotic citizens
of this country, who, because of lack of information,
and because of their intense sympathy for relatives and
friends now fighting in the old country, have permitted themselves
to be misled in the belief that this country has unjustly,
and, contrary to the laws of nations, permitted the shipment
of munitions of war to European countries. There are, however,
also, a number of men and newspapers who are merely
repeating and spreading a propaganda originating in the
old country with a design and purpose to weaken their own
government and aid and strengthen one of the belligerent
nations. I hope that I am addressing you as one who may
be put in the first class mentioned.

Your criticism of President Wilson must be the result
either of blind partisanship, of a lack of familiarity with the
facts relating to our present foreign relations, of a failure to
fully comprehend the exact meaning and difficulties of neutrality,
or of a desire to plunge this country into [the] European
embroglio without considering whether we have any
cause or excuse for entering that awful conflict. Considerations
of partisanship are so loathsome in times of great national
crises that I believe you incapable of entertaining such
and I freely acquit you of such base motives. The high-minded
attitude of former President Taft ought to be sufficient
to deter everyone from seeking to make political or

Pg 390

partisan capital out of the present delicate situation. I cannot
conceive that you feel yourself in closer allegiance to
Germany than you do to this nation, for then your words
would not be those of an American citizen but of one who is
an alien, at least in thought, and not entitled to the protection
or blessings of our free government. I assume that you are
laboring under a misconception of the facts and upon the
assumption that you have been misguided, I am writing you
fully in reply to your letter.

I find no fault with American citizens or American newspapers
(in this, of course, I include those printed in the
German language) that sympathize with Germany as against
England nor do I find any fault with the criticism directed
against Englandâs war policy or methods. Our government
has repeatedly remonstrated and protested to England
against the interference with our commerce with neutral
countries, in the shipment of non-contraband of war to belligerent
countries, in the unlawful seizure of our vessels, and
in the general interference with our rights as a neutral nation.
I wish to add my objections and express my resentment
against England for her studied and persistent violations of
many provisions of the international law. We have protested
and have done everything that we lawfully and justly could
do to support and maintain our rights, short of going to war.
Withal, however, no American ships or lives have been lost
as a result of Englandâs operations upon the sea and no
passenger boat carrying citizens of the United States has
been sunk.

In the obstruction of our commerce and our dealings with
foreign nations, Germany has gone as far as its ability permitted
and is certainly subject, in this respect, to the same
criticism and resentment that we have directed against England.
It seems that England and Germany in the operation
of the war in retaliation and in reprisal have set aside the
international code and are justifying anything and everything
upon the ground or plea of necessity. So long as this
mode of warfare is directed against one another of the belligerent
countries or their citizens, while we stand horrified
and appalled, we may still have no just cause for interference.
We have suffered these inconveniences and losses to

Pg 391

our business because not only our government, but our people
desire peace, and, furthermore, because we have no desire to
interfere between the belligerent countries. Now, while at
most, Germany can only claim that, in respect to the hindrance
to our commerce, she has done no worse than England,
yet, in addition to this, ships flying the American flag have
been assailed and sunk by her and American lives taken without
justification and now the world is appalled by the destruction
of over 1,200 lives ruthlessly taken and men, women,
and children have gone down to their death defenseless and
undefended.

It is no defense or justification of this act as against our
country that some other nation by its unlawful acts compelled
the country at fault also to commit unlawful acts by way of
reprisal.

It is no defense to say that American citizens who lost
their lives were warned and that they lost their lives through
their own contributory negligence. No warning to commit
an unlawful act is a defense or justification of such unlawful
act. Such warning, in fact, negatives the idea of accident
and evidences premeditation and design to commit the unlawful
act.

We know that the
Lusitania
was sunk, that more than
100 American lives were lost, and we must hold the country
directly responsible for a deed which has shocked the civilized
world and which appears to have been in violation of the law
governing, and practices obtaining in, civilized warfare. Notwithstanding
the horror and resentment aroused in the public
mind, our President is still striving to avert war!

What would you now say if a German liner with Americans
aboard had been sunk by an English torpedo under like
circumstances and our President would not have counseled
war against the offending country but would still have stood
for peace? Would you not have said then that this country
was favoring England and would you not have reiterated
and repeated your slander that this country is an ally of
Englandâs?

In the slanderous clipping sent me, it is charged that this
country is pretending neutrality when in fact, by not forbidding
the shipment of arms and munitions of war, we are violating
the law of nations governing neutrals.

Pg 392

This slander against our country has been repeated over
and over again by thoughtless men and by partisan newspapers.
It originated across the sea with those who well
know the falsity and hypocrisy of the charge and who have
passed it on to a well-meaning and sympathetic, but over-zealous
and mistaken, people and press for the purpose of
accomplishing a selfish end. This slander has been fostered
and given currency also by some designing men and by some
designing newspapers who appear to have forgotten their
duty to their country and who appear to be concerned more
with the effect that the present war has upon some foreign
country than with its effect upon our own country.

The laws of nations are the rules which determine the
conduct of the general body of civilized states in their dealings
with one another. Its doctrines are founded on legal,
not simply on ethical ideas; since they purport to be rules
of justice, not counsels of perfection, the foreign policies of
a country are not founded upon feelings of moral rightness
but upon precedents, treaties, and opinions of those recognized
as authority.

International law is a part of the law of the land and,
since the interest of the United States with foreign nations
and the policies in regard to them are placed by the Constitution
in the hands of the federal government, its decisions
upon these subjects are
obligatory upon every citizen
.

The above are some of the elementary principles of international
law. These nations which are protected by these
provisions also are subject to corresponding duties and obligations.
Those which invoke the law must obey the law.
International law, being the joint product of civilized nations,
adopted and made by the common and joint consent of nations,
of course, can not be repealed or amended by any one
nation but only by the mutual consent of all countries. If it
were otherwise, each country would make its own international
law to be amended or repealed at the will of such
country and thus would have no effect either upon itself or
any other nation.

Now we have an international law and its provisions are
well defined and recognized. Now is there any provision in
this law which forbids or makes unlawful the shipment of

Pg 393

arms by citizens of a neutral country to a belligerent country
or which gives a neutral country the privilege to forbid such
shipment? No. Then why not? Because it has been the
law since civilization began for citizens of neutral countries
to engage in commerce as they chose and at their risk, subject
only to the right of belligerents to intercept and seize contraband
of war in transit to a belligerent enemy. In all the wars
in which this country has been engaged, the citizens of the
countries now warring in Europe have recognized and countenanced
this practice of selling arms to our enemy while we
were at war and we have neither protested nor complained
against it, fully recognizing that the citizens of such countries
were entirely within their rights, that we had no just cause
for complaint. We recognized that it would have been a
violation of international law if at that time the said countries
had prohibited the shipment of munitions of war with
a purpose clearly manifested to aid or benefit either ourselves
or our enemy.

For scores of years those countries now engaged in the
European war have been arming themselves and fortifying
their country with the positive knowledge that sooner or later
a conflict of the kind now raging would occur. England,
France, and Russia did and so did Germany and Austria.
They also well knew that, under the provisions of international
law, the shipment of arms and munitions of war was
permissible subject to the interception and seizure of them
by belligerent enemies. Long before this war, which they
knew was inevitable, started Germany and Austria had the
opportunity and the influence to have changed the international
law and there is no doubt that the United States would
have joined them in this amendment. Far-seeing as its
statesmen are and having well in mind the provisions of international
law, yet, notwithstanding, Germany entered this
war with the law as it now stands.

If international law had, at the beginning of the present
war, prohibited the shipment of munitions of war from this
country and the United States nevertheless had violated the
rule and permitted the shipment of munitions of war,
then

it could be charged and convicted of a violation of the law
and a breach of neutrality by the country adversely affected

Pg 394

by such violation. Why? Because we would then have been
guilty of an affirmative act unlawfully changing the established
law to the injury and prejudice of a country with
whom we are at peace without its consent. Such act would
have been a breach of neutrality because, international law
having been established by mutual consent, we would have
no right to repeal and amend that law without the consent
of those adversely affected by the change.

Now to prohibit and prevent the shipment of munitions
of war by an affirmative act on our part, at the behest and
for the exclusive benefit of one of the countries now at war,
without the consent of the nations adversely affected thereby,
would be a violation of international law and would constitute
a breach of neutrality on our part which would be indefensible
from the standpoint of good faith and good friendship
to all on our part. Now it must be remembered that
the United States government is not engaged in the shipment
of munitions of war to other countries. A good many misguided
and uninformed people have been led to believe that
this country as a nation is thus engaged. It is true, that citizens
of this country as a matter of business are engaged in
manufacturing and selling to individuals, from whatever
country they may come, munitions of war, as citizens of
Germany, Austria, and other belligerent countries have done
since time immemorial. President Wilson has not approved
such shipments. It is entirely probable that, from a moral
standpoint, he abhors the manufacture and sale of instruments
and commodities to be used in the slaughter of human
beings. He is a man of peace, and, if he had his way, wars
in the future would be an impossibility.

But, as President of the United States,—a country which
is in no sense responsible for this war—a country whose sole
and passionate desire is to keep out of this conflict—Woodrow
Wilson must execute the laws as he finds them and must
maintain the neutrality of this country in accordance with
the law of nations. This he has done patiently, persistently,
and consistently, notwithstanding that blind and bitter partisanship,
now on one side, now on the other, has done its best
to shove him off his balance.

Pg 395

Permit me to say that you, and men like you, and newspapers
publishing like articles commit a base and cruel slander
on the President and on your country when you state otherwise.
This country, of all the countries of the world, has
kept its obligations and its poise.

In war-maddened Europe both England and Germany
have attempted to annul the law to suit the exigencies of the
moment. Our country, however, has contended, and, clearly
within its rights, has demanded the observance of the law of
nations and has refused to recognize the right of the warring
nations to annul or to amend the same to our damage or in
derogation of our rights.

How, then, in view of these facts, could we hold belligerents
to their lawful duties if we were at the same time to
violate the law and put ourselves in the same class with them.
But this is what you and other critics ask this country to do.
It is clear that you do not want this country to be neutral;
you want it to take an affirmative and active part by governmental
action to help one country and hurt another. Your
and my government is endeavoring to maintain the status quo
of a real neutrality. Those who are responsible for this movement
which you approve of are endeavoring to shake and
disturb it. Those who complain of our want of neutrality
are complaining only because we have not become an ally
of the country they favor.

If we listened to the insidious demands made by these
countries that would have us violate our lawful obligation
to respect the law of nations by affirmatively aiding and
assisting their side, would we not be stopped from demanding
reparation for the misconduct of the other countries who have
been prejudiced by our unlawful and unneutral act? And
would not such a flagrant breach of international obligation
on our part justify reprisals against us, or worse than that,
probably eventuate in a war with those countries who would
thus be unlawfully and unfairly prejudiced by our act?

These countries who would have us place an embargo on
arms and munitions with an eye solely to their advantage
might well favor an act on our part which would plunge us
into war with their enemies and thus make us their own ally.
From the standpoint of
their
own material advantage, and

Pg 396

owing this country no duty whatever, it is easy to understand
the motive back of their wishes.

But what motive, I ask, prompts you or any other American
citizen who, owing a duty only to this country, should
have in mind at all times primarily the welfare of his own
country, to aid and promote a foreign propaganda, which
has for its object and end the plunging of this country into
war with one side or the other.

I say I acquit you of any base motive and can only believe
that your utterances and your actions are the result of a want
of information and understanding and not a willful desire
on your part to injure the country which you are bound to
support.

You could not be either misguided or mistaken, however,
if you had not blindly accepted as true the statement of facts
and the statement of international law as promulgated by a
foreign government and its emissaries rather than the statements
of fact and the statements of law promulgated by your
own government. What right have you to doubt the utterances
of our President, who is serving this country with that
singleness of purpose which has always distinguished the acts
of our presidents?

What right have you to believe the utterances of emissaries,
who have been sent from abroad with a singleness of
purpose to serve their own government at whatever cost to
ours by sowing discord and falsehood among our people and
who are trespassing upon our forbearance and are violating
obligations which we believe a visitor to our shores owes to
our people?

To put it in another way, may I not ask you, as a citizen,
what reason or right you have to believe or expect that a
foreign country and its emissaries are safe advisers for the
citizens of the United States to consult or follow? And may
I not also ask you, what there is in the life of President Wilson
as a man and his record as a president that warrants you or
any American citizen or newspaper in believing or asserting
that he is not a man to believe or a safe president and counselor
to follow? These questions answer themselves.

This country is now confronted with a crisis. Notwithstanding
the wave of popular indignation that has been

Pg 397

aroused in this country, the President is straining every nerve
to preserve peace and still maintain the honor and dignity of
this country. You, and others that have been uttering the
same charges that you have, have made the task more difficult
than it otherwise would be. There appears to be a feeling in
some foreign countries that our country is divided.

A short while ago, a prominent citizen of a foreign country,
whose utterances are recognized as semi-official, stated in
substance that, while his country was a unit, that that was
more than could be said of the United States in all cases.

In the Milwaukee
Journal
of Wednesday, May 12th, a
translated article from the Frankfurter
Zeitung
was quoted
as stating âthat because of the fact that we have naturalized
German citizens and a number of natural-born Americans of
German descent that a war between this country and Germany
would be impossible because of the necessity of placing
these citizens in the detention camp and that it would require
our entire army to watch over them.â

These statements can only mean that the belief is entertained
in that country that, in case of certain eventualities,
this country would be divided and that certain of our citizens
would side with Germany against our government. Such a
belief if indeed prevalent in that country is a serious obstacle
to a peaceful termination of our negotiations in the present
crisis.

But to those of us who have read the history of the Revolutionary
War, of the rebellion, and of every other war in
which we have been engaged as a nation—those of us who
love and admire our German friends and neighbors, who are
familiar with their spirit of American citizenship and patriotism,
who have lived amongst them and have felt and feel one
with them, know that these statements are unfounded and
we resent them as a base calumny upon some of our most
respected citizens. It is an insult to American citizenship.
It in effect amounts to a charge of disloyalty and treason
against some of our best citizens. Such a statement should
be publicly resented, however, first of all by those against
whom this slander is directed, not because their loyalty and
patriotism is doubted here, but because it is doubted elsewhere.
It is necessary for the world to understand and know

Pg 398

that America is united as one man. This will do more to keep
us out of war than all the clamor and all the pressure that
can be brought to bear upon our President to abandon our
neutrality and to violate our international obligations.

Permit me to say that in a time like this it is your duty
and the duty of every citizen of the United States to stand
loyally and patriotically back of our government. Not only
as a matter of law is it your duty but from a natural sense of
obligation as a citizen of a great nation, whose benefits and
blessings you enjoy, and whose existence you are at all hazards
bound to preserve. We are fortunate indeed that we
have a president like Woodrow Wilson at the head of our
affairs at this time. A man less capable, less patriotic, less
intelligent, less courageous might have precipitated us in the
war before this. He is now standing four square to all the
winds that blow, in an endeavor to preserve peace with honor,
dignity, and safety to ourselves. Let all of us unite to do
all we can to keep firm and [word illegible] any extreme
and ill-considered speech.

In times like these, permit me to say that we should not
only feel but act together. This is no time for petty partisanship
or petty politics. This is a time for deliberation and
moderation in thought, word, and deed. It is a time for the
submersion of all our differences, sympathies, and feelings
in a unity of purpose and desire for our countryâs good.

In conclusion, permit me to say that all of us who may
trace our ancestry across the sea no matter to what particular
country, should be the first to speak out loudly and clearly
that our undivided loyalty and allegiance is with America,
always, no matter what may be our tie.

Yours very truly,

Paul O. Husting.

Washington, D. C., Apr. 1, 1916.

Rev.
—— ——,

Wis.

Dear Sir:

Your letter of some time ago, expressing the disapproval
of the pastors of the Lutheran Conference of the Iowa Synod
held in Beaver Dam, in January, of my attitude on the embargo
on munitions question was duly received. The letter

Pg 399

appeared in the Milwaukee papers on the Saturday before
and therefore its contents were familiar to me before receiving
the same by mail. The reason that this letter was not
answered was because it seemed to me that it called for no
reply but that it was merely intended to give public expression
to your disapproval by your Conference of my attitude
and vote on these questions.

Now in reply to yours of the 20th inst. and also to that
above referred to let me first say that I regret very much
that any act or attitude of mine as Senator from Wisconsin
should meet with the disapproval of any number of my fellow
citizens. I am not insensible of the support that I received
from many citizens of German extraction in the last campaign
nor do I think that there is anybody representing the
state of Wisconsin who is more anxious to please and to retain
the confidence, respect, and good will of his fellow citizens
of German extraction or ancestry, for that matter, than I
am, provided that I can do so without acting inconsistently
with my oath of office or my sense of duty.

In justification of my attitude let me say then that my
vote and my attitude on our foreign relations are the result
of deep-seated convictions based upon study and a great deal
of thought upon this subject and I am maintaining such attitude
and convictions upon the subject (notwithstanding that
some of my fellow citizens disagree with me) because I am
convinced that if I did otherwise I would be committing my
country to a wrong and dangerous policy—a policy which
not only might, but which probably would, force us into war
and this is a result which I understand neither you nor any
other citizen desires, if it can honorably be avoided. Holding
such convictions (at least honestly formed) I feel that
would be violating my oath of office and my duty as a Senator
if I voted contrary to my convictions in order to please you
or others. This I manifestly cannot and of course will not
do. I consider it my first duty as a Senator and as a citizen
to support and sustain my government in a crisis like this.

The criticism expressed in your letter is confined to two
matters only, namely: First—My attitude on the embargo
question. Second—My vote on the Gore Resolution. And
you tell me that my attitude on the one and my vote on the

Pg 400

other is not in accordance with the wishes or sentiments of the
people of Wisconsin.

The substance of your criticism is contained in the sentence
which I quote from your letter: âWe therefore have a perfect
right to expect that those men, whom we sent to represent

our
interests, whom we sent to represent us before the President
we have elected, should vote as we would vote, if we had
an opportunity to cast our vote. We know full well that you
are not an instructed delegate, this being impossible, and
yet you ought to vote as you know that your constituents

require
you to vote.â

Now let me ask you upon what you base your assertion
that I am not voting the way the majority of my constituents
ârequireâ me to vote? The people of the state of Wisconsin
have never yet recorded or had an opportunity to record their
sentiment or opinions on these questions, and consequently I
have no means at my command that will enable me to inform
myself as to how my constituents would ârequireâ me to vote.
I believe that you will admit that you have no means of ascertaining
or knowing how the people of Wisconsin would
ârequireâ me to vote and that you are merely assuming that
all the people of Wisconsin feel as you and your associates
do upon these matters. I believe furthermore that you will
admit that sympathizing with Germany as you do that you
are not an impartial and unbiased judge of the facts involved
in the issue. I am sure that there are thousands of others in
this state who believe and claim that the people of Wisconsin
are overwhelmingly supporting President Wilsonâs attitude
on both of these questions. Of course these expressions of
opinion come from many who also are not impartial and unprejudiced
or unbiased in the premises although I may add
that I have received scores and scores of letters from men of
German ancestry who hold a like opinion to mine. With
such conflicting opinions as is perfectly natural to be the case
in a state of mixed population like Wisconsin even you must
admit that the sentiment of the people of our state is by no
means unanimous on the subject matter. At the beginning
of and so long as our country was not in danger of being
drawn into this terrible war, I also indulged myself in sympathizing
with a certain side in this worldâs struggle. But for

Pg 401

over a year this country has stood and now stands on the
very verge of a volcano and no one could, nor now can, know
when we will be drawn into its crater. Consequently, ever
since this danger has arisen, I have tried to dismiss from
mind all interest in connection with the war except in so far
as it affects or might affect the interests or rights of our
people and our country and I harbor no motive in my consciousness
in connection with my office other than to protect
and promote our own countryâs rights and interests. With
such motive and such thought, I feel that I ought to be able
to vote upon this European situation fairly and impartially
as between the belligerents. I am at least conscious of this:
That whatever attitude I take and whatever vote I cast is
cast with reference solely to its effect on this country and
regardless of its effect upon the welfare of any other country
in the world.

Now under such circumstances do you think that I should
allow your sympathies or the sympathies of your associates
or my sympathies to outweigh and overcome my settled convictions,
and that I should violate my oath of office as United
States Senator and act and vote in direct contradiction to
what I conceive to be my duty as a Senator and as a citizen
of the United States? I cannot think that you would have
me do so. I cannot in a letter repeat my reasons, which I
have so often stated in public speeches and interviews, why I
am opposed to our government placing an embargo on munitions
of war and, consequently, I must refer you to such
speeches and interviews for such information. I can only
state that such action on the part of our country would in my
judgment be a gross breach of neutrality which not only
might, but probably would, involve us in a war with those
foreign countries adversely affected by such action on our
part. I voted against the Gore Resolution because I am
opposed,
by governmental action
, to curtailing or abandoning
the rights of our citizens upon the high seas or wherever they
have a right to be, as an act unworthy of a great nation and
of a great people, and, furthermore, because I am sure that
with the passage of such a resolution our troubles in that
respect would not have been ended but would have only just
begun. With the abandonment of one right, we would soon

Pg 402

have been called upon to abandon another and still another,
and, having said âA,â we would not only have had to say
âBâ but we would have had to continue clear down the alphabet
to âZ,â and we would finally find ourselves bereft of all
rights cravenly and uselessly abandoned by us to wrong-doing
countries. Personally, I would not now travel on the high
seas unless I was obliged thus to travel and I would not ask
or in fact advise any friend of mine to travel upon the high
seas under present conditions, but what I am opposed to is
that our government by affirmative action should warn our
citizens not to travel upon the high seas and in effect then
to license the world to kill and slaughter our citizens in the
act of exercising their God-given and lawful rights so to do.
Such authoritative action would be a puerile abandonment
of the rights of our citizens and of our country and a cowardly
withdrawal of the protection which our flag owes to our people
and would not only invite the contempt and aggression of
the belligerent nations but would bring us into contempt in
the eyes of our own citizens themselves.

Now, in the sentence quoted, you characterized me as one
of those â* * * whom we sent to represent
our
interests
* * * .â Now let me ask you whether you or your
associates have any interest which I am representing other or
different in any degree from that of any other citizen of
Wisconsin? You surely can have no interest, which I represent,
in the success of any foreign nation in this war. You
may have
wishes
or
hopes
in regard to the outcome of the war
in Europe but as an
American
citizen you certainly have no

interest
in the result. The interests of our country, your
interests, my interests, are identical and are limited to this:
That we keep our hands off and let the warring nations fight
it out according to the rules of international law and, if we
can, protect the lives of our people and maintain their rights
and the rights of our country and preserve our national honor.
While it is not my
duty
to
represent
your
wishes
(which
may stand in direct contravention to the dictates of our own
national welfare), it is my duty to represent (and it is my
conviction that I am performing that duty and am properly
representing) the interests of the country,
your
interests,
my

interests, and the interests of all the people of the United

Pg 403

States, when I take the attitude I am taking and vote as I
have voted.

Now while I have grown up among people of German
ancestry and have grown to love and respect my German-American
neighbors, among whom I count you and many
others of your cloth, I cannot and will not forget that as
Senator I represent all of the people of Wisconsin regardless
of ancestry or accident of birth and as such Senator I
represent not only the people of Wisconsin but the people of
the United States as a whole, and I want to say further that
as long as I remain in the Senate I shall count the interests
of my country first, wholly without regard to its effect upon
my political fortunes or upon the fortunes of any foreign
country.

While I have no authority to talk for anyone but myself,
I believe that President Wilson is actuated by the same
motives as I am. Can any man doubt that the President
of the United States is doing what he does and acting as he
acts with any thought in his mind other than the welfare of
his country and of our people? Now you say in your letter,
âI admit that we have not the insight into the inner affairs
and for that reason leave it to the discretion of our representatives
to cast their vote to the best welfare of the Stateâ;
and further you say in substance that you have taken a vital
interest in this matter and that the consensus of opinion of
your associates, the majority of whom are university men,
is that an embargo should be placed upon munitions of war.
Now you admit that your opinion is based upon imperfect,
incomplete, unreliable, and (what at times must be) false
information. You also inferentially admit, as you must
admit (indeed as everybody knows is the fact) that the President
and his Cabinet are in possession of the most perfect,
the most complete, most reliable and most trustworthy information
obtainable. Moreover, the President is also a university
man (if that has anything to do with it) and is he not
also a citizen of the United States who loves his country? Is
he not a man of intellect, of integrity, of patriotism, of ability,
of courage, a man possessing all those attributes that go to
make up our idea of a good American citizen? As President,
in the handling of domestic affairs, has he not shown himself

Pg 404

mindful of the welfare of the masses of the people?
In this worldâs crisis has he not kept us out of war during
the most trying times—under the gravest difficulties—when
there was not a Congress in session and when there were no
warning resolutions; when newspapers, politicians, partisans,
and sympathizers were trying to provoke him into the most
drastic action against one or the other side of this controversy?
And this at a time when scores of incidents have occurred,
each one alone of sufficient importance to have provoked us
into war against one side or the other side of the belligerents,
had the President been so minded. When you and I and
all of us during the summer of 1915 were pursuing our peaceful
occupations in Wisconsin, the President was left alone
to carry a load that would have staggered and borne down
any ordinary man! During all this time, in waking or in
sleeping, has he had anything in his mind but the peaceful
solution of his monumental task without dishonor to our
country?

And now let me ask whether you ought not to admit that
it is a little presumptuous on your part to think or claim
that you are more patriotic, more desirous of doing, and
better able to do justice between the belligerents of Europe—more
desirous and better able to safeguard and protect the
national honor and the welfare and rights of our people than
our president, Woodrow Wilson? In other words, are you
not willing to concede that, under all the facts and circumstances
surrounding this vital matter, Woodrow Wilson ought
to be better qualified in all respects to properly pass upon
these questions and to protect our rights than anyone else
who neither has the responsibility or the opportunity nor has
devoted the thought and time to this matter, that he has?

Now would you and your associates, with all due respect
to your learning and information, which at best (as you
admit is, and which necessarily can be, based only on imperfect
and uncertain premises) have me accept your judgment
in this matter in preference to that of the President of
the United States? Not only that, but would you have me
under
such circumstances
disregard the judgment of the
President and his Cabinet who are lawfully invested with
the authority and business of determining these questions

Pg 405

which as a matter of law is and as a matter of common
sense ought to be final and binding upon the people of the
United States and with this also abandon my own judgment
and accept yours in lieu thereof? If each citizen of the
United States would set
his
judgment and opinion above that
of the President of the United States in our foreign affairs
and refuse to abide by his conclusions in time of acute crises
such as these, could anything but national chaos be the result?
In domestic affairs that do not concern the life of the country
we all have a right to insist upon our opinions and, even then,
we must bow when overruled by the majority. Then how
much more in foreign affairs must we lodge somewhere
authority for determining matters affecting our national life
itself. And where else shall we lodge them than in the hands
of our President and Secretary of State, at least until all
diplomatic means shall have been exhausted? Now I do not
say that citizens have no right to express their opinions even
on foreign affairs; but what I do say is that they ought not
to so exercise that right and so conduct themselves as to embarrass
and hinder our government in its diplomatic negotiations
with foreign countries
at times like these
, and thus
imperil, if not absolutely prevent, a peaceful solution of our
difficulties, great enough in themselves, but made still greater
by the utterances of some papers and persons which give color
and basis for the claim and impression abroad that we are a
disunited and demoralized people, a people who have lost
their faith and confidence in their own government, and who
will not give it their loyal and undivided support in all eventualities.
We can maintain peace best by presenting a solid
front to all nations to the end that they may know and understand
that we are one and indivisible no matter what may
come!

Now you further say: âAs to the notion that under all
circumstances the opinions of the President must be upheld,
in order to be loyal Americans, that is pure and simple 'rot.ââ
Let me say to you that supporting the President under
present circumstances is not ârotâ unless loyalty to oneâs
country is also ârotâ! Upholding the President under present
circumstances does not mean the upholding of an individual
in his opinion or judgment. For a Senator or a citizen of

Pg 406

the United States to back the President and to accept his
conclusions based upon known facts in foreign matters of
gravest importance at a time of the nationâs peril like this
is not a servile following of an individual and is not ârot.â
On the contrary such backing and such acceptance is only
supporting and maintaining oneâs government. It is evidence
of loyalty to oneâs country. Such action and such acceptance
is not merely supporting President Wilson as a
man, it is supporting the United States—our government—our
country, which the President for the time being represents
and for which he is authorized to act and must act.

I quote further from your letter: âOur slogan is 'America
first, last, and all the time, regardless of party lines, President,
or representatives.ââ Our President for the time being
within certain limitations is America and he acts for America.
And in my judgment it is the first duty not only of Senators
but of citizens who are for
America
first, last, and all the
time, to be for our
government
first, last, and all the time
that for the time being is our government.
No citizen can be
against
our government and still at the same time justly
claim that he is
for America
. One cannot be for and against
the same thing at the same time.

Now there is another matter in relation to the Beaver Dam
letter of Jan. 27 which was a communication entitled from
the âpastors of the German Lutheran Church in Conference
at Beaver Dam,
Wis.
, Assembled.â It appears from this
letter that you have assumed to put your church on record
as opposed to the foreign policy of this government at a time
when it was essential that the government should have the
united support of its citizens and to make public your disapproval
in your pastoral capacity, evidently for the purpose
of bringing the President and the representative of your
state into political disfavor with your church.

Now what I have to say in this connection is said in all
friendliness to the members of the Conference, many of whom
I personally know and respect. I acknowledge the right of
any man, no matter what his profession or calling may be, to
speak his mind freely on political matters and to vote as he
pleases at elections and consequently every pastor has a right
to express his own personal opinions on any subject that he

Pg 407

may desire to speak upon and, furthermore, he has a right to
express his own opinion without in any way injecting religion
into politics so long as he merely expresses his own personal
opinion and does not attempt to talk for his church or for the
purpose, as pastor, of influencing the people of his church.
I wish, however, to express my opinion that no matter what
the merit or excellence of their motives or principles that
may underlie such organizations or their actions, it will be an
unhappy and unfortunate thing for the country and for the
church when churches will be used as political organizations
or utilities and when its pastors will become the heads of such
organizations.

This country is and has been the refuge and the shield
of all men who desire to worship God as they please. This
is a country of freedom of religion as well as freedom of
thought. We have been endeavoring for more than a century
to keep our government and our politics divorced from religion.
We have been endeavoring to permit these to run
along parallel lines but at the same time to keep them separated
and prevent them from impinging one upon the other.
The separation of Church and State has been one of the keynotes
in our arch and has thus far done much to strengthen
and sustain our national structure. But in the last few years
there has been a growing tendency to inject religion into
politics. I have always steadfastly and consistently discouraged
and criticized such tendency wherever I could. I
consider it a most dangerous tendency—a tendency which
bodes no good either to the nation or to the church. It is
bad indeed to inject the
Church into Politics
. It is as bad or
worse to inject
Politics into the Church
. If you inject the

Church into Politics
you will brush aside the traditions of
our country since its existence and you will be laying the axe
to the very roots of our government. And if you inject

Politics into the Church
you will also be laying the axe to
the very roots of your religion. You cannot have politics
in your church without having
factions
in your
church
and
when you have
factions
in your
church
you will
divide
your

church
, which history shows has ever been the case when
governments and churches mixed. Our Revolutionary fathers
wisely profited by the experience of other nations and

Pg 408

by the teachings of history when they provided that the State
and Church should be forever kept separate. All good citizens
will deplore anything that endangers our country; and
all good people, regardless of religion, will deplore anything
that will injure the Church—an institution [which] when
properly separated from the government exercises an infinite
influence for good in this country. For these reasons I hereby
respectfully record my deep regret at the action of the
Beaver Dam Conference because I fear that you may be setting
an unwise precedent fraught with consequences of a
dangerous character both to the Church and to the State in
thus, as pastors, using the influence of your church in the
manner attempted.

One thing to me seems certain; if we desire to continue
the freedom of religion in our country, it can only be done
by keeping it free from politics and if we are going to have
freedom of politics it can only be done by keeping it free
from religious interference. The one proposition is interdependent
upon the other and the rule cannot be violated
without lasting injury and damage to both Church and State.
I trust that the great Lutheran Church and all of the other
great churches of the country will never put themselves into
the attitude of attempting to control the politics of the country.
I most fervently hope that religious and racial influence
and prejudices may never be permitted by any church or body
of men to promote or prevent the election of any man to
public office or to dictate to or to influence our government
in its relations or negotiations with foreign nations.

Let me conclude by saying that in all of these troublous
times we should remember that we are at peace—that we
have been kept out of this war thus far by a president and
an administration which have dedicated their efforts to promote
the public welfare—that they are doing the very best
they can to continue to keep us out of war if this can be done
without loss of national honor or without surrendering or
abandoning our national rights or the rights of our citizens.
In this effort, the government should be sustained by all
good citizens, regardless of race or religion. It is the duty
of every citizen to sustain it! This is
the
country in which
all our interests are centered—the only country to which we

Pg 409

owe any loyalty or allegiance—the country which safeguards
and protects us—the country which we in return are bound
to protect and defend always. It is easy, of course, to be a
good citizen in fair weather but it is in foul weather that the
best citizenship is needed. It is in the storm and stress of
national peril that loyalty and devotion to the public welfare
is put to the acid test. Let us lay aside all of our differences,
all of our sympathies, all of our prejudices, so far as they
relate to other countries, and let us think and speak and act
solely with regard to the good of our own country.

Very respectfully,

Paul O. Husting.

May 19, 1917.

Mr. —— ——,

————, Wisconsin.

My dear Sir:

Yours of May 16th was duly received and contents noted.
In reply I want to say that your letter bears evidence of
conscientious thought and your conclusions are, no doubt,
honest. I assume you have written me not only for the
purpose of giving your own views but also are inviting mine
in return. And inasmuch as you have volunteered a doubt
as to whether or not your German ancestry has colored or
biased your judgment in the premises, I take the liberty of
giving you my judgment on that point as I gather it from the
context of this and your previous letter.

I believe your reasonings and your conclusions are from
the German, not the American, standpoint. In other words,
you are holding a brief for Germany and not for the United
States. âHow important a partâ your âGerman ancestry
playsâ in this, it may be difficult for you to apprehend but
your bias will readily be apparent to anyone who reads your
letter. Now, you are an American-born citizen, I take it.
You are an attorney-at-law and a member of the bar of
Wisconsin. You owe a duty to your country which sympathy
for Germany, no matter how genuine it may be, cannot
diminish, much less nullify. Now the premises from which
you as an American must reason are these: This country
is at war with Germany. Your President, my President, our
President, backed by a declaration of your Congress, my

Pg 410

Congress, our Congress, has proclaimed that war exists. This
was done for reasons which appeared sufficient to the President
and the Congress to make this declaration imperative.
The loyalty and the fidelity of the President and of Congress
to the people of the nation has never been questioned or
challenged and I do not understand you to challenge or question
them now. You are merely attempting in your letter
to set your judgment against theirs. Germany is now an
enemy of the United States which means that she is your
enemy, my enemy, our enemy. Now, it is plain, as the Vice
President remarked in a speech some time ago, that we cannot
have a hundred million presidents or secretaries of state,
meaning, of course, that we can only have one of each at a
time and that when these officers, to whom this power has
been delegated, have, with the aid of Congress, committed
this government to a war, that question to all intents and
purposes of the war is settled for all men who are citizens of
the United States. And when the status of our relations
with a foreign country is once fixed as that of war, then
the time for argument has ceased and there is no longer any
room for controversy between citizens upon that question.
The question then, for the time being, that is to say, during
the pendency of the war, is a closed and not an open one.
And for the sake of your peace of mind as well as in justice
to yourself as an American citizen who does not desire his
loyalty questioned or to have his honorable reputation permanently
impaired, you should respect, obey, and support
the mandate of your country in the spirit of true and devoted
American citizenship.

Now, I assume you love this country and that you love it
because it is a free country and that you are here practicing
your profession because of your desire to live in and to practice
law in a country where fullest and freest opportunity is afforded
you to work out your own destiny in your own way.
In short, I assume that you favor a republican form of government
and that you are devoted to America and its free institutions.
I am sure that you would not have anyone believe
otherwise of you because that would impute to you disloyalty
and moreover it would impute to you a lack of intelligent
enterprise by your remaining in a country that according to

Pg 411

your ideas is improperly governed instead of removing yourself
to the jurisdiction of another country which more nearly
squares with your ideas of good government. So, I repeat
that I assume that you are here because you like to be here
under a government that suits you and which you love better
than any other government on earth. Now, it is evident in
your letter that you love and sympathize with Germany but
the question arises in my mind whether your love is for the
German people or for the German government. You can
easily put yourself to the test. If you love the German people
then you must desire them to have as good a government as
you enjoy here and it ought to make you happy that your
country, if it prevails in this war, will make the German
people as free and as happy as you are. If, on the other hand,
you are mostly concerned in the success of the German
government, that is to say, if you are mostly concerned in
having the present Hohenzollern dynasty remain in power,
then it would seem to be quite clear that your love is not for
the German people but for the Hohenzollern dynasty and
the German autocracy. In other words, your love would
then be of the form and not of the substance. You cannot
love this country and its institutions and at the same time love
the German autocracy. These are incompatible and repugnant
one to the other. They cannot both exist in the same
heart at the same time. Your love for the German people,
as is your love of mankind generally, is entirely compatible
with your love of this country but it must be clear to you, as
it must be perfectly clear to every American, that you cannot
love your country and the German people and mankind
generally and at the same time love the fearful German
autocracy which is trying to impose or impress its system, its
frightfulness, and its wish and will upon the world and which
in its mad lust for power silences the promptings of conscience,
scoffs at the weakness of love for human-kind, deafens
its ears to the dictates of humanity, and which in pursuit of its
fell purpose sets at naught all law human and divine. Now
let me ask you to search your heart and see whether your
love for the German fatherland is a love compatible with your
duties as an American citizen—whether it is compatible with
your love of liberty and humanity—whether it is compatible

Pg 412

with the principles enunciated in the Declaration of Independence
that all men are entitled to the right of âlife, liberty
and the pursuit of happinessâ! If such love is compatible
with all these then your love for the German fatherland is
a virtue and not a vice. But, if searching deeply into your
heart you find that your love of the fatherland means that
you love the relentless, ruthless, and despotic Hohenzollern
dynasty and its system, pluck it out as you would a cancer,
for it is a thing of evil and you cannot love it and be a good
and true American.

You write âThe Presidentâs statement to the effect that
the War is not directed against the German people never
appealed to me.â For the reasons I have just given it should
appeal to you as an American and as a lover of liberty and
it should appeal to the German people themselves and their
sympathizers in this country. It should appeal to lovers of
liberty the world over—this statement that we are warring on
a Power and not a People. We are warring on the Power
because it has set its hand and might against the world and
setting aside all laws of God and man it has outlawed itself
and has no right to live. But in destroying this Power there
is no intent, or disposition, or wish to destroy the People. The
Presidentâs statement means, as I interpret it, that the one
thing that stands between peace and war with Germany is
the Hohenzollern dynasty. Once let that obstacle be removed
either by the German people themselves or by the arbitrament
of arms and our troubles and differences with Germany
are over. Now can an American citizen of German extraction
who puts the welfare and happiness of the people of
Germany ahead of that of the Kaiser or, in other words,
ahead of the Hohenzollern dynasty and the autocratic system
which that dynasty embodies and typifies, enlist himself, his
sympathies, his resources, his life, in a higher and holier cause
than to join in emancipating the German people from the
thrall of the Hohenzollern dynasty and to save the German
people whom he professes to love from a doom which an outraged
world has pronounced and sealed against the ruthless
and frightful Hohenzollern system? Now and here is the
opportunity for all who love the German people to give
proof of it. Let them all get back of the President and of

Pg 413

their government and to the extent of their influence, ability,
might, and power help to bring to their brothers in blood
across the sea that priceless boon of liberty and independence
which they or their ancestors sailed the perilous seas to find
here in America. Let them make sacrifice and help and fight
to give to their friends and kinsmen across the ocean that
which was given to most of them here without cost or sacrifice
on their part.

It is quite apparent to almost everyone that there can
be no peace—no permanent peace—in the world so long as
one power seeks to impose its autocratic straight jacket upon
the world. Since the birth of the American Republic, the
world has been marching away from autocracy and toward
universal democracy, gathering irresistible momentum with
the advance of time. All rulers, all statesmen, all men recognize
this fact.

Even in countries autocratically ruled greater liberties
and rights have been accorded the common people and it is
only a question of time when the doctrine of the divinity of
kings will become a tradition and the world will become one
vast democracy. I repeat that the world is turning with
irresistible momentum to a world democracy and the rulers
of the world recognize that the logic of events is bound to
substitute governments âof, by and for the peopleâ in place
of âof, by and forâ kaisers, czars, and kings. There is practically
one autocracy in the world which still has the power
and efficiency to make that power felt in its attempt, its
will and purpose upon the world; but one power on earth
that today constitutes a menace and obstruction to the onward
tread of democracy and that power is Germany! It
is the Hohenzollern dynasty which is illogically, in indifference
and contempt of the worldâs sentiment, ignoring the
teachings of history, unheeding the warnings of history with
that fatuousness which always blinds the eyes of those who
look only for their self-aggrandizement, that is trying to
turn the world backward. It is the Hohenzollern dynasty
that has thrown itself in the path of the onward march of
liberty and progress, trying not only to stem the irresistible
physical and spiritual forces of the world but actually trying
to rout and drive them back into the dark ages of despotism.

Pg 414

It must be obvious to every thinking man that this
attempt will fail. No man or set of men in this day or age
will be permitted to rule the world. Every ruler, every
dynasty which unyieldingly places itself in the pathway of
liberty and progress will be overthrown; every people, no
matter how powerful or great, which blindly and absolutely
places itself behind, follows, and clings to such ruler and
dynasty, will inevitably sooner or later be crushed and utterly
destroyed with it. And so the German autocracy which today
menaces the world and obstructs its progress will be overthrown
and the German people if they continue blindly and
absolutely to cling to their dynasty will inevitably share the
same fate. Whether Germany prevails in this war or not,
there will be and can be no lasting peace until the inevitable
end is reached. So that in the end, be it sooner or later,
democracy will be established and autocracy will perish. The
destruction of the autocratic Hohenzollern dynasty would
be a blessing to the world. The destruction of the German
people would be a calamity to the world. I do not believe
that the German people are going to commit national suicide.
I do not believe that they are long going to continue to
sacrifice the substance for the form. I do not believe that
they will deem it wise to suffer a national death in order to
uphold the life of a government that is based on error, not
on truth, which the world tried and found wanting, and which
is responsible for the catastrophe which has befallen themselves
and the world at large. It is unthinkable—it is unbelievable—that
the German people are unaffected by the
onward movement of democracy and that they alone will
continue to hug the despotism and the system that is unsuited
to the requirements and unworthy of a modern civilization.
Wherefore, it would seem clear to me that all citizens of
German extraction would be quick to realize and appreciate
the force of the Presidentâs declaration that we are not warring
against the German people but against the German
autocracy and would enthusiastically support their own
government in a purpose which means freedom to the German
people, and in thus giving their whole hearted support to
their own government they would be discharging their duty,
they would be true to their allegiance as American citizens,

Pg 415

and at the same time they would be furthering the best interests
of the German people and aiding them in the only way
in which they properly can.

I have received a number of letters of the same purport
as yours and I am going to publish my letter to you so that
it may serve as an answer likewise to others who are minded
as you are. I know that there are in our midst a number of
serious, well-meaning men who hold the ideas and sentiments
which you have expressed—sentiments which, it is perfectly
clear, are incompatible with the duties and responsibilities
of American citizenship in a crisis like this as well as incompatible
with the intelligence and the character of the men
entertaining them. In the various public speeches I have
made and communications I have published during this crisis,
I have sought to speak only in the furtherance of what I
understand and conceive to be the truth of the matter and
the welfare of our country. I have been animated solely
by a purpose to dispel error and to promote the interests of
our country and not by the slightest ill-feeling or malice
toward any man. I have sought to express myself frankly
and without reserve but, at the same time, I hope fairly,
courteously, and without malice or feeling. Having lived
amongst Americans of German extraction all my life and
counting amongst them many of my best and dearest friends,
I believe that I know their processes of thought, their sentiments,
their prejudices, and their intelligence. I know that
they would not prefer to remain in error if once convinced
that they are in error. They do not want to be deceived.
They do not want to be flattered into silence or apparent
conviction. They like to hear straight, plain, blunt talk.
Loving law and order and respecting authority, as I know
they do, I have always believed that the great mass of our
citizens of German extraction would never permit themselves
to be placed in an attitude of hostility to the orderly
and just administration of the law or permit their loyalty or
fidelity to be suspected or challenged. I know that when once
convinced they are quick to abandon a position once they see
that it is untenable.

And so I have written this letter in the hope that I might
be instrumental in showing you that your position is untenable

Pg 416

and in the hope that you will abandon it for one which
will reflect credit on your patriotism, your judgment, and
your citizenship and which at the same time will afford you
the best opportunity for advancing the interests and welfare
of your kinsmen across the sea.

Very truly yours,

Paul O. Husting.

HISTORICAL FRAGMENTS

THE BEGINNINGS OF MILWAUKEE

Mr. B. F. Williams, of the firm of Williams and Stern, lawyers,
of Milwaukee, visited the Historical Library in January in search
of material concerning the building of the first courthouse in Milwaukee,
to be used in an injunction suit to prevent the removal of
the Milwaukee County Courthouse from its present site. A member
of the Library staff assisted him in his work, and found among the
Societyâs manuscripts and pamphlets much material concerning the
first days of American occupation in Milwaukee. The village of
Milwaukee (east side) was organized in September, 1835, with
Solomon Juneau as president; the village of Kilbourntown (Milwaukee
west side) was organized about the same time with Byron
Kilbourn as president. In January, 1838, the two villages were
united by an act of the Wisconsin territorial legislature.

Morgan L. Martin, of Green Bay, was the real founder of Milwaukee.
In 1833 he noted the advantages of the site for a harbor,
and secured from Lewis Cass, secretary of war, an order for its
survey. Meantime Martin made a proposition to Juneau, the only
settler on the site, to take an undivided half of his claim, Juneau
promising not to sell any of his share without Martinâs consent.
Martin in this transaction evinced both wisdom and generosity—generosity
in giving Juneau a chance to share the profits of the
enterprise (for many men would have bought his claim outright for
a small sum); wisdom in binding Juneau not to dispose of his share
without advice. The result proved the value of Martinâs foresight.
In 1834 the preÃ«mption act made Juneauâs claim substantial. About
this time Martin bought the preÃ«mption right of Peter Juneau, which
lay south of Solomonâs claim. The Michigan legislature, of which
Martin was a member, erected Milwaukee County in 1834, and in
1835 organized the same, with the county seat at the village of
Milwaukee.

In the meanwhile during 1834 many Americans visited the site
of the future city and saw its possibilities for growth. Among these
was Byron Kilbourn who secured a claim to the west side of Milwaukee

Pg 418

River. Martin and Juneau, early in 1835, proposed to Kilbourn
to unite their interests. Kilbourn ignored this offer, and proceeded
to develop his town alone. Meanwhile both town sites were surveyed
and their plats put on record. Martin and Juneau began to develop
their property, by opening and grading streets. One block in the
heart of the town was set aside for the courthouse, and nearly $12,000
(a large sum for that time) was spent in erecting a suitable building.
The ground around the new public building was given to the village
in perpetuity, for the use of the county courts.

A large number of letters from Juneau to Martin are in the
possession of the State Historical Society, and are interesting as
revealing the growth of the village, and the personality of its proprietors.
Although Martin and Juneau had transactions involving
many thousands of dollars, there never was any disagreement between
them. Neither did they have a written contract, each one
relying upon the honor of the other. And when hard times fell upon
the little settlement in 1837 and later, each partner bore his share
of misfortune cheerfully and without a word of accusation or disagreement.
Even after the union of Milwaukee village and Kilbourntown
in 1838, a considerable rivalry was maintained between the
two parts of the town, which in some measure has persisted to the
present day.

THE SENATORIAL ELECTION OF 1869

In 1869 Wisconsin elected a new senator to represent her in
Congress. It was conceded on every hand that James R. Doolittle,
whose term expired March 4, 1869, had misrepresented the stateâs
sentiment in his support of President Johnson during the impeachment
trial, and that he had no chance of reÃ«lection. This situation
brought out a number of candidates, most of whom were ânewâ men.
Among the tried and true candidates the most prominent were Cadwallader
C. Washburn, then congressman for the southwestern section
of the state, and Horace Rublee, vigorous editor of the chief
Republican newspaper at Madison. Ex-Governor Salomon was also
in the field, but his candidacy was not taken very seriously. The
new men who were most prominently talked of were Otis H. Waldo

Pg 419

and Matt H. Carpenter, both of them Milwaukee lawyers. Waldo
was the elder of the two, a man of ability and power, and a Republican
from the foundation of the party. Carpenter was of Democratic
antecedents, a recent adherent of the reigning party. His
strength lay in his brilliant oratory, keen wit, and deep knowledge of
men. Erratic in his methods, but meteoric in his cleverness, he persuaded
and enthralled his hearers when opportunity was afforded
him for speech. Carpenter had made a national reputation by his
arguments in the Supreme Court on the Reconstruction issue. The
president-elect, General Grant, and his advisers were favorable to
Carpenterâs candidacy, which gave the Milwaukee lawyer a strong
endorsement with Wisconsin Republicans.

The senatorial campaign opened in June, and largely governed
the elections for the ensuing Wisconsin legislature. By December
the situation had become acute, and all parties were lined up for the
contest. The preferences of every legislator-elect were canvassed
and recanvassed; and each candidate presented his claims and qualifications
to the prominent members of the coming legislature in personal
letters. The State Historical Society has recently received
a gift of a few letters relating to this campaign addressed to the
Honorable Andrew Jackson Turner, of Portage, then an influential
figure in Wisconsin politics. Three of these letters, written in the
early winter of 1868-69, are from Carpenter, who bespeaks Turnerâs
support at the coming legislative session. Turner, however, had
given his pledge to Horace Rublee, and had been by him chosen
manager of his campaign. December 9, 1868, Carpenter wrote to
Turner from Washington: âI rec
d
your favor just as I was leaving
home, postponing me in your affections to Mr. Rublee. But I think
this will make no difference. I am sure the conflict will be between
Mr. Washburn and myself & that he will be elected, if I am not.
You say that you shall support me next to Rublee, and I desire to
thank you for this.â

The most interesting letter of the lot is that of Rublee himself,
written November 23, 1868. In it he canvasses the entire legislative
personnel, telling of the predilections of each member and concluding:
âIn my judgement Carpenter cannot be elected, & I certainly
think he ought not to be elected.â

Pg 420

As all the world knows, Rublee was wrong. During the legislative
session, Carpenterâs manager arranged a public meeting in
which all the candidates were to set forth their views on the questions
of the day. This meeting was contemptuously dubbed by Rublee
âA Spelling-downâ; none the less, neither he nor any other of the
candidates dared refuse the invitation to speak. Carpenterâs great
powers as an orator stood him in good stead, and at the Republican
caucus held soon after the speech-making contest, he was triumphantly
nominated, and elected, in due course, by the Republican
majority in the state legislature.

The intimate picture these old letters afford of the log-rolling
days before the direct election of the senators by the people, gives
them historical value for students of political methods, and lays bare
the reasons that induced the modern revolt against âmachine-madeâ
representatives in the upper house of Congress.

âKOSHKONONGâ AND âMAN EATERâ

Lake Koshkonong is one of the most beautiful sheets of water
in Wisconsin. In primitive times the region adjacent to it must
have constituted a perfect paradise for the red man. Even yet,
notwithstanding its settlement by whites for nearly three generations,
this is one of the favorite resorts of Wisconsin sportsmen.
The Indian name âKoshkonongâ has usually been explained as meaning
âthe lake we live on.â
[132]
The letter which follows, recently presented
to the State Historical Society by H. L. Skavlem, of
Janesville, offers both a new rendering of the Indian name and a new
interpretation of it. No less interesting to those who care for Wisconsinâs
primitive history is the new rendition offered of the name
of Man Eater, the Rock River chief who dwelt on the shore of Lake
Koshkonong a century ago. Mrs. Kinzie, the author of
Wau Bun
,
saw Man Eater or âMee-chee-taiâ on at least two occasions. Over
against the sad picture which Peter Vieau paints should be set her

Pg 421

description of him as âa most noble Indian in appearance and
character.â

Portage, Sept. 2, 1900.

Mr. Buckley, Attorney,
Beloit,
Wis.

Dear Sir:

Having forgotten your initials I am compelled to address you as above.

Some months ago you wrote me concerning âMan Eaterâsâ village
and why he was called âMan Eater.â I had no knowledge of the origin
of his name, but the location of his village was easily ascertainable. Your
inquiry aroused a desire to know more of the famous old Indian and I
have made many inquiries myself, but without results, until the thought
occurred to me to address a note to the venerable Peter J. Vieau, of
Muskego, which I did through Mr. D. M. Fowler, of Milwaukee. I copy
from Mr. V.âs reply, through an amanuensis:

âI never knew a lake of that name 'Kosh-ko-nongâ but I know 'Kosh-kau-no-nong,â
meaning termination of a lake or river, a dam or any obstruction
making an ending, a stop, an absolute end.

âWell, then, I never knew a chief of that
name
, but I knew one
of the name of 'Mee-chee-tai.â He was not a full-blooded chief, but was
considered as one among the Indian tribe. He was half Winnebago
and Pottowatomie. He was a powerful man and a terror among the
tribe. He was looked upon as a sorcerer, and lived at that time as I
recollect in the neighborhood of Kosh-kau-no-nong. He used to do his
trading with Jacques Vieau, my father, when my father opened his trading
post in Milwaukee as early as 1795. It must be the same man Mr.
Turner refers to 'Mee-chee-taiâ; it means 'Heart-Eater.â Now then the
above statement can be substantiated by my sister, Mrs. May Vieau
Lavigne, visiting with me at present. She knew him well, too.

â'Mee-chee-taiâ was killed by his son in a drunken frolic about the
time of the speculation in Milwaukee in '35 or '36. He killed his wife and
his son 'Shaw-gun-oshâ tried to save his mother, and killed the old man
his father, and that ended his fearful career. He was considered a
good Indian when sober. Father used to think much of him. He was
honest in his dealings. He was a great juggler, performed great tricks,

&c.

Yours P. J. V.â

Did you ever see any reference to this Indian in any place other
than âWau-Bunâ?

Very respectfully,

A. J. Turner.

THE ALIEN SUFFRAGE PROVISION IN THE CONSTITUTION
OF WISCONSIN
[133]

According to the organic law of Wisconsin Territory, enacted
by Congress in erecting the territory in 1836, only citizens of the
United States were eligible to the franchise (section V, proviso).
About the year 1840, immigrants from Germany, the British Isles,
and Norway became an appreciable factor in the population of the
territory; but the naturalization law requiring a five yearsâ residence
disfranchised this large group of settlers. The situation grew tense
by 1843, especially since the question of statehood was being discussed,
and seemed likely to come to a head in 1844. Moreover, the
matter was complicated by the Native-American agitation throughout
the country. Many openly advocated a twenty-one year provision
for naturalization, and Wisconsinâs foreigners grew restive
under this possibility.

It seemed quite certain that the Wisconsin legislature of 1844
would pass a law providing for a referendum on the subject of statehood.
In December, 1843, a large public meeting of German citizens
was called at Milwaukee who drew up a petition for the right to
participate in this referendum. This was signed by 1,200 persons,
and was probably the largest petition ever presented to the territorial
legislature. It became impossible to ignore the demand of the
foreign settlers. The Whig and Democratic parties were struggling
for the control of the territorial offices. Wisconsin was normally
Democratic by an overwhelming majority, but the Tyler administration
had appointed a Whig governor, and patronage went with the
administration. The Whigs were accused of alliance with nativism;
it therefore became them to prove the falsity of the charge. The
Democrats felt certain of the foreign vote. The legislature, therefore,
on January 22, 1844, passed âAn Act in relation to the qualification
of voters for state government and for the election of delegates
to form a state constitution,â which provided that âall free white
male inhabitants above the age of 21 years, who have resided in said
territory three months shall be deemed qualified, and shall be permitted
to vote on said questionâ and for delegates to a convention
to frame a constitution.

Pg 423

The referendum vote which was taken in September, 1844, proved
adverse to the question of a state government. There is no means
of ascertaining how many foreigners voted upon the question, but
the entire vote was very light, and the alien voters seem not to have
influenced the decision, which was anticipated by all parties in the
territory.

About the same time the territorial legislature passed the act
above referred to, General Henry Dodge, Wisconsinâs territorial
delegate in Congress, presented to that body a petition signed by
300 citizens in the western part of the territory praying for a repeal
of the proviso in the fifth section of the organic law of Wisconsin,
and for the passage of a law granting suffrage to every free white
male inhabitant of the age of twenty-one years within the territory,
foreigners included. This is the petition referred to by G. F.
Franklin in his
Legislative History of Naturalization
. The names
of the signers of the petition are not available. We conjecture that
they were those of the Cornish miners of that region, rather than of
the American settlers, because in after debates, the southwest section
of the state opposed the law allowing aliens to vote.

The law of 1844 was at once attacked, and was made the basis
of an attempt to defeat several prominent members of the legislature
who had voted for it. This was especially true in the northeast section
where the reÃ«lection of Dr. Mason C. Darling, a prominent
Democrat, was opposed because of his advocacy of the alien voting
law. It was claimed that the law was unconstitutional, violating both
the Constitution of the United States and the organic law of the
territory. Dr. Darling came out with several long addresses on the
subject, basing the right of aliens to vote on the twelfth article of
the Ordinance of 1787, and on the inherent right of a sovereign state
to form its constitution as it thought best.

Dr. Darling was reÃ«lected, but the legislature of 1845 had hardly
begun its session when a determined effort was made to repeal the
law of the previous session. In the course of the debates Dr. Darling
offered a clause on the declaration of intention as an amendment,
and another member amended the three months to six months. Both
of these changes were accepted by the friends of the bill as compromise
measures to mitigate the opposition. Dr. Darling said in

Pg 424

his argument that he considered the intention declaration as of no
consequence, except as an evidence of actual settlement. This compromise
saved the bill, and the amended act, approved February 8,
1845, reads: âNo person shall hereafter vote upon the subject of
state government, or for delegates to form a state constitution, who
shall not have resided six months within the Territory, and as an
additional qualification shall be a citizen of the United States, or
shall have declared his intention to become such; as the law requires.â

Thus the matter rested until the legislature of 1846 arranged
again to submit the question of a state government to the people.
An attempt was made by the Whig party to amend the law of 1845
and allow only citizens to vote. The suffrage provision was complicated
by differences concerning negro, half-breed, and Indian suffrage.
On the test vote the law of 1845 was maintained by the
strong majority of 19 to 7, nearly all the Democrats voting in its
favor.

The constitutional convention met in October, 1846, and the
question of alien suffrage was much debated. Upon the ground that
the acts of 1844 and 1845 were both unconstitutional, petitions
poured in, especially from the Southwest, to limit the franchise to
citizens of the United States. The foreigners also availed themselves
of the right of petition, and the able German delegates in the
convention created a favorable impression for alien suffrage. As
finally adopted, the article granted suffrage to one-year residents,
and âall white persons not citizens of the United States, who shall
have declared their intention to become such, in conformity with the
laws of Congress for the naturalization of aliens, and shall have taken
before any officer of this state * * * an oath to support the constitution
of the United States and of this state.â

The constitution of 1846 was rejected by the people. In the
discussion, then, of the provision for alien voters it played but a
small part. The friends of the constitution set forth its liberality
to foreigners and the fact that it acknowledged the equal rights
nature bestowed upon foreign and native-born citizens alike. Opponents
of the constitution set forth on the one hand the over-liberality
to the alien element, and on the other hand the requirement of an
additional oath as an illiberal burden to foreign residents.

Pg 425

In the constitutional convention of 1847-48 the subject of the
foreign franchise occupied a large share of the time of the delegates.
The delegates from the western counties came with a deliberate determination
to limit the franchise to citizens of the United States. The
admission of foreigners to suffrage placed the West in a permanent
minority, as the lake-board and middle sections of the territory had
the bulk of the immigrant population.

The original proposition as brought in by the committee restored
the residence requirement to six months, retained the intention
of citizenship clause, and omitted the special oath. The examples
of New York, Ohio, and Illinois were cited. One member urged
that the one-year requirement was necessary in New York to ascertain
the permanent character of the residence, while all who came
to Wisconsin came for permanent homes and six months was long
enough to prove residence. The effect of the shorter period would
be to encourage foreigners to file their intentions sooner. It was
admitted that the six-months provision was carried in committee
by a very narrow majority.

The attack on the article on alien suffrage was begun by an
amendment to limit suffrage to citizens. It was alleged that the
article as reported by the committee was unconstitutional and would
cause Congress to reject the constitution. In reply the similar provisions
in the constitutions of Ohio and Illinois were cited. The new
constitution of Illinois was cited by both parties to the controversy;
one claiming the change had occurred because of dissatisfaction with
the more liberal provision; the other that Illinoisâ new constitution
had not yet been acted upon. Charges were freely made of demagoguery—that
the Democrats were toadying to the foreign vote.
In reply, the Democrats appealed to the liberality and progressiveness
of their party policies, and declared that the aliens, being taxed,
were entitled to vote. The citizen amendment was defeated by a vote
of 53 to 16; and the suffrage article as originally reported by the
committee was incorporated into the constitution. With the amendments
required by the amendments to the Constitution of the United
States, the provision was part of the organic law of Wisconsin
until 1912.

EDITORIAL

INCREASE A. LAPHAM AND THE GERMAN AIR RAIDS

The reader may well be excused if at first sight he is
puzzled over our title. What possible connection can there
be between the simple Wisconsin scholar, whose life of busy
service for the betterment of humanity terminated almost
half a century ago, and the baby-killing air raids upon London
and other English cities with which the soldiers of
Emperor William are accustomed to divert themselves?

Gentle reader, we propose to show you. Increase A.
Lapham delved in many fields of learning, but chiefly he was
a scientist and perhaps his greatest single achievement was
his practical conquest of the secret of foretelling the weather.
Now we learn, on the authority of the London
Illustrated
News
, that the imperial German government has utilized
Laphamâs discovery to insure the success (or at least to
minimize the danger) of its air raids on London. âWhen
the east wind blows beware of air raids.â Thus might a
modernized English edition of
Poor Richardâs Almanac
read.
Also, âWhen the night is moonlight, beware of air raids,â
but frequently moonlight nights are enjoyed sans the nocturnal
visitants. The twofold explanation is that the air
raiders must have clear weather and it is desirable if not essential
that they have the wind behind them on the outward raid
and in their faces on the return journey, rather than vice
versa. The Germans have control of Europe from the North
Sea far into Russia and so it is possible for their meteorological
observation posts to give warning for something like
twelve hours in advance of any change in weather conditions
coming down behind an east wind. As long, therefore,
as there is a steady wind across Europe anywhere between
northeast and southeast those in charge of the raiding squadrons
in Belgium have full warning of what the weather is

Pg 427

going to be like. Accordingly the fiendish flying brood can
be sent forth in confident assurance that neither its arrival
at its destination nor its return to the home station will be
frustrated by stormy weather.

Increase Lapham labored for years to promote his great
discovery because he had a vision of the service it would be
to mankind. One of his most striking arguments for enlisting
community action in the promotion of his work was a
calculation of the number of lives and of vessels which annually
would be saved from destruction on Lake Michigan
alone. Happily for him he did not live to witness the spectacle
of the worldâs most efficient government perverting his
great achievement to the promotion of the indiscriminate
slaughter of the men and women, the mothers and babies of
the worldâs greatest metropolis.

SAVE THE RELICS
[134]

The original of the letter written by Horace Greeley,
sometime near the middle of the sixties, in reply to the application
for advice of a discharged soldier boy, and in which
occurred the famous phrase, âGo west, young man, and grow
up with the country,â is supposed to have been destroyed,
with other valuable historic papers, in a recent fire in Youngstown,
Ohio.

It was superb advice profitably followed by thousands
of young men, sires and grandsires of millions of the finest
of western citizens of today.

But—Why was that historic document in private possession?
That was not at all fit wit for our Youngstown friend
to exhibit. In the safe custody of the Ohio Historical Society
that precious letter justly belonged, and there it would repose
securely now if prudence had but guided its owner.

Pg 428

Which raises the pertinent question—Have
you
an historical
souvenir that is being endangered while you neglect
to transfer it to the Wisconsin State Historical Society?
Wisconsin homes contain many mementoes that rightly belong
in the historical societyâs fireproof building.

Are
you
playing safe? Let us not expose the lack of
circumspection shown by the Youngstown antiquarian.
Besides—Ten thousand persons can enjoy relics in the historical
rooms where one does in a private home.

Therefore—Be warned!

THE NEWSPAPERS
[135]

It is the glory of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin
that Draper gathered into its collections the papers
of the Ohio Valley migrations, that Thwaites added the
records of the fur trade, and that neither forgot while pursuing
these remote and unique sources to assemble day after
day the current accumulations of the people among whom
they lived. As the latter collector and editor loved to say:
The history for tomorrow is preserved in the waste paper
baskets of today. The society that lays aside the policy of
accumulating accessions to devote itself to the conscious pursuit
of particular treasures can never become more useful
than its curators or wiser than its superintendent. The
greatest libraries are those whose growth has been chiefly
in the routine addition, from year to year of all that has been
regarded as worth saving, and of much more whose immediate
value has been doubtful.

The State Historical Society of Wisconsin has for so
many years followed the practice of saving its daily newspapers,
and adding to them as opportunity occurs, that it now
owns one of the notable American collections. From the
middle of the last century, when the state came into being,
the development of its people can be traced in the detail

Pg 429

which only the inquisitive county daily can follow. Its relations
to the Northwest and to the rest of the nation can be
checked in the selected files which have ever been cherished.
Through the wise foresight of its founders it owns the great
sources for all of modern history—for in our day the course
of the historian is more and more fundamentally laid among
the newspapers.

It has not been altogether easy to build up this collection.
A metropolitan daily of today means twelve large volumes
to be bound, shelved, and housed each year. The cubic contents
of the sources know no limit. There is some room for
fear that after they have been stored away they may rot in
their bindings before any scholar uses them.

But no society which understands the course of modern
history can fail to run the risk of dry-rot or to preserve such
records as exist. For no period before the present is there
such a factual reconstruction possible as we possess. No
newspaper can lie and live—very long. The user must correct
for bias, and careless error, and malicious misstatement,
all of which occur in nearly every issue of any paper. But
no student can read a continuous series of files for twenty
years without knowing that he has before him the truth, and
more of the truth than society has known in any earlier
period.

In our judgment one of the great functions of any historical
society today is to collect ephemeral literature, beginning
with the newspapers of its immediate region and extending
as far as its money and its shelves permit. No
Society should be too poor for the town dailies and one New
York file. Larger societies may take in the county, or the
region, as the area for their collections, and may increase the
selected list of remote journals to be preserved. All will be
judged in the future by the intelligence and patience in this
direction which their shelves may finally reveal. None can

Pg 430

be permanently of greatest use with a policy such as is exposed
in the journal of a sister society:

âThe State of * * * has thousands of them [newspapers]
in the Libraries of the State House. Many of them are
bound, others are unbound, tied in bundles and carefully
stowed away. Their day is done; rarely has any one in our
knowledge asked to examine any of these newspapers for
any date or facts. History has culled from them such truths
as could point a moral, or hold out a danger signal to the
world of the present time, and they are closed, perhaps never
more to be consulted.â

REMOVING THE PAPACY TO CHICAGO

Possession of the faith by which mountains are removed
is, we are inclined to think, the fundamental characteristic
of the American spirit. To the American all things are possible
because the true American takes it for granted that to
him nothing is impossible. The manifestation of this spirit
has its unpleasant—oftentimes its ridiculous—side, of course;
yet the possession of it has made possible the performance
here in the New World of miracles as astonishing as any set
forth in holy writ.

By popular consent the metropolis of our inland seas has
long since come to be regarded as perhaps the most striking
exponent, among cities, of the characteristic American spirit.
Throughout her history the supreme confidence of her citizens
in the cityâs present greatness and future development,
together with the will to transmute the prolific visions of her
leaders into present realities, has constituted her most valuable
civic asset. We have seen no better illustration of this
characteristic Chicago (and American) spirit than the one
contained in a story which William J. Onahan, a Chicago
Irishman of sixty-four yearsâ standing relates. Meeting Mr.
Armour on a street corner at a time when, because of political
turmoil in Italy there was talk of the Popeâs seeking an asylum

Pg 431

outside the peninsula, the two stopped to talk for a moment,
whereupon the captain of industry calmly proposed that the
papacy be brought to Chicago. Onahan undertook to explain
something of the magnitude of the Popeâs responsibilities,
and the impossibility of the proposed removal from
the Eternal to the Windy City, with the following result:

âMr. Armour listened patiently to my harangue on the
necessities of the Pope, and then proposed another conundrum
to me: 'How much would it take to provide all these
buildings?â

âI did not know; could not guess. Would it take ten
millions—twenty millions?

â'Look here,â he added, 'you undertake this affair. You
know how to manage these things. You get the Pope to
agree to come to Chicago. We can arrange and provide
everything suitable for his needs.â

â'Why, how on earth could you do these things?â I asked
in bewilderment.

â'Iâll tell you my idea,â he said. 'We will get a big tract
of land outside Chicago, ten or twenty thousand acres. We
will build necessary offices, a palace, a great Cathedral, whatever
may be necessary. Half that land set apart and turned
over to the Pope, donât you see that we will make enough
out of the other half to pay for the whole business?â

âI was dumfounded at the audacity of the idea, the ingenuity
and method of carrying it out, and the characteristic
Chicago aim—'thereâs money in it.â When, many years
afterwards I saw the wonderful 'White Cityâ—the Worldâs
Fair—its marvelous architectural beauty, the vastness and
symmetry of its buildings, the beauty of all the arrangements,
I said to myself, Chicago could indeed, if put to it,
build a new Eternal City.â

COMMUNICATIONS

âCAMOUFLAGEâ AND âEATLESS DAYSâ TWO HUNDRED
YEARS AGO

The war in Europe has revived, and brought into common use,
in all languages, the term âcamouflage,â denoting any contrivance
to hide or disguise by one side to deceive and confuse the enemy.
This term, if derived from the French
camouflet
, pronounced cam-u-flay,
appears in the
International Encyclopedia
and is defined as:
âA stinking compound in paper cases used in siege attacks to blow
into the faces of sappers and miners to confuse them.â The word
must have been buried, for I find no mention of it in any other encyclopÃ¦dia.
The use of the term in a wider sense appears in
The
Letters to Authors
, of Voltaire, dated 1730, where he savagely characterizes
a rival writer of that period thus in rhyme:

Rousseau sujet au Camouflet,

Fut autrefois chasse dit-on.

Du theatre Ã  coups de sifflet,

Du Paris Ã  coups de baton.

Chez les Germains chacun fait comme,

Il câest garanti du fagot.

Il a fait enfin le devot,

Ne pouvant faire lâhonnette homme.

There is no set of Voltaire in English in Monroe, hence I translate
without rhyme the French copy:

âRousseau because of
camouflet
,

Was sometimes chased they say

From the theaters with storms of hisses,

From Paris with blows of clubs.

By Germans, each one well knows,

He is guaranteed the fagot.

He could not be an honest man,

Therefore became religious.â

I find by the same author, under the title,
Misfortunes of
Charles I
:

âParliament ordered the public burning by the hangman of the
tract written by James the First wherein he states that it is proper
for people to have sport and amusements after divine service on
Sundays. The same parliament names one day each week as a day

Pg 433

of fasting and ordered that the value of the food thus saved be paid
to help defray the expense of the civil war then raging.â

DANIEL WEBSTERâS WISCONSIN INVESTMENTS

At the time of the appearance of the communications relating
to Websterâs western investments in the first and second numbers of
this magazine I chanced to see in the
Personal Recollections
of Robert
S. Rantoul (Cambridge, Mass., Privately Printed, 1916) a reference
to the same subject which seems worth calling to the attention of
those interested in western history.

The author of the
Recollections
says that the early death of his
father, Robert Rantoul, was in part due to the financial disaster
which overtook him—he died at forty-seven—and proceeds to explain
the circumstances. He had known that his father spent much time
in the Middle West between 1845 and 1850 and that he had a high
estimate of the economic and political possibilities of the upper
Mississippi Valley; but it was not until long after his fatherâs death
that he learned something of the speculations and reverses in that
region which hastened it.

The facts were as follows: Rantoul, Rufus Choate, and Caleb
Cushing were trustees in a scheme, in which Webster, Cass, and a
few others were also concerned, to get control of the headwaters of
the Mississippi, saw the lumber, and float it down to markets in the
rapidly growing cities and towns of the Middle West. Cass had
shown that such a plan was practicable; but the associates knew,
also, that there was mineral wealth in the region of Fort Snelling.
Indian implements of that vicinity were inlaid with lead and copper.
They had ill-timed, if not over-sanguine, hopes of great gain therefrom.
The trustees managed everything and issued stock certificates
in December, 1845. They had received a charter the preceding
August as the
St.
Croix and Lake Superior Mineral Company.
Nothing but trouble followed. After a dam had been built at
St.

Anthonyâs Falls their land titles were attacked and their logs were
carried away by a spring flood. Cushing, who was to have been

Pg 434

governor of the new territory, went to the Mexican War. Choate
was too absorbed in his profession and too indifferent to business
matters to pay attention to the management of the undertaking.
The whole burden fell upon Rantoul and was too great for him to
bear. After his death in 1852 Cushing gave some attention to the
business but Rantoulâs executors would not coÃ¶perate and his interest
in the project lapsed with loss of the money and labor which he had
devoted to the enterprise.

The son also remarks on the fact that his father was one of the
incorporators of the Illinois Central Railroad, wrote its charter, and
passed it through the legislature, where—as is well known—Abraham
Lincoln was the opposing counsel.

Yours truly,

Asa Currier Tilton.

Many interesting additions to the Libraryâs collection of non-current
newspaper files were made during the first quarter of 1918.
By far the most important is the
Illinois Intelligencer
, published at
Kaskaskia and (later) Vandalia, for the years 1817-31. This paper
was the first to be published in Illinois, its name in the beginning
being the
Illinois Herald
. Through the courtesy of the University
of Illinois Library our Society has been afforded the opportunity to
make a photostatic reproduction of the file for the fourteen years
included in the period noted. From the widow of the founder and
publisher,
Rev.
I. L. Hauser, has been received the file for the first
five years, 1869-74, of the Milwaukee
Index
, later and better known
as the
Christian Statesman
. Other Wisconsin files acquired include
the Algoma
Record
, 1910-18, and six issues (out of a total of ten
published) of the
Bugle Blast
, Lake Millsâ first newspaper. From
Minnesota has come a complete file of the short-lived Winona
Daily
News
, published from September 14 to October 7, 1916. Other files
from without the state include: Lawrenceburg
Indiana Palladium
,
April-December, 1825; Indianapolis
Locomotive
, 1850-52; Logansport

Journal
, April-December, 1864; Cincinnati
Brauerei Arbeiter
Zeitung
, 1910-17; Baltimore
Manufacturers Record
, 1916-18; New

Pg 436

York
Army and Navy Journal
, 1902-10; New York

1914-17; Tokyo
Japan Mail
, 1915-17.

Through the agency of the historical committee of the Congregational
Church in Wisconsin an important collection of yearbooks,
church periodicals, pamphlets, books, and other material on Congregationalism,
which had been gathered at the business headquarters
of the church in Madison, has been turned over to the State Historical
Society. Much of the collection thus received duplicates material
already owned by the Library; it will go in due time to swell the
resources of some sister institution which lacks and needs it. The
remainder constitutes a welcome addition to our own important collection
of material in the field of Congregational church history.
Thus another step is taken in the process of making the State Historical
Library the repository of all available material pertaining to
the history of the several religious denominations of Wisconsin. For
the latest acquisition particular obligation is acknowledged to
Rev.

John N. Davidson,
Rev.
S. T. Kidder, and
Rev.
Henry A. Miner,
Congregational ministers, all of Madison. Their active and intelligent
interest in making the sources of their denominational history
accessible to scholars is worthy of emulation. Who will be next to
âcome acrossâ on behalf of his own denomination?

Mrs. Anna Roberts Beagle, of Menomonie, has presented the
Society with three interesting family heirlooms. One is a Welsh
Bible brought to America in 1817 by her father, Richard Roberts,
who in later life was for many years a resident and justice of the
peace at Menomonie. Another is a sword carried by her fatherâs
brother, Daniel Roberts, in the War of 1812. The third is an English
hunting knife brought from England in 1817, which according
to the tradition of the family has been in its possession for many
generations.

*  *  *  *  *

From Fred M. Griswold of Lake Mills have been received six
issues of the Lake Mills
Bugle Blast
, publication of which as a
monthly was begun in December, 1863. Mr. Griswold states that the

Bugle Blast
was Lake Millsâ first paper, and that only ten issues were
published in all. It was a modest sheet, put out, apparently, in spare
time by the proprietor, who also played the rÃ´les of editor and devil
as well. The annual subscription price was twenty-five cents at first,
but before long the cost of materials compelled an increase to thirty
cents. The file which Mr. Griswold has presented constitutes an
interesting addition to the Societyâs collection of Wisconsin newspapers.

During the month of March, a special exhibit of Dutch war cartoons,
lent for the purpose by
Prof.
Arnold Dresden, was made in
the State Historical Museum. They accompanied the issues of the
newspaper
De Nieuwe Amsterdamer
, and are the work of the famous
Dutch cartoonists, P. Vanderham, Willy Sluiter, and Jan Sluyters.
The cartoons measure 12Â½ by 19 inches in size and nearly all of them
are printed in colors. They deal with such subjects as the German
war horrors, war conditions in Holland, the neutrals, and peace.
The most striking of the latter class is one in which the Angel of
Peace is seen stooping over the world, which, porcupine-like, is completely
covered with protruding bayonets. The translated inscription
reads: âI do not find a spot where I can take hold of him.â

*  *  *  *  *

The State Historical Museum, in order to complete certain of
its collections, is especially anxious to secure samples of the following
implements and utensils formerly in use in Wisconsin and other
states: A pomace knife, mead stick, hearth brush, wooden-toothed
rake, corn sheller, cheese tester, farrierâs shave, sheep yoke, goose
yoke, milking stool, wool comb, tape loom or heddle frame, rundlets,
wooden tankard, wooden dishes, stirring stick, butter molds, milk
skimmer, earthenware foot-warmer, magnifier of the kind formerly
placed in front of candles or sconces, fleam, wooden pitch pipe, and
a wooden prism.

Samples of early American china are also desired, pewter ware,
a hand lamp, minerâs lamp, tea canister, wooden sugar-box, butter
bowl, mush paddle, hickory hay fork, old hand-made keys, and old-style
door knocker. Gifts of such specimens will be greatly appreciated
and will assist the museum in its work with university students
and the public schools of the state.

*  *  *  *  *

In March, 1918, Magnus Swenson, chairman of the State Council
of Defense, appointed a War History Commission for Wisconsin,
and delegated to it the work of collecting for permanent preservation
all the material that can be obtained relating to our stateâs share in
the Great War. The plan is the outgrowth of steps taken early in
the war by the National Board for Historical Service in Washington
to make a complete and monumental collection of the material pertaining
to Americaâs part in this great struggle.

The commission consists of M. M. Quaife, Madison, chairman;
W. W. Bartlett, Eau Claire, C. R. Fish, Madison, J. H. A. Lacher,
Waukesha, W. N. Parker, Madison, A. H. Sanford, La Crosse, and
Captain H. A. Whipple, Waterloo. John W. Oliver, Madison, was
named director of the commission. At a meeting held in the office
of the Superintendent of the State Historical Society on March 8,
the commission decided to begin at once the work that had been

Pg 438

assigned. The State Historical Library in Madison was selected as
the headquarters for the commission, and from there the work is being
directed. Local war history committees have been appointed in every
county of the state, charged with the specific function of collecting
and preserving all the records relating to that particular countyâs
activity in the war. By coÃ¶perating with the county councils of
defense, the public libraries, the local historical societies, and the
schools, it is hoped that every record and news item possessing historical
value will be saved for the use of future workers in compiling
a final history of Wisconsinâs part in the war.

*  *  *  *  *

In line with the foregoing activity, a movement has been undertaken
by the University of Wisconsin and the State Historical Society,
working in conjunction, to develop at Madison a comprehensive
war collection, which shall adequately serve the needs of future
investigators. A special fund has been provided, deemed adequate
to the purpose in view, and Dr. Asa C. Tilton, a trained bibliographer
and historian, has been secured to serve as curator of the War Collection
and direct the work of collecting. The special drive for
historical materials thus put under way will be conducted in close
coÃ¶rdination with the ordinary work of the Historical Library and
the library and other departments of the University. As a result
of it, there should be developed at Madison such a comprehensive war
collection for the use of students and research workers as the New
York Public Library and one or two others are developing in the
East. As far as known, nowhere in the West, outside of Madison,
is such a collection being developed.

The forty-sixth annual meeting of the Outagamie County Pioneersâ
Association was held at Appleton the latter part of February.
A business program was held in the forenoon, a dinner at noon, and
a literary and musical program in the afternoon. Addresses were
given by Mayor Faville, Postmaster Keller, Judge Spencer, and
others. Throughout the addresses the patriotic note was dominant.

*  *  *  *  *

The forty-third annual meeting of the Reedsburg Old Settlersâ
Association was held February 15, 1918, under unfavorable weather
conditions. A picnic dinner was eaten, and a miscellaneous program
of songs, addresses, and instrumental music was given. The treasurerâs
report showed a balance on hand of $191. Officers elected
for the ensuing year were John P. Stone, president; C. M. Kester,
vice president; Elsie Root, secretary; F. M. Baker, treasurer.

*  *  *  *  *

On March 26, in the Kellogg Public Library, the Green Bay
Historical Society held a scheduled meeting. On the program were
papers by W. M. Conway of the State Highway Commission on

Pg 439

âRoads of Wisconsin and How They Can Be Made More Interestingâ;
by Mrs. W. D. Cooke on âShantytown in 1820â; and by J. P.
Schumacher on âThe Site of the First Church Built in Shantytown
by Father Mazzuchelli.â

*  *  *  *  *

An attractively printed program of the Sauk County Historical
Society records a noteworthy list of activities for 1917-18, the
organizationâs thirteenth year. The annual meeting occurred October
5, 1917, the principal address being given by M. M. Quaife on
âThe Angel of Wisconsin.â On March 1, 1918 a second meeting
was held, at which papers or addresses were given on the following
subjects: âThe Coming of the Circuit Rider in Wisconsin,â by
Rev.

W. R. Irish; âThe First Murder Trial in Baraboo,â by R. T.
Warner, of Everett, Washington; âThe First Permanent Settler
at Baraboo,â by Louise P. Kellogg; âPioneer Occupations,â by
N. G. Abbott, of Eureka Springs, Arkansas. The program for the
meeting appointed for April 5 consisted of the following papers:
âWhen I 'Broke Intoâ Sauk County Politics,â by John M. True;
âWisconsin Map by I. A. Lapham,â by H. E. French; âAdditional
Reminiscences of Ableman—A Sequel,â by Eva Alexander; and
âIndians at Baraboo in Pioneer Times,â by M. H. Mould.

*  *  *  *  *

A pamphlet describing Wisconsinâs participation in the exposition
held in Chicago in the summer of 1915 to commemorate the
semicentennial of the emancipation of the Negro has recently been
issued. Hon. S. A. Cook, Neenah, president, Hon. George P. Hambrecht,
Madison, treasurer, and Samuel R. Banks, Madison, secretary,
formed the personnel of the commission appointed by the
Governor to represent Wisconsin. The creditable progress made by
the black man along lines of industry and art was illustrated in convincing
fashion by the exhibits. The report of the progress made
along educational lines is no less worthy of note. A message from
Governor Phillip on Wisconsin Day said: âCertainly they have done
enough to merit our heartiest praise and coÃ¶peration and to inspire
the hope that the problem which confronted the white man when this
vast population was given freedom will be solved by the help of the
leaders of the race itself.â

*  *  *  *  *

At the time of going to press tentative arrangements have been
made for a joint meeting of the State Historical Society and the
Sauk County Historical Society to be held at the site of old Fort
Winnebago near Portage on Labor Day, 1918. There will be a picnic
dinner, but as the place is in the outskirts of Portage any who prefer
to eat at the hotel may easily arrange to do so. A short historical
address will be given, followed by visits to the site of the fort and the
âAgency house,â the latter made famous by Mrs. Kinzie in her book,

Pg 440

Wau Bun
. Near by, also, may be seen the place of the famous Fox-Wisconsin
portage, first crossed by white men, so far as our knowledge
goes, by Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette in 1673, and the old
United States military cemetery. Such a gathering should attract
a large number of visitors from all the surrounding communities.

*  *  *  *  *

Dr. A. Gerend, of Cato, addressed the Manitowoc County Historical
Society on the evening of March 8, on the subject, âThe
Indians of Manitowoc County.â Dr. Gerend is an industrious investigator
in the local field of Indian history and archeology, and has
supplied some interesting material to the State Historical Library.

*  *  *  *  *

On February 10, 1918, the First Baptist Church of Sheboygan
Falls celebrated its eightieth anniversary. Organized February 11,
1838, this church is ten years older than the Commonwealth itself.
The present church building was dedicated December 18, 1850, and
like the organization which it houses, is one of the oldest in Wisconsin.
In the eighty years of its existence the church has had twenty pastors,
ten clerks, and six treasurers.

*  *  *  *  *

The Catholic diocese of Green Bay was created by a breve of
Pope Pius
IX
, March 3, 1868. The semicentennial of its birth was
celebrated throughout the parishes of the diocese during the first
week of March, 1918. Upon organization fifty years ago the diocese
had 26 priests, 27 parishes and 41 missions, 12 schools, and a population
of 40,000. Today it contains 164 parishes and 75 missions
with churches; 106 parish schools with over 24,000 pupils enrolled;
besides 3 colleges for men, an academy for women, 2 Indian schools,
9 hospitals, and a population of 149,000.

*  *  *  *  *

The Mexican War ended seventy years ago, and but few active
participants in it now remain alive. One Mexican War veteran was
James Law, of Madison, who died January 30, 1918. Had he lived
until February 21, he would have been ninety years of age. Mr. Law
was one of Madisonâs early stonemasons, and is said to have worked
on the old Capitol building.

*  *  *  *  *

George B. Ferry, of Milwaukee, probably Wisconsinâs most
eminent architect, died January 29, 1917. Among the notable
buildings designed by Mr. Ferry are the Milwaukee Public Library,
and the splendid home of the State Historical Society at Madison.

*  *  *  *  *

A joint meeting of the Wisconsin Academy of Science, Arts, and
Letters with the Wisconsin Archeological Society was held in the
assembly room of the State Historical Society, April 11 and 12,
1918. Of the two dozen or more papers read, the following were

Pg 441

devoted particularly to Wisconsin history: âAdditional Wisconsin
Peace Medals,â by Charles E. Brown; âThe State Collection of War
Posters,â by Ruth O. Roberts; âThe Work of the Wisconsin War
History Commission,â by John W. Oliver. The other papers were
devoted chiefly to archeological and scientific subjects.

*  *  *  *  *

The Wisconsin Archeological Society held its annual meeting
in the lecture room of the Milwaukee Public Museum on Monday
evening, March 18, 1918. The meeting was well attended by members
from Milwaukee and various other points in the state. At the
business meeting the following officers were elected: Dr. Samuel A.
Barrett, Milwaukee, president; Dr. E. J. W. Notz, Milwaukee, John
P. Schumacher, Green Bay, A. T. Newman, Bloomer, Dr. F. E. Dayton,
New London, and Charles G. Schoewe, Milwaukee, vice presidents.
W. H. Vogel and William A. Phillips were elected members
of the executive board, and Lee R. Whitney, treasurer. The secretaryâs
annual report, read by Charles E. Brown, shows that the
society has been active in the field of exploration and publication.

*  *  *  *  *

De Have Norton of the Fourth Wisconsin Infantry (later the
Fourth Wisconsin Cavalry) died at his home in Hingham, Wisconsin,
February 20, 1918. From Mrs. Norton the Society has received
about twenty-five Civil War letters written by her late husband to
his parents from 1861 to 1865. Mr. Norton served from June, 1861,
until the close of the war. He was an intelligent and entertaining
correspondent and it is a matter for regret that so few of his letters
have been preserved. The following citations from two of his letters
written, the one at Camp Utley, Racine, on the eve of departure for
the front in July, 1861, the other from Montgomery, Alabama, in
May, 1865, afford a pleasing picture of the spirit which animated
our Civil War soldiers. âI shall not see you again so good by Father
& Mother. God be with you till I see you again. I think the cause
which I go to defend is worth the sacrifice which I make, for I do
make a great sacrifice. I leave home and all I love to stake my life
for my Country. I go willingly, as for you, donât fear for me I
shall do well enough. If I never return you will know that I died
in the cause of Liberty & truthâ

*  *  *  *  *

And four years later: âI am safe and sound as ever. We have
had a long and tedious march. * * * There was not a shot exchanged
with the enemy. The rebels are all at home. the towns
are full of them. we mix all together the best of friends. it looks
nice to see the gray uniform and blue uniform together. Well father
after four long years of blood and terror the war is over. You can
imagine the feelings of the soldiers on the subject.â

THE DINSDALE PAPERS

Rev.
Matthew Dinsdale was born at Askrigg, Yorkshire, England,
July 14, 1815, and received his education at a boyâs school in
his native valley Wensleydale. This school was on a foundation
existing from the time of Queen Elizabeth, and one of its first trustees
was Ivor Dinsdale, an ancestor of Matthew. The latter came
to the United States in 1844 on the packet
St.
George
, 1200 tons,
one of the finest transatlantic steamers of its time. After a three
monthsâ journey he arrived at Kenosha (then Southport), Wisconsin,
on the eighth of October, and was soon among friends who had
preceded him and settled at English Prairie just across the Wisconsin
line in McHenry County, Illinois. A month later Mr. Dinsdale
was received into the quarterly conference of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, having brought credentials from the Wesleyan Conference in
England. The next year he joined the Rock River Conference and was
assigned to Potosi circuit in the lead-mining district of southwestern
Wisconsin. The succeeding year Mr. Dinsdale was appointed to the
Lake Winnebago circuit, then a mission district including preaching
stations among the Brothertown Indians, at Oshkosh, and other
new settlements along the lake shore. He virtually lived in the
saddle, going from cabin to cabin, and gathering the settlers together
for a Sunday service. Often he slept by the roadside or in the woods.
His health was impaired by the severe strain of his circuit-riding
days, and in 1849 he joined a group of friends who visited the gold
regions of California. After over two years in this pioneer work,
Mr. Dinsdale returned to England, and there in April, 1853 he married
Mary Anne Mann, of York. Returning to America with his
young English bride, he applied once more for admission to the
Methodist Church, and in 1858 entered the West Wisconsin Conference.
Thereafter for nineteen years he served in many pastorates
in the southwestern part of the state. In 1872 and 1873 he was
preacher in charge at Madison. Four years later he retired from
the active ministry, and spent his declining years at Linden, Iowa
County, where, on April 15, 1898, he passed away.

His only surviving daughter, Mrs. Magnus Swenson, of Madison,
has recently presented to the Historical Society many of her fatherâs
papers. Among them are three diaries of considerable historical
value. The first describes the voyage from England to America,
the early days in this country, the work and events of pioneer life,
âhewing bees,â house-raisings, rail-splittings, hog-killings, and the
like, interspersed with descriptions of the weather, the climate, and
the land.

The second, or California diary, is perhaps the most interesting
of the number. Leaving Linden, Wisconsin, November 3, 1849, the

Pg 443

traveler went via Milwaukee, Buffalo, and Albany to New York City
whence he sailed December 1 for Panama. Thereafter we have a
daily account until the landing, January 21, 1850, at the new city
of San Francisco, which he thus characterizes: âSan Francisco I
think will become a great place. Its location is good convenient and
pleasant and more still is healthy.â Thence the young minister
sought the mining camps, digging during the week and preaching
on Sunday. Here for example is a typical entry: âSunday 19 Jany
1851. A Capt
n
(Sea) told me
how
he came to be in the mines. Lost
his vessel and came to San Francisco to purchase another. There
he took the
fever
and came to dig: Has made but little, Spoke of the
misery caused to familes by the gold discovery. His case that of
thousands. Leave all to mine and then make nothing.â Mr. Dinsdaleâs
case was not of this character. The fifth of June, 1853, the
assay of his gold at the Philadelphia mint amounted to $4,094.13.

The third journal was written when in service as agent of the
Christian Commission in the spring of 1865 in the vicinity of Nashville.
The writer visited the camps and hospitals, distributed papers
and Bibles, read and prayed with the soldiers, and in some cases took
their dying messages.

In addition to the diaries, the papers include many letters of
historical interest. All those written home to England from the time
the young emigrant arrived at New York until he left there five years
later for California have fortunately been preserved. The writer
had a good command of language and a gift for clear and lucid
expression, and he portrays his first experiences in the New World
with delightful vigor and freshness. He relates his first days in
America, the prices of commodities and the modes and discomforts
of traveling. He had an especial fondness for natural scenery, and
his descriptions even of so hackneyed a subject as Niagara Falls,
do not pall upon the reader. More important are the accounts he
gives of conditions in our Territory during its formative years—at
first in the southeast, then in the more settled southwestern portion
he pictures the life of the frontier with truth and vigor. Most
valuable of all, perhaps, is the description he gives of the Lake
Winnebago region when the rapid ingress of new settlers was at its
height, and the Indians were retreating before the American advance.
Among the experiences he details were those of a visit to a Menominee
Indian payment on the shores of Lake Poygan, where his clear observation
of conditions among the retiring race are of peculiar value
to the historian of the tribesmen. In the letters of advice which he

Pg 444

gave to relatives who intended to emigrate, nothing was forgotten,
and their detailed narration presents a full picture of the difficulties
and necessities of the early immigrants from Great Britain, and the
courage required to undertake the long and oft-times dangerous
voyage.

A series of later letters describes the writerâs experience in the
work of the Christian Commission during the Civil War.

Taken as a whole the Dinsdale Papers are a valuable addition
to the collections of our Society, illustrating as they so well do the
experiences of an intelligent, educated immigrant during the formative
period of territorial days. It is to be hoped that many more such
groups of papers, now preserved in private hands, will ultimately
find their way into our custody where they will be of value to the
history of this state.

THE LADD PAPERS

Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, of Chicago, a life member of the Society,
has presented an important collection of letters and documents received
by Dr. Azel Ladd while serving in 1851 and 1852 as state
superintendent of public instruction. For the most part they consist
of appeals to the state officer to interpret the school law for
local communities, and the resolving of disputes and difficulties
between the teachers and the officials. Many of the letters are requests
for information with regard to the allotments of school money,
and a few have to do with the lease or sale of school lands. A considerable
number carry the endorsement âLibrary returns.â These
contain reports of the number of books in the school libraries under
the law requiring one-tenth of the state allotments to be expended
for books. Incidentally from these letters much may be learned of
the early educational history of our state—the short terms of the
schools, the qualifications and salaries of the teachers, the number
and conduct of the pupils. From some of these letters may be seen
the educational conditions among our foreign immigrants. Complaints
are frequent of teachers that cannot write or speak English. One
letter asks the question, later so pertinent in our educational politics,
whether the reading of the Bible constitutes a breach of Section 3,
Article 10 of the Wisconsin Constitution. Another writer, defending
the character of his daughter, a school teacher at Moundville,
sends the Superintendent a specimen of her efforts in verse, which
have been much admired. There are nearly a thousand papers in
the collection, which constitute an important guide to the early
history of education in Wisconsin. Practically all of the letters
belong to the years 1851 and 1852.

SOME RECENT PUBLICATIONS

Holand, Hjalmar R.
,
History of Door County, Wisconsin. The
County Beautiful.
(Two volumes, 459, 480, $21, Chicago,
1917.)

This is a good example of the type of county subscription history
which flourishes in the Middle West. The author had at his
disposal an unusually attractive storehouse of material from which
to construct his narrative; the field was a virgin one, no history of
Door County having ever been written before; the writer is a man
of university education, a long-time resident of the county, and an
enthusiast on the subject of local history. With such conditions
prevailing it is not surprising that the work which has resulted
should constitute a good example of the type to which it belongs.

The second volume of the two is filled with the usual collection
of commercial biographies, for which the promoters of the work are
responsible rather than the author of the history. Volume one, in
which alone his name appears on the title-page, contains the history
of the county which gives title to the work. It comprises fifty chapters
and an appendix. The first nine chapters deal with the usual
preliminary topics pertaining to geography, discovery and exploration,
the Indians, and the French period. It is impracticable to
classify the remaining forty-one chapters further than to note that
they cover, along with many other subjects, sketches of the several
towns of the county, and of the more important types of social and
industrial activity of its people. Thus there are chapters on schools,
banking, political organizations, churches, highways, newspapers,
and industries. More unusual than these are those on lighthouses,
Peninsula State Park, Rock, Chambers, and Washington islands, and
the Sturgeon Bay Canal. Interspersed are several chapters (such
as âA Man of Iron: a Tale of Deathâs Door,â âDavid Kennison,â
âThe Sage of Shivering Sandsâ) which seem either to have no logical
place in the book or to be given a prominence disproportionate to
their importance. There is little perceptible logic about the order
of arrangement of these many chapters, and one does not gain, from
a reading of the book, any clear impression of the progressive unfolding
of the countyâs history and development.

The author possesses an unusual command of the English
language, notwithstanding his birth on foreign soil, and the volume
is entertainingly written. Both the history itself, and the style of
the narrative would have been improved, however, if greater restraint
had been imposed by the author. Journalistic throughout, at its
best the style of the narrative is fascinating; at the opposite extreme

Pg 446

it is oftentimes exuberant as to style and of questionable taste as
to content.

*  *  *  *  *

The January, 1918, number of the
Wisconsin Archeologist
contains
a survey of the Indian remains in Door County, made by J. P.
Schumacher of Green Bay. The survey shows that these consist
chiefly of village and camp sites and burial places, comparatively
few mounds having been found in the county. The author states
that several alleged mounds have proved upon investigation to be
either grass-grown windfalls or sand dunes. One of the most valuable
parts of the bulletin is the section devoted to place names in Door
County. In preparing this, the author was assisted by Dr. Alphonse
Gerend, of Cato.

*  *  *  *  *

Two timely military articles appear in the January, 1918,
number of the
Iowa Journal of History and Politics
. Ivan L. Pollock
concludes his paper on âState Finances During the Civil War,â
and Cyril B. Upham has an especially interesting article on âArms
and Equipment for the Iowa Troops in the Civil War.â A reprint
of the early reports by Captain W. Bowling Guion and Lieutenant
John C. Fremont in 1841 concerning the Des Moines River is included
in this issue.

*  *  *  *  *

The State Historical Society of Iowa has published a volume
entitled
Marches of the Dragoons in the Mississippi Valley
, by Louis
Pelzer. It describes the marches, campaigns, and military activities
of the First Regiment of the United States Dragoons between the
years 1833 and 1850. The services of this military unit during the
period mentioned consisted of frontier defense work, garrison duty,
marches, exploring expeditions, and enforcement of federal laws. For
those who are interested in the army life and activities on our extensive
frontier during the second quarter of the nineteenth century,
the book has more than a local value.

Mr. Charles Freeman, of Menomonie, a member of the State
Historical Society, is the author of an extended article on âEarly
Menomonie, Its Physical Appearance, Its Enterprises and Its Aims,â
published in the

During the early winter John Hicks of Oshkosh was publishing
in his paper, the Oshkosh
Northwestern
, a narrative of his life under
the caption âFifty Years of Oshkosh—A Retrospect.â The last
installment told interestingly of his diplomatic career in South
America. At this point death suddenly interrupted the narration;
the story will forever remain unfinished.

In the Phillips

of March 7, 1918, appeared a long article
by John E. Herron entitled, âThe Early Days of Phillips.â

Dr. Bernard J. Cigrand of Batavia, Illinois, is the author of
a lengthy series of articles in the Port Washington
Star
under the
general title âParental Stories of Pioneer Times.â

A valuable series of articles on the âDevelopment of Farming
in Sauk Countyâ was begun by William Toole, the âpansy king,â
with the issue for February, 1917, of the
Sauk County Farmer
. In
all a dozen or more monthly installments appeared, running from
February, 1917, into the current year.

*  *  *  *  *

John S. Roeseler, of Superior, a life member of the State Historical
Society, is the author of âEarly Days in the Town of
Lomira,â currently published in a large number of installments in
the Lomira
Review
. Aside from its present interest to the community
itself, the general historian of Wisconsin cannot fail to find
such a detailed narrative as this of great value to him in his larger
task of writing the history of the state as a whole.

Those of our readers who are interested in the publications of
our Society dealing with the Lewis and Clark expedition will find
in the January number of the
Missouri Historical Review
an article
describing the great system of transportation that developed in later
years along the route followed by these early explorers. The article
is by Professor H. A. Trexler, of the University of Montana, and is
entitled, âMissouri-Montana Highways.â A second article, dealing
with the travel and commerce on the Overland Trail, is promised for
a later number.

The January, 1918, number of the
Michigan History Magazine

contains a paper by Edward G. Holden on âCarl Schurz in Michigan,â
the author having been associated with Schurz on the Detroit

Post
during the sixties. Other articles in this issue are: âIndian
Legends of Northern Michigan,â by John C. Wright; âHistory of
the Equal Suffrage Movement in Michigan,â by Karolena M. Fox;
âComing of the Italians to Detroit,â by
Rev.
John C. Visman;
âFather Marquette at Michilimackinac,â by Edwin O. Wood; âCongregationalism
as a Factor in the Making of Michigan,â by
Rev.

John P. Sanderson; âHistorical Sketch of the University of Detroit,â
by Pres. William T. Doran; and âThe Factional Character of Early
Michigan Politics,â by Floyd B. Streeter.

A worthy example of collecting and compiling history while it is
in the making is the work that is now being done by Floyd C. Shoemaker,

Pg 448

editor of the
Missouri Historical Review
. Two stimulating
articles have recently appeared in the
Review
, one in September,
1917, the other in January, 1918, entitled âMissouri and the War.â
The part played by the citizens of that commonwealth, the contributions
made by the state both in men and in resources, the recognition
for distinguished services won by Missouri men in the service, are
being carefully collected up to the very latest report. Before filing
these records away in the archives for the use of students of a later
generation, the editor is utilizing them to give the readers of the

Review
a survey of the current activities of their state in the war.

The Nebraska State Historical Society began publication in
February of a monthly news sheet entitled
Nebraska History and
Record of Pioneer Days
. The editor states his aim to be to make
the new publication âa piece of popular literature—as distinguished
from academic.â A practical newspaper worker of long yearsâ experience,
he should easily succeed in this endeavor. Judging from
the indications afforded by the first issue, a thing really new under
the sun has at last been produced—a history journal which is similar
both in typography and in content to the ordinary newspaper. From
another point of view the new journal may be described as a somewhat
glorified press bulletin, belonging to a type with which, in
humbler guise, the world has long been familiar.

The second number of the
Louisiana Historical Quarterly
, bearing
the date September 14, 1917, was distributed in March. Since
the first number was issued January 8, 1917, the
Quarterly
is hardly
living up to the promise implied in its title. This is a matter for
genuine regret, since Louisiana constitutes one of the richest fields
of historical exploitation in America, one well worthy of vigorous
cultivation at the hands of the local historical society. Aside from
a brief paper on Lafayetteâs visit to New Orleans, the issue of the

Quarterly
now at hand is devoted to two interesting items: the first
is a valuable bibliography of the principal works published on Louisiana
and Florida from their discovery until 1855, prepared by A. L.
Boimare, and hitherto unpublished; the second, is a filial and somewhat
passionate attempt at rehabilitating the reputation of General
James Wilkinson, made by his great-grandson, of the same name.

The Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania has launched
a new quarterly publication entitled The
Western Pennsylvania Historical
Magazine
, volume I, number 1, appearing in January, 1918.
The initial number contains the following articles: â
Rev.
John
Taylor, The First Rector of Trinity Episcopal Church of Pittsburgh
and His Commonplace Book,â by Charles W. Dahlinger;

Pg 449

âThe Boatmanâs Hornâ (a poem), by General William O. Butler;
âThe Trial of Mamachteaga, a Delaware Indian, The First Person
Convicted of Murder West of the Alleghany Mountains, and Hanged
for His Crime,â by Judge Hugh Henry Brackenridge; âDiary of a
Young Oil Speculatorâ; and an account of the eleventh annual meeting
of the Ohio Valley Historical Association. One section of the
magazine is devoted to notes and queries.

THE WIDER FIELD

The annual meeting of the Minnesota Historical Society was
held in the new Historical building at
St.
Paul, January 14, 1918.
The address was delivered by Lester B. Shippee of the University
of Minnesota on the subject, âSocial and Economic Effects of the
Civil War with Special Reference to Minnesota.â

*  *  *  *  *

The annual spring meeting of the Mississippi Valley Historical
Association is scheduled to be held at
St.
Paul this year; the formal
dedication of the Minnesota Historical Societyâs building taking
place at this time.

*  *  *  *  *

On April 9, in the Jefferson Memorial Library,
St.
Louis, was
unveiled a bronze Roll of Fame tablet in honor of the pioneers of
Missouri from 1793 to 1826. There are 112 names on the tablet,
among them those of Major Nathan Heald and Rebekah Heald, his
wife. Major Heald was commander at Fort Dearborn from 1810
until its destruction by the savages in 1812. Most of Major Healdâs
existing papers are preserved in the Wisconsin Historical Library.

Mr. R. C. Ballard Thruston of Louisville has secured possession
of the manuscript report of the Illinois country made by George
Rogers Clark to Governor Mason of Virginia in 1779. The document
contains seventy-four pages 6Â½ by 8Â¼ inches, amounting to
some 18,000 words. Mr. Thruston intends that it shall eventually
go either to the Filson Club or to some other Kentucky historical
organization. Although already twice put in print, it is a source
of gratification to the historical fraternity of the Middle West to
know that this interesting manuscript is to be permanently preserved
and made accessible to the public.

*  *  *  *  *

A laudable undertaking having for its ultimate object the improvement
of our relations with Mexico has been instituted through
the generosity of Edward Doheny, of Los Angeles. He has given
a fund for the study of social and industrial conditions in Mexico,
in order that the American public may be given impartial and authoritative
information about these matters instead of having to depend,
as has been largely the case hitherto, on partisan or ill-informed

Pg 450

reports. Twelve students have been at work on the study since
October, 1917, having been engaged for the period of one year. The
results of this work will be published in a series of reports. Members
of the State Historical Society and Wisconsin people, generally,
will be interested to know that Chester Lloyd Jones of Madison, a
life member of the Society, is one of the scholars engaged in this
important task of constructive research. Headquarters for the work
have been established at the Bancroft Library, University of California,
where Mr. Jones is spending the year in the capacity of
research associate of the University.

*  *  *  *  *

The Illinois Catholic Historical Society has recently been organized,
with headquarters in the Ashland Block, Chicago. William J.
Onahan is president of the Society and Joseph J. Thompson editor-in-chief.
From the preliminary announcement, which comes to us
just as we go to press, the new society appears to have the backing
of the more important churchmen of Chicago and Illinois. A magazine,
the
Illinois Catholic Historical Review
, is to be issued.

*  *  *  *  *

As we go to press the program is received for a centennial meeting
of the Illinois State Historical Society at Springfield, April 17
and 18. Addresses by
Prof.
Allen Johnson, of Yale, Elbert J. Benton,
of Western Reserve, C. W. Alvord, of the University of Illinois,
Charles W. Moores, of Indianapolis, Hon. Louis Aubert, member of
the French High Commission, and Pres. John H. Finley, of the University
of New York, are scheduled.

Francis A. Sampson, secretary of the Missouri Historical
Society from 1901 to 1915 and bibliographer from 1915 on, died at
Columbia, Missouri, February 4, 1918. From 1906 until 1915 Mr.
Sampson was editor of the
Missouri Historical Review
. He was an
inveterate collector of materials pertaining to Missouri history, and
was largely responsible for the upbuilding of the societyâs library
of 60,000 titles.

*  *  *  *  *

The death of Father Arthur E. Jones, archivist of the Jesuit
College of
St.
Mary, took place at Montreal, on January 19. Father
Jones was one of the foremost authorities in America on the work
of the early Jesuit missionaries and explorers. To the unrivaled
opportunities afforded him for utilizing all the source material in
the possession of his order he united a great energy and zeal in
carrying his researches to the very scene of Jesuit labors, one of his
many activities being the location around the Georgian Bay of the
mission stations which were destroyed in the Iroquois onslaughts, so
well described by Parkman. The researches that were carried on in
this regard were fully described in the fifth annual report of the
Bureau of Archives of Ontario, published in 1909.

Pg 451

The archives of
St.
Maryâs College, Montreal, of which Father
Jones was custodian, comprise one of the most valuable collections
of material on early Canadian and mid-west material in the Dominion.
Marquetteâs journal is there; so are the wonderfully minute linguistic
writings of Father Potier, five large volumes dealing with the Huron
language, now completely dead. When it is remembered that the
Jesuits have been in America three centuries and that they are
noted for the care they take of their records, some idea can be gained
of the importance of the collection in
St.
Maryâs College.

In his later years Father Jones had given special attention to
making his record of Jesuit service at the various missions as complete
as possible. He had also done considerable work on the Potier
writings which, but for the outbreak of the Great War, would probably
have been reproduced in photo-facsimile ere now by the Ontario
Archives Department. The project is only held up until such time
as world affairs are less disturbed.

Though a portion of his life was spent in parochial work, the
chief work of Father Jones was along educational lines. He is the
author or editor of a number of valuable publications in his chosen
field of investigation. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of
Canada and a corresponding member of several of the leading historical
societies of the United States, including our own State Historical
Society. He was a fine type of that mentality which the
training of his order so often produces; a delightful friend and
acquaintance and a thorough investigator.

The Wyoming Historical and Geological Society of Pennsylvania
celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of its founding on April 12,
1918, commemorating at the same time the one hundred tenth anniversary
of the burning of anthracite coal successfully in an open
grate of Wilkes-Barre. Christopher Wren was elected corresponding
secretary of the society, succeeding the late
Rev.
Horace E. Hayden.

*  *  *  *  *

The leading article in the March number of the
Mississippi
Valley Historical Review
is on âPresident Lincoln and the Illinois
Radical Republicans,â by Arthur C. Cole. It sets forth in interesting
fashion the dissatisfaction felt by the radical wing of the Republican
party in the early part of Lincolnâs administration with his
conservative and temporizing policy. L. H. Gipson gives a clear account
of the internal dissensions and other factors responsible for
âThe Collapse of the Confederacyâ; Homer Hockett, formerly of
Wisconsin, discusses âThe Influence of the West on the Rise and Fall
of Political Partiesâ; and Theodore Blegen, of Milwaukee, a member
of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, tells of âA Plan for
the Union of British North America and the United States, 1866.â
Professor Alvord, whose resignation as managing editor of the
Review

was announced in our March number, has consented to continue in
charge until the close of the war.

Transcriberâs Note:

Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were moved to the
end of the section in which the related anchors occur. Misspelled
words were not corrected. Dialect, obsolete and alternative spellings
were left unchanged. Obvious printing errors, such as duplicate words
and backwards, upside down, or partially printed letters, were
corrected. In the index, the entries for Kellog are not in
alphabetical order.

Punctuation, lack of final stops, and use of capital letters is
haphazard in the diary and elsewhere; the text and punctuation was
retained unchanged, except as noted below.

Changes:

Added em dash after

Added close quote

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm

same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

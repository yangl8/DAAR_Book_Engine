To his most Approved Good Friend Mr. PETER KOLARD, the Author, with
all Submission, Dedicateth this his Treatise of the Talking Deaf Man.

My much honoured Friend
,

This little endeavour, how small soever it be, is upon many Accounts
due to you; For besides that, the Truth of the matter here exposed, is
to no one, (except my Self) more apparent, you did heap on me so many
Favours, whilst I abode in your House, upon account of teaching your
Daughter, and rendred me to be so much Yours, as no less could be
sufficient, than to erect a publick, and as much as in me lay, an
eternal Monument of Gratitude to you. How great the Incredulity of
this Age is, no Man almost knows better than your self; there have
been, and still are, such as boldly deny, that it is possible to bring
the
Deaf
to speak; others, though they should be admitted to be
Eye-Witnesses, yet would not stick to doubt still of the matter:
Wherefore, what-ever it was that I performed to your Daughter, and to
some others, and by what Artifice I did it, I now ingenuously expose
to the Eyes of all the World. I heartily wish that they may so make
use of this my labour, as that for the future, no more
Dumb
Persons
may be found.

In the number of these doubting Persons, you have confessed to me,
that you your self had formerly been, until you had heard a certain
Maiden, who before had been
Dumb
, talking with me at
Amsterdam
;
perhaps I should have been so my self, if, when I was ignorant in the
thing, I had received narratively only, that some such thing was
performed by another; wherefore I resolved rather to convince the
Incredulity of Men (which now is accounted Prudence amongst most Men)
of an Error, than to reprove them for their Rashness.

It is now three Years since I first thought to make this my Method
publick; but had I then done it, I should now have repented it,
because in this Interval I have much more polished it; and rendered it
more easie by far; and as to what belongs to the practise thereof,
more certain, yea, and all to that degree, as I dare confidently
assert, that henceforth there shall be no
Deaf
Person, (provided he
be of a sound Mind, and be not Tongue-tied, nor of an immature Age)
who by my Instruction shall not in the space of two Months speak
readily enough. Perhaps also I shall hereafter repent, that I have
published this small Treatise, as yet too immature; yet I had rather
confess an Error, if I shall any where commit one, or in any future
Edition augment it, than wholly to pass it over in Silence; for if I
should be snatcht away by a hasty Death, (even as a tender state of
Health doth threaten me) I should not know how to render to God an
Account of the Talent committed to me, as he may require it of me.

Nothing therefore remained, most Worthy Sir, than that I should beg
your Pardon, that I have made bold thus to interrupt you in the midst
of Affairs, which almost swallow you wholly up; but I believe you will
the more readily give it me, because this little Script may make my
Absence less troublesome to you, because, according to the precepts
here given, you yourself will be able to take care that your Daughter
shall not only not forget all what she already knows, but more and
more accomplish them. However, I humbly beseech you, that him whom you
have begun to love, yea, though he be removed far from you, that you
will persist still therein, and to take upon your self as need shall
require it, the Patronage of the Truth it self. Farewel, and be well.

J. Conrade Amman.

To his Learned friends
Richard Waller,
and
Alexander Pittfield,

Esquires, of the
Royal Society.

Gentlemen
,

The holding of a Candle to the Sun is not more absurd, than thus to
present you with an
English
Version of a
Latin
Treatise. All who
know you, know you to be Masters of not only most of the
European
,
but also of the Learned Languages. But my excuse is, that what I have
done for the sake of English Readers, I expose under your learned
Names; the Subject-matter of which may be useful, and therefore
acceptable to your selves and others. However, I am willing to
discover my Ambitious aim herein, which is to let the World know who
are my Friends, and what Names may give Honour to mine. I know, that
several very considerable Members of that great Society, to which you
so nearly relate, have already, both in Theory and Practise,
acquainted the World with very remarkable things of this nature; and
whether what is here published, will in the least, either elucidate or
add to those already taught, and done by those very knowing persons, I
neither dare nor will determine; but if neither one nor the other be
here found, yet it is sometimes grateful to us, to see how good and
great wits do jump, and in such Circumstances as these no Man can
account Store to be a Soare.
I
have only this to further mention,
that the
Author
chose the
High-German
Tongue to become his
exemplar, rather than any other Modern or Antique; it therefore is
necessary, that he who would put his Rules in practice in any other
Language, must observe a due Analogy in
mutatis mutandis
. Thus (my
Friends) I have exposed both you and my self, if any blame happen, let
that be all mine, who (without your Knowledge and Concession) did this
Indignity to you, and to aggravate it, thus publickly to stile my
self,

Gentlemen,

Your Cordial Friend and Servant,

Dan. Foot.

TO THE READER.

Candid Reader,

In these few Pages, I expose to thee openly and ingenuously, by what
means I can learn the Deaf, (and because they were born so) the Dumb
to speak articulately
, and easily to understand others also when they
are speaking, so as they may be able both to read, and to understand a
Book, or Letter, and to discover their own Minds, either by Speach or
Writing.

How important a Benefit is this? How advantageous is the not hearing
supplied by this Art? If Envy, or the detestable greedy Desire of
Gain_
could have prevailed with me, I had retained this Art, as lockt
up in my own Breast. But alass! How miserable is the condition of the
Deaf? How lame and defective is that Speach, which is performed by
Signs and Gestures? How little are they capable to receive of those
things which concern their eternal Salvation? Who doth not
commiserate

this sort of Persons? Who can refuse to help them by all
means which are possible? For my part, I, by the help of God's Grace,
will not only help them, but will make publick and vulgar what is best
to be done therein, yea, and have done so already, that they can
understand others speaking, even with the softest
Voice,
or rather
whispering
.

This Doctrin will seem new and incredible to most Men, yet is not
plainly altogether unheard of; for, as I heard, there have been some,
who engaged themselves in this cure; but what they effected therein, I
must acknowledge is unknown to me; yea, I Religiously attest, that
before I did excogitate this Matter, I met not with the least

foot-step thereof in any Author. Notwithstanding, some there be, who
reject at first sight this Doctrin as fabulous; others, and those
perhaps the same also; who when I shall have discovered to them the
manner thereof, will cry, that they could do the same thing: I, for my
part; am not concerned at either of them, well knowing, that those who
are just in their
_Estimation of things, will judge otherwise.

When thou, by reading shalt arrive thus far (good_ Reader)
stop a
little (I pray thee) and use the liberty granted to every one, and
attentively revolve in thy Mind, what thou thy self would'st do, if
such a case as this was committed to thy care. If so be thou shaltst
find out the right way, give God

thanks, and let it suffice, that I
have admonished thee; if not, go on to read what follows, where thou
wilt find it, with very little trouble. This very way is that, by
which I taught
Ehster Kolard, (
a young Virgin of great Hopes, the
only Daughter of Mr
Peter Kolard,
who was born Deaf) not only to
read, but also to speak readily, yea, and to

hold Discourse with
others and in a short time she profited so much, as to remember a many
Questions and Answers in the Catechism, yea, and as far as her young
Years were capable, she understood the Sense of them also: She
rejoyced greatly when I told her, that I was willing to make this
Method, by which she learned to speak, common
to all. Friendly_
Reader,
use and accept well these things; and if thou knowest any
things better, Candidly impart them, and make not thy self Ungrateful.
Farewell.

An Advertisement to the
English Reader
.

About 26 Years since, the Honourable, Learned, and Pious F.M. Baron of

Helmont
caused to be published in Latin a small Treatise; wholly and
fully to the same purpose, with what is here published: Which said
Treatise, entituled,
The Alphabet of Nature
, is now in Hand to be
Translated, and Publish'd in
English
; of which it was thought fit
here to give thee this Notice.

Thou art also (kind
Reader
) to be advertised, that there is very
lately Translated into the
English
a very learned Tract, entituled,

The Divine Being, and its Attributes
; demonstrated from the Holy
Scriptures, and Original Nature of things, according to the Principles
of the aforesaid F.M. Baron of
Helmont
. Written in
Low-Dutch

THE TALKING DEAF MAN.

CHAP. I.

An Inquiry into the Nature of a
Voice,
and in what respect it
differs from the Breath
.

Let no Man presume, that he shall ever attain to this noble Art, if he
remain Ignorant in what it is that the nature of the Letters, as well
in general, as special, doth consist; for it was this very thing which
gave occasion to the composing of this small Treatise: Wherefore,
before I treat of the manner of instructing
Deaf
Persons, I shall
bring into examination, First, the material part of the
Letters
,
viz.
Voice
and
Breath
; Secondly, the
Letters themselves
, and
their Differences: Thirdly, and Lastly, I will teach the
Practise
of
the Art.

I have oftentimes heard from some Persons, that it was little beneath
a Miracle, that God should give Men, to express the Thoughts of the
Mind, rather by Motions, which are effected by the Lips, the Tongue,
the Teeth, &c. than otherwise, and that so universally, that there is
no Nation so Barbarous, no not excepting the
Hottentots
, which
cannot speak in a Language. But let (I pray) these Men consider, what
it is that Men rightly Instituted would have, whilst they mutually
talk one with another; for they desire to open the most inward
Recesses of the Heart, yea, and to transfuse their own proper Life
into others, which thing cannot be more commodiously done, than by
Speaking; for there is nothing which floweth forth from us, which
carrieth with it a more vivid Character of the Life, than our
Voice

doth; yea, in the
Voice
is the
Breath
of Life, part of which
passeth into the
Voice
; for indeed the
Voice
is the Child of the
Heart, which is the Seat of the Affections, and of Desire. Hence it
is, that sometimes we are not able to keep back the impetuous Motions
of the Affections; but
out of the abundance of the Heart, the Mouth
speaketh.
Thus, when we desire something in our selves, and yet are
afraid to express it, the Heart labours like a Woman with Child, and
becomes Anxious; but if we can pour it forth into the Bosom of a
Friend, there presently ariseth great Tranquility, and we say, that we
have emptied our Hearts: Yea, so full is the
Voice
of the Life,
which immediately flows from the Heart, that to talk long, extreamly
wearieth us; but especially the Sick, who oftentimes can scarce utter
three or four words, but they faint away. Therefore, to comprehend
much in a few words, the
Voice
is an Emanation from that very
Spirit, which God breathed inth Man's Nostrils, when he Created him a
living Soul. Hence also,
The Word of God, the Son of God, the
Omnipotence of God
, &c. are in Holy Scripture oftentimes homonymous,
or of the like, and same import.

It is no wonder therefore, if
Voice
be natural to a Man, though he
be
Deaf
, because
Deaf Men
Laugh, Cry out, Hollow, Weep, Sigh, and
Waile, and express the chief Motions of the Mind, by the
Voice
which
is to an Observant Hearer, various, yea, they hardly ever signifie any
thing by Signs, but they mix with it some
Sound
or
Voice
. Thus the
Exclamations of almost all Nations are alike; [
a
] is the
Sound
of
him chiefly, who rejoyceth; [
i
] of him who is in Indignation, and
Angry; [
o
] of one in Commiseration, or Exclamation; not to mention
many such other-like.

Now I shall briefly declare, wherein the nature of the
Voice

consisteth, where it is formed, and how it is formed: I shall also
discover, together therewith, wherein is the difference betwixt

Voice
and
Breath simply
, as what is in truth, of so much weight,
that if it be unknown, some Deaf Persons cannot learn to speak, as
shall be taught in the Third Chapter. Men ordinarily speak after two
manner of ways, viz. either when they may be heard by any one, who is
not too far distant from them, and that is properly call'd
Voice
; or
else, when they speak privately in another's Ear, and then they
pronounce a
Breath which is simple, but not Sonorous
. Deaf Men also
do know a
Voice
to be different from a
Simple Breath
; for they can
speak both ways, and I also have learned this Distinction partly from
them.

The Humane
Voice
is Air, impregnated, and made Sonorous by the
impressed Character of the Life, or is such, as whilst it is in
breathing forth, doth smite upon the Organs of the
Voice
, so, as

they tremble thereupon
; for indeed, without this tremulous Motion,
no
Voice
is made: Yea, not only the
Larynx
, or Wind-pipe, doth
thereupon tremble, but the whole Skull also; yea, and sometimes
all
the Bones

of the whole Body
, which any one may easily find in
himself, by his applying his Hand to his Throat, and laying it on the
top of his Head. This trembling is very perceptible in most sounding
Bodies, and is (if I mistake not) owing for the most part to the

Springiness
of the Air; which, did I not study to be brief, I could
more fully explicate. Now the
Simple Breath
is Air, breathed forth
by the opening of the Mouth or Nostrils, simply, and without any
smiting on the parts, which rather exciteth a whispering than a sound.
Hence is it, that Animals, whose Wind-pipe is cut beneath the Throat,
do indeed render a
Breathing
, but no
Voice
; for the Tube of the
Wind-pipe is too large, and too smooth, than that the Air can strike
upon it any where; and being thus reflected on its self, it can also
imprint a tremulous Motion on its neighbouring Bodies: This the
Physicians Pupils do know; who being about to dissect live Dogs, they
cut their Throats, that they may not be troubled with their barking:
For
Voice
differs as much from a
Simple Breath
, as doth that
hoarse Sound, which we excite, by rubbing the tops of our Fingers hard
upon some Glass or Table, which is quite differing from that same

soft whistling Sound
, which is heard when we lightly rub with the
Hand the same Glass or Table.

The
Voice
therefore, as it is the
Voice
, is generated in the

Cartilages of the Wind-pipe
, then afterwards is formed into such or
such
Letters
; but that it may become a lovely
Voice
, it's
requisite, that those Cartilages be
smooth
, and
lined with no
mucous Matter
, else the
Voice
will become Hoarse, and sometimes be
utterly lost, viz. when they have lost their Springy power.

For
Pipes
; and other
Wind-Instruments
do most notably explain to
us the nature of the
Voice
; for in them we see a certain
Voice
or

Sound
to be generated out of Simple Air, whilst it is as it were,
rent in pieces, and forced into a tremulous Motion: Now, that in these
Instruments there is a little Tongue; or which is instead of a Tongue,
the same in a Man is the
Epiglott
, or Cover of the
Wind-pipe
, and
the
Uvula
, or Pallate of the Mouth; but the rest of the
Cartilages

of the
Throat
, besides that, they contribute much to the making of
the
Voice
, yet are they chiefly serviceable to it, in rendering it
to be more flat, and more sharp, and that especially by the
Bone of
the Tongue
, and the adjoyning Muscles: But I am unwilling to put from
this Office the Muscles which are proper to the
Wind-pipe
; for they
all unanimously conspire to make the
Cleft of the Throat
either
wider, or narrower. But above all, here is that wonderful Faculty of
modifying the
Voice
, according to Will and Pleasure; which, even as

Speech
also, is not natural to us, but a Habite, contracted by long
Use or Custom. Hence it is, that the Unskilful are not only Ignorant
how to Sing, but also cannot so much as imitate others who are
Singing; so also such as are ignorant of any Language, do not only not
understand others who are speaking that Language, but also do not know
how presently to repeat that
Voice
which they received by their
Ears.

Things principally requisite to the
Voice
, are, that the

Wind-pipe
, the former thereof be solid, dry, and of the nature of

Resounding
Bodies. By this
Hypothesis
, two of the most Eminent

Phænomena's of the Voice
are discovered; why the
Voice
should then
at length become firm and ripe, when the Bones have attained unto
their full Strength, and due Hardness, which cometh to pass much about
the Years of ripe age, when the vital Heat, doth in a greater degree
exert itself: The other Phænomenon is
Hoarsness
or an utter loss of
the
Voice
, which is, when the
Cartilages
, or
Gristles of the
Throat
, especially the
Epiglott
, or Coverlid of the
Wind-pipe
, is
lined or besmeared all over with a slimy Viscosity, whereby they lose
their
Elasticity
, or Springiness. Now these Symptoms of the
Voice

are also common to other
Wind-instruments
, when they become too much
moistned by any vapourous wetting Air. The same reason also is to be
assigned why the
Voice
doth at last quite cease in those who have
made too long Harrangues, in speaking, and whose Jaws are quite dried
with an immoderate Heat; for in both these cases the top of the

Wind-pipe
is covered over with a clammy
Tenacious Phlegm
.

There remains yet two other Symptoms of the
Voice
, which I have
undertaken to explicate, viz. why the
Voice
sometimes leaps from one

Eighth
to another; and, as it is rightly said by the Vulgar
Expression, that it is broken: and why, when we strive to make our

Voice
either too sharp, or too flat, it at last plainly faileth us.
As to the first, let us consider when and how it cometh to pass; and
first, it's what principally happeneth to
Orators
, when they
endeavour to lift up their
Voice
too high, or strongly; but how this
cometh to be,
Organ-pipes
, and the
Monochorde
, do teach us,
viz.

when some Impediment interposing, doth divide the
ordinary Sound

into two; if therefore those parts are equal, either of them is by one

Eighth
more sharp than the former Sound, neither are they
distinguished from one another; but if they prove to be unequally
divided, then two
distinct Sounds
are made at the same time, whereof
one is flatter than the ether, and this is commonly called a
broken
Voice
: But why our
Voice
should fail us, when we endeavour to make
it more sharp, or more flat than it ought to be, the reason is,
because we strive either so to contract the
Cleft
of the

Wind-pipe
, and to press the
Spout-like Cartilage
, by help of the

Bone of Tongue
, towards the
Epiglott
, that the going forth of the

Voice
, and of the
Breath
, may be precluded, or else, on the
contrary, because that the said
Cleft
, through the drawing down of
the
Cartilages
, is so much widened, that the departing out of the

Breath
, finds no hinderance.

But here I had almost forgot to compare the
more dry
, the
more
moist
, the
more solid
, and the
more thin
Constitution of the

Larynx
, or
Wind-pipe
, which also make very much to the rendering
the
Voice
, to be either sharp, or flat. That same humming Noise,
which
many flying Insects
make, not so much by the Wings, (for when
they are cut off, the humming still remains) as by a most swift and
brisk Motion of certain Muscles, hid in the Cavity of their Breasts,
seems to have somewhat of an affinity to the
Voice
; wherefore I
desire the Learned to examine, whether those small
Muscles, which are
proper to the Cartilages of the Wind-pipe
, cannot perform somewhat
like to that.

Many more Particulars concerning the
Voice
might yet further be
inquired into, such as, how it is, that every one may be known by his

Voice
? How that
Sound
, which in Singing is called
Quavering
, or

Trilling
, by a peculiarity, is excited, &c, But seeing that these
things do not properly respect the nature of the
Voice
, I, for
Brevities sake, do omit them.

CHAP. II.

Expounding the Nature of the
Letters,
and the manner how they are
formed
.

Hitherto we have treated concerning the
Voice
and
Breath
, and of
the manner of the formation of both of them, in general; now let us
see how the said
Voice
and
Breath
are, as a fit Matter for them,
framed into such or such
Letters
; for the
Voice
and
Breath
are
alone the material part of
Letters
, but the form of them is to be
sought out from the various Configurations of those hollow Channels,
thorough which they pass;
Letters
therefore, not as they be certain
Characters, but as they are Pronounced or Spoken, are the
Voice
and

Breath
, diversly Figured by the Instruments ordained for the Speech.

But here we must be pre-admonished concerning the
Letters
; that
there is a great Latitude almost amongst them all, and that one and
the same Character is not pronounced by one and the same Configuration
of the Mouth, yea, in one and the same Language; thus [
a
] and [
e
]
sometimes are sounded open, and sometimes close; also [
o
] hath its
own Latitude, so as many other Letters also may have; yea, as many as
are the divers Modes, by which the
Voice
and
Breath
can be
Figured, by the Organs of Speech; but the most easie, only, and the
most Conspicuous are received by all Nations, whose number never
almost exceedeth Twenty four, and have certain Characters annexed to
them: But seeing that these Characters are not every where pronounced
alike, yea, one and the same Letter sometimes is variously sounded by
one and the same People, therefore I have made choice of the
German
Letters
, which are of my Mother-Tongue, and the most
Simple
of all
Letters, to be examined in this place: in as much as they are for the
most part sounded every where alike, their
Vowels
are very
Simple
,
and agreeable to the nature of the thing, the
Diphthongs
compounded
of them, do retain the Nature of their compounding
Vowels
, because
they are always heard pronounced in them, otherwise, than as it is in
most other Languages, which they stile living ones; for sometimes they
make their
Diphthongs
out of the most
Simple Vowels
, as are [
au
]
[
ou
] [
ai
] amongst the
French
, and [
oe
] and [
eu
] amongst the

Dutch
, or else they have such improper
Diphthongs
, that scarce
either of their compounding
Vowels
can be heard, such are [
oi
] of
the
French
, and [
uy
] of the
Dutch
, not to mention more Examples,
or else they are variously sounded according to their various
Placings, so as if I were to teach some Deaf
French-man
, I would
from the beginning teach him, not the
French
, but the
German
Letters
, or else he would be plainly confounded. Nor is the state of
the
Consonants
in better case for the Pronunciation of some of them,
is so very different, that there are scarce two Nations, which
pronounce the Character [
g
] after the same manner.

But in the
German
Alphabet, that which most disliketh me, is, their
Order; which, in good truth, is none; because scarce two Letters of
the same rank do follow mutually after one another, which would render
the information of Deaf Persons to be so much the more difficult;
wherefore I have reduced them into this following order, which seemed
to me to be the most natural.

a. e. i. j. y. o. u. ä. ö.
ü. m. n. ng. l. r. h. g. ch. s.
f. v. k. c. q. d. t. b. p.
x. z.

To those who observe well, it will from this order alone, appear, that
I have divided this whole Alphabet into
Vowels
,
Semi-vowels
, and

Consonants
. The
Vowels
are a
Voice
or
Sound
modified by a
various opening of the Mouth only, and are either
Simple
, or
Uniform, as
a. e. i. j. y. o. u. w.
Or else they are mixt, which out
of two, do so melt down into one, as that they are pronounced
together, and are different from
Diphthongs
, in as much as their

Vowels
are successively pronounced: Now these mixt
Vowels
, are ä.
ö. ü. which some Nations either have not at all, or else do write them
evilly; but of the manner of Formation, more shall be said hereafter.

The
Semi-vowels
are a middle sort between the
Genuine Voice
, and a

Simple Breath
, and may at pleasure be brought forth in the manner as

Vowels
are; and they are either of the
Nose
, or
Nasall
such are

m. n. ng.
or else they be of the
Mouth
, or
Orall
, as
l. r.

Consonants
are a
Simple Breath
, not sonorous, yet
variously modified, and are of three kinds:

For they are either pronounced successively, and may be produced at
pleasure, as
g. ch. s. f. v.

Or are suddainly
shot forth
; which upon that score I call them

explosive
, as
k. c. q. t. d. b. p.

Or else being
Compounded
out of two foregoing ones, their number is
diverse in divers Nations; the
Germans
have two;
viz.

x.
and

z.

To this Division, in which I have had respect chiefly to the nature,
and manner of pronouncing the
Letters
, may not impertinently be
added, that those
Letters
are formed mostly in three
Regions of the
Mouth
,
viz.
in the bottom, or
Throat
; in the middle, or in the

Palate
and
Teeth
; and lastly, in the utmost part thereof, or in
the
Lips
: Hence it is, from every one of their Classes almost, are
three sorts; one
Guttural
, another
Dental
, and a third
Labial
;
but of these, more hereafter.

I will here prevent the
Readers
who may object to me in the
following Chapter, that this my Doctrin will be always lame, because
all Deaf Persons, whom we would teach by the Tongue, Lips,
&c.
will
never by their Sight attain unto these motions: But, besides that the
Sight doth not give place to the Hearing, as to a quick sensibility, I
affirm, that there is no need thereof, if once they have made but any
Progress; for even we our selves do very often not hear in
Pronunciation those Letters which I call
Consonants
, but we collect
them from the
Vowels
and
Semi-vowels
, commixed together with them:
No Man, for Example, shall so pronounce
b. g.
or
d.
as that he may
be heard at a hundred Paces distant. And this seems to me to be the
principal reason why we can most rarely pronounce or repeat at the
first blush, any word spoken in a foreign Language.

But before I shall unfold the nature, and manner of forming the

Letters
in special, I judged that it was not here to be omitted, how
that as all the
Letters
, yea also, and the
Vowels
them-selves,
cannot by any means be pronounced, as they are a
Simple Breath
, and
not sonorous; for when we, for Example, do whisper somewhat to one in
his Ear, so the
Consonants
also, excepting those which I call

Explosive
, may be pronounced vocally, or with the
Voice
conjoyned;
and there are Nations which pronounce thus, as the
French
do their

z.
and their
v.

I shall now treat of the
Letters
especially, and will examine them
so, as both the absolute Simplicity of the
German Letters
may be
manifested; and other Nations, from their Mode of Formation, may
learn, how they ought to pronounce them; upon this account also, I
shall add how improperly some Nations do render the same Letters in
their own Language. Now in this Explication I shall observe the same
order as I did in the Division of them, where readily it will appear,
that
Voice
and
Breath
are according to a triple Region of the
Mouth, triply figured or formed spontaneously.

Therefore the Simple and Uniform
Vowels
are,
a.

e.

i.

j.

y.

o.

u.

w.
and are formed after the following manner.

a.
is a
Gutteral Vowel
, and the most Simple of all; the Key of the

Alphabet
, and therefore is by all Nations set first of all,
excepting only (as far as I know) the
Abyssines
, by whom, as Ludolf
testifieth, it is placed as the Thirteenth
Letter
. True indeed it
may be pronounced by various Placings of the
Tongue
, yet the common,
and most convenient is, that the
Tongue
should be in its posture of
rest; and then being gently stretched forth in the
Mouth
, it may
only lightly, or not at all touch upon the utmost Border of the lower

Teeth
; if therefore the lower
Jaw
be drawn downwards, and thereby
the
Mouth
be opened, that the
Voice
formed in the
Throat
,
strikes not neither against the
Teeth
, nor against the
Lips
, than
a plain open [
a
] is heard,
e. i. j. y.
are
Dental Vowels
, or the

Voice
, which in coming forth, smites more or less against the

Teeth
; Hence it is that Infants, although they can say
Pappa, bo,
&c.
yet can they not pronounce these Letters until they have Teeth,
especially
the Cutters
, or
fore-Teeth
; and indeed [
e
] is
formed, when the
Voice
, (the
Lips
being gently opened), strikes
against the
Teeth
also moderately opened; now the
posture of the
Tongue
is such, that it somewhat presses on each side
upon the
Dog-Teeth
of the Inferior
Jaw
, for so the passage of the

Voice
is made narrower, and the [
e
] much more clear.

i. j.
and
y.
are the same
Vowel
, pronounced one while more
short, and another more long, nor doth it stand upon any Foundation,
[
i
] sometimes doth become a
Consonant
, but then is pronounced only
more swiftly, so as together with the following
Vowel
, it can make a

Diphthong
; but [
i
] is formed after the same manner almost,
as [
e
] except that the
Teeth
are for the most part, more stricken,
and the
Tongue
put close to the
Teeth
, the passage of the
Voice

is rendred more strait, whence a more smart Sound also breaks forth,
which notwithstanding, can sometimes be hardly distinguished from
[
e
] [
y
,] also is [
i
] pronounced longer then usually, or [
i
]
doubled.
o. u. w.
are
Labial Vowels
, that is, such as are formed
by a different positure of the
Lips
; also [
o.
] and [
u.
] are
different from one another, just as much as [
e.
] and [
i
]: But
[
w.
] is to [
u.
] just as
j.
is to [
i.
] for indeed
a. u. w.

are formed, when the
Teeth
and
Tongue
keep the same posture; but
the
Lips
are more or less contracted, even as the
Teeth
are in
[
e.
] and [
i.
] and so when they are less stricken, [
o.
] is
produced, but when a little more [
u.
] or [
w.
]; but we ought
carefully to beware, whilst [
o.
] or [
u.
] are pronounced, least the

Teeth
should be seen; for else a certain kind of a soft
e.
will be
mingled; and instead of
ö.
or
ü.
there will be produced
o.
or

u.
These Letters belong to the
French
,
au
and
ou
, when
nevertheless they are nothing else but
Diphthongs
, also
oe.
of the

Dutch
is our
u.
but very improperly.

Mixt
Vowels
are
ä. ö. ü.
These Characters are peculiar to our
Language, and were invented very ingeniously by our Ancients, though
our Moderns mostly know not the reason thereof. Each hath its simple
Character, because the Sound which they signifie, is only one, tho'
mixt; for
a.

o.
and
u.
are so pronounced, that the passage of
the
Voice
, the
Tongue
and
Teeth
being conjoyned for to
pronounce,
e.
becomes Straiter, and so
e.
together with the said
Letters,
a.

o.

u.
doth constitute but one only, yet a
mixt
vowel
. The
French
utter them by
ai.

eu.
and
u.
and in good
truth, badly enough, as any one may see. The
Dutch
want
[ä].

[ö].
and express them by
eu.
but
[ü].
by
u.
in no better a way
than the
French
.

Concerning the
Diphthongs
composed out of these
Vowels
, and which
may be thence compounded, I judge it needless to say much; for they
are nothing else in our Language than a more then usual swift
Pronunciation of the Component
Vowels
, yet successive; and thus they
differ from the
mixt Vowels
, but how improper and absurd

Diphthongs
some Nations have, any one may easily gather from what
hath been already said.

The other sort of Letters are
Semi-Vowels
, which are therefore so
called, because that they be formed indeed out of a
Sounding Breath

or
Voice
, but such as in its progress is much broken. They are, as I
said, either
Nasalls
, or such as are pronounced through that open
passage, by which the
Nose
opens into the Hollow of the
Mouth
: Now
the
Voice
is forced to go that way, either when it flows to the

Lips
shut close, and rebounding from thence, is formed into [
m
;]
or when the
Tip of the Tongue
is so applied to the roof of the
Mouth, and to the upper
Teeth
, the
Voice
is made to rebound
through the
Nostrils
, and so [
n
] becomes formed; or lastly, when
together with the hinder part of the
Tongue
, the
Voice
being
applied to the
Roof
, is so straitned that there is no Egress left
open for it, but through the
Nose
, and so [
n
] is formed; which is
a Sound, which hath no peculiar Character in any Language, as I know
of, yet it differs no less from the rest of the
Nasals
, (
k
) is
divers from (
t
) or (
p
,) if any one desires to try this by himself,
let him endeavour to pronounce; having his
Nose
held close with his
Fingers, one of these three Letters, and he will not be able to do it.

Or else these
Semivowels
are
Orall
, which are indeed such as are
pronounced thro' the
Mouth
, but not so freely as are the
Genuin
Vowels
, and they be two, (
l
) and (
r;
) (
l
) is formed when the

Tongue
is so applied to the
Roof
, and the upper
Teeth
, that the

Voice
cannot, but by a small Thred, as it were, get forth by the
Sides of the
Tongue
; for if you compress the
Cheeks
to the

Grinders
, you stop up the Passage of the
Voice
, and it will be
very difficult for you to pronounce this
Letter
, (
r
,) is a
Voice

fluctuating with great swiftness, and is formed, when the more movable
part of the
Tongue
does in the twinkling of an Eye, oftentimes
strike upon the
Roof of the Mouth
, and as often is drawn back again
from it; for thus the
Voice
formed in the
Throat
, in its
pronouncing, flows and ebbs back again, and is uttered, as it were by

Leaps
. Hence it is, that they, whose
Tongues
be too heavy and
moist, and less voluble, will never pronounce this Letter, whether
they can Hear, or are Deaf.

Now there still remains the
Consonants
, or the Letters, which are
formed out of an unsounding or mute
Breath
; yet, out of which, some
of the
Semi-vowels
may be made, as
g. ch. s. f. v.

As the
Voice
is the common matter of the
Consonants
, the sharper
part of which is (
h
) which is the most simple of them all, and out
of which diversly figurated, the rest of them are framed: And they are
either the
Sibilants
, which are formed out of
Breath
, which is
somewhat compressed or straitned, that the passing
Breath
breaks
forth with a certain kind of
Hissing
, and with violence.

Here
I
judge that we are not to pass over in silence, how that there
are some parts in
Germany
, where there is so much of Affinity of
(
g
) with (
k
,) as (
b
) has with (
p
) and (
d
) with (
t
,) or
where (
g
) is pronounced like (
k
) but softer, so also the
French

do pronounce their (
g
) before
a. o. u.
and
ou.

(
s
) is formed, when the
Teeth
and
Tongue
are so clapt together,
that the
Breath
cannot come forth, but by the
Spaces of the Teeth
:
But (
f
) or (
v
) (which differs not from (
f
) in our Language) is
formed, when the
neather Lip
is so moved to the
Teeth
above, that
the
Breath
must break out thro' the said
Spaces of the Teeth
;

ph.
is (
f
) being a Stranger in the
German
Tongue, and differs
from it only in the
Character
.

The other kind of
Consonants
are explosive; which,
viz.
are
discharged at one push, and as it were, in the twinkling of an Eye and
are nothing else but
Breath
, which being got close together, either
in the fore, middle, or hinder Region of the Mouth, is discharged on a
suddain; and (
k
) is indeed formed in the hinder Region, when the
hinder part of the
Tongue
is moved to the
Roof
, that the
Breath

cannot break forth, neither by the
Mouth
, nor by the
Nose
, but is
suddenly let loose again: For thus the imprisoned
Breath
breaks out,
and by breaking out, maketh
k. c.
or
q.
which in
Germany
are all
the same Letter; in the middle Region are
d.
and t. formed, when,

viz.
the
Breath
, by help of the Tongues being moved to the

Teeth
, or
Roof
, and suddainly drawn back again, being more or less
compressed, rusheth out by its own Springiness, and so
d.
or
t.
is
made, which only differs, as
b.
and
p.
according to the more or
less; in the outermost Region of the
Mouth
are formed, (
b
) and
(
p
) when,
viz.
the
Breath
being compressed in the whole
Cavity
of the Mouth
, they get out through the
Lips
opened.

Lastly; here follows those
Consonants
, which are compounded of

Hissing and Explosion
, such are (
x
) or
ks.
and (
z
) or
ts.

which only are the alone anomalous or irregular ones of the
German

Language; for if I may speak what I think; we might well enough want
these
Characters
; yet I disapprove not of the use of them, but only
shew what might be more convenient,
viz.
that
Voice
or
Breath

which is simple, might be expressed also by a simple
Character
, and
on the contrary, that a
Character
, which is simple and only one,
would signifie but one only
Voice
or
Breath:
But if the commodious
use of
Short-hand
may be objected, I would perswade to express all
possible Combinations, of
Vowels
, with
Semi-vowels
, and

Consonants
, by simple
Characters
.

This is what I determined to say concerning the Letters, and their
Formation; and seeing I am not willing to write a
Grammar
, what
might yet further be said of them, I pass by; but what I have
performed, I leave it to others to judge thereof, not so much to teach
them, as by what is here presented to excite them, being desirous, as
it becomes a young Man, to learn of them: I hope they will pardon my
Errors, because of my Youth. Yet certain I am, had the ancient

Hebrews
,
Greeks
and
Romans
, thus describ'd their Letters, there
would have been no contention about the manner of Pronounciation.

CHAP. III.

Teacheth the Method its self, by which such as are Deaf, and
consequently Dumb, may learn to Speak.

What hath been hitherto said may enough suffice to observant

Readers
, inasmuch as the Fundamentals of the whole Artifice, are
therein contained; but least the curious should complain, that I have
only made their Mouth water, I shall ingeniously discover to them what
in four Years time, wherein I have endeavoured to instruct some Deaf
Persons, I have observed what is worthy, and most necessary to be
known.

Now what I have effected by this my Method, especially to the Daughter
of Mr.
Kolard
, a Merchant of
Harlem
, I can appeal to a great part
of
Holland
, and universally almost to the whole City of
Harlem
,
and to innumerable other Witnesses, of all Ranks and Conditions.

The first thing which I require in the Person I am to teach, is, that
he be of a docible Wit, and not too young of age; than that the

Organs of Speech
be rightly constituted in him; for stupid Persons
are capable of no Teaching, whose Age is yet too tender; nor do they
mind enough, nor know how Teaching will be for their Use and Benefit;
but those whose
Organs of Speech
are altogether unfit, they may
learn indeed to understand others when they speak, and discover their
own Mind by Writing; but they will never learn to speak.

Having therefore a fit subject, my first Care is to make him to sound
forth a
Voice
, without which, almost all labour is lost, but that
one point, whereby Deaf Persons do discern a
Voice
from a
Mute
Breath
, is a great Mystery of Art; and if I may have leave to say so,
it is the
Hearing of Deaf Persons
, or at least equivolent thereunto,

viz.
that trembling Motion and Titillation, which they perceive in
their own
Throat
, whilst they of their own accord do give forth a

Voice
; that therefore the Deaf may know, that I open my Mouth
to
emitt a Voice
; not simply to yawn, or to draw forth a
Mute Breath
,
I put their Hand to my
Throat
that they may be made sensible of that
tremulous Motion, when I utter my
Voice;
then I put the same Hand of
theirs to their own
Throat
, and command them to imitate me; nor am I
discouraged, if at the beginning their
Voice
is harsh and difficult;
for in time it becomes more and more polite.

If I gain their
Voice
, which for the most part I do at the first
time, I soon learn them to pronounce
Vowels
,
viz.
I bid them so to
moderate the
opening of their Mouth
, whilst they do form a
Voice

in their
Throat
, as I have said above, concerning the Formation of
the
Vowels
; but that they may do that the more easily, I hold a

Looking-Glass
to them, because they cannot from Sight alone imitate
those diverse Motions of the
Jaws
, of the
Tongue
, and of the

Lips
, unless they had oftentimes tried it before a Looking-Glass.
Thence I learned, that that common belief, (that so soon as Hearing is
restored to Deaf Persons, they will speak) to be false, for it seems
not to me, that there is so great a consent betwixt the Organs of

Voice
, and of Hearing, that at the first blush they can imitate a

Voice
that is heard; but by often imitating a
Voice
or
Breath

received from another, and also by hearing their own at the same time,
we find at length a likeness between both, and after this manner we
all learn to speak; for he who learns to speak, it is all one, as if
he did learn some other Art; for by a long accustoming, the Organs are
rendered apt and pliable: Hence it is, that sometimes we come not to
pronounce aright Foreign Letters but after a long time. Now, it would
be well observed or considered, that I presently prescribe all the
Letters to Deaf Persons, or else they could not fix in their Minds
their
Idea's
of them, and I seldom teach more than two or three
Letters in one day, least the
Idea's
be confounded; but I bid them
very often to repeat them, and to write them down as they are
pronounced by me.

But if by chance, as it sometimes happeneth, that they should
pronounce one Letter for another; I blame them not, but rather commend
them, and grant with a nodd that they have satisfied me, and forthwith
I write down the Character of that Letter upon Paper, that they may
knit together the
Idea
thereof with its figure. In the interim,
whilst they learn the
Vowels
, I very often put their Hand to my

Throat
, that they may be accustomed to give forth a Sound.

When the
Vowels
are become familiar to them, I go next to the

Semi-vowels
, which sometimes are more difficult, especially the

Nasals
; for Deaf Persons, unless they be taught, never give forth
the
Voice
by the
Nose
, thereupon I begin with [
m.
] as that which
is most plain, and easier learnt than the rest, so that they thereby
may be accustomed to give a Sound at least thro' the
Nose
; therefore
I bid them shut together their
Lips
, and putting their Hand to their

Throat
, to give forth a
Voice
, and by that means they necessarily
pronounce [
m.
] and not [
em.
] as it's vulgarly pronounced.

The Daughter of Mr.
Kolard
, before she was committed to my Care,
could indeed say
Pappa
; for indeed it is a little word, which is
almost born with us; but her Father did confess, that he had more than
1000 times tried in vain to make her say
Mamma
, which yet I I
brought her to in a small time.

And now,
Reader
, I commit to thee another Secret,
viz.
that if a
Deaf Person be committed to thee to teach, beware that you do not
teach him to pronounce together
Semi-vowels
and
Consonants
,
together with their annexed
Vowels
; as for example,
em. en. ka. ef.
te, &c.

For thus they would learn neither to read, nor rightly to pronounce
any word. The power and force of
Semi-vowels
and
Consonants

consists not in the adjoyned
Vowels
, but in a peculiar
Voice
or

Breath
; and when you would have a Deaf Person to say
Tafel
or

Swartz
, you shall hear from him nothing else but
Te. a. ef. e. el.

or
Es. we. a. er. te. zet.
which is very uncouth, nor can you easily
mend it: But by this Method, so soon as ever they know their Letters,
they begin to read; for
to read is only to pronounce the Letters
successively
.

Here note well, that in the Schools this very thing would be of great
use, chiefly when they are taught Languages, whose Letters are
expressed by whole words, as
Alpha, Omega, Gimel, double u, zet, &c.

For more time is lost, and the desire of Learning taken away from
Children, before they are able to abstract the Letters of these
Sounds, and to connect them together in
Reading
; so that it is very
much to be wonder'd at, that this most eminent short way of reading
hath hitherto lain hid in the dark.

The other
Nasalls
[
u
] and [
ng
] have nothing peculiar, unless it
be that I shew the Deaf the posture of the
Tongue
in a
Looking-Glass, and put their Hand to my
Nose
, whereby they may be
sensible, that there comes forth thorough the
Nostrils
a
Sounding
Breath
. When I teach them [
l.
] I bid them to apply the
Tongue
to
the
upper Teeth
; but to the
Cutters
, and to the
Dog-Teeth
only,
that then they may emit a
Voice
thro' the Mouth I make a Sign with
my Hand; but least, instead of [
l.
] they should pronounce [
n.
]
which comes to pass when the
Tongue
doth so hinder the coming forth
of the
Voice
, that it returns to get out by the
Nostrils
;
therefore, till they are better accustomed, I gently compress the

Nostrils
with my Fingers.

The Letter [
r
] is the most difficult of all the rest, yet amongst
six Deaf Persons, which I have hitherto instructed, four of them
pronounce it with the greatest easiness; the other two cannot form it,
but in their Jaws; but I teach them, by moving the Hand one while to
the
Throat
, and another while to the
Mouth
, whereby they may, as
it were, feel the subsulting and interrupted Expulsion of the
Voice
;
also I bid them to look often in the Glass, to observe the tremulous
and fluctuating Motion of the
Tongue
; but no one can expect at the
first trial, the genuin Pronounciation of this Letter.

When the
Vowels
and
Semi-vowels
are well inculcated into them,

the Consonants
are learnt without any trouble almost, for they are a

Simple and Mute Breath
, coming forth, either successively, or
suddenly, according to the various
Openings of the Mouth
, and only
with putting the Hand to the Mouth almost, they may all easily be
learned.

[
h
] is the most simple of all, nor is it any thing else but Air,
which is breathed out thicker, and more swiftly.

[
g
] or
ch.
is sharper than [
h
] which I teach thus, when I shew
to my Deaf Patients the posture of the
Tongue
in a Looking-Glass,
and give them to feel the expiring
Breath
; it is so in like manner
with [
s
] and [
f
] insomuch, as nothing is more easie than they, and
which may most easily be learned by the fore-going Description.

I can teach a Deaf Man, (though he were blind) the
Explosive
Consonants
; for if I cause him to feel the
Breath
discharged upon
him, he would necessarily pronounce one of the three; for I bid him to
look simply on my
Mouth
and
Tongue
, and then having put his Hand
to my
Mouth
, I pronounce either [
k.
] or [
b.
] [
p.
] or [
d.
]
[
t.
] and command him to do the like.

(
x.
) and (
z.
) are pronounced no otherwise than is (
ks.
) or
(
gs.
) (when (
g
) is an
Explosive Consonant
) and (
ts.
) wherefore
I shall add nothing concerning them.

Deaf Persons are to be diligently accustomed to pronounce these

Semi-vowels
,
n. ng. l. r.
also the following
Consonants
;
h. g.
k. t.
with some kind of opening the
Mouth
, else they may joyn them
sometimes with certain
Vowels
, not without a notable yawning, & a
discordant noise. Now in general, Winter-time is fitter almost for to
instruct the Deaf, because then they see the
Breath
coming forth
from the
Mouth
, whilst Pronounciation is in doing.

When therefore I taught any Deaf Person to pronounce the Letters
hitherto enumerated, and that one by one, I taught him so to utter two
or three of the easiest, that there should be interstice between them;
as for example,
ab. am. da. fa. ef. &c.
so that they might be
accustomed to pronounce the Letters successively; then by degrees I
use them to the more difficult Combinations, mutually mixing
Vowels
,

Semi-vowels
and
Consonants
, and thus with little trouble they
learn to read; but if when they have read any thing, I bid them look
upon my
Mouth
, and to repeat the same after it hath been pronounced
by me; for thus they become by degrees to be accustomed to imitate the
humane
Voice
, only by looking on; but I am unwilling to tire them
out with this labour, troublesome enough, until they have profited
much, because they may be frighted with it.

In the mean time we must endeavour diligently; that when one

Consonant
follows another
Consonant
, as
ps. kt. ks. sch. &c.
or
a
Semi-vowel
, as
ls. lk. md. &c.
that they do immediately joyn
them in Pronounciation, least some (
i
) or (
e
) be heard between
them, which unless it be cautiously avoided, often happens.

When they can read, and in a manner understand others when they speak,
I treat them like new-born Babes; first, I teach them
Nouns
, which
are obvious, as well
Substantives
as
Adjectives
, so also the most
necessary
Verbs
and
Adverbs
, than
Declinations
and

Conjugations
; but here that five-fold turning Orb was of most
excellent use to me, it being a rich Treasury of the whole
German

Tongue, which I found in the Mathematical Delights of
Swenter
, I
augmented it, and applied it also to the
Dutch
Idiome; out of it may
they quickly, and with pleasure learn all possible
Combinations
of

Vowels
,
Semi-vowels
, and
Consonants
, also all terminations of

German
words, and that as well Derivatives as Compounds. The first
Orb contains
Prepositions
and small
Mono-Syllables
, with which

Nouns
and
Verbs
are compounded; the second, the
Initial Letters
;
the third,
Vowels
and
Diphthongs
; the fourth, the
Final Letters
;
lastly, all the
German Terminations
.

But there seems to be a great difficulty, that some Letters, as
e.

and
i. a.
and
u.
are uttered by the same opening of the Mouth, and
consequently they must needs be confounded; but in good truth, it's of
small moment, because for the most part the difference is not heeded,
and the Letters, which according to their nature, are by far, more
different, are written almost after the same manner, chiefly when they
are pronounced hastily, as
m.
and
n. r.
and
n. a.
and
o. &c.

which yet puts no stop to an exercised
Reader
.

Others object, that the
Deaf
thus taught, will, it may be,
understand no Body but my self: Indeed, this difficulty Teems to have
something of weight in it; but we must know, that Menst Men pronounce
most Letters badly alike, and write their Characters negligently; but
with such a one who learns to speak, it is all one as it is with him,
who is taught to read other Men's Writings: For first, he can scarce
read any thing but what is written by his Master, and then the
Writings of his School-fellows; and lastly, there is nothing which he
cannot read, tho' very badly written, it is therefore not to be
wondred at, if those I teach to speak, do at the beginning more easily
understand me, than others; (for I pronounce the Letters in their full

extension
) and not
lamely
(as many are wont to do) and after that
they come to understand their Domesticks and Familiars, and at last,
any Body.

Here in the end I add, that most of the Letters may be formed, as well
by inspiring as by expiring, which thing I have very much wondred at
in some Persons, who
speak out of the Belly
: And once at
Amsterdam

I heard an old Woman speaking both ways, and made answers to her self,
as to questions, so as I would have sworn that she talked with her
Husband two or three Paces distant from her; for the
Voice
being
swallowed up in her in Breathing, would seem to come from far.

Behold,
Reader
, a small Tract of three days; if thou wilt offer any
thing more, right and true, I will receive it with thank: There are
yet some other things,
viz.
how a deaf Person may be made, so as to
be able to discern from one the other, some Letters pronounced by
another, as
m.
from
b. n.
from
d. ng.
from
k. &c.
or how the
quantity of Syllables is to be govern'd. But these, and the like, can
scarce be learnt, but by teaching.

A word is enough to the Wise.

THE CONCLUSION.

The
Author
is thinking to turn this small Treatise into the
Dutch
,
and very speedily, God willing, to publish it for the good of the
Nation, and will so adapt it to the Idiom thereof, as to make it to be
accounted proper. Nothing being more in the
Authors
care than that
by this his slender endeavour, he shall stir up some one to perform
the like, or at least to attempt it: Now if there occurs to any Body,
any thing, either too hard, or not sufficiently explained, he may
expect a more full Edition, or else let him repair to the
Author
,
who according to the Light granted unto him, will refuse nothing to
any Man.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
at
www.gutenberg.org
. If you
are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE

In my commissioned service of over thirty-three
years I have spent over twenty-two years with my
regiment and three years in training a battalion of
college cadets. I have been intimately associated
with the national guard of one state and have had
experience with the guard of four other states. I
have seen something of foreign troops in both peace
and war. In these many years I have observed the
methods of training employed by a number of
officers.

Our infantry training has improved over what I
first knew but there still exists in places a lack of
completeness and system. Of late years a much
greater interest than formerly has been taken in the
tactical instruction and training of our officers and
the progress has been marked. The tactician is,
however, but the skilled mechanic; the tools with
which he works are his troops. New recruits are
like the lump of ore, of no use until converted into
steel and then forged into shape. The making of
this tool from the raw material is our principal
business during peace.

[Pg 4]

At the request of officers with whom I have
often talked and corresponded on the subject of
training infantry, this little book of suggestions has
been prepared. It is based on my own experience
and observation and what others have told me of
their work. It is offered by an older officer to his
younger brothers in the infantry in the hope that
it may be of some service to them.

INTRODUCTION

Importance
of
training
infantry

There is nothing more important to an
army than the correct training of its infantry.
The training of all the arms has
much in common, but training infantry,
owing to the manner of its use in battle, calls
for much that is not required in the other
arms.

The infantry soldier must work more independently
than men in the other branches.
He cannot be led or controlled as can men
in groups or close formations; hence he needs
to be more thoroughly instructed in the part
he is to play. This instruction cannot be
given him on the field of battle. The man
who must steadily advance on an enemy in
position requires not only higher training
but higher discipline than one who does his
fighting in close formation, or at long range
and out of sight of the enemy and protected
from hostile fire by steel shields.

The mere mechanical part of the drill of
all the arms is not difficult as regards its
execution on the peaceful drillground but it
requires much training to carry out these
same things on the battlefield.

[Pg 8]

Importance
of
infantry
training

It is reported as an incident in the recent
Balkan War that a general of division, whose
infantry had been reinforced by the addition
of fifty per cent of recruits who had only received
about a monthâs training, prepared for
battle by sending all his new men to the rear,
preferring to fight without them. His division
was successful but the other divisions,
which retained their new men in ranks during
combat, broke and were routed.

War of today is not a game for amateurs.
Infantry to be of any value has not only
to be trained but to be properly and thoroughly
trained. On the part of those in
charge of this training there is necessary an
appreciative understanding of the objects
sought, earnest effort, tact, enthusiasm, and
a real knowledge of men.

[Pg 9]

I

THE ESSENTIAL AND THE DESIRABLE

KNOWLEDGE AND HABIT

Practise
and theory

To ensure the proper training of our infantry
there are needed competent
officersâofficers who know what should be
taught and how to teach it. One sometimes
hears: âHe is a good practical soldier
but he knows nothing of the theory.â Such
an expression is an absurdity. A man may
know the theory yet be unable to apply it or
make practical use of it; we have all seen
such men. But a man cannot practice what
he does not know. The knowledge of theory
required by the junior commander is not
great and the time it takes to learn it is short
compared with the time required to master
its practical application and to instruct properly
a command.

Needs of
the unit
commander

The first requisite for a unit commander
is a knowledge of the fundamental principles
of the tactics of his arm and its employment
in combination with the other arms, especially
with the artillery. He must have a clear
[Pg 10]

conception of the modern battlefield in order
to understand for what he must train his unit.
He must train it for battle conditions, not
peace conditions. A company trained to be
handled exclusively by word of command, as
in a close order drill on the parade ground,
lacks the training that fits for battle.

Needs of
the unit
commander

Essential
and
desirable
instruction

The more the enlisted men know of the
art of war the better. Time is not available
however, to teach them the whole art of war
even if the men in ranks were capable of
mastering it. The instructor must therefore
clearly understand what are the things the
men
must
know and what are merely
desirable

as additions to their training. Every effort
should be spent and all available time devoted
to first perfecting the men in the things
they
must
know; afterwards, if more time is
available, it is well to extend in other directions
their education and training.

Close
order
drill

Under the first heading,
essentials
, the
men must be taught their close order drill.
This is necessary for two reasons: it renders
possible the orderly movement of troops
and it makes for discipline. So far as the
orderly movement of troops is concerned
very little is necessary but without precision
close order drill is of no value towards discipline.
[Pg 11]

To have a disciplinary value, drill
movements must be carried out with exactitude.
Discipline is injured if, when an officer
gives a command at drill, it is only carried
out approximately; the soldier is acquiring
the habit of slighting his work and of doing
an approximation, not the precise duty
demanded of him.

It takes but little longer to learn to execute
correctly the few movements prescribed
than to learn them incorrectly, but it requires
constant attention on the part of the instructor
to maintain exactness. The attention
and effort required on the part of the
instructor are, however, amply compensated
by the results.

Extended
order
drill

The men must know perfectly the mechanism
of the extended order drill. A company
must be able without confusion or mix-up
to form line of skirmishers in the least possible
time from any formation and facing in
any direction. This will necessitate much
practice. It does not take long to learn to
form line of skirmishers quietly, from line or
column of squads, facing to the front; but
that is not sufficient.

Other
essentials

The men must know how to estimate distances,
how to shoot, how to use the bayonet;
[Pg 12]

they must understand patrolling and outpost
duty, the construction of hasty intrenchments,
the application of first aid, how to cook the
ration and how to care for their arms and
equipment.

Especially important is it that the men
know how to march and how to care for themselves
in the field. However well instructed
a soldier may be he is of no use if at the time
of battle he is back in the hospital.

Desirable
instruction

Under the second heading, of things that
it is desirable the men should know, are
subjects which are essential for the officers to
know but which are not equally essential for
the men. Nevertheless it is an advantage to
have them know as much as possible, provided
the merely desirable instruction does
not interfere with the proper training in
essentials. Among these subjects are topography
and the construction of temporary
bridges; the list might be extended almost
indefinitely.

Things to
be understood
and
things to
be made
fixed
habits

The instructor must further distinguish
between the essential things which the men
need merely to know or to understand and
those which need to be practiced until they
become habits. Those things the men will
only be required to do off the battlefield,
[Pg 13]

where they will have time to think and be in
condition to use their heads, need only be
known.

Psychology teaches us that under great
stress of danger and excitement a man can be
depended upon to do only those things which
have become fixed habits, and further, that
under these same trying conditions, a man
who has acquired by practice a habit of doing
something a certain way cannot do that
thing differently. Action contrary to habit
requires thought, and mental activity is
difficult if not impossible under the circumstances.
Acting according to habit is merely
following the line of least resistance.

It is difficult to conceive of greater stress
of danger and excitement than exists in a
modern battle. Certainly there is no other
case in which the knowledge of this psychological
truth can be used to greater advantage
than in training for battle.

Fixed
habits in
battle

As far as possible, then, all those things
which the men must do under fire should be
practiced until they become fixed habits. It
has been said that if in the heat of battle a
man even raises his rifle to his shoulder, before
firing, it shows fair discipline. Not only
must bringing the rifle to the shoulder be made
[Pg 14]

a habit, but correct aiming and trigger pull
whenever the rifle is brought to the shoulder
must be made a habit, and one so strongly
developed that these acts will always be done
mechanically and without mental effort.

Habits of
correct
aiming
and firing

This desired result cannot be accomplished
by two or three weeks a year of target
practice. The training must be continuous
for an extended period. To accomplish it
altogether with ball cartridges would be too
costly and often impracticable. The desired
results can be obtained by pointing and aiming
drills and gallery practice, if these are so
conducted that the men never pull the trigger
without properly bringing the rifle to the
shoulder and looking through the sights at
some target.

A week of continuous work every six
months will not accomplish the results;
frequent short drill periods are necessary.
A man who starts in by smoking three strong
cigars every Christmas and Fourth of July
but not touching tobacco between times will
not be so likely to acquire the smoking habit
as one who starts very moderately and repeats
the act daily. Overdoing any kind of training
at one time, with long intervals between
has a tendency to produce dislike rather than
[Pg 15]

a habit. A few minutes of honest work at
least twice every week, in pointing and aiming
drill and gallery practice, will accomplish
the result desired and my experience
convinces me that it also produces much
better results on the target range than crowding
even more of this practice into the last
month before going on the range. Certainly
it is worth more than the other as a habit-former.

Estimating
the
range

The better a man can shoot when the
range is known to him the more important it
is that his sight elevation be correct. A poor
shot will scatter his bullets and may hit something
even with a wrong elevation but the
accurate shot will not hit anything; yet the
correct range is valuable even to the poor
shot.

On the battlefield we can count only on
our estimate of the range; seldom will it be
practicable to determine it otherwise. Thus
estimating distances has to be made a habit
for two reasons: since habits alone count in
battle, only by making it a habit can we
depend on its being done; and second, it requires
constant practice to enable men to
estimate distances with fair accuracy.

Devoting two or three consecutive days
[Pg 16]

annually to estimating distances is almost a
waste of time; practice should be had every
week. I have seen both methods used and I
am certain as to their relative values. How
this instruction should be given will be
mentioned later.

The deployments, advancing the attack,
working by signals, taking advantage of
cover, and in fact everything pertaining to
combat from the opening of fire until the end
of the battle must be practiced until it becomes
a fixed habit on the part of the men.

The
officer
as instructor

If we are to have good infantry the officers
as instructors must be competent, have an
appreciation of relative values, be able to distinguish
between what is essential and what
is merely desirable and make sure of essentials
before spending time on the latter. Each
officer must realize fully what has only to be
known and what must be made fixed habit
and govern his work accordingly.

Hints as
to instruction
work

Now a few hints as to the instruction work.
Never do this work in a perfunctory manner.
Always have in mind what you want to teach
and how you are going to do it. Put your
heart in your work.

I have seen a well drilled company go to
pieces under an officer who gave his commands
[Pg 17]

in an indifferent manner and who
gave too much âplace rest.â The spirit of
indifference is contagious as well as the spirit
of enthusiasm. If you have no keen interest
simulate it and you will find it grow into
the real thing. Remember that you are paid
for good work and if you do not give this kind
of service you are obtaining money fraudulently.

But not only have you yourself to keep interested;
if the best results are to be obtained
you must keep up the interest of your
men. Nothing kills interest like monotony.
There are so many things to be taught and
there is so great an opportunity for variety
that there is no excuse for not keeping the
men interestedly busy for four hours a day.

Make clear to the men in the instruction
work, particularly in the field training, not
only the object sought but the why and
wherefore. In maneuvers always explain
the problem to them so far as is necessary to
make them understand what the command is
trying to do, where the enemy is supposed to
be, and the rest. They will respond not only
by taking more interest but by doing their
part much better.

I have seen a flank patrol out at a maneuver
the leader of which knew nothing of
[Pg 18]

the supposed situation and had been given no
instructions, except to act as left flank patrol.
What interest could he be expected to take in
the maneuver? How could he be counted
on properly to perform his duty?

Callisthenic
drill

I believe in carrying out this principle
even in the callisthenic drill. Explain to the
men the object of each movement, what muscle
is to be developed by it and its advantage.
Doing this makes this work much
more profitable to the men as well as more
interesting. It will also prevent our seeing
these movements so executed as to deprive
them of all their intended value.

Appeal
to the
intelligence
of
the men

In other words, treat the men being instructed
as the intelligent men they are.
They will both learn faster and do better
work when they fully understand what is to
be done and the reason why. A horse must
be simply made to do certain things in a
given way; it is a tedious process and a horse
never does know much. Men trained as
soldiers on the same plan as the horse give results
out of all proportion to the time and
effort spent. Why not, therefore, make use
of the manâs intelligence and simply help him
train himself?

[Pg 19]

II

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF TIME

In this country we cannot follow literally
any of the systems of training adopted by
the great military powers: our whole military
system is too different. We can, however,
profit by their experience and, if we
translate, not the literal text of their regulations
but the spirit, gain much. It is essential
that any scheme of instruction adopted should
be suited to our organization, method of
recruitment and the various conditions
surrounding our service.

Requisites
of a
system of
training

The work must be so planned as to utilize
all the available time of the year and in that
time to cover all the absolute essentials of
instruction. In this utilization of the time
schools for non-commissioned officers and
officers must be included. There is much
ground to be covered during the year and
unless the time be wisely apportioned it
cannot be done.

There is much of the work that can be
done indoors; other work can only be done
[Pg 20]

outside. Our troops are so widely scattered
and under such varying climatic conditions
that the distribution of time cannot profitably
be the same for all.

Winter
and
summer
work

Schools

Each post should make its own schedule.
The work in each post must, however, be uniform.
For example, in the northern part of
the United States the yearâs training should
begin November 1st and end October 31st.
All the instruction that can be given during
the winter months, should be given, leaving
the rest for the open season. The schools for
both officers and non-commissioned officers
are held during the indoor season; the work
done in them should dovetail in with the
general scheme of instruction. Particular
care should be exercised with respect to the
non-commissioned officersâ schools; in them
the non-commissioned officers should be
taught thoroughly how to play their part in
the varied work in the field and be given the
reasons for things.

Simply repeating the words of a book
should be avoided; teach them to do things.
The company commander who is capable
and in earnest can do much in winter toward
training his company even in garrisons where
weather conditions are the worst.

[Pg 21]

Methods
of winter
instruction

Most of the captains of one regiment
known to me have been doing good work
during the past two years in teaching the
principles of the conduct of patrols and
covering detachments. Some of them made
use of the Stacey Relief Map; others simply
built a sand table about ten feet by five.
On this the sand was moulded to form hills
and valleys. Blue strings were laid down for
streams, yellow ones for roads. Miniature
bridges were constructed and placed where
desired. Small twigs were used to make
forests.

By means of practical examples worked
out on these made or improvised maps the
principles were thoroughly taught and more
easily than is possible out of doors; when
spring came, only a few exercises on the
ground were necessary to make these companies
proficient.

Entrenching

Another use made of the sand table was
in the teaching of entrenching. Bull Durham
tobacco sacks were converted into sand
bags and the men taught their use in revetting,
loop-holing, etc. Similarly on a miniature
scale were taught the preparation of headlogs,
the making of gabions, facines and
hurdle revetment. Brush work thus taught
[Pg 22]

indoors needs only be followed by one outdoor
exercise, in which work is done on the
scale actually used in the field, in order to
render the company proficient.

Gymnasium

Where the post is so fortunate as to be
provided with a gymnasium full advantage
should be taken during the winter season of
the opportunities for physical training which
it affords. The physical development of the
men is most important. Where no gymnasium
is available a well-planned course in
callisthenics is the best substitute and should
be used. Callisthenics to music or for pure
show should be prohibited.

First aid
Signalling

The indoor season must be fully utilized
to save the full time of the outdoor season
for that training which can only be given
then. Instruction in such subjects as first
aid and signalling naturally is given at this
time. A place for gallery practice can
always be rigged up.

Estimating
distances

The foundation for estimating distances
must be laid, and there should be practice in
it every week, during the closed season. In
this work the whole company should be employed
together only for the first one or two
exercises when the principles are being explained;
after that a platoon or less at a
[Pg 23]

time. Near each barracks there should be
two stakes one hundred yards apart and so
placed that the men see them every time the
company forms. This is their unit of measure
and cannot become too familiar to them.

The captain or someone designated by
him selects a couple of distances to be estimated.
Each subdivision of the company
then goes out in turn and upon completing
the exercise returns and another goes out.

The men must be taught to estimate distances
both from themselves to a given point
and between two points, both at some distance
from them. The latter is necessary in
their patrol work in estimating lengths of
column and frontages occupied. If the estimating
be conducted in this way the weather
will make little difference; the men dress suitably
for it and are out only a short time.
The work to be of value must be done under
varying conditions of light.

There should be no week in the year in
which this exercise is not conducted. In
summer it should be done on the days when
the company is away from the garrison on the
weekly practice march; there is ample time
for it during the long halt.

This work can be conducted so as only to
[Pg 24]

take about fifteen minutes of each manâs
time per week. It is well worth it. I have
seen the above plan carried out intelligently
in two or three companies and the results
were remarkably good; the ability of the
men to estimate distance was better than
that given for musketry school graduates in
foreign services. On the other hand I have
seen it indifferently carried out and, like
most indifferent work, it was a waste of time.

Position
and
aiming
drills,
gallery
practice

Position and aiming drills and gallery
practice must be a weekly occurrence and
holding them twice a week will be better.
If the detachments are made small enough
gallery practice requires but little time for
each man. It is important in conducting
this practice to see that no man ever fires a
score in a careless or indifferent manner; if
this is permitted the result obtained will be
the opposite of that desired. I found one
very effective means of preventing such careless
work: a man found guilty of careless
firing was required to repeat his scoreâbut
not at that time when it would delay the
regular course. He had to remain near the
gallery until I, or someone designated by me,
came around to supervise his firing and it was
usually some little time before I got around.

[Pg 25]

Bayonet
fencing

Throughout the year careful attention
should be given to bayonet fencing. I do not
believe that there is much probability of a
bayonet contest in war but, for psychological
reasons, this training is necessary. Positions
are carried by the bayonet, but past experience
shows that in such charges the bayonets
seldom crossed and when they did it was
a ârough and tumble.â Our men may go in
with the best intentions in the world to use
the bayonet according to rule, yet the chances
are that, in the excitement of the mÃ©lee, habit
will assert itself and the gun become a bat.

Nevertheless, troops are very seldom
âshot out of a positionâ; the imminent
threat of the bayonet is necessary; but, as
the opposing bayonets get close, one side or
the other weakens.

Kind of
bayonet
required

It would be folly to expect men without
bayonets to charge an enemy with long and
sharp ones, or to expect them without bayonets
to stand a charge by an enemy armed
with such weapons, even though, if they had
bayonets, they would be likely to club their
rifles. The moral effect of a line of bayonets
is great.

Infantry should be armed with the best of
bayonets, long and, in war time, razor
sharp. The men must have confidence in
[Pg 26]

their ability to use them with skill and effect;
otherwise they will neither charge nor stand
the enemyâs charge. At that stage of the
fight success largely depends on the confidence
of the individual man in his power to
win.

Amount
of
bayonet
practice

Bayonet fencing should be continuous
throughout the year. At least one-half-hour
weekly should be devoted to it and during
the indoor season extended and careful instruction
should be given to groups not
larger than a squad. During the outdoor
season this instruction should be so arranged
as not to interfere with the regular drills.

Division
into
sections
for instruction

The company should be divided into
sections that can be handled conveniently
for the instruction work. The success of the
indoor work largely depends on keeping the
sections small enough.

This is especially necessary in first aid
and sandtable work. If the sections are too
large at estimating distance and gallery
practice it results in too much idle standing
around.

Changing
sections

The sections must be changed from one
class of work to another before the work drags
or the men become tired of it. Give them
variety.

[Pg 27]

Selecting
instructors

The captain must exercise care in selecting
the instructors for the various subjects.
The man who will do it the best should be
the instructor in each. Perfunctory or indifferent
work should never be allowed on the
part of an instructor or by the man being
instructed.

The
captain

The capable, intelligent and honest captain
will utilize the indoor season to the great
benefit of his company and of his government.
He will discover the best ways and
means of instructing his own particular men.
The incompetent captain, lacking average intelligence,
will accomplish nothing under any
circumstances.

Initiative
in the
instruction
work

As much latitude as practicable should be
given to subordinate commanders in carrying
out any system of instruction and they
should be held strictly responsible for results.
A scheme in which there is laid down just
how each thing is to be taught, and how much
time and what time is to be devoted to it, is
radically wrong. We need to develop our
officers as well as our men. The conditions
are different at different posts. The needs
of different companies at the same posts
are varied. Each captain should know just
how much time he has and what is absolutely
[Pg 28]

required of him in that time. He should
then be allowed to work out his own solution
of the problem.

When every detail is prescribed the officer
has no initiative, his interest is diminished,
he thinks less, exercises less responsibility,
and his work is not so good. If that policy
be kept up long enough the subordinate officer
will never do anything without positive instructions.
An officer who exercises no
judgment is of no value in war.

The
regiment
a team

But absolute liberty for the subordinate
to do as he pleases is impracticable. The
regiment is a team of which his unit is only
one member. There must be team play and
every member must know and be able to do his
part. The company must be taught certain
things or it will not fit into the battalion
team; the battalion must be fitted for the
regimental team. Each larger unit must
have time for training and has a right to
demand that each lower unit which forms a
part of it shall have accomplished its own
special work on time and be ready to play its
part in the work of the larger unit.

The
colonel

The colonel is responsible for the training
of his regiment. He should allot the
time, supervise the work and see that every
[Pg 29]

member of the team is ready. He is the best
judge of the requirements of his regiment.
But the colonel should do this so as to leave
all the liberty practicable to subordinate
commanders.

Orders
and restriction

If all our captains were competent and
reliable this work of the colonel would be
very simple. But there are a few captains,
unfortunately, who are far from the best,
whose long suit at drill is âplace restâ and
having a sergeant drill the company in Buttsâ
Manual. While more restrictions are necessary
for such captains these restrictions do
not hamper the others; they merely prohibit
things the right kind of captain would
never think of doing or require what he would
never think of omitting.

Time to
organizations

Of course most of the instruction time belongs
to the companies; it is in them that most
of the work must be done. Four well trained
companies under a competent major can be
made into a well trained battalion in a very
few days, and the time required for each
higher unit is less than that for the one next
below.

Time to
target
practice

To the company belongs all the indoor
season. In dividing the rest of the year for
the northern part of the U. S. I believe that
[Pg 30]

the available time from April 1st to October
1st should be allotted in the proportion of 4
days to the company for each 2 to the battalion
and 1 to the regiment. The month of
October should be devoted to maneuvers and
to work in higher units. The time spent on
the target range is excluded in computing the
available time but no company should be
allowed to devote more than two weeks to
target practice exclusive of field firing; of the
latter we can hardly get too much. It is
appreciated that conditions at various posts
make different schedules necessary.

In the past we have seen the training done
in a back-handed way: work in the higher
units first, finally down to the company and
soldier. This is so unlikely to occur in future
that its evil results are not worth mentioning.

Time to
close
order
drill

Too much time should not be devoted to
close order drill, especially during the outdoor
season. An hour a day for the first five
or six drills and thereafter fifteen minutes a
day is ample. There should always be,
however, at least ten minutes a day of snappy,
precise close order work; this together with
the ceremonies will keep the companies up
to the standard. Too much close order drill
becomes monotonous; when that happens the
[Pg 31]

command fails to improve even if it does not
deteriorate.

Length of
drills

The drills during the indoor season should
be two hours long; for the rest of the year
not less than three and generally from four to
six hours daily.

III

FIRE SUPERIORITY

We are told that in battle we must have
fire superiority to win; and fire control
and direction are held as important. I
doubt if these terms are fully understood by
all. A hope to aid some of our younger
officers to a better understanding of these
terms, and of the vital importance of fire
distribution, is the excuse for this chapter.

Fire
effectiveness
in
battle

A line of men firing with the rifle, if not
disturbed or endangered by the fire of an
enemy, can do approximately target practice
work. Now let a heavy fire be opened on
them, one that is fairly accurate and well
placed, and their work falls off very greatly;
the heavier the fire they are subjected to
the less effective becomes their own fire.

Careful study and research by competent
men of foreign armies leads to the conclusion
that if this line, when not under fire, could
make 280 hits in a given time, subjected to a
heavy, well placed fire its effectiveness would
fall to
1
/
40
or
1
/
70
; that is, from 280 hits
to 7 or 4.

[Pg 33]

This looks extreme at first thought; but
what captain with a good company but would
know that he could deploy his company at
from 800 to 1000 yards from a line of lying
down figures and get a hit for at least every
10 shots. Yet history tells us that it takes
from 1200 to 2000 shots in battle to put a man
out of action. In the light of these facts our
first figures look very moderate.

With our present infantry arm an advance
against a hostile line doing 280 work is impossible.
Bring the enemyâs effectiveness
down to the four and keep it there and you
can advance and win.

Fire superiority does not mean that you
are firing more shots than the enemy, it does
not mean he is firing less than you; it means
that your fire has become so close and effective
that he has lost his nerve and is shooting
wildly.

Fire distribution

To obtain this fire superiority certain
things are necessary. We must have proper
fire distribution. To explain this let us assume
that a hostile line is 200 yards long,
that our force is the stronger. We concentrate
our fire on the right half of the hostile
line, leaving the other half untouched. The
effectiveness of the fire of half of this line remains
[Pg 34]

at 280, the other half falls to 2, average
141; our advance is impossible. We now
cover the entire target and its fire effectiveness
falls to 7; our advance is possible.

Fire superiority is possible, then, only if
we have fire distribution. It is not sufficient
to fire a certain number of shots at part of the
line, the whole hostile line must be subjected
to a nerve racking fire to reduce the effectiveness
of its fire.

Another thing to be considered is that
the enemy will conceal himself as much as
possible. On a large part of the hostile
line no one will be seen; men will be hidden
by tufts of grass, bushes, etc. But while
this cover conceals the enemy from our view,
he sees our location and his fire is not interrupted.
There is a strong tendency to
shoot only at the men that can be seen. This
must be overcome; much of our firing must
be aimed at a locality, although unseen
the enemy is nevertheless there and his fire
effectiveness must be kept down. Our fire
must be distributed to cover every part of
the hostile line whether the enemy is seen or
not.

Fire
control

To secure this fire distribution we must
be able to direct the fire of our men, to place
[Pg 35]

it where wanted. But direction necessarily
implies control; you can not direct what you
cannot control. Thus a fire control system
which will work on the battlefield is a primary
requisite to success.

Fire
discipline

Another term used is fire discipline. The
word fire adds nothing to its meaning; but
discipline is vital to success. No matter
what your system of control, if the men do
not respond with prompt obedience it is
worthless. Disciplined men can be counted
on to do what is wanted if they know how,
others cannot. There is no fire discipline
distinct from other military discipline.

To sum up: fire superiority is necessary
to success, to attain fire superiority we must
properly distribute our fire, to do this we
must be able to control and hence direct it,
and this can only be done if our men are
disciplined. An attack with raw troops is
possible only against still poorer ones.

Method
of fire
control

Our fire control and direction needs more
explanation. A method must be had which
will work on the battlefield. No one who has
seen a modern battle will think for a moment
that it is practicable to control and direct a
firing line by verbal orders. A battalion
commander must be far enough to the rear
[Pg 36]

to observe his entire line. In the noise of a
real battle his voice could not be heard ten
yards by men on the firing line. The same
is equally true of company and platoon
commanders. These officers cannot be running
up and down the line giving instructions;
if they tried it they would not last long.

Use of
signals

Our method must therefore be one that
can be executed independently of the voice
and with as little exposure of the officers as
practicable. The method by signals given
in our I. D. R. answers the requirements.
The text of it can be learned in a few minutes,
but to train a battalion so that it will fully
respond under danger requires hours of practice:
it is one thing that must become a
habit.

After the mechanism of the drill is learned
officers should conduct their line as in battle
by signals only. Do not teach men to expect
you to be running up and down the line
personally correcting errors and giving directions,
leading them to expect this to be done
in battle. The effect of a decided change in
conduct when danger is present is apt not to
be good. Moreover, the command will not
respond to signals alone on the battlefield
if, in instruction work, they have never been
[Pg 37]

taught to depend on them exclusively. We
should do everything at battle exercises just
as nearly as possible as it will be done in
battle.

I have seen at battle exercises men stand
up in the open and wave their flags to give
the signals. This is absurd. In battle it
would be needlessly dangerous, would give
the enemy too much information, and it is
unnecessary. The necessary signals in the
battalion can be given by a man lying on the
ground with a handkerchief, or flag without
the staff, and be seen for the short distances
separating the major from his captains or
the captain from his platoon commanders.
Practice alone is required to enable this to be
done efficiently. It must be so done in battle
and must therefore be drilled that way.

It should be remembered that the new
semaphore code recently adopted does not
apply to these signals. The new code requires
men to stand; the old must be used
for these battle signals.

Additional
signals

Additional signals to those given in the
I. D. R. may be taught and used in companies.
It is doubtful if they are necessary and if not
necessary they are wrong. The more signals
you have, the more chance of mistakes.
[Pg 38]

Signals for forming squad or platoon columns
are unnecessary. These movements are not
executed close to the enemy nor when your
line is firing, hence verbal commands are practicable
and when practicable are desirable,
are surer and easier.

Signals are necessary when your line has
commenced the fire fight but from there on few
commands are necessary; there are so few
things that can be ordered, the time for
maneuver and instruction is past. One or
two of those given might be dispensed with
and one for fixing bayonets should be added;
possibly there are one or two others that
should be added.

Observing
fire effectiveness

We have discussed how to obtain fire
superiority; how may we know when we have
it, if the volume of the enemyâs fire remains
practically the same? Company and platoon
commanders must watch for the effect
of the enemyâs fire, where his bullets are
striking. If the hostile bullets are going
wild, some striking far short, others way
high, and very few are effective, you have
fire superiority; that is the time to gain
distance to the front. On the other hand,
although you may be suffering no loss, you
see that the enemyâs bullets, well massed,
[Pg 39]

are striking, say 50 yards in your front; you
have no fire superiority; the enemy has simply
underestimated the range and your advance
will bring you into the center of his beaten
zone. But this is your opportunity to gain
fire superiority. Your men are suffering
little or no loss, should be less affected and
should do better work. If this opportunity
is well utilized you will gain fire superiority.

When you have fire superiority you must
push the advance, take full advantage of your
opportunity; if you temporarily lose it,
suspend the advance until you regain the
necessary superiority.

Distribution
of
fire

Fire properly distributed is one essential
to gaining fire superiority. Proper distribution
means it is placed
on
the target and on
all of the target, not just one part. Placing
our fire on the target requires that our men be
at least fair shots, have their nerve and know
the range. To cover all the target rather
than concentrate on a part is not easy and to
attain practical efficiency in this requires
skill and practice.

In the deployment for battle the division
is generally given a specific mission, the
division commander assigns to each brigade
its part of the task, and so on down to the
[Pg 40]

battalion, company, platoon and even squad.

There is little involved in the larger
units except the tactical skill to know how to
use the larger units to gain the required end;
dividing the terrain is easy. It is difficult
with the commanders of the smaller units;
the division of the target generally becomes
harder the smaller the subdivision. The
major must divide his target, say between
two companies, and do it so that there can
be no mistake on the part of the captains
as to just what part each is to cover. The
company commander must then divide his
section among his platoons and the latter
often among the squads.

The
captainâs
problems

The battalion commander has only one
difficultyâto find a way to make each captain
clearly understand where is the division of
target and where its extreme limit. The
company commander has a shorter line to
divide and has to divide it into more parts.
Landmarks are not so common as he will then
desire.

The captain has another problem in this
connection: shall he divide his target into
four parts and assign each platoon a separate
part, or into two parts and give two platoons
the same target, i. e., 1st and 3d the right
[Pg 41]

half, 2d and 4th the left half? The captain
has not only the problem of finding proper
dividing points in the target, but he must
divide and allot the target so as to get the best
fire effect. It might happen, as I once saw
in a field firing problem, that the right platoon
could not see the corresponding part of
the target, hence was given the other extreme
flank and the rest of the target divided accordingly.
It is not the division alone, but
what is the best division and allotment, that
must be considered.

Practice
in distributing
the
target

This will all be more clearly understood if
you will go in the country and assume a regiment
is ordered to attack a certain line under
certain conditions, and then give the colonelâs
attack order, from that take each
majorâs target and divide it between the
companies and then divide each company
target. This should, of course, always be
done at the same distance from the target
that you would have to make the distribution
if a real enemy were there. You should have
two or three men with you to act as the
subordinates in each case and to determine
whether the division is fully and perfectly
understood. It is easy on a map, but often
very difficult on the ground; distinctive marks
are sometimes very scarce.

[Pg 42]

Each commander should practice this,
devising a method for himself that will work.
Officers alone or together in small groups
should practice it as a sort of tactical walk.
But primarily it should be done in each unit:
the colonel should take the majors on such a
tactical walk; the majors their captains; the
captains their platoon commanders. Estimating
distance should be worked in the
same exercise.

For the companies this is good work for
the indoor season. There are days when work
can be planned for the company that does
not require the presence of the captain or of
most of his officers and non-commissioned
officers; these can then utilize the drill period
as above described. It may be made a real
tactical walk with special stress laid on the
division and allotment of the target.

Assistance
of
artillery

It must be borne in mind that in most
cases the artillery will play a large part in the
gaining and maintaining of fire superiority.
But this fact does not alter the work of the
infantry; we must still do most of the killing
and unnerving of the enemy and this is true
whether the enemy consists of infantry alone
or of infantry in conjunction with artillery.

In this chapter the first part is much like
[Pg 43]

âright line strategyâ mathematics applied to
a battlefield where little is subject to such
treatment. But that seemed the easiest and
simplest way to make clear to beginners terms
that must be fully understood. It is hoped
that that part of the chapter will be understood
as meant, as offering merely a means of
illustration and not as implying that a battle
can be worked out with mathematical precision.

[Pg 44]

IV

COMBAT

War, according to Clausewitz, is the continuation
of diplomacy. Diplomacy
is not always able to settle international disputes,
then the army must do what the
diplomats have failed to accomplish. In our
own history it has been the mass of the people
who have forced our wars, and who, in the
case of a strong public sentiment arising, will
involve us again. On account of the state
of preparedness of most great nations and
because of the enormous cost of modern war,
wars are shorter than formerly.

Object
of an
army

If this country becomes involved in a war
with a military power it will be impracticable
to learn the art of war and train an army
after the outbreak; the war will not last long
enough. The object of having an army
is for war not for peace, and the battles
alone really decide the issue; the battles
are not numerous but each tends one
way or the other to end the struggle. Great
armies exist for many years between wars
and are then trained for these few days of
[Pg 45]

battles which determine the fate of the
nation. The whole aim of an army should
be to be ready for war and the success or failure
in war is determined by a few days of
battle. Untrained troops are of no value on
the modern battlefield.

Training
for
battle

Part of our close order drill, the ceremonies
and some other things we teach, are
accessories and, if given their proper place,
are of value, but the battlefield is the crucial
test; by our fitness for that must our training
be judged. The work of generals and the
general staff is vitally important but the best
plan will accomplish nothing if there are no
trained companies to carry out their part.

In this chapter is considered the training
necessary for combat. This is the work
executed under the severest strain and under
the greatest difficulties of leadership and
control. This training must be thorough
and the things in combat which have to be
done must become a habit.

THE COMPANY

Extended
order
practice

The first essential is that the men must
know the mechanism of the extended order
drill, including all signals used. To keep control
of the skirmish line in battle, that is to
[Pg 46]

maintain such order therein that it can be
directed and used as desired, is far from easy.
Excitement and confusion, especially in the
last stages of the combat, are apt to occur.
Everything possible must be done to preserve
organization and control.

Much depends upon the start; if there
is confusion at the start and the squads get
mixed, success is more than doubtful. In the
majority of cases the deployment will be
made quietly at long range, but not in all.
The company must be drilled until able
to deploy from all formations, facing in any
direction, in the least time practicable, and
without any confusion or mix-up.

Calmness
in giving
orders

The captain who can give all his orders
and commands at the start of a fight in a
calm, unexcited manner has a great advantage
over the one whose voice or manner indicates
excitement. This calm manner
should be cultivated during training. As
good a way as I know for such training is to
have a few men to represent hostile forces
conceal themselves at various points in a
moderately close country; march the company
through this terrain and, as the represented
enemy appears, form skirmish line
facing the supposed enemy, give the range
[Pg 47]

and the commands for opening fire in the
least possible time. The captain himself
should not know where the represented enemy
will appear. This is training for the captain
and also excellent practice for the company.

Restoring
order

Occasionally during an advance points are
reached where a company is sheltered from
fire. Advantage should always be taken of
such opportunities to reÃ«stablish perfect
order, replace fallen leaders and thus get a
new start. Such an opportunity decidedly increases
your chance of success in battle; real
control is reÃ«stablished. Practice this in
your battle training when the opportunity
offers, but never do it when, in a real combat,
it would be impracticable.

Combat
exercises

After the mechanism of the extended order
drill is understood all combat exercises should
have a problem or situation. These should
always be simple; elaborate tactical problems
for this instruction work are unnecessary.
For a simulated attack as part of a line, all
that is necessary is a statement that the
enemy, a regiment of infantry, is holding the
line from ââ to ââ, our regiment is to
attack it at once, our battalion on the right,
we are the right company, our target or objective
the part of the line from ââ to
[Pg 48]

ââ. This of course should be varied but
need be no more complicated. The captain
should give this to his whole company, let all
the men know what they are supposed to be
doing.

Situation
and
orders

Method
of conducting
exercises

The captain should then give his attack
order, always carefully distributing the target.
For a company operating alone the following
form will answer every purpose: This
company belongs to a division engaged with
a hostile division five miles north of here.
This company was detached to capture that
building (pointing) which is assumed to be
important. The defending force occupies the
line ââ. The order for the attack then
follows. Usually in such a case, a small
support would be held out. Of course the
problems will vary according to what it is desired
to teach. Always distribute the target
and let the men understand what you are
trying to do. All combat exercises should be
conducted as nearly as possible as though the
enemy were real. Allow nothing to be done
that would not be attempted were it real war,
otherwise you do not give instruction but
misinformation. After the mechanism is
taught, the captain and platoon commanders
must conduct themselves in combat exercises
[Pg 49]

as they would under hostile fire, keep close
to the ground, use signals only. After the
exercise is over have a critique, point out the
errors made and tell the command how they
should be corrected.

You must expect that if mistakes are
made at the drill they will be made in battle;
to correct these mistakes you should use only
those means at drill that will be practicable
in battle. The captain needs much practice in
thus handling a skirmish line and those under
him need more practice before the company
can be well handled in this manner.

Means
of representing
enemyâs
fire

The effectiveness of the enemyâs fire
should be indicated that platoon commanders
can practice the control of rushes. The
simplest way to do this that I have found is to
have a man at the hostile position with two
little flags. Holding both of these vertically
over his head means the enemyâs fire is wild
and nearly harmless. One flag vertical the
other horizontal indicates a moderately
effective fire. Both flags horizontal indicates
the maximum effectivenessâthat the enemy
has a decided fire superiority. When both
flags touch the ground it indicates no fire.

The advance of the attacking force is only
practicable by taking advantage of the times
[Pg 50]

when the fire is ineffective or weak to push
forward, and, when the hostile fire is too
strong, shooting to gain fire superiority.
Platoon commanders and men must become
accustomed to seizing these opportunities to
advance and suddenly getting down when
there is a burst of effective fire. The flags
on the hostile position may be controlled by
an instructor, stationed behind the company
officers, indicating how the flags are to be
held.

Remember that the hostile fire becomes
more effective in proportion as ours is less
effective. If we have the most men we
should gain fire superiority if our shots are
well placed. If the firing line has not distributed
its fire properly the instructor causes
both flags to be held horizontally; no advance
is then possible until the company
officers find out the cause of the trouble and
correct it. The same is done whenever a
serious error in sight elevation is made.
Majors should frequently conduct such exercises
with their companies. The company
officers must become quick in determining
why the hostile fire is more effective than suits
existing conditions and learn to correct the
error.

[Pg 51]

Judging
defects in
firing

You may not be able to reduce the effectiveness
of the hostile fire so that an advance
under it is practicable and, in some cases, it
may not be your mission to do so; but in every
case where the hostile fire passes a certain
point of effectiveness, depending on relative
numbers, your range, distribution or something
is wrong, or else your men have lost
their nerve. Judging the effect of the hostile
fire is something in which company and platoon
commanders must be proficient, but off
the battlefield this can only be taught in
theory.

Advance
by
rushes

In advancing the attack by rushes the size
of the fraction rushing will be dependent upon
the relative proportion of rifles necessary
to hold your fire superiority. If rushes are
practicable at all it will seldom be necessary
to rush by smaller units than the platoon.
But an advance will sometimes have to be
made by fractions of only a man or two and
sometimes by crawling. All these should be
taught.

When the enemy is active the rushes
should not be long, if of only 25 or 30 yards
the time the men are actually running will
be very short, too short for the average
man to pick up the target, raise the rifle to his
[Pg 52]

shoulder and fire with careful aim. Too
much time is taken by the average man in
getting up and down. The men must be
practiced in springing to their feet and
getting down again in the shortest time
possible. There is a knack in this not difficult
to acquire.

Reinforcements

Reinforcing a firing line will generally
bring about intermingling of squads and platoons.
To avoid this by closing in on the
center by companies, thus creating gaps for
reinforcements, is impracticable on a battlefield
when reinforcing is necessary. In battle
in the great majority of cases reinforcements
will go in as they can and fall into the existing
gaps where found. As this will be the rule in
battle we should so drill it.

When the next rush is made, say by squads,
where do these reinforcements go? In one
regiment at least, they solved it satisfactorily.
The points of division along the firing line
remain where they were; the new man who
joins the firing line always goes with the
man on his right, he belongs to the squad and
to the platoon of the man on his right. This
provision should be added in the I. D. R.

Mixing
on the
firing line

In teaching the mechanism of the extended
order, practice should be had in this
[Pg 53]

by dividing the company into firing line and
support and then feeding in the support and
continuing the advance by rushes. If you
expect this to be done in battle it must become
a habit. To get the best practice in this
mixing, as well as to train officers and sergeants
to think quickly and to act properly,
there should be many rencontre engagements
so planned as to bring about a mixing of units
on the firing line.

Practice
at war
strength

Some practice should be afforded with
companies at war strength. This can be had
by combining two or more companies. By
this means it is sought to accustom officers
to the fronts and depths of such a company
and also to the greater length of time required
to change formation.

Redistributing
the target

In combat exercises of the company alone
practice must be had in shifting part of the
fire to new targets and redistributing the old.
In large battles this will seldom if ever be required
by men in the firing line, but it will
occur in detachment work. The companies
should get practice in this and it can be well
coupled with the instruction in hasty deployments
suggested on page
46
.

Work
on the
defensive

Some work should be done on the defensive.
A few men should be detailed to
[Pg 54]

represent the enemy; if the man carries one
little flag he represents a squad, if two flags a
platoon. These men should be in charge of a
competent man who as nearly as is practicable
directs their advance as such units would
really advance under the assumed conditions.
Enveloping movements and surprise
attacks can thus be well simulated,
giving the company the opportunity to practice
meeting such movements by the use of
the support, redistribution of targets, etc.

Company
against
company

The instruction against an outlined enemy
having been practiced until the companies
are well instructed, the enemy should be represented,
one company should work against
another. This gives an opportunity for reconnaissance
work before and during the
attack and introduces the elements of uncertainty
as to what the enemy will do.

Night operations

In war, night operations are inevitable
and we must recognize this fact and prepare
for them. Night marches by large commands,
patrolling by both large and small groups,
and outpost work, including the establishing
of the outpost in the dark, will all occur as
well as an occasional night battle. In all
this work the principal difficulty seems to be
to avoid confusion and mistakes.

[Pg 55]

Orientation

The men, especially those who are city
bred, are unable to orient themselves in the
dark. The darkness when coupled with
possible unseen foes has a demoralizing effect
and this effect will be the greater the more
helpless the man feels himself to be in the dark
and the less confidence he has in the ability
of the company to act as a company. Much
of this difficulty can be overcome by a little
careful training.

The men should be taken out and taught
to orient themselves by the stars and prominent
features that can be distinguished at
night. The effects of different backgrounds
on the visibility of objects should be demonstrated,
and especially the prominence of objects
on a skyline. Estimating distance by
sound should be practiced. The men
grouped into small patrols should be made to
find their way from place to place and then
to operate against other patrols.

Night
drill

The company should be drilled at night.
Forming line from column, front into line, on
right or left into line, and even forming line of
skirmishers, should be practiced and an occasional
night march made. A very few
drills each season, held at night instead of in
daylight, will do much toward giving the men
[Pg 56]

that necessary confidence in the ability of
the company to work together in the dark.

It will sometimes happen that a command
will have to go into camp after dark and establish
an outpost. This should be practiced
at least once each season after the company
has been well instructed in the work by daylight.

Night
attacks

Satisfactory training for night attacks is
difficult. The first principle governing night
attacks is not to shoot but to get in as close
as possible undiscovered and then rush with
the bayonet. It is impracticable to practice
this with a represented enemy; it is too
dangerous. To practice it by allowing the
opposing sides to fire blanks at each other is
all wrong because it is teaching the men to do
what they should not do in war.

One method is to place men to represent
the enemy behind a suitable fence, then to
make the advance and attack, causing the
represented enemy to open fire as soon as the
attack is discovered. An open wire fence
will not prevent the discovery of the attack
but will stop the bayonet rush before anyone is
hurt. This is not very satisfactory work for
the company but is more appropriate for
the battalion and regiment. In these latter
[Pg 57]

it is desirable to practice the necessary formations
for such attacks and to give the
officers experience in such troop leading.
For this work to be of benefit the officers
must know their night tactics, the proper
formations to take and the best methods of
troop leading; this knowledge should first
be acquired by study and then put to the
test at night. It is not well to devote too
much time to such work.

Woods
fighting

In many posts practice can be had in
tactical work in the woods. This opportunity
should not be neglected. A good
tactician will try to avoid a thick forest as a
battlefield but with long lines of battle parts
of the line will inevitably extend through
forests. Hence the officers must study the
principles governing woods fighting and seek
to train the men so that they can play their
part. Woods combat has many of the difficulties
of night work.

Fire
problem

There should be considerable work on
fire problems; it is excellent practice, especially
for the officers and non-commissioned
officers. Field firing is not here meant but
simulated firing. A simple problem is given
and the officer or sergeant with a platoon or
company solves it practically. By using a
[Pg 58]

few men with flags to represent the enemy and
with a proper critique afterwards for all the
company, great benefit should be derived.

As an example of such a problem: dispose
one platoon of the company under cover
near a ridge with a concealed man watching to
the front and stationed about 25 yards from
the platoon, the remainder of the company
400 yards in rear but in sight of the platoon.
The following situation is then given out:

Fire
problem
against
cavalry

âThis company has been detached from
a larger force back at X. Hostile cavalry
is in this neighborhood and is doing much
damage. The orders received when this
company was detached stated that other
companies were to go out on other roads and
this company on this one to inflict as much
punishment as practicable on this cavalry
if encountered. We have reached this point
and just halted for a ten minutes rest.â

As soon as the situation is fully understood
and the men are in their respective
positions, a troop of cavalry, represented by
a few men with yellow flags, comes in view of
the sentinel and halts. Either verbally, or
by a signal agreed upon, the captain explains
that they have dismounted for rest. The
sentinel and platoon commander now have
their problem.

[Pg 59]

As another example take the same general
situation in such terrain that a glimpse is
caught of the troop moving along a road but
immediately it passes behind cover; several
hundred yards beyond, if it continues on the
road, the troop will again come into view and
be exposed for a considerable stretch of road
and within rifle range. What is done now?

After the exercise the captain assembles
the company and criticises the errors made
and points out what should have been done.
In the first situation opening fire by a few men
would result in the hostile troopâs mounting
and getting away with little damage or
else in their getting their horses back under
cover and being prepared to fight on foot.
After the company once opens fire it will
have a target but for a very short time; hence
great care must be exercised in estimating
the distance, dividing the target and giving
the other necessary orders so as to produce the
greatest effect in the least time. The captain
should carefully study his problem and be
prepared to give an instructive critique.

Suggestions
for
fire
problems

A little book called âFire Problemsâ by
T. D. Pilcher of the British Army is recommended
to our officers; it treats this subject
more fully, gives several problems and shows
how the solutions should be criticized.

[Pg 60]

The problems must be gotten up, as a
matter of course, to fit the ground you have.
A great variety of fire problems is afforded
by any terrain. There should be some problems
in which more than one target is offered.
In getting up problems do not let yourself be
hampered by the critics who will tell you that
a troop of cavalry would not have crossed
your front without having discovered you or
without having been warned by its patrols:
you are teaching fire tactics, not cavalry
tactics, and besides, even cavalry has been
known to do foolish and careless things. Try
to make the problem reasonable and one which
might occur in war but do not discard a good
fire problem which teaches a valuable lesson
because the situation is one which ought
never to arise in battle. Few problems that
are tried out in maneuvers will ever be
duplicated in that exact form in war but the
tactical principles involved will recur often.

Distribution
of
fire
problem

There is one field firing problem which, if
practiced once each year, would do a world
of good in securing fire distribution. A line
of prone figures is placed to represent the
enemy on ground so selected that, while the
figures cannot all be seen by the attackers,
yet a man in the place of each figure could
[Pg 61]

see the ground over which the advance is
made. The defensive line should not be
straight; it would seldom be so in war, it
must conform to the ground. There should
be stretches of thirty or forty figures that are
concealed, then groups in plain view; brush,
clumps of heavy grass afford the kind of cover
desired. Have the battalion go through the
form of attacking this line, using ball cartridges.
Then have the men inspect the targets,
see how plainly they could have been
seen by the enemy while the latter was out of
sight and see the effect of cover on the fire
drawn and the faults in distribution. After
this carefully explain the results of a lack
of distribution; point out that the long
stretches of the hostile line not under fire
would have been doing target practice work
on your advancing line and what the resulting
losses would have been.

It is an effective way of impressing on
menâs minds the necessity of proper distribution
and of firing where directed whether
they see anything or not. It also shows the
advantage of cover, if only from view. The
men must be taught to take advantage of
cover, if only from view, whenever offered, if
it can be done without interfering with their
doing their work.

[Pg 62]

Combat
against
cavalry

For combat against cavalry the men must
be taught in their bayonet work the proper
way to oppose a man on horseback. How to
meet a charge with fire must be largely theoretical
but it should be carefully explained
and, if a few mounted men are available to
outline a charging force, some practical work
can be had; it is a fire problem.

Special
company
problems

There are many problems in minor tactics
that should form part of every companyâs
training, such as forcing a defile or a bridge,
passing through a village as a patrol or as
advance party of an advance guard, passing a
woods under the same conditions and, on the
side of the defense, preventing a hostile force
from doing these things. There may be no
gorge or pass through hills in your immediate
vicinity but the practice can still be had:
two large buildings near together will answer
for a defile; the garrison is a village. If there
be no bridge, with a little imagination you
can improvise something to answer. In this
class of problems the captain must know the
tactics of his problem and be able to explain
it thoroughly. Generally in these problems
detachments having important missions have
to be made; give their commanders much
latitude in carrying them out and in your
[Pg 63]

critique point out the errors and how the work
should have been done. It is well in all such
problems to precede them by a simple talk to
the whole company explaining the tactical
principles governing the work. These problems
can be made the most interesting part
of the companyâs training.

Instruction must be given the company
in meeting artillery fire and in the work of the
various covering detachments but these two
subjects, owing to their importance and
length, are reserved for consideration in
separate chapters.

Hints for
company
work

The company commander must get the full
help and support of his platoon and squad
leaders, much depends upon them; they are
the real leaders of the men; they require much
training and practice, especially in leading the
rushes and in controlling and directing fire.

The discipline must be strict in these exercises,
the men must never be allowed to
slight the work. A certain amount of latitude
must be given but prompt obedience to an
order must be insisted upon. Without such
discipline an attack is hopeless; the drill field
is the place to acquire it.

In all this work keep the interest of the
men. Occasionally take them to a shady
[Pg 64]

place and instruct them orally, explain the
objects sought and the reasons for doing
things in anything that is part of their proper
training.

Do not keep at one class of work until the
men are tired of it; vary the work. You can
keep a company interested for four hours
a day if you will only vary the instruction
and put some soul into it. Give very little
place rest; for a rest change the work. Combat
exercises must be frequent. They are entitled
to a large share of the time; the work
of the firing line must be a habit.

THE BATTALION

Hints for
battalion
training

The period of company training having
been completed that of the battalion commences.
The same general plan should be
followed as in the case of the company. The
mechanism of extended order should first be
thoroughly learned, then the attack against
an outlined enemy, then battalion against
battalion. The enlisted men have little new
to learn, the work for them is merely practice
in what they have learned in the company
training. For the captains it is instruction
in team work and in tactics.

The battalion is the attack unit and as a
[Pg 65]

tactical unit is most important. An infantry
attack is largely a combination of battalion
attacks. Every exercise should be a problem
which teaches some lesson as well as affords
practice. The employment of combat patrols
of some size can be made a part of the exercise
and their proper use and leading taught.
The use of the local support, how it is handled
and how maneuvered, is a very important
part.

In these exercises the major must control
his battalion as in battle. The absurdity of his
riding around and giving verbal instructions to
his firing line must not be permitted. A great
part of the value of these combat exercises
lies in the practice given in handling a battalion
with the limited means of control
possible on the field of battle and accustoming
company commanders to carrying out their
part under the same conditions. Majors thus
learn to give their initial orders so as to insure
the carrying out of their plan of action.

The battalion being the attack unit,
whether alone or as part of a long line, its
rushes are independent of those of other battalions
although as a whole it keeps the
general line. Each company of course must
govern its advance by that of the others in
[Pg 66]

the same battalion. An advance can only
start from one flank or the other of the battalion
and then continue successively to completion.
Rushes never start from both flanks
or the center; the reason for this is obvious.

The little flags mentioned under company
training can be used in battalion training to
even better advantage. Captains are more
on their own responsibility in a battalion than
are platoon commanders in a company and
must act according to assumed existing conditions.
In the battalion the shifting of fire
from one target to another is less frequent
than in the company. New unexpected targets
are cared for, as a rule, by the support.

Battalion commanders have more need of
reconnaissance and must get experience in
ordering it properly and judging the reports
and basing their action thereon.

When a battalion operates against battalion
the colonel should prepare the problems
and act as umpire. If he does not do
this the practice should not be omitted, the
majors concerned must get up their own
although this is not so satisfactory.

The battalion commander or colonel
should give a critique after each exercise,
pointing out all errors of tactics and of execution.
[Pg 67]

There should be much more of
tactical instruction and less of mechanical
training in battalion work than in the company.

Majors should not be limited to these
drill periods to instruct their officers but be
allowed to have tactical walks at other times.
A major should have a good knowledge of
tactics, be able to give clear and concise orders
and enter into the spirit of his work. Four
good companies, under a competent major
learn with very little practice to work together
as a team and become an efficient
battalion.

THE REGIMENT

Regimental
training

In the period alloted to the regiment the
solution of tactical problems and thereby
the gaining of experience in team work and
imparting tactical instruction to the officers
are the ends sought. The same rules as to
method of control, giving of orders and
critique apply as in the case of the battalion.

The colonel is responsible for the training
of his regiment. It is not trained until the
three battalions, the band, machine gun platoon
and mounted detachment are trained,
each in its special work, and then the whole is
practiced as a team.

[Pg 68]

The training of the twelve companies, as
such and as battalions, has been discussed.

Band

The band forms a large part numerically
of the sanitary detachment of the regiment
in battle. It must be trained and made
efficient. This should be done by the officers
of the Medical Corps serving with the regiment.
There should be no perfunctory performance
of this work; the colonel should
see that it is thoroughly done.

Machine
gun
platoon

The officer in command of the machine gun
platoon must not only instruct his men in the
care and working of the guns, but in the proper
care of all his equipment, including the animals.
The machine gun is an emergency
weapon; the commander of the machine gun
company must thoroughly understand the
tactical use of this weapon and be able to act
as circumstances demand even without instructions.

Mounted
detachment

The mounted detachment must be trained
as scouts.

Objects
sought
in regimental
training

The principal objects sought in the regimental
period are practice and experience by
the colonel in handling his regiment as a
whole, practice by the regiment in team work,
and tactical instruction for all. A practical
knowledge of tactics on the part of the colonel
is essential if these exercises are to be correctly
[Pg 69]

carried out and his critique of value. Overlooking
tactical errors in these exercises does
much harm, younger officers gain wrong ideas
and it is hard to eradicate errors once firmly
fixed in the mind.

If the different units of the regiment are
separately well trained it requires few exercises
to make a team of them, good regimental
work is largely a question of the tactical skill
and ability of the colonel. If he is competent
and the units are separately well trained
the regiment is trained. Placing these well
trained units in the hands of an incompetent
regimental commander is but placing a fine
and complicated machine in the hands of an
unskilled operator; there is a fair chance that
he will ruin the machine.

[Pg 70]

V

ARTILLERY FIRE

Object
of
study
of
artillery

Except in small engagements in detachment
warfare the infantry will have the
assistance of friendly artillery and will be opposed
not only by infantry but by artillery
fire. Some knowledge of artillery, its use, the
effects it can produce and how best to utilize
the aid afforded by our own and to meet the
opposition of the enemyâs, is therefore necessary
for the infantry officer and also for the
men in ranks. While familiarity with the artillery
will be far from breeding contempt, it
will enable the infantry to escape much unnecessary
loss and, by correcting the false
conception so many have of its power, it will
improve the morale of our men.

This chapter is not intended to teach infantry
officers what they should know about
artillery and its use. It is offered merely as
a suggestion as to what our men should be
taught and how to train them to meet certain
phases of this fire. The officer should know
much more about the subject and must go
[Pg 71]

to more extended works by more competent
men for the instruction.

Artillery is effective against infantry both
physically and morally. The moral effect
is the greater, the less instructed and trained
is the man. Most untrained men have very
exaggerated ideas as to the effectiveness of
artillery, they know nothing but guess much.
It is the terror of the unknown.

Classes
of
artillery

There are two general classes of artillery
that accompany an army: light and heavy.
The light artillery may be rifles or light howitzers;
the first have a flat trajectory, the others,
of greater caliber, have the advantage of being
able to use high angle fire. Mountain and
horse artillery are merely subdivisions of the
light artillery and, except that the mountain
artillery is less effective at long ranges than
the others, âall look alikeâ to the infantry
advancing under their fire.

The heavy field artillery in our service
comprises 4.7â and 5â rifles and 6â and 7â
howitzers. Their range is much greater than
that of the pieces of the light field artillery.
In a general way we may say that these heavy
pieces will be used only against hostile batteries,
earth works and material objects or
against troops caught in some mass formation.
[Pg 72]

They will generally not be used against
an advancing skirmish line or troops in proper
formation to meet light artillery fire. There
is no training to be given infantry except
discipline to hold them to their duty in an
earth work under fire by heavy field artillery,
hence in this chapter we may ignore it.

Light
artillery

With light field artillery it is very different.
The light field artillery is what concerns us
most in our training. The extreme range for
which these guns are sighted is 6500 yards,
and at all ranges under 5000 yards they can
produce serious losses on infantry exposed to
their fire. They use two classes of projectiles,
shell and shrapnel. The high explosive shell
has a much smaller radius of action than the
shrapnel, but is very effective within this
area. It is generally used to batter material
objects and with high angle fire to get at men
in trenches or behind cover.

Shrapnel

The shrapnel of the 3â rifle contains 252
bullets and on burst these bullets are
scattered over an area, roughly speaking,
elliptical in form, 200 yards in depth by 25
yards in width. The flatter the trajectory,
the deeper becomes the pattern made; the
width practically does not vary. In other
words the 252 bullets are scattered on burst
over an area of 5000 square yards.

[Pg 73]

If these bullets were uniformly distributed
there would be
one
for every 20 square
yards or an area of 15 x 12 feet. They are,
however, not evenly distributed, being thicker
in a small area near the front end. This
bullet will not penetrate the infantry soldierâs
pack at any range, so that when lying on the
ground his pack affords complete protection to
his spine and considerable protection to all
vital parts except his head. The chance then
of a man being wounded by a single shrapnel,
even when inside the cone of dispersion, would
only be about 1 in 80 if in the open and very
much less with partial cover, as a trench, log,
etc. The shrapnel bullet will not pass through
one man and wound a second as will the infantry
bullet.

Rate of
fire

While artillery can fire very rapidly once
the range data is accurately determined it requires
considerable time to get into position
and determine this data. Until then it is
harmless.

Moving
target

An erratically shifting target is hard for
artillery to keep on. The fuze must be so
set that the burst is at the proper height and
distance to the front of the target to be effective,
both not easy especially in case of a moving
target, and the more erratic the movement
[Pg 74]

the harder is the task of the artillery-man.

On the
defensive

On the defense the manâs protection is
much better for he will generally have cover
of some kind, but he has also a serious disadvantage,
the line remains fixed, the hostile
artillery soon locates it, gets its exact range
and can place its own fire where it will do the
most good. This is a decided offset to the
defendersâ diminished vulnerability. The
use of high explosive shells by their moral as
well as physical effect weakens any advantage
the defense might have as concerns artillery
fire.

Artillery
targets

To determine the relative vulnerability of
different infantry formations let us apply to
them the target made by a bursting shrapnel.
A line of skirmishers at the normal interval
extending across this beaten zone would have
19 or 20 men inside its extreme limits; if in
squad columns there would be 2 squads at
least and generally 3 squads or 24 men and
the target, being much deeper, would give
the artillery a better chance as it is easier
to get direction correctly than the point of
burst.

In platoon columns there can be but one
platoon in the same burst if fire comes from
[Pg 75]

the front, and platoons are 4 squads strong,
but the whole platoon may be within it. If,
however, the direction of the artillery fire be
very oblique, and the platoons are on a line,
more than one platoon may be caught by a
single burst but not all of any one column.

In successive thin lines, if the advance
be made by one man from a squad, and the
fuze and direction be just right, there may be
2 men in the cone of dispersion, which is to
say that, in that formation, the artillery has
about one chance in forty of wounding a man.
If the advance be by one man from each platoon
the artilleryâs chance, provided range
and fuze are correct, is one in two that one
man will be within the cone of dispersion of a
given shrapnel and, if in there, there is one
chance in 80 of his being hit; in other words,
the artillery has one chance in 160 of getting
one man and no possibility of getting two.
Such a target will hardly draw artillery fire.

An infantry battalion in column of squads
well closed up can nearly all be covered by the
burst of a shrapnel. Such a target would
likely draw many shots as would a company
in this formation.

The
advance
under
artillery
fire

We can only win in the attack if our infantry
can advance to the hostile position.
[Pg 76]

We must get there, and as soon as practicable
and with the least loss of life. We can not
afford to lose too many in the advance or we
shall be too weak at the end to drive the
enemy from his position.

The infantry can not open fire until within
rifle range of the enemy and should try to get
much closer before doing so. In open country,
however, infantry may be subjected to artillery
fire while crossing the ground from 5000
yards to, say 1200 yards from the hostile position,
with no chance to reply. The problem
to be solved by the infantry commander is
how to cross this zone without losing too
many men and too much time.

In
skirmish
line

In skirmish line. The long advance in
this formation is tedious work, and the target
offered is sufficiently vulnerable to draw artillery
fire. If no cover is afforded in the terrain
the line is apt to suffer heavy loss and
become more or less disorganized before reaching
the point where it will take up the fire
fight. Where the line of advance is crossed
by ridges, sunken roads and other features of
that kind affording cover, where the line can
rest and to a certain extent reform, this formation
can be used to advantage, especially if
the terrain permits us to approach under
[Pg 77]

cover from artillery fire to within two or three
thousand yards. If this formation be used
in a force of some size, as a war strength battalion
or more, the platoons should not keep on a
line but in an irregular echelon formation.

This makes a much more difficult target
for the artillery. The distance from front to
rear between any two adjoining platoons
should not be less than 150 yards. The
advance in skirmish line has the advantage
of being in the formation that it will be necessary
to have when you open fire and no changes
are necessary and, if the enemy is encountered
much sooner than expected, you are prepared.

The
squad
column

The squad column. This formation was
devised by our soldiers at maneuvers at
Sparta and in California, where the ground
in part was covered with thick brush. It was
found an excellent formation to take when the
skirmish line encountered these patches of
[Pg 78]

thick brush. Since it was placed in the I. D.
R. it has been understood by some as a good
formation for advancing in the
open
against
artillery fire. This is a mistake. It should
never be so used. In this formation there will
always be two squads, and generally three, in
the burst of a single shrapnel, exposing more
men to danger than if they were in skirmish
line.

Marching in column of files is not as easy
as in line on open ground. Remember good
artillery is pretty accurate in getting direction.
Most shots will be at the head of a column
and if at the head of one, another on each side
is included in the burst. Direction is much
easier to get in artillery fire than exact fuze
setting in the case of a moving target; this is
another reason against the squad column,
the target is deeper and thus slightly improves
the chances of the artillery. This
formation not only has no advantage on open
ground, in an advance under artillery fire, but
does have disadvantages.

Platoon
columns

Platoon columns. In average terrain this
formation will be more used than any other.
The distance between these columns is great
enough so that a shrapnel bursting between
two may entirely miss both; it also permits a
[Pg 79]

more or less erratic or zig zag course to be
followed. Each column is lead presumably
by a more intelligent and better instructed
man than in the case of the squad.

These columns should never be on the
same line but echeloned as explained for the
skirmish line.

In most terrains there are little hills,
clumps of trees, buildings and other cover of
the same general kind. Platoon leaders must
while keeping generally within their own
zones of advance, rush from one cover to another
where it is offered and, where cover is
wanting, vary the pace and avoid advancing
in a straight line.

Properly done this formation is one of the
best. No time is lost, the columns are far
enough apart to allow of advantage being
taken of all the cover afforded, and the
target is not, on average terrain, too vulnerable.
It is not so good on flat open plains
and it should not be used on such ground if
the artillery fire is very oblique to the line of
advance.

This form of advance requires that platoon
leaders understand the theory and also
requires much practice on different sites to
give platoon commanders facility in leading
[Pg 80]

and skill in taking advantage of the cover
offered. This is one of the things in which
captains should give instruction during the
indoor season with the aid of the sand table.
In addition outdoor practice is most necessary.
When this formation is adopted platoon commanders
should know, if possible, before
starting where line of skirmishers is to be
formed.

Successive
thin
lines

Successive thin lines. This is by all
means the safest formation on open ground in
plain view of the hostile artillery observing
station. The successive lines must be so far
apart that no one shrapnel can reach two; this
distance depends on the range but may be
taken as 200 yards. With one man from
each squad there will be two in the cone of a
single shrapnel that bursts right; if the enemy
is so situated that he can afford to fire at such
a target and you do not want to pay the cost
for such an advance, then send one man from
each platoon in each line. Hostile artillery
cannot afford to fire at such a target and if it
does it will use up ammunition that will be
much needed later and get small results for
the expenditure.

The chief objection to this formation is the
time it takes. In advancing in skirmish line
[Pg 81]

or in platoon columns your firing line is established
as soon as you get your first line up,
while, with successive lines formed from
squads, it takes the longer time required for a
line to advance 1400 yards, and if formed
from platoons it takes the time required for a
line to advance 6200 yards.

This formation is also safe against oblique
fire.

The training of the men for it is simple.
Before the line starts the point where it is to
be rebuilt must be carefully designated.
That the line may be rebuilt without confusion
or mixing, each man must be taught to
keep his eyes on the next preceding man of
his own squad or platoon to ensure his finding
his right place in the new line.

After a few of the successive lines have
reached the new position, they form a dense
enough target to draw artillery fire. For this
reason the position of the new line should be
one affording cover from artillery fire if possible;
if not, men must get cover by digging to
protect at least their heads from shrapnel.
Head cover and the pack will give them protection
from being killed if not from being
wounded.

If the advance in this manner must be for
[Pg 82]

three or four thousand yards and the enemy
has advanced posts or is likely to make
an infantry counter attack, the advance over
this whole distance can not be made at once
but must be made by steps, growing shorter
as you approach the enemyâs position.

Artillery
sweeping
fire

The artillery will often sweep with fire an
area being crossed by infantry. This is done
by increasing or decreasing the range after
each shot until the entire area is beaten. If
this process be repeated often enough the
artillery will get anything within this area
not under cover. But this does not change
the average number of shrapnel required to
get a man nor does it render advisable a great
expenditure of ammunition for meager results.

Infantry encountering this kind of fire
should, as it approaches, lie down and get
what cover is available and, after the storm
has passed, move on.

The artillery may determine the exact
range to some zone which the advancing infantry
has to cross and, as the infantry reaches
it, open a heavy and accurate fire. The infantry
must cross this zone in a formation
which decreases its vulnerability as much as
practicable, consistent with other conditions,
such as the hostile infantry fire.

[Pg 83]

The enemyâs guns can get you if they expend
enough ammunition at the task; but
can they afford the ammunition? Your own
artillery may interfere with such an expenditure
even if the enemy were willing to make it.

A division deployed with 2500 men on the
firing line, crossing correctly in thin lines a
fire-swept zone from 4000 to 1200 yards,
might lose 10% of this number from artillery
fire and not have its advance even checked.
With this open formation the loss is so small
that the moral effect of it will be negligible
with trained men. But a loss of 250 men at
an expenditure of 160 shrapnel for each
means 40,000 shrapnel. Even half that
much would be more than could generally
be afforded.

Forming
skirmish
line

After the skirmish line is formed at the
position for opening the infantry attack, the
further advance from there is conducted as
already explained. In skirmish line the hostile
infantry is now by far your most dangerous
foe, but the artillery will still be punishing
you: your line must advance under both fires.

Artillery fire will seldom be uniformly
distributed along the entire skirmish line or
continuous in its action. There will be blasts
of intense fire, then a lull. The troops must
[Pg 84]

be trained to take advantage of these lulls
to advance and to lie quiet during the periods
of hottest fire. Of course, if for any cause the
artillery fire is not very effective, the advance
continues as against the infantry.

Our infantry must be taught to keep their
fire superiority over the hostile infantry and
to this object to devote all their skill and
energy, but to avoid unnecessary heavy loss
from artillery whenever possible. The hostile
infantry is their real opponent, their real
danger. As the opposing lines get close the
losses from artillery fire become relatively
slight, compared with the losses from infantry
fire.

How to
practice
advance
under
artillery
fire

How are we to get this training in most
of our posts where there is no artillery to
afford us the practice?

A man with a red flag indicates the position
of a hostile battery, or, if the battery is
concealed, a position that can be seen and is
in the general direction of the battery. When
the flag is waved rapidly it indicates a rafale
or violent burst of fire; waved very slowly, it
indicates slow fire by battery. In most exercises
no flag is necessary; the instructor
can give verbally the direction from which
the artillery fire is coming in stating the
[Pg 85]

problem; but in practicing the attack formation,
under combined artillery and infantry
fire, the flags should be used to practice
platoon leaders in the rushes under such
conditions.

Infantry
as an
artillery
support

Infantry is sometimes detailed to support
batteries that are somewhat separated from
the rest of the troops and liable to attack by a
rush of infantry or cavalry. Officers on this
duty must thoroughly understand their
mission. They must protect the artillery.
Artillery can generally take ample care of itself
if the attack comes directly from the front.
The infantry commander must never mask
the fire of the guns. Where he will place his
men and what his general dispositions will be
is a problem in tactics and the solution will
vary with each case. These general propositions
may be stated: his position must be
such that from it he can effectively meet the
attack; it should not be where he will get too
much of the fire directed on the batteries; the
command must be well in hand and the reconnaissance
and observation groups so employed
that he will have timely warning of
the hostile approach and be prepared to meet
it. His position will generally be to a flank
and probably somewhat to the rear, never in
front of the guns.

[Pg 86]

An occasional exercise in this work should
be carried out as a maneuver. Something
should be placed to represent the guns and a
battalion or company assigned as their protection
while another force is given the mission
to capture them. This exercise should always
be carefully umpired to see that the
guns get credit for what they could do if fire
is not masked. A problem of this kind is a
small part of the work of infantry in war
and when it comes it is a tactical problem like
any other attack or defense. The reason
for recommending it is that it affords excellent
practice in security and information service
and in combat when one position must be
avoided. Combat exercises should be as
varied as possible, here is another variety.

Fire superiority

The importance of fire superiority has
already been dwelt upon as well as how much
the effectiveness of hostile fire falls off as the
effectiveness of our own increases. Infantry
alone does not gain this fire superiority but it
gains it by the help of our powerful ally and
sister arm, the artillery.

Artillery
fire over
infantry

Battle fronts are too short for the artillery
to occupy space in the line, even if this were
a good place for it which it is not; it
must fire over the infantry. All our men must
[Pg 87]

be made to understand the effect of this
artillery fire on the effectiveness of the hostile
infantry, how much more effective this
latter would be without the fire of our artillery,
and the importance of having this artillery
fire kept up to the last possible moment.
Prove to them how much less we shall lose
by an occasional premature burst than we
should lose by the increased effectiveness
of the hostile infantry if our artillery
ceased to fire. The men must be taught that
it is the infantry that does most of the killing
and that, especially at the very short ranges,
we want all the help we can get to keep
down this killing by the enemyâs infantry.

It has already been shown why the attackerâs
artillery has an advantageâthe
target is fixed. If the men are properly
taught this there will be no trouble in getting
them to want the artillery to fire over their
heads as long as possible.

Tactical
connection

The connection that must be kept between
the infantry commander and the
commander of the batteries told off to his
support is of the greatest importance, but
that will be the function of a higher ranking
man than this book is written for.

How to
instruct

How part of this instruction is to be given
[Pg 88]

has already been told. It is believed that
the best way to give the theoretical part is in
small doses between exercises in the fieldâthe
little talks referred to before. Care must be
taken not to give too much at once and
to continue explaining until the men really
grasp it. The theory should go along with
the practical work; some of it can be best
given in the non-commissioned officersâ school
and, as before stated, on the sand table.

How and when you do it is of less importance
than
that
you do it.

[Pg 89]

VI

PATROLS, ADVANCE AND REAR GUARDS, OUTPOSTS

Patrolling. The great importance of
this work calls for the most careful
instruction being given our men in this duty.
It is not easy to teach, there is so little of it
that can be done by thumb rule except in
the simpler forms as visiting patrols. The
first requisite is that the instructor know the
subject thoroughly. As this work is in no
sense a treatise on tactics that phase of the
question will not be entered into here.

Teaching
patrolling

In teaching this subject in the company
the following course has been found to give
good results. In the winterâs school thoroughly
instruct all the non-commissioned officers
and selected privates in the fundamental
principles; for example, the various formations,
the necessity of the leaderâs determining
his mission and knowing how to interpret what
he sees, how to write a message, and how to
decide many other questions.

Sand
table
work

With this oral instruction there should be
work on the relief map or sand table. This
latter is one of the most important aids in
teaching this subject. The instructor with a
[Pg 90]

small group at the table gives a simple situation
and then, turning to one of the men, gives
him an order as patrol leader to make a certain
patrol on the ground represented by the map.
Allow a short time for the section to think it
over then question the leader. First get his
idea of his mission and plan of action, question
the others as to what they think of it,
then the instructor gives his idea or concurs
in that already given by the men.

Next the leader should be required to tell
what he would do up to the time of moving
out, the inspection he would make, what
men must have and what they must not have,
all the instructions and information he would
give his patrol. The other members are
called on in turn to point out any errors or
omissions, then this part is discussed. The
leader then points out his general route and
gives the formation of his patrol along this
route under the supposition that no enemy is
encountered. The others are questioned as to
their ideas of the correctness of the leaderâs
decision.

The instructor should then take up the
march in detail, something as follows: When
you reached this point what would you do?
How would you get from here to there?
[Pg 91]

When you reached the bottom of this little
hill what did you do? And so on, bringing out
carefully and thoroughly how woods, bridges,
defiles and villages are traversed, etc.

At the conclusion the instructor should
go back to the start and at various points
along the route have them see various hostile
patrols and bodies of troops, bring out what
should be done in each new situation, what
messages sent, whether by one man or more,
whether written or verbal, requiring in every
case the reasons. The problem should be
worked out once on the assumption that the
patrol is in hostile territory and once as in
friendly territory, the instructor bringing
out clearly the difference in conduct. The
mission should then be changed, as for instance
from a patrol seeking information
change the problem, on the same ground so as
to give it a mission of screening.

The various phases of patrolling, in
friendly and hostile territory, with a mission to
gain information and then to prevent the
enemyâs gaining it should be worked out
carefully on the same ground with only the
necessary changes in the problem to bring
out the differences in their conduct. It seems
to impress these differences on the men the
[Pg 92]

more lastingly, the more closely the problems
resemble each other in other respects and
when they are on the same ground.

After this series is once worked through
with the men, other problems on different
ground are taken. It takes considerable
work of this kind to make the men proficient
in the principles of patrolling. As soon as
they are deemed proficient they should be
taken out for tactical walks in patrol problems
on the ground and there given problems
to solve, the instructor acting as umpire.
This is all work that can be done in most
posts in the winter season by taking advantage
of the most favorable weather for the
outdoor part.

The instruction in the principles of patrol
leading can be given to better advantage on
the relief map or sand table than on the ground
but the latter training can not be dispensed
with, some of it must be given. Later on
there should be much opportunity for further
practice in the course of the combat exercises.

Other
kinds of
patrolling

The work of the expeditionary patrol
should be taught in the same manner. The
work of the visiting and connecting patrols
can be taught during the exercises in advance
guard and outposts. They require very little
[Pg 93]

effort. The company as a whole should be
frequently exercised as a strong patrol. There
is one form of patrol, often very strong, that
is of great importance and yet its proper
training is frequently neglectedâthe combat
patrol. These patrols are always thrown out
when a command deploys for action and upon
their proper conduct much depends. Their
mission is always to prevent the firing line
from being unexpectedly fired into from the
flank and they fulfill this mission according
to the situation, either by securing the flank
by themselves holding off the enemy, or by
observing and giving timely warning so that
the support or reserves can be disposed to
meet the enemy and thus ward off the attack.

It must be thoroughly impressed on all
what the mission of the combat patrol leader
really means and that any position or formation
of such a patrol, that allows the firing
line to be so attacked is all wrong.

The
combat
patrol

The following must be thoroughly taught:

1. That when the patrol is so situated
that it can see no more than the men on that
flank of the firing line it is serving no valuable
purpose.

2. That in practically all cases where it
[Pg 94]

is not in advance of the firing line it will not
gain the necessary information in time to be of
any value.

3. That the enemy must not get within
effective rifle range of the flank of the line.

The strength of the combat patrol
must depend on whether it is merely to observe
or to offer real resistance and its conduct
must be governed accordingly.

It is believed that the principles governing
this work can be best taught, after a talk
in the school, by a form of tactical walk, where
the instructor can devote himself to the handling
of this patrol; later on it is, of course,
practiced in all battle exercises.

Combat
patrol
tactical
walk

In the conduct of such walks the instructor
takes his class out as such patrol and
states his problem, the firing line being represented
by a few men or even entirely imaginary,
its progress being announced from
time to time. The instructor then acts as
leader, explains what is to be done and, assuming
he has a platoon, takes his first position.
He conceals his platoon and has observers
out covering him and so placed that
any enemy approaching will be seen in time,
and that he will be in the best position to meet
him. The number of sentinels out and their
[Pg 95]

distance from the main body of the platoon
depend on the terrain. He then carefully
points out his dispositions to the class and
explains why made and assuming in turn that
the enemy is approaching from each of the
likely directions, how his dispositions enable
him to meet fully the case. The necessity for
signal communication with the commander
is explained and how he has provided for it.

He then discusses the terrain with reference
to the next advance. As the firing line
advances where he should next go, and how
get there. A small patrol advances to the
next position selected, finds it unoccupied
and so signals back. The platoon then moves
there and sentinels are sent out as before and
possibly small reconnoitering patrols. The
same discussion as before. Also from time
to time hostile patrols are assumed to be seen
and what should be done explained; when
fire would be opened on the main hostile line,
if at all. In fact the whole conduct of this
patrol until the conclusion of the fight should
be discussed, showing how it jumps from place
to place, always covered by sentinels or small
patrols, and how the firing line is always protected
by it from surprise. He should point
out how, in most cases, a mere marching along
[Pg 96]

in a straight line would utterly fail, and impress
upon the men the fact that the leader
must use his head all the time.

Having gone through such an exercise
once or more, the instructor solving the problem
himself, he should then prepare the
problem and, having stated it, call on the
class to solve it step by step in the same
manner. In all cases of errors in disposition
the instructor assumes an enemy from a
certain direction and has the class realize the
error by their inability to meet the situation.
The importance of keeping as many of the
patrol as practicable well in hand must be
emphasized.

Any combat patrol that is to offer resistance,
from a squad to a company, is handled
in the same way. The work of the smaller
combat patrols whose duty is only to observe
are likewise taught in the same way. The
terrain and conditions bringing about their
use instead of the larger ones make the
problem easier.

The officers of the battalion should be
taken on such walks by the major or some
other officer. The company commander
should conduct them for his lieutenants and
non-commissioned officers.

[Pg 97]

The men should also be practiced in the
same way, as the combat patrol or covering
detachment of a defensive line. This
work is simpler, the patrol generally does not
move from position to position. Its mission
is the same as in the attack and even more
important. In the defense very much depends
on the selecting of the best position
for this patrol and the correct dispositions
being taken.

The case must be also considered of a
patrol sent out by the defense for reconnaissance
or screening which in case of attack
becomes the combat patrol.

In a battle line with intervals, as in the
case of the enveloping attack, connecting
files must be used. Their object is to keep
the commanders of the subdivision informed
as to how the other is progressing. This
can generally be done by forming points
in the line joining the two inner flanks. In
some cases this will not serve. Rules for this
can not be given.

Advance
guard
training

Advance Guard. In most commands too
much of our limited field training period is
devoted to work of advance and rear guards.
It is important and must be taught, but if the
other work which is the real foundation for
[Pg 98]

this is properly done but little more time is
required outside of the maneuver exercises
for training the enlisted men. Patrolling and
combat form most of the work in these exercises
so far as the men are concerned.

There are many tactical problems that
come to the officers in this class of work and
they must know how to solve them. This is
the work of the school for officers and should
be effectively done.

Advance
guard
rencontre

The point is but a patrol with a special
mission. The flanking groups are reconnoitering
and scouting patrols but they involve
some new features. When a rencontre
engagement occurs on the march one of the
first things the commander wants to know is
the strength of the enemy and his location; if
deployed, where is his line? Where its flank?
If not deployed, what is he doing? As the
advance party deploys and pushes on, these
flanking groups have the best opportunity to
observe and by reconnaissance to gain valuable
information. They also become, temporarily
at least, combat patrols to the firing
line. The men must be taught to carry out
this mission without further orders and to do
it correctly. In case small detachments attempt
to delay our march, these patrols by
[Pg 99]

flanking them can greatly hurry their retreat
and prevent the delay of our column.

Maneuver
work

The general principle of advance and rear
guards should be taught the company. This
work can be done in part at the relief map and
sand table, but the company should be exercised
on the ground as the advance guard of
a battalion and as the advance party of a
larger advance guard, the other troops being
imaginary. Afterwards two companies should
work against each other, one as rear party of
a rear guard, the other as advance party of an
advance guard; also each as advance party
in a rencontre.

If the foundation has been properly laid
there is no difficulty in teaching the application
of these principles to covering detachments.
If it has not been so laid and the
men do not thoroughly understand patrolling
in its different forms, it will be hard to
teach it in these exercises.

In maneuver exercises problems involving
rencontre engagements and engagements involving
a marching column encountering an
enemy in position should be had to train the
officers in tactics and to give the men practice
in combat exercises and in the patrolling necessary.

[Pg 100]

Outpost
training

Outposts. The general principles of outpost
duty, the duties of sentinels, the general
formation of an outpost line with its subdivisions
must be taught the men indoors.
The officers have much to learn in school or
from books on this subject. With proper preparation
by all the work outside is simple.

There are a few things that need special
mention:

In the instruction work have a definite
situation. If the company is to be exercised
as a support take an outpost order giving the
situation and general location of the supports.
If any detachment, including the company,
is to march beyond assumed existing covering
detachments, see that it is properly
covered by an advance guard. Judgment
must be used in this, the smaller the detachment
the weaker relatively the cover. Bear
in mind where the other detachments are
marching and the amount of cover they
afford to yours.

When starting out instruct the advance
where you are going, then have it go far
enough in advance of that to cover you while
you are making your dispositions after you
have reached your destination.

From the company down make the distribution
[Pg 101]

of troops and assignment of tasks
in an orderly manner, much as the guard is
divided up for the post guard; do this while
the detachment is still formed.

Full information of the situation should
be given the men; the proper performance of
their duty is impossible otherwise. Each
subdivision commander must attend to this.
The captain should give as much of the necessary
information as practicable to the whole
company, this saves time for the picket commanders
and will probably result in the situation
being better understood.

Outpost
practice
on the
ground

Where the outpost line should be located
and how it should be disposed varies with
many conditions. It is a tactical problem
that the officers must be able to solve and
must learn elsewhere than on the ground in
the few hours devoted to this work in troop
training.

A little practice should be held by the
regiment as a whole in forming outpost; one
with the regiment as the outpost and one with
the regiment as the whole command, one battalion
forming the advance guard on the
march. In the latter, a halt order should be
issued and outpost formed from the advance
guard battalion; when completed a
[Pg 102]

march order should be issued by which the
new advance guard passes through the outpost
line. The outpost should then be
assembled and take its place in column.

We do this very easily in map problems;
try it on the ground, especially in rather
close country.

Mounted
scouts

The mounted scouts. While the mounted
scouts have been taken from the infantry
regiment there is still with each regiment a
mounted detachment of orderlies. A few
mounted scouts well trained are invaluable
to an infantry regiment when operating alone.
The commander of an infantry regiment,
if wise, will see that these orderlies are trained
as scouts and then when necessary he can
so use them. Their most important and
frequent use will be as the mounted point
and flank patrols for an advance or rear guard
and for patrolling to the front of an outpost
line.

To be of any value they must be well
instructed in these duties as described under
advance guard. Being mounted they are
much more valuable than a dismounted patrol
for gaining information from the flanks and
getting it back to the commander in time to be
[Pg 103]

of some use. These orderlies can be trained
in this work without interfering materially
with their instruction in the care of horses
and equipment and it can be given along
with instruction in horsemanship.

[Pg 104]

VII

MARCHING

Ability to march under war conditions
is of primary importance in the training
of infantry. There is much more marching
than fighting in war and, no matter how
well a man may be trained otherwise, if he is
unable to reach the field of battle he is of
no value as a fighting man.

Requisites
for
marching

That the infantry soldier may be able
to meet the requirements in this respect he
must possess the necessary health and strength
he must be properly shod, know how to care
for himself on the march, especially how to
take care of his feet, and his muscles must be
properly developed. It is also necessary that
the responsible officers know how to conduct
the march and to care for the men.

That the man has been allowed to enlist
presumes the possession of the necessary
health and strength and gives us a man who
can be trained to meet all necessary requirements
except when temporarily sick or disabled.

Shoes for
marching

The soldierâs shoes must be of proper
[Pg 105]

construction, well fitted to the man and the
leather kept soft and pliable. The shoe
now issued to our army is good and with
proper care in fitting leaves little to be desired.
The fitting of the shoes is an important duty
of the company commander and should never
be slighted. The rules prescribed for this
should be carefully followed. Every captain
of infantry should have and carefully study
the little book âThe Soldierâs Foot,â by Lieut.
Colonel Munson, Medical Corps.

No matter how well a shoe may be fitted
if it becomes soaked with water and dries,
without proper care, it will become hard and
stiff and sore feet are apt to result. The menâs
shoes in campaign should be kept oiled.
Neatsfoot oil should always be carried in
every companyâs baggage and officers should
see that it is used as needed. There should
also be a supply of talcum or foot powder.

Socks for
marching

The socks are of nearly as much importance
as the shoes. They, too, must fit.
If too large they wrinkle, if too small they
are apt to bend and injure the toes; in both
cases the result is sore feet. Woolen socks
are much better for hard marching than
cotton, they keep the feet dryer and afford
more of a cushion and consequently better
[Pg 106]

protection from injury. If the man finds
that wool next his skin produces too great
irritation he should wear woolen socks over
a pair of cotton or lisle thread.

Care of
abrasions

After a dayâs march the feet should be
washed and any blisters and abrasions should
receive proper attention. Adhesive plaster
should be applied to all such, even to spots
that are sore and the skin not yet broken;
properly applied it is a great protection.

Rather than have the men treat their own
feet it is much better that, after the dayâs
march and camp has been made, a reasonable
time be given the men to wash their feet and
prepare for inspection. Captains should then
carefully inspect the feet of all their men and
send every man with the slightest injury to
the regimental infirmary at once and have
the injuries properly treated.

Men should be taught to do this for themselves
but as it can be so much more surely
and better done as above described the men
should be permitted to do it themselves only
in emergencies where sanitary troops are not
available.

Protection
of
head and
neck

In marching in very hot weather the men
must be instructed in the importance of protecting
the back of the neck from the direct
rays of the sun. It would be well if our men
[Pg 107]

were issued a small piece of cloth of suitable
color with some means of readily attaching it
to the hat to afford this protection. The
Japanese soldiers used such an attachment
in Manchuria with good results.

There must be an air space between the
top of the hat and the manâs head. The
hat must be ventilated and in very hot weather
a wet sponge or cloth or green leaves should
be carried in the hat. The shirt collar, if not
very loose, should be unbuttoned.

Bathing

Besides bathing the feet the men should
bathe their whole bodies frequently. Anyone
familiar with our âregularsâ on the
march and who has seen them break for the
water to bathe as soon as possible after a dayâs
march knows that it requires no order to get
this done. But sometimes we must camp
where there is no water available for bathing.
Men should at least wash the crotch with a wet
towel, especially if there is a tendency to chafe.
Talcum powder should be used in such cases.

Drinking

Men should be carefully taught the disabling
effects of alcohol if drunk the night before
or during a hard march, especially if the
march be made in hot weather. The men
must also be instructed to care wisely for
their diet and to avoid the excessive drinking
[Pg 108]

of water on the march. Too little water is as
bad.

Personal
hygiene

All this instruction should be carefully
given the men by their company officers under
the general supervision of the regimental
surgeon. The surgeon, with the approval of
the colonel, should prepare an outlined
scheme for instruction in first aid and in personal
hygiene, having special reference to the
soldierâs care of himself in the field. The
surgeon should then instruct such company
officers as have need of the instruction; the
company officers then instruct the men. A
part of the examination of the company at the
end of its indoor period should be on these
subjects.

Muscle
development

The muscles must be
properly
developed.
It is not the strongest man who can best stand
the march; it does not require great physical
strength. The manâs muscles must be flexible,
he must be trained to use them and be
able to use them without causing physical
pain.

Marching as fully equipped infantry in
the ranks is a very different proposition from
walking along the road independently, and
for the private in ranks with his load it is
different from what it is for the officer with
his.

[Pg 109]

Many men of great strength are often what
is called âmuscle bound.â Others have
certain muscles overdeveloped others underdeveloped.
When muscles usually unused
are brought into play, or when a man is
forced into a constrained position, if it be kept
up continuously for some time, serious pain
and discomfort results and often ends in a
physical break down.

A good course in callisthenics or in gymnasium
training is the best thing for the new
man. It loosens him up, brings into play the
different muscles, renders them flexible and
gives the man control of himself. Then practice
in marching, carrying his equipment,
strengthens the necessary muscles and accustoms
the man to the necessary constraint.

March
training

The training of the company for marching
consists, then, in getting the menâs
muscles in proper condition by physical drill,
in theoretical instruction as outlined above,
and actual practice. Most of the actual
practice is and should be gained at the regular
daily drills and exercises. In these, if they
are properly conducted, the man gets enough
preparation.

Practice
marches

Devoting one day each week to a practice
march is believed a mistake. In many of our
posts a command going out on the roads can
[Pg 110]

not leave them, there is no chance for instruction
except very imperfect instruction in
advance and rear guard work and practice in
marching.

The physical part, the mere practice in
marching can be just as well gained in the
regular exercises, and to devote one-fifth of
our field training period to the other instruction
is excessive. It prevents some of the
other necessary training being given and it
ignores relative values.

What are wanted are men physically fit.
Four to six hours a day of correct and rational
training will make them as much fit without
this weekly practice march as with it and
give more time, all of which is needed, for
necessary work.

Yearly
march

There should, however, be one march
every year of from 200 to 300 miles. This is
necessary for instruction in camp expedients,
to train the men to care for themselves on
long marches and to give them experience in
field service.

It would be better could it be held late in
the season. The command should march
to some point where they could have maneuver
work and training in the larger units
and on the ground more unfamiliar than their
[Pg 111]

home reservation. But the march should
be held, if it be only out and back.

The
officers

Even with the men well prepared much
of the success of the march depends on the
officers. They must understand how to conduct
a march and care for their men and conscientiously
perform their duty. They must
try to get the manâs point of view, think of
the manâs comfort and health.

Marching
gait

Halts

Every officer who may be responsible for
the uniformity and rate of march should carefully
train himself to take a suitable gait and
strictly maintain it. No one thing is more
trying than an unsteady pace and many good
officers are unable properly to lead a column on
on the march for this reason. The halts must
be regulated to suit conditions. In very hot
weather or when climbing steep hills they
must be more frequent than once an hour.

Discipline must be strict, no straggling
allowed. Running to catch up, âbacking
and fillingâ is productive of a big sick report.

Whenever conditions permit the intervals
between units should be increased, especially
when the weather is hot and roads dusty. It
renders a steady, uniform pace easier to
maintain, and thus tires the men less.

The other rules for marches given in our
[Pg 112]

service regulations should be carefully observed.

The first
few days

Much of the success of a long march
depends on the first two or three days, until
the men get into the swing. Where practicable
the first dayâs march should be a little less
than average, the second a short one, after
that our trained regulars can keep up the
average march six days a week. On starting
out it is the second dayâs march that is
the most trying to the men. This should be
borne in mind and all practicable allowances
made.

An excessively long march should never
be made just for practice. It does not fit the
man for another but the reverse.

[Pg 113]

VIII

THE NATIONAL GUARD

In training the infantry of the national guard
we have a very different problem from
that of the regular regiments.

In these regiments the same proportional
attention should be given to those things that
should be habits as in training the regulars
and the necessity for varied instruction in
order to keep the interest of the men is even
greater.

Scope
of the instruction

My observation leads me to believe that
the greatest weakness of many of our national
guard captains lies in the narrow scope
of the instruction given and in its monotony.
There is a lack of variety at each meeting.
The men lose interest.

When the recruit first joins the guard he
generally does it for the best of reasons and is
interested in the work. But after going to
the armory for a few times and drilling in a
few movements over and over again he loses
interest, then he cuts drill and possibly ends
by trying to get discharged.

[Pg 114]

There are many things that should be
taught, and you can only hope for success by
varying the work and holding the interest of
your men. Do not put more time than
necessary on non-essentials.

The
recruit

Of course the recruit must first be taught
the school of the soldier and he must have the
necessary instruction in close order drill.
But even early in his course there is a chance
for variety; early in the game give him a rifle
for part of the time and as soon as he has had
a little drill in the manual of arms teach him
sighting and then pointing and aiming drill.
As soon as he is far enough along let him fire
a score at gallery practice each drill. At first
devote the most time to drill without arms
but increase the time with arms until all the
drills are with arms and you get him in the
company for close order drill.

The following should be taught as carefully
as practicable:

Essentials
for the
guard

1. Target practice on the range. If the
gallery practice and pointing and aiming
drill recommended below be well done, comparatively
little of this will answer. But it
cannot be omitted, every man should have
some practice. Where possible some of this
practice should be in âfield firing.â In many
[Pg 115]

cases there is a tendency to give known distance
firing an exaggerated value to the neglect
of other training.

2. The mechanism of the deployments,
the advance by rushes even after the line is
mixed, control of fire, and all these directed
by signals only; verbal commands should not
be used.

3. Estimating distance must be taught.

4. Pointing and aiming drill and gallery
practice, so that the man will always bring
his piece up properly, look through the sights
and pull the trigger only after careful aim,
must be practiced until the necessary habit
is formed.

5. There must be frequent close order
drill. Knowledge of this is necessary for the
orderly movement of troops and it is our
greatest aid to discipline. But to be an aid to
discipline it must be exact, otherwise it has a
reverse effect. It is just as easy to do it correctly
as to do it approximately if you only
teach it so at the beginning and then give the
subject attention ever afterward and do not
allow the drill to become sloppy.

6. The use of the bayonet must be
taught and practiced.

7. The men must be taught simple intrenching
[Pg 116]

and the various uses of sand bags.

8. First aid and personal hygiene.

9. Patrolling; especially the combat patrols
and those with advance and rear guards
and outposts. As many as possible should
know how to read a map.

10. The company musicians and two or
three privates should know the flag signalling.

But the captain may say: all these are
practicable with the regulars who have all the
time needed and daylight in which to work and
ground to work on; but how are we to do
these in an armory at night?

Required
equipment

Every armory should have a place fixed
for gallery practice if it is only a backing for
the target against the wall in one of the
corners. And no company should be without
a sand table; a relief map is also very desirable.

With this equipment let us see what we
can do.

The ordinary drills of course are on the
armory door.

Estimating
distances

The principles of estimating distance
should be taught the company and the men
urged to practice it for themselves. Groups
are formed and go anywhere it is convenient
for this purpose. Occasionally, if found
[Pg 117]

practicable, the company goes out. Officers
and non-commissioned officers in this same
way should learn to use the range finder.

Patrolling

Patrolling can be well taught on the sand
table or relief map. Pile up your sand, forming
any desired terrain; with yellow strings
mark the roads and with blue ones the
streams, little bridges, etc., can be made with
a jackknife, houses represented by blocks,
forests with little pieces of evergreenâyou
have your outdoors.

A scale must be provided and one end of
the table marked as north.

The instructor takes a squad to the table
and starts out, for instance, by stating:
âSmith, your regiment has reached this point
(just off the table) moving north in hostile
territory. The colonel sends for you and
gives you this orderââCorporal, I have heard
rumors that there is a force of the enemy in
that village northeast of here. I want to
know whether that is true. Take your squad
and move along in the general direction of
this main road, find out and report. The
regiment will remain here for several hours.
Be back here by 3
P. M.
, it is now 10 oâclock.ââ
The instructor tells Smith to do just as if he
were on the ground. Smith inspects his
[Pg 118]

squad, gives his instructions to his men and
then proceeds. He can tell the instructor
his formation, and what he does from time
to time, or each of the men, provided with
a match and a scale, may be required to move
his own match. There are many ways of
doing it. The instructor must give information
of the enemy, either orally or at certain
points place lead soldiers or something to
represent the enemy.

The thing aimed at is to find out how
Smith and the other men would act under
various conditions, point out their errors and
show them how to correct these, and give
the reasons. An infinite number of such
problems can be devised.

This sand table is especially good for
teaching the work of a combat patrol. Form
your field of battle and along one flank have
a varied terrain with houses, clumps of trees,
little hills, etc. The instructor moves a light
rod along to represent the firing line and the
patrol leader solves his problem. Whenever
any error is made the movement stops until
the mistake is pointed out and explained.

Security

In the same way are treated advance and
rear guards of the strength of a company and
a company as advance or rear party. Outposts
[Pg 119]

are established, the sentinels being represented,
and routes of the patrols selected.

Entrenching

Entrenching can be taught by constructing
trenches to scale on the sand table terrain.
I have seen elaborate field works with bomb
proofs constructed in this way by the men of
one company, but this is not recommended
for any but the officers; it is better to limit
this work to the simpler trenches. With a
round piece of stove wood for a log and with a
good jack knife, or better a hatchet, you can
make your loop holes for the head log. With
a lot of small Bull Durham tobacco sacks,
filled with sand, you have your sand bags, the
varied uses of which should be taught.

The officers should have a war game map
for their patrol problems and for war games.

Bayonet
fencing

Bayonet fencing should be practiced if
you have the necessary equipment. If not,
and a place is available for it, suspend by
a rope something to represent a man, a sack
full of straw will do, so that it can be made
to swing through a small angle back and
forth and to right and left. Let the men
practice the thrusts, lunges, cuts, etc., against
this, another man giving the dummy a
motion. This should come after training
in the bayonet exercise.

[Pg 120]

I would propose a system something like
the following for your company drills:

Recruits by themselves until they can be
put in the company; their work has already
been discussed.

Essentials
at every
drill

After the company is formed give 15 or 20
minutes of snappy, precise close order drill
then a little manual of arms. Then have the
company deploy, two or three times at least,
from different formations. Then go through
an attack formation the best you can, all the
company in the line, no support, an advance
of 40 yards being represented by one of five,
etc. Then try it holding out a support
and putting it in so as to mix squads and
advance as before. Remember, no verbal
commands, all this to be done by signals.

Have little posters on one wall of your
armory at the proper height; have a few
minutes pointing and aiming drill, impressing
on the men the importance of always taking
careful aim.

Group
work

Then divide your company into small
groups. One group at the sand table, one receiving
first aid instruction, another bayonet
work, another gallery practice, etc. The group
at the sand table may be larger than the
others and may stay there for the rest of the
[Pg 121]

evening, the others should change every 15 or
20 minutes. The sand table group should
change each drill and once during the night
if practicable, that is, if there is time for one
group to finish its problem and give another
a chance that same evening, it should be
done. Nearly all the company should fire a
score at the gallery every night.

If there are a few men in the company
who are poor at the manual of arms they can
be put in one group and be given one of their
turns in drill in the manual.

One group may have to be taught how
to make the pack. Instruction in guard duty
may be necessary for another. Verbal instruction
can be given in several subjects with
great advantage where a good instructor is
available; in that case all except the group
at the sand table can be assembled.

The whole course cannot be covered at one
drill. The captain should so arrange his
groups that all in turn get instruction in the
whole course, that all get a variety each night,
that where men have a special deficiency
it receives attention, that the first part, the
essentials for the whole company, be never
slighted, and that as many as practicable
of the company get gallery practice at every
drillâone score will answer fully.

[Pg 122]

Owing to the time it takes to complete a
problem or task on the sand table, often but
one group can use it in an evening. The
size of the group working should not, however,
be increased. Only small parties can be
advantageously instructed. For this reason
the sand table must be worked to the limit
and because of this and the number of things
to be taught on it and because some officers
are not very expert in forming suitable terrain
on the sand table, it is an advantage to have
the relief map also. The latter can then be
used for patrolling and work of covering
detachments and the sand table for the field
engineering.

Brush
work

At most stations small twigs can be collected
and used to make hurdle revetments,
fascines and gabions for use on the sand table.
They can be constructed to the reduced scale
and this brush work learned nearly as well as
outside with normally sized faggots.

Have the officer or non-commissioned
officer best qualified give the instruction in
each class. The instructor has much to do
with success; some are specially good at one
thing but poor at another.

With such a course of instruction well
given throughout the year and with a week
[Pg 123]

or ten days of good camp work annually, and
suitable school work for the officers, there is
no reason why the national guard should not
possess the efficiency required of it to be a
valuable military asset.

No callisthenic
drill

Sufficient of the callisthenic or setting up
exercises for the proper development of the
soldier should be shown the recruit and the
latter told of the advantages of practicing
them for a few minutes every morning or evening,
or both. Tell him what it will do for his
health and appearance and urge him to get
busy. There is no use drilling these exercises
in the armory. A few minutes once a week
or less often will do no good and wastes drill
time of which the guard has none to spare.

The detailed sergeants should help in all
drill work but especially should be valuable
in teaching camp expedients, care of equipment,
etc.

Use of
schools
for
N. C. O.

I believe that in nearly every state the
officers pursue a theoretical course each winter
and generally there is a non-commissioned
officersâ school as well. In the latter school
there should be thoroughly taught, giving
importance and precedence in the order
stated:

Infantry Drill Regulations,

Manual of Guard Duty,

[Pg 124]

Small Arms Firing Regulations, and
parts of Field Engineering.

Parts of the Field Service Regulations
should be read carefully in connection with
the study of the same subject in Infantry
Drill Regulations. If more time is available
map reading should be taught, and, if time
remains, then applied minor tactics on the
map. Attempt no more than you can
thoroughly

do in the time available and make the
course progressive.

Schools
for
officers

The school for officers should first cover
thoroughly the above course but take more
of Field Service Regulations and include the
Manual of Courts Martial. Map reading
should be thoroughly learned by all and the
remaining time put on tactics. Beginning
with minor tactics study some good problems
with their solutions, then solve others to be
criticised by some competent person. I have
found it satisfactory to use problems in this
way in connection with the drill regulations.
Study a subject, for example an advance
guard, then read a few tactical problems on the
same subject, then try solving one, and so on.

As you progress use larger and larger
forces. But do not attempt the brigade until
you can handle the regiment correctly. Do
[Pg 125]

not cover too much ground in one season and
acquire only confusion. Each term get
something positively fixed in your mind so
that you can use it; there will be more
winters.

Much attention should be given to acquiring
facility in giving correct verbal orders.

Studying tactical problems correctly
solved and solving others for yourself is the
best way to learn tactics after you know the
principles laid down in your manuals. Beware
of ânormal formâ solutions, they are
misleading and apt to be wrong. Apply
general principles with common sense. Advantage
should be taken of the officers detailed
as inspector-instructors to plan and
conduct this work as well as to help in the
instruction of the men. Only those thoroughly
competent for this instruction work
should ever be detailed with the national
guard.

There should be a camp of instruction
each year. If properly conducted this is very
valuable.

Camps
of instruction

Nearly all national guard infantry needs
training for individual men and officers and
work in the company, battalion and regiment.
When formed in divisions or larger
[Pg 126]

forces for maneuver campaigns the men in
ranks and junior officers get but little instruction.
Except a little camp experience, it
is chiefly walking, the object of which they
know nothing, and most of the officers are
not yet ready for this class of work. It is a
camp of instruction, not a campaign, they
need. They must apply on the ground what
they have learned in the armory.

I believe the best results can be obtained
from camps of not more than three regiments.
The special needs of each regiment should
be considered in forming the program. The
work should be planned so as to give instruction
to each in the most important things
in which it is deficient. Special consideration
should be given to what can not be learned
in the armory and must be done out of doors.

Most of the program should be made
up of practical drills and exercises in which
all get instruction from private to colonel, and
where their interest can be held and the best
instruction given. Small maneuvers of company,
battalion and regiment are what are
needed.

Tactical walks for officers and non-commissioned
officers are an excellent means of
instructionâthese supplement the other exercises.

[Pg 127]

The big maneuvers are very largely for
general officers and very little for regimental
officers. We need the foundation before we
build the superstructure.

As much ground should be covered during
the camp as is consistent with efficient instruction.
No attempt should be made to
cover the whole art of war in a week as it only
results in confusion of ideas and gives little or
no benefit.

Service
with
regular
companies

If the law would permit a few national
guardsmen to serve for short periods in the
regular army it would help greatly towards
uniformity of training and improve the non-commissioned
personnel of the guard. These
men should be allowed to so serve for three
months during the companyâs field training
period or for one month during the indoor
season; not more than five should be assigned
to any one company. They should receive
the regularâs pay and rations and, if joining
for the three months period, one complete
service uniform; the one-month men should
bring their uniforms with them.

This privilege should be granted only to
men who have still one year more to serve in
their enlistment in the guard and who are
recommended by their captains. They
[Pg 128]

should be excused from post guard and all fatigue
duty and in place of that receive additional
instruction work each day. In order to
obtain the most benefit, these men should
be attached to those companies whose training
is the best; in an indifferently trained
company they would get some benefit but it
would be little in comparison with what they
would receive in the other class.

This recommendation is made from having
recently seen the results of having a few men
of the national guard join an excellent regular
company for a short period. These men came
without pay and themselves paid their board
while with the company.

There would probably be no large number
who would so serve, but there are some and
we are in no condition in this country to overlook
even small helps that will contribute towards
fitting us for war.

Value
in war

Owing to the small peace strength of most
of these regiments and the large number of
recruits they must take in on the outbreak of
war, their value will depend on the time they
will require to be fit for the field at war
strength. They have the organization in
working shape. Their officers will, in the
majority of regiments, be men who have had
[Pg 129]

considerable training. If they will follow a
logical and systematic course of training in
peace, the officers will be familiar with it and
will be experienced instructors, and all their
old men will have the instruction to a certain
degree so that they can help drag up the recruits.
All this will help to shorten the time
required to fit them for the field and every
day thus cut off adds greatly to their value.

Without such training their value is small,
for no regiment should be accepted except at
war strength and a national guard regiment
so filled up, without experienced instructors
who know the course, will take nearly as long
to become efficient as would a new regiment.

[Pg 130]

IX

INSPECTIONS

Much can be done to improve the training
of our infantry by the inspections.
Most officers greatly dislike to have an adverse
report made by an inspector on their
commands. Fear of such a report sometimes
works to the detriment of sound training
and sometimes to its improvement.

Influence
of inspections

A captain once asked why he put so much
time on exercises of obviously little consequence
and so little time on others more important,
replied: âBlank will inspect this
year. He always pays great attention to
such and such an exercise and never examines
the company in the others. I want
a clean record on this inspection.â

We have all been influenced as was this
captain. Even if we do not care personally,
loyalty to our colonel or to the post commander
leads us to consider what the inspector
will require.

The author has no intention of criticizing
adversely the Inspector Generalâs Department;
its inspections have steadily improved
[Pg 131]

in recent years and become more
rational and consequently more beneficial.
His aim is rather to point out the place of the
inspections in the yearâs training and to
suggest how, in connection with the methods
of training proposed, they may be made both
searching and helpful toward real proficiency.

The
annual
inspection

In the annual inspection it is evident
that in the time available the inspector cannot
examine an organization in everything
it should know; he must choose certain
things and judge from those of the training
of the company or regiment.

In making this choice the relative importance
of the subjects must be kept in
mind. Of course every company must be
tried out in the combat exercises and in all
the things that should be made fixed habits.
It is of equal importance that no stress be
laid on non-essentials. For the rest, he
should select certain important things which
every company should know and inspect it
thoroughly as to its proficiency in those,
examining the various companies at a post in
different subjects so that a captain would feel
that anything in the whole course might fall
to his lot from properly making the pack to
establishing an outpost at night.

[Pg 132]

The inspector should make free use of the
war game map, tactical walks and every
other recognized means of instruction to find
out how well the officers and men of the
regiment are instructed and what class of
work each organization is doing.

In order to be fair to the organizations
inspected the annual inspection should be
made late in the season. It should never be
made before the officers have had a fair show
to instruct their commands.

Company
examination

Battalion
examination

The above inspection by an officer of the
Inspector Generalâs Department should not,
however, be the only one. At the close of
each period of training there should be an examination
of the organizations on the work
they are supposed to have done. The last of
March or first of April the field officers of the
regiment, as a board, should examine the
companies on the results of their winterâs
work; a similar examination should be made
at the close of the period of company field
training. When the battalions have finished
their period of field training the colonel and
lieutenant colonel should form the board to
examine them. If the brigade commander
be thoroughly posted on all matters pertaining
to infantry training his presence at the examinations
[Pg 133]

and careful supervision of the
work cannot fail to be very beneficial. His
supervision should not, however, lead to restriction
of the proper latitude which should
be allowed subordinates; his mission should
be to see that the instruction given is correct
and that the whole course has been satisfactorily
covered.

National
guard
inspection

The same general principles apply to the
inspection of national guard organizations.
If anything is found wrong with them the
inspector should not keep silent at the time
and content himself with rendering later an
adverse written report; he should tell the
officer being inspected what is wrong and take
pains to show him how to correct the error.
A helping hand, offered in the right spirit,
will always be appreciated.

[Pg 134]

X

TRAINING A NEW REGIMENT

Need for
quick
training

In this country we are liable to have the
necessity forced upon us of turning out
troops in the shortest possible time. We
shall have to use troops not fully trained; we
shall have to employ them as soon as they
can be used at all. Of course this system will
be frightfully costly in blood and money. In
war imperfectly trained troops must pay with
their lives for all mistakes. The better
trained they are, the fewer mistakes, the
more skill they possess the more cheaply can
any desired result be obtained.

It is the duty of all officers who may be
charged with the responsibility of preparing
this mass of untrained men for war service
to give the subject careful thought, to study
the question carefully and to be prepared on
short notice to take charge of such work and
produce the best results possible in the
shortest time.

Success in this hurried training can only
be secured if the man in charge thoroughly
[Pg 135]

appreciates his task and follows out a well prepared
and systematic course.

There are three phases of the problem:
Our regular regiments must be raised from a
strength of about 65 men per company to
nearly 150. The national guard regiments,
less well prepared, will have, as a rule, to
stand a still greater increase of new men, and
there will be hundreds of entirely new regiments
to be raised.

The commander

In outlining or suggesting a possible course
to be pursued in such cases let us take the new
regiment. The regiment must first be enlisted,
organized and equipped. This first
step will not be considered further than to say
that in its organization it is absolutely necessary
that its commander be an active, competent
officer, one who can train it and
prepare it for its work. In no other way can
the regiment be prepared to do anything
within a reasonable time.

To appoint an incompetent commander
to such a regiment would cost many lives,
would be a crime closely resembling murder
in the second degree.

An effort should be made in every new
regiment to have a reasonable number of
subordinates competent to act as instructors.

[Pg 136]

General
principles
of
training

Under modern conditions there is a minimum
amount of training that is absolutely
necessary before an organization can be put
in the field. The number of men lost to
an organization from disease depends on how
well the men are trained in caring for themselves
and how well the officers do their part.

Time is the all important element; we
must have these organizations in such shape
that they can be used as quickly as possible
and be as nearly good as possible. Of course
they will constantly improve in the field and
become excellent, but they will have to be
used before that state is reached. The occasion
for organizing such regiments will only
arise in case of great national danger, when
the utmost can be demanded of all. Hours
of work should then be all that can be profitably
employed. Most of the recruits will
be men accustomed to at least eight hours
work a day.

All that has been said previously as to
variety in the work, keeping up the menâs
interest, explaining and giving the reasons
for things done, applies even more to a new
volunteer regiment than to our regular
companies. Essentials only must be taught
at first, bearing in mind that discipline is most
[Pg 137]

essential and the use that can be made of
close order drill in obtaining it. Those things
that should be a habit must be drilled carefully
and frequently. Other essentials may
be hurried through for the first time, to give
the men the best general idea possible in the
shortest time, and then repeated and perfected
as time and opportunity offer.

As a rule our men will be intelligent and
quick to learn. Every little taught them, if
they have understood the reason for it, will
help them to do what is required even if their
instruction is not complete. With such
volunteers much instruction should be given
not as a drill but as a sort of lecture or talk.
The average American works better when he
knows the why and the wherefore. Remember
how different are his new life and surroundings
from what he is accustomed to
and how very little the average American
knows of an army and how much of that little
is not so.

In submitting a proposed schedule of training
it is fully appreciated that conditions will
vary greatly and any schedule must be suited
to conditions as they exist; it is doubtful if
the one here proposed would ever exactly fit.
It is only offered as a possible help.

[Pg 138]

It is assumed that the colonel is thoroughly
competent and that there are several men in
the command with some military training,
such as ex-regulars and national guardsmen
and those who have had training in a college
battalion. This latter assumption is a safe
one in this country.

Company
Cooks

It is very probable that every company
will have a cook that enlisted as such and
knows something of the art. But handling
the ration and army cooking have features
that are different from what he is used to unless
he has been trained in the army. The
company kitchen must be correctly run or
training will be difficult. Discontent and
a big sick report are fatal to success.

The first thing, then, is to instruct the
cooks and mess sergeants. Some one must
be found competent to do this and he must
look after the kitchens, correct mistakes and
give instruction until they are all running
properly. The new captains must learn
how to look after this work properly if they do
not already know. If the colonel can find
nobody else to do it he must do it himself. It
must be done. It is a very important part
of the foundation upon which success must
be built.

[Pg 139]

Paper
work

The necessary records and papers should
be properly kept and made, both at regimental
headquarters and in the orderly room.
This is important but not so much so as the
kitchens. The mistakes in paper work only
cause annoyance and confusion off the battlefield
and possibly will lose somebody some
money; but the other causes loss of life and
prevents efficiency. This work should be
properly taught. Some competent non-commissioned
officers or officer should be
given the task of instructing the clerks and
first sergeants. It is not difficult, at least the
essential parts, and it should be promptly attended
to upon organization but so as in no
way to interfere with training. An ex-regular
sergeant major, first sergeant or clerk
would be very valuable here. So far as possible
such a man should be made adjutant
of every new regiment of volunteers. His
value as an instructor in many things would
be great and he would save the colonel much
trouble and annoyance.

Band

From the first day of training the band
should be turned over to the surgeons for
thorough instruction as auxiliary sanitary
troops. At least two hours a day should
be devoted to this work until they become
[Pg 140]

proficient, after which, an hour or two a week,
to keep them so.

The band must also receive the necessary
drill so that it can be maneuvered as such.
Callisthenic drill, practice in marching, care
of themselves in the field, individual cooking,
and tent pitching must be taught. Three
hours daily should be devoted to this instruction
until satisfactory results are obtained,
after which only occasional drills are
necessary. This may interfere somewhat
with their music, but that can wait.

Surgeon

The regimental surgeon must also carefully
train his detachment. His officers must
not only be doctors but medical officers; his
men must be trained for field service as well
as for hospital attendants.

Machine
gun
company

Mounted
detachment

The training of the machine gun company
and mounted detachment must begin from
the start and follow generally the lines proposed
below for the companies. More attention
must be paid to their tactical instruction
than even to that of company commanders.
They must know their function
and how to do their part. The instruction of
these men as to field service, care of themselves,
callisthenics, cooking, etc., must be
the same as in the company. They must be
[Pg 141]

taught how to care for the animals and in the
case of orderlies how to ride and to scout.

Musicians

The company musicians will receive the
following instruction with their companies:
callisthenics, first aid and personal hygiene,
individual cooking, tent pitching and rifle
firing. They make all practice marches with
their companies. They will be grouped by
battalion and given at least one hour a day
of instruction in signalling, and the musicians
of the regiment assembled under the drum
major for instruction in the necessary marching
and maneuvering and practice with their
instruments. They should work about the
same number of hours per day as the other
men.

Those armed with a revolver must be instructed
in its mechanism and care, and firing
practice frequently held.

Callisthenic
drill

In the proposed schedule given below for
the companies an effort is made to provide
for the necessary muscular development referred
to before. The amount of this drill is
not as great as desirable but as the men progress
bayonet exercise and pointing and
aiming drill answer fairly well to supplement
this work. Some will object to any callisthenic
drill, under the assumed conditions,
[Pg 142]

as a waste of time. They are wrongâit will
save time in the end, keep down the sick report
and give better results.

Instructors
and
drill
masters

The colonel should carefully inventory
his command for instructors and drill masters.
In the early stages when divided into small
groups many are required; fortunately but
little military training is necessary for this
preliminary work.

Owing to shortage of good drill masters
groups for this preliminary work will have to
be larger than is customary in peace time in
the regular service, not less than eight men
to a group from the start, and these should
be combined into groups of two squads each
then into platoons, as soon as their work permits.
The best instructors should be kept as
drill masters after each consolidation.

For the callisthenic drills from the very
start the men can be combined into large
groups and instructors found who are already
competent to drill their squads in the school
of the soldier. The other squad commanders
who are imperfectly prepared must be assembled
at this time for drill and instruction
under the best officers and non-commissioned
officers in the regiment. They will be carefully
taught the next movements to be given
[Pg 143]

to the men and how to teach them to their
squads.

As these squad leaders are selected as far as
possible from those having had some military
training and the others from the brightest
and most intelligent men, it is believed possible
for them to keep ahead of their squads. It
becomes easier as the groups grow larger and
fewer instructors are required.

The drill will be given to the officers who
do not know it. The officers being formed
into a squad by themselves.

All trained officers must be on the drill
ground during all these drills by squad, supervise
the work, correct mistakes and help out
the poorer instructors. The other officers
not acting as instructors should be required to
attend about half to learn from seeing it done,
the other half of this time they should be required
to be drilled themselves and to study
the drill regulations. There should be no
hesitation in having lieutenants drill squads
during this period provided they are better
at it than some of the enlisted men and are
not needed to supervise the work of several
squads.

Officersâ
school

There should be an officersâ school every
evening except Saturdays and Sundays.
[Pg 144]

This should be conducted by the colonel himself.
The first subject taken up being the
drill regulations. Lessons should be short as
well as the sessions of the class and the work
thoroughly done. The student officer must
learn the text and the instructor fully explain
it where necessary. Much explanation will be
required in Part II.

The class must keep well ahead of the outdoor
work.

Besides the Infantry Drill Regulations, in
this school must be taught early in the course,
parts of the Guard Manual and Small Arms
Firing Manual. The essential parts of the
Field Engineering will be taught, and, those
not proficient therein, how to read military
maps. Lastly take up the Manual of Courts
Martial.

The more important parts of Army Regulations
should be included in the above course.
Better results will be obtained if the lesson
each day includes two or three selected paragraphs
from this book than by taking it up as a
whole and by itself. In its use this is largely
a book of reference. In this proposed way
the officers become familiar with it and how
to use it and the relatively few paragraphs
they must positively know are learned.

[Pg 145]

N.C.O.
schools

If, beside the colonel, the regiment has
three or more thoroughly competent officers,
the colonel will not require the others to
attend officersâ school but will order schools
for non-commissioned officers with these
others as instructors. The classes should not
be larger than one composed of all the non-commissioned
officers of a battalion and, if
instructors are available, those of only two or
three companies should form a class.

The work of this class will be largely confined
to Infantry Drill Regulations. First the
drill then combat and covering detachments
must be fully explained and the principles of
patrolling taught. If time is available these
schools will also take up other subjects taught
in our regular indoor course. Care must be
taken not to give the men more in one lesson
than they can learn.

If there be one, and less than three, competent
instructors for these non-commissioned
officers, a class will be formed in each battalion
and only two sessions held weekly for each,
the instructor taking them in turn. Lessons
in this case may be longer but the work cannot
be so well done.

If there be no one available except the
colonel, each captain will be required to have
[Pg 146]

a school in his company at the most convenient
hour and try to transmit to the men
what he has learned in the officersâ school.

The following instruction should be given
by demonstration or by talks given to the
men assembled and sitting.

Talks and
demonstrations

Part of it will be given by battalion, part
by company, 2 and 4 should be given by squad
or platoon, the leaders having first been instructed.
In the schedule this instruction is
designated by the word âverbalâ. Its value
will depend on the instructor.

List of subjects for instruction by talks
and demonstrations:

1. General duties of a soldier. His
relation to his officers. System of discipline.
Military courtesy. Customs of service as they
relate to him. An outline of organization.
Encourage the class to ask questions on the
subject in hand and kindred subjects and then
answer them.

2. The rifle, its mechanism and care and
how to clean it.

3. Care of the other equipment, especially
that of leather.

4. How to make the pack and adjust it.

[Pg 147]

5. Duties of a sentinel on the interior
guard. Sentinelsâ orders.

6. The most essential parts of the course
in personal hygiene and first aid.

7. Importance and necessity of fire control
and distribution.

8. Instruction as to artillery with a view
to diminish unreasonable fear of its fire.

9. Principles of patrolling.

10. Objects of advance and rear guards
and outposts.

11. Duties of a sentinel on outpost and
conduct of visiting patrols.

12. If time is available give more instruction
under 6.

Most of this is only preliminary to explanations
and instruction the men will get in
their drills. It is a start, and at the beginning
of his training will help to arouse interest and
gives some variety at the time when, in the
regular drills, but little variety is possible
and the drills are least interesting. A good
instructor will make this pay.

It is assumed in this schedule that the
season is between May and October. Work
beginning on a Monday.

once. Companies to have bayonet work for
at least two half-hour periods each week and
pointing and aiming drill once for some length
of time.

Dress parade by regiment three times

[Pg 160]

Results of
training

This regiment can be used at the end of
this three months. It will not be completely
nor even well trained but it is believed to be
the best that can be done in that time.

Can we have even this much time without
great sacrifice and loss? It is very doubtful,
and yet it is not believed practicable to use
volunteers with less training except in fortifications.

The work has been very strenuous for all;
the weaklings will have been eliminated.
Any one fit for a soldier in war could have
stood the strain, and the others had better be
eliminated before taking the field.

If at the end of our 13th week we find we
have more time, the work for the week following
should be reduced to three hours per
day and the schools, after that we may
resume the long days of work.

[Pg 161]

XI

RECRUITING

The method of recruiting has a decided
influence on effective training. It is
much harder to train a company whose recruits
dribble in a few at a time than one, all
of whose recruits for the year come in at once.

When
recruits
should
join

The best results can be obtained if these
recruits can all be had in the fall. As stated
before, the course of instruction should run
from November 1st to October 31st. In the
indoor season all that part of the instruction
course that can be given, should be. It should
be preparatory to the outdoor work. The
foundation of sound training should be laid
during this season; the recruit can then be
given his elementary instruction and be ready
to begin the outdoor work with the company.
The outdoor season is none too long in which
to go through properly the whole course of
work that should be taught outside.

If recruits are received late in the spring
or summer they are not prepared to do the
work with the company, they get only part
[Pg 162]

of it and that in a way that does not give good
results. It is like trying to teach Algebra
first, then Arithmetic. Another drawback to
this method is that it results in the captainâs
not having all his company for this outdoor
work. Our present peace strength is so low
that correct training in parts is difficult and
when much below this the training is very
imperfect.

Recruit
depots

Most, if not all, good captains very much
prefer to have their recruits directly on
enlistment to having them go to a depot for
several weeks. The training they receive
in these depots, in value, is out of all proportion
to the time spent. In their companies,
from the very start, while learning the
recruit drill they are learning much else of
value. The recruit is better off and more
contented. In his company there is a personal
feeling for him and interest in him not found
at the depot.

The instruction and ways of doing things
first learned are those of his company, not
always the case at the depot. The few movements
taught at the recruit depots must be
taught exactly right if precise close order
drill is to be had, it is harder to change a
recruitâs ways of doing anything than to teach
[Pg 163]

him the right way from the start. It has been
suggested that if the depots are kept up, all
drill thereat except callisthenics be prohibited.

Recruits dribbling in, waste effort. It is
as much bother to a company to train and get
one recruit into the company as a squad of
eight. The large number of men held at these
recruit depots would give a very desirable increase
in strength to our companies if we
could have them. The vaccinations that
are attended to at the depots could just as well
be done at the posts.

Plan of
recruiting

The following is offered as a plan of recruiting
that it is believed, would improve
that branch of the service and greatly improve
the training of our infantry:

All recruiting stations and recruit depots
in time of peace to be abolished.

Each regiment in the U. S. to be assigned
a permanent district within which its recruits
are to be found. The regiment may never be
stationed inside this district but its recruits
are all to come from there.

Early in November of each year, each regimental
commander to select a few recruiting
parties composed of an officer and three or
four men from his regiment to beat up this
district for recruits. They should visit the
[Pg 164]

small towns as well as have stations in the
larger ones. Before enlistment the recruits to
be physically examined by a doctor, either of
the Medical Corps or one hired in the district.

These recruits are to be sent directly to
their regiments in detachments as enlisted and
their training commenced.

As there are many young men who will
not enlist for service in the U. S., but do want
to go on foreign service, each home regiment
will, in addition to getting its own recruits, be
given the task of getting a certain number for
the Philippines, Hawaii and Panama, the number
being allotted by the War Department.
Men reÃ«nlisting should be sent, as far as practicable,
to foreign service. These latter will
be sent to designated posts and held long
enough to be properly equipped, vaccinated,
etc., and then be sent to their regiments.

Large cities like New York and Chicago
should not be assigned to a single regiment
but three or four regiments to have stations
there and part of the outlying districts to be
theirs to beat up.

These recruiting parties to remain out
until they have completed their quotas then to
return to their stations, but never later than
February 1st.

[Pg 165]

Advantages
of
plan

This plan offers several advantages and
some disadvantages, but is believed to be an
improvement.

Its advantages are:

All the recruits of the company come in at
one season and that the best one.

They come directly to the company on
enlistment.

Companies can be larger without increasing
strength of army.

The officer enlisting them belongs to the
regiment as does his recruiting party and will
exercise more care to get only suitable men.

The recruiting will be more widely distributed
and as the men go back to their homes
knowledge of the service, and trained men in
case of war, will be generally distributed.

Fewer men from the slums of the big
cities and more from small towns and rural
districts.

The men of a regiment coming from one
locality, year after year, a friendly feeling
for the regiment should be built up and future
recruiting assisted and, in case of a great war,
every section will have its nucleus of trained
men.

Discipline will be improved and desertion
[Pg 166]

diminished. The men will realize that their
comrades are from their home section and
people at home will know of their misdeeds.
Besides it is pleasanter for the men to serve
with those they have known before.

It cannot be asserted without a trial that
this method will be cheaper than the present
one but the author believes it will be.

To send out these recruiting parties will be
a considerable expense but to offset this there
is the cost of the present recruiting stations
for rent, the difference in the cost of commutation
paid and actual cost at posts, the
travelling expenses incurred sending recruits
to depots, often in an opposite direction from
that to their future posts, the costs of keeping
up these depots, a large amount, the
loss of the service of all the recruiting personnel
for any other valuable purpose during the
year as well as the cost for the time lost in
training of all the recruits.

The recruiting parties sent out by the
regiments are taken from trained men at the
season when they can be best spared and
probably they would be absent but for a
relatively short time.

If this plan be adopted the method will
work better each year. The men who have
[Pg 167]

gone back, and even those in the ranks,
can and will help in the recruiting, and as the
number of these increase recruiting will be
more easily and quickly done. Each village
will know that the party will visit it at a
certain season and many will be ready at once.

It will be more expensive the first year or
two than afterwards. The saving on deserters
should be large after the first two or three
years.

Discussion
of
objections

There are two apparent objections. That
there will be no large number of recruits in
hand to be sent to particular regiments in an
emergency. This is of small consequence.
Where the regiment is wanted for a sudden
emergency, the adding of a large number of
raw recruits is of no immediate advantage.

Suspending recruiting February 1st may
result at first in some regiments not being
filled up but this is doubtful. Most of our
original enlistments at present are made in
winter, and this would be offset, if it does
occur, by the other advantages enumerated.

Convenience of administration and keeping
records should have no weight as against
efficient training for action, the only reason
for our armyâs existence.

[Pg 168]

Possible
modification

If the infantry cannot have the above
system the following modification would
improve matters.

Each company to receive recruits but
once during the year, each in its turn and
regiments as nearly at one time as practicable.
The recruits to be sent out within one
week of their receipt at the depots except
those for foreign service. If the peace
strength of the companies be kept at 65, when
the company is assigned recruits it should be
filled to a strength of 80 it will then average
about 65 for the year possibly a few more.
It is not believed the total enlisted strength
of the army would be increased at all. It
would amount to having the men with companies
instead of in recruit depots.

The above will enable the captains to do
much better training and greater efficiency
will result.

Of course those who receive their recruits
in October or November would have a great
advantage over the others but all could do
better work.

Recruits enlisted in summer could be held
much longer than others and then, about
September 1st, sent to the regiments stationed
in the tropics. It is more comfortable for the
[Pg 169]

recruits if they can reach those stations
in the fall and get their first hard drills and
become acclimated while weather conditions
are most favorable. This would give the
regiments at home their recruits at a favorable
season if not the best for all of them.

Need for
a change
of system

Either of the above changes can be made
by a change in regulations and orders.

With our great population and military
needs and very small army it is folly not to use
what army we have so as to be as well prepared
for war as conditions permit.

In the preceding chapter it has been shown
how important it is that we have some trained
men for every new regiment. We must have
trained men to fill the regular army which
must bear the brunt of the first attack.

The present law does not provide this.
The enlistment law should be radically
changed to get the best results for training,
general efficiency and preparedness for war.

Enlistment
law

All men should enlist for 5 years. At
the end of one yearâs honest and faithful
service, except when serving beyond the
limits of the U. S., the man should, on his
application, be granted a furlough for the
remaining four years; if war breaks out, or becomes
so imminent as to call for mobilization,
[Pg 170]

these furloughs to cease and the men to rejoin.
The men to have the privilege of remaining on
in the service if they so desire and of taking
their furloughs at the end of any completed
year of service. Discharges not to be given
the men until the end of their full five years.
Hence these men can not reÃ«nlist in another
organization while on furlough, and there can
be no doubt of their status and liability for
punishment as deserters if they fail to rejoin
when called.

Men on
furlough

For the present, men should not be
required

to take the furlough and reÃ«nlistment
should not be prohibited, but remaining in
service with the colors over two years in time
of peace should not be encouraged; later,
if found practicable to get sufficient recruits,
reÃ«nlistment for all, except non-commissioned
officers and certain mechanics who first enlist
after that date, should be prohibited. Men
who have enlisted with the understanding that
they can remain in service until retired, provided
they behave themselves properly and
are physically fit, should be honestly treated;
they have an implied contract at the least.

Time on furlough not to count for retirement
or increase of pay, and men on such
furlough not to be counted in strength of
company.

[Pg 171]

Recruits on foreign service should have
the privilege of the furlough only after two
years service, and men with regiments in the
U. S. who wish to remain in the service, after
one yearâs service should be encouraged or
required to transfer to foreign service for the
next two years.

Men whose service in their first year has
not been satisfactory and who are not fairly
trained should be required to serve two years
before being granted a furlough. The law
should also provide that men, whose
conduct is found unsatisfactory by a board of
officers and the finding is approved by the
colonel, may be furloughed at any time after
two years service whether the man desires
it or not.

It is believed the plan would work if no
pay were given men on furlough, but if each
be paid ten dollars each six months on reporting
his address by mail to the adjutant of the
post it would help in finding him when wanted
and might be an inducement to some to enlist.

An effort should be made to get young men
as recruits. Boys of eighteen or over if physically
strong should be encouraged to enlist.
[Pg 172]

Young men are easier to train and for a longer
time afterwards are available for service.

We need a reserve but no men should be
enlisted directly for it. The reserve for the
regular service should be our men on furlough.
Men too long out of service and advanced in
years are not what is needed for the regular
service which must be ready at short notice
to face serious war.

Reasons
for enlistment
plan

The reasons for the foregoing recommendations
as they appear to the author are:

1. Five years is as long as the average
man is willing to pledge his future for military
service unless he means to make it a life occupation.
The latter class is not the best for
the government. Young men are the best for
the ranks in time of war. Men who serve only
long enough to be trained for the work are to
be desired. It results in a much greater number
of trained men being available in time
of war and is much cheaper, for it reduces
current pay and the retired list.

2. The great importance of having as
many trained men as possible and having them
dispersed through the country to help in the
formation of the new regiments at the outbreak
of war is apparent to any one who
thinks on this subject.

[Pg 173]

3. If recruits be received during the
winter months only, the organizations can
follow a prescribed course of instruction and
complete it annually. If recruits dribble in
throughout the year a proper course of instruction
cannot be satisfactorily given in
that time.

4. At the outbreak of war, it is of vital
importance that we have as strong a force
as possible of men fully ready trained and
equipped. The losses at first in this force will
be heavy. If green recruits, enough to fill
the regular organizations to war strength
and to make good the early losses, be poured
in on them they will cease to be trained organizations.
A reserve is a necessity. This
will provide it at small cost.

5. Many excellent and patriotic young
men are willing to serve a short time in the
army for the experience and training. Four
years, however, is longer than they are willing
to postpone settling down to their real lifeâs
work. These are the men it is most desirable
to get into the army, not as professional
soldiers, but as a trained reserve for war.
For the first years they are a reserve for the
regular companies, then they become available
for officers or non-commissioned officers
[Pg 174]

of volunteers. This class of young men will
enlist much more freely when they can do so
and lose only one year from civil pursuits.

6. Enlisting men as young as they are
physically fit interferes less with their civil
careers, hence will get us more desirable recruits.
The physical and mental discipline a
boy thus gets will help him in his future work
and the younger he gets it, so long as it does
not interfere with his schooling, the more it
will be worth to him. Taking the recruit
young, the five years while his military service
is with the regulars are the five best
for that purpose. Later when older, more
developed mentally and matured in judgment
he is best in higher rank than private with the
volunteers. If he enters at 18 he is available
at 23 for the volunteers or national guard and
has at least seven years left in which he can be
considered at his best.

7. The provision for letting men out at
the end of one year, provided their conduct has
been good and they are fairly instructed, will
be a great aid to discipline and a preventative
of desertion. A good many young men enter
the service thoughtlessly and find after a few
weeks that the life is different from what they
expected. They look ahead to over three
[Pg 175]

years more of it and the weak ones desert.
They are not vicious nor criminal as a rule but
this step injures them seriously; they become
prisoners or fugitives, and either will decrease
the manâs moral stamina and self respect.
This provision will greatly reduce this.
The man will see that he has only to behave
himself for the rest of the year to return to civil
life with a clean record. The great expense
resulting from desertion will be largely
eliminated. The men will be more contented,
they will feel they can leave in a short time if
they wish, which will tend to decrease the
desire to quit. This does not prevent those
staying in the service who wish to do so. A
few old soldiers are desirable.

Less than one yearâs training is not sufficient
in which to cover properly the course the
infantry soldier should have. Two years is
necessary to make a good job of it. But we
need more men who can be used in war.
With some thoroughly trained men in the
ranks it is believed better to have 100 others
of one yearâs training than fifty of two or
more.

Enlistments
for
the national
guard

The national guard should have the same
period of five years for enlistment with a provision
for inactive service, except in war,
[Pg 176]

after two years of service, unless the man has
had service in some other organization, as
a college battalion. Less than two years is
not enough training to be of value where so
little time per year is devoted to it.

While it has nothing to do with training,
there is another provision that should be in the
enlistment law; that is, that every man who
enlists for five years, and is in service when war
breaks out, shall be liable for service for at
least one year thereafter no matter when
his term expires. At the outbreak of a
great war is no time to discharge trained men.

[Pg 177]

XII

IN CONCLUSION

Relative
values

Time is wasted at most posts on some
things that are of little value compared
with the time spent on them.

âButtâs Manualâ is fine callisthenic drill
and at proper times should be practiced.
It would be just as valuable and even more so
if, instead of having the men learn to go
through it all without command, an instructor
gave the movements and the men
executed them purely for physical drill. The
cadence amounts to little, but executing them
so as to exercise properly the desired muscles
is important.

Many captains spend a great deal of time
practicing this so that their companies can
go through the whole series without command
and to music. It is pretty, and for
the chorus in a musical comedy act might
be a success, but for soldiers it is a waste
of valuable drill time that could and should
be put to better use.

Our inspectors have had something to do
with this, and county fairs and similar shows,
[Pg 178]

more. The narrow scope of instruction followed
in some companies, and the seeking
for the easiest way to kill the drill hour by a
few, has helped to give this its prominence in
our training.

Target
practice

Our target practice is open to criticism in
some respects. Its importance can not be
overestimated and it must not be slighted,
but rational methods should be followed. It
is necessary to appreciate fully what is
required and wanted.

The individual man must be a fairly good
marksman for two reasons: so that he can
place his shots in a designated locality, and
to give him confidence in himself. The
better the men can shoot, other things being
equal, the more confidence they have in themselves
and in each other. For practical results
on the battlefield an expert rifleman is of
little if any more value than a marksman.
Good, fair shooting by every man in the
company is what is desired.

On the battlefield much depends on the
confirmed habit, this habit-forming can not
be done on the target range, but throughout
the yearâs work. Not to exceed two weeks
a year should be allowed to any company for
known distance practice on the range. If
[Pg 179]

its work during the rest of the year has
been properly done, this is sufficient. The
rest of the time is needed for other work.
But the time put on field firing, where done in
the solution of correct tactical problems, cannot
well be excessive. The more of this the
better.

Extra
pay

The law granting extra pay to expert
shots, sharpshooters and marksmen is not
believed good in its effect; it gives undue
importance to range firing. An expert rifleman
without other training and discipline
is of but little value on the battlefield, while
even a second class shot, well trained and
disciplined, is infinitely his superior as a soldier.
This law should be amended so as to
divide the men into two classes: the best men in
each company to be rated as 1st class. To be
so rated the man must be thoroughly well
trained in
all
his duties, of excellent character
and 1st classmen or better in target shooting.
The extra pay for 1st classmen to be so
alloted as to cost the government no more
than is now paid for higher classifications.
Men have drawn this extra pay for qualification
as shots who were of but little account
as soldiers.

Rifle
firing
competitions

Rifle firing among young men in civil life
[Pg 180]

should be encouraged. It is a necessary
part

of a soldierâs training and is that much accomplished
toward making efficient soldiers
of them if the occasion arises.

Our rifle competitions take too much time
and are allowed to interfere too much with
regular training. Officers should not be
allowed to compete. Their work during
this season is with their companies; they
should be learning the duties of an officer not
that of the private in the ranks. It is undoubted
that a man can not make much of a
success teaching what he does not know.
The officer must know how to shoot well
enough to be an instructor, he must know
the theory and have the knack of instructing.
He does not need to neglect his regular work
for weeks at a time several summers to acquire
this at competitions.

The best company instructor in rifle
firing the author ever saw on a target range
was a first sergeant who himself never made
better than marksman. The company was
very short on sharpshooters and experts but
was still shorter on 3d class men. The poorest
instructor he ever saw was an officer whose
breast on state occasions was covered with
big medals for shooting. He had to spare his
[Pg 181]

own eyes so as to make phenomenal scores;
the instruction of the new men in the company
was of little importance compared with the
former.

Proper
garrisoning

The proper garrisoning of the army, to
avoid so much necessary labor and afford
better opportunities for training, has been
given great attention by the War Department.
May it soon meet with success. But
much can be done even under present conditions
to help in this matter. This beautiful
parking perfectly kept is pretty, but it takes
ground needed for other purposes and requires
an immense amount of âfatigueâ
labor. This labor could be reduced: the
parks would not be so pretty but military
efficiency would be greater. For which does
the government spend its money?

Strength
of the
company

Our companies should be increased in size
to 100 men in peace, in war to 150. Our
companies are now too small for good training;
it requires too many new men to raise
them to war strength, and the present strength
is wasteful of money and effort.

With the companies at a fixed peace
strength of 65 it means much of the time still
less. There are not enough men to drill in the
regular platoon formations. In our extended
[Pg 182]

order work the captain is reduced to the
capacity of a platoon commander and platoon
commanders are out of a job. These
men do not get practice in the handling of
their proper units and it can not fail to diminish
their interest and enthusiasm and result
in poorer work as well as in incomplete work.

In the case of war we shall need our regular
organizations very promptly and as efficient
as possible. At the same time these organizations
are certain to lose many officers taken
for other duties. The addition of much more
than one man to each two then in ranks, even
if they have been previously trained, is a
serious blow to efficiency. The new men must
either be untrained or men from a reserve.
If from a reserve they are rusty on many
points and are apt to be strange to the officers
who change in a company so frequently.
Adding 50 reservists to a company of 100 men
will do no harm; adding 85 to a company of 65
will be very different and, if the men added
in the second case be untrained recruits, we
shall not have a trained unit but a school of
instruction.

A great objection to our present strength
is the fact that it is so wasteful of money and
effort.

[Pg 183]

The object of the army is to have a trained
force ready for action and to help train the
great mass of men that will be called out in
case of war. We want as many trained men
as possible, both for the ranks and to help
prepare others. Since we cannot have a
large army we should do all we are able with
what we have.

We have in the regular army an expensive
plant; the interest on cost and overhead
charges form a large part of the annual cost,
the cost for privates is relatively small. There
is a demand and need for the output, trained
soldiers; yet we produce less than half of what
we could for the same cost, except pay of privates.
With no increase in interest on plant
and pay of officers and senior non-commissioned
officers and administration, we could
more than double our output of trained men
and more than double our efficiency for war,
and the training would be much better.

A private corporation doing business this
way would probably go into bankruptcy.

New organization
in war

One thing should be made a fixed policy
and made positive law now so that in case of a
real war it will be carried out. All organizations
received into the service for the war must
be at full strength.

[Pg 184]

We shall require in such a war a very large
army which means the utilizing of all the
organizations we now have and forming
many new ones. By filling all existing organizations
to war strength we reduce the
number of new ones to be formed and utilize
their training capacity to the best advantage;
they can not be taken at their existing strength
and state of training and have much value
in battle. We shall need so many men that
must be trained that we must use what
means of training we have to its utmost.

By reducing the number of new organizations,
more and better officers can be used for
their training; there will be more chance of getting
the necessary instructors for them. A
few of the right kind of men can fit for service
a full strength regiment as well as one of half
strength and better officers and non-commissioned
officers can be found for it, for
there will be fewer required and the average
can be higher.

Besides the difference in cost, administration,
road space on the march, and the
tactical handling when massed in great
numbers, are of great importance and are
much better done with fewer organizations.

The
armyâs
responsibility

Upon the army today rests a great responsibility.
[Pg 185]

With our small numbers and
many faults in organization and stations we
must be as nearly ready for a great war as possible;
not only personally ready but do what
we can to make the organization of a great
and efficient army, if it ever becomes necessary,
a possibility.

This means we must study and know our
profession thoroughly, give a helping hand
to the national guard when and where we
can and to any other organization that does
something toward the military training of
men who may make up this great army if it
has to be raised. We must remember that
there are many things to be taught a man
before he is an efficient soldier; all he learns
before he joins a volunteer regiment is that
much of a help.

But our chief duty, after personal qualification,
is to make the best soldiers possible
out of the men under us. This is what we
are paid for and this is worth much more to
our country than anything else we can do in
peace. We should make the best we can of
the conditions as they exist at our post,
they may not be favorable for getting the best
results but that is no reason for our not getting
the best possible.

[Pg 186]

The quitter, the man who does as little as
possible, who always wants to be away from
troops because things are not as he thinks
they should be, or who does nothing because
he cannot do it exactly as laid down, is a
curse to the army; he should leave the
service and sell ribbons.

Rational, systematic training besides
producing the greatest military efficiency
will keep the men interested in their work and
will occupy more of their time; the men will
be more contented. Interested and contented
men will furnish a smaller sick report and
fewer deserters. There will be less dissipation
hence less punishment.

Discontent, ennui, a constant grouch,
injure digestion and bring on other physical
ills. This is another responsibility resting
on officersâthat for the men under them.
With young men we have a great influence
on their characters and future careers. We
make men better fit for lifeâs work or turn
them back worse than we found them.

To the credit of the army it can be said
that in most cases an enlistment served therein
is a benefit to the majority who so serve.
The men are physically and mentally better
for a short service and I believe morally.
[Pg 187]

There is certainly less excessive drinking
among our soldiers in nearly all regiments
than in a corresponding number of civilians
in the same vicinity, and the same is true as
to other vices. In personal cleanliness, decency
and politeness they are far ahead of the
average man of the same social standing as
that from which they come. Many employers
have recognized this, and are giving
preference to discharged soldiers in employment.
The uniform makes the man
conspicuous and one drunken soldier in a
thousand will call for more attention than
ten drunken civilians out of five hundred.

The duty of trying to improve the men
morally is a military as well as a moral duty.
It is in line with what has been said before:
the better the man, the more valuable the
soldier, the more he can be taught, the more
he can help to train others, and the more
likely is he to remain in physical condition
to be fit for service in the field.

âWe have a profession not a trade.â Let
us take it seriously, appreciate our responsibility,
make the best of conditions as we
find them, improving them where we can,
and train ourselves and those under us to be

The Best Infantry

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

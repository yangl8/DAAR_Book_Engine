PART ONEâTHE SECRET OF THE SCUPPERS

CHAPTER I

Tells briefly of the
extraordinary episode which ended his service in the Flying Corps, and gives
also a glimpse of his adventurous career.

The reports in the American newspapers of the loss of Tom Slade, aviator,
were read by his many admirers and friends with a sense of shock and with
feelings of personal bereavement.

Notwithstanding that his former comrades on this side of the water had not
seen him for more than two years and knew that the character of his service, as
well as his temperament, would be sure to take him where danger was greatest,
the accounts of his dramatic end, set forth in cold type, seemed hardly
believable.

It is the one familiar name in the casualty lists which brings the war home
to one more forcibly than does the loss of a whole division.

But for all that, we received the news pretty calmly and made little fuss until
after the great metropolitan dailies had mentioned poor Tom as a national hero.
Then we sat up and took notice. When the
Tribune
phoned to our local
Scout Council for a photograph of Tom (âany photo would do,â they said) our own

Bulletin
published an editorial which would have made poor Tom ashamed
to walk down Main Street. And when the
Times
blazoned forth the heading,

JERSEY FLIER DIES A HERO

our
Bulletin
got another photo from Tomâs scout
patrol and printed it on the front page. Then the Girlsâ Patriotic League got
hold of this picture and had it enlarged, and it was displayed for a week or
more in the window of Blanchardâs Drug Store.

All we needed was a little nudge from New York and then we paid our tribute
proudly and handsomely.

But there was one quarter where pride was lost in a sense of personal sorrow
and bereavement, and that was in the local scout troop, of which Tom had been a
member and a moving spirit.

I remember very well meeting Roy Blakeley as I stepped off the train that
afternoon and, knowing him for the light-hearted youngster that he was, his
condition seemed pitiable.

âHave you got a New York paper?â he asked me. âIs it true?â

He had evidently been waiting for the evening papers which came down on the
train that I usually take, and as he stood there, trim and spruce in his scout
regalia, his hat on the back of his head as usual, and craning his neck for a
glimpse of the paper even before I unfolded it, his evident grief went to my
heart.

âYes, itâs true, Iâm afraid,â I said.

âYou remember about Quentin Roosevelt,â he almost pleaded. âThey thought for
a while
he
was savedâtaken prisonerâââ

âYes, that hope was justified, Roy,â I told him, âbecause all that was
known for a few days was that he had been in combat with a Hun plane and had
not returned. This is different. Youâve got to face the fact and not flinch,
just the same as Tom faced the enemyâwithout flinching.â

I opened the paper and we stood there together in a little recess of the
Bridgeboro Station, and while I read the article aloud Royâs eyes were riveted
upon it, as if he almost doubted the truth of my words. In the Temple Camp
office in the big bank building across the street hung a service flag with a
single star upon it. It was there that Tom Slade had been employed. I noticed
how Royâs eyes wandered over to it every few seconds as if that, since it still
hung there, somehow proved the falsity of the published reports.

JERSEY BOYâS DRAMATIC END

THOMAS SLADE OF THE FLYING CORPS

PLUNGED THREE THOUSAND FEET TO DEATH

WHILE PURSUING BOCHE PLANE

HEROIC TRIUMPH PRECEDES HIS TRAGIC END

Wreaks Vengeance in the Clouds Before He Falls.

Vow to Kill Hun Who Bombed American Hospital

Kept in Thrilling Victory in the Skies

The War Department confirmed today the Associated Press report of the loss
of Thomas Slade, aviator, in the fighting west of Rheims, while in pursuit of
an enemy plane. Slade, who was known among his comrades as âThatchy,â was
exceptionally popular and his tragic fate has cast a feeling of gloom
throughout the section where he had been lately stationed. His superiors in the
Rheims section had no hesitancy in describing his last exploit as
unquestionably showing skill and daring of the first order, and his loss will
be keenly felt in the service.

Further details of Sladeâs end are awaited, but it is feared that little
more than the bare facts of this sensational climax of his career will be
forthcoming. A strong touch of human interest characterizes his final part in
the war by reason of an announcement the youthful flier is said to have made to
some of his comrades. When the Germans crossed the Marne in their recent
advance a Boche machine dropped bombs upon a Red Cross hospital near Epernay,
killing two women nurses. Slade himself was a patient in the hospital at the
time, recovering from a slight wound he had received near La Chapelle. He was
on the veranda of the little hospital at about dawn, following his restless
habit of wandering about within the prescribed limits, and chafing under a
convalescence which he believed was needlessly keeping him from service. He saw
the Boche plane drop the bombs in the first light of dawn and watched it escape
while two French fliers pursued it. One of the nurses, a French girl, had cared
for the young American, and his comrades in the hospital are said to have
recalled that his sorrow and anger were so great that he expressed the resolve
to find and kill this Hun messenger of frightfulness if he lost his own life in
doing so.

This resolve was kept in the dramatic combat which ended Sladeâs career.

By what means he identified the enemy machine is not known, but he is known
to have pursued it till both machines disappeared in the clouds over the enemy
lines. The character of the tragic conflict which took place in the concealment
of that dizzy height can only be conjectured, but the enemy plane was seen to
fall, and the strong wind which had blown up in the west brought it into the
little village of La Toi, just within the Allied lines. The machine was a total
wreck and though its pilot was quite dead and frightfully mangled from his
tremendous fall, it was evident from a wound on his forehead that he had  paid
the penalty of his cowardly and despicable act before  he fell less than five
minutes after his fall Sladeâs machine was seen to descend, first coasting,
then fluttering as if without control, and when still more than a thousand feet
in the air it plunged headlong to the ground. Its occupant was seen falling
separately and both are known to have struck upon the rocky hillside where the
Germans made such stubborn resistance in the fighting of last Tuesday. It is a
matter of deep regret that the body of the gallant young American, crushed and
mangled as it must have been, did not fall within the American lines.

âHe might haveâââ Roy began in a kind of daze.

âNo, my boy,â I told him, âwe may as well face the fact. No man in the
history of this world ever fell a thousand feet without having his life crushed
out. Even if he landed on a haystack instead of a jumble of rocks, it would
have killed him. Look hereâââ

I felt as if I were myself guilty of some form of brutal frightfulness as I
pointed to the little supplementary notice upon the substance of which I
supposed that the government had based its official confirmation of Tomâs
death.

An official report to Washington states that a German aviator, flying over
the American lines, dropped the cap which Slade had worn into an American camp.
It contained the metal identification disk which the young flier had worn on a
cord around his neck, and a small badge linked with it which is thought to
signify some honor greatly prized in the ranks of the Boy Scouts of America.
With these trinkets was a note in German saying that young Slade had been
buried in the village of Pevy and that a cross with his name upon it had been
placed over his grave.

I think neither of us spoke for fully a minute. I am sure that Roy could not
have trusted himself to speak.

âSo you see,â I finally said, âthat even the Huns recognized his gallantry
and his heroism.â

âThey
had
to,â said Roy with a kind of pitiful
defiance.

We strolled up the hill, neither of us speaking.

âYou know what badge it was, donât you?â he asked.

His earnest question and the evident struggle he was having with himself
gave me a momentary pang of regret, almost of shame, that I had never taken a
very lively interest in the Scouts and especially in this one who had died a
hero.

âNo, Iâm afraid I donât, Roy,â I confessed.

âIt was the Scoutsâ Gold Cross,â he said. âIt means he risked his life to
save a fellow when he was a scout.Â .Â . It was a little sick fellow that he saved.â

âHis wearing it shows how he always remembered the Scouts, doesnât it?â I
observed weakly, for I hardly knew what to say.

âNone of the people here really knew him,â he said, ignoring this
remark.

âHe was probably of a more retiring nature than you, Roy,â I said. But the
pleasantry was lost upon him.

We strolled on up the hill in silence and stood for a moment chatting in
front of his home, which is one of our show places here in Bridgeboro.

âMr. Ellsworth found him down in Barrel Alley,â Roy said; âhe was a hoodlum.
After he got to be a scout he went ahead of us all. Even Mr. Temple had to
admit itâand you know how kind of grouchyâas you might sayâMr. Temple is
sometimes.â

I nodded, smiling.

In a general way, I did know the story of how John Temple had become
interested in the Scouts through the reclamation by them of this hapless
orphan, and before I left for France myself (which was on the following
Friday), I learned more of the young heroâs history. I have since had reason to
regret that I did not look more carefully at the several pictures of the boy
which were displayed in Bridgeboro after the news of his death reached us. They
were pictures of a Boy Scout, to be sure, and two years makes such a difference
in a boyâs appearance that I dare say I would not have recognized the aviator
from the stolid-faced, khaki-clad youngster whose photo our local paper
reproduced with such vaunting pride.

It was Mr. Ellsworth, that untiring scoutmaster, who told me the story of
Tom as far as he knew it. He said that as Tom had been the best all-around
hoodlum in town, so he had become the best all-around scout; that it was
attributable directly to Tomâs wonderful reformation that Mr. Temple had been
drawn, neck and shoulders, as he said, into the scouting movement and had
founded and endowed Temple Camp in the Catskills, which I believe has come to
be regarded as one of the finest scout camps in the country.

He told me how Tom had left the Scouts to work on a transport; how his ship
had been torpedoed and he had been taken aboard a German submarine and
incarcerated in a German prison camp. From that point information about him was
scanty and contradictory. He had escaped (so Mr. Ellsworth had heard) from the
prison camp and somehow had made his way to France where he was next heard from
as a motorcycle dispatch rider.

How and when he had got into the Flying Corps Mr. Ellsworth did not know,
for he had been heard of as an aviator only a month or two prior to the
shocking news of his heroic end.

For a week or two after the news came, the name of this heroic young scout
was on every lip, but I must confess that when I went away the thought which
lingered with me most persistently was not so much that of the young fellow
whose career had been so varied and remarkable but of that comrade of his
scouting days who took the young aviatorâs loss home to himself with such a
sense of personal bereavement. Stouthearted champion as he was of his friendâs
prowess, I verily believe that the heart which beat under that trim scout
regalia was still buoyed up with a forlorn hope that some belated report might
yet prove the governmentâs authenticated announcement to be false. There was a
kind of heroism in this challenge to careful and methodical old Uncle Sam which
I am afraid appealed to me more even than did Tomâs exploits and noble
sacrifice, and I felt that if I could only do the impossible and assure Roy
that his friend still lived and would come home, it would afford me a keener
joy than I had ever known.

I cannot for the life of me say what the reason was for Royâs making a
particular confidante and companion of me during the few days that I remained
in Bridgeboro. Perhaps his memory of our stroll up the hill together the day
the sad news reached town, and the fellowship of sympathy which then sprang up
between us, made him regard me as in some special way his friend.

However it was, on the morning that I left home for the long journey which
was to mean so much to us both, I found Roy swinging his legs from the railing
of my porch waiting, so he explained, to help carry my luggage down to the
station. In the stressful days to follow I always remembered him as he looked
thenâa roguish smile upon his face which had been so clouded with his brave
grief, his scout hat on the back of his curly head and the scarf he always wore
hanging loosely around his neck. I was quite taken aback by this undeserved
attention.

âYou said you didnât know much about the Scouts,â he reminded me. âOne thing
about them is that a scout has to do a good turn every day, and I just happened
to think this would be a good one.

âI hope I may be able to return it some day,â I said, quite overwhelmed.

âThen Iâd only have to do another one,â he answered briskly. âYouâd only
make matters worse.â

âI see,â I laughed, letting him take one of my grips.

So we went down the hill together and I was glad to see that his accustomed
buoyancy was gaining the upper hand at last. We did not speak of Tom until the
train had actually come to a stop and he handed me my grip.

âAs long as youâre going over there,â he said, rather hesitatingly, âmaybe
youâll hear more about Tomâhow he died, I mean.â

âFrance is a big place, Roy,â I warned him, âbut if I can get any details be
sure Iâll remember them to tell you; Iâll remember that I owe you a good turn,â
I added.

Thus we parted. And I am afraid, as I said before, that I thought more about
Roy on the way over than I did about his dead hero pal. As the great ship made
her perilous way in silence and darkness through the danger zone, I thought of
the trim figure which had waited for the evening papers at the station on that
sorrowful day, of the service flag with its single star hanging in the window
across the street, and of this same trim figure, with its brown face and clear
eyes and curly hair, swinging its legs from the railing of my porch, waiting to
do me a good turn.

I am afraid that I did not think so much about that lonely, rough-made grave
in the little village of Pevy in devastated, bleeding France.

CHAPTER II

Tells how I chanced to learn something of
Sladeâs career and of the circumstance which was destined to send me out of
France.

My own adventures as a correspondent on the west front would seem tame
enough in comparison with the exploits which I purpose to relate, and I will
not weary you with a rehearsal of my experiences and observations, especially
since the account of these has appeared from day to day in two of our American
newspapers.

I am afraid that amid the roar of battle and with the continual sight of
death and bloodshed all about me I gave little thought to the young fellow from
my home town in far-off America who had given his life for the great cause.
What had seemed glorious and heroic in Bridgeboro was divested of much of its
dramatic and noble quality by the sights which I beheld each day. I was present
when Arliss, that daring young ace, fell to his death, and I knew, or at least
I thought at the time, that no career could have been more adventurous than
his and no death so splendid.

I did not, however, forget to make inquiries in responsible quarters about
the death of Tom Slade and being for a time in the neighborhood of his final
exploit, I was able to gather a few details which amplified and unquestionably
confirmed the accounts of his career and death as published in America.

It was not until long afterward that I learned from a very responsible
source how Slade had got into the Flying Corps, a matter which interested me
greatly, since the last his friends in America had heard of him before the news
of his death came, he had been in the Motorcycle Service. This and much other
astonishing information I received during my journey in the Alps of which you
shall hear the true account. I say
true account
because
it has been published in connection with that frightful journey that I assisted
a deserter, a report which has not one word of truth in it.

I purpose, as well as I may, to recount this whole extraordinary business
exactly as it unfolded itself to me, rather than to attempt a consecutively
ordered narrative; and whatever it may lose in the way of skilfull
story-writing, it will at least have the solid advantage of being the plain
truth, plainly told. I am quite certain that no one except myself is in a
position to tell of this journey and I am equally certain that I would rather
die tomorrow than go through again the unspeakable horrors which I
experienced.

So much for myself, and I will pick out of all this jumble of amazing
happenings with their tragic climax, the episode of my stay in the hospital
near Epernay as being a convenient and appropriate starting-point for my
tale.

This hospital, as it turned out, was the one where Tom had spent upwards of
a month recovering (according to the American newspapers) from a âslight
wound.â The âslight wound,â as I learned, had all but killed him. A cruel wound
in the head it was, received in an exploit which was only less extraordinary
than the one which shortly afterward put an end to his career.

I mean to tell you of this incident as I learned it from the surgeons and
nurses, and also of one or two still earlier adventures of the young flyer
which I heard of while I was under treatment.

But first I must tell you of an experience of my own which put me in the way
of learning these things and laid the foundation, as I might say, for my
learning other things.

I was gassed. I have read various accounts of how people act and feel when
they are gassed and I have seen an actor in the movies demonstrate these
agonies by many graceful contortions, but the only thing that I can remember
about the actual occurrence was that my head felt just as oneâs foot feels when
it is âasleep.â I remember trying to shake my head, just as one shakes his
foot.

I suppose I was not gassed very badly or I would not be here now. In the
days of my suffering I was told that I had only myself to blame which, of
course, was a great consolation to me. I do not know what became of my mask,
but I still have my fountain pen and I should like to show it to you. The
silver filigree work which covers it is changed to a rich green color, making
the whole thing very beautiful and altogether unique. Fritzie did this with
his abominable gas. I do not know what kind of gas it was, but I treasure my
pen as being a sample of clever artcraft work, made by the Germansâthough not
made in Germany.

CHAPTER III

Tells how I looked at the Scuppers through
a field glass, and of how I resolved on a very hazardous enterprise.

I must tell you in some detail of this experience of my own since, as I
said, the whole story hangs upon it.

You will understand that at the time of Tomâs tragic exploit the big bulge
in the straining line which the Germans had made in their drive toward the
Marne, and which was known as the Marne salient, had been entirely wiped out by
the allied forces. The line ran almost straight between Soissons and Rheims
with the little village of Pevy, where the Germans had erected the cross, lying
a short distance within the enemy lines. So the line remained for some time
while Marshal Foch was pressing forward elsewhere.

My first experience of actual warfare was when I joined the boys near
Jonchery, prepared to accompany them northward toward the Aisne River. There
was not much fighting in that advance. The Germans picked up like a lot of
squatters and retreated so fast that twice we lost touch with them altogether,
but we had the heroic satisfaction of capturing no end of deserted baggage. I
think I never saw so many musical instruments and parrots as they left behind,
and, indeed, the love of pets and music which those wretches showed has always
been a matter of marvel to me. One of these squawking birds, I remember, was
flapping its wings, all bewildered, upon the top of a post, to which (I was
told) several British Tommies had been tied and tortured, and shrieking, âCut
their throats, cut their throats!â at the top of its expressionless voice. They
are strange people who are so gentle and patient that they can teach these
birds as no others can and then can play a tune on the mandolin and then
torture a man to death.

After several days of this inglorious marathon race, the Germans made a
stand upon the summit of a hill. I understood that our immediate objective was
Pevy, which I remembered as the village where Tomâs grave was, and it gave me a
great deal of satisfaction to know that this place must presently fall to our
troops and that the grave would be at least on friendly soil.

But Pevy was not to be so easily taken. The hill which confronted us
descended in an almost sheer precipice upon the near side and I think I never
saw such a rocky chaos as it presented.

My friend, Lieutenant Wells, let me view it through his field glass, and a
more depressing, bleak and desolate place I never beheldâa jungle of gray
boulders it was, and naked earth, as if the hill had been split open like an
apple and one-half taken away.

âThatâs where Fritzie mowed us down a while ago, when he was headed for the
Marne,â said the lieutenant.

âYou mean from the summit?â I asked.

âYes, our boys tried to scale that stone-yard and stop the advance. We
outnumbered them three to one just there, but they held out. Some of us got on
top, but it was no use.â

I donât know what put it into my head unless it was the knowledge that this
place was near upon Pevy and west of Rheims, but it occurred to me that perhaps
this was the very ârocky hillsideâ which the American newspaper had mentioned
as the place where Tom fell. I remembered the phrase âin the fighting west of
Rheims,â and also âthe rocky hillside where the Germans put up such a stubborn
resistance.â

âDo you suppose that is where Slade, the aviator, fell?â I asked.

âThatchy?â he queried. âYes, it is. Just a little to the left,â he added,
moving the glass for me. âDo you see two big rocks with points? One a little
higher than the others?â

Our detachment had gone on along the road which flanked the hill, for, of
course, there was no intention of surmounting the forbidding place, and it was
important that we pass out of range of it before the enemy gain the vantage
point of the summit.

For half a minute I looked upon the very spot where Slade had fallenâtwo
big, gray rocks somewhat more than midway up that cheerless cliff and I thought
of that traveller described in a poem of Scottâs, who died in some remote,
forlorn spotâunfriended and alone. The two rocks formed a sort of gutter on the
precipitous hill, and a quantity of descending debris had fallen against them,
forming a chaotic mass there.

âI suppose he rolled down against those and caught there,â I said, still
looking at the place through the glass.

âGuess so,â said the lieutenant, half interested. âThey call them the
Scuppers. I heard a couple of Signal Corps men saying that the Huns must have
found Slade in the ScuppersâGod-forsaken looking place, huh?â

I could not speak just then. Of all the lonesome places to die, that gray,
cold, forsaken waste seemed the most terribleâa spot more barren and heartless
than the sea, and ugly with a kind of brutal ugliness. And that, I reflected,
was where Tom Slade of my own home town in far-off America fell to his heroic
death. I wondered how long he had lain there and suffered beyond the help of
surgeons and nurses.

âHeâs buried in Pevy,â I said; âthey had the decency to take him there and
give him a Christian grave.â

The lieutenant had already taken his glass from me and was moving away. He
was not greatly interested in Tom Slade.

âDo you think,â I said, âthat if I climbed up there and looked at the place,
I could manage to get the rest of the way to the summit and join the detachment
before they reach Pevy? I want to be in at the finish.â

âYou might do it in a newspaper or in the movies,â he said, for he would
never let me forget that I was a fountain-pen warrior.

âPlease remember,â said I (for I was getting a little weary of such talk),
âthat the correspondents have done great work in this war. As for the movies,
Iâll show you that I am as good as Douglas Fairbanks himself, for I am going to
climbâââ

âScale that dizzy height, you mean,â he taunted; âthatâll sound good in a
special article.â

âIndeed!â said I. âWell, then, I am going to âscale that dizzy heightâ and
see where Tom Slade fell, for he came from the little town in Jersey where I
belong.â

âYouâll be killed by the Germans,â said he.

âYou forget I have my trusty fountain pen with me,â I replied,
scathingly.

He tried to dissuade me, saying that when I reached the summit I was just as
likely to fall in with the enemy as with our own men and that unless I expected
to defeat them single-handed I had better follow the route prescribed by the
officers. But I was a free agent in such matters; no charge of desertion or
disobedience could be laid against me, and I was resolved that come what might
I would take some memento from that lonely spot back to my young friend in
America.

Little I thought at the time what that memento would be.

CHAPTER IV

Tells of how I visited the Scuppers, and of the first of two discoveries which I made there.

You are to understand that the road which we had followed from Jonchery
appeared from a distance to run straight into this precipitous jungle of rock
and broken earth, but a short way from the base it verged to the westward,
running through a dense wood and, as our officers were well aware, led up the
easy west slope of the hill.

It was thought unlikely that the slight advantage which their precedence up
this hill might give them would tempt the Germans to pause and give battle
there, for they were running as suburbanites run to catch their trains. But if
they should emerge upon the top of this towering cliff before our boys had
verged out of range of it into the woods there might be an unhappy story to
tell. I did not realize it while I was tramping along rather faster than is my
wont, but I knew afterward that this peril had been averted by a pretty
narrow calculation on the part of our officers and some pretty good
sprinting of the men.

As it turned out, our detachment was well out of range of the height and
pushing rapidly westward through the protecting woods when I found myself
standing alone in the shadow of the rock-ribbed ascent. A better target one
could scarcely imagine, and I reflected on the danger in which I was placing
myself for no better reason than a sentimental, perhaps a sort of morbid,
desire to see the spot where Tom Slade had fallen.

One advantage I had, and that was the declining sun which flickered the
rocks with glints of changing light, and I consoled myself with the thought
that it would soon be dusk.

Between myself and the cliff lay an expanse of marshland a quarter of a mile
or so in width, I should say, and into this I plunged, wallowing through the
mushy undergrowth and stumbling the more because I must keep my eyes fixed upon
the summit of the hill.

No sign of life was there upon that frowning cliff, only the little crimson
glints, coming and going as the light failed.

Once and again I fancied these to be soldiers, and a particularly steady
glare in what seemed to be a clump of foliage troubled me with misgivings lest
the light might be reflected from the steel of a machine-gun.

I had thought of carrying a large bunch of swamp growth by way of
camouflaging myself, but it was quite difficult enough to move through the
swamp without that handicap. Once I got a footing upon something hard and the
pressure of my weight sent the other end of it bobbing up out of the mushy
scum, and I was startled to see a skeleton leg with a few shreds upon it
sticking up and hanging over at the knee in a gruesome manner. A German helmet
lay near the skull, which I had trodden upon. As I plodded on the ghastly thing
settled itself again into the marsh as if it had been prematurely awakened out
of a peaceful slumber.

I was pretty thoroughly drenched when I reached the foot of the hill and it
occurred to me that by rolling in the dry earth there I might acquire an
appearance conforming to the hue and character of my surroundings. That done, I
began my climb.

The ascent was not quite as precipitous as it had looked from a distance,
but it was all up and down, the loose earth sliding so in places that I kept
slipping back and seemed to make no more progress than a horse on a treadmill.
Moreover, there was great danger from descending stones in these places, for
the whole land above seemed in process of erosion and one big rock, in the
shelter of which I paused to rest, went tumbling away below me leaving me
sprawling.

At last, after fifteen or twenty minutes of this strenuous, lose-and-gain
progress, I reached the little area of vegetation where the Scuppers,
so-called, were located. Here I had a splendid birds-eye view of the road over
which we had come and the swamp and the adjacent woods around the west slope of
the hill. The ascent, I saw, must be very gradual there, and I realized what I
had not realized before, that if our boys were so fortunate as to catch the
enemy between themselves and this cliff there would be something else besides
stones rolling down. Perhaps that was part of the plan of our officers. They
never confided anything to me.

What I was immediately concerned with was the Scuppers themselves. The
little oasis of a few square yards in which I stood consisted of a jumble of
rock with sparse vegetation poking out between, and a miscellaneous collection
of natureâs odds and ends which had struck up a sort of fraternity here like
outcasts in some unmolested haunt. Trees which had broken away from above grew
at crazy angles, their roots having taken precarious hold upon the soil, and
the whole conglomerate mass was held by the two great jagged rocks known as the
Scuppers. These rocks, as I could see now, must have been very deeply imbedded
and the comparatively small portion of them which protruded from the earth
formed a continuous ledge or gutter for some yards, against which all of this
distorted natural furniture rested. Perhaps some sailor had first called them
the Scuppers, and although on close view they bore no resemblance to the
scuppers of a ship, the name was not inappropriate.

In my picnicking and summer rambles I have visited many places with darkly
suggestive namesâHellâs Kitchens, Devilâs Punch-bowls, and the likeâcosy
nooks, as a rule, with nothing more appalling about them than seductive shade
and quiet, but here indeed was a spot after Satanâs own heart. In one place a
great half-exposed root formed a sort of cave, its drooping tentacles hanging
like a bead curtain at the entrance. And the almost horizontal posture of the
tree-trunks and the deformed branches of foliage made dim recesses and
deathlike nooks. Yet the place was picturesque, too, affording a certain
feeling of cosiness and dubious security, perched as it was midway of that
torn, naked ascent.

I had scarcely begun my exploration of this curious island, as it might be
called, when something crunched beneath my foot. It proved to be a glass disk
which I recognized as one of the sort forming the goggles worn by aviators.
Part of the metal frame and some heavy material like khaki were attached to it,
so I concluded that the goggles had formed a part of the cap (as the newspapers
had called it) or, more properly, the mask, used by the fallen airman.

This small find confirmed my own surmise and the lieutenantâs statement that
this lonesome, uncanny place was indeed the scene of Sladeâs tragic death, and,
as I stood there with the fragment in my hand, I thanked Heaven that our boys
were even now on their way to take the village of Pevy where the poor remains
of the dead American lay. I wondered why the Germansâbarbarians that they
wereâhad gone to the trouble and encountered the perils of recovering his
maimed body. There is no question that Germans have little spasms of humanity,
just as the Anglo Saxons may have spasms of cruelty. And that, I thought, must
be the explanation. They did it without thinking!

But what a thing to do. It must have involved risk and no little ingenuity
to get Sladeâs body up that frightful precipice. It puzzled me to know why they
had done it and pretty soon, when I discovered an explanation, it staggered and
amazed me. They had done it becauseââ Oh, I would not let myself think of itâit was incredible....

And I thought of Roy Blakeley, Tomâs friend, who had believed in him,
trusted him, worshipped him. How could I go back and tell Roy what I had
found?

But I am running a little ahead of my narrative. It is hard to set this
matter down in orderly fashion. Even now I feel the cold chill of speechless
horror which came over me, in that little dank cave formed by the tree root as
I sat there almost stupefied ten or fifteen minutes after my second discovery,
of which I must now tell you.

Even now, whenever I smell fresh earth, it takes me back to that dim,
ghastly spot and renews the feeling of unutterable dismay and sickening disgust
which I felt then.

CHAPTER V

Tells of my second discovery and brings me to the point of
startling revelations.

This thing which I had inadvertently stepped on had, I suppose, been a part
of the cap, so-called, which the Germans had dropped behind the allied lines
along with Sladeâs identification disk and the âsmall badge linked with it
which was supposed to signify some honor greatly prized in the ranks of the Boy
Scouts of America.â It did not occur to me as strange that the newspaper had
called it a cap when in point of fact it was one of those goggle masks
sometimes worn by airmen.

The discovery of this broken trifle spurred me to further scrutiny of the
place and I groped about in the gathering dusk but without result. There was no
sign to show where the aviator had fallen and had it not been for the merest
chance I should never have made the discovery which, alas, bore a darker
significance than did the innocent little piece of glass which I had crushed
under foot.

I was just about to continue my climb up the hill when I noticed one of
those great birds which are a common and ghoulish sight in the theatre of war,
circling overhead. These sinister creatures will follow a retreating army for
miles, intent and undiscouraged, and apparently knowing if it is the purpose of
that army to make a stand and fight I have seen them veer away and disappear
when some advantageous ground for fighting has been reached and passed. Near
Blanzy, where no one dreamed that the retreating foe would give battle, a big
flock of them hovered all day waiting for the routed Germans to reach that
place and rally on the high ground. And they did not wait in vain. No military
plans or probabilities escape them.

Well, I was watching this ungainly harbinger of death as it flopped about,
its thin, naked, ugly neck extended in its horrid quest, and wondering if its
presence boded ill for our boys or for the foe, when my gaze was drawn to a
spot among the upper branches of the tree over which the bird was circling.

This tree, the only one to hold its head up in that desert of deformities,
had probably acted as a check and prop for falling material. A mass of tangled
brush had sprung up about it and many rocks found a precarious lodgment among
its half-exposed roots.

What I noticed in this tree appeared in the dusk to be an area of brown
fungus upon the trunk some twenty feet or more from the ground. I probably
would not have thought twice about it had I not noticed a loose end of it
moving slightly with the breeze, which gave the whole thing an appearance of
not belonging there.

Still, I dare say I should have gone my way without further investigation
except that this loose end, fluttering like a beckoning signal in that dismal
spot, haunted me. I started away and turned back again. The great bird had gone
and not a thing was there moving overheadânothing save this little loose,
stirring object, whatever it was, its outline growing dim in the dusk.

Doubtless the mere fact that it moved would have attracted me as I stood in
the deathlike gloom of that chaotic jungle, but even as I watched my
imagination conjured it into a kind of beckoning finger and I experienced a
strange chill, as of apprehension, as it fluttered up there among the
branches.

An impulse came upon me to climb the tree and dispel my vague fancies by a
closer look at this object. It was not without difficulty that I managed to
âshinnyâ up the trunk, but the lower branches once reached, I was able to pass
easily from one to another until I was on a level with the brown object.

I had but to touch it to find that it was no fungus growth at all, but the
remnant of a khaki jacket wound so tightly about the trunk that even on this
closer inspection it seemed a very part of the tree. It must have been wetted
and dried again by much rain and sun, for it was stiff and hard and clung to
the bark when I tried to remove it. The part which blew loose was one of the
sleeves and as I pulled this in my effort to detach the whole, the brittle,
rotted fabric tore and came away like bark. It must have been there for a long
time.

At one place, as I passed my hand over it, I encountered a hubble, very
hard, and upon working the jacket loose I found this to be a watch in the flap
pocket.

You are to suppose that this singular find greatly excited and interested me
and it was in a trembling suspense that I carefully detached and dropped the
thing to the ground.

How came it there? How long had it been there? I think no relic of a human
presence in that cheerless, melancholy spot could have affected me more and
started such a train of thoughts as did this rag which a living person had once
worn. As to who had worn it, there seemed but one answerâit was the jacket of
Tom Slade.

And this supposition I was presently to confirm.

But even before I had reached the ground there appeared to my mindâs eye a
picture of the last scene in the venturesome life of the young airman, here in
this cheerless jungle, and I shuddered as I thought of it, and of the heroic
triumph which preceded his hideous end. I made no doubt that in his frightful
fall the jacket had caught upon some sharp branch of the tree and held him, who
shall say for how long, sufferingâmore likely dead. And when the inert,
mangled form had become extricated and gone down, this tattered remnant had
remained blowing in the wind and rain, marking the spot where he had fallen,
until the beating storms had plastered it against the trunk, save for the
little moving shred which I had seen. And so the khaki jacket, like everything
else which came into that crazy, derelict community, had become a part of it,
seeming, as I have said, like a bit of brown fungus on that lonely
tree....

CHAPTER VI

Tells of the appalling secret which was revealed to me in the Scuppers and
of my decision with regard to it.

I now approach a point in my story where it is difficult for me to write
calmly, yet I wish to unfold this wretched business to you exactly as it
unfolded itself to me. What I learned that night was all I ever knew until I
knew all, and much was to happen before that time. It is not easy, sitting here
now and with the whole amazing story in mind, to reproduce my mental state so
that you may see and feel exactly as I saw and felt then.

Reaching the ground, I took the bundle of stiffened shreds and crawled into
the little cave formed by the tree roots, for it was now nearly dark and I was
cautious enough not to turn my flashlight on in the open.

I think I never experienced such a feeling of suspense as when I hurriedly
rummaged the rotted pockets of this bleached rag which had once been part of
the uniform of the boy from my own home town, in far-off America, Roy
Blakeleyâs friend, the young hero who had begun as a Boy Scout and gone to his
death in a glorious dramatic triumph. And I was thrilled as I repeated his name
to myselfâ
Tom Slade
.

In the sickening, earth-smelling dampness of that little grotto I ransacked
the pockets of the tattered garment, my searchlight laid upon a piece of rotted
wood so that its glare was cast upon my work. The watch I found to be at one
end of a coarse, brass, lock-link chain, at the other end of which was fastened
an oilskin wallet with an ingenious system of folds and interfolds intended to
exclude water and dampness. The chain was long enough so that the watch could
rest in the breast and the wallet in the hip pocket. There was no hip pocket
here, of course, and the wallet I found in the rotted folds of the garment. I
think it must have been plastered fast between the jacket and the tree-trunk.
Probably it had been jerked out of the trousers pocket when the victim fell
from the tree.

Three things about the watch interested but did not surprise me. It had
stopped at twenty minutes after five, presumably the time of Sladeâs fall; it
was of American manufacture, and the initials T. S. were engraved upon the back
of it. Here was confirmation, if I needed any, of the identity of its owner. It
was very much the worse for rain and weather, but these facts were plainly
discernible.

The oilskin wallet was of German manufacture, exactly like one which the
boys had taken from a dead Boche and which I had seen and examined. That wallet
of poor dead Fritzieâs had contained a childishly sentimental letter from
Frankfort. This one, as you shall hear, contained documents of quite a
different character.

The first thing I brought forth was the photograph of a girlâa very pretty
girl indeed, if I am any judge. As I looked at it I had a vague recollection of
having seen the girl somewhereâat a patriotic gathering in Bridgeboro, I
thought, or perhaps it was just on Main Street, or in the library or the
post-office. Anyway, she was no French girl and I could have vowed that I had
seen her in Bridgeboro. So here, at least, was a pretty touch in the harrowing
catastrophe. Tom had had a girlâas every soldier should have.

You will not be impatient if I run over the contents of this wallet with
some particularity. The next thing was half of a half sheet of note paper, torn
from a letter presumably, and with an irrelevant memorandum written on the
other side The letter was from our young lady, I felt sure, and I thought it
rather an ungallant treatment of her missive. The few sentences on this
fragment ran thus. I copy them from the scrap itself.

looked about it seemed as if everyone in Bridgeboro was there. And of course
the Boy Scouts and that excruciating imp of a Blakeley boy were on handâRuthâs
brother, you know. Oh, by the way, who do you suppose is in the old place on
Terrace Avenue? Guess. The Red Cross ladies and Iâm working with

That was all, but it took me back home to Bridgeboro with a rush! And here,
thought I, with half the world between us, here in this ghostly, forlorn scene
of tragedy, am I reading of that âexcruciating impââRoy Blakeley! Of course the
Red Cross ladies were plying their needles in a vacant store on Terrace
AvenueâI knew that well enough. But what was the grand affair at which the
whole of Bridgeboro seemed to be present?

Poor Roy, poor Tom, poor girl, all to be stricken in one way or another
because some bloody tyrant thought he owned the earth.

But I found companionship and solace in those few broken sentences and it
was with wistful thoughts of home that I turned the scrap over and read in
another hand:

See Capt. Pfeifer about list and supplies from Berry-au-Bac.

Captain Pfeiffer! Here was a good old German name for a loyal American
captainâPfeiffer! The least he could have done would have been to change it to
Fifer. Well, he could kill the Germans with any name, butââ

I scrutinized the memorandum a little more intently.
List
and supplies from Berry-au-Bac.
Hmph! Why, Berry-au-Bac was fifteen or
twenty miles within the German lines. At the time of Tomâs last service it must
have been double that. What had Tom Slade to do with lists and supplies from
Berry-au-Bac?

Why, of course, he had descended upon Berry-au-Bac and captured lists
andâ No, it was absurd.

Puzzled, I turned the scrap of paper over and found some reassurance in
those cordial, friendly words written in the girlâs hand. No, sir, we do not
turn out spies or traitors in Bridgeboro. How should
I

know what that memorandum meant? But if my name were Pfeiffer, Iâd change it to
Fifer or Fife, I knew that much. Tom Slade knew his business, I was sure of
that.

So thinking, I unfolded the next paper and found that he knew his business
only too well. Here was a rough map showing every last hospital and dressing
station beyond the American lines in that sector.

Two were crossed offâblown up, I suppose. There were some twenty or more
still to be blown up. Underneath were written these words, as nearly as I can
remember them:

Report dressing station foot of Fav Hill joined to one on topâemptyâdonât
bother. Ask about supplies from Wangardt. Correct list sent to Cap. Dennheimer
so I donât get blame. Tell him G station on other list is full.

And so on, and so onâI could not read any more. The name of that unspeakable
wretch, Dennheimer, was quite enough. His deeds of bestial inhumanity were such
as to call down the vengeance of Heaven and damn him for all eternity. I knew
that he had his minions peering out under their big gas bags and skulking about
like the unclean bird I had been watching, putting the doom of certain death on
those already wounded. I knew that, like that sinister, cowardly bird, he made
it his special function to defile the blue sky, sending his sneaking minions of
the air forth upon their barbarous errands. They did not fight, the gallant
fliers of this command, they skulked and murdered and fled.

And here in my hands, incredible as it seemed, was the last damning memorial
of one of them.

And an American!

With an uncertain hand and a kind of limp disgust, I drew the papers forth
and scanned them one after another. I felt sick, sick with a kind of nausea of
bewilderment and utter despair. For if this were true (and how could it be
otherwise?), then I had no more faith in human nature.

Yes, I hadâI had faith in the faith which I knew lived back in Bridgeboro,
and I think I drew a little hope, perhaps still a little confidence, from the
stout heart which would not even believe that thisâthis aviatorâwas dead.
Excruciating imp! Hero, I called him, and I resolved that he should never hear
this from me. He believed that the worst had not happened, loyal, stouthearted
friend and champion and comrade that he was. But death is not the worst.

I need not trouble you with the sordid contents of those other papers; nor
have I them at hand to copy. They were the familiar baggage of a traitor and a
spy, with all the nice details of sneaking ingenuity and signs of moral
turpitude, such as to arouse the wrath of a saint. It will be enough to tell
you that if this creature had lived, the hospital at Dormans would probably
have seen its agonized victims writhing in flames. And one of our little
cemeteries, with its rows of wooden crosses, was to have been torn with jagged
holesâI do not know why. There was a detailed report for Dennheimer which would
have pleased him had he received it. And Captain Pfeiffer would not have been
disappointed.

I sat there, holding the watch in one hand, the wallet in the other, jerking
the coarse chain as If I would break it asunder, and separate the American
timepiece bearing the initials of an American boy from this other souvenir of
cowardice and treachery. Then I looked again at the picture of the girl with
the clear, honest eyes, and then at her friendly words about Bridgeboro. And he
had torn a piece from that letter to make a treacherous memorandum. The
wretch!

So I sat in the darkness and pondered, noticing a spider which hurried back
and forth in the small glare of my light, and other irrelevant trifles, as one
will do under the stress of shock and sorrow. My head throbbed and I felt a
strange disinclination to move.

Could this thing be? Why, he had vowed to be revenged upon those wretches!
Had the whole business, first and last, been a treacherous ruse? Had he gained
admission to the hospital simply to spy there? Was the newspaper account all
wrong and he, the sneak and traitor, been but the hero of some misinformed
newspaper correspondent? Everything is green when you look through green
spectacles and the only thing I could be certain of now was the unmistakable
meaning of these papers and the identity of their possessor. Everything else
seemed readily susceptible of a dark and sinister construction.

As I groped in my mind for some saving fact or discrepancy which might
explain, or at least raise a doubt, the thought of one final clinching
circumstance forced itself upon me and I gave up in hopeless despair. I knew
now why the Germans had come here and taken away Sladeâs body. It was not his
body they were after, but his papers and for these they had searched in vain.
The decent burial of his poor remains in some less cheerless spot than here,
and the dropping of his American identification disk and scout badge (which
apparently he had continued to wear) were perhaps the kindly act of Fritz in
one of his erratic, sentimental moodsâa fraternal and charitable
afterthought.

And this was the secret of the Scuppersâdark and sordid and depressing, like
all else there; and so, I was resolved, it should remainâan invisible part of
that gloomy derelict community, like the very atmosphere of that grim,
cheerless spot to which fate or a merciful Providence had relegated it.

PART TWOâREMINISCENCES OF SLADEâS CAREER

FOREWORD

It is a fact that the career of Slade from the time he became an airman and
even before was one of bravery and patriotism, and his disaffection,
apparently, had come only at the very end of his service. Even then, as it
seemed, he had not gone over to the enemy, but had accepted and carried out
commissions from them while maintaining an appearance of loyalty. And I
marvelled at the prowess and resource which he must have shown in this
hazardous business. No one in all that sector, where he had come and gone as
freely as the birds of the air, had suspected him; none spoke of him except in
praise.

Perhaps the newspaper account which had thrilled us so at home was somewhat
in the nature of a âwrite-up,â and there were, indeed, several versions current
as to just how Slade had met his death. Most of these fell a little short in
the ingredient of reckless valor, but there was no question that he had been
counted a very daring airman, and I could multiply instances of praise and
expressions of trust and confidence from his comrades and superiors.

I supposed at the time that money had tempted this brave young fellow to his
moral fall. About all I had ever known of him was that he had been of a simple
mind and very poor. This much I had learned from Roy.

Before I left the Scuppers that night I had a mental tussle over the
question of what I should do with these incriminating papers. If Slade had been
living I should have turned them over to the authorities, but as it was I could
not see that anything was to be gained by their preservation. They pertained to
conditions which no longer existed, they revealed no facts that were of value
now, and I decided to destroy them then and thereâall except the picture of
the girl and the scrap of her letter containing the familiar references to
Bridgeboro, for I could not bring myself to cast those into the flames. Her
friendly, companionable words, though they were not addressed to me, comforted
me, nevertheless, and conjured up thoughts of home. The brief memorandum on the
back I obliterated with my pen. With the other papers I made a little fire in
my cave, believing that I could the better fulfill my promise to Roy if I put,
or tried to put, this horrible sequel of a brave career out of my mind
altogether.

I shall ask you to do the same while I try to give you a sketch of Sladeâs
remarkable deeds up to the time he became a patient ârecovering from a slight
wound,â in the Epernay Hospital. This tale of his career is necessarily
disjointed and fragmentary, and was intended only for the perusal of Roy. I
began it in the form of letters to him while I was myself a patient in that
same hospital. These letters were never sent because I feared the censor, who
had been dealing rather freely with my newspaper stuff, and I soon fell into
the habit of stringing out a more orderly narrative.

You will understand, of course, that my chief interest in all these matters
was for Roy Blakeley.
He
was
my

hero.

As to who will prove the hero of this whole extraordinary business, that
shall be for you to say.

LETTERS TO ROY BLAKELEY

Dear Roy:

I am writing this letter propped up in bed in the little hospital at Epernay
and a young chatterbox of a fellow in the cot adjoining mine says that my
breathing reminds him of a goldfish. I cannot seem to breathe with my mouth
shut, but I tell him that
he
canât keep his mouth shut
either and that he has not my good excuseâfor I was gassed.

The nurses and patients call him Archie, and he has a bullet which was
lately extracted from his shoulder and which he says he intends to take home to
America for a souvenir. He is wounded slightly otherwise and was operated upon
(had his
retreat
cut off, he told me) and is in all
ways a most diverting youngster, something like yourself, except that he
rolls his Râs like rapid-fire artillery. He calls the nurses âcross redâ
nurses, and talks incessantly.

I became acquainted with him only yesterday and I fancy he will beguile my
convalescence. Seeing him lying with his eyes fixed on the rafters, I ventured
to say, âA penny for your thoughts.â

âWhat dâyou think I amâa slot machine?â he retorted.

âExcuse me,â I said, somewhat taken aback.

âPerrfectly excusable,â he responded cheerily, and added, âDo you see that
place where the rafterrs arre newâwith the big irron nails?â

âI see the nails,â said I.

âYou canât drive a nail with a sponge,â he said, âno matter how you soak
it.â

âPerfectly true,â I said, essaying a little pleasantry of my own, âbut what
has that got to do with the price of onions?â

He drew his knees up in the bed in a way he has of lying. âThat place is
wherre a Gerrman bomb came through,â he said. âI got one of those nails forr a
souveneerr.â

I looked at the spot with more interest. âIt killed two of the nurses,
didnât it?â I asked. âI heard about that. But surely, you couldnât have been
here then.â

âNo, but my pill wasâI mean my palâfellerr by the name of Slade; he
sworreâââ

That was as far as he got, for one of the nurses, stepping right in range of
his torrential volley of Râs, began her ministrations, incidentally telling him
for the hundredth time to be quiet so that other patients might sleep.

You may suppose that I was greatly interested in what he was telling me and
the good old upstate rumble of that word
sworre

lingered in my mind, for I had no doubt that he was referring to your friend
Tom Slade, and that a lucky chance (or an unlucky one) had brought me to the
very hospital mentioned in the newspaper account which you and I read together.
Whether Slade was really his âpillâ or pal, I cannot say, for he spoke of
everyone as his pal, from General Foch down, but I hope to talk more with him
tomorrow. He has just fallen asleep with the parting injunction to âwake me
earrly, motherr, dearrrr.â And silence reigns supreme.

This is all I am allowed to write today, but tomorrow Iâll ârecount the
adventure,â as you would say, which brought me here.

Dear Roy:

My new acquaintance is out on our little veranda for a sun bath. His name,
they tell me, is ArcherâArchibald Archerâand that he has lately been in the
Motorcycle Corps. I wonder if any motorcycle can make more noise than he!

I came here after taking the village of Pevyâthough I did not take it all
by myself. The village sits on high ground a couple of miles beyond one of the
steepest, rockiest hillsides I ever sawâa place where you can measure real
estate with a plumb line. Our boys took the road which verged around and up the
west slope of the hill, as the retreating Germans had done, while I took the
short-cut, or rather climb, up this precipitous place.

It was thereabouts that Tom Slade fell, a fact that seems to admit of little
doubt, and you must not continue to indulge in any day-dreams as to his being
still alive. I am sure we are both more interested in some of the things he did
while living than in the immediate circumstances of his death, and in this
connection I intend to question my new acquaintance as soon as I get the
chance.

Well, I had a difficult time of it scrambling up that rocky hill and it was
pitch dark when I reached the top. I have made a rough pencil sketch of the
locality which you may be interested in.

I fell in with our detachment about a mile out of Pevy and had a few hoursâ
rest until dawn, when we made our advance against the village. All this has
nothing to do with Tom Slade so I wonât burden you with an account of how the
retreating Germans made a stand before the town. But when we marched in, there
was nothing to be found but burned homesteads and gas-poisoned atmosphere. It
was not impossible to breathe in the open, but in the wrecked and charred
buildings the deadly fumes lingered and I should have had sense enough to keep
out of them. One of them, a makeshift hospital, had not been destroyed and I
foolishly entered it.

For a few seconds I beheld a scene which struck horror to my very heart.
They say over here that every American soldier fights with a wrath and
desperation born of some particular discovery or experience of Hun brutality.
One goes forth with the thought of a maimed and tortured comrade to give him
strength; another with the memory of some violated truce or false and murderous
cry of âkamerad!â Well, here was the sight to arouse in me the hatred of those
beasts which I had not sufficiently felt before.

They had left their own people,
their own sick and wounded
, to suffer
the agonizing death of those deadly gas fumes. If there are any degrees in
loathesomeness, it seemed to me that this was more unspeakable than was the
bombing of an enemy hospital.

I cannot describe what I saw, nor did I see it long. I remember groping
toward a bed, on which lay the body of an old man, all the while trying, like
the clumsy fool I was, to adjust my gas mask. I remember how my eyes pained and
the horrible taste in my mouth, and how my fingers seemed to be asleep. I
thought I saw one of those ghastly yellow patients sit up and fall back again.
The next I knew I was here in this hospital in this spotless cot, and one of
the first things I was really conscious of was this youngster next me, talking.
I am given to understand that I had a pretty narrow squeak of it, and that I
will cease breathing like a goldfish in time.

I am going to stop writing now in order to talk to my young neighbor, Archer
(or âSouvenirâ as they call him). They are just bringing him in in a wheel
chair and heâs eating an apple. Never have I known of anyone who could eat so
many applesâhe lives on them.

LETTER RECEIVED FROM ROY

Note:
As my acquaintance
with young Archer was to prove both diverting and profitable, I have boiled our
conversations down into a sort of narrative in which he will appear as
something of a character, and the chapters which follow were intended to be the
story of
Tom Slade with the Flying Corps
, which I
should present to Roy on my return to America.

Before submitting this story to you, however, I wish to include here a
letter which I received from Roy at about this time. It was sent to me at the
hospital by the Associated Press after it had wandered like a lost soul up and
down the shifting West Front. And it came to me like a cool breeze in
summer.

I did not then attach any particular significance to its contents. Indeed, I
am not sure now that it is important in this place. But it interested me
greatly, and you will be glad to read it because of Royâs epoch-making
announcement (at which the public had better sit up and take notice) that he is
himself soon to be launched on the literary sea!

Dear Friend:

You remember you said youâd like me to write you a letter when I got cheered
up, and tell you all the news. Most of it is about our Scout troop. Last night
we had a meeting and they gave me a present of a big picture of Tom that they
had enlarged from the photograph. Itâs great! It was in a frame and has some
words underneathââloyal, staunch and trueââquoted out of some book or other.
Maybe by this time you have found out some things about him.

Pee-wee Harris said we should send you an anonymous letterâhe meant
unanimous letter. Honest, that kid is a scream. Heâs Doc Harrisâ son, you know.
Jeb Rushmore, our camp manager up in Temple Camp, sent us an owl to have
stuffed and Mr. Ellsworth told Pee-wee it would have to be sent to a
taxidermist. Pee-wee asked me what that was and just for a kid I told him it
was a man that drives a taxi. So he went down to the station with the owl and
asked one of the taxi men to stuff it. I should worry!

After the meeting we had a debate and I chose the subject. It was to decide
who was the greatest, St. Patrick or the Fourth of July. It was decided in the
affirmative. Crinkums, that was some meeting!

Maybe youâll be interested to hear that Iâm elected Troop Historian, and
Iâve got to write up all our adventures. Some job, believe me! I should worry.
Mr. Ellsworth says maybe heâll get it published. He says you get good money for
writing a bookâbut not much of it! He says if I write just like I talk, itâll
be all right. Iâve decided to write it scout pace, kind of running, then
walkingâyou know. Itâll be like a hike. Doc Carson, our first-aid scout, says
it ought to be funny, and I promised Iâd chuck some chuckles into it. Pee-wee
is going to make the names for the chapters. Good-night! Maybe youâll be
willing to help me when you get back, especially with sunsets and green hills
and weather and like that, because you have to have all those things in a book,
especially weather. I said I wouldnât bother with any weather, but Doc Carson
said all the characters would suffocate. Pee-wee said heâs no use for weather
in stories and he always skips it, anyway. Maybe Iâll have compressed air
instead. Weather and prefacesâgood-night!

Thereâs some news I guess youâll be interested in. They caught Adolph
Schmitt, who used to keep that grocery storeâyou remember? You know they found
out he was a spy and he skipped. Now theyâve got him and heâs down in Atlanta
Penitentiary. A long time ago Tom used to deliver groceries for him.

Well, Iâll say goodbye and if you can find out any things about Tom, you
bet Iâll be glad.

Your friend,

Roy Blakeley.

I have included this letter from Roy partly because it contained the
earliest portentous hints of those sprightly narratives which were later to
create such a stir in Boy Scout circles, but more particularly because of its
reference to the Schmitt affair.

I remembered the case of Schmitt very well, for it was a nine daysâ wonder
in Bridgeboro when this jolly, fat German grocer disappeared just in time to
escape a visit from the Secret Service men. I never knew just what he was
suspected of but I understood that incriminating papers, of a very treasonable
purport, were found in the rooms over his store which he and his whole brood
had so suddenly vacated.

The news that Tom Slade had worked for this man interested me, of course,
and fitted pretty well with the secret knowledge which I had. Had Schmittâs
Grocery been the kindergarten where the poor, ignorant boy had learned the
first contaminating lesson of disloyalty? Well, here I was with my green
spectacles on again, and everything looked green. In any event, I was glad to
know that Schmitt had been caught and lodged in Uncle Samâs Penitentiary, where
he belonged. Perhaps, I thought, the worst thing that he did was to insinuate
his false reasoning into the simple mind of his employee and corrupt the clear,
honest viewpoint of a young boy....

Narrative written for Roy Blakeley in the Epernay
Hospital, and intended originally to form a complete story under the title of

Tom Slade with the Flying Corps
.

CHAPTER IâCOMRADES

The following story of a remarkable career was told me mostly by my young
friend, Archibald Archer, who was for a time an occupant of the adjoining cot
to mine in the Epemay Hospital. I shall take the liberty of enlisting him as a
sort of joint narrator with myself, in the sense of using his own language when
that seems desirable. Much that he told me, I jotted down in shorthand without
his knowledge. He was recovering from slight injuries received while serving
with âextinctionâ (I suppose he meant distinction) in the Motorcycle Corps. He
lived on a farm in New York State, rolled his Râs, ate apples by the peck when
he could get them, and collected souvenirs by the ton. On the whole, I liked
him and I am sure that when he was not in the mood of banter he was honest and
sincere.

He and Tom Slade had crossed the ocean together as shipâs boys, and Archer
had remained in France resolved to win glory under âGenerral Perrshing.â He
became an assistant cook in the Lorraine sector where his most dramatic exploit
in the cause of humanity was the placing of a bowl of soup on a listening post
in No Manâs Land, in such a way that in the still hours of the night it tumbled
its contents upon the proud head of a sumptuously attired German lieutenant who
had leaned against the post.

He did not receive the Distinguished Service Cross for this deed of heroism,
but no doubt it was appreciated, for he shortly became orderly to some officers
and has the lace of an officerâs puttee to prove it.

How he drifted back into sea service again, I do not recall. In any event,
he did and worked again as a shipâs boy, I suppose. Perhaps he was going home
on leave. In any case, he was sitting on the âforrwarrd hatch,â eating an
apple, and was just about to throw the core at a purserâs assistant when a
torpedo struck the ship. It is one of the vain regrets of his life that he did
not throw the core a moment sooner.

A few more days found him in a German prison camp where he soon became the
chief entertainer of that hapless community. Not only did he hobnob with âOld
Piff,â the German commandant, but his genius as a chef won him immediate
recognition and prestige. Here it was that he enlivened the tedium of the
prisoners by handing a bottle of ink to a German guard, who had demanded some
insect dope, to rub on his face one sultry night, and the âguarrrdâsâ face,
according to Archer, presented a diverting sight next morning. He still has the
cork of this ink bottle as a treasured memento or âsouveneerrr.â

In the camp, to his great astonishment, he fell in with Tom Slade, who had
also been gathered in with the survivors of a torpedoed transport, and the two,
being kindred spirits and old friends (âcomrades to the death,â Archer said),
had contrived to escape together and make their way through Switzerland into
France.

âSlady used to be a Boy Scout,â Archer told me, âand he knew all about
trackinâ and trailinâ, and a plaguey lot of otherr things besides. Only heâd
never let you know he knew âem. He knew about signalling and âlectricity, and
aerroplane enginesâhe had that old storrage warrehouse of a head of his filled
up with all kinds of junk.â

âWhat did he look like when you knew him then?â I asked.

âOh, he looked like he was madâalways sorrt oâ scowling. But he was trrue as
the marrinerrâs compassâIâll say that forr him.â

âAnd thatâs saying a great deal,â said I. And this reminded me (I canât say
just why) to ask if Slade had been interested in any girl back in America.

âGurrrl? Him?â Archer said. âHe had no use forr gurrls, and nutherr have I.
Iâd rutherr have an apple any day. Gurrls make me sick.â

âIndeed,â I said. âI should think the apples you eat would make you
sick.â

âSlady told me when we werre cominâ through the Black Forest that he neverr
got no letterrs from gurrls. He said most soldierrs do, but he didnât.â

I was a little puzzled at this becauseâwell, just because I was. I think you
will agree, Roy, that soldiers should receive letters from girls. I was under
the impressionâbut no matter.

When Slade and Archer reached the American front in Alsace they joined the
Motorcycle Corps, becoming messengers behind the lines. In their long journey
through the Black Forest and Switzerland they had resolved on entering this
branch of the service, but their paths soon diverged, Archerâs sphere of duty
being in the neighborhood of Paris, while Tom rushed back and forth on his
machine in the Toul sector until he was sent far west into Picardy and Flanders
on some specially dangerous service. As long as Tom was attached to the command
in Toul sector he and Archer met occasionally at Troyes and Chaumont where
their longer errands sometimes took them. Then there came a time when Archer
saw his former comrade no more, and he later heard of Tomâs being sent west
where the streams were running red and the paths of the cyclist messenger were
being torn with jagged shell holes.

âI thought maybe Slady had run his machine pell-mell into one of those
places,â said Archer, âuntilâââ

âWell, donât try to tell me now,â I said. âLie down and get some sleep.
Weâve all tomorrow before us.â

CHAPTER IIâTOM APPEARS ON THE SCENE

Out of the clouds he came, sweeping, veering, dodging, scattering the
ghoulish night birds in his flight, the whir of his propeller heard amid the
havoc of wind and storm as he raced with the elements, his soaring wings
outlined with a kind of ghostly clearness in the fitful gleams of
lightning.

Often, as I have lain here in the long monotony of convalescence, I have
thought how he first emerged out of the clouds in wind and rain, a hurrying
spectre glimpsed in sudden flashes, and of how in the end he disappeared again
amid the lashing tempest, up, up, up, into the shadow of the clouds whence he
had comeânever to be seen alive by mortal man again.

Surely, it is not hard to fancy him a kind of spirit of the sky, visiting
this war-scourged land of France, and withdrawing to his kindred elements when
his tragic work was done.

It seems fitting that this creature of fate should have come and gone in
this way; that there should have been no prosy beginning or end to his career.
And I am glad, Roy, for your sake, and for mine and for his andâyes, for the
sake of his sturdy champion, Archerâthat only a few of his earlier and more
conspicuous exploits are known and remembered.

I have it from Archer that the night of this first strange thing which I am
about to tell was of intense darkness and incessant, wind-blown rain.
Occasionally, he said, quick, sharp flashes of lightning illumined the sky and
at such times he could see the clouds, as he said, âchurrned up like clabberred
milk.â

It was the terminating storm of a long season of rain which had wrought
havoc to the roads and railroad linesâalready in sorry plight from overuse and
German artillery fire. Great dependence, it seemed, was placed upon those
sturdy youngsters of the Motorcycle Corps, particularly just then, when the
wires were down, their supporting poles sprawling in mud or flood.

Archer told me that on that night they could plainly see from Nancy, where
he was stationed, the little church in Chateau Seulans across the Lorraine
border, and could distinguish pigmy figures of German sentries there, so vivid
was the lightning at times.

He says that he had not seen Slade for nearly a year, though I hardly think
it could have been as long as that. In any case, he had been stationed at Nancy
for a month or two and his duties in the quiet sector (Sleepy Hollow, they
called it) were hardly more exciting than those of an American letter-carrier.
It rained almost unceasingly, the soldiers drilled and played cards, and baled
out their trenches, which were ârunning rriverrs,â to quote my young friend.
Sometimes Fritzie made a night raid and the boys in khaki made a party call for
good manners. But there wasnât much going on.

âWhat would you do if you had a
real
jobâsomething
urrgent?â Archer says one of the boys asked him.

âIâd take carre of it, all right,â he answered.

âYouâd need a boat to get from here to Chaumont now,â the other fellow
said. âDid you look into Mess Dugout 4? Itâs nothing but a mudhole.â

âWherre Iâm sent, Iâll go,â said Archer. âI donât carre if itâs to
Berrlin.â

âWould you make a try for Paris if you had a message for General
Pershing?â his companion teased.

âNo, Iâd send worrd to General Perrshing to come herre and get it,â Archer
retorted; which apparently ended the talk.

At last something happened. In the latter part of the afternoon they got a
signal from the squint bag
[1]
and hauled the thing down, the rain pattering
upon its taut bulk and streaming off like a waterfall. The occupant of its cosy
little car announced that the Germans seemed to be massing all the way from
Frouard to the Marne Canal, and that barges were moving westward along the
Canal from La Garde. The observer thought they might be bringing troops from
the railroad town of Berthelingen, or from Azoudange, where the prison camp
was. It had long been necessary for the Germans to rob Peter to pay Paul and if
they were depleting their guard at the great camp it probably meant that some
big enterprise was in the air. A flier was promptly sent up to reconnoiter
eastward, but the weather was too much for him and he came down like a drowned
bat.

By dusk, the wind was blowing a gale out of the southwest, driving the rain
in sheets so that the squint bag which had ascended again pulled and strained
at its anchorage, dragging sideways and jerking for all the world like some
monstrous fish on the line. They soon hauled it down for fear of the cable
snapping. A drenched courier arrived from Colombey, below Toul, with the news
that every wire in that section was down and in a hopeless tangle and the rails
west of Neufchateau were sunken in swamp. When you hear mention of railroads
in France you must put out of your thoughts altogether the Pennsylvania and the
New York Centralâeven the Erie, I am tempted to say; for these roads here are
mere toy lines with ridiculous puffing slow-poke engines and tracks which
disappear on the smallest provocation.

A little before dark, Archer tells me, he was summoned before his superiors
and asked if he believed he could get as far as Brienne, or perhaps Troyes,
with a message. It was hoped that communication might be open between one or
other of those places and Paris, where the commander was at the time. He
answered that he believed he could reach Brienne and was despatched at once
with messages for transmission, of which, of course, he did not know the
contents more than that they pertained to the enemyâs movements and were urgent
in the extreme.

West of Vaucouleurs he found the roads all but impassible. The wind was
blowing a tempest, driving the rain into his face so that he was reduced to
picking his way at a snailâs pace. The darkness was intense, save for the
occasional gleams of forked lightning which illumined the sky and gilded the
clouds with a frightful, portentous brightness.

âIt was the kind of weatherr,â says Archer, with characteristic humor, âwhen
folks always say, âPity the poorr sailorrs on a night like this.ââ

He had passed through Gondrescourt inquiring whether communication was open
with points west when he heard the sharp report of an aircraft gun, apparently
from somewhere in the town, and looked up just as a flash of lightning lit the
sky.

His own simple description of what he saw impressed me very much indeed.
âThe clouds were small and all feathery like, as if they had been pulled
aparrt,â he said; âthe edges all ragged and very bright, like silverr. It made
you feel scarey as if the darrk parrt behind âem didnât belong to this worrld
at all.â

Well, it was just in that quick flash that he saw moving across one of those
illumined patches an airplane, its outline as clear as a silhouette.

âForr a minute,â said Archer, with a graphic power which surprised me, âit
seemed as if it was one of those witches sailing through the sky, and it made
me feel creepy, as you might say.â

Then, all in a moment, the darkness closed about it, but, listening, he
could hear, in the brief intervals of the tumult, the noise of its propeller,
and the sound struck terror to his heart, for he knew by the intermittent whir
that it was a Hun machine. Archer tells me that this characteristic of the Hun
planes makes them always recognizable at night. âTheirr hearrt beats
different,â as he said.

They must have been a watchful gun crew in the town to spy this vulture of
the night, but their shot had done no damage evidently, for the grim thing
moved along, visible now and again over the cyclistâs head. When the
impediments of marsh and washed-out roads caused him to slacken his speed, the
flier did so also, maneuvering apparently, now visible in the quick flashes,
now only heard amid the rain and wind.

At Aubinal they had a searchlight as well as an aircraft gun and, hearing
the flier, they threw a long column about the sky and fixed him in a circle of
light. Then the sharp report of the gun and the machine dipped, for all the
world like a boy dodging a pursuer. Twice, thrice, the report rang out, the
cyclist pausing among the little group of excited villagers. Twice, thrice, the
machine dipped, while the watchers held their breath in suspense. But the plane
resumed its course, still visible in bold relief in the circle of light.

Then suddenly there appeared in the sky another plane (presumably, from
somewhere in the neighborhood) rising in pursuit of the enemy craft. So furious
was the lashing of the storm that Archer was thrilled with admiration at the
sight of one of his friends braving the perils of that tempestuous night to
bring down an enemy flier, and as he rode on out of the little town, fighting
his own way in the blinding storm, he wondered who the bold pursuer could
beâwhether French or American.

High amid the tumult he could hear shots, which were presently drowned in
the turbulence of the storm, and he had no further glimpse of either craft.

âI thought our flierr had hit him and sent him down,â said Archer, âand I
says to myself, âThat fellerr is a hero, all right,â and I hoped he was an
Amerrican. I wonderred what the Hun plane was doing so far behind ourr lines on
a night like that, but I didnât have time to wonderr much. Anyways, I was glad
it was overr âcause it made me feel kind of spooky to see that black thing like
a ghost or a witch or something following me. I made up my mind Iâd ask about
who brought it down, soâs Iâd know who it was.â

His way now took him through the flat country east of Brienne where he hoped
that his spooky, drenching journey might end.

The land here was turned into a quagmire, his machine splashing through mud
and water so that he must pause now and again to wrench and haul it out of some
mushy hollow.

The country thereabouts was quite unpopulated, consisting of vast flat
meadows, entirely submerged. The blighting Hun line had once embraced the
locality, and its refugees had not yet returned to a security so precarious. So
there was not even the dim lamplight from a peasantâs cottage to cheer the
hapless messenger.

I have not put young Archer forward as a hero, and I shall not, for I know
in whom you are mainly interested, but I think the courage he showed that night
was remarkable. The road, as I understood him, crossed a veritable inland sea
on an embankment about a foot submerged and had he verged from the invisible
causeway he and his machine would have been plunged into a considerable depth
of water. He was guided by his instinct and such of the fallen poles as had not
been washed away.

But it was all quite hopeless, as he realized before he was a quarter of the
way across the flooded area. His wheels, sunk in mud, were all but
inextricable, and he finally realized, or acknowledged, the terrible
predicament he was in. There he was, the plaything of a lashing tempest,
marooned upon a sunken road, wrenching and tugging at his wheel as it settled
lower and lower in the mud. Above him the thunder crashed, now and again the
lightning rent the sky showing the heavens thick with those little restless,
feathery clouds. His face felt hot and sore from the beating of the rain
against it. I suspect that his nerve was wavering and little wonder.

Then he heard amid the uproar the whirring of an airplane and he stood stark
still listening. Perhaps his distracted mind made him susceptible to vague
imaginings, and he experienced a feeling of horror at the thought of this
uncanny creature of the night hovering in the clouds above him, until he
realized that it was probably the friendly plane which, having brought down the
enemy machine, was on its way with messages to Paris. The thought afforded him
a measure of relief and reconciled him to his own desperate plight. What
matter, so long as the urgent news were carried? And what an airman he must be
who could fly through this inferno, braving thunder, lightning and
storm....

I must tell you this in Archerâs own words.

âI was tugging at my machine, trying to haul it out of the mud, but everry
jerrk I gave it I went deeperr in the mud myself. I rememberr how I wrenched on
the front wheel, this way and that, so my headlight pointed every which way and
I could see the waterr all aroundâas much as half a mile on both sides of me, I
should think. Be-forre that I didnât know how much of the country was flooded.
I seemed to be in the middle of the ocean, as you might say, only in places
there were little islands, like, where the water didnât quite cover the fields.
I knew I couldnât get my machine out of the mud and I thought Iâd be betterr
off if I left it and waded over to one of those islands because the road I was
on was underr waterr and was washing away, sorrt of.

âSo I turrned my handle-barr soâs to throw the searrchlight around overr
that flooded space and try to decide which way to go. I thought maybe I could
get across it quickerr that way; and then run to the nearest town. All of a
sudden, while I was throwing my light like that, I hearrd the buzz of an
airrplane verry nearr and a very loud whistlinâ sound like this (he simulated a
loud, shrill whistling) and then I hearrd a splash quite a long way off and
then more splashing not so loud.

âI turrned my light in that direction and saw a big airrplane cominâ to a
standstill in the waterr and the rain was pourinâ down off its planes just
like a waterrfall. I thought it must be the flierr that brought down the Hun
machine, and I thought he must be wrecked and was dead, maybe.

âForr a minute I held my handle-barr soâs the light was right on the plane
and then I had a good scarre, you can bet, forr I could see plain as day on the
body of it and on the rudderr the black cross with a white borrderr like they
have on Hun machines!â

The dramatic descent of this apparition through that tempestuous storm, and
its clear outline as it stood focussed in the circle of brightness thrown by
Archerâs headlight, must have been quite enough to disconcert him. For a
moment, he says, he stood there trembling, the wind howling about him, the rain
beating on his face, the heavy darkness shutting out everything save that
meteor-like thing out of the troubled heavens.

Then a figure emerged from under its dripping plane and called to him. In
the high wind he could not hear what this apparition said, the voice seeming
thin and spent in contrast with the tumult, or, as Archer said, âas if it came
from a ghost.â Then he caught the words âlandingâ and âguide.â

He was not greatly surprised at that, for it was not uncommon to find
Germans speaking English. For a moment he hesitated, then, drawing his side
arm, he stepped forward through the water, toward the strange visitor. Again
the man spoke, but the wind was away from him and Archer could not hear what he
said. He confessed that he was not accustomed to encounters with the enemy, but
he knew what to do and called, âHold up your hands if you surrenderr; if you
donât, Iâll shootâ; all the while wading through the flooded meadow.

âHOLD UP YOUR HANDS; IF YOU DONâT, IâLL SHOOT.â

The stranger, so he says, raised his hands very leisurely and lifted his
goggles up on his forehead, for all the world like some dear old grandma, which
tickled Archerâs funny bone. This finicky little act seemed odd in one of those
adventurous denizens of the sky, and I have heard others besides Archer speak
of it. Then the stranger, standing there amid the screaming wind and blinding
storm, raised his hands as if to surrender. But Archer was not unfamiliar with
the âkamaradâ game, and he advanced cautiously. The screaming of the wind
through the wiring of the machine was terrific but through it, as he stumbled
along, he fancied (I quote his own words) that he could âhearr the worrd
âsouveneerrrâ as if it was in the airrr, sorrt of.â

Then suddenly he stopped amazed to hear these words uttered in plain
English:

âI suppose youâre after a piece of this airplane for a souvenir. How is it
you ainât chewinâ an apple?â

He stood where he was, too dumbfounded to speak, and looked at the drenched
figure in dismay.

âCan I take my hands down now?â the flier said in a familiar, dull voice,
but smiling.

As you probably have guessed, it was none other than Archerâs former
comrade, Tom Slade, who stood facing him.

ââTill I hearrd that about souveneerrrs I neverr thought anything about
it,â Archer said, as a sort of climax to this extraordinary episode, and
raising his knees high up in the bed as was his custom; âbut as soon as he
reminded me of it I made up my mind Iâd get a piece of that bloominâ machine to
take homeâby Christopherrr!â

That seemed to be the main consideration with him.

âDo you think you are fonder of souvenirs than of apples?â I inquired slyly,
for his narrative was interrupted by the nurseâs bringing him one from a box of
them which I understood had made a long and patriotic pilgrimage from the
Catskills.

âTherreâs only one thing about apples I like,â he observed, as he took an
enormous bite, âand thatâs the taste of âem. Slady used to always kid me about
applesâbut you can bet yourr life I got three tacks out of the leatherr seat of
that gol-bloominâ Hun machine!â

CHAPTER IIIâSLADEâS EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE

Indeed, to close this important matter now, Archer got considerably more than
the three tacks from the leather seat. He got a lock-nut from that âinferrnal
combustion engine,â (I suppose he meant
internal
), a splinter of
fabulous value from the casing of a Hun altimÃ©tre, and something which looked
like an American collar button, but which he assured me had had an adventurous
career above the clouds. He found it in the car of the machine and if it was a
collar button, why, it might possibly have been worn by the Kaiser, so it was
of priceless value in any case.

âWhat arre you doing herre?â Archer says he finally managed to ask, âin a
Hunâââ

âIâm standing here,â said Slade in a dry way which Archer says was
characteristic of him. âHelp me lift out this bag of sand, will you? There
isnât any time to talk. I escaped in this thing from the prison camp at
Azoudange. They sent away pretty near the whole guard. Theyâre goinâ to attack.
They didnât know I knew anything about aviation. Hurryâyouâll have to sit
there.â

âWhat became of the fellerr that went up afterr you back therre?â Archer
asked.

âHe had to go down,â said Slady dryly; âon account of the weather. Hurry up.
Iâve been hanging over you waiting for you to show me a place to light, but you
never would and thatâs just like you. It wasnât till you got stuck, just as I
knew you would, and moved your light all around that I got a good squint.
Chuck it outâquick.â

Archer climbed the step and looked into the cosy little car of a German
Albatross, two-seater fighting plane. Throwing his light about, he saw in a
quick glance the luxurious seat of the pilot and the plainer one for the
accompanying flierâa heavy bag of sand lashed upon it. He saw the compass, the
altimÃ©tre, the revolution counter, and something which he said looked like a
shade roller all wound round with oilskin.

âDonât touch that,â Slade warned as Archerâs souvenir-loving fingers
lingered about it; âits the rolling-mapâit shows a lot of things behind the
German lines.â

Archer climbed into the car, the floor of which was covered with water like
a leaky boat, and threw the bag from the seat he was to occupy.

âYou might have had sense enough to know you could never get anywheres in
the flat country tonight,â Slade told him. âWhy didnât you follow the Marne
ridge?â

ââCause I didnât know about it,â Archer confessed frankly.

âWhere are you goingâto Paris?â

âYes, or the nearest point of communication.â

âGood I picked you up,â said Slade.

Archer said he was so âflabberrgastedâ at this almost miraculous meeting
with Slade that it was some minutes before he realized the significance of all
that had occurred. âYou couldnât make Slady talk,â he told me. âHeâd only say
what was necessary and even then he was kind of clumsy telling things. That was
why he never botherred much with girrls, I guess. Maybe thatâs why they neverr
botherred with him.â

âMaybe one did bother with him and you didnât know anything about it,â I
suggested.

âNix,â said Archer, with great decision.

Then he went on to tell me at some length much that he himself did not learn
until afterward, and even then extracted from his hero much as a dentist draws
teeth. âI had to give him gas to get anything out of him,â he said.

It was a very remarkable story, and I will tell it now.

One night about a month before this Slade, on his motorcycle, had been
carrying a message from headquarters at Louzanne to a point some twenty miles
distant when his machine ran into a shell hole near the village of La Pavin.
This village was held by the French under constant menace from the enemy.

The hole was very deep and Sladeâs head striking a part of his machine as he
fell, he was stunned and lay unconscious in the ragged excavation for what he
afterwards judged must have been several hours.

When he regained consciousness he found himself in a predicament which must
have struck horror even to such a stolid nature as his. There he lay upon the
wreck of his machine in a stifling atmosphere of gasolene. Where he was he
could not imagine at first but he was thoughtful enough not to strike a match
to light his acetylene searchlight which, moreover, as he later found, was
broken.

Presently as he was able to gather his wits, he remembered what had
happened, but why the sickening fumes of gasolene should permeate the place he
could not guess until, feeling about above him, he discovered the appalling
cause of this condition. The shell hole was completely closed by a hard,
irregular surface which felt warm to the touch.

I leave you to imagine his feelings. He told Archer that he knew his
consciousness was but temporary. âI knew Iâd faint any minute,â he said. Yet he
displayed enough of his characteristic calmness to reflect that this complete
closing of the hole could not have been of long duration or he would be dead
already. Whatever happened must have happened within a very few minutes, he
thought.

âThat was just like Slady,â Archer said, as he told me about it. âHe neverr
got excited. He always just sat down and thought what was the best thing to do
next.â

Yet I think he must have been somewhat unnerved then. In any case, he felt
of his gasolene tank and found that the feed pipe had been wrenched away; not
so much as a drop of gasolene was there left in it. The slightest spark in that
horrible, dark prison would have resulted in a death more terrible than any
which the ingenious Huns could have devised.

Again Slade felt of the warm, hard surface above him and ran his fingers in
the interstices which seemed straight and regular. The surface was of a warmth
much greater than the stifling warmth of his prison, like a warm radiator.

His head began to pound and he suffered from a straining feeling about his
eyes, which was ominous, as an army surgeon has since told me. Yet with the few
remaining minutes of life which apparently remained to him, Tom Slade crouched
upon the wreck of his machine and
thought
.

I am telling you this not after his own fashion of telling it, as Archer
repeated it to me, for evidently Slade had no idea at all of the story
possibilities of his own experiences.

The result of his thinking was that with a piece of broken glass from his
headlight he hurriedly dug a deep hole in the earth in which he deposited his
papers, filling the hole again and smoothing it over. By the sheer power of his
will he kept his wits while he was doing it and having finished he had barely
the strength to bang with a rock against the hard surface above him.

âWhat did you think it was?â Archer says he asked him.

âI thought it was a tank,â Slade answered, âand I wasnât going to take any
chances with my messages till I knew for certain everything was all right.â The
result proved that this precaution had been a wise one.

I suspect that those few seconds of frantic banging, while he fought a
losing battle against his ebbing consciousness, were perhaps the most terrific
in all his adventurous career. He told Archer that his head swam and that
finally he fell exhausted, struggling like a maniac for each breath he drew,
his eyes throbbing madly.

He did not know whether the hard roof actually moved, for everything seemed
to be moving now, and he was wavering on the edge of unconsciousness. The last
rational thought that he remembered having was that the tank must have been
deserted. His leg slipped between the spokes of his wheel, he heard a strange
noise, saw a little round light, and thought it was a spark which would ignite
the fumes and....

What he really saw as he passed out of that borderland of consciousness was
a star in the bright, clear heaven.

They lifted him, limp and all but lifeless, out of that poisoned dungeon and
laid him on the cool earth and searched him for his papers. They had taken the
little village of La Pavin in a night attack. The huge metal monster which had
shut him in stood hard by and when he came to his senses he saw it there,
brutal in its power and its uglinessâheartless, irresistible, horrible. For I
will tell you on my own account that of all the engines of combat or of
locomotion which man has made there is nothing so loathesome in its
suggestiveness of soulless cruelty as one of these same monster tanks.

But Herr Von Something-or-other did not find the papers of the messenger,
and the messenger only smiled when they asked him about them. They raised the
broken motorcycle and looked about beneath it with flashlights. But there were
no papers. And so they took the messenger into the village and put him in the
little dressing station there and gave him oxygen and used a pulmotor and
brought him round. He said afterwards (I mean long afterwards) that the Germans
had treated him well, been kind to him, and that he did not believe all the
tales of German atrocities which he had heard. He said these Germans seemed
like friends. I mention this because he was subsequently accused of professing
sympathy for them and came very near to being court-martialled for it. Archer
says it was just his blunt sense of common fairness, a notable characteristic
of his, and that what he said has reference only to the treatment he received
on that particular occasion. In any event, nothing came of it.

Slade was taken, along with some of the defenders of La Pavin, to the big
prison camp at Azoudange, on the Marne Canal a few miles east of Nancy. You
will remember that as the place from which the balloon observer thought that
troops were being sent forward toward the lines. It is in Lorraine, not far
from Saarburg.

There Slade remained, and there he was on the stormy night of his great
adventure, which was to prove his brevet flight
[2]
, and bring him face to face
with his former comrade, Archer.

I suppose you know that Slade had always taken a great interest in aviation.
He had a Boy Scout badge for proficiency in this business, so Archer says, and
was pretty thoroughly posted on airplane construction and mechanics. How far
into the science these Scout studies took him you may be better able to tell
than I, but that they aroused a very intelligent interest in these things there
is no doubt. In the early period of his service in the Motorcycle Corps he was
attached to the airdrome at Calleaux where he was very popular with the
âfledglings.â He tried, indeed, to get into that branch of the service, but
without success. Archer says that Sladeâs practical knowledge of gas engines
was very thorough, he was something of an expert on cycle motors, and seemed
perfectly familiar with the type used in aircraft.

I suspect he must have learned a good deal in the hours of leave which he
spent among the fliers who were learning in the airdrome at Calleaux. Certain
it is that he hobnobbed with them in their barracks, for Archer says that Slade
told him of fixing their Victrola and varying the monotony of the single record
which they had by boring a hole in it a little off centre, producing a âwierrd
kind of music,â as Archer said. For this ingenious novelty Slade was taken up
with one of the instructors and permitted to âhandle the broomstickâ all by
himself. Whatever other experiences he had among that fraternal company he did
not communicate to Archer, nor to any one else apparently.

ROUGH SKETCH OF THE ROAD TO PEVY.

And so we find him in the big barbed wire enclosure at Azoudange, stolid and
silent, with an uncertain quantity of more or less superficial knowledge of
aeronautics in his towhead, and all the reckless courage of a heaven-born
adventurer.

It was characteristic of Slade that he did not let the guards nor even his
fellow prisoners know that he understood German and could speak it fairly well.
âWhatâs the use of telling anything you donât have to tell?â he said to Archer.
âAnd that was Slady all overr,â Archer remarked. So vivid were these little
things he told me of his friend that sometimes I almost felt as if I had known
him and I certainly wished that I could have seen him.

Well, a week or so before this stormy night Slade heard a German major who
was known among the prisoners by the martial name of Bottle-nose talking to
another officer about the quiet sector across the lines where the Americans
were playing baseball and having concerts. He listened with ears which would
have done credit to a startled hare.

Within two days he knew that preparations were on foot for a surprise attack
upon a very large scale; that the Germans were planning to take advantage of
the embarrassed condition of communications behind the American lines and the
supposed difficulties of observation. Thus bad weather may sometimes be turned
to good account. From the confines of his spacious prison he could see the
dimmed lights upon the canal near by and hear the voices which told him that
barges were passing along toward La Garde, bound for the front in French
Lorraine.

On the day before this culminating storm, the wire which enclosed the prison
camp and which had been dead for some time (owing, it was said, to the scarcity
of fuel and impairment of generating machinery), was electrified, and that very
night the entire guard was marched away, save for a few old men and cripples
who did âstretchâ duty
[3]
. Archer has it from Slade that one of these, an old
German with snow white hair, limped back and forth on crutches outside the
wires, covering his alloted distance of a couple of hundred yards or more in a
steady downpour, and was shot in the morning because he had collapsed in his
tracks.

I leave you to imagine the effect that all these portentous movements and
preparations must have produced in the mind of a prisoner who must needs watch
them and be impotent to do anything. The fact that the big prison camp was so
near the border and the battle line, where these hurried preparations were
intensive, was enough to distress the soul of a patriot. âSlady was all nutty
about it,â Archer said.

Late in the afternoon of that memorable day, Slade watched several German
officers, intent upon their observations through a powerful field glass. They
were evidently watching the observation balloon to which I have already
referred. Slade was required to hold an umbrella over the head of âHerr
Generalâ while he studied the tiny object which bobbed in the distance.

They were troubled about this little speck for it had an eyeâan eye in a
long tube, just like their own, which could see a very long way. And the final
number of their program of preparation was yet to come. If they were going to
get the troops from Pfalzburg through before morning they would have to begin
these movements before dark.

âIch wuensche sein verdammter cable wuerdc zerbrechen,â said Herr General;
which meant that he wished the cable of the balloon would break.

If they had waited a little longer they would have had the satisfaction of
seeing this aerial eavesdropper hauled down in fear of that very catastrophe.
But instead they discussed the possibility of spearing
[4]
the thing by
airplane.

Herr General said that no airplane could go out in such weather.

Major Von Something-or-other insisted that it couldâthat the Germans could
do anything.

The upshot of it was that they sent Slade with a message written in German
to the telegraph station in the commandantâs quarters. Slade read it on the way
and saw that it was a despatch to the great German airdrome near Dossenheim
requesting that a skillful flier with rocket equipment be sent at once to the
prison camp. Scarcely had he delivered it into the hands of the operator when
the young major followed him to make sure that it had been sent. Slade returned
to the leaky barracks where he lived and on the way âbunked plunk into
Bottle-nose,â as he said, âand had to salute him and say I was sorry.â

From which I take it that Sladeâs mind was wool-gathering. I have often
wished that I knew his thoughts in reference to his actions. I have sometimes
felt that if I could have seen him I might have pierced his inpenetrable
stolidness and reserve. These things that I am telling you in a fairly orderly
way leaked out of him, as it were, in his subsequent chats with Archer. The
nurses here have told me something of Sladeâs own talk, but it was fragmentary
and unsatisfactory. The more I know of him, the more I wish I could have met
him. He was a sort of stormy petrel of the service, and because he âtalked
clumsy, sorrt of,â as Archer puts it, and said very little at that, he seems to
have acquired rather more the reputation of an adventurer than that of a
patriot. But if Archer knew anything to his friendâs discredit, he has not told
it to me, and probably would not do so since his friend is dead. Very likely he
knew of nothing.

But to get back to Slade. What thought he had in mind on that momentous
rainy afternoon, who shall say? He told Archer that he sat down in his barracks
and wrote half a dozen notes, all in the same phraseology.

âDid you ever see any of Sladeâs handwriting?â it occurred to me to ask.

âSurre. Why?â

âHave you any of it now?â

âNope,â said Archer; âhe didnât botherr about letterrs. Why?â

âI just wondered,â I replied; âI think I may have seen his handwriting.â

âMaybe back in Bridgeboro, hey?â

âMaybe,â I said. âGo on with the story.â

âWell,â said Archer, âas near as I can rememberr, this is what he
wroteâhalf a dozen notesâall the same:

âThe Germans are massing from Champrey as far
east as the mountains. They are going to attack tomorrow. This is to let you
know. They are going to advance in close formation.â

Having written these notes, Archer says Slade told him he went out and
picked up as many stones. There was some string which had come around packages
sent to prisoners from the American Red Cross, and with this he bound each note
to a stone. On a junk heap near the barracks he had often noticed certain
stiff, rusty pieces of heavy wire turned into eyes at one end. They were two
feet or so long and he had always supposed them to be old ramrods from rifles
or muskets. He picked out half a dozen of these, tied the eye ends together
with a piece of string and hung them about his neck so that they depended
against his back and under his jacket and trousers. The stones he distributed
in his pockets.

Then he went to a sordid little shack where languished a certain French
soldier, Lauzerne by name, whom he knew and liked. Here is a time when I should
like to know just what he said. But at least I know what Lauzerne said. Slade
asked him if he would be willing to help him in a certain matter that night âif
things came around right.â Lauzerne asked what it was, for, though presumably
of French impulsiveness and generosity, he was a cautious poilu. Slade told him
(âI suppose in that stupid drawl of his,â Archer observes) that if a certain
German airplane should make a landing on the grounds that night he hoped to go
away in it and advise the allies of their peril.

âZiss eesâwhat you sayâcrazee!â exclaimed Lauzerne.

To which Slade replied that all he wanted Lauzerne to do was to turn the
propeller for him, but that he wasnât sure of anything yet.

We have it on his own authority that Lauzerne looked at him with dismay for
full half a minute and that Slade said, âWhatâs the matter with you?â

Then it was that Lauzerne threw his hands into the air, his fingers spread
wide, and uttered the national exclamation of France, more eloquent than the
Marseillaise:

âOi, la, la! Oi, la, la!â

2
. The supreme and final test for an airman before he enters upon
his regular war duties.

3
. A condition in which a number of guards around the enclosure being removed,
those remaining must lengthen their patrols in order to cover the ground.

4
. Approaching a balloon in an airplane and puncturing it with a rocket.

CHAPTER IVâFIRE AND WATER

As you know, the observation balloon was finally drawn down on account of
the weather, and this happened before there was time for an enemy flier to
attack it. A very short while after this occurred, however, a big German plane
was seen maneuvering in the thick sky, and presently came swooping down,
clearing the wires by only a few feet and coming to a standstill near one end
of the big enclosure. If the despatch of Herr General had instructed the flier
to proceed upon his errand of destruction direct from his hangar he might have
accomplished his purpose.

The weather conditions were so unfavorable for flight and the landing was
made with such conspicuous skill that even the prisoners who hurried to the
spot, hungry for any diversion, cheered moderately as the airman, swathed in
furs and oilskins, climbed out, threw his helmet into the car and, pushing
rudely among them, hurried to the commandantâs quarters. The little group of
forlorn prisoners soon dispersed, leaving one apparently half-interested
onlooker peering idly into the car.

That onlooker was Thomas Slade.

Archer tells me from his own observation that this plane was of the bad
weather type, oilskin coverings, and every part enclosed where enclosure was
feasible. Like most of the German planes (and everything else German for that
matter) grace and speed were sacrificed to strength and if any aircraft can be
said to be built to withstand the buffettings of the weather, the German
bad-weather Albatross is the one to do it.

I do not know how Slade felt in face of his great adventure nor
whether he considered the punishment which might befall for failure or even for
meddling. What he did, he did quickly, for dallying was dangerous business. For
a few tense moments he waited, patiently but anxiously. If he had any nerves at
all I think they must have been on edge then.

Presently, Lauzerne appeared out of the darkness.

âHave you got the can?â Slade asked him.

Lauzerne handed him a battered tin can out of which he had been drinking
water for six months.

âHand it here and go back a ways and watch if thereâs anybody coming.â

Like lightning he removed his almost threadbare jacket, tore off his shirt,
slipped his jacket on again, and tore the shirt into several strips.

âAnybody coming?â he whispered, as he broke the string about his neck. He
next pulled the pieces of rag about half way through the ring ends of the six
rusted bars and to the other end of each bar he fastened a stone with a note
wrapped about it.

âAnybody coming?â I can almost hear his impatient whispering.

No one.

He climbed into the car with his strange burden, and drew a
canful of gasolene out of the tank. Even in his hurry and peril he was
thoughtful enough to ascertain whether there was plenty of gas. Then he was
readyâif one can be said to be ready for a flight in a storm who is without any
garment save a threadbare suit of khaki.

But he was not destined thus to depart. He had just laid his message-bearing
missiles in the car and hung the can upon the bar of his steering gear so that
it would not spill its contents with the tipping of the machine, when his
companion communicated to him the appalling news that someone was coming. Slade
descended from the car, but had not time enough to remove his telltale
equipment. Lowering himself upon his hands and knees he did the only thing that
he could do in his predicament, which was to creep under the axle bar of the
wheels and lie parallel with it in the hope that he might appear as part of its
shadow. In this precarious situation he pulled his coat over his head and kept
his hands well under his body so that he presented no human sign or feature to
the casual glance. You may be interested to know that he told Archer this
trick, as he called it, was customary in the art of stalking and that he had
learned it when a Boy Scout. So his scouting did him a good turnâto use the
phrase you are so fond of.

Presently he could hear ponderous footsteps and was aware of someone
approaching rapidly. He felt that his great enterprise was soon to have an
ignominous if not a fatal end. What his feelings must have been you may
imagine, but he lay motionless and scarcely breathed.

The man approached the car so that Slade could have touched his feet. There
he remained for a minute, then turned and went away. Without so much as
stirring Slade waited until the footfalls had receded beyond earshot. Then he
crawled out. An oilskin tarpaulin had been laid over the opening of the car,
raised upon a hoop and buttoned to the sides to shed the rain.

âQuick!â he whispered. âAre you there?â

As his companion approached he removed this tarpaulin (which could not be
used thus in flight) and wound it around his body and legs, having first taken
his seat in the car.

âDo you want to go?â he asked, ready to cast out the sandbag on his friendâs
word.

âOi, la, la! I am not so crazee!â his companion repeated.

âWell, then, stand ready.â

Slade buckled himself in, fastened on the helmet, and turned on the little
electric light and carefully examined and tested the controls. The rudders
responded as he expected, the elevating planes moved to his touch. He located
the contact button and made sure of that. He felt of the gas manet and made
sure that there was nothing to differentiate it essentially from the same thing
on French machines. Such differences as he found were merely of style and
location. âIt is a matter of daring, not of learning;â he remembered those
words of Wilbur Wrightâs.

I think there is no moment in Sladeâs career when he appears so admirable as
when he sat there in that Hun machine, self-assured and confident, yet
forgetting nothing that he might need to know after starting. âHe always used
his brains,â Archer said.

âGive her a few spins,â he finally said. He wished the engine to suck in the
mixture.

âAll rightâagain.â

âThe motor took, first crack out of the box,â he told Archer; âand as soon
as I felt the vibration I knew everything was all rightâit made me feel as if I
could do anything. I pulled back my manet, full gas, grabbed my elevating plane
control, and sailed over the barbed wires hitting right into the wind.â

âIt made me laugh,â Archer said, âhow he always spoke about
his
controls
as if he owned them.â

The story of that extraordinary flight, at least the first stage of it,
remains a mystery. It is not until Archer enters upon the scene that we get
anything approaching a satisfactory view of that wild night in the skies. There
is no doubt that he passed over Arracourt, for one of his missiles landed
there, giving timely warning. The rag which was run through the eye end of the
metal bar had been dipped in gasolene and ignited but was sufficiently far from
the message at the other end of the bar to save it from the flames,
particularly as the stone had a tendency to cause the whole contrivance to
descend vertically. The flaming rag, as was intended, attracted instant
attention and brought a curious horde of people to the field where it fell.
Another of these fell in Pont a Mousson where, it is thought, the flier may
have seen the light of a burning house and considered the place to be
important. It was picked up by a little girl and was the cause of messengers
being immediately despatched to Nomeny and Thiaucourt and to Toul, where heavy
reserves were in billets.

Only one of the remaining four of these missives was ever foundâor at least,
reported. That was in the village of Lareaux among the hills about thirty miles
southeast of Verdun. So the flier must have succeeded in following the battle
line for seventy or more miles in a northwesterly direction. This last missive
resulted in heavy reenforcements being sent from the Verdun sector eastward.
Archer wished that he had one of these strange meteors for a âsouveneerrâ and I
should like to have one myself. Particularly, I should like to see Sladeâs
official report of his flight, but the powers that be will not vouchsafe me a
glimpse of it.

Archer thinks that after this seventy miles of bucking the wind and rain,
Slade must have ascended above the storm somewhere in the neighborhood of the
hills which filled the old Verdun salient. He told Archer that for a while he
was in quiet air about twenty-eight hundred feet up, but came down in hopes of
seeing the lights of towns into which he might drop his remaining missives. He
said he lost control in the storm and for a while was almost entirely at the
mercy of the elements, turning turtle once, and regaining and keeping his
stability by tremendous effort, while being blown in a southwesterly direction.
He must have been in the greatest peril at that time.

At last he saw the lights of a large town, or rather that bright haze caused
by the blending of many lights, which suggests a populous centre. Here he hoped
to make a landing if the lightning showed him a suitable field, and he tried to
manouver over the place, awaiting a flash. But he was borne in a southwesterly
direction and had all he could do to hold his plane stable. Archer thinks the
town was probably Commercy.

In any event, his drifting southward continued until he was above
Gondrescourt where he descended into the straight wind current out of the west
and found his progress comparatively easy. He was flying due west then, into
the very teeth of the wind but it was not as âchoppyâ at his height as the
belated cyclist found it.

It was just after Archer rode out of Gondrescourt toward the west, that he
heard the shots and saw the airplane in the openings of the clouds.

Sladeâs one object then was to make a landing, but he must wait for a
propitious flash of lightning to show him a place. He realized now, as he had
not in all the haste of his mad flight, that however friendly his errand he
would be shot as soon as the fatal whir of his propeller was heard and the gun
crews got a sight of him. With the big black Hun cross upon his machine he was
as good as dead if he attempted landing in a town, even supposing he could
discover a safe landing place.

And this, apparently, was the outcome of his heroic flightâthat he should be
a sort of outcast in the troubled sky. He had not anticipated the difficulties
of landing in a Hun plane.

As we know, he had twice succeeded in dodging anti-aircraft fire, and he was
now resolved to make a try at landing in the devasted flat country which
stretched for miles east of Brienne. He knew this country well, had crossed it
many times on his motorcycle, and had seen it flooded on one notable occasion
when he had ridden from Alsace to Flanders.

He could not, of course, even by flying dangerously low in such weather,
pick out the single road which crossed this area from Joinville to Brienne, but
in his extremity he chanced to notice far below him a sort of dusky shaft
moving along the deserted meadows.

It must have been a thrilling sight to the storm-tossed flier who only by
this sign was able to verify his very dubious idea of where he was. He knew
well enough that the shaft of brightness came from the headlight of a
motorcycle and he believed that the rider, whoever he was, was hurrying to
Paris, perhaps bearing the very news which he himself had dropped from his
stolen plane.

And here is an instance thoroughly typical of Slade, who could reason calmly
in wind and storm. âI knew if I was right,â he said, âand it was what we always
called the flats down there, and he was on the causeway road, why, pretty soon
heâd get stuck and then heâd throw his light around to see where he was at and
maybe it would show me a place to land.â

So he flew lower than it was safe to fly when constant maneuvering was
necessary, for of course the strong westerly gale which he was facing would
lose all its supporting effect instantly he took it in any quarter. Yet he must
manouver in all this hubbub of earth-wind, for the cyclist was proceeding
slowly and, as we know, with great difficulty.

It was just at the moment when Archerâs headlight threw its dusky column
across the meadows that Slade, alert and watchful, swooped down into the
unincumbered area which the guiding light had shown him.

In the whole war I know of no episode concerning individuals which I think
more dramatic than the meeting of these two. By all the rules of the
story-telling game they should have âparted no more,â but Slade, as I told you,
was a sort of stormy petrel, coming and going, and we can only hope to glimpse
him on the wing. Even the immediate circumstances concerning his death art more
or less of a mystery.

CHAPTER VâTOGETHER

âIt was just like you; I knew youâd get stuck,â were the consoling words
which Slade uttered to Archer. âYou should have gone by the Ridge road and
youâd have been all right.â

âYes, and where would
you
have landed if it hadnât
been forr me?â Archer very properly replied. âYouâd have been tearrinâ arround
the sky and maybe got stranded on Marrs for all
I

know.â

âDonât roll your Râs so much,â Slade replied. âCanât you say Mars?â

âIt was good to see him again,â Archer told me, âand hearr him talk in that
funny, soberr way he had. He was always kidding me about Râs.â Indeed, it would
be hard to say who was the rescuer and who the rescued in this extraordinary
business. I suppose it may be said that they rescued each other.

âWhat are we going to do now?â Archer asked. âIâve got to get to Brienne if
I can, or go all the way to Paris if I have to. They wonât do a thing but wing
us in Paris. I say, keep out of Paris.â

Which was very good advice, first and last, and more than one boy in khaki
had heard it.

âDo you know wherre we arre?â Archer asked.

âI know
about
where we are,â Slade answered. âThrow
your searchlight over there. See that kind of blackâââ

âYes, I see it,â Archer interrupted.

âI think thatâs the hills near Barsaby,â
[5]
Tom replied. âWait till I see what
time it is. Thereâll be a train leaving there about eleven, going down to
Chatillon. It whistles just before it goes in the tunnel. If I hear that I can
tell about where we are.â

âMaybe it canât run,â Archer reminded him.

âItâs got to runâthatâs a commissary centre,â Slade said. âAnd itâs right
along the mountains anyway.â He looked at his watch and saw that it was fifteen
minutes of eleven.

âWhat do you mean to do?â Archer asked, a bit puzzled.

âIf I hear that whistle, I can tell just about where we are,â Slade said.
âIf it sounds kind of dim south of here Iâll know weâre just about east of
Troyes. I know weâre east of Troyes but I canât tell if weâre a little north or
a little south of it. Iâd rather use my ears than a compass a night like this.
I can run her straight west all right, right into the wind, but if Iâve got to
climb upstairs I want to know it.â

Archer did not fully understand, nor indeed did I, except I infer that Slade
intended to measure the almost exact distance to a certain place (Bar-sur-Aube)
by the whistle of a locomotive and to lay his aerial course accordingly. I
think that here was another instance of the value of his woods lore and scout
training.

That he did this thing, Archer assures me. The rain was at last holding up
and the gale subsiding into a brisk, steady wind out of the west, and they sat,
these two, in the two seats of the plane, and chatted about old times, there in
that desolate submerged meadow. And here is something that will please you.

âHe was talking about Bridgeboro, wherre he used to live,â said Archer, âand
a fellerr he knew therre that got him into the Boy Scouts a long time ago. Roy
Blakeley was that fellerrâs name.â So you see that far away in the devastated,
scourged land of France, your name was given to the same wind which was to bear
these two adventurers to their destination. And so, chatting, they waited in
the lonely darkness.

âThe job will be getting her started,â Slade said.

âHow about landing?â Archer asked him.

âItâll be easier now Iâve got somebody with me. Got your dispatch book?â

Of course Archer had.

âThen go and get a spoke out of your wheel or maybe the timer-bar would be
better. Get two or three spokes. Youâve got your clippers all right, havenât
you? Go ahead. Iâll tell you when you get back. Get some wire off your
mudguard, too.â

âThere was only one way to do with Slady,â Archer observes. âYou had to do
just what he said.â

So he waded through the soggy field to where his motorcycle, half sunken in
the mud which had been a road, stood âpokinâ upwarrd,â as he said, âlike an old
balky horrse.â Its carbureter and gas tank must have been filled with mud by
now and there was no hope of getting a kick out of it even if he could have
extricated it. With his nippers he clipped off several spokes and removed also
the long nickel rod by which the timer was controlled at the handle bar. This
was about three feet long. He took also the wire and his nippers.

Scarcely had he returned when they were both struck silent by the thin,
spent sound of a locomotive whistle far in the distance.

âYouâre all right, Slady!â Archer exclaimed in admiration.

âItâs cominâ across the wind,â said Slade. âWeâve got to allow for that.â
He screwed up his mouth sideways, Archer said, and looked for all the world
like a âregularr old grandmotherr with his goggles up on his forrehead.â

âItâs all right,â he said finally, âweâre all right now if we can only get her
out of here. These old Hun ice wagons weigh about a hundred tons. If we fly
straight west weâll strike Troyes in half an hour. Even if we donât just strike
it, weâll see the glare and thatâs all I care about. We can land in the
school
[6]
just outside the town. Theyâll have the four lights on account of a
patrol being out, maybe. Weâll have to take our chances with the patrol. We can
fly square and there wonât be any draft, thatâs one good thing.â

I think you will see from his talk what he hoped to do. He knew that they
were not far east of Troyes, the most considerable place between them and
Paris. Here, undoubtedly, there would be communication with the metropolis. And
he knew of a landing place thereâthe school with its corner lights. There were
also anti-aircraft guns there, as he knew perfectly well, but he hoped to
anticipate their shots. He knew he could fly directly west without much
difficulty and that there was probably no place in this route with
anti-aircraft equipment So far, so good. If they could only get started. But
was he a little north or south of Troyes or directly east of it? If he flew due
west would he come within the guiding radius of its glare? A mile or so north
or south of the town would make no difference, so far as seeing its composite
glare was concerned, but then he would have to take the wind in one quarter or
another and run across it. And that he wished to avoid. Indeed, he might have
avoided it, by going above the current, out of the wind and into the clouds.
But how could he see the four guiding lights then?

In a word he wished to fly due west and hit his destination as a bullet hits
its mark. Perhaps if he had been an experienced airman he would not have felt
it needful to do this, especially since the weather was quieter. Perhaps he was
a little unnerved by his experience so far. Be that as it might, one thing he
knew from his knowledge of the roads and the country, gleaned when he was
serving as messenger. He knew that Troyes was thirty or forty miles west of the
hill town of Bar-sur-Aube, but a trifle north of itâabout five miles, he
thought.
And he determined how far north he was from Bar-sur-Aube by the
distant whistle of a locomotive.
And the sequel proved, as you shall see,
that his ear was tuned to the fraction of a mile.

I understand that in considering Sladeâs rather irregular application for
his brevet papers after this affair, it was submitted by an instructor
lieutenant that he had accomplished his feat by a âtrick of the scout rather
than of the aviator.â Did you ever hear such nonsense? Indeed, if that is so,
then all I have to say is,
Three cheers for the Scouts!

But to return. Slade and Archer made half a dozen or so âflaming arrows,â as Archer called
them, using the same idea that Slade had used for his missives. The principal
one of these was that in which they used the nickel time-bar and on this they
exerted special inventive effort Archerâs shirt was wound into a tight wad so
as to hold the flames longer, and was put to soak in the replenished can of
gasolene. To one end of the rod was fastened a note written by Slade, but
composed by both. This momentous and very characteristic missive Archer thinks
he can yet procure by reason of his âbeing in softâ with certain high Signal
Corps officials. If he succeeds I will certainly bring it home to you. In any
case, this is what it said:

Two Americans are up here in a Hun machine. Escaped in it from Azoudange
prison. Have news and messages for transmission to Paris. Also Hun airmanâs
roller-map kept from damage. We want to make a landing so donât shoot. If
everything is all right give us plenty of lights and fire three shots. If any
questions, fire shots in Morse Code. Weâll answer by dropping more notes. But
hurry. This is written on American messengerâs dispatch blank. Also notice
nickel rod is from distance type B American motorcycle.

Thomas Slade,

Signal Corps Messenger Service.

Archibald Archer,

Signal Corps Messenger Service.

Other smaller notes were prepared and âmountedâ and it was agreed that it
should be Archerâs duty to drop these conciliatory bombs one after another into
the school field near Troyes. They had purposely refrained from mentioning that
only one of them had escaped in the plane, for that would have necessitated
mentioning their extraordinary meeting and might have aroused suspicion.

Having prepared these communications and manufactured their âbombsâ by
attaching rags from their clothing, they proceeded with what seemed the all but
hopeless task of getting started. In this matter Archerâs headlight proved
invaluable. With its aid an exploration of the submerged field was made and
they found that a short distance from where they were it sloped up and was
quite clear of the water for an area of a few yards.

To the edge of this higher land they moved the machine, one at either end of
the plane, and set it facing into the wind.

The rain had almost ceased now, but the sky was still thick with little
flaky clouds. Archer climbed into his seat and Slade buckled him in, giving him
part of the oilskin tarpaulin for such protection as it might afford him. A
moment later they were off, gliding along the field until presently, as Archer
says, he saw the smooth black water of the meadows beneath him and knew that
they were gathering height.

âHe kept one hand on a leverr,â said Archer, âand watched the compass by the
light of the little electric bulb near it I saw we werre heading straight west,
but I couldnât talk on account of the noise. I knew we werre going higherr and
higherr, and it scarred me, kind of, that everything was darrk all
around.â

But there was a little bright spot near the compass and the pilot had his
eye fixed on that. Archer said he watched the altimÃ©tre and felt ânerrvous,
sorrt of,â as the plane climbed higher and higher into the black heavens.

5
. Bar-sur-Aube.

6
. He meant, of course, the big aviation school.

CHAPTER VIâUP IN THE AIR

The plane was running like a dream at an altitude of 1,800 feet and due west
when they became aware of two tiny lights far below them. Not a glimmer was
there anywhere near them and if Troyes were down there it was cautious enough
to keep itself in the dark. Archer says that Slade did not speak to him nor
even answer when he spoke, and he could only surmise what the pilot was about.
He saw the altimÃ©tre register lower and presently he saw another light, the
three forming a triangle. Slade said something about their being within gun
fire range, but Archer could not hear him clearly and instinctively he kept
still.

âI think itâs it,â he finally heard Slade say.

Archer did not fully understand why Slade thought it was âit.â He confesses
that he was ânerrvous and flusterredâ and did not dare to ask questions.

âGet your stuff ready,â he heard Slade say. âDo you see another light? There
must be a patrol outâthatâs lucky.â

As we know, Troyes was one of the places which Slade had often visited upon
his official errands, and there he had once or twice met Archer. So we may
assume that he knew something of the neighboring aviation school and field with
its guiding corner lights. If there had been no patrol out these lights would
not have been burning. At a secondâs notice any one or all of them could be
turned into a giant finger to probe the heavens, and Slade knew this.

In retelling, as well as I can, from Archerâs fragmentary narrative, the
tale of their heroic fight, I wish not to minimize the element of luck, nor,
upon the other hand, to draw upon my imagination. If I had Sladeâs story I
could write from the standpoint of the pilot, but as it is I am writing from
the standpoint of his anxious companion who did his little part, kept
discreetly silent and waited in suspense.

That Slade should have flown due west upon the strength of an original
calculation and come directly over this place was remarkable and greatly to his
credit. But he was mistaken in supposing that there would be a glare from the
lights of the town and it was a piece of sheer luck that the corner lights of
the big field were burning, for the night was not propitious for patrols.

Archer had just spied a fourth light, completing a square, and was dipping
his tightly wound shirt into the gasolene, when a long, dusky column moved
across the darkness, hesitated, groped, moved toward them, then away again, and
thenâthere they were in a field of brightness and he saw Slade as he had not
seen him in nearly a year.

âHe looked olderr and his big mouth was shut tight as if he was mad, but I
could see how his two hands that held the controls were steady, just like that
(he gripped one of the bars of the bed to show me), and I could even see the
ring on his fingerr just as plain as day.â

A shot rang out and the plane shook âjust like a dog shakes himself.â He saw
Slade yank back the larger lever and reach below him for another. For a few
seconds he was pushing and pullingâthe terrible shaking ceasedâdarkness.

Archer was trembling like a leaf.

âA miss is as good as a mile,â he heard Slade say. âDonât get rattled, sheâs
stable, drop your note, quick! Iâm going to get out of this!â

It seemed to Archer but half a second and then the four lights were far
away, so quickly is distance multiplied by the slightest movement in the air.
It seemed now that the square was all askew and the odd fancy occurred to him
that the shock of that gun away down there had knocked it out of shape.

âSee it?â he heard Slade say without any trace of excitement.

Archer looked and saw far below them and some distance to the west the
little flickering light of the descending torch, growing smallerâ smallerâuntil
it disappeared. He tried to determine whether it was within the radius of the
square but that was quite impossible, for the square kept changing, and as a
sort of vent to his suspense he watched it, expecting every second to find
himself in another glare of light, and then to go tumbling down through space.
Now those far-off lights formed a diamond, now they seemed to form almost a
straight line, then opened into a crazy sort of square and again looked like a
part of the Big Dipper; and the whimsical thought came to Archer that they were
above the stars and looking down on them.

He knew, of course, that these odd effects were caused by Sladeâs
manouvering, but he had never seen such effects produced while riding on an
express train or any other sort of conveyance, and the experience fascinated
him much more than did the very simple and obvious devices for controlling
their craft. âI felt as if I didnât belong to the worrld at all,â he said.

He does not know how long they manouvered, nor how much area they covered in
doing so, because there is hardly such a thing as distance in an airplane. An
aviator may go five miles to turn around. âAll I know is,â he said, âthat
pretty soon I saw something down therre, but not just below me, just like a
picture comes on the movie screen when the audience is all in the darrk. I saw
the buildings and everything and long lines, white kind of, like a baseball
field, only the buildings were all built slanting-ways, like, as if the wind
that was blowinâ a little while before had kind of pushed them over one way.

Believe me
, Iâve sat up in the top galleries at a good many movie shows,
but I neverr, neverr, neverr saw such a big, clearr screen.... âSlady,â I
shouted, âlook at those buildings, will you, how theyârre all fallen overr
sidewaysââ âI donât know which one of us is a bigger fool,â Slady answered,
pulling on the stick that moves the sideways thing in back and grabbinâ the
otherr one that he called the broomstick. âLook at âem, will you!â I shouted.
âTheyârre built crazy, or something!â â
Youâre
built crazy or something,â
Slady said, âlook at âem now.â And just then they straightened all up like
regular buildings, long barrns, sorrt of, and the white lines made a big
square, all nice and even like. âI swept âem straight with the broomstick,â
Slady says, in that soberr way of his, and just then the whole place tipped up
like as if it was going to spill all the buildings off it and everything was
all crooked again. âHave a hearrt, Slady!â I shouted. âYouâll spill the whole
concarrned village if you pull that thing again!ââ

âDid Slade laugh?â I asked.

âNo, he didnât. He just said he was a fool to tell them to fire three shots
when he might have known that if they believed the message theyâd just
illuminate the field. âMaybe theyâll fire âem anyway,â he said. âI hope they
donât fire âem up herre,â I told him. He didnât pay any attention to me, only
kept scowlinâ like he always did when he was especially interested and kept his
hands and feet both busy.

âPretty soon therre were three shots and I guess they knew down therre that
everything was all right because when we asked for three shots, that showed we
were greenhorns, all right. But they gave âem anyway. âWhatâll I do now?â I
said to Slady, for I was feeling mighty glad that weâd got there and that
everything was all right. âDonât do anything except shut up,â he says, so I
just watched him like mammaâs good little boy while he pulled and pushed and I
could see from the altimetrrre that we werre going down.

âWe werrenât over the bright field at all thenâheâd got way overr to the west
of it or the south of itâI donât knowâand the whole business was up slanting
ways againâway up. Then all of a sudden the long buildings began to straighten
out and be theirr right shapes again almost, and then just like that (he
clapped his hands with a resounding smack by way of illustration) therre they
werre away overr at the otherr end of the great big field standing as straight
as soldierrs and as squarre as a choppinâ-block, and us coming straight
towarrds them, and there was a company of Frenchies all lined up waitinâ, maybe
on account of its seeminâ sorrt of like a
kamarad
game, and there was
fellerrs running out of those long buildings pell-mell towarrds us and it was a
regularr kind of a circus. I guess we hit terra-cotta
[7]
too near the buildings
maybe, but anyway it was all right. A lieutenant climbed up and took a squint
at us and says, âGood shot,â and then there was a crowd all around usâfellerrs
that had been asleep, I guess, and a lot morre. The firrst thing
I
did
when I got a chance I went overr and took a look at those long
barrnsâdorrmitories, they were, and I said to a sarrgeant that was therre,
gaping all overr his face, I says, âI want to make surre these things ainât
built like accordions, âcause,
believe me
, you can twist âem every which
way when youârre up in the airrrr!ââ

âSee if you canât say air,â I said, smiling as he sat back in his wheel
chair, quite exhausted.

âAirrrrre,â he repeated.

âGood!â I laughed.

7
. If he heard any such word as this used, it was probably
terra firma
.

CHAPTER VIIâCHANGING SCENES

I have told you of the last part of this astonishing flight in Archerâs own
words, as well as I could transcribe them from my shorthand notes, because I
think it gives a very good idea of his own impressions. How Tom Slade felt
throughout that exciting night I can only conjecture. You knew him and I did
not. Imperturbable, resourceful, strong-willed, a little dash of grim humor (at
least, in his relations with the irrepressible Archer), and with the spirit of
adventure born in him, I can form some sort of picture of him in my own
mindâthe scowl, the big mouth, the towheadâbut at best he is something of a
mystery to me. I can fancy him on that wild night, one hand upon his
stabilizing control, the other on the handle by which he communicated his
dogged will to the rudders, a keen eye always fixed upon his altimÃ©tre or his
compass. Sometimes I fancy that I can hear that âsoberr, kind ofâ voice of his.
But as I say, you knew him and I did not.

I must now tell you of the practical results of his deed. You know already
of the movements which followed immediately upon the discovery of his warning
messages, and if you have read the papers I suppose you know of the iron wall
which the Germans found confronting them. Archerâs messages were opened and
read and such parts of them as required transmission were wired on to General
Pershing, who was then in Paris.

But these, important though they were, are not a part of my story. You will
recall that when the souvenir-loving Archer first inspected the Hun plane in
quest of booty, his longing fingers lingered upon something which looked like a
shade roller, hung before the pilotâs seat and which Slade had wound in
oilskin. It was typical of Slade that he should have thought to do this even in
the excitement of his escape, and this little act of foresightedness and
caution was destined to have far-reaching and memorable consequences in which
he was to be involved.

They spent the balance of the night in the barracks of this aviation centre
and, according to Archer, were treated royally by the student airmen, who, I
suspect, found him an amusing youngster for several of them gave him a sentence
to say which he repeated to their great delight. It ran something like this:

Roaring, raging, rampant, rambunctious rhinoceroses ran round rugged rocks,
recklessly raising ridiculous reverberating rows.
If he repeated it to them
as he did to me, it must have been very entertaining. He also sang them âPeterr
Porkerrâs Pig,â a ballad of the Catskills, I suppose, which won him great
applause. He says the airmen slept in the long dormitories, in rows on either
side, and that it was just like camping to be among them. In the morning he and
Slade watched some ground flights, made by beginners in machines with âclipped
wings,â which could not leave the ground. They wriggled around this way and
that, he said, and were very funnyâlike a âbarrnyarrd full of chickens.â
Several new men came in from their brevet, cross-country flights during the
morning and were loudly acclaimed, he said. It was fun to see them chase each
other round the field.

That afternoon Archer went into Troyes to have a new cycle issued to him,
and said goodbye to the comrade whom he was destined never to see again. Slade,
he said, was to remain there for another day while the instructor (Lieutenant
Tanner) endeavored to have him transferred from the messenger corps into this
branch of the service. He thought it would not be difficult in the
circumstances, and surely it ought not to have been.

And thus Archibald Archer passes out of the story. He remained my cot
neighbor here in the hospital until the day before yesterday, when he was
discharged as cured. He knew nothing of Slade after their parting at the
aviation school and it was not until he became a patient in the hospital and
saw the mended place in the roof that he learned of his former comradeâs having
been there before him and of how the stolid partner of their great exploit had
later gone to his last adventure high among the clouds. But of the intimate
circumstances of this he knew nothing.

You will think it rather a coincidence that all three of us should have been
patients in this same hospital, but such things are not unusual here in France.
I could tell you of four brothers who met in one of the big hospitals in Paris,
and of a father and son who met on sentry duty when one supposed the other to
be in Mexicoâsuch a kaleidoscope is this great war.

I began by being merely amused at Archibald Archer but I came to be greatly
interested in him and to like him immensely. He is the kind of young fellow who
is putting pep into this war, and I never dreamed until after he went away how
keenly we should miss him. Even the âcross red nurses,â as he called them, who
frequently had occasion to chide him, wish that he would be brought back with a

slight
wound. I shall never forget his souvenirs and
his apple-eating and the good old up-country roll of his Râs. If his luck
doesnât change (and I donât think it will ever change) and he gets home safely,
I mean to hunt him up on his farm in the Catskills and hear him sing âPeterrr
Porrkerrâs Pigâ once again. If all goes well, I promise you a meeting with him
and you can put him into one of your famous stories if you wish to. It has been
pretty lonesome here these last two days, and I thank goodness that I am
leaving the hospital myself on Friday.

CHAPTER VIIIâTHE OTHER GUN

I am writing this in Paris where I came to rest after seeing the boys
straighten out the last wrinkle in the old Marne salient. Itâs almost like a
tight-rope nowâa bee line from Rheims right through the woods north of
Campiegne.

The doctors sent me back because of my cough; the after effect, they say, of
being gassed. I am told that if this troublesome cough does not presently
subside it will be desirable for me to seek another climateâthe mountains of
Switzerland, for instance. I am hoping that this will not be necessary and
meanwhile I shall continue my tale of Tom Slade. For I have dug up one or two
more things for you out of his checkered career.

Each morning I come out and sit on the Boulevard, and do my writing in the
intervals of watching the sights. The benches are filled with crippled soldiers
and there is a little French girl who comes along nearly every day and
gives us each a flower. Nannette, her name is, and she is the only one left of
a family of nine who were kidnapped and butchered by the Germans in Senlis. She
wears wooden shoes and I listen for their clatter each morning. Directly across
from my favorite seat is the wreck of a house which was bombed, and the
soldiers are always picking up odds and ends to take home. It brings back fond
memories of Archibald Archer.

Well, when I left the hospital at Epernay I had two things, and one was this
cough. The other was the name of Lieutenant Tanner, of the flying field near
Troyes. It seemed that here was the likeliest means of finding out something of
Sladeâs subsequent career, so I visited the place on a pass and talked with the
lieutenant. I found him agreeable enough but rather brief. I suspect that he
does not greatly admire us âknights of the fountain pen.â He told me, among
other things, that Sladeâs landing had been âamateurishâ but quite remarkable.
He said that Slade took a âlow angle gradeâ or something of that sort, for to
tell you the truth, I donât know what he was talking about.

They were putting the men through their training in pretty rapid order then
in anticipation of the final scene, and physical fitness and natural aptitude
and daring once established, the rest was easy. Slade received a rather
perfunctory training at this place, made an altogether successful brevet flight
(his real test was the flight Iâve told you of), and was transferred to the
airdrome near Chalons on the Marne, where he was kept at the noncombatant work
of aerial messenger. If he had any interesting experiences in this branch of
the service I have not been able to learn them, but of the remarkable incident
which resulted in his being taken to the hospital at Epernay I have authentic
information, and of this I shall now tell you.

I have been at some pains to learn the full story of this singular business
and my information is derived from several sources. I will mention these now so
that the story, as I tell it, may not be cumbered with continual reference to
my authorities.

First, there is Captain Whitloss of the airdrome near Chalons, who was
Sladeâs superior and whom I cannot sufficiently thank for his hospitality and
courtesy to a mere fountain-pen warrior! Next, there is an old Frenchman of
the name of Godefroi Grigou and his daughter, Jeanne, aged seventeen, who at
the time this thing happened lived in the village of Talois, some fifteen miles
beyond the German line as it ran then. In the spreading of the advance which
began with General Fochâs counter offensive on the Marne, this village was
brought within the allied lines and I have visited it (or what there is left of
it) and talked with old Godefroi and his daughter.

The girl speaks English with a pretty, broken accent, having learned it, so
she told me; from an American who was in the German service. I think he must
have been a German-American, for he spoke German also. The only name they knew
him by was Captain Toby. He was in the German aerial observation corps, and was
for some time prior to the events which I am going to record, domiciled in the
simple home of these poor people, who were forced to share their meagre fare
with him and pay him homage. I have never seen this creature, but I understand
that he has many black marks against his name, and that it will fare ill with
him if he ever falls into allied hands.

I think there were never two happier people than old Godefroi and his young
daughter since their delivery from German arrogance and oppression. Their poor
little thatched cottage is now ten miles within General Fochâs iron line, and
here I spent one of the pleasantest afternoons I have known since I came to
France.

From these three persons, then, I learned the substance of the story which I
am about to tell and which I shall call
The Episode of the
Other Gun.
Even the conversations are substantially authentic and if I
have filled up the gaps here and there with a little of the story-tellerâs
material, I think I can assure you that I have held a tight rein upon my
imagination, and have not introduced any matter save what is obviously
suggested by the facts.

One afternoon, as Slade alighted after a flight to Neufchateau he was
instructed to report to the captainâs headquarters where he found two officers
connected with the secret information service. Having made certain that he was
the right Thomas Slade, they asked him whether he had heard of the great
advantage to the allies which had accrued from a study of the roller map of the
Hun plane in which he had escaped.

âI never heard anything more about it,â said Slade.

They told him that matters of the greatest importance had been revealed by
this map, such as the location of airdromes and ammunition dumps, official
headquarters, etc., and, most important of all, the positions, or rather the
neighborhood, of two isolated pieces of mammoth artillery which had been
pounding away at Chalons near by. One of these, they said, had been located
near Tagnoni and put out of business. The other was still active and creating
frightful havoc in Chalons and neighboring places. Its locality was marked by a
cross upon the German airmanâs map and a reproduction of this section of the
map was shown to Slade. It showed Talois in the hilly country about twelve or
fifteen miles behind the enemy lines.

âIt has been decided,â said one of the officers, âto send a flier to this
place in the plane which you brought from Azoudange, to reconnoiter and report,
if possible, the precise location of this piece. Specific instructions are
ready and if you care to volunteer for this service your offer will be
considered. You speak German, I believe?â

âKind of,â said Slade.

âYou were in the German camp how long?â

âAbout a month.â

âYou come of German people?â

âNo, I donât,â said Slade, âbut if I did it wouldnât be my fault.â

The officer looked at him with a sort of careful scrutiny from which I infer
(and so does Captain Whitloss) that they thought he had somewhat the appearance
of a German and were glad of it. They explained that individuals were not
detailed for such hazardous expeditions except upon their volunteering; that
they gave him this opportunity because he had brought the Hun plane into allied
territory, because he had been among Germans during his captivity, and because
he spoke German. They said nothing about his personal bravery, for they do not
do this in the army.

âDo I just have to say I volunteer?â said Slade.

âIf you wish to go.â

âThen I say it.â

âVery well; your instructions will be delivered to you by Captain Whitloss
tomorrow and you will be held at the field until then.â

Slade saluted and left the room. Throughout the balance of that day he
showed not the slightest ruffle in his stolid demeanor and in the morning he
wandered about the field watching the practice of his comrades. Once only did
he speak to anyone and that was to ask Captain Whitloss if this errand was in
the nature of a spyâs work.

âThatâs how theyâll treat you if they find you out,â said the captain.

âI donât mean over there,â said Slade. âIâm not thinking about that; but
over here.â

âWell, not exactly,â said the captain, which seemed to satisfy him.

In the early afternoon the Hun plane, which must have recalled vivid
memories to Slade, circled over the field and made a landing. Its pilot, one of
the aviators from the neighborhood of Troyes, brought Sladeâs instructions,
which I have been permitted to see. I think I may reproduce them here,
particularly as the episode is now a thing of the past and moreover you will
not see this until I return to America.

The messenger will commit these instructions to memory and, having repeated
them accurately to his commanding officer, will sign and return them to such
officer. He will then hold himself in readiness for further orders.

Upon receiving these he shall, at a time to be designated, fly to Suippes
where materials and final orders will be given him.

Upon his final orders for departure he shall proceed as follows: Fly
directly northward from Suippes, under safe conduct, and cross the lines at St
Estey. From this point he shall follow the line of the road which runs directly
northward to Vouziers. Both road and town, it is believed, are sufficiently
indicated in low flight. From Vouziers he shall follow the line of road running
eastward into the hills. Village of Talois is first village eastward on this
road. Continuing directly eastward over wooded hill he shall locate
whitewashed, thatched-roof cottage on road at edge of woods and make landing in
field adjacent. Inquire at cottage for M. Grigou and present credentials. If
hospitality is refused he shall return forthwith to Suippes. Otherwise, he
shall remain and spend following day in exploration of east slope of wooded
hill west of cottage. Spend day following in exploration of west slope. Spend
second day following in such further explorations as previous explorations
indicate. If gun is located, he shall note its position with regard to slope,
neighboring contours and such landmarks and geographic facts as may reduce the
area of its approximate position from Allied lines. On the night of third day
he shall positively return to base at Chalons.

Subjoined to this order was a list of items which might be more or less
helpful in locating his destination, and so forth.

Notwithstanding the very explicit character of these instructions, it is
plain that they left much to the flierâs judgment and resource. I suspect that
Sladeâs superiors were in possession of secret information which they did not
think it necessary to give the volunteer, but which might have afforded him
some reassurance in so hazardous a trip. For one thing, I understand it was
known at the time that the news of the ridiculous loss of the Hun machine had
been suppressed within the enemy lines. Whether this was the work of the
authorities of the prison camp in collusion with the German flier, I do not
know, but enemy prisoners (even officers) taken by the French and Americans
professed complete ignorance of this inglorious loss of one of their machines.
Perhaps it was this that determined the use of the Hun plane in this delicate
business.

Captain Whitloss says that Slade repeated his instructions word for word in
a âkind of dull, monotonous toneâ correcting himself even in the most trifling
details, then signed the formidable documents in a scrawling hand. I saw this
signature. It was written in a firm, but very careless, hand and read simply
Tom Slade. After that he played checkers until three in the afternoon when,
upon verbal orders, he left the airdrome. (Orders regarding time of departure
are seldom known in advance.)

Alighting in Suippes, he was outfitted with the shabby garment of a German
flierâremnant, I suppose, of some hapless enemy captive. He showed no surprise
to find here that his âcredentialsâ consisted merely of a tarnished brass button.

âWill I give him this?â was all he said.

Suippes is (or was) just a couple of miles behind the line and here Slade
remained through the early part of the evening, pitching ball until it was too
dark and then watching the boys playing cards in the Y. M. C. A. hut. A little
after ten oâclock he was ordered out upon his perilous errand.

Of the flight itself I know nothing, for I never saw Slade, and he was never
thereafter able to make a satisfactory report. But the proof of the pudding is
in the eating.

The night was crisp and clear with a strong breeze blowing out of the north,
and the sky thick with stars. It was the same night that Aiken fell to his
death from a height of nearly 3,000 feet and the descent of his machine, I am
told, was plainly seen. So the conditions attending Sladeâs departure were
propitious for his purpose. Indeed, if they had not been so his start would
have been deferred, I suppose. At 10.25 he was reported passing over St. Estey,
flying low, his propeller making that distinctive intermittent whir which is
characteristic of German aircraft. St. Estey is right in the âfront of the
front,â just within the first line trenches. It is told that a group of German
prisoners there at the time rejoiced that one of their fliers was getting back
home safely and that one of them raised his hand toward the plane and called,
âProsit!â

So Tom Slade went forth upon his dangerous business with the best of good
wishes on the part of his enemies!

CHAPTER IXâMONSIEUR LE CAPITAINE

It lacked a half-hour of midnight when old Grigou hobbled out of his doorway
and looked up into the clear, star-studded night. There was no other house in
sight, only the shell-torn fields to the east, and to the west the dark, wooded
hill frowning upon the poor, isolated abode. Even Talois was over the hill and
Mademoiselle Jeanne was afraid to go there because there were dead men to be
seen along the lone path through the woods and swaggering, leering Prussians in
the village. One dead man in particular she was afraid of because he sat up
against a tree near the path and was always grinning at her.

But the person whom she feared the most of all was Monsieur le Capitaine.
She did not know much about Monsieur le Capitaine excepting that he had come
from far-off America to help the Fatherland. And the chief way in which he
helped the Fatherland seemed to be by sprawling in their little house and
eating their food and ordering them about. She wondered why anyone should have
come all the way from America to help the Fatherland.

He was very efficient and very mysterious, was Monsieur le Capitaine.
Sometimes he came in âze flying machine,â sometimes on his feet. Once a small
dirigible had landed in the shell-torn field and taken him away. He used often
to go to Rheims and be gone for a week or more. Once Jeanne had flared up and
denounced him and his friends for wrecking Rheims Cathedral and he had told her
that this was nothing; that in America the people made a practice of destroying
the cathedrals of the Indians. He told her that England was to blame for
everything and that she ought to be glad that some brave men from America were
helping poor, lonely, downtrodden Germany to thrash England. He told her that
in America the national pastime was hanging black men and that all the
lamp-posts in New York had black men hanging from them. Jeanne had shuddered
at that.

Whatever in the world Monsieur le Capitaine was about, he was very much
engrossed in it.

Neither Jeanne nor her poor old father had ever dared to ask him why he
found their remote home so desirable. Perhaps that was the reasonâits
remoteness. About all that Jeanne really knew was that Monsieur le Capitaine
knew all about âze ships, when zey will go,â and that he had something to do
with a balloon with two black crosses on it. She had always inferred that these
two black crosses were a mark of special honor or distinction. Chiefly she
wished, for her poor old fatherâs sake, that he would not drink their precious
wine. If he would only let the wine alone, he could have ten black crosses for
all she cared....

So you will readily appreciate the feelings with which Jeanne heard her
father calling to her from outside the house.

âJeanne! Jeanne! Monsieur le Capitaine est retourne!â

Jeanne emerged with a look of inquiring disappointment upon her troubled
face and sure enough, there was the whir, whir, whir, whir overhead and a dark
object circling against the darker background of sky.

âWhat matter, papa,â she said resignedly in French; âfor sometime he must
come. So, maybe, he will soon go. So? We shall think of his going, never of his
coming. So, papa?â

Her father put his arm about her. âThis is my brave little daughter,â he
said. âBut come, he will wish wine.â

The girl did not stir, however, but remained there with her fatherâs arm
about her, wistfully following the dark object with her eyes. Now it went far
away and disappeared, now came back again. Now it came very low, now ascended.
Now it was directly overhead, then of a sudden it was coming straight toward
them, silently and very low, as if it must be another machine
altogether....

Out of it climbed Tom Slade of the Flying Corps, and shaking down his heavy
garments as he walked he approached the two, his goggles up on his forehead
like a prosy old schoolmaster.

âI zink it ees ze capitaine,â said the girl uncertainly.

âI ainât even a lieutenant,â said Tom Slade. âIs this Mr. Grigou?â

Upon the old manâs acknowledgement he presented his trinket of a credential,
that talisman which has won food and shelter for many a sore beset fugitive, in
the humble, devastated homes of northern Franceâa button from the uniform of a
French soldier in the old Franco-Prussian war. No compromising note of
introduction, bringing possible peril to its holder, could have been so
instrumental as this little memento, speaking the language of hallowed
sentiment. Your Uncle Samuel knows the value of these little buttons.

I must not linger upon Sladeâs personal intercourse with these people. I
believe that the information service knew something of conditions there and
knew that âMonsieur le Capitaineâ was temporarily absent. It would seem to
explain the very explicit instructions for Sladeâs prompt return. I fancy I can
detect another hand in this whole business and I think that Slade was merely
the active figure in the enterprise. In any case, it was pretty close work, as
they say. I am certain that M. Grigou did not expect Slade. The ways of the
information service are dark and mysterious....

Slade was welcomed by this sturdy old Frenchman and his daughter and partook
of a late supper with them, the while he spoke of his errand. He had made no
attempt, of course, to hide his plane and Jeanne said that he appeared not the
least disconcerted at the possibility of the captainâs returning unexpectedly,
which, however, she thought unlikely. They knew he had gone to Berlin and he
had said he would not return for a couple of weeks or more.

Yet for all that, and making full allowance for the possibility of the
information service knowing of this mysterious personâs whereabouts and the
duration of his absence, there is something very striking to me in Sladeâs
sitting there, his airplane outside, chatting with these people with apparently
no more concern than if he had looked in for a social call. Perhaps he was
safer than he knew.

âBut he does not have zeâcaire,â said Jeanne, throwing out her hands with a
fine suggestion of recklessness. âYou see? So. He say if one man come, why he
should caire! Oi, la, la, I say to him!â

A very singular thing occurred that night.

Naturally enough, they fell to speaking of the absent captain and in the
course of their conversation Jeanne asked Slade if it were true that negroes
were hanging from all the lamp posts of New York and if it were true that the
American people were really for Germany, but that President Wilson sided with
England and so made them fight against the Fatherland.

Slade told her that these were all lies and that he would like to come face
to face with the man, whether German or German-American, who uttered such
nonsense.

âHe say ziss is allâhow you sayânonsense,â Jeanne told me. âHe will not be
mad, because ziss is nonsense. So. I tell him all zese singsâonly he laugh.
Liesânonsenseâand he laugh.â

Apparently he had rallied her for believing all this extravagant stuff from
the curious German mind. âHe tell me I am so much at easeâziss is why I
believe.â I suppose he told her that she was
easy
. He
told her also that he would bring her some elephants and tigers from the
neighboring woods next day and so the talk passed off in pleasant banter.

What, then, was the surprise of both Jeanne and her father when, on showing
their visitor to the little room upstairs which he was to occupy, he strode
over to the old chest of drawers which stood in a corner and taking up a
photograph of a man in a sumptuous German uniform, demanded to know if that was
the captain.

âI tell him yess,â said the girl, âand how he make me take ze picture. Ziss
I do not like to have, but I am so afraid, I must take eet. So I put it
hereâyou see? Maybe he ask.â

Slade, according to her, took the picture, looked at it with an expression
of rage, tore it into pieces and threw it on the floor. âSo he talk low, too,
and say moochâvere rude,â she said.

To put the whole thing in a few plain words, he was evidently siezed with
ungovernable rage, declared he would kill the man upon sight for a lying,
sneaking wretch and hoped that he might meet him there and have done with it.
The girl was greatly surprised and very much frightened, and her father also
when she translated Sladeâs talk for him. Her imperfect English was not always
clear to me, but I gathered that Sladeâs outburst was such as to shock her and
it presented him in a new light to me. No doubt, these poor people had been
thoroughly cowed by the Germans and feared the consequence of any harm which
might befall their arrogant tyrant of the two black crosses.

âHeâll have a black cross over his grave if I ever see him!â Slade had
muttered when he heard of this evident badge of honor.

âEven when we leave him,â Jeanne told me, âhe sit on ze side of ze bed and
lookâso hard and his mouthâbigâeet ees shut like ziss.â And she compressed her
pretty lips with a very feeble look of grim and murderous wrath. Thus they left
him, a stranger in the enemy country, with perils all about him, for the little
rest which he might get before his dangerous business of the morrow.

Now this episode struck me as being very peculiar. In the first place, I
have it from Archer that Slade was of an imperturbable, stolid nature, and not
given to fits of temper. Also, on hearing of the captain downstairs he had
laughed at the girl for believing the stories the German had told her, and
treated the mysterious tyrantâs talk like the trash it was. Why, then, should
he have flown into such a fury when he saw the picture?

I thought a good deal about it after I left old Grigouâs cottage and the
explanation that I hit on was this: that Slade rather liked the girl and was
angry to think of her having this Germanâs picture. Then I thought of what
Archer had said about Sladeâs not having any use for âgirrls.â Well,
at least, I thought, Slade was rather erratic. Perhaps it was only a trifling
matter, but it puzzled me and it puzzles me still.

No matter.

There is a little oasis of scouting and woodcraft in this bloody desert of
war which will show you Tom Slade in a familiar lightâas you used to know him
at your beloved Temple Camp. And when you think of your dead comrade of the
good old days I am sure you will wish to think of him as he trod the forest
depths next day in quest of the iron murderer that lay concealed there.

I mean to recount this to you now.

CHAPTER XâTHE SOUVENIR OF SOUVENIRS

If Slade had any suspicion that âMonsieur le Capitaineâ was directly
interested in the great gun which was concealed thereabout, he did not say so
to old Grigou and his daughter. They, at least, knew nothing of any such gun in
their neighborhood, but they told him of frightful explosions which made their
cottage âshiver.â They seemed to think that such things were common along the
entire front and they knew of houses which had been shaken down by distant
explosions. Slade asked them if they had heard any of these explosions lately
and they told him they had notânot for several days. âOnly he shake his
headâvere wiseâso,â Jeanne volunteered.

He said afterward that he had counted on the noise of the monster to guide
him to it but that he supposed his visit was in an interval of disuse caused by
the ever-increasing scarcity of ammunition.

Early in the morning he set forth with a little snack which Jeanne had
prepared for him and following the woods path was soon lost in the hilly
forest. I have myself seen this forest at its edge and how any human being
could hope to locate a particular object in it is beyond my comprehension. The
woods path which ends near Grigouâs cottage follows a meandering course over
the densely wooded summit and winding down the western slope develops into the
single street of Talois village. I should say it might be five miles over the
hill as the crow flies and more than ten by the path.

It was long after dark when Slade returned, very weary and apparently
discouraged. He had seen nothing but dead men in the woods, he said. Not a sign
was there of any open way along which artillery might be hauledânot so much as
a wagon track. He was in a very ill mood and Jeanne tried to console him by
saying that as long as he tried it was not disgrace if he failed.

âSure itâs a disgrace if you fail,â he answered in a surly tone.

âI tell him ziss is noâwhat you callâdeesgrace.â

Then he made one of those puzzling observations of hisâthe kind which
Archer was always quoting.

âYou canât disgrace yourself either without disgracing a lot of other
people. If you could it wouldnât be so bad. Thatâs why I wouldnât want the
place where I live disgracedâor the whole air service, either.â

Jeanne apparently did not appreciate this line of reasoning and probably
thought Slade rather a queer fellow.

The next morning at daylight he set forth again and returned long after
dark, dog tired. He had wandered over the west slope of the hill down as far as
the village where he had talked with Germans, making his inquiries as plain as
he dared. The sum total of the information he had gained was just nothing at
all and he returned with the gloomy realization of the needle-in-the-haystack
character of his quest. I suspect that Slade was not a good loserâperhaps
because he was not accustomed to losing.

âI got one more day,â he said doggedly.

The next day he carried his explorations whither his fancy took him and
hoped for luck. This hill, so called, is in reality a sort of jumble of hill.
Deep gullies intervened to balk the traveller and the undergrowth and secondary
slopes, if I may so call them, make an orderly exploration quite impossible. I
do not see how it could have been otherwise. That he should stumble upon a
piece of artillery in all that litter of wilderness would have been sheer luck.
What he sought was a road of communication between this unknown monster and the
village. But there was no road. He returned a little after dark in great
dejection.

âHe will not spik to me,â said the girl. âI tell him
so
âthey are
crazeeâhow you sayâto send him. He will not even spik to meâor drink ze wine.â

Slade was always punctilious in obeying orders; he had the dogged,
mechanical submission of a German in that regard. He went out in the field,
hauled the plane about, tied a strip of surgical bandage, which he always
carried, to the end of a stick, and held it up to note the direction of the
wind.

It was at that moment that the cheerful, sympathetic French girl, seeing his
dejection, uttered the simple words which were to have such momentous
consequences.

âSeeâwaitâI will gif you ze souvenirâso you remember.â

I do not know whether Sladeâs mood permitted him a smile in memory of
Archibald Archer at the mention of that familiar word. But I do know that he
answered (rather rudely, I am afraid) that he didnât want any souvenir.

I like to think how great things are sometimes brought about by the turn of
a hairâhow Columbus, for instance, all but turned back in the fateful moment
when land was sighted. And I pay my tribute here to that frail, brave, cheerful
little maid in devastated France, who all unknowingly muzzled that big gun
forever. And hereâs to the Boy Scouts of America too and all their precious
lore of woodcraft.

In another five seconds Tom Slade would have been flying southward,
defeated, chagrined, ashamed. But Jeanne came running out in her pretty, cheery
way and handed him a charred splinter of wood.

âYou know how I tell you ze house it shake when ziss beeg noiseâhereâyou
see? Ziss come zen out of ze sky where you fly up. You take ziss to Americâ for
souvenirâyou see? Vive lâAmerique!â

Tom Slade held this splintered fragment down by the tiny bulb which
illumined his compass.

âIt flew here, you mean?â

âOut of ze skyâso.â

There was a momentâs pause, she told meâa fateful moment.

âI never knew that grew here; itâs swamp larch.â He smelled of it and
scratched it with his fingers. âHmmm.â It was charred and left his fingers
black and sticky. âHmmm,â he said again, âitâs swamp larch all rightâresin just
like cedarâhmmm.â He held it close under the little light and examined it more
carefully. He turned it this way and that. He scraped off some of the charred,
pungent resin, and sniffed it. He bit a splinter off and chewed it a little.
âHmm.â

She was pleased at his interest and said something which I think was very
pretty. âNow you will forgive me about ze picture?â

Tom Slade, of the Flying Corps, turned off the tiny light, shut off his gas,
and climbed down from his seat. It was the airman who climbed into that
machine. It was the scout who got out of it.

âI know where the gun is now,â he said simply. âA minute ago you said, âVive
lâAmerique!â Now
I
say, âVive la France! Vive
Jeanne!ââ

I am glad that at least he had the gallantry to say that.

CHAPTER XIâAIRMAN AND SCOUT

Slade made his report of this business while lying in the Epemay Hospital.
This I have not seen, but Captain Whitloss has told me of it. By reason of the
character of Sladeâs mission, neither he nor anyone else talked of it and even
the surgeons and nurses knew nothing of his late exploit, more than that he had
sustained a serious injury while flying.

âAs soon as I saw that piece of wood,â he told the captain, âI knew it was
swamp larch. That always grows near water and usually high up. I thought it
must have been right close to the gun, in front of it, because it caught some
of the fire. I could even smell the powder. I thought maybe it was a part of
the camouflaging in front. Anyway it was torn off a limb, anyone could see
that, and was near enough to get burned. In scouting they always tell things by
signs. She picked it up when it fell off the thatch roof and they had to
chuck a couple of buckets of water up there because the thatch was starting.
She couldnât pick it up at first, it was so hot.

âI knew there wasnât any larch at all where Iâd been âcause if there had
been Iâd have seen itâwouldnât I?â

The captain said he supposed so.

âThere was only one thing to do and that was to start with the brook and
follow it up. I had to start back that night under signed orders so there
wasnât much time. I knew if there were any swamp larches Iâd find them that
wayâsee? And then Iâd find out how a chunk like that could get torn off and all
charred, and be blown two or three miles maybe. I knew what to do then âcause I
had something to go by. Thatâs a scout sign, kind of.â

He certainly made good use of his scout sign. In less than two minutes, they
tell me, he had picked up his trail at the little trickle of a spring whence
they got their drinking water. It came down between rocks, a mere dribble of
water, as if from a leaky faucet. I saw this, what there was to it, and how he
managed to trace it through all its intricate windings, I am sure I do not
know.

I tried to follow it up myself and got just fifteen feet by a tape measure
when it ran under a flat rock.

This trickle led him, as he thought it would, to the brook from which it
branched off. He had crossed this during the day, but, of course, had not
followed it, for there had been no reason to do so. It led him for about three
miles through a densely wooded section where he kept a continual watch for
larches and cedars. But there were none to be seen and no point of elevation
commanding a prospect to the south.

He at last reached a place where the brook ran far below him between rocks
and he followed its course through this ravine with great difficulty until he
came to a point where it appeared to emerge out of a sort of cave or tunnel and
he climbed down to examine it.

He found that the ravine which he had been following branched out of this
larger ravine and that this latter had been roofed with boards and logs and
brush, forming a sort of covered tunnel, which was completely concealed save at
this point of juncture where the brook emerged into the narrower way. He was
now hot upon the trail though he probably gave no sign of excitement.

He judged by the stars, he said, that this covered ravine ran north and
south and if it did and ran fairly straight, its northern end would be
somewhere in the neighborhood of the railroad village of Le Chesne, or at least
near the line of trail thereabout, while its southern end would be at the steep
slope of the hills southward.

He entered the passage and found that the brook trickled along here not much
wider than in the narrower ravine, and that the bed of the passage was hard and
fairly flat. He reached above him and pressed against the artificial covering.
Cross-pieces had been wedged between the converging rock at intervals, two or
three feet below the upper surface and between these he could feel the
considerable thickness of brush which lay overhead. Wagons could easily pass
here, as safe from aerial observation as a rabbit in his burrow. And so this
sunken road and what it led to might be used almost to the last minute as the
irresistible line of Marshall Foch advanced.

TOM DISCOVERS A BIG GUN.

The rest was easy, yet it is characteristic of Slade that he called himself
a fool for not having smelled out this covered ravine in his wanderings. It was
dark and musty inside, the little brook meandering aimlessly from one side to
the other, with pools here and there, and the foliage overhead emitting a
pungent, rotten odor from its soaking in the recent heavy rains. Some of our
own boys, you may be interested to know, recently passed through this very
ravine in their advance toward Tourteron. But one look inside it was enough for
me.

Slade hurried through it, parting the matted roofing now and then for a
glimpse of the guiding stars, and was assured that the passage led almost due
north. And somewhere along this dark, sickening way, he was siezed with hauting
doubts, lest he be pursuing a phantom. What he sought was so great and the clue
to if so trifling! âBut I remembered how Indian scouts would follow a trail a
hundred miles just because they found a hair sticking to a bramble,â he told
his superiors. And so he hurried on, on, with hope sometimes mounting,
sometimes falling.

After he had gone what he thought was nearly two miles there came a welcome
freshness in the air which much relieved him, and he soon saw the clear sky
overhead. Before him, to the south, the open country spread away and in the
distance he could distinguish two or three tiny lights which he thought were
within the allied lines.

The ravine opened into a spacious basin filled partly by a small lake and
enclosed by dense woods. He followed the guiding stream out of the dank passage
and found that it had its source in this lofty little sheet of water nestling
almost at the very brink of a steep decline. In its black, placid bosom his
guiding stars were reflected and a sombre tree of swamp larch cast its inverted
shadow in the water.

Farther back there were othersâlarches and cedars. âGood old scouts, I told
âem,â Slade said afterwards; âthey love the water, same as I do.â So there,
Master Roy Blakeley, scout and would-be authorâthere is the sequel of your
Temple Camp and your Black Lake and your silent, companionable trees.

Tom Slade saw the lay of the land clearly enough now. This covered ravine
was in fact the lofty crevice between two hills, and from the distant allied
lines its end must have taken the form of a great rough V high up where those
twin hills parted. There was no suggestion of this upon close inspection, but
it is a faculty of the scout to see in his mindâs eye a birdâs-eye view of the
locality he is studying. Thus the scout has always two pairs of eyes.

What Tom Slade saw about him was just a lake amid woods rising on either
side, east and west, and below him, southward, an expanse of open country. In
the little jungle of crowded brush, which from a distance must have seemed to
half fill that big V, stood a great, ugly thing swathed in canvas. It poked its
big nose up slanting-ways at the stars as if to threaten those friendly
monitors of the night for helping this weary young fellow who stood leaning
against it, trying to realize his good fortune. All about it and over it the
brush and foliage clustered, as if ashamed to own its presence in their still,
obscure retreat; and in front of it, between it and the steep decline, a
graceful larch tree stood in all its silent, supple dignity. From one of its
lower spreading limbs a broken branch hung loose, the splintered remnant
blowing to and fro in the night.

âIt seemed as if it must hurt,â said Slade to Captain Whitloss, âand I felt
kind of as if I ought to go and bandage it upâespecially as it did me such a
good turn, as you might say....â

CHAPTER XIIâTHE LAST ADVENTURE

And so, like Archibald Archer, that murderous old brute of the wooded hills
passes out of the story. A gun crew in Santois turned their handle until they
got the muzzle of their gun just exactly where they wanted it and that was
straight for the big wooded V between the hills. And having fixed everything
just right, they let flyâonce, twice, three timesâand once again for good
measure. And the old giant of the mountains was never heard from again. But
when those hills where Tom Slade hurried in the night finally came within the
iron lines of Marshal Foch, they found the poor old monster knocked clear off
his pedestal, where Tom Slade of the Flying Corps had leaned to rest that night
when his scouting lore did not forsake him.

But gun crews and fliers notwithstanding, I like to think that the hand
which put that steel brute out of business was the small white hand of an
eager, generous little French girl who lived away at the foot of those hills in
the enemy country. And I am sure that Archibald Archer would grin with
unspeakable delight if he could but know that this good end was accomplished by
a âsouveneerrr.â

I am now close upon the end of my reminiscences of Tom Slade with the Flying
Corps and it remains only to tell you what little is really known about his
tragic end.

On his way back from the enemy country that night he was blown out of his
course and drifted over La Chapelle which is about midway between Epemay and
the now famous Chateau-Thierry. If he had been able to fly low enough to follow
the road through Suippes to Chalons all would have been well, for the
approximate time of his return was known, and no shots were to be fired.
Indeed, so far west as La Chapelle they knew of his being abroad on secret
business, and should not have fired. But a smart Aleck anti-aircraft crew,
hearing the whir of a Hun machine, must take a pop at it and Slade fell with a
fractured head among the tangled ruins of his machine. And that was the end of
the Hun plane.

Our newspaper said that Slade was âsuffering from a slight wound received
near La Chapelle.â Nothing about this blundering business which all but lost
him his life. In point of fact he suffered from very grave mental disturbances
as a result of his fall and I believe that he had not regained in full measure
his mental faculties at the time of his final exploit But in this I may be
mistaken. In any event, he was morose and despondent while in the hospital,
often mumbling threats to kill someone. You will be glad to know that Jeanne
visited him there, which seemed to please him, and I think that if he had lived
they might, perhaps, have seen more of each other. One of the nurses told me
that he asked Jeanne if âthat man came backâ and when she said that he did,
Slade compressed his lips and said nothing. That matter is a mystery to me. He
made few friends in the hospital, because of his natural taciturnity, and also
because of his mental depression.

He was well on toward recovery, however, when the bomb was dropped which
killed two of the nurses. There seems to be no authority for his vowing
vengeance against the hostile fliers, but he is remembered to have said that he
âknew it was that manâs work.â

He was discharged from the hospital as cured, and after some difficulty
succeeded in being reinstated in the Flying Corps, with a combat plane, which
was now his one desire. âI got a special reason,â Captain Whitloss says he told
him. Those are the last words which I have heard of as coming from Tom
Slade.

Of the circumstances attending his last adventure you are already aware, and
save for a bit of lurid coloring, the newspaper account seems to be about
correct. He rose in pursuit of the Hun plane from Jonchery, west of Rheims, but
there seems to be no reason to suppose that he knew who, in particular, he was
pursuing.

Both planes passed out of sight above the clouds and shortly thereafter the
enemy plane was seen to fall. It fell in La Toi, as the news article stated,
just within the allied lines. Its occupant, a German named Otto Brenner, was in
the wreckage, quite dead. The fuel tank of his plane had been shot through.

About ten minutes afterward Sladeâs empty machine came fluttering down,
turned turtle and plunged headlong to earth. It did not fall upon a ârocky
hillsideâ as the paper stated, but in a field within the allied lines. The body
of Tom Slade was seen to fall separately but there can be no truth in the
declaration which one heard in Rheims (especially among children) that it
descended ten minutes after the plane fell. Such a thing would be manifestly
impossible.

It is true that a German airman, flying over the American lines, dropped the
cap said to have been worn by Slade. In it were his identification disk,
corresponding to the number against his name in the army files, and the gold
cross which he won while a scout. The Germans found his body half way up a
rocky slope and buried it in Pevy which now is in the hands of Americans. I
visited the grave which had a little white wooden cross above it on which his
name is carved in rough letters, very German. I understand his name was sent to
them across No Manâs Land under a white flag after his identity has been
ascertained from his disk number. So maybe Fritzie has a soft spot, after
all.

For your sake I laid a little wreath upon the grave and wrote on a piece of
bark (which I think you told me is the Scoutsâ writing material) that it was
from the troop in Bridgeboro.

PART THREEâTHE GRAY METEOR

I

Tells of certain perplexities which confronted me; also of how I journeyed into Switzerland and of how I first chanced to see the Gray Meteor.

The foregoing chapters which embody the story of Sladeâs career, were, as I
have said before, intended for the perusal of Roy Blakeley alone. They form, as
you will have seen, a sort of story within a story. What went before, and what
I am now about to write, would never have been written (much less published)
save for the startling discoveries which I have recently made. As I feel now, I
should like not only Roy Blakeley, but the whole world, to know the full truth
of this strange business.

You will have noticed, no doubt, that in my somewhat rambling story of
Sladeâs career I refrained from mentioning the shocking revelations that were
contained in the papers which I found in the Scuppers. To me (who did not know
him), the death of the brave airman was not so much of a shock, but that he
should have sold himself and his undoubted talents to the enemy while all the
while keeping up the appearance of loyal service to the United States, was
appallingâalmost unbelievable. When and how, in those latter days of his brave
career, he had played into their blood-guilty hands, I could not conjecture.
But that is the wily genius of spies and traitors.

I tried to make allowance for him on the supposition that his mind had been
polluted, his vision knocked askew, away back home by the disloyal German by
whom he had been employed. I told myself that though he was brave, he was yet
ignorant and weak, perhaps.

They had sent him into the enemy country partly because he had, in some
measure, the German type of countenance and spoke German passably. Was there
some obscure vein of German running in him, I asked myself. That might
explain, though it would not excuse. He had spoken in blunt praise of his
German captors and had come near to being court-martialled for it. Was that
just common fairness to certain Germans in a particular instance? Or did it
show the bent of his mind? It almost made me sick to think about it. And I felt
guilty to be perpetuating his reckless courage for the benefit of the boy who
had believed in him and still revered his memory.

It is enough for me to say now that I shall write the balance of this story
with a clearer conscience.

Perhaps you will say that I should have come to believe in him when I
learned of his brave, heroic acts. But I beg you to remember the watch, with T.
S. engraved on the back of it, and the wallet packed full of treason which was
connected with it by a heavy lock-link chain. You remember that? You remember
that the watch was made in America? You remember that in that wallet was the
photograph of a Bridgeboro girl? Bridgeboro, only a small place too, where he
had lived and where I lived, and where Roy lived. You remember the part of that
girlâs letter on the back of which was written a traitorous memorandum? Here it
is nowâI copy it:

... looked about it seemed as if everyone in Bridgeboro was
there. And of course the Boy Scouts and that excruciating imp of a Blakeley boy
were on handâRuthâs brother, you know. Oh, by the way, who do you suppose is
in the old place on Terrace Ave? Guess. The Red Cross ladies,
and Iâm working with

Heaven knows how many times in my mind I afterward tried to wrench that
chain asunder and separate that name from the mementoes of treachery and crime,
just as I had actually tried in my amazement and bewilderment as I sat in that
little dank cave away up in the Scuppers where he had fallen.

But in the end of it this was the sad conclusion that I reachedâthat brave
and heroic exploits may be colored and exaggerated by those who tell them, but
that records kept in secret do not lie. And if I did not picture the
adventurous young American as a patriot in those gathered reminiscences of his
career, it was because I could not, for the haunting thought of some unknown,
dark activities of his were always in my mind, a stalking spectre. Yet not a
hint did I give to Archer even, much less to Roy, of what I had found out.

But there were one or two things which often puzzled me in the writing of
those chapters for Roy and I will mention these now. One was that Archer told
me Slade had no use for girls and never received letters from them. Yet here
was a very friendly, companionable letter, or part of one, at least. Perhaps
that is of no importance.

But this Bridgeboro girl had said in her letter that
that extraordinary imp
of a Blakeley boy was on handâRuthâs brother
. Did not Tom Slade know that
Roy was Ruth Blakeleyâs brother, without her saying that? Could she have
supposed that he did not know who Roy was?

I thought about it a good deal and I did not cease to think of it until a
certain trouble of my own intervened and put all thoughts of Tom Slade out of
my mind for the time. This was the very troublesome cough I had contracted as a
result of being gassed. I could not seem to get the gas out of my lungs, and it
was becoming a matter of concern to me. I have seen young fellows, recovered
from the immediate, acute effects of gassing, go to the wall with consumption.
So when the doctors in Paris told me that a change of air would be my best
physician I lost no time in seeking the mountains of Switzerland. I may
mention, if you care to know it, that I am now quite recovered and that with
returning strength there came to me a great light which brought me happiness
and peace of mind.

Of this I must now tell you.

The little hamlet of St. Craix is about thirty miles south of Basel in a
jumble of mountains which anywhere else but in Switzerland would require a
couple of hundred square miles to stand in. Solothurn is the nearest place of
any size but not exactly near enough to be neighborly, and the great Ramieux
Mountain rears its mighty bulk to the north. Some twenty odd miles to the west
is France, but I should say it would be a couple of hundred million miles, more
or less, if you went over the mountains. From Ramieux Mountain I think you
could slide down to Vetroz, get lunch, and then slide on down and catch the
train at Delemont.

My host, Hans Twann, had his little hostelry on the side of Meiden Mountain,
a mere hubble of a couple of thousand feet or so, and his orchard tilted up
like a picture on an easel. With the apples that grew in this orchard he made
cider, and he also made Kirschwasser, a very agreeable beverage notwithstanding
its formidable name.

He accommodated tourists on the side, in more ways than one, since
his land was all up and down, and from a distance his quaint little place must
have looked as if it were fixed like a postage stamp against the rising wall of
the mountain. What kept it there I cannot for the life of me tell you. I always
felt safer in back of it for then, if the worst happened, I should fall down
against it and stop. There was a little odd patch of level land here, too, and
he utilized it for an arbor where I used to sit.

Here Herr Twann would often join me and I would banter him about the
insignificant size of his country. âAch,â he would say, âdat iss becauss it
iss all crunched upâwhat? Like a piece of trash paper. Spread it out flat and
it iss bigger dan your United States.â There was some force to this
argument.

Herr Twann and his little household talked German among themselves, like
most of the inhabitants of northern Switzerland, though they all spoke a sort
of English which they had picked up from the many tourists who resorted to the
funny little place before the war.

His two children, Egbert and Emmie, were my particular friends and many were
the Alpine rambles that we had together. They were about ten and eleven
respectively, I think, the girl being the younger. Often we would go down into
St. Craix, the oddest little community you would wish to see, with its little
spired chapel just like a church in a toy village.

It was upon the Sunday of my first attendance at this church that something
happened which greatly distressed me. It all grew out of the mischievous banter
of those children. When the service was over they showed me the relics (of the
sort that any church in Switzerland has), hallowed mementoes of saints and
martyrs, and I hope I showed a seemly reverence for them. As we left the hamlet
they led me to a window of the little schoolhouse and showed me within a skull
which they said had been found in a glacier.

âNow,â said I, âif you will show me the apple that William Tell shot from
his sonâs head, I shall have seen all the sights.â

âWe will show you the gray meteor,â they said. âYou know what dat meteor
iss?â

âA big rock,â I told them, and I added sagely that we were not so stupid in
America.

They laughed and said I should see what kind of a rock this âgray meteorâ
was.

After we had walked some distance they began looking eagerly across a
certain field at the farther side of which a mountain arose. Right at the base
of this mountain was a kind of grove. Their laughing voices echoed back from
the rugged height as we entered the field, and sounded clear and musical in the
quiet calm of that Alpine Sabbath morn.

âCome,â they urged.

As we neared the foot of the mountain the irregular contour of the base
developed into little rocks and caves, and then I saw emerging from one of
these a living figure which paused irresolutely, watching us.

âSeeânow you are fooled!â little Emmie cried. âYou are so sure it iss a
rock!â

âYou mean
that
is the meteor?â I asked.

âSoâyou are fooled!â she answered gleefully.

As we approached closer, I could see the figure clearly, and a more forlorn
and pitiable spectacle I have never gazed upon. Seeing me, he started to run,
but thinking better of it, paused and waited for us with an aspect of
indescribable terror. I wore the regulation khaki uniform of correspondents at
the front, and this he seemed to scrutinize with a kind of bewildered
agitation.

âHello,â I said, as we reached what I suppose I must call his lair. âHow are

you
this bright Sunday morning?â

He made no answer, but watched me furtively and once or twice seemed on the
point of making off. It was evident that he either lived or spent much time in
a little cave formed by the rocks for near this were the charred remnants of a
fire. He was a young fellow of perhaps twenty, with blond, disordered hair,
and blue eyes, which latter feature disconcerted me greatly for they bespoke a
kind of breathing suspense, entirely unwarranted by our innocent intrusion. His
cheekbones were very noticeable, he looked thin and ill-nourished, and the end
of his mouth twitched distressingly.

As to his apparel, it was in the last stages of shabbiness. His trousers
were, I dare say, of khaki, but they hung loose and looked ridiculous in the
absence of accompanying puttees. He wore the coat of a German officer (of what
rank or branch of service I could not say) and to complete his grotesque
appearance, he had a compass hung on a cord around his neck which dangled upon
his chest like a ladyâs ornament.

âWell, how do you find yourself?â I repeated at a venture, for I did not
know whether or not he spoke English. He looked at me for a few seconds, picked
up a stick and then began to cry.

Seeing that no exchange of communication was possible between us, and
feeling that my intrusion was chiefly responsible for his agitation, I told my
little friends that we had better go. They seemed delighted to have exhibited
this creature to me.

âI think we should not laugh at him,â I said, as we resumed our homeward
way. âHis brain is evidently not right and he is sick. Why do you call him the
gray meteor?â

âIs he not grayâhis coat?â piped up young Egbert.

âYes, butâmeteor.â

âAch, he come nobody know whereâlike out of the sky.â

As I looked back I could see the poor creature kneeling over his charred
fire rubbing one stick across another so that it looked as if he were playing a
violin.

II

Tells of my visit with the Gray Meteor and of how I
entertained him and of his call upon me.

You will believe that I lost no time in quizzing my host about this
mysterious âgray meteor.â

âAch,â said he, âsome deserter. Geneva and Locle are full uff them.â

âGeneva and Locle are near the border,â I said, âand all they have to do is
to take a hop, skip and a jump to get there. There are some from over the
Rhine, too,â I added, for I did not relish his implication that all deserters
were from France.

âWell, diss one is American, anyway,â he said.

âAnd how about his German coat?â I asked; âhow do you know he is American?â

âHe iss crazy, dat is why,â he laughed. âHe must be alwavss camping out.
Donât you worry about him.â

âHe is not crazy,â I retorted, a bit nettled, âbut I will tell you what is
the matter with himâââ

âSure, he iss lazy.â

âHe is suffering from shell shock or something of that sort,â I said,
ignoring his remark. âAnd what I should like to know is, how did he find his
way up here in such a state. Besides,â I added, âhe should have care and
companionship. He is in no condition to be living in that hole of a cave. Do
you know anything about him?â

âHe come apout a montâ agoânobody knows how. I ask him een, put he will haff
nudding. The childrens, dey call him de gray meteor. Maybe he come from
Marsâwhat?â

I soon found that if this poor, strayed soul had ever been a sensation he
had long since ceased to be one. The children still found him a source of
entertainment, made fun of him, and I am afraid, annoyed him. Otherwise he
lived in his cave, shunned the village and all other haunts of men. I
understood that he lived chiefly on fish which he caught, but sometimes the
children left food near his solitary retreat.

As to his being a deserter, that may very well have been the case, I
thought, but deserter or not, he was suffering from shell shock if I knew
anything about the manifestations of that dreadful thing.

How he had penetrated so far to this obscure retreat I could not conjecture,
for though not far distant in miles from the border, the spot was unfrequented
and almost inaccessible. Nor was such remoteness necessary. In Basel, or any of
the places along the western frontier, he would have been as safe from
molestation as at the North Pole. First and last, his presence there puzzled
and interested me, and his condition aroused my sympathy.

All the next day my thoughts dwelt upon his gaunt appearance and frightened
look and on that vacillating timidity and uncertainty of action which bespoke a
crippled power of will. There was no mistaking those signs; I had seen them
before.

The morning following I dug into my grip and picking out several of the
bully old pals which I had brought with me, sallied forth to the retreat of the
âgray meteor.â From what Herr Twann had said I surmised that he spoke English
and finding him kneeling by the ashes of his fire, in about the same position
as when I had left him the day before, I said cheerily:

âGood morningâfine Alpine weather.â

The look he gave me pierced me to the heart. I felt that he would either run
away or crawl to me like a guilty dog in grovelling shame. He breathed heavily
and his eyes were lit with an anguish of terror. He started to rise but
apparently had not the strength of will to lift himself and as he crouched
there a twig broke under his feet and he started as if a cannon had been shot
off close by.

âI think youâve been trying to get a fire,â said I pleasantly, âby rubbing
those two sticks together. Am I right?â

He only looked at me and smiled uncertainly. âThatâs a pretty hard stunt,â I
continued. âSuppose we start it with a match this time and tomorrow Iâll hunt
this business up. Iâve a book that tells about those things. You and I will run
through it together.â

I lighted the little parcel of twigs which he had gathered and after
watching the flame a few moments he said, âMore?â and seemed irresolute whether
to bring more twigs or not.

âA few more, then a couple of big pieces, and weâll be all hunk,â I
said.

The fire well started, we sat down beside it.

âItâs hot, isnât it?â he asked nervously.

âQuite hot,â said I.

Then he gulped as if it had been an effort for him to say that much.

âYou were right the first time,â I added, which seemed to afford him a kind
of childish pleasure.

âNow,â said I, âif you think Iâm a soldier because I have on this khaki
suit, youâre mistaken. Iâm a fellow that writes stories and things, and I like
to camp just as you do. I think you and I are very much alike. Will you tell me
your name?â

He shook his head, smiling weakly. It seemed to me that he had no objection
to telling me, but that he just lacked the stamina to do it. I therefore began
to speak of something else and after a moment he said:

âTasso.â

âIs that your name?â

He nodded as if he had done a great thing in telling me. Then a slight
movement of my arm startled him and he jumped and trembled.

âAre you Italian?â I said; âis that your first name or your last name?â

âBoth,â he said.

âWell,â said I, âyou and I are going to be friends, anyway. And Iâve brought
along another friend, too. Heâs in a book named
Kidnapped
.
He went on a long hike and lived in caves just like you. He made a long trip
through mountains with a companion and at last got to Edinburgh.â

He looked at me for a moment in a puzzled way and then asked hesitatingly,
âDid he get there in the night?â

âIndeed, I donât remember,â I said, âbut we shall find out.â

Suddenly he began to cry like a baby and it was pitiful to see him. While he
was crying I began to read those wonderful adventures of David Balfour and he
soon seemed to listen. But with every stir he would start like a frightened
animal and he had a way of twisting and pulling the cord around his neck which
was heartrending to see, so weak and aimless was it. But he was attentive and
evidently interested.

Thus began my acquaintance with that forlorn derelict of the great war, and
my simple program for helping him seemed to have begun auspiciously. Each day I
visited him and read to him and though he said little, and that to no purpose,
he seemed interested and would listen silently hour after hour, starting at the
merest sound or movement, and twirling and twisting the cord on which hung his
rusty, broken compass.

On the evening of the fourth or fifth day I saw him coming up the mountain
path toward the little inn. He paused trembling at the edge of our little arbor
and breathed as if he were very weary. I rose slowly, being particular to make
no noise or sudden movement, and greeted him as if he had been coming each day.
He stood uncertainly, intertwining his fingers, and seemed on the point of
retreating. But he had come, and that was a great step in advance.

âI think it is my front name,â he said, as if that were the purpose of his
call.

âOh, yes,â said I. âTasso. So now Iâll call you Tasso.â

âIf it thunders will you come and stay with me?â he asked.

âIndeed I will,â said I, âbut itâs not going to thunder and tomorrow you and
I are going to take a hike together.â

III

Tells of my ramble with the Gray Meteor and of his singular
conduct, and of a discovery which I made.

I have seen soldiers suffering from shell shock led across the boulevard in
Paris, held by the hand like children. I have seen one, a great, strapping
fellow, guided to his seat in a restaurant. I have seen one stand upon the
street wringing his hands and sobbing because he did not know which way to go.
And no one of these unfortunates that I have ever seen would have ventured out
alone upon the most trifling errand. Panic fear of themselves is their most
distressing and conspicuous symptom.

Yet here was one of them whose last vestige of stamina seemed to have
forsaken him, but who had yet penetrated into these rugged mountain heights. It
was not so much the distance from France, as the endless up-and-down distances
and winding ways of those Alpine fastnesses which made the thing seem
impossible. Apparently he had a half forgotten smattering of some of the
primitive outdoor arts and I had won his confidence and aroused some hope and
interest in him by promising him a âhike.â But he was no more able to reach
this sequestered spot unaided than a baby in arms.

Who, then, had aided him?

Try as I would, I could not persuade him to remain over night at my little
inn, the fear of any noise seeming constantly with him, and I let him go,
realizing with regret that perhaps he was as well off in his solitude with only
the softer voices of nature about him.

But in the morning I was early at his retreat, with high hopes of the little
excursion which awaited us. For I had thought that a quiet ramble in those
unfrequented places would be a balm and solace to his poor nerves and wavering
mind. Little did I dream what that ramble would reveal.

Our path took us through a forest thick with pines of such magnificence as I
had never before seen, one as much like another as the pillars of a collonade,
and for which this Jura range is famous. I have it from my host that after
rainy weather the pungent odor from these pines is actually intoxicating and
that wayfarers have been known to slumber under its fragrant influence for
several days. I think I shall never again smell the spirit-rousing pungence of
a Christmas tree without recalling our memorable ramble in that dim cathedral
of the Jura Mountains.

I noticed that the sounds of nature had no such distressing effect upon my
companion as did the ruder clamor of human clap-trap, and that he was more at
ease in these majestic scenes. Perhaps kind nature, that great physician who
asks no fee, had pointed out his solitary cave to him, after the thunderous
tumult of the warâI do not know. But in any event he seemed more at ease than
I had yet seen him. And I perceived clearly enough then
that he was not insaneâonly that he had lost his grip.

He seemed to take an interest in everything about us and surprised me with
the knowledge which he showed of nature and her little oddities. Once he picked
up a twig saying that it had grown on the north side of a tree, and again a
scrap of rock which he said was sandstone. âTheyâre all sandstone, these
mountains,â he said, or rather asked, as if he were not quite sure of himself
and afraid that I would contradict him.

âYes,â I said. âI guess theyâre mostly sandstone,â though, to tell you the
truth, they might have been soapstone for all I knew.

Not once did he speak of the war and when I cautiously mentioned it in a
casual way he paid no attention. It seemed that he had forgotten all about
itâblessed lapse of memory, I thought.

Well, after a while we came upon rough country, like a miniature chain of
mountains up there amid those mighty peaks. Here were rocky hollows and no end
of little caves and glensâsuch picturesqueness as I had never seen. They say
these caves are filled with the bones of extinct animals and one bleached relic
I picked up. But my companion told me that it was only wood. âSee,â he said
smiling, âit has a grain.â

I think it was the first instance of a genuine smile that I had seen upon
his wan countenance.

Presently he kneeled down and examined some mossy earth, and straightway, to
my regret, he became greatly excited. We were in a sort of little canon which
extended some hundred yards or so and petered out in an area of fairly level
forest land where the trees grew sparsely in a rocky soil.

âWhat is it?â I asked, a bit anxiously.

âSee?â he said, standing and placing his heel in the moss. âSee?â

âYou mean itâs a footprint?â I asked.

âSee?â he asked nervously, almost in suspense, as if dreading my reply.

âSurely,â said I; âI dare say others have passed here. We are not so far
from the village.â

âItâs mine,â he said. âSee?â And ignoring me, he crept along, for all the
world as if he had lost something, examining the earth with great concern and
increasing satisfaction.

I had never before seen him so interested, and my own interest was aroused,
for if he had indeed passed here himself it might afford a clue to something or
otherâthough I did not know what.

âIt is only moss,â I said, âandâââ

âItâs wax-moss,â he interrupted me with the first sign of assurance he had
ever shown. âThey stay in wax-mossâSee?â

He was now so engrossed with his quest that I could but watch and follow
him.

âHave you been here before?â I queried. He gave no heed, but hurried along
through the gully until, having gone a hundred feet or more, his will power
seemed to collapse and he waited for me, wringing his hands distressingly.

âWhat is it?â I said.

âItâs over there,â he answered, clutching me in evident terror.

âWell, weâll go and see it,â I answered cheerily, and we moved along, he
still clutching me as if afraid that I would desert him.

It was curious to see how the one or two footprints he had found aroused him
to a flight of energy which petered out as quickly and left him helpless and
agitated. I could not for the life of me imagine why those footprints should
have interested him so and sent him loping along the gully. He found no others,
but apparently the sight of those two or three produced a glimmer of memory in
him. Evidently he had been here before, and was wishful to retrace his former
path but lacked the will and courage to do so.

âI know where it is,â he said, wringing his hands. âI know now. Will you go
with me?â

His look was so imploring and his voice so full of a kind of panic fear that
I was persuaded there was something he wished to show me but dared not. His
will seemed to tipple like a seesaw between resolution and irresolution, and he
fell into the old habit of starting and clutching me at every sound.

âCome,â I said, âIâll go with you.â

I cannot describe the eager terror in his eyes, the trembling of his hands
as he clutched my arm, and the irresolute pauses which he made as he passed
along through the gully. Finally he seemed about to clamber out of the rocky
depression, hesitated, and broke down utterly, sobbing like a child.

âLookâthereâ,â he at last managed to gasp âYouâgoâand see.â And he gulped
and tightened his grasp in panic fright.

I looked across a mass of piled up rock and saw, some distance away, a large
object which seemed to stir as I watched it.

âThatâs it,â he said.

âAll right,â said I. âYou stay here, sit down on that stone and Iâll go and
see.â

He sat down, twirling the cord around his neck and watching me eagerly. As I
clambered up the low embankment, he started at the slight noise I made.

Picking my way among the boulders I approached the object, until, a few feet
from it, I paused and looked at it aghast. It was the wreck of a German
observation balloon. The gas was entirely gone from its great bag which lay
plastered down upon the rocks, and its formerly glass-enclosed car was in
complete ruin. I think it must have blown across those rocks for some distance
to have been so shattered.

But all the details of its wreck and dilapidation were as nothing to me when
I saw certain markings on the broken side of its car. There were two black
crosses side by side, with the German Imperial coat of arms between them.

The balloon with the two black crosses was known far and wide upon the west
front. It was the little palace, the lofty headquarters of an arch demon of
aerial frightfulness, who was the peering eye and minion of his murderous
superiors. I had talked with those who knew and catered to this sneaking beast,
and cowered before his swaggering arroganceâa poor little French girl and her
crippled father. He it was who had come from America to help the Fatherland;
who âknew about ze ships, when zey will goâ; whose two black crosses were a
mark of special honor and distinction!

Well, by the grace of Heaven, he was a mystery no longer. Poor, dribbling,
guilt-haunted wretchâhe had brought me face to face with the wrecked
instrument of his crimes.

I make no excuse for what I didâI am only human. I strode back to where the
stricken creature sat, twirling and twisting the cord about his neck. I was
trembling and my words came short and spasmodic, but whether from amazement or
rage I do not know now. I only know that he cowered before me like a reed blown
in the blastâit stings me to the heart as I think of it now.

âSo you have got your reward,â I said. âBe sure that God knows how to punish
such as you! I have seen your evil eye put out and there,
there
it lies,
over among those rocks. You must come back to it, eh? Like a murderer to its
victim!â

His breath came in great, panting gulps, he wrung and twisted his hands, and
his lookâoh, it will haunt me forever.

âI know who you are now! You will tell a little French girl that Americans
are murderers and hang their people to lamp-posts! America, where you lived
yourself and made your livingââ Now youâve got your reward! I have seen the
house that you defiled with your presenceâthe little cottage of a French
peasant! I donât know how many ships lie at the bottom of the ocean on account
of you, you sneaking, lying blackguard! But youâve got your reward. Those
innocent women and babies at the bottom of the sea are better off than youâwith
your peering eye put out and your senses drivelling. No wonder youâre afraid!
Probably the thunder of some Yankee cannon knocked your brain endways. The most
bestial German is a saint compared with youâMonsieur le Capitaine!â I sneered.
âNo, keep away from me!â For he held his hands toward me with a pitiful
gesture. âIâll not interfere with the decree of God. You can wander in these
mountains like a lost soul for all I careâdrivelling about poor murdered
Indians in America. If youâve forgotten your name, Iâll tell it to you. Itâs
Toby! I know of one other almost as bad as you areâSlade his name isâwho would
sell his country. Over there at that balloon is a piece of broken cableâgo and
hang yourself with itâif youâve got the nerve!â

And with that I marched away. Scarcely had I gone ten paces when his voice
rose in a scream to wake the Heavens. Again and again he screeched in an
anguish of despair and his piercing cries echoed from those lonely mountains
until they died away in pitiable sobs.

But I never so much as turned to look at him.

IV

Tells how I went forth into the night, and of my quest, and of my
singular state of mind.

âSo that is the infamous Captain Toby,â I thought, as I started back to the
inn, all agog over this discovery. âMonsieur le Capitaine, the sky spy,
accessory to a thousand murders! Another of Dennheimerâs recruits. Well, he has
his reward.â He would have fared worse, I consoled myself, if he had fallen
within the allied lines.

But already (though I would not acknowledge it) I had begun to feel the
first pangs of regret, not because I had denounced him, but because I had not
at least brought him back and left him in his cave where I had found him. For
if, indeed, I wished to leave his punishment to Providence, it would have
seemed only fair to return him to the spot where Providence had placed him when
I intervened.

I began to wonder how he had drifted so far and what were the circumstances
of his tragic flight. The broken cable told much, but what was the experience
which had left him with a tottering, broken willâthe victim of hideous fear and
haunting guilt? He had evidently a hazy recollection of landing in the
darkness, for he had asked me, in his eager, furtive way, if

David Balfour
had reached his destination at night.

I believed that his condition had been worseâwas perhaps getting better
when I first saw him. And I pictured his being carried through the darkness, a
crazed victim locked in his little car, storm-tossed perhaps, borne over those
majestic peaks, beating against his glass enclosure in crying fright, and at
last dragged across rough canons and over rocks and crawling out of the
wreckage in the blackness of night in this unknown country. I pictured him
wandering aimlessly among the hills and glens, in storm and tempest perhaps,
and finally finding refuge in his lone cave.

Before I had reached the inn I turned and retraced my steps to the scene of
our parting, but he was gone. I was siezed with remorse. The night was coming
on, and the thought of the poor wretch stricken anew by the shock of my tirade,
roaming aimlessly among those caverns, went to my heart.

This, I thought, was not the way Uncle Sam treated his enemy prisoners. I
went back to his cave hoping that I might find him there, but there was no sign
of him, and I turned back toward the inn remorsefully.

And now I did not spare myself. I recalled my effort to find excuse, or at
least a plausible explanation, for Tom Sladeâs truckling to the enemy, because
he was my young friendâs pal and lived in my own home town. I recalled my
agreeable pastime of recounting the episodes of his loyal service, and of how I
had put into the background that dark secret of the Scuppers. But for this
poor, half demented creature, who was punished already, I had had nothing but
heartless contempt and loathing. I would have thought shame to dishonor that
grave in Pevy. Yet here was I dishonoring the deadâfor was not this wretched
thing dead in a way?

I cannot tell you of the pangs I suffered as the night drew on. Herr Twann,
who had shown little sympathy or interest in our unhappy neighbor, seemed like
a saint now compared to myself. A fine bungle I had made of my kind intent! I
have seen wounded soldiers handled pretty roughly, but never one with
genuine shell shock.

To my host and his good wife I said nothing of what I had learnedâmuch less
of what I had done, but all through the evening I nursed my remorse in
silence.

As luck would have it, the night blew up cold and stormy. There is a
keenness to the slightest breeze in these parts and I have wondered whether it
is because of the narrow valleys it passes through, causing, as one might say,
a perpetual draft. The rain comes in gusts.

Well, on this memorable night there was not so much as a star to be
seenâonly the tiny light away up on Ollon peak, which I always thought must be
a star. Some hermit monks lived there, I understood, and lonely enough it must
have been for them. Down in St. Craix we could see the lights, dimmed by the
misty thickness of the blown rain, disappear one after another as the good
peasant people went to their beds, and as I watched them from our tap-room
window, I felt that no human being should be abroad in those mountains on such
a night. Once there came a tap upon our door and I thought it might be that
poor distracted soul, but it was only Laff Turtman, the herdsman, for a warming
draught of kirschwasser. He was on his way down to Craix with his sheep, and I
could see them out in the path, making a kind of community of warmth by
crowding together. The blazing fire in our tap-room was cheerful that night and
we all sat about it.

At last I could stand it no longer and taking my hostâs oilskin cape and
hat from their peg, I announced that I was going to see if the Gray Meteor was
all right, that being the name they always called him by. It pleased me to
assume that he would be in his cave, and I would not entertain the thought that
he was not there. But he was nowhere about the place. Outside were the two
smooth sticks that he was wont to rub together with such childish confidence of
getting a spark from them, and it went to my heart to see them lying there. The
rain was streaming down the cliff above his cave and pouring over the opening
like a waterfall.

I was thoroughly alarmed now, but what to do I did not know. I cannot say I
had any sympathy for him more than any Christian would have for the lowest
wretch cast adrift on such a night. I was in two minds whether to go all the
way down into the village, but what could I do there? Awaken the good people
out of their slumbers?

It was intolerable to do nothing, and I ended by doing the only other thing
I could think of, and that was to pick my way through all that drenching rain
and darkness to the wreck of his balloon. Now that he had seen it again, I
suspected it would have a kind of fascination for him.

But he was not there and I was at my witsâ end. The wreck looked tragic and
uncanny enough in the night, the hollow, wrinkled bag moving to and fro, and
simulating the stirrings of some crouching thing among the rocks. I groped
about among the wreckage of the car and found a dented, rusted spyglass, which
had doubtless stolen many a secret from behind our lines, and a jack-knife, so
rusted that I could not open it. This I tookâI do not know why.

Suddenly through the rain I heard a sound near me and peering about I saw a
goggled head bobbing close by.

âWho is itâspeak,â I demanded, and I am afraid my voice was not quite
steady.

But there was no answer and approaching I found it to be only an airmanâs
helmet hanging from a hook in the broken moulding. Even as I felt of it I
started at a rustling sound beneath me, but I supposed it was only some small
creature of the mountains who had made the forlorn ruin its home.

I had no wish to linger there and started homeward, drenched and utterly
miserable. Nor will I deny that this weird spectacle in those rugged,
dark-enshrouded mountains, had made me the prey of shadowy forebodings and
uncanny fancies. I, too, must start at every little sound and shudder with a
sort of vague apprehension. I cannot describe it any better than to say that I
felt as if something dreadful were going to happen. I thought how the war had
pushed its long, bloody tentacles out to the farthest corner of the
worldâcausing murder in some tropic village, suicide in the ice-bound
northâhorror and destruction everywhere. And it was here upon these neutral
Alpine hills, this war, stalking in the form of one distraught and guilty soul,
who had been cast up here with all his crimes upon his head. âOne cannot get
away from it,â I said.

I felt it, I knew itâthat something, I knew not what, but something, was
going to happen.

V

Tells of my experience in the night, and brings my formal
narrative to a close.

The household was gone to bed when I reached the little inn, but the fire
had been left burning for me, and I hung my dripping garments before it and
sank down on the massive settle. The candle was burning out but the blaze in
the big fireplace diffused its grateful warmth and gave out a dim, fitful
brightness. I remember how it checkered up the rough wainscot and low-raftered
ceiling so that my eye was ever and again caught by moving figures which were
nothing but the reflection of the dancing blaze. Outside the blown rain beat
against the little windows in intermittent splashes, which seemed to heighten
the sense of comfort and security within.

But I took small comfort in the dim warmth, for I was sick at heartâsick with
horror and disgust at the renewed memory of that creatureâs
deedsâtreasonâcowardly murderâbut most of all at myself. I tried to console
myself with the reflection that it was better so, that after all I had been
giving aid and comfort to the enemy. We do not get much consolation from the
mental comforts which we manufacture for ourselves, and the result of all this
idle thinking was just to take me back home to Bridgeboro and to conjure up
thoughts of my young friend, Roy Blakeley.
Do a good turn daily
, he had
said. I could see him as he said it!
Two on Sundays and holidays. Get a
turning lathe and turn out good turns. Keep turning.
I smiled at the
recollection of all his nonsense.... A fine kind of a good turn I
had done!

So I fell to thinking, or rather my mind wandered aimlessly back to that day
when Roy and I had stood outside the Bridgeboro station, reading the account of
Tom Sladeâs last exploit. I recalled the little catch in his voice when he
asked me if I was â
sure
it was really true,â and of how
he looked across the street at the window of Temple Camp office, where hung the
service flag with its single star. Then I thought of the grave in Pevy with its
little wooden cross marked with rough letteringâabsurdly German. I thought of
how, even to the last moment of our parting, when he handed up my grips to the
car platform, he clung staunchly to the hope that somehow his pal was yet
living.

âWell, at least,â I reflected cynically, âTom Slade had the decency to leave
a few untainted memorials of loyal service behind himâenough to make a story.â
And I thanked my stars that no hint of other things had escaped from my pen, in
that tale which I had written for Roy. That did not trouble my conscience at
all now. Might it not go down as a good turn? And the girl, whoever she was,
she must never know either. Where ignorance was bliss, âtwas folly to be wise.
Why should I disgrace my own home town and bring shame upon this noble âgood
turnerâ and scout?

Then in my drowsy reverie (for the dying fire had cast its spell on me) I
thought of something Slade had said to Jeanne Grigouâthat you cannot disgrace
yourself alone. Queer he had not thought of that when he had fallen into the
web of the unspeakable Dennheimer. Why had he not thought of Bridgeboro
thenâlittle Bridgeboro which was first over the top with its loan quota. Had
not the Schmitt affair been quite enough for little Bridgeboro which had had
its name sprawled all over the New York papers on account of it?

Well, in any event, there should be no more of this business....

RoyâRoyâhe would get over the shock of death, I mused. Nature provides for
that. But the shock of disgrace.... That was a pretty good story,
tooâstopping just short of.... Yes, it was a pretty good story. And
I would give it to Roy and say, âHereâs a good turn I have turned out for you.â
And then....

Whew! How the rain beat against the window! The rattling of the loose
frame interrupted my reverie so that I got up and stretched myself and went
over and forced a folded scrap of paper between it and the jamb.

âIâll be thankful,â I half yawned as I resumed my seat before the fire, âif
this thing is over soon.â I donât know whether I was thinking of the storm or
the war.

But the rattling did not cease. Oh, it was the door and not the window. So I
got up againâthen stood stark still, feeling a tremor all over me. Not an inch
could I move, only stand there, every nerve on edge, listening. If I had been
certain of a tapping on that door I would have experienced no suspense, for
suspense is tense uncertainty, and I knew not whether it was a tapping or
not.

I thought it was not, and to make sure I went over, unbarred the heavy door
and threw it open.

Never while I live shall I forget that sight. He stood there, dripping,
trembling; and if there had ever been a touch of the ridiculous in his
appearance in that tattered, ill-fitting German coat, there was nothing but
pathos in it now; his clothes hung in shining wetness to his form so that I saw
with horror how gaunt and emaciated he was. He wore no hat and his blonde hair
was streaking down over his face and he gazed out from between those drooping
strands with such a pitiful look of appeal as I had never seen before.

HE STOOD THERE, DRIPPING, TREMBLING.

âYes,â I said roughly, âcome inâIâm glad youâve come. No, donât touch me,
but sit there by the fireâyouâre welcome. I was to blame. Iâm sorry.â It was
odd, perhaps, but even in my relief at seeing him and giving him shelter, a
little of my anger and resentment returned so that I was at an effort to
repress it. âDennheimer is worse than you, for he seduced you. Sit downâyou
neednât be afraid.â

I seated myself in the great chair before the fire, but he remained standing
with one hand upon its massive back. His sleeve was tight and clinging, like
a womanâs, which gave him a grotesque look and somehow went to my heart. So
standing, he spoke with a painful effort at composure as if his few words had
been contemplated and rehearsed. As he spoke, I thought I saw in his eyes a
kind of forced calmness as if he had at last groped his way to some peg to hang
his wits on.

âThat other name,â he said, âsay it.â

I was surprised that after his experience he did not clutch my arm, but
instead the chair and clung to it as if that were a part of his resolve. The
poor, heroic effort at self-control was touching and I answered in a kinder
tone.

âOther name? There isnât any other name. I want you to sit close to the fire
and take off your coat and shoes; then weâll talk. See, Iâll put a fresh log
on.â

âSay that name,â he repeated, and already I could see his will power
tottering. It had been strong enough for a request but not for continued
insistence.

âI think you must remember Dennheimer,â I said, âand I know of

no
other name. Of course, you knew Dennheimer.â

He shook his head.

âWell,â I persisted, âit is more important to get dry and warm. I wonder how
you found your way here in such a night.â

âI can find my way anywhere,â he said; âI
had
to
find my way to ask about the name.â

I was puzzled.

âYou mean your own nameâTasso?â I ventured.

âTwo traitors,â he said; âthe other one. You saidâyou saidâyou saidâ
I
was one.â

âIndeed,â I said, âI am not burdening my mind with the names of traitors and
if I named one it must have been in anger. As for you, Iâll not be your
judgeâso sit down. You are tired andâââ

âIâve known a night like this before,â he said, clutching the chair and gulping
in the labor of his effort to be calm and rational; âI am glad on account of
itâthe rainâbecauseâitâitâreminds me.
You
are a
coward
if you are
afraid of a stormâyouâareâscoutsâtheâtheyâââ and his voice trailed away.

âShh,â I said. âYou must be quiet I will tell you the other nameâââ

âYes,â he said eagerly.

âIt was a young fellow who lived in my town in America and came over here
and after a while he got mixed up with the Germans somehow. Slade was his
nameâTom Slade; and Iâm sorry I mentioned it before. Heâs dead nowâââ

âSay his name again,â he interrupted, trembling like a leaf.

âSladeâTom Slade.â

âTomassoânot Tasso,â he cried; â
that
is what he used to call me.â

I thought his wits were wandering now, so I spoke soothingly, telling him
again to sit down. But he clutched my arm and looked at me like a wild man.
There was a light in his eyes, too, which I had never seen before. And if he
lacked in will and had no power to speak connectedly, a certain fine abandon
came to him which took me by storm. I knew, of course, that his tirade was but
the reaction of his nervous strain and mental hallucinations, but some things
that he said puzzled and rather startled me.

âDo you knowâdo you know what heâI did,â he breathed. âYou think you can
buryâmeâbutâyou canât. IâIâll tell you what I didâI strangled himâlike that
(he clutched my throat). I threw him out of the car. Heâhe triedâto stab me
withâwith my own jack-knifeâhe tried to cut the ropeâbut I can go too quickâup
a ropeâanywayâtrailingâstalkingâyou see how I can come here when I must have
that name. That is
my
nameâit belongs to meâmeâit does.
Give it to meâorâor Iâitâs your town as much as mineâI kept it from
gettingâdisgraced youâre a coward if youâre a-scared of stormsâI rode a
stormâI didâand I tracked you hereâyou areâ
youâre
a
thiefâyou are! Give me my nameâTom SladeâI hunt forâthat. I trailed itâI am

Tomasso
!â

I removed his weakening fingers from my throat and, standing, stroked his
shoulders soothingly. Every part of him was shaking and he was breathing like a
dog. He had to toss his head back to gulp out his excitement and he kept
closing one eye in a nervous manner, most distressing to see.

âYou
must
be quiet,â I said, âand get your wet
clothes off. Shhâ Iâll give you your name (for I thought it best to humor him)
as soon as you do that. Hold up your armâso; so I can get your coat off. Now
sit down, quietly. There. Itâs because you are tiredâthatâs all. Donât think
about anything, just....â

But he would not sit down, only laid his head upon the back of the great
chair and sobbed like a baby. I made no effort to dissuade him for I knew
that was just the effect of his exhausting tirade. I assumed, of
course, that he had been talking nonsense....

Copy of cable despatch which I sent to Roy Blakeley on the fourth day
following the incidents related in the last chapter.

âTom Slade alive sick will recover am writing.â

Following is my last letter to Roy Blakeley, written at the little inn of
Hans Twann above St. Craix village in Switzerland:

Dear Roy:

I sent you a cable via Paris and Rouen. Tom Slade is alive and with me here
in Switzerland. I waited four days before sending the cable in order that there
might be no shadow of uncertainty about the facts, which seemed hardly
believable. I think this will go through to you without much delay since the
armistice has been signed. But youâll probably not see us for several
months.

Tom is in care of the physician in Solothurn, the nearest town of any size,
and I am sure he is in good hands. He cannot leave here for several weeks,
however, and when he does we shall probably be delayed in France in connection
with getting his discharge or at least an extended furlough. I understand the
censorship is off, so this should come to you unopened but in any case keep the
whole business close until I return. I have already written a sketch of Tomâs
adventures for you but if there is no objection in any quarter I would like to
publish this whole extraordinary business, first and last.

I can hardly collect my own mind sufficiently to give you a straight account
of this amazing climax of Tomâs career, and I will not now tell you anything
contained in the several batches of story I mean to hand you. For you might as
well know the whole thing. Tom himself is in no condition to talk and
contradicts himself a great deal. But of the essential truth of what he tells
me there can be no doubt.

He is suffering from shock incident to the terrible experience he had and
this, I think, was aggravated by an injury to his head which he had previously
sustained.

In the neighborhood where this final experience of his occurred it is current
among the French peasants that the body of Slade fell from the clouds ten
minutes after his machine crashed to earth. I mentioned this supposed
superstition in the narrative which I shall give you, saying that such a thing
was manifestly impossible. It is a fact, however, that the victim fell ten
minutes after Tomâs machine descended.
But the victim was not Tom Slade.

Youâll hardly credit your senses when you read this, but the body which fell on
the rocky hillside was none other than that of Toby Schmitt, son of Adolph
Schmitt, the Bridgeboro grocer!

This unspeakable young scoundrel was in the German service and was the
moving spirit of their spy activities along a front of a hundred miles or more.
He was, in fact, the Captain Toby, or Monsieur le Capitaine, whom you shall
hear of in my narrative. Tom learned of this young traitorâs presence along the
front where he was on a secret mission in France and saw his photograph, which
he instantly recognized. He also learned the means by which he might identify
this arch villainâa double cross on the observation balloon which he often
used.

As nearly as I can gather from Tom (for he has to be handled carefully
still), the machine he was pursuing ascended into the clouds where, apparently,
its occupant was to seek orders from the balloon which was anchored there. But
of that, of course, he is not certain. He downed the enemy flier and was about
to shoot at the balloon when something happened to his machine gun. You may
imagine his chagrin at finding himself thus helpless, especially when he
noticed two black crosses on the balloonâs car.

I think he must have been in a frenzy of rage and desperate resolution to do
what he did. I am hoping that later he will be able to give a clearer account
of it, and the doctor assures me that he will be. I gather that he circled
about the cable of the balloon until finally in some way he was able to get
hold of it. That he should have sacrificed his plane and trusted himself to
this cable is an evidence of his towering resolve. The doctor thinks that even
at that time his mental state was perhaps not quite normal.

In any event, he knew what he was going to do. That he raised himself, hand
over hand, up that cable there seems no doubt. And he got into the car. He says
that âSchmittyâ which was the name he knew young Schmitt by in Bridgeboro, was
frantic with fear, and so he must have been to see this redoubtable creature
lifting himself up through that cloud-filled air and finally coming aboard like
a pirate over the side of a ship. Yet he dared not cut the rope for that would
be to release his balloon and put it at the mercy of the wind.

Before Tom was yet within the car, Schmitt, who was apparently unarmed, or
at least unprepared, reached down and secured the knife which Tom carried in
his pocket. Tom was powerless to prevent this since his hands were upon the
rope.
This is an American Boy Scout knife
and I myself
later found it in the wreck of the balloon.

Tom says Schmitt tried to stab him with it. Of the frightful combat which
took place in that car we can only imagine the details. Tom himself goes to
pieces whenever he tries to talk about it. It was a case of one or the
otherâthere seems little doubt of that. And in the end Schmitt either fell or
was thrown out of the car. He must have been clutching at Tomâs neck as he fell
for he tore away the cord on which hung Tomâs Scout cross and identification
disk. These things were later picked up by the Germans who removed Schmittâs
body. Schmitt had a watch bearing the initials of his name, T. S., and to this
was fastened a wallet containing some of his treasonable papers. He had also
been corresponding with some girl in Bridgeboro and part of one of her letters,
together with a photograph, were found in the wallet.

All of these matters you shall find in the story which I hope soon to give
you and the circumstances attending the discovery of these things and my own
connection with them, will surprise you greatly.

I shall write no more now, for indeed I find it hard to set these things
down. Tom is getting better each day, he talks of you very much, and looks
forward to the day when he can be a scoutmaster. All through the days of his
sorrowful weakness and distraction the war has been a thing forgotten, and it
is hard to arouse in him memories of those last days of his military career.
But of scouting and of you he thinks continually and never tires of talking.
And I always call him Tomasso because, he says, it reminds him of you.

POSTSCRIPTâWRITTEN AFTER MY RETURN TO AMERICA

I shall not prolong this narrative with an account of our return through
France, though it is quite likely that I may, at another time, detail one or
two of the rather surprising adventures which we encountered on that remarkable
journey. For what seemed to me good and sufficient reasons, our progress was
made as surreptitiously as possible, it being my intention to keep the whole
business quiet until we should report at Chalons which was where Tom had been
stationed.

But, as you probably know, if you have seen any of those misleading news
items, we were arrested at Langres. Here our pleasant hike through the hills,
which I had counted upon to restore Tomâs mental repose, was rudely brought to
an end by the preposterous charge that I was assisting a deserter. The matter
was straightened out in an hour, of course, and is too ridiculous to dwell
upon. Even the army medical men, who should have known better, smiled
annoyingly when I stated, what was the plain truth, that it had simply been my
intention to afford Tom a few days of the old woods life which he loved before
presenting him to the authorities. And I have to thank his own irrational
stubbornness and crying rebellion, that he was not taken from me
altogether.

The incident is of no consequence, but I think you must already have
discovered that Tomâs memories of scouting, even when he was at his worst,
formed the one link which bound his fitful and disordered mind to former days.
Indeed, it was by this means that I began the task of nursing and diverting
him. The merest mention of a camp fire or casual reference to a trail found
always a ready response and I have learned myself to love Nature and all her
beneficent influences and soothing voices, for the knowledge of how she dwelt
constantly in the poor brain which could hold naught else.

It remains only to say that the task which I began has been triumphantly
completed by a keen-eyed old man who presides over Temple Camp in the
CatskillsâUncle Jeb, the boys call him. And if anyone in this war-torn world
could bring peace and poise to a distracted soul, Jeb Rushmore is that man.

And this brings me to my final task of gathering up the few loose threads of
my tale, a thing which I could not do save for Tomâs complete recovery.
Straightway upon our return to Bridgeboro, Mr. Ellsworth, that indefatigable
scoutmaster, took him up to Temple Camp, where he and Uncle Jeb are now busy
getting the big camp ready for the influx of scouts which begins about
June.

Roy, Mr. Ellsworth and I lost no time in discussing the proposition of
publishing this whole story, and there seemed but one obstacle to our doing so.
This was Margie Clayton, as sweet and patriotic a girl as ever lived, and what
good end could be served by proclaiming to the world that the young fellow whom
she had liked and trusted was a sneak and a traitor? Evidently she had cared
for young Schmittâthere is no accounting for tastes, and girls are funny
things. It was Roy, bully scout that he is, who put the clincher upon this
discussion by reminding us of some rule or other that a scout must be kind
and chivalrous.

And it was Miss Margie herself who took the clincher off. How she learned
the truth about Schmitt I have never discovered, but she made known in very
unmistakable terms that the fate of the whole Schmitt family was nothing to her
and that she was very sorry she had ever wasted a good photograph and a good
sheet of notepaper on such a creature. As for the photograph, it was not
exactly wasted for I returned it to her, and the last time I saw it was during
one of my visits to Temple Camp where it hung in a birchbark frame in Tomâs
cabin. I did not ask him how it got there.

So, the way being clear, we went ahead with our publishing enterprise and I
will conclude with one or two scraps of information which I have lately had
from Tom. One is in answer to the question of how the cable of the balloon was
broken. He thinks now that he must have cut this himself in savage desperation,
fearing that Toby Schmitt would return after falling from the car. If, indeed,
he did such a thing he must, of course, have been stark mad, and it is awful to
think of him, the prey of such maniac fury, being carried, a lone prisoner in
that little car, through clouds and darkness, who shall say how high, and for
how long, and finally cast like a shipwrecked mariner upon those lonely
mountains.

The harrowing story of that awful night can only be imagined, and perhaps it
is better so. No doubt, it is one of Godâs mercies that Tom should never recall
all that happened in that insane combat among the clouds, and in the frightful
journey which followed. He believes that he was in the air through another day,
but I think that unlikely unless, indeed, the fugitive balloon was born hither
and yon upon the changing winds before landing. All he knows is that he crawled
out from under that tangled wreckage in the darkness of night.

One or two trifling details he remembers more closely. I asked him how Toby
Schmitt happened to wear an American uniform and he said that evidently it was
the custom of that unspeakable creature to wear not only the American, but the
French and British uniforms, as occasion and the work in hand suggested. It was
the sight of Schmitt in Uncle Samâs outfit which enraged Tom to the point of
uncontrollable fury, but whether this was one of the causes or just a result of
his nervous state I cannot say. He tells me that in Schmittâs room in the
Grigou cottage there was the uniform of an English lieutenant, and the jacket
of an American Y. M. C. A. worker.

But enough of Schmitt; my pen rebels at the task of recalling his villainy.
As for the tattered German coat which Tom wore, he supposes that he found it in
the car. He says that his own coat was torn away by Schmitt in the struggle and
no doubt this was so, since we know that the wretch also wrenched away the cord
bearing his scout badge and identification disk.

There is only one more question and neither Tom nor myself could have any
answer for it. It is whether the Germans really believed that they had
discovered Slade, when in fact the body was that of their own man. Very likely
they really thought it was Slade for, of course, Schmitt could not have been
known to every subordinate in the German service, and doubtless he was
disfigured beyond identification as the result of his tragic fall. Where his
own mark of identification was, I have no guess, though perhaps, being a spy,
he wore none.

It is a matter of rueful memory with me that I should have reverently laid a
âtribute from our Bridgeboro scoutsâ upon the grave of that young scoundrel.
But perhaps a better spirit of Christian charity should incline me to cherish
no such angry regrets and I will not begrudge him the few flowers which I left
there as a token of the far-off town where he was born.

Indeed, I am not of a mood for unavailing bitterness for the cruel war is
over and the springtime is come and the flowers are coming forth and the birds
are singing in the trees as if to lure oneâs thoughts away from the horrid
nightmare. And last Saturday Roy and I made the trip up to Temple Camp to see
old Uncle Jeb and visit Tom in his retreat among those silent, lonely
hills.

Not a soul was thereabout as we rowed across the lake to the camp shore, and
the cabins and pavilion stood reflected in the black water and all the
surrounding woods seemed permeated with a solemn stillness. It was at the dayâs
end and the frogs were sending up their harsh croakings out of the marshy
placesâthose discordant voices which accord so fittingly with the quiet and the
dusk.

âWhen the frogs begin croaking,â said Roy, âthen you know that pretty soon
the scouts will begin coming.â

We found Uncle Jeb smoking his pipe under the lean-to of the boarded-up
cooking shack looking for all the world as if he were waiting for some rattling
old stage-coach which he was to pilot across the scorching western plain. There
was peace in his keen gray eyes and a refreshing whiff of the prairies in his
brown, furrowed skin and drooping, gray moustache.

âWaiting for the boys to come, Uncle Jeb?â I asked, after the greeting.

âTheyâll be cominâ purty quick naow, I reckin,â he drawled.

âFind it lonesome here?â

ââTainât never lonesome,â he said, âbut I like to see the youngsters
coming.â

âI suppose you know that Roy and I together are going to write some stories
about Temple Camp,â I ventured, as a pleasantry.

He looked at Roy with a humorous twinkle in his eye.

âAnd weâre going to put you in, Uncle Jeb,â said Roy.

âTharâs a youngster over yonder would fit into a story-book,â Uncle Jeb
drawled, âkind of a char-ac-ter, as you might say. Lives over thar through the
woods whar you see the smoke goinâ.â

He told us we would probably find Tom over that way for he had gone after
milk. So we took our way along the woods path, which was filled with memories
for Roy, until we came to a road with open country beyond, which, being private
land, he had never crossed before. Perhaps a hundred yards or so distant stood
an old white farmhouse with the familiar paraphernalia of barnyard and
adjacent outbuildings, making, I thought, a pleasant scene of old-fashioned
farm life.

As we followed the cowpath across the fields we became aware of two figures
sitting on a rail fence, and I waved my hand to Tom, who answered with a cheery
greeting to us both. It was good to see him looking so hale and ruddy.

But it was in a kind of trance that I saw him lower himself from the fence
to come and meet us. For a second I stood gaping, then grasped Royâs arm in
speechless amazement. For there before me, swinging his legs from the fence,
was Archibald Archer!

Yes, it was none other than Archibald Archer as large as life, larger, in
fact, with his freckled face lighted up so that he was just one enormous grin;
Archibald Archer, home from the wars, and
once more enthroned among his favorite apple
trees which ere long must pay him their luscious
tribute. His feet were quite bare, he wore
trousers of gaudy bed tick with suspenders brazenly
conspicuous, and a straw hat as big as a
parachute.

âWellâIâm flabbergasted!â I managed to gasp
as I took his proffered hand; âI knew your home
was near Temple Camp, but I didnât know how
near.â

âIâm mustered out,â he informed me.

âI think I like you even better in your ancestral
domains,â I said, shaking his hand with right
good will, âand I congratulate you that you are
back in your orchards once more. I might have
known that it would take more than a world war
to kill
you
. Tell me, how is the souvenir business?

âI got some mustarrd gas in a vinegarr jarr,â
he said. âWant to see it?â

âThank you,â I answered, âbut I have had
enough gas for one war. I think you are yourself
quite enough of a souvenir for me. I shall not
lose track of you again. Roy and I intend to put
you where we can always have you handy.â And
I winked at my young literary partner.

âI got a piece of wirre from a wirreless, too,â
Archer persisted, as if his store was inexhaustible.

The doubtful nature of this last-mentioned memento
gave me an uncomfortable feeling that I
was being made fun of, so I retorted with severe
sarcasm, âI do not care for that, but if you have
a ring or two from the bell of Rheims Cathedral
I might be willing to accept it.â

âIf you want to see the belles,â he said, âcome
to the barrn dance on Saturrday night.â

It was useless trying to down him.

âAnd how are all your friends on the other
side?â I inquired, venturing upon a new tack.
âSir Douglas Haig and Papa Clemenceau? I
hope they are quite well.â

âPretty smarrt,â he answered, âbut they
couldnât come home with me on account of being
busy.â

âToo bad,â said I; âand General Pershing and
your old college chum, Marshal Fochâhow are
they?â

âFine and dandy. They sent theirr kind regarrds
to you.â

âTheir kind what?â said Tom in that sober
way of his.

âRegarrrrds!â repeated Archer.

âOnce more,â said Tom.

But for answer Archer toppled him off the fence, where he had reseated
himself, to the amusement of Roy, who sat down on the ground, drew his knees
up, clasped his hands about them, and laughed so that he shook.

âHumpty Dumpty Tomasso,â he said.

And, do you know, I think that right there, with Roy Blakeley laughing his
merry laugh and the famous, patent-applied-for scout smile spread all over his
roguish face, is the place to end this rambling story. For in that laugh, as in
the spring breeze, there is promise. And if you will but hold your hand to your
ear, scout fashion, and fancy that you can hear his joyous uproar, you may take
it as a reminder that the bloody warpath has, after all, brought us back to the
solemn, friendly trees and the placid lake of the beloved camp once more, and
that we are parting but to meet again in the scoutsâ own season, which is the
good old summertime.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

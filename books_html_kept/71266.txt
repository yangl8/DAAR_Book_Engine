Introduction.

Several independent printing presses were established
in England before the close of the fifteenth century;
and from them issued numerous books which are
invaluable to all students of antiquity from the light
they throw upon the social habits and literary
progress of our nation. Of these it may safely be said that not one
exceeds in interest that work of an unknown typographer, which is
here presented in facsimile, and which, from the town in which it
was compiled, as well as printed, is known to all bibliographers as
âThe Book of St. Albans.â This work has always been a favourite,
partly because our feelings are appealed to in favour of the writer
who for centuries has taken rank as Englandâs earliest poetess, and
is still, in all our Biographical Dictionaries, reckoned among ânoble
authors;â and partly because we love mysteries, and a mystery has
always enshrouded the nameless printer. The subjects, too, so
curiously alliterativeâHawking, Hunting, and Heraldry, have an
enticing and antique flavour about them, being just those with
which, at that period, every man claiming to be âgentleâ was
expected to be familiar; while ignorance of their laws and language
was to confess himself a âchurl.â

6
As to the language and orthography of the book, it is a never-failing
source of interest, being quite different from any other
printed work of the fifteenth century, except the St. Albansâ
Chronicle from the same press. Among bibliographers it ranks as
â
rarissimus
,â the known copies being so few that they might probably
be counted on the fingers of one hand.

Looking at the book, then, all round, it will be a convenient
plan to consider these subjects separately, and to treat the volume
in its four aspects of Authorship, Typography and Bibliography,
Subject-matter, and Philology.

CHAPTER I.

Authorship.

Historians and Biographers, together with Librarians
and Booksellers, have a natural antipathy to
anonymous books; and, wherever they can, are willing
to accept the smallest amount of evidence as proof
of paternity. It saves much trouble and avoids
numerous errors in cataloguing, when a recognised name can be
associated with an anonymous work. From this tendency a bad habit
has arisen of attributing to particular writers books concerning which
the evidence of authorship is doubtful, if not altogether untrustworthy.

In this very book we have a striking instance of such erroneous
attribution. The three treatises, of which the book is made up, are
quite distinct, and to a portion only of one of these is there any
authorâs name attached. Yet that name, âDam Julyans Barnes,â
altered by degrees to âDame Juliana Berners,â is now universally
received as the name of the authoress of the whole volume. With
even less show of reason she is credited with the authorship of
a âTreatise on Fishingâ for which there is not the shadow of evidence,
that treatise having been added ten years later by Wynken de Worde,
who, when reprinting the Book of St. Albans, thought that the subject
of Fishing would complete the work as a Gentlemanâs Vade Mecum.

There are really four distinct tractates in the Book of St. Albans,
although the two last being on Heraldry are generally counted as one.

8
The first is on Hawking; to this no name of the author is
attached, but it has a prologue which no one acquainted with the
other writings of the printer can doubt to be his. Of this we shall
have more to say anon.

The second tractate is on Hunting: it is specially associated
with the name of Dame Juliana Berners, and will require a more
extended elucidation than the others.

Here the evidence of authorship is as good as for most pieces
of fifteenth-century productionâa period at which literary rights
did not exist, and when the scribe, if at all acquainted with the
subject upon which the book he was copying treated, did not scruple
to interpolate his own ideas, and that without any egotistical vanity,
but merely from a feeling that all books being written for the good
of men, and not from vanity in the author, it was a duty to
improve them where possible. But as improvement mostly meant
the addition of something on the same subject taken from another
manuscript, we have the constant occurrence of one MS. being a
compilation of two or three others, and yet appearing under the
name of the last compiler.

In this treatise on Hunting we have the express statement at
the end of the twenty-fourth pageââExplicit Dam Julyans Barnes.â
This might certainly apply to the transcription only, but, when taken
with Wynken de Wordeâs version, the probability is, that the lady
compiled as well as wrote it. In the reprint by Wynken de Worde,
only ten years later than the original, he varies the colophon thus:ââÂ¶
Explicit dame Julyans Bernes doctryne in her boke of huntynge,â
the whole reprint ending âEnprynted at westmestre by Wynkyn the
Worde the yere of thyncarnacÅn of our lorde. M . CCCC . lxxxxvj.â
So that he, a contemporary, evidently believed her to be the authoress.
Later authorities attributed the whole book to her pen, but as
they were in possession of no more evidence than we now are, and
probably not so much, we should attach no weight to such statements,
which were founded simply on a vivid imagination.

9
But what is known of the lady who is admitted to have compiled
the twenty-four pages on Hunting? Who was Dame Julians
Barnes? Here, unless a sentimental and inventive sympathy be
employed to throw an artificial light upon the darkness, we are in
total ignorance. A biography of her has certainly been written,
and all our Dictionaries and EncyclopÃ¦dias devote a page or two
to her history, which, in 1810, under Haslewoodâs nurture, attained
its full development. Even so far back as 1549, or nearly a
century after her supposed death, the learned Bale, who wrote
an account of all our English celebrities, allows his gallantry to
bedeck her memory with garments fine. âFÅmina illustris!â he
exclaims, âcorporis et animi dotibus abundans ac forma elegantia
spectabilisâ (An illustrious lady! abundantly gifted, both in body
and mind, and charming in the elegance of her mien). Considering
that the name of the lady is the whole of the text upon which
Bale had to build, this is by no means a bad specimen of imaginative
biography, and became a good foundation for future commentators.
The story, however, fared rather badly at first; for Holinshed,
in 1577, while echoing Bale very exactly, is made, by a curious
error of the printer, who mistook the letters
rn
for
m
, to call the
authoress Julyan Be
m
es; while Baker in his Chronicles, too careless
even to refer to the original text, adds another blunder to the
story, and, thinking that Julyan must be a manâs name, dubs the
authoress âa gentleman of excellent gifts, who wrote certain treatises
of Hawking and Hunting.â

Chauncy, in 1700 (History of Hertfordshire), restored her sex
to the lady, and then set to work upon making a family history
for her. His first discovery was that, being a âDame,â she was of
noble blood. Finding also that the family name of Lord Berners
was, in olden time, spelt occasionally Barnes, he soon supplied a
father for our authoress, in the person of Sir James Berners. And
so the game of making history went on merrily up to the time of
Joseph Haslewood, who, in 1810, reprinted Wynken de Wordeâs

10
edition of the Book of St. Albans, and supplied a full-blown
biography of the authoress, giving particulars of her birth and
education, the occupations of her youthful days, and a most imposing
pedigree. Let us quote Haslewoodâs own words: âJulyans, or
Juliana, Barnes, otherwise Berners, who has been generally designated
as the authoress of the present volume, is supposed to have been
born, towards the latter end of the fourteenth century, at Roding-Berners,
in the county of Essex. The received report is that she
was the daughter of Sir James Berners, whose son was created
Baron Berners, temp. Henry IV., and that she once held the
situation of Prioress of Sopwell Nunnery, in Hertfordshire.â He
then attributes to her the authorship of all four works in the Book
of St. Albans. The difficulty of accounting for a lady so placed
writing upon such subjects, is cleverly, if not satisfactorily settled
by assuming that she passed her teens at court, partaking of the
amusements of the field, and writing for her own use a commonplace
book on various subjects. Then retiring through disappointment
(doubtless a love affair) to a cloister, her rank raised her to
the position of prioress. There in her seclusion, writing amidst the
solitude of listless hours and vain regrets, she versified the general
rules of sport from her own pleasant recollection, and from the
diaries of her youthful happiness, which fortunately she had preserved.
If we remember the mania which seized all classes for diary-keeping
at the beginning of this century, when Haslewood wrote this, it will
deepen our sense of humour to note that he attributes private diary-keeping
to a young lady who lived
ante
1450.

But enough of such sham biography; let us return to facts.

The word âDameâ did not in the fifteenth century, as it does
now, imply any connection with a titled family, it meant simply
Mistress or Mrs. Chaucer speaks of Dame Partlet in this sense;
and had the Dame Julyans Barnes of the fifteenth century lived
now, she would have been just âMrs. Barnes.â

Similarity of name in history, like similarity of sound in philology

11
is a will-oâ-the-wisp which has led many a writer into a bog.
Allowing that Lord Bernersâ name was sometimes spelt Barnes,
is that sufficient reason for making our authoress a member of
his family? I think not.

That the greater portion of the book on Hunting was compiled
by Mistress Barnes, is probably correct,
[1]
and had she written
much more, and produced even an original work on the subject,
she would not have stood alone, even at that early period, as an
authoress. Crystine de Pisan, two of whose works were printed
by Caxton, was contemporary with Julians Barnes, and left not
only numerous original writings behind herâone of which was
upon the Art of Warâbut left her mark, and that no mean nor
ignoble one, upon the political course and moral development of
her countrymen. But Dame Julyansâ work upon Hunting is certainly
not original, as indeed very few works upon any subject were at
that period. This is evident from a glance at the text and the
grouping of the subjects. It begins with distinguishing the varieties
of beasts and their ages; the proper names by which to designate the
beasts, singly and together; on hunting and dressing a Roe, a Boar,
a Hare; of flaying; of the horns of a Roebuck; of the Hart; of the
seasons; of the Hare. Then follows, from another source, an interpolation
of a discourse between a Master of the Hunt and his man,
going over portions of the same ground again; and this ended, we
get back again to the original MS. and the dismemberment of various
beasts. All through, with the exception of the interpolated conversation,
the text is addressed to âMy deare childe.â Thus we readââDo
so, my child;â âThink what I say, my son;â âMy lief
childer;â âSay, child, where you go? my dame taught you so.â
Evidently that portion was originally written for a mother to use

12
as a school-book, by which her son would learn to read, and, at
the same time, become familiar with the terms of venery.

1
. Taking Berners and Barnes to be the same word, it is curious to noteâin connection
with the work attributed to Dame Juliana, viz., The Book of Huntingâthat the masters
of that sport employed men called
Berners
, to be ready with relays of horses and to feed
the hounds.â
See
Halliwellâs âDictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words.â

In the Bodleian Library is a small manuscript on the Terms
of the Chase, the beginning of which is:â

âMi dere sones, where ye fare, be frith or by fell,

Take good hede in his tyme how Tristram wol tell.â

This manuscript was probably copied by some youth as a school-exercise,
which would account for the following odd colophonââExplicit,
expliceat, ludere scriptor eat.â

Compare the above with the opening stanza of the verses we
attribute to Mistress Barnes:â

âWheresoever ye fare, by frith or by fell,
[2]

My dear child, take heed how Tristram doth you tell.â
[3]

2
. âBy frith or by fellâ = by forest or by plain; but see Halliwellâs Dictionary.

3
. Sir Tristram, the well-known knight of the Round Table, was a mighty hunter, and
the great authority upon all subjects connected with the chase. Popular belief attributed
to him the origin of all the special terms used in hunting, and his name was invoked to give
authority to any statement upon this subject, just as in a later century the arithmetical rules
of Cocker give rise to the popular phraseââAccording to Cocker.â

The rest of the Oxford MS. is in similar accord with the print,
but nowhere in it is there a word about Mistress Barnes.

The words âExplicit Dam Julyans Barnesâ have been considered
to prove that the lady was alive when the book was printed. If,
however, Sir James Berners were her father, of which there is no
evidence, she must have been close upon a hundred years old
in 1486, as he died in 1390. But this is importing a needless
difficulty into the theory, which is not rendered more probable
by making the authoress and printer contemporary.

It may here be as well to say a few words about Sopwell
Nunnery, over which, without a particle of evidence, our authoress
is supposed to have presided. Sopwell Nunnery, Hertfordshire,
was founded about 1140, under the rule of St. Benedict, and
subject to the Abbot of St. Albans, from which it was not far

13
distant. The rule of life among the inmates was very severe, and
at the first the nuns were enclosed under locks and bolts, made
additionally sure by the seal, on the door, of the Abbot for the
time being (Chauncyâs History, p. 466). How long this lasted,
and how the nuns liked it, history saith not; but, in 1338, a
re-organisation had become imperative, and the Abbot of St.
Albans, among other instructions, ordered that no nun should lodge
out of the house, and no guest within it (Newcome, p. 468).
There does not seem much scope left here for the Prioress to
take an active part in field sports, though a hundred and fifty years
later, which was about the period of our âDame,â many relaxations
of the strict rules may have become common. But, then, we have
apparently accurate lists of all the Prioresses of Sopwell in the
fifteenth century, and the name of Juliana Barnes does not appear
at all in them. The known dates are these:âIn 1416, Matilda de
Flamstede was Prioress. Four years before her death, which was in
1430, she was succeeded by Letitia Wyttenham. The next whose
name is known was Joan Chapell; the date of her appointment is
not recorded, but as she was set aside in 1480 on account of her
age, she had probably occupied the position for many years. In
1480, Elizabeth Webb succeeded Joan Chapell.

What is really known of the Dame is almost nothing, and may
be summed up in the following few words. She probably lived at
the beginning of the fifteenth century, and she possibly compiled from
existing MSS. some rhymes on Hunting.

There is still the authorship of the other parts of the book to
determine, and if similarity of wording and phraseology may be taken
as evidence, they were all from one pen.

At the end of the book on Heraldry the printer has put the
followingââHere endeth the book of Blasing of Arms translated and
compiled together at Seynt Albons.â Here we have the printerâs
own statement as to the origin of his text, and doubtless this, as well
as the treatise on Hawking, were made up or âcompiledâ from more

14
than one manuscript in French. Haslewood gives a list of such as are
in the British Museum, in several of which portions of the printed
work are contained. Works on Hunting and Hawking were not
uncommon in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and are still found
in all large collections of manuscripts. There were several in the
libraries of the Dukes of Burgundy in the fifteenth century, and many
are still extant in the national collections of England and France.

The other tractates in the volume have an origin very similar
to that of the Book of Hunting. The Book of Hawking is an evident
compilation from several manuscripts, which accounts perhaps for its
deficiency in arrangement and want of continuity. The Book of Coat
Armour also has two distinct sources in contemporary works, one of
which was the âDe Officio Militariâ of Nicholas Upton. From this
the schoolmaster copied Book IV. almost word for word, supplementing
it from âThe Book of the Lineage of Coat Armour,â as
stated already. The only other literary work which can be attributed
to our printer is the extensive compilation known as the St. Albansâ
Chronicle or the Fructus Temporum. But neither in the Chronicle,
where he simply combined two histories into one, nor in the Book of
St. Albans, which is also a compilation, does the schoolmaster show
any literary ability above the average of scholars of his period.

As specimens of the schoolmasterâs powers of composition we
annex the following, the originals of which can be seen in the ensuing
facsimile pages:â

Prologue to the Book of Hawking.

âIn so much that gentlemen and honest persons have great delight
in Hawking, and desire to have the manner to take hawks: and also
how and in what wise they should guide them ordinately: and to
know the gentle terms in communing of their hawks: and to understand
their sicknesses and infirmities, and to know medicines for them
according, and the many notable terms that be used in hawking

15
both of their hawks and of the fowls that their hawks shall slay.
Therefore this book following in a due form shows very knowledge
of such pleasure to gentlemen and persons disposed to see it.â

Prologue to Mistress Barnesâ Compilation on Hunting.

âLikewise, as in the Book of Hawking aforesaid are written and
noted the terms of pleasure belonging to gentlemen having delight
therein, in the same manner this book following showeth to such gentle
persons the manner of Hunting for all manner of beasts, whether they
be beasts of Venery, or of Chace, or Rascal. And also it showeth all
the terms convenient as well to the hounds as to the beasts aforesaid.
And in certain there be many diverse of them as it is declared in the
book following.â

Prologue to the Book of Coat Armour.

âHere in this book following is determined the lineage of Coat
Armours: and how gentlemen shall be known from ungentle men, and
how bondage began first in angel and after succeeded in man kind,
as it is here showed in process, both in the childer of Adam and also
of Noe, and how Noe divided the world in three parts to his three
sons. Also there be showed the nine colours in Arms figured by the
nine orders of Angels, and it is showed by the foresaid colours which
be worthy and which be royal; and of regalities which be noble and
which be excellent. And there be here the vertues of Chivalry, and
many other notable and famous things, to the pleasure of noble persons
shall be showed, as the works following witnesses, whosoever liketh to
see them and read them, which were too long now to rehearse. And
after these notable things aforesaid followeth the Blasing of all manner
Arms in Latin, French, and English.â

So wrote the schoolmaster. Let us now see what kind of book
this is typographically.

CHAPTER II.

Typography and Bibliography.

Old books must be loved, and their idiosyncrasies carefully
studied, before they will yield up
all
their treasures;
that done, the observant lover will obtain possession
of both soul and body; he may revel in the intellectual
feast provided by the author, or he may study the
material and mechanical features of the books as represented by the
peculiarities of paper and the habits and customs of the various
printers. Then, by grouping these as a botanist does his flowers,
according to their organisation into classes, orders, genera, and species,
he may extract from his volumes true replies to questions which
otherwise would remain hidden for ever. So true is the dictum, âThe
Mind it is which sees, and not the Eye alone.â

Many bibliophiles, however, of education and taste have been
positively blind when outside the circle of their own particular studies.
So it was with the Rev. Dr. MâNeille, a well-known critic and book-collector
of sixty years ago. When addressing Dr. Dibdin he wrote thus
of âThe Book of St. AlbansâââThis book is itself useless, and only
a
bon morceau
for the quizzical collector.â With such feelings
towards one of the most curious works which this country produced
during the infancy of the printing press, it was simply impossible that
the interest of its pages should be revealed to him; and however rich
in divinity and
editiones principes
of the classics the library of the

17
worthy doctor may have been, it is evident that our Book of St.
Albans could never have been aught but an alien on
his
book-shelves.

The works printed by William Caxton were almost without
exception in the English tongue, while the contemporary presses of
Oxford, St. Albans, and Machlinia were nearly all in Latin. Of the
eight books at present known to have been printed at St. Albans, the
only two in English were the âFructus Temporumâ and the work
under review. The âFructusâ or St. Albansâ Chronicle is the same
as that printed two years previously by Caxton, with the addition of
certain ecclesiastical events and Papal chronology, probably added by
the printer himself to please the monks.

The Book of St. Albansâ and the St. Albansâ Chronicle make a
class of themselves; but as it is impossible to understand their position
without a glance at the other works from the same press, we will give
a tabulated description of the whole eight.

But who was the printer? What was his name? Was he associated
with the great Abbey? and is there any internal or external evidence in
his works to connect him with any other printer or any other town?

The only notice we have of the printer is an accidental one by
Wynken de Worde, who, in reprinting the St. Albansâ Chronicle, says

18
in the colophon, âHere endith this present Chronicle ... compiled
in a book and also enprinted by our sometime Schoolmaster of St.
Alban.â He was a schoolmaster, then, and this will account for the
nature of his early works, all scholastic and all in Latin. Not till the
end of his typographical career did he realise the fact that the printing press,
instead of being the hobby of a few learned men, was the
educator of the people, the whole nation; and then he gave his countrymen
what they wantedâa history of their own country and a book
upon the whole (secular) duty of the gentleman, as then understood.

The name of the schoolmaster-printer is quite unknown. No
notice of him is found in the records of the Abbey, nor does he
appear in any contemporary document. Yet here, as in Mistress
Barnesâs case, imagination has come to the rescue and a legendary
name has been provided.

Finding that the Prologue to the Book of Hawking began with
the words, â
Insomuch
as gentle men and honest persons have great
delight in Hawking;â finding also that the St. Albanâs Chronicle
from the same press began thus: â
Insomuch
as it is necessary;â
and bearing in mind that certain old authors had veiled
their
names
in the first words of their works, Dr. Chauncy arrived at the sagacious
conclusion that the St. Albans printer wished to veil
his
name, which
really was âInsomuch.â The joke, for it almost seems like one, does
not bear even the scrutiny which itself invites, for although the schoolmaster
uses the words in two other places, in neither case are they
at the beginning of a chapter.
[4]
It should be added that in this the
worthy historian of Hertfordshire only followed the lead of both
Bale and Pits.

4
. On sig.
a j
recto of âCote Armourâ is âInsomuch as all gentleness comes of God;â
and upon sig.
b iij
verso is âInsomuch that in the fifth quadrat,â &c. The use of the word
in these cases could have no veiled meaning, and it was probably only a peculiarity of
diction which had become a habit with the schoolmaster.

Was he connected with the Abbey? I think not. There is not
a word to suggest such a connection, although we may take it for
granted that the Abbot and his fraternity could not have frowned upon

19
the printer, or he would never have established himself. His imprints
all mention the town of St. Albans, but never the Abbey, and his position
was probably similar to that of Caxton, who was simply a tenant
of the Abbot of Westminster, but, so far as is known, nothing more.

Was he connected with Caxton and the Westminster press? Without
a shadow of doubt I say, No! Mr. E. Scott, of the MS. department
in the British Museum, has indeed strung together a number
of surmises to show that the Schoolmaster was employed by Caxton,
and that all the books without date or place hitherto attributed to
Westminster were really printed at St. Albans. But internal evidence
is against any such gratuitous assumption. There is nothing in common
between the two printers in any of their habits or customs except the
possession of Caxtonâs No. 3 type. This is the only one of Caxtonâs
types used outside his own office (for W. de Worde, his successor
in house and business, must not be regarded as a separate printer).
Caxton employed it from his arrival in England in 1477 till 1484,
when it makes its last appearance in the headings of âÃsop,â the
âOrder of Chivalry,â and âThe Golden Legend.â In 1485 Caxton
obtained a new fount, similar in shape and character, and from that
time the old No. 3 disappears to make way for the new and smaller
type No. 5. This being more suited to the taste of the day, we
find the larger and worn fount passing over to the country press of
St. Albans, where the Schoolmaster first uses it in 1486, being the
identical year in which its successor appears in Caxtonâs âRoyal
Book.â We may here observe that after the stoppage of the St.
Albansâ Press the same fount finds its way back again and is seen
in W. de Wordeâs reprint, in 1496â97, of the two English St. Albans
books. But the discovery of a copy of Caxtonâs Boethius in the
old Grammar School at St. Albans, and the numerous fragments of
old books extracted from its covers, are quoted as confirming the idea.
Yet the book itself and all these fragments were from Westminster,
not a single one being from a known St. Albans book, and they
included the Caxton âChronicles,â 1480, the âDictes,â 1477, and the

20
still earlier âLife of Jason;â so that we had better at once remove the
whole Westminster press, dated and undated, to St. Albans, if such an
argument is to have any force. These fragments, indeed, can only
point to the fact that the copy of Boethius was bound in the printing
office, as was commonly the case with the books from Caxtonâs press.

Again, Mr. Scott draws attention to the fact that a page of the
St. Albansâ Book, 1486, has been copied by a contemporary writer
on to the blank leaves of one of Caxtonâs earliest books. âTis true;
but this copying of part of one book into another, printed ten years
before, has no typographical bearing whatever. Lastly, the name
Causton appears in an old St. Albansâ Register of the early part of the
fifteenth century. But this, again, means positively nothing. Caxtonâs
name was not at all uncommon; there were Caustons or Caxtons in
nearly every English county, and I have quite a long list of them.

It is highly probable that Caxton, while at Westminster, in the
van of all the literature of his day, would have communications
of some sort with the important town of St. Albans; but that the
two printers assisted one another in the production of books, is, so far
as any evidence goes, a pure fiction.

Let us now glance at the bibliographical aspect of the book.

The work itself has no title. It is difficult in our time, accustomed
as we are to âteeming millionsâ of books, each with its own title-page,
to conceive a period when the press sent out works without
even the shadow of a title-page. Before the invention of printing,
the author simply headed his first page with the name of the work,
as âHere begins the Confessio Amantis,â or âHic incipit Parvus
Catho,â and, without preface or more ado, the text commenced.
Sometimes even this little notification was omitted, and, as in
Caxtonâs âJason,â âThe Chess Book,â âTulle,â and many other
fifteenth-century books, the subject of the work had to be learned
by reading the text. So it is with the book now under review;
it comprises four distinct works, but to one only is there any
heading, and that has the bare line âIncipit liber armorum.â

21
The first, âThe Book of Hawking,â starts straight offââThis is
the manner to keep Hawks,â and occupies three signatures,
a
,
b
,
and
c
, of eight leaves each, and sig.
d
, which has but four leaves,
on purpose that this portion might be complete alone, if so desired.
The same idea controlled the arrangement of âThe Book of
Hunting,â which, beginning on sig.
e j
, ends with Dame Julianaâs
âExplicitâ on the recto of sig.
f iiij
. This left the last seven pages
of the quaternion to be filled up. Now it was a common practice,
both with the scribes and with the early printers, when they got
to the end of their text and found that a page or two of blank
paper was left, to occupy the blank pages with such common
household aphorisms or popular rhymes as came easily to the memory,
or were at hand in some other book. So here the schoolmaster-printer
fills up his vacant pages with a number of odd sentences and
rhymes, most of which occur over and over again in numerous manuscripts
of early poetry. Among others we notice the well-known:â

âArise erly,

serue God deuouteli,

and the world besily.â

&c.        &c.

Also the folks proverb:â

âToo wyues in oon hous,

Too cattys and oon mous,

Too dogges and oon boon,

Theis shall neÅ« accorde oon.â

Then the list of proper terms to be used by gentlemen and those
curious in their speech is of very common occurrence:â

âAn herde of Hertis

An herde of all maÃ± dere

A pride of Lionys

A sleuth of Beeris.â

&c.        &c.

This was evidently copied from some MS., and ends with âÂ¶ Explicit,â
and nothing more. On the next page we have the proper
terms for carving or dismembering beasts, fowls, and fishes, followed
on the last leaf by a list of bishoprics and provinces.

22
Having thus filled up all his leaves, the printer begins his third
subject on a fresh signature, and introduces the âLiber Armorumâ
with the Preface (already printed). A long work on the âBlasing
of Armsâ follows, beginning on sig.
c j
, and ending on sig.
f
10.

This is extremely interesting, both in matter and in the very
rude woodcut representations of armorial bearings with which the
text is profusely illustrated. Except in one or two cases of uncommon
tints, these are all colour-printed, as are the initials to paragraphs.
In the Grenville copy, the pressman having forgotten to roll the
âforme,â the initials all appear in that semi-tinted state which
would be the natural result of such an omission. We notice, too,
that where the coats of arms require, say, three colours on one page,
then the initials are also in three colours; but if only one colour
is required for the arms, only one colour, and that the same, is used
for the initials. Occasionally, where a peculiar colour was necessary,
a brush was used to insert that tint by hand.

In workmanship the St. Albans printer, especially in the English
books, is much inferior to the contemporary issue from the Westminster
press. The types are worse, the arrangement worse, the
presswork worse, and the ink worse. From this point of view alone,
the theory that he would print for Caxton so much better than he
did for himself, is not worth serious consideration.

The Book of St. Albans went through many editions, particulars
of which are difficult to obtain.

How did the schoolmaster at St. Albans obtain his types? This
is a puzzling question in the present state of palÃ¦otypography. Mr.
Bradshaw of Cambridge has, by unwearied study of early printed
books, thrown great light upon the connection and genealogy of
numerous founts used by fifteenth-century printers, and systematic
attention to the minute peculiarities of each printer is doubtless the
only way in which those old books can be forced to yield up their
secrets; but the task is immense, and beyond the powers of any one
man to complete. Some day, however, when the palÃ¦otypography
of this country, as well as of the Continental presses, shall have
received that full technical and philosophical analysis which time
is sure to bring, the more fortunate bibliographer of the future
will be able with certainty to track the footsteps and operations of
the early typefounders, and will be enabled to state for certain to
what extent Caxton and the St. Albans printer were their own
typefounders, and to what extent and to whom they looked for
outside help. As the case now stands, we can only confess our
ignorance of where the St. Albans types came from.

CHAPTER III.

The Subjects Treated.

In the rude civilisation of the fifteenth century, a yearâs
experience of which would send most of us to our
graves, the mental occupation as well as the bodily
recreation of our ancestors was almost confined to
hunting and hawking. âFishing with an Angleâ
came in as a bad third, being too tame a pursuit for men who were
no men if not men of war. Mimic warâwar on the beasts of the
field and the fowls of the airâwar which could be pursued in times
of peace, and which yet required knowledge, patience, fortitude, and
courageâthis had great attractions, and we cannot wonder at the
general popularity of these pursuits.

The first treatise in the following reprint is upon Hawking, a
pastime essentially aristocratic from the great expense it entailed in
the purchase, breeding, and maintenance of the birds. This, indeed,
coupled with the diminution of game consequent on the progress of
civilisation and the increase of the population, led to the gradual
decadence of the sport, and nearly to its extinction in the eighteenth
century, although, in very rare cases, falconry is even now practised.

As we have seen, one of the most difficult objects in hawking
was to obtain an easy command of the proper vocabulary, and so at
first start our author instructs us in âThe manner to speak of Hawks,
from the egg.â We must not say a young hawk is hatched, but

25
âdisclosed;â they do not breed but âeyer;â it was a want of culture
in any falconer to say that hawks were building their nest, they
âtimberedâ it. When the young could first leave the nest they were
âBowesses,â and when they could fly they were âBranchers,â and
then was the time to catch and train them.

When the young were caught, which was with nets, the first thing
was to âensileâ them, that is, to âtake a needle and thread and
sew up the eyelids,â so that they âsee never a dele.â After a night
and a day the threads were cut softly for fear of breaking the âlyddis
of the ighen,â then they were fed with well-washed flesh, but kept
awake the next night and day, after which they were supposed to
be tame, or âreclaimed.â

The various diseases to which Hawks are liable are then explained,
and medicines prescribed for them. Some of these are very absurd
and some contradictory. Then comes a variety of terms for every
movement and habit, for every limb or part of the body, and for
almost every feather in the plumage. In this minute description the
author begins at the feet of the bird and so works upwards, as when
âKnyghttis been harnesside.â

Next we are instructed how important it is to be careful of the
manner of guiding the Hawk the first time it is ready to ânomme
a partridge;â how to reward her by giving her the head and neck, after
which on no account is she to fly again till she has ârejoiced,â
i.e.
,
sharpened her beak and shaken her feathers. More medicines follow,
among which is how to get rid of âliesâ (lice). âTake a piece of
rough blanket and hold it to the fire till it is quite hot; wrap the
hawk therein, and without hurting hold her âsoftely and styllyâ in your
hands, and all the vermin will creep into the cloth.â A happy thought
this!

The âGesse,â or strip of leather by which the Hawk is held when
carrying her on the hand, is next described, together with the creance
or long line. More medicines still, and then how to treat Hawks when
âin mew,â or moulting, a matter of great importance. To promote

26
âmewingâ give the flesh of a kid, a young swan, and especially rats
flesh; stewed adders are also strongly recommended, or chickens which
have been fed upon wheat soaked in broth of vipers.

Gout seems a common disease in various parts of the Hawkâs body,
which may be known by swelling and âungladness;â also rheum and
fever and blains and agrum, which last is cured by a red-hot silver
needle thrust into the nostrils. Botches in the jaw should be âkutte
with a knyfe.â More terms follow for various habits and actions, the
last paragraph being upon the variety of Bells used for Hawks. There
should be two, one a âsemytoynâ (semitone) below the other. âThe
Bells of Melen (Milan?) were the best, but,â says the author, âthere
be now used Dutchland bells, of a town called durdright (Dordrecht),
and they be passing good, sonowre (sonorous) of ringing in shrillness,
and well lasting.â

The whole ends with a list of various species of Hawks and their
appropriateness to the various stations of life, among which areâ

An Eagle for an Emperor.

A Gerfalcon for a King.

A Peregrine for an Earl.

A Merlyon for a Lady.

A Goshawk for a Yeoman.

A Sparehawk for a Priest.

A Muskyte for âan holiwater clerke.â

The second treatise is upon Hunting, and has a short preface, which
probably came, like the first, from the pen of the Schoolmaster.

The work is all in metre, and evidently intended for boys to learn
by heart. It begins by telling âmy dere chyldeâ the various kinds
of beast to be hunted; the changes of name they take as they grow
older; the variety of horns; how to skin and dismember; the various
cries and noises to be used; the seasons of hunting various beasts.

Then follow instructions how to hunt the Hare, and what to say
to the hounds, who must always be addressed in French, as âarere!â
when he enters the kennel-door; âthis is the first word, my son, of
venery.â âSa sa cy auaunt,â âSweff mon amy sweff,â and other similar
cries are noted down, some to be shouted twice only and some thrice,

27
the chief cry being âSo how.â The knowledge of when and how often
these cries should be used was most important, as their proper use would
bring âworship among all men.â Here, apparently, in the midst of
one essay, another is interpolated, and we are treated to a portion of
some old dialogue like âThe Master of the Hunt,â in which the
âManâ asks all sorts of questions and the âMasterâ replies. It might
indeed be dubbed âThe Hunterâs Catechism.â This occupies eight
pages, and then we fall back upon the original rhyme again and the
instructions of the Dame to âmy childe,â ending with the âExplicitâ
of Dam Julyans Barnes. Some leaves remaining to be filled up, the
moral and other sentences, as already described at page 21, were added.

Perhaps the third treatise upon Coat Armour and the Blason of
Arms is the most interesting portion of the book. The quaintness of
some of the explanations is very amusing, and many people will
find more points of sympathy, both historical and technical, with this
than with the others.

The headline, âIncipit Liber Armorum,â gives us at once the
title of the manuscript from which the text was compiled. âHeraldry
Run Madâ might indeed have been an appropriate title for this, as
well as all similar tractates; for the author, in his anxiety to honour
the science, does not scruple to take the reader back historically not to
Noah only, but to Adam, whose spade, he tells us, was the first shield
in Heraldry, and who was the first to bear Coat Armour. The argument,
if it may so be called, is:âAll âgentilnesâ comes from God;
there were originally in heaven ten Orders of Angels bearing Coat
Armour, but now only nine, Lucifer with âmylionys of aungelisâ
having fallen out of heaven into hell and other places. As a bondman
might say that all men come from Adam, so might Lucifer say he
and his angels came from heaven.

Cain, for his wickedness, was the first churl, and all his offspring
were churls also by the curse of God. Seth, on the other hand, was
a gentleman by his fatherâs blessing; Noah, too, was a gentleman by
nature, but of his three sons, âSem, Cham, and Jafeth,â Cham, for

28
his unfilial conduct, was made âungentle.â The address of Noah to
his three sons is curious, and is thus supplemented:â

âOf the offspring of the gentleman Japhet came Abraham, Moses
Aaron, and the prophets, and also the King of the right line of Mary,
of whom that gentleman Jesus was born, very God and man, after his
manhood King of the land of Judah and of Jews, a gentleman by his
mother Mary, and Prince of Coat Armour.â

Some say that Coat Armour began at the siege of Troy, but it
was of far greater antiquity than that, and was founded upon the nine
Orders of Angels, who were crowned each with a diadem of precious
stonesâthe Topaz (truth), Smaragdus (hardihood), Amethyst (chivalry),
Loys (powerful), Ruby (courageous), Sapphire (wisdom), Diamond, a
black stone (durable), Carbuncle (doughty and glorious). These
represent Gentleman, Squire, Knight, Baron, Lord, Earl, Marquis,
Duke, and Prince. Here we probably have the origin of the shape
of various crowns and coronets. Everything is treated in nines, and
the nine virtues and nine vices of gentleness follow, with nine rejoicings,
nine articles that every knight should keep, and nine manner of
gentlemen, in which we learn that the Evangelists and Apostles were
all gentlemen of the right line of that worthy conqueror, Judas
Machabeus, who in course of time had fallen to labour, and so were
not called gentlemen. The four doctors of the ChurchâSt. Jerome
Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregoryâwere also gentlemen of blood and
of Coat Armour. There are nine differences of Coat Armour and nine
quadrats, all of which are explained. The âBlasyng of Armsâ comes
next, the preface to which is by the author, and not by the printer.
It begins with the varieties of the Cross as borne in arms, each being
illustrated by a rude woodcut printed in its proper colours, and the
blason, or technical description of each is given in Latin, French,
and English. All varieties of arms follow, with the mysteries of
bends, engrail, borders, chequers, balls, cakes, rings, &c., offering
but little which can be quoted, but forming an interesting and useful
book of reference.

29

CHAPTER IV.

Philology.

There is a strongly marked individuality in the spelling
throughout all the treatises in this work. If the
Hunting rhymes belong to Dam Julyans, their orthography,
like the prose portions, is that of the Schoolmaster,
who appears to have been a North-countryman,
many words leading to that conclusion. The formation of the plural
by adding the letters âisâ or âysâ strikes the attention at once. Thus
the plural of bells is bellis; egg, eggis; vetch, fetchis; fulmert, fulmertis;
hawk, hawkys; herd, herdys; person, personys, and so on.
The change of a
y
at the end of a word to an
i
is common, as onli,
softeli, unthrefti; and for if; algate; awth for all the; bowke; chylder;
clepit; clees; knaw; ken; yowre; and many others are Northern. As
might be expected, many Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman words now
obsolete are found, such as benymme, blynne, byzete, canell, clepit,
colver, dagon, gobbit, kawe, kydde, liggen, merde, nasethrils, nym,
[5]

raton, and many others.

We have now traced the various aspects in which this curious work
may be viewed. There is not one of them that would not repay
much deeper study, and the reader will, doubtless, sympathise with
the writer in the wish that more could be discovered concerning the
schoolmaster-printer. That his pioneer attempts to establish a printing
press met with many discouragements was a matter of course; and,
doubtless, he had many technical, business, and even social difficulties
to overcome; for a reading public had to be created and patronage
was scantily afforded. Nevertheless he struggled on for at least seven
years, as we learn from the dates on his books, and whatever may have
been his shortcomings, either as author or as printer, the fact of his having
been one of the earliest promoters in this country of the grandest
discovery which the mind of man has yet made, will unite all of us
in honouring the memory and respecting the name, shadowy though it
be, of the âScole mayster of St. Albon.â

I
n so moch that gentiÆÆ men and honest persones haue greete delite in haukyng and desire to haue the maner to take haukys: and also how and in waat wyse they shulde gyde theym ordynateli: and to knaw the gentiÆÆ termys in communyng of theyr haukys: and to vnderstonde theyr sekeneses and enfirmitees: and also to knawe medicines for theym accordyng. and mony notabuÆÆ termys that ben vsed Ä« hawkyng both of their haukys and of the fowles that their hawkys shaÆÆ sley. Therfore thys book fowlowyng in a dew forme shewys veri knawlege of suche plesure to gentiÆÆ men and êsonys disposed to se itt.

Thys is the maner to begynne to kepe hawkys: bot not
aÆÆ maner hawkys. bott oonli Goshawkys: and Tercellis
of Goshawkys. and spare hawkys. and in watt maner
thay shaÆÆ be taake.

The maner to speke of hawkis fro an eeg to thei be habuÆÆ to be takene.

Now to speke of hawkys. first thay been Egges. and afterwarde
they bene disclosed hawkys. and communeli goshawkys
been disclosed. as sone as the choughe and in some place
more tymeli after the contre is of hete. and tymeli bredyng.

Â¶ And we sÄ§aÆÆ say that hawkis doon Eyer. and not brede.
in the woodes. And we shaÆÆ say that howkys doon draw when
they bere tymbering to their nestes. and nott they beld ne make
ther nestes And in the tyme of their loue they caÆÆ. and not
kauke. And we shaÆÆ say that they trede.

Â¶ And when they bene vnclosed and begynneth to feder any
thyng of lengthe Anoon be kynde they wiÆÆ draw somwatt out
of the nest: and draw to bowis. and come agayn to ther nest

36
And then thay be clepit Bowessis Â¶ And after saynt Margaretis
day thay wiÆÆ flie fro tree to tree. And then thay bene
calde Brawncheris. And then it is time for to take hem

Â¶ And .vij. nighttis be fore saynt Margaritis day &Ì .vij.
nightis after is beste takyng of spare hawkes.

How áºe shall demeáºn áºow Ä« takáºng of hawkis & with wat instrumÄtis & how áºe shall kide them

Who so wiÆÆ take hawkes he must haue nettis wich ben
kalled vrines and tho must be made of good small threde.
and it hade need to be died other green or blwe for espieng of thee
hawke. and he most take with hym needeÆÆ and threde to ensile the
hawkes that ben takien. And in this maner they must be ensiled.
Take the needeÆÆ and threde: and put it thorow the ouer igh lid
and so of that other. and make hem fast vnder the beke: thatt
she se neuer a deeÆÆ and then sÄ§e is ensiled as she awthe to be.
Sum vsen to ensile hem with the needer igh lidde a bone the beke
on the hede almost: bot that is the wors way For of reeson the
ouer igh lidde closith more iustly then the nether be cause of the
largenesse. When she is ensiled then bere thi hawke home on thi
fiste and cast hir on a perch and let hir stande ther a night and
a day and on that other day towarde eeuen. then take and cut eseli
the thredes and take hem a way softeli for brekyng of the lyddis
of the ighen. Then softe and faire begynne to fede her. and fair
fare with her tiÆÆ sÄ§e wiÆÆ sitte weeÆÆ vppon the fist. For it is drede
for hurtyng of hir wengys. And then thessame night after the

37
fedyng wake her aÆÆ nyght and the morow aÆÆ day. Then shee
wiÆÆ be preui Inowgh to be reclamed. And the first meete that
she shaÆÆ eete: lett it be hoot. and yeue her Inough ther of

Whan áºowre hawke maáº be draw to reclaáºme and the maner of hir dáºette

And if yowre hawke be harde pennyd: she may be drawne
to be reclaymed For aÆÆ the while that she is tender pennyd:
she is not habuÆÆ to be reclaymed Â¶ And if she be a Goshawke
or TerceÆÆ that shaÆÆ be reclaymed euer fede hym with wasÄ§e
meete at the drawyng. and at the reclaymyng. bot loke that
hit be hoote. and in this maner wasÄ§e it. Take the meet and go
to the water and strike it vpp and downe in the water. and wringe
the waater owte. and fede hir ther with and she be a brawncher.
And if it bene an Eyesse thow most wasÄ§ the meete clenner
then ye doo to the brawncher. and with a linne cloth wipe it
and fede hir. And euermore the thrid day yeue her castyng when
she is fleyng if she be a Goshawke or TerceÆÆ in this maner:
Take new blanket cloth and cut .v. pelettis therof of an inche

Whan ye haue ensaymed yowre hawke: and Reclaymyd

hir. and that she is redi to flie to the partrich. ye most
take a partrich in yowre bagge. and goo in to the felde. and let

How a man shall take an hawke fro the Eáºrer

Who so takys an hawke from the Eyerer: hym behoueth
to doo wisely. in bryngyng hym easeli. and to kepe him

Putt hir in a cloose warme place. that no fulmertis nor fecheus.
ne other vermyn com nott in to hir. and let the place be
secure from wynde and rayne. and then she wiÆÆ preue hir selfe
and euer more yeue hir good hote meetys. For it is better to
a man to fede his hawke while she is tendre with hoote meetis.
to make hir good with somme cost. then to fede hir with eueÆÆ
meetis to make hir vnthrefti with lytyÆÆ cost. Â¶ And looke

For this Croampe take a whyte looff of brede sumwat colder
then it commyth owt of the oouen. and let holde the hawke sooftely
for hurtyng. and kut the loofe almoost thorow owte. and
display the wynge esely. and holde it betwene the .ij. partes of
the loofe. and let it be hoolde so. the space of alfe a quarter
of an howre. and she shaÆÆ be hoole.

Â¶ The Croampe commyth to an hawke with takyng of coolde

in hir yowthe. Therfore it is goode for an hawke to kepe
hir warme: yonge and hoold. and this medycyne is good
at aÆÆ tymes for hir whether she be yonge or holde.

64

Let not an hawke be put in mew to late bot in this maner as it folowth. if áºe loue áºoure hawke

Iff ye loue wele yowre hawke. kepe her wele. and put hir
nott late in mewe. for who so for couetesnese of flieng leses the
tyme of his hawke mewyng. and withholdis her to long therfro
he may after putt hir Ä« mewe at auenture. for then a parte of hir
mewying tyme is past. Â¶ Who so puttyth his hawke in mewe
in the begynning of Lentyn. if she be kepit as she awth to be she
shaÆÆ be mewed. in the begynnyng of Auguste.

Â¶ how áºe shall dispose and ordaáºn áºowre mewe

Sett and dispose yowre mewe. in this maner so. that no weseÆÆ
ner pulcatt ner non other vermyn entre ther to Ner none
wynde. ner no grate colde Ner that it be ouer hote. Let that on
parte of the mewe be turned to warde the sonne. so that in the moost
parte of the day: the sonne may come Inne.

Â¶ Also ye most se that she be not auexed ner greued withe
mych noyse. ner with song of men. and that no manner folkes
come to hir. bot oonly he that fedyth hir.

Â¶ It behouyth that yowre hawke haue a fedyng stokke in hir
mewe. and a longe stryng tyed therto: to fastyn hir mete with
for ellis she wiÆÆ cary it a bowte the hous. and soyle it with dust
And perauenture she wiÆÆ hyde it tiÆÆ it stynke. and then fede
vppon it. and that myght be hir deth. and therfor when it is
bondyn to the sayd fedyng stocke. she shaÆÆ nether at the fedyng
ner at the tyryng ne at the lightyng ne at the Rysyng hurtte
hir selfe. And whan she hath fedde. take a way the remenaunt
if any leeue. and in anywyse that she haue clene mete. and att
euery meeÆÆ fresÄ§. for of stale metis and eueÆÆ metis she shal
engender mony sekeneses. Â¶ And loke ye go neuer to yowre

65
mew hot when ye shaÆÆ yeue yowre hawke meete. or ellis to bryng
water to bathe her. and suffyr no Rayn to weete hir at no
tyme. and ye may. and as for hir bathyng that shaÆÆ no thÄ«g
hynder hir mewyng.

Â¶ The maner how a man shall put an hawke in to mewe. and that is to be wele nooted.

Off oon thyng ye most be ware weeÆÆ yff she haue any sekenes
that ye make her hole or ye put hir in mewe. for as I vnterstonde
a seke hawke shaÆÆ neuer mew weÆÆ. for though she mewe
she shaÆÆ not endure bot while she is grete and fatte. for at the
abatyng of hir astate she may no lenger endure.

Â¶ Some tyme with owt any medicyne many men deuysyn hou
thay myght mew ther hawkys for sum put hawkys in mew at
high estate. and sum when thay be right low. and sum whan
thay be fuÆÆ. and sum when they be Empty and lene. and sume
when thay be myserabuÆÆ lene. Bot therof it is no force. iff she
be hole Neuertheles. I shaÆÆ say myn aduyce as I haue sene &Ì
lerned.

Who so puttith a Goshawke or a TerceÆÆ or a spere hawke in
to mew so high that she may be no higher. she wiÆÆ holde hir longe
in the poynt: or that she lese or lent any federis. And who so
puttith hir in mew lene. it will be long or she be remounted and
who so puttith hir in mew to hungry and to lene: if she haue meete
at hir wiÆÆ she wiÆÆ eete to moch. be cause of hungre. and êauenture
she may be dede ther by. as hath ofte be sene

Bot who so wiÆÆ that an hawke endure and mew kyndli. myn
counceÆÆ it is that she be not to high noder to low. noder in grete

66
destresse of hungre. bot like as she wolde flee best then take hede
the first day of to moch eetyng. vnto tyme that she be stawnchid
and after that a man may take her sich mete as I shaÆÆ teÆÆ more

In what maner and how a man shall fede his hawke in mewe.

Loke with wat meetis she hath bene most vsed to be fedde and
fede hir therwith .viij. days contynualli. and tho .viij. days yeue
hir birdis Inow. both morow and euyn. and let hir plomme

talawnt hir wele. and cause her to haue goode appetide and
it shaÆÆ clense wele hir bowillis and whan she is weeÆÆ clensed.
ye may yeue hir what meete that ye wiÆÆ so it be clene and fresÄ§

Â¶ Bot the beste mete to make an hawke to mewe moost sone
wyth owte any medecyne is the fleshe of a kydde and of a yong
Swanne and of a chikyn and especiaÆÆ Ratonys flesÄ§ so thei
be not assaughte Noon like to hit and of a yong goos for sich
meete is hote of it selfe.

Â¶ And take gobittis of grete fresÄ§ Elis. and specialli the colpon
next the NaueÆÆ. and weete it in hote blode of moton  it is
goode to make her to mewe. bot specialli it shaÆÆ make her wight
after hir soore aage

Â¶ Thees sayd fleshes bene goode to mewe an hawke: and to
kepe hir in state bot loke she haue goode plente euery day. so that
she Rather leue parte then lacke any. and euery .ijj. day let hir
bath if she lyst

67
Â¶ And when she waxith nygh ferme yeue hir hennys and
fatt porke and of an hounde is passing good.

Â¶ An hawke is neuer fuÆÆ ferme nor redy forto drawe owte
of mew vnto tyme hir serceÆÆ be fuÆÆ groyn. yet haue I sene sÅ«
folkys take hem owte of mewe when the sarceÆÆ were bot halfe ispronge.
and that is parlous. for they are not then harde penned.

Â¶ Som folkys vsen when an hawke has cast hir sarceÆÆ to
begynne and wasÄ§ hir meete. and fede hir so in mew with wasÄ§
meete a monyth or .vi. weekys or euer thay drawe thaym.

Â¶ Bot of aÆÆ fleshes after she is mewed. a resenable goorge
of an hoote haare is beest. and also of a crowe hoote. bot it
moste be wasÄ§ in water: and then it is the better. For that
wiÆÆ not benymmen hem hastely theyr grece. ner put hem in no

Â¶ To make an hawke to mew táºmeli with owt anáº hurtáºng of hir.

Now I shaÆÆ teÆÆ yow verray true medecynes for to mewe an
hawke hastyly that ye shaÆÆ beleue for trowthe and ye wiÆÆ as-say

Â¶ Ther be in woddys or in hedgis wormys calde edders that
ben Redde of nature. and he is calde veêa. and also ther be snakys
of thessame kynde. and they be verri bitter. Take .ij. or .iij
of theym and smyte of ther hedes and thendys of theyr taylis.
Then take a new erthen pot: that was neuer vsed. and cut hem

68
Ä« to smaÆÆ gobettys. and put thossame therin. and let hem sethe
stronglich. a grete while. at good layser. and let the pot be
couered. that no ayre com owte of it ner no breth and let it sethe
so long that the saame colpons seth to grece. then cast it out
and doo a way the bonis. and geder the grece. and put it in a clene
vessiÆÆ. and as oft as ye fede yowre hawke: anoÈ³t
her meete
therin. and let hir ete as moch as she wiÆÆ. and that meete shal
mewe her at yowre awne wiÆÆ.

Â¶ A nother medecáºne.

Take whete: and put it in the brothe that thedderis were sothen
in. and when ye se the whete begynnyth to cleue: take it owt
and fede hennys or chykynnes
therwith. and fede yowre hawke
with thessame polayn.

Who so will that an hawke mewe not nor fall noon of hir federis. therfore here is a medecáºne

Take powder of CaneÆÆ. and the Iuce of franke cost and
the Iuce of paranye. and take morcellis of flesÄ§ .iij. or .iiij. if

Ther is a question axyd whether a man shaÆÆ caÆÆ a spare
hawke Or a spere hawke Or an aspere hawke. & Ostrigers.
and also Sparuiters: sayen she may be callid aÆÆ .iij.
Namys. for thees resonys. She may be callid a Spere hawke
for of aÆÆ the hawkys that ther be she is moost spere. that is to
say moost tendre to kepe. for the leest mysdyetyng and mysentendyng
sleth

Â¶ Also she may be calde an aspare hawke of sharpenesse
of hir corage. and of hir lokyng quicly. and also of her fleyng
For she is moost asper and sharpe in aÆÆ thyngê­ that belong

Â¶ She may be also callid a spare hawke for .ij. Resones. oon
is she sparith goshawkys and tercellys both. siche as ben in
their soore aage. vnto tyme thay may be Reclaymyd. and made
redy to flye. as Goshawkys and tercellys that be not fully

passe her daunger I haue seen them made sum to sle the pie
sum to sle the Tele vppon the Reuer: at the Iutte. sume to sle
the wodecok and sum for the blacke bride and the thrushe.

Â¶ The wodecok is comborous
to sle: bot if ther be crafte. therfore
when ye come to a wode or a quech of bushus. cast yowre
sparehawke in to a tre and beete the busÄ§es then and if any wodecok
a rise she wiÆÆ be sure therof. Â¶ Ye most first make hir
to a fowle cast vp owt of the bushes. and yowre hawke most
sit on loofte as ye make hir to a partriche. Also as I sayde ye

a shippe fraght fuÆÆ of hawkis. and no thyng ellis. and ther were
a spare hawke among thaym ther shuld no custom be payd because
of hir. And so for the most comune name thay be calde spare

when she is on wyng. and comyth low bi the grounde. and is almost
at yow. then smyte youre tabur. and cry huff. huff. huff
and make the fowle to spryng. and with that noyse the fowle wil
rise and the hawke wyÆÆ nym it.

Â¶ And now take hede. Iff yowre hawke nym the fowle at the
fer side of the Ryuer or of the pitt from yow Then she sleeth the
fowle at the fer Iutty and if she slee it vppon that side that ye ben
on. as it may hape dyuerse times. Then ye shaÆÆ say she hath sleen
the fowle at the Iutty ferry.

Â¶ Iff yowre hawke nym the fowle a lofte: ye shaÆÆ say she toke
it at the mounte or at the souce.

Â¶ And if the fowle spryng not bot flee a long after the ReuÌ
and the hawke nym it then. ye shaÆÆ say she slew it at the RaundonÌ.

Â¶ Creepe.

And yowre hawke fleeth at or to the Creepe when ye haue yowre
hawke on yowre fyst and crepe softely to the Ryuer or to the

and bi that meane Nym a fowle. Then it is slayn at the Crepe
oder at the fer Iutty. or at the Iutty ferry. as a booue is sayde.

so shaÆÆ ye say and ther be moo fowles in the Ryuer then thatt
yowre hawke nymmyth if thay darenot arise for fere of yowre
hawke

Â¶ A thefe.

Understonde ye that a Goshawke shulde not flie to any fowle
of the Ryuer with bellis in no wise. and therfore a Goshawke
is calde a theef.

Â¶ Querre.

And yowre hawke fleeth to the querre. when ther be in a stobuÆÆ

assigned to that hawke that wiÆÆ slee a Roke or a Crow or a
Reuyn: vppon a londe sittyng. and then it most be sayd that
sich an hawke wiÆÆ draw weeÆÆ to a Rooke.

84

Nowe áºe shall vnderstonde if a man will
make an hawke to the querre in this maner he most do

Take a tame Malarde and set hym in a fayr playn. and

and serue her so .ij. or .iij. tymes and then she is made to the
quarre.

I haue knawyn gentylmen that whensoeuer and whersoeuer
thay se any tame Dookes. and if theyr hawkys wolde desire

haukys to be weeÆÆ fleyng to the quarre an oder tyme.

In moore or in moos he hidyth hem fast

So that no man may hem sone fynde

Ellys in certayn he doos not his kynde

Â¶ At saynt Iamys day where so he go

Then shaÆÆ the Roobucke gendre with the Roo

And so boldely ther as ye durne

Then is he calde a Roobucke goyng in his turne

And iff ye may a Robucke sle with owt any fayle

And ye fynde that heue grece at his tayle

As sum Robuckys haue when ye hit fynde

Then shaÆÆ ye rere it as ye do of hert and of hynde

Also the Robucke as hit is weele kyde

At holyrode day he gooth to Ryde.

And vsith the bit: when he may gete hit

To the stepe then thay goon yche hote day at noon

Which stepe thay vsen my childer I yow say

Who so commyth to that place may se hit with his ighe

An other thyng thay vse my chylde also

Of the criáºng of theáºs beestáºs.

Â¶ Maister yit quod the man what is this to say

A vauntellay a lay. and a Relay.

That shaÆÆ I teÆÆ the quod he: for a littiÆÆ byÈete

When the howndys ar set: an hert for to mete

And other hym chasen and folowyn to take

Then aÆÆ the Relais thow may vppon hem make

Even at his comyng yf thow lett thy howndys goo

While the oder that be behynde fer arn hym froo

That is .a vauntelay. and so thow shaÆÆ hit caÆÆ

For thay are than fer before thoos oder howndes aÆÆ

And an hynderyng grete aÆÆ oder vntiÆÆ

For thay may not that day nomore sewe at wiÆÆ

And holde thyn houndes styÆÆ iff that thow so do

TiÆÆ aÆÆ the houndes that be behynd be cum therto

Than let thyn houndes aÆÆ to geder goo

That called is an allay. and looke thow say so

And that hynderyng is yit to them that be behynde

For the restede wiÆÆ ouergo the weere by kynde

A relay is after when the houndes ar past

Fer be fore with the hert that hiet hem fast

To let thyn houndes fer after hem goon

And that is then a fortheryng to hem echoon

For and thyn houndes haue ouertake thees oder bi destres

Then shaÆÆ they aÆÆ folue hym of oon sweftnes

What is a forloáºng.

Â¶ Yit mayster wolde I fayn thus at yow leere

What is a forloyng for that is goode to here

That shaÆÆ I say the quod he the soth at lest

When thy houndes in the wode sechyn any beest

And the beest is stoÆÆ a way owt of the fryth

Or the houndes that thow hast meten therwith

And any other houndes before: than may with hem mete

Thees oder houndes arn then forloyned I the hete

For the beste and the houndes arn so fer before

And the houndes be hynde be weere and soore

So that thay may not at the best cum at ther wiÆÆ

The houndes before forloyne hem and that is the skyÆÆ

Thay be ay so fere be fore to me iff thow wiÆÆ trust

And thys is the forloyne lere hit iff thow lust

Wiche thre tháºnges cause the houndes to endure

Â¶ Yit wolde I weete mayster iff it ware thy wiÆÆ

Whan thyn houndes renne an hert vntiÆÆ

And ay the forther they goo the gladder thay bene

For .iij. causes quod he oft tyme is sene

Oon is when the hert rennys fast on a rese

He swetith that hit rennyth downe thorogh owt his clees

The houndes when thay fynde of that it is swete

Then ar thay leuer to renne and lother to lete

An oder cause when the hert ny no moore may

Then wiÆÆ he white froth caste ther he gooth a way

When thyn houndes fynde of that then ar thay glad

In hope thay shaÆÆ hym haue and renne so rad

The .iij. cause is of the hert when he is nygh dede

Then he castys owt of his mowth froth and blade rede

The houndes knaw that he shaÆÆ be take soone than

And euer the forther they goo the gladdir they renne

Thes are the causes .iij. that cawses hem gladde to be

Wich best a slau hounde takis as sone as aswift

Â¶ What beest yit mayster I ax it for non yÆÆ

That moost hoole aÆÆ houndes rennen vntiÆÆ

And also sone the slowyst shaÆÆ hym ouer take

As the swyftist shaÆÆ do what way so euer he take

That beest a Bausyn hight a Brok or a Gray

Thees .iij. namys he hath the sooth for to say

And this is cause therof: for he wiÆÆ by kynde

Go thorugh thornys a way the thykest he may fynde

Ther as the swyftist houndes may no forther goo

Then the slowest of foote be he neuer so thro

Now for to deuyde gentilmen from chorlis in haast it shaÆÆ be
preued. Ther was neuer gentilman nor churle ordenyd by kynde
bot he had fadre and modre. Adam and Eue had nother fadre
nor modre. and in the sonnys of Adam and Eue war founde
bothe gentilman and churle. By the soonnys of Adam and

where myght be more vngentelnes. By that did Cayn become

and his owne fadre adam Â¶ And Seth was made a gentilman
thorow his fadres and moderis blissyng. And of the

Â¶ Noe had .iij. sonnys begetyn by kynde. by the modre .ij.
were named Cham and Sem. and by the fadre the thirde was
namyd Iafeth. Yit in theys .iij. sonnys gentilnes and vngentilnes
was founde Â¶ In cham vngentilnes was founde
to his owne fadre doonÌ to discuuer his preuytes and laugh
his fadre to scorne Â¶ Iafeth was the yongist and repreued
his brodre. Than like a gentilman take mynde of Cham. for
his vngentilnes he was become a chorle: and had the cursyng
of god and his fadre Noe. And whan Noe awoke he sayde
to Cham his sonne: knowyst nott thow how hit become of

123
Cayn Adam soon: and of his churlisÄ§ blode. AÆÆ the worlde

where sorow and care colde and myschef as a churle thow

145

Here begáºnnáºth the blasáºng of armáºs

I haue shewyd to yow in thys booke a foore how gentilmÄ
began. and how the law of armys was first ordant. and
how moni colowris ther be in cootarmuris. and the difference of
cootarmuris with mony other thynggis that here needis not to
be rehersed. Now I intende to procede of signys in armys and
of the blasyng of aÆÆ armys. Bot for to reherce aÆÆ the signys
that be borne in armys as Pecok Pye Bacc Dragon Lyon &
Dolfyn and flowris and leeuys it war to longe a tariyng.
ner I can not do hit: ther be so mony. Bot here shaÆÆ shortli be
shewyd to blase aÆÆ armys if ye entende diligentli to youre rulys.
And be cause the cros is the moost worthi signe emong al
signys in armys: at the cros I wiÆÆ begynne. in the wich thys
nobuÆÆ and myghti prynce Kyng Arthure hadde grete trust so
that he lefte his armys that he bare of .iij. Dragonys. and ouÌ
that an other sheelde of .iij. crownys. and toke to his armys
a crosse of Siluer in a feelde of verte and on the right side an
ymage of owre blessid lady with hir sone in hir arme. and w
t

that signe of the cros he dyd mony maruelis after. as hit is
writyn in the bookis of cronyclis of his dedys Also I haue red
thys signe of the cros to be sende from god to that blessid man
Marcuri as vincencius sayth. in speculo historiali. of the maruellis
deth of Iulian thappostita Emproure. li
o
.xv
o
. he saythe
thangele brought vn to the foresayd Mercuri aÆÆ
armure necessari with a shelde of asure and a
cros fluri with .iiij. rosis of golde. as here Ä« this
And I fonde neuer that euer any armys waar
sende from heuyn bot in theym was the sygne of
the cros. Exceppid in tharmys of the Kyng of fraunce
the wiche armys certanli war sende bi an awngeÆÆ from heuyn
that is to say. in flowris in maner of Swerdis in a felde

146
of asure. as hit shewis here. The wich certan armys
ware geuyn to the forsayd kyng of fraunce
in sygne of euerlastyng trowbuÆÆ and that he
and his successaries aÆÆ way with bataiÆÆ and swereddys
shulde be punyshid.

I aske here moo questionis of the crossis signe

Now I turne agayne to the signe of the cros and aske a
question: how mony crossis be borne in armys. to the wich questtion
vnder a certan nowmbur I dare not answere. for crossis
innumerabuÆÆ ar borne now dayli. bot decendyng to eueri cros
the wich a fore tyme I haue seen as fer as I can I entende to
discribe. emong the wich first the playn cros shaÆÆ be discribed of
the with cros moo dowtis be made then of mony odyr crossies.
for as moch as wyse men in blasyng of armys holde for a veri
rule that ye moost begynne to blase at the lowyst poynt of the
sheelde. if the poynt be of oon coloure. and so that coloure thatt
is in the poynt of the sheelde is the felde of the armys

Â¶ Bot in that rule to remeue a way aÆÆ dowtis ye most merke
dyligently: that. that rule is true with a littyÆÆ addicion. y
t

is to witte that in armys to be blased it is aÆÆ way to begynne
at the poynt of the sheelde: if the poynt be of oon coloure that is
true: if the coloure of the poynt be more copiose or gretter in thos
armys. and then with owte dowte ye shaÆÆ begyn ther. or ellys
not Â¶ And weer the colowres be equaÆÆ êtid other on length
or ouerwart then euermore ye shaÆÆ begynne to blase thoos
armys in the right side. and in that case ye shaÆÆ haue no respecte
to the poynt.

Â¶ And iff it be asked how berith Seynt george. it is to be

147
knaw that ye most say. latine. Â¶ Portat vnum
scutum de argento cum quadam cruce plana
de rubio. Â¶ Gallice. Il port dargent vng cros
playn de gowlez. Â¶ Anglice. He beris a felde
of Siluer with a playn cros of gowles. as here
apperith in theys armys.

And the same maner of wyse ar aÆÆ crossis hauyng a playn
cros to be blased Therfore thay er: y
t
say Seynt george beris
the felde of gowles with .iiij. quarteris of Siluer of whome the
resonis I lowue not. for by thoos resonis a playn cros shulde neuer
be founde in armys ner welny no differens in armys.

Â¶ Off an cros of an equaÆÆ length on eueri parte.

A Playn cros is founde in armys differyng from the first
cros. and hit is of an equaÆÆ length on euÌi parte as it apperith
here. and theys armys be harder then the other
to blase as hit is opyn. for thendys of thys
cros towchis not the hemmys or the vtter parte of y
e

sheelde Ä« no parte in wich ye shaÆÆ say that he: that
beris theis armys. latine. sic Â¶ Ille portat de
asuro cum vna cruce plana aurea equalis longitudinis
ey omni parte Â¶ Gallice. Il port daser vng cros playn
dung longur ê tont. Â¶ Anglice. He berith asure with a
playn golden cros of equaÆÆ length on euÌy parte. And this is
the differans in blasyng. that aÆÆ thendys of thys cros arne of equaÆÆ
length the wich mai not be in the playn cros a fore. for the
foote is the lengest parte. and hit be weÆÆ made. And this differens

148
shaÆÆ appere bettir in a cootarmure: then it doth in a sheeld
& so ther is an euydent differens be twix y
e
.ij. crossis aforsaid

Â¶ Off a playn cros strayte.

that he the wich beris this cros beris Ä« this maá¹

port de sable vng cros patee dargent. Â¶ Anglice

And ye shaÆÆ say of him that berith theys armys

for it nedis not to say a besant of golde for ther be no besantis

Rochys after hys awne naam in wich armys it is dowtit.
whether it is enogh to say in the blasyng of them: that he bare

And certanly I thynke nay. for the rule goyng

Â¶ He berith gowles and iij luces of golde.
the wich certan blasyng with owte declaracion here is enogh.
for the sayd fishes ar in thare propur placis as I sayd in the

Bot what shaÆÆ be sayd of thys man then: the
wich beris .ij. barbellis turnyng theyr backys to
geder as here apperis. Ye most say in latyn thê°
Â¶ Portat duos barbillos aureos adinuicem á¹«ga

Off armys the wich ar calde frectis here now I wyÆÆ speke.

A certan nobuÆÆ baron that is to say the lorde awdeley of
the Reame of Englonde baar in his armys a frecte.
the wich certan frectis Ä« mony armys of dyuÌerse gentiÆÆ men ar
founde. other while reede other while golde. and other whyle
blac oderwhile simple and oderwhile dowble otherwhile tripuÆÆ

205
and other while it is multepliet ouÌ aÆÆ the sheld
as here it apperith. and ye most vndirstande on
gret differans by twix armys bendit and theis
armys the wich be made with the forsayd frettys
wherfore it is to be markyt that in bendyt armys
the colouris contenyt equally ar dyuydit. Bot Ä«
thes frectis the felde alwai a bydys hooÆÆ as here. and this forsayd

Off armys hauyng beestis salyentyng or rampyng.

Beestis in tharmys of dyuerse nobuÆÆ ar borne rampyng
as here Ä« thys figure folowyng apperith. of the wich Ä« the
boke
afore I haue made no mencion. And of
hym that is possessor of theys armys ye shaÆÆ
say Ä« latyn. Â¶ Portat de rubio & vnum leonem
de argento. Et gallice sic. Â¶ Il port

for as mych as the right foote ascendyth to the right horne
of the shelde. and the lefte foote descendyth in to the foote of the
shelde as apperith Ä« the figure. And this same maá¹
is obseruyt
in aÆÆ beestis hauyng .iiij. feete. that is to say in lionys leopardis
beeris doggis with other like to them.

206

Â¶ Off armys barrit and of labellis borne in armys.

First note weÆÆ tharmys of the fadyr as here.
and then the differancis as it shaÆÆ
be shewyt. for certan ther be dyuÌse nobuÆÆ men y
e

wich bere labellis in theyr armys as it shaÆÆ be
shewyt Ä« figure after. for the wich it is to be knawe
that sych labellis ar not propurli calde signes
in armys bot dyfferancis of signes. that when it is so: that any
nobuÆÆ man haue mony lefuÆÆ getyn sonnys: then y
e
first son
the wich is his faderis ayre: shaÆÆ bere the hooÆÆ
armys of his fadyr with sum lyttiÆÆ differans as
here. to whom specialli is geuyn a moon encresyng.
for that first sonÌ is in hoope of augmentacion
and encressyng of his patrimony. & thys
differans may be sum littiÆÆ molet or a cros croslet
or sych a like differans.

Â¶ The secunde broder shaÆÆ bere the hooÆÆ armys
of his fader with .iij. labellis to the differans and
in to the signe that he is the thride that beris thos
armys. Â¶ Also the thride broder if ther be any
shall bere iiij. labellis Ä« tokyn that he is the faurith:
that berith thos armis of whom the fader is
the first. the ayre is the secunde. and the secunde broder is y
e

thride: that beris thoos armys. And so folowys
that the thride broder shaÆÆ beere .iiij. labellis
as here it apperith in thys figure. And so forthe
iff ther be moo brether ye shaÆÆ encree yowre
labellys after the forme afore rehersit.

207

Â¶ And the sunnys of thoos same brether shaÆÆ beere the same
labelis. Â¶ And Ä« case that the secunde brother the wich berith
iij. labeles haue .ij sonnys certanly thelder soon of thos .ij. the
wich is hayre to his fadyr shaÆÆ bere the hooÆÆ armys
of his fadyr: with also many labelys as
his fadyr did. with a littyÆÆ differans as here it
apperith in thys scochon. Â¶ And hys secunde
brodyr shaÆÆ bere the hooÆÆ armys of hys fadyr
with the same labellis as his fadyr baare and
no moo with a bordure as here in thys figure next folowyng
it shaÆÆ be shewyt. and as it is rehersit in the chapiture
of borduris.

Â¶ And iff ther be the thride brodyr then he shaÆÆ
beere hys faderis armys with the same labellis
and a bordure of an other colowre to the differans
of hys brothyr as it shaÆÆ be shewyt Ä« thys scochon next suyng

Â¶ And the chyldyr of thoos men shaÆÆ beere
theyr dyfferans not in theyr faderis armys, bot
in borduris and dyuysionys dyuÌse.

Â¶ And like as the chylder of the secunde brodyr
beryng iij. labellis ar dyuydyt and dyfferit: by theye signys
and theyr borduris. So the chylder of the thride broder beryng .iiij. labellis: bere the same armys that theye fader did &Ì
also mony labellis. And they ar dyfferit by theyr signys and
theyr borduris as afore is rehersit: and dyuÌse othyr. as oder
while a Lyon raumpyng oon parte reed an othdr blakke.

208

Now certanly of aÆÆ the signys the wich ar founde Ä« armys
as of flowris leuys and other merueÆÆys tokenys I can
not declare here: ther be so mony. Bot ye shaÆÆ knaw generally
that for aÆÆ tharmys the wich lyghtly any man has seen Ä« his
days: ye haue rules sufficient as I be leue. to dyscerne and blase
any of theym: and it be so that ye be not in yowre mynde to
hasty or to swyfte in the dyscernyng. Ner ye may not ouerryn
swyftly the forsayd rules. bot dyligently haue theym in yowre
mynde. and be not to fuÆÆ of consaitis. For he that wiÆÆ hunt
ij haris Ä« oon owre: or oon while oon. an other while an other
lightly he
losys both. Therfore take heede to the rules. Iff so be
that they be not a generaÆÆ doctrine: yet shaÆÆ thai profecte for
thys sciens gretly.

Merke ye wele theys questionys here now folowyng.

Bot now to a question I wiÆÆ procede. and that is thys
Whethyr tharmys of the grauntyng of a prynce or of other
lordys
ar better or of sych dignyte: as armys of a manis
propur auctorite take. when that it is leefuÆÆ to eueri nobuÆÆ
man to take to hym armys at his plesure For the wich question
it is to be knaw that .iiij. maner of wyse we haue armys

Â¶ The first maner of wyse we haue owre awne armis the wiche
we beer of owre fadyr or of owre moodyr or of owre predycesessoris.
the wych maner of beryng is comune and famus in
the wych I wiÆÆ not stonde long. for that maner is best á¹uyt

209
Â¶ The secunde maner we haue armys by owre merittys as
verey playnly it apperith by the addicion of tharmys of FraÅ«ce
to tharmys of Englonde getyn by that moost nobuÆÆ man prynce
Edward the first getyn sone of Kyng Edward the thride y
t

tyme Kyng of Englond after the takyng of Kyng IohnÌ of
Fraunce Ä« the bateÆÆ of Peyters. The wich certan addicion wos
lefuÆÆ and rightwysli doon. and on the saame maner of whyse
myght a poore archeá¹ haue take a prynce or sum nobuÆÆ lorde. &Ì
so tharmys of that prysoner: by hym so take rightwisly he may
put to hym and to his hayris.

Â¶ On the thride maner of whise whe haue armys the wich we
beere by the grauntyng of a prynce or of sum other lordys.

Â¶ And ye most knaw that thoos armys the wych we haue of
the grawntyng of a prynce or of a lorde resayue no question why
that he berith thoos same. for whi the prynce wyÆÆ not: that sich
a question be askyt. whi he gaue to any man sych an armys as
it is playn in the lawe of nature and CiuyÆÆ. For that same
that pleses ther prynce has the strength of lawe. bot if any mÄ
bare thoos armys afore. for that thyng the wich is myne with
a rightwys tityÆÆ with owte deseruyng may not be take fro me.
ner the prynce may not do hit rightwysly.

Â¶ The faurith maner of whise we haue thoos armys the wich
we take on owre awne êpur auctorite. as in theys days opynly
we se. how many poore men by thayr grace fauoure laboure
or deseruyngê­: ar made nobuls. Sum by theyr prudens. SÅ«
bi ther mÄhod. sÅ« bi ther strength. sÅ« bi ther conÄ«g. sÅ« bi oá¸
uÌtuys

210
And of theys men mony by theyr awne autorite haue take armys
to be borne to theym and to ther hayris of whoom it nedys
not here to reherse y
e
namys. NeuÌ the lees armys that be so takyn
they may lefully and frely beer. Bot yit they be not of so grete
dignyte and autorite as thoos armys the wich ar grauntyt day
by day by the autorite of a prynce or of a lorde. Yet armys bi
a mannys propur auctorite take: if an other man haue not borne
theym afore: be of strength enogh.

Â¶ And it is the opynyon of moni men that an herrod of armis
may gyue armys. Bot I say if any sych armys be borne by any
herrod gyuyn that thoos armys be of no more auctorite then
thoos armys the wich be take by a mannys awne auctorite.

Â¶ Explicit.

Â¶ Here in thys boke afore ar contenyt the bokys of haukyng
and huntyng with other plesuris dyuerse as in the boke apperis
and also of Cootarmuris a nobuÆÆ werke. And here now endyth
the boke of blasyng of armys translatyt and compytyt to
gedyr at Seynt albons the yere from thincarnacion of owre
lorde IhÅ« Crist. M. CCCC. lxxx vi.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

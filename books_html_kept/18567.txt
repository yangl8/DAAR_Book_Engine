TO THE

NOBLE SOCIETY

OF

COLLEDGE-YOUTHS.

Gentlemen,

I have seen a Treatise intituled,

de Tintinnabulis
—that
is, of little Bells, the
Language Latin, but pen'd
by a
Dutchman
, being a
Discourse of striking tunes on little
Bells with traps under the feet,
with several Books on several Instruments
of Music, and Tunes
prick't for the same; Then considering
that the Well-wishers to
either of them, took great pains to
make plain the use of them, I
thought it worth a Dayes labour,
to write something on this Art or
Science, that the Rules thereof

might not be lost and obscured
to some, as the
Chronicles
before

William
the Conqueror, being
given only by Tradition from Father
to Son. Wherefore I humbly
intreat you favourably to accept
this small Treatise, as a foundation
whereon may be raised a famous
Structure; and if any one objects
a fault, excuse it with the Ringing
term—
He was Over-bell'd
—So
you will much oblige him that
is a Well-wisher to your Recreation,

Campanista.

On the Ingenious Art of RINGING.

What Musick is there that compar'd may be

To well-tun'd Bells enchanting melody!

Breaking with their sweet sound the willing Air,

And in the listning ear the Soul ensnare;

The ravisht Air such pleasure loth to lose,

With thousand Echoes still prolongs each close;

And gliding streams which in the Vallies trills,

Assists its speed unto the neighbouring Hills;

Where in the rocks & caves, with hollow gounds,

The warbling lightsome Element rebounds.

This for the Musick: In the Action's Health,

And every Bell is a
Wit's
Common-wealth

For here by them we plainly may discern,

How that Civility we are to learn.

The Treble to the Tenor doth give place,

And goes before him for the better grace:

But when they chance to change, 'tis as a dance,

They foot
A Galliard, à la mode de France
.

An Eighteenscore's a figure dance, but
Grandsire

Hath the Jig-steps! & Tendrings Peal doth answer

The manner of
Corants
: A plain Six-score,

Is like a
Saraband
, the motion slower.

When Bells Ring round, and in their Order be,

They do denote how Neighbours should agree;

But if they Clam, the harsh sound spoils the sport,

And 'tis like Women keeping
Dover
Court

For when all talk, there's none can lend an ear

The others story, and her own to hear;

But pull and hall, straining for to sputter

What they can hardly afford time to utter.

Like as a valiant Captain in the Field,

By his Conduct, doth make the Foe to yield;

Ev'n so, the leading Bell keeping true time,

The rest do follow, none commits a Crime:

But if one Souldier runs, perhaps a Troop

Seeing him gone, their hearts begin to droop;

Ev'n so the fault of one Bell spoils a Ring,

(And now my
Pegasus
has taken Wing.)

Upon the Presentation of

GRANDSIRE BOB

To the

COLLEDGE-YOUTHS
,

By the

AUTHOR

Of that PEAL.

Gentlemen of the Noble Crew

Of
Colledge-Youths
, there lately blew

A wind, which to my Noddle flew

(upon a day when as it Snew;)

Which to my Brains the Vapors drew

And there began to work and brew,

'Till in my
Pericranium
grew

Conundrums
, how some Peal that's New

Might be compos'd? and to pursue

These thoughts (which did so whet and hew

My flat Invention) and to shew

What might be done, I strait withdrew

Myself to ponder—whence did accrue

This
Grandsire Bob
, which unto you

I Dedicate, as being due

Most properly; for there's but few

Besides, so ready at their
Q——

(Especially at the first View)

To apprehend a thing that's New;

Though they'l pretend, and make a shew,

As if the intricat'st they knew;

What
Bob
doth mean, and
Grandsire True
,

And read the course without a Clue

Of this new Peal: Yet though they screw

Their shallow Brains, they'l ne're unglue

The Method on't (and I'm a Jew)

If I don't think this to be true,

They see no more on't than blind
Hugh
.

Well, let their tongues run
Titere tu
,

Drink muddy Ale, or else
French Lieve
,

Whil'st we our Sport and Art renew,

And drink good Sack till Sky looks blew,

So
Grandsire
bids you All adieu.

THE ART OF RINGING.

Of the Beginning of
Changes
.

It is an ancient
Proverb

with us in
England
(That

Rome
was not built in a
day) by which expression
is declared, That difficult
things are not immediately
done, or in a short time accomplished:
But for the
Art of Ringing
,
it is admirable to conceive in how

short a time it hath increased, that the
very depth of its intricacy is found out;
for within these Fifty or Sixty years last
past,
Changes
were not known, or
thought possible to be
Rang
: Then
were invented the
Sixes
, being the very
ground of a
Six score
: Then the
Twenty
,
and
Twenty-four
, with several other

Changes
. But
Cambridge Forty-eight
,
for many years, was the greatest
Peal

that was
Rang
or invented; but now,
neither
Forty-eight
, nor a
Hundred
, nor

Seven-hundred and twenty
, nor any
Number can confine us; for we can

Ring Changes
,
Ad infinitum
. Although

Philosophers
say,
No Number is infinite,
because it can be numbred
; for
infinite

is a quantity that cannot be taken
or assigned, but there is (
infinitum quoad
hos
) as they term it, that is
infinite
in
respect of our apprehension: Therefore
a
Ringers
knowledge may seem
infinite

to dive so
infinitely
into such an

infinite
Subject; but least my Discourse
should be
infinite
, I will conclude it, and
proceed to the
Peals
following.

Before I Treat of the method and diversity
of
Peals
, I think it not impertinent
to speak something of the
Properties

wherewith a
Young Ringer
ought to
be qualified, and then proceed to the

Peals
.
First
then, before he is entred
into a
Company
, it is presupposed, that
he is able to
Set a Bell Fore-stroke and
Back-stroke
, as the terms are: Next,
that he know how to
Ring Round
, or

Under-sally
: Then, that he may be
complete, it is convenient, that he understand
the
Tuning of Bells
; for what
is a
Musician
, unless he can
Tune
his

Instrument
, although he plays never so
well? To do which, let him learn on
some
Instrument
, or
Wyer-Bells
, to know
a
Third
,
Fifth
, and
Eighth
, which are
the principal
Concords
: Or otherwise,
let him get a
Pipe
called a
Pitch-pipe
,
which may be made by any
Organ-maker
,
to contain
eight Notes
, or more,
(according to his pleasure) with their

Flatts
and
Sharps
, which will be very
useful in the
Tuning of Bells
. And then
this is a general Rule, begin at the
Tenor
,
or
biggest Bell
, and count 3

whole Notes
, then a
half Note
, or
Sharp
,
3
whole Notes
, then a
half Note
, or
Sharp
;
and so on, until you come to the
least
Bell
or
Treble
. For example on
four
Bells
, 1:234, here the 432 are
whole

Notes
, and the
half Note
or
Sharp
is
between 1 and 2. On
Five Bells
,
12:345 the 543 are
whole Notes
;
and the
half Note
or
Sharp
is between
2 and 3. On
Six
, 123:456 the

half Note
or
Sharp
is between 3 and
4. On
Eight Bells
, 1:2345:678,
one
half Note
or
Sharp
is between
5 and 6, and the other between 1 and 2.
On
Ten
, 123:4567:8910; here one

half Note
is between 7 and 8, and
the next between 3 and 4. On
Twelve
Bells
, 12:345:6789:10 11 12. Here
one
half Note
or
Sharp
is between
9 and 10, the next between 5 and 6,
and the other between 2 and 3,
which last is made contrary to the former
Rule, it being but
two whole Notes

from the next
half Note
to it; the
reason is this, the
Ninth
is one
whole
Note
below the
Eighth
, therefore the
2 must be a
whole Note
below the

Treble
, otherwise they would not be a
true
Eighth
, therefore the
half Note

is put between 2 and 3. Now he that
hath these Rules, and a good ear to judge
of the
Concords
, may at any time cast
his Verdict (as to Bells, whether they are
well in
Tune
or not) amongst the chief
of the
Company
.

Of the
Changes
.

A
Change
is made between
two
Bells
that strikes next to each
other, by removing into each others places,
as in these
two Figures
1, 2. make
a
Change
between them, and they will
stand 2, 1. which is called a
Change
;
make another
Change
between them,
and they will stand in their right places,
as at first, 1, 2. These
two Changes
are
all that can be made on
two Bells
.

The
Changes
on three Bells.

On
three Bells
there are
six several
Changes
to be made; in
Ringing
of
which, there is
one Bell
to be observed,
which is called the
Hunt
, and the other
two are
Extream Bells
(but they cannot
properly be so called, because every

Bell

hunts
in the
six Changes
; yet because
'tis commonly
Rang
by observing
a
Hunt
and
two Extream Bells
, I will
therefore proceed in that course.) The
name of
Hunt
is properly given to it,
because of its continual motion up and

down amongst the other
Bells
, which motion
is called
Hunting
, and the other

two
are called
Extream Bells
, because
when the
Hunt
is either before or behind
them, that is at the
Extream
, or
utmost place, there is a
Change
then to
be made between them, called an
Extream
Change
. There are two several
wayes to
Ring
the
six Changes
. One
whereof is to make the
Treble
the

Hunt
, and the other way is to make the

Tenor
the
Hunt
. I will give an Example
in
hunting
the
Treble
, the
Bells

are supposed to stand thus.—

1

2

3

Now the
Treble
must be
hunted

up over the
Second
and
Third
,
which is to be done, by making a

Change
between the
Treble
, and
each of those two Bells in order;
therefore first I remove the
Treble

up over the
Second
, into the

seconds
place, by making a
Change

between the
Treble
and
Second
,
thus.—

2

1

3

The
Treble
being removed up
over the
Second
, it must next be
removed up over the
Third
, as in
this
Change
.—

2

3

1

Alwayes observe, that when the

Hunt
moves from the foremost
Bell
toward
the hindmost, then it
hunts
up, as
in the
Changes
next before; but when
it moves or
hunts
from the hindmost
Bell, toward the Bell that leads, then it

hunts
down, as appears by the
Changes

following. The
Treble
being
hunted

up behind the
Extream
Bells, an
Extream
Change
is next to be made between
them.—

3

2

1

Here you may observe, that if the

Hunt
had been
hunted
down without an

Extream Change
first made, those

Changes
in
hunting
it down, would
have been the same with those that were
made in
hunting
it up.

The
Extream Change
being made,
the
Treble
must be
hunted
down again
before the Bells thus.—

3

1

2

The
Treble
being now
hunted

down, the next is to be an
Extream
Change
.—

1

2

3

which is the last
Change
of the
six
.

The other way to
Ring
the
six
Changes
, is, to make the
Tenor
the

Hunt
, which being behind already, it

must first be
hunted
down, as in these

Changes
.—

1

2

The
Third
, which is the
Hunt
,
being
hunted
down before the
Bells, the
Extream Change
must
next be made between the 2, and
1. Which are the
Extream Bells
,
thus.—

3

2

1

The
Extream Change
being
made, the
Third
must be
hunted

up again.—

2

3

1

2

1

3

The
Third
being
hunted
up,
another
Extream
must be made,
which brings the Bells round in
their right places.—

The
Plain Changes
on four
Bells.

On four Bells, there are
Twenty four
several Changes
, in
Ringing
of which,
there is one Bell called the
Hunt
, and
the other three are
Extream
Bells; the

Hunt
moves, and
hunts
up and down
continually, and lies but once in one
place, except only when it comes before
or behind the Bells, at which time it
lies there twice together; it has the same
course here, as in the
six Changes
before

set down; two of the
Extream

Bells makes a
Change
every time the

Hunt
comes before or behind them. An
Example I will here give, making the

Treble
the
Hunt
, and the
Extream
Changes
I make between the two farthest

Extream
Bells from the
Hunt
. I
set down the
four Figures
, representing
the
four Bells
, thus.—

1

2

3

4

The
Treble
must now be

hunted
up behind the Bells,
where it is to lie twice together,
and then to
hunt
down
before them, where it must lie
twice, and then
hunt
up again
as before. The
Hunt
is alwayes
one of the two Bells
which makes every
Change
,
except only when it comes before
or behind the Bells, and it
moves only over one Bell at
a time; 'tis to be
hunted
up
after this manner.—

The
Treble
being

up behind the Bells, as appears
by the last
Changes
, the next is
to be an
Extream Change
between
the two farthest
Extream

Bells from the
Hunt
,

which are the
Second
and

Third
, thus.—

The
Extream
being made,
the

must be

The Treble being hunted down,
there is another Extream Change to
be made between the two farthest
Bells from it, which are the Second
and Fourth.—

1

3

4

2

The Extream being made, the
Treble must be hunted as before, and
so to the end of the Peal, making
an Extream Change every time the
Hunt comes before and behind the
Bells.—

The Twenty-four Changes are to
be Rang another way, in hunting up
the Treble, which is, by making
every Extream Change between the
two nearest Bells to the Hunt, as in
these Changes, first I hunt the Treble
up.—

The Treble being hunted
up, the Extream Change is
to be made between the 3
and 4, which are the two
nearest Bells to it, as in this
Change,

2

4

3

1

and so to the end
of the Peal, making every
Extream between the two
nearest Bells to the Hunt
all the way.

These two wayes in
Ringing
the

Twenty-four
, differs only in making the

Extream Changes
, one whereof is to
make them between the two farthest

Extream
Bells from the
Hunt
, and
the other to make them between the two
nearest Bells to it.

The
Twenty-four Changes
are to be

Rang
two wayes more in
hunting
down
the
Treble
; one way, is to make the

Extreams
between the two farthest
Bells from the
Hunt
; and the other, is
to make them between the two nearest,
as before. A short Example I will set
down, the Bells stand thus.—

4

The
Treble
should now be

hunted
down, but it being already
before the Bells, insomuch
that it can be removed
no lower; therefore the first
must be an
Extream Change
,
either between the two nearest,
or two farthest Bells from
the
Hunt
at pleasure; the
Extream

being made, the
Treble

is to
hunt
up, and so to the
end of the
Peal
, in the same
course as before.

In
hunting
the
Second
,
Third
,

or
Fourth
, there is to be observed the
same course, as in
hunting
the
Treble
:
A short Example I will set down, in

hunting
the
Third
up, and making the

Extream Changes
between the two farthest

Bells
from it.—

First
, I
hunt
up the
third
over
the
fourth
; the
Hunt
being up,
I make an
extream
between the

treble
and
second
, and then
hunt

down the
third
again, as in these

changes
, which course is to be
observed to the end of the
Peal
.

I have insisted the longer upon the directions
to the
Twenty-four changes
, because
it is the ground and method in

Ringing
all
plain changes
; and by
understanding this aright, the Learner will
more easily apprehend the course of all

plain
and
single changes
whatsoever.

The
Twenty-four plain changes
are to
be
Rang
sixteen several wayes; in
hunting

one Bell, it is to be
Rang
four ways;
that is, two wayes in
hunting
it up, and
the other two wayes in
hunting
it down,
(as appears in my directions before in

hunting
the
treble
:) so that in
hunting

the 4 Bells, 'tis to be
Rang
4 times 4
wayes, which makes 16, some of which
I have here set down.

Treble Hunt
up, Extream
between the 2
farthest Bells
from it.

Some persons do observe to
Ring
the

Twenty-four changes
with a
whole Hunt
,
and
half Hunt
; but that is an imperfect
course; for there cannot be one
half hunt

only, but there will unavoidably be three

half Hunts
in one and the same
Twenty-four
;
therefore I have set down the
other way to
ring
it, by observing a
hunt
,
and
three extream
Bells, which course is
much more easie and true.

In the
Twenty-four Changes
are contained
the
six Changes
; the
three Extream
Bells
in the
Twenty-four
makes
the
six Changes
in course, every
extream
change
being one of the
six
, and the

Hunt
hunting through each of the
six
Changes
, makes
Twenty-four
: For Example,
take the
three Extream
Bells in
the first
Twenty-four
set down before,
which are 234, and set down the
six
Changes
on them, thus.—

Now take the first
Change
,
which is 234, set the
Treble

before it, and
hunt
it through,
thus.—

The
Treble
being

hunted
up behinde,
take the next
Change

of the
six
, which is
324, set it directly
under the
First
, and

hunt
the
Treble
down
through it, thus.—

And so take each of
the other
six Changes
,
and
hunt
the
Treble

through them, it
will make
Twenty-four
.

I will here insert two or three old

Peals
on five Bells, which (though rejected
in these dayes, yet) in former
times were much in use, which for
Antiquity
sake
, I here set down. And first,

The
Twenty
all over.

The course is this—every Bell
hunts

in order once through the Bells, until it
comes behind them; and first the
Treble

hunts
up, next the
Second
, and then
the
3,
4 and 5, which brings the Bells
round in their right places again, at the
end of the
Twenty Changes
, as in this
following
Peal

This Peal is to be Rang, by hunting
the Bells down, beginning
with the Tenor, next the fourth,
and so the third, second, and treble,
which will bring the Bells
round in course as before.

An Eight and Forty.

In this
Peal
, the
Fifth
and
Fourth
are
both
whole Hunts
, each of which does

hunt
down before the Bells by turns, and
lies there twice together and then
hunts

up again: The 1, 2 and 3 goes the
six
changes
, one of which is made every
time, either of the
whole Hunts
lies before
the Bells, as in the following
Changes
,
where the
fifth
hunts down the
first
;
and lying before the Bells, there is a

change
made between the 1 & 2, which
is one of the
six changes
; and then the

fifth

hunts
up again into its place, and
the
fourth

hunts
down, which lying before
the Bells, there is another of the
six
changes
made between the 1 and 3, and
then the
fourth

hunts
up again, and the

fifth

hunts
down next; in which course it
continues to the end of the
Peal
, each of
the
whole Hunts
lying but twice at one
time before the Bells, as in these following

changes

The
Plain Changes
on five Bells.

There are
Six-score Changes
to be

Rang
on
five Bells
, which are to be

Rang
, by observing a
whole Hunt
, a

half Hunt
, and
three Extream Bells
;
the course of the
whole Hunt
, is the
same with the
Hunt
in the
Twenty-four
Changes
, and
hunts
up and down in
the same manner. The
half Hunt

moves once, that is, over one Bell every
time, the
whole Hunt
comes before
and behind the Bells; but when the

half Hunt
is removed either before or
behind the
Extream Bells
, then there is
an
Extream Change
to be made. For
Example, I make the
Treble
the
whole
Hunt
, and
hunt
it up; and the
Second

the
half Hunt
and
half hunt
it up,
making every
Extream Change
between
the two farthest
Extream Bells
from the

half Hunt
; the
Extream Bells
are the

Third
,
Fourth
,
Fifth
: Now observe,
that whereas in the
Twenty-four Changes
,
an
Extream Change
was alwayes
made, when the
whole Hunt
came before
or behind the
Bells
, in these
Six-score

Changes
an
Extream
is alwayes to be
made, when the
Half Hunt
comes before
or behind the
Extream Bells
; first
the Treble is to be
hunted
up, as in these

Changes
.—

, must be

Bell
, as in this

Change
.—

The
half Hunt
being removed

must be

to it.—

The

is to

Now the
half Hunt
is to
be
hunted
up over the
Fifth
,
which is the next
Bell
to it,
thus.—

3

4

5

2

1

Here the
Second
, which is
the
half Hunt
, is removed
quite up behind the
Extream

Bells
; yet the
Extream
Change
is not to be made,
until the
whole Hunt
has removed
down through the

Bells
, as in these
Changes
.—

And it is a constant Rule,
that whensoever the
half
Hunt
has removed up behind
the
Extream Bells
, or
down before them, the
whole
Hunt
must
hunt
through the
Bells, before the
Extream
Change
is made, as in the
last
Change
but four, which
is 3, 4, 5, 2, 1. the
Second
being
the
half Hunt
, is removed
up behind the 3, 4,
and 5. which are the
Extream

Bells; and then the

whole Hunt
being behind,

hunts
immediately down;
and now the
Extreame
Change
is to be made between
the 3, and 4. which
are the two farthest
Extream

Bells from the
half
Hunt
, as in this
Change
.—

The

The

the

Now I

The last is the
Extream
Change
, which is made between
the
Third
and
Fifth
;
and this course is to be observed
to the end of the
Six-score

Changes
, which is set
down at
large
at the end of the directions to this
Peal
.

Another short Example I will insert,
which is
Second
down, and
Fourth
up,
(for that is the common Phrase amongst

Ringers
) whereby 'tis alwayes to be
observed, that the first Bell which is named,
is the
whole Hunt
, and the second
that is named, is the
half Hunt
, as herein
you may perceive; where
Second

down, is meant, that the
Second
Bell is
the
whole Hunt
, and to
hunt
down the
first
Change
; and the
Fourth
Bell is the

half Hunt
, and to
half hunt
up, that is,
to move up towards the hindmost Bell
the first time it moves at the beginning
of the
Peal
; which are only directions
in making the first
Changes
, for
one
whole Hunt
and
half Hunt
may be
hunted several wayes, either up or down
at pleasure. First, I
hunt
down the

Second
.—

Now the
Fourth
, which
is the
half Hunt
, being behind
the
Extream
Bells, the
next is to be an
Extream
Change
, which may be made
either between the two farthest
Bells from the
half
Hunt
, or the two nearest to
it; and after the
Extream
Change
is made, the
whole
Hunt
and
half Hunt
must
be
hunted
as before. These

Six-score Changes
of
Second

and
Fourth
, I have set down
at large, at the end of my
directions to these
Changes
on
five Bells.

In every
Six-score
, the
Extream
Changes
may be made either between
the two farthest
Extream
Bells from
the
half Hunt
, or between the two
nearest to it, observing to make all the

Extreams
in one
Six-score
alike; that
is, if you make the first
Extream Change

between the two farthest
Extream
Bells
from the
half Hunt
, you must make
all the following
Extreams
in the same

Six score
between the two farthest
Extream

Bells also; or if you make the
first
Extream
in any
Six-score
between
the two nearest to the
half Hunt
, you
must make all the following
Extreams

in the same
Six-score
between the two
nearest also.

The
Six-score
plain and single
Changes
,
are to be
Rang
Eight-score several
wayes; for although there are but
Six-score

several
Changes
on five
Bells
, yet
by altering the
whole Hunt
, the
half
Hunt
, and
Extreams
, the course of the

Changes
are so altered, that the same

Changes
doe not come all along together
in any two of those Eight-score
wayes.

With one
whole Hunt
and
half Hunt
,
the
Six-score Changes
are to be
Rang
,
or set down eight several wayes; one
way, is by
hunting
the
whole Hunt
, and

half Hunt
both up; the second way,
is by
hunting
the
whole Hunt
and
half
Hunt
both down; the third way, is in

hunting
the
whole Hunt
up, and the

half Hunt
down; the fourth way, is
by
hunting
the
whole Hunt
down, and
the
half Hunt
up; each of these four
wayes is to be
Rang
two wayes more;
one is, in making the
Extreams
between

the two farthest Extream Bells from the
half Hunt, and the other way is in making
them between the two nearest; for
Example, in making the treble the whole
Hunt, and second the half Hunt, the
Six-score are to be Rang eight several
wayes (
viz.
)

Treble and second both up

Treble and second both down

Extream Changes to
be made between

which is called

Mediums
.

On five Bells there are 20 Hunts,
(
i.e.
) a whole Hunt, and half Hunt
twenty times, and not one; and the same
whole Hunt, and half Hunt twice, as

appears by the following Figures, where
they stand two and two together; one
of which is the whole Hunt, and the
other the half Hunt: for Example, the
2 highest Figures are 1.2 where
the treble is the whole Hunt, and
the second the half Hunt. The
two next Figures are 1.3 where
the treble is the whole Hunt, and
the third the half Hunt; and
likewise the two last, or lowest
Figures, are 5.4 the fifth is the
whole Hunt, and the fourth the
half Hunt; and so of all the
rest, the first Figure representing
the whole Hunt, and the next to
it the half Hunt.

So that there being twenty
Hunts, and every one making
eight Six-scores (as in the Example
of treble and second)
that is twenty (which are the
number of Hunts;) multiplied
by eight (which are the number
of Six-scores made by each
Hunt) does produce Eight-score
several wayes to Ring the
Six-score Changes.

In the Six-score Changes are comprehended
the Twenty-four, and the
Six Changes: The Twenty-four Changes
are made between the half Hunt,
and the three Extream Bells; and the
Six are made between the Extream
Bells alone: The half Hunt in the
Six-score, is the whole Hunt in the
Twenty-four; and there is one Change
in the Twenty-four made every time
the whole Hunt comes before and
behind the Bells; and one Change in
the Six made every Extream: So that
the Six-score rightly understood, is nothing
else but hunting the half Hunt
through every Change of the Six,
which makes Twenty-four Changes:
and then hunting the whole Hunt
through each Change of the Twenty-four,
which makes Six-score; for
instance, in the first Six-score before
set down, where the treble is the
whole Hunt, the second the half
Hunt, and the 345 the Extream
Bells.

I take the Extream Bells, and
set down the six Changes on them
thus.—

Now I take the first of the six,
which is 345, and set the second
(which was the half Hunt in the
Six-score) to it, and hunt it up
behind thus.—

Now I take the second
Change of the six, which is
435, and set it directly under
345, and the second
Bell to it, and hunt it down
thus.—

The second being hunted
through the Change, I take
the third Change in the six,
which is 453, and hunt the
second Bell through it, as
before.—

And in the same course,
the second being hunted
through each Change of the
six, will make Twenty-four,
one Change of the six, hunting
the second Bell through
it, makes four Changes; so
that the six Changes by
hunting the second through

each of them, will make six times four
Changes (
i.e.
) Twenty-four. And
now hunt the Treble through each of the
Twenty-four Changes, and 'twill make
Six-score; the first of the Twenty-four
is 2345, take the Treble, and hunt it
through it thus.—

Now take the next Change of
the Twenty-four, which is 3245,
set it under the other Change,
and hunt the Treble through it
thus.—

And in the same manner,
hunting the Treble through each
Change of the Twenty-four, will
produce Twenty-four times five
Changes, which makes Six-score;
one Change of the Twenty-four
(in hunting the Treble through
it) makes five Changes.

In every Six-score on 5 Bells, there are
6 Extream Changes, there being twenty
Changes from one Extream to another.

It would be an endless undertaking to
set down all these Peals at large, but for
the convenience of the Learner, I have
set down some part of several of them,
which may with ease be prickt out to
the end of each Peal, as the Learner pleases.

Note
, That in the following Peals
there is a Line drawn at each Extream
Change between the Figures, to shew
where the Extreams are made; as in the
next Peal there is a Line drawn between
the Figures just 20 Changes from the
beginning of the Peal, the change next
after the Line is the Extream Change,
which is 14352, and so of the rest; the
Change next following each Line is the
Extream.

Treble and second both up, Extream between
the two farthest Extream Bells
from the half Hunt.

The Changes on six Bells.

On six Bells there are Seven-hundred
and twenty Changes to be made; but
there are Peals of Six-score and Twelve-score
Changes to be Rang on them. The
Six-score Changes are to be made, by
observing a whole Hunt and half Hunt,
which are to be hunted in the same
course, as in the Six-score on five Bells,
and the Extream Changes to be made
by the same Rule as they were on five
Bells. The only difference between
the Six-score on six Bells, and those on
five, are this; whereas on five there are
but three Extream Bells, on six there are
four Extream Bells. And on five Bells,
there are six Extream Changes in every
Six-score; but on six, there are but four
Extream Changes. And moreover,
whereas in every Six-score on five Bells,
the Changes were the same in each, although
altered in course; but the Changes
on six Bells are not the same in each,
for several Six-scores has several Changes,
one Six-score having many Changes
which another has not, as in this
Peal, treble and second both up, which is,

There are other Peals to be Rang on
six Bells, as Six-scores on the five smallest,
the tenor lying behind all the way.
Treble and second, or treble and fifth,
with the tenor lying behind, makes very
good Musick: Of which Peals I need
not give you any Example, these Six-scores
being the same with those on five
Bells set down before.

The Twelve-score Changes being
only part of the Seven-hundred and
twenty, and consequently the course of
each being one and the same, I will
therefore shew the course and method of
the Seven-hundred and twenty, wherein
the Twelve-score Changes are also included.

In Ringing the Seven-hundred and
Twenty, there is a whole Hunt, a half
Hunt, a quarter Hunt, and three Extream
Bells; the whole Hunt and half
Hunt does hunt in the same course and
method, as they did in the Six-score on
five Bells, and in the last Six-score; and
the quarter Hunt removes in the same
course under the half Hunt, as the half
Hunt does under the whole Hunt: for
instance, when the whole Hunt is hunted
either before or behind the Bells, then

the half Hunt removes over one Bell;
and when the half Hunt is removed before
or behind the quarter Hunt and Extream
Bells (at which time in a Six-score
the Extream is made) then the quarter
Hunt removes over one Bell, in the
same course as the half
hunt
moves, when
the whole Hunt is before or behind. An
Example I will set down, which is 1, 2
and 3 all up, that is to say, treble the
whole Hunt, and to hunt up, second the
half Hunt, and to half hunt up, and third
the quarter Hunt, and to quarter hunt
up 4, 5 and 6 are Extream Bells; there
is alwayes an Extream Change to be
made when the quarter Hunt comes before
or behind the Extream Bells, there
are two wayes to make the Extreams,
which are the same here, as in the Six-score
on five, and made by the same
Rule, I will here make it between the
two farthest Extream Bells from the
quarter Hunt. Now the treble and
second being the whole Hunt and half
Hunt, must be hunted in the same course,
as in the Six-score on five Bells, after
this manner.

It is to be observed for a constant
Rule, that when the quarter Hunt removes
either quite up behind the Extream
Bells, or down before them, the
whole Hunt and half Hunt must hunt
through the Bells before the Extream
Change is to be made, as appears by the
last Changes.

The Extream Change is now to be
made between the 4 and 5, being the
two farthest Extream Bells from the
third, which is the quarter Hunt, thus.—

The Extream being made, the whole
Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt
must be hunted as before; and first the
whole Hunt and half Hunt are to be
hunted up, as in these Changes.

The quarter Hunt being before the Extream
Bells, the Extream Change is
to be made:

Here are just Twelve-score Changes
already set down, and the Bells may either
be brought round, and so make an
end at the Twelve-score, or else proceed
forward to the end of the Seven hundred
and twenty. If the bells are not
brought round here, they cannot come
round, until the Seven-hundred and
twenty Changes are all made, and then
they come round in course. To bring
the Bells round at the end of these

Twelve-score Changes, the Extream is
to be made between the 5 and 4, which
were the two Bells that made the last
Extream Change, and brings them round
in their right places again, as appears by
these figures

1

There are but two Extream Changes
in every Twelve-score, wherein 'tis constantly
observed, that the last Extream
Change is to be made between those two
Bells which made the first Extream,
otherwise the Bells would not come
round at the end of the Twelve-score.

Here I have somewhat deviated from
my directions before, in making the Extream
Changes; for in the last Change,
which is 123456, I made the Extream
between the two nearest Extream Bells
to the quarter Hunt; but the Twelve-score
Changes are an imperfect Peal, being
only a third part of the Changes
which are to be made on six Bells, and
therefore not to be brought round, unless
the last Extream Change is made out of
course. To have proceeded forward in
the 720, the last Extream should have
been made between the 4 and 6, which
are the two farthest Extream Bells from
the quarter Hunt, the Change next before

the Extream, is 123546; now the 4
and 6 making an Extream Change, the
Bells stand thus, 123564; the Extream
being made, the whole
hunt
, half
hunt
,
and quarter
hunt
are to be hunted as before,
and the Extream Changes to be
made between the two farthest Extream
Bells from the quarter
hunt
, which
course will bring the Bells round in their
right places at the end of the 720. In
every 720, there are six Extream Changes,
there being Six-score Changes between
each. The Twelve-score Changes
are to be Rang with any whole
hunt
, half

hunt
, and quarter
hunt
, observing to
make the last Extream Change between
those two Bells which made the first.

The 720 plain Changes are to be
rang or set down One thousand four hundred
and forty several wayes, by altering
the whole
hunt
, half
hunt
, quarter
hunt
,
and Extream Bells (but the course of
each is the same with that which is before
set down) which I thus demonstrate.
On 6 Bells, there are 120 several
hunts
,
(
viz.
) a whole
hunt
, half
hunt
, and quarter

hunt
Six-score several times, and not
one and the same whole
hunt
, half
hunt
,
and quarter
hunt
twice, as appears by
these Figures.—

These Figures stand three and three
together, each three represents the three
Hunts; that is, the first is the whole
Hunt, the second Figure the half Hunt,
and the third the quarter Hunt; for Example,
the first three are 123, the treble
is the whole Hunt, the second the
half Hunt, and the third the quarter

Hunt:
The next three Figures are 124, there
the treble is the whole Hunt, the second
the half Hunt, and the fourth the quarter
Hunt; and the last three Figures are
654, where the sixth is the whole Hunt,
the fifth the half Hunt, and the fourth
the quarter Hunt, and so of all the rest.

With one whole Hunt, half Hunt,
and quarter Hunt, the Seven-hundred
and twenty Changes are to be Rang, or
set down twelve several wayes; for instance,
take the first three Hunts in these
Figures, which are 123, where the treble
is the whole Hunt, the second the half
Hunt, and the third the quarter Hunt,
which may be hunted six several wayes,
as followeth.

Treble, second and third, all up.

Treble and second up, third down.

Treble up, second and third down.

Treble, second and third, all down.

Treble and second down, third up.

Treble
down, second and third up.

}

Each of these are to
be Rang two wayes,
one is to make the
Extreams between
the two farthest Extream
Bells from the
quarter Hunt, and
the other way is to
make the Extream
between the two
next Bells to the
quarter Hunt.

By treble, second and third all up, is
meant, that the treble is the whole
hunt
,
and to hunt up the first Change at the
beginning of the Peal; the second is the
half
hunt
, and to half hunt up; that is,
to move up towards the hindmost Bells
the first time it moves at the beginning
of the Peal; and the third is the quarter

hunt
, and to move likewise toward
the hindmost Bells the first time it removes.
And by treble and second up,
and third down, is meant, that the treble
and second are to move up towards the
hindmost Bell, the first time each removes
at the beginning of the Peal; and
the third being the quarter
hunt
, is to
move down the first time, which are only
directions for moving the
hunts
at
first, because they may be hunted either
up or down.

Sometimes it happens, that the
hunts

cannot be hunted that way which is proposed,
as in the 720, treble, second and third
all down.—

The whole
hunt
which is the treble,
should now be hunted down; but it being
already before the Bells, insomuch
that it can be removed no lower; I
should therefore remove the half
hunt

down, but that being also down as low
as it can go, I should move the quarter

hunt
; and that being also down before
the Extream Bells, I can move it no
lower, unless I should move it down
under the second, which is the half
hunt
,
which must not be done; for when the
quarter
hunt
is down next before the

Extream Bell
, it must be removed no
lower; and when it is up next behind

Extream Bell
, it is to be removed
up no higher; therefore it being now before
the
Extream Bell
, the
Extream
Change
is to be made the first of all; and
when that is done, the treble, second and
third must be hunted up in course. Or if
you make treble and second down, and
third up, then the first Change is to be
made, by moving the quarter
Hunt
up
over one
Bell
. And again, if you make
Treble and Tenor both up, and Third
down, first hunt up the Treble, and then
the Tenor, which is the half
Hunt
,
should be moved up; but it being already
behind, the quarter
Hunt
, which is
the Third, must move under one
Bell
,
and then the whole
Hunt
and half are to
hunt in course after each other: Many
Examples of this Nature I could set

down, which for brevity sake I omit.

I might demonstrate how the 720 are
to be Rang twelve wayes, with each of
the Six-score Hunts, as I did that of treble,
second and third; but I think that
altogether needless, since that Example
makes it most plain and easie to be understood:
But I will give a general Rule
for hunting any whole Hunt, half Hunt,
and quarter Hunt, so as to produce six
several wayes to Ring the 720 Changes, which is this:

Whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, all hunted up.

Whole Hunt, and half Hunt hunted up, and quarter Hunt down.

Whole Hunt hunted up, half Hunt and quarter Hunt down.

Whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt hunted down.

Whole Hunt and half Hunt hunted down, and quarter Hunt up.

Whole Hunt hunted down, half Hunt and quarter Hunt hunted up.

Which is a general Rule to Ring the
720 six wayes on any one of the Six-score

Hunts; each of which six wayes,
may be Rang two wayes more, by altering
the
Extream Changes
, one of
which is to make the
Extream Changes

between the two next
Extream Bells
to
the quarter Hunt, and the other way is
to make the
Extreams
between the two
farthest
Extream
Bells from it.

The 720 Changes are to be Rang 12
wayes with one whole Hunt, half Hunt,
and quarter Hunt; so that with the Six-score
Hunts, it is to be Rang Six-score
times twelve wayes, which makes One
thousand four hundred and forty several
wayes to Ring this 720 plain Changes.

In the 720, the half Hunt, the quarter
Hunt, and the three
Extream
Bells,
makes the Six-score Changes on 5 Bells
in a perfect course, the half Hunt and
quarter hunt in the 720, being the whole
Hunt and half Hunt in the Six-score;
for Example, take the 23456, and set
down the Six-score Changes on them,
making the second the whole hunt, and
the third the half hunt; which when you
have set down, then take the Treble,
and hunt it through every Change of that
Six-score, and it will make 720 Changes,
the same with those which I have

set down before, The Twenty-four
Changes on four Bells, and the six changes
on three Bells, have also a perfect
course in the 720, in the same manner
as I told you they had in the Six-scores
on five Bells. There is always one
change in the Six-score made every time
the whole hunt comes before or behind
the bells, which is every sixth change;
and there's one change of the Twenty-four
made, every time the whole hunt
and half hunt comes before or behind
the bells, which is once in thirty changes;
and one change of the six made
every extream, that is once in six-score
changes. You may take the six-score
changes on five bells, treble the whole,
and second the half hunt, before set
down; and hunt the sixth bell through
every change of that six score, which
will make the 720 changes; Tenor the
whole hunt, Treble the half hunt, and
Second the quarter hunt.

This is not material for a Learner to
know, it being only for the instructions
of those that know how to Ring it,
but yet are ignorant of the true
grounds thereof; therefore I have dissected
it, and shewed the grounds of
each part of it.

In this place, I will add a word or two
to those that practise to Ring the
Changes.

They that Ring the extream bells in
the Twenty-four changes, must
mind and observe the motion of the
hunt, that they may the better know
when to make the extream changes; and
likewise in a six-score on five bells, he
that Rings the half hunt, must observe
the motion of the whole hunt; and they
that Ring the extream bells, must observe
the motions both of the whole hunt, and
half hunt, that they may know when the
half hunt is to move, and also when to
make the extream changes; or else he
that does Ring the half hunt, may give
notice of the extream changes (by saying

Extream
) the change next before
the extream is to be made. The same
is to be observed in the changes on six
bells. The whole hunt is the easiest bell
to Ring in any changes, the half hunt
is more plain and easie to Ring, than an
extream bell. All changes are to be
Rang either by
walking
them (as the

term is) or else Whole-pulls, or Half-pulls.
By
walking
them, is meant,
that the bells go round, four, six, eight
times, or more, in one change, which is
commonly used by young Practisers; it
may be sometimes on five bells, Ringing
the Twenty-four changes on the
treble, second, third, and fourth, the fifth
bell striking behind every change; and
many other changes of the like nature
may be practised this way by young
Ringers. Whole-pulls, is to Ring two
Rounds in one change, that is, Fore-stroke
and Back-stroke, and in a change;
so that every time you pull down the
bells at Sally, you make a new change
differing from that at the Back-stroke
next before; this Whole-pulls was altogether
practised in former time, but
of late there is a more quick and ready
way practised, called Half-pulls, which
is—only one round in a change, that is,
one change made at the Fore-stroke, and
another at the Back-stroke, which way is
now altogether in use (unless it be at
some great bells, which are too weighty
to be managed up so high a Compass at
the Back-stroke, as Half-pulls requires)
it being now a common thing in
London

to Ring the 720
Changes
,
Trebles and
Doubles
, and
Grandsire Bob
,
Half-pulls
,
(which is commonly Rang with so
round and quick a Compass, that in the
space of half an hour, or little more,
the 720 Changes are Rang out from the
beginning to the end.) And also the
Six-scores
Doubles and Singles
,
Old
Doubles
,
Grandsire
, and many other
cross Peals on five bells, are commonly
Rang Half-pulls.

In Ringing Half-pulls some Peals do
cut Compass, that is—the whole
hunt

comes to lead at the Back-stroke, to
remedy which, make the first change of
the Peal at the Back-stroke.

By these following Rules, you shall
know what Peals do cut Compass, and
what not (
i.e.
) of plain and single
changes.
On six Bells
,

In hunting either the treble, the third,
or the fifth bells down, cuts Compass;
hunting them up, does not cut Compass.

In hunting the second, fourth, or
sixth bells up, cuts Compass; but
hunting them down, does not cut
Compass.

These Rules (leaving out the
Tenor
)
serves for five bells; and leaving
out the fifth and Tenor, they serve for
four bells.

The

Twelve score
Long Hunts
:

Or the

ESQUIRE'S Twelve-score
.

This Peal is to be Rang on six bells,
having two whole
hunts
, and one
half
hunt
; the common way of Ringing,
it is to make the fifth and Tenor
the whole
hunts
, and the Treble the half

hunt
. The Tenor and fifth does each

hunt
down by turns, and when either of
them comes down before the bells,
it leads twice, and then
hunts
up
again.

The Treble, second, third, and
fourth, makes the Twenty-four changes,
one of which is made every time
either of the whole
hunts
leads: For
instance, the Tenor is first to be
hunted

down, thus.—

The fifth is now to hunt up, and

in the Twenty-four) comes
before or behind the extream
bells.

This Peal may be Rang by making
the Twenty-four changes Doubles and

Singles, in the place of the Twenty-four
plain Changes, and many other
wayes, which I leave to the Learner to
practise.

The Variety of Changes on any Number of Bells.

The changes on bells do multiply
infinitely. On two bells there
are two changes. On three bells are
three times as many changes as there are
on two; that is—three times two changes,
which makes six. On four bells
there are four times as many changes as
on three; that is—four times six changes,
which makes Twenty-four. On
five bells there are five times as many
changes as there are on four bells; that
is—five times Twenty-four changes,
which makes Six-score. On six bells
are six times as many changes as there
are on five; that is—six times Six-score
changes, which makes Seven-hundred
and twenty: And in the same manner,
by increasing the number of bells, they
multiply innumerably, as in the Table of
Figures next following; where each of

the Figures in the Column of the left
hand, standing directly under one another
(which are 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.)
do represent the number of
bells; and the Figures going along towards
the right hand, directly from each
of those twelve Figures, are the number
of changes to be rung on that number
of bells which the Figure represents:
For Example, the uppermost Figure on
the left hand is 2, which stands for two
bells; and the Figure next to it on the
right hand is also 2, which stands for two
changes; that is to say, on two bells
there are two changes. The next Figure
below in the left Column is 3, which
stands for three Bells; and the Figure
next to it on the right hand is 6, which
stands for six changes; that is—on three
bells are six changes, and so of the rest as
follows.

The lowest of these figures are
479001600, that is, Four hundred
seventy nine Millions, one thousand six
hundred, which are all the changes that
can be made on twelve bells: And supposing
that twelve men should take 12
bells with intent to ring the changes on
them, they would be Seventy five Years,
ten Months, one Week and three Dayes
in ringing them, according to the proportion
of ringing 720 changes in an
hour; reckoning 24 hours to the day,
and 365 dayes in the Year.

Having given Directions for all sorts of
plain and single Changes, I will now
proceed to Cross-peals, and first to
Doubles and Singles on four Bells.

Doubles And Singles on four Bells.

On four bells there are 24 changes
to be made Doubles and Singles,
wherein are twelve double changes, and
12 single; next to every double change,
there is a single; so that 2 double changes
do not come together in any place
throughout the Peal, neither does two
single changes at any time come together;
but one change is double, and
the next is single, to the end of the Peal.
Every double change is made between
the four bells; that is—there are two
changes made at one time, between the
bells in treble and seconds places, and
the bells in third and fourths places.
Every single change is made between
the two bells in the middle (
i.e.
) in
seconds and thirds places; excepting
the extream changes, which are single,
and made between the two farthest extream
bells from the Hunt. An Example

I here set down, making the treble the
Hunt, and I hunt it up at the beginning
of the Peal (for it may be hunted either
up or down at pleasure) and I make
an extream change every time the whole
Hunt comes before the bells. In ringing
it, 'tis observed, that every bell hunts in
course, and lies twice before, and twice
behind, except only when the extream
is to be made, and then the two farthest
extream bells from the Hunt, does make
a dodge, and then moves in their former
course, as in these changes.—

In this last Twenty-four, the
treble is hunted up at the beginning;
it may be rang by hunting it
down, which is to be down, by making
the first a single change, and then
hunt it up as before.

With one hunt this Peal may be rang
six wayes
(viz.)
three wayes in hunting
it up at the beginning of each Peal, and
the other three wayes by hunting it down;
the three wayes in hunting it up, differs
only in making the extream changes; in
one of the three wayes you must make an
extream change every time the hunt
comes before the bells to lead, as in the
Twenty-four changes before set down.
Another way is to make an extream every
time the hunt comes behind. And the
third way, is to make an extream every
time the hunt comes before and behind the
bells. The three wayes in hunting it
down, are to be rang by making the extream
changes, as in the three wayes before;
in hunting one bell, there are six
wayes to ring this Peal; therefore with
the four bells (in making each of them
to hunt) there are four times six wayes
to ring it, which makes Twenty-four
several wayes. And for the benefit of
the Learner, I have set down certain
Rules, shewing how to begin any of the
aforesaid Peals
(viz.)

In hunting either the treble or third
up, the first change is double; but in hunting
either of them down, the first is single.

In hunting the second or the fourth up,
the first change is single; but in hunting
either of them down, the first change in
each Peal must be double.

Doubles and Singles on five Bells.

There is a Peal to be rang on five
bells, called Doubles and Singles,
wherein are Six-score several changes,
sixty of which are double changes, and
sixty are single; the double and single
changes are so intermixt, that two double
changes does not at any time come
together in the Six-score; neither are
two single changes made next to each
other in any part of this Peal, but one
change is double, and the next single, in
which course they are made to the end.
Every double change is made between
the four foremost bells (
i.e.
) in treble,
second, third, and fourth places. When
the whole hunt is hunting up, each single
change is made between the whole hunt,
and the next bell above it. In hunting
down the single changes are made between
the whole hunt, and the next bell
below it, the whole hunt being alwayes

one of the two bells which makes every
single change, except only when it
leads, and then the single change is made
in third and fourths places; but the extream
is also a single change, and made
(when the whole hunt leads) between
the two farthest extream bells from the
half hunt; the half hunt is to lie either
before or behind the extream bells, when
the extream changes are made, of which
I shall shew you more anon.

In this Peal there is a whole hunt, a
half hunt, and three extream Bells; the
whole hunt in a direct course does hunt
up and down, and lies twice before, and
twice behind all the way; every other
bell leads twice together throughout the
Peal.

And when the whole hunt leaves the
thirds place, hunting up, then every bell
that comes into second and thirds places,
does lie in each of those places twice
together, until the whole hunt comes
down again into thirds place, at which
time the bell in fourths place lies there
twice, and then makes a dodge with the
bell in thirds place (unless an extream
change is to be made) and so removes
directly down before the bells. And

that bell which comes into the tenors
place (when the whole hunt leaves that
place hunting down) lies still there, until
the whole hunt removes up into that
place again, except only when the extream
is made behind, and then the bell
in fourths place moves into tenors
place, and lies there until the whole
hunt moves up into that place.

With one whole hunt, and half hunt,
this Peal may be rang six wayes, in three
of which the whole hunt is to be hunted up
at the beginning of each Peal, which
three wayes differs only in making the extream
changes. One way, is to make an
extream change every time the half
hunt comes before the extream bells, as in
the following Six-score. The second way,
is to make an extream change every time
the half hunt comes behind the extream
bells. And the third way, is to make an
extream every time, the half hunt comes
before and behind the extream bells. In
this last way there are six extreams in
each Peal, but in the other two ways there
are but three extreams in each Peal.

The three wayes aforesaid, are to be
rang, by hunting up the whole hunt; but
it may be rang three wayes more, in hunting

down the same whole hunt, in which
three ways the extreams are to be made,
as I shewed you before. The whole hunt
is alwayes to lead when every extream
change is made.

This Peal I have set down at large,
making the treble the whole hunt, the
second the half hunt; and an extream
change every time the half hunt comes
before the extream bells, as in the following
changes. I have drawn a Line
between the figures at the extream changes,
that next below the Line is the extream.

This Peal may be rang Six-score several
wayes; there being twenty hunts on
five bells (that is—a whole hunt, and half
hunt twenty times on five bells, and not
one and the same whole hunt and half
hunt twice, as I shewed more at large in
the plain changes on five bells before set
down) and with each hunt, that is, with
one whole hunt and half hunt, it may be
rang six wayes; so that multiply twenty,
(which are the number of hunts) by six,
(which are the number of Peals to be
rung on each hunt) and it will produce
Six-score several wayes to ring it.

It may be prick't, or rang Six-score
several wayes more, by making the extream
changes when the whole hunt lies
behind the bells, but those wayes are
never practised; neither do I think it
material to say any thing more of them
in this place, having only inserted this, to
shew the great variety there is in this
Peal. It being somewhat difficult to
know the true way of beginning each
Peal, I have therefore set down certain
Rules, shewing how the first changes in
each are to be made.

In hunting the treble, the third, or the
fifth bells up, the first change in each
Peal is to be made double.

In hunting the treble down, the first
change is single in third and fourths places,
unless the half hunt lies so, as that
the extream is to be made.

In hunting the third or fifth down, the
first change is to be made single, between
the whole hunt, and the next bell below
it.

In hunting up the second or fourth, the
first change in each Peal is single, between
the whole hunt, and the next bell
above it.

In hunting down the second or fourth,
the first change is to be made double.

Every double change in all the Peals of
Doubles and Singles, is made between the
four foremost bells; that is—in treble,
second, third and fourths places.

Tendring's Six-score on five Bells.

In this Peal are contained Six-score
changes, which are Doubles and Singles,
there being sixty double changes in
it, and sixty single, which are so intermixt,
that two double changes does not
come together in any part of the Peal;
neither are there 2 single changes at any

time made together, but one change is
double, and the next to it is single; in
which course the changes are all made to
the end of the Peal. Every single change
is made between the 2 hindmost bells.
There is a whole hunt and half hunt in
it.
The observation in ringing it, is
this: When the whole hunt lies before the
bells, and is to hunt up, first it moves up
into seconds place, where it lies twice;
then into thirds place, where it lies also
twice; then into the fourths place, where
it lies once; and in the tenors place once:
Then it makes a dodge with the bell in
fourths place, after which it lies twice behind;
then it moves down into fourths
place, and makes a dodge with the bell in
tenors place, and then moves down into
thirds place, where it lies twice, and in
the seconds place twice, and then it leads
four times; after which, it hunts again,
as before. The course of the other four
bells are exactly the same with that of
the whole hunt, in moving up and down,
except only when the Bob changes are
made, and then they differ; but after the
Bobs are made, their course is the same as
before; every bell lies four times together
before the bells, and twice in the seconds

place without any alteration.
In
this Peal are two sorts of Bobs; one of
which is called a double Bob, and the
other a single Bob. The Rule for making
the double Bob is this, when the
whole hunt is hunting down, and lies in
the seconds place, and the half hunt lies
behind, then there's a double Bob; that
is, two Bob-changes; one of which is
made the next change, wherein the
whole hunt moves down to lead; where
having led four times, there is then another
Bob-change to be made, in which
the whole hunt moves up into the seconds
place. The Rule for making the
single Bob, is this, when the whole hunt
has led four times, and the half hunt
lies in thirds place; then the next change
following is a single Bob, that is—one
Bob-change, in which the whole hunt
moves out of the trebles place up into
the seconds place, every Bob is a double
change, and made between the two
first, and two last bells, the bell in thirds
place lying still when each Bob is made,
where it lies four times together, and
then moves down; every time the whole
hunt comes before the bells, there is either
a single Bob, or a double Bob made.

At every double Bob, those two bells
that do dodge behind at the first Bob-change,
continues dodging until the
whole hunt moves up, and parts them:
And likewise at the single Bob, those 2
bells which do dodge behind at the Bob-change,
continue dodging until the whole
hunt moves up, and parts them, as in
the following changes, where the treble
is the whole hunt, the tenor the half
hunt, and the first is a Bob-change, being
supposed to be the second Bob-change
of a double Bob.

This Peal was made out of
Grandsire
on
five bells, the Bob-changes in this, being
the same with those in
Grandsire
,
and made by the same Rule.

Paradox on five Bells.

This Peal of
Paradox
is to be rang
on five bells, wherein are Six-score
changes, they are Doubles and Singles;
that is—one change double, and another
single; in which course they are made
to the end of the Peal. Every single
change is made in second and thirds places,
except only when the whole Hunt
leads, and then 'tis made in third and
fourths places; but the extream Changes
are (also single) and made between
the two farthest extream bells
from the half Hunt; the whole Hunt
lies before the bells, when every extream
change is made. Every bell lies
four times together before, and four
times behind, except only when the extream
changes are made behind. There
is a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and three
extream bells; the course of the whole
Hunt is this, it being before the bells,

first it moves up into the second and
thirds places, then it makes a dodge with
the bell in seconds place, and moves out
of the thirds place up into fourths, where
it lies alwayes twice, then moves up behind,
where it lies four times, and then
moves down into fourths place, where
having lay twice, it hunts down into seconds
place, and makes a dodge with
the bell in thirds place, and then moves
down before the bells, where having lay
twice, it hunts as before; each of the
other bells has the same course (in hunting
up and down) as the whole Hunt
until the whole Hunt leads, at which
time every bell that comes into seconds
place lies there twice together, unless
the extream change is to be made in second
and thirds places.

In this following Peal the treble is
the whole Hunt, and the second the half
Hunt; the extream changes are made,
when the half Hunt lies before the extream
bells.

I have drawn a Line between the
Figures at the extream changes, that
next below each Line is the extream; the
first extream is Forty changes from the
beginning.

This Peal is grounded on the Twenty-four
changes Doubles and Singles on four
bells. The half Hunt, and three extream
bells in this Peal, makes the Twenty
four changes in a perfect course. There
are four changes made in the Twenty-four
every time the whole Hunt leads,
which coming before the bells six times in
the Six-score, and each time lying there
four times together, makes six times four
changes, which is Twenty four. 'Tis
easily made out, if you take every change
that is made when the whole Hunt is before
the bells in the Six-score before, and
set the changes down by themselves (leaving
out the treble) where you will find,
that the second, third, fourth and fifth,
make the Twenty-four changes Doubles
and Singles, in a perfect course; second is
the Hunt, and the extreams are made
when the Hunt is before.

Paradox
may be rang Six-score several
wayes. With one whole Hunt,
and half Hunt, it may be rang six wayes,

in three of which the whole Hunt is to
be hunted up; and in the other three
wayes it is to be hunted down, in which
six wayes the extream changes are to be
made by the same Rules, and in the same
manner, as I shewed before in the Six-score
Doubles and Singles on five bells;
so that with the twenty Hunts, it may be
prick't or rang twenty times six wayes,
which makes Six-score.

This Peal may be prick't Six-score
wayes more, by making the extreams
when the whole Hunt lies behind the
bells, but that being never practised, I
will say no more of it. I have here set
down some general Rules for beginning
the several Peals of
Paradox
by the
former course (
i.e.
) in making the
extreams when the whole Hunt is before
the bells.

In hunting the treble up, the first
change is double between the four first
bells, thus.—

In hunting the treble down, the first
change is single in third and fourths places

(
thus.—

)

unless the
half Hunt lies so, that the extreams may
be made.

Second up, the first change is single in
second and thirds places, thus.—

Second down, the first change is double
between the four first bells.

Third up, the first change is double between
the four first bells.

Third down, the first change is single
in second and thirds places.

Fourth up, the first change is double
between the four hindmost bells, thus.—

Fourth down, the first change is double
between the four first bells.

Fifth up, the first change is single in
second and thirds places.

Fifth down, the first change is double
between the four hindmost bells.

If you observe these Rules aright, together
with my former directions, you
may with much ease prick down any
Peal of
Paradox
.

PHOENIX. On five Bells.

This Peal has Six score changes in
it, which are Doubles and Singles;
the tenor is the whole Hunt, and the
fourth the half Hunt. Every bell lies
twice before, and four times behind;
every single change is made in second
and thirds places, and every bell that
comes into fourths place, lies there
twice together, until the tenor comes behind;
at which time, the fourth lying
in the seconds place, the next single
change is made in third and fourths places;
but the tenor lying behind, and the
fourth in thirds place, then the two
next following single changes are in third
and fourths places.

London Pleasure on five Bells.

In this Peal called
London Pleasure
,
are Six-score changes, which are all
single. It being a confused Peal to ring,
I shall say nothing more of it, but expose
it to view, as in the following changes.

What you please.
Doubles and Singles on 5 Bells.

Every bell leads four times, and lies
behind twice, except when the extream
is made behind, and twice in the
seconds place, except when the extream
is before; and note, when the treble is
before the fourth stroke, the single is in
second and third, the next time the single
is behind; but at other times, the
single is in third and fourths places.
When any bell leaves leading, the double
change is on the two first, and two
last, and the extreams are made by turns,
first behind, then before, and so on to
the end, for there are six extreams.

if it be before, the double is on the two
first and two last; every bell lieth twice
behind, except when the treble goes to
lead, if the third be before; and note,
when it is 1, 3, 2, there is a single in second
and thirds places, which is twice,
once at the Three-score end, and Six-score

Old Doubles. On five Bells.

This Peal call'd
Old Doubles
, is to
be rang on five bells, wherein are
Six-score changes, which are all Doubles,
except only when the whole Hunt
leads, and then there is always a single
change made. It has a whole Hunt, a
half Hunt, and three extream bells;
every bell leads twice together all the
way, and lies twice behind, except only
when the whole Hunt leads, and then the
bell behind lies there four times together,
unless the extream is made behind,
and then but twice. Every bell hunts
in a perfect course, until the whole Hunt
leads, and then the single is to be made,
at which time the bell in seconds place
lies there twice (unless the extream is
made in second and thirds place) and
every single change is made in third and
fourths places, except the extreams

which are (in this Peal) made by the
same rule and after the same manner,
as I shewed before in the Six-score call'd
Doubles and Singles on five bells. In
making the single changes in third and
fourths places, it is observed, that the
bell which lies in fourths place (the
change next before the single) is hunting
up; and in making the single change, it
does dodge with the bell in thirds place,
and so hunts up behind; and likewise
the bell that lies in thirds place (in the
change next before the single) is hunting
down, and in making the single it
does dodge with the bell in fourths
place, and then hunts directly down.

In this following Peal, the treble is the
whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt,
and an extream change is alwayes
made, when the half Hunt lies before
the extream bells next to the whole
Hunt; every extream is made between
the two farthest extream bells
from the half Hunt, as in the following
changes.

This Peal of
Old Doubles
, is grounded
on the Twenty-four changes Doubles
and Singles on four bells, which are
made in a perfect course herein; every
time the whole Hunt leads, there are
two changes made in the Twenty-four;
the half Hunt, and three extream bells,
makes the Twenty-four changes, and
every single change in this Peal, is a single
change in the Twenty-four.

This Peal may be rang Six-score several
wayes; with one whole Hunt, and
half Hunt, it is to be rang six wayes (
i.e.
)
three wayes in hunting up the whole
Hunt at the beginning of the Peal, and
the other wayes in hunting it down; in
which six wayes, the Extream Changes
are to be made by the same rule, and in
the same manner, as those in the Six-score
Doubles and Singles on five Bells, and

Paradox
before set down; so that with
the twenty Hunts, it may be rang twenty
times six wayes, which makes Six-score.

In these Six-score wayes, the whole
Hunt is before the Bells when every single
Change is made; but it may be rang
Six-score several wayes more, by making
the single Changes when the whole

Hunt lies behind them, which being
never practised, I will say no more
of it.

For the convenience and benefit of
the Practitioner, I have set down certain
rules, shewing how to begin each Peal
of
Old Doubles
(with any Hunt) by
the former course (
i.e.
) in making
the single Changes, when the whole
Hunt lies before the Bells, these Rules
serving only for moving the whole Hunt
at the beginning of each Peal, for it may
be hunted either up or down.

In hunting either the treble, third, or fifth
Bells up, the first change is made between
the four foremost Bells, thus.—

1

—The treble down, the first change is single
in third and fourths places, unless
the half Hunt lies so, as that the Extream
is to be made.

—The third or fifth down, the first change
is between the four hindmost Bells,
thus.—

2

5

4

—The second or fourth up, the first change
is between the four hindmost Bells.

—The second or fourth down, the first
change between the four foremost Bells.

In ringing any of these Peals, where
the first change is made between the
four hindmost Bells, it must be made at
the Back-stroke, otherwise the Bells will
cut Compass all the way; every double
change is made either between the four
foremost, or four hindmost bells.

New Doubles. On five Bells.

In this Peal of
New Doubles
, there
are Six-score Changes, which are all
double, except only when the whole
Hunt leads, and then there is alwayes a
single Change made; it has a whole
Hunt, a half Hunt, and three Extream
Bells. The whole Hunt has a perfect
course in hunting up and down, and lies
twice before, and twice behind. When
the whole Hunt leaves the thirds place
hunting up, then each Bell that comes
into that place, lies there twice, and then
moves up behind; and the Bells in treble
and seconds places, does continue
dodging from the time that the whole
Hunt hunts up out of thirds place, until
it comes into that place again hunting
down; and that Bell which comes into

thirds place (when the whole Hunt
leaves it hunting down, lies there twice,
and then moves up behind) and the next
Bell that comes into that place, lies
there twice also, and then moves down
before the Bells. But note, that Bell
which lies in the thirds place (in the
Change next before the Extream) continues
there, until the whole Hunt hunts
up into that place, and then it moves
down; when the whole Hunt leads the
Bell in seconds place, lies there twice
together, and then moves down before
the Bells; and every Bell that comes
behind, lies there twice, except only in
the Change next before, and that next
after the whole Hunt leads; every single
Change is made in third and fourths places,
except the Extreams, which are also
single Changes, and made between the
two hindmost Bells, when the half Hunt
lies before the Extream Bells next to the
whole Hunt.

These directions are only for Ringing this
Peal next following; but it may be
Rang many other wayes, by making
the Extream Changes in other places,
of which I shall speak more anon.

This Peal may be Rang Six-score several
wayes. With one whole Hunt, and
half Hunt, it may be Rang six wayes; in
three of which, the whole Hunt is to be
hunted up, and in the other three wayes
it is to be hunted down; which six wayes
are to be Rang, by making the Extream
changes by the same rules, and in the
same manner, as in Doubles and Singles
on five Bells,
Old Doubles
, and
Paradox
,
before set down; so that with the
twenty Hunts, it may be Rang twenty
times six wayes; which makes Six-score.

This Peal is grounded on the Twenty-four
Changes, Doubles and Singles on
four Bells, the half Hunt and three Extream
Bells makes the Twenty-four
Changes in perfect course; and in the
same manner, as I shewed you in
Paradox
,
and
Old Doubles
.

These following rules shews how to
begin any Peal of
New Doubles
.

In hunting either the treble or fourth
up, the first change must be double between
the two first, and two last Bells,
thus.—

In hunting the treble down, the first
change is single in third and fourths

places, unless the extream is to be
made.

—The fourth down, the first change is between
the four first Bells.

Second up, first change double between the
four hindmost Bells.

Second down, the first change is double between
the two first, and two last
Bells.

Third up, first change double between the
four foremost Bells.

Third down, first change double between
the four hindmost Bells.

Fifth up, double between the four first
Bells.

Fifth down, first change double, two first
and two last Bells.

Grandsire on five Bells.

Grandsire
is the best and most ingenious
Peal that ever was composed, to be
rang on five bells, it having no dependance
on the course of any other Peal. There
are Sixscore changes in it, in pricking of which,
there is the greatest variety of any other Peal
whatsoever; for it may be prick't or rang some
thousands of wayes. The common way of
ringing it, is to make the Bobs and single changes
when the whole Hunt leads, which course

and method I will first set down, and afterward
say something of the other wayes in ringing it.
It has a whole hunt and half hunt, the changes
are all double except two, which are single. The
whole hunt has a perfect course in hunting up
and down, and lies twice together before, and
twice behind all the way; every other bell has
the same course as the whole hunt, in moving
and hunting up and down; and each bell lead
twice together all the way, and lie twice together
behind, except only at the Bobs. Every
Bob-change is made between the two first
and two last bells, the bell in thirds place
lies full when every Bob-change is made,
and then moves down; and every other
double change is made between the four
bells that stand together (
viz.
) either the
four first, or four last bells. There are two
sorts of Bobs, one of which is call'd a single
Bob, and the other a double. The Rule for
making the single Bob is this—When the
whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies in
thirds place, the next is a Bob-change; in making
of which, the whole hunt moves out of
the trebles place up into the seconds place hunting
up, and the bell which lies behind in the
change next before the Bob, makes a dodge
with the bell in fourths place, and then lies
twice behind; and that bell which did dodge
with the bell in tenors place, moves directly
down; this is a single Bob, that is, one Bob-change.
The Rule for making the double Bob
is this—When the whole hunt lies in the seconds
place hunting down, and the half hunt
behind, then there is a double Bob, that is, two

Bob-changes, one of which is made the next
change wherein the whole Hunt moves out of
the seconds place down before the bells, and
the other bob is made the next change but
one to it, in which the whole Hunt moves from
before the bells up into the seconds place; the
bell which lies in the thirds place when every
Bob-change is made, lies there twice, and then
moves down. And at every double Bob, the
two hindmost bells continue dodging until the
whole Hunt moves up into the seconds place,
and parts them. Every time the whole Hunt
comes before the bells, there is either a single
Bob, or double Bob made, which comes by
turns, one single, and the next double throughout
the Peal.

The greatest variety of this Peal consists in
making the single changes. In this way of
Ringing it (with any whole Hunt and half
Hunt) the first single change may be made
either at the first, second, third, fourth, fifth,

or
sixth Bobs, at the single or double Bobs at

pleasure;
observing for a constant Rule, that

the
half Hunt is alwayes one of the two bells
which makes every single change; for the single
changes are so contrived, that (in making
them) the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to
continue their constant course as at other
times. At the single Bob, the single change is
made in seconds and thirds places; and at the
double Bob, 'tis made in fourth and fifths places,
the other three bells lying still in their places,
whil'st each single change is made; the next
change to each single, is a Bob-change; every
single change is made when the whole hunt

lies before the bells; there being alwayes sixty
changes, from the first single change to the second;
if the first single change is made at a
single bob, then the second single change must
be made at the third single bob from it; or if
the first single change is made at a double bob,
the second single change must be made at the
third double bob from that where the first was
made.

This Peal may be rang without making any
single change therein, which is done by making
a double change to supply the place of it.
There are two of these double changes in each
Peal; the first of them may be made at any
bob within sixty changes from the beginning
of the Peal, and the second is to be made just
sixty changes from the first. At a double bob,
it may be made at either of the two bob-changes;
at the first of them, 'tis made by
moving the whole Hunt down, and the bell in
thirds place up over two bells at once into
the tenors place, thus:—

4

1

3

2

5

1

4

2

In making it at the second bob change of
the double bob, 'tis the same as at the first,
only in that the whole Hunt moved down to
lead; but in this it must move up from before
the bells into the seconds place, as in this
change:—

1

2

4

3

5

2

3

5

4

The changes next following these, are the
same as at other times. At the single bob, 'tis
to be made when the whole Hunt lies in the
seconds place hunting down; in which place
it may be made two wayes, in one of which
the bell in thirds place is to be moved up behind,
in the same manner as I showed you at

the double bob: The other way, is to move
the bell in tenors place down into the thirds
place, thus:—

5

1

4

2

3

1

2

Now the reason wherefore at this place it
may be made two wayes, and at each of the
double bob changes but one way, is this; At
the double bob, the half Hunt lies behind,
which cannot be moved into thirds place, for
that would put it out of its course; but in the
single bob, the half Hunt lying before the bells,
and the whole Hunt in seconds place, so that
neither of those bells are concerned therein;
therefore it may be made either by moving the
bell in thirds place up behind, or else by moving
the hindmost bell down into thirds place,
both which are to one effect, though different
changes; for these changes are so continued,
that (in making them) the whole Hunt and
half Hunt are to continue their constant
course, as at other times.

I have here set down this Peal of Grandsire,
making the treble the whole Hunt, and
the tenor the half Hunt, and the first single
change is made the sixth bob; that is, the
third double bob, which is sixty changes from
the beginning of the Peal; you may know
the single change, by the line drawn between
the figures at the single change, that next after
the line is the single: Grandsire is most commonly
rang, as it is here prickt; but it may be
rang any other way, according to my directions
before.

Grandsire may be rang another way (
i.e.
)
in making the bobs when the whole Hunt is
before the bells (as in the former way) and
to make the single changes when it lies behind
(
viz.
) the first single change may be
made at any time when the whole Hunt comes
behind, provided it be made within sixty
changes from the beginning of the Peal; if it
is made the next time the whole Hunt comes
behind after a single bob, it is in treble and
seconds places; after a double bob, it is made
in third and fourths places, the whole Hunt

lying behind when each single change is made,
and the second single change must be made
just sixty changes from the first.

In all the several Peals of Grandsire by the
course aforesaid, the first changes in each Peal
must be made by these following Rules:

B 1,3

B 1,5

2,3

2,4

3,2

3,5

4,1

4,5

5,1

5,4

With these ten Hunts, the whole
Hunt is to be hunted up at the
beginning of each Peal.

1,2

1,4

2,1

B 2,5

3,1

3,4

4,2

4,3

5,2

5,3

With these ten Hunts, the first
change in each Peal is made
by hunting the whole
Hunt down.

These are the twenty Hunts on five bells,
which are set down in
Page 26
. The two
figures which stand together, do represent the
whole Hunt and half Hunt; for instance, the
uppermost figures are 1,3; the 1 is the whole
Hunt, and the 3 is the half Hunt, and so of
the rest. Where the letter B stands by the
Hunt, the first change that Hunt makes is a
Bob: But with all the other Hunts, the first
change is either between the four first, or four
last bells; yet the first change in many of them
may be made single, as in 1,2: 1,3: 1,4:
1,5: 2,1: 2,3: 3,1: 3,5: 4,1: 4,3:
1,5: 5,1: 5,4:

In hunting the treble down, the first change
is made between the four hindmost bells; and
in hunting the fifth bell up, the first change is
made between the four foremost bells.

There is another way to Ring this Peal of
Grandsire, which is, to make the bobs and
single changes when the whole hunt lies behind
the bells; but this is not convenient to
be practised, therefore I will say no more of it
in this place, having only mentioned this, to
shew the great variety there is in this Peal.

This Peal of Grandsire is to be Rang by
another course,
viz.
to make the bobs when
the whole hunt is behind the bells, and the single
changes, when it lies before them. This is
the absolute foundation from whence the excellent
Peal of Grandsire bob (on six bells) had
its beginning and method, and by practising
to prick down this Peal, and by observing
the true course and method of the bobs and
single changes herein, you may with the greatest
ease understand the true course of the bobs
and single changes in Grandsire bob on six
bells, for the half hunt, the quarter hunt, and
the three extream bells (in Grandsire bob on
six bells) do make these sixscore changes; every
time the whole hunt leads in Grandsire bob,
there are two changes made in this Peal of
Grandsire on five bells: And so consequently,
the single changes in Grandsire bob are made
by the same rule and method as they are in
this Peal. The Rule for making the bobs in
this Peal, is this (
viz.
) when the whole hunt
lies in the fourths place hunting up, and the
half hunt leads, the next is a double Bob: And

when the whole hunt lies in the tenors place,
and the half hunt in thirds place, then the next
change is a single bob, the bobs are made between
the two first and two last bells, that in
thirds place lies still in the bob change, and
then moves up. The single changes are made
when the whole hunt leads; the first single
change (in Ringing it with any whole hunt
and half hunt) may be made at any time
when the whole hunt leads, within sixty changes
from the beginning of the Peal, accounting
the bells as they stand round at the beginning
for one of the sixty changes. The single
change that is made the next time the whole
hunt leads after a single bob, is made in fourth
and fifths places; and that which is made next
after a double bob, is made in second and
thirds places, the half hunt is alwayes one of
the two bells which makes every single change.
If the first single change is made after a single
bob, then the second single change must be
made when the whole hunt leads next after the
third single bob from that after which the first
single was made; and the same is observed, in
making them after a double bob: there being
alwayes sixty changes from the first to the second
single change in each Peal. This Peal I
have here set down, in which I make the treble
the whole hunt, the fifth the half hunt, and the
first single change is made when the whole
hunt comes to lead next after the first single
bob: You may know the single change, by the
line drawn between the figures; the change
next below the line, is the single, as in the following
Peal.

This Peal may be Rang without making any
single change therein, there are two double
changes which may be made to supply the places
of the two single changes; the first of these
double changes in any Peal may be made any
time when the whole hunt lies in fourths place
hunting up, provided you make it within sixty
changes from the beginning of the Peal. At
a double bob, it may be made at either of the
two bob changes, by moving the bell which
lies in thirds place down under two bells at
once into the trebles place: Now suppose it

were to be made the first time the whole hunt
lies in the fourths place hunting up in the Peal
next before, which is at a double bob, the bells
lie thus, 53412; now the treble being the
whole hunt must move up behind, and the
fourth bell being in thirds place, must move
down under two bells at once into the trebles
place, thus, 45321; or else it may be made
at the next bob change of the double bob,
53241; here the treble must be moved down
into fourths place, and the second bell into trebles
place, thus, 25314. It may also be made
the change next before the single bob, in which
change it may be made two wayes;
viz.
either
by moving the bell in thirds place down into
trebles place, as in the changes next before, or
else by moving the bell in trebles place up into
thirds place; for instance, two changes before
the first single bob (as in the Peal before set
down) the bells be thus, 24315; now the
change may be made, either by moving the
third bell into the trebles place, thus, 32451;
or else the bell that leads up into thirds place,
thus, 43251; in both which wayes, the whole
hunt is to be moved up behind.

There are only two of these double changes
to be made in each
Peal:
if the first is made at
a double bob, then the second must be made at
the third double bob from it; or if the first of
them is made at a single bob, then the second
must be made at the third single bob from that
where the first was made, there being alwayes
just sixty changes from the first of these double
changes to the second in each Peal.

These double changes are the same which in

Grandsire bob on six bells, are called true
changes; those true changes in Grandsire bob
being made by the same rule, and in the same
manner as these are.

In all the Peals of Grandsire, wherein the
bobs are made when the whole hunt is behind
(according to the Rules next before set down)
the first changes in each Peal must be made by
these Rules following.

5,2

With these ten Hunts, the first
change in each Peal is made
by hunting the whole
Hunt up.

Where the letter B stands next to any hunt;
the first change which that hunt makes, is a
bob: But with all the other hunts, the first
change in each Peal is made double, either between
the four first, or four last bells; yet in
many of them, the first change may be
made single, as in 1,2: 1,5: 2,1: 2,3:
2,5: 3,5: 4,3: 4,5: 5,2: 5,3:

Before I conclude my directions to this excellent
Peal of Grandsire, I will set down one
general Rule for making the single changes in

any Peal (at places differing from any of the
former Rules)
viz.
wheresoever the whole
hunt and half hunt meets together to make
a change (which constantly happens every time
the whole hunt hunts up, and every time it
hunts down in every Peal) the other three
bells may lie still in their places, whil'st the
whole hunt and half hunt makes the change;
which being made, the whole hunt, the half
hunt, and the other bells are immediately to
proceed in their course; which single change
is as effectual, as those which are made by the
Rules aforesaid. Observing to make the first
single change in any Peal, within sixty changes
from the beginning; and the second single
change must be made (just sixty changes from
the first) between the whole hunt, and half
hunt, which two bells will in course lie in the
same places where the first single change was
made.

The Seven-score and four on six Bells.

This Peal containing Seven-score and four
changes, is to be Rang on six bells, in
which, the treble and tenor are both whole
hunts, and the second is half hunt; the
whole hunts do both hunt at one and the same
time in a direct course, one up, and the other
down; and alwayes when one of them lies before
the bells, the other lies behind them; and
when that hunt which lies before the bells,
leaves the trebles place hunting up, the other

hunt lying behind, leaves the tenors place hunting
down; each hunt lies only twice together
before the bells, and twice behind
throughout the Peal.

The second bell is the half hunt in this following
Peal, for the second, third, fourth and
fifth bells make the twenty four changes herein;
every time the whole hunts come before
and behind the bells, there is one change made
in the Twenty-four (which is alwayes once
in six changes) the second bell being the hunt
on the Twenty-four; so that every time it
comes before or behind the extream bells, there
is an extream change to be made, which in the
following Peal is made between the two farthest extream
bells from the second. I have
only set down part of this Peal, which is sufficient
to shew the course and method thereof.

At the extream change next before, I have
drawn a line between the figures, that next below
the line is the extream: The aforesaid
Peal may be Rang with any other whole hunt,
or half hunt; and also the Twenty-four
changes doubles and singles, may be made in
the
room
of the plain Twenty-four in the
aforesaid Peal.

Trebles and Doubles on six Bells.

There are many Peals of Trebles and
Doubles to be Rang on six bells, as, Six-score
changes, Seven-score and four, Twelve-score,
and Seven-hundred and twenty. In
each of which Peals, the changes that are
made from the time that the whole hunt leaves
the trebles place hunting up, until it comes
down into that place again, are all made in
one and the same manner, so that the only
difference in these Peals, consists in making
the changes when the whole hunt leads. These
Peals are called Trebles and Doubles, because
one is a treble change (that is, 3 changes made
together, in which all the six bells do change
their places, thus, 123456:214365:) and the
next is a double change between the 4 bells, in
the midst, thus, 241635: And in this course
the changes are alwayes made from the time
that the whole hunt leaves the trebles place
hunting up, until it comes down into the trebles
place again; and in Ringing this Peal, 'tis
observed, that every bell does hunt in a perfect
and direct course, and be twice together before,
and twice behind, until the whole hunt
leads.

The manner of Ringing the Seven-score
and four, is this; the treble and tenor are
both whole hunts, and the second is the half
hunt; the first change is a treble change, and
the next a double change, as I shewed you before;

in which course they are made, until the
treble leads again, and the tenor lie behind;
at which time there's a single change to be
made in third and fourths places: But when
the half hunt lies next to the treble, then the
next single change must be made in fourths and
fifths places, as in this following Peal, where I
have only set down part of it for an example.

This Peal is grounded on the Twenty-four
changes doubles and singles, the second, third,
fourth and fifth makes the Twenty-four changes;
the second bell is the hunt in the Twenty-four,
therefore the extream in the Peal next
before, is made between the two farthest extream
bells from it when it lies before them:
At the extream changes there's a line drawn
between the figures, but the extreams may be
made every time the second lies behind the extream
bells; or else, every time it lies before
and behind them, in the same manner, as I
told you before in my directions to the Twenty-four
Doubles and Singles: And this Peal

may be also Rang with any other whole hunts,
or half hunts.

In the Six-score Trebles and Doubles, the
changes are the same as in the Peal next before,
until the whole hunt leads, at which time (in
this Peal) there is a double change to be
made between the four hindmost bells; but
when the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt
lies next to it, then there is a single change to
be made, either between the two nearest bells
to the half hunt, or else between the two farthest
bells from it; there are but two single
changes in the Peal, and the second single
change must be made between those two bells
which made the first. In this following, the
treble is the whole hunt, and the second the
half hunt, and the first single change is made
when the bells do lie 124365: which is sixty
changes from the beginning of the Peal; after
the whole hunt has at first hunted up and down
again: I have set down only those changes
which are made every time the whole hunt
leads.

The course of the Twelve-score, and the
Seven-hundred and twenty, are both one and
the same; for the Twelve-score changes, are
only part of the Seven-hundred and twenty.
There's a whole hunt, a half hunt, a quarter
hunt, and three extream bells in the Seven-hundred
and twenty; the changes are all treble
and double (in the same course, as in the
Six-score next before set down) until the
whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies next
to it, at which time there's a single change to
be made in fourth and fifths places: But when
the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies
next to it, and the quarter hunt lies next to the
half hunt, then there's an extream to be made,
which is a single change, and made between
the two farthest extream bells from the quarter
hunt; and by observing this course, you may
prick down, or Ring the Seven-hundred and
twenty: But if you would only Ring Twelve-score
changes (and then end there, by bringing
the bells round) you must make no
extream change at all; for in making every single
change in fourth and fifths places, the bells
will come round in course at the end of
Twelve-score changes if you make no extream
change to carry the Peal forward. In the following
changes, the treble is the whole hunt,
the 2 is the half hunt, the 3 the quarter hunt,
and the 4, 5, and 6, are the extream bells. It
being not much material to set down this Peal
at large, therefore after the treble (which is the
whole hunt) has hunted twice up and down, I
have put down only the two changes which are
made every time the treble leads to the end of
the Twelve-score, as follows.

The last change is 123456: which is at the
end of Twelve-score changes; and here you
see, that the whole hunt, the half hunt, and
quarter hunt, do lie next to each other before
the extream bells; therefore the bells may either
be brought round, by making the single
change in the same place, as those next before,
are made thus, 123456: or else, if you would
proceed forward to the end of the Seven-hundred
and twenty, then the next must be an
extream change between the fourth and sixth,
which are the 2 hindmost bells, thus, 123564:
and by observing to make an extream change

behind every time the 1, 2, 3, lie together before
the bells, the bells will come round in
course at the end of the Seven-hundred and
twenty; at the end of every Three score changes,
there's a single change throughout the
Peal, and an extream change at the end of
every Twelve-score. This Peal (by the Rules
aforesaid) may be Rang with any whole hunt,
half hunt, and quarter hunt.

In this Peal is contained the Six-score changes
of Old Doubles on five bells, and also the
Twenty-four changes Doubles and Singles on
four bells; the half hunt, the quarter hunt, and
three extream bells, makes the Six-score changes
of Old Doubles in a perfect course; and
the quarter hunt, and three extream bells, do
make the Twenty-four changes Doubles and
Singles. Every time the whole hunt leads,
there are made two changes of the Six-score;
and every time the whole hunt leads, and the
half hunt lies next to it, there are two changes
mades in the Twenty-four.

Grandsire Bob
. On six Bells.

In this Peal of Grandsire Bob, there are
Seven-hundred and twenty changes, in Ringing
of which, there is the same course, as in
Trebles and Doubles (before set down) until
the bob-changes come to be made; this Peal
may more properly be called Trebles and Doubles
than the former, because all the changes
throughout the Seven-hundred and twenty,

are treble and double, except only the two single
changes: But in Ringing an Eighteen-score
(which is half the Seven-hundred and
twenty, and a complete Peal of it self) the
changes are all treble and double without any
single change therein; for you must know,
that in any Peal of Grandsire bob, the bells
will come round in course at the end of Eighteen-score
changes, if you make no single
change to carry it on farther to the end of the
Seven-hundred and twenty.

This Peal has a whole hunt, a half hunt, a
quarter hunt, and three extream bells; every
bell hunts in a direct course, and lies twice together
before, and twice behind, until the
whole hunt leads, and then the four hindmost
bells do dodge, that is, they make a double
change; in which 'tis alwayes observed, that
the two bells which lie in third and fifths places
(in the change next before the dodge) are
hunting down, and in making this double
change, each of those bells do dodge with the
bell next above it, that is, they move up over
one bell, and then each of them moves directly
down; and the two bells that lie in fourth
and tenors places in the change next before
every dodge, are hunting up, and in making
the dodge change, each of those bells do move
down under one bell, and then they move up
again in their course, as before; the dodge
changes in all Peals of Trebles and Doubles,
are made in the same manner as these.

There are two sorts of bobs in this Peal,

viz.
a single, and a double Bob; the Rule for
making the single bob, is this, when the whole

hunt leads, and the half hunt lies in tenors
place, and the quarter hunt in fourths place,
the next change is a bob; and when the whole
hunt leads, and the half hunt lies in fifths place,
and the quarter hunt in seconds place, then
there is a double bob, that is, two bob-changes;
one of which is made the next change,
and the other is made the next time the whole
hunt leads after. The bobs are all double
changes, and made in one and the same manner
(
i.e.
) the leading bell, and that in fourths
place, do both lie still, whil'st the two bells in
second and thirds places, and those in fifth and
tenors places make the bob-change; and as
soon as 'tis made, the bell in fourths place
moves directly down. The half hunt is alwayes
one of the two hindmost bells which
makes every bob-change.

In Ringing this Peal, there is a Rule observed,
whereby the person that does Ring the
quarter hunt, may give notice of the bobs before
they come to be made, without which it
were impossible to Ring it; the Rule is this:
In the dodge which is made between the four
hindmost bells every time the whole hunt
leads, if the half hunt and quarter hunt do
dodge in fifth and tenors place, then the next
time the whole hunt leads, there's a single
bob; if they dodge in fourth and thirds places,
then there's a double bob that is, two bob-changes,
one of which is made the next time,
the whole hunt leads after the dodge, and the
other is made the next time the whole hunt
leads after the former is made: He that does
Ring the quarter hunt, may give notice of every

bob-change, by saying (Bob) when the
whole hunt is going to lead, which is a change
next before the bob is to be made.

There are certain Rules very convenient to
be known by all that practise to Ring this Peal;
(
viz.
) he that does Ring the whole hunt,
must observe that the bell which he first follows
when he leaves the trebles place hunting
up, he must follow the same bell the next time
he lies behind; and the second bell which he
follows in hunting up, he must also follow the
same bell when he next leaves the tenors place
hunting down; and likewise, the third bell
which he follows in hunting up, he must also
follow the same bell when he leaves the fifths
place hunting down: For instance, in the first
change of the following Peal, the bells stand
thus: 214365: here the treble (being the
whole hunt) does first follow the second, therefore
when the treble has hunted up, and lies
behind, it follows the second again, as in this
change, 654321: And again, the second
change of the following Peal, is 241635: here
the
fourth
is the second bell, which the treble
follows in hunting up, therefore he follows that
bell again the next time he leaves the tenors
place hunting down, as in this change, 563412:
which course is observed throughout the Peal.
And in Ringing any other bell (beside the
whole Hunt) 'tis observed, that the next time
you lie before the bells after a bob, that bell
which you first follow in hunting up, you must
also follow the same bell when you lie behind;
and the same bell you must first follow every
time you hunt up, and every time you lie behind,

until the next bob comes to be made, but
if the whole hunt is the second bell which you
follow in hunting up, then you must follow the
whole Hunt when you lie behind; and the
next time you lead, and lie behind, you must
follow the former bell as before, until the bobs
come to be made; and after the bobs, the
course is the same (though you do not follow
the same bell) as before.

These Rules and Directions before set down,
are to be observed in Ringing any Peal of
Grandsire bob with any whole Hunt, half
Hunt, and quarter Hunt: An Example I have
here set down, wherein the treble is the whole
Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and the fourth
the quarter Hunt, as in these following
changes.

Here are just Eighteen-Score changes already
made, and the bells may either be brought
round in their places, by making a dodg-change
behind (according to the common course
)
, thus,

but to have proceeded forward in
the 720, the last should have been a

the single change being made, all the
following changes to the end of the
720 are to be made, by the same rule and
course as those before set down, the last change
of the 720 being also a single change, and to
be made in the same place, and between those
two bells which made the former single, thus,

which single change brings the bells

This Peal of Grandsire bob may be Rang
with any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter
Hunt; but there being some difficulty in
beginning many of the Peals, I have therefore
set down Directions for beginning each Peal,
as follows.

1.2.4

1.2.5

1.3.2

2.3.6

1.4.6

1.5.3

1.5.4

1.6.3

In Ringing Grandsire bob with any
of these eight Hunts, the first changes
in each Peal are to be made in
the same manner, as those in the
Peal before set down, until the first
bob in each Peal comes to be made.

1.2.3

1.2.6

1.3.5

1.4.2

1.4.5

With these five Hunts, the first change
in each Peal is a dodge between the
four hindmost bells: thus,

123456
124365

Each three figures that stand together next
before, do represent a whole Hunt, a half
Hunt, and quarter Hunt: for instance, the
uppermost figures in the first Column, are
1.2.4. there the treble is the whole Hunt, the
second the half Hunt, and the fourth the quarter
Hunt, and so of the rest.

In making the treble the whole Hunt, the
fifth the half Hunt, and the sixth the quarter
Hunt; the first change is a dodge between the
four hindmost bells, in which the half and
quarter Hunt do dodge together in fifth and
tenors places, therefore the next time the
whole hunt comes before the bells, there's a
single bob.

In ringing treble, tenor, and fifth, the
whole Hunt moves up the first change, thus
214365, and so on in the common course until
it comes next before the bells, at which time
there's a single bob.

In ringing treble, fourth, and third, the
whole Hunt moves up the first change, thus,
214365, and so forward in the common
course, until it leads again; at which time
there's a bob-change to be made, and another
the next time the whole Hunt leads after that,
it being a double bob.

In ringing treble, third, and fourth, the first

is a dodge-change between the four hindmost
bells, in which the half Hunt and quarter
Hunt do dodge together in third and fourths
places, therefore a double bob is next to be
made, one of which bob-changes is the next
time the whole Hunt leads, and the other the
next following. In ringing treble, fifth, and second,
the first is a bob-change; and the next
time the whole Hunt leads, there's another
bob-change, it being a double bob.

In Ringing treble, sixth, and second, and
treble, sixth, and fourth, the first change in
each of these two Peals is a bob.

2.4.6

5.3.4

6.1.2

5.3.1

With these four Hunts, the first change
is treble, and the next double, thus,
214365, and so on, till the whole
Hunt leads.

3.5.2

4.6.2

6.2.1

2.3.5

6.3.5

With these five Hunts, the first
change must be made between
the four bells in the midst, thus,
132546.

In Ringing tenor, treble, and second, there's
a single bob the first time the whole Hunt
comes before the bells.

In all Peals of Grandsire bob, where the
first change is either a bob, or a dodge between
the four hindmost bells, or else a double change
between the four bells in the midst, it must be
made at the back-stroke of the bells, otherwise
the Peal would cut compass all the way,
that is, every bell would come to lead at the
back-stroke.

In the Eighteen-score changes before set
down, there's a line drawn between the figures

at every bob, the changes next below each line
is a bob-change.

In the Seven-hundred and twenty changes
of Grandsire bob, there are two single changes
to be made. The first single change in any
Peal is most commonly made as near the end
of Eighteen-score changes (from the beginning)
as may be, and 'tis the best way, and
most convenient: For instance, sometimes it
happens that one or more of those persons who
do Ring this Peal, may be weary before they
have Rang Eighteen-score changes, therefore
upon notice given, the single change may be
forborn, and then the bells will in course come
round at the end of Eighteen-score changes,
making a complete Peal; but after the first
single change is made, the bells cannot be
brought round in course, until the Seven-hundred
and twenty are all made.

There is great variety in making the single
changes in each Peal, which may be made at
divers places (
viz.
)

The first single change in any Peal may be
made the second time the whole Hunt leads
after the last bob-change of the first or second
double bobs, at which places the whole Hunt,
half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, do alwayes lie
together before the bells, and the single change
is to be made in third and fourths places.

The first single change in any Peal may also
be made the second time the whole Hunt
leads after the first or second single bobs, at
which place the whole Hunt and half Hunt do
alwayes lie together before the bells; and
the quarter Hunt lies behind, therefore it

must be made between the two hindmost
bells.

Or if the first bob in any Peal is a double
bob, then the first single change may be made
the second time the whole Hunt leads after the
third double bob in that Peal, at which place
the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt
do lie together before the bells, and the single
is made in third and fourths places.

Or if the first bob in any Peal is a single
bob, then the first single change may be made
the second time the whole Hunt leads after the
third single bob, where the whole Hunt and
half Hunt do alwayes lie together before the
bells, and the quarter Hunt behind, therefore
the single change must be made behind.

The first single change in any Peal may also
be made either at the first, second, or third
single bobs, at which places the whole Hunt
leads, the half Hunt lies in tenors place, and
the quarter Hunt in fourths place, therefore it
must be made behind.

The first single change in any Peal may also
be made the next time the whole Hunt leads
after the last bob-change of the first or second
double bobs, at which place the whole Hunt,
and quarter Hunt do alwayes lie together before
the bells, and the half Hunt in fourths
place, therefore the single change must be
made in third and fourths places. And in
most Peals, the first single change may be made
the next time the whole Hunt leads after the
last bob-change of the third double bob; and
in some Peals, the first single change may be
made the second time the whole Hunt leads

after the third double bob (nothwithstanding
the first bob-change in that Peal is a single bob,
as in the Eighteen-score treble, second and
fourth before set down) which falls out according
as the first bob change happens to be
made either nearer the beginning of the Peal,
or farther from it; for in some Peals, the bells
will come round in course the next time the
whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of
the third double bob. And in many Peals, the
bells will come round at the fore-stroke the
second time the whole Hunt leads after the
last bob-change of the third double bob,
&c.

There are two single changes in every Seven-hundred
and twenty, which are alwayes made
when the whole Hunt leads, the last single
change in every Peal being constantly made
just Eighteen-score changes from the first; for
making of which, observe these Rules.

If the first single change (in any Peal) is
made the second time the whole Hunt leads
after a double bob, then the second single
change must be made the second time the
whole Hunt leads after the third double bob,
accounting from the place where the first single
change was made.

If the first single change in any Peal is made
the second time the whole Hunt leads after a
single bob, then the second single change must
be made the second time the whole Hunt leads
after the third single bob, accounting from the
place where the first single change was made.
Or if the first single change is made at a single
bob, then the second single change must be
made at the third single bob, accounting from

the place where the first single change was
made.

The second single change in every Peal must
be made between those two bells, and in the
same place where the first single change was
made; and the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and
quarter Hunt, will in course lie in the same
places at the second single change, where they
lay at the first: either the half Hunt, or
quarter Hunt, are alwayes one of the two bells
which makes every single change. But there
are many other wayes to make the single changes,

viz.
to make them between the half
Hunt, and quarter Hunt, at any dodge, where
those two bells do dodge together next before
a bob,
&c.
of which I need not say any thing
more in this place, having already set down
all those wayes which are most easie and convenient
to be practised.

In Ringing this Peal of Grandsire bob,
(with any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter
Hunt) if there's no single change made
within Eighteen-score changes from the beginning
of the Peal, the bells will in course
come round in their right places, just at the
end of Eighteen-score changes.

In any Peal of Grandsire bob, where the
first is a double change, and made at the back-stroke,
the last change of the Peal (which
brings the bells round in their right places)
is a treble change, and made at the fore-stroke.

The Seven-hundred and twenty changes of
Grandsire Bob may be Rang without making
any single change therein, which way of Ringing

it, is call'd
Grandsire Bob True
: that is,
the changes are all true trebles and doubles
without any single change therein. There are
made two double changes (contrary to the
course of all the double changes in the Peal)
to supply the place of the two single changes,
which two are called True changes; and to
be made divers wayes, and at several places.
The first true change in any Peal may be made
at the first, second, or third double bobs either
at the first or second bob-change of each. At
the first bob-change of any double bob it
may be made, by moving the Bell in fourths
place down under two Bells at once into the
seconds place, and the two hindmost Bells must
make a change at the same time: for Example,
in the Eighteen-score of treble, second and
fourth before set down, at the first bob-change
of the first double Bob, the Bells stand thus,
143526. Now the true change is made, by
moving the Bell which lies in fourths place
down under two Bells at once into seconds
place, and the two hindmost Bells are at the
same time to make a change thus, 154362.
At this place it may be made another way, by
moving the hindmost Bell down under two
Bells at once into the fourths place, and the
two Bells in second and thirds places are at
the same time to make a change thus, 134652.
At the last Bob-change of each double Bob, it
may also be made two wayes; one of which,
is to move the Bell in fourths down into the
seconds place, and the two hindmost Bells at
the same time to make a change, as I shewed
you before: But the best and easiest way is to

move the bell which lies in fourths place up
over two bells at once into the tenors place,
and the two bells in second and thirds places to
make a change as at a bob: for instance, at
the last bob-change of the first double bob in
the Eighteen-score before set down, the figures
stand thus, 143652. Now the bell in fourths
place must be moved up behind, and the two
bells in second and thirds places are to make
a change, 134526. The second True change in
every Peal must be made just Eighteen-score
changes from the first, in making of which, these
Rules are to be observed. If the first true change
in any Peal is made at the first bob-change of
a double bob, then the second true change must
be made at the first bob-change of the third
double bob, accounting from the place where
the first true change is made, but not reckoning
that for one of the three: or if the first true
change is made at the last bob-change of a
double bob, then the second true change must
be made at the last bob-change of the third
double bob, accounting from the place where
the first true change was made, but not reckoning
that for one of the three. And the second
true change in every Peal must be made in the
same manner and place as the first, the true and
single changes in Grandsire bob, are both to one
and the same effect (
i.e.
) to alter the course of
the extream bells; for in making these changes,
the whole hunt, half hunt, and quarter hunt are
to continue their constant course without variation,
neither of those 3 bells being any otherwise
concerned therein, than at the change
which should have been made, if the single or
true change had been forborn.

There is another way to Ring this Peal of
Grandsire Bob, by a course differing from the
former. When the whole Hunt leads, the
half Hunt lies in fifths place, and the quarter
Hunt in fourths place, then the next change is
a single bob; and when the whole Hunt leads,
and the half Hunt lies in fifths place, and the
quarter Hunt in thirds place, then the next
change is the first bob-change of a double
bob; the bobs and dodge-changes herein are
made in the same manner, as those in the former
way: But the bobs herein are called by a
Rule differing from the former,
viz.
when the
whole Hunt and half Hunt do lie together
before the bells, and the quarter Hunt (lying
in fourths place) dodges with the bell in
thirds place, then the second time the whole
Hunt comes before the bells (from that
place) there is made the first bob-change of
a double bob, the second bob-change being
made the next time the whole Hunt leads after.
When the whole Hunt and half Hunt,
do lie together before the bells, and the quarter
Hunt (lying in fifths place) dodges with
the bell in tenors place, then the second time
the whole Hunt leads (from that place) is
made a single bob.

There are two single changes in the Seven-hundred
and twenty, the first single change in
any Peal may be made at the first, second, or
third single bobs, at which places it must be
made between the 2 hindmost bells; or the first
single change may be made the next time the
whole Hunt leads after the first, second, or
third single bobs, at which places 'tis alwayes

made between the two hindmost bells. The
first single change may also be made the next
time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change
of the first, second, or third double
bobs, where it must alwayes be made in third
and fourths places. But in some few Peals it
happens, that the bells will come round at the
fore-stroke the next time the whole Hunt leads
after the third single bob, and also after the last
bob-change of the third double bob, which
falls out according as the first bob-change in
each Peal is made, either nearer the beginning,
or farther off.

The second single change (in every Peal)
must be made Eighteen-score changes from the
first, in making of which, these Rules must be
observed.

If the first single change is made at a single
bob, then the second single change must be
made at the third single bob from the place
where the first was made. Or if the first
single change is made the next time the whole
Hunt leads after a single bob, then the second
single change must be made the next time the
whole Hunt leads after the third single bob,
accounting from the place where the first single
change was made. And the same Rule is
observed in making it after a double bob.

The second single change in every Peal must
be made in the same place, and between those
two bells which made the first single change:
But (in Ringing this Peal) if you make no
single change, the bells will in course come
round at the end of Eighteen-score changes.

The way to begin several of these Peals, is
as follows.

In Ringing treble, third, and fifth; and second,
third, and fifth; and also third, fifth, and
second; the first change is treble, and the next
double, and so forward in the common course
of trebles and doubles, until the first Bob in
each comes to be made. In treble, second and
third, the first changes are treble and double in
the common course; and the second time the
treble leads, there's a double Bob. In treble,
tenor and second, the first changes are treble
and double in the common course; and the
second time the treble leads, there's a single
Bob. In treble, second and fifth, the first
change is a dodge between the four hindmost
Bells; and the second time the treble leads,
there's a single Bob. In second, fourth and
tenor, the first change is made between the
4 Bells in the midst. In treble, second and fourth,
the first change is a dodge behind; and the second
time the treble leads, there's a double Bob.

Changes on eight Bells.

There are 40320 several changes on 8 bells,
which to Ring it is altogether impossible;
the greatest Peal that ever was Rang on 8 Bells,
is 1680, being only a third part of the changes
on seven Bells, which are to be Rang with
a whole Hunt, half Hunt, quarter Hunt, half
quarter Hunt (for so you may term it) and
three extream Bells: But the most complete
and musical Peal that ever was Rang on eight
Bells, is Grandsire Bob, treble, second and fifth,
Half-pulls, on 1.2.3.5.6.7. the fourth and
the tenor lying behind every change, thus,
123567,48. which has of late been practised

by the
Colledge-Youths
, and excellently well
performed by them. Grandsire, and Tendring
Six-score on eight Bells makes good Musick,
7.4.8. lying behind every change: And a Six-score
(four extreams) on the six Bells in the
midst, the treble leading all the way, and the
tenor lying behind, making a change at first
between the 4 and 5, and then proceeds forwards
in the Six-score, making the second the
whole Hunt, and the seventh the half Hunt, it
makes excellent Musick; but after the Six-score
changes are made, the fourth and fifth must
change their places again to bring the Bells round.

35678,241

12357,864

12357,468

12357,648

12356,748

34567,218

45678,321

12368,574

The most musical Peals that are
commonly Rang on eight Bells,
are these Six-scores on five, the
other three Bells lying behind
every change: For example, the
uppermost fig. are 35678,241.
here the 35678, makes the Six-score
changes, 3 the whole hunt,
and 8 the half Hunt, or any others, and 241.
strikes behind every change, in the same order
as they now lie, and so of the rest. The three
Bells which are to lie behind, must first be hunted
up one after the other in order, before any
of the Six-score changes are made. The Seven-score
and four on the six middle Bells, the treble
leading, and the tenor lying behind every
change, makes good Musick.

Of Hanging Bells.

First, for the Stock, much need not be said,
but of placing the Cannons or Crown of

the Bell into it, which is called
Hanging of a
Bell
, I shall speak something: First, find out
whether the Cannons be upright and true, then
raise the Bell up by some Rope tyed to the Cannons,
and so that the Bell hang level, which
you may find, by applying a Plumet to the
brim, then fasten a string to the Crown-staple
within the Bell, then (a Plumet being tyed
to the other end of the string) if the string
hang in the midst between the two sides of the
Bell whereon the Clapper should strike, the
Crown-staple is cast into the Bell true: Now
when you have hung the Bell, and let the Gudgeons
in true by Keys (for therein consists the
main point of the going of a Bell) then if
the Clapper hang in the midst between the two
striking sides, and the Stock stand upright, the
Bell is well hung.

If a Bell have a longer stroke on the one
side, than the other, truss up that side which
hath the short stroke more, or let the other side
down, and put a piece or two of Leather in,
according to the stroke; but sometimes the
fault of the stroke is in the Sally, which you
may remedy, by tying the Fillet (or little Cord
about the rim of the Wheel, which causeth the
dancing of the Rope) nearer, or farther off
the main Spoke; nearer makes a short stroke,
farther off the Spoke, a long one.

And observe, that the trussing or taking up
of a great Bell far into the Stock by a notch,
makes the Bell go easier, and lie lighter at
hand (that is) when it is set, for the farther
the brim of the Bell is from the
centre
of gravity,
the
heavier it is: Now the centre
of gravity

is a supposed line drawn through the Stock
from one Gudgeon to the other; but note, if
you truss a Bell up, that the Crown-staple be
much above the Gudgeons, you must fasten a
false Eye to the Crown-staple, and to this false
Eye hang the Clapper, otherwise it will not
strike so freely: Now small Bells must be trussed
up short, for else the Bell hanging low, and
fetching a great Compass in the swing, and having
but little Compass in the brim, the Clapper
keeps along by the side of the Bell, and
gives no blow at all; but being hung short,
the Bell fetches a quick and short Compass,
equal to the bigness of the brim, and the Clapper
strikes well.

Now for the tempering of the Gudgeons, I
leave it to the judgment of the Workman; but
a word or two of the polishing of it. After
it is filed, or turned exactly round, take two
pieces of Oak, and oyl one side of each, and
strew fine Sand thereon, and clap them in a
Smiths Vice, with the round of the Gudgeon
between, then turn it about, until you think it
is sufficiently polished, then oyl the sides of the
pieces of Oak wherein there is no Sand, and
so clap them in a Vice, with the Gudgeon between,
as before, then turn it round, and it will
polish the Gudgeon wonderful smooth; and
if the Brasses are likewise well polished, the
Bell will go as well at the first, as ever: Now
by the neglect of this, the roughness of the
Gudgeon will wear the Brasses so unequally,
that the Bell will never go smooth and steddy.

Now I would advise all Bell hangers to
hang Bells with bolts of Iron to come from

the Cannons through the Stock, and to fasten
them with Keys at the top of the Stock, and
not with plates nailed on the sides; for they
are mighty inconvenient to fasten a bell that is
loose in the Stock, or to alter the stroke.

As for the Rowle, let it not be without, nor
within the hollow of the side of the Wheel;
nor above, nor below the hollow at the bottom
of the Wheel. Now the bigger a Wheel is,
if the Frame will permit, the bell will go
the better; when the wheel is new, nail Stays
from the Stock to each Spoke, to keep it from
warping.

'Tis very convenient (if the Frame will
permit) to fasten a piece of Timber about half
a foot long on the end of the main Spoke at
the top of the Wheel (whereon the end of
the bell-rope is fastned) with a notch on the
end of it; so at the setting of the bell, the
Rope will hit into that notch from the Rowle,
and this will make the bell lie easier at hand
when it is set, and flie better.

FINIS.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

AN INTRODUCTION

TO THE STUDY OF

THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

PART I.

GENERAL ETHNOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE.

CHAPTER I.

GERMANIC ORIGIN OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
—
DATE.

§ 1
. The first point to be remembered in the
history of the English language, is that it was not the primitive and
original tongue of any of the British Islands, nor yet of any portion of
them. Indeed, of the
whole
of Great Britain it is not the language
at the present moment. Welsh is spoken in Wales, Manks in the Isle of
Man, and Scotch Gaelic in the Highlands of Scotland; besides which there
is the Irish Gaelic in Ireland.

§ 2
. The next point to be considered is the real
origin and the real affinities of the English language.

Its
real
origin is on the continent of Europe, and its

real
affinities are with certain languages there spoken. To speak
more specifically, the native country of the
[2]
English language is

Germany
; and the
Germanic
languages are those that are the
most closely connected with our own. In Germany, languages and dialects
allied to each other and allied to the mother-tongue of the English have
been spoken from times anterior to history; and these, for most purposes
of philology, may be considered as the aboriginal languages and dialects
of that country.

§ 3
.
Accredited details of the different
immigrations from Germany into Britain.
—Until lately the
details of the different Germanic invasions of England, both in respect
to the particular tribes by which they were made, and the order in which
they succeeded each other, were received with but little doubt, and as
little criticism.

Respecting the tribes by which they were made, the current opinion
was, that they were chiefly, if not exclusively, those of the Jutes, the
Saxons, and the Angles.

The particular chieftains that headed each descent were also supposed
to be known, as well as the different localities upon which they
descended.
[
1
]

These were as follows:—

First settlement of invaders from Germany.
—The account of
this gives us
A.D.
449 for the first permanent
Germanic tribes settled in Britain. Ebbsfleet, in the Isle of Thanet, was
the spot where they landed; and the particular name that these tribes
gave themselves was that of
Jutes
. Their leaders were Hengist and
Horsa. Six years after their landing they had established the kingdom of
Kent; so that the county of Kent was the first district where the
original British was superseded by the mother-tongue of the present
English, introduced from Germany.
[3]

Second settlement of invaders from Germany.
—
A.D.
477 invaders from Northern Germany made the
second permanent settlement in Britain. The coast of Sussex was the spot
whereon they landed. The particular name that these tribes gave
themselves was that of
Saxons
. Their leader was Ella. They
established the kingdom of the South Saxons (Sussex or Suð-Seaxe); so
that the county of Sussex was the second district where the original
British was superseded by the mother-tongue of the present English,
introduced from Germany.

Third settlement of invaders from Germany.
—
A.D.
495 invaders from Northern Germany made the third
permanent settlement in Britain. The coast of Hampshire was the spot
whereon they landed. Like the invaders last mentioned, these tribes were
Saxons. Their leader was Cerdic. They established the kingdom of the West
Saxons (Wessex or West-Seaxe); so that the county of Hants was the third
district where the original British was superseded by the mother-tongue
of the present English, introduced from Germany.

Fourth settlement of invaders from Germany.
—
A.D.
530, certain Saxons landed in Essex, so that the
county of Essex [East-Seaxe] was the fourth district where the original
British was superseded by the mother-tongue of the present English,
introduced from Northern Germany.

Fifth settlement of invaders from Germany.
—These were

Angles
in Norfolk and Suffolk. The precise date of this settlement
is not known. The fifth district where the original British was
superseded by the mother-tongue of the present English was the counties
of Norfolk and Suffolk; the particular dialect introduced being that of
the
Angles
.

Sixth settlement of invaders from Germany.
—
A.D.
547 invaders from Northern Germany made the
sixth
[4]
permanent settlement in Britain. The
southeastern counties of Scotland, between the rivers Tweed and Forth,
were the districts where they landed. They were of the tribe of the
Angles, and their leader was Ida. The south-eastern parts of Scotland
constituted the sixth district where the original British was superseded
by the mother-tongue of the present English, introduced from Northern
Germany,

§ 4
. It would be satisfactory if these details
rested upon contemporary evidence. This, however, is far from being the
case.

1.
The evidence to the details just given, is not historical, but
traditional.
—
a.
Beda,
[
2
]
from whom it is chiefly taken, wrote nearly
300 years after the supposed event,
i.e.
, the landing of Hengist
and Horsa, in
A.D.
449.

b.
The nearest approach to a contemporary author is
Gildas,
[
3
]
and

he
wrote full 100 years after it.

2.
The account of Hengist's and Horsa's landing, has elements which
are fictional rather than historical
—
a.
Thus "when we
find Hengist and Horsa approaching the coasts of Kent in three keels, and
Ælli effecting a landing in Sussex with the same number, we are reminded
of the Gothic tradition which carries a migration of Ostrogoths,
[
4
]
Visigoths, and Gepidæ,
also in three vessels, to the mouth of the Vistula."—Kemble,
"Saxons in England."

b.
The murder of the British chieftains by Hengist is told

totidem verbis
, by Widukind
[
5
]
and others, of the Old Saxons in
Thuringia.

c.
Geoffry of Monmouth
[
6
]
relates also, how "Hengist obtained from
the Britons as much land as could be enclosed by an ox-hide; then,
cutting the hide into thongs, enclosed a much larger space than the
granters intended, on which he erected Thong Castle—a tale too
[5]
familiar to
need illustration, and which runs throughout the mythus of many nations.
Among the Old Saxons, the tradition is in reality the same, though
recorded with a slight variety of detail. In their story, a lapfull of
earth is purchased at a dear rate from a Thuringian; the companions of
the Saxon jeer him for his imprudent bargain; but he sows the purchased
earth upon a large space of ground, which he claims, and, by the aid of
his comrades, ultimately wrests it from the Thuringians."—Kemble,
"Saxons in England."

3.
There is direct evidence in favour of their having been German
tribes in England anterior to

A.D.

447.—
a.
At the close of the Marcomannic war,
[
7
]
Marcus Antoninus
transplanted a number of Germans into Britain.

b.
Alemannic auxiliaries served along with Roman legions under
Valentinian.
[
8
]

c.

The Notitia utriusque Imperii
,
[
9
]
of which the latest date
is half a century earlier than the epoch of Hengist, mentions, as an
officer of state, the
Comes littoris Saxonici per Britannias
; his
government extending along the coast from Portsmouth to the Wash.

§ 5
.
Inference.
—As it is nearly
certain, that 449
A.D.
is
not
the date
of the first introduction of German tribes into Britain, we must consider
that the displacement of the original British began at an
earlier

period than the one usually admitted, and, consequently, that it was more

gradual
than is usually supposed.

Perhaps, if we substitute the middle of the
fourth
, instead of
the middle of the
fifth
century, as the epoch of the Germanic
immigrations into Britain, we shall not be far from the truth.

[6]

CHAPTER II.

GERMANIC ORIGIN OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
—
THE GERMANIC AREA OF THE PARTICULAR GERMANS WHO INTRODUCED IT.
—
EXTRACT FROM BEDA.

§ 6
. Out of the numerous tribes and nations of
Germany,
three
have been more especially mentioned as the chief,
if not the exclusive, sources of the present English population of Great
Britain. These are the
Jutes
, the
Saxons
, and the

Angles
.

§ 7
. Now, it is by no means certain that this was
the case. On the contrary, good reasons can be given for believing that
the Angles and Saxons were the same people, and that no such nation as
the
Jutes
ever left Germany to settle in Great Britain.

§ 8
. The chief authority for the division of the
German invaders into the three nations just mentioned is Beda; and the
chief text is the following extract from his "Ecclesiastical History." It
requires particular attention, and will form the basis of much criticism,
and frequently be referred to.

"Advenerunt autem de tribus Germaniæ populis fortioribus, id est
Saxonibus, Anglis, Jutis. De Jutarum origine sunt Cantuarii, et
Victuarii, hoc est ea gens quæ Vectam tenet insulam et ea quæ usque hodie
in provincia Occidentalium Saxonum Jutarum natio nominatur, posita contra
ipsam insulam Vectam. De
[7]
Saxonibus, id est, ea regione quæ nunc
Antiquorum Saxonum cognominatur, venere Orientales Saxones, Meridiani
Saxones, Occidui Saxones. Porro de Anglis hoc est de illa patria quæ
Angulus dicitur, et ab illo tempore usque hodie manere desertus inter
provincias Jutarum et Saxonum perhibetur, Orientales Angli, Mediterranei
Angli, Merci, tota Northanhymbrorum progenies, id est illarum gentium quæ
ad Boream Humbri fluminis inhabitant, cæterique Anglorum populi sunt
orti"—"Historia Ecclesiastica," i. 15.

§ 9
. This was written about
A.D.
731, 131 years after the introduction of
Christianity, and nearly 300 after the supposed landing of Hengist and
Horsa in
A.D.
449.

It is the first passage which contains the names of either the

Angles
or the
Jutes
. Gildas, who wrote more than 150 years
earlier, mentions only the
Saxons
—"ferocissimi illi nefandi
nominis
Saxones
."

It is, also, the passage which all subsequent writers have either
translated or adopted. Thus it re-appears in Alfred, and again in the
Saxon Chronicle.
[
10
]

"Of Jotum comon Cantware
and Wihtware, þæt is seo
mæiað þe nú eardaþ on Wiht,
and þæt cynn on West-Sexum
ðe man gyt hæt Iútnacyun.
Of Eald-Seaxum comon Eást-Seaxan,
and Suð-Seaxan and
West-Seaxan. Of Angle comon
(se á siððan stód westig
betwix Iútum and Seaxum)
Eást-Engle, Middel-Angle,
Mearce, and ealle Norðymbra."

From the Jutes came the inhabitants
of Kent and of Wight,
that is, the race that now dwells
in Wight, and that tribe amongst
the West-Saxons which is yet
called the Jute tribe. From the
Old-Saxons came the East-Saxons,
and South-Saxons, and West-Saxons.
From the Angles, land
(which has since always stood
waste betwixt the Jutes and Saxons)
came the East-Angles, Middle-Angles,
Mercians, and all the
Northumbrians.

[8]

§ 10
. A portion of these extracts will now be
submitted to criticism; that portion being the statement concerning the

Jutes
.

The words
usque hodie—Jutarum natio nominatur
constitute
contemporary and unexceptionable evidence to the existence of a people
with a name like that of the
Jutes
in the time of Beda—or

A.D.
731.

The exact name is not so certain. The term
Jutnacyn
from the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is in favour of the notion that it began with the
sounds of
j
and
u
, in other words that it was

Jut
.

But the term
Geatum
, which we find in Alfred, favours the form
in
g
followed by
ea
.

Thirdly, the forms
Wihtware
, and
Wihttan
, suggest the
likelihood of the name being
Wiht
.

Lastly, there is a passage in Asserius
[
11
]
which gives us the form

Gwith
—"Mater" (of Alfred the Great) "quoque ejusdem Osburgh
nominabatur, religiosa nimium fœmina, nobilis ingenio, nobilis et
genere; quæ erat filia Oslac famosi pincernæ Æthelwulf regis; qui Oslac
Gothus erat natione, ortus enim erat de Gothis et Jutis; de semine
scilicet Stuf et Wihtgur, duorum fratrum et etiam comitum, qui acceptâ
potestate Vectis insulæ ab avunculo suo Cerdic rege et Cynric filio suo,
consobrino eorum, paucos Britones ejusdem insulæ accolas, quos in eâ
invenire potuerant, in loco qui dicitur,
Gwithgaraburgh

occiderunt, cæteri enim accolæ ejusdem insulæ ante sunt occisi aut exules
aufugerant."—Asserius, "De Gestis Alfredi Regis."

Now,
Gwith-gara-burgh
means the
burg
or
town of

the
With-ware
;
[
12
]
these being, undoubtedly, no Germans at
all, but the native Britons of the Isle of Wight (Vectis), whose
designation in Latin would be
Vecticolæ
or
Vectienses
.
[9]

This being the case, how can they be descended from German or Danish

Jutes
? and how can we reconcile the statement of Beda with that of
Asser?

§ 11
. The answer to this will be given after
another fact has been considered.

Precisely the same confusion between the sounds of
w
,
j
,

g
,
io
,
eæ
,
u
, and
i
, which occurs with
the so-called
Jutes
of the Isle of Wight, occurs with the
Jutlanders of the peninsula of Jutland. The common forms are

Jutland
,
Jute
,
Jutones
, and
Jutenses
, but
they are not the only ones. In
A.D.
952, we
find "Dania cismarina quam
Vitland
incolæ
appellant."—"Annales Saxonici."
[
13
]

§ 12
. Putting these facts together I adopt the
evidence of Asser as to the
Gwithware
being British, and consider
them as simple
Vecti-colæ
, or inhabitants of the Isle of

Wight
. They are also the
Vectuarii
of Beda, the

Wihtware
of the Saxon Chronicle, and the
Wihtsætan
of
Alfred.

The Jutes of Hampshire—
i.e.
, the "Jutarum
natio—posita contra ipsam insulam Vectam," and the
Jutnacyn
,
I consider to have been the same; except that they had left the Isle of
Wight to settle on the opposite coast; probably flying before their
German conquerors, in which case they would be the
exules
of
Asser.

The statement of Beda, so opposed to that of Asser, I explain by
supposing that it arose out of an inaccurate inference drawn from the
similarity of the names of the Isle of Wight and the peninsula of
Jutland, since we have seen that in both cases, there was a similar
confusion between the syllables
Jut-
and
Vit-
. This is an
error into which even a careful writer might fall. That Beda had no
authentic historical accounts of the conquest of Britain, we know from
his own statements in the Preface to his Ecclesiastical History,
[
14
]
and that he
[10]
partially
tried to make up for the want of them by inference is exceedingly likely.
If so, what would be more natural than for him to conclude that Jutes as
well as Angles helped to subdue the country. The fact itself was
probable; besides which he saw at one and the same time, in England

Vitæ
(called also
Jutæ
), in immediate contact with

Saxons
,
[26]
and on the continent
Jutæ

(called also
Vitæ
) in the neighborhood of Angles
[27]
and Saxons.
Is it surprising that he should connect them?

§ 13
. If the inhabitants of the Isle of Wight
were really
Jutes
from
Jutland
, it is strange that there
should be no traces of the difference which existed, then as now, between
them and the proper Anglo-Saxons—a difference which was neither
inconsiderable nor of a fleeting nature.

The present Jutlanders are not Germans but Danes, and the Jutes of the
time of Beda were most probably the same. Those of the 11th century were

certainly
so, "Primi ad ostium Baltici Sinus in australi ripa
versus nos
Dani, quos Juthas appellant
, usque ad Sliam lacum
habitant." Adamus Bremensis,
[
15
]
"De Situ Daniæ" c. 221. Also, "Et prima
pars Daniæ, quæ Jutland dicitur, ad Egdoram
[28]
in Boream longitudine pretenditur
... in eum angulum qui Windila dicitur, ubi Jutland finem habet," c.
208.

At the time of Beda they must, according to the received traditions,
have been nearly 300 years in possession of the Isle of Wight, a locality
as favourable for the preservation of their peculiar manners and customs
as any in Great Britain, and a locality wherein we have no evidence of
their ever having been disturbed. Nevertheless, neither trace nor shadow
of a trace, either
[11]
in early or modern times, has ever been
discovered of their separate nationality and language; a fact which
stands in remarkable contrast with the very numerous traces which the
Danes of the 9th and 10th century left behind them as evidence of their
occupancy.

§ 14
. The words
England
and
English

are derived from the
Angles
of Beda. The words
Sussex
,

Essex
,
Middlesex
and
Wessex
, from his
Saxons
.
No objection lies against this; indeed to deny that populations called

Angle
and
Saxon
occupied
England
and spoke the

Anglo-Saxon
language would display an unnecessary and unhealthy
scepticism. The real question concerning these two words consists in the
relation which the populations to which they were applied bore to each
other. And this question is a difficult one. Did the Angles speak one
language, whilst the Saxons spoke another? or did they both speak
dialects of the same tongue? Were these dialects slightly or widely
different? Can we find traces of the difference in any of the present
provincial dialects? Are the idioms of one country of Angle, whilst those
of another are of Saxon origin? Was the Angle more like the Danish
language, whilst the Saxon approached the Dutch? None of these questions
can be answered at present. They have, however, been asked for the sake
of exhibiting the nature of the subject.

§ 15
. The extract from Beda requires further
remarks.

The Angles of Beda.
—The statement of Beda respecting the
Angles, like his statement concerning the Jutes, reappears in the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and in Alfred.

Ethelweard
[
16
]
also adopts it:—"
Anglia
vetus
sita est inter Saxones et Giotos, habens oppidum capitale quod

[12]
sermone Saxonico
Sleswic
nuncupatur,
secundum vero Danos
Hathaby
."

Nevertheless, it is exceptionable and unsatisfactory; and like the
previous one, in all probability, an incorrect inference founded upon the
misinterpretation of a name.

In the eighth century there
was
, and at the present moment
there
is
, a portion of the duchy of Sleswick called
Anglen

or
the corner
. It is really what its name denotes, a triangle of
irregular shape, formed by the Slie, the firth of Flensborg, and a line
drawn from Flensborg to Sleswick. It is just as Danish as the rest of the
peninsula, and cannot be shown to have been occupied by a Germanic
population at all. Its area is less than that of the county of Rutland,
and by no means likely to have supplied such a population as that of the
Angles of England. The fact of its being a desert at the time of Beda is
credible; since it formed a sort of
March
or
Debatable
Ground
between the Saxons and Slavonians of Holstein, and the Danes
of Jutland.

Now if we suppose that the real Angles of Germany were either so
reduced in numbers as to have become an obscure tribe, or so incorporated
with other populations as to have lost their independent existence, we
can easily see how the similarity of name, combined with the geographical
contiguity of Anglen to the Saxon frontier, might mislead even so good a
writer as Beda, into the notion that he had found the country of the

Angles
in the
Angulus
(Anglen) of Sleswick.

The true
Angles
were the descendants of the
Angli
of
Tacitus. Who these were will be investigated in §§
47
-
54
.

§ 16
.
The Saxons of Beda.
—The Saxons
of Beda reached from the country of the Old Saxons
[29]
on the
[13]
Lippe, in Westphalia, to
that of the Nordalbingian
[30]
Saxons between the Elbe and Eyder;
and nearly, but not quite, coincided with the present countries of
Hanover, Oldenburg, Westphalia, and part of Holstein. This we may call
the
Saxon
, or (as reasons will be given for considering that it
nearly coincided with the country of the Angles) the
Anglo-Saxon

area.

§ 17
.
River-system and sea-board of the
Anglo-Saxon area.
—As the invasion of England took place by sea,
we must expect to find in the invaders a maritime population. This leads
to the consideration of the physical character of that part of Germany
which they occupied. And here comes a remarkable and unexpected fact. The
line of coast between the Rhine and Elbe, the line which in reasoning

a priori
, we should fix upon as the most likely tract for the bold
seamen who wrested so large an island as Great Britain from its original
occupants (changing it from
Britain
to
England
), to have
proceeded from, is
not
the country of the Anglo-Saxons. On the
contrary, it is the country of a similar but different section of the
Germanic population, a section which has not received the attention from
the English historian which it deserves. The country in question is the
area of—

§ 18
.
The Frisians.
—At the present
moment the language of the Dutch province of Friesland is materially
different from that of the other parts of the kingdom of Holland. In
other words it is not Dutch. Neither is it German—although, of
course, it resembles both languages. On the other hand, it is more like
the English than any other language or dialect in Germany is.

It is a language of considerable antiquity, and
[14]
although at present it is
spoken by the country-people only, it possesses a considerable
literature. There is the
Middle
Frisian of Gysbert
Japicx,
[
17
]
and
the
Old
Frisian of the Frisian Laws.
[
18
]
The older the specimen of the Frisian
language the more closely does it show its affinity to the English; hence
the earliest Frisian and the Anglo-Saxon are exceedingly alike.
Nevertheless they differ.

§ 19
. The Frisian was once spoken over a far
greater area than at present. It was the original language of almost all
Holland. It was the language of East Friesland to a late period. It was,
probably, the language of the ancient Chauci. At the present time
(besides Friesland) it survives in Heligoland, in the islands between the
Ems and Weser, in part of Sleswick, and in a few localities in Oldenburg
and Westphalia.

Hence it is probable that the original Frisian, extending to an
uncertain and irregular distance inland, lay between the Saxons and the
sea, and stretched from the Zuyder Zee to the Elbe; a fact which would
leave to the latter nation the lower Elbe and the Weser as their
water-system: the extent to which they were in direct contact with the
ocean being less than we are prepared to expect from their subsequent
history.

On the other hand the
a priori
probabilities of there being
Frisians as well as Anglo-Saxons amongst the conquerors of Great Britain
are considerable.—See §§
55
,
56
.

§ 20
. The Anglo-Saxon area coincided—

1.
Politically.
—With the kingdom of Hanover, the duchy of
Oldenburg, and parts of Westphalia and Holstein.

2.
Physically.
—With the basin of the Weser.

It was
certainly
from the Anglo-Saxon, and
probably

[15]
from a
part of the Frisian area that Great Britain was first invaded.

This is as much as it is safe to say at present. The preceding chapter
investigated the
date
of the Germanic migration into Britain; the
present has determined the
area
from which it went forth.

[16]

CHAPTER III.

OF THE DIALECTS OF THE SAXON AREA, AND OF THE SO-CALLED OLD SAXON.

§ 21
. The area occupied by the Saxons of Germany
has been investigated; and it now remains to ask, how far the language of
the occupants was absolutely identical throughout, or how far it fell
into dialects or sub-dialects.

There were at least
two
divisions of the Saxon; (1st) the Saxon
of which the extant specimens are of English origin, and (2nd), the Saxon
of which the extant specimens are of Continental origin. We will call
these at present the Saxon of England, and the Saxon of the
Continent.

§ 22
. Respecting the Saxon of England and the
Saxon of the Continent, there is good reason for believing that the

first
was spoken in the
northern
, the
second
in the

southern
portion of the Saxon area,
i.e.
, the one in
Hanover and the other in Westphalia, the probable boundaries between them
being the line of highlands between Osnaburg and Paderborn.

§ 23
. Respecting the Saxon of England and the
Saxon of the Continent, there is good reason for believing that, whilst
the
former
was the mother-tongue of the Angles and the conquerors
of England, the
latter
was that of the Cherusci of Arminius, the
conquerors and the annihilators of the legions of Varus.
[

§ 24
. Respecting the Saxon of England and the

[17]
Saxon of the Continent, it is a fact that,
whilst we have a full literature in the former, we have but fragmentary
specimens of the latter—these being chiefly the following: (1) the
Heliand,
[
20
]
(2)
Hildubrand and Hathubrant,
[
21
]
(3) the Carolinian Psalms.

§ 25
. The preceding points have been predicated
respecting the difference between the two ascertained Saxon dialects, for
the sake of preparing the reader for the names by which they are
known.

THE SAXON OF THE CONTINENT

1. Continental Saxon.
Insular Saxon.

2. German Saxon.
English Saxon.

3. Westphalian Saxon.
Hanoverian Saxon.

4. South Saxon.
North Saxon.

5. Cheruscan Saxon.

[

§ 26
. The Saxon of England
is
called
Anglo-Saxon; a term against which no exception can be raised.

§ 27
. The Saxon of the Continent
used
to
be called
Dano
-Saxon, and
is
called
Old
Saxon.

§ 28
.
Why called

Dano
-Saxon.
—When the poem called
Heliand
was
first discovered in an English library, the difference in language
between it and the common Anglo-Saxon composition was accounted for by
the assumption of a
Danish
intermixture.

§ 29
.
Why called
Old
Saxon.
When
the Continental origin of the
Heliand
was recognised, the language
was called
Old
Saxon, because it represented the Saxon of the
mother-country, the natives of which were called
Old
Saxons by the

Anglo
-Saxons themselves. Still the term is exceptionable; as the
Saxon of the Heliand is probably a
sister
-dialect of the

Anglo
-Saxon, rather
than
the
Anglo
-Saxon itself in a Continental locality.
Exceptionable, however, as it is, it will be employed.

CHAPTER IV.

AFFINITIES OF THE ENGLISH WITH THE LANGUAGES OF GERMANY AND SCANDINAVIA.

§ 30
. Over and above those languages of Germany
and Holland which were akin to the dialects of the Anglo-Saxons, cognate
languages were spoken in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and the Feroe
isles,
i.e.
, in Scandinavia.

§ 31
. The general collective designation for the
Germanic tongues of Germany and Holland, and for the Scandinavian
languages of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and the Feroe Isles, is
taken from the name of those German tribes who, during the decline of the
Roman Empire, were best known to the Romans as the
Goths
; the term

Gothic
for the Scandinavian and Germanic languages, collectively,
being both current and convenient.

§ 32
. Of this great
stock
of languages the
Scandinavian is one
branch
; the Germanic, called also Teutonic,
another.

§ 33
. The Scandinavian branch of the Gothic stock
comprehends, 1. The dialects of Scandinavia Proper,
i.e.
, of
Norway and Sweden; 2. of the Danish isles and Jutland; 3. of Iceland; 4.
of the Feroe Isles.

§ 34
. The Teutonic branch falls into three
divisions:—

1. The Mœso-Gothic.

2. The High Germanic.

[19]

3. The Low Germanic.

§ 35
. It is in the Mœso-Gothic that the
most ancient specimen of any Gothic tongue has been preserved. It is also
the Mœso-Gothic that was spoken by the conquerors of ancient Rome;
by the subjects of Hermanric, Alaric, Theodoric, Euric, Athanaric, and
Totila.

In the reign of Valens, when pressed by intestine wars, and by the
movements of the Huns, the Goths were assisted by that emperor, and
settled in the Roman province of Mœsia.

Furthermore, they were converted to Christianity; and the Bible was
translated into their language by their Bishop Ulphilas.

Fragments of this translation, chiefly from the Gospels, have come
down to the present time; and the Bible translation of the Arian Bishop
Ulphilas, in the language of the Goths of Mœsia, during the reign
of Valens, exhibits the earliest sample of any Gothic tongue.

§ 36
. The Old High German, called also
Francic
[
24
]
and
Alemannic,
[
25
]

was spoken in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries, in Suabia,
Bavaria, and Franconia.

The Middle High German ranges from the thirteenth century to the
Reformation.

§ 37
. The low Germanic division, to which the
Anglo-Saxon belongs, is currently said to comprise six languages, or
rather four languages in different stages.

I. II.—The Anglo-Saxon and Modern English.

III. The Old Saxon.

IV. V.—The Old Frisian and Modern Dutch.

VI.—The Platt-Deutsch, or Low German.

§ 38
.
The Frisian and Dutch.
—It is a
current statement that the Old Frisian bears the same relation to the
Modern Dutch of Holland that the Anglo-Saxon does to the English.
[20]

The truer view of the question is as follows:—

1. That a single language, spoken in two dialects, was originally
common to both Holland and Friesland.

2. That from the northern of these dialects we have the Modern Frisian
of Friesland.

3. From the southern, the Modern Dutch of Holland.

The reason of this refinement is as follows:—

The Modern Dutch has certain grammatical forms
older
than those
of the old Frisian;
e.g.
, the Dutch infinitives and the Dutch weak
substantives, in their oblique cases, end in
-en
; those of the Old
Frisian in
-a
: the form in
-en
being the older.

The true Frisian is spoken in few and isolated localities. There
is—

1. The Frisian of the Dutch state called Friesland.

2. The Frisian of the parish of Saterland, in Westphalia.

3. The Frisian of Heligoland.

4. The North Frisian, spoken in a few villages of Sleswick. One of the
characters of the North Frisian is the possession of a dual number.

In respect to its stages, we have the Old Frisian of the Asega-bog,
the Middle Frisian of Gysbert Japicx,
[31]
and the Modern Frisian of the
present Frieslanders, Westphalians, and Heligolanders.

§ 39
.
The Low German and
Platt-Deutsch.
—The words
Low-German
are not only lax in
their application, but they are
equivocal
; since the term has two
meanings, a
general
meaning when it signifies a division of the
Germanic languages, comprising English, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Old Saxon,
and Frisian, and a limited one when it means the particular dialects of
the Ems, the Weser, and the Elbe. To avoid this the dialects in question

[21]
are
conveniently called by their continental name of
Platt-Deutsch
,
just as in England we say
Broad
Scotch.

§ 40
. The most characteristic difference between
the Saxon and Icelandic (indeed between the Teutonic and Scandinavian
tongues) lies in the peculiar position of the definite article in the
latter. In Saxon, the article corresponding with the modern word

the
, is
þæt
,
se
,
seó
, for the neuter,
masculine, and feminine genders respectively; and these words, regularly
declined, are
prefixed
to the words with which they agree, just as
is the case with the English and with the majority of languages. In
Icelandic, however, the article instead of preceding,
follows
its
noun,
with which it coalesces
, having previously suffered a change
in form. The Icelandic article corresponding to
þæt
,
se
,

seó
, is
hitt
,
hinn
,
hin
: from this the

h
is ejected, so that, instead of the regular inflection
(
a
), we have the forms (
b
).

In the Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish this peculiarity in the position
of the definite article is preserved. Its origin, however, is concealed;
and an accidental identity with the indefinite article has led to false
notions respecting its nature. In the languages in point the
i
is
changed into
e
, so that what in Icelandic is
it
and

in
, is in Danish
et
and
en
.
En
, however, as a
separate word, is the numeral
one
, and also the indefinite article

a
; whilst in the neuter gender it is
et
—en sol,
a
sun
; et bord,
a table
: solon,
the sun
; bordet,
the
table
. From modern forms like those just quoted, it has been imagined
that the definite is merely the indefinite article transposed. This it is
not.

To apply an expression of Mr. Cobbet's,
en
=
a
, and

-en
=
the
, are
the same combination of letters, but not
the same word
.

§ 41
. Another characteristic of the Scandinavian
language is the possession of a
passive
form, or a
passive

voice, ending in
-st
:—
ek
,
þu
,
hann
brennist
=
I am
,
thou art
,
he is burnt
;
ver
brennumst
=
we are burnt
;
þér brennizt
=
ye are
burnt
;
þeir brennast
=
they are burnt
. Past tense,

ek
,
þu
,
hann brendist
;
ver brendumst
,
þér
brenduzt
,
þeir brendust
. Imperat.:
brenstu
=
be thou
burnt
. Infinit.:
brennast
=
to be burnt
.
[23]

In the modern Danish and Swedish, the passive is still preserved, but
without the final
t
. In the
older
stages of Icelandic, on
the other hand, the termination was not
-st
but
-sc
; which

-sc
grew out of the reflective pronoun
sik
. With these
phenomena the Scandinavian languages give us the evolution and
development of a passive voice; wherein we have the following series of
changes:—1. the reflective pronoun coalesces with the verb, whilst
the sense changes from that of a reflective to that of a middle verb; 2.
the
c
changes to
t
, whilst the middle sense passes into a
passive one; 3.
t
is dropped from the end of the word, and the
expression that was once reflective then becomes strictly passive.

Now the Saxons have no passive voice at all. That they should have one

originating
like that of the Scandinavians was impossible,
inasmuch as they had no reflective pronoun, and, consequently, nothing to
evolve it from.

[24]

CHAPTER V.

ANALYSIS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
—
GERMANIC ELEMENTS.
—
THE ANGLES.

§ 42
. The language of England has been formed out
of three elements.

a.
Elements referable to the original British population, and
derived from times anterior to the Anglo-Saxon invasion.

b.
Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, or imported elements.

c.
Elements introduced since the Anglo-Saxon conquest.

§ 43
. Each of these requires a special analysis,
but that of the second will be taken first, and form the contents of the
present chapter.

All that we have at present learned concerning the Germanic invaders
of England, is the geographical area which they originally occupied. How
far, however, it was simple Saxons who conquered England single-handed,
or how far the particular Saxon Germans were portions of a complex
population, requires further investigation. Were the Saxons one division
of the German population, whilst the Angles were another? or were the
Angles a section of the Saxons, so that the latter was a generic term
including the former? Again, although the Saxon invasion may be the one
which has had the greatest influence, and drawn the most attention, why
may there not have been separate and independent migrations, the
[25]
effects
and record of which have, in the lapse of time, become fused with those
of the more important divisions?

§ 44
.
The Angles; who were they? and what was
their relation to the Saxons?
—The first answer to this question
embodies a great fact in the way of internal evidence,
viz.
, that
they were the people from whom
England
derives the name it bears =

Angle land
, i.e.,
land of the Angles
. Our language too is

English
, i.e.,
Angle
. Whatever, then, they may have been on
the Continent, they were a leading section of the invaders here. Why then
has their position in our inquiries been hitherto so subordinate to that
of the Saxons? It is because their importance and preponderance are not
so manifest in Germany as we infer them to have been in Britain. Nay
more, their historical place amongst the nations of Germany, is both
insignificant and uncertain; indeed, it will be seen from the sequel,
that
in and of themselves
we know next to nothing about them,
knowing them only in their
relations
,
i.e.
, to ourselves
and to the Saxons.

§ 45
. Although they are the section of the
immigration which gave the name to England, and, as such, the
preponderating element in the eyes of the present
English
, they
were not so in the eyes of the original British; who neither knew at the
time of the Conquest, nor know now, of any other name for their German
enemies but
Saxon
. And
Saxon
is the name by which the
present English are known to the Welsh, Armorican, and Gaelic Celts.

Welsh
Saxon
.

Armorican
Soson
.

Gaelic
Sassenach
.

§ 46
. Although they are the section of the
immigration which gave the name to
England
, &c., they were
quite as little Angles as Saxons in the eyes of foreign
[26]
cotemporary
writers; since the expression
Saxoniæ transmarinæ
, occurs as
applied to England.

§ 47
.
Who were the Angles?
—Although
they are the section of the immigration which gave the name to

England
, &c., the notices of them as Germans in Germany, are
extremely limited.

Extract from Tacitus.
—This merely connects them with
certain other tribes, and affirms the existence of certain religious
ordinances common to them:—

"Contra Langobardos paucitas nobilitat: plurimis ac valentissimis
nationibus cincti, non per obsequium sed prœliis et periclitando
tuti sunt. Reudigni deinde, et Aviones, et
Angli
, et Varini, et
Eudoses, et Suardones, et Nuithones, fluminibus aut silvis muniuntur: nec
quidquam notabile in singulis, nisi quod in commune Herthum, id est,
Terram matrem colunt, eamque intervenire rebus hominum, invehi populis,
arbitrantur. Est in insula Oceani Castum nemus, dicatumque in eo
vehiculum, veste contectum, attingere uni sacerdoti concessum. Is adesse
penetrali deam intelligit, vectamque bobus feminis multâ cum veneratione
prosequitur. Læti tunc dies, festa loca, quæcumque adventu hospitioque
dignatur. Non bella ineunt, non arma sumunt, clausum omne ferrum; pax et
quies tunc tantùm nota, tunc tantùm amata, donec idem sacerdos satiatam
conversatione mortalium deam templo reddat; mox vehiculum et vestes, et,
si credere velis, numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur. Servi ministrant,
quos statim idem lacus haurit. Arcanus hinc terror, sanctaque ignorantia,
quid sit id, quod tantùm perituri vident."
[32]

Extract from Ptolemy.
—This connects the Angles with the

Suevi
, and
Langobardi
, and places them on the Middle
[27]
Elbe.—
Ἐντὸς καὶ

μέγιστα μέν

.

Extract from Procopius.
—For this see §
55
.

Heading of a law referred to the age of Charlemagne.
—This
connects them with the Werini (Varni) and the Thuringians—"Incipit
lex
Angliorum
et
Werinorum
hoc est
Thuringorum
."

§ 48
. These notices agree in giving the Angles a

German
locality, and in connecting them ethnologically, and
philologically with the
Germans
of Germany. And such was,
undoubtedly, the case. Nevertheless, it may be seen from §
15
that a
Danish
origin has been assigned to
them.

The exact Germanic affinities of the Angles are, how ever, difficult
to ascertain, since the tribes with which they are classed are
differently classed. This we shall see by asking the following
questions:—

§ 49
. What were the
Langobardi
, with whom
the Angles were connected by Tacitus? The most important fact to be known
concerning them is, that the general opinion is in favour of their having
belonged to either the
High
-German, or Mœso-Gothic division,
rather than to the
Low
.

§ 50
. What were the
Suevi
, with whom the
Angles were connected by Tacitus? The most important fact to be known
concerning them is, that the general opinion is in favour of their having
belonged to either the
High
-German or Mœso-Gothic division
rather than to the
Low
.

§ 51
. What were the
Werini
, with whom the
Angles were connected in the
Leges Anglorum et Werinorum
? Without
having any particular
data
for connecting the Werini (Varni,
Οὐάρνοι
) with either
the High-German, or
[28]
the Mœso-Gothic divisions, there are
certain facts in favour of their being
Slavonic
.

§ 52
. What were the
Thuringians
, with whom
the Angles are connected in the
Leges Anglorum
? Germanic in
locality, and most probably allied to the Goths of Mœsia in
language. If not, High-Germans.

§ 53
. Of the Reudigni, Eudoses, Nuithones,
Suardones, and Aviones, too little is known in detail to make the details
an inquiry of importance.

§ 54
. The reader has now got a general view of
the extent to which the position of the Angles, as a German tribe, is
complicated by conflicting statements; statements which connect them with
(probably)
High
-German Thuringians, Suevi, and Langobardi, and
with (probably)
Slavonic
Werini, or Varni; whereas in England,
they are scarcely distinguishable from the
Low
-German Saxons. In
the present state of our knowledge, the only safe fact seems to be, that
of the common relation of both
Angles
and Saxons to the present

English
of England.

This brings the two sections within a very close degree of affinity,
and makes it probable, that, just as at present, descendants of the
Saxons are English (
Angle
) in Britain, so, in the third and fourth
centuries, ancestors of the Angles were Saxons in Germany. Why, however,
the one name preponderated on the Continent, and the other in England is
difficult to ascertain.

§ 55
. The Frisians have been mentioned as a
Germanic population
likely
to have joined in the invasion of
Britain; the
presumption
in favor of their having done so arising
from their geographical position.

There is, however, something more than mere presumption upon this
point.

Archbishop Usher, amongst the earlier historians, and
[29]
Mr. Kemble
amongst those of the present day, as well as other intermediate
investigators, have drawn attention to certain important notices of
them.

The main facts bearing upon this question are the
following:—

1. Hengist, according to some traditions, was a Frisian hero.

2. Procopius wrote as follows:—
Βριττίαν δὲ
τὴν νῆσον
ἔθνη τρία
πολυανθρωπότατα
ἔχουσι,
βασιλεύς
τε εἶς αὐτῶν
ἑκάστῳ

.—Procop.
B. G. iv. 20.

3. In the Saxon Chronicle we find the following passage:—"That
same year, the armies from among the East-Anglians, and from among the
North-Humbrians, harassed the land of the West-Saxons chiefly, most of
all by their 'æscs,' which they had built many years before. Then king
Alfred commanded long ships to be built to oppose the æscs; they were
full-nigh twice as long as the others; some had sixty oars, and some had
more; they were both swifter and steadier, and also higher than the
others. They were shapen neither like the
Frisian
nor the Danish,
but so as it seemed to him that they would be most efficient. Then some
time in the same year, there came six ships to Wight, and there did much
harm, as well as in Devon, and elsewhere along the sea coast. Then the
king commanded nine of the new ships to go thither, and they obstructed
their passage from the port towards the outer sea. Then went they with
three of their ships out against them; and three lay in the upper part of
the port in the dry; the men were gone
[30]
from them ashore. Then
took they two of the three ships at the outer part of the port, and
killed the men, and the other ship escaped; in that also the men were
killed except five; they got away because the other ships were aground.
They also were aground very disadvantageously, three lay aground on that
side of the deep on which the Danish ships were aground, and all the rest
upon the other side, so that no one of them could get to the others. But
when, the water had ebbed many furlongs from the ships, then the Danish
men went from their three ships to the other three which were left by the
tide on their side, and then they there fought against them. There was
slain Lucumon the king's reeve, and Wulfheard the
Frisian
, and
Æbbe the
Frisian
, and Æthelhere the
Frisian
, and Æthelferth
the king's 'geneat,' and of all the men,
Frisians
and English,
seventy-two; and of the Danish men one hundred and twenty."

§ 56
. I believe then, that, so far from the
current accounts being absolutely correct, in respect to the Germanic
elements of the English population, the
Jutes
, as mentioned by
Beda, formed
no
part of it, whilst the
Frisians
,
not

so mentioned,
were a real constituent therein
; besides which,
there may, very easily, have been other Germanic tribes, though in
smaller proportions.

[31]

CHAPTER VI.

THE CELTIC STOCK OF LANGUAGES, AND THEIR RELATIONS TO THE ENGLISH.

§ 57
. The languages of Great Britain at the
invasion of Julius Cæsar were of the Celtic stock.

Of the Celtic stock there are two branches.

1. The British or Cambrian branch, represented by the present Welsh,
and containing, besides, the Cornish of Cornwall (lately extinct), and
the Armorican of the French province of Brittany. It is almost certain
that the old British, the ancient language of Gaul, and the Pictish were
of this branch.

2. The Gaelic or Erse branch, represented by the present Irish Gaelic,
and containing, besides, the Gaelic of the Highlands of Scotland and the
Manks of the Isle of Man.

§ 58
. Taken altogether the Celtic tongues form a
very remarkable class. As compared with those of the Gothic stock they
are marked by the following characteristics:—

The scantiness of the declension of Celtic nouns.
—In
Irish there is a peculiar form for the dative plural, as
cos
=

foot
,
cos-aibh
=
to feet
(ped-
ibus
); and
beyond this there is nothing else whatever in the way of
case
, as
found in the German, Latin, Greek, and other tongues. Even the isolated
form in question is not found in the
[32]
Welsh and Breton. Hence
the Celtic tongues are pre-eminently uninflected in the way of

declension
.

§ 59
. The
agglutinate character of their
verbal inflections
.—In Welsh the pronouns for
we
,

ye
, and
they
, are
ni
,
chwyi
, and
hwynt

respectively
. In Welsh also the root =
love
is
car
.
As conjugated in the plural number this is—

car-
wn
= am-
amus
.

car-
ych
= am-
atis
.

car-
ant
= am-
ant
.

Now the
-wn
,
-ych
, and
-ant
, of the persons of
the verbs are the personal pronouns, so that the inflection is really a
verb and a pronoun in a state of
agglutination
;
i.e.
, in a
state where the original separate existence of the two sorts of words is
still manifest. This is probably the case with languages in general. The
Celtic, however, has the peculiarity of exhibiting it in an unmistakable
manner; showing, as it were, an inflection in the process of formation,
and (as such) exhibiting an early stage of language.

§ 60
.
The system of initial
mutations.
—The Celtic, as has been seen, is deficient in the
ordinary means of expressing case. How does it make up for this? Even
thus. The noun changes its initial letter according to its relation to
the other words of the sentence. Of course this is subject to rule. As,
however, I am only writing for the sake of illustrating in a general way
the peculiarities of the Celtic tongues, the following table, from
Prichard's "Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations," is sufficient.

§ 61
. The Celtic tongues have lately received
especial illustration from the researches of Mr. Garnett. Amongst others,
the two following points are particularly investigated by him:—

1. The affinities of the ancient language of Gaul.

2. The affinities of the Pictish language or dialect.

§ 62
.
The ancient language of Gaul
Cambrian.
—The evidence in favour of the ancient language of
Gaul being Cambrian rather than Gaelic, lies in the following
facts:—

The old Gallic glosses are more Welsh than Gaelic.

a.

Petorritum
=
a four-wheeled carriage
, from the
Welsh,
peder
=
four
, and
rhod
=
a wheel
. The
Gaelic
[34]
for
four
is
ceathair
, and the
Gaelic compound would have been different.

b.

Pempedula
, the
cinque-foil
, from the Welsh

pump
=
five
, and
dalen
=
a leaf
. The Gaelic
for
five
is
cuig
, and the Gaelic compound would have been
different.

c.

Candetum
= a measure of 100 feet, from the Welsh

cant
= 100. The Gaelic for
a hundred
is
cead
, and
the Gaelic compound would have been different.

d.

Epona
=
the goddess of horses.
In the old
Armorican the root
ep
=
horse
. The Gaelic for a horse is

each
.

e.
The evidence from the names of geographical localities in
Gaul, both ancient and modern, goes the same way:
Nantuates
,

Nantouin
,
Nanteuil
, are derived from the Welsh
nant

=
a valley
, a word unknown in Gaelic.

f.
The evidence of certain French provincial words, which are
Welsh and Armorican rather than Erse or Gaelic.

§ 63
.
The Pictish most probably
Cambrian.
—The evidence in favour of the Pictish being Cambrian
rather than Gaelic lies in the following facts:

a.
When St. Columbanus preached, whose mother-tongue was Irish
Gaelic, he used an interpreter. This shows the
difference
between
the Pict and Gaelic. What follows shows the affinity between the Pict and
Welsh.

b.
A manuscript in the Colbertine library contains a list of
Pictish kings from the fifth century downwards. These names are more
Welsh than Gaelic.
Taran
=
thunder
in Welsh.
Uven
is
the Welsh
Owen
. The first syllable in
Talorg
( =

forehead
) is the
tal
in
Talhaiarn
=
iron
forehead
,
Taliessin
=
splendid forehead
, Welsh names.

Wrgust
is nearer to the Welsh
Gwrgust
than to the Irish

Fergus
. Finally,
Drust
,
Drostan
,
Wrad
,

Necton
, closely resemble the Welsh
Trwst
,
[35]
Trwstan
,

Gwriad
,
Nwython
.
Cineod
and
Domhnall

(
Kenneth
and
Donnell
) are the only true Erse forms in the
list.

c.
The only Pictish common name extant is the well-known
compound
pen val
, which is, in the oldest MS. of Beda,
peann
fahel
. This means
caput valli
, and is the name for the eastern
termination of the Vallum of Antoninus. Herein
pen
is
unequivocally Welsh, meaning
head
. It is an impossible form in
Gaelic.
Fal
, on the other hand, is apparently Gaelic, the Welsh
for a
rampart
being
gwall
.
Fal
, however, occurs in
Welsh also, and means
inclosure
.

The evidence just indicated is rendered nearly conclusive by an
interpolation, apparently of the twelfth century, of the Durham MS. of
Nennius, whereby it is stated that the spot in question was called in
Gaelic
Cenail
. Now Cenail is the modern name
Kinneil
, and
it is also a Gaelic translation of the Pict
pen val
, since

cean
is the Gaelic for
head
, and
fhail
for

rampart
or
wall
. If the older form were Gaelic, the
substitution, or translation, would have been superfluous.

d.
The name of the
Ochil Hills
in Perthshire is better
explained from the Pict
uchel
=
high
, than from the Gaelic

uasal
.

e.
Bryneich, the British form of the province Bernicia, is
better explained by the Welsh
bryn
=
ridge
(
hilly
country
), than by any word in Gaelic.—Garnett, in "Transactions
of Philological Society."

[36]

CHAPTER VII.

THE ANGLO-NORMAN, AND THE LANGUAGES OF THE CLASSICAL STOCK.

§ 64
. The languages of Greece and Rome belong to
one and the same stock.

The Greek and its dialects, both ancient and modern, constitute the
Greek of the Classical stock.

The Latin in all its dialects, the old Italian languages allied to it,
and the modern tongues derived from the Roman, constitute the Latin
branch of the Classical stock.

Now, although the Greek dialects are of only secondary importance in
the illustration of the history of the English language, the Latin
elements require a special consideration.

This is because the Norman French, introduced into England by the
battle of Hastings, is a language derived from the Roman, and
consequently a language of the Latin branch of the Classical stock.

§ 65
. The Latin language overspread the greater
part of the Roman empire. It supplanted a multiplicity of aboriginal
languages; just as the English of North America
has
supplanted the
aboriginal tongues of the native Indians, and just as the Russian

is
supplanting those of Siberia and Kamskatka.

Sometimes the war that the Romans carried on against the old
inhabitants was a war of extermination. In this case the original
language was superseded
at once
. In
[37]
other cases their
influence was introduced gradually. In this case the influence of the
original language was greater and more permanent.

Just as in the United States the English came in contact with an
American, whilst in New Holland it comes in contact with an Australian
language, so was the Latin language of Rome engrafted, sometimes on a
Celtic, sometimes on a Gothic, and sometimes on some other stock. The
nature of the original language must always be borne in mind.

From Italy, its original seat, the Latin was extended in the following
chronological order:—

1. To the Spanish Peninsula; where it overlaid or was engrafted on
languages allied to the present Biscayan.

2. To Gaul, or France, where it overlaid or was engrafted on languages
of the Celtic stock.

3. To Dacia and Pannonia where it overlaid or was engrafted on a
language the stock whereof is undetermined, but which was, probably,
Sarmatian. The introduction of the Latin into Dacia and Pannonia took
place in the time of Trajan.

§ 66
. From these different introductions of the
Latin into different countries we have the following modern
languages—1st Italian, 2nd Spanish and Portuguese, 3rd French, 4th
Wallachian; to which must be added a 5th, the Romanese of part of
Switzerland.

§ 67
. Such is the
general
view of the
languages derived from the Latin,
i.e.
, of the languages of the
Latin branch of the Classical stock.
[39]

The French requires to be more minutely exhibited.

Between the provincial French of the north and the provincial French
of the south, there is a difference, at the present day, at least of
dialect, and perhaps of language. This is shown by the following
specimens: the first from the canton of Arras, on the confines of
Flanders; the second from the department of Var, in Provence. The date of
each is
A.D.
1807.

Practically speaking, although in the central parts of France the
northern and southern dialects melt into each
[40]
other, the Loire may be
considered as a line of demarcation between two languages; the term
language being employed because, in the Middle Ages, whatever may be
their real difference, their northern tongue and the southern tongue were
dealt with not as separate dialects, but as distinct languages—the
southern being called Provençal, the northern Norman-French.

Of these two languages (for so they will in the following pages be
called, for the sake of convenience) the southern, or Provençal,
approaches the dialects of Spain; the Valencian of Spain and the
Catalonian of Spain being Provençal rather than standard Spanish or
Castilian.

The southern French is sometimes called the Langue d'Oc, and sometimes
the Limousin.

§ 68
. The Norman-French, spoken from the Loire to
the confines of Flanders, and called also the Langue d'Oyl, differed from
the Provençal in (amongst others) the following circumstances.

1. It was of later origin; the southern parts of Gaul having been
colonized at an early period by the Romans.

2. It was in geographical contact, not with the allied languages of
Spain, but with the Gothic tongues of Germany and Holland.

§ 69
. It is the Norman-French that most
especially bears upon the history of the English language.

Specimen from the Anglo-Norman poem of
Charlemagne.

Un jur fu Karléun al Seint-Denis muster,

Reout prise sa corune, en croiz seignat sun chef;

E ad ceinte sa espée: li pons fud d'or mer.

Dux i out e dermeines e baruns e chevalers.

Li emperères reguardet la reine sa muillers.

[41]

Ele fut ben corunée al plus bel e as meuz.

Il la prist par le poin desuz un oliver,

De sa pleine parole la prist à reisuner:

"Dame, véistes unkes hume nul de desuz ceil

Tant ben séist espée no la corone el chef!

Uncore cunquerrei-jo citez ot mun espeez."

Cele ne fud pas sage, folement respondeit:

"Emperere," dist-ele, trop vus poez preiser.

"Uncore en sa-jo un ki plus se fait léger,

Quant il porte corune entre ses chevalers;

Kaunt il met sur sa teste, plus belement lui set"

In the northern French we must recognise not only a Celtic and a
Classical, but also a Gothic element: since Clovis and Charlemagne were
no Frenchmen, but Germans. The Germanic element in French has still to be
determined.

In the northern French of
Normandy
there is a second Gothic
element,
viz.
, a Scandinavian element. See §
76
.

PART II.

HISTORY AND ANALYSIS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

CHAPTER I.

HISTORICAL AND LOGICAL ELEMENTS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

§ 70
. The Celtic elements of the present English
fall into five classes.

1. Those that are of late introduction, and cannot be called original
and constituent parts of the language. Some of such are the words

flannel
,
crowd
(a fiddle), from the Cambrian; and

kerne
(an Irish foot-soldier),
galore
(enough),

tartan
,
plaid
, &c., from the Gaelic branch.

2. Those that are originally common to both the Celtic and Gothic
stocks. Some of such are
brother
,
mother
, in Celtic

brathair
,
mathair
; the numerals, &c.

3. Those that have come to us from the Celtic, but have come to us
through the medium of another language. Some of such are
druid
and

bard
, whose
immediate
source is, not the Celtic but the
Latin.

4. Celtic elements of the Anglo-Norman, introduced into England after
the Conquest, and occurring in that language as remains of the original
Celtic of Gaul.
[46]

5. Those that have been retained from the original Celtic of the
island, and which form genuine constituents of our language. These fall
into three subdivisions.

a
. Proper names—generally of geographical localities; as

the Thames
,
Kent
, &c.

b
. Common names retained in the provincial dialects of England,
but not retained in the current language; as
gwethall
=

household stuff
, and
gwlanen
=
flannel
in
Herefordshire.

c
. Common names retained in the current language.—The
following list is Mr. Garnett's:—

Latin of the first period.
—Of
the Latin introduced by Cæsar and his successors, the few words
[47]
remaining are
those that relate to military affairs;
viz.

street

(
strata
);
-coln
(as in
Lincoln
=
Lindi
colonia
);
-cest-
(as in
Gloucester
=
glevæ
castra
) from
castra
. The Latin words introduced between the
time of Cæsar and Hengist may be called the
Latin of the first
period
, or the
Latin of the Celtic period
.

§ 72
.
The Anglo-Saxon.
—This is not
noticed here, because, from being the staple of the present language, it
is more or less the subject of the book throughout.

§ 73
.
The Danish, or Norse.
—The
pirates that pillaged Britain, under the name of Danes, were not
exclusively the inhabitants of Denmark. Of the three Scandinavian
nations, the Swedes took the least share, the Norwegians the greatest, in
these invasions.

The language of the three nations was the same; the differences being
differences of dialect. It was that which is now spoken in Iceland,
having been once common to Scandinavia and Denmark.

The Danish that became incorporated with our language, under the reign
of Canute and his sons, may be called the
direct
Danish element,
in contradistinction to the
indirect
Danish of §
76
.

The determination of the amount of Danish in English is difficult. It
is not difficult to prove a word
Scandinavian
; but, then, we must
also show that it is not German as well. A few years back the current
opinion was against the doctrine that there was much Danish in England.
At present, the tendency is rather the other way. The following facts are
from Mr. Garnett.—"Phil. Trans." vol. i.

1. The Saxon name of the present town of
Whitby
in Yorkshire
was
Streoneshalch
. The present name
Whitby
,
Hvitby
,
or
Whitetown
, is Danish.
[48]

2. The Saxon name of the capital of Derbyshire was

Northweortheg
. The present name is Danish.

3. The termination
-by
=
town
is Norse.

4. On a monument in Aldburgh church, Holdernesse, in the East Riding
of Yorkshire, referred to the age of Edward the Confessor, is found the
following inscription:—

Ulf
het aræran cyrice
for hanum
and for Gunthara saula.

"Ulf bid rear the church for him and for the soul of Gunthar."

Now, in this inscription,
Ulf
, in opposition to the Anglo-Saxon

Wulf
, is a Norse form; whilst
hanum
is a Norse dative, and
by no means an Anglo-Saxon one.—Old Norse
hanum
, Swedish

honom
.

5. The use of
at
for
to
as the sign of the infinitive
mood is Norse, not Saxon. It is the regular prefix in Icelandic, Danish,
Swedish, and Feroic. It is also found in the northern dialects of the Old
English, and in the particular dialect of Westmoreland at the present
day.

6. The use of
sum
for
as
;
e.g.
,—
swa
sum
we forgive oure detturs.

7. Isolated words in the northern dialects are Norse rather than
Saxon.

§ 75
.
The Anglo-Norman element.
—For
practical purposes we may say that the French or Anglo-Norman element
appeared in our language after the battle of Hastings,
A.D.
1066.

Previous, however, to that period we find notices of intercourse
between the two countries.

1. The residence in England of Louis Outremer.

2. Ethelred II. married Emma, daughter of Richard Duke of Normandy,
and the two children were sent to Normandy for education.

3. Edward the Confessor is particularly stated to have encouraged
French manners and the French language in England.
[50]

4. Ingulphus of Croydon speaks of his own knowledge of French.

5. Harold passed some time in Normandy.

6. The French article
la
, in the term
la Drove
, occurs
in a deed of
A.D.
975.

The chief Anglo-Norman elements of our language are the terms
connected with the feudal system, the terms relating to war and chivalry,
and a great portion of the law terms—
duke
,
count
,

baron
,
villain
,
service
,
chivalry
,

warrant
,
esquire
,
challenge
,
domain
,
&c.

§ 76
. When we remember that the word

Norman
means
man of the north
, that it is a

Scandinavian
, and
not a French
word, that it originated in
the invasions of the followers of Rollo and and other
Norwegians
,
and that just as part of England was overrun by Pagan buccaneers called

Danes
, part of France was occupied by similar
Northmen
, we
see the likelihood of certain Norse words finding their way into the
French language, where they would be superadded to its original Celtic
and Roman elements.

The extent to which this is actually the case has only been partially
investigated. It is certain, however, that some French words are Norse or
Scandinavian. Such, for instance, are several
names of geographical
localities
either near the sea, or the river Seine, in other words,
within that tract which was most especially occupied by the invaders. As
is to be expected from the genius of the French language, these words are
considerably altered in form. Thus,

NORSE.
ENGLISH.
FRENCH.

Toft
Toft
Tot.

Beck
Beck
Bec.

Flöt
Fleet
[33]
Fleur, &c.

[51]

and in these shapes they appear in the Norman names
Yvetot
,

Caudebec
, and
Harfleur
, &c.

Now any words thus introduced from the Norse of Scandinavia into the
French of Normandy, might, by the Norman Conquest of England, be carried
further, and so find their way into the English.

In such a case, they would constitute its
indirect
Scandinavian
element.

A list of these words has not been made; indeed the question requires
far more investigation than it has met with. The names, however, of the
islands
Guerns-ey
,
Jers-ey
, and
Aldern-ey
, are
certainly of the kind in question—since the
-ey
, meaning

island
, is the same as the
-ey
in
Orkn-ey
, and is
the Norse rather than the Saxon form.

§ 77
.
Latin of the third
period.
—This means the Latin which was introduced between the
battle of Hastings and the revival of literature. It chiefly originated
in the cloister, in the universities, and, to a certain extent, in the
courts of law. It must be distinguished from the
indirect
Latin
introduced as part and parcel of the Anglo-Norman. It has yet to be
accurately analyzed.

§ 78
.
Latin of the fourth
period.
—This means the Latin which has been introduced between
the revival of literature and the present time. It has originated in the
writings of learned men in general, and is distinguished from that of the
previous periods by:

1. Being less altered in form:

2. Preserving, with substantives, in many cases its original
inflections;
axis
,
axes
;
basis
,
bases
:

3. Relating to objects and ideas for which the increase of the range
of science in general has required a nomenclature.
[52]

§ 79
.
Greek.
—Words derived

directly
from the Greek are in the same predicament as the Latin
of the third period—
phænomenon
,
phænomena
;

criterion
,
criteria
, &c.; words which are only

indirectly
of Greek origin, being considered to belong to the
language from which they were immediately introduced into the English.
Such are
deacon
,
priest
, &c., introduced through the
Latin. Hence a word like
church
proves no more in regard to a
Greek element in English, than the word
abbot
proves in respect to
a Syrian one.

§ 80
. The Latin of the fourth period and the
Greek agree in retaining, in many cases, original inflexions rather than
adopting the English ones; in other words, they agree in being but

imperfectly incorporated
. The phænomenon of imperfect
incorporation is reducible to the following rules:—

1. That it has a direct ratio to the date of the introduction,

i.e.
, the more recent the word the more likely it is to retain its
original inflexion.

2. That it has a relation to the number of meanings belonging to the
words: thus, when a single word has two meanings, the original inflexion
expresses one, the English inflexion another—
genius
,

genii
, often (
spirits
),
geniuses
(
men of
genius
).

3. That it occurs with substantives only, and that only in the
expression of number. Thus, although the plural of substantives like

axis
and
genius
are Latin, the possessive cases are
English. So also are the degrees of comparison for adjectives, like

circular
, and the tenses, &c. for verbs, like

perambulate
.

§ 81

substantives introduced during the latter part of the fourth period; and

§ 83
.
Miscellaneous elements.
—Of
miscellaneous elements we have two sorts; those that are incorporated in
our language, and are currently understood (
e.g.
, the Spanish word

sherry
, the Arabic word
alkali
, and the Persian word

turban
), and those that, even amongst the educated, are considered
strangers. Of this latter kind
[56]
(amongst many others) are the oriental words

hummum
,
kaftan
,
gul
, &c.

Of the currently understood miscellaneous elements of the English
language, the most important are from the French; some of which agree
with those of the Latin of the fourth period, and the Greek, in
preserving the
French
plural forms—as
beau
,

beaux
,
billets-doux
.

Italian.
—Some words of Italian origin do the same; as

virtuoso
,
virtuosi
.

Hebrew.
—The Hebrew words,
cherub
and
seraph

do the same; the form
cherub-im
, and
seraph-im
being not
only plurals but Hebrew plurals.

Beyond the words derived from these five languages, none form their
plural other than after the English method,
i.e.
, in
-s
, as

waltzes
, from the
German
word
waltz
.

§ 84
. Hence we have a measure of the extent to
which a language, which, like the English, at one and the same time
requires names for many objects, comes in contact with the tongues of
half the world, and has moreover, a great power of incorporating foreign
elements, derives fresh words from varied sources; as may be seen from
the following incomplete notice of the languages which have, in different
degrees, supplied it with new terms.

Arabic.
—Admiral, alchemist, alchemy, alcohol, alcove,
alembic, algebra, alkali, assassin.

Persian.
—Turban, caravan, dervise, &c.

Turkish.
—Coffee, bashaw, divan, scimitar, janisary,
&c.

Hindoo languages.
—Calico, chintz, cowrie, curry, lac,
muslin, toddy, &c.

Chinese.
—Tea, bohea, congou, hyson, soy, nankin &c.

[57]

Malay.
—Bantam (fowl), gamboge, rattan, sago, shaddock,
&c.

Polynesian.
—Taboo, tattoo.

Tungusian or some similar Siberian language.
—Mammoth, the
bones of which are chiefly from the banks of the Lena.

North American Indian.
—Squaw, wigwam, pemmican.

Peruvian.
—Charki = prepared meat; whence
jerked

beef.

Caribbean.
—Hammock.

§ 85
. A distinction is drawn between the

direct
and
indirect
, the latter leading to the
ultimate
origin
of words.

Thus a word borrowed into the English from the French, might have been
borrowed into the French from the Latin, into the Latin from the Greek,
into the Greek from the Persian, &c., and so
ad infinitum
.

The investigation of this is a matter of literary curiosity rather
than any important branch of philology.

The ultimate known origin of many common words sometimes goes back to
a great date, and points to extinct languages—

Ancient Nubian.
—Barbarous.

Ancient Egyptian.
—Ammonia.

Ancient Syrian.
—Cyder.

Ancient Lycian.
—Pandar.

Ancient Lydian.
—Mæander.

Ancient Persian.
—Paradise.

§ 86
. Again, a word from a given language may be
introduced by more lines than one; or it may be introduced twice over;
once at an earlier, and again at a later period. In such a case its form
will, most probably, vary; and, what is more, its meaning as well.
[58]
Words of
this sort may be called
di-morphic
, their
dimorphism
having
originated in one of two reasons—a difference of channel or a
difference of date. Instances of the first are,
syrup
,

sherbet
, and
shrub
, all originally from the
Arabic
,

srb
; but introduced differently, viz., the first through the
Latin, the second through the Persian, and the third through the Hindoo.
Instances of the second are words like
minster
, introduced during
the Anglo-Saxon, as contrasted with
monastery
, introduced during
the Anglo-Norman period. By the proper application of these processes, we
account for words so different in present form, yet so identical in
origin, as
priest
and
presbyter
,
episcopal
and

bishop
,
&c.

§ 87
.
Distinction.
—The history of
the languages that have been spoken in a particular country, is a
different subject from the history of a particular language. The history
of the languages that have been spoken in the United States of America,
is the history of
Indian
languages. The history of the
language
of the United States is the history of a Germanic
language.

§ 88
.
Words of foreign simulating a vernacular
origin.
—These may occur in any mixed language whatever; they
occur, however, oftener in the English than in any other.

Let a word be introduced from a foreign language—let it have
some resemblance in sound to a real English term: lastly, let the
meanings of the two words be not absolutely incompatible. We may then
have a word of foreign origin taking the appearance of an English one.
Such, amongst others, are
beef-eater
, from

bœuffetier
;
sparrow-grass
,
asparagus
;

Shotover
,
Chateauvert
;
[35]

Jerusalem
,

Girasole
;
[36]

Spanish beefeater
,
spina

[59]
bifida
;
periwig
,
peruke
;

runagate
,
renegade
;
lutestring
,
lustrino
;
[37]

O yes
,

Oyez!

ancient
,
ensign
.
[38]

Dog-cheap
.—This has nothing to do with
dogs
. The
first syllabic is
god
=
good
transposed, and the second the

ch-p
in
chapman
( =
merchant
)
cheap
, and

Eastcheap
. In Sir J. Mandeville, we find
god-kepe
=
good
bargain
.

Sky-larking
.—Nothing to do with
larks
of any sort;
still less the particular species,
alauda arvensis
. The word
improperly spelt
l-a-r-k
, and banished to the slang regions of the
English language, is the Anglo-Saxon
lác
=
game
, or

sport
; wherein the a is sounded as in
father
(not as in

farther
).
Lek
=
game
, in the present Scandinavian
languages.

Zachary Macaulay
=
Zumalacarregui
;
Billy Ruffian

=
Bellerophon
;
Sir Roger Dowlas
=
Surajah Dowlah
,
although so limited to the common soldiers and sailors, who first used
them, as to be exploded vulgarisms rather than integral parts of the
language, are examples of the same tendency towards the irregular
accommodation of misunderstood foreign terms.

Birdbolt
.—An incorrect name for the
gadus lota
, or

eel-pout
, and a transformation of
barbote
.

Whistle-fish
.—The same for
gadus mustela
, or

weasel-fish
.

Liquorice
=
glycyrrhiza
.

Wormwood
=
weremuth
, is an instance of a word from the
same language, in an antiquated shape, being equally transformed with a
word of really foreign origin.

§ 89
. Sometimes the transformation of the

name
has engendered a change in the object to which it applies,
or, at least, has evolved new ideas in connection with it. How easy for a
person who used the words
beef-eater
,
[60]
sparrow-grass
, or

Jerusalem
, to believe that the officers designated by the former
either eat or used to eat more beef than any other people, that the
second word was the name for a
grass
or herb of which

sparrows
were fond; and that
Jerusalem
artichokes came from
Palestine.

What has just been supposed has sometimes a real occurrence. To
account for the name of
Shotover-hill
, I have heard that Little
John
shot over
it. Here the confusion, in order to set itself
right, breeds a fiction. Again, in chess, the piece now called the

queen
, was originally the
elephant
. This was in Persian,

ferz
. In French it became
vierge
, which, in time, came to
be mistaken for a derivative, and
virgo
=
the virgin
,

the lady
,
the queen
.

§ 90
. Sometimes, where the form of a word in
respect to its
sound
is not affected, a false spirit of
accommodation introduces an unetymological
spelling
; as

frontisp
i
ece
, from
frontispecium
,

sover
e
ign
, from
sovrano
,
colle
a
gue

from
collega
,
lant
h
orn
(old orthography) from

lanterna
.

The value of forms like these consists in their showing that language
is affected by false etymologies as well as by true ones.

§ 91
. In
lambkin
and
lancet
, the
final syllables (
-kin
and
-et
) have the same power. They
both express the idea of smallness or diminutiveness. These words are but
two out of a multitude, the one (
lamb
) being of Saxon, the other
(
lance
) of Norman origin. The same is the case with the superadded
syllables:
-kin
being Saxon;
-et
Norman. Now to add a Saxon
termination to a Norman word, or
vice versâ
, is to corrupt the
English language.

This leads to some observation respecting the—
[61]

§ 92
.
Introduction of new words and
Hybridism.
—Hybridism is a term derived from
hybrid-a
,

a mongrel
; a Latin word
of Greek extraction
.

The terminations
-ize
(as in
criticize
),
-ism
(as
in
criticism
),
-ic
(as in
comic
)—these,
amongst many others, are Greek terminations. To add them to words not of
Greek origin is to be guilty of hybridism. Hence,
witticism
is
objectionable.

The terminations
-ble
(as in
penetrable
),
-bility

(as in
penetrability
),
-al
(as in

parental
)—these, amongst many others, are Latin
terminations. To add them to words not of Latin origin is to be guilty of
hybridism.

Hybridism is the commonest fault that accompanies the introduction of
new words. The hybrid additions to the English language are most numerous
in works on science.

It must not, however, be concealed that several well established words
are hybrid; and that, even in the writings of the classical Roman
authors, there is hybridism between the Latin and the Greek.

Nevertheless, the etymological view of every word of foreign origin
is, not that it is put together in England, but that it is brought whole
from the language to which it is vernacular. Now no derived word can be
brought whole from a language unless, in that language, all its parts
exist. The word
penetrability
is not derived from the English word

penetrable
, by the addition of
-ty
. It is the Latin word

penetrabilitas
imported.

In derived words all the parts must belong to one and the same
language
, or, changing the expression,
every derived word must
have a possible form in the language from which it is taken
. Such is
the rule against hybridism.

§ 93
. A true word sometimes takes the appearance
of
[62]
a hybrid without really being so. The

-icle
, in
icicle
, is apparently the same as the

-icle
in
radicle
. Now, as
ice
is Gothic, and

-icle
classical, hybridism is simulated.
Icicle
, however,
is not a derivative but a compound; its parts being
is
and

gicel
, both Anglo-Saxon words.
[39]

§ 94
.
On incompletion of the
radical.
—Let there be in a given language a series of roots
ending in
-t
, as
sæmat
. Let a euphonic influence eject the

-t
, as often as the word occurs in the nominative case. Let the
nominative case be erroneously considered to represent the root, or
radical, of the word. Let a derivative word be formed accordingly,

i.e.
, on the notion that the nominative form and the radical form
coincide. Such a derivative will exhibit only a part of the root; in
other words, the radical will be incomplete.

Now all this is what actually takes place in words like

hæmo-ptysis
(
spitting of blood
),
sema-phore
(
a
sort of telegraph
). The Greek imparisyllabics eject a part of the
root in the nominative case; the radical forms being
hæmat-
and

sæmat-
, not
hæm-
and
sæm-
.

Incompletion of the radical is one of the commonest causes of words
being coined faultily. It must not, however, be concealed, that even in
the classical writers, we have in words like
δίστομος

examples of incompletion of the radical.

§ 95
. The preceding chapters have paved the way
for a distinction between the
historical
analysis of a language,
and the
logical
analysis of one.

Let the present language of England (for illustration's sake only)
consist of 40,000 words. Of these let 30,000
[63]
be Anglo-Saxon, 5,000
Anglo-Norman, 100 Celtic, 10 Latin of the first, 20 Latin of the second,
and 30 Latin of the third period, 50 Scandinavian, and the rest
miscellaneous. In this case the language is considered according to the
historical origin of the words that compose it, and the analysis is an
historical analysis.

But it is very evident that the English, or any other language, is
capable of being contemplated in another view, and that the same number
of words may be very differently classified. Instead of arranging them
according to the languages whence they are derived, let them be disposed
according to the meanings that they convey. Let it be said, for instance,
that out of 40,000 words, 10,000 are the names of natural objects, that
1000 denote abstract ideas, that 1000 relate to warfare, 1000 to church
matters, 500 to points of chivalry, 1000 to agriculture, and so on
through the whole. In this case the analysis is not historical but
logical; the words being classed not according to their
origin
,
but according to their
meaning
.

Now the logical and historical analyses of a language generally in
some degree coincide; that is, terms for a certain set of ideas come from
certain languages; just as in English a large proportion of our chemical
terms are Arabic, whilst a still larger one of our legal ones are
Anglo-Norman.

CHAPTER II.

THE RELATION OF THE ENGLISH TO THE ANGLO-SAXON, AND THE STAGES OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

§ 96
. The relation of the present English to the
Anglo-Saxon is that of a
modern
language to an
ancient
one:
the words
modern
and
ancient
being used in a defined and
technical sense.

Let the word
smiðum
illustrate this.
Smið-um
, the dative
plural of
smið
, is equivalent in meaning to the English
to
smiths
; or to the Latin
fabr-is
.
Smiðum
, however, is a
single Anglo-Saxon word (a substantive, and nothing more); whilst its
English equivalent is two words (
i.e.
, a substantive with the
addition of a preposition). The letter
s
, in
smiths
, shows
that the word is plural. The
-um
, in
smiðum
, does this and
something more. It is the sign of the
dative case
plural. The

-um
in
smiðum
, is the part of a word. The preposition

to
is a separate word with an independent existence.
Smiðum

is the radical syllable
smið
+ the subordinate inflectional
syllable
-um
, the sign of the dative case. The combination
to
smiths
is the substantive
smiths
+ the preposition
to
,
equivalent in power to the sign of a dative case, but different from it
in form. As far, then, as the words just quoted is concerned, the
Anglo-Saxon differs from the English by expressing an idea by a certain

modification of the form of the root
, whereas the modern English
denotes the same idea by
the addition of a preposition
; in
[65]
other
words, the Saxon
inflection
is superseded by a
combination

of words.

The sentences in italics are mere variations of the same general
statement. 1.
The earlier the stage of a given language the greater
the amount of its inflectional forms, and the later the stage of a given
language, the smaller the amount of them.
2.
As languages become
modern they substitute prepositions and auxiliary verbs for cases and
tenses.
3.
The amount of inflection is in the inverse proportion
to the amount of prepositions and auxiliary verbs.
4.
In the
course of time languages drop their inflections, and substitute in its
stead circumlocutions by means of prepositions, &c. The reverse never
takes place.
5.
Given two modes of expression, the one
inflectional
(smiðum),
the other circumlocutional
[40]
(to smiths),

we can state that the first belongs to an early, the second to a late,
state of language.

The present chapter, then showing the relation of the English to the
Anglo-Saxon, shows something more. It exhibits the
general

relation of a modern to an ancient language. As the English is to the
Anglo-Saxon, so are the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian, to the old Norse;
and so are the French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanese and
Wallachian to the Latin, and the Romaic to the ancient Greek.

§ 97
. Contrasted with the English, the
Anglo-Saxon has (among others) the following differences.

NOUNS.

1.
Gender.
—In Anglo-Saxon there were three genders, the
masculine, the feminine, and the neuter. With
adjectives
each
gender had its peculiar declension. With
[66]
substantives
also
there were appropriate terminations, though only to a certain degree.

2. The definite article varied with the gender of its substantive;

þæt eage
, the eye;
se steorra
, the star;
seo tunge
,
the tongue.

3.
Number.
—The plural form in
-en
(as in

oxen
), rare in English, was common in Anglo-Saxon. It was the
regular termination of a whole declension;
e.g.
,
eágan
,
eyes;
steorran
, stars;
tungan
, tongues. Besides this, the
Anglo-Saxons had forms in
-u
and
-a
as
ricu
,
kingdoms;
gifa
, gifts. The termination
-s
, current in the
present English, was confined to a single gender and to a single
declension, as
endas
, ends;
dagas
, days;
smiðas
,
smiths.

4.
Case.
—Of these the Saxons had, for their substantives,
at least three; viz., the nominative, dative, genitive. With the pronouns
and adjectives there was a true accusative form; and with a few especial
words an ablative or instrumental one.
Smið
, a smith;

smiðe
, to a smith;
smiðes
, of a smith. Plural,

smiðas
, smiths;
smiðum
, to smiths;
smiða
, of smiths:

he
, he;
hine
, him;
him
, to him;
his
, his;

se
, the;
þa
, the;
þy
, with the;
þam
, to the;

þæs
, of the.

5.
Declension.
—In
Anglo-Saxon
it was necessary to
determine the declension of a substantive. There was the weak, or simple
declension for words ending in a vowel (as,
eage
,
steorra
,

tunga
), and the strong declension for words ending in a consonant
(
smið
,
spræc
,
leáf
). The letters
i
and

u
were dealt with as semivowels, semi-vowels being dealt with as
consonants; so that words like
sunu
and
gifu
belonged to
the same declension as
smið
and
sprǽc
.

6.
Definite and indefinite form of adjectives.
—In
Anglo-Saxon each adjective had two forms, one
definite

[67]
and one

indefinite
. There is nothing of this kind in English. We say
a
good sword
, and
the good sword
equally. In Anglo-Saxon,
however, the first combination would be
se gode sweord
, the second

án god sweord
, the definite form being distinguished from the
indefinite by the addition of a vowel.

7.
Pronouns personal.
—The Anglo-Saxon language had for
the first two persons a
dual
number; inflected as follows:

1st Person.
2nd Person.

Nom.
Wit
We two
Nom.
Git
Ye two

Acc.
Unc
Us two
Acc.
Ince
You two

Gen.
Uncer
Of us two
Gen.
Incer
Of you two.

Besides this, the demonstrative, possessive, and relative pronouns, as
well as the numerals
twa
and
þreo
, had a fuller declension
than they have at present.

VERBS.

8.
Mood.
—The subjunctive mood that in the present English
(with one exception
[41]
) differs from the indicative only
in the third person singular, was in Anglo-Saxon considerably different
from the indicative.

Indicative Mood.

Pres. Sing.
1.
Lufige.
Plur.
1.
Lufiað.

2.
Lufast.

2.

3.
Lufað.

3.

Subjunctive Mood.

Pres. Sing.
1.
Lufige.
Plur.
1.
Lufion.

2.

2.

3.

3.

[68]

The Saxon infinitive ended in
-an
(
lufian
), and besides
this there was a so-called gerundial form,
to lufigenne
.

Besides these there were considerable differences in respect to
particular words; but of these no notice is taken; the object being to
indicate the differences between the
ancient
and
modern

stages of a language in respect to
grammatical structure
.

9. To bring about these changes a certain amount
of time
is, of
course, necessary; a condition which suggests the difficult question as
to the
rate
at which languages change. This is different for
different languages; but as the investigation belongs to
general

philology rather than to the particular history of the English language,
it finds no place here.

§ 98
. The extent, however, to which external
causes may accelerate or retard philological changes, is
not

foreign to our subject; the influence of the Norman Conquest, upon the
previous Anglo-Saxon foundation, being a problem of some difficulty.

At the first glance it seems to have been considerable, especially in
the way of simplifying the grammar. Yet the accuracy of this view is by
no means unequivocal. The reasons against it are as follows:

a.
In Friesland no such conquest took place. Yet the modern
Frisian, as compared with the ancient, is nearly as simple in its
grammatical structure, as the English is when compared with the
Anglo-Saxon.

b.
In Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, no such conquest took place.
Yet the modern Danish and Swedish, as compared with the Old Norse, are
nearly as simple in their grammatical structure, as the English is, when
compared with the Anglo-Saxon.

The question requires more investigation than it has met with.
[69]

An extract from Mr. Hallam's "History of Literature" closes the
present section, and introduces the next.

"Nothing can be more difficult, except by an arbitrary line, than to
determine the commencement of the English language; not so much, as in
those on the Continent, because we are in want of materials, but rather
from an opposite reason, the possibility of showing a very gradual
succession of verbal changes that ended in a change of denomination. We
should probably experience a similar difficulty, if we knew equally well
the current idiom of France or Italy in the seventh and eighth centuries.
For when we compare the earliest English of the thirteenth century with
the Anglo-Saxon of the twelfth, it seems hard to pronounce why it should
pass for a separate language, rather than a modification or
simplification of the former. We must conform, however, to usage, and say
that the Anglo-Saxon was converted into English:—1. By contracting
and otherwise modifying the pronunciation and orthography of words. 2. By
omitting many inflections, especially of the noun, and consequently
making more use of articles and auxiliaries. 3. By the introduction of
French derivatives. 4. By using less inversion and ellipsis, especially
in poetry. Of these, the second alone, I think, can be considered as
sufficient to describe a new form of language; and this was brought about
so gradually, that we are not relieved from much of our difficulty, as to
whether some compositions shall pass for the latest offspring of the
mother, or the earlier fruits of the daughter's fertility. It is a proof
of this difficulty that the best masters of our ancient language have
lately introduced the word Semi-Saxon, which is to cover everything from

A.D.
1150 to
A.D.

1250."—Chapter i. 47.

§ 99
. This shows that by the middle of the 12th
century, the Anglo-Saxon of the standard Anglo-Saxon authors, had
undergone such a change as to induce the scholars of the present ago to
denominate it, not Saxon, but
Semi
-Saxon. It had ceased to be
genuine Saxon, but had not yet become English.

Some, amongst others, of the earlier changes of the standard
Anglo-Saxon are,

1. The substitution of
-an
for
-as
, in the plural of

[70]
substantives,
munucan
for

munucas
(
monks
); and, conversely, the substitution of

-s
for
-n
, as
steorres
for
steorran

(
stars
).

2. The ejection or shortening of final vowels,
þæt ylc
for

þæt ylce
;
sone
for
sunu
;
name
for

nama
;
dages
for
dagas
.

3. The substitution of
-n
for
-m
in the dative case,

hwilon
for
hwilum
.

4. The ejection of the
-n
of the infinitive mood,
cumme

for
cuman
(
to come
),
nemne
for
nemnen
(
to
name
).

5. The ejection of
-en
in the participle passive,
I-hote

for
gehaten
(
called
,
hight
).

6. The gerundial termination
-enne
, superseded by the
infinitive termination
-en
; as
to lufian
for
to
lufienne
, or
lufigenne
.

7. The substitution of
-en
for
-að
in the persons plural
of verbs;
hi clepen
(
they call
) for
hi clypiað
,
&c.

The preponderance (not the occasional occurrence) of forms like those
above constitute
Semi-Saxon
in contradistinction to standard
Saxon, classical Saxon, or Anglo-Saxon proper.

§ 100
.
Old English stage.
—Further
changes convert Semi-Saxon into Old English. Some, amongst others, are
the following:—

1. The ejection of the dative plural termination
-um
, and the
substitution of the preposition to and the plural sign
-s
; as

to smiths
for
smiðum
. Of the dative
singular
the
-e
is retained (
ende
,
worde
);
but it is by no means certain that, although recognized in writing, it
was equally recognized in pronunciation also.

2. The ejection of
-es
in the genitive singular whenever the
preposition
of
came before it;
Godes love
(
God's
love
), but the
love of God
, and not the
love of
Godes
.

3. The syllable
-es
as a sign of the genitive case
[71]
extended to all
genders and to all declensions;
heart's
for
heortan
;

sun's
for
sunnan
.

4. The same in respect to the plural number;
sterres
for

steorran
;
sons
for
suna
.

5. The ejection of
-na
in the genitive plural; as
of
tunges
for
tungena
.

6. The use of the word
the
, as an article, instead of

se
, &c.

The
preponderance
of the forms above (and not their mere
occasional occurrence) constitutes
Old English
in
contradistinction to Semi-Saxon.

§ 101
. In the Old English the following forms
predominate.

1. A fuller inflection of the demonstrative pronoun, or definite
article;
þan
,
þenne
,
þære
,
þam
;—in
contradistinction to the Middle English.

2. The presence of the dative singular in
-e
;
ende
,

smithe
.

3. The existence of a genitive plural in
-r
or
-ra
;

heora
, theirs;
aller
, of all. This, with substantives and
adjectives, is less common.

4. The substitution of
heo
for
they
, of
heora
for

their
, of
hem
for
them
.

5. A more frequent use of
min
and
thin
, for
my

and
thy
;—in contradistinction to both Middle and Modern
English.

6. The use of
heo
for
she
;—in contradistinction to
Middle and Modern English and Old Lowland
Scotch
.

7. The use of broader vowels; as in
iclep
u
d
or

iclep
o
d
(for
iclep
e
d
or

ycl
e
pt
);
geong
o
st
, youngest;

asc
o
de
, asked;
eld
o
re
, elder.

8. The use of the strong preterits (
see
the chapter on the
tenses of verbs), where in the present English the weak form is
found—
wex
,
wop
,
dalf
, for
waxed
,

wept
,
delved
.
[72]

9. The omission not only of the gerundial termination
-enne
,
but also of the infinitive sign
-en
after
to
;
to
honte
,
to speke
;—in contradistinction to Semi-Saxon.

10. The substitution of
-en
for
-eþ
or
-eð
, in
the first and second persons plural of verbs;
we wollen
, we will:

heo schullen
, they should.

11. The comparative absence of the articles
se
and

seo
.

12. The substitution of
ben
and
beeth
, for
synd

and
syndon
=
we
,
ye
,
they are
.

§ 102
. Concerning the extent to which the
Anglo-Norman was used, I retail the following statements and
quotations.

1. "Letters even of a private nature were written in Latin till the
beginning of the reign of Edward I., soon after 1270, when a sudden
change brought in the use of French."—
Mr. Hallam, communicated
by Mr. Stevenson
(
Literature of Europe
, i. 52,
and
note
).

2. Conversation between the members of the Universities was ordered to
be carried on either in Latin or French:—"
Si qua inter se
proferant, colloquio Latino vel saltem Gallico
perfruantur.
"—
Statutes of Oriel College,
Oxford.
—
Hallam, ibid.
from Warton.

3. "The Minutes of the Corporation of London, recorded in the Town
Clerk's Office, were in French, as well as the Proceedings in Parliament,
and in the Courts of Justice."—
Ibid.

4. "In Grammar Schools, boys were made to construe their Latin into
French."—
Ibid.
"
Pueri in scholis, contra morem cæterarum
nationum, et Normannorum adventu, derelicto proprio vulgari, construere
Gallice compelluntur. Item quod filii nobilium ab ipsis cunabulorum
crepundiis ad Gallicum idioma informantur. Quibus profecto rurales
homines assimulari volentes, ut per hoc spectabiliores videantur,
Francigenari satagunt omni nisu.
"—
Higden
(
Ed.
Gale
, p. 210).

§ 103
. The reigns of Edward III., and Richard
II., may be said to form a transition from the
Old
to the

Middle
; those of Mary and Elizabeth from the
Middle
to the

New
,
Recent
or
Modern English
. No very definite line
of demarcation, however, can be drawn.
[73]

§ 104
. The
present
tendencies of the
English may be determined by observation: and as most of them will be
noticed in the etymological part of this volume, the few here indicated
must be looked upon as illustrations only.

1. The distinction between the subjunctive and indicative mood is
likely to pass away. We verify this by the very general tendency to say

if it is
, and
if he speaks
, rather than
if it be
,
and
if he speak
.

2. The distinction between the participle passive and the past tense
is likely to pass away. We verify this by the tendency to say
it is
broke
, and
he is smote
, for
it is broken
and
he is
smitten
.

3. Of the double forms,
sung
and
sang
,
drank
and

drunk
, &c., one only will be the permanent.

As stated above, these tendencies are but a few out of many, and have
been adduced in order to indicate the subject rather than to exhaust
it.

[77]

PART III.

SOUNDS, LETTERS, PRONUNCIATION, SPELLING.

CHAPTER I.

GENERAL NATURE AND CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF ARTICULATE SOUNDS.

§ 105
. To two points connected with the subject
of the following chapter, the attention of the reader is requested.

a.
In the comparison of sounds the ear is liable to be misled
by the eye. Thus—

The syllables
ka
and
ga
are similar syllables. The vowel
is in each the same, and the consonant is but slightly different. Hence
the words
ka
and
ga
are more allied to each other than the
words
ka
and
ba
,
ka
and
ta
, &c., because
the consonantal sounds of
k
and
g
are more allied than the
consonantal sounds of
k
and
b
,
k
and
t
.

Comparing the syllables
ga
and
ka
, we see the affinity
between the sounds, and we see it at the first glance. It lies on the
surface, and strikes the ear at once.

It is, however, very evident that ways might be devised or might arise
from accident, of concealing the
[78]
likeness between the two sounds, or, at any
rate, of making it less palpable. One of such ways would be a faulty mode
of spelling. If instead of
ga
we wrote
gha
the following
would be the effect: the syllable would appear less simple than it really
was; it would look as if it consisted of three parts instead of two, and
consequently its affinity to
ka
would seem less than it really
was. It is perfectly true that a little consideration would tell us that,
as long as the sound remained the same, the relation of the two syllables
remained the same also; and that, if the contrary appeared to be the
case, the ear was misled by the eye. Still a little consideration would
be required. Now in the English language we have (amongst others) the
following modes of spelling that have a tendency to mislead;—

The sounds of
ph
and of
f
, in
Philip
and

fillip
, differ to the eye, but to the ear are identical. Here a
difference is simulated.

The sounds of
th
in
thin
, and of
th
in

thine
, differ to the ear but to the eye seem the same. Here a
difference is concealed.

Furthermore. These last sounds appear to the eye to be double or
compound. This is not the case; they are simple single sounds, and not
the sounds of
t
followed by
h
, as the spelling leads us to
imagine.

b.
Besides improper modes of spelling, there is another way of
concealing the true nature of sounds. If I say that
ka
and

ga
are allied, the alliance is manifest; since I compare the
actual
sounds
. If I say
ka
and
gee
are allied, the
alliance is concealed; since I compare, not the actual sounds, but only
the
names of the letters
that express those sounds. Now in the
English language we have (amongst others) the following names of letters
that have a tendency to mislead:—
[79]

The sounds
fa
and
va
are allied. The names
eff

and
vee
conceal this alliance.

The sounds
sa
and
za
are allied. The names
ess

and
zed
conceal the alliance.

In comparing sounds it is advisable to have nothing to do either with
letters or names of letters. Compare the sounds themselves.

§ 106
. In many cases it is sufficient, in
comparing consonants, to compare syllables that contain those consonants;

e.g.
, in order to determine the relations of
p
,
b
,

f
,
v
, we say
pa
,
ba
,
fa
,
va
; or
for those of
s
and
z
, we say
sa
,
za
. Here we
compare
syllables
, each consonant being followed by a vowel. At
times this is insufficient. We are often obliged to isolate the consonant
from its vowel, and bring our organs to utter (or half utter) the
imperfect sounds of
p'
,
b'
,
t'
,
d'
.

§ 107
. Let any of the
vowels
(for
instance, the
a
in
father
) be sounded. The lips, the
tongue, and the parts within the throat remain in the same position; and
as long as these remain in the same position the sound is that of the
vowel under consideration. Let, however, a change take place in the
position of the organs of sound; let, for instance, the lips be closed,
or the tongue be applied to the front part of the mouth: in that case the
vowel sound is cut short. It undergoes a change. It terminates in a sound
that is different, according to the state of those organs whereof the
position has been changed. If, on the vowel in question, the lips be
closed, there then arises an imperfect sound of
b
or
p
. If
on the other hand, the tongue be applied to the front teeth, or to the
forepart of the palate, the sound is one (more or less imperfect) of

t
or
d
. This fact illustrates the difference between the
vowels and the consonants. It may be verified
[80]
by pronouncing the

a
in
fate
,
ee
in
feet
,
oo
in

book
,
o
in
note
, &c.

It is a further condition in the formation of a vowel sound, that the
passage of the breath be uninterrupted. In the sound of the
l'
in

lo
(isolated from its vowel) the sound is as continuous as it is
with the
a
in
fate
. Between, however, the consonant

l
and the vowel
a
there is this difference: with
a
,
the passage of the breath is uninterrupted; with
l
, the tongue is
applied to the palate, breaking or arresting the passage of the
breath.

§ 108
. The primary division of our articulate
sounds is into vowels and consonants. The latter are again divided into
liquids (
l
,
m
,
n
,
r
) and mutes (
p
,

b
,
f
,
v
,
t
,
d
,
k
,
g
,

s
,
z
, &c.).

§ 109
.
Sharp and flat.
—Take the
sounds of
p
,
f
,
t
,
k
,
s
. Isolate them
from their vowels, and pronounce them. The sound is the sound of a
whisper.

Let
b
,
v
,
d
,
g
,
z
, be similarly
treated. The sound is no whisper, but one at the natural tone of our
voice.

Now
p
,
f
,
t
,
k
,
s
(with some others
that will be brought forward anon) are
sharp
, whilst
b
,

v
, &c., are
flat
. Instead of
sharp
, some say

hard
, and instead of
flat
, some say
soft
. The terms

sonant
and
surd
are, in a scientific point of view, the
least exceptionable. They have, however, the disadvantage of being
pedantic. The
tenues
of the classics (as far as they go) are
sharp, the
mediæ
flat.

§ 110
.
Continuous and
explosive.
—Isolate the sounds of
b
,
p
,
t
,

d
,
k
,
g
. Pronounce them. You have no power of
prolonging the sounds, or of resting upon them. They escape with the
breath, and they escape at once.

It is not so with
f
,
v
,
sh
,
zh
. Here the
breath is transmitted by degrees, and the sound can be drawn out and
prolonged for an indefinite space of time. Now
b
,
p
,

t
, &c., are explosive,
f
,
v
, &c.,
continuous.
[81]

§ 111
. Concerning the vowels, we may predicate

a
) that they are all continuous,
b
) that they are all
flat.

Concerning the liquids, we may predicate
a
) that they are all
continuous,
b
) that they are all flat.

Concerning the mutes, we may predicate
a
) that one half of them
is flat, and the other half sharp, and
b
) that some are
continuous, and that others are explosive.

§ 112
.—The letter
h
is no

articulate
sound, but only a breathing.

[82]

CHAPTER II.

SYSTEM OF ARTICULATE SOUNDS.

§ 113
.—The attention of the reader is now
directed to the following
foreign
vowel sounds.

1. The
é fermé
, of the French.—This is a sound allied to,
but different from, the
a
in
fate
, and the
ee
in

feet
. It is intermediate to the two.

2. The
u
of the French,
ü
of the Germans,
y
of
the Danes.—This sound is intermediate to the
ee
in

feet
, and the
oo
in
book
.

3. The
o chiuso
, of the Italians.—Intermediate to the

o
in
note
, and the
oo
in
book
.

For these sounds we have the following sequences:
a
in

fate
,
é fermé
,
ee
in
feet
,
ü
in

übel
(German),
oo
in
book
,
o chiuso
,
o

in
note
. And this is the true order of alliance among the vowels;

a
in
fate
, and
o
in
note
, being the extremes;
the other sounds being transitional or intermediate. As the English
orthography is at once singular and faulty, it exhibits the relationship
but imperfectly.

§ 114
.
The system of the
mutes.
—Preliminary to the consideration of the system of the
mutes, let it be observed:—

1. that the
th
in
thin
is a simple single sound,
different from the
th
in
thine
, and that it may be
expressed by the sign
þ
.

2. That the
th
in
thine
is a simple single sound,
different
[83]
from the
th
in
thin
, and that
it may be expressed by the sign
ð
.

3. That the
sh
in
shine
is a simple single sound, and
that it may be expressed by the sign
σ
[42]
(Greek
σῖγμα
).

4. That the
z
in
azure
,
glazier
(French
j
)
is a simple single sound, and that it may be expressed by the sign
ζ
[42]
(Greek

ζῆτα
).

5. That in the Laplandic, and possibly in many other languages, there
are two peculiar sounds, different from any in English, German, and
French, &c., and that they may respectively be expressed by the sign

κ
and the sign
γ
[42]

(Greek
κάππα
and
γάμμα
).

§ 115
. With these preliminary notices we may
exhibit the system of the sixteen mutes; having previously determined the
meaning of two fresh terms, and bearing in mind what was said concerning
the words
sharp
and
flat
,
continuous
and

explosive
.

Lene and aspirate.
—From the sound of
p
in

pat
, the sound of
f
in
fat
differs in a certain
degree. This difference is not owing to a difference in their sharpness
or flatness. Each is sharp. Neither is it owing to a difference in their
continuity or explosiveness; although
f
is continuous, whilst

p
is explosive. This we may ascertain by considering the position
of
s
. The sound of
s
is
continuous
; yet
s
, in
respect to the difference under consideration, is classed not with

f
the continuous sound but with
p
the explosive one. This
difference, which has yet to be properly elucidated, is expressed by a
particular term; and
p
is called
lene
,
f
is called

aspirate
.

As
f
is to
p
so is
v
to
b
.

As
v
is to
b
so is
þ
to
t
.

[84]

As
þ
is to
t
so is
ð
to
d
.

As
ð
is to
d
so is
κ
to
k
.

As
κ
is to
k
so is
γ
to
g
.

As
γ
is to
g
so is
σ
to
s
.

As
σ
is to
s
so is
ζ
to
z
.

Hence
p
,
b
,
t
,
d
,
k
,
g
,

s
,
z
, are
lene
;
f
,
v
,
þ
,

ð
,
κ
,
γ
,
σ
,
ζ
, are
aspirate
. Also
p
,
f
,

t
,
þ
,
k
,
κ
,
s
,

σ
, are
sharp
, whilst
b
,

v
,
d
,
ð
,
g
,
γ
,

z
,
ζ
, are
flat
; so that there
is a double series of relationship capable of being expressed as
follows:—

Lene.
Aspirate.
Sharp.
Flat.

All the so-called aspirates are continuous; and, with the exception of

s
and
z
, all the lenes are explosive.

§ 116
. I believe that in the fact of each mute
appearing in a four-fold form (
i.e.
, sharp, or flat, lene, or
aspirate), lies the essential character of the mutes as opposed to the
liquids.

§ 117
.
Y
and
w
.—These
sounds, respectively intermediate to
γ
and

i
(the
ee
in
feet
), and to
v
and
u

(
oo
in
book
), form a transition from the vowels to the
consonants.

§ 118
. The French word
roi
, and the
English words
oil
,
house
, are specimens of a fresh class of
articulations;
viz.
, of
compound vowel
sounds or
diphthongs. The diphthong
oi
is the vowel
o
+ the

semi
vowel
y
. The diphthongal sound in
roi
is the
vowel
o
+ the semivowel
w
. In
roi
the semivowel
element precedes, in
oil
it follows.
[85]

§ 119
. The words quoted indicate the nature of
the diphthongal system.

1. Diphthongs with the semivowel
w
,
a
)
preceding
,
as in the French word
roi
,
b
)
following
, as in the
English word
new
.

2. Diphthongs with the semivowel
y
,
a
)
preceding
,
as is common in the languages of the Lithuanic and Slavonic stocks,

b
)
following
, as in the word
oil
.

3. Triphthongs with a semivowel both
preceding
and

following
.

The diphthongs in English are four;
ow
as in
house
,

ew
as in
new
,
oi
as in
oil
,
i
as in

bite
,
fight
.

§ 120
.
Chest
,
jest
.—Here we
have
compound consonantal
sounds. The
ch
in
chest
=

t
+
sh
; the
j
in
jest
=
d
+
zh
.
I believe that in these combinations one or both the elements,

viz.
,
t
and
sh
,
d
and
zh
, are
modified; but I am unable to state the exact nature of this
modification.

§ 121
.
Ng.
—The sound of the

ng
in
sing
,
king
,
throng
, when at the end of
a word, or of
singer
,
ringing
, &c., in the middle of a
word, is not the natural sound of the combination
n
and
g
,
each letter retaining its natural power and sound; but a simple single
sound, for which the combination
ng
is a conventional mode of
expression.

§ 122
. Compared with
a
in
fate
,
and the
o
in
note
,
a
in
father
, and the

aw
in
bawl
, are
broad
; the vowels of
note
and

fate
being
slender
.

§ 123
. In
fat
, the vowel is, according to
common parlance,
short
; in
fate
, it is
long
. Here we
have the introduction of two fresh terms. For the words
long
and

short
, I substitute
independent
and
dependent
. If
from the word
fate
I separate the final consonantal sound, the
syllable
fa
remains. In this syllable the
a

[86]
has precisely
the sound that it had before. It remains unaltered. The removal of the
consonant has in nowise modified its sound or power. It is not so,
however, with the vowel in the word
fat
. If from this I remove the
consonant following, and so leave the
a
at the end of the
syllable, instead of in the middle, I must do one of two things: I must
sound it either as the
a
in
fate
, or else as the
a

in
father
. Its (so-called) short sound it cannot retain, unless it
be supported by a consonant following. For this reason it is

dependent
. The same is the case with all the so-called short
sounds,
viz.
, the
e
in
bed
,
i
in
fit
,

u
in
bull
,
o
in
not
,
u
in

but
.

§ 124
. It is not every vowel that is susceptible
of every modification.
I
(
ee
) and
u
(
oo
) are
incapable of becoming
broad
. The
e
in
bed
, although
both broad and slender, is incapable of becoming
independent
. For
the
u
in
but
, and for the
ö
of certain foreign
languages, I have no satisfactory systematic position.

CHAPTER III.

OF CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF ARTICULATE SOUNDS.

§ 127
. Certain combinations of articulate sounds
are incapable of being pronounced. The following rule is one that, in the
forthcoming pages, will frequently be referred to.
Two (or more)

mutes
, of different degrees of sharpness and flatness, are
incapable of coming together in the same syllable.
For instance,

b
,
v
,
d
,
g
,
z
, &c., being flat,
and
p
,
f
,
t
,
k
,
s
, &c., being
sharp, such combinations as
abt
,
avt
,
apd
,

afd
,
agt
,
akd
,
atz
,
ads
, &c., are
unpronounceable.
Spelt
, indeed, they may be; but all attempts at

pronunciation
end in a
change
of the combination. In this
case either the flat letter is really changed to its sharp equivalent
(
b
to
p
,
d
to
t
, &c.) or
vice
versâ
(
p
to
b
,
t
to
d
). The combinations

abt
and
agt
, to be pronounced, must become either

apt
or
abd
, or else
akt
or
agd
.

The word
mutes
in the third sentence of this section must be
dwelt on. It is only with the
mutes
that there is an impossibility
of pronouncing the heterogeneous combinations above-mentioned. The
liquids and the vowels are flat; but the liquids and vowels, although
flat, may be followed by a sharp consonant. If this were not the case,
the combinations
ap
,
at
,
alp
,
alt
, &c.,
would be unpronounceable.

The semivowels, also, although flat, admit of being followed by a
sharp consonant.
[89]

§ 128
.
Unstable combinations.
—That
certain sounds in combination with others have a tendency to undergo
farther changes, may be collected from the observation of our own
language, as we find it spoken by those around us, or by ourselves. The
diphthong
ew
is a sample of what may be called an unsteady or

unstable
combination. There is a natural tendency to change it
either into
oo
or
yoo
; perhaps also into
yew
. Hence

new
is sometimes sounded
noo
, sometimes
nyoo
, and
sometimes
nyew
.

§ 129
.
Effect of the semivowel
y
on
certain letters when they precede it.
—Taken by itself the
semivowel
y
, followed by a vowel (
ya
,
yee
,

yo
,
you
, &c.), forms a stable combination. Not so,
however, if it be preceded by a consonant, of the series
t
or

s
, as
tya
,
tyo
;
dya
,
dyo
;
sya
,

syo
. There then arises an unstable combination.
Sya
and

syo
we pronounce as
sha
and
sho
;
tya
and

tyo
we pronounce as
cha
and
ja
(
i.e.
,

tsh
,
dzh
). This we may verify from our pronunciation of
words like
sure
,
picture
,
verdure
(
shoor
,

pictshoor
,
verdzhoor
), having previously remarked that the

u
in those words is not sounded as
oo
but as
yoo
.
The effect of the semivowel
y
, taken with the instability of the
combination
ew
, accounts for the tendency to pronounce
dew

as if written
jew
.

§ 130
.
Double consonants rare.
—It
cannot be too clearly understood that in words like
pitted
,

stabbing
,
massy
, &c., there is no real reduplication of
the sounds of
t
,
b
, and
s
, respectively. Between the
words
pitted
(as with the small-pox) and
pitied
(as being
an object of pity) there is a difference in spelling only. In speech the
words are identical.
The reduplication of the consonant is, in English
and the generality of languages, a
[90]
conventional mode of
expressing in writing the shortness or dependence, of the vowel
preceding.

§ 131
. Real reduplications of consonants,

i.e.
, reduplications of their
sound
, are, in all languages,
extremely rare. In English they occur only under one condition. In

compound
and
derived
words, where the original root

ends
, and the superadded affix
begins
, with the same
letter, there is a reduplication of the sound and not otherwise. In the
word
soulless
, the
l
is doubled to the ear as well as to
the eye; and it is a false pronunciation to call it
souless

(
soless
). In the "Deformed Transformed" it is made to rhyme with

no less
, improperly:—

"Clay, not dead but soulless,

Though no mortal man would choose thee,

An immortal no less

Deigns not to refuse thee."

In the following words, all of which are compounds, we have true
specimens of the doubled consonant.

n

is doubled in
unnatural
,
innate
,
oneness
.

l
—
soulless
,
civil-list
,
palely
.

k
—
book-case
.

t
—
seaport-town
.

It must not, however, be concealed, that, in the mouths even of
correct speakers, one of the doubled sounds is often dropped.

§ 132
.
True aspirates rare.
—The
criticism applied to words like
pitted
, &c., applies also to
words like
Philip
,
thin
,
thine
, &c. There is
therein no sound of
h
. How the so-called aspirates differ from
their corresponding lenes has not yet been determined. That it is

not
by the addition of
h
is evident.
Ph
and

th
are conventional modes of spelling simple single sounds, which
might better be expressed by simple single signs.
[91]

In our own language the
true
aspirates, like the true
reduplications, are found only in compound words; and there they are
often slurred in the pronunciation.

We find
p
and
h
in the words
haphazard

upholder
.

b
and
h
—
abhorrent

cub-hunting

CHAPTER IV.

EUPHONY AND THE PERMUTATION OF LETTERS.

§ 133
. 1. Let there be two syllables of which
the one ends in
m
, and the other begins with
r
, as we have
in the syllables
num-
and
-rus
of the Latin word

numerus
.

2. Let an ejection of the intervening letters bring these two
syllables into immediate contact,
numrus
. The
m
and

r
form an unstable combination. To remedy this there is a tendency
to insert an intervening sound.

In English, the form which the Latin word
numerus
takes is

num
b
er
; in Spanish,
nom
b
re
. The
b

makes no part of the original word, but has been inserted for the sake of

euphony
; or, to speak more properly, by a euphonic process. The
word euphony is derived from
εὖ
(
well
), and
φώνη
(
fônæ
, a voice).

§ 134
. In the words
give
and
gave

we have a change of tense expressed by a change of vowel. In the words

price
and
prize
a change of meaning is expressed by a
change of consonant. In
clothe
and
clad
there is a change
both of a vowel and of a consonant. In the words
to use
and
a
use
there is a similar change, although it is not expressed by the
spelling. To the ear the verb
to use
ends in
z
, although
not to the eye. All these are instances of the
permutation
of
letters.

CHAPTER V.

ON THE FORMATION OF SYLLABLES.

§ 135
. In respect to the formation of syllables,
I am aware of no more than one point that requires any especial
consideration.

In certain words, of more than one syllable, it is difficult to say to
which syllable an intervening consonant belongs. For instance, does the

v
in
river
, and the
e
in
fever
, belong to the
first or the second syllable? Are the words to be divided thus,

ri-ver
,
fe-ver
? or thus,
riv-er
,
feve-r
?

The solution of the question lies by no means on the surface.

In the first place, the case is capable of being viewed in two points
of view—an etymological and a phonetic one.

That the
c
and
r
in
become
,
berhymed
,
&c., belong to the second syllable, we determine at once by taking
the words to pieces; whereby we get the words
come
and

rhymed
in an isolated independent form. But this fact, although it
settles the point in etymology, leaves it as it was in phonetics; since
it in nowise follows, that, because the
c
in the
simple

word
come
is exclusively attached to the letter that succeeds, it
is, in the
compound
word
become
, exclusively attached to it
also.

To the following point of structure in the consonantal sounds the
reader's attention is particularly directed.
[96]

1. Let the vowel
a
(as in
fate
) be sounded.—2. Let
it be followed by the consonant
p
, so as to form the syllable

āp
. To form the sound of
p
, it will be found that the
lips close on the sound of
a
, and arrest it. Now, if the lips be
left to themselves they will not
remain
closed on the sound, but
will open again; in a slight degree indeed, but in a degree sufficient to
cause a kind of vibration, or, at any rate, to allow an escape of the
remainder of the current of breath by which the sound was originally
formed. To re-open in a slight degree is the natural tendency of the lips
in the case exhibited above.

Now, by an effort, let this tendency to re-open be counteracted. Let
the remaining current of breath be cut short. We have, then, only this,

viz.
, so much of the syllable
āp
as can be formed by
the
closure
of the lips. All that portion of it that is caused by
their re-opening is deficient. The resulting sound seems truncated, cut
short, or incomplete. It is the sound of
p
,
minus
the
remnant of breath. All of the sound
p
that is now left is formed,
not by the
escape
of the breath, but by the
arrest
of
it.

The
p
in
āp
is a
final
sound. With initial
sounds the case is different. Let the lips be
closed
, and let an
attempt be made to form the syllable
pa
by suddenly opening them.
The sound appears incomplete; but its incompleteness is at the

beginning
of the sound, and not at the end of it. In the natural
course of things there would have been a current of breath

preceding
, and this current would have given a vibration, now
wanting. All the sound that is formed here is formed, not by the

arrest
of breath, but by the
escape
of it.

I feel that this account of the mechanism of the apparently simple
sound
p
, labours under all the difficulties
[97]
that attend the

description
of a sound; and for this reason I again request the
reader to satisfy himself either of its truth or of its inaccuracy,
before he proceeds to the conclusions that will be drawn from it.

The account, however, being recognized, we have in the sound of

p
, two elements:—

1. That formed by the current of air and the closure of the lips, as
in
ap
. This may be called the sound of breath
arrested
.

2. That formed by the current of air, and the opening of the lips, as
in
pa
. This may be called the sound of breath
escaping
.

Now what may be said of
p
may be said of all the other
consonants, the words
tongue
,
teeth
, &c., being used
instead of
lips
, according to the case.

Let the sound of breath
arrested
be expressed by
π
, and that of breath
escaping
be expressed
by
ϖ
, the two together form
p

(
π
+
ϖ
=

p
).

Thus
ap
(as quoted above) is
p
-
ϖ
, or
π
; whilst

pa
(sounded similarly) is
p
-
π
, or
ϖ
.

In the formation of syllables, I consider that the sound of breath
arrested belongs to the first, and the sound of breath escaping to the
second syllable; that if each sound were expressed by a separate sign,
the word
happy
would be divided thus,
ha
π
-
ϖ
y
; and
that such would be the case with all consonants between two syllables.
The
whole
consonant belongs neither to one syllable nor the other.
Half of it belongs to each. The reduplication of the
p
in

happy
, the
t
in
pitted
, &c., is a mere point of
spelling.

[98]

CHAPTER VI.

ON QUANTITY.

§ 136
. The dependent vowels, as the
a
in

fat
,
i
in
fit
,
u
in
but
,
o
in

not
, have the character of being uttered with rapidity, and they
pass quickly in the enunciation, the voice not resting on them. This
rapidity of utterance becomes more evident when we contrast with them the
prolonged sounds of the
a
in
fate
,
ee
in

feet
,
oo
in
book
, or
o
in
note
;
wherein the utterance is retarded, and wherein the voice rests, delays,
or is prolonged. The
f
and
t
of
fate
are separated
by a longer interval than the
f
and
t
of
fat
; and
the same is the case with
fit
,
feet
, &c.

Let the
n
and the
t
of
not
be each as 1, the

o
also being as 1; then each letter, consonant or vowel, shall
constitute ⅓ of the whole word.

Let, however, the
n
and the
t
of
note
be
each as 1, the
o
being as 2. Then, instead of each consonant
constituting ⅓ of the whole word, it shall constitute but ¼.

Upon the comparative extent to which the voice is prolonged, the
division of vowels and syllables into
long
and
short
has
been established: the
o
in
note
being long, the
o
in

not
being short. And the longness or shortness of a vowel or
syllable is said to be its
quantity
.

§ 137
. Attention is directed to the word

vowel
. The longness or shortness of a
vowel
is one thing.
The longness or shortness of a
syllable
another. This difference
is
[99]
important in prosody; especially in
comparing the English with the classical metres.

The vowel in the syllable
see
is long; and long it remains,
whether it stand as it is, or be followed by a consonant, as in

see-n
, or by a vowel, as in
see-ing
.

The vowel in the word
sit
is short. If followed by a vowel it
becomes unpronounceable, except as the
ea
in
seat
or the

i
in
sight
. By a consonant, however, it
may
be
followed. Such is the case in the word quoted—
sit
. Followed
by a
second
consonant, it still retains its shortness,

e.g.
,
sits
. Whatever the comparative length of the

syllables
,
see
and
seen
,
sit
and
sits
,
may be, the length of their respective
vowels
is the same.

Now, if we determine the character of the syllable by the character of
the vowel, all syllables are short wherein there is a short vowel, and
all are long wherein there is a long one. Hence, measured by the quantity
of the vowel, the word
sits
is short, and the syllable
see-

in
seeing
is long.

§ 138
. But it is well known that this view is
not the view commonly taken of the syllables
see
(in

seeing
) and
sits
. It is well known, that, in the eyes of a
classical scholar, the
see
(in
seeing
) is short, and that
in the word
sits
the
i
is long.

The classic differs from the Englishman thus,—
He measures his
quantity, not by the length of the vowel, but by the length of the
syllable taken altogether.
The perception of this distinction enables
us to comprehend the following statements.

a.
That vowels long by nature may
appear
to become short
by position, and
vice versâ
.

b.
That, by a laxity of language, the
vowel
may be said
to have changed its quantity, whilst it is the
syllable
alone that
has been altered.
[100]

c.
That if one person measures his quantities by the vowels,
and another by the syllables, what is short to the one, shall be long to
the other, and
vice versâ
. The same is the case with nations.

d.
That one of the most essential differences between the
English and the classical languages is that the quantities (as far as
they go) of the first are measured by the vowel, those of the latter by
the syllable. To a Roman the word
monument
consists of two short
syllables and one long one; to an Englishman it contains three short
syllables.

[101]

CHAPTER VII.

ON ACCENT.

§ 139
. In the word
tyrant
there is an
emphasis, or stress, upon the first syllable. In the word
presume

there is an emphasis, or stress, on the second syllable. This emphasis,
or stress, is called
accent
. The circumstance of a syllable
bearing an accent is sometimes expressed by a mark (′); in which
case the word is said to be accentuated,
i.e.
, to have the accent
signified in writing.

Words accented on the last syllable—
Brigáde
,

preténce
,
harpoón
,
reliéve
,
detér
,

assúme
,
besóught
,
beréft
,
befóre
,

abroád
,
abóde
,
abstrúse
,
intermíx
,

superádd
,
cavaliér
.

Words accented on the last syllable but one—
An'chor
,

ar'gue
,
hásten
,
fáther
,
fóxes
,

smíting
,
húsband
,
márket
,
vápour
,

bárefoot
,
archángel
,
bespátter
,
disáble
,

terrífic
.

Words accented on the last syllable but two—
Reg'ular
,

an'tidote
,
for'tify
,
suscéptible
,

incontrovértible
.

Words accented on the last syllable but three
(rare)—
Réceptacle
,
régulating
,
tálkativeness
,

ábsolutely
,
lúminary
,
inévitable
, &c.

§ 140
. A great number of words are distinguished
by the difference of accent alone.

An
áttribute
.
To
attríbute
.

The month
Aúgust
.
An
augúst
person.

A
com'pact
.
Compáct
(close).

[102]

To
con'jure
(magically).
Conjúre
(enjoin).

Des'ert
, wilderness.
Desért
, merit.

Inválid
, not valid.
Invalíd
, a sickly person.

Mínute
, 60 seconds.
Minúte
, small.

Súpine
, part of speech.
Supíne
, careless, &c.

§ 141
. In
týrant
and
presúme
, we
deal with single words; and in each
word
we determine which

syllable
is accented. Contrasted with the sort of accent that
follows, this may be called a
verbal
accent.

In the line,

Better for
us
, perhaps, it might appear,—(Pope's "Essay on Man,"
I.
169.)

the pronoun
us
is strongly brought forward. An especial stress
or emphasis is laid upon it, denoting that
there are other beings to
whom it might not appear
, &c. This is collected from the context.
Here there is a
logical
accent. "When one word in a sentence is
distinguished by a stress, as more important than the rest, we may say
that it is
emphatical
, or that an
emphasis
is laid upon it.
When one syllable in a word is distinguished by a stress, and more
audible than the rest, we say that it is accented, or that an accent is
put upon it. Accent, therefore, is to syllables what emphasis is to
sentences; it distinguishes one from the crowd, and brings it forward to
observation."—Nares' "Orthoepy," part ii. chap. 1.

[103]

CHAPTER VIII.

ORTHOGRAPHY.

§ 142
.
Orthoepy
, a word derived from the
Greek
orthon
(
upright
), and
epos
(
a word
),
signifies the right utterance of words. Orthoepy determines words, and
deals with a language as it is
spoken
;
orthography

determines the correct spelling of words, and deals with a language as it
is
written
. This latter term is derived from the Greek words

orthos
(
upright
), and
graphé
, or
grafæ

(
writing
). Orthography is less essential to language than
orthoepy; since all languages are spoken, whilst but a few languages are
written. Orthography presupposes orthoepy. Orthography addresses itself
to the eye, orthoepy to the ear. Orthoepy deals with the articulate
sounds that constitute syllables and words; orthography treats of the
signs by which such articulate sounds are expressed in writing. A

letter
is the sign of an articulate (and, in the case of
h
,
of an inarticulate) sound.

§ 143
. A full and perfect system of orthography
consists in two things:—1. The possession of a sufficient and
consistent alphabet. 2. The right application of such an alphabet. This
position may be illustrated more fully.

§ 144
. First, in respect to a sufficient and
consistent alphabet—Let there be in a certain language, simple
single articulate sounds, to the number of forty, whilst the simple
single signs, or letters, expressive of them, amount to no more than

thirty
. In this case the alphabet
[104]
is insufficient. It is
not full enough: since ten of the simple single articulate sounds have no
corresponding signs whereby they may be expressed. In our own language,
the sounds (amongst others) of
th
in
thin
, and of
th

in
thine
, are simple and single, whilst there is no sign equally
simple and single to spell them with.

§ 145
. An alphabet, however, may be sufficient,
and yet imperfect. It may err on the score of inconsistency. Let there be
in a given language two simple single sounds, (for instance) the
p

in
pate
, and the
f
in
fate
. Let these sounds stand
in a given relation to each other. Let a given sign, for instance,
פ

(as is actually the case in Hebrew), stand for the
p
in

pate
; and let a second sign be required for the
f
in

fate
. Concerning the nature of this latter sign, two views may be
taken. One framer of the alphabet, perceiving that the two sounds are
mere modifications of each other, may argue that no new sign (or letter)
is at all necessary, but that the sound of
f
in
fate
may be
expressed by a mere modification of the sign (or letter)
פ
, and may be
written thus
פּ
, or thus
פ
′ or

פ
`, &c.; upon the principle that like
sounds should be expressed by like signs. The other framer of the
alphabet, contemplating the difference between the two sounds, rather
than the likeness, may propose, not a mere modification of the sign
פ
,
but a letter altogether new, such as
f
, or
φ
, &c., upon the principle that sounds of a given degree
of dissimilitude should be expressed by signs of a different degree of
dissimilitude.

Hitherto the expression of the sounds in point is a matter of
convenience only. No question has been raised as to its consistency or
inconsistency. This begins under conditions like the following:—Let
there be in the language in point the sounds of the
t
in

tin
,
[105]
and of the
th
in
thin
; which
(it may be remembered) are precisely in the same relation to each other
as the
p
in
pate
and the
f
in
fate
. Let each
of these sounds have a sign or letter expressive of it. Upon the nature
of these signs, or letters, will depend the nature of the sign or letter
required for the
f
in
fate
. If the letter expressing the

th
in
thin
be a mere modification of the letter expressing
the
t
in
tin
, then must the letter expressive of the

f
in
fate
be a mere modification of the letter expressing
the
p
in
pate
, and
vice versâ
. If this be not the
case, the alphabet is inconsistent.

In the English alphabet we have (amongst others) the following
inconsistency:—The sound of the
f
in
fate
, in a
certain relation to the sound of the
p
in
pate
, is
expressed by a totally distinct sign; whereas, the sound of the
th

in
thin
(similarly related to the
t
in
tin
) is
expressed by no new sign, but by a mere modification of
t
; viz.,

th
.

§ 146
. A third element in the faultiness of an
alphabet is the fault of erroneous representation. The best illustration
of this we get from the Hebrew alphabet, where the sounds of
ת
and

ט
, mere
varieties
of each other, are
represented by distinct and dissimilar signs, whilst
ת
and
תּ
,
sounds
specifically
distinct, are expressed by a mere modification
of the same sign, or letter.

§ 147
.
The right application of an
alphabet.
—An alphabet may be both sufficient and consistent,
accurate in its representation of the alliances between articulate
sounds, and in no wise redundant; and yet, withal, it may be so wrongly
applied as to be defective. Of defect in the use or application of the
letters of an alphabet, the three main causes are the
following:—

a.

Unsteadiness in the power of letters.
—Of this
there are two kinds. In the first, there is one sound with two (or more)
ways of expressing it. Such is the sound of
[106]
the letter
f
in
English. In words of Anglo-Saxon origin it is spelt with a single simple
sign, as in
fill
; whilst in Greek words it is denoted by a
combination, as in
Philip
. The reverse of this takes place with
the letter
g
; here a single sign has a double power; in

gibbet
it is sounded as
j
, and in
gibberish
as

g
in
got
.

b.

The aim at secondary objects.
—The natural aim
of orthography, of spelling, or of writing, is to express the

sounds
of a language. Syllables and words it takes as they meet
the ear, it translates them by appropriate signs, and so paints them, as
it were, to the eye. That this is the natural and primary object is
self-evident; but beyond this natural and primary object there is, with
the orthographical systems of most languages, a secondary one,

viz.
, the attempt to combine with the representation of the sound
of a given word, the representation of its history and origin.

The sound of the
c
, in
city
, is the sound that we
naturally spell with the letter
s
, and if the expression of this
sound was the
only
object of our orthographists, the word would be
spelt accordingly (
sity
). The following facts, however, traverse
this simple view of the matter. The word is a derived word; it is
transplanted into our own language from the Latin, where it is spelt with
a
c
(
civitas
); and to change this
c
into
s

conceals the origin and history of the word. For this reason the
c

is retained, although, as far as the mere expression of sounds (the
primary object in orthography) is concerned, the letter is a superfluity.
In cases like the one adduced the orthography is bent to a secondary end,
and is traversed by the etymology.

c.

Obsoleteness.
—It is very evident that modes of
spelling which at one time may have been correct, may, by a change of
pronunciation, become incorrect; so that
[107]
orthography becomes
obsolete whenever there takes place a change of speech without a
correspondent change of spelling.

§ 148
. From the foregoing sections we arrive at
the theory of a full and perfect alphabet and orthography, of which a few
(amongst many others) of the chief conditions are as follow:—

1. That for every simple single sound, incapable of being represented
by a combination of letters, there be a simple single sign.

2. That sounds within a determined degree of likeness be represented
by signs within a determined degree of likeness; whilst sounds beyond a
certain degree of likeness be represented by distinct and different
signs,
and that uniformly
.

3. That no sound have more than one sign to express it.

4. That no sign express more than one sound.

5. That the primary aim of orthography be to express the sounds of
words, and not their histories.

6. That changes of speech be followed by corresponding changes of
spelling.

With these principles in our mind we may measure the imperfections of
our own and of other alphabets.

§ 149
. Previous to considering the sufficiency
or insufficiency of the English alphabet, it is necessary to enumerate
the elementary articulate sounds of the language. The vowels belonging to
the English language are the following
twelve
:—

1.
That of
a
in
father
.
7.
That of
e
in
bed
.

6.

[108]

The diphthongal sounds are

1.
That of

2.

.

3.
—
oi

.

4.

.

This last sound being most incorrectly expressed by the single letter

i
.

The consonantal sounds are, 1. the two semivowels; 2. the four
liquids; 3. fourteen out of the sixteen mutes; 4.
ch
in

chest
, and
j
in

, compound sibilants; 5.

§ 150
. Some writers would add to these the
additional sound of the
é fermé
of the French; believing that the
vowel in words like
their
and
vein
has a different sound
from the vowel in words like
there
and
vain
. For my own
part I cannot detect such a difference either in my own speech or that of
my neighbours; although I am far from denying that in certain

dialects
of our language such may have been the case. The
following is an extract from the "Danish Grammar for Englishmen," by
Professor Rask, whose eye, in the matter in question, seems to have
misled his ear; "The
[109]
é fermé
, or
close é
, is very
frequent in Danish, but scarcely perceptible in English; unless in such
words as
their
,
vein
,
veil
, which appear to sound a
little different from
there
,
vain
,
vale
."

§ 151
. The vowels being twelve, the diphthongs
four, and the consonantal sounds twenty-four, we have altogether as many
as forty sounds, some being so closely allied to each other as to be mere
modifications, and others being combinations rather than simple sounds;
all, however, agreeing in requiring to be expressed by letters or by
combinations of letters, and to be distinguished from each other. This
enables us to appreciate—

§ 152
.
The insufficiency of the English
alphabet.
—

a.

In respect to the vowels.
—Notwithstanding the
fact that the sounds of the
a
in
father
,
fate
, and

fat
, and of the
o
and the
aw
in
note
,

not
, and
bawl
, are modifications of
a
and
o

respectively, we have still
six
vowel sounds specifically
distinct, for which (
y
being a consonant rather than a vowel) we
have but
five
signs. The
u
in
duck
, specifically
distinct from the
u
in
bull
, has no specifically distinct
sign to represent it.

b.

In respect to the consonants
.—The
th
in

thin
, the
th
in
thine
, the
sh
in

shine
, the
z
in
azure
, and the
ng
in

king
, five sounds specifically distinct, and five sounds perfectly
simple require corresponding signs, which they have not.

§ 153
.
Its inconsistency.
—The

f
in
fan
, and the
v
in
van
, sounds in a
certain degree of relationship to
p
and
b
, are expressed by
sounds as unlike as
f
is unlike
p
, and as
v
is
unlike
b
. The sound of the
th
in
thin
, the
th

in
thine
, the
sh
in
shine
, similarly related to

t
,
d
, and
s
, are expressed by signs as like

t
,
d
, and
s
, respectively, as
th
and

sh
.

The compound sibilant sound of
j
in
jest
is spelt with

[110]
the single sign
j
, whilst the
compound sibilant sound in
chest
is spelt with the combination

ch
.

§ 154
.
Erroneousness.
—The sound of
the
ee
in
feet
is considered the long (independent) sound
of the
e
in
bed
; whereas it is the long (independent) sound
of the
i
in
pit
.

The
i
in
bite
is considered as the long (independent)
sound of the
i
in
pit
; whereas it is a diphthongal
sound.

The
u
in
duck
is looked upon as a modification of the

u
in
bull
; whereas it is a specifically distinct sound.

The
ou
in
house
and the
oi
in
oil
are
looked upon as the compounds of
o
and
i
and of
o
and

u
respectively; whereas the latter element of them is not
i

and
u
, but
y
and
w
.

The
th
in
thin
and the
th
in
thine
are
dealt with as one and the same sound; whereas they are sounds
specifically distinct.

The
ch
in
chest
is dealt with as a modification of

c
(either with the power of
k
or of
s
); whereas its
elements are
t
and
sh
.

§ 155
.
Redundancy.
—As far as the
representation of sounds is concerned the letter
c
is superfluous.
In words like
citizen
it may be replaced by
s
; in words
like
cat
by
k
. In
ch
, as in
chest
, it has no
proper place. In
ch
, as in
mechanical
,
it
may be replaced
by
k
.

Q
is superfluous,
cw
or
kw
being its
equivalent.

X
also is superfluous,
ks
,
gz
, or
z
, being
equivalent to it.

The diphthongal forms
æ
and
œ
, as in
Æneas

and
Crœsus
, except in the way of etymology, are superfluous
and redundant.

§ 156
.
Unsteadiness.
—Here we have
(amongst many
[111]
other examples), 1. The consonant
c

with the double power of
s
and
k
; 2.
g
with its
sound in
gun
and also with its sound in
gin
; 3.
x

with its sounds in
Alexander
,
apoplexy
,

Xenophon
.

In the foregoing examples a single sign has a double power; in the
words
Philip
and
filip
, &c.; a single sound has a
double sign.

In respect to the degree wherein the English orthography is made
subservient to etymology, it is sufficient to repeat the statement that
as many as three letters
c
,
æ
, and
œ
are
retained in the alphabet for
etymological purposes only
.

§ 157
. The defects noticed in the preceding
sections are
absolute
defects, and would exist, as they do at
present, were there no language in the world except the English. This is
not the case with those that are now about to be noticed; for them,
indeed, the word
defect
is somewhat too strong a term. They may
more properly be termed inconveniences.

Compared with the languages of the rest of the world the use of many
letters in the English alphabet is
singular
. The letter
i

(when long or independent) is, with the exception of England, generally
sounded as
ee
. With Englishmen it has a diphthongal power. The
inconvenience of this is the necessity that it imposes upon us, in
studying foreign languages, of unlearning the sound which we give it in
our own, and of learning the sound which it bears in the language
studied. So it is (amongst many others) with the letter
j
. In
English this has the sound of
dzh
, in French of
zh
, and in
German of
y
. From singularity in the use of letters arises
inconvenience in the study of foreign tongues.

In using
j
as
dzh
there is a second objection. It is not
only inconvenient, but it is theoretically incorrect.
[112]
The letter

j
was originally a modification of the vowel
i
. The
Germans, who used it as the semivowel
y
, have perverted it from
its original power less than the English have done, who sound it

dzh
.

With these views we may appreciate in the English alphabet and
orthography—

Its convenience or inconvenience in respect to learning foreign
tongues.
—The sound given to the
a
in
fate
is
singular. Other nations sound it as
a
in
father
.

The sound given to the
e
, long (or independent), is singular.
Other nations sound it either as
a
in
fate
, or as
é
fermé
.

The sound given to the
i
in
bite
is singular. Other
nations sound it as
ee
in
feet
.

The sound given to the
oo
in
fool
is singular. Other
nations sound it as the
o
in
note
, or as the
ó
chiuso
.

The sound given to the
u
in
duck
is singular. Other
nations sound it as the
u
in
bull
.

The sound given to the
ou
in
house
is singular. Other
nations, more correctly, represent it by
au
or
aw
.

The sound given to the
w
in
wet
is somewhat singular,
but is also correct and convenient. With many nations it is not found at
all, whilst with those where it occurs it has the sound (there or
thereabouts) of
v
.

The sound given to
y
is somewhat singular. In Danish it has a
vowel power. In German the semivowel sound is spelt with
j
.

The sound given to
z
is not the sound which it has in German
and Italian, but its power in English is convenient and correct.

The sound given to
ch
in
chest
is singular. In other
languages it has generally a guttural sound; in French that of
sh
.
The English usage is more correct than the French, but less correct than
the German.
[113]

The sound given to
j
(as said before) is singular.

§ 158
.
The historical propriety or
impropriety of certain letters.
—The use of
i
with a
diphthongal power is not only singular and inconvenient, but also

historically incorrect
. The Greek
iota
, from whence it
originates, has the sound of
i
and
ee
, as in
pit
and

feet
.

The
y
, sounded as in
yet
, is historically incorrect. It
grew out of the Greek
υ
, a vowel, and no
semivowel. The Danes still use it as such, that is, with the power of the
German
ü
.

The use of
j
for
dzh
is historically incorrect.

The use of
c
for
k
in words derived from the Greek as

mechanical
,
ascetic
, &c., is historically incorrect.
The form
c
is the representative of
γ
and
σ
and not
of the Greek
kappa
.

§ 159
.
On certain conventional modes of
spelling.
—In the Greek language the sounds of
o
in

not
and of
o
in
note
(although allied) are expressed
by the unlike signs (or letters)
ο
and

ω
, respectively. In most other languages
the difference between the sounds is considered too slight to require for
its expression signs so distinct and dissimilar. In some languages the
difference is neglected altogether. In many, however, it is expressed,
and that by some modification of the original letter.

Let the sign (ˉ) denote that the vowel over which it stands is
long, or independent, whilst the sign (˘) indicates shortness, or
dependence. In such a case, instead of writing
not
and
n
ω
t
, like the Greeks, we may write

nŏt
and
nōt
, the sign serving for a fresh
letter. Herein the expression of the nature of the sound is natural,
because the natural use of (ˉ) and (˘) is to express length
or shortness, dependence or independence. Now, supposing the broad sound
of
o
to be
[114]
already represented, it is very evident
that, of the other two sounds of
o
, the one must be long
(independent), and the other short (dependent); and as it is only
necessary to express one of these conditions, we may, if we choose, use
the sign (ˉ) alone; its presence denoting length, and its absence
shortness (independence or dependence).

As signs of this kind, one mark is as good as another; and instead of
(ˉ) we may, if we chose, substitute such a mark as (′) and
write
nót
=
nōt
=
n
ω
t
=
nōte
; provided only that
the sign (′) expresses no other condition or affection of a sound.
This use of the mark (′), as a sign that the vowel over which it is
placed is long (independent), is common in many languages. But is this
use of (′) natural? For a reason that the reader has anticipated,
it is not natural, but conventional. Neither is it convenient. It is used
elsewhere not as the sign of
quantity
, but as the sign of

accent
; consequently, being placed over a letter, and being
interpreted according to its natural meaning, it gives the idea, not that
the syllable is long, but that it is emphatic or accented. Its use as a
sign of quantity then, would be an orthographical expedient, or an
inconvenient conventional mode of spelling.

The English language abounds in orthographical expedients; the modes
of expressing the quantity of the vowels being particularly numerous. To
begin with these:—

The reduplication of a vowel where there is but one syllable (as in

feet
,
cool
), is an orthographical expedient. It merely
means that the syllable is long (or independent).

The juxtaposition of two different vowels, where there is but one
syllable (as in
plain
,
moan
), is an
[115]
orthographical
expedient. It generally means the same as the reduplication of a vowel,

i.e.
, that the syllable is long (independent).

The addition of the
e
mute, as in
plane
,
whale

(whatever may have been its origin), is, at present, but an
orthographical expedient. It denotes the lengthening of the syllable.

The reduplication of the consonant after a vowel, as in

spotted
,
torrent
, is in most cases but an orthographical
expedient. It merely denotes that the preceding vowel is short
(dependent).

The use of
ph
for
f
in
Philip
, is an
orthographical expedient, founded upon etymological reasons.

The use of
th
for the simple sound of the first consonant in

thin
and
thine
, is an orthographical expedient. The
combination must be dealt with as a single letter.

Caution.
—The
letters

x
and
q
are not orthographical expedients.
They are orthographical
compendiums
,
x
=
ks
, and

q
=
kw
.

[116]

CHAPTER IX.

HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE ENGLISH ALPHABET.

§ 160
. The preceding chapter has exhibited the
theory of a full and perfect alphabet; it has shown how far the English
alphabet falls short of such a standard; and, above all, it has exhibited
some of the conventional modes of spelling which the insufficiency of
alphabets, combined with other causes, has engendered. The present
chapter gives a
history
of our alphabet, whereby many of its
defects are
accounted for
. These defects, it may be said, once for
all, the English alphabet shares with those of the rest of the world;
although, with the doubtful exception of the French, it possesses them in
a higher degree than any.

With few, if any exceptions,
all the modes of writing in the world
originate
, directly or indirectly, from the Phœnician.

At a certain period the alphabet of Palestine, Phœnicia, and the
neighboring languages of the Semitic tribes, consisted of

twenty-two
separate and distinct letters.

Now the chances are, that, let a language possess as few elementary
articulate sounds as possible, an alphabet of only
twenty-two

letters will be insufficient.

Hence it may safely be asserted, that the original Semitic alphabet
was
insufficient
for even the
Semitic
languages.

§ 161
. In this state it was imported into
Greece.
[117]
Now, as it rarely happens that any two
languages have precisely the same elementary articulate sounds, so it
rarely happens that an alphabet can be transplanted from one tongue to
another, and be found to suit. When such is the case, alterations are
required. The extent to which these alterations are made at all, or (if
made) made on a right principle varies with different languages. Some

adapt
an introduced alphabet well: others badly.

Of the
twenty-two
Phœnician letters the Greeks took but

twenty-one
. The eighteenth letter,
tsadi

צ
was never
imported into Europe.

Compared with the Semitic, the

[118]

The alphabet of Phœnicia and Palestine being adapted to the
language of Greece, the first change took place in the manner of writing.
The Phœnicians wrote from right to left; the Greeks from left to
right. Besides this, the following principles were recognised;—

a.
Letters for which there was no use were left behind. This
was the case, as seen above, with the eighteenth letter,

tsadi
.

b.
Letters expressive of sounds for which there was no precise
equivalent in Greek, were used with other powers. This was the case with
letters 5, 8, 16, and probably with some others.

c.
Letters of which the original sound, in the course of time,
became changed, were allowed, as it were, to drop out of the alphabet.
This was the case with 6 and 19.

d.
For such simple single elementary articulate sounds as there
was no sign or letter representant, new signs, or letters, were invented.
This principle gave to the Greek alphabet the new signs
φ
,
χ
,
υ
,
ω
.

e.
The new signs were not mere modifications of the older ones,
but totally new letters.

All this was correct in principle; and the consequence is, that the
Greek alphabet, although not originally meant to express a European
tongue at all, expresses the Greek language well.

§ 162
. But it was not from the Greek that our
own alphabet was immediately derived; although ultimately
[119]
it is
referable to the same source as the Greek,
viz.
, the
Phœnician.

It was the
Roman
alphabet which served as the basis to the
English.

And it is in the changes which the Phœnician alphabet underwent
in being accommodated to the Latin language that we must investigate the
chief peculiarities of the present alphabet and orthography of Great
Britain and America.

Now respecting the Roman alphabet, we must remember that it was

not
taken
directly
from the Phœnician; in this
important point differing from the Greek.

Nor yet was it taken,
in the first instance
, from the
Greek.

It had a
double
origin.

The operation of the principles indicated in §
161
was a work of the time; and hence the older and
more unmodified Greek alphabet approached in character its
Phœnician prototype much more than the later, or modified. As may
be seen, by comparing the previous alphabets with the common alphabets of
the Greek Grammar, the letters 6 and 19 occur in the earlier, whilst they
are missing in the later, modes of writing. On the other hand, the

old
alphabet has no such signs as
φ
,

χ
,
υ
,
ω
,
ψ
, and
ξ
.

Such being the case, it is easy to imagine what would be the
respective conditions of two Italian languages which borrowed those
alphabets, the one from the earlier, the other from the later Greek. The
former would contain the equivalents to
vaw
(6), and
kof

(19); but be destitute of
φ
,
χ
, &c.; whereas the latter would have
φ
,
χ
, &c., but be
without either
vaw
or
kof
.

Much the same would be the case with any single
[120]
Italian language which
took as its basis the
earlier
, but adopted, during the course of
time, modifications from the
later
Greek. It would exhibit within
itself characters common to the two stages.

This, or something very like it, was the case with Roman. For the
first two or three centuries the alphabet was Etruscan; Etruscan derived

directly
from the Greek, and from the
old
Greek.

Afterwards, however, the later Greek alphabet had its influence, and
the additional letters which it contained were more or less incorporated;
and that without effecting the ejection of any earlier ones.

§ 163
. With these preliminaries we may
investigate the details of the Roman alphabet, when we shall find that
many of them stand in remarkable contrast with those of Greece and
Phœnicia. At the same time where they differ with them, they agree
with the English.

§ 164
. The differences of this table are
referable to one of the following four heads:—
a.
Ejection.

b.
Addition.
c.
Change of power.
d.
Change of
order.

a.

Ejection.
—In the first instance, the Italians
ejected as unnecessary, letters 7,
[44]
9, and 11:
zayn

(
zæta
),
teth
(
thæta
), and
kaf
(
kappa
).
Either the sounds which they expressed were wanting in their language; or
else they were expressed by some other letter. The former was probably
the case with 7 and 9,
zæta
and
thæta
, the latter with 11,

kappa
.

b.

Addition.
—Out of the Greek
iôta
, two;
out of the Greek
upsilon
, four modifications have been evolved;
viz.,
i
and
j
out of
ι
, and

u
,
v
,
w
,
y
, out of
υ
.

c.

Change of power.
—Letter 3, in Greek and Hebrew
had the sound of the
g
in
gun
; in Latin that of
k
.
The reason for this lies in the structure of the Etruscan language. In
that tongue the
flat
sounds were remarkably deficient; indeed, it
is probable, that that of
g
was wanting. Its
sharp

equivalent, however, the sound of
k
, was by no means wanting; and
the Greek
gamma
was used to denote it. This made the equivalent to

k
, the third letter of the alphabet, as early as the time of the
Etruscans.

But the
Romans
had both sounds, the
flat
as well as
[122]
the

sharp
,
g
as well as
k
. How did they express them? Up
to the second Punic War they made the rounded form of the Greek
Γ
, out of which the letter C has arisen, do
double work, and signify
k
and
g
equally, just as in the
present English
th
is sounded as the Greek
θ
,
[45]
and as
dh
;
[46]
in proof
whereof we have in the Duillian column,
MACESTRATOS =
MAGISTRATOS
, and
CARTHACINIENSES =
CARTHAGINIENSES
.

Thus much concerning the power and places of the Latin
c
, as
opposed to the Greek
γ
. But this is not
all. The use of
gamma
, with the power of
k
, made

kappa
superfluous, and accounts for its ejection in the

Etruscan
alphabet; a fact already noticed.

Furthermore, an addition to the Etruscan alphabet was required by the
existence of the sound of
g
, in Latin, as soon as the
inconvenience of using
c
with a double power became manifest. What
took place then? Even this. The third letter was modified in form, or
became a new letter,
c
being altered into
g
; and the new
letter took its place in the alphabet.

Where was this? As the
seventh
letter between
f

(
digamma
) and
h
(
hæta
).

Why? Because it was there where there was a vacancy, and where it
replaced the Greek
zæta
, or the Hebrew
zayn
, a letter
which,
at that time
, was not wanted in Latin.

d.

Change of order.
—As far as the letters
c

and
g
are concerned, this has been explained; and it has been
shown that change of order and change of power are sometimes very closely
connected. All that now need be added is, that those letters which were

last
introduced from the Greek into the Roman alphabet, were
placed at the end.

[123]

This is why
u
,
v
,
w
, and
y
come after

t
—the last letter of the original Phœnician, and also
of the
older
Greek.

This, too, is the reason for
z
coming last of all. It was
restored for the purpose of spelling Greek words. But as its original
place had been filled up by
g
, it was tacked on as an appendage,
rather than incorporated as an element.

X
in
power
, coincided with the Greek
xi
; in

place
, with the Greek
khi
. Its
position
seems to
have determined its
form
, which is certainly that of
X

rather than of
Ξ
. The full investigation of
this is too lengthy for the present work.

§ 165
. It should be observed, that, in the
Latin, the letters have no longer any
names
(like
beth
,

bæta
), except such as are derived from their powers (
be
,

ce
).

§ 166
. The principles which determined the form
of the Roman alphabet were, upon the whole, correct; and, hence, the
Roman alphabet, although not originally meant to express an Italian
tongue at all, expressed the language to which it was applied
tolerably.

On the other hand, there were both omissions and alterations which
have had a detrimental effect upon the orthography of those other
numerous tongues to which Latin has supplied the alphabet.
Thus—

a.
It is a matter of regret, that the differences which the
Greeks drew between the so-called
long
and
short

e

and
o
, was neglected by the Latins; in other words, that
ω
was omitted entirely, and
η
changed in power. Had this been the case, all
the orthographical expedients by which we have to express the difference
between the
o
in
not
, and the
o
in
note
,
would have been prevented—
not
,
note
,

moat
—
bed
,
bead
,
heel
,
glede
,
&c.

b.
It is a matter of regret, that such an unnecessary
[124]
compendium
as
q
=
cu
,
or
cw
, should have been retained from the old Greek alphabet; and,
still more so, that the equally superfluous
x
=
cs
, or

ks
, should have been re-admitted.

c. It is a matter of regret, that the Greek
θ
was not treated like the Greek
ζ
. Neither were wanted at first; both afterwards.
The manner, however, of their subsequent introduction was different.

Zæta
came in as a simple single letter, significant of a simple
single sound.
Thæta
, on the contrary, although expressive of an
equally simple sound, became
th
. This was a combination rather
than a letter; and the error which it engendered was great.

It suggested the idea, that a simple sound was a compound
one—which was wrong.

It further suggested the idea, that the sound of
θ
differed from that of
τ
, by the addition of
h
—which was
wrong also.

§ 167
. The Greek language had a system of sounds
different from the Phœnician; and the alphabet required modifying
accordingly.

The Roman language had a system of sounds different from the Greek and
the alphabet required modifying accordingly.

This leads us to certain questions concerning the Anglo-Saxon. Had

it
a system of sounds different from the Roman? If so, what
modifications did the alphabet require? Were such modifications effected?
If so, how? Sufficiently or insufficiently? The answers are
unsatisfactory.

§ 168
. The Anglo-Saxon had, even in its earliest
stage, the following sounds, for which the Latin alphabet had no
equivalent signs or letters—

1. The sound of the
th
in
thin
.
[125]

2. The sound of the
th
in
thine
.

It had certainly these: probably others.

§ 169
. Expressive of these, two new signs were
introduced,
viz.
,
þ
=
th
in
thin
, and

ð
=
th
in
thine
.

W
, also evolved out of
u
, was either an original
improvement of the Anglo-Saxon orthographists, or a mode of expression
borrowed from one of the allied languages of the Continent. Probably the
latter was the case; since we find the following passage in the Latin
dedication of Otfrid's "Krist:"—"Hujus enim linguæ barbaries, ut
est inculca et indisciplinabilis, atque insueta capi regulari freno
grammaticæ artis, sic etiam in multis dictis scriptu est difficilis
propter literarum aut congeriem, aut incognitam sonoritatem. Nam interdum
tria
u u u
ut puto quærit in sono; priores duo consonantes, ut
mihi videtur, tertium vocali sono manente."

This was, as far as it went, correct, so that the Anglo-Saxon
alphabet, although not originally meant to express a Gothic tongue at
all, answered the purpose to which it was applied tolerably.

§ 170
. Change, however, went on; and the
orthography which suited the earlier Anglo-Saxon would not suit the
later; at any rate, it would not suit the language which had become or
was becoming,
English
; wherein the sounds for which the Latin
alphabet had no equivalent signs increase. Thus there is at
present—

1. The sound of the
sh
in
shine
.

2. The sound of the
z
in
azure
.

How are these to be expressed? The rule has hitherto been to denote
simple single sounds, by simple single signs, and where such signs have
no existence already, to
originate new ones
.

To
combine existing letters
, rather than to coin a new one, has
only been done rarely. The Latin substitution
[126]
of the combination

th
for the simple single
θ
, was
exceptionable. It was a precedent, however, which now begins to be
followed generally.

§ 171
. It is this precedent which accounts for
the absence of any letter in English, expressive of either of the sounds
in question.

§ 172
. Furthermore, our alphabet has not only
not increased in proportion to our sound-system, but it has

decreased
. The Anglo-Saxon
þ
= the
th
in

thin
, and
ð
= the
th
in
thine
, have become
obsolete; and a difference in pronunciation, which our ancestors
expressed,
we
overlook.

The same precedent is at the bottom of this; a fact which leads us
to—

§ 173
.
The Anglo-Norman
alphabet.
—The Anglo-Saxon language was
Gothic
; the
alphabet,
Roman
.

The Anglo-Norman language was
Roman
; the alphabet,
Roman

also.

The Anglo-Saxon took his speech from one source; his writing from
another.

The Anglo-Norman took both from the same.

In adapting a Latin alphabet to a Gothic language, the Anglo-Saxon
allowed himself more latitude than the Anglo-Norman. We have seen that
the new signs
þ
and
ð
were Anglo-Saxon.

Now the sounds which these letters represent did not occur in the
Norman-French, consequently the Norman-French alphabet neither had nor
needed to have signs to express them; until after the battle of Hastings,

when it became the Anglo-Norman of England
.

Then
, the case became altered. The English language influenced
the Norman orthography, and the Norman orthography the English language;
and the result was, that the simple single correct and distinctive
[127]
signs
of the Anglo-Saxon alphabet, became replaced by the incorrect and
indistinct combination
th
.

This was a loss, both in the way of theoretical correctness and
perspicuity.

Such is the general view of the additions, ejections, changes of
power, and changes of order in the English alphabet. The extent, however,
to which an alphabet is faulty, is no measure of the extent to which an
orthography is faulty; since an insufficient alphabet may, by consistency
in its application, be more useful than a full and perfect alphabet
unsteadily applied.

§ 174
. One of our orthographical expedients,

viz.
, the reduplication of the consonant following, to express the
shortness (dependence) of the preceding vowel, is as old as the classical
languages:
terra
,
θάλασσα
.
Nevertheless, the following extract from the "Ormulum" (written in the
thirteenth century) is the fullest recognition of the practice that I
have met with.

And whase wilenn shall þis boc,

Efft oþerr siþe writenn,

Himm bidde icc þatt hett write rihht,

[128]

§ 175
.
The order of the
alphabet.
—In the history of our alphabet, we have had the
history of certain changes in the arrangement, as well as of the changes
in the number and power of its letters. The following question now
presents itself:
viz.
, Is there in the order of the letters any

natural
arrangement, or is the original as well as the present
succession of letters arbitrary and accidental? The following facts
suggest an answer in the affirmative.

The order of the Hebrew alphabet is as follows:—

Name.
Sound.

Name.
Sound.

1.
Aleph
Either a vowel or a breathing.

12.
Lamed
L.

2.
Beth
B.

13.
Mem
M.

3.
Gimel
G, as in
gun
.

14.
Nun
N.

4.
Daleth
D.

15.
Samech
a variety of S.

5.
He
Either a vowel or an aspirate.

16.
Ayn
Either a vowel or ——?

6.
Vaw
V.

17.
Pe
P.

7.
Zayn
Z.

18.
Tsadi
TS.

8.
Kheth
a variety of K.

19.
Kof
a variety of K.

9.
Teth
a variety of T.

20.
Resh
R.

10.
Yod
I.

21.
Sin
S.

11.
Caph
K.

22.
Tau
T.

Let
beth
,
vaw
, and
pe
(
b
,
v
,

p
) constitute a series called series P. Let
gimel
,

kheth
, and
kof
(
g
,
kh
,
k'
) constitute
a series called series K. Let
daleth
,
teth
, and
tau
,
(
d
,
t'
,
t
) constitute a series called series T. Let

aleph
,
he
, and
ayn
constitute a series called the
vowel series. Let the first four letters be taken in their order.

1.
Aleph
of the vowel series.

2.
Beth
of series P.

3.
Gimel
of series K.

4.
Daleth
of series T.

[129]

Herein the consonant of series B comes next to the letter of the vowel
series; that of series K follows; and in the last place, comes the letter
of series T. After this the order changes;
daleth
being followed
by
he
of the vowel series.

5.
He
of the vowel series.

6.
Vaw
of series P.

7.
Zayn
——

8.
Kheth
of series K.

9.
Teth
of series T.

In this second sequence the
relative
positions of
v
,

kh
, and
t'
, are the same in respect to each other, and the
same in respect to the vowel series. The sequence itself is broken by the
letter
zayn
but it is remarkable that the principle of the
sequence is the same. Series P follows the vowel and series T is farthest
from it. After this the system becomes but fragmentary. Still, even now,

pe
, of series P, follows
ayn
;
tau
, of series T, is
farthest from it, and
kof
, of series K, is intermediate.

If this be the case, and, if the letters, so to say,
circulate
,
the alterations made in their order during the transfer of their alphabet
from Greece to Rome, have had the unsatisfactory effect of concealing an
interesting arrangement, and of converting a real, though somewhat
complex regularity, into apparent hazard and disorder.

PART IV.

ETYMOLOGY.

CHAPTER I.

ON THE PROVINCE OF ETYMOLOGY.

§ 176
. The word etymology, derived from the
Greek, in the current language of scholars and grammarians, has a double
meaning. At times it is used in a wide, and at times in a restricted
sense.

If in the English language we take such a word as
fathers
, we
are enabled to divide it into two parts; in other words, to reduce it
into two elements. By comparing it with the word
father
, we see
that the
s
is neither part nor parcel of the original word. Hence
the word is capable of being analysed;
father
being the original
primitive word, and
s
the secondary superadded termination. From
the word
father
, the word
fathers
is
derived
, or
(changing the expression) deduced, or descended. What has been said of
the word
fathers
may also be said of
fatherly
,

fatherlike
,
fatherless
, &c. Now, from the word

father
, all these words (
fathers
,
fatherly
,

fatherlike
, and
fatherless
) differ in form and in meaning.
To become such a word as
fathers
, &c., the
[132]
word

father
is
changed
. Of changes of this sort, it is the
province of etymology to take cognizance.

§ 177
. Compared with the form
fathers
,
the word
father
is the older form of the two. The word

father
is a word current in this the nineteenth century. The same
word is found much earlier, under different forms, and in different
languages. Thus, in the Latin language, the form was
pater
; in
Greek,
πατήρ
. Now, with
father
and

fathers
, the change takes place within the same language, whilst
the change that takes place between
pater
and
father
takes
place within different languages. Of changes of this latter kind it is,
also, the province of etymology to take cognizance.

§ 178
. In its widest signification, etymology
takes cognizance
of the changes of the form of words
. However, as
the etymology that compares the forms
fathers
and
father
is
different from the etymology that compares
father
and

pater
, we have, of etymology, two sorts: one dealing with the
changes of form that words undergo in one and the same language
(
father
,
fathers
), the other dealing with the changes that
words undergo in passing from one language to another (
pater
,

father
).

The first of these sorts may be called etymology in the limited sense
of the word, or the etymology of the grammarian. In this case it is
opposed to orthoepy, orthography, syntax, and the other parts of grammar.
This is the etymology of the ensuing pages.

The second may be called etymology in the wide sense of the word,

historical
etymology, or
comparative
etymology.

§ 179
. It must be again repeated that the two
sorts of etymology agree in one point, viz., in taking cognizance of the

changes of forms that words undergo
. Whether the change arise from
grammatical reasons, as
[133]
father
,
fathers
, or from a
change of language taking place in the lapse of time, as
pater
,

father
, is a matter of indifference.

In the Latin
pater
, and in the English
father
, we have
one of two things, either two words descended or derived from each other,
or two words descended or derived from a common original source.

In
fathers
we have a formation deduced from the radical word

father
.

With these preliminaries we may understand Dr. Johnson's explanation
of the word etymology.

"
Etymology
,
n. s.
(
etymologia
,
Lat.)
ἔτυμος
(
etymos
)

true, and

λόγος
(
logos
)
a
word
.

"1.
The descent or derivation of a word from its original; the
deduction of formations from the radical word; the analysis of compounds
into primitives.

"2.
The part of grammar which delivers the inflections of nouns and
verbs."

[134]

CHAPTER II

ON GENDER.

§ 180
. How far is there such a thing as

gender
in the English language? This depends upon the meaning that
we attach to the word.

In the Latin language we have the words
taurus
=
bull
,
and
vacca
=
cow
. Here the natural distinction of
sex

is expressed by
wholly
different words. With this we have
corresponding modes of expression in English:
e.g.
,

Male.
Female.
Male.
Female.

Bachelor
Spinster.
Horse
Mare.

Boar
Sow.
Ram
Ewe.

Boy
Girl.
Son
Daughter.

Brother
Sister.
Uncle
Aunt.

Buck
Doe.
Father
Mother, &c.

The mode, however, of expressing different sexes by
wholly

different words is not a matter of
gender
. The words
boy

and
girl
bear no
etymological
relation to each other;
neither being derived from the other, nor in any way connected with
it.

§ 181
. Neither are words like

cock-sparrow
,
man-servant
,
he-goat
, &c., as
compared with
hen-sparrow
,
maid-servant
,
she-goat
,
&c., specimens of
gender
. Here a difference of sex is
indicated by the addition of a fresh term, from which is formed a
compound word.

§ 182
. In the Latin words
genitrix
=
a
mother
, and
[135]
genitor
=
a father
, we have
a nearer approach to
gender
. Here the difference of sex is
expressed by a difference of termination; the words
genitor
and

genitrix
being in a true etymological relation,
i.e.
,
either derived from each other, or from some common source. With this we
have, in English corresponding modes of expression:
e.g.

Male.
Female.
Male.
Female.

Actor
Actress.
Lion
Lioness.

Arbiter
Arbitress.
Peer
Peeress.

Baron
Baroness.
Poet
Poetess.

Benefactor
Benefactress.
Sorcerer
Sorceress.

Count
Countess.
Songster
Songstress.

Duke
Duchess.
Tiger
Tigress.

§ 183
. This, however, in strict grammatical
language, is an approach to gender rather than
gender
itself; the
difference from true grammatical gender being as follows:—

Let the Latin words
genitor
and
genitrix
be
declined:—

Sing. Nom.
Genitor
Genitrix.

Gen.
Genitor-
is
Genitric-
is
.

Dat.
Genitor-
i
Genitric-
i
.

Acc.
Genitor-
em
Genitric-
em
.

Voc.
Genitor
Genitrix.

Plur. Nom.
Genitor-
es
Genitric-
es
.

Gen.
Genitor-
um
Genitric-
um
.

Dat.
Genitor-
ibus
Genitric-
ibus
.

Acc.
Genitor-
es
Genitric-
es
.

Voc.
Genitor-
es
Genitric-
es
.

The syllables in italics are the signs of the cases and numbers. Now
those signs are the same in each word, the difference of meaning (or sex)
not affecting them.

§ 184
. Contrast, however, with the words

genitor

[136]
and
genitrix
the words

domina
=
a mistress
, and
dominus
=
a
master
.

Sing. Nom.
Domin-
a
Domin-
us
.

Gen.
Domin-
æ
Domin-
i
.

Dat.
Domin-
æ
Domin-
o
.

Acc.
Domin-
am
Domin-
um
.

Voc.
Domin-
a
Domin-
e
.

Plur. Nom.
Domin-
æ
Domin-
i
.

Gen.
Domin-
arum
Domin-

.

Dat.
Domin-
abus
Domin-
is
.

Acc.
Domin-
as
Domin-
os
.

Voc.
Domin-
æ
Domin-
i
.

Here the letters in italics, or the signs of the cases and numbers,
are different; the difference being brought about by the difference of
gender. Now it is very evident that, if
genitrix
be a specimen of
gender,
domina
is something more.

§ 185
. It may be laid down as a sort of
definition, that
there is no gender where there is no affection of the
declension
: consequently, that, although we have, in English, words
corresponding to
genitrix
and
genitor
, we have no true
genders until we find words corresponding to
dominus
and

domina
.

§ 186
. The second element in the notion of
gender, although I will not venture to call it an essential one, is the
following:—In the words
domina
and
dominus
,

mistress
and
master
, there is a
natural
distinction
of sex; the one being masculine, or male, the other feminine, or female.
In the words
sword
and
lance
there is
no natural

distinction of sex. Notwithstanding this, the word
hasta
, in
Latin, is as much of the feminine gender as
domina
, whilst

gladius
=
a sword
is, like
dominus
, a masculine
noun. From this we see that, in languages wherein there are true genders,
a fictitious or
[137]
conventional sex is attributed even to
inanimate objects; in other words,
sex
is a natural distinction,

gender
a grammatical one.

§ 187
. In §
185
it is
written, that "although we have, in English, words corresponding to

genitrix
and
genitor
, we have no true genders until we find

words corresponding to dominus
and
domina
."—The
sentence was intentionally worded with caution. Words like
dominus

and
domina
, that is, words where the declension is affected by the
sex,
are
to be found
even in English
.

The pronoun
him
, from the Anglo-Saxon and English
he
, as
compared with the pronoun
her
, from the Anglo-Saxon
heó
, is
affected in its declension by the difference of sex, and is a true,
though fragmentary, specimen of gender. The same is the case with the
form
his
as compared with
her
.

The pronoun
it
(originally
hit
), as compared with

he
, is a specimen of gender.

The relative
what
, as compared with the masculine
who
,
is a specimen of gender.

The forms
it
(for
hit
) and
he
are as much genders
as
hoc
and
hic
, and the forms
hoc
and
hic
are
as much genders as
bonum
and
bonus
.

§ 188
. The formation of the neuter gender by the
addition of
-t
, in words like
wha-t
,
i-t
, and

tha-t
, occurs in other languages. The
-t
in
tha-t
is
the
-d
in
istu-d
, Latin, and the
-t
in
ta-t
,
Sanskrit.

§ 189
. In the Mœso-Gothic and
Scandinavian, the
adjectives
form the neuters in
-t
, in Old
High German in
-z
(
ts
), and in Modem German in
-s

(derived from
-z
)—Mœso-Gothic,
blind-ata
;
Icel.,
blind-t
; Old High German,
plint-ez
, M. G.

blind-es
=
cæc-um
.

Caution.
—
Which
, is
not
the neuter of

who
.
[138]

§ 190
. Just as there are in English fragments of
a gender modifying the declension, so are there, also, fragments of the
second element of gender;
viz.
, the attribution of sex to objects
naturally destitute of it.
The sun in
his
glory
,
the
moon in
her
wane
, are examples of this. A sailor calls his
ship
she
. A husbandman, according to Mr. Cobbett, does the same
with his
plough
and working implements:—"In speaking of a

ship
we say
she
and
her
. And you know that our
country-folks in Hampshire call almost every thing
he
or

she
. It is curious to observe that country labourers give the
feminine appellation to those things only which are more closely
identified with themselves, and by the qualities or conditions of which
their own efforts, and their character as workmen, are affected. The
mower calls his
scythe
a
she
, the ploughman calls his

plough
a
she
; but a prong, or a shovel, or a harrow, which
passes promiscuously from hand to hand, and which is appropriated to no
particular labourer, is called a
he
."—"English Grammar,"
Letter v.

§ 191
. Now, although Mr. Cobbett's statements
may account for a sailor calling his ship
she
, they will not
account for the custom of giving to the sun a masculine, and to the moon
a feminine, pronoun, as is done in the expressions quoted in the last
section; still less will it account for the circumstance of the Germans
reversing the gender, and making the
sun
feminine, and the

moon
masculine.

§ 192
. Let there be a period in the history of a
language wherein the
sun
and
moon
are dealt with, not as
inanimate masses of matter, but as animated divinities. Let there, in
other words, be a time when dead things are personified, and when there
is a
mythology
. Let an object like the
sun
be deemed a

male
, and an object like
[139]
the
moon
, a
female
, deity.
We may then understand the origin of certain genders.

The Germans say the
sun in
her
glory
; the
moon in

his
wane
. This difference between the usage of the two
languages, like so many others, is explained by the influence of the
classical languages upon the English.—"
Mundilfori had two
children; a son, Mâni (Moon), and a daughter, Sôl (Sun).
"—Such
is an extract out of an Icelandic mythological work,
viz.
, the
prose Edda. In the classical languages, however,
Phœbus
and

Sol
are masculine, and
Luna
and
Diana
feminine.
Hence it is that, although in Anglo-Saxon and Old-Saxon the
sun
is

feminine
, it is in English
masculine
.

Philosophy
,
charity
, &c., or the names of abstract
qualities personified, take a conventional sex, and are feminine from
their being feminine in Latin.

As in all these words there is no change of form, the consideration of
them is a point of rhetoric, rather than of etymology.

§ 193
. The remainder of this chapter is devoted
to miscellaneous remarks upon the true and apparent genders of the
English language.

1. With the false genders like
baron
,
baroness
, it is a
general rule that the feminine form is derived from the masculine, and
not the masculine from the feminine; as
peer
,
peeress
. The
words
widower
,
gander
, and
drake
are exceptions. For
the word
wizard
, from
witch
, see the section on
augmentative forms.

2. The termination
-ess
, in which so large a portion of our
feminine substantives terminate, is not of Saxon but of classical origin,
being derived from the termination
-ix
,
genitrix
.

3. The words
shepherdess
,
huntress
, and
hostess

are faulty; the radical part of the word being Germanic, and
[140]
the
secondary part classical: indeed, in strict English Grammar, the
termination
-ess
has no place at all. It is a classic, not a
Gothic, element.

4. The termination
-inn
, is current in German, as the
equivalent to
-ess
, and as a feminine affix (
freund
=
a
friend
;
freundinn
=
a female friend
). In English it
occurs only in a fragmentary form;—
e.g.
, in
vixen
, a
true feminine derivative from
fox
=
füchsinn
, German.

Bruin
=
the bear
, may be either a female form, as in Old
High German
përo
=
a he-bear
,
pirinn
=
a
she-bear
; or it may be the Norse form
björn
=
a bear
,
male or female.

Caution.
—Words like
margravine
and

landgravine
prove nothing, being scarcely naturalised.

5. The termination
-str
, as in
webster
,
songster
,
and
baxter
, was originally a feminine affix. Thus, in
Anglo-Saxon,

Sangere,
a male singer
were opposed to

Sangëstre,
a female singer
.

Bäcere,
a male baker
Bacestre,
a female baker
.

Fiðelere,
a male fiddler
Fiðelstre,
a female fiddler
.

Vebbere,
a male weaver
Vëbbëstre,
a female weaver
.

Rædere,
a male reader
Rædestre,
a female reader
.

Seamere,
a male seamer
Seamestre,
a female seamer
.

The same is the case in the present Dutch of Holland:
e.g.
,

spookster
=
a female fortune-teller
;
baxster
=
a
baking-woman
;
waschster
=
a washerwoman
. The word

spinster
still retains its original feminine force.

6. The words
songstress
and
seamstress
, besides being,
as far as concerns the intermixture of languages, in the predicament of

shepherdess
, have, moreover, a double feminine termination; 1st.

-str
, of Germanic, 2nd.
-ess
, of classical, origin.

7. In the word
heroine
we have a Greek termination, just as

-ix
is a Latin, and
-inn
a German one. It must
[141]
not,
however, be considered as derived from
hero
, by any process of the
English language, but be dealt with as a separate importation from the
Greek language.

8. The form
deaconness
is not wholly unexceptionable; since the
termination
-ess
is of Latin, the root
deacon
of Greek
origin: this Greek origin being rendered all the more conspicuous by the
spelling,
deacon
(from
diaconos
), as compared with the
Latin
decanus
.

9.
Goose, gander
.—One peculiarity in this pair of words
has already been indicated. In the older forms of the word
goose
,
such as
χὴν
, Greek;

anser
, Latin;
gans
, German, as well as in the derived form

gander
, we have the proofs that, originally, there belonged to the
word the sound of the letter
n
. In the forms
ὀδοὺς
,
ὀδόντος
, Greek;

dens
,
dentis
, Latin;
zahn
, German;
tooth
,
English, we find the analogy that accounts for the ejection of the

n
, and the lengthening of the vowel preceding. With respect,
however, to the
d
in
gander
, it is not easy to say whether
it is inserted in one word or omitted in the other. Neither can we give
the precise power of the
-er
. The following forms occur in the
different Gothic dialects.
Gans
, fem.;
ganazzo
, masc., Old
High German—
gôs
, f.;
gandra
, m.,
Anglo-Saxon—
gâs
, Icelandic, f.;
gaas
, Danish, f.;

gassi
, Icelandic, m.;
gasse
, Danish,
m.—
ganser
,
ganserer
,
gansart
,

gänserich
,
gander
, masculine forms in different New German
dialects.

10. Observe, the form
gänserich
, has a masculine termination.
The word
täuberich
, in provincial New German, has the same form
and the same power. It denotes a
male dove
;
taube
, in
German, signifying a
dove
. In
gänserich
and

täuberich
, we find preserved the termination
-rich
(or

rik
), with a masculine power. Of this termination we have a
remnant, in English, preserved in the curious word
drake
. To

duck
the word
drake
has no
[142]
etymological relation
whatsoever. It is derived from a word with which it has but one letter in
common;
viz.
, the Latin
anas
=
a duck
. Of this the
root is
anat-
, as seen in the genitive case
anatis
. In Old
High German we find the form
anetrekho
=
a drake
; in
provincial New High German there is
enterich
and
äntrecht
,
from whence come the English and Low German form,
drake
.

11.
Peacock
,
peahen
.—In these compounds, it is not
the word
pea
that is rendered masculine or feminine by the
addition of
cock
and
hen
, but it is the words
cock

and
hen
that are modified by prefixing
pea
.

[143]

CHAPTER III.

THE NUMBERS.

§ 194
. In the Greek language the word

patær
signifies a
father
, denoting
one
, whilst

patere
signifies
two fathers
, denoting a pair, and thirdly,

pateres
signifies
fathers
, speaking of any number beyond
two. The three words,
patær
,
patere
, and
pateres
,
are said to be in different numbers, the difference of meaning being
expressed by a difference of form. These numbers have names. The number
that speaks of
one
is the
singular
, the number that speaks
of
two
is the
dual
(from the Latin word
duo
=

two
), and the number that speaks of
more than two
is the

plural
.

All languages have numbers, but all languages have not them to the
same extent. The Hebrew has a dual, but it is restricted to nouns only.
It has, moreover, this peculiarity; it applies, for the most part, only
to things which are naturally double, as
the two eyes
,
the two
hands
, &c. The Latin has no dual number, except the

natural
one in the words
ambo
and
duo
.

§ 195
. The question presents itself,—to
what extent have we numbers in English? Like the Greek, Hebrew, and
Latin, we have a singular and a plural. Like the Latin, and unlike the
Greek and Hebrew, we have no dual.

§ 196
. Different from the question,
to what
degree have we numbers?
is the question,—
over what extent of

[144]
our language have we numbers?
This
distinction has already been foreshadowed or indicated. The Greeks, who
said
typtô
=
I beat
,
typteton
=
ye two beat
,

typtomen
=
we beat
, had a dual number for their verbs as
well as their nouns; while the Hebrew dual was limited to the nouns only.
In the Greek, then, the dual number is spread over a greater extent of
the language than in the Hebrew.

There is no dual in the
present
English. It has been seen,
however, that in the Anglo-Saxon there
was
a dual. But the
Anglo-Saxon dual, being restricted to the personal pronouns (
wit
=

we two
;
git
=
ye two
), was not co-extensive with the
Greek dual.

There is no dual in the present German. In the ancient German there

was
one.

In the present Danish and Swedish there is no dual. In the Old Norse
and in the present Icelandic a dual number is to be found.

From this we learn that the dual number is one of those inflections
that languages drop as they become modern.

§ 197
. The numbers, then, in the present English
are two, the singular and the plural. Over what extent of language have
we a plural? The Latins say
bonus pater
=
a good father
;

boni patres
=
good fathers
. In the Latin, the adjective

bonus
changes its form with the change of number of the
substantive that it accompanies. In English it is only the substantive
that is changed. Hence we see that in the Latin language the numbers were
extended to adjectives, whereas in English they are confined to the
substantives and pronouns. Compared with the Anglo-Saxon, the present
English is in the same relation as it is with the Latin. In the
Anglo-Saxon there were plural forms for the adjectives.
[145]

§ 198
. Respecting the formation of the plural,
the current rule is, that it is formed from the singular by adding

s
, as
father
,
fathers
. This, however, is by no means
a true expression. The letter
s
added to the word
father
,
making it
fathers
, is
s
to the
eye
only. To the

ear
it is
z
. The word sounds
fatherz
. If the

s
retained its sound the spelling would be
fatherce
. In

stags
,
lads
, &c., the sound is
stagz
,

ladz
. The rule, then, for the formation of the English plurals,
rigorously, though somewhat lengthily expressed, is as
follows.—
The plural is formed from the singular, by adding to
words ending in a vowel, a liquid or flat mute, the flat lene sibilant
(z); and to words ending in a sharp mute, the sharp lene sibilant
(s):

e.g.
(the sound of the word being expressed),
pea
,

peaz
;
tree
,
treez
;
day
,
dayz
;

hill
,
hillz
;
hen
,
henz
;
gig
,

gigz
;
trap
,
traps
;
pit
,
pits
;

stack
,
stacks
.

§ 199
. Upon the formation of the English plural
some further remarks are necessary.

a.
In the case of words ending in
b
,
v
,
d
,
the
th
in
thine
=
ð
, or
g
, a change either of
the final flat consonant, or of the sharp
s
affixed, was
not a
matter of choice but of necessity
; the combinations
abs
,

avs
,
ads
,
aðs
,
ags
, being
unpronounceable.

b.
Whether the first of the two mutes should be accommodated to
the second (
aps
,
afs
,
ats
,
aþs
,
aks
),
or the second to the first (
abz
,
avz
,
adz
,

aðz
,
agz
), is determined by
the habit of the particular
language
in question; and, with a few
apparent
exceptions it
is the rule of the English language to accommodate the second sound to
the first, and not
vice versâ
.

c.
Such combinations as
peas
,
trees
,

hills
,
hens
, &c., (the
s
preserving its original
power, and being sounded as
if
written
peace
,
treece
,
hillce
,

hence
), being pronounceable, the change from
s
to
z
,
in words so ending, is
not
a
[146]
matter determined by
the necessity of the case, but by the habit of the English language.

d.
Although the vast majority of our plurals ends, not in

s
, but in
z
, the original addition was not
z
, but

s
. This we infer from three facts: 1. From the spelling; 2. from
the fact of the sound of
z
being either rare or non-existent in
Anglo-Saxon; 3. from the sufficiency of the causes to bring about the
change.

It may now be seen that some slight variations in the form of our
plurals are either mere points of orthography, or else capable of being
explained on very simple euphonic principles.

§ 200
.
Boxes, churches, judges, lashes,
kisses, blazes, princes
.—Here there is the addition, not of the
mere letter
s
, but of the syllable
-es
. As
s
cannot
be immediately added to
s
, the intervention of a vowel becomes
necessary; and that all the words whose plural is formed in
-es

really end either in the sounds of
s
, or in the allied sounds of

z
,
sh
, or
zh
, may be seen by analysis; since

x
=
ks
,
ch
=
tsh
, and
j
or
ge
=

dzh
, whilst
ce
, in
prince
, is a mere point of
orthography for
s
.

Monarchs
,
heresiarchs
.—Here the
ch
equals
not
tsh
, but
k
, so that there is no need of being told that
they do not follow the analogy of
church
, &c.

Cargoes
,
echoes
.—From
cargo
and

echo
, with the addition of
e
; an orthographical expedient
for the sake of denoting the length of the vowel
o
.

Beauty, beauties
;
key, keys
.—Like the word

cargoes
, &c., these forms are points, not of etymology, but of
orthography.

Pence
.—The peculiarity of this word consists in having a

flat
liquid followed by the sharp sibilant
s
(spelt

ce
), contrary to the rule given above. In the first place, it is a
contracted form from
pennies
; in the second place, its
[147]
sense is
collective rather than plural; in the third place, the use of the sharp
sibilant lene distinguishes it from
pens
, sounded
penz
.
That its sense is
collective
rather than
plural
, we learn
from the word
sixpence
, which, compared with
sixpences
, is
no plural, but a singular form.

Dice
.—In respect to its form, peculiar for the reason
that
pence
is peculiar.—We find the sound of
s
after
a vowel, where that of
z
is expected. This distinguishes

dice
for play, from
dies
(
diz
) for coining.

Dice
, perhaps, like
pence
, is collective rather than
plural.

In
geese
,
lice
, and
mice
, we have, apparently,
the same phenomenon as in
dice
,
viz.
, a sharp sibilant
(
s
) where a
flat
one (
z
) is expected. The
s
,
however, in these words is not the sign of the plural, but the last
letter of the original word.

Alms
.—This is no true plural form. The
s
belongs
to the original word, Anglo-Saxon,
ælmesse
; Greek,
ἐλεημοσύνη
;
just as the
s
in
goose
does. How far the word, although a
true singular in its form, may have a collective signification, and
require its verb to be plural, is a point not of etymology, but of
syntax. The same is the case with the word
riches
, from the French

richesse
. In
riches
the last syllable being sounded as

ez
, increases its liability to pass for a plural.

News
,
means
,
pains
.—These, the reverse of

alms
and
riches
, are true plural forms. How far, in sense,
they are singular is a point not of etymology, but of syntax.

Mathematics
,
metaphysics
,
politics
,

ethics
,
optics
,
physics
.—The following is an
exhibition of my hypothesis respecting these words, to which I invite the
reader's criticism. All the words in point are of Greek origin, and all
are derived from a Greek adjective. Each is the name of some department
of study, of some art, or
[148]
of some science. As the words are Greek,
so also are the sciences which they denote, either of Greek origin, or
else such as flourished in Greece. Let the arts and sciences of Greece be
expressed in Greek, rather by a substantive and an adjective combined,
than by a simple substantive; for instance, let it be the habit of the
language to say
the musical art
, rather than
music
. Let the
Greek for
art
be a word in the feminine gender;
e.g.
,
τέχνη

(
tekhnæ
), so that the
musical art
be
ἡ μουσίκη
τέχνη
(
hæ mousikæ tekhnæ
). Let, in
the progress of language (as was actually the case in Greece), the
article and substantive be omitted, so that, for the
musical art
,
or for
music
, there stand only the feminine adjective,
μουσίκη
. Let there be,
upon a given art or science, a series of books, or treatises; the Greek
for
book
, or
treatise
, being a neuter substantive,
βίβλιον
(
biblion
).
Let the substantive meaning
treatise
be, in the course of
language, omitted, so that whilst the science of physics is called
φυσίκη
(
fysikæ
),
physic, from
ἡ
φυσίκη
τέχνη
, a series of treatises (or even
chapters) upon the science shall be called
φύσικα
(
fysika
) or
physics. Now all this was what happened in Greece. The science was
denoted by a feminine adjective singular, as
φυσίκη
(
fysicæ
), and
the treatises upon it, by the neuter adjective plural, as
φύσικα
(
fysika
). The
treatises of Aristotle are generally so named. To apply this, I conceive,
that in the middle ages a science of Greek origin might have its name
drawn from two sources,
viz.
, from the name of the art or science,
or from the name of the books wherein it was treated. In the first case
it had a singular form, as
physic
,
logic
; in the second
place a plural form, as
mathematics
,
metaphysics
,

optics
.

In what number these words, having a collective sense, require their
verbs to be, is a point of syntax.
[149]

§ 201
. The plural form
children

(
child-er-en
) requires particular notice.

In the first place it is a double plural; the
-en
being the

-en
in
oxen
, whilst the simpler form
child-er
occurs
in the old English, and in certain provincial dialects.

Now, what is the
-er
in
child-er
?

In Icelandic, no plural termination is commoner than that in

-r
; as
geisl-ar
=
flashes
,
tung-ur
=

tongues
, &c. Nevertheless, it is not the Icelandic that
explains the plural form in question.

Besides the word
childer
, we collect from the Old High German
the following forms in
-r
:—

Hus-ir,
Houses
,

Chalp-ir,
Calves
,

Lemp-ir,
Lambs
,

Plet-ir,
Blades of grass
,

Eig-ir,
Eggs
,

and others, the peculiarity of which is the fact of their all being

of the neuter gender
.

Now, the theory respecting this form which is propounded by Grimm is
as follows:—

1. The
-r
represents an earlier
-s
.

2. Which was, originally, no sign of a plural number, but merely a
neuter derivative affix, common to the singular as well as to the plural
number.

3. In this form it appears in the Mœso-Gothic:
ag-is
=

fear
(whence
ague
=
shivering
),
hat-is
=

hate
,
riqv-is
=
smoke
(
reek
). In none of
these words is the
-s
radical, and in none is it limited to the
singular number.

To these doctrines, it should be added, that the reason why a singular
derivational affix should become the sign of the plural number, lies,
most probably, in the
collective
nature of the words in which it
occurs:
Husir
=
a collection of houses
,
eiger
=
a
collection of eggs
,
eggery

[150]
or
eyry
. In
words like
yeoman-r-y
and
Jew-r-y
, the
-r
has,
probably, the same origin, and is
collective
.

In Wicliffe we find the form
lamb-r-en
, which is to
lamb

as
children
is to
child
.

§ 202
.
The form in -en.
—In the
Anglo-Saxon no termination of the plural number is more common than

-n
:
tungan
, tongues;
steorran
, stars. Of this
termination we have evident remains in the words
oxen
,

hosen
,
shoon
,
eyne
, words more or less antiquated.
This, perhaps, is
no
true plural. In
welk-in
=
the
clouds
, the original singular form is lost.

§ 203
.
Men
,
feet
,
teeth
,

mice
,
lice
,
geese
.—In these we have some of
the oldest words in the language. If these were, to a certainty, true
plurals, we should have an appearance somewhat corresponding to the
so-called
weak
and
strong
tenses of verbs;
viz.
, one
series of plurals formed by a change of the vowel, and another by the
addition of the sibilant. The word
kye
, used in Scotland for

cows
, is of the same class. The list in Anglo-Saxon of words of
this kind is different from that of the present English.

Mr. Guest quotes the forms
brethre
and
brothre
from the Old
English. The sense is collective rather than plural.

Peasen
=
pulse
.—As
children
is a double
form of one
[151]
sort (
r
+
en
), so is

peasen
a double form of another (
s
+
en
);

pea
,
pea-s
,
pea-s-en
. Wallis speaks to the

singular
power of the form in
-s
;—"Dicunt nonnulli

a pease
, pluraliter
peasen
; at melius, singulariter
a
pea
, pluraliter
pease
."—P. 77. He might have added,
that, theoretically,
pease
was the proper singular form; as shown
by the Latin
pis-um
.

Pullen
= poultry.

Lussurioso.
—What? three-and-twenty years in law!

Vendice.
—I have known those who have been five-and-fifty,
and all about
pullen
and pigs.—"Revenger's Tragedy," iv.
1.

If this were a plural form, it would be a very anomalous one. The

-en
, however, is no more a sign of the plural than is the

-es
in
rich-es
(
richesse
.) The proper form is in

-ain
or
-eyn
.

A false theefe,

That came like a false fox, my
pullain
to kill and mischeefe.

"Gammer Gurton's Needle," v. 2.

Chickens
.—A third variety of the double inflection
(
en
+
s
), with the additional peculiarity of the form

chicken
being used, at present, almost exclusively in the singular
number, although, originally, it was, probably, the plural of

chick
. So Wallis considered it:—"At olim etiam per

-en
vel
-yn
formabant pluralia; quorum pauca admodum adhuc
retinemus. Ut,
an ox
,
a chick
, pluralitur
oxen
,

chicken
(sunt qui dicunt in singulari
chicken
, et in
plurali
chickens
)."
Chick
,
chick-en
,

chick-en-s
.

Fern
.—According to Wallis the
-n
in
fer-n

is the
-en
in
oxen
, in other words a plural
termination:—"A
fere
(
filix
) pluraliter
fern

(verum nunc plerumque
fern
utroque numero dicitur, sed et in
plurali
ferns
); nam
fere
et
feres
prope obsoleta
sunt." Subject to this view, the word
fer-n-s
would exhibit the
same phenomenon as the word
[152]
chicken-s
. It is doubtful, however,
whether Wallis's view be correct. A reason for believing the
-n
to
be radical is presented by the Anglo-Saxon form
fearn
, and the Old
High German,
varam
.

Women
.—Pronounced
wimmen
, as opposed to the
singular form
w
oo
mman
. Probably an instance of
accommodation.

Houses
.—Pronounced
houz-ez
. The same peculiarity
in the case of
s
and
z
, as occurs between
f
and

v
in words like
life
,
lives
, &c.

Paths
,
youths
.—Pronounced
padhz
,

yoodhz
. The same peculiarity in the case of
þ
and
ð
,
as occurs between
s
and
z
in the words
house
,

houses
. "Finita in

, taken along with the extract from Wallis,
lead us to an important class of words.—§
199

b
.

§ 206
. Certain words ending in
f
, like

loaf
,
wife
, &c.

The regular plural of these would be
loafs
,
wifes
,
pronounced
loafce
,
wifce
, &c.

But this is not the case. The sound added to the final
f
is the
sound of
z
, not that of
s
.

And the plurals are sounded
loavz
,
wivz
(
wivez
,

weivz
).

Furthermore, the sound of the final
f
is changed to that of

v
; in other words, the
first
of the two letters is
accommodated to the second, in violation to the rule of §
199

b
.

Can this be explained? Perhaps it can. In the Swedish language the
letter
f
has the sound of
v
; so that
staf
is sounded

stav
.

Again, in the allied languages the words in question
[153]
end in the

flat
(not the
sharp
) mute,—
weib
,
laub
,

calb
,
halb
,
stab
, &c. =
wife
,

leaf
,
calf
,
half
,
staff
.

This makes it probable that, originally, the
f
in
wife
,

loaf
, &c. was sounded as
v
; so that the singular forms
were
wive
,
loav
.

If so, the
plural is
perfectly normal; it being the

singular
form on which the irregularity lies.

[154]

CHAPTER IV.

ON THE CASES.

§ 207
. The extent to which there are, in the
English language, cases, depends on the meaning which we attach to the
word case. In the term
a house of a father
, the idea expressed by
the words
of a father
, is an idea of relation between them and the
word
house
. This idea is an idea of property or possession. The
relation between the words
father
and
house
may be called
the
possessive
relation. This relation, or connexion, between the
two words, is expressed by the preposition
of
.

In the term
a father's house
, the idea is, there or
thereabouts, the same; the relation or connexion between the two words
being the same. The expression, however, differs. In
a father's
house
the relation, or connexion, is expressed, not by a preposition,
but by a change of form,
father
becoming
father's
.

He gave the house to a father
.—Here the words

father
and
house
stand in another sort of relationship, the
relationship being expressed by the preposition
to
. The idea
to
a father
differs from the idea
of a father
, in being expressed
in one way only;
viz.
, by the preposition. There is no second mode
of expressing it by a change of form, as was done with

father's
.

The father taught the child
.—Here there is neither
preposition nor change of form. The connexion between
[155]
the words

father
and
child
is expressed by the arrangement only.

§ 208
. Now if the relation alone between two
words constitute a case, the words
a child
,
to a father
,

of a father
, and
father's
, are all equally cases; of which
one may be called the accusative, another the dative, a third the
genitive, and so on.

Perhaps, however, the relationship alone does not constitute a case.
Perhaps there is a necessity of either the addition of a preposition (as
in
of a father
), or of a change in form (as in
father's
).
In this case (although
child
be not so)
father's
,
of a
father
, and
to a father
, are all equally cases.

Now it has long been remarked, that if the use of a preposition
constitute a case, there must be as many cases in a language as there are
prepositions, and that "
above a man
,
beneath a man
,

beyond a man
,
round about a man
,
within a man
,

without a man
, shall be cases as well as
of a man
,
to a
man
, and
with a man
."

§ 209
. For etymological purposes, therefore, it
is necessary to limit the meaning of the word case; and, as a sort of
definition, it may be laid down that
where there is no change of form
there is no case
. With this remark, the English language may be
compared with the Latin.

Latin.
English.

Sing. Nom.
Pater
a father.

Gen.
Patris
a father's.

Dat.
Patri
to a father.

Acc.
Patrem
a father.

Abl.
Patre
from a father.

Here, since in the Latin language there are five changes of form,
whilst in English there are but
two
, there are (as far, at least,
as the word
pater
and
father

[156]
are concerned) three
more cases in Latin than in English.

It does not, however, follow that because in the particular word

father
we have but two cases, there may not be other words wherein
there are more than two.

§ 210
. Neither does it follow, that because two
words may have the
same form
they are necessarily in the
same
case
; a remark which leads to the distinction between
a real and
an accidental identity of form
.

In the language of the Anglo-Saxons the genitive cases of the words

smið
,
ende
, and
dæg
, were respectively,

smiðes
,
endes
, and
dæges
; whilst the nominative
plurals were,
smiðas
,
endas
, and
dægas
.

But when a change took place, by which the vowel of the last syllable
in each word was ejected, the result was, that the forms of the genitive
singular and the nominative plural, originally different, became one and
the same; so that the identity of the two cases is an accident.

This fact relieves the English grammarian from a difficulty. The
nominative plural and the genitive singular are, in the present language
of England, identical; the apostrophe in
father's
being a mere
matter of orthography. However, there was
once
a difference. This
modifies the previous statement, which may now stand thus:—
for a
change of case there must be a change of form existing or
presumed
.

§ 211
.
The number of our cases and the extent
of language over which they spread.
—In the English language
there is undoubtedly a
nominative
case. This occurs in
substantives, adjectives, and pronouns (
father
,
good
,

he
) equally. It is found in both numbers.

§ 212
.
Accusative.
—Some call this
the
objective
case. The words
him
and
them
(whatever
they may have been
[157]
originally) are now (to a certain extent)
true accusatives. The accusative case is found in pronouns only.
Thee,
me, us
, and
you
are, to a certain extent, true accusatives.
These are accusative thus far: 1. They are not derived from any other
case. 2. They are distinguished from the forms
I
,
my
,
&c. 3. Their meaning is accusative. Nevertheless, they are only
imperfect accusatives. They have no sign of case, and are distinguished
by negative characters only.

One word in the present English is probably a true accusative in the
strict sense of the term,
viz.
, the word
twain
=

two
. The
-n
in
twai-n
is the
-n
in

hine
=
him
and
hwone
=
whom
. This we see from
the following inflection:—

Neut.
Masc.
Fem.

N. and Acc.
Twá,
Twégen,
Twá.

Abl. and Dat.
Twám,
Twǽm.

Gen.
Twegra,
Twega.

Although nominative as well as accusative, I have little doubt as to
the original character of
twégen
being accusative. The
-n

is by no means radical; besides which, it
is
the sign of an
accusative case, and is
not
the sign of a nominative.

§ 213
.
Dative.
—In the antiquated
word
whilom
(
at times
), we have a remnant of the old dative
in
-m
. The
sense
of the word is abverbial; its form,
however, is that of a dative case.

§ 214
.
Genitive.
—Some call this the
possessive case. It is found in substantives and pronouns (
father's,
his
), but not in adjectives. It is formed like the nominative plural,
by the addition of the lene sibilant (
father, fathers; buck,
bucks
); or if the word end in
-s
, by that of
-es

(
boxes
,
judges
, &c.) It is found in both numbers:
[158]
the men's hearts
;
the children's
bread
. In the plural number, however, it is rare; so rare, indeed,
that wherever the plural ends in
s
(as it almost always does),
there is no genitive. If it were not so, we should have such words as

fatherses
,
foxeses
,
princeses
, &c.

§ 215
.
Instrumental.
—The following
extracts from Rask's "Anglo-Saxon Grammar," teach us that there exist in
the present English two powers of the word spelt
t-h-e
, or of the
so-called definite article—"The demonstrative pronouns are
þæt,
se, seó
(
id, is, ea
), which are also used for the article; and

þis, þes, þeós
(
hoc, hic, hæc
). They are thus
declined:—

Neut.
Masc.
Fem.
Neut.
Masc.
Fem.

Sing N.
þæt
se
seó
þis
þes
þeós.

A.
þæt
þone
þá
þis
þisne
þás.

Abl.
þý
þǽre
þise
þisse.

D.
þám
þǽre
þisum
þisse.

G.
þæs
þǽre
þises
þisse.

Plur. N. and A.

þá

þás.

Abl. and D.
þám
þisum.

G.
þára.
þissa.

"The indeclinable
þe
is often used instead of
þæt, se,
seó
, in all cases, but especially with a relative signification, and,
in later times, as an article. Hence the English article
the
.

"
þý
seems justly to be received as a proper
ablativus
instrumenti
, as it occurs often in this character, even in the
masculine gender; as,
mid þý áþe
=
with that oath
("Inæ
Leges," 53). And in the same place in the dative,
on þǽm áþe

=
in that oath
."—Pp. 56, 57.

Hence the
the
that has originated out of the Anglo-Saxon

þý
is one word; whilst the
the
that has originated
[159]
out
of the Anglo-Saxon
þe
, another. The latter is the common article:
the former the
the
in expressions like
all the more
,
all
the better
=
more by all that
,
better by all that
, and
the Latin phrases
eo majus
,
eo melius
.

That
why
is in the same case with the instrumental
the
(
=
þý
) may be seen from the following Anglo-Saxon inflexion of the
interrogative pronoun:—

Neut.
Masc.

N.
Hwæt
Hwá

A.
Hwæt
Hwone (hwæne).

Abl.

Hwi

D.
Hwám (hwǽm)

G.
Hwæs.

Hence, then, in
the
and
why
we have instrumental
ablatives, or, simply,
instrumentals
.

§ 216
.
The determination of
cases.
—How do we determine cases? In other words, why do we
call
him
and
them
accusatives rather than datives or
genitives? By one of two means;
viz.
, either by the
sense

or the
form
.

Suppose that in the English language there were ten thousand dative
cases and as many accusatives. Suppose, also, that all the dative cases
ended in
-m
, and all the accusatives in some other letter. It is
very evident that, whatever might be the meaning of the words
him

and
them
their form would be dative. In this case the meaning
being accusatives, and the form dative, we should doubt which test to
take.

My own opinion is, that it would be convenient to determine cases by
the
form
of the word
alone
; so that, even if a word had a
dative sense only once, where it had an accusative sense ten thousand
times, such a word should be said to be in the dative case. Now the words

[160]
him
and
them
(to which we
may add
whom
) were once dative cases;
[48]

-m
in Anglo-Saxon being the
sign of the dative case. In the time of the Anglo-Saxons their sense
coincided with their form. At present they are dative forms with an
accusative meaning. Still, as the word
give
takes after it a
dative case, we have, even now, in the sentence,
give it him
,

give it them
, remnants of the old dative sense. To say
give it
to him
,
to them
, is unnecessary and pedantic: neither do I
object to the expression,
whom shall I give it?
If ever the

formal
test become generally recognised and consistently adhered
to,
him
,
them
, and
whom
will be called datives with
a latitude of meaning; and then the only true and unequivocal accusatives
in the English language will be the forms
you
,
thee
,

us
,
me
, and
twain
.

§ 217
.
Analysis of cases.
—In the
word
children's
we are enabled to separate the word into three
parts. 1. The root
child
. 2. The plural signs
r
and

en
. 3. The sign of the genitive case,
s
. In this case the
word is said to be analysed, since we not only take it to pieces, but
also give the respective powers of each of its elements; stating which
denotes the case, and which the number. Although it is too much to say
that the analysis of every case of every number can be thus effected, it
ought always to be attempted.

§ 218
.
The true nature of the genitive form
in 's.
—It is a common notion that the genitive form

father's
is contracted from
father his
. The expression in
our liturgy,
for Jesus Christ his sake
, which is merely a
pleonastic one, is the only foundation for this assertion. As the idea,
however, is not only one of the commonest, but also one of the greatest
errors in etymology, the following
[161]
three statements are
given for the sake of contradiction to it.

1. The expression the
Queen's Majesty
is not capable of being
reduced to the
Queen his Majesty
.

2. In the form
his
itself, the
s
has precisely the power
that it has in
father's
, &c. Now
his
cannot be said to
arise out of
he
+
his
.

3. In the Slavonic, Lithuanic, and classical tongues, the genitive
ends in
s
, just as it does in English; so that even if the words

father his
would account for the English word
father's
, it
would not account for the Sanskrit genitive
pad-as
, of a foot; the
Zend
dughdhar-s
, of a daughter; the Lithuanic
dugter-s
; the
Greek
ὀδόντ-ος
; the Latin

dent-is
, &c.

[162]

CHAPTER V.

THE PERSONAL PRONOUNS.

§ 219
.
I
,
we
,
us
,

me
,
thou
,
ye
.—These constitute the true
personal pronouns. From
he
,
she
, and
it
, they differ
in being destitute of gender.

These latter words are demonstrative rather than personal, so that
there are in English true personal pronouns for the first two persons
only.

§ 220
. The usual declension of the personal
pronouns is exceptionable.
I
and
me
,
thou
and

ye
, stand in no etymological relations to each other. The true
view of the words is, that they are not irregular but defective.
I

has no
oblique
, and
me
no nominative case. And so it is
with the rest.

§ 221
.
You
.—As far as the practice
of the present mode of speech is concerned, the word
you
is a

nominative
form; since we say
you move
,
you are
moving
,
you were speaking
.

Why should it not be treated as such? There is no absolute reason why
it should not. The Anglo-Saxon form for
you
was
eow
, for

ye
,
ge
. Neither bears any sign of case at all, so that,
form for form, they are equally and indifferently nominative and
accusative. Hence, it, perhaps, is more logical to say that a certain
form (
you
), is used
either
as a nominative or accusative,
than to say
[163]
that the accusative case is used instead
of a nominative. It is clear that
you
can be used instead of

ye
only so far as it is nominative in power.

Ye
.—As far as the evidence of such expressions as
get
on with ye
is concerned, the word
ye
is an accusative form.
The reasons why it should or should not be treated as such are involved
in the previous paragraph.

§ 222
.
Me
.—carrying out the views
just laid down, and admitting
you
to be a nominative, or

quasi
-nominative case, we may extend the reasoning to the word

me
, and call it also a secondary or equivocal nominative; inasmuch
as such phrases as
it is me
=
it is I
are common.

Now to call such expressions incorrect English is to assume the point.
No one says that
c'est moi
is bad French, and that
c'est je

is good.

§ 223
.
Caution.
—Observe, however,
that the expression
it is me
=
it is I
will not justify the
use of
it is him
,
it is her
=
it is he
and
it is
she
.
Me
,
ye
,
you
, are what may be called

indifferent forms
,
i.e.
, nominative as much as accusative,
and accusative as much as nominative.
Him
and
her
, on the
other hand, are not indifferent. The
-m
and
-r
are
respectively the signs of cases other than the nominative.

§ 224
. Again: the reasons which allow the form

you
to be considered as a nominative plural, on the strength of
its being used for
ye
, will not allow it to be considered a
nominative singular on the strength of its being used for

thou
.

§ 225
. In phrases like
you are speaking
,
&c., even when applied to a single individual, the idea is really
plural; in other words, the courtesy consists in treating
one

person as
more than one
, and addressing him as such,
[164]
rather than in
using a plural form in a singular sense. It is certain that,
grammatically considered,
you
=
thou
is a plural, since the
verb with which it agrees is plural:—
you are speaking
, not

you art speaking
.

[165]

CHAPTER VI.

ON THE TRUE REFLECTIVE PRONOUN IN THE GOTHIC LANGUAGES, AND ON ITS ABSENCE IN ENGLISH.

§ 226
. A true reflective pronoun is wanting in
English. In other words, there are no equivalents to the Latin forms

sui
,
sibi
,
se
.

Nor yet are there any equivalents to the forms
suus, sua, suum
:
since
his
and
her
are the equivalents to
ejus
and

illius
, and are not adjectives but genitive cases.

At the first view, this last sentence seems unnecessary. It might seem
superfluous to state, that, if there were no such primitive form as

se
, there could be no such secondary form as
suus
.

Such, however, is not the case.
Suus
might exist in the
language, and yet
se
be absent; in other words, the derivative
form might have continued whilst the original one had become extinct.

Such is really the case with the
Old
Frisian. The reflective
personal form, the equivalent to
se
, is lost, whilst the
reflective possessive form, the equivalent to
suus
, is found. In
the
Modern
Frisian, however, both forms are lost.

[166]

CHAPTER VII.

THE DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS,
&c.

§ 227
. The demonstrative pronouns are, 1.
He,
it
. 2.
She
. 3.
This, that
. 4.
The
.

He
,
she
, and
it
, generally looked on as personal,
are here treated as demonstrative pronouns, for the following
reasons.

1. The personal pronouns form an extremely natural class, if the
pronouns of the two first persons be taken by themselves. This is not the
case if they be taken along with
he
,
it
, and

she
.

2. The idea expressed by
he
,
it
, and
she
is
naturally that of demonstrativeness. In the Latin language
is, ea,
id
;
ille, illa, illud
;
hic, hæc, hoc
, are demonstrative
pronouns in sense, as well as in declension.

3. The plural forms
they, them
, in the present English, are the
plural forms of the root of
that
, a true demonstrative pronoun; so
that even if
he
,
she
, and
it
could be treated as
personal pronouns,
they
could not.

4. The word
she
has grown out of the Anglo-Saxon
seó
.
Now
seó
was in Anglo-Saxon the feminine form of the definite
article; the definite article itself being originally a demonstrative
pronoun.

§ 228
. Compared with the Anglo-Saxon the present
English stands as follows:—

She
.—The Anglo-Saxon form
heó
, being lost to the
language, is replaced by the feminine article
seó
.
[167]

§ 229
.
Her
.—This is a case, not of
the present
she
, but of the Anglo-Saxon
heó
: so that

she
may be said to be defective in the oblique cases, and

her
to be defective in the nominative.

Him
.—A dative form, which has replaced the Anglo-Saxon

hine
. When used as a dative, it was neuter as well as
masculine.

His
.—Originally neuter as well as masculine. Now as a
neuter, replaced by
its
—"et quidem ipsa vox
his
, ut
et interrogativum
whose
, nihil aliud sunt quam
hee's
,

who's
, ubi
s
omnino idem præstat quod in aliis possessivis.
Similiter autem

hee's
eodem errore quo nonnunquam

bin

been
; item

pro

,
&c., pro

,

; utrobique contra analogiam

It
.—Changed from the Anglo-Saxon
hit
, by the
ejection of
h
. The
t
is no part of the original word, but a
sign of the neuter gender, forming it regularly from
he
. The same
neuter sign is preserved in the Latin
id
and
illud
.

Its
.—In the course of time the nature of the neuter sign

t
, in
it
, the form being found in but a few words, became
misunderstood. Instead of being looked on as an affix, it passed for part
of the original word. Hence was formed from
it
the anomalous
genitive
its
superseding the Saxon
his
. The same was the
case with—

Hers
.—The
r
is no part of the original word, but
the sign of the dative case. These formations are of value in the history
of cases.

§ 230
.
Theirs
.—In the same
predicament with
hers
and
its
; either the case of an
adjective, or a case formed from a case.

Than
or
then
, and
there
.—Although now
adverbs,
[168]
they were once demonstrative pronouns, in
a certain case and in a certain gender,
viz.
,
than
and

then
masculine accusative and singular,
there
feminine
dative and singular.

§ 231
. An exhibition of the Anglo-Saxon
declension is the best explanation of the English. Be it observed, that
the cases marked in italics are found in the present language.

I.

Se, seó
( =
she
).

Of this word we meet two forms only, both of the singular number, and
both in the nominative case;
viz.
, masc.,
se
; fem.

seó
( = the). The neuter gender and the other cases of the article
were taken from the pronoun
þæt
( = that).

§ 232
.
These
.—Here
observe—

1st. That the
s
is no inflection, but a radical part of the
word, like the
s
in
geese
.

2nd. That the Anglo-Saxon form is
þás
.

These facts create difficulties in respect to the word
these
.
Mr. Guest's view is, perhaps, the best;
viz.
, that the plural
element of the word is the final
-e
, and that this
-e
is
the old English and Anglo-Saxon adjective plural; so that
thes-e

is formed from
this
, as
gode
( =
boni
) is from

god
( =
bonus
).

The nominative plural in the Old English adjective ended in
-e
;
as,

Singular.

Plural.

M.
F.
N.

M.

N.

God
,

In Old English MSS. this plural in
-e
is general. It occurs not
only in adjectives and pronouns as a regular inflection, but even as a
plural of the genitive
his
, that word being treated as a
nominative singular; so that
hise
is formed from
his
, as

sui
from
suus
, or as
eji
might have been formed from

ejus
; provided that in the Latin language this last word had been
mistaken for a nominative singular. The following examples are Mr.
Guest's.

CHAPTER VIII.

THE RELATIVE, INTERROGATIVE, AND CERTAIN OTHER PRONOUNS.

§ 234
. In the relative and interrogative
pronouns,
who
,
what
,
whom
,
whose
, we have,
expressed by a change of form, a neuter gender,
what
; a dative
case
whom
; and a genitive case,
whose
: the true power of
the
s
(
viz.
, as the sign of a case) being obscured by the
orthographical addition of the
e
mute.

To these may be added, 1. the adverb
why
, originally the
ablative form
hvi
(
quo modo?

quâ viâ?
). 2. The
adverb
where
, a feminine dative, like
there
. 3.

When
, a masculine accusative (in Anglo-Saxon
hwæne
), and
analogous to
then
.

The two sounds in the Danish words
hvi
,
hvad
, &c.,
and the two sounds in the English,
what
,
when
(Anglo-Saxon,

hwæt
,
hwæne
) account for the forms
why
and

how
. In the first the
w
alone, in the second the
h

alone, is sounded. The Danish for
why
is
hvi
, pronounced

vi
.

§ 235
. The following remarks (some of them not
strictly etymological) apply to a few of the remaining pronouns.

Same
.—Wanting in Anglo-Saxon, where it was replaced by
the word
ylca
,
ylce
. Probably derived from the Norse.

Self
.—In
myself
,
thyself
,
herself
,

ourselves
,
yourselves
,
[174]
a substantive (or with
a substantival power), and preceded by a genitive case. In
himself

and
themselves
an adjective (or with an adjectival power), and
preceded by an accusative case.
Itself
is equivocal, since we
cannot say whether its elements are
it
and
self
, or

its
and
self
; the
s
having been dropped in
utterance. It is very evident that either the form like
himself
,
or the form like
thyself
, is exceptionable; in other words, that
the use of the word is inconsistent. As this inconsistency is as old as
the Anglo-Saxons, the history of the word gives us no elucidation. In
favour of the forms like
myself
(
self
being a substantive),
are the following facts:—

1. The plural word
selves
, a substantival, and not an
adjectival form.

2. The Middle High German phrases
mîn lîp
,
dîn lîp
,

my body
,
thy body
, equivalent in sense to
myself
,

thyself
.

3. The circumstance that if
self
be dealt with as a
substantive, such phrases as
my own self
,
his own great
self
, &c., can be used; whereby the language is a gainer.

"Vox
self
, pluraliter
selves
, quamvis etiam pronomen a
quibusdam censeatur (quoniam ut plurimum per Latinum
ipse

redditur), est tamen plane nomen substantivum, cui quidem vix aliquod
apud Latinos substantivum respondet; proxime tamen accedet vox

persona
vel
propria persona
ut
my self
,
thy
self
,
our selves
,
your selves
, &c. (
ego
ipse
,
tu ipse
,
nos ipsi
,
vos ipsi
, &c.), ad
verbum
mea persona
,
tua persona
, &c. Fateor tamen

himself
,
itself
,
themselves
, vulgo dici pro

his-self
,
its-self
,
theirselves
; at (interposito

own
)
his own self
, &c.,
ipsius propria persona
,
&c."—Wallis. c. vii.

4. The fact that many persons actually say
hisself
and

theirselves
.
[175]

Whit
.—As in the phrase
not a whit
. This enters in
the compound pronouns
aught
and
naught
.

One
.—As in the phrase
one does so and so
. From the
French
on
. Observe that this is from the Latin
homo
, in Old
French
hom
,
om
. In the Germanic tongues
man
is used
in the same sense:
man sagt
=
one says
=
on dit
.

One
, like
self
and
other
, is so far a substantive,
that it is inflected. Gen. sing,
one's own self
: plural,
my
wife and little ones are well
.

Derived pronouns.
—
Any
, in Anglo-Saxon,

ænig
. In Old High German we have
einîc
=
any
, and

einac
=
single
. In Anglo-Saxon
ânega
means

single
. In Middle High German
einec
is always single. In
New High German
einig
means, 1.
a certain person

(
quidam
), 2.
agreeing
;
einzig
, meaning

single
. In Dutch
ênech
has both meanings. This indicates
the word
án
,
one
, as the root of the word in question.

Compound pronouns.
—
Which
, as has been already
stated more than once, is most incorrectly called the neuter of

who
. Instead of being a neuter, it is a compound word. The
adjective
leiks
,
like
, is preserved in the
Mœso-Gothic words
galeiks
and
missaleiks
. In Old High
German the form is
lih
, in Anglo-Saxon
lic
. Hence we have
Mœso-Gothic
hvêleiks
; Old High German,
huëlih
;
Anglo-Saxon,
huilic
and
hvilc
; Old Frisian,
hwelik
;
Danish,
hvilk-en
; German,
welch
; Scotch,
whilk
;
English,
which
. The same is the case with—

1.
Such
.—Mœso-Gothic,
svaleiks
; Old High
German,
sôlîh
; Old Saxon,
sulîc
; Anglo-Saxon,
svilc
;
German,
solch
; English,
such
. Rask's derivation of the
Anglo-Saxon
swilc
from
swa-ylc
, is exceptionable.

2.
Thilk
.—An old English word, found in the provincial
dialects, as
thick
,
thuck
,
theck
, and hastily
derived by Tyrwhitt, Ritson, and Weber, from
së ylca
, is found

[176]
in the following forms: Mœso-Gothic,

þéleiks
; Norse,
þvilikr
.

3.
Ilk
.—Found in the Scotch, and always preceded by the
article;
the ilk
, or
that ilk
, meaning
the same
. In
Anglo-Saxon this word is
ycla
, preceded also by the article
se
ylca
,
seó ylce
,
þæt ylce
. In English, as seen above,
the word is replaced by
same
. In no other Gothic dialect does it
occur. According to Grimm, this is no simple word, but a compound one, of
which some such
word
as
ei
is the first, and
lîc
the second
element.

Aught
.—In Mœso-Gothic is found the particle,

aiv
,
ever
, but only in negative propositions;
ni

(
not
) preceding it. Its Old High German form is
êo
,

io
; in Middle High German,
ie
; in New High German,

je
; in Old Saxon,
io
; in Anglo-Saxon,
â
; in Norse,

æ
. Combined with this particle the word
whit
(
thing
)
gives the following forms: Old High German,
êowiht
; Anglo-Saxon,

âviht
; Old Frisian,
âwet
; English
aught
. The word

naught
is
aught
preceded by the negative particle.

Each
.—The particle
gi
enters, like the particle in
the composition of pronouns. Old High German,
êogalîher
, every
one;
êocalih
, all; Middle High German,
iegelich
; New High
German,
jeglich
; Anglo-Saxon,
ælc
; English,
each
;
the
l
being dropped, as in
which
and
such
.

Ælc
, as the original of the English
each
and the Scotch

ilka
,
[51]
must by no means be confounded
with the word
ylce
,
the same
.

Every
in Old English,
everich
,
everech
,

everilk one
, is
ælc
, preceded by the particle
ever
.
(Grimm. D. G. iii. 54.)

Either
.—Old High German,
êogahuëdar
; Middle High
German,
iegewëder
; Anglo-Saxon,
æghväðer
,
ægðer
; Old
Frisian,
eider
.

[177]

Neither
.—The same with the negative article prefixed.

Neither
:
either
::
naught
:
aught
.

§ 236
.
Other
,
whether
.—These
words, although derived forms, being simpler than some that have
preceded, might fairly have been dealt with before. They make, however, a
transition from the present to the succeeding chapter, and so find a
place here.

A.
First
, it may be stated of them that the idea which they
express is not that of
one out of many
, but that of
one out of
two
.

1. In Sanscrit there are two forms,
a
)
kataras
, the
same word as
whether
, meaning
which out of two
;

b
)
katamas, which out of many
. So also
êkateras, one
out of two
;
êkatamas, one out of many
. In Greek the Ionic form

κότερος
(πότερος)
; in Latin,

uter
,
neuter
,
alter
; and in Mœso-Gothic,

hvathar
, have the same form and the same meaning.

2. In the Scandinavian language the word
anden
, Dano-Saxon,

annar
, Iceland. corresponds to the English word
second
, and
not the German
zweite
: e.g.,
Karl den Anden, Charles the
Second
. Now
anthar
is the older form of
other
.

B.
Secondly
, it may be stated of them, that the termination

-er
is the same termination that we find in the comparative
degree.

1. The idea expressed by the comparative degree is the comparison, not
of
many
but of
two
things;
this is better than
that
.

2. In all the Indo-European languages where there are pronouns in

-ter
, there is also a comparative degree in
-ter
. See next
chapter.

3. As the Sanscrit form
kataras
corresponds with the
comparative degree, where there is the comparison of
two things with
each other
; so the word
katamas
is a
[178]
superlative form; and
in the superlative degree lies the comparison of
many
things with
each other.

Hence
other
and
whether
(to which may be added

either
and
neither
) are pronouns with the comparative
form.

Other
has the additional peculiarity of possessing the plural
form
others
. Hence, like
self
, it is, in the strictest
sense, a substantival pronoun.

[179]

CHAPTER IX.

ON CERTAIN FORMS IN -ER.

§ 237
. Preparatory to the consideration of the
degrees of comparison, it is necessary to make some remarks upon a
certain class of words, which, with considerable differences of
signification, all agree in one fact,
viz.
, all terminate in

-er
, or
t-er
.

1. Certain pronouns, as
ei-th-er
,
n-ei-th-er
,

whe-th-er
, or
o-th-er
.

2. Certain prepositions and adverbs, as
ov-er
,
und-er
,

af-t-er
.

3. Certain adjectives, with the form of the comparative, but the power
of the positive degree; as
upp-er
,
und-er
,
inn-er
,

out-er
,
hind-er
.

4. All adjectives of the comparative degree; as
wis-er
,

strong-er
,
bett-er
, &c.

Now what is the idea common to all these words, expressed by the sign

-er
, and connecting the four divisions into one class? It is not
the mere idea of comparison; although it is the comparative degree, to
the expression of which the affix in question is more particularly
applied. Bopp, who has best generalised the view of these forms,
considers the fundamental idea to be that of
duality
. In the
comparative degree we have a relation between one object and
some

other object like it, or a relation between two single elements of
comparison:
A is wiser than B
. In the superlative degree we have a
relation between one
[180]
object and
all
others like it, or a
relation between one single and one complex element of comparison:
A
is wiser than B, C, D
, &c.

"As in comparatives a relation between
two
, and in superlatives
a relation between
many
, lies at the bottom, it is natural that
their suffixes should be transferred to other words, whose chief notion
is individualised through that of duality or
plurality."—"Vergleichende Grammatik," § 292, Eastwick's and
Wilson's Translation.

The most important proofs of the view adduced by Bopp are,—

1. The Sanskrit form
kataras
=
which of
two

persons?
is a comparative form; whilst
katamas
=
which of
more than two persons?
a superlative form. Similarly,
êkataras

=
one of two persons
;
êkatamas
=
one of more than two
persons
.

2. The Greek forms,
ἑκάτερος
=

each
(
or either
)
out of two persons
; whilst
ἕκαστος
=
each or
any out of more than two persons
.

§ 238
. The more important of the specific
modifications of the general idea involved in the comparison of two
objects are,—

1. Contrariety: as in
inner
,
outer
,
under
,

upper
,
over
. In Latin the words for
right
and

left
end in
-er
,—
dexter
,
sinister
.

2. Choice in the way of an alternative; as
either
,

neither
,
whether
,
other
.

§ 239
.
Either
,
neither
,

other
,
whether
.—It has just been stated that the
general fundamental idea common to all these forms is that of
choice
between one of two objects in the way of an alternative
. Thus far the
termination
-er
in
either
, &c., is the termination

-er
in the true comparatives,
brav-er
,
wis-er
,
&c.
Either
and
neither
are common pronouns.

Other
, like
one
, is a
[181]
pronoun capable of
taking the plural form of a substantive (
others
), and also that of
the genitive case (
the other's money, the other's bread
).

Whether
is a pronoun in the almost obsolete form
whether
(
=
which
)
of the two do you prefer
, and a conjunction in
sentences like
whether will you do this or not
? The use of the
form
others
is recent. "
They are taken out of the way as all
other.
"—Job. "
And leave their riches for
other.
"—Psalms.

[182]

CHAPTER X.

THE COMPARATIVE DEGREE.

§ 240
. There are four leading facts
here,—

1.
The older form in -s.
In English we say old-
er
,
bett-
er
, sweet-
er
; in Old High German they similarly said,
alt-
iro
, bets-
iro
, suats-
iro
; but in
Mœso-Gothic the forms were ald-
iza
, bat-
iza
,
sut-
iza
.

2.
Adverbs
are susceptible of comparison;

e.g.
—
Come as soon as you can, but do not come sooner than
is convenient
.

3. The Anglo-Saxon comparison of the adverbs is different from that of
the adjectives; there being one form in
-re
and
-este
,
another in
-or
and
-ost
respectively. Now the first of
these was the form taken by adjectives: as
se scearp-re sweord
=

the sharper sword
, and
se scearp-este sword
=
the
sharpest sword
. The second, on the other hand, was the form taken by
adverbs: as,
se sweord scyrð scearp-or
=
the sword cuts
sharper
, and
se sweord scyrð scearp-ost
=
the sword cuts
sharpest
.

4. In the Anglo-Saxon, the following words exhibit a change of
vowel.

Positive.
Comparative.
Superlative.

Lang,
Lengre,
Lengest.
Long.

Strang,
Strengre,
Strengest.
Strong.

Geong,
Gyngre,
Gyngest.
Young.

Sceort,
Scyrtre,
Scyrtest.
Short.

Heáh,
Hyrre,
Hyhst.
High.

Eald,
Yldre,
Yldest.
Old.

[183]

§ 241
. Now the fourth of these facts explains
the present forms
elder
and
eldest
, the comparatives and
superlative of
old
, besides which there are the regular forms

old-er
and
old-est
; between which there is, however, a
difference in meaning—
elder
being used as a substantive, and
having a plural form,
elders
.

§ 242
. The abverbial forms in
-or
and

-ost
, as compared with the adjectival in
-re
, and

-este
explain the form
rather
. This rhymes to

father
; the
a
being full. Nevertheless, the positive form
is
rather
meaning
quick, easy
= the classical root
ῥαδ-
in
ῥάδιος
. What we do

quickly
and
willingly
we do
preferably
. Now if the
word
rather
were an adjective, the vowel of the comparative would
be sounded as the
a
in
fate
, as it is, however, it is
abverbial, and as such is properly sounded as the
a
in

father
.

The difference between the action of the small vowel in
-re
,
and of the full in
-or
effects this difference, since
o

being a full vowel, it has the effect of making the
a
full
also.

§ 243
. The old form in
-s
will be
considered, after notice has been taken of what may be called—

§ 244
.
Excess of expression.
—Of
this two samples have already been given: 1. in words like

songstress
; 2. in words like
children
. This may be called

excess of expression
; the feminine gender, in words like

songstress
, and the plural number, in words like
children
,
being expressed twice over. In the vulgarism
betterer
for

better
, and in the antiquated forms
worser
for

worse
, and
lesser
for
less
, we have, in the case of
the comparatives, as elsewhere, an excess of expression. In the old High
German we have the forms
betsërôro
,
mêrôro
,
êrërëra

=
better
,
more
,
ere
.

§ 245
.
Better
.—Although in the
superlative form
best

[184]
there is a slight variation from the
strict form of that degree, the word
better
is perfectly regular.
So far, then, from truth are the current statements that the comparison
of the words
good, better
, and
best
is irregular. The
inflection is not irregular, but defective. As the statement that applies
to
good
,
better
, and
best
applies to many words
besides, it will be well in this place, once for all, to exhibit it in
full.

§ 246
.
Difference between a sequence in logic
and a sequence in etymology.
—The ideas or notions of
thou,
thy, thee
, are ideas between which there is a metaphysical or logical
connexion. The train of such ideas may be said to form a sequence, and
such a sequence may be called a logical one.

The words
thou, thy, thee
, are words between which there is a

formal
or an
etymological
connexion. A train of such words
may be called a sequence, and such a sequence may be called an
etymological one.

In the case of
thou, thy, thee
, the etymological sequence
tallies with the
logical
one.

The ideas of
I
,
my
, and
me
are also in a logical
sequence: but the forms
I
,
my
, and
me
are not
altogether in an etymological one.

In the case of
I, my, me
, the etymological sequence does

not
tally (or tallies imperfectly) with the logical one.

This is only another way of saying that between the words
I
and

me
there is no connexion in etymology.

It is also only another way of saying, that, in the oblique cases,

I
, and, in the nominative case,
me
, are

defective
.

Now the same is the case with
good, better
,
bad, worse
,
&c.
Good
and
bad
are defective in the comparative and
superlative degrees;
better
and
worse
are
[185]
defective in
the positive; whilst between
good
and
better
,
bad

and
worse
, there is a sequence in logic, but no sequence in
etymology.

§ 247
. To return, however, to the word

better
; no absolute positive degree is found in any of the allied
languages, and in none of the allied languages is there found any
comparative form of
good
. Its root occurs in the following
adverbial forms: Mœso-Gothic,
bats
; Old High German,

pats
; Old Saxon and Anglo-Saxon,
bet
; Middle High German,

baz
; Middle Dutch,
bat
,
bet
.

§ 248
.
Worse
.—This word is one of
two things.

1. It is a positive form with a comparative sense; in which case

s
is part of the root.

2. It is a comparative degree from the positive form
wor-

(
vair-
,
wir-
,
vyr-
), in which case
s
is the

s
of the Old Mœso-Gothic inflexion preserved in this single
word.

§ 249
.
More
.—In Anglo-Saxon this is

mâ
; in the English of the reign of Elizabeth it is
moe
; and
in certain provincial dialects it is
mo
, at the present time.

Notwithstanding this,
i.e.
, the form being positive, the

power
of the word has always been comparative, and meant

more
rather than
much
, or
many
.

§ 250
.
Less
.—In Anglo-Saxon

læssa
and
læs
. Here there is no
unequivocal
sign of
the comparative degree; what, then, is the nature of the word? Is it a
positive form with a comparative power like
moe
? or is it an old
comparative in
-s
? This is undecided. What does it come from?
Grimm derives it from the Mœso-Gothic root
lasiv
=

weak
. His doctrine is doubtful. I cannot but believe that it comes
from the same root as
litt-le
; where the old Frisian form

litich
, shows that the
-l
is no essential part of the word,
and the Danish form
lille
gets
[186]
rid of the
t
.
Still the word is difficult; indeed it is unexplained.

§ 251
.
Near
,

nearer
.—Anglo-Saxon,
neah
; comparative,

nearre
,
near
,
nyr
; superlative,
nyhst
,

nehst
. Observe, in the Anglo-Saxon positive and superlative, the
absence of the
r
. This shows that the English positive
near

is the Anglo-Saxon comparative
nearre
, and that in the secondary
comparative
nearer
, we have an
excess of expression
. It may
be, however, that the
r
in
near
is a mere point of
orthography, and that it is not pronounced; since, in the English
language the words
father
and
farther
are, for the most
part, pronounced alike.

§ 252
.
Farther
.—Anglo-Saxon

feor, fyrre, fyrrest
. The
th
seems euphonic, inserted by
the same process that gives the
δ
in
ἀνδρὸς
, from
ἀνὴρ
= man.

Further
.—Confounded with
farther
, although in
reality from a different word,
fore
. Old High German,

furdir
; New High German,
der vordere
; Anglo-Saxon,

fyrðre
.

§ 253
.
Former
.—A comparative formed
from the superlative;
forma
being such. Consequently, an instance
of excess of expression, combined with irregularity.

§ 254
. In Mœso-Gothic
spêdists

means
last
, and
spêdiza
=
later
. Of the word

spêdists
two views may be taken. According to one it is the
positive degree with the addition of
st
; according to the other,
it is the comparative degree with the addition only of
t
. Now,
Grimm and others lay down as a rule, that the superlative is formed, not
directly from the positive, but indirectly through the comparative.

With the exception of
worse
and
less
, all the English
comparatives end in
-r
: yet no superlative ends in
-rt
, the
form being, not
wise, wiser, wisert
, but
wise, wiser,
wisest
. This fact, without invalidating the notion just laid down,
gives additional importance to the comparative forms in
s
;
[187]
since
it is from these, before they have changed to
r
, that we must
suppose the superlatives to have been derived. The theory being admitted,
we can, by approximation, determine the comparative antiquity of the
superlative degree. It was introduced
after
the establishment of
the comparative, and
before
the change of
-s
into

-r
.

[188]

CHAPTER XI.

THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE.

§ 255
. The Anglo-Saxon word for
first
was

for-m-a
.

The root was
for
= the Latin
præ
, the Greek
προ
, and being the same
combination which occurs in
fore
,
fore-m-ost
, &c.

The
m
was the Anglo-Saxon sign of the superlative degree.

It is the
m
in the Latin words
pri-m-us
,

inti-m-us
,
exti-m-us
,
ulti-m-us
, &c.

It occurs even in the Gothic tongues; in other words, besides

for-m-a
.

In short,
m
is an old sign of the superlative degree; probably
older than the usual form,
-st
, discussed in §
254
. This has some important applications.

§ 256
.
Former
.—This is a remarkable
word: it is a comparative derived from the Anglo-Saxon superlative, and
its analysis is
for-m-er
, with
excess of inflexion
.

§ 257
.
Nea-r-est
.—Here the
r

is no part of the original root, as may be seen in §
251
. It has grown out of
-ah
pronounced as the

a
in
father
. The true forms are positive,
neah
;
comparative,
neah-er
; superlative,
neah-est
. Such, to a
certain extent, is really the case.

§ 258
.
Next
.—The superlative of

nigh
, contracted from
nigh-est
. The Anglo-Saxon forms were

neah
,
nyh-st
,
neh-st
,
nyh-ste
. In Anglo-Saxon
the letter
h
was pronounced strongly, and sounded like
g
or

k
. This fact is
[189]
still shown in the spelling; as

ni
gh. In the word
next
this sound is preserved, slightly
changed into that of
k
;
next
=
nek-st
.

§ 259
.

Upmost
, &c.—The common
statement concerning words like
upmost
is, that they are compound
words, formed by the addition of the word
most
: this, however, is
more than doubtful.

The Anglo-Saxon language presents us with the following
forms:—

Anglo-Saxon.
English.

Innema (inn-ema),
Inmost (in-m-ost).

Ûtema (ût-ma),
Outmost (out-m-ost).

Siðema (sið-ema),
Latest.

Lætema (læt-ema),
Latest.

Niðema (nið-ema),
Nethermost (neth-er-m-ost).

Forma (for-ma),
Foremost (fore-m-ost).

Æftema (aft-ema),
Aftermost (aft-er-m-ost).

Ufema (uf-ema),
Upmost (up-m-ost).

Hindema (hind-ema),
Hindmost (hind-m-ost).

Midema (mid-ema),
Midmost (mid-m-ost).

Now the words in question show at once, that, as far as they are
concerned, the
m
that appears in the last syllable of each has
nothing to do with the word
most
.

From the words in question there was formed, in Anglo-Saxon, a regular
superlative form in the usual manner;
viz.
, by the addition of

-st
; as
æfte-m-est
,
fyr-m-est
,
læte-m-est
,

sið-m-est
,
yfe-m-est
,
ute-m-est
,

inne-m-est
.

Hence, in the present English, the different parts of the syllable

most
(in words like
upmost
) come from different quarters.
The
m
is the
m
in the Anglo-Saxon words
innema
,
&c.; whilst the
-st
is the common sign of the superlative.
Hence, in separating such words as
midmost
into its component
parts, we should write
[190]

Mid-m-ost
not
mid-most.

Ut-m-ost
—
ut-most.

Up-m-ost
—
up-most.

Fore-m-ost
—
fore-most.

In-m-ost
—
in-most.

Hind-m-ost
—
hind-most.

Out-m-ost
—
out-most.

§ 260
. In certain words, however, the syllable

m-ost
is added to a word already ending in
-er
; that is,
already marked with the sign of the comparative degree.

Neth-er-m-ost.
Hind-er-m-ost.

Utt-er-m-ost.
Out-er-m-ost.

Upp-er-m-ost.
Inn-er-m-ost.

[191]

CHAPTER XII.

THE CARDINAL NUMBERS.

§ 261
. Generally speaking, the greater part of
the cardinal numbers are undeclined. As far as
number
goes, this
is necessary.

One
is naturally and exclusively
singular
.

Two
is naturally
dual
.

The rest are naturally and exclusively
plural
.

As to the inflection of gender and case, there is no reason why all
the numerals should not be as fully inflected as the Latin
unus, una,
unum
,
unius
. It is a mere habit of our language that they are
not so in English.

[192]

CHAPTER XIII.

THE ORDINAL NUMBERS.

§ 262
. By referring to §
259
, we see that
-m
was an early sign of the
superlative degree. This bears upon the numerals
seven
,

nine
, and
ten
.

These are
cardinal
numbers. Nevertheless, the present chapter
is the proper place for noticing them.

There is good reason for believing that the final
-n
is no part
of the original root. Thus,—

a.

Sev-en
= the Latin
sept-em
, where the

-m
is equivalent to the
-n
. But in the Greek
ἑπτὰ
, and the
Scandinavian
syv
, and
sju
, neither
-n
nor
-m

occur.

b.

Ni-ne
.—This same applies here. The Latin form
is
nov-em
; but the Greek and Norse are
ἐννέα
and
niu
.

c.

Ten
.—The older form is
ti-h-un
, in Latin

de-c-em
. The English
-n
is the Latin
-m
.
Nevertheless, in the Greek and Norse the forms are
δέκα
and
tuo
.

§ 263
. What explains this? The following
hypothesis. Some of the best German authorities believe, that the

-m
, expressive of the superlative degree, was also used to denote
the
ordinal character
(
ordinality
)
of the numerals
;
so that the
-m-
in
deci-m-us
, was the
-m-
in

ulti-m-us
and
exti-m-us
. This is the first step in the
explanation.

§ 264
. The next is, to suppose that certain

cardinal
numerals have taken and retained the
ordinal
form;
these being the—
[193]

Latin.
English.
Greek.
Norse.

Sept-em
,
sev-en
,
as opposed to the
ἑπτὰ
,
sjau
.

Nov-em
,
ni-ne
,
"          "
ἐννέα
,
níu
.

Dec-em
,
te-n
,
"          "
δέκα
,
tíu
.

I give no opinion as to the accuracy or erroneousness of this
view.

§ 265
.
Thir-teen
, &c., is

three
with
ten
added, or 3 + 10.

§ 266
.
Thir-ty
, &c., is
three
tens
(
three decades
), or 3 × 10. In Mœso-Gothic we find
the
-ty
in the fuller form
tig
=
δέκ-ας
in Greek.

[194]

CHAPTER XIV.

THE ARTICLES.

§ 267
. In the generality of grammars the
definite article
the
, and the indefinite article
an
, are
the very first parts of speech that are considered. This is
exceptionable. So far are they from being essential to language, that, in
many dialects, they are wholly wanting. In Greek there is no indefinite,
in Latin there is neither an indefinite nor a definite article. In the
former language they say
ἀνήρ τις
=
a certain
man
: in the latter the words
filius patris
mean equally
the
son of the father
,
a son of a father
,
a son of the
father
, or
the son of a father
. In Mœso-Gothic and in
Old Norse, there is an equal absence of the indefinite article; or, at
any rate, if there be one at all, it is a different word from what occurs
in English. In these the Greek
τις
is expressed by the Gothic root

sum
.

Now, since it is very evident that, as far as the sense is concerned,
the words
some man
,
a certain man
, and
a man
, are
much the same, an exception may be taken to the statement that in Greek
and Mœso-Gothic there is no indefinite article. It may, in the
present state of the argument, be fairly said that the words
sum

and
τις
are pronouns
with a certain sense, and that
a
and
an
are no more;
consequently, that in Greek the indefinite article is
τις
, in Mœso-Gothic
sum
, and in
English
a
or
an
.
[195]

A distinction, however, may be made. In the expression
ἀνήρ
τις
(
anær tis
) =
a certain man
, or

a man
, and in the expression
sum mann
, the words
sum

and
τις
preserve
their natural and original meaning; whilst in
a man
and
an
ox
the words
a
and
an
are used in a secondary sense.
These words, as is currently known, are one and the same, the
n
,
in the form
a
, being ejected through a euphonic process. They are,
moreover, the same words with the numeral
one
; Anglo-Saxon,

án
; Scotch,
ane
. Now, between the words
a man
and

one man
, there is a difference in meaning; the first expression
being the most indefinite. Hence comes the difference between the English
and Mœso-Gothic expressions. In the one the word
sum
has a
natural, in the other, the word
an
has a secondary power.

The same reasoning applies to the word
the
. Compared with
a
man
, the words
the man
are very definite. Compared, however,
with the words
that man
, they are the contrary. Now, just as

an
and
a
have arisen out of the numeral
one
, so has

the
arisen out of the demonstrative pronoun
þæt
, or at
least from some common root. It will be remembered that in Anglo-Saxon
there was a form
þe
, undeclined, and common to all the cases of
all the numbers.

In no language in its oldest stage is there ever a word giving, in its
primary sense, the ideas of
a
and
the
. As tongues become
modern, some noun with a
similar
sense is used to express them. In
the course of time a change of form takes place, corresponding to the
change of meaning;
e.g.
,
one
becomes
an
, and
afterwards
a
. Then it is that articles become looked upon as
separate parts of speech, and are dealt with accordingly. No invalidation
of this statement is drawn from the Greek language. Although the first
page of the etymology gives us
ὁ
,
ἡ
,
τὸ
(
ho, hæ,
[196]
to
), as
the definite articles, the corresponding page in the syntax informs us,
that, in the oldest stage of the language,
ὁ
(
ho
) =
the
, had the power of
οὗτος

(
howtos
) =
this
.

The origin of the articles seems uniform. In German
ein
, in
Danish
en
, stand to
one
in the same relation that
an

does. The French
un
, Italian and Spanish
uno
, are similarly
related to
unus
=
one
.

And as, in English,
the
, in German
der
, in Danish

den
, come from the demonstrative pronouns, so, in the classical
languages, are the French
le
, the Italian
il
and
lo
,
and the Spanish
el
, derived from the Latin demonstrative

ille
.

In his "Outlines of Logic," the present writer has given reasons for
considering the word
no
(as in
no man
) an article.

That
the
, in expressions like
all the more
,
all the
better
, &c., is no article, has already been shown.

[197]

CHAPTER XV.

DIMINUTIVES, AUGMENTATIVES, AND PATRONYMICS.

§ 268
. Compared with the words
lamb
,

man
, and
hill
, the
words

lambkin
,
mannikin
, and
hillock
convey
the idea of comparative smallness or diminution. Now, as the word

hillock
=
a little hill
differs in
form
from

hill
, we have in English a series of
diminutive
forms, or

diminutives
.

The English diminutives may be arranged according to a variety of
principles. Amongst others:

1.
According to their form.
—The word
hillock
is
derived from
hill
, by the
addition
of a
syllable
.
The word
tip
is derived from
top
, by the
change
of a

vowel
.

2.
According to their meaning.
—In the word
hillock

there is the simple expression of comparative smallness in size. In the
word
doggie
for
dog
,
lassie
for
lass
, the
addition of the
-ie
makes the word not so much a diminutive as a
term of tenderness or endearment. The idea of smallness, accompanied,
perhaps, with that of neatness, generally carries with it the idea of
approbation; hence, the word
clean
in English, means, in German,

little
=
kleine
. The feeling of protection which is
extended to small objects engenders the notion of endearment.

§ 269
. The Greek word
μείωσις

(
meiôsis
) means diminution; the Greek word
ὑποκόρισμα

(
hypokorisma
) means
[198]
an endearing expression. Hence we get
names for the two kinds of diminutives;
viz.
, the term

meiotic
for the true diminutives, and the term
hypocoristic

for the diminutives of endearment.

3.
According to their historical origin.
—The syllable

-ock
, as in
hillock
, is of Anglo-Saxon and Gothic origin.
The
-et
, as in
lancet
, is of French and classical
origin.

4.
According as they affect proper names, or common
names.
—
Hawkin
,
Perkin
,
Wilkin
, &c. In
these words we have the diminutives of
Hal
,
Peter
,

Will
, &c.

§ 270
. The diminutive forms of Gothic origin are
the first to be considered.

1.
Those formed by a change of vowel.
—
Tip
, from

top
. The relation of the feminine to the masculine is allied to
the ideas conveyed by many diminutives. Hence in the word
kit
,
from
cat
, it is doubtful whether there be meant a female cat or a
little cat.
Kid
is a diminutive form of
goat
.

2.
Those formed by the addition of a letter or
letters.
—Of the diminutive characteristics thus formed the
commonest, beginning from the simpler forms, are

Ie
.—Almost peculiar to the Lowland Scotch; as

daddie
,
lassie
,
minnie
,
wifie
,
mousie
,

doggie
,
boatie
, &c.

Ock
.—
Bullock
,
hillock
.

Kin
.—
Lambkin
,
mannikin
,
ladikin
,
&c. As is seen above, common in proper names.

En
.—
Chicken
,
kitten
, from
cock
,

cat
. The notion of diminution, if indeed that be the notion
originally conveyed, lies not in the
-en
, but in the vowel. In the
word
chicken
, from
cock
, observe the effect of the small
vowel on the
c
.

The consideration of words like
duckling
, and
gosling
,
is purposely deferred.

The chief diminutive of classical origin is—
[199]

Et
, as in
trumpet
,
lancet
,
pocket
; the
word
pock
, as in
meal-pock
=
a meal-bag
, being found
in the Scottish. From the French
-ette
, as in
caissette
,

poulette
.

The forms
-rel
, as in
cockerel
,
pickerel
, and

-let
, as in
streamlet
, require a separate consideration.
The first has nothing to do with the Italian forms
acquerella
and

coserella
—themselves, perhaps, of Gothic, rather than of
classical origin.

In the Old High-German there are a multitude of diminutive forms in

-el
; as
ouga
=
an eye
,
ougili
=
a little
eye
;
lied
=
a song
,
liedel
=
a little
song
. This indicates the nature of words like
cockerel
.

Even in English the diminutive power of
-el
can be traced in
the following words:—

Soare
= a deer in its third year.
Sor-rel
—a deer
in its second year.—See "Love's Labour Lost," with the note.

Tiercel
= a small sort of hawk, one-third less (
tierce
)
than the common kind.

Kantle
=
small corner
, from
cant
=
a
corner
.—"Henry IV."

Hurdle
; in Dutch
horde
; German,
hurde
.

Hording
, without the
-l
, is used in an allied sense by
builders in English.

In the words in point we must assume an earlier form,
cocker

and
piker
, to which the diminutive form
-el
is affixed. If
this be true, we have, in English, representatives of the diminutive form

-el
so common in the High Germanic dialects.
Wolfer
=
a
wolf
,
hunker
=
a haunch
,
flitcher
=
a
flitch
,
teamer
=
a team
,
fresher
=
a
frog
,—these are north country forms of the present English.

The termination
-let
, as in
streamlet
, seems to be
double, and to consist of the Gothic diminutive
-l
, and the French
diminutive
-t
.
[200]

§ 271
.
Augmentatives.
—Compared with

capello
=
a hat
, the Italian word
capellone
=
a
great hat
, is an augmentative. The augmentative forms, pre-eminently
common in the Italian language, often carry with them a depreciating
sense.

The termination
-rd
(in Old High German,
-hart
), as in

drunkard
,
braggart
,
laggard
,
stinkard
,
carries with it this idea of depreciation. In
buzzard
, and

reynard
, the name of the fox, it is simply augmentative. In

wizard
, from
witch
, it has the power of a masculine
form.

The termination
-rd
, taken from the Gothic, appears in the
modern languages of classical origin: French,
vieillard
; Spanish,

codardo
. From these we get, at secondhand, the word

coward
.

The word
sweetheart
is a derived word of this sort, rather than
a compound word; since in Old High German and Middle High German, we have
the corresponding form
liebhart
. Now the form for
heart
is
in German not
hart
, but
herz
.

Words like
braggadocio
,
trombone
,
balloon
, being
words of foreign origin, prove nothing as to the further existence of
augmentative forms in English.

§ 272
.—
Patronymics.
—In the
Greek language the notion of
lineal descent
, in other words, the
relation of the son to the father, is expressed by a particular
termination; as
Πηλεύς
(
Peleus
),
Πηλείδης

(
Peleidæs
), the son of Peleus. It is very evident that this mode
of expression is very different from either the English form

Johnson
=
the son of John
, or the Gaelic
MacDonald
=

the son of Donald
. In these last-named words, the words
son

and
Mac
mean the same thing; so that
Johnson
and

MacDonald
are not
derived
but
compound
words. This
Greek way of expressing descent is peculiar, and the words wherein it
occurs are classed together by the peculiar name
[201]
patronymic
; from

patær
=
a father
, and
onoma
=
a name
.

Is there anything in English corresponding to the Greek
patronymics?

Not in the
present
English? There was, however, in the
Anglo-Saxon.

In the Anglo-Saxon, the
termination

-ing
is as truly patronymic as
-ίδης
in Greek.
In the Bible-translation the
son of Elisha
is called

Elising
. In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle occur such genealogies as
the following:—

CHAPTER XVI.

GENTILE FORMS.

§ 273
. The only word in the present English that
requires explanation is the name of the principality
Wales
.

1. The form is
plural
, however much the meaning may be

singular
; so that the
-s
in
Wale-s
is the
-s

in
fathers
, &c.

2. It has grown out of the Anglo-Saxon from
wealhas
=

foreigners
, from
wealh
=
a foreigner
, the name by
which the Welsh are spoken of by the Germans of England, just as the
Italians are called Welsh by the Germans of Germany; and just as

wal-nuts
=
foreign nuts
, or
nuces Galliæ
.

Welsh
=
weall-isc
=
foreign
, and is a derived
adjective.

3. The transfer of the name of the
people
inhabiting a certain
country to the
country
so inhabited, was one of the commonest
processes in both Anglo-Saxon and Old English.

[203]

CHAPTER XVII.

ON THE CONNEXION BETWEEN THE NOUN AND VERB, AND ON THE INFLECTION OF THE INFINITIVE MOOD.

§ 274
. In order to understand clearly the use of
the so-called infinitive mood in English, it is necessary to bear in mind
two facts, one a matter of
logic
, the other a matter of

history
.

In the way of
logic
, the difference between a noun and a verb
is less marked than it is in the way of
grammar
.

Grammatically, the contrast is considerable. The inflection of nouns
expresses the ideas of sex as denoted by gender, and of relation in place
as denoted by cases. That of verbs rarely expresses sex, and never
relations in place. On the other hand, however, it expresses what no noun
ever does or can express;
e.g.
, the relation of the agency to the
individual speaking, by means of
person
; the time in which acts
take place, by means of
tense
; and the conditions of their
occurrence, by means of
mood
.

The idea of
number
is the only one that, on a superficial view,
is common to these two important parts of speech.

§ 275
. Logically, however, the contrast is
inconsiderable. A noun denotes an object of which either the senses or
the intellect can take cognizance, and a verb does no more.
To
move
=
motion
,
to rise
=
rising
,
to err
=

error
,
to forgive
=
forgiveness
. The only difference
between the two parts of speech is this, that, whereas a noun
[204]
may
express any object whatever, verbs can only express those objects which
consist in an action. And it is this superadded idea of action that
superadds to the verb the phenomena of tense, mood, person, and voice; in
other words, the phenomena of conjugation.

§ 276
. A noun is a word capable of

declension
only. A verb is a word capable of declension and

conjugation
also. The fact of verbs being declined as well as
conjugated must be remembered.
The participle has the declension of a
noun adjective, the infinitive mood the declension of a noun substantive.
Gerunds and supines, in languages where they occur, are only names for
certain cases of the verb.

§ 277
. Although in all languages the verb is
equally capable of declension, it is not equally declined. The Greeks,
for instance, used forms like

τὸ φθονεῖν
=
invidia
.

τοῦ φθονεῖν
=
invidiæ
.

ἐν τῷ φθονεῖν

=
in invidia
.

§ 278
. Returning, however, to the illustration
of the substantival character of the so-called infinitive mood, we may
easily see—

α
. That the name of any action may be
used without any mention of the agent. Thus, we may speak of the simple
fact of
walking
or
moving
, independently of any
specification of the
walker
or
mover
.

β
. That, when actions are spoken of thus
indefinitely, the idea of either person or number has no place in the
conception; from which it follows that the so-called infinitive mood must
be at once impersonal, and without the distinction of singular, dual, and
plural.

γ
. That, nevertheless, the ideas of
time and relation in space
have
place in the conception. We can
think of
[205]
a person being
in the act of striking a
blow
, of his
having been in the act of striking a blow
, or of
his
being about to be in the act of striking a blow
. We can also
think of a person being
in the act of doing a good action
, or of
his being
from the act of doing a good action
.

§ 279
. This has been written to show that verbs
of languages in general are as naturally declinable as nouns. What
follows will show that the verbs of the Gothic languages in particular
were actually declined, and that fragments of this declension remain in
the present English.

The inflection of the verb in its impersonal (or infinitive state)
consisted, in its fullest form, of three cases, a nominative (or
accusative), a dative, and a genitive. The genitive is put last, because
its occurrence in the Gothic languages is the least constant.

In Anglo-Saxon the nominative (or accusative) ended in
-an
,
with a single
n
.

Lufian
=
to love
=
amare
.

Bærnan
=
to burn

=
urere
.

Syllan
=
to give
=
dare
.

In Anglo-Saxon the dative of the infinitive verb ended in
-nne
,
and was preceded by the preposition
to
.

To lufienne
=
ad amandum
.

To bærnenne
=
ad urendum
.

To syllanne
=
ad dandum
.

The genitive, ending in
-es
, occurs only in Old High German and
Modern High German,
plâsannes
,
weinnenes
.

§ 280
. With these preliminaries we can take a
clear view of the English infinitives. They exist under two forms, and
are referable to a double origin.

1. The
independent
form.—This is used after the words

can
,
may
,
shall
,
will
, and some others, as,

I can speak
,
I may go
,
I shall come
,
I will
move
. Here there
[206]
is no preposition, and the origin of the
infinitive is from the form in
-an
.

2. The
prepositional
form.—This is used after the
majority of English verbs, as,
I wish to speak
,
I mean to
go
,
I intend to come
,
I determine to move
. Here we have
the preposition
to
and the origin of the infinitive is from the
form
-nne
.

§ 281
. Expressions like
to err
=

error
,
to forgive
=
forgiveness
, in lines like

"To err is human, to forgive divine,"

are very remarkable. They exhibit the phenomena of a nominative case
having grown not only out of a dative but out of a dative
plus
its
governing preposition.

[207]

CHAPTER XVIII.

ON DERIVED VERBS.

§ 282
. Of the divisions of verbs into active and
passive, transitive and intransitive, unless there be an accompanying
change of
form
, etymology takes no cognisance. The forces of the
auxiliary verbs, and the tenses to which they are equivalent, are also
points of syntax rather than of etymology.

Four classes, however, of
derived
verbs, as opposed to

simple
, especially deserve notice.

I. Those ending in
-en
; as
soften
,
whiten
,

strengthen
, &c. Here the
-en
is a derivational affix;
and not a representative of the Anglo-Saxon infinitive form
-an

(as
lufian
,
bærnan
=
to love
,
to burn
), and
the Old English
-en
(as
tellen
,
loven
).

II. Transitive verbs derived from intransitives by a change of the
vowel of the root.

Primitive Intransitive Form.
Derived Transitive Form.

Rise
Raise.

Lie
Lay.

Sit
Set.

Fall
Fell.

Drink
Drench.

In Anglo-Saxon these words were more numerous than they are at
present.
[208]

Intrans. Infinitive.
Trans. Infinitive.

Yrnan,
to run
Ærnan,
to make to run
.

Byrnan,
to burn
Bærnan,
to make to burn
.

Drincan,
to drink
Drencan,
to drench
.

Sincan,
to sink
Sencan,
to make to sink
.

Liegan,
to lie
Lecgan,
to lay
.

Sittan,
to sit
Settan,
to set
.

Drífan,
to drift
Dræfan,
to drive
.

Fëallan,
to fall
Fyllan,
to fell
.

Wëallan,
to boil
Wyllan,
to make to boil
.

Flëogan,
to fly
A-fligan,
to put to flight
.

Bëogan,
to bow
Bígan,
to bend
.

Faran,
to go
Feran,
to convey
.

Wacan,
to wake
Weccan,
to waken
.

All these intransitives form their præterite by a change of vowel; as

sink
,
sank
; all the transitives by the addition of
d

or
t
, as
sell
,
sell'd
.

III. Verbs derived from nouns by a change of accent; as
to
survéy
, from a
súrvey
.

[209]

Walker attributes the change of accent to the influence of the
participial termination
-ing
. All words thus affected are of
foreign origin.

IV. Verbs formed from nouns by changing a final
sharp
consonant
into its corresponding
flat
one; as,

The
use
to
use,
pronounced
uze.

The
breath
to
breathe
—
breadhe.

The
cloth
to
clothe
—
clodhe.

[210]

CHAPTER XIX.

ON THE PERSONS.

§ 283
. Compared with the Latin, the Greek, the
Mœso-Gothic, and almost all the ancient languages, there is, in
English, in respect to the persons of the verbs, but a very slight amount
of inflection. This may be seen by comparing the English word
call

with the Latin
voco
.

Sing.
Plur.
Sing.
Plur.

1.
Voc-
o
Voc-
amus
.
Call
Call.

2.
Voc-
as
Voc-
atis
.
Call-est
Call.

3.
Voc-
at
Voc-
ant
.
Call-eth
[52]
Call.

Here the Latins have different forms for each different person, whilst
the English have forms for two only; and even of these one
(
callest
) is becoming obsolete. With the forms voc-
o
,
voc-
amus
, voc-
atis
, voc-
ant
, there is, in the
current English, nothing correspondent.

In the word
am
, as compared with
are
and
art
, we
find a sign of the first person singular.

In the old forms
tellen
,
weren
, &c., we have a sign
of the plural number.

§ 284
. In the Modern English, the Old English,
and the Anglo-Saxon, the peculiarities of our personal inflections are
very great. This may be seen from the following tables of
comparison:—

[211]

Present Tense, Indicative Mood.

§ 285
. Herein remark; 1. the Anglo-Saxon
addition of
t
in the second person singular; 2. the identity in
form of the three persons of the plural number; 3. the change of

-að
into
-en
in the Old English plural; 4. the total
absence of plural forms in the Modern English; 5. the change of the

th
into
s
, in
loveth
and
loves
. These are
points bearing especially upon the history of the English
[212]
persons. The
following points indicate a more general question:

1. The full form
prennames
in the newer Old High German, as
compared with
sôkjam
in the
old
Mœso-Gothic.

2. The appearance of the
r
in Icelandic.

3. The difference between the Old Saxon and the Anglo-Saxon in the
second person singular; the final
t
being absent in Old Saxon.

§ 286
.
The person in -t.
—The forms

art
,
wast
,
wert
,
shalt
,
wilt
, or

ar-t
,
was-t
,
wer-t
,
shal-t
,
wil-t
, are
remarkable. Here the second person singular ends, not in
-st
, but
in
t
. The reason for this is to be sought in the Mœso-Gothic
and the Icelandic.

In those languages the form of the person changes with the tense, and
the second singular of the præterite tense of one conjugation is, not

-s
, but
-t
; as Mœso-Gothic,
svôr
=
I
swore
,
svôrt
=
thou swarest
,
gráip
=
I
griped
,
gráipt
=
thou gripedst
; Icelandic,

brannt
=
thou burnest
,
gaft
=
thou gavest
. In
the same languages ten verbs are conjugated like præterites. Of these, in
each language,
skal
is one.

Mœso-Gothic.

Singular.
Dual.
Plural.

1.
Skal
Skulu

2.
Skalt

3.

§ 287
.
Thou spakest
,
thou brakest
,

thou sungest
.
[53]
—

[213]

In these forms there is a slight though natural anomaly. They belong
to the class of verbs which form their præterite by changing the vowel of
the present; as
sing
,
sang
, &c. Now, all words of this
sort in Anglo-Saxon formed their second singular præterite, not in

-st
, but in
-e
; as
þú funde
=
thou foundest
,

þú sunge
=
thou sungest
. The English termination is derived
from the present. Observe that this applies only to the præterites formed
by changing the vowel.
Thou loved'st
is Anglo-Saxon as well as
English,
viz.
,
þú lufodest
.

§ 288
. In the northern dialects of the
Anglo-Saxon the
-ð
of plurals like
lufiað
=
we love

becomes
-s
. In the Scottish this change was still more
prevalent:

The Scottes come that to this day

Havys
and Scotland haldyn ay.—Wintoun, 11, 9, 73.

James I. of England ends nearly all his plurals in
-s
.

[214]

CHAPTER XX.

ON THE NUMBERS OF VERBS.

§ 289
. As compared with the present plural
forms,
we love
,
ye love
,
they love
, the Anglo-Saxons
had the truly plural forms,
we lufiað
,
ge lufiað
,
hi
lufiað
. The Old English also had a true plural inflection
we
loven
,
ye loven
,
they loven
. The present English wants
both the form in
-en
, and the form in
-að
. In other words,
the Anglo-Saxon and the Old English have a plural
personal

characteristic, whilst the Modern English has nothing to correspond with
it.

§ 290
. In the forms
luf-iað
, and

lov-en
, the change from singular to plural is made by adding a
syllable; but there is no reason against the inflection running
thus—
I love
,
thou lovest
,
he loves
;
we
lave
,
ye lave
,
they lave
; in other words, there is no
reason against the
vowel
of the root being changed, just as is the
case with the form
speak, spoke
;
fall, fell
.

Now, in Anglo-Saxon, with a great number of verbs such a plural
inflection not only actually takes place, but takes place most regularly.
It takes place, however, in the past tense only. And this is the case in
all the Gothic languages as well as in Anglo-Saxon. Amongst the rest,
in—
[215]

Mœso-Gothic.

Skáin,
I shone
; skinum,
we shone
.

Gab,
I gave
; gêbum,
we gave
.

Smáit,
I smote
; smitum,
we smote
.

At,
I ete
; étum,
we ete
.

Káus,
I chose
; kusum,
we chose
.

Stal,
I stole
; stélum,
we stole
.

Láug,
I lied
; lugum,
we lied
.

Qvam,
I came
; qyêmum,
we came
.

Anglo-Saxon.

Arn,
I ran
; urnon,
we run
.

Dranc,
I drank
; druncon,
we drunk
.

Ongan,
I began
; ongunnon,
we begun
.

Sanc,
I sank
; suncon,
we sunk
.

Span,
I span
; spunnon,
we spun
.

Sprang,
I sprang
; sprungon,
we sprung
.

Sang,
I sang
; sungon,
we sung
.

Swam,
I swam
; swummon,
we swum
.

Swang,
I swang
;
swungon
,
we swung
.

Rang,
I rang
; rungon,
we rung
.

From these examples the reader has himself drawn his inference;

viz.
that words like

Began
,
begun
.

Sank
,
sunk
.

Ran
,
run
.

Swam
,
swum
.

Span
,
spun
.

Rang
,
rung
.

Sang
,
sung
.

Bat
,
bit
.

Swang
,
swung
.

Smote
,
smit
.

Sprang
,
sprung
.

Drank
,
drunk
,
&c.
,

generally called double forms of the past tense, were originally

different numbers of the same tense
, the forms in
a
, as

swam
, being singular, and the forms in
u
, as
swum
,
plural.

[216]

CHAPTER XXI.

ON MOODS.

§ 291
. The Anglo-Saxon infinitive has already
been considered.

Between the second plural imperative, and the second plural
indicative,
speak ye
, and
ye speak
, there is no difference
of form.

Between the second singular imperative
speak
, and the second
singular indicative,
speakest
, there is a difference in form.

Still, as the imperative form
speak
is distinguished from the
indicative form
speakest
by the
negation
of a character
rather than by the possession of one, it cannot be said that there is in
English any imperative mood.

§ 292
.
If he speak
, as opposed to
if
he speaks
, is characterized by a negative sign only, and consequently
is no true example of a subjunctive.
Be
, as opposed to
am
,
in the sentence
if it be so
, is a fresh word used in a limited
sense, and consequently no true example of a subjunctive. It is a
different word altogether, and is only the subjunctive of
am
, in
the way
puss
is the vocative of
cat
.

The only true subjunctive inflection in the English language is that
of
were
and
wert
, as opposed to the indicative forms

was
and
wast
.

Indicative.
Subjunctive.

[217]

CHAPTER XXII.

ON TENSES IN GENERAL.

§ 293
. The nature of tenses in general is best
exhibited by reference to the Greek; since in that language they are more
numerous, and more strongly marked than elsewhere.

I strike
,
I struck
.—Of these words, the first
implies an action taking place at the time of speaking, the second marks
an action that has already taken place.

These two notions of present and of past time, being expressed by a
change of form, are true tenses. If there were no change of form, there
would be no change of tense. They are the only true tenses in our
language. In
I was beating
,
I have beaten
,
I had
beaten
, and
I shall beat
, a difference of time is expressed;
but as it is expressed by
a combination of words
, and not
by a
change of form
, no true tenses are constituted.

§ 294
. In Greek the case is different.
Τύπτω
(typtô) =

I beat
;
ἔτυπτον
(etypton) =
I was
beating
;
τύψω
(typsô) =
I shall beat
;
ἔτυψα

(etypsa) =
I beat
;
τέτυφα
(tetyfa) =
I have
beaten
;
ἐτετύφειν

(etetyfein) =
I had beaten
. In these words we have, of the same
mood, the same voice, and the same conjugation, six different tenses;
whereas, in English, there are but two. The forms
τέτυφα
and
ἔτυψα
are so strongly marked, that
we recognise them wheresoever they occur. The first is formed by a
reduplication of the initial
τ
, and,
consequently, may
[218]
be called the reduplicate form. As a tense
it is called the perfect. In the form
ἔτυψα
an
ε
is prefixed, and an
σ
is added. In the allied language of Italy the

ε
disappears, whilst the
σ
(
s
) remains.
Ἔτυψα
is said to be an aorist tense.

Scripsi
is to
scribo
as
ἔτυψα
is to
τύπτω
.

§ 295
. Now in the Latin language a confusion
takes place between these two tenses. Both forms exist. They are used,
however, indiscriminately. The aorist form has, besides its own, the
sense of the perfect. The perfect has, besides its own, the sense of the
aorist. In the following pair of quotations,
vixi
, the aorist
form, is translated
I have lived
, while
tetigit
, the
perfect form, is translated
he touched
.

Vixi
, et quem dederat cursum Fortuna peregi;

Et nunc magna mei sub terras ibis imago.—
Æn.
iv.

Ut primum alatis
tetigit
magalia plantis.—
Æn.
iv.

§ 296
. When a difference of form has ceased to
express a difference of meaning, it has become superfluous. This is the
case with the two forms in question. One of them may be dispensed with;
and the consequence is, that, although in the Latin language both the
perfect and the aorist forms are found, they are, with few exceptions,
never found in the same word. Wherever there is the perfect, the aorist
is wanting, and
vice versâ
. The two ideas
I have struck
and

I struck
are merged into the notion of past time in general, and
are expressed by one of two forms, sometimes by that of the Greek
perfect, and sometimes by that of the Greek aorist. On account of this
the grammarians have cut down the number of Latin tenses to
five
;
forms like
cucurri
and
vixi
being dealt with as one and the
same tense. The true view is, that in
curro
the aorist form is
replaced by the perfect, and in
vixi
the perfect form is replaced
by the aorist.
[219]

§ 297
. In the
present
English there is no
undoubted perfect or reduplicate form. The form
moved
corresponds
in meaning not with
τέτυφα
and
momordi
, but
with
ἔτυψα
and
vixi
. Its sense is
that of
ἔτυψα
, and not that of
τέτυφα
. The notion given by

τέτυφα
we express by the
circumlocution
I have beaten
. We have no such form as

bebeat
or
memove
. In the Mœso-Gothic, however, there
was a true reduplicate form; in other words, a perfect tense as well as
an aorist. It is by the possession of this form that the verbs of the
first six conjugations are characterized.

In Mœso-Gothic, as in Latin, the perfect forms have, besides
their own, an aorist sense, and
vice versâ
.

In Mœso-Gothic, as in Latin, few (if any) words are found in
both forms.

In Mœso-Gothic, as in Latin, the two forms are dealt with as a
single tense;
láilô
being called the præterite of
láia
, and

svôr
the præterite of
svara
. The true view, however, is
that in Mœso-Gothic, as in Latin, there are two past tenses, each
having a certain latitude of meaning, and each, in certain words,
replacing the other.

The reduplicate form, in other words, the perfect tense, is current in
none of the Gothic languages except the
[220]
Mœso-Gothic. A
trace of it is said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon of the seventh century
in the word
heht
, which is considered to be
hê-ht
, the
Mœso-Gothic
háiháit
,
vocavi
.
Did
from

do
is also considered to be a reduplicate form.

§ 298
. In the English language the tense
corresponding with the Greek aorist and the Latin forms like
vixi
,
is formed after two modes; 1, as in
fell
,
sang
, and

took
, from
fall
,
sing
, and
take
, by changing
the vowel of the present: 2, as in
moved
and
wept
, from

move
and
weep
, by the addition of
-d
or
-t
;
the
-d
or
-t
not being found in the original word, but
being a fresh element added to it. In forms, on the contrary, like

sang
and
fell
, no addition being made, no new element
appears. The vowel, indeed, is changed, but nothing is added. Verbs,
then, of the first sort, may be said to form their præterites out of
themselves; whilst verbs of the second sort require something from
without. To speak in a metaphor, words like
sang
and
fell

are comparatively independent. Be this as it may, the German grammarians
call the tenses formed by a change of vowel the
strong
tenses, the

strong
verbs, the
strong
conjugation, or the
strong

order; and those formed by the addition of
d
or
t
, the

weak
tenses, the
weak
verbs, the
weak
conjugation,
or the
weak
order.
Bound
,
spoke
,
gave
,

lay
, &c., are
strong
;
moved
,
favoured
,

instructed
, &c., are
weak
.

[221]

CHAPTER XXIII.

THE STRONG TENSES.

§ 299
. The strong præterites are formed from the
present by changing the vowel, as
sing
,
sang
;
speak
,

spoke
.

In Anglo-Saxon, several præterites change, in their plural, the vowel
of their singular; as

Ic s
a
ng,
I sang
.
We s
u
ngon,
we sung
.

þu s
u
nge,
thou sungest
.
Ge s
u
ngon,
ye sung
.

He s
a
ng,
he sang
.
Hi s
u
ngon,
they sung
.

The bearing of this fact upon the præterites has already been
indicated. In a great number of words we have a double form, as

ran
and
run
,
sang
and
sung
,
drank
and

drunk
, &c. One of these forms is derived from the singular,
and the other from the plural.

In cases where but one form is preserved, that form is not necessarily
the singular; indeed, it is often the plural;—
e.g.
, Ic
f
a
nd,
I found
, we f
u
ndon,
we found
, are the
Anglo-Saxon forms. Now the present word
found
comes, not from the
singular
fand
, but from the plural
fundon
; although in the
Lowland Scotch dialect and in the old writers, the
singular
form
occurs;

Donald Caird finds orra things,

Where Allan Gregor
fand
the tings.—
Scott.

[222]

§ 300
. The verbs wherein the double form of the
present præterite is thus explained, fall into two classes.

1. In the first class, the Anglo-Saxon forms were
á
in the
singular, and
i
in the plural; as—

Sing.
Plur.

Sceán
Scinon (
we shone
).

Arás
Arison (
we arose
).

Smát
Smiton (
we smote
).

This accounts for—

§ 301

(but not

always
) is from the Anglo-Saxon

, the secondary

præterite
.

[225]

§ 303
. An arrangement of the preceding verbs
into classes, according to the change of vowel, is by no means difficult,
even in the present stage of the English language. In the Anglo-Saxon, it
was easier still. It is also easier in the provincial dialects, than in
the literary English. Thus, when

Break
is pronounced
Breek
,

Bear
—
Beer
,

Tear
—
Teer
,

Swear
—
Sweer
,

Wear
—
Weer
,

as they actually are by many speakers, they come in the same class
with,—

Speak
pronounced
Speek
,

Cleave
—
Cleeve
,

and form their præterite by means of a similar change,
i.e.
, by
changing the sound of the
ee
in
feet
(spelt
ea
) into
that of the
a
in
fate
; viewed thus, the irregularity is
less than it appears to be at first sight.

Again,
tread
is pronounced
tredd
, but many provincial
speakers say
treed
, and so said the Anglo-Saxons, whose form was

ic trede
=
I tread
. Their præterite was
træd
. This
again subtracts from the apparent irregularity.

Instances of this kind may be multiplied; the whole question, however,
of the conjugation of the
strong verbs
is best considered after
the perusal of the next chapter.

[226]

CHAPTER XXIV.

THE WEAK TENSES.

§ 304
. The præterite tense of the weak verbs is
formed by the addition of
-d
or
-t
.

If necessary, the syllable
-ed
is substituted for

-d
.

The current statement that the syllable
-ed
, rather than the
letter
-d
is the sign of the præterite tense, is true only in
regard to the written language. In
stabbed
,
moved
,

bragged
,
whizzed
,
judged
,
filled
,

slurred
,
slammed
,
shunned
,
barred
,

strewed
, the
e
is a point of spelling only. In

language
, except in declamation, there is no second vowel sound.
The
-d
comes in immediate contact with the final letter of the
original word, and the number of syllables remains the same as it was
before. We say
stabd
,
môved
,
bragd
, &c.

§ 305
. When, however, the original word ends in

-d
or
-t
, as
slight
or
brand
, then, and then
only is there the real addition of the syllable
-ed
; as in

slighted
,
branded
.

This is necessary, since the combinations
slightt
and

brandd
are unpronounceable.

Whether the addition be
-d
or
-t
depends upon the
flatness or sharpness of the preceding letter.

After
b
,
v
,
th
(as in
clothe
),
g
,
or
z
, the addition is
-d
. This is a matter of necessity. We
say
stabd
,
môvd
,
clôthd
,
braggd
,

whizzd
, because
stabt
,
môvt
,
clotht
,

braggt
,
whizzt
, are unpronounceable.

After
l
,
m
,
n
,
r
,
w
,
y
, or a
vowel, the addition is also
[227]
-d
. This is the
habit
of the
English language.
Filt
,
slurt
,
strayt
, &c., are
as pronounceable as
filld
,
slurrd
,
strayd
, &c.
It is the habit, however, of the English language to prefer the latter
forms.

All this, as the reader has probably observed, is merely the reasoning
concerning the
s
, in words like
father's
, &c., applied
to another letter and to another part of speech.

§ 306
. The verbs of the weak conjugation fall
into three classes.

I. In the first there is the simple addition of
-d
,
-t
,
or
-ed
.

Serve, served.
Dip, dipped (
dipt
).

Cry, cried.
Slip, slipped (
slipt
).

Betray, betrayed.
Step, stepped (
stept
).

Expell, expelled.
Look, looked (
lookt
).

Accuse, accused.
Pluck, plucked (
pluckt
).

Instruct, instructed.
Toss, tossed (
tost
).

Invite, invited.
Push, pushed (
pusht
).

Waste, wasted.
Confess, confessed (
confest
).

To this class belong the greater part of the weak verbs and all verbs
of foreign origin.

§ 307
. II. In the second class, besides the
addition of
-t
or
-d
, the vowel is
shortened
,

Present.
Præterite.

Creep
Cr
e
pt.

Keep
K
e
pt.

Sleep
Sl
e
pt.

Sweep
Sw
e
pt.

Weep
W
e
pt.

Lose
L
o
st.

Mean
M
ea
nt.
[57]

[228]

Here the final consonant is
-t
.

Present.
Præterite.

Flee
Fl
e
d.

Hear
H
ea
rd.
[58]

Shoe
Sh
o
d.

Say
S
ai
d.
[59]

Here the final consonant is
-d
.

§ 308
. III. In the second class the vowel of the
present tense was
shortened
in the præterite. In the third class
it is
changed
.

Tell, told.

Sell, sold.

Will, would.

Shall, should.

To this class belong the remarkable præterites of the verbs

seek
,
beseech
,
catch
,
teach
,
bring
,

think
, and
buy
,
viz.
,
sought
,

besought
,
caught
,
taught
,
brought
,

thought
, and
bought
. In all these, the final consonant is
either
g
or
k
, or else a sound allied to those mutes. When
the tendency of these sounds to become
h
and
y
, as well as
to undergo farther changes, is remembered, the forms in point cease to
seem anomalous. In
wrought
, from
work
, there is a
transposition. In
laid
and
said
the present forms make a
show of regularity which they have not. The true original forms should be

legde
and
sægde
, the infinitives being
lecgan
,

secgan
. In these words the
i
represents the semivowel

y
, into which the original
g
was changed. The Anglo-Saxon
forms of the other words are as follows:—

Bycan, bóhte.

Bringan, bróhte.

Sêcan, sóhte.

Þencan, þóhte.

Wyrcan, wórhte.

[229]

§ 309
. Out of the three classes into which the
weak verbs in Anglo-Saxon are divided, only one takes a vowel before the

d
or
t
. The other two add the syllables
-te
or

-de
, to the last letter of the original word. The vowel that, in
one out of the three Anglo-Saxon classes, precedes
d
is
o
.
Thus we have
lufian
,
lufode
;
clypian
,

clypode
. In the other two classes the forms are respectively

bærnan
,
bærnde
; and
tellan
,
tealde
, no vowel
being found. The
participle
, however, as stated above, ended, not
in
-de
or
-te
, but in
-d
or
-t
; and in two
out of the three classes it was preceded by a vowel; the vowel being

e
,—
gelufod
,
bærned
,
geteald
. Now in
those conjugations where no vowel preceded the
d
of the præterite,
and where the original word ended in
-d
or
-t
, a
difficulty, which has already been indicated, arose. To add the sign of
the præterite to a word like
eard-ian
(
to dwell
) was an
easy matter, inasmuch as
eardian
was a word belonging to the first
class, and in the first class the præterite was formed in
-ode
.
Here the vowel
o
kept the two
d
's from coming in contact.
With words, however, like
métan
and
sendan
, this was not
the case. Here no vowel intervened; so that the natural præterite forms
were
met-te
,
send-de
, combinations wherein one of the
letters ran every chance of being dropped in the pronunciation. Hence,
with the exception of the verbs in the first class, words ending in

-d
or
-t
in the root admitted no additional
d
or

t
in the præterite. This difficulty, existing in the present
English as it existed in the Anglo-Saxon, modifies the præterites of most
words ending in
-t
or
-d
.

§ 310
. In several words there is the actual
addition of the syllable
-ed
; in other words
d
is separated
from the last letter of the original word by the addition of a vowel; as

ended
,
instructed
, &c.

§ 311
. In several words the final
-d
is
changed into
-t
,
[230]
as
bend
,
bent
;
rend
,

rent
;
send
,
sent
;
gild
,
gilt
;

build
,
built
;
spend
,
spent
, &c.

§ 312
. In several words the vowel of the root is
changed; as
feed
,
fed
;
bleed
,
bled
;

breed
,
bred
;
meet
,
met
;
speed
,

sped
;
rēad
,
rĕad
, &c. Words of this
last-named class cause occasional difficulty to the grammarian. No
addition is made to the root, and, in this circumstance, they agree with
the strong verbs. Moreover, there is a change of the vowel. In this
circumstance also they agree with the strong verbs. Hence with forms like

fed
and
led
we are in doubt as to the conjugation. This
doubt we have three means of settling, as may be shown by the word

beat
.

a.

By the form of the participle.
—The
-en

in
beaten
shows that the word
beat
is strong.

b.

By the nature of the vowel.
—The weak form of

to beat
would be
bet
, or
beăt
, after the
analogy of
feed
and
read
. By some persons the word is
pronounced
bet
, and with those who do so the word is weak.

c.

By a knowledge of the older forms.
—The
Anglo-Saxon form is
beáte
,
beot
. There is no such a weak
form as
beáte
,
bætte
. The præterite of
sendan
is

sende
weak. There is in Anglo-Saxon no such form as
sand
,
strong.

In all this we see a series of expedients for distinguishing the
præterite form from the present, when the root ends with the same sound
with which the affix begins.

The change from a long vowel to a short one, as in
feed
,

fed
, &c., can only take place where there is a long vowel to
be changed.

Where the vowels are short, and, at the same time, the word ends in

-d
, the
-d
of the present may become
-t
in the
præterite. Such is the case with
bend
,
bent
.

When there is no long vowel to shorten, and no
-d

[231]
to change into

-t
, the two tenses, of necessity, remain alike; such is the case
with
cut
,
cost
, &c.

§ 313
. The following verbs form their præterite
in
-t
:—

Present.
Præterite.

Leave
Lef

§ 314
. Certain
so-called
irregularities
may now be noticed.—
Made
,
had
.—In these words
there is nothing remarkable but the ejection of a consonant. The
Anglo-Saxon forms are
macode
and
hæfde
, respectively. The
words, however, in regard to the amount of change, are not upon a

par
. The
f
in
hæfde
was probably sounded as

v
. Now
v
is a letter excessively liable to be ejected,
which
k
is not.
K
, before it is ejected, is generally
changed into either
g
or
y
.

Would
,
should
,
could
.—It must not be
imagined that
could
is in the same predicament with these words.
In
will
and
shall
the
-l
is part of the original
word. This is not the case with
can
. For the form
could
,
see §
331
.

§ 315
.
Aught
.—In Anglo-Saxon

áhte
, the præterite of the present form
áh
, plural

ágon
.—As late as the time of Elizabeth we find
owe

used for
own
. The present form
own
seems to have arisen
from the plural
ágon
.
Aught
is the præterite of the
Anglo-Saxon
áh
;
owed
of the English
owe
=

debeo
;
owned
of the English
own
=
[232]
possideo
. The word
own
, in
the expression
to own to a thing
, has a totally different origin.
It comes from the Anglo-Saxon
an
(plural,
unnon
) =
I
give
, or
grant
=
concedo
.

§ 316
.
Durst
.—The verb
dare

is both transitive and intransitive. We can say either
I dare do such
a thing
, or
I dare (challenge) such a man to do it
. This, in
the present tense, is unequivocally correct. In the past the double power
of the word
dare
is ambiguous; still it is, to my mind at least,
allowable. We can certainly say
I dared him to accept my
challenge
; and we can, perhaps, say
I dared venture on the
expedition
. In this last sentence, however,
durst
is the
preferable expression.

Now, although
dare
is both transitive and intransitive,

durst
is only intransitive. It never agrees with the Latin word

provoco
; only with the Latin word
audeo
. Moreover, the word

durst
has both a present and a past sense. The difficulty which it
presents consists in the presence of the
-st
, letters
characteristic of the second person singular, but here found in all the
persons alike; as
I durst
,
they durst
, &c.

This has still to be satisfactorily accounted for.

Must
.—A form common to all persons, numbers, and tenses.
That neither the
-s
nor the
-t
are part of the original
root, is indicated by the Scandinavian form
maae
(Danish),
pronounced
moh
; præterite
maatt
.

This form has still to be satisfactorily accounted for.

Wist
.—In its present form a regular præterite from

wiss
=
know
. The difficulties of this word arise from the
parallel forms
wit
(as in
to wit
), and
wot
=

knew
. The following are the forms of this peculiar
word:—

In Mœso-Gothic, 1 sing. pres. ind.
váit
; 2. do.,
[233]
váist
; 1 pl.
vitum
;
præterite 1 s.
vissa
; 2
vissêss
; 1 pl.
vissêdum
.
From the form
váist
we see that the second singular is formed
after the manner of
must
; that is,
váist
stands instead of

váit-t
. From the form
vissêdum
we see that the præterite is
not strong, but weak; therefore that
vissa
is euphonic for

vista
.

In Anglo-Saxon.—
Wât
,
wást
,
witon
,

wiste
, and
wisse
,
wiston
.—Hence the double
forms,
wiste
, and
wisse
, verify the statement concerning
the Mœso-Gothic
vissa
.

In Icelandic.—
Veit
,
veizt
,
vitum
,

vissi
. Danish
ved
,
vide
,
vidste
. Observe the
form
vidste
; since, in it, the
d
of the root (in spelling,
at least) is preserved. The
t
of the Anglo-Saxon
wiste
is
the
t
, not of the root, but of the inflection.

In respect to the four forms in question,
viz.
,
wit
,

wot
,
wiss
,
wisst
, the first seems to be the root;
the second a strong præterite regularly formed, but used (like
οἶδα
in Greek)
with a present sense; the third a weak præterite, of which the
-t

has been ejected by a euphonic process, used also with a present sense;
the fourth is a second singular from
wiss
after the manner of

wert
from
were
, a second singular from
wit
after the
manner of
must
, a secondary præterite from
wiss
, or
finally, the form
wisse
, anterior to the operation of the euphonic
process that ejected the
-t
.

§ 317
. In the phrase
this will do
=

this will answer the purpose
, the word
do
is wholly
different from the word
do
, meaning
to act
. In the first
case it is equivalent to the Latin
valere
; in the second to the
Latin
facere
. Of the first the Anglo-Saxon inflection is

deáh
,
dugon
,
dohte
,
dohtest
, &c. Of the
second it is
dó
,
doð
,
dyde
, &c. I doubt whether
the præterite
did
, as equivalent to
valebat
=
was good
for
, is correct. In the phrase
it did for him
=
it finished
him
, either meaning may be allowed.
[234]

In the present Danish they write
duger
, but say
duer
: as

duger et noget?
=
Is it worth anything?
pronounced
dooer
deh note?
This accounts for the ejection of the
g
. The
Anglo-Saxon form
deáh
does the same.

§ 318
.
Mind—mind and do so and
so
.—In this sentence the word
mind
is wholly different
from the noun
mind
. The Anglo-Saxon forms are
geman
,

gemanst
,
gemunon
, without the
-d
; this letter
occurring only in the præterite tense (
gemunde
,
gemundon
),
of which it is the sign.
Mind
is, then, a præterite form with a
present sense; whilst
minded
(as in
he minded his business
)
is an instance of excess of inflection; in other words, it is a præterite
formed from a præterite.

§ 319
.
Yode
.—The obsolete præterite
of
go
, now replaced by
went
, the præterite of
wend
.
Regular, except that the initial
g
has become
y
.

§ 320
.
Did
.—See §
317
.

Did
, from
do
=
facio
, is a
strong
verb.
This we infer from the form of its participle
done
.

If so the final
-d
is not the same as the
-d
in

moved
. What is it? There are good grounds for believing that in
the word
did
we have a single instance of the old
reduplicate
præterite
. If so, it is the latter
d
which is radical, and the
former which is inflectional.

[235]

§ 321
. Attention is directed to the following
list of verbs. In the present English they all form the præterite in

the vowel. In other words they are

§ 322
. Respecting the
strong
verb, the
following general statements may be made:

1. Many strong verbs become weak; whilst no weak verb ever becomes
strong.

2. All the strong verbs are of Saxon origin. None are classical.
[237]

3. The greater number of them are strong throughout the Gothic
tongues.

4. No new word is ever, upon its importation, inflected according to
the strong conjugation. It is always weak. As
early
as
A.D.
1085, the French word
adouber
=
to
dub
, was introduced into English. Its præterite was

dubbade
.

5. All derived words are inflected weak. The intransitive forms

drink
and
lie
, are strong; the transitive forms

drench
and
lay
, are weak.

This shows that the division of verbs into
weak
and

strong
is a truly natural one.

[238]

CHAPTER XXVI.

DEFECTIVENESS AND IRREGULARITY.

§ 323
. The distinction between irregularity and
defectiveness has been foreshadowed. It is now more urgently insisted
on.

The words that have hitherto served as illustrations are the personal
pronouns
I
or
me
, the adjectives
good
,

better
, and
best
.

The view of these words was as follows;
viz.
, that none of them
were
irregular
, but that they were all
defective
.
Me

wanted the nominative,
I
the oblique cases.
Good
was
without a comparative,
better
and
best
had no positive
degree.

Now
me
and
better
may be said to make good the
defectiveness of
I
and
good
; and
I
and
good

may be said to replace the forms wanting in
me
and
better
.
This gives us the principle of
compensation
. To introduce a new
term,
I
and
me
,
good
and
better
, may be said
to be
complementary
to each other.

What applies to nouns applies to verbs also.
Go
and
went

are not irregularities.
Go
is defective in the past tense.

Went
is without a present. The two words, however, compensate
their mutual deficiencies, and are complementary to each other.

The distinction between defectiveness and irregularity, is the first
instrument of criticism for coming to true
[239]
views concerning the
proportion of the regular and irregular verbs.

§ 324
. The second instrument of criticism in
determining the irregular verbs, is the meaning that we attach to the
term.

It is very evident that it is in the power of the grammarian to raise
the number of etymological irregularities to any amount, by narrowing the
definition of the word
irregular
; in other words, by framing an
exclusive rule. The current rule of the common grammarians
is
that the
præterite is formed
by the addition of

-t
, or
-d
, or

-ed
; a position sufficiently exclusive; since it proscribes not
only the whole class of strong verbs, but also words like
bent
and

sent
, where
-t
exists, but where it does not exist as
an
addition
. The regular forms, it may be said, should be
bended

and
sended
.

Exclusive, however, as the rule in question is, it is plain that it
might be made more so. The regular forms might, by the
fiat
of a
rule, be restricted to those in
-d
. In this case words like

wept
and
burnt
would be added to the already numerous list
of irregulars.

Finally, a further limitation might be made, by laying down as a rule
that no word was regular, unless it ended in
-ed
.

§ 325
. Thus much concerning the modes of making
rules exclusive, and, consequently, of raising the amount of
irregularities. This is the last art that the philosophic grammarian is
ambitious of acquiring. True etymology
reduces
irregularity; and
that by making the rules of grammar, not exclusive, but general.
The
quantum of irregularity is in the inverse proportion to the generality of
our rules.
In language itself there is no irregularity. The word
itself is only another name for our ignorance of the processes that
change words; and, as irregularity
[240]
is in the direct
proportion to the exclusiveness of our rules, the exclusiveness of our
rules is in the direct proportion to our ignorance of etymological
processes.

§ 326
. The explanation of some fresh terms will
lead us towards the definition of the word
irregular
.

Vital and obsolete processes.
—The word
moved
is
formed from
move
, by the addition of
-d
. The addition of

-d
is the process by which the present form is rendered præterite.
The word
fell
is formed from
fall
, by changing
a

into
e
. The change of vowel is the process by which the present
form is rendered præterite. Of the two processes the result is the same.
In what respect do they differ?

For the sake of illustration, let a new word be introduced into the
language. Let a præterite tense of it be formed. This præterite would be
formed, not by changing the vowel, but by adding
-d
. No
new

verb ever takes a strong præterite. The like takes place with nouns. No

new
substantive would form its plural, like
oxen
or

geese
, by adding
-en
, or by changing the vowel. It would
rather, like
fathers
and
horses
, add the lene sibilant.

Now, the processes that change
fall
,
ox
and
goose

into
fell
,
oxen
, and
geese
, inasmuch as they cease
to operate on the language in its present stage, are
obsolete

processes; whilst those that change
move
into
moved
, and

horse
into
horses
, operating on the language in its present
stage, are
vital
processes.

A definition of the word
irregular
might be so framed as to
include all words whose forms could not be accounted for by the vital
processes. Such a definition would make all the strong verbs
irregular.

The very fact of so natural a class as that of the strong
[241]
verbs
being reduced to the condition of irregulars, invalidates such a
definition as this.

§ 327
.
Processes of necessity as opposed to
processes of habit.
—The combinations
-pd
,
-fd
,

-kd
,
-sd
, and some others, are unpronounceable. Hence words
like
step
,
quaff
,
back
,
kiss
, &c., take
after them the sound of
-t
;
stept
,
quafft
, &c.,
being their præterites, instead of
stepd
,
quaffd
. Here the
change from
-d
to
-t
is a matter of necessity. It is not so
with words like
weep
, and
wept
, &c. Here the change of
vowel is not necessary.
Weept
might have been said if the habit of
the language had permitted.

A definition of the word
irregular
might be so framed as to
include all words whose natural form was modified by any euphonic process
whatever. In this case
stept
(modified by a process of necessity),
and
wept
(modified by a process of habit), would be equally
irregular.

A less limited definition might account words regular as long as the
process by which they are deflected from their natural form was a process
of necessity. Those, however, which were modified by a process of habit
it would class with the irregulars.

Definitions thus limited arise from ignorance of euphonic processes,
or rather from an ignorance of the generality of their operation.

§ 328
.
Ordinary processes as opposed to
extraordinary processes.
—The whole scheme of language is
analogical. A new word introduced into a language takes the forms of its
cases or tenses, &c., from the forms of the cases or tenses, &c.,
of the old words. The analogy is extended. Now few forms (if any) are so
unique as not to have some others corresponding with them; and few
processes of change are so unique as not to affect more words than one.
The forms
wept
, and
slept
, correspond
[242]
with each
other. They are brought about by the same process:
viz.
, by the
shortening of the vowel in
weep
and
sleep
. The analogy of

weep
is extended to
sleep
, and
vice versâ
. Changing
our expression, a common influence affects both words. The alteration
itself is the leading fact. The extent of its influence is an instrument
of classification. When processes affect a considerable number of words,
they may be called
ordinary
processes; as opposed to

extraordinary
processes, which affect one or few words.

When a word stands by itself, with no other corresponding to it, we
confess our ignorance, and say that it is affected by an extraordinary
process, by a process peculiar to itself, or by a process to which we
know nothing similar.

A definition of the word
irregular
might be so framed as to
include all words affected by extraordinary processes; the rest being
considered regular.

§ 329
.
Positive processes as opposed to
ambiguous processes.
—The words
wept
and
slept
are
similarly affected. Each is changed from
weep
and
sleep

respectively; and we know that the process which affects the one is the
process that affects the other also. Here there is a positive
process.

Reference is now made to words of a different sort. The nature of the
word
worse
has been explained in the Chapter on the Comparative
Degree. There the form is accounted for in two ways, of which only one
can be the true one. Of the two processes, each might equally have
brought about the present form. Which of the two it was, we are unable to
say. Here the process is
ambiguous
.

A definition of the word
irregular
might be so framed as to
include all words affected by ambiguous processes.

§ 330
.
Normal processes as opposed to
processes of
[243]
confusion.
—Let a certain word
come under class A. Let all words under class A be similarly affected.
Let a given word come under class A. This word will be affected even as
the rest of class A is affected. The process affecting, and the change
resulting, will be normal, regular, or analogical.

Let, however, a word, instead of really coming under class A, only

appear
to do so. Let it be dealt with accordingly. The analogy
then is a false one. The principle of imitation is a wrong one. The
process affecting is a process of confusion.

Examples of this (a few amongst many) are words like

songstress
,
theirs
,
minded
, where the words

songstr-
,
their-
,
mind-
, are dealt with as roots,
which they are not.

Ambiguous processes, extraordinary processes, processes of
confusion—each, or all of these, are legitimate reasons for calling
words irregular. The practice of etymologists will determine what
definition is most convenient.

With extraordinary processes we know nothing about the word. With
ambiguous processes we are unable to make a choice. With processes of
confusion we see the analogy, but, at the same time, see that it is a
false one.

§ 331
.
Could
.—With all persons who
pronounce the
l
this word is truly irregular. The Anglo-Saxon form
is
cuðe
. The
l
is inserted by a process of confusion.

Can
,
cunne
,
canst
,
cunnon
,
cunnan
,

cuðe
,
cuðon
,
cuð
—such are the remaining forms
in Anglo-Saxon. None of them account for the
l
. The presence of
the
l
makes the word
could
irregular. No reference to the
allied languages accounts for it.

Notwithstanding this, the presence of the
l
is accounted for.
In
would
and
should
the
l
has a proper
[244]
place. It is
part of the original words,
will
and
shall
. A false analogy
looked upon
could
in the same light. Hence a true irregularity;

provided that the
L
be
pronounced
.

The
L
, however, is pronounced by few, and
that only in pursuance with the spelling. This reduces the word

could
to an irregularity, not of language, but only of
orthography.

That the mere ejection of the
-n
in
can
, and that the
mere lengthening of the vowel, are not irregularities, we learn from a
knowledge of the processes that convert the Greek
ὀδόντος

(
odontos
) into
ὀδούς
(
odows
).

§ 332
. The verb
quoth
is truly defective.
It is found in only one tense, one number, and one person. It is the
third person singular of the præterite tense. It has the further
peculiarity of preceding its pronoun. Instead of saying
he quoth
,
we say
quoth he
. In Anglo-Saxon, however, it was not defective. It
was found in the other tenses, in the other number, and in other moods.

Ic cweðe
,
þú cwyst
,
he cwyð
;
ic cwæð
,
þú
cwæðe
,
he cwæð
,
we cwædon
,
ge cwædon
,
hi
cwædon
; imperative,
cweð
; participle,
gecweden
. In the
Scandinavian it is current in all its forms. There, however, it means,
not
to speak
but to
sing
. As far as its conjugation goes,
it is strong. As far as its class goes, it follows the form of

speak
,
spoke
. Like
speak
, its Anglo-Saxon form is in

æ
, as
cwæð
. Like one of the forms of
speak
, its
English form is in
o
, as
quoth
,
spoke
.

§ 333
. The principle that gives us the truest
views of the structure of language is that which considers no word
irregular unless it be affected by either an
ambiguous
process, or
by a
process of confusion
. The words affected by
extraordinary
processes
form a provisional class, which a future increase of our
etymological
[245]
knowledge may show to be regular.

Worse
and
could
are the fairest specimens of our
irregulars. Yet even
could
is only an irregularity in the written
language. The printer makes it, and the printer can take it away. Hence
the class, instead of filling pages, is exceedingly limited.

[246]

CHAPTER XXVII.

THE IMPERSONAL VERBS.

§ 334
. In
me-seems
, and
me-thinks
,
the
me
is dative rather than accusative, and =
mihi
and

μοι
rather than

me
and
με
.

§ 335
. In
me-listeth
, the
me
is
accusative rather than dative, and =
me
and
με
rather than
mihi
and
μοι
.

For the explanation of this difference see
Syntax
, Chapter
XXI.

[247]

CHAPTER XXVIII.

THE VERB SUBSTANTIVE.

§ 336
. The verb substantive is generally dealt
with as an
irregular
verb. This is inaccurate. The true notion is
that the idea of
being
or
existing
is expressed by four
different verbs, each of which is defective in some of its parts. The
parts, however, that are wanting in one verb, are made up by the
inflections of one of the others. There is, for example, no præterite of
the verb
am
, and no present of the verb
was
. The absence,
however, of the present form of
was
is made up by the word

am
, and the absence of the præterite form of
am
is made up
by the word
was
.

§ 337
.
Was
is defective, except in the
præterite tense, where it is found both in the indicative and
conjunctive.

Indicative.
Conjunctive.

Sing.
Plur.

1. Was

2. Wast

2. Wert

3. Was

3. Were

In the older stages of the Gothic languages the word had both a full
conjugation and a regular one. In Anglo-Saxon it had an infinitive, a
participle present, and a participle past. In Mœso-Gothic it was
inflected throughout with
-s
; as
visa
,
vas
,

vêsum
,
visans
. In that language it has the power of the
Latin
maneo
=
to
[248]
remain
. The
r
first appears in
the Old High German,
wisu
,
was
,
wârumés
,

wësaner
. In Norse the
s

entirely
disappears, and the
word is inflected with
r
throughout;
vera
,
var
,

vorum
, &c.

§ 338
.
Be
is inflected in Anglo-Saxon
throughout the present tense, both indicative and subjunctive. It is
found also as an infinitive,
beón
; as a gerund,
to beonne
;
and as a participle,
beonde
; in the present English its inflection
is as follows:

Present.

Conjunctive.
Imperative.

Sing.
Plur.

Past. Part.

§ 339
. The line in Milton beginning
If thou
beest he
—(P. L. b. ii.), leads to the notion that the
antiquated form
beest
is not indicative, but conjunctive. Such,
however, is not the case:
byst
in Anglo-Saxon is indicative, the
conjunctive form being
beó
.
And every thing that pretty bin

(Cymbeline).—Here the word
bin
is the conjunctive plural, in
Anglo-Saxon
beón
; so that the words
every thing
are to be
considered equivalent to the plural form
all things
. The phrase in
Latin would stand thus,
quotquot pulchra sint
; in Greek, thus,

ἁ ἂν
κάλα ᾖ
. The
indicative

plural is, in Anglo-Saxon, not
beón
, but
beóð
and

beó
.

§ 340
. In the "Deutsche Grammatik" it is stated
that the Anglo-Saxon forms
beô
,
bist
,
bið
,

beoð
, or
beó
, have not a present but a
future
sense;
that whilst
am
means
I am
,
beó
means
I shall
be
; and that in the older languages it is only where the form

am
is not found that
be
has the power of a present form.
The same root occurs
[249]
in the Slavonic and Lithuanic tongues with
the same power; as,
esmi
=
I am
;
búsu
=
I shall
be
, Lithuanic.
Esmu
=
I am
;
buhshu
=
I shall
be
, Livonic.—
Jesm
=
I am
;
budu
=
I
shall be
, Slavonic.—
Gsem
=
I am
;
budu
=

I shall be
, Bohemian. This, however, proves, not that there is in
Anglo-Saxon a future tense, but that the word
beó
has a future
sense. There is no fresh tense where there is no fresh form.

The following is a specimen of the future power of
beón
in
Anglo-Saxon:—
"Hi ne
beóð
na cílde, soðlice, on domesdæge,
ac
beóð
swa micele menn swa swa hi migton beón gif hi full weoxon
on gewunlicre ylde."
—Ælfric's Homilies. "They
will not
be
children, forsooth, on Domesday, but
will be
as much (so
muckle) men as they might be if they were full grown (waxen) in customary
age."

§ 341
. Now, if we consider the word
beón

like the word
weorðan
(see §
343
) to mean
not so much
to be
as to
become
, we get an element of the
idea of futurity. Things which are
becoming anything
have yet
something further to either do or suffer. Again, from the idea of
futurity we get the idea of contingency, and this explains the
subjunctive power of
be
. In English we often say
may
for

shall
, and the same was done in Anglo-Saxon.

§ 342
.
Am
.—Of this form it should
be stated that the letter
-m
is no part of the original word. It
is the sign of the first person, just as it is in
Greek
, and
several other languages.

It should also be stated, that although the fact be obscured, and
although the changes be insufficiently accounted for, the forms

am
,
art
,
are
, and
is
, are not, like
am

and
was
, parts of different words, but forms of one and the same
word; in other terms, that, although between
am
and
be

there is no etymological connexion,
[250]
there is one between

am
and
is
. This we collect from the comparison of the
Indo-European languages.

[251]

CHAPTER XXIX.

THE PRESENT PARTICIPLE.

§ 344
. The present participle, called also the
active participle and the participle in
-ing
, is formed from the
original word by adding
-ing
; as,
move
,
moving
. In
the older languages the termination was more marked, being
-nd
.
Like the Latin participle in
-ns
, it was originally declined. The
Mœso-Gothic and Old High German forms are
habands
and

hapêntér
=
having
, respectively. The
-s
in the one
language, and the
-êr
in the other, are the signs of the case and
gender. In the Old Saxon and Anglo-Saxon the forms are
-and
and

-ande
; as
bindand
,
bindande
=
binding
. In all
the Norse languages, ancient and modern, the
-d
is preserved. So
it is in the Old Lowland Scotch, and in many of the modern provincial
dialects of England, where
strikand
,
goand
, is said for

striking
,
going
. In Staffordshire, where the
-ing
is
pronounced
-ingg
, there is a fuller sound than that of the current
English. In Old English the form in
-nd
is predominant, in Middle
English the use fluctuates, and in New English the termination

-ing
is universal. In the Scotch of the modern writers we find the
form
-in
.

The rising sun o'er Galston muirs

Wi' glorious light was glintin';

The hares were hirplin' down the furs,

The lav'rocks they were chantin'.—
Burns'

Holy Fair
.

[252]

§ 345
. It has often been remarked that the
participle is used in many languages as a substantive. This is true in
Greek,

Ὁ πράσσων
=
the actor
, when a male.

Ἡ πρασσοῦσα
=
the actor
, when a female.

Τὸ πράττου
=
the active principle of a thing
.

But it is also stated, that, in the English language, the participle
is used as a substantive in a greater degree than elsewhere, and that it
is used in several cases and in both numbers,
e.g.
,

Rising
early is healthy,

There is health
in rising
early.

This is the advantage
of rising
early.

The
risings
in the North, &c.

Some acute remarks of Mr. R. Taylor, in the Introduction to his
edition of Tooke's "Diversions of Purley," modify this view. According to
these, the
-ing
in words like
rising
is not the
-ing

of the present participle; neither has it originated in the Anglo-Saxon

-end
. It is rather the
-ing
in words like
morning
;
which is anything but a participle of the non-existent verb
morn
,
and which has originated in the Anglo-Saxon substantival termination

-ung
. Upon this Rask writes as follows:—"
Gitsung
,

gewilnung
=
desire
;
swutelung
=

manifestation
;
clænsung
=
a cleansing
;

sceawung
=
view
,
contemplation
;
eorð-beofung

=
an earthquake
;
gesomnung
=
an assembly
. This
termination is chiefly used in forming substantives from verbs of the
first class in
-ian
; as
hálgung
=
consecration
, from

hálgian
=
to consecrate
. These verbs are all
feminine."—"Anglo-Saxon Grammar," p. 107.

Now, whatever may be the theory of the origin of the termination

-ing
in old phrases like
rising early is
[253]
healthy
, it cannot
apply to expressions of recent introduction. Here the direct origin in

-ung
is out of the question.

The view, then, that remains to be taken of the forms in question is
this:

1. That the older forms in
-ing
are substantival in origin, and
= the Anglo-Saxon
-ung
.

2. That the latter ones are
irregularly
participial, and have
been formed on a false analogy.

[254]

CHAPTER XXX.

THE PAST PARTICIPLE.

§ 346
. A.
The participle in

-EN
.—In the Anglo-Saxon this participle was
declined like the adjectives. Like the adjectives, it is, in the present
English, undeclined.

In Anglo-Saxon it always ended in
-en
, as
sungen
,

funden
,
bunden
. In English this
-en
is often
wanting, as
found
,
bound
; the word
bounden
being
antiquated.

Words where the
-en
is wanting may be viewed in two lights; 1,
they may be looked upon as participles that have lost their termination;
2, they may be considered as præterites with a participial sense.

§ 347
.
Drank
,
drunk
,

drunken
.—With all words wherein the vowel of the plural
differs from that of the singular, the participle takes the plural form.
To say
I have drunk
, is to use an ambiguous expression; since

drunk
may be either a participle
minus
its termination, or
a præterite with a participial sense. To say
I have drank
, is to
use a præterite for a participle. To say
I have drunken
, is to use
an unexceptional form.

In all words with a double form, as
spake
and
spoke
,

brake
and
broke
,
clave
and
clove
, the
participle follows the form in
o
, as
spoken
,
broken
,

cloven
.
Spaken
,
braken
,
claven
are impossible
forms. There are degrees in laxity of language, and to say
the spear
is broke
is better than to say
the spear is brake
.
[255]

§ 348
. As a general rule, we find the participle
in
-en
wherever the præterite is strong; indeed, the participle in

-en
may be called the strong participle, or the participle of the
strong conjugation. Still the two forms do not always coincide. In

mow
,
mowed
,
mown
,
sow
,
sowed
,

sown
; and several other words, we find the participle strong, and
the præterite weak. I remember no instances of the converse. This is only
another way of saying that the præterite has a greater tendency to pass
from strong to weak than the participle.

§ 349
. In the Latin language the change from

s
to
r
, and
vice versâ
, is very common. We have the
double forms
arbor
and
arbos
,
honor
and

honos
, &c. Of this change we have a few specimens in English.
The words
rear
and
raise
, as compared with each other, are
examples. In Anglo-Saxon a few words undergo a similar change in the
plural number of the strong præterites.

Ceóse,
I choose
; ceâs,
I chose
; curon,
we chose
; gecoren,
chosen
.

Forleóse,
I lose
; forleás,
I lost
; forluron,
we lost
; forloren,
lost
.

Hreose,
I rush
; hreás,
I rushed
; hruron,
we rushed
; gehroren,
rushed
.

This accounts for the participial form
forlorn
, or
lost
,
in New High German
verloren
. In Milton's lines,

—— the piercing air

Burns
frore
, and cold performs the effect of fire,—
Paradise Lost
, b. ii.,

we have a form from the Anglo-Saxon participle
gefroren
=

frozen
.

§ 350
. B. The
participle
in
-D
,
-T
, or
-ED
.—In the Anglo-Saxon this participle was
declined like the adjective. Like the adjective, it is, in the present
English, undeclined.
[256]

In Anglo-Saxon it differed in form from the præterite, inasmuch as it
ended in
-ed
, or
-t
, whereas the præterite ended in

-ode
,
-de
, or
-te
: as,
lufode
,
bærnde
,

dypte
, præterites;
gelufod
,
bærned
,
dypt
,
participles.

As the ejection of the
e
(in one case final in the other not)
reduces words like
bærned
and
bærnde
to the same form, it
is easy to account for the present identity of form between the weak
præterites and the participles in
-d
:
e.g.
,
I moved
,

I have moved
, &c.

§ 351
.
The prefix

Y
.—In the older writers, and in works written,
like Thomson's "Castle of Indolence," in imitation of them, we find
prefixed to the præterite participle the letter
y-
, as,

yclept
=
called
:
yclad
=
clothed
:

ydrad
=
dreaded
.

The following are the chief facts and the current opinion concerning
this prefix:—

1. It has grown out of the fuller forms
ge-
: Anglo-Saxon,

ge-
: Old Saxon,
gi-
: Mœso-Gothic,
ga-
: Old
High German,
ka-
,
cha-
,
ga-
,
ki-
,

gi-
.

2. It occurs in each and all of the Germanic languages of the Gothic
stock.

3. It occurs, with a few fragmentary exceptions, in none of the
Scandinavian languages of the Gothic stock.

4. In Anglo-Saxon it occasionally indicates a difference of sense; as,

hâten
=
called
,
ge
-hâten =
promised
;

boren
=
borne
,
ge
-boren =
born
.

5. It occurs in nouns as well as verbs.

6. Its power, in the case of nouns, is generally some idea of

association
, or
collection
.—Mœso-Gothic,

sinþs
=
a journey
,
ga-sinþa
=
a companion
;
Old High German,
perc
=
hill
;
ki-perki

(
gebirge
) =
a range of hills
.

7. But it has also a
frequentative
power; a frequentative
power, which is, in all probability, secondary to its collective power;
since things which recur frequently recur
[257]
with a tendency to
collection or association; Middle High German,
ge-rassel
=

rustling
;
ge-rumpel
=
c-rumple
.

8. And it has also the power of expressing the possession of a
quality.

Anglo-Saxon.
English.
Anglo-Saxon.
Latin.

Feax
Hair

Ge
-feax
Comatus.

Heorte
Heart

Ge
-heort
Cordatus.

Stence
Odour

Ge
-stence
Odorus.

This power is also a collective, since every quality is associated
with the object that possesses it;
a sea with waves
=
a wavy
sea
.

9. Hence it is probable that the
ga-
,
ki-
, or

gi-
, Gothic, is the
cum
of Latin languages. Such, at least,
is Grimm's view, as given in the "Deutsche Grammatik," i. 1016.

Concerning this, it may be said that it is deficient in an essential
point. It does not show how the participle past is collective.
Undoubtedly it may be said that every such participle is in the condition
of words like
ge-feax
and
ge-heort
;
i.e.
, that they
imply an association between the object and the action or state. But this
does not seem to be Grimm's view; he rather suggests that the
ge-

may have been a prefix to verbs in general, originally attached to all
their forms, but finally abandoned everywhere except in the case of the
participle.

The theory of this prefix has yet to assume a satisfactory form.

[258]

CHAPTER XXXI.

COMPOSITION.

§ 352
. In the following words, amongst many
others, we have palpable and indubitable specimens of
composition—
day-star
,
vine-yard
,
sun-beam
,

apple-tree
,
ship-load
,
silver-smith
, &c. The
words
palpable
and
indubitable
have been used, because in
many cases, as will be seen hereafter, it is difficult to determine
whether a word be a true compound or not.

§ 353
. Now, in each of the compounds quoted
above, it may be seen that it is the second word which is qualified, or
defined, by the first, and that it is not the first which is qualified,
or defined, by the second. Of
yards
,
beams
,
trees
,

loads
,
smiths
, there may be many sorts, and, in order to
determine what
particular
sort of
yard
,
beam
,

tree
,
load
, or
smith
, may be meant, the words

vine
,
sun
,
apple
,
ship
, and
silver
,
are prefixed. In compound words it is the
first
term that defines
or particularises the
second
.

§ 354
. That the idea given by the word

apple-tree
is not referable to the words
apple
and

tree
, irrespective of the order in which they occur, may be seen
by reversing the position of them. The word
tree-apple
, although
not existing in the language, is as correct a word as
thorn-apple
.
In
tree-apple
, the particular sort of
apple
meant is
denoted by the word
tree
, and if there
[259]
were in our gardens
various sorts of plants called
apples
, of which some grew along
the ground and others upon trees, such a word as
tree-apple
would
be required in order to be opposed to
earth-apple
, or

ground-apple
, or some word of the kind.

In the compound words
tree-apple
and
apple-tree
, we have
the same elements differently arranged. However, as the word

tree-apple
is not current in the language, the class of compounds
indicated by it may seem to be merely imaginary. Nothing is farther from
being the case. A
tree-rose
is a
rose
of a particular sort.
The generality of
roses
being on
shrubs
, this grows on a

tree
. Its peculiarity consists in this fact, and this particular
character is expressed by the word
tree
prefixed. A

rose-tree
is a
tree
of a particular sort, distinguished
from
apple-trees
, and
trees
in general (in other words,
particularised or defined), by the word
rose
prefixed.

A
ground-nut
is a
nut
particularised by growing in the
ground. A
nut-ground
is a
ground
particularised by
producing nuts.

A
finger-ring
, as distinguished from an
ear-ring
, and
from
rings
in general (and so particularised), is a
ring

for the
finger
. A
ring-finger
, as distinguished from

fore-fingers
, and from
fingers
in general (and so
particularised), is a
finger
whereon
rings
are worn.

§ 355
. At times this rule seems to be violated.
The words
spit-fire
and
dare-devil
seem exceptions to it.
At the first glance it seems, in the case of a
spit-fire
, that
what he (or she)
spits
is
fire
; and that, in the case of a

dare-devil
, what he (or she)
dares
is the
devil
. In
this case the initial words
spit
and
dare
are
particularised by the final ones
fire
and
devil
. The true
idea, however, confirms the original rule. A
spit-fire

[260]
voids his
fire by spitting. A
dare-devil
, in meeting the fiend, would not
shrink from him, but would defy him. A
spit-fire
is not one who
spits fire, but one whose fire is
spit
. A
dare-devil
is not
one who dares even the devil, but one by whom the devil is even
dared.

§ 356
. Of the two elements of a compound word,
which is the most important? In one sense the latter, in another sense
the former. The latter word is the most
essential
; since the
general idea of
trees
must exist before it can be defined or
particularised; so becoming the idea which we have in
apple-tree
,

rose-tree
, &c. The former word, however, is the most

influential
. It is by this that the original idea is qualified.
The latter word is the staple original element: the former is the
superadded influencing element. Compared with each other, the former
element is active, the latter passive. Etymologically speaking, the
former element, in English compounds, is the most important.

§ 357
. Most numerous are the observations that
bear upon the detail of the composition of words;
e.g.
, how nouns
combine with nouns, as in
sun-beam
; nouns with verbs, as in

dare-devil
, &c. It is thought however, sufficient in the
present work to be content with, 1. defining the meaning of the term
composition; 2. explaining the nature of some obscure compounds.

Composition is the joining together,
in language
, of
two
different words
, and
treating the combination as a single
term
. Observe the words in italics.

In language.
—A great number of our compounds, like the
word
merry-making
, are divided by the sign -, or the hyphen. It is
very plain that if all words
spelt

[261]
with a hyphen were to
be considered as compounds, the formation of them would be not a matter
of speech, or language, but one of writing or spelling. This
distinguishes compounds in language from mere printers' compounds.

Two.
—For this, see §
369
.

Different.
—In Old High German we find the form

sëlp-sëlpo
. Here there is the junction of two words, but not the
junction of two
different
ones. This distinguishes composition
from gemination.

Words.
—In
father-s
,
clear-er
,

four-th
, &c., there is the addition of a letter or a syllable,
and it may be even of the part of a word. There is no addition, however,
of a whole word. This distinguishes composition from derivation.

Treating the combination as a single term.
—In determining
between derived words and compound words, there is an occasional
perplexity; the perplexity, however, is far greater in determining
between a
compound word
and
two words
. In the eyes of one
grammarian the term
mountain height
may be as truly a compound
word as
sun-beam
. In the eyes of another grammarian it may be no
compound word, but two words, just as
Alpine height
is two words;

mountain
being dealt with as an adjective. It is in the
determination of this that the accent plays an important part.

§ 358
. As a preliminary to a somewhat subtle
distinction, the attention of the reader is drawn to the following line,
slightly altered, from Churchill:—

"Then rést, my friénd,
and spáre
thy précious bréath."

On each of the syllables
rést
,
friénd
,
spáre
,

préc-
,
bréath
, there is an accent. Each of these syllables

[262]
must be compared with the one that
precedes it;
rest
with
then
,
friend
with
my
,
and so on throughout the line. Compared with the word
and
, the
word
spare
is not only accented, but the accent is conspicuous and
prominent. There is so little on
and
, so much on
spare
,
that the disparity of accent is very manifest.

Now, if in the place of
and
, there were some other word, a word
not so much accented as
spare
, but still more accented than

and
, this disparity would be diminished, and the accents of the
two words might be said to be at
par
, or nearly so. As said
before, the line was slightly altered from Churchill, the real reading
being

"Then rést, my friénd,
spare, spare
thy précious bréath."

In the true reading we actually find what had previously only been
supposed. In the words
spare, spare
, the accents are nearly at

par
. Such the difference between accent at par and disparity of
accent.

Good illustrations of the parity and disparity of accent may be drawn
from certain names of places. Let there be such a sentence as the
following:
the lime house near the bridge north of the new port
.
Compare the parity of accent on the pairs of words
lime
and

house
,
bridge
and
north
,
new
and
port
,
with the disparity of accent in the compound words
Límehouse
,

Brídgenorth
, and
Néwport
. The separate words
beef
steak
, where the accent is nearly at
par
, compared with the
compound word
sweépstakes
, where there is a great disparity of
accent, are further illustrations of the same difference.

The difference between a compound word and a pair of words is further
illustrated by comparing such terms as the following:—
bláck
bírd
, meaning a
bird that
[263]
is black
, with

bláckbird
= the Latin
merula
;
blúe béll
, meaning a

bell that is blue
, with
blúebell
, the flower. Expressions
like a
shárp edgéd instrument
, meaning
an instrument that is
sharp and has edges
, as opposed to
a shárp-edged instrument
,
meaning
an instrument with sharp edges
, further exemplify this
difference.

Subject to a few exceptions, it may be laid down, that, in the English
language,
there is no composition unless there is either a change of
form or a change of accent
.

§ 359
. The reader is now informed, that unless
he has taken an exception to either a statement or an inference, he has
either seen beyond what has been already laid down by the author, or else
has read him with insufficient attention. This may be shown by drawing a
distinction between a compound form and a compound idea.

In the words
a red house
, each word preserves its natural and
original meaning, and the statement suggested by the term is
that a
house is red
. By a parity of reasoning
a mad house
should mean
a
house that is mad
; and provided that each word retain its

natural meaning
and its
natural accent
, such is the fact.
Let a
house
mean, as it often does, a
family
. Then the
phrase,
a mad house
, means that the
house
,
or
family
,
is mad
, just as a
red house
means that the

house is red
. Such, however, is not the current meaning of the
word. Every one knows that
a mad house
means
a house for mad
men
; in which case it is treated as a compound word, and has a marked
accent on the first syllable, just as
Límehouse
has. Now, compared
with the word
red house
, meaning a house of a
red colour
,
and compared with the words
mad house
, meaning a
deranged
family
, the word
[264]
mádhouse
, in its common sense,
expressed a compound idea; as opposed to two ideas, or a double idea. The
word
beef steak
is evidently a compound idea; but as there is no
disparity of accent, it is not a compound word. Its sense is compound.
Its form is not compound but double. This indicates the objection
anticipated, which is this:
viz.
, that a definition, which would
exclude such a word as
beef steak
from the list of compounds, is,
for that very reason, exceptionable. I answer to this, that the term in
question is a compound idea, and not a compound form; in other words,
that it is a compound in logic, but not a compound in etymology. Now
etymology, taking cognisance of forms only, has nothing to do with ideas,
except so far as they influence forms.

Such is the commentary upon the words,
treating the combination as
a single term
; in other words, such the difference between a compound
word and two words. The rule, being repeated, stands (subject to
exceptions indicated above) thus:—
there is no true composition
without either a change of form or a change of accent
.

§ 360
. As I wish to be clear upon this point, I
shall illustrate the statement by its application.

The term
trée-rose
is often pronounced
trée róse
; that
is, with the accent at
par
. It is compound in the one case; it is
a pair of words in the other.

The terms
mountain ash
and
mountain height
are generally
(perhaps always) pronounced with an equal accent on the syllables

mount-
and
ash
,
mount-
and
height
,
respectively. In this case the word
mountain
must be dealt with as
an adjective, and the words considered as two. The word
moúntain
wave
is often pronounced with a visible diminution of accent on the

[265]
last syllable. In this case there is a
disparity of accent, and the word is compound.

§ 361
. The following quotation indicates a
further cause of perplexity in determining between compound words and two
words:—

1.

A wet sheet and a blowing gale,

A breeze that follows fast;

That fills the white and swelling sail,

And bends the
gallant mast
.—
Allan Cunningham.

2.

Britannia needs no bulwarks,

No towers along the steep;

Her march is o'er the
mountain-wave
,

Her home is on the deep.—
Thomas Campbell.

To speak first of the term
gallant mast
. If
gallant
mean

brave
, there are
two words
. If the words be two, there is a
stronger accent on
mast
. If the accent on
mast
be stronger,
the rhyme with
fast
is more complete; in other words, the metre
favours the notion of the words being considered as
two
.

Gallant-mast
, however, is a compound word, with an especial
nautical meaning. In this case the accent is stronger on
gal-
and
weaker on
-mast
. This, however, is not the state of things that
the metre favours. The same applies to
mountain wave
. The same
person who in prose would throw a stronger accent on
mount-
and a
weaker one on
wave
(so dealing with the word as a compound),
might, in poetry, the words
two
, by giving to the last syllable a
parity of accent.

The following quotation from Ben Jonson may be
[266]
read in two ways; and
the accent may vary with the reading:

1.

Lay thy bow of pearl apart,

And thy
silver shining
quiver.

2.

Lay thy bow of pearl apart,

And thy
silver-shining
quiver.—
Cynthia's Revels.

§ 362
.
On certain words wherein the fact of
their being compound is obscured.
—Composition is the addition
of a word to a word, derivation is the addition of certain letters or
syllables to a word. In a compound form each element has a separate and
independent existence; in a derived form, only one of the elements has
such. Now it is very possible that in an older stage of a language two
words may exist, may be put together, and may so form a compound, each
word having, then, a separate and independent existence. In a later stage
of language, however, only one of these words may have a separate and
independent existence, the other having become obsolete. In this case a
compound word would take the appearance of a derived one, since but one
of its elements could be exhibited as a separate and independent word.
Such is the case with, amongst others, the word
bishop-ric
. In the
present language the word
ric
has no separate and independent
existence. For all this, the word is a true compound, since, in
Anglo-Saxon, we have the noun
ríce
as a separate, independent
word, signifying
kingdom
or
domain
.

Again, without becoming obsolete, a word may alter its form. This is
the case with most of our adjectives
[267]
in
-ly
. At
present they appear derivative; their termination
-ly
having no
separate and independent existence. The older language, however, shows
that they are compounds; since
-ly
is nothing else than

-lic
, Anglo-Saxon;
-lih
, Old High German;
-leiks
,
Mœso-Gothic; =
like
, or
similis
, and equally with it
an independent separate word.

§ 363
. "Subject to a few exceptions, it may be
laid down, that
there is no true composition unless there is either a
change of form or a change of accent
."—Such is the statement
made in §
358
. The first class of exceptions
consists of those words where the natural tendency to disparity of accent
is traversed by some rule of euphony. For example, let two words be put
together, which at their point of contact form a combination of sounds
foreign to our habits of pronunciation. The rarity of the combination
will cause an effort in utterance. The effort in utterance will cause an
accent to be laid on the latter half of the compound. This will equalize
the accent, and abolish the disparity. The word
monkshood
, the
name of a flower (
aconitum napellus
), where, to my ear at least,
there is quite as much accent on the
-hood
as on the

monks-
, may serve in the way of illustration.
Monks
is one
word,
hood
another. When joined together, the
h-
of the

-hood
is put in immediate apposition with the
s
of the

monks-
. Hence the combination
monkshood
. At the letters

s
and
h
is the point of contact. Now the sound of
s

followed immediately by the sound of
h
is a true aspirate. But
true aspirates are rare in the English language. Being of rare
occurrence, the pronunciation of them is a matter of attention and
effort; and this attention and effort create an accent which otherwise
would be absent.
[268]
Hence words like
mónks-hóod
,

well-héad
, and some others.

Real reduplications of consonants, as in
hóp-póle
, may have the
same parity of accent with the true aspirates: and for the same reasons.
They are rare combinations that require effort and attention.

§ 364
. The second class of exceptions contains
those words wherein between the first element and the second there is so
great a disparity, either in the length of the vowel, or the length of
the syllable
en masse
, as to counteract the natural tendency of
the first element to become accented. One of the few specimens of this
class (which after all may consist of double words) is the term

upstánding
. Here it should be remembered, that words like

hapházard
,
foolhárdy
,
uphólder
, and
withhóld

come under the first class of the exceptions.

§ 365
. The third class of exceptions contains
words like
perchánce
and
perháps
. In all respects but one
these are double words, just as
by chance
is a double word.

Per
, however, differs from
by
in having no separate
existence. This sort of words we owe to the multiplicity of elements
(classical and Gothic) in the English language.

§ 366
.
Peacock
,
peahen
.—If
these words be rendered masculine or feminine by the addition of the
elements
-cock
and
-hen
, the statements made in the
beginning of the present chapter are invalidated. Since, if the word

pea-
be particularized, qualified, or defined by the words

-cock
and
-hen
, the
second
term defines or
particularises the
first
, which is contrary to the rule of §
356
. The truth, however, is, that the words

-cock
and
-hen
are defined by the prefix
pea-
.
Preparatory to the exhibition of this, let us remember that the word

pea
(although
[269]
now found in composition only) is a true
and independent substantive, the name of a species of fowl, like

pheasant
,
partridge
, or any other appellation. It is the
Latin
pavo
, German
pfau
. Now if the word
peacock

mean a
pea
(
pfau
or
pavo
) that is a male, then do

wood-cock
,
black-cock
, and
bantam-cock
, mean

woods
,
blacks
, and
bantams
that are male. Or if the
word
peahen
mean a
pea
(
pfau
or
pavo
) that is
female, then do
moorhen
and
guineahen
mean
moors
and

guineas
that are female. Again, if a
peahen
mean a

pea
(
pfau
or
pavo
) that is female, then does the
compound
pheasant-hen
mean the same as
hen-pheasant
; which
is not the case. The fact is that
peacock
means a
cock that is
a pea
(
pfau
or
pavo
);
peahen
means a
hen that
is a pea
(
pfau
or
pavo
); and, finally,
peafowl

means a
fowl that is a pea
(
pfau
or
pavo
). In the
same way
moorfowl
means, not a
moor that is connected with a
fowl
, but a
fowl that is connected with a moor
.

§ 367
. It must be clear that in every compound
word there are, at least, two parts;
i.e.
, the whole or part of
the original, and the whole or part of the superadded word. In the most
perfect forms of inflection, however, there is a
third
element,

viz.
, a vowel, consonant, or syllable that joins the first word
with the second.

In the older forms of all the Gothic languages the presence of this
third element was the rule rather than the exception. In the present
English it exists in but few words.

a.
The
-a-
in
black-a-moor
is possibly such a
connecting element.

b.
The
-in-
in
night-in-gale
is most probably
such a connecting element. Compare the German form
[270]
nacht-i-gale
,
and remember the tendency of vowels to take the sound of
-ng

before
g
.

§ 368
.
Improper compounds.
—The

-s-
in words like
Thur-s-day
,
hunt-s-man
, may be one
of two things.

a.
It may be the sign of the genitive case, so that

Thursday
=
Thoris dies
. In this case the word is an

improper compound
, since it is like the word
pater-familias

in Latin, in a common state of syntactical construction.

b.
It may be a connecting sound, like the
-i-
in

nacht-i-gale
. Reasons for this view occur in the following
fact:—

In the modern German languages the genitive case of feminine nouns
ends otherwise than in
-s
. Nevertheless, the sound of
-s-

occurs in composition equally, whether the noun it follows be masculine
or feminine. This fact, as far as it goes, makes it convenient to
consider the sound in question as a connective rather than a case.
Probably, it is neither one nor the other exactly, but the effect of a
false analogy.

§ 369
.
Decomposites.
—"Composition
is the joining together of
two
words."—See §
357
.

Words like
mid-ship-man
,
gentle-man-like
, &c., where
the number of verbal elements seems to amount to
three
, are no
exception to this rule; since
compound radicals
like

midship
and
gentleman
, are, for the purposes of
composition, single words. Compounds wherein one element is compound are
called
decomposites
.

§ 370
. There are a number of words which are
never found by themselves; or, if so found, have never the same sense
that they have in
combination
. Mark the word
combination
.
The terms in question are points of
combination
, not of
composition: since they form not the
[271]
parts of words, but the
parts of phrases. Such are the expressions
time and
tide
—
might and main
—
rede me my
riddle
—
pay your shot
—
rhyme and reason
,
&c. These words are evidently of the same class, though not of the
same species with
bishopric
,
colewort
,
spillikin
,

gossip
,
mainswearer
, &c.

These last-mentioned terms give us obsolete words preserved in
composition. The former give us obsolete words preserved in
combination.

[272]

CHAPTER XXXII.

ON DERIVATION AND INFLECTION.

§ 371
.
Derivation
, like
etymology
,
is a word used in a wide and in a limited sense. In the wide sense of the
term, every word, except it be in the simple form of a root, is a derived
word. In this sense the cases, numbers, and genders of nouns, the
persons, moods, and tenses of verbs, the ordinal numbers, the
diminutives, and even the compound words, are alike matters of
derivation. In the wide sense of the term the word
fathers
, from

father
, is equally in a state of derivation with the word

strength
from
strong
.

In the use of the word, even in its limited sense, there is
considerable laxity and uncertainty.

Gender
,
number
,
case
.—These have been
called the
accidents
of the noun, and these it has been agreed to
separate from derivation in its stricter sense, or from derivation
properly so called, and to class together under the name of declension.
Nouns are
declined
.

Person
,
number
,
tense
,
voice
.—These
have been called the
accidents
of a verb, and these it has been
agreed to separate from derivation properly so called, and to class
together under the name of conjugation. Verbs are
conjugated
.

Conjugation and declension constitute inflection. Nouns and verbs,
speaking generally, are inflected.
[273]

Inflection, a part of derivation in its wider sense, is separated from
derivation properly so called, or from derivation in its limited
sense.

The degrees of comparison, or certain derived forms of adjectives; the
ordinals, or certain derived forms of the numerals; the diminutives,
&c., or certain derived forms of the substantive, have been separated
from derivation properly so called, and considered as parts of
inflection. I am not certain, however, that for so doing there is any
better reason than mere convenience.

Derivation proper, the subject of the present chapter, comprises all
the changes that words undergo, which are not referable to some of the
preceding heads. As such, it is, in its details, a wider field than even
composition. The details, however, are not entered into.

§ 372
. Derivation proper may be divided
according to a variety of principles. Amongst others—

I.
According to the evidence.
—In the evidence that a word
is not simple, but derived, there are at least two degrees.

a.
That the word
strength
is a derived word I collect to
a certainty from the word
strong
, an independent form, which I can
separate from it. Of the nature of the word
strength
there is the
clearest evidence, or evidence of the first degree.

b.

Fowl
,
hail
,
nail
,
sail
,

tail
,
soul
; in Anglo-Saxon,
fugel
,
hægel
,

nægel
,
segel
,
tægel
,
sawel
.—These words
are by the best grammarians considered as derivatives. Now, with these
words I cannot do what was done with the word
strength
, I cannot
take from them the part which I look upon as the derivational addition,
and after that leave an independent word.
Strength

-th
is a
true word;
fowl
or
fugel

-l
is no true word. If I
believe
[274]
these latter words to be derivations at
all, I do it because I find in words like
harelle
, &c., the

-l
as a derivational addition. Yet, as the fact of a word being
sometimes used as a derivational addition does not preclude it from being
at other times a part of the root, the evidence that the words in
question are not simple, but derived, is not cogent. In other words, it
is evidence of the second degree.

II.
According to the effect.
—The syllable
-en
in
the word
whiten
changes the noun
white
into a verb. This is
its effect. We may so classify derivational forms as to arrange
combinations like
-en
(whose effect is to give the idea of the
verb) in one order; whilst combinations like
-th
(whose effect is,
as in the word
strength
, to give the idea of abstraction) form
another order.

III.
According to the form.
—Sometimes the derivational
element is a vowel (as the
-ie
in
doggie
), sometimes a
consonant (as the
-th
in
strength
), sometimes a vowel and
consonant combined; in other words a syllable (as the
-en
, in

whiten
), sometimes a change of vowel without any addition (as the

-i
in
tip
, compared with
top
), sometimes a change of
consonant without any addition (as the
z
in
prize
, compared
with
price
). Sometimes it is a change of accent, like a

súrvey
, compared with
to survéy
. To classify derivations in
this manner, is to classify them according to their form.

IV.
According to the historical origin of the derivational
elements.

V.
According to the number of the derivational
elements.
—In
fisher
, as compared with
fish
, there
is but one derivational affix. In
fishery
, as compared with

fish
, the number of derivational elements is two.
[275]

§ 373
. In words like
bishopric
, and many
others mentioned in the last Chapter, we had compound words under the
appearance of derived ones; in words like
upmost
, and many others,
we have derivation under the appearance of composition.

[276]

CHAPTER XXXIII.

ADVERBS.

§ 374
.
Adverbs.
—The adverbs are
capable of being classified after a variety of principles.

Firstly, they may be divided according to their meaning. In this case
we speak of the adverbs of
time
,
place
,
number
,

manner
.

§ 375
.
Well
,
better
,
ill
,

worse
.—Here we have a class of adverbs expressive of degree,
or intensity. Adverbs of this kind are capable of taking an inflection,

viz.
, that of the comparative and superlative degrees.

Now
,
then
,
here
,
there
.—In the idea
expressed by these words there are no degrees of intensity. Adverbs of
this kind are incapable of taking any inflection.

Adverbs differ from nouns and verbs in being susceptible of one sort
of inflection only,
viz.
, that of degree.

§ 376
. Secondly, adverbs may be divided
according to their form and origin.

Better
,
worse
.—Here the words are sometimes
adverbs; sometimes adjectives.—
This book is better than
that
—here
better
agrees with
book
, and is,
therefore, adjectival.
This looks better than that
—here

better
qualifies
looks
, and is therefore adverbial. Again;

to do a thing with violence
is equivalent
to do a thing
violently
. This shows how adverbs may arise out of cases. In words
like the English
better
, the Latin
vi
=
violenter
,
the Greek
καλὸν
=
καλῶς
, we have adjectives in
their
[277]
degrees, and substantives in their cases,
with adverbial powers. In other words, nouns are deflected from their
natural sense to an adverbial one. Adverbs of this kind are adverbs of

deflection
.

Brightly
,
bravely
.—Here an adjective is rendered
adverbial by the addition of the derivative syllable
-ly
. Adverbs
like
brightly
, &c., may be called adverbs of

derivation
.

Now
.—This word has not satisfactorily been shown to have
originated as any other part of speech but as an adverb. Words of this
sort are adverbs
absolute
.

§ 377
.
When
,
now
,
well
,

worse
,
better
—here the adverbial expression consists
in a single word, and is
simple
.
To-day
,
yesterday
,

not at all
,
somewhat
—here the adverbial expression
consists of a compound word, or a phrase. This indicates the division of
adverbs into
simple
and
complex
.

§ 378
. Adverbs of deflection may originally have
been—

a.

Substantive
; as
needs
in such expressions as

I needs must go
.

b.

Adjectives
; as the
sun shines bright
.

c.

Prepositions
; as
I go in
,
we go out
;
though, it should be added, that in this case we may as reasonably derive
the preposition from the adverb as the adverb from the preposition.

§ 379
. Adjectives of deflection derived from
substantives may originally have been—

a.

Substantives in the
genitive
case
; as

needs
.

b.

Substantives in the
dative
case
; as

whil-om
, an antiquated word meaning
at times
, and often
improperly spelt
whilome
. In such an expression as
wait a
while
, the word still exists; and
while
=
time
, or
rather
pause
; since, in Danish,
hvile
=
rest
.
[278]

El-se
(for
ell-es
);
unawar-es
;
eftsoon-s

are
adjectives
in the genitive case.
By rights
is a word of
the same sort; the
-s
being the sign of the genitive singular like
the
-s
in
father's
, and not of the accusative plural like
the
-s
in
fathers
.

Once
(
on-es
);
twice
(
twi-es
);

thrice
(
thri-es
) are
numerals
in the genitive
case.

§ 380
.
Darkling
.—This is no
participle of a verb
darkle
, but an adverb of derivation, like

unwaringûn
=
unawares
, Old High German;
stillinge
=

secretly
, Middle High German;
blindlings
=
blindly
,
New High German;
darnungo
=
secretly
, Old Saxon;

nichtinge
=
by night
, Middle Dutch;
blindeling
=

blindly
, New Dutch;
bæclinga
=
backwards
,

handlunga
=
hand to hand
, Anglo-Saxon; and, finally,

blindlins
,
backlins
,
darklins
,
middlins
,

scantlins
,
stridelins
,
stowlins
, in Lowland
Scotch.

[279]

CHAPTER XXXIV.

ON CERTAIN ADVERBS OF PLACE.

§ 381
. It is a common practice for languages to
express by different modifications of the same root the three following
ideas:—

1. The idea of rest
in
a place.

2. The idea of motion
towards
a place.

3. The idea of motion
from
a place.

This habit gives us three correlative adverbs—one of

position
, and two of
direction
.

§ 382
. It is also a common practice of language
to depart from the original expression of each particular idea, and to
interchange the signs by which they are expressed; so that a word
originally expressive of simple position or
rest in a place
may be
used instead of the word expressive of direction,
or motion between
two places
. Hence we say,
come here
, when
come hither

would be the more correct expression.

§ 383
. The full amount of change in this
respect
may be
seen from the following table, illustrative of the forms
here
,

hither
,
hence
.

Mœso-Gothic

,

,

.

where
,
whither
,

.

here
,
hither
,
hence
.

§ 384
. Local terminations of this kind, in
general, were commoner in the earlier stages of language than at present.
The following are from the Mœso-Gothic:—

Innaþrô
=
from within
.

Utaþrô
=
from without
.

Iuþaþrô
=
from above
.

Fáirraþrô
=
from afar
.

Allaþrô
=
from all quarters
.

§ 385
. The
-ce
( =
es
) in

hen-ce
,
when-ce
,
then-ce
, has yet to be
satisfactorily explained. The Old English is
whenn-es
,

thenn-es
. As far, therefore, as the spelling is concerned, they
are in the same predicament with the word
once
, which is properly

on-es
, the genitive of
one
. This origin is probable, but
not certain.

§ 386
.
Yonder
.—In the
Mœso-Gothic we have the following forms:
jáinar
,

jáina
,
jánþrô
=
illic
,
illuc
,
illinc
.
They do not, however, quite explain the form
yon-d-er
. It is not
clear whether the
d
= the
-d
in
jâind
, or the

þ
in
jainþro
.
[281]

§ 387
.
Anon
, is used by Shakspeare, in
the sense of
presently
.—The probable history of this word is
as follows: the first syllable contains a root akin to the root

yon
, signifying
distance in place
. The second is a
shortened form of the Old High German and Middle High German,
-nt
,
a termination expressive, 1, of removal in
space
; 2, of removal in

time
; Old High German,
ënont
,
ënnont
; Middle High
German,
ënentlig
,
jenunt
=
beyond
.

[282]

CHAPTER XXXV.

ON WHEN, THEN, AND THAN.

§ 388
. The Anglo-Saxon adverbs are
whenne

and
þenne
=
when
,
then
.

The masculine accusative cases of the relative and demonstrative
pronoun are
hwæne
(
hwone
) and
þæne

(
þone
).

Notwithstanding the difference, the first form is a variety of the
second; so that the adverbs
when
and
then
are really
pronominal in origin.

§ 389
. As to the word
than
, the
conjunction of comparison, it is another form of
then
; the notions
of
order
,
sequence
, and
comparison
being allied.

This is good
;
then
(or
next in order
)
that is
good
, is an expression sufficiently similar to
this is better than
that
to have given rise to it; and in Scotch and certain provincial
dialects we actually find
th
a
n
instead of

th
e
n
.

CHAPTER XXXVI.

PREPOSITIONS AND CONJUNCTIONS.

§ 390
.
Prepositions.
—Prepositions
are wholly unsusceptible of inflection.

§ 391
.
Conjunctions.
—Conjunctions,
like prepositions, are wholly unsusceptible of inflection.

§ 392
.
Yes
,
no
.—Although

not
may be considered to be an adverb,
nor
a conjunction,
and
none
a noun, these two words, the direct categorical
affirmative, and the direct categorical negative, are referable to none
of the current parts of speech. Accurate grammar places them in a class
by themselves.

§ 393
.
Particles.
—The word particle
is a collective term for all those parts of speech that are

naturally
unsusceptible of inflection; comprising, 1,
interjections; 2, direct categorical affirmatives; 3, direct categorical
negatives; 4, absolute conjunctions; 5, absolute prepositions; 6, adverbs
unsusceptible of degrees of comparison; 7, inseparable prefixes.

[284]

CHAPTER XXXVII.

ON THE GRAMMATICAL POSITION OF THE WORDS MINE AND THINE.

§ 394
. The inflection of pronouns has its
natural peculiarities in language. It has also its natural difficulties
in philology. These occur not in one language in particular, but in all
generally.

The most common peculiarity in the grammar of pronouns is the fact of
what may be called their
convertibility
. Of this

convertibility
the following statements serve as
illustration:—

1.
Of case.
—In our own language the words
my
and

thy
although at present possessives, were previously datives, and,
earlier still, accusatives. Again, the accusative
you
replaces the
nominative
ye
, and
vice versâ
.

2.
Of number.
—The words
thou
and
thee
are,
except in the mouths of Quakers, obsolete. The plural forms,
ye

and
you
, have replaced them.

3.
Of person.
—The Greek language gives us examples of
this in the promiscuous use of
νιν
,
μιν
,
σφε
, and
ἑαυτοῦ
; whilst

sich
and
sik
are used with a similar latitude in the Middle
High German and Scandinavian.

4.
Of class.
—The demonstrative pronouns become—

a.
Personal pronouns.

b.
Relative pronouns.

c.
Articles.

[285]

The reflective pronoun often becomes reciprocal.

§ 395
. These statements are made for the sake of
illustrating, not of exhausting, the subject. It follows, however, as an
inference from them, that the classification of pronouns is complicated.
Even if we knew the original power and derivation of every form of every
pronoun in a language, it would be far from an easy matter to determine
therefrom the paradigm that they should take in grammar. To place a word
according to its power in a late stage of language might confuse the
study of an early stage. To say that because a word was once in a given
class, it should always be so, would be to deny that in the present
English
they
,
these
, and
she
are personal pronouns
at all.

The two tests, then, of the grammatical place of a pronoun, its

present power
and its
original power
, are often
conflicting.

§ 396
. In the English language the point of most
importance in this department of grammar is the place of forms like

mine
and
thine
; in other words, of the forms in

-n
.

Now, if we take up the common grammars of the English language
as
it is
, we find, that, whilst
my
and
thy
are dealt with
as genitive cases,
mine
and
thine
are considered
adjectives. In the
Anglo-Saxon
grammars, however,
min
and

þin
, the older forms of
mine
and
thine
, are treated
as genitives or possessives.

§ 397
. This gives us two views of the words

my
and
thy
.

a.
They may be genitives or possessives, which were originally
datives or accusatives; in which case they are deduced from the
Anglo-Saxon
mec
and
þec
.

b.
They may be the Anglo-Saxon
min
and
þin
,

minus
the final
-n
.
[286]

Each of these views has respectable supporters. The former is
decidedly preferred by the present writer.

§ 398
. What, however, are
thine
and

mine
? Are they adjectives like
meus
,
tuus
, and

suus
, or cases like
mei
,
tui
,
sui
, in Latin,
and
hi-s
in English?

It is no answer to say that sometimes they are one and sometimes the
other. They were not so originally. They did not begin with meaning two
things at once; on the contrary, they were either possessive cases, of
which the power became subsequently adjectival, or adjectives, of which
the power became subsequently possessive.

§ 399
. In Anglo-Saxon and in Old Saxon there is
but one form to express the Latin
mei
(or
tui
), on the one
side, and
meus
,
mea
,
meum
(or
tuus
, &c.),
on the other. In several other Gothic tongues, however, there was the
following difference of form:

Mœso-Gothic
meina
=
mei
as opposed to
meins
=
meus
.

þeina
=
tui
-
þeins
=
tuus
.

Old High German
mîn
=
mei
-
mîner
=
meus
.

dîn
=
tui
-
dîner
=
tuus
.

Old Norse

min
=
mei
-
minn
=
meus
.

þin
=
tui
-
þinn
=
tuus
.

Middle Dutch
mîns
=
mei
-
mîn
=
meus
.

dîns
=
tui
-
dîn
=
tuus
.

Modern High German
mein
=
mei
-
meiner
=
meus
.

dein
=
tui
-
deiner
=
tuus
.

In these differences of form lie the best reasons for the assumption
of a genitive case, as the origin of an adjectival form; and,
undoubtedly, in those languages where both forms occur, it is convenient
to consider one as a case and one as an adjective.

§ 400
. But this is not the present question. In

[287]
Anglo-Saxon there is but one form,

min
and
þin
=
mei
and
meus
,
tui
and

tuus
, indifferently. Is this form an oblique case or an
adjective?

This involves two sorts of evidence.

§ 401
.
Etymological
evidence.
—Assuming two
powers
for the words
min

and
þin
, one genitive, and one adjectival, which is the original
one? Or, going beyond the Anglo-Saxon, assuming that of two
forms

like
meina
and
meins
, the one has been derived from the
other, which is the primitive, radical, primary, or original one?

Men, from whom it is generally unsafe to differ, consider that the
adjectival form is the derived one; and, as far as forms like

mîner
, as opposed to
mîn
, are concerned, the evidence of
the foregoing list is in their favour. But what is the case with the
Middle Dutch? The genitive
mîns
is evidently the derivative of

mîn
.

The reason why the forms like
mîner
seem derived is because
they are longer and more complex than the others. Nevertheless, it is by
no means an absolute rule in philology that the least compound form is
the oldest. A word may be adapted to a secondary meaning by a change in
its parts in the way of omission, as well as by a change in the way of
addition.

§ 402
. As to the question whether it is most
likely for an adjective to be derived from a case, or a case from an
adjective, it may be said, that philology furnishes instances both ways.

Ours
is a case derived, in syntax at least, from an adjective.

Cujum
(as in
cujum pecus
) and
sestertium
are Latin
instances of a nominative case being evolved from an oblique one.

§ 403
.
Syntactic evidence.
—If in
Anglo-Saxon we found such expressions as
dœl min
=
pars
mei
,
hœlf þin

[288]
=
dimidium tui
, we should have a
reason, as far as it went, for believing in the existence of a true
genitive. Such instances, however, have yet to be quoted.

§ 404
. Again—as
min
and
þin

are declined like adjectives, even as
meus
and
tuus
are so
declined, we have means of ascertaining their nature from the form they
take in certain constructions; thus,
mi
nra =
me
orum, and

min
re =
me
æ, are the genitive plural and the dative
singular respectively. Thus, too, the Anglo-Saxon for
of thy eyes

should be
eagena þinra
, and the Anglo-Saxon for
to my
widow
, should be
wuduwan minre
; just as in Latin, they would
be
oculorum tuorum
, and
viduæ meæ.

If, however, instead of this we find such expressions as
eagena
þin
, or
wuduwan min
, we find evidence in favour of a genitive
case; for then the construction is not one of concord, but one of
government, and the words
þin
and
min
must be construed as
the Latin forms
tui
and
mei
would be in
oculorum
mei
, and
viduæ mei
;
viz.
: as genitive cases. Now,
whether a sufficient proportion of such constructions exist or not, they
have not yet been brought forward.

Such instances, even if quoted, would not be conclusive.

§ 405
. Why would they not be conclusive? Because

even of the adjective there are uninflected forms
.

As early as the Mœso-Gothic stage of our language, we find
rudiments of this omission of the inflection. The possessive pronouns in
the
neuter singular
sometimes take the inflection, sometimes
appear as crude forms,
nim thata badi theinata
=
ᾆρόν
σου τὸν
κράββατον
(Mark
ii. 9), opposed to
nim thata badi thein
, two verses afterwards. So
also with
mein
and
meinata
. It is remarkable that this
omission should begin with
[289]
forms so marked as those of the neuter
(-
ata
). It has, perhaps, its origin in the adverbial character of
that gender.

Old High German.
—Here the nominatives, both masculine and
feminine, lose the inflection, whilst the neuter retains it—
thin
dohter
,
sîn quenâ
,
min dohter
,
sinaz lîb
. In a
few cases, when the pronoun comes after, even the
oblique
cases
drop the inflection.

Middle High German.
—
Preceding
the noun, the
nominative of all genders is destitute of inflection;
sîn lîb
,

mîn ere
,
dîn lîb
, &c.
Following
the nouns, the
oblique cases do the same;
ine herse sîn
. The influence of
position should here be noticed. Undoubtedly a place
after
the
substantive influences the omission of the inflection. This appears in
its
maximum
in the Middle High German. In Mœso-Gothic we
have
mein leik
and
leik meinata
.

§ 406
. Now by assuming the extension of the
Middle High German omission of the inflection to the Anglo-Saxon; and by
supposing it to affect the words in question in
all
positions
(
i.e.
, both before and after their nouns), we may explain the
constructions in question, in case they occur. But, as already stated, no
instances of them have been quoted.

To suppose
two
adjectival forms, one inflected (
min
,

minre
, &c.), and one uninflected, or common to all genders and
both numbers (
min
), is to suppose no more than is the case with
the uninflected
þe
, as compared with the inflected
þæt
.

§ 407
. Hence, the evidence required in order to
make a single instance of
min
or
þin
, the
necessary

equivalents to
mei
and
tui
, rather than to
meus
and

tuus
, must consist in the quotation from the Anglo-Saxon of some

[290]
text, wherein
min
or
þin

occurs with a feminine substantive, in an
oblique
case, the
pronoun
preceding
the noun. When this has been done, it will be
time enough to treat
mine
and
thine
as the equivalents to

mei
and
tui
, rather than as those to
meus
and

tuus
.

[291]

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE WEAK PRÆTERITE.

§ 408
. The remote origin of the weak præterite
in
-d
or
-t
, has been considered by Grimm. He maintains
that it is the
d
in
d-d
, the reduplicate præterite of

do
. In all the Gothic languages the termination of the past tense
is either
-da
,
-ta
,
-de
,
-ði
,
-d
,

-t
, or
-ed
, for the singular, and
-don
,
-ton
,

-tûmês
, or
-ðum
, for the plural; in other words,
d
,
or an allied sound, appears once, if not oftener. In the
plural

præterite of the
Mœso-Gothic
, however, we have something
more,
viz.
, the termination
-dêdum
; as
nas-idêdum
,

nas-idêduþ
,
nas-idedun
, from
nas-ja
;

sôk-idêdum
,
sôk-idêduþ
,
sôk-idêdun
, from

sôk-ja
;
salb-ôdedum
,
salb-ôdêduþ
,

salb-ôdêdun
, from
salbô
. Here there is a second
d
.
The same takes place with the dual form
salb-ôdêduts
, and with the
subjunctive forms,
salb-ôdêdjan
,
salb-ôdêduts
,

salb-ôdedi
,
salb-ôdêdeits
,
salb-ôdêdeima
,

salb-ôdedeiþ
,
salb-ôdedina
. The English phrase,
we did
salve
, as compared with
salb-ôdedum
, is confirmatory of
this.

§ 409
. Some remarks of Dr. Trithen's on the
Slavonic præterite, in the "Transactions of the Philological Society,"
induce me to prefer a different doctrine, and to identify the
-d

in words like
moved
, &c., with the
-t
of the passive
participles of the Latin language; as found in mon-
it
-us,
voc-
at
-us, rap-
t
-us, and probably in Greek forms like
τυφ-θ-είς
.
[292]

1. The Slavonic præterite is commonly said to possess genders: in
other words, there is one form for speaking of a past action when done by
a male, and another for speaking of a past action when done by a
female.

2. These forms are identical with those of the participles, masculine
or feminine, as the case may be. Indeed the præterite is a participle.
If, instead of saying
ille amavit
, the Latins said
ille
amatus
, whilst, instead of saying
illa amavit
, they said

illa amata
, they would exactly use the grammar of the
Slavonians.

3. Hence, as one class of languages, at least, gives us the undoubted
fact of an active præterite being identical with a passive participle,
and as the participle and præterite in question are nearly identical, we
have a fair reason for believing that the
d
, in the English active
præterite, is the
d
of the participle, which in its turn, is the

t
of the Latin passive participle.

§ 410
. The following extract gives Dr. Trithen's
remarks on the Slavonic verb in his own words:—

"A peculiarity which distinguishes the grammar of all the Slavish
languages, consists in the use of the past participle, taken in an active
sense, for the purpose of expressing the præterite. This participle
generally ends in
l
; and much uncertainty prevails both as to its
origin and its relations, though the termination has been compared by
various philologists with similar affixes in the Sanscrit, and the
classical languages.

"In the Old Slavish, or the language of the church, there are three
methods of expressing the past tense: one of them consists in the union
of the verb substantive with the participle; as,

Rek esm'

chital esmi'

Rek esi'
chital esi'

Rek est'
chital est'
.

"In the corresponding tense of the Slavonic dialect we have the verb
substantive placed before the participle:
[293]

Ya sam imao
mi' smo imali

Ti si imao
vi' ste imali

On ye imao
omi su imali
.

"In the Polish it appears as a suffix:

Czytalem

czytalismy

Czytales
czytaliscie

Czytal
czytalie
.

"And in the Servian it follows the participle:

Igrao sam

igrali smo

Igrao si
igrali ste

Igrao ye
igrali su
.

"The ending
-ao
, of
igrao
and
imao
, stands for
the Russian
al
, as in some English dialects a' is used for

all
."

[294]

PART V.

SYNTAX.

CHAPTER I.

ON SYNTAX IN GENERAL.

§ 411
. The word
syntax
is derived from
the Greek
syn
(
with
or
together
) and
taxis

(
arrangement
). It relates to the arrangement, or putting together,
of words. Two or more words must be used before there can be any
application of syntax.

There is to me a father.
—Here we have a circumlocution
equivalent to
I have a father
. In the English language the
circumlocution is unnatural. In the Latin it is common. To determine
this, is a matter of idiom rather than of syntax.

§ 412
. In the English, as in all other
languages, it is convenient to notice certain so-called figures of
speech. They always furnish convenient modes of expression, and
sometimes, as in the case of the one immediately about to be noticed,

account
for facts.

§ 413
.
Personification.
—The ideas
of apposition and collectiveness account for the apparent violations of
the concord of number. The idea of personification applies to the concord
of gender. A masculine or feminine
[295]
gender, characteristic
of persons, may be substituted for the neuter gender, characteristic of
things. In this case the term is said to be personified.

The cities who aspired to liberty.
—A personification of
the idea expressed by cities is here necessary to justify the
expression.

It
, the sign of the neuter gender, as applied to a male or
female
child
, is the reverse of the process.

§ 414
.
Ellipsis
(from the Greek

elleipein
=
to fall short
), or a
falling short
,
occurs in sentences like
I sent to the bookseller's
. Here the word

shop
or
house
is understood. Expressions like
to go on
all fours
, and
to eat of the fruit of the tree
, are reducible
to ellipses.

§ 415
.
Pleonasm
(from the Greek

pleoazein
=
to be in excess
) occurs in sentences like

the king, he reigns
. Here the word
he
is superabundant.

My banks, they are furnished
,—
the most straitest
sect
,—these are pleonastic expressions. In
the king, he
reigns
, the word
king
is in the same predicament as in
the
king, God bless him
.

The double negative, allowed in Greek and Anglo-Saxon, but not
admissible in English, is pleonastic.

The verb
do
, in
I do speak
, is
not
pleonastic. In
respect to the sense it adds intensity. In respect to the construction it
is not in apposition, but in the same predicament with verbs like

must
and
should
, as in
I must go
, &c.;

i.e.
, it is a verb followed by an infinitive. This we know from
its power in those languages where the infinitive has a characteristic
sign; as, in German,

Die Augen
thaten
ihm winken.—
Goethe.

Besides this,
make
is similarly used in Old
English,—
But men make draw the branch thereof, and beren him to
be graffed at Babyloyne.
—Sir J. Mandeville.

§ 416
.
The figure zeugma.
—
They
wear a garment
[296]
like that of the Scythians, but a language
peculiar to themselves.
—The verb, naturally applying to

garment
only, is here used to govern
language
. This is
called in Greek,
zeugma
(junction).

§ 417
.
My paternal home was made desolate,
and he himself was sacrificed.
—The sense of this is plain;

he
means
my father
. Yet no such substantive as

father
has gone before. It is supplied, however, from the word

paternal
. The sense indicated by
paternal
gives us a
subject to which he can refer. In other words, the word
he
is
understood, according to what is indicated, rather than according to what
is expressed. This figure in Greek is called
pros to semainomenon

(
according to the thing indicated
).

§ 418
.—
Apposition,
—
Cæsar,
the Roman emperor, invades Britain.
—-Here the words
Roman
emperor
explain, or define, the word
Cæsar
; and the sentence,
filled up, might stand,
Cæsar, that is, the Roman emperor
, &c.
Again, the
words

Roman emperor
might be wholly ejected; or, if not
ejected, they might be thrown into a parenthesis. The practical bearing
of this fact is exhibited by changing the form of the sentence, and
inserting the conjunction
and
. In this case, instead of one
person, two are spoken of, and the verb
invades
must be changed
from the singular to the plural.

Now the words
Roman emperor
are said to be in apposition to

Cæsar
. They constitute, not an additional idea, but an explanation
of the original one. They are, as it were,
laid alongside

(
appositi
) of the word
Cæsar
. Cases of doubtful number,
wherein two substantives precede a verb, and wherein it is uncertain
whether the verb should be singular or plural, are decided by determining
whether the substantives be in apposition or the contrary. No matter how
many nouns there may be, as long as it
[297]
can be shown that they
are in apposition, the verb is in the singular number.

§ 419
.
Collectiveness as opposed to
plurality.
—In sentences like
the meeting
was

large
,
the multitude
pursue
pleasure
,
meeting

and
multitude
are each collective nouns; that is, although they
present the idea of a single object, that object consists of a plurality
of individuals. Hence,
pursue
is put in the plural number. To say,
however,
the meeting were large
would sound improper. The number
of the verb that shall accompany a collective noun depends upon whether
the idea of the multiplicity of individuals, or that of the unity of the
aggregate, shall predominate.

Sand and salt and a mass of iron
is
easier to bear than a
man without understanding.
—Let
sand and salt and a mass of
iron
be dealt with as a series of things the aggregate of which forms
a mixture, and the expression is allowable.

The king and the lords and commons
forms
an excellent frame
of government.
—Here the expression is doubtful. Substitute

with
for the first
and
, and there is no doubt as to the
propriety of the singular form
is
.

§ 420
.
The reduction of complex forms to
simple ones.
—Take, for instance, the current illustration,
viz.,
the-king-of-Saxony's army
.—Here the assertion is, not
that the army belongs to
Saxony
, but that it belongs to the

king of Saxony
; which words must, for the sake of taking a true
view of the construction, be dealt with as a single word in the
possessive case. Here two cases are dealt with as one; and a complex term
is treated as a single word.

The same reason applies to phrases like
the two king Williams
.
If we say the
two kings William
, we must account for the phrase by
apposition.
[298]

§ 421
.
True notion of the part of speech in
use.
—In
he is gone
, the word
gone
must be
considered as equivalent to
absent
; that is, as an adjective.
Otherwise the expression is as incorrect as the expression
she is
eloped
. Strong participles are adjectival oftener than weak ones:
their form being common to many adjectives.

True notion of the original form.
—In the phrase
I must
speak
, the word
speak

is
an infinitive. In the phrase
I am forced to speak
, the
word
speak
is (in the present English) an infinitive also. In one
case, however, it is preceded by
to
; whilst in the other, the
particle
to
is absent. The reason for this lies in the original
difference of form.
Speak
-
to
= the Anglo-Saxon

sprécan
, a simple infinitive;
to speak
, or
speak
+

to
= the Anglo-Saxon
to sprécanne
, an infinitive in the
dative case.

§ 422
.
Convertibility.
—In the
English language, the greater part of the words may, as far as their form
is concerned, be one part of speech as well as another. Thus the
combinations
s-a-n-th
, or
f-r-e-n-k
, if they existed at
all, might exist as either nouns or verbs, as either substantives or
adjectives, as conjunctions, adverbs, or prepositions. This is not the
case in the Greek languages. There, if a word be a substantive, it will
probably end in
-s
; if an infinitive verb, in
-ein
, &c.
The bearings of this difference between languages like the English and
languages like the Greek will soon appear.

At present, it is sufficient to say that a word, originally one part
of speech (
e.g.
, a noun), may become another (
e.g.
, a
verb). This may be called the convertibility of words.

There is an etymological convertibility, and a syntactic
convertibility; and although, in some cases, the
[299]
line of demarcation is
not easily drawn between them, the distinction is intelligible and
convenient.

§ 423
.
Etymological
convertibility.
—The words
then
and
than
, now
adverbs or conjunctions, were once cases: in other words, they have been
converted from one part of speech to another. Or, they may even be said
to be cases, at the present moment; although only in an historical point
of view. For the practice of language, they are not only adverbs or
conjunctions, but they are adverbs or conjunctions exclusively.

§ 424
.
Syntactic
convertibility.
—The combination
to err
, is at this
moment an infinitive verb. Nevertheless it can be used as the equivalent
to the substantive
error
.

To err is human
=
error is human
. Now this is an
instance of syntactic conversion. Of the two meanings, there is no doubt
as to which is the primary one; which primary meaning is part and parcel
of the language at this moment.

The infinitive, when used as a substantive, can be used in a singular
form only.

To err
=
error
; but we have no such form as
to
errs
=
errors
. Nor is it wanted. The infinitive, in a
substantival sense, always conveys a general statement, so that even when
singular, it has a plural power; just as
man is mortal
=
men
are mortal
.

§ 425
.
The adjective used as a
substantive.
—Of these, we have examples in expressions like the

blacks of Africa
—
the bitters and sweets of
life
—
all fours were put to the ground
. These are true
instances of conversion, and are proved to be so by the fact of their
taking a plural form.

Let the blind lead the blind
is not an instance of conversion.
The word
blind
in both instances remains
[300]
an adjective, and is
shown to remain so by its being uninflected.

§ 426
.
Uninflected parts of speech, used as
substantive.
—When King Richard III. says,
none of your
ifs
, he uses the word
if
as a substantive =
expressions of
doubt
.

So in the expression
one long now
, the word
now
=

present time
.

§ 427
. The convertibility of words in English is
very great; and it is so because the structure of the language favours
it. As few words have any peculiar signs expressive of their being
particular parts of speech, interchange is easy, and conversion follows
the logical association of ideas unimpeded.

The convertibility of words is in the inverse ratio to the amount
of their inflection.

[301]

CHAPTER II.

SYNTAX OF SUBSTANTIVES.

§ 428
. The phenomena of convertibility have been
already explained.

The remaining points connected with the syntax of substantives, are
chiefly points of ellipsis.

Ellipsis of substantives.
—The historical view of phrases,
like
Rundell and Bridge's
,
St. Paul's
, &c., shows that
this ellipsis is common to the English and the other Gothic languages.
Furthermore, it shows that it is met with in languages not of the Gothic
stock; and, finally, that the class of words to which it applies, is,
there or thereabouts, the same generally.

§ 429
. The following phrases are referable to a
different class of relations—

1.
Right and left
—supply
hand
. This is, probably,
a real ellipsis. The words
right
and
left
, have not yet
become true substantives; inasmuch as they have no plural forms. In this
respect they stand in contrast with
bitter
and
sweet
;
inasmuch as we can say
he has tasted both the bitters and sweets of
life
. Nevertheless, the expression can be refined on.

2.
All fours
.
To go on all fours.
No ellipsis. The word

fours
is a true substantive, as proved by its existence as a
plural.

[302]

CHAPTER III.

SYNTAX OF ADJECTIVES.

§ 430
.
Pleonasm.
—Pleonasm can take
place with adjectives only in the expression of the degrees of
comparison. Over and above the etymological signs of the comparative and
superlative degrees, there may be used the superlative words
more

and
most
.

And this pleonasm really occurs—

The
more serener
spirit
.

The
most straitest
sect
.

These are instances of pleonasm in the strictest sense of the
term.

§ 431
. Collocation.—As a general rule, the
adjective precedes the substantive—
a good man
, not
a man
good
.

When, however, the adjective is qualified by either the expression of
its degree, or accompanied by another adjective, it may follow the
substantive—

A man
just and good
.

A woman
wise and fair
.

A hero
devoted to his country
.

A patriot
disinterested to a great degree
.

Single simple
adjectives thus placed after their substantive,
belong to the poetry of England, and especially to the ballad
poetry—
sighs profound
—
the leaves green
.

§ 432
.
Government.
—The only
adjective that governs a case, is the word
like
. In the
expression,
this is like
[303]
him
, &c., the original power of
the dative remains. This we infer—

1. From the fact that in most languages which have inflections to a
sufficient extent, the word meaning
like
governs a dative
case.

2. That if ever we use in English any preposition at all to express
similitude, it is the preposition
to
—
like to me
,

like to death
, &c.

Expressions like
full of meat
,
good for John
, are by no
means instances of the government of adjectives; the really governing
words being the prepositions
to
and
for
respectively.

§ 433
. The positive degree preceded by the
adjective
more
, is equivalent to the comparative
form—
e.g.
,
more wise
=
wiser
.

The reasons for employing one expression in preference to the other,
depend upon the nature of the particular word used.

When the word is at one and the same time of Anglo-Saxon origin and
monosyllabic, there is no doubt about the preference to be given to the
form in
-er
. Thus,
wis-er
is preferable to
more
wise
.

When, however, the word is compound, or trisyllabic, the combination
with the word
more
, is preferable.

more fruitful
fruitfuller
.

more villainous

villainouser
.

Between these two extremes there are several intermediate forms,
wherein the use of one rather than another will depend upon the taste of
the writer. The question, however, is a question of euphony, rather than
of aught else. It is also illustrated by the principle of not multiplying
secondary elements. In such a word as
fruit-full-er
, there are two
additions to the root. The same is the case with the superlative,

fruit-full-est
.
[304]

§ 434
. In the Chapter on the Comparative Degree
is indicated a refinement upon the current notions as to the power of the
comparative degree, and reasons are given for believing that the
fundamental notion expressed by the comparative inflexion is the idea of
comparison or contrast between
two
objects.

In this case, it is better in speaking of only two objects to use the
comparative degree rather than the superlative—even when we use the
definite article
the
. Thus—

This is
the better
of the two

is preferable to

This is
the best
of the two.

This principle is capable of an application more extensive than our
habits of speaking and writing will verify. Thus to go to other parts of
speech, we should logically say—

Whether of the two,

rather than

Which of the two.

Either the father or the son,

but not

Either the father, the son, or the daughter.

This statement may be refined on. It is chiefly made for the sake of
giving fresh prominence to the idea of duality, expressed by the
terminations
-er
and
-ter
.

§ 435
. The absence of inflection simplifies the
syntax of adjectives. Violations of concord are impossible. We could not
make an adjective disagree with its substantive if we wished.

[305]

CHAPTER IV.

SYNTAX OF PRONOUNS.

§ 436
.
Pleonasm in the syntax of
pronouns.
—In the following sentences the words in italics are
pleonastic:

1. The king
he
is just.

2. I saw
her
, the queen.

3. The
men
, they were there.

4. The king,
his
crown.

Of these forms, the first is more common than the second and third,
and the fourth more common than the first.

§ 437
. The fourth has another element of
importance. It has given rise to the absurd notion that the genitive case
in
-'s
(
father-'s
) is a contraction from
his

(
father his
).

To say nothing about the inapplicability of this rule to feminine
genders, and plural numbers, the whole history of the Indo-Germanic
languages is against it.

1. We cannot reduce
the queen's majesty
to
the queen his
majesty
.

2. We cannot reduce
the children's bread
to
the children his
bread
.

3. The Anglo-Saxon forms are in
-es
, not in
his
.

4. The word
his
itself must be accounted for; and that cannot
be done by assuming it to be
he
+
his
.

5. The
-s
in
father's
is the
-is
in

patris
, and the
-ος
in
πατέρος
.
[306]

§ 438
. The preceding examples illustrate an
apparent paradox,
viz.
, the fact of pleonasm and ellipsis being
closely allied.
The king he is just
, dealt with as a
single

sentence, is undoubtedly pleonastic. But it is not necessary to be
considered as a mere simple sentence.
The king
—may represent
a first sentence incomplete, whilst
he is just
represents a second
sentence in full. What is pleonasm in a single sentence is ellipsis in a
double one.

[307]

CHAPTER V.

THE TRUE PERSONAL PRONOUNS.

§ 439
.
Personal pronouns.
—The use
of the second person plural instead of the second singular has been
noticed already. This use of one number for another is current throughout
the Gothic languages. A pronoun so used is conveniently called the

pronomen reverentiæ
.

§ 440
.
Dativus ethicus.
—In the
phrase

Rob me the exchequer,—
Henry IV.
,

the
me
is expletive, and is equivalent to
for me
. This
expletive use of the dative is conveniently called the
dativus
ethicus
.

§ 441
.
The reflected personal
pronoun.
—In the English language there is no equivalent to the
Latin
se
, the German
sich
, and the Scandinavian
sik
,
and
sig
.

It follows from this that the word
self
is used to a greater
extent than would otherwise be the case.

I strike me
is awkward, but not ambiguous.

Thou strikest thee
is awkward, but not ambiguous.

He strikes him
is ambiguous; inasmuch as
him
may mean
either the
person who strikes
or some one else. In order to be
clear we add the word
self
when the idea is reflective.
He
strikes himself
is, at once idiomatic and unequivocal.

So it is with the plural persons.

We strike us
is awkward, but not ambiguous.
[308]

Ye strike you
is the same.

They strike them
is ambiguous.

This shows the value of a reflective pronoun for the third person.

As a general rule, therefore, whenever we use a verb reflectively we
use the word
self
in combination with the personal pronoun.

Yet this was not always the case. The use of the simple personal
pronoun was current in Anglo-Saxon, and that, not only for the first two
persons, but for the third as well.

The exceptions to this rule are either poetical expressions, or
imperative moods.

He sat
him
down at a pillar's base.—
Byron.

Sit thee down.

§ 442
.
Reflective neuters.
—In the
phrase
I strike me
, the verb
strike
is transitive; in other
words, the word
me
expresses the object of an action, and the
meaning is different from the meaning of the simple expression
I
strike
.

In the phrase
I fear me
(used by Lord Campbell in his lives of
the Chancellors), the verb
fear
is intransitive or neuter; in
other words, the word
me
(unless, indeed,
fear
mean

terrify
), expresses no object of any action at all; whilst the
meaning is the same as in the simple expression
I fear
.

Here the reflective pronoun appears out of place,
i.e.
, after a
neuter or intransitive verb.

Such a use, however, is but the fragment of an extensive system of
reflective verbs thus formed, developed in different degrees in the
different Gothic languages; but in all more than in the English.

§ 443
.
Equivocal reflectives.
—The
proper place of the reflective is
after
the verb.
[309]

The proper place of the governing pronoun is, in the indicative and
subjunctive moods,
before
the verb.

Hence in expressions like the preceding there is no doubt as to the
power of the pronoun.

The imperative mood, however, sometimes presents a complication. Here
the governing person may follow the verb.

Mount ye
= either
be mounted
, or
mount
yourselves
. In phrases like this, and in phrases

Busk ye, busk ye
, my bonny, bonny bride,

Busk ye, busk ye
, my winsome marrow,

the construction is ambiguous.
Ye
may either be a nominative
case governing the verb
busk
, or an accusative case governed by
it.

This is an instance of what may be called the
equivocal
reflective
.

[310]

CHAPTER VI.

ON THE SYNTAX OF THE DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS, AND THE PRONOUNS OF THE THIRD PERSON.

§ 444
. As
his
and
her
are genitive
cases (and not adjectives), there is no need of explaining such
combinations as
his mother
,
her father
, inasmuch as no
concord of gender is expected. The expressions are respectively
equivalent to

mater ejus
, not
mater sua
;

pater ejus
,  —
pater suus
.

§ 445
. It has been stated that
its
is a
secondary genitive, and it may be added, that it is of late origin in the
language. The Anglo-Saxon form was
his
, the genitive of
he

for the neuter and masculine equally. Hence, when, in the old writers, we
meet
his
, where we expect
its
, we must not suppose that any
personification takes place, but simply that the old genitive common to
the two genders is used in preference to the modern one limited to the
neuter, and irregularly formed.

The following instances are the latest specimens of its use:

"The apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy. I have read the
cause of
his
effects in Galen;
it
is a kind of
deafness."—
2 Henry IV.
i. 2.
[311]

"If the salt have lost
his
savour, wherewith shall it be
seasoned?
It
is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the
dunghill; but men cast
it
out."—
Luke
xiv. 35.

"Some affirm that every plant has
his
particular fly or
caterpillar, which it breeds and feeds."—
Walton's

Angler
.

"This rule is not so general, but that
it
admitteth of

his
exceptions."—
Carew.

[312]

CHAPTER VII.

ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE WORD SELF.

§ 446
. The undoubted constructions of the word

self
, in the present state of the cultivated English, are
threefold.

1.
Government.
—In
my-self
,
thy-self
,

our-selves
, and
your-selves
, the construction is that of a
common substantive with an adjective or genitive case.
My-self
=

my individuality
, and is similarly construed—
mea
individualitas
(or
persona
), or
mei individualitas
(or

persona
).

2.
Apposition.
—In
him-self
and
them-selves
,
when accusative, the construction is that of a substantive in apposition
with a pronoun.
Himself
=
him
,
the individual
.

3.
Composition.
—It is only, however, when
himself

and
themselves
, are in the
accusative
case, that the
construction is appositional. When they are used as
nominatives
,
it must be explained on another principle. In phrases like

He himself
was present

They themselves
were present,

there is neither apposition nor government;
him
and

them
, being neither related to
my
and
thy
, so as to
be governed, nor yet to
he
and
they
, so as to form an
apposition. In order to come under one of these conditions, the phrases
should be either
he his self
(
they
[313]
their selves
), or
else
he he self
(
they they selves
). In this difficulty, the
only logical view that can be taken of the matter, is to consider the
words
himself
and
themselves
, not as two words, but as a
single word compounded; and even then, the compound will be of an
irregular kind; inasmuch as the inflectional element
-m
is dealt
with as part and parcel of the root.

§ 447
.
Her-self
.—The construction
here is ambiguous. It is one of the preceding constructions. Which,
however it is, is uncertain; since
her
may be either a so-called
genitive, like
my
, or an accusative like
him
.

Itself
—is also ambiguous. The
s
may represent the

-s
in
its
, as well as the
s-
in
self
.

This inconsistency is as old as the Anglo-Saxon stage of the English
language.

[314]

CHAPTER VIII.

ON THE POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS.

§ 448
. The possessive pronouns fall into two
classes. The first contains the forms like
my
and
thy
,
&c.; the second, those like
mine
and
thine
, &c.

My
,
thy
,
his
(as in
his book
),
her
,

its
(as in
its book
),
our
,
your
,

their
, are conveniently considered as the equivalents to the Latin
forms
mei
,
tui
,
ejus
,
nostrum
,

vestrum
,
eorum
.

Mine
,
thine
,
his
(as in
the book is his
),

hers
,
ours
,
yours
,
theirs
are conveniently
considered as the equivalents to the Latin forms
meus
,
mea
,

meum
;
tuus
,
tua
,
tuum
;
suus
,

sua
,
suum
;
noster
,
nostra
,
nostrum
;

vester
,
vestra
,
vestrum
.

§ 449
. There is a difference between the
construction of
my
and
mine
. We cannot say
this is mine
hat
, and we cannot say
this hat is my
. Nevertheless, this
difference is not explained by any change of construction from that of
adjectives to that of cases. As far as the syntax is concerned the
construction of
my
and
mine
is equally that of an adjective

agreeing
with a substantive, and of a genitive (or possessive)
case
governed
by a substantive.

Now a common genitive case can be used in two ways; either as part of
a term, or as a whole term (
i.e.
, absolutely).—1. As part of
a term—
this is John's hat
. 2. As a whole term—
this
hat is John's
.
[315]

And a common adjective can be used in two ways; either as part of a
term, or as a whole term (
i.e.
absolutely).—1. As part of a
term—
these are good hats
. 2. As a whole term—
these
hats are good
.

Now whether we consider
my
, and the words like it, as
adjectives or cases, they possess only
one
of the properties just
illustrated,
i.e.
, they can only be used as part of a
term—
this is my hat
; not
this hat is my
.

And whether we consider
mine
, and the words like it, as
adjectives or cases, they possess only
one
of the properties just
illustrated,
i.e.
, they can only be used as whole terms, or
absolutely—
this hat is mine
; not
this is mine
hat
.

For a full and perfect construction whether of an adjective or a
genitive case, the possessive pronouns present the phenomenon of being,
singly, incomplete, but, nevertheless, complementary to each other when
taken in their two forms.

§ 450
. In the absolute construction of a
genitive case, the term is formed by the single word, only so far as the

expression
is concerned. A substantive is always
understood

from what has preceded.—
This discovery is Newton's
=
this
discovery is Newton's discovery
.

The same with adjectives.—
This weather is fine
=
this
weather is fine weather
.

And the same with absolute pronouns.—
This hat is mine
=

this hat is my hat
; and
this is a hat of mine
=
this is
a hat of my hats
.

§ 451
. In respect to all matters of syntax
considered exclusively, it is so thoroughly a matter of indifference
whether a word be an adjective or a genitive case that Wallis considers
the forms in
-'s
, like
father's
, not as genitive cases but
as adjectives. Looking to the logic of the question alone he is right,
and looking to the
[316]
practical syntax of the question he is
right also. He is only wrong on the etymological side of the
question.

"Nomina substantiva apud nos nullum vel generum vel casuum discrimen
sortiuntur."—p. 76.

"Duo sunt adjectivorum genera, a substantivis immediate descendentia,
quæ semper substantivis suis præponuntur. Primum quidem adjectivum
possessivum libet appellare. Fit autem a quovis substantivo, sive
singulari sive plurali, addito
-s
.—Ut
man's nature
,

the nature of man
, natura humana vel hominis;
men's nature
,
natura humana vel hominum;
Virgil's poems
,
the poems of
Virgil
, poemata Virgilii vel Virgiliana."—p. 89.

[317]

CHAPTER IX.

THE RELATIVE PRONOUNS.

§ 452
. It is necessary that the relative be in
the same
gender
as the antecedent—
the man
who
—
the woman who
—
the thing which
.

§ 453
. It is necessary that the relative be in
the same
number
with the antecedent.

§ 454
. It is
not
necessary for the
relative to be in the same
case
with its antecedent.

1. John,
who
trusts me, comes here.

2. John,
whom
I trust, comes here.

3. John,
whose
confidence I possess, comes here.

4. I trust John
who
trusts me.

§ 455
. The reason why the relative must agree
with its antecedent in both number and gender, whilst it need not agree
with it in case, is found in the following observations.

1. All sentences containing a relative contain two verbs—
John
who
(1)
trusts me
(2)
comes here
.

2. Two verbs express two actions—(1)
trust
(2)

come
.

3. Whilst, however, the actions are two in number, the person or thing
which does or suffers them is single—
John
.

4.

He
(
she
or
it
) is single
ex vi termini
. The
relative expresses the
identity
between the subjects (or objects)

[318]
of the two actions. Thus
who
=

John
, or is another name for John.

5. Things and persons that are one and the same, are of one and the
same gender. The
John
who
trusts
is necessarily of the same
gender with the
John
who
comes
.

6. Things and persons that are one and the same, are of one and the
same number. The number of
Johns
who
trust
, is the same as
the number of
Johns
who
come
. Both these elements of
concord are immutable.

7. But a third element of concord is not immutable. The person or
thing that is an agent in the one part of the sentence, may be the object
of an action in the other. The
John
whom I
trust
may

trust
me also. Hence

a.
I trust John—
John
the object.

b.
John trusts me—
John
the agent.

§ 456
. As the relative is only the antecedent in
another form, it may change its case according to the construction.

1. I trust John—(2)
John
trusts me.

2. I trust John—(2)
He
trusts me.

3. I trust John—(2)
Who
trusts me.

4. John trusts me—(2) I trust
John
.

5. John trusts me—(2) I trust
him
.

6. John trusts me—(2) I trust
whom
.

7. John trusts me—(2)
Whom
I trust.

8. John—(2)
Whom
I trust trusts me.

§ 457
.
The books I want are
here
.—This is a specimen of a true ellipsis. In all such
phrases in
full
, there are
three
essential elements.

1. The first proposition; as
the books are here
.

2. The second proposition; as
I want
.

3. The word which connects the two propositions, and without which,
they naturally make separate, independent, unconnected statements.
[319]

Now, although true and unequivocal ellipses are scarce, the preceding
is one of the most unequivocal kind—the word which connects the two
propositions being wanting.

§ 458
.
When there are two words in a clause,
each capable of being an antecedent, the relative refers to the
latter.

1.
Solomon the son of David that slew Goliah
.—This is
unexceptionable.

2.
Solomon the son of David who built the temple
.—This is
exceptionable.

Nevertheless, it is defensible, on the supposition that

Solomon-the-son-of-David
is a single many-worded name.

[320]

CHAPTER X.

ON THE INTERROGATIVE PRONOUN.

§ 459
. Questions are of two sorts, direct and
oblique.

Direct.
—Who is he?

Oblique.
—Who do you say that he is?

All difficulties about the cases of the interrogative pronoun may be
determined by framing an answer, and observing the case of the word with
which the interrogative coincides. Whatever be the case of this word will
also be the case of the interrogative.

DIRECT.

Qu.

Who
is this?—
Ans.

I.

Qu.

Whose
is this?—
Ans.

His.

Qu.

Whom
do you seek?—
Ans.

Him.

OBLIQUE.

Qu.

Who
do you say that it is?—
Ans.

He.

Qu.

Whose
do you say that it is?—
Ans.

His.

Qu.

Whom
do you say that they seek?—
Ans.

Him.

Note.
—The answer should always be made by means of a
pronoun, as by so doing we distinguish the accusative case from the
nominative.

Note.
—And, if necessary, it should be made in full. Thus
the full answer to
whom do you say that they seek?
is,
I say
that they seek him.

§ 460
. Nevertheless, such expressions as
whom
do
[321]
they say that it is?
are common,
especially in oblique questions.

"And he axed him and seide,
whom
seien the people that I
am?—Thei answereden and seiden, Jon Baptist—and he seide to
hem, But
whom
seien ye that I am?"—
Wiclif
,
Luke
ix.

"Tell me in sadness
whom
she is you love."—
Romeo and
Juliet
, i, 1.

"And as John fulfilled his course, he said,
whom
think ye that
I am?"—
Acts
xiii. 25.

This confusion, however, is exceptionable.

[322]

CHAPTER XI.

THE RECIPROCAL CONSTRUCTION.

§ 461
. In all sentences containing the statement
of a reciprocal or mutual action there are in reality two assertions,

viz.
, the assertion that A.
strikes
(or
loves
) B.,
and the assertion that B.
strikes
(or
loves
) A.; the action
forming one, the reaction another. Hence, if the expressions exactly
coincided with the fact signified, there would always be two
propositions. This, however, is not the habit of language. Hence arises a
more compendious form of expression, giving origin to an ellipsis of a
peculiar kind. Phrases like
Eteocles and Polynices killed each
other
are elliptical, for
Eteocles and Polynices killed—each
the other
. Here the second proposition expands and explains the
first, whilst the first supplies the verb to the second. Each, however,
is elliptic.

§ 462
. This is the syntax. As to the power of
the words
each
and
one
in the expression (
each other

and
one another
), I am not prepared to say that in the common
practice of the English language there is any distinction between them. A
distinction, however, if it existed, would give strength to our language.
Where two persons performed a reciprocal action on another, the
expression might be
one another
; as
Eteocles and Polynices
killed one another
. Where more than two persons were engaged on each
side of a reciprocal action,
[323]
the expression might be
each other
;
as,
the ten champions praised each other
.

This amount of perspicuity is attained, by different processes, in the
French, Spanish, and Scandinavian languages.

1. French.—
Ils
(
i.e.
, A. and B.)
se
battaient—l'un l'autre.

Ils
(A. B. C.)
se
battaient—les uns les autres.
In Spanish,
uno otro
=

l'un l'autre
, and
unos otros
=
les uns les
autres
.

2. Danish.—
Hin
ander = the French
l'un l'autre
;
whilst
hverandre
=
les uns les autres
.

[324]

CHAPTER XII.

THE INDETERMINATE PRONOUNS.

§ 463
. Different nations have different methods
of expressing indeterminate propositions.

Sometimes it is by the use of the passive voice. This is the common
method in Latin and Greek, and is also current in
English—
dicitur
,
λέγεται
,
it is
said
.

Sometimes the verb is reflective—
si dice
=
it says
itself
, Italian.

Sometimes the plural pronoun of the third person is used. This also is
an English locution—
they say
=
the world at large
says
.

Finally, the use of some word =
man
is a common indeterminate
expression.

The word
man
has an indeterminate sense in the Modern German;
as
man sagt
=
they say
.

The word
man
was also used indeterminately in the Old English,
although it is not so used in the Modern.

In the Old English, the form
man
often lost the
-n
, and
became
me
.—"Deutsche Grammatik." This form is also
extinct.

§ 464
. The present indeterminate pronoun is

one
; as
one says
=
they say
=
it is said
=

man sagt
, German =
on dit
, French =
si dice
,
Italian.

It has been stated, that the indeterminate pronoun
one
has no
etymological connection with the numeral
one
; but that it is
derived from the French
on
=
homme

[325]
=
homo
=

man
; and that it has replaced the Old English
man
or

me
.

§ 465
. Two other pronouns, or, to speak more in
accordance with the present habit of the English language, one pronoun,
and one adverb of pronominal origin, are also used indeterminately,

viz.
,
it
and
there
.

§ 466
.
It
can be either the subject or
the predicate of a sentence,—
it is this
,
this is it
,

I am it
,
it is I
. When
it
is the subject of a
proposition, the verb necessarily agrees with it, and can be of the
singular number only; no matter what be the number of the
predicate—
it is this
,
it is these
.

When
it
is the predicate of a proposition, the number of the
verb depends upon the number of the subject. These points of universal
syntax are mentioned here for the sake of illustrating some anomalous
forms.

§ 467
.
There
can only be the predicate of
a subject. It differs from
it
in this respect. It follows also
that it must differ from
it
in never affecting the number of the
verb. This is determined by the nature of the subject—
there is
this
,
there are these
.

When we say
there is these
, the analogy between the words

these
and
it
misleads us; the expression being
illogical.

Furthermore, although a predicate,
there
always stands in the
beginning of propositions,
i.e.
, in the place of the subject. This
also misleads.

§ 468
. Although
it
, when the subject,
being itself singular, absolutely requires that its verb should be
singular also, there is a tendency to use it incorrectly, and to treat it
as a plural. Thus, in German, when the predicate is plural, the verb
joined to the singular form
es
( =
it
) is
plural—
es sind menschen
, literally translated =
it are
men
; which, though bad English, is good German.

[326]

CHAPTER XIII.

THE ARTICLES.

§ 469
. The rule of most practical importance
about the articles is the rule that determines when the article shall be
repeated as often as there is a fresh substantive, and when it shall
not.

When two or more substantives following each other denote the same
object, the article precedes the first only. We say,
the secretary and
treasurer
(or,
a secretary and treasurer
), when the two
offices are held by one person.

When two or more substantives following each other denote different
objects, the article is repeated, and precedes each. We say,
the

(or
a
)
secretary and the
(or
a
)
treasurer
,
when the two offices are held by different persons.

This rule is much neglected.

[327]

CHAPTER XIV.

THE NUMERALS.

§ 470
. The numeral
one
is naturally
single. All the rest are naturally plural.

Nevertheless such expressions—
one two
( =
one
collection of two
),
two threes
( =
two collections of
three
) are legitimate. These are so, because the sense of the word is
changed. We may talk of several
ones
just as we may talk of
several
aces
; and of
one two
just as of
one
pair
.

Expressions like
the thousand-and-first
are incorrect. They
mean neither one thing nor another: 1001st being expressed by
the
thousand-and-first
, and 1000th + 1st being expressed by
the
thousandth and the first
.

Here it may be noticed that, although I never found it to do so, the
word
odd
is capable of taking an ordinal form. The

thousand-and-odd-th
is as good an expression as the

thousand-and-eight-th
.

The construction of phrases like the
thousand-and-first
is the
same construction as we find in the
king of Saxony's army
.

§ 471
. It is by no means a matter of
indifference whether we say the
two first
or the
first
two
.

The captains of two different classes at school should be called the

two first boys
. The first and second boys of the same class should
be called the
first two boys
. I believe that when this rule is
attended to, more is due to the printer than to the author: such, at
least, is the case with myself.

[328]

CHAPTER XV.

ON VERBS IN GENERAL.

§ 472
. For the purposes of syntax it is
necessary to divide verbs into the five following divisions: transitive,
intransitive, auxiliary, substantive, and impersonal.

Transitive verbs.
—In transitive verbs the action is never
a simple action. It always affects some object or other,—
I move
my limbs
;
I strike my enemy
. The presence of a transitive verb
implies also the presence of a noun; which noun is the name of the object
affected. A transitive verb, unaccompanied by a noun, either expressed or
understood, is a contradiction in terms. The absence of the nouns, in and
of itself, makes it intransitive.
I move
means, simply,
I am in
a state of moving
.
I strike
means, simply,
I am in the act
of striking
. Verbs like
move
and
strike
are naturally
transitive.

Intransitive verbs.
—An act may take place, and yet no
object be affected by it.
To hunger
,
to thirst
,
to
sleep
,
to wake
, are verbs that indicate states of being,
rather than actions affecting objects. Verbs like
hunger
and

sleep
are naturally intransitive.

Many verbs, naturally transitive, may be used as
intransitive,—
e.g.
,
I move
,
I strike
,
&c.

Many verbs, naturally intransitive, may be used as
transitives,—
e.g.
,
I walked the horse
=
I made the
horse walk
.

This variation in the use of one and the same verb
[329]
is of much
importance in the question of the government of verbs.

A. Transitive verbs are naturally followed by some noun or other; and
that noun is
always
the name of something affected by them
as
an object
.

B. Intransitive verbs are not naturally followed by any noun at all;
and when they are so followed, the noun is
never
the name of
anything affected by them
as an object
.

Nevertheless, intransitive verbs may be followed by nouns denoting the
manner, degree, or instrumentality of their action,—
I walk with
my feet
=
incedo pedibus
.

§ 473
.
The auxiliary verbs
will be
noticed fully in Chapter
XXIII
.

§ 474
. The verb
substantive
has this
peculiarity,
viz.
, that for all purposes of syntax it is no verb
at all.
I speak
may, logically, be reduced to
I am
speaking
; in which case it is only the
part
of a verb.
Etymologically, indeed, the verb substantive is a verb; inasmuch as it is
inflected as such: but for the purposes of construction, it is a copula
only,
i.e.
, it merely denotes the agreement or disagreement
between the subject and the predicate.

For the
impersonal
verbs see Chapter
XXI
.

[330]

CHAPTER XVI.

THE CONCORD OF VERBS.

§ 475
. The verb must agree with its subject in
person,
I walk
, not
I walks
:
he walks
, not
he
walk
.

It must also agree with it in number,—
we walk
, not
we
walks
:
he walks
, not
he walk
.

Clear as these rules are, they require some expansion before they
become sufficient to solve all the doubtful points of English syntax
connected with the concord of the verb.

A.
It is I, your master, who command you
. Query? would
it is
I, your master, who commands you
, be correct? This is an example of a
disputed point of concord in respect to the person of the verb.

B.
The wages of sin is death
. Query? would
the wages of sin

are
death
be correct? This is an example of a disputed point
of concord in respect to the number of the verb.

§ 476
. In respect to the concord of person the
following rules will carry us through a portion of the difficulties.

Rule.
—In sentences where there is but one proposition,
when a noun and a pronoun of different persons are in apposition, the
verb agrees with the first of them,—
I, your master, command
you
(not
commands
):
your master, I, commands you
(not

command
).

To understand the nature of the difficulty, it is
[331]
necessary to
remember that subjects may be extremely complex as well as perfectly
simple; and that a complex subject may contain, at one and the same time,
a noun substantive and a pronoun,—
I, the keeper
;
he, the
merchant
, &c.

Now all noun-substantives are naturally of the third
person—
John speaks
,
the men run
,
the commander
gives orders
. Consequently the verb is of the third person also.

But the pronoun with which such a noun-substantive may be placed in
apposition, may be a pronoun of either person, the first or second:

I
or
thou
—
I the commander
—
thou the
commander
.—In this case the construction requires
consideration. With which does the verb agree? with the substantive which
requires a third person? or with the pronoun which requires a first or
second?

Undoubtedly the idea which comes first is the leading idea; and,
undoubtedly, the idea which explains, qualifies, or defines it, is the
subordinate idea: and, undoubtedly, it is the leading idea which
determines the construction of the verb. We may illustrate this from the
analogy of a similar construction in respect to number—
a man
with a horse and a gig meets me on the road
. Here the ideas are
three; nevertheless the verb is singular. No addition of subordinate
elements interferes with the construction that is determined by the
leading idea. In the expression
I, your master
, the ideas are two;

viz.
, the idea expressed by
I
, and the idea expressed by

master
. Nevertheless, as the one only explains or defines the
other, the construction is the same as if the idea were single.
Your
master, I
, is in the same condition. The general statement is made
concerning the
master
, and it is intended to say what
he

does. The word
I
merely
[332]
defines the expression by stating who the
master is. Of the two expressions the latter is the awkwardest. The
construction, however, is the same for both.

From the analysis of the structure of complex subjects of the kind in
question, combined with a rule concerning the position of the subject,
which will soon be laid down, I believe that, for all single
propositions, the foregoing rule is absolute.

Rule.
—In all single propositions the verb agrees in
person with the noun (whether substantive or pronoun) which comes
first.

§ 477
. But the expression
it is I your
master, who command
(or
commands
) you, is not a single
proposition. It is a sentence containing two propositions.

1.
It is I.

2.
Who commands you.

Here the word
master
is, so to say, undistributed. It may
belong to either clause of the sentence,
i.e.
, the whole sentence
may be divided into

Either—
it is I your master
—

Or—
your master who commands you
.

This is the first point to observe. The next is that the verb in the
second clause (
command
or
commands
) is governed, not by
either the personal pronoun or the substantive, but by the relative,

i.e.
, in the particular case before us, not by either
I
or

master
, but by
who
.

And this brings us to the following question—with which of the
two antecedents does the
relative
agree? with
I
or with

master
?

This may be answered by the two following rules;—

Rule 1.
—When the two antecedents are in the
[333]
same
proposition, the relative agrees with the first. Thus—

1. It is
I
your
master
—

2. Who
command
you.

Rule 2.
—When the two antecedents are in different
propositions, the relative agrees with the second. Thus—

1. It is
I
—

2. Your
master
who
commands
you.

This, however, is not all. What determines whether the two antecedents
shall be in the same or in different propositions? I believe that the
following rules for what may be called
the distribution of the
substantive antecedent
will bear criticism.

Rule 1.
That when there is any natural connection between the
substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative, the
antecedent belongs to the second clause. Thus, in the expression just
quoted, the word
master
is logically connected with the word

command
; and this fact makes the expression,
It is I your
master who commands you
the better of the two.

Rule 2.
That when there is no natural connection between the
substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative, the
antecedent belongs to the first clause.
It is I, John, who command

(not
commands
)
you
.

To recapitulate, the train of reasoning has been as
follows:—

1. The person of the second verb is the person of the relative.

2. The person of the relative is that of one of two antecedents.

3. Of such two antecedents the relative agrees with the one which
stands in the same proposition with itself.
[334]

4. Which position is determined by the connection or want of
connection between the substantive antecedent and the verb governed by
the relative.

Respecting the person of the verb in the
first
proposition of a
complex sentence there is no doubt.
I, your master, who commands you
to make haste, am
(not
is
)
in a hurry.
Here,
I am in
a hurry
is the first proposition;
who commands you to make
haste
, the second.

It is not difficult to see why the construction of sentences
consisting of two propositions is open to an amount of latitude which is
not admissible in the construction of single propositions. As long as the
different parts of a complex idea are contained within the limits of a
single proposition, their subordinate character is easily discerned.
When, however, they amount to whole propositions, they take the
appearance of being independent members of the sentence.

§ 478
.
The concord of number.
—It is
believed that the following three rules will carry us through all
difficulties of the kind just exhibited.

Rule 1.
That the verb agrees with the subject, and with nothing
but the subject. The only way to justify such an expression as
the
wages of sin is death
, is to consider
death
not as the
subject, but as the predicate; in other words, to consider the
construction to be,
death is the wages of sin
.

Rule 2.
That, except in the case of the word
there
, the
word which comes first is generally the subject.

Rule 3.
That no number of connected singular nouns can govern a
plural verb, unless they be connected by a copulative conjunction.
The
sun
and
moon shine
,—
the sun
in conjunction
with
the moon shines
.

§ 479
.
Plural subjects with singular
predicates.
—-
[335]
The wages of sin
are

death.—Honest men
are
the salt of the earth.

Singular subjects with plural predicates.
—These
constructions are rarer than the preceding: inasmuch as two or more
persons (or things) are oftener spoken of as being equivalent to one,
than one person (or thing) is spoken of as being equivalent to two or
more.

Sixpence
is
twelve halfpennies.

He
is
all head and shoulders.

Vulnera totus
erat
.

Tu
es
deliciæ meæ.

Ἑκτορ, ἀτὰρ σύ μοι ἐσσὶ πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ,

Ἠδὲ κασίγνητος, σὺ δέ μοι θαλερὸς παρακοίτης.

[336]

CHAPTER XVII.

ON THE GOVERNMENT OF VERBS.

§ 480
. The government of verbs is of two sorts,
(1.)
objective
, and (2.)
modal
.

It is objective where the noun which follows the verb is the name of
some object affected by the action of the verb,—as
he strikes
me
;
he wounds the enemy
.

It is modal when the noun which follows the verb is not the name of
any object affected by the verb, but the name of some object explaining
the manner in which the action of the verb takes place, the instrument
with which it is done, the end for which it is done, &c.

The government of all transitive verbs is necessarily objective. It
may also be modal,—
I strike the enemy with the sword
=

ferio hostem gladio
.

The government of all intransitive verbs can only be modal,—
I
walk with the stick
. When we say,
I walk the horse
, the word

walk
has changed its meaning, and signifies
make to walk
,
and is, by the very fact of its being followed by the name of an object,
converted from an intransitive into a transitive verb.

The modal construction may also be called the
adverbial
construction
; because the effect of the noun is akin to that of an
adverb,—
I fight with bravery
=
I fight bravely
:
he
walks a king
=
he walks regally
. The modal (or adverbial)
construction, sometimes takes the appearance of the objective: inasmuch
as intransitive verbs are
[337]
frequently followed by a substantive,

e.g.
,
to sleep the sleep of the righteous
. Here,
nevertheless, this is no proof of government. For a verb to be capable of
governing an objective case, it must be a verb signifying an action
affecting an object; which is not the case here. The sentence means, to

sleep as the righteous sleep
, or
according to the sleep of the
righteous
.

[338]

CHAPTER XVIII.

ON THE PARTICIPLES.

§ 481
. The present participle, or the participle
in
-ing
, must be considered in respect to its relations with the
substantive in
-ing
.
Dying-day
is, probably, no more a
participle than
morning-walk
. In respect to the syntax of such
expressions as the forthcoming, I consider that they are
either

participles or substantives.

1. When substantives, they are in regimen, and govern a genitive
case—
What is the meaning of the lady's holding up her train?

Here the word
holding
=
the act of holding
.—
Quid
est significatio elevationis pallæ de parte fœminæ.

2. When participles, they are in apposition or concord, and would, if
inflected, appear in the same case with the substantive, or pronoun,
preceding them—
What is the meaning of the lady holding up her
train?
Here the word
holding
=
in the act of holding
,
and answers to the Latin
fœminæ elevantis
.—
Quid est
significatio fœminæ elevantis pallam?

§ 482
. The past participle corresponds not with
the Greek form
τυπτόμενος
,
but with the form
τετυμμένος
.

I am beaten
is essentially a combination, expressive not of
present but of past time, just like the Latin
sum verberatus
. Its
Greek equivalent is not
εἰμὶ
τυπτόμενος

=
I am a man in the act of being beaten
, but
εἰμὶ
τετυμμένος

[339]
=
I am a man who has been beaten
.
It is past in respect to the action, though present in respect to the
state brought about by the action. This essentially past element in the
so-called present expression,
I am beaten
, will be again referred
to.

[340]

CHAPTER XIX.

ON THE MOODS.

§ 483
. The infinitive mood is a noun. The
current rule that
when two verbs come together the latter is placed in
the infinitive mood
, means that one verb can govern another only by
converting it into a noun—
I begin to move
=
I begin the
act of moving
. Verbs,
as verbs
, can only come together in the
way of apposition—
I irritate
,
I beat
,
I talk at
him
,
I call him names
, &c.

§ 484
. The construction, however, of English
infinitives is two fold. (1.) Objective. (2.) Gerundial.

When one verb is followed by another without the preposition

to
, the construction must be considered to have grown out of the
objective case, or from the form in
-an
.

Such is the case with the following words, and, probably, with
others:

I may go,
not

I may
to
go.

I might go,
—
I might
to
go.

I can move,
—
I can
to
move.

I could move,
—
I could
to
move.

I will speak,
—
I will
to
speak.

I would speak,
—
I would
to
speak.

I shall wait,
—
I shall
to
wait.

I should wait,
—
I should
to
wait.

Let me go,
—
Let me
to
go.

He let me go,
—
He let me
to
go.

I do speak,
—
I do
to
speak.

[341]

I did speak,
—
I did
to
speak.

I dare go,
—
I dare
to
go.

I durst go,
—
I durst
to
go.

This, in the present English, is the rarer of the two
constructions.

When a verb is followed by another, preceded by the preposition

to
, the construction must be considered to have grown out of the
so-called gerund,
i.e.
, the form in
-nne
,
i.e.
, the
dative case—
I begin to move
. This is the case with the great
majority of English verbs.

§ 485
.
Imperatives
have three
peculiarities. (1.) They can only, in English, be used in the second
person—
go thou on
,
get you gone
, &c.: (2.) They
take pronouns after, instead of before them: (3.) They often omit the
pronoun altogether.

[342]

CHAPTER XX.

ON THE TENSES.

§ 486
. Notwithstanding its name, the present
tense in English does not express a strictly
present
action. It
rather expresses an habitual one.
He speaks well
=
he is a good
speaker
. If a man means to say that he is in the act of speaking, he
says
I am speaking
.

It has also, especially when combined with a subjunctive mood, a
future power—
I beat you
( =
I will beat you
)
if
you don't leave off
.

§ 487
. The English præterite is the equivalent,
not to the Greek perfect but the Greek aorist.
I beat
=
ἔτυψα
not

τέτυφα
. The true perfect is
expressed, in English, by the auxiliary
have
+ the past
participle.

[343]

CHAPTER XXI.

SYNTAX OF THE PERSONS OF VERBS.

§ 488
.
The concord of persons.
—A
difficulty that occurs frequently in the Latin language is rare in
English. In expressions like
ego et ille
followed by a verb, there
arises a question as to the person in which that verb should be used. Is
it to be in the first person in order to agree with
ego
, or in the

third
in order to agree with
ille
? For the sake of laying
down a rule upon these and similar points, the classical grammarians
arrange the persons (as they do the genders) according to their

dignity
, making the verb (or adjective if it be a question of
gender) agree with the most
worthy
. In respect to persons, the
first is more worthy than the second, and the second more worthy than the
third. Hence, the Latins said—

Ego
et
Balbus

sustulimus
manus.

Tu
et
Balbus

sustulistis
manus.

Now, in English, the plural form is the same for all three persons.
Hence we say
I and you are friends
,
you and I are friends
,

I and he are friends
, &c., so that for the practice of
language, the question as to the relative dignity of the three persons is
a matter of indifference.

Nevertheless, it
may
occur even in English. Whenever two or
more pronouns of different persons, and of the
singular
number,
follow each other
disjunctively
, the question of concord arises.

I or you
,—
you or
[344]
he
,—
he or
I
. I believe that, in these cases, the rule is as follows:—

1. Whenever the words
either
or
neither
precede the
pronouns, the verb is in the third person.
Either you or I is in the
wrong
;
neither you nor I is in the wrong
.

2. Whenever the disjunctive is simple (
i.e.
unaccompanied with
the word
either
or
neither
) the verb agrees with the

first
of the two pronouns.

I
(or
he
)
am
in the wrong.

He
(or
I
)
is
in the wrong.

Thou
(or
he
)
art
in the wrong.

He
(or
thou
)
is
in the wrong.

Now, provided that they are correct, it is clear that the English
language knows nothing about the relative degrees of dignity between
these three pronouns; since its habit is to make the verb agree with the
one which is placed first—whatever may be the person. I am strongly
inclined to believe that the same is the case in Latin; in which case (in
the sentence
ego et Balbus sustulimus manus
)
sustulimus

agrees, in person, with
ego
, not because the first person is the
worthiest, but because it comes first in the proposition,

§ 489
. In the Chapter on the Impersonal Verbs,
it is stated that the construction of
me-thinks
is peculiar.

This is because in Anglo-Saxon the word
þincan
=
seem
.
Hence
me-thinks
is
φαίνεταί
μοι
, or
mihi videtur
, and
me
is a

dative
case, not an
accusative
.

The
þencan
=
think
, was, in Anglo-Saxon, a different
word.

[345]

CHAPTER XXII.

ON THE VOICES OF VERBS.

§ 490
. In English there is neither a passive nor
a middle voice.

The following couplet from Dryden's "Mac Flecnoe" exhibits a
construction which requires explanation:—

An ancient fabric, raised to inform the sight,

There stood of yore, and Barbican
it hight
.

Here the word
hight
=
was called
, and seems to present
an instance of the participle being used in a passive sense without the
so-called verb substantive. Yet it does no such thing. The word is no
participle at all; but a simple preterite. Certain verbs are

naturally
either passive or active, as one of two allied meanings
may predominate.
To be called
is passive; so is,
to be
beaten
. But,
to bear as a name
is active; so is,
to take a
beating
. The word,
hight
, is of the same class of verbs with
the Latin
vapulo
; and it is the same as the Latin word,

cluo
.—
Barbican cluit
=
Barbican audivit
=

Barbican it hight
.

[346]

CHAPTER XXIII.

ON THE AUXILIARY VERBS.

§ 491
. The auxiliary verbs, in English, play a
most important part in the syntax of the language. They may be classified
upon a variety of principles. The following, however, are all that need
here be applied.

A.
Classification of auxiliaries according to their inflection or
non-inflectional powers.
—Inflectional auxiliaries are those
that may either replace or be replaced by an inflection. Thus—
I
am struck
= the Latin
ferior
, and the Greek
τύπτομαι
. These
auxiliaries are in the same relation to verbs that prepositions are to
nouns. The inflectional auxiliaries are,—

1.
Have
; equivalent to an inflection in the way of
tense—
I have bitten
=
mo-mordi
.

2.
Shall
; ditto.
I shall call
=
voc-abo
.

3.
Will
; ditto.
I will call
=
voc-abo
.

4.
May
; equivalent to an inflection in the way of mood.
I am
come that I may see
=
venio ut vid-eam
.

5.
Be
; equivalent to an inflection in the way of voice.
To
be beaten
=
verberari
,
τύπτεσθαι
.

6.
Am
,
art
,
is
,
are
; ditto. Also
equivalent to an inflection in the way of tense.
I am moving
=

move-o
.

7.
Was
,
were
; ditto, ditto.
I was beaten
=
ἐ-τύφθην
.
I was moving

=
move-bam
.

Do
,
can
,
must
, and
let
, are
non-inflectional auxiliaries.

B.
Classification of auxiliaries according to their
[347]
non-auxiliary
significations.
—The power of the word
have
in the
combination of
I have a horse
is clear enough. It means
possession. The power of the same word in the combination
I have
been
is not so clear; nevertheless it is a power which has grown out
of the idea of possession. This shows that the power of a verb as an
auxiliary may be a modification of its original power;
i.e.
, of
the power it has in non-auxiliary constructions. Sometimes the difference
is very little: the word
let
, in
let us go
, has its natural
sense of permission unimpaired. Sometimes it is lost altogether.

Can
and
may
exist only as auxiliaries.

1. Auxiliary derived from the idea of
possession—
have
.

2. Auxiliaries derived from the idea of existence—
be
,

is
,
was
.

3. Auxiliary derived from the idea of future destination, dependent
upon circumstances external to the agent—
shall
. There are
etymological reasons for believing that
shall
is no present tense,
but a perfect.

4. Auxiliary derived from the idea of future destination, dependent
upon the volition of the agent—
will
.
Shall
is simply
predictive;
will
is predictive and promissive as well.

5. Auxiliary derived from the idea of power, dependent upon
circumstances external to the agent—
may
.

6. Auxiliary derived from the idea of power, dependent upon
circumstances internal to the agent—
can
.
May
is
simply permissive;
can
is potential. In respect to the idea of
power residing in the agent being the cause which determines a contingent
action,
can
is in the same relation to
may
as
will

is to
shall
.

"
May
et
can
, cum eorum præteritis imperfectis,

might
et
could
, potentiam innuunt: cum hoc tamen
discrimine:
may
et
might
vel de jure
[348]
vel saltem de rei
possibilitate, dicuntur, at
can
et
could
de viribus
agentis."—
Wallis
, p. 107.

7. Auxiliary derived from the idea of sufferance—
let
.

8. Auxiliary derived from the idea of necessity—
must
.

"
Must
necessitatem innuit. Debeo, oportet, necesse est urere,

I must burn
. Aliquando sed rarius in præterito dicitur
must

(quasi ex
must'd
seu
must't
contractum). Sic, si de
præterito dicatur,
he must
(seu
must't
)
be burnt
,
oportebat uri seu necesse habuit ut ureretur."—
Wallis
, 107.

9. Auxiliary derived from the idea of action—
do
.

C.
Classification of auxiliary verbs in respect to their mode of
construction.
—Auxiliary verbs combine with others in three
ways.

1.
With participles.
—
a
) With the present, or
active, participle—
I am speaking
:
b
) With the past,
or passive, participle—
I am beaten
,
I have
beaten
.

2.
With infinitives.
—
a
) With the objective
infinitive—
I can speak
:
b
) With the gerundial
infinitive—
I have to speak
.

3.
With both infinitives and participles.
—
I shall have
done
,
I mean to have done
.

D.
Auxiliary verbs may be classified according to their
effect.
—Thus—
have
makes the combination in which
it appears equivalent to a tense;
be
to a passive form;
may

to a sign of mood, &c.

This sketch of the different lights under which auxiliary verbs may be
viewed, has been written for the sake of illustrating, rather than
exhausting, the subject.

§ 492
. The combination of the auxiliary,

have
, with the past participle requires notice. It is, here,
advisable to make the following classifications.

1. The combination with the participle of a
transitive
[349]
verb.
—
I have ridden the
horse
;
thou hast broken the sword
;
he has smitten the
enemy
.

2. The combination with the participle of an
intransitive

verb,—
I have waited
;
thou hast hungered
;
he has
slept
.

3. The combination with the participle of the verb substantive,
I
have been
;
thou hast been
;
he has been
.

It is by examples of the first of these three divisions that the true
construction is to be shown.

For an object of any sort to be in the possession of a person, it must
previously have existed. If I possess a horse, that horse must have had a
previous existence.

Hence, in all expressions like
I have ridden a horse
, there are
two ideas, a past idea in the participle, and a present idea in the word
denoting possession.

For an object of any sort, affected in a particular manner, to be in
the possession of a person, it must previously have been affected in the
manner required. If I possess a horse that has been ridden, the riding
must have taken place before I mention the fact of the ridden horse being
in my possession; inasmuch as I speak of it as a thing already
done,—the participle,
ridden
, being in the past tense.

I have ridden a horse
=
I have a horse ridden
=
I
have a horse as a ridden horse
, or (changing the gender and dealing
with the word
horse
as a thing)
I have a horse as a ridden
thing
.

In this case the syntax is of the usual sort. (1)
Have
=

own
=
habeo
=
teneo
; (2)
horse
is the
accusative case
equum
; (3)
ridden
is a past participle
agreeing either with
horse
, or
with a word in apposition with
it understood
.

Mark the words in italics. The word
ridden
does not agree with

horse
, since it is of the neuter gender.
[350]
Neither if we said
I
have ridden the horses
, would it agree with
horses
; since it
is of the singular number.

The true construction is arrived at by supplying the word

thing
.
I have a horse as a ridden thing
=
habeo equum
equitatum
(neuter). Here the construction is the same as
triste
lupus stabulis
.

I have horses as a ridden thing
=
habeo equos equitatum

(singular, neuter). Here the construction is—

"Triste ... maturis frugibus imbres,

Arboribus venti, nobis Amaryllidos iræ."

or in Greek—

Δεινὸν γυναιξὶν αἱ δι' ὠδίνων γοναί
.

The classical writers supply instances of this use of
have
.

Compertum habeo
, milites, verba viris virtutem non addere =
I
have discovered
=
I am in possession of the discovery
. Quæ cum
ita sint, satis de Cæsare hoc
dictum habeo
.

The combination of
have
with an intransitive verb is
irreducible to the idea of possession: indeed, it is illogical. In
I
have waited
, we cannot make the idea expressed by the word

waited
the object of the verb
have
or
possess
. The
expression has become a part of language by means of the extension of a
false analogy. It is an instance of an illegitimate imitation.

The combination of
have
with
been
is more illogical
still, and is a stronger instance of the influence of an illegitimate
imitation. In German and Italian, where even
intransitive
verbs
are combined with the equivalents to the English
have

(
haben
, and
avere
), the verb substantive is not so
combined; on the contrary, the combinations are

Italian;
io sono stato
=
I am been
.

German;
ich bin gewesen
=
ditto
.

which is logical.
[351]

§ 493
.
I am to speak
.—Three facts
explain this idiom.

1. The idea of
direction towards an object
conveyed by the
dative case, and by combinations equivalent to it.

2. The extent to which the ideas of necessity, obligation, or
intention are connected with the idea of
something that has to be
done
, or
something towards which some action has a
tendency
.

3. The fact that expressions like the one in question historically
represent an original dative case, or its equivalent; since
to
speak
grows out of the Anglo-Saxon form
to sprecanne
, which,
although called a gerund, is really a dative case of the infinitive
mood.

When Johnson thought that, in the phrase
he is to blame
, the
word
blame
was a noun, if he meant a noun in the way that

culpa
is a noun, his view was wrong. But if he meant a noun in the
way that
culpare
,
ad culpandum
, are nouns, it was
right.

§ 494
.
I am to blame
.—This idiom is
one degree more complex than the previous one; since
I am to blame

=
I am to be blamed
. As early, however, as the Anglo-Saxon period
the gerunds were liable to be used in a passive sense:
he is to
lufigenne
= not
he is to love
, but
he is to be
loved
.

The principle of this confusion may be discovered by considering that

an object to be blamed
, is
an object for some one to blame
,

an object to be loved
is
an object for some one to
love
.

§ 495
.
I am beaten
.—This is a
present combination, and it is present on the strength of the verb

am
, not on the strength of the participle
beaten
, which is
præterite.

The following table exhibits the
expedients
on the part of the
different languages of the Gothic stock,

proper passive form of the Mœso-Gothic.

[353]

CHAPTER XXIV.

THE SYNTAX OF ADVERBS.

§ 496
. The syntax of the adverb is simpler than
that of any other part of speech, excepting, perhaps, that of the
adjective.

Adverbs have no concord.

Neither have they any government. They
seem
, indeed, to have
it, when they are in the comparative or superlative degree; but it is
merely apparent. In
this is better than that
, the word
that

is governed neither by
better
nor by
than
. It is not
governed at all. It is a nominative case; the subject of a separate
proposition.
This is better (i.e., more good) than that is good.

Even if we admit such an expression as
he is stronger than me
to
be good English, there is no adverbial government.
Than
, if it
govern
me
at all, governs it as a preposition.

The position of an adverb is, in respect to matters of syntax,
pre-eminently parenthetic;
i.e.
, it may be omitted without
injuring the construction.
He is fighting—now; he was
fighting—then; he fights—bravely; I am
almost—tired
, &c.

§ 497
. By referring to the Chapter on the
Adverbs, we shall find that the neuter adjective is frequently converted
into an adverb by deflection. As any neuter adjective may be so
deflected, we may justify such expressions as
full
(for

fully
) as
conspicuous
(for
[354]
conspicuously
),
and
peculiar
(for
peculiarly
)
bad grace
, &c. We
are not, however, bound to imitate everything that we can justify.

§ 498
. The termination
-ly
was originally
adjectival. At present it is a derivational syllable by which we can
convert an adjective into an adverb:
brave, brave-ly
. When,
however, the adjective ends in
-ly
already, the formation is
awkward.
I eat my daily bread
is unexceptionable English;
I eat
my bread daily
is exceptionable. One of two things must here take
place: the two syllables
ly
are packed into one (the full
expression being
dai-li-ly
), or else the construction is that of a
neuter adjective deflected.

Adverbs are convertible.
The then men
=
οἱ νῦν
βρότοι
, &c. This will be seen
more clearly in the Chapter on Conjunctions.

§ 499
. It has been remarked that in expressions
like
he sleeps the sleep of the righteous
, the construction is
adverbial. So it is in expressions like
he walked a mile, it weighs a
pound
. The ideas expressed by
mile
and
pound
are not
the names of anything that serves as either object or instrument to the
verb. They only denote the
manner
of the action, and define the
meaning of the verb.

§ 500
.
From whence
,
from
thence
.—This is an expression which, if it have not taken root
in our language, is likely to do so. It is an instance of excess of
expression in the way of syntax; the
-ce
denoting direction

from
a place, and the preposition doing the same. It is not so
important to determine what this construction
is
, as to suggest
what it is
not
. It is
not
an instance of an adverb governed
by a preposition. If the two words be dealt with as logically separate,

whence
(or
thence
) must be a noun =
which place
(or

that
[355]
place
); just as
from then till
now
=
from that time to this
. But if (which is the better
view) the two words be dealt with as one (
i.e.
, as an improper
compound) the preposition
from
has lost its natural power, and
become the element of an adverb.

[356]

CHAPTER XXV.

ON PREPOSITIONS.

§ 501
. All prepositions govern an oblique case.
If a word ceases to do this, it ceases to be a preposition. In the first
of the two following sentences the word
up
is a preposition, in
the second an adverb.

1.
I climbed up the tree.

2.
I climbed up.

All prepositions in English, precede the noun which they govern.
I
climbed up the tree
, never
I climbed the tree up
. This is a
matter not of government, but of collocation. It is the case in most
languages; and, from the frequency of its occurrence, the term

pre-position
(or
pre-fix
) has originated. Nevertheless, it
is by no means a philological necessity. In many languages the
prepositions are
post-positive
, following their noun.

§ 502
. No preposition, in the present English,
governs a genitive case. This remark is made, because expressions like
the
part of the body = pars corporis,—a piece of the bread =
portio panis
, make it appear as if the preposition
of
did so.
The true expression is, that the preposition
of
followed by an
objective case is equivalent in many instances, to the genitive case of
the classical languages.

[357]

CHAPTER XXVI.

ON CONJUNCTIONS.

§ 503
. A conjunction is a part of speech which
connects
propositions
,—
the day is bright
, is one
proposition.
The sun shines
, is another.
The day is bright

because
the sun shines
is a pair of propositions connected by the
conjunction,
because
.

From this it follows, that whenever there is a conjunction, there are
two subjects, two copulas, and two predicates:
i.e.
, two
propositions in all their parts.

But this may be expressed compendiously.
The sun shines, and the
moon shines
may be expressed by the
sun and moon shine
.

Nevertheless, however compendious may be the expression, there are
always two propositions wherever there is one conjunction. A part of
speech that merely combines two words is a preposition,—
the sun
along with the moon shines
.

It is highly important to remember that conjunctions connect
propositions.

It is also highly important to remember that many double propositions
may be expressed so compendiously as to look like one. When this takes
place, and any question arises as to the construction, they must be
exhibited in their fully expanded form,
i.e.
, the second subject,
the second predicate, and the second copula must be supplied. This can
always be done from the first
[358]
proposition,—
he likes you better
than me
=
he likes you better than he likes me
. The
compendious expression of the second proposition is the first point of
note in the syntax of conjunctions.

§ 504
. The second point in the syntax of
conjunctions is the fact of their great convertibility. Most conjunctions
have been developed out of some other part of speech.

The conjunction of comparison,
than
, is derived from the adverb
of time,
then
: which is derived from the accusative singular of
the demonstrative pronoun.

The conjunction,
that
, is derived also from a demonstrative
pronoun.

The conjunction,
therefore
, is a demonstrative pronoun + a
preposition.

The conjunction,
because
, is a substantive governed by a
preposition.

One and the same word, in one and the same sentence, may be a
conjunction or preposition, as the case may be.

All fled but John
.—If this mean
all fled
except

John
, the word
but
is a preposition, the word
John

is an accusative case, and the proposition is single. If instead of

John
, we had a personal pronoun, we should say
all fled but

him.

All fled but John
.—If this mean
all fled but John did
not fly
, the word
but
is a conjunction, the word
John

is a nominative case, and the propositions are two in number. If, instead
of
John
, we had a personal pronoun, we should say,
all fled
but
he.

From the fact of the great convertibility of conjunctions it is often
necessary to determine whether a word be a conjunction or not.
If it
be a conjunction, it cannot govern a case. If it govern a case it is no
conjunction
[359]
but a preposition.
A conjunction
cannot govern a case, for the following reasons,—the word that
follows it
must
be the subject of the second proposition, and as
such, a nominative case.

§ 505
. The third point to determine in the
syntax of conjunctions is the certainty or uncertainty in the mind of the
speaker as to the facts expressed by the propositions which they serve to
connect.

1. Each proposition may contain a certain, definite, absolute
fact—
the day is clear
because
the sun shines
. Here
there is neither doubt nor contingency of either the
day being
clear
, or of the
sun shining
.

Of two propositions one may be the condition of the other—
the
day will be clear
if
the sun shine
. Here, although it is
certain that
if the sun shine the day will be clear
, there is no
certainty of
the sun shining
. Of the two propositions one only
embodies a certain fact, and that is certain only conditionally.

Now an action, wherein there enters any notion of uncertainty, or
indefinitude, and is at the same time connected with another action, is
expressed, not by the indicative mood, but by the subjunctive.
If the
sun
shine (not
shines
)
the day will be clear.

Simple uncertainty will not constitute a subjunctive
construction,—
I am
, perhaps,
in the wrong
.

Neither will simple connection.—
I am wrong
, because

you are right
.

But, the two combined constitute the construction in
question,—
if I
be
wrong, you are right
.

Now, a conjunction that connects two certain propositions may be said
to govern an indicative mood.

And a conjunction that connects an uncertain proposition with a
certain one, may be said to govern a subjunctive mood.
[360]

The government of mood is the only form of government of which
conjunctions are capable.

§ 506
. Previous to the question of the
government of conjunctions in the way of mood, it is necessary to notice
certain points of agreement between them and the relative pronouns;
inasmuch as, in many cases, the relative pronoun exerts the same
government, in the way of determining the mood of the verb, as the
conjunction.

Between the relative pronouns and conjunctions in general there is
this point of connection,—both join propositions. Wherever there is
a relative, there is a second proposition. So there is wherever there is
a conjunction.

Between certain relative pronouns and those particular conjunctions
that govern a subjunctive mood there is also a point of connection. Both
suggest an element of uncertainty or indefinitude. This the relative
pronouns do, through the logical elements common to them and to the
interrogatives: these latter essentially suggesting the idea of doubt.
Wherever the person, or thing, connected with an action, and expressed by
a relative is indefinite, there is room for the use of a subjunctive
mood. Thus—"he that troubled you shall bear his judgment,

whosoever
he
be
."

§ 507
. By considering the nature of such words
as
when
, their origin as relatives on the one hand, and their
conjunctional character on the other hand, we are prepared for finding a
relative element in words like
till
,
until
,
before
,

as long as
, &c. These can all be expanded into expressions
like
until the time when
,
during the time when
, &c.
Hence, in an expression like
seek out his wickedness till thou

find (not
findest
)
none
, the principle
[361]
of the
construction is nearly the same as in
he that troubled you
,
&c., or
vice versâ
.
[64]

§ 508
. In most conditional expressions the
subjunctive mood should follow the conjunction. All the following
expressions are conditional.

1.
Except
I
be
by Silvia in the night,

There is no music in the nightingale.—
Shakspeare.

2. Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord our God,
lest
he

fall
upon
us
with pestilence.—
Old Testament.

3. ——Revenge back on itself recoils.

Let it. I reck not,
so
it
light
well aimed.—
J. Milton.

4.
If
this
be
the case.

5.
Although
my house
be
not so with God.—
Old
Testament.

6. He shall not eat of the holy thing
unless
he
wash
his
flesh with water.—
Old Testament.

Expressions like
except
and
unless
are equally
conditional with words like
if
and
provided that
, since
they are equivalent to
if—not
.

Expressions like
though
and
although
are peculiar. They
join propositions, of which the one is a
primâ facie
reason
against the existence of the other: and this is the conditional element.
In the sentence,
if the children be so badly brought-up, they are not
to be trusted
, the
bad bringing-up
is the reason for their
being
unfit to be trusted
; and, as far as the expression is
concerned,
is admitted to be so
. The only uncertainty lies in the
question as to the degree of the badness of the education. The inference
from it is unequivocal.

[362]

But if, instead of saying
if
, we say
although
, and omit
the word
not
, so that the sentence run
although the children be
so badly brought-up they are to be trusted
, we do two things: we
indicate the general relation of cause and effect that exists between

bad bringing-up
and
unfitness for being trusted
, but we
also, at the same time, take an exception to it in the particular
instance before us. These remarks have been made for the sake of showing
the extent to which words like
though
, &c., are
conditional.

It must be remembered, however, that conjunctions, like the ones
lately quoted, do not govern subjunctive moods because they are
conditional, but because, in the particular condition which they
accompany, there is an element of uncertainty.

§ 509
. This introduces a fresh question.
Conditional conjunctions are of two sorts:—

1. Those which express a condition as an actual fact, and one admitted
as such by the speaker.

2. Those which express a condition as a possible fact, and one which
the speaker either does not admit, or admits only in a qualified
manner.

Since
the children
are
so badly brought-up
,
&c.—This is an instance of the first construction. The speaker
admits as an actual fact the
bad bringing-up of the children
.

If
the children
be
so badly brought-up
,
&c.—This is an instance of the second construction. The speaker
admits as a possible (perhaps, as a probable) fact the
bad bringing-up
of the children
: but he does not adopt it as an indubitable one.

§ 510
. Now, if every conjunction had a fixed
unvariable meaning, there would be no difficulty in determining whether a
condition was absolute, and beyond doubt, or
[363]
possible, and liable to
doubt. But such is not the case.

Although
may precede a proposition which is admitted as well as
one which is doubted.

a.
Although
the children
are, &c.

b.
Although
the children
be, &c.

If
, too, may precede propositions wherein there is no doubt
whatever implied: in other words it may be used instead of

since
.

In some languages this interchange goes farther than in others; in the
Greek, for instance, such is the case with
εἰ
, to a very great extent indeed.

Hence we must look to the meaning of the sentence in general, rather
than to the particular conjunction used.

It is a philological fact that
if
may stand instead of

since
.

It is also a philological fact that when it does so it should be
followed by the indicative mood.

This is written in the way of illustration. What applies to
if

applies to other conjunctions as well.

§ 511
. As a point of practice, the following
method of determining the amount of doubt expressed in a conditional
proposition is useful:—

Insert, immediately after the conjunction, one of the two following
phrases,—(1.)
as is the case
; (2.)
as may or may not be
the case
. By ascertaining which of these two supplements expresses
the meaning of the speaker, we ascertain the mood of the verb which
follows.

When the first formula is the one required, there is no element of
doubt, and the verb should be in the indicative mood.
If
(
as is
the case
),
he
is
gone, I must follow him
.
[364]

When the second formula is the one required, there
is
an
element of doubt, and the verb should be in the subjunctive mood.

If
(
as may or may not be the case
)
he
be
gone, I
must follow him
.

§ 512
. The use of the word
that
in
expressions like
I eat that I may live
, &c., is a modification
of the subjunctive construction, that is conveniently called

potential
. It denotes that one act is done for the sake of
supplying the
power
or opportunity for the performance of
another.

The most important point connected with the powers of
that
is
the so-called
succession of tenses
.

§ 513
.
The succession of
tenses.
—Whenever the conjunction
that
expresses
intention, and consequently connects two verbs, the second of which takes
place
after
the first, the verbs in question must be in the same
tense.

I
do
this
that
I
may
gain by it

I
did
this
that
I
might
gain by it.

In the Greek language this is expressed by a difference of mood; the
subjunctive being the construction equivalent to
may
, the optative
to
might
. The Latin idiom coincides with the English.

A little consideration will show that this rule is absolute. For a man

to be doing
one action (in present time) in order that some other
action may
follow
it (in past time) is to reverse the order of
cause and effect. To do anything in
A.D.
1851,
that something may result from it in 1850 is a contradiction; and so it
is to say
I
do
this
that
I
might
gain by
it
.

The reasons against the converse construction are nearly, if not
equally cogent. To have done anything at any
previous
time in
order that a
present
effect may follow, is,
ipso facto
, to
convert a past act into a present one, or, to speak in the language of
the grammarian, to convert
[365]
an aorist into a perfect. To say
I

did
this
that
I may gain by it
, is to make, by the very
effect of the expression, either
may
equivalent to
might
,
or
did
equivalent to
have done
.

I
did
this
that
I
might
gain
.

I
have done
this
that
I
may
gain
.

§ 514
.
Disjunctives.
—Disjunctives
(
or
,
nor
) are of two sorts, real and nominal.

A king or queen always rules in England
. Here the disjunction
is real;
king
or
queen
being different names for different
objects. In all
real
disjunctions the inference is, that if one
out of two (or more) individuals (or classes) do not perform a certain
action, the other does.

A sovereign or supreme ruler always rules in England
. Here the
disjunction is nominal;
sovereign
and
supreme governor

being different names for the same object. In all nominal disjunctives
the inference is, that if an agent (or agents) do not perform a certain
action under one name, he does (or they do) it under another.

Nominal disjunctives are called by Harris
sub
disjunctives.

In the English language there is no separate word to distinguish the
nominal from the real disjunctive. In Latin,
vel
is considered by
Harris to be disjunctive,
sive
subdisjunctive. As a periphrasis,
the combination
in other words
is subdisjunctive.

Both nominal and real disjunctives agree in this,—whatever may
be the number of nouns which they connect, the construction of the verb
is the same as if there were but one—Henry,
or
John,

or
Thomas,
walks
(not
walk
); the sun,
or

solar luminary,
shines
(not
shine
). The disjunctive

isolates
the subject, however much it may be placed in
juxtaposition with other nouns.

[366]

CHAPTER XXVII.

THE SYNTAX OF THE NEGATIVE.

§ 515
. When the verb is in the infinitive mood,
the negative precedes it.—
Not to advance is to retreat
.

When the verb is not in the infinitive mood, the negative follows
it.—
He advanced not
.
I cannot
.

This rule is absolute. It only
seems
to precede the verb in
such expressions as
I do not advance
,
I cannot advance
,

I have not advanced
, &c. However, the words
do
,

can
, and
have
, are no infinitives; and it consequently
follows them. The word
advance
is an infinitive, and it
consequently precedes it. Wallis's rule makes an equivalent statement,
although differently. "Adverbium negandi
not
(non) verbo
postponitur (nempe auxiliari primo si adsit; aut si non adsit auxiliare,
verbo principali): aliis tamen orationis partibus præfigi
solet."—P. 113.

That the negative is rarely used, except with an auxiliary, in other
words, that the presence of a negative converts a simple form like
it
burneth not
into the circumlocution it
does not burn
, is a
fact in the practice of the English language. The syntax is the same in
either expression.

§ 516
. What may be called the

distribution
of the negative is pretty regular in English. Thus,
when the word
not
comes between an indicative, imperative, or
subjunctive mood and an infinitive verb, it almost
[367]
always is taken with
the word which it
follows
—
I can not eat
may mean
either
I can—not eat
(
i.e.
,
I can abstain
), or

I can not—eat
(
i.e.
,
I am unable to eat
); but,
as stated above, it
almost
always has the latter
signification.

But not
always
. In Byron's "Deformed Transformed" we find the
following lines:—

Clay! not dead but soulless,

Though no mortal man would choose thee,

An immortal no less

Deigns
not to refuse
thee.

Here
not to refuse
=
to accept;
and is probably a
Grecism.
To not refuse
would, perhaps, be better.

The next expression is still more foreign to the English
idiom:—

For
not
to have been dipped in Lethe's lake

Could save
the son of Thetis from to die.

Here
not
is to be taken with
could
.

§ 517
. In the present English, two negatives
make an affirmative.
I have not not seen him
=
I have seen
him
. In Greek this was not the case.
Duæ aut plures negativæ apud
Græcos vehementius negant
is a well known rule. The Anglo-Saxon idiom
differed from the English and coincided with the Greek. The French
negative is only apparently double; words like
point
,
pas
,
mean not
not
, but
at all
.
Je ne parle pas
=
I not
speak at all
, not
I not speak no
.

§ 518
.
Questions of appeal.
—All
questions imply want of information; want of information may then imply
doubt; doubt, perplexity; and perplexity the absence of an alternative.
In this way, what are called, by Mr. Arnold,
[65]

questions of appeal
, are,
practically speaking,
[368]
negatives.
What should I do?
when
asked in extreme perplexity, means that nothing can well be done. In the
following passage we have the presence of a question instead of a
negative:—

Or hear'st thou (
cluis
, Lat.) rather pure ethereal stream,

Whose fountain who (
no one
) shall tell?—
Paradise Lost.

[369]

CHAPTER XXVIII.

ON THE CASE ABSOLUTE.

§ 519
. Broadly speaking, all adverbial
constructions are absolute. The term, however, is conveniently limited to
a particular combination of the noun, verb, and participle. When two
actions are connected with each other, either by the fact of their
simultaneous occurrence, or as cause and effect, they may be expressed
within the limits of a single proposition, by expressing the one by means
of a verb, and the other by means of a noun and participle agreeing with
each other.
The door being open, the horse was stolen.

Considering the nature of the connection between the two actions, we
find good grounds for expecting
à priori
that the participle will
be in the instrumental case, when such exists in the language: and when
not, in some case allied to it,
i.e.
, the ablative or dative.

In Latin the ablative is the case that is used absolutely.
Sole
orto, claruit dies.

In Anglo-Saxon the absolute case was the dative. This is logical.

In the present English, however, the nominative is the absolute case.

He made the best proverbs, him alone excepted
, is an expression of
Tillotson's. We should now write
he alone excepted
. The present
mode of expression
[370]
is only to be justified by considering the
nominative form to be a dative one, just as in the expression
you are
here
, the word
you
, although an accusative, is considered as a
nominative. A real nominative absolute is as illogical as a real
accusative case governing a verb.

[371]

PART VI.

PROSODY.

§ 520
. The word
Prosody
is derived from a
Greek word (
prosodia
) signifying
accent
. It is used by
Latin and English grammarians in a wider sense, and includes not only the
doctrines of accent and quantity, but also the laws of metre and
versification.

§ 521
. Observe the accents in the following
lines:—

Then fáre thee wéll, mine ówn dear lóve,

The wórld hath nów for ús

No greáter griéf, no paín abóve

The paín of párting thús.—
Moore
.

Here the syllables accented are the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th,
14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, 24th, 26th, 28th; that is, every other
syllable.—Again,

At the clóse of the dáy, when the hámlet is stíll,

And the mórtals the sweéts of forgétfulness próve,

And when nóught but the tórrent is heárd on the híll,

And there's nóught but the níghtingale's sóng in the gróve.—
Beattie.

Here the syllables accented are the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th,
21st, 24th, 27th, 30th, 33rd, 36th, 39th, 42nd, 45th, 48th; that is,
every third syllable.

§ 522
.
Metre is a general term for the
recurrence
[372]
within certain intervals of syllables
similarly affected.
The syllables that have just been numbered are
similarly affected, being similarly accented. Accent is not the only
quality of a syllable, which by returning at regular intervals can
constitute metre. It is the one, however, upon which English metre
depends. English metre essentially consists in the regular recurrence of
syllables similarly
accented
.

Abbot.
—And whý not líve and áct with óther mén?

Manfred.
—Becaúse my náture wás avérse from lífe;

And yét not crúel, fór I woúld not máke,

But fínd a désolátion:—líke the wínd,

The réd-hot breáth of thé most lóne simoóm,

Which dwélls but ín the désert, ánd sweeps o'ér

The bárren sánds which beár no shrúbs to blást,

And révels ó'er their wíld and árid wáves,

And seéketh nót so thát it ís not soúght,

But béing mét is deádly: súch hath beén

The páth of mý exístence.—
Byron.

§ 523
.
Measures.
—For every accented
syllable in the following line, write the letter
a
, and for every
unaccented one, the letter
x
, so that
a
may stand for an
accent,
x
for the absence of one—

The wáy was lóng, the wínd was cóld.—
Scott.

or expressed symbolically

x a x a x a x a,

where
x
coincides with
the
,
a
with
way
,
&c.

§ 524
. Determine the length of the line in
question.—It is plain that this may be done in two ways. We may
either measure by the syllables, and say that the line consists of eight
syllables; or by the accents, and say that it consists of four accents.
In this latter case we take the accented syllable with its corresponding

[373]
unaccented one, and, grouping the two
together, deal with the pair at once. Now, a group of syllables thus
taken together is called a
measure
. In the line in question
the
way
(
x a
) is one measure,
was long
(
x a
)
another, and so on throughout; the line itself consisting of four
measures.

§ 525
.
Trisyllabic measures.
—The
number of measures consisting of two syllables, or dissyllabic measures,
is necessarily limited to two, expressed
a x
and
x a

respectively. But beyond these there are in the English language measures
of three syllables, or trisyllabic measures. The number of these is
necessarily limited to three.

The first of these is exhibited in the word
mérrily
(
a x
x
).

Mérrily, mérrily sháll I live nów,

Únder the blóssom that hángs on the boúgh.—
Shakspeare.

The second is exhibited by the word
disáble
(
x a x
).

But vaínly thou wárrest,

For thís is alóne in

Thy pówer to decláre,

That ín the dim fórest

Thou heárd'st a low moáning,

And sáw'st a bright lády surpássingly faír.—
Coleridge.

§ 526
. The third is exhibited by the word

cavaliér
(
x x a
).

There's a beaúty for éver unfádingly bríght,

Like the lóng ruddy lápse of a súmmer-day's níght.—
Moore.

When grouped together according to certain rules, measures form lines
and verses; and lines and verses,
[374]
regularly arranged,
constitute couplets, triplets, and stanzas, &c.

§ 527
. The expression of measures, lines,
&c., by such symbols as
a x
,
x a
, &c., is

metrical notation
.

§ 528
.
Rhyme.
—We can have English
verse without
rhyme
. We cannot have English verse without

accent
. Hence accent is an
essential
; rhyme an

accessory
to metre.

§ 529
.
Analysis of a pair of rhyming
syllables.
—Let the syllables
told
and
bold
be
taken to pieces, and let the separate parts of each be compared. Viewed
in reference to metre, they consist of three parts or elements: 1. the
vowel (
o
); 2. the part
preceding
the vowel (
t
and

b
respectively); 3. the parts
following
the vowel
(
ld
). Now the vowel (
o
) and the parts following the vowel
(
ld
) are alike in both words (
old
); but the part preceding
the vowel is different in the different words (
told
,
bold
).
This difference between the parts preceding the vowels is essential;
since, if it were not for this, the two words would be identical, or
rather there would be but one word altogether. This is the case with

I
and
eye
. Sound for sound (although different in spelling)
the two words are identical, and, consequently, the rhyme is faulty.

Again—compared with the words
bold
and
told
, the
words
teeth
and
breeze
have two of the elements necessary
to constitute a rhyme. The vowels are alike (
ee
), whilst the parts
preceding the vowels are different (
br
and
t
); and, as far
as these two matters are concerned, the rhyme is a good one,
tee

and
bree
. Notwithstanding this, there is anything rather than a
rhyme; since the parts following the vowel (
th
and
ze
)
instead of agreeing, differ.
Breathe
and
beneath
are in the
same
[375]
predicament, because the
th
is not
sounded alike in the two words.

Again—the words
feel
and
mill
constitute only a
false and imperfect rhyme. Sound for sound, the letters
f
and

m
(the parts preceding the vowel) are different. This is as it
should be. Also, sound for sound,
l
and
ll
(the parts
following the vowel) are identical; and this is as it should be also: but

ee
and
i
(the vowels) are different, and this difference
spoils the rhyme.
None
and
own
are in the same predicament;
since one
o
is sounded as
o
in
note
, and the other
as the
u
in
but
.

From what has gone before we get the notion of true and perfect rhymes
as opposed to false and imperfect ones. For two (or more) words to rhyme
to each other, it is necessary

a.
That the vowel be the same in both.

b.
That the parts following the vowel be the same.

c.
That the parts preceding the vowel be different.

Beyond this it is necessary that the syllables, to form a full and
perfect rhyme, should be accented syllables.
Sky
and
lie

form good rhymes, but
sky
and merri
ly
bad ones, and

merrily
and
silly
worse. Lines like the second and fourth
of the following stanza are slightly exceptionable on this score: indeed,
many readers sacrifice the accent in the word
mérrily
to the
rhyme, and pronounce it
merrilý
.

The wítch she héld the haír in her hánd,

The réd flame blázed hígh;

And roúnd aboút the cáldron stoút,

They dánced right mérri
lý
.—
Kirke White.

§ 530
. In matters of rhyme the letter
h

counts as nothing.
High
and
I
,
hair
and
air
,
are imperfect
[376]
rhymes, because
h
(being no
articulate sound) counts as nothing, and so the parts before the vowel

i
and
a
are not different (as they ought to be) but
identical.

Whose generous children narrow'd not their hearts

With commerce, giv'n alone to arms and arts.—
Byron.

§ 531
. Words where the letters coincide, but the
sounds differ, are only rhymes to the eye.
Breathe
and

beneath
are both in this predicament; so also are
cease
and

ease
(
eaze
).

In the fat age of pleasure, wealth, and ease,

Sprang the rank weed, and thrived with large increase.—
Pope.

§ 532
. If the sounds coincide, the difference of
the letters is unimportant.

Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,

Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.

They talk of principles, but notions prize,

And all to one loved folly sacrifice.—
Pope.

§ 533
.
Single rhymes.
—An accented
syllable standing by itself, and coming under the conditions given above,
constitutes a single rhyme.

'Tis hard to say if greater want of
skill

Appear in writing or in judging
ill
;

But of the two, less dangerous is the of
fence

To tire the patience than mislead the
sense
.

Some few in that, but thousands err in
this
;

Ten censure wrong, for one that writes a
miss
.—
Pope.

§ 534
.
Double rhymes.
—An accented
syllable followed by an unaccented one, and coming under the conditions
given above, constitutes a double rhyme.
[377]

The meeting points the sacred hair dis
sever

From her fair head for ever and for
ever
.—
Pope.

Prove and explain a thing till all men
doubt it
,

And write about it, Goddess, and
about it
.—
Pope.

§ 535
. An accented syllable followed by two
unaccented ones, and coming under the conditions given above, constitutes
a treble rhyme.

Beware that its fatal a
scéndancy

Do not tempt thee to mope and repine;

With a humble and hopeful de
péndency

Still await the good pleasure divine.

Success in a higher be
átitude
,

Is the end of what's under the Pole;

A philosopher takes it with
grátitude
,

And believes it the best on the whole.—
Byron.

§ 536
. Metres where there is no rhyme are called
blank metres.

Of man's first disobedience and the fruit

Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste

Brought death into the world and all our woe,

With loss of Eden, till one greater Man

Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,

Sing, Heavenly Muse!—
Milton.

The quality of mercy is not strained.

It droppeth as the gentle dew from heaven

Upon the place beneath; it is twice bless'd,

It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes

'Tis mightiest of the mighty, it becomes

The throned monarch better than his crown.

His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,

The attribute of awe and majesty,

Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings:

[378]

But mercy is above this sceptred sway;

It is enthroned in the hearts of kings:

It is an attribute to God himself;

And earthly power doth then show likest God's,

When mercy seasons justice.—
Shakspeare.

§ 537
.
The last measure in a line or verse is
indifferent as to its length.
—By referring to the section upon
single rhymes, we shall find that the number of syllables is just double
the number of accents; that is, to each accented there is one unaccented
syllable, and no more. Hence, with five accents, there are to each line
ten syllables. This is not the case with all verses. Some rhymes are
double, and the last accented syllable has two unaccented ones to follow
it. Hence, with five accents there are to each line eleven syllables. Now
it is in the last measure that this supernumerary unaccented syllable
appears; and it is a general rule, that, in the last measure of any
verse, supernumerary unaccented syllables can be admitted without
destroying the original character of the measure.

§ 538
. See the verses in the section on double
rhymes. Here the original character of the measure is
x a

throughout, until we get to the words
disséver
and
for
éver
, and afterwards to
men doúbt it
, and
aboút it
. At
the first view it seems proper to say that in these last-mentioned cases

x a
is converted into
x a x
. A different view, however, is
the more correct one.
Disséver
and
for éver
, are rather

x a
with a syllable over. This extra syllable may be expressed by
the sign
plus
( + ), so that the words in point may be expressed
by
x a
+, rather than by
x a x
. It is very clear that a
measure whereof the last syllable is accented (that is, measures like

x a
,
presúme
, or
x x a
,
cavalíer
), can only

[379]
vary from their original character on the
side of excess; that is, they can only be altered by the addition of
fresh syllables. To subtract a syllable from such feet is impossible;
since it is only the last syllable that is capable of being subtracted.
If that last syllable, however, be the accented syllable of the measure,
the whole measure is annihilated. Nothing remains but the unaccented
syllable preceding; and this, as no measure can subsist without an
accent, must be counted as a supernumerary part of the preceding
measure.

§ 539
. With the measures
a x
,
a x
x
,
x a x
, the case is different. Here there is room for
syllable or syllables to be subtracted.

Queén and húntress, cháste and faír,

Nów the sún is laíd to sléep,

Seated ín thy sílver chaír,

Státe in wónted spléndour keép.

Hésperús invókes thy líght,

Góddess, éxquisítely bríght.—
Ben Jonson.

In all these lines the last measure is deficient in a syllable, yet
the deficiency is allowable, because each measure is the last one of the
line. The formula for expressing
faír
,
sléep
,
chaír
,
&c. is not
a
, but rather
a x
followed by the

minus
sign (-), or
a x-
.

A little consideration will show that amongst the English measures,

x a
and
x x a
naturally form single,
a x
and
x a
x
double, and
a x x
treble rhymes.

§ 540
. The chief metres in English are of the
formula
x a
. It is only a few that are known by fixed names. These
are as follows:—

1.
Gay's stanza.
—Lines of three measures,
x a
,
with alternate rhymes. The odd (
i.e.
the 1st and 3rd) rhymes
double.
[380]

'Twas when the seas were roaring

With hollow blasts of wind,

A damsel lay deploring,

All on a rock reclined.

2.
Common octosyllabics.
—Four measures,
x a
, with
rhyme, and (unless the rhymes be double) eight syllables (
octo
syllabæ
).—Butler's Hudibras, Scott's poems, The Giaour, and
other poems of Lord Byron.

3.
Elegiac octosyllabics
.—Same as the last, except that
the rhymes are regularly alternate, and the verses arranged in
stanzas.

And on her lover's arm she leant,

And round her waist she felt it fold,

And far across the hills they went,

In that new world which now is old:

Across the hills and far away,

Beyond their utmost purple rim,

And deep into the dying day

The happy princess follow'd him.—
Tennyson.

4.
Octosyllabic triplets.
—Three rhymes in succession.
Generally arranged as stanzas.

I blest them, and they wander'd on;

I spoke, but answer came there none;

The dull and bitter voice was gone.—
Tennyson.

5.
Blank verse.
—
Five
measures,
x a
, without rhyme, Paradise Lost, Young's
Night Thoughts, Cowper's Task.

6.
Heroic couplets.
—Five measures,
x a
, with pairs
of rhymes. Chaucer, Denham, Dryden, Waller, Pope, Goldsmith, Cowper,
Byron, Moore, Shelley, &c. This is the common metre for narrative,
didactic, and descriptive poetry.
[381]

7.
Heroic triplets.
—Five measures,
x a
. Three
rhymes in succession. Arranged in stanzas. This metre is sometimes
interposed among heroic couplets.

8.
Elegiacs.
—Five measures,
x a
; with regularly
alternate rhymes, and arranged in stanzas.

The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,

The lowing herds wind slowly o'er the lea,

The ploughman homewards plods his weary way,

And leaves the
world
to darkness and to me.—
Gray.

9.
Rhymes royal.
—Seven lines of heroics, with the last
two rhymes in succession, and the first five recurring at intervals.

This Troilus, in gift of curtesie,

With hauk on hond, and with a huge rout

Of knightes, rode, and did her company,

Passing all through the valley far about;

And further would have ridden out of doubt.

Full faine and woe was him to gone so sone;

But turn he must, and it was eke to doen.—
Chaucer.

This metre was common with the writers of the earlier part of Queen
Elizabeth's reign. It admits of varieties according to the distribution
of the first five rhymes.

10.
Ottava rima.
—A metre with an Italian name, and
borrowed from Italy, where it is used generally for narrative poetry. The
Morgante Maggiore of Pulci, the Orlando Innamorato of Bojardo, the
Orlando Furioso of Ariosto, the Gierusalemme Liberata of Tasso, are all
written in this metre. Besides this, the two chief epics of Spain and
Portugal respectively (the Auraucana and the Lusiados) are thus composed.
Hence it is a form of poetry which is Continental rather than
[382]
English,
and naturalized rather than indigenous. The stanza consists of eight
lines of heroics, the six first rhyming alternately, the last two in
succession.

Arrived there, a prodigious noise he hears,

Which suddenly along the forest spread;

Whereat from out his quiver he prepares

An arrow for his bow, and lifts his head;

And, lo! a monstrous herd of swine appears,

And onward rushes with tempestuous tread,

And to the fountain's brink precisely pours,

So that the giant's join'd by all the boars.

Morgante Maggiore
(
Ld. Byron's

Translation
.)

11.
Terza rima.
—Like the last, borrowed both in name and
nature from the Italian, and scarcely yet naturalized in England.

The Spirit of the fervent days of old,

When words were things that came to pass, and Thought

Flash'd o'er the future, bidding men behold

Their children's children's doom already brought

Forth from the abyss of Time which is to be,

The chaos of events where lie half-wrought

Shapes that must undergo mortality:

What the great seers of Israel wore within,

That Spirit was on them and is on me:

And if, Cassandra-like, amidst the din

Of conflicts, none will hear, or hearing heed

This voice from out the wilderness, the sin

Be theirs, and my own feelings be my meed,

The only guerdon I have ever known.

12.
Alexandrines.
—Six measures,
x a
, generally
(perhaps always) with rhyme. The name is said to be taken from the fact
that early romances upon the deeds of Alexander of Macedon, of great
popularity, were written in this metre. One of the longest poems in the

[383]
English language is in the Alexandrines,

viz.
Drayton's Poly-olbion, quoted above.

13.
Spenserian stanza.
—A stanza consisting of nine lines,
the first eight heroics, the last an Alexandrine.

It hath been through all ages ever seen,

That with the prize of arms and chivalrie

The prize of beauty still hath joined been,

And that for reason's special privitie;

For either doth on other much rely.

For he meseems most fit the fair to serve

That can her best defend from villanie;

And she most fit his service doth deserve,

That fairest is, and from her faith will never swerve.—
Spenser.

Childe Harold and other important poems are composed in the Spenserian
stanza.

14.
Service metre.
—Couplets of seven measures,
x
a
. This is the common metre of the Psalm versions. It is also called
common measure, or long measure. In this metre there is always a pause
after the fourth measure, and many grammarians consider that with that
pause the line ends. According to this view, the service metre does not
consist of two long lines with seven measures each; but of four short
ones, with four and three measures each alternately. The Psalm versions
are printed so as to exhibit this pause or break.

The Lord descended from above, | and bow'd the heavens most high,

And underneath his feet He cast | the darkness of the sky.

On Cherubs and on Seraphim | full royally He rode,

And on the wings of mighty winds | came flying all abroad.—
Sternhold and Hopkins.

In this matter the following distinction is convenient. When the last
syllable of the fourth measure (
i.e.
the eighth syllable in the
line) in the one verse
rhymes
with
[384]
the corresponding
syllable in the other, the long verse should be looked upon as broken up
into two short ones; in other words, the couplets should be dealt with as
a stanza. Where there is no rhyme except at the seventh measure, the
verse should remain undivided. Thus:

Turn, gentle hermit of the glen, | and guide thy lonely way

To where yon taper cheers the vale | with hospitable ray—

constitute a single couplet of two lines, the number of rhymes being
two. But,

Turn, gentle hermit of the dale,

And guide thy lonely way

To where yon taper cheers the vale

With hospitable ray—(
Goldsmith
)

constitute a stanza of four lines, the number of rhymes being
four.

15.
Ballad stanza.
—Service metre broken up in the way
just indicated. Goldsmith's Edwin and Angelina, &c.

16.
Poulterer's measure.
—Alexandrines and service metre
alternately. Found in the poetry of Henry the Eighth's time.

[385]

PART VII.

THE DIALECTS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

§ 541
. Certain parts of England are named as if
their population were preeminently
Saxon
rather than
Angle
;

viz.
, Wes
-sex
( = West
Saxons
), Es
-sex
( =
East
Saxons
), Sus
-sex
( = South
Saxons
), and
Middle
-sex
, ( = Middle
Saxons
).

Others are named as if their population were preeminently
Angle

rather than
Saxon
; thus, the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk once
constituted the kingdom of the East Angles, and even at the present
moment, are often spoken of as
East Anglia
.

§ 542
. It is safe to say that the dialects of
the English language do
not
coincide with the distribution of
these terms. That parts of the Angle differ from parts of the Saxon
districts in respect to the character of their provincialisms is true;
but it is by no means evident that they differ on that account.

Thus, that the dialect of Hampshire, which was part of Wes
-sex
,
should differ from that of Norfolk, which was part of East
Anglia
,
is but natural. There is a great space of country between them—a
fact sufficient to account for their respective characteristics, without
assuming an original difference of population. Between the
Saxons

of Es
-sex
and the
Anglians
of Suffolk, no one has professed
to find any notable difference.
[386]

Hence, no division of the English dialects into those of
Saxon

or those of
Angle
origin, has been successful.

Neither have any peculiarities in the dialect of Kent, or the Isle of
Wight, verified the notion of the population for those parts having been
originally
Jute
.

Nor yet has any portion of England been shown by the evidence of its
dialects, to have been
Frisian
.

§ 543
. Yet the solution of such problems is one
of the great objects of the study of provincial modes of speech.

§ 544
. That
Jute
characteristics will be
sought in vain is the inference from §§
7
-
13
.

That differential points between the
Angles
and
Saxons

will be sought in vain is also probable.

On the other hand, differential points between the
Frisians
and

Angles
are likely to be discovered.

§ 545
. The traces of the Danes, or Northmen, are
distinct; the following forms of local names being
primâ facie

evidence (at least) of Danish or Norse occupancy.

a.
The combination
Sk-
, rather than the sound of

Sh-
, in such names as
Skip-
ton, rather than

Ship-
ton.

b.
The combination
Ca-
, rather than
Ch-
, in such
names as
Carl-
ton rather than
Charl-
ton.

c.
The termination
-by
( =
town
,

habitation
,
occupancy
,) rather than
-ton
, as
Ash
-by
, Demble
-by
, Spills
-by
, Grims
-by
,
&c.

d.
The form
Kirk
rather than
Church
.

e.
The form
Orm
rather than
Worm
, as in

Orms-head
.

In
Orms-kirk
and
Kir-by
we have a combination of Danish
characteristics.

§ 546
. In respect to their distribution, the
Danish forms are—

[387]

At their
maximum
on the sea-coast of Lincolnshire;
i.e.
,
in the parts about Spills-by.

Common, but less frequent, in Yorkshire, the Northern counties of
England, the South-eastern parts of Scotland, Lancashire,
(
Ormskirk
, Horn-
by
), and parts of South Wales
(
Orms
-head, Ten-
by
).

In Orkney, and the northern parts of Scotland, the Norse had
originally the same influence that the Anglo-Saxon had in the
south.—See the chapter of the Lowland Scotch.

This explains the peculiar distribution of the Norse forms. Rare, or
non-existent, in central and southern England, they appear on the
opposite sides of the island, and on its northern extremity; showing that
the stream of the Norse population went
round the island rather than
across it
.

§ 547
. Next to the search after traces of the
original differences in the speech of the Continental invaders of Great
Britain, the question as to the origin of the
written
language of
England is the most important.

Mr. Guest has given good reasons for believing it to have arisen out
of a Mercian, rather than a West-Saxon dialect—although of the

Anglo-Saxon
the West-Saxon was the most cultivated form.

This is confirmed by the present state of the Mercian dialects.

The country about Huntingdon and Stamford is, in the mind of the
present writer, that part of England where provincial peculiarities are
at the
minimum
. This may be explained in various ways, of which
none is preferable to the doctrine, that the dialect for those parts
represents the dialect out of which the literary language of England
became developed.

Such are the chief problems connected with the study
[388]
of the
provincial dialects of England; the exhibition of the methods applicable
to their investigation not being considered necessary in a work like the
present.

NOTE.

That
Saxon
was the
British
name of the Germanic invaders
of Great Britain is certain.—See §
45
.

The reasons which induce me to consider it as
exclusively

British,
i.e.
, as foreign to the Angles, are as
follows,—

a.
No clear distinction has ever been drawn between,

e.g.
, an
Angle
of Suffolk, and a
Saxon
of Essex.

b.
The Romans who knew, for some parts at least, every inch of
the land occupied by the Saxons of Germany, as long as there is reason
for believing that they took their names from German sources, never use
the word. It is strange to Cæsar, Strabo, Pliny, and Tacitus. Ptolemy is
the first who uses it.

c.
Ecbert, who is said to have attached the name of

Engl
and, or Land of
Angles
, to South Britain, was, himself,
no
Angle
, but a West-Saxon.

[393]

NOTES.

[1]
The immediate
authority for these descents, dates, and localities is Sharon Turner.
They are nearly the same as those which are noticed in Mr. Kemble's

Saxons in England
. In the former writer, however, they are given
as historical facts; in the latter they are subjected to criticism, and
considered as exceptionable.

[2]
It is from Beda that
the current opinions as to the details of the Anglo-Saxon invasion are
taken; especially the threefold division into Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.
These migrations were so large and numerous that the original country of
the Angles was left a desert. The distribution of the three divisions
over the different parts of England was also Beda's.

The work of this important writer—the great luminary of early
England—is the
Historia Ecclesiastica
, a title which
prepares us for a great preponderance of the ecclesiastical over the
secular history.

Now Beda's date was the middle of the eighth century.

And his locality was the monastery of Wearmouth, in the county of
Durham.

Both of these facts must be borne in mind when we consider the value
of his authority,
i.e.
, his means of knowing, as determined by the
conditions of time and place.

Christianity was introduced among the Anglo-Saxons of Kent
A.D.
597. For the times between them and
A.D.
740, we have in Mr. Kemble's
Codex
Diplomaticus
eighty-five charters, all in Latin, and most of them of
uncertain authenticity. They are chiefly grants of different kings of
Kent, Wessex, the Hwiccas, Mercia, and Northumberland, a few being of
Bishops.

[3]
Gildas was a

British
ecclesiastic, as Beda was an
English
one.
[394]
His
locality was North Wales: his time earlier than Beda's by perhaps one
hundred years.

He states that he was born the year of the
pugna Badonica
,
currently called the
Battle of Bath
.

Now a chronological table called
Annales Cambrenses
, places
that event within one hundred years of the supposed landing of
Hengist.

But there is no reason for believing this to be a cotemporary entry.
Hence, all that can be safely said of Gildas is that he was about as far
removed from the seat of the Germanic invasions, in locality, as Beda,
whilst in point of time he was nearer.

As a writer he is far inferior, being pre-eminently verbose, vague,
and indefinite.

Gildas
, as far as he states facts at all, gives the

British
account of the conquest.

No other documents have come down to our time.

Beda's own authorities—as we learn from his
introduction—were certain of the most learned bishops and abbots of
his cotemporaries, of whom he sought special information as to the
antiquities of their own establishments. Of cotemporary writers, in the
way of authority, there is no mention.

For the times between the "accredited date of Hengist and Horsa's
landing (
A.D.
449) and
A.D.
597 (a period of about one hundred and fifty
years) the only authorities are a few quotations from Solinus, Gildas,
and a Legendary Life of St. Germanus."—
Saxons in Engl.
i.
27.

[4]
This account is from
Jornandes, who is generally considered as the chief repertory of the
traditions respecting the Gothic populations. He lived about
A.D.
530. The Gepidæ were said to be the

laggards
of the migration, and the vessel which carried them to
have been left behind: and as
gepanta
in their language meant

slow
, their name is taken therefrom.

[5]
Widukind was a monk of
Corvey in Flanders, who wrote the Ecclesiastical History of his
monastery.

[6]
Geoffry of Monmouth,
like Gildas, is a
British
authority. His date was the reign of
Henry II. The
Welsh
traditions form the staple of Geoffry's work,
for which it is the great repertory.

[7]
The
date
of
this was the reign of Marcus Antoninus. Its
place
, the Danubian
provinces of Rhætia, and Pannonia. It was carried on by the Germans of
the
frontier
or
march
—from whence the name—in
alliance with the Jazyges, who were undoubtedly Slavonic, and the Quadi,
who were probably so. Its details are obscure—the chief authority
being Dio Cassius.

[8]
The reign of
Valentinian was from
A.D.
365 to
A.D.
375.
[395]

[9]
The date of this has
been variously placed in
A.D.
438, and between

A.D.
395 and
A.D.

407. Either is earlier than
A.D.
449.

[10]
The Saxon Chronicle
consists of a series of entries from the earliest times to the reign of
King Stephen, each under its year: the year of the Anglo-Saxon invasion
being the usual one,
i.e.
,
A.D.
449. The
value of such a work depends upon the extent to which the chronological
entries are cotemporaneous with the events noticed. Where this is the
case, the statement is of the highest historical value; where, however,
it is merely taken from some earlier authority, or from a tradition, it
loses the character of a
register
, and becomes merely a series of
dates—correct or incorrect as the case may be. Where the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle really begins to be a cotemporaneous register is
uncertain—all that is certain being that it
is
so for the

latest
, and is
not
so for
earliest
entries. The
notices in question come under the former class. The Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle had been edited by the Master of Trinity College, Oxford (Dr.
Ingram), and analyzed by Miss Gurney.

[11]
Asserius was a
learned Welsh ecclesiastic who was invited by King Alfred into Wessex,
and employed by that king as one of his associates and assistants in
civilizing and instructing his subjects. Several works are mentioned as
having been written by Asserius, but the only one extant is his history
of King Alfred, which is a chronicle of various events between the year
of Alfred's birth,
A.D.
849, to
A.D.
889.

Asserius is supposed to have died Bishop of Sherborne,
A.D.
910.

[12]
The compounds of
the Anglo-Saxon word
ware
=
occupants
,
inhabitants
,
are too numerous to leave any doubt as to this, and several other,
derivations.
Cant-ware
=
Cant-icolæ
=
people of
Kent
:
Hwic-ware
=
Hviccas
=
the people
of parts
of Worcestershire,
[67]
Glostershire, and (to judge from
the name) of
War-wick
shire also.

[13]
The Annales
Saxonici, or Saxon Chronicles, embrace the history of Britain, between
the landing of Cæsar and the accession of Henry II. They are evidently
the work of various and successive writers, who were Saxon ecclesiastics.
But nothing certain can be affirmed of the authors of their respective
portions.—See Note
10

[15]
Adam of Bremen was
a Minor Canon of the Cathedral of Bremen, about the years 1067-1077. He
travelled in Denmark, and was in great favour with King Sweyn of that
country. He wrote an Ecclesiastical History of the spread of Christianity
in the North, to which he appended a description of the geography,
population, and archæology of Denmark and the neighbouring countries.

The following is a
specimen of the Frisian of Gysbert Japicx, in metre. It is part of a
rustic song, supposed to be sung by a peasant on his return from a
wedding feast. Date about
A.D.
1650.

"Swíet, ja swíet, is't oer 'e míete,

'T boáskiere fóar é jonge lie,

Kreftich swíet is't, sizz ik jiette,

As it giet mei alders ríe.

Mai óars tiget 'et to 'n pléach,

As ik óan myn geafeunt seach."

Translation of the same from Bosworth's
Anglo-Saxon Dictionary
,
p. lxxiii.

"Sweet, yes, sweet is over (
beyond
) measure,

The marrying for the young lede (
people
);

Most sweet is it, I say yet (
once more
),

When (
as
) it goes with the rede (
counsel
) of the elders.

But otherwise it tends to a plague,

As I saw on (
by the example of
) my village fellow."

[18]
Of the early
constitution of states of East Friesland, we have a remarkable
illustration in the old Frisian Laws. These are in the native Frisian
tongue, and, except that they represent republican rather than
monarchical institutions, are similar in form, in spirit, to the
Saxon.

[19]
The great blow
against the sovereignty of Rome, and the one which probably prevented
Germany from becoming a Roman province, was struck by the Cheruscan
Arminius against Quintilius Varus, in the reign of Augustus. The date of
the organized insurrection of Arminius was
A.D.

9; the place, the neighbourhood of Herford, or Engern, in Westphalia.
Drawn into an inpracticable part of the country, the troops of Varus were
suddenly attacked and cut to pieces—consisting of more than three
legions. "Never was victory more decisive, never was the liberation of an
oppressed people more instantaneous and complete. Throughout Germany the
Roman garrisons were assailed and cut off; and, within a few weeks after
Varus had fallen, the German soil was freed from the foot of an
invader.

"Had Arminius been supine or unsuccessful, our Germanic ancestors
would have been enslaved or exterminated in their original seats along
the Eyder and the Elbe. This island would never have borne the name of

[397]
England, and we, this great English
nation, whose race and language are now overrunning the earth, from one
end of it to the other, would have been utterly cut off from
existence."

Heliand
is
the gerund from
helian
=
heal
, and means
the Healer

or
Saviour
. It is the name of an old Saxon poem, in alliterative
metre, of the tenth or eleventh century, in the dialect supposed to have
belonged to the parts about Essen, Cleves, and Munster in Westphalia. It
is a sort of Gospel Harmony, or Life of Christ, taken from the Gospels.
It has been edited by Schmeller.

[21]
Hildubrand and
Hathubrant, father and son, are two legendary heroes belonging to that
cycle of German fiction of which Theodoric of Verona is the centre. A
fragment containing an account of their hostile meeting, being mutually
unknown, in alliterative metre, represents the
fictional
poetry of
the old Saxons in the same way (though not to the same extent) that the
Heliand represents their sacred poetry. The "Hildubrand and Hathubrant"
have been edited by Grimm.

[22]
In a language which
for a long time was considered to be the Dutch of Holland in its oldest
known form, there is an imperfect translation of the Psalms; referred by
the best writers on the subject to the reign of Charlemagne, and thence
called the Carolinian Psalms. The best text of this is to be found in a
Dutch periodical, the
Taalkundig Magazijn
.

[23]

Beowulf
is
by far the most considerable poem, not only in Anglo-Saxon, but in any
old Gothic tongue. It has been admirably edited and translated by Mr.
Kemble. The subject is the account of Beowulf, an Angle hero—Angle
but not English, as the scene of the poem is on the Continent. In its
present form it shows traces of the revision of some Christian writer:
the basis, however, of its subject, and the manners it describes, are
essentially Pagan. The most remarkable feature in the poem is the fact
that no allusion is made to England—so that,
Anglo
-Saxon as
the work is—it belongs to the Anglo-Saxons of Germany before they
became English.

[24]
A Gospel Harmony
translated from the one of Tatian, exists in a dialect too little purely
High German, to pass absolutely as such, yet less
Low
German than
the Dutch of Holland. This belongs to the
Middle
Rhine, and is
called
Frank
.

The Alemannic is
the German of the
Upper

Elements of Moral Philosophy:

ANALYTICAL, SYNTHETICAL, AND PRACTICAL.

BY HUBBARD WINSLOW.

12mo. 480 pages. Price $1 50.

This work is an original and thorough examination of the fundamental
laws of Moral Science, and of their relations to Christianity and to
practical life. It has already taken a firm stand among our highest works
of literature and science. From the numerous commendations of it by our
most learned and competent men, we have room for only the following brief
extracts:

From the
Rev. Thomas H. Skinner, D.D.
, of the Union Theol. Sem., N.Y.

"It is a work of uncommon merit, on a subject very difficult to be
treated well. His analysis is complete. He has shunned no question which
his purpose required him to answer, and he has met no adversary which he
has not overcome."

From
Rev. L. P. Hickok
, Vice-President of Union College.

"I deem the book well adapted to the ends proposed in the preface. The
style is clear, the thoughts perspicuous. I think it calculated to do
good, to promote the truth, to diffuse light and impart instruction to
the community, in a department of study of the deepest interest to
mankind."

From
Rev. James Walker, D.D.
, President of Harvard University.

"Having carefully examined the more critical parts, to which my
attention has been especially directed, I am free to express my
conviction of the great clearness, discrimination, and accuracy of the
work, and of its admirable adaptation to its object."

From
Rev. Ray Palmer, D.D.
, of Albany.

"I have examined this work with great pleasure, and do not hesitate to
say that in my judgment it is greatly superior to any treatise I have
seen, in all the essential requisites of a good text-book."

From
Prof. Rousseau D. Hitchcock, D.D.
, of Union Theol. Sem., N.Y.

"The task of mediating between science and the popular mind, is one
that requires a peculiar gift of perspicuity, both in thought and style;
and this, I think, the author possesses in an eminent degree. I am
pleased with its comprehensiveness, its plainness, and its fidelity to
the Christian stand-point."

From
Prof. Henry B. Smith, D.D.
, of the Union Theol. Sem., N.Y.

"It commends itself by its clear arrangement of the topics, its
perspicuity of language, and its constant practical bearings. I am
particularly pleased with its views of conscience. Its frequent and
pertinent illustrations, and the Scriptural character of its explanations
of the particular duties, will make the work both attractive and valuable
as a text-book, in imparting instruction upon this vital part of
philosophy."

From
W. D. Wilson, D.D.
, Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy in
Hobart Free College.

"I have examined the work with care, and have adopted it as a
text-book in the study of Moral Science. I consider it not only sound in
doctrine, but clear and systematic in method, and withal pervaded with a
prevailing healthy tone of sentiment, which cannot fail to leave behind,
in addition to the truths it inculcates, an impression in favor of those
truths. I esteem this one of the greatest merits of the book. In this
respect it has no equal, so far as I know; and I do not hesitate to speak
of it as being preferable to any other work yet published, for use in all
institutions where Moral Philosophy forms a department in the course of
instruction."

[400]

A History of Philosophy:

AN EPITOME.

BY DR. ALBERT SCHWEGLER.

TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL GERMAN, BY JULIUS H. SEELYE.

12mo. 365 pages. Price $1 50.

This translation is designed to supply a want long felt by both
teachers and students in our American colleges. We have valuable
histories of Philosophy in English, but no
manual
on this subject
so clear, concise, and comprehensive as the one now presented.
Schwegler's work bears the marks of great learning, and is evidently
written by one who has not only studied the original sources for such a
history, but has thought out for himself the systems of which he treats.
He has thus seized upon the real germ of each system, and traced its
process of development with great clearness and accuracy. The whole
history of speculation, from Thales to the present time, is presented in
its consecutive order. This rich and important field of study, hitherto
so greatly neglected, will, it is hoped, receive a new impulse among
American students through Mr. Seelye's translation. It is a book,
moreover, invaluable for reference, and should be in the possession of
every public and private library.

From
L. P. Hickok
, Vice-President of Union College.

"I have had opportunity to hear a large part of Rev. Mr. Seelye's
translation of Schwegler's History of Philosophy read from manuscript,
and I do not hesitate to say that it is a faithful, clear, and remarkably
precise English rendering of this invaluable Epitome of the History of
Philosophy. It is exceedingly desirable that it should be given to
American students of philosophy in the English language, and I have no
expectation of its more favorable and successful accomplishment than in
this present attempt. I should immediately introduce it as as a text-book
in the graduate's department under my own instruction, if it be favorably
published, and cannot doubt that other teachers will rejoice to avail
themselves of the like assistance from it."

From
Henry B. Smith
, Professor of Christian Theology, Union Theological
Seminary, N.Y.

"It will well reward diligent study, and is one of the best works for
a text-book in our colleges upon this neglected branch of scientific
investigation."

From
N. Porter
, Professor of Intellectual Philosophy in Yale College.

"It is the only book translated from the German which professes to
give an account of the recent German systems which seems adapted to give
any intelligible information on the subject to a novice."

From
Geo. P. Fisher
, Professor of Divinity in Yale College.

"It is really the best Epitome of the History of Philosophy now
accessible to the English student."

From
Joseph Haven
, Professor of Mental Philosophy in Amherst College.

"As a manual and brief summary of the whole range of speculative
inquiry, I know of no work which strikes me more favorably."

[401]

A Digest of English Grammar.

BY L. T. COVELL.

12mo. 219 pages. Price 60 cents.

This work is designed as a text-book for the use of schools and
academies; it is the result of long experience of an eminently successful
teacher, and will be found to possess many peculiar advantages.

The work is both synthetical and analytical, and its principles are
strictly practical; the different subjects are carefully separated and
methodically arranged, so that all difficulty as to what belongs to
Etymology, Syntax, and Analysis, is entirely removed, and the latter,
which is very properly placed in the first part of Syntax, is rendered
quite as simple and easy of comprehension as the most plain portion of
grammar.

One subject is taken up at a time, and, when fully explained, models
of Analysis are given, and examples for practice follow.

The principles of the work are sound; the definitions are direct,
short, and accurate.

The rules, though ample, are few, plain, and concise; and the language
throughout the work is simple, clear, and expressive.

The method of treating the Elementary Sounds, is that which is now
highly approved.

The principles of Derivation, and of Orthographic Analysis, are
brought within the comprehension of the youngest learner.

From Forty-four Teachers of Public Schools, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.

"The undersigned have examined Covell's Digest of English Grammar, and
are of opinion that in the justness of its general views, the excellence
of its style, the brevity, accuracy, and perspicuity of its definitions
and rules, the numerous examples and illustrations, the adaptation of its
synthetical exercises, the simplicity of its method of analysis, and in
the plan of its arrangement, this work surpasses any other Grammar now
before the public; and that in all respects it is most admirably adapted
to the use of schools and academies."

From
John M. Wolcott, A.M.
, Principal and Superintendent of Ninth
Ward School, Pittsburg, Pa.

"Covell's Digest of English Grammar not only evinces the most
unceasing labor, the most extensive research, the most unrelaxing effort,
and the most devoted self-sacrificing study of its author, but it is the
most complete, the most perfect, and, to me, the most satisfactory
exposition of English Grammar that has come to my notice. It appears to
me that every youth aspiring to become master of the English language,
from the rudimental principles to the full, round, beautiful, faultless,
perfect period, will make this volume his '
vade mecum
.'"

Natural Philosophy:

Embracing the most Recent Discoveries in the Various
Branches of Physics, and Exhibiting the Application of Scientific
Principles in Every-day Life. Accompanied with full descriptions of
Experiments, Practical Exercises, and numerous Illustrations.

BY G. P. QUACKENBOS, A.M.

12mo. 450 pages. Price $1 25.

This book, which is illustrated in the most liberal manner, is equally
adapted for use with or without apparatus. It is distinguished

1. For its remarkable clearness.

2. For its fullness of illustration.

3. For its original method of dealing with difficulties.

4. For its correction of numerous errors heretofore unfortunately
stereotyped in School Philosophies.

5. For its explanation of scientific principles as they appear in
every-day life.

6. For its practical application of these principles in questions
presented for the pupil's solution.

7. For a signal perspicuity of arrangement. One thing being presented
at a time and everything in its proper place, the whole is impressed
without difficulty on the mind.

8. For the interest with which it invests the subject. From the
outset, the student is fascinated and filled with a desire to fathom the
wonders of the material world.

9. For the embodiment of all recent discoveries in the various
departments of philosophy. Instead of relying on the obsolete authorities
that have furnished the matter for many of our popular school
Philosophies, the author has made it his business to acquaint himself
with the present state of science, and thus produced such a work as is
demanded by the progressive spirit of the age.

All who have examined this book commend it in the highest terms.

"Mr.
Quackenbos
has long been favorably known
as a teacher and also a writer of educational books. This elementary work
on Natural Philosophy strikes us as being one of his most useful and
happy efforts."—
N. Y. Courier and Enquirer.

"A very complete system. We have been particularly struck with the
conciseness and intelligible character of the definitions and
explanations."—
N. Y. Observer.

"It is much the most complete and instructive school-book on Natural
Philosophy that we have ever seen."—
Christian Union, Louisville,
Ky.

"Every reasonable requirement is met in this new
work."—
Gazette, Pittsburg, Pa.

"The whole arrangement is decidedly superior to anything of the kind
that ever fell under our inspection."—
Post, Hartford,
Conn.

"It places the principles and rules of philosophy within the reach of
the young student in a most attractive form."—
Evening
Transcript, Boston.

The publishers have now the pleasure of presenting the abridgments of
Webster's American Dictionary in a carefully revised, greatly improved,
and, as nearly as possible, perfected form. The series is rendered
complete, and made to include a book just suited to every purpose for
which an abridgment of the complete work can be desired, by the
introduction of two new books, viz.: The Common School Dictionary,
Intermediate between the Primary School and the High School; and the
Counting-House and Family Dictionary, a much more full and comprehensive
abridgment than we have before offered. The other books in the series
have also been most carefully revised, and the new abridgments prepared,
by and under the direction of Prof. C. E. Goodrich and Mr. Wm. G.
Webster, with assistance from other most competent sources, no pains
having been spared to remove any, however slight, grounds for reasonable
objection which may have existed to the books in the old form, and to
render them as nearly perfect as possible, and yet more worthy the high
position they occupy as the

STANDARD DICTIONARIES OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE,

proved to be such by a sale many times greater than that of all other
dictionaries published in America combined, and acknowledged such by our
Courts of Justice, as well as the people at large.

The old stereotype plates having been much worn by the immense numbers
of books printed from them, the occasion has been embraced to make the
very thorough revision and improvement now completed. All the books in
the series are now printed, therefore, on

ENTIRELY NEW ELECTROTYPE PLATES,

and are uniform in Definitions, Orthography, Orthoepy, &c.

It is deemed unnecessary to enlarge upon the claims of these
well-known standard works.
Literally thousands
of testimonials to
their superiority to all others are in the hands of the publishers, from
the most eminent educational and literary men in all parts of the
country. From year to year their sale is steadily and rapidly increasing.
It is believed that the mere
increase
in the sale of these
abridgments the present year, will be greater than the entire combined
sale of all other American Dictionaries.

Class-Book of Physiology.

BY B. N. COMINGS, M. D.,

PROFESSOR OF PHYSIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, AND NATURAL HISTORY, IN CONNECTICUT STATE NORMAL SCHOOL.

12mo. 324 pages. Price $1 25.

REVISED EDITION, WITH AN APPENDIX.

Professor Comings' thorough acquaintance with every department of
Physiology, and his long experience as a teacher of that science, qualify
him in an eminent degree for preparing an accurate and useful text-book
on the subject. He has lost no opportunity of introducing practical
instructions in the principles of hygiene, thus not only making the pupil
acquainted with the wondrous workmanship of his own frame, but showing
him how to preserve it in a sound and healthy state. Avoiding technical
terms, as far as possible, he has brought the subject fully within the
comprehension of the young, and has clothed it with unusual interest, by
judicious references to the comparative physiology of the inferior
animals. Pictorial illustrations have been freely introduced, wherever it
was thought they could aid or interest the student.

Physiology cannot but be considered, by every intelligent and
reflecting mind, an exceedingly interesting and necessary study. It makes
us acquainted with the structure and uses of the organs of life, and the
laws by which we may keep them active and vigorous for the longest
period. The publishers would respectfully urge its importance on such
teachers as have not heretofore made it a regular branch in their
institutions; and would solicit, at the hands of all, an impartial
examination of what is pronounced by good judges, "the best elementary
text-book" on the science.

From
M. Y. Brown
, Principal of Webster School, New Haven.

"I have used Comings' Class-Book of Physiology for nearly two school
terms in the First Department of my school. I am happy to say that I
regard it the
best text-book
on this important branch with which I
have any acquaintance. The subjects are systematically arranged; the
principles, facts, and illustrations are clearly and fully represented to
the pupil. I find that his introduction of Comparative Anatomy and
Physics, tends greatly to increase the interest of the pupil in this

most important
and necessary study. I therefore can cheerfully
recommend this admirable work to my fellow-teachers as one of rare
excellence, and hope it may take the rank it deserves as a text-book upon
this subject."

From
Abraham Powelson, Jr.
, Teacher, Brooklyn, New York.

"After a very careful examination of the Class-Book of Physiology, by
Comings, I can freely say that I consider it a performance of superior
excellence. It embodies a fund of information surpassing in importance
and variety that of any other work of the kind which has come under my
notice."

Webster.

From

John C. Spencer

Unquestionably the very best Dictionary of our language extant. Its
great accuracy in the definition and derivation of words, gives it an
authority that no other work on the subject possesses. It is constantly
cited and relied on in our Courts of Justice, in our legislative bodies,
and in public discussions, as entirely conclusive.

From

Webster's great Dictionary may be regarded as bearing the same
relation to the English language which Newton's "

From

There is no American scholar who does not feel proud of the labors of
Dr. Webster as the pioneer of lexicography on this continent, and who
will not readily admit the great and distinctive merits of his
Dictionary.

From

Fitz Greene Halleck

Of the book itself I hear but one opinion from all around me, and do
but echo the universal voice in expressing my approval of its great
worth, and my belief that it has rendered any further research, or even
improvement in our time, unnecessary in its department of
instruction.

QUACKENBOS'S TEXT-BOOKS.

The Publishers invite particular attention to the following
school-books, by
G. P. Quackenbos, A. M.
They
have stood the test of criticism, and have become acknowledged standards
on the subjects of which they respectively treat. The secret of their
success is their perfect adaptation in style, language, and development
of the subject, to the pupil's comprehension. It is this that wins for
them a general introduction, and makes them special favorites with both
teacher and scholar.

By G. P. QUACKENBOS, A. M.

12mo. 450 pages. Price $1 25.

This work is an eminently clear and practical text-book, and embraces
a variety of important subjects, which have a common connection, and
mutually illustrate each other; but which the pupil has heretofore been
obliged to leave unlearned, or to search for among a number of different
volumes. Claiming to give a comprehensive and practical view of our
language in all its relations, this "Advanced Course" views it as a
whole, no less than with reference to the individual words composing it;
shows how it compares with other tongues; points out its beauties;
indicates how they may best be made available; and, in a word, teaches
the student the most philosophical method of digesting his thoughts, as
well as the most effective mode of expressing them.

It teaches Rhetoric not merely theoretically, like the old textbooks,
but
practically
, illustrating every point with exercises to be
prepared by the student, which at once test his familiarity with the
principles laid down, and impress them on his mind so vividly that they
can never be effaced.

Hon.
A. Constantine Barry
, State
Superintendent of the Common Schools of Wisconsin, in a Report to the
Legislature of that State, uses the following strong language in relation
to
Quackenbos's
works on Composition:

"It would be difficult to point out in these admirable books any thing
that we would desire to have altered; they meet our wants in every
respect, making no unreasonable draft on the time or patience of the
teacher, and leaving him no excuse for neglecting to make composition a
regular study, even with his younger classes. It is unnecessary to
compare these books with others on the subject, for
THERE ARE NONE THAT APPROACH THEM
in clearness,
comprehensiveness, excellence of arrangement, and above all, in direct
practical bearing. Affording an insight into the mechanism of language,
they will hardly fail to impart facility and grace of expression, and to
inspire a love for the beauties of literature."

From
Prof. John N. Pratt
, of the University of Alabama.

"I have been using
Quackenbos
on Composition
and Rhetoric in the instruction of my classes in the University, and I am
persuaded of its
GREAT EXCELLENCE
. The First
Lessons in Composition, by the same author, I regard as very useful for
beginners. Of these two books, I can speak with the greatest confidence,
and I do
MOST HEARTILY RECOMMEND THEM
to
all."

Illustrated School History

OF THE UNITED STATES,

From the Earliest Discoveries to the Present Time: embracing a Full Account of the Aborigines, Biographical Notice of Distinguished Men, and Numerous Maps, Plans of Battle-fields, and Pictorial Illustrations.

BY G. P. QUACKENBOS, A. M.

12mo. 473 pages. Price $1 25.

The Author has aimed to be
simple
, that youth of lower as well
as advanced classes may understand him;
clear
, that no indistinct
or erroneous impressions may be conveyed;
accurate
in the recital
of facts; and
interesting
as regards both matter and style.
Avoiding fragmentary statements, he has gone into detail sufficiently to
show events in their connections, convinced that a fairer idea of them is
thus imparted, and that facts otherwise dry may in this way be made
attractive and indelibly impressed on the mind. He has tried throughout
to be fair and national. He has neither introduced offensive allusions,
nor invidiously attempted to bias the minds of the young on controverted
questions connected with politics or religion.

The pronunciation of all difficult and foreign names is given in
brackets; and appropriate illustrations have been liberally provided.
Maps are as useful in history as in geography, and plans are often
essential to the lucid delineation of military movements. Both are here
presented wherever it was thought they would be of service.

In elegance of style, accuracy clearness, interest of narrative,
richness of illustration, and adaptation to the school-room, this History
is pronounced far in advance of every similar work heretofore
published.

From
Prof. H. D. Lathrop
, Gambier, Ohio.

It seems to me admirably adapted to the purpose intended. The style is
simple and attractive, the narrative accurate and sufficiently minute,
the illustrations appropriate and elegant, and the typographical
execution all that could be desired.

From
J. D. H. Corwine
, Principal Kentucky Liberal Institute.

I shall at once introduce it as
the best-work of the kind
on
this important branch of education.

From
Rev. Joseph Shackelford
, Principal Institute, Moulton, Ala.

I think it superior to many that I have examined as a school-book. I
have been using Wilson's, but I think this is a much better book for
schools.

From
Rev. Charles Reynolds
, Rector of Trinity Church, Columbus, Ohio.

It is a most delightful volume, and were I teaching a dozen classes in
United States History, I would use no other book but yours.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

KERFOL

As first published in Scribnerï¿½s Magazine, March 1916

I

ï¿½You ought to buy it,ï¿½ said my host; ï¿½itï¿½s just the place for a
solitary-minded devil like you. And it would be rather worth while to own
the most romantic house in Brittany. The present people are dead broke,
and itï¿½s going for a song—you ought to buy it.ï¿½

It was not with the least idea of living up to the character my friend
Lanrivain ascribed to me (as a matter of fact, under my unsociable
exterior I have always had secret yearnings for domesticity) that I took
his hint one autumn afternoon and went to Kerfol. My friend was motoring
over to Quimper on business: he dropped me on the way, at a cross-road on
a heath, and said: ï¿½First turn to the right and second to the left. Then
straight ahead till you see an avenue. If you meet any peasants, donï¿½t ask
your way. They donï¿½t understand French, and they would pretend they did
and mix you up. Iï¿½ll be back for you here by sunset—and donï¿½t forget
the tombs in the chapel.ï¿½

I followed Lanrivainï¿½s directions with the hesitation occasioned by the
usual difficulty of remembering whether he had said the first turn to the
right and second to the left, or the contrary. If I had met a peasant I
should certainly have asked, and probably been sent astray; but I had the
desert landscape to myself, and so stumbled on the right turn and walked
on across the heath till I came to an avenue. It was so unlike any other
avenue I have ever seen that I instantly knew it must be
the
avenue. The
grey-trunked trees sprang up straight to a great height and then interwove
their pale-grey branches in a long tunnel through which the autumn light
fell faintly. I know most trees by name, but I havenï¿½t to this day been
able to decide what those trees were. They had the tall curve of elms, the
tenuity of poplars, the ashen colour of olives under a rainy sky; and they
stretched ahead of me for half a mile or more without a break in their
arch. If ever I saw an avenue that unmistakably led to something, it was
the avenue at Kerfol. My heart beat a little as I began to walk down it.

Presently the trees ended and I came to a fortified gate in a long wall.
Between me and the wall was an open space of grass, with other grey
avenues radiating from it. Behind the wall were tall slate roofs mossed
with silver, a chapel belfry, the top of a keep. A moat filled with wild
shrubs and brambles surrounded the place; the drawbridge had been replaced
by a stone arch, and the portcullis by an iron gate. I stood for a long
time on the hither side of the moat, gazing about me, and letting the
influence of the place sink in. I said to myself: ï¿½If I wait long enough,
the guardian will turn up and show me the tombs—ï¿½ and I rather hoped
he wouldnï¿½t turn up too soon.

I sat down on a stone and lit a cigarette. As soon as I had done it, it
struck me as a puerile and portentous thing to do, with that great blind
house looking down at me, and all the empty avenues converging on me. It
may have been the depth of the silence that made me so conscious of my
gesture. The squeak of my match sounded as loud as the scraping of a
brake, and I almost fancied I heard it fall when I tossed it onto the
grass. But there was more than that: a sense of irrelevance, of
littleness, of childish bravado, in sitting there puffing my
cigarette-smoke into the face of such a past.

I knew nothing of the history of Kerfol—I was new to Brittany, and
Lanrivain had never mentioned the name to me till the day before—but
one couldnï¿½t as much as glance at that pile without feeling in it a long
accumulation of history. What kind of history I was not prepared to guess:
perhaps only the sheer weight of many associated lives and deaths which
gives a kind of majesty to all old houses. But the aspect of Kerfol
suggested something more—a perspective of stern and cruel memories
stretching away, like its own grey avenues, into a blur of darkness.

Certainly no house had ever more completely and finally broken with the
present. As it stood there, lifting its proud roofs and gables to the sky,
it might have been its own funeral monument. ï¿½Tombs in the chapel? The
whole place is a tomb!ï¿½ I reflected. I hoped more and more that the
guardian would not come. The details of the place, however striking, would
seem trivial compared with its collective impressiveness; and I wanted
only to sit there and be penetrated by the weight of its silence.

ï¿½Itï¿½s the very place for you!ï¿½ Lanrivain had said; and I was overcome by
the almost blasphemous frivolity of suggesting to any living being that
Kerfol was the place for him. ï¿½Is it possible that any one could
not
see—?ï¿½
I wondered. I did not finish the thought: what I meant was undefinable. I
stood up and wandered toward the gate. I was beginning to want to know
more; not to
see
more—I was by now so sure it was not a question of
seeing—but to feel more: feel all the place had to communicate. ï¿½But
to get in one will have to rout out the keeper,ï¿½ I thought reluctantly,
and hesitated. Finally I crossed the bridge and tried the iron gate. It
yielded, and I walked under the tunnel formed by the thickness of the
chemin de ronde. At the farther end, a wooden barricade had been laid
across the entrance, and beyond it I saw a court enclosed in noble
architecture. The main building faced me; and I now discovered that one
half was a mere ruined front, with gaping windows through which the wild
growths of the moat and the trees of the park were visible. The rest of
the house was still in its robust beauty. One end abutted on the round
tower, the other on the small traceried chapel, and in an angle of the
building stood a graceful well-head adorned with mossy urns. A few roses
grew against the walls, and on an upper window-sill I remember noticing a
pot of fuchsias.

My sense of the pressure of the invisible began to yield to my
architectural interest. The building was so fine that I felt a desire to
explore it for its own sake. I looked about the court, wondering in which
corner the guardian lodged. Then I pushed open the barrier and went in. As
I did so, a little dog barred my way. He was such a remarkably beautiful
little dog that for a moment he made me forget the splendid place he was
defending. I was not sure of his breed at the time, but have since learned
that it was Chinese, and that he was of a rare variety called the
ï¿½Sleeve-dog.ï¿½ He was very small and golden brown, with large brown eyes
and a ruffled throat: he looked rather like a large tawny chrysanthemum. I
said to myself: ï¿½These little beasts always snap and scream, and somebody
will be out in a minute.ï¿½

The little animal stood before me, forbidding, almost menacing: there was
anger in his large brown eyes. But he made no sound, he came no nearer.
Instead, as I advanced, he gradually fell back, and I noticed that another
dog, a vague rough brindled thing, had limped up. ï¿½Thereï¿½ll be a hubbub
now,ï¿½ I thought; for at the same moment a third dog, a long-haired white
mongrel, slipped out of a doorway and joined the others. All three stood
looking at me with grave eyes; but not a sound came from them. As I
advanced they continued to fall back on muffled paws, still watching me.
ï¿½At a given point, theyï¿½ll all charge at my ankles: itï¿½s one of the dodges
that dogs who live together put up on one,ï¿½ I thought. I was not much
alarmed, for they were neither large nor formidable. But they let me
wander about the court as I pleased, following me at a little distance—always
the same distance—and always keeping their eyes on me. Presently I
looked across at the ruined facade, and saw that in one of its
window-frames another dog stood: a large white pointer with one brown ear.
He was an old grave dog, much more experienced than the others; and he
seemed to be observing me with a deeper intentness.

ï¿½Iï¿½ll hear from
him
,ï¿½ I said to myself; but he stood in the empty
window-frame, against the trees of the park, and continued to watch me
without moving. I looked back at him for a time, to see if the sense that
he was being watched would not rouse him. Half the width of the court lay
between us, and we stared at each other silently across it. But he did not
stir, and at last I turned away. Behind me I found the rest of the pack,
with a newcomer added: a small black greyhound with pale agate-coloured
eyes. He was shivering a little, and his expression was more timid than
that of the others. I noticed that he kept a little behind them. And still
there was not a sound.

I stood there for fully five minutes, the circle about me—waiting,
as they seemed to be waiting. At last I went up to the little golden-brown
dog and stooped to pat him. As I did so, I heard myself laugh. The little
dog did not start, or growl, or take his eyes from me—he simply
slipped back about a yard, and then paused and continued to look at me.
ï¿½Oh, hang it!ï¿½ I exclaimed aloud, and walked across the court toward the
well.

As I advanced, the dogs separated and slid away into different corners of
the court. I examined the urns on the well, tried a locked door or two,
and up and down the dumb facade; then I faced about toward the chapel.
When I turned I perceived that all the dogs had disappeared except the old
pointer, who still watched me from the empty window-frame. It was rather a
relief to be rid of that cloud of witnesses; and I began to look about me
for a way to the back of the house. ï¿½Perhaps thereï¿½ll be somebody in the
garden,ï¿½ I thought. I found a way across the moat, scrambled over a wall
smothered in brambles, and got into the garden. A few lean hydrangeas and
geraniums pined in the flower-beds, and the ancient house looked down on
them indifferently. Its garden side was plainer and severer than the
other: the long granite front, with its few windows and steep roof, looked
like a fortress-prison. I walked around the farther wing, went up some
disjointed steps, and entered the deep twilight of a narrow and incredibly
old box-walk. The walk was just wide enough for one person to slip
through, and its branches met overhead. It was like the ghost of a
box-walk, its lustrous green all turning to the shadowy greyness of the
avenues. I walked on and on, the branches hitting me in the face and
springing back with a dry rattle; and at length I came out on the grassy
top of the chemin de ronde. I walked along it to the gate-tower, looking
down into the court, which was just below me. Not a human being was in
sight; and neither were the dogs. I found a flight of steps in the
thickness of the wall and went down them; and when I emerged again into
the court, there stood the circle of dogs, the golden-brown one a little
ahead of the others, the black greyhound shivering in the rear.

ï¿½Oh, hang it—you uncomfortable beasts, you!ï¿½ I exclaimed, my voice
startling me with a sudden echo. The dogs stood motionless, watching me. I
knew by this time that they would not try to prevent my approaching the
house, and the knowledge left me free to examine them. I had a feeling
that they must be horribly cowed to be so silent and inert. Yet they did
not look hungry or ill-treated. Their coats were smooth and they were not
thin, except the shivering greyhound. It was more as if they had lived a
long time with people who never spoke to them or looked at them: as though
the silence of the place had gradually benumbed their busy inquisitive
natures. And this strange passivity, this almost human lassitude, seemed
to me sadder than the misery of starved and beaten animals. I should have
liked to rouse them for a minute, to coax them into a game or a scamper;
but the longer I looked into their fixed and weary eyes the more
preposterous the idea became. With the windows of that house looking down
on us, how could I have imagined such a thing? The dogs knew better:
they

knew what the house would tolerate and what it would not. I even fancied
that they knew what was passing through my mind, and pitied me for my
frivolity. But even that feeling probably reached them through a thick fog
of listlessness. I had an idea that their distance from me was as nothing
to my remoteness from them. In the last analysis, the impression they
produced was that of having in common one memory so deep and dark that
nothing that had happened since was worth either a growl or a wag.

ï¿½I say,ï¿½ I broke out abruptly, addressing myself to the dumb circle, ï¿½do
you know what you look like, the whole lot of you? You look as if youï¿½d
seen a ghost—thatï¿½s how you look! I wonder if there
is
a ghost here,
and nobody but you left for it to appear to?ï¿½ The dogs continued to gaze
at me without moving...

It was dark when I saw Lanrivainï¿½s motor lamps at the cross-roads—and
I wasnï¿½t exactly sorry to see them. I had the sense of having escaped from
the loneliest place in the whole world, and of not liking loneliness—to
that degree—as much as I had imagined I should. My friend had
brought his solicitor back from Quimper for the night, and seated beside a
fat and affable stranger I felt no inclination to talk of Kerfol...

But that evening, when Lanrivain and the solicitor were closeted in the
study, Madame de Lanrivain began to question me in the drawing-room.

ï¿½Well—are you going to buy Kerfol?ï¿½ she asked, tilting up her gay
chin from her embroidery.

ï¿½I havenï¿½t decided yet. The fact is, I couldnï¿½t get into the house,ï¿½ I
said, as if I had simply postponed my decision, and meant to go back for
another look.

ï¿½You couldnï¿½t get in? Why, what happened? The family are mad to sell the
place, and the old guardian has orders—ï¿½

ï¿½Very likely. But the old guardian wasnï¿½t there.ï¿½

ï¿½What a pity! He must have gone to market. But his daughter—?ï¿½

ï¿½There was nobody about. At least I saw no one.ï¿½

ï¿½How extraordinary! Literally nobody?ï¿½

ï¿½Nobody but a lot of dogs—a whole pack of them—who seemed to
have the place to themselves.ï¿½

Madame de Lanrivain let the embroidery slip to her knee and folded her
hands on it. For several minutes she looked at me thoughtfully.

ï¿½A pack of dogs—you
saw
them?ï¿½

ï¿½Saw them? I saw nothing else!ï¿½

ï¿½How many?ï¿½ She dropped her voice a little. ï¿½Iï¿½ve always wondered—ï¿½

I looked at her with surprise: I had supposed the place to be familiar to
her. ï¿½Have you never been to Kerfol?ï¿½ I asked.

ï¿½Oh, yes: often. But never on that day.ï¿½

ï¿½What day?ï¿½

ï¿½Iï¿½d quite forgotten—and so had Hervï¿½, Iï¿½m sure. If weï¿½d remembered,
we never should have sent you today—but then, after all, one doesnï¿½t
half believe that sort of thing, does one?ï¿½

ï¿½What sort of thing?ï¿½ I asked, involuntarily sinking my voice to the level
of hers. Inwardly I was thinking: ï¿½I
knew
there was something...ï¿½

Madame de Lanrivain cleared her throat and produced a reassuring smile.
ï¿½Didnï¿½t Hervï¿½ tell you the story of Kerfol? An ancestor of his was mixed
up in it. You know every Breton house has its ghost-story; and some of
them are rather unpleasant.ï¿½

ï¿½Yes—but those dogs?ï¿½ I insisted.

ï¿½Well, those dogs are the ghosts of Kerfol. At least, the peasants say
thereï¿½s one day in the year when a lot of dogs appear there; and that day
the keeper and his daughter go off to Morlaix and get drunk. The women in
Brittany drink dreadfully.ï¿½ She stooped to match a silk; then she lifted
her charming inquisitive Parisian face: ï¿½Did you
really
see a lot of dogs?
There isnï¿½t one at Kerfol,ï¿½ she said.

II

Lanrivain, the next day, hunted out a shabby calf volume from the back of
an upper shelf of his library.

ï¿½Yes—here it is. What does it call itself? A History of the Assizes
of the Duchy of Brittany. Quimper, 1702. The book was written about a
hundred years later than the Kerfol affair; but I believe the account is
transcribed pretty literally from the judicial records. Anyhow, itï¿½s queer
reading. And thereï¿½s a Hervï¿½ de Lanrivain mixed up in it—not exactly

my
style, as youï¿½ll see. But then heï¿½s only a collateral. Here, take the
book up to bed with you. I donï¿½t exactly remember the details; but after
youï¿½ve read it Iï¿½ll bet anything youï¿½ll leave your light burning all
night!ï¿½

I left my light burning all night, as he had predicted; but it was chiefly
because, till near dawn, I was absorbed in my reading. The account of the
trial of Anne de Cornault, wife of the lord of Kerfol, was long and
closely printed. It was, as my friend had said, probably an almost literal
transcription of what took place in the court-room; and the trial lasted
nearly a month. Besides, the type of the book was detestable...

At first I thought of translating the old record literally. But it is full
of wearisome repetitions, and the main lines of the story are forever
straying off into side issues. So I have tried to disentangle it, and give
it here in a simpler form. At times, however, I have reverted to the text
because no other words could have conveyed so exactly the sense of what I
felt at Kerfol; and nowhere have I added anything of my own.

III

It was in the year 16— that Yves de Cornault, lord of the domain of
Kerfol, went to the
pardon
of Locronan to perform his religious duties. He
was a rich and powerful noble, then in his sixty-second year, but hale and
sturdy, a great horseman and hunter and a pious man. So all his neighbours
attested. In appearance he seems to have been short and broad, with a
swarthy face, legs slightly bowed from the saddle, a hanging nose and
broad hands with black hairs on them. He had married young and lost his
wife and son soon after, and since then had lived alone at Kerfol. Twice a
year he went to Morlaix, where he had a handsome house by the river, and
spent a week or ten days there; and occasionally he rode to Rennes on
business. Witnesses were found to declare that during these absences he
led a life different from the one he was known to lead at Kerfol, where he
busied himself with his estate, attended mass daily, and found his only
amusement in hunting the wild boar and water-fowl. But these rumours are
not particularly relevant, and it is certain that among people of his own
class in the neighbourhood he passed for a stern and even austere man,
observant of his religious obligations, and keeping strictly to himself.
There was no talk of any familiarity with the women on his estate, though
at that time the nobility were very free with their peasants. Some people
said he had never looked at a woman since his wifeï¿½s death; but such
things are hard to prove, and the evidence on this point was not worth
much.

Well, in his sixty-second year, Yves de Cornault went to the
pardon
at
Locronan, and saw there a young lady of Douarnenez, who had ridden over
pillion behind her father to do her duty to the saint. Her name was Anne
de Barrigan, and she came of good old Breton stock, but much less great
and powerful than that of Yves de Cornault; and her father had squandered
his fortune at cards, and lived almost like a peasant in his little
granite manor on the moors... I have said I would add nothing of my own to
this bald statement of a strange case; but I must interrupt myself here to
describe the young lady who rode up to the lych-gate of Locronan at the
very moment when the Baron de Cornault was also dismounting there. I take
my description from a rather rare thing: a faded drawing in red crayon,
sober and truthful enough to be by a late pupil of the Clouets, which
hangs in Lanrivainï¿½s study, and is said to be a portrait of Anne de
Barrigan. It is unsigned and has no mark of identity but the initials A.
B., and the date 16—, the year after her marriage. It represents a
young woman with a small oval face, almost pointed, yet wide enough for a
full mouth with a tender depression at the corners. The nose is small, and
the eyebrows are set rather high, far apart, and as lightly pencilled as
the eyebrows in a Chinese painting. The forehead is high and serious, and
the hair, which one feels to be fine and thick and fair, drawn off it and
lying close like a cap. The eyes are neither large nor small, hazel
probably, with a look at once shy and steady. A pair of beautiful long
hands are crossed below the ladyï¿½s breast...

The chaplain of Kerfol, and other witnesses, averred that when the Baron
came back from Locronan he jumped from his horse, ordered another to be
instantly saddled, called to a young page come with him, and rode away
that same evening to the south. His steward followed the next morning with
coffers laden on a pair of pack mules. The following week Yves de Cornault
rode back to Kerfol, sent for his vassals and tenants, and told them he
was to be married at All Saints to Anne de Barrigan of Douarnenez. And on
All Saintsï¿½ Day the marriage took place.

As to the next few years, the evidence on both sides seems to show that
they passed happily for the couple. No one was found to say that Yves de
Cornault had been unkind to his wife, and it was plain to all that he was
content with his bargain. Indeed, it was admitted by the chaplain and
other witnesses for the prosecution that the young lady had a softening
influence on her husband, and that he became less exacting with his
tenants, less harsh to peasants and dependents, and less subject to the
fits of gloomy silence which had darkened his widow-hood. As to his wife,
the only grievance her champions could call up in her behalf was that
Kerfol was a lonely place, and that when her husband was away on business
at Rennes or Morlaix—whither she was never taken—she was not
allowed so much as to walk in the park unaccompanied. But no one asserted
that she was unhappy, though one servant-woman said she had surprised her
crying, and had heard her say that she was a woman accursed to have no
child, and nothing in life to call her own. But that was a natural enough
feeling in a wife attached to her husband; and certainly it must have been
a great grief to Yves de Cornault that she gave him no son. Yet he never
made her feel her childlessness as a reproach—she herself admits
this in her evidence—but seemed to try to make her forget it by
showering gifts and favours on her. Rich though he was, he had never been
open-handed; but nothing was too fine for his wife, in the way of silks or
gems or linen, or whatever else she fancied. Every wandering merchant was
welcome at Kerfol, and when the master was called away he never came back
without bringing his wife a handsome present—something curious and
particular—from Morlaix or Rennes or Quimper. One of the
waiting-women gave, in cross-examination, an interesting list of one
yearï¿½s gifts, which I copy. From Morlaix, a carved ivory junk, with
Chinamen at the oars, that a strange sailor had brought back as a votive
offering for Notre Dame de la Clartï¿½, above Ploumanacï¿½h; from Quimper, an
embroidered gown, worked by the nuns of the Assumption; from Rennes, a
silver rose that opened and showed an amber Virgin with a crown of
garnets; from Morlaix, again, a length of Damascus velvet shot with gold,
bought of a Jew from Syria; and for Michaelmas that same year, from
Rennes, a necklet or bracelet of round stones—emeralds and pearls
and rubies—strung like beads on a gold wire. This was the present
that pleased the lady best, the woman said. Later on, as it happened, it
was produced at the trial, and appears to have struck the Judges and the
public as a curious and valuable jewel.

The very same winter, the Baron absented himself again, this time as far
as Bordeaux, and on his return he brought his wife something even odder
and prettier than the bracelet. It was a winter evening when he rode up to
Kerfol and, walking into the hall, found her sitting listlessly by the
fire, her chin on her hand, looking into the fire. He carried a velvet box
in his hand and, setting it down on the hearth, lifted the lid and let out
a little golden-brown dog.

Anne de Cornault exclaimed with pleasure as the little creature bounded
toward her. ï¿½Oh, it looks like a bird or a butterfly!ï¿½ she cried as she
picked it up; and the dog put its paws on her shoulders and looked at her
with eyes ï¿½like a Christianï¿½s.ï¿½ After that she would never have it out of
her sight, and petted and talked to it as if it had been a child—as
indeed it was the nearest thing to a child she was to know. Yves de
Cornault was much pleased with his purchase. The dog had been brought to
him by a sailor from an East India merchantman, and the sailor had bought
it of a pilgrim in a bazaar at Jaffa, who had stolen it from a noblemanï¿½s
wife in China: a perfectly permissible thing to do, since the pilgrim was
a Christian and the nobleman a heathen doomed to hellfire. Yves de
Cornault had paid a long price for the dog, for they were beginning to be
in demand at the French court, and the sailor knew he had got hold of a
good thing; but Anneï¿½s pleasure was so great that, to see her laugh and
play with the little animal, her husband would doubtless have given twice
the sum.

So far, all the evidence is at one, and the narrative plain sailing; but
now the steering becomes difficult. I will try to keep as nearly as
possible to Anneï¿½s own statements; though toward the end, poor thing...

Well, to go back. The very year after the little brown dog was brought to
Kerfol, Yves de Cornault, one winter night, was found dead at the head of
a narrow flight of stairs leading down from his wifeï¿½s rooms to a door
opening on the court. It was his wife who found him and gave the alarm, so
distracted, poor wretch, with fear and horror—for his blood was all
over her—that at first the roused household could not make out what
she was saying, and thought she had gone suddenly mad. But there, sure
enough, at the top of the stairs lay her husband, stone dead, and head
foremost, the blood from his wounds dripping down to the steps below him.
He had been dreadfully scratched and gashed about the face and throat, as
if with a dull weapon; and one of his legs had a deep tear in it which had
cut an artery, and probably caused his death. But how did he come there,
and who had murdered him?

His wife declared that she had been asleep in her bed, and hearing his cry
had rushed out to find him lying on the stairs; but this was immediately
questioned. In the first place, it was proved that from her room she could
not have heard the struggle on the stairs, owing to the thickness of the
walls and the length of the intervening passage; then it was evident that
she had not been in bed and asleep, since she was dressed when she roused
the house, and her bed had not been slept in. Moreover, the door at the
bottom of the stairs was ajar, and the key in the lock; and it was noticed
by the chaplain (an observant man) that the dress she wore was stained
with blood about the knees, and that there were traces of small
blood-stained hands low down on the staircase walls, so that it was
conjectured that she had really been at the postern-door when her husband
fell and, feeling her way up to him in the darkness on her hands and
knees, had been stained by his blood dripping down on her. Of course it
was argued on the other side that the blood-marks on her dress might have
been caused by her kneeling down by her husband when she rushed out of her
room; but there was the open door below, and the fact that the fingermarks
in the staircase all pointed upward.

The accused held to her statement for the first two days, in spite of its
improbability; but on the third day word was brought to her that Hervï¿½ de
Lanrivain, a young nobleman of the neighbourhood, had been arrested for
complicity in the crime. Two or three witnesses thereupon came forward to
say that it was known throughout the country that Lanrivain had formerly
been on good terms with the lady of Cornault; but that he had been absent
from Brittany for over a year, and people had ceased to associate their
names. The witnesses who made this statement were not of a very reputable
sort. One was an old herb-gatherer suspected of witch-craft, another a
drunken clerk from a neighbouring parish, the third a half-witted shepherd
who could be made to say anything; and it was clear that the prosecution
was not satisfied with its case, and would have liked to find more
definite proof of Lanrivainï¿½s complicity than the statement of the
herb-gatherer, who swore to having seen him climbing the wall of the park
on the night of the murder. One way of patching out incomplete proofs in
those days was to put some sort of pressure, moral or physical, on the
accused person. It is not clear what pressure was put on Anne de Cornault;
but on the third day, when she was brought into court, she ï¿½appeared weak
and wandering,ï¿½ and after being encouraged to collect herself and speak
the truth, on her honour and the wounds of her Blessed Redeemer, she
confessed that she had in fact gone down the stairs to speak with Hervï¿½ de
Lanrivain (who denied everything), and had been surprised there by the
sound of her husbandï¿½s fall. That was better; and the prosecution rubbed
its hands with satisfaction. The satisfaction increased when various
dependents living at Kerfol were induced to say—with apparent
sincerity—that during the year or two preceding his death their
master had once more grown uncertain and irascible, and subject to the
fits of brooding silence which his household had learned to dread before
his second marriage. This seemed to show that things had not been going
well at Kerfol; though no one could be found to say that there had been
any signs of open disagreement between husband and wife.

Anne de Cornault, when questioned as to her reason for going down at night
to open the door to Hervï¿½ de Lanrivain, made an answer which must have
sent a smile around the court. She said it was because she was lonely and
wanted to talk with the young man. Was this the only reason? she was
asked; and replied: ï¿½Yes, by the Cross over your Lordshipsï¿½ heads.ï¿½ ï¿½But
why at midnight?ï¿½ the court asked. ï¿½Because I could see him in no other
way.ï¿½ I can see the exchange of glances across the ermine collars under
the Crucifix.

Anne de Cornault, further questioned, said that her married life had been
extremely lonely: ï¿½desolateï¿½ was the word she used. It was true that her
husband seldom spoke harshly to her; but there were days when he did not
speak at all. It was true that he had never struck or threatened her; but
he kept her like a prisoner at Kerfol, and when he rode away to Morlaix or
Quimper or Rennes he set so close a watch on her that she could not pick a
flower in the garden without having a waiting-woman at her heels. ï¿½I am no
Queen, to need such honours,ï¿½ she once said to him; and he had answered
that a man who has a treasure does not leave the key in the lock when he
goes out. ï¿½Then take me with you,ï¿½ she urged; but to this he said that
towns were pernicious places, and young wives better off at their own
firesides.

ï¿½But what did you want to say to Hervï¿½ de Lanrivain?ï¿½ the court asked; and
she answered: ï¿½To ask him to take me away.ï¿½

ï¿½Ah—you confess that you went down to him with adulterous thoughts?ï¿½

ï¿½No.ï¿½

ï¿½Then why did you want him to take you away?ï¿½

ï¿½Because I was afraid for my life.ï¿½

ï¿½Of whom were you afraid?ï¿½

ï¿½Of my husband.ï¿½

ï¿½Why were you afraid of your husband?ï¿½

ï¿½Because he had strangled my little dog.ï¿½

Another smile must have passed around the court-room: in days when any
nobleman had a right to hang his peasants—and most of them exercised
it—pinching a pet animalï¿½s wind-pipe was nothing to make a fuss
about.

At this point one of the Judges, who appears to have had a certain
sympathy for the accused, suggested that she should be allowed to explain
herself in her own way; and she thereupon made the following statement.

The first years of her marriage had been lonely; but her husband had not
been unkind to her. If she had had a child she would not have been
unhappy; but the days were long, and it rained too much.

It was true that her husband, whenever he went away and left her, brought
her a handsome present on his return; but this did not make up for the
loneliness. At least nothing had, till he brought her the little brown dog
from the East: after that she was much less unhappy. Her husband seemed
pleased that she was so fond of the dog; he gave her leave to put her
jewelled bracelet around its neck, and to keep it always with her.

One day she had fallen asleep in her room, with the dog at her feet, as
his habit was. Her feet were bare and resting on his back. Suddenly she
was waked by her husband: he stood beside her, smiling not unkindly.

ï¿½You look like my great-grandmother, Juliane de Cornault, lying in the
chapel with her feet on a little dog,ï¿½ he said.

The analogy sent a chill through her, but she laughed and answered: ï¿½Well,
when I am dead you must put me beside her, carved in marble, with my dog
at my feet.ï¿½

ï¿½Oho—weï¿½ll wait and see,ï¿½ he said, laughing also, but with his black
brows close together. ï¿½The dog is the emblem of fidelity.ï¿½

ï¿½And do you doubt my right to lie with mine at my feet?ï¿½

ï¿½When Iï¿½m in doubt I find out,ï¿½ he answered. ï¿½I am an old man,ï¿½ he added,
ï¿½and people say I make you lead a lonely life. But I swear you shall have
your monument if you earn it.ï¿½

ï¿½And I swear to be faithful,ï¿½ she returned, ï¿½if only for the sake of
having my little dog at my feet.ï¿½

Not long afterward he went on business to the Quimper Assizes; and while
he was away his aunt, the widow of a great nobleman of the duchy, came to
spend a night at Kerfol on her way to the
pardon
of Ste. Barbe. She was a
woman of great piety and consequence, and much respected by Yves de
Cornault, and when she proposed to Anne to go with her to Ste. Barbe no
one could object, and even the chaplain declared himself in favour of the
pilgrimage. So Anne set out for Ste. Barbe, and there for the first time
she talked with Hervï¿½ de Lanrivain. He had come once or twice to Kerfol
with his father, but she had never before exchanged a dozen words with
him. They did not talk for more than five minutes now: it was under the
chestnuts, as the procession was coming out of the chapel. He said: ï¿½I
pity you,ï¿½ and she was surprised, for she had not supposed that any one
thought her an object of pity. He added: ï¿½Call for me when you need me,ï¿½
and she smiled a little, but was glad afterward, and thought often of the
meeting.

She confessed to having seen him three times afterward: not more. How or
where she would not say—one had the impression that she feared to
implicate some one. Their meetings had been rare and brief; and at the
last he had told her that he was starting the next day for a foreign
country, on a mission which was not without peril and might keep him for
many months absent. He asked her for a remembrance, and she had none to
give him but the collar about the little dogï¿½s neck. She was sorry
afterward that she had given it, but he was so unhappy at going that she
had not had the courage to refuse.

Her husband was away at the time. When he returned a few days later he
picked up the little dog to pet it, and noticed that its collar was
missing. His wife told him that the dog had lost it in the undergrowth of
the park, and that she and her maids had hunted a whole day for it. It was
true, she explained to the court, that she had made the maids search for
the necklet—they all believed the dog had lost it in the park...

Her husband made no comment, and that evening at supper he was in his
usual mood, between good and bad: you could never tell which. He talked a
good deal, describing what he had seen and done at Rennes; but now and
then he stopped and looked hard at her; and when she went to bed she found
her little dog strangled on her pillow. The little thing was dead, but
still warm; she stooped to lift it, and her distress turned to horror when
she discovered that it had been strangled by twisting twice round its
throat the necklet she had given to Lanrivain.

The next morning at dawn she buried the dog in the garden, and hid the
necklet in her breast. She said nothing to her husband, then or later, and
he said nothing to her; but that day he had a peasant hanged for stealing
a faggot in the park, and the next day he nearly beat to death a young
horse he was breaking.

Winter set in, and the short days passed, and the long nights, one by one;
and she heard nothing of Hervï¿½ de Lanrivain. It might be that her husband
had killed him; or merely that he had been robbed of the necklet. Day
after day by the hearth among the spinning maids, night after night alone
on her bed, she wondered and trembled. Sometimes at table her husband
looked across at her and smiled; and then she felt sure that Lanrivain was
dead. She dared not try to get news of him, for she was sure her husband
would find out if she did: she had an idea that he could find out
anything. Even when a witch-woman who was a noted seer, and could show you
the whole world in her crystal, came to the castle for a nightï¿½s shelter,
and the maids flocked to her, Anne held back. The winter was long and
black and rainy. One day, in Yves de Cornaultï¿½s absence, some gypsies came
to Kerfol with a troop of performing dogs. Anne bought the smallest and
cleverest, a white dog with a feathery coat and one blue and one brown
eye. It seemed to have been ill-treated by the gypsies, and clung to her
plaintively when she took it from them. That evening her husband came
back, and when she went to bed she found the dog strangled on her pillow.

After that she said to herself that she would never have another dog; but
one bitter cold evening a poor lean greyhound was found whining at the
castle-gate, and she took him in and forbade the maids to speak of him to
her husband. She hid him in a room that no one went to, smuggled food to
him from her own plate, made him a warm bed to lie on and petted him like
a child.

Yves de Cornault came home, and the next day she found the greyhound
strangled on her pillow. She wept in secret, but said nothing, and
resolved that even if she met a dog dying of hunger she would never bring
him into the castle; but one day she found a young sheep-dog, a brindled
puppy with good blue eyes, lying with a broken leg in the snow of the
park. Yves de Cornault was at Rennes, and she brought the dog in, warmed
and fed it, tied up its leg and hid it in the castle till her husbandï¿½s
return. The day before, she gave it to a peasant woman who lived a long
way off, and paid her handsomely to care for it and say nothing; but that
night she heard a whining and scratching at her door, and when she opened
it the lame puppy, drenched and shivering, jumped up on her with little
sobbing barks. She hid him in her bed, and the next morning was about to
have him taken back to the peasant woman when she heard her husband ride
into the court. She shut the dog in a chest and went down to receive him.
An hour or two later, when she returned to her room, the puppy lay
strangled on her pillow...

After that she dared not make a pet of any other dog; and her loneliness
became almost unendurable. Sometimes, when she crossed the court of the
castle, and thought no one was looking, she stopped to pat the old pointer
at the gate. But one day as she was caressing him her husband came out of
the chapel; and the next day the old dog was gone...

This curious narrative was not told in one sitting of the court, or
received without impatience and incredulous comment. It was plain that the
Judges were surprised by its puerility, and that it did not help the
accused in the eyes of the public. It was an odd tale, certainly; but what
did it prove? That Yves de Cornault disliked dogs, and that his wife, to
gratify her own fancy, persistently ignored this dislike. As for pleading
this trivial disagreement as an excuse for her relations—whatever
their nature—with her supposed accomplice, the argument was so
absurd that her own lawyer manifestly regretted having let her make use of
it, and tried several times to cut short her story. But she went on to the
end, with a kind of hypnotized insistence, as though the scenes she evoked
were so real to her that she had forgotten where she was and imagined
herself to be re-living them.

At length the Judge who had previously shown a certain kindness to her
said (leaning forward a little, one may suppose, from his row of dozing
colleagues): ï¿½Then you would have us believe that you murdered your
husband because he would not let you keep a pet dog?ï¿½

ï¿½I did not murder my husband.ï¿½

ï¿½Who did, then? Hervï¿½ de Lanrivain?ï¿½

ï¿½No.ï¿½

ï¿½Who then? Can you tell us?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes, I can tell you. The dogs—ï¿½ At that point she was carried out
of the court in a swoon.

.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

It was evident that her lawyer tried to get her to abandon this line of
defense. Possibly her explanation, whatever it was, had seemed convincing
when she poured it out to him in the heat of their first private colloquy;
but now that it was exposed to the cold daylight of judicial scrutiny, and
the banter of the town, he was thoroughly ashamed of it, and would have
sacrificed her without a scruple to save his professional reputation. But
the obstinate Judge—who perhaps, after all, was more inquisitive
than kindly—evidently wanted to hear the story out, and she was
ordered, the next day, to continue her deposition.

She said that after the disappearance of the old watch-dog nothing
particular happened for a month or two. Her husband was much as usual: she
did not remember any special incident. But one evening a pedlar woman came
to the castle and was selling trinkets to the maids. She had no heart for
trinkets, but she stood looking on while the women made their choice. And
then, she did not know how, but the pedlar coaxed her into buying for
herself an odd pear-shaped pomander with a strong scent in it—she
had once seen something of the kind on a gypsy woman. She had no desire
for the pomander, and did not know why she had bought it. The pedlar said
that whoever wore it had the power to read the future; but she did not
really believe that, or care much either. However, she bought the thing
and took it up to her room, where she sat turning it about in her hand.
Then the strange scent attracted her and she began to wonder what kind of
spice was in the box. She opened it and found a grey bean rolled in a
strip of paper; and on the paper she saw a sign she knew, and a message
from Hervï¿½ de Lanrivain, saying that he was at home again and would be at
the door in the court that night after the moon had set...

She burned the paper and then sat down to think. It was nightfall, and her
husband was at home... She had no way of warning Lanrivain, and there was
nothing to do but to wait...

At this point I fancy the drowsy courtroom beginning to wake up. Even to
the oldest hand on the bench there must have been a certain aesthetic
relish in picturing the feelings of a woman on receiving such a message at
night-fall from a man living twenty miles away, to whom she had no means
of sending a warning...

She was not a clever woman, I imagine; and as the first result of her
cogitation she appears to have made the mistake of being, that evening,
too kind to her husband. She could not ply him with wine, according to the
traditional expedient, for though he drank heavily at times he had a
strong head; and when he drank beyond its strength it was because he chose
to, and not because a woman coaxed him. Not his wife, at any rate—she
was an old story by now. As I read the case, I fancy there was no feeling
for her left in him but the hatred occasioned by his supposed dishonour.

At any rate, she tried to call up her old graces; but early in the evening
he complained of pains and fever, and left the hall to go up to his room.
His servant carried him a cup of hot wine, and brought back word that he
was sleeping and not to be disturbed; and an hour later, when Anne lifted
the tapestry and listened at his door, she heard his loud regular
breathing. She thought it might be a feint, and stayed a long time
barefooted in the cold passage, her ear to the crack; but the breathing
went on too steadily and naturally to be other than that of a man in a
sound sleep. She crept back to her room reassured, and stood in the window
watching the moon set through the trees of the park. The sky was misty and
starless, and after the moon went down the night was pitch black. She knew
the time had come, and stole along the passage, past her husbandï¿½s door—where
she stopped again to listen to his breathing—to the top of the
stairs. There she paused a moment, and assured herself that no one was
following her; then she began to go down the stairs in the darkness. They
were so steep and winding that she had to go very slowly, for fear of
stumbling. Her one thought was to get the door unbolted, tell Lanrivain to
make his escape, and hasten back to her room. She had tried the bolt
earlier in the evening, and managed to put a little grease on it; but
nevertheless, when she drew it, it gave a squeak... not loud, but it made
her heart stop; and the next minute, overhead, she heard a noise...

ï¿½What noise?ï¿½ the prosecution interposed.

ï¿½My husbandï¿½s voice calling out my name and cursing me.ï¿½

ï¿½What did you hear after that?ï¿½

ï¿½A terrible scream and a fall.ï¿½

ï¿½Where was Hervï¿½ de Lanrivain at this time?ï¿½

ï¿½He was standing outside in the court. I just made him out in the
darkness. I told him for Godï¿½s sake to go, and then I pushed the door
shut.ï¿½

ï¿½What did you do next?ï¿½

ï¿½I stood at the foot of the stairs and listened.ï¿½

ï¿½What did you hear?ï¿½

ï¿½I heard dogs snarling and panting.ï¿½ (Visible discouragement of the bench,
boredom of the public, and exasperation of the lawyer for the defense.
Dogs again—! But the inquisitive Judge insisted.)

ï¿½What dogs?ï¿½

She bent her head and spoke so low that she had to be told to repeat her
answer: ï¿½I donï¿½t know.ï¿½

ï¿½How do you mean—you donï¿½t know?ï¿½

ï¿½I donï¿½t know what dogs...ï¿½

The Judge again intervened: ï¿½Try to tell us exactly what happened. How
long did you remain at the foot of the stairs?ï¿½

ï¿½Only a few minutes.ï¿½

ï¿½And what was going on meanwhile overhead?ï¿½

ï¿½The dogs kept on snarling and panting. Once or twice he cried out. I
think he moaned once. Then he was quiet.ï¿½

ï¿½Then what happened?ï¿½

ï¿½Then I heard a sound like the noise of a pack when the wolf is thrown to
them—gulping and lapping.ï¿½

(There was a groan of disgust and repulsion through the court, and another
attempted intervention by the distracted lawyer. But the inquisitive Judge
was still inquisitive.)

ï¿½And all the while you did not go up?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes—I went up then—to drive them off.ï¿½

ï¿½The dogs?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes.ï¿½

ï¿½Well—?ï¿½

ï¿½When I got there it was quite dark. I found my husbandï¿½s flint and steel
and struck a spark. I saw him lying there. He was dead.ï¿½

ï¿½And the dogs?ï¿½

ï¿½The dogs were gone.ï¿½

ï¿½Gone—where to?ï¿½

ï¿½I donï¿½t know. There was no way out—and there were no dogs at
Kerfol.ï¿½

She straightened herself to her full height, threw her arms above her
head, and fell down on the stone floor with a long scream. There was a
moment of confusion in the court-room. Some one on the bench was heard to
say: ï¿½This is clearly a case for the ecclesiastical authoritiesï¿½—and
the prisonerï¿½s lawyer doubtless jumped at the suggestion.

After this, the trial loses itself in a maze of cross-questioning and
squabbling. Every witness who was called corroborated Anne de Cornaultï¿½s
statement that there were no dogs at Kerfol: had been none for several
months. The master of the house had taken a dislike to dogs, there was no
denying it. But, on the other hand, at the inquest, there had been long
and bitter discussion as to the nature of the dead manï¿½s wounds. One of
the surgeons called in had spoken of marks that looked like bites. The
suggestion of witchcraft was revived, and the opposing lawyers hurled
tomes of necromancy at each other.

At last Anne de Cornault was brought back into court—at the instance
of the same Judge—and asked if she knew where the dogs she spoke of
could have come from. On the body of her Redeemer she swore that she did
not. Then the Judge put his final question: ï¿½If the dogs you think you
heard had been known to you, do you think you would have recognized them
by their barking?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes.ï¿½

ï¿½Did you recognize them?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes.ï¿½

ï¿½What dogs do you take them to have been?ï¿½

ï¿½My dead dogs,ï¿½ she said in a whisper... She was taken out of court, not
to reappear there again. There was some kind of ecclesiastical
investigation, and the end of the business was that the Judges disagreed
with each other, and with the ecclesiastical committee, and that Anne de
Cornault was finally handed over to the keeping of her husbandï¿½s family,
who shut her up in the keep of Kerfol, where she is said to have died many
years later, a harmless madwoman.

So ends her story. As for that of Hervï¿½ de Lanrivain, I had only to apply
to his collateral descendant for its subsequent details. The evidence
against the young man being insufficient, and his family influence in the
duchy considerable, he was set free, and left soon afterward for Paris. He
was probably in no mood for a worldly life, and he appears to have come
almost immediately under the influence of the famous M. Arnauld dï¿½Andilly
and the gentlemen of Port Royal. A year or two later he was received into
their Order, and without achieving any particular distinction he followed
its good and evil fortunes till his death some twenty years later.
Lanrivain showed me a portrait of him by a pupil of Philippe de
Champaigne: sad eyes, an impulsive mouth and a narrow brow. Poor Hervï¿½ de
Lanrivain: it was a grey ending. Yet as I looked at his stiff and sallow
effigy, in the dark dress of the Jansenists, I almost found myself envying
his fate. After all, in the course of his life two great things had
happened to him: he had loved romantically, and he must have talked with
Pascal...

The End

MRS. MANSTEYï¿½S VIEW

As first published in Scribnerï¿½s Magazine, July, 1891

The view from Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s window was not a striking one, but to her at
least it was full of interest and beauty. Mrs. Manstey occupied the back
room on the third floor of a New York boarding-house, in a street where
the ash-barrels lingered late on the sidewalk and the gaps in the pavement
would have staggered a Quintus Curtius. She was the widow of a clerk in a
large wholesale house, and his death had left her alone, for her only
daughter had married in California, and could not afford the long journey
to New York to see her mother. Mrs. Manstey, perhaps, might have joined
her daughter in the West, but they had now been so many years apart that
they had ceased to feel any need of each otherï¿½s society, and their
intercourse had long been limited to the exchange of a few perfunctory
letters, written with indifference by the daughter, and with difficulty by
Mrs. Manstey, whose right hand was growing stiff with gout. Even had she
felt a stronger desire for her daughterï¿½s companionship, Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s
increasing infirmity, which caused her to dread the three flights of
stairs between her room and the street, would have given her pause on the
eve of undertaking so long a journey; and without perhaps, formulating
these reasons she had long since accepted as a matter of course her
solitary life in New York.

She was, indeed, not quite lonely, for a few friends still toiled up now
and then to her room; but their visits grew rare as the years went by.
Mrs. Manstey had never been a sociable woman, and during her husbandï¿½s
lifetime his companionship had been all-sufficient to her. For many years
she had cherished a desire to live in the country, to have a hen-house and
a garden; but this longing had faded with age, leaving only in the breast
of the uncommunicative old woman a vague tenderness for plants and
animals. It was, perhaps, this tenderness which made her cling so
fervently to her view from her window, a view in which the most optimistic
eye would at first have failed to discover anything admirable.

Mrs. Manstey, from her coign of vantage (a slightly projecting bow-window
where she nursed an ivy and a succession of unwholesome-looking bulbs),
looked out first upon the yard of her own dwelling, of which, however, she
could get but a restricted glimpse. Still, her gaze took in the topmost
boughs of the ailanthus below her window, and she knew how early each year
the clump of dicentra strung its bending stalk with hearts of pink.

But of greater interest were the yards beyond. Being for the most part
attached to boarding-houses they were in a state of chronic untidiness and
fluttering, on certain days of the week, with miscellaneous garments and
frayed table-cloths. In spite of this Mrs. Manstey found much to admire in
the long vista which she commanded. Some of the yards were, indeed, but
stony wastes, with grass in the cracks of the pavement and no shade in
spring save that afforded by the intermittent leafage of the
clothes-lines. These yards Mrs. Manstey disapproved of, but the others,
the green ones, she loved. She had grown used to their disorder; the
broken barrels, the empty bottles and paths unswept no longer annoyed her;
hers was the happy faculty of dwelling on the pleasanter side of the
prospect before her.

In the very next enclosure did not a magnolia open its hard white flowers
against the watery blue of April? And was there not, a little way down the
line, a fence foamed over every May be lilac waves of wistaria? Farther
still, a horse-chestnut lifted its candelabra of buff and pink blossoms
above broad fans of foliage; while in the opposite yard June was sweet
with the breath of a neglected syringa, which persisted in growing in
spite of the countless obstacles opposed to its welfare.

But if nature occupied the front rank in Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s view, there was
much of a more personal character to interest her in the aspect of the
houses and their inmates. She deeply disapproved of the mustard-colored
curtains which had lately been hung in the doctorï¿½s window opposite; but
she glowed with pleasure when the house farther down had its old bricks
washed with a coat of paint. The occupants of the houses did not often
show themselves at the back windows, but the servants were always in
sight. Noisy slatterns, Mrs. Manstey pronounced the greater number; she
knew their ways and hated them. But to the quiet cook in the newly painted
house, whose mistress bullied her, and who secretly fed the stray cats at
nightfall, Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s warmest sympathies were given. On one occasion
her feelings were racked by the neglect of a housemaid, who for two days
forgot to feed the parrot committed to her care. On the third day, Mrs.
Manstey, in spite of her gouty hand, had just penned a letter, beginning:
ï¿½Madam, it is now three days since your parrot has been fed,ï¿½ when the
forgetful maid appeared at the window with a cup of seed in her hand.

But in Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s more meditative moods it was the narrowing
perspective of far-off yards which pleased her best. She loved, at
twilight, when the distant brown-stone spire seemed melting in the fluid
yellow of the west, to lose herself in vague memories of a trip to Europe,
made years ago, and now reduced in her mindï¿½s eye to a pale phantasmagoria
of indistinct steeples and dreamy skies. Perhaps at heart Mrs. Manstey was
an artist; at all events she was sensible of many changes of color
unnoticed by the average eye, and dear to her as the green of early spring
was the black lattice of branches against a cold sulphur sky at the close
of a snowy day. She enjoyed, also, the sunny thaws of March, when patches
of earth showed through the snow, like ink-spots spreading on a sheet of
white blotting-paper; and, better still, the haze of boughs, leafless but
swollen, which replaced the clear-cut tracery of winter. She even watched
with a certain interest the trail of smoke from a far-off factory chimney,
and missed a detail in the landscape when the factory was closed and the
smoke disappeared.

Mrs. Manstey, in the long hours which she spent at her window, was not
idle. She read a little, and knitted numberless stockings; but the view
surrounded and shaped her life as the sea does a lonely island. When her
rare callers came it was difficult for her to detach herself from the
contemplation of the opposite window-washing, or the scrutiny of certain
green points in a neighboring flower-bed which might, or might not, turn
into hyacinths, while she feigned an interest in her visitorï¿½s anecdotes
about some unknown grandchild. Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s real friends were the
denizens of the yards, the hyacinths, the magnolia, the green parrot, the
maid who fed the cats, the doctor who studied late behind his
mustard-colored curtains; and the confidant of her tenderer musings was
the church-spire floating in the sunset.

One April day, as she sat in her usual place, with knitting cast aside and
eyes fixed on the blue sky mottled with round clouds, a knock at the door
announced the entrance of her landlady. Mrs. Manstey did not care for her
landlady, but she submitted to her visits with ladylike resignation.
To-day, however, it seemed harder than usual to turn from the blue sky and
the blossoming magnolia to Mrs. Sampsonï¿½s unsuggestive face, and Mrs.
Manstey was conscious of a distinct effort as she did so.

ï¿½The magnolia is out earlier than usual this year, Mrs. Sampson,ï¿½ she
remarked, yielding to a rare impulse, for she seldom alluded to the
absorbing interest of her life. In the first place it was a topic not
likely to appeal to her visitors and, besides, she lacked the power of
expression and could not have given utterance to her feelings had she
wished to.

ï¿½The what, Mrs. Manstey?ï¿½ inquired the landlady, glancing about the room
as if to find there the explanation of Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s statement.

ï¿½The magnolia in the next yard—in Mrs. Blackï¿½s yard,ï¿½ Mrs. Manstey
repeated.

ï¿½Is it, indeed? I didnï¿½t know there was a magnolia there,ï¿½ said Mrs.
Sampson, carelessly. Mrs. Manstey looked at her; she did not know that
there was a magnolia in the next yard!

ï¿½By the way,ï¿½ Mrs. Sampson continued, ï¿½speaking of Mrs. Black reminds me
that the work on the extension is to begin next week.ï¿½

ï¿½The what?ï¿½ it was Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s turn to ask.

ï¿½The extension,ï¿½ said Mrs. Sampson, nodding her head in the direction of
the ignored magnolia. ï¿½You knew, of course, that Mrs. Black was going to
build an extension to her house? Yes, maï¿½am. I hear it is to run right
back to the end of the yard. How she can afford to build an extension in
these hard times I donï¿½t see; but she always was crazy about building. She
used to keep a boarding-house in Seventeenth Street, and she nearly ruined
herself then by sticking out bow-windows and what not; I should have
thought that would have cured her of building, but I guess itï¿½s a disease,
like drink. Anyhow, the work is to begin on Monday.ï¿½

Mrs. Manstey had grown pale. She always spoke slowly, so the landlady did
not heed the long pause which followed. At last Mrs. Manstey said: ï¿½Do you
know how high the extension will be?ï¿½

ï¿½Thatï¿½s the most absurd part of it. The extension is to be built right up
to the roof of the main building; now, did you ever?ï¿½

Mrs. Manstey paused again. ï¿½Wonï¿½t it be a great annoyance to you, Mrs.
Sampson?ï¿½ she asked.

ï¿½I should say it would. But thereï¿½s no help for it; if people have got a
mind to build extensions thereï¿½s no law to prevent ï¿½em, that Iï¿½m aware
of.ï¿½ Mrs. Manstey, knowing this, was silent. ï¿½There is no help for it,ï¿½
Mrs. Sampson repeated, ï¿½but if I
am
a church member, I wouldnï¿½t be so
sorry if it ruined Eliza Black. Well, good-day, Mrs. Manstey; Iï¿½m glad to
find you so comfortable.ï¿½

So comfortable—so comfortable! Left to herself the old woman turned
once more to the window. How lovely the view was that day! The blue sky
with its round clouds shed a brightness over everything; the ailanthus had
put on a tinge of yellow-green, the hyacinths were budding, the magnolia
flowers looked more than ever like rosettes carved in alabaster. Soon the
wistaria would bloom, then the horse-chestnut; but not for her. Between
her eyes and them a barrier of brick and mortar would swiftly rise;
presently even the spire would disappear, and all her radiant world be
blotted out. Mrs. Manstey sent away untouched the dinner-tray brought to
her that evening. She lingered in the window until the windy sunset died
in bat-colored dusk; then, going to bed, she lay sleepless all night.

Early the next day she was up and at the window. It was raining, but even
through the slanting gray gauze the scene had its charm—and then the
rain was so good for the trees. She had noticed the day before that the
ailanthus was growing dusty.

ï¿½Of course I might move,ï¿½ said Mrs. Manstey aloud, and turning from the
window she looked about her room. She might move, of course; so might she
be flayed alive; but she was not likely to survive either operation. The
room, though far less important to her happiness than the view, was as
much a part of her existence. She had lived in it seventeen years. She
knew every stain on the wall-paper, every rent in the carpet; the light
fell in a certain way on her engravings, her books had grown shabby on
their shelves, her bulbs and ivy were used to their window and knew which
way to lean to the sun. ï¿½We are all too old to move,ï¿½ she said.

That afternoon it cleared. Wet and radiant the blue reappeared through
torn rags of cloud; the ailanthus sparkled; the earth in the
flower-borders looked rich and warm. It was Thursday, and on Monday the
building of the extension was to begin.

On Sunday afternoon a card was brought to Mrs. Black, as she was engaged
in gathering up the fragments of the boardersï¿½ dinner in the basement. The
card, black-edged, bore Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s name.

ï¿½One of Mrs. Sampsonï¿½s boarders; wants to move, I suppose. Well, I can
give her a room next year in the extension. Dinah,ï¿½ said Mrs. Black, ï¿½tell
the lady Iï¿½ll be upstairs in a minute.ï¿½

Mrs. Black found Mrs. Manstey standing in the long parlor garnished with
statuettes and antimacassars; in that house she could not sit down.

Stooping hurriedly to open the register, which let out a cloud of dust,
Mrs. Black advanced on her visitor.

ï¿½Iï¿½m happy to meet you, Mrs. Manstey; take a seat, please,ï¿½ the landlady
remarked in her prosperous voice, the voice of a woman who can afford to
build extensions. There was no help for it; Mrs. Manstey sat down.

ï¿½Is there anything I can do for you, maï¿½am?ï¿½ Mrs. Black continued. ï¿½My
house is full at present, but I am going to build an extension, and—ï¿½

ï¿½It is about the extension that I wish to speak,ï¿½ said Mrs. Manstey,
suddenly. ï¿½I am a poor woman, Mrs. Black, and I have never been a happy
one. I shall have to talk about myself first to—to make you
understand.ï¿½

Mrs. Black, astonished but imperturbable, bowed at this parenthesis.

ï¿½I never had what I wanted,ï¿½ Mrs. Manstey continued. ï¿½It was always one
disappointment after another. For years I wanted to live in the country. I
dreamed and dreamed about it; but we never could manage it. There was no
sunny window in our house, and so all my plants died. My daughter married
years ago and went away—besides, she never cared for the same
things. Then my husband died and I was left alone. That was seventeen
years ago. I went to live at Mrs. Sampsonï¿½s, and I have been there ever
since. I have grown a little infirm, as you see, and I donï¿½t get out
often; only on fine days, if I am feeling very well. So you can understand
my sitting a great deal in my window—the back window on the third
floor—ï¿½

ï¿½Well, Mrs. Manstey,ï¿½ said Mrs. Black, liberally, ï¿½I could give you a back
room, I dare say; one of the new rooms in the ex—ï¿½

ï¿½But I donï¿½t want to move; I canï¿½t move,ï¿½ said Mrs. Manstey, almost with a
scream. ï¿½And I came to tell you that if you build that extension I shall
have no view from my window—no view! Do you understand?ï¿½

Mrs. Black thought herself face to face with a lunatic, and she had always
heard that lunatics must be humored.

ï¿½Dear me, dear me,ï¿½ she remarked, pushing her chair back a little way,
ï¿½that is too bad, isnï¿½t it? Why, I never thought of that. To be sure, the
extension
will
interfere with your view, Mrs. Manstey.ï¿½

ï¿½You do understand?ï¿½ Mrs. Manstey gasped.

ï¿½Of course I do. And Iï¿½m real sorry about it, too. But there, donï¿½t you
worry, Mrs. Manstey. I guess we can fix that all right.ï¿½

Mrs. Manstey rose from her seat, and Mrs. Black slipped toward the door.

ï¿½What do you mean by fixing it? Do you mean that I can induce you to
change your mind about the extension? Oh, Mrs. Black, listen to me. I have
two thousand dollars in the bank and I could manage, I know I could
manage, to give you a thousand if—ï¿½ Mrs. Manstey paused; the tears
were rolling down her cheeks.

ï¿½There, there, Mrs. Manstey, donï¿½t you worry,ï¿½ repeated Mrs. Black,
soothingly. ï¿½I am sure we can settle it. I am sorry that I canï¿½t stay and
talk about it any longer, but this is such a busy time of day, with supper
to get—ï¿½

Her hand was on the door-knob, but with sudden vigor Mrs. Manstey seized
her wrist.

ï¿½You are not giving me a definite answer. Do you mean to say that you
accept my proposition?ï¿½

ï¿½Why, Iï¿½ll think it over, Mrs. Manstey, certainly I will. I wouldnï¿½t annoy
you for the world—ï¿½

ï¿½But the work is to begin to-morrow, I am told,ï¿½ Mrs. Manstey persisted.

Mrs. Black hesitated. ï¿½It shanï¿½t begin, I promise you that; Iï¿½ll send word
to the builder this very night.ï¿½ Mrs. Manstey tightened her hold.

ï¿½You are not deceiving me, are you?ï¿½ she said.

ï¿½No—no,ï¿½ stammered Mrs. Black. ï¿½How can you think such a thing of
me, Mrs. Manstey?ï¿½

Slowly Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s clutch relaxed, and she passed through the open
door. ï¿½One thousand dollars,ï¿½ she repeated, pausing in the hall; then she
let herself out of the house and hobbled down the steps, supporting
herself on the cast-iron railing.

ï¿½My goodness,ï¿½ exclaimed Mrs. Black, shutting and bolting the hall-door,
ï¿½I never knew the old woman was crazy! And she looks so quiet and
ladylike, too.ï¿½

Mrs. Manstey slept well that night, but early the next morning she was
awakened by a sound of hammering. She got to her window with what haste
she might and, looking out saw that Mrs. Blackï¿½s yard was full of workmen.
Some were carrying loads of brick from the kitchen to the yard, others
beginning to demolish the old-fashioned wooden balcony which adorned each
story of Mrs. Blackï¿½s house. Mrs. Manstey saw that she had been deceived.
At first she thought of confiding her trouble to Mrs. Sampson, but a
settled discouragement soon took possession of her and she went back to
bed, not caring to see what was going on.

Toward afternoon, however, feeling that she must know the worst, she rose
and dressed herself. It was a laborious task, for her hands were stiffer
than usual, and the hooks and buttons seemed to evade her.

When she seated herself in the window, she saw that the workmen had
removed the upper part of the balcony, and that the bricks had multiplied
since morning. One of the men, a coarse fellow with a bloated face, picked
a magnolia blossom and, after smelling it, threw it to the ground; the
next man, carrying a load of bricks, trod on the flower in passing.

ï¿½Look out, Jim,ï¿½ called one of the men to another who was smoking a pipe,
ï¿½if you throw matches around near those barrels of paper youï¿½ll have the
old tinder-box burning down before you know it.ï¿½ And Mrs. Manstey, leaning
forward, perceived that there were several barrels of paper and rubbish
under the wooden balcony.

At length the work ceased and twilight fell. The sunset was perfect and a
roseate light, transfiguring the distant spire, lingered late in the west.
When it grew dark Mrs. Manstey drew down the shades and proceeded, in her
usual methodical manner, to light her lamp. She always filled and lit it
with her own hands, keeping a kettle of kerosene on a zinc-covered shelf
in a closet. As the lamp-light filled the room it assumed its usual
peaceful aspect. The books and pictures and plants seemed, like their
mistress, to settle themselves down for another quiet evening, and Mrs.
Manstey, as was her wont, drew up her armchair to the table and began to
knit.

That night she could not sleep. The weather had changed and a wild wind
was abroad, blotting the stars with close-driven clouds. Mrs. Manstey rose
once or twice and looked out of the window; but of the view nothing was
discernible save a tardy light or two in the opposite windows. These
lights at last went out, and Mrs. Manstey, who had watched for their
extinction, began to dress herself. She was in evident haste, for she
merely flung a thin dressing-gown over her night-dress and wrapped her
head in a scarf; then she opened her closet and cautiously took out the
kettle of kerosene. Having slipped a bundle of wooden matches into her
pocket she proceeded, with increasing precautions, to unlock her door, and
a few moments later she was feeling her way down the dark staircase, led
by a glimmer of gas from the lower hall. At length she reached the bottom
of the stairs and began the more difficult descent into the utter darkness
of the basement. Here, however, she could move more freely, as there was
less danger of being overheard; and without much delay she contrived to
unlock the iron door leading into the yard. A gust of cold wind smote her
as she stepped out and groped shiveringly under the clothes-lines.

That morning at three oï¿½clock an alarm of fire brought the engines to Mrs.
Blackï¿½s door, and also brought Mrs. Sampsonï¿½s startled boarders to their
windows. The wooden balcony at the back of Mrs. Blackï¿½s house was ablaze,
and among those who watched the progress of the flames was Mrs. Manstey,
leaning in her thin dressing-gown from the open window.

The fire, however, was soon put out, and the frightened occupants of the
house, who had fled in scant attire, reassembled at dawn to find that
little mischief had been done beyond the cracking of window panes and
smoking of ceilings. In fact, the chief sufferer by the fire was Mrs.
Manstey, who was found in the morning gasping with pneumonia, a not
unnatural result, as everyone remarked, of her having hung out of an open
window at her age in a dressing-gown. It was easy to see that she was very
ill, but no one had guessed how grave the doctorï¿½s verdict would be, and
the faces gathered that evening about Mrs. Sampsonï¿½s table were awestruck
and disturbed. Not that any of the boarders knew Mrs. Manstey well; she
ï¿½kept to herself,ï¿½ as they said, and seemed to fancy herself too good for
them; but then it is always disagreeable to have anyone dying in the house
and, as one lady observed to another: ï¿½It might just as well have been you
or me, my dear.ï¿½

But it was only Mrs. Manstey; and she was dying, as she had lived, lonely
if not alone. The doctor had sent a trained nurse, and Mrs. Sampson, with
muffled step, came in from time to time; but both, to Mrs. Manstey, seemed
remote and unsubstantial as the figures in a dream. All day she said
nothing; but when she was asked for her daughterï¿½s address she shook her
head. At times the nurse noticed that she seemed to be listening
attentively for some sound which did not come; then again she dozed.

The next morning at daylight she was very low. The nurse called Mrs.
Sampson and as the two bent over the old woman they saw her lips move.

ï¿½Lift me up—out of bed,ï¿½ she whispered.

They raised her in their arms, and with her stiff hand she pointed to the
window.

ï¿½Oh, the window—she wants to sit in the window. She used to sit
there all day,ï¿½ Mrs. Sampson explained. ï¿½It can do her no harm, I
suppose?ï¿½

ï¿½Nothing matters now,ï¿½ said the nurse.

They carried Mrs. Manstey to the window and placed her in her chair. The
dawn was abroad, a jubilant spring dawn; the spire had already caught a
golden ray, though the magnolia and horse-chestnut still slumbered in
shadow. In Mrs. Blackï¿½s yard all was quiet. The charred timbers of the
balcony lay where they had fallen. It was evident that since the fire the
builders had not returned to their work. The magnolia had unfolded a few
more sculptural flowers; the view was undisturbed.

It was hard for Mrs. Manstey to breathe; each moment it grew more
difficult. She tried to make them open the window, but they would not
understand. If she could have tasted the air, sweet with the penetrating
ailanthus savor, it would have eased her; but the view at least was there—the
spire was golden now, the heavens had warmed from pearl to blue, day was
alight from east to west, even the magnolia had caught the sun.

Mrs. Mansteyï¿½s head fell back and smiling she died.

That day the building of the extension was resumed.

The End

THE BOLTED DOOR

As first published in Scribnerï¿½s Magazine, March 1909

I

Hubert Granice, pacing the length of his pleasant lamp-lit library, paused
to compare his watch with the clock on the chimney-piece.

Three minutes to eight.

In exactly three minutes Mr. Peter Ascham, of the eminent legal firm of
Ascham and Pettilow, would have his punctual hand on the door-bell of the
flat. It was a comfort to reflect that Ascham was so punctual—the
suspense was beginning to make his host nervous. And the sound of the
door-bell would be the beginning of the end—after that thereï¿½d be no
going back, by God—no going back!

Granice resumed his pacing. Each time he reached the end of the room
opposite the door he caught his reflection in the Florentine mirror above
the fine old walnut credence he had picked up at Dijon—saw himself
spare, quick-moving, carefully brushed and dressed, but furrowed, gray
about the temples, with a stoop which he corrected by a spasmodic
straightening of the shoulders whenever a glass confronted him: a tired
middle-aged man, baffled, beaten, worn out.

As he summed himself up thus for the third or fourth time the door opened
and he turned with a thrill of relief to greet his guest. But it was only
the man-servant who entered, advancing silently over the mossy surface of
the old Turkey rug.

ï¿½Mr. Ascham telephones, sir, to say heï¿½s unexpectedly detained and canï¿½t
be here till eight-thirty.ï¿½

Granice made a curt gesture of annoyance. It was becoming harder and
harder for him to control these reflexes. He turned on his heel, tossing
to the servant over his shoulder: ï¿½Very good. Put off dinner.ï¿½

Down his spine he felt the manï¿½s injured stare. Mr. Granice had always
been so mild-spoken to his people—no doubt the odd change in his
manner had already been noticed and discussed below stairs. And very
likely they suspected the cause. He stood drumming on the writing-table
till he heard the servant go out; then he threw himself into a chair,
propping his elbows on the table and resting his chin on his locked hands.

Another half hour alone with it!

He wondered irritably what could have detained his guest. Some
professional matter, no doubt—the punctilious lawyer would have
allowed nothing less to interfere with a dinner engagement, more
especially since Granice, in his note, had said: ï¿½I shall want a little
business chat afterward.ï¿½

But what professional matter could have come up at that unprofessional
hour? Perhaps some other soul in misery had called on the lawyer; and,
after all, Graniceï¿½s note had given no hint of his own need! No doubt
Ascham thought he merely wanted to make another change in his will. Since
he had come into his little property, ten years earlier, Granice had been
perpetually tinkering with his will.

Suddenly another thought pulled him up, sending a flush to his sallow
temples. He remembered a word he had tossed to the lawyer some six weeks
earlier, at the Century Club. ï¿½Yes—my playï¿½s as good as taken. I
shall be calling on you soon to go over the contract. Those theatrical
chaps are so slippery—I wonï¿½t trust anybody but you to tie the knot
for me!ï¿½ That, of course, was what Ascham would think he was wanted for.
Granice, at the idea, broke into an audible laugh—a queer
stage-laugh, like the cackle of a baffled villain in a melodrama. The
absurdity, the unnaturalness of the sound abashed him, and he compressed
his lips angrily. Would he take to soliloquy next?

He lowered his arms and pulled open the upper drawer of the writing-table.
In the right-hand corner lay a thick manuscript, bound in paper folders,
and tied with a string beneath which a letter had been slipped. Next to
the manuscript was a small revolver. Granice stared a moment at these
oddly associated objects; then he took the letter from under the string
and slowly began to open it. He had known he should do so from the moment
his hand touched the drawer. Whenever his eye fell on that letter some
relentless force compelled him to re-read it.

It was dated about four weeks back, under the letter-head of ï¿½The
Diversity Theatre.ï¿½

ï¿½
My Dear Mr. Granice
:

ï¿½I have given the matter my best consideration for the last month, and
itï¿½s no use—the play wonï¿½t do. I have talked it over with Miss
Melrose—and you know there isnï¿½t a gamer artist on our stage—and
I regret to tell you she feels just as I do about it. It isnï¿½t the poetry
that scares her—or me either. We both want to do all we can to help
along the poetic drama—we believe the publicï¿½s ready for it, and
weï¿½re willing to take a big financial risk in order to be the first to
give them what they want.
But we donï¿½t believe they could be made to want
this.
The fact is, there isnï¿½t enough drama in your play to the allowance
of poetry—the thing drags all through. Youï¿½ve got a big idea, but
itï¿½s not out of swaddling clothes.

ï¿½If this was your first play Iï¿½d say:
Try again
. But it has been just the
same with all the others youï¿½ve shown me. And you remember the result of
ï¿½The Lee Shore,ï¿½ where you carried all the expenses of production
yourself, and we couldnï¿½t fill the theatre for a week. Yet ï¿½The Lee Shoreï¿½
was a modern problem play—much easier to swing than blank verse. It
isnï¿½t as if you hadnï¿½t tried all kinds—ï¿½

Granice folded the letter and put it carefully back into the envelope. Why
on earth was he re-reading it, when he knew every phrase in it by heart,
when for a month past he had seen it, night after night, stand out in
letters of flame against the darkness of his sleepless lids?

ï¿½
It has been just the same with all the others youï¿½ve shown me.
ï¿½

That was the way they dismissed ten years of passionate unremitting work!

ï¿½
You remember the result of ï¿½The Lee Shore.
ï¿½ï¿½

Good God—as if he were likely to forget it! He re-lived it all now
in a drowning flash: the persistent rejection of the play, his sudden
resolve to put it on at his own cost, to spend ten thousand dollars of his
inheritance on testing his chance of success—the fever of
preparation, the dry-mouthed agony of the ï¿½first night,ï¿½ the flat fall,
the stupid press, his secret rush to Europe to escape the condolence of
his friends!

ï¿½
It isnï¿½t as if you hadnï¿½t tried all kinds
.ï¿½

No—he had tried all kinds: comedy, tragedy, prose and verse, the
light curtain-raiser, the short sharp drama, the bourgeois-realistic and
the lyrical-romantic—finally deciding that he would no longer
ï¿½prostitute his talentï¿½ to win popularity, but would impose on the public
his own theory of art in the form of five acts of blank verse. Yes, he had
offered them everything—and always with the same result.

Ten years of it—ten years of dogged work and unrelieved failure. The
ten years from forty to fifty—the best ten years of his life! And if
one counted the years before, the silent years of dreams, assimilation,
preparation—then call it half a manï¿½s life-time: half a manï¿½s
life-time thrown away!

And what was he to do with the remaining half? Well, he had settled that,
thank God! He turned and glanced anxiously at the clock. Ten minutes past
eight—only ten minutes had been consumed in that stormy rush through
his whole past! And he must wait another twenty minutes for Ascham. It was
one of the worst symptoms of his case that, in proportion as he had grown
to shrink from human company, he dreaded more and more to be alone.... But
why the devil was he waiting for Ascham? Why didnï¿½t he cut the knot
himself? Since he was so unutterably sick of the whole business, why did
he have to call in an outsider to rid him of this nightmare of living?

He opened the drawer again and laid his hand on the revolver. It was a
small slim ivory toy—just the instrument for a tired sufferer to
give himself a ï¿½hypodermicï¿½ with. Granice raised it slowly in one hand,
while with the other he felt under the thin hair at the back of his head,
between the ear and the nape. He knew just where to place the muzzle: he
had once got a young surgeon to show him. And as he found the spot, and
lifted the revolver to it, the inevitable phenomenon occurred. The hand
that held the weapon began to shake, the tremor communicated itself to his
arm, his heart gave a wild leap which sent up a wave of deadly nausea to
his throat, he smelt the powder, he sickened at the crash of the bullet
through his skull, and a sweat of fear broke out over his forehead and ran
down his quivering face...

He laid away the revolver with an oath and, pulling out a cologne-scented
handkerchief, passed it tremulously over his brow and temples. It was no
use—he knew he could never do it in that way. His attempts at
self-destruction were as futile as his snatches at fame! He couldnï¿½t make
himself a real life, and he couldnï¿½t get rid of the life he had. And that
was why he had sent for Ascham to help him...

The lawyer, over the Camembert and Burgundy, began to excuse himself for
his delay.

ï¿½I didnï¿½t like to say anything while your man was about—but the fact
is, I was sent for on a rather unusual matter—ï¿½

ï¿½Oh, itï¿½s all right,ï¿½ said Granice cheerfully. He was beginning to feel
the usual reaction that food and company produced. It was not any
recovered pleasure in life that he felt, but only a deeper withdrawal into
himself. It was easier to go on automatically with the social gestures
than to uncover to any human eye the abyss within him.

ï¿½My dear fellow, itï¿½s sacrilege to keep a dinner waiting—especially
the production of an artist like yours.ï¿½ Mr. Ascham sipped his Burgundy
luxuriously. ï¿½But the fact is, Mrs. Ashgrove sent for me.ï¿½

Granice raised his head with a quick movement of surprise. For a moment he
was shaken out of his self-absorption.

ï¿½MRS. ASHGROVE?ï¿½

Ascham smiled. ï¿½I thought youï¿½d be interested; I know your passion for
causes celebres. And this promises to be one. Of course itï¿½s out of our
line entirely—we never touch criminal cases. But she wanted to
consult me as a friend. Ashgrove was a distant connection of my wifeï¿½s.
And, by Jove, it
is
a queer case!ï¿½ The servant re-entered, and Ascham
snapped his lips shut.

Would the gentlemen have their coffee in the dining-room?

ï¿½No—serve it in the library,ï¿½ said Granice, rising. He led the way
back to the curtained confidential room. He was really curious to hear
what Ascham had to tell him.

While the coffee and cigars were being served he fidgeted about the
library, glancing at his letters—the usual meaningless notes and
bills—and picking up the evening paper. As he unfolded it a headline
caught his eye.

ï¿½ROSE MELROSE WANTS TO PLAY POETRY.

ï¿½THINKS SHE HAS FOUND HER POET.ï¿½

He read on with a thumping heart—found the name of a young author he
had barely heard of, saw the title of a play, a ï¿½poetic drama,ï¿½ dance
before his eyes, and dropped the paper, sick, disgusted. It was true, then—she

was
ï¿½gameï¿½—it was not the manner but the matter she mistrusted!

Granice turned to the servant, who seemed to be purposely lingering. ï¿½I
shanï¿½t need you this evening, Flint. Iï¿½ll lock up myself.ï¿½

He fancied the manï¿½s acquiescence implied surprise. What was going on,
Flint seemed to wonder, that Mr. Granice should want him out of the way?
Probably he would find a pretext for coming back to see. Granice suddenly
felt himself enveloped in a network of espionage.

As the door closed he threw himself into an armchair and leaned forward to
take a light from Aschamï¿½s cigar.

ï¿½Tell me about Mrs. Ashgrove,ï¿½ he said, seeming to himself to speak
stiffly, as if his lips were cracked.

ï¿½Mrs. Ashgrove? Well, thereï¿½s not much to
tell
.ï¿½

ï¿½And you couldnï¿½t if there were?ï¿½ Granice smiled.

ï¿½Probably not. As a matter of fact, she wanted my advice about her choice
of counsel. There was nothing especially confidential in our talk.ï¿½

ï¿½And whatï¿½s your impression, now youï¿½ve seen her?ï¿½

ï¿½My impression is, very distinctly,
That nothing will ever be known
.ï¿½

ï¿½Ah—?ï¿½ Granice murmured, puffing at his cigar.

ï¿½Iï¿½m more and more convinced that whoever poisoned Ashgrove knew his
business, and will consequently never be found out. Thatï¿½s a capital cigar
youï¿½ve given me.ï¿½

ï¿½You like it? I get them over from Cuba.ï¿½ Granice examined his own
reflectively. ï¿½Then you believe in the theory that the clever criminals
never
are
caught?ï¿½

ï¿½Of course I do. Look about you—look back for the last dozen years—none
of the big murder problems are ever solved.ï¿½ The lawyer ruminated behind
his blue cloud. ï¿½Why, take the instance in your own family: Iï¿½d forgotten
I had an illustration at hand! Take old Joseph Lenmanï¿½s murder—do
you suppose that will ever be explained?ï¿½

As the words dropped from Aschamï¿½s lips his host looked slowly about the
library, and every object in it stared back at him with a stale
unescapable familiarity. How sick he was of looking at that room! It was
as dull as the face of a wife one has wearied of. He cleared his throat
slowly; then he turned his head to the lawyer and said: ï¿½I could explain
the Lenman murder myself.ï¿½

Aschamï¿½s eye kindled: he shared Graniceï¿½s interest in criminal cases.

ï¿½By Jove! Youï¿½ve had a theory all this time? Itï¿½s odd you never mentioned
it. Go ahead and tell me. There are certain features in the Lenman case
not unlike this Ashgrove affair, and your idea may be a help.ï¿½

Granice paused and his eye reverted instinctively to the table drawer in
which the revolver and the manuscript lay side by side. What if he were to
try another appeal to Rose Melrose? Then he looked at the notes and bills
on the table, and the horror of taking up again the lifeless routine of
life—of performing the same automatic gestures another day—displaced
his fleeting vision.

ï¿½I havenï¿½t a theory. I
know
who murdered Joseph Lenman.ï¿½

Ascham settled himself comfortably in his chair, prepared for enjoyment.

ï¿½You
know
? Well, who did?ï¿½ he laughed.

ï¿½I did,ï¿½ said Granice, rising.

He stood before Ascham, and the lawyer lay back staring up at him. Then he
broke into another laugh.

ï¿½Why, this is glorious! You murdered him, did you? To inherit his money, I
suppose? Better and better! Go on, my boy! Unbosom yourself! Tell me all
about it! Confession is good for the soul.ï¿½

Granice waited till the lawyer had shaken the last peal of laughter from
his throat; then he repeated doggedly: ï¿½I murdered him.ï¿½

The two men looked at each other for a long moment, and this time Ascham
did not laugh.

ï¿½Granice!ï¿½

ï¿½I murdered him—to get his money, as you say.ï¿½

There was another pause, and Granice, with a vague underlying sense of
amusement, saw his guestï¿½s look change from pleasantry to apprehension.

ï¿½Whatï¿½s the joke, my dear fellow? I fail to see.ï¿½

ï¿½Itï¿½s not a joke. Itï¿½s the truth. I murdered him.ï¿½ He had spoken painfully
at first, as if there were a knot in his throat; but each time he repeated
the words he found they were easier to say.

Ascham laid down his extinct cigar.

ï¿½Whatï¿½s the matter? Arenï¿½t you well? What on earth are you driving at?ï¿½

ï¿½Iï¿½m perfectly well. But I murdered my cousin, Joseph Lenman, and I want
it known that I murdered him.ï¿½

ï¿½
You want it known
?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes. Thatï¿½s why I sent for you. Iï¿½m sick of living, and when I try to
kill myself I funk it.ï¿½ He spoke quite naturally now, as if the knot in
his throat had been untied.

ï¿½Good Lord—good Lord,ï¿½ the lawyer gasped.

ï¿½But I suppose,ï¿½ Granice continued, ï¿½thereï¿½s no doubt this would be murder
in the first degree? Iï¿½m sure of the chair if I own up?ï¿½

Ascham drew a long breath; then he said slowly: ï¿½Sit down, Granice. Letï¿½s
talk.ï¿½

II

Granice told his story simply, connectedly.

He began by a quick survey of his early years—the years of drudgery
and privation. His father, a charming man who could never say ï¿½no,ï¿½ had so
signally failed to say it on certain essential occasions that when he died
he left an illegitimate family and a mortgaged estate. His lawful kin
found themselves hanging over a gulf of debt, and young Granice, to
support his mother and sister, had to leave Harvard and bury himself at
eighteen in a brokerï¿½s office. He loathed his work, and he was always
poor, always worried and in ill-health. A few years later his mother died,
but his sister, an ineffectual neurasthenic, remained on his hands. His
own health gave out, and he had to go away for six months, and work harder
than ever when he came back. He had no knack for business, no head for
figures, no dimmest insight into the mysteries of commerce. He wanted to
travel and write—those were his inmost longings. And as the years
dragged on, and he neared middle-age without making any more money, or
acquiring any firmer health, a sick despair possessed him. He tried
writing, but he always came home from the office so tired that his brain
could not work. For half the year he did not reach his dim up-town flat
till after dark, and could only ï¿½brush upï¿½ for dinner, and afterward lie
on the lounge with his pipe, while his sister droned through the evening
paper. Sometimes he spent an evening at the theatre; or he dined out, or,
more rarely, strayed off with an acquaintance or two in quest of what is
known as ï¿½pleasure.ï¿½ And in summer, when he and Kate went to the sea-side
for a month, he dozed through the days in utter weariness. Once he fell in
love with a charming girl—but what had he to offer her, in Godï¿½s
name? She seemed to like him, and in common decency he had to drop out of
the running. Apparently no one replaced him, for she never married, but
grew stoutish, grayish, philanthropic—yet how sweet she had been
when he had first kissed her! One more wasted life, he reflected...

But the stage had always been his master-passion. He would have sold his
soul for the time and freedom to write plays! It was
in him
—he could
not remember when it had not been his deepest-seated instinct. As the
years passed it became a morbid, a relentless obsession—yet with
every year the material conditions were more and more against it. He felt
himself growing middle-aged, and he watched the reflection of the process
in his sisterï¿½s wasted face. At eighteen she had been pretty, and as full
of enthusiasm as he. Now she was sour, trivial, insignificant—she
had missed her chance of life. And she had no resources, poor creature,
was fashioned simply for the primitive functions she had been denied the
chance to fulfil! It exasperated him to think of it—and to reflect
that even now a little travel, a little health, a little money, might
transform her, make her young and desirable... The chief fruit of his
experience was that there is no such fixed state as age or youth—there
is only health as against sickness, wealth as against poverty; and age or
youth as the outcome of the lot one draws.

At this point in his narrative Granice stood up, and went to lean against
the mantel-piece, looking down at Ascham, who had not moved from his seat,
or changed his attitude of rigid fascinated attention.

ï¿½Then came the summer when we went to Wrenfield to be near old Lenman—my
motherï¿½s cousin, as you know. Some of the family always mounted guard over
him—generally a niece or so. But that year they were all scattered,
and one of the nieces offered to lend us her cottage if weï¿½d relieve her
of duty for two months. It was a nuisance for me, of course, for Wrenfield
is two hours from town; but my mother, who was a slave to family
observances, had always been good to the old man, so it was natural we
should be called on—and there was the saving of rent and the good
air for Kate. So we went.

ï¿½You never knew Joseph Lenman? Well, picture to yourself an amoeba or some
primitive organism of that sort, under a Titanï¿½s microscope. He was large,
undifferentiated, inert—since I could remember him he had done
nothing but take his temperature and read the Churchman. Oh, and cultivate
melons—that was his hobby. Not vulgar, out-of-door melons—his
were grown under glass. He had miles of it at Wrenfield—his big
kitchen-garden was surrounded by blinking battalions of green-houses. And
in nearly all of them melons were grown—early melons and late,
French, English, domestic—dwarf melons and monsters: every shape,
colour and variety. They were petted and nursed like children—a
staff of trained attendants waited on them. Iï¿½m not sure they didnï¿½t have
a doctor to take their temperature—at any rate the place was full of
thermometers. And they didnï¿½t sprawl on the ground like ordinary melons;
they were trained against the glass like nectarines, and each melon hung
in a net which sustained its weight and left it free on all sides to the
sun and air...

ï¿½It used to strike me sometimes that old Lenman was just like one of his
own melons—the pale-fleshed English kind. His life, apathetic and
motionless, hung in a net of gold, in an equable warm ventilated
atmosphere, high above sordid earthly worries. The cardinal rule of his
existence was not to let himself be ï¿½worried.ï¿½... I remember his advising
me to try it myself, one day when I spoke to him about Kateï¿½s bad health,
and her need of a change. ï¿½I never let myself worry,ï¿½ he said
complacently. ï¿½Itï¿½s the worst thing for the liver—and you look to me
as if you had a liver. Take my advice and be cheerful. Youï¿½ll make
yourself happier and others too.ï¿½ And all he had to do was to write a
cheque, and send the poor girl off for a holiday!

ï¿½The hardest part of it was that the money half-belonged to us already.
The old skin-flint only had it for life, in trust for us and the others.
But his life was a good deal sounder than mine or Kateï¿½s—and one
could picture him taking extra care of it for the joke of keeping us
waiting. I always felt that the sight of our hungry eyes was a tonic to
him.

ï¿½Well, I tried to see if I couldnï¿½t reach him through his vanity. I
flattered him, feigned a passionate interest in his melons. And he was
taken in, and used to discourse on them by the hour. On fine days he was
driven to the green-houses in his pony-chair, and waddled through them,
prodding and leering at the fruit, like a fat Turk in his seraglio. When
he bragged to me of the expense of growing them I was reminded of a
hideous old Lothario bragging of what his pleasures cost. And the
resemblance was completed by the fact that he couldnï¿½t eat as much as a
mouthful of his melons—had lived for years on buttermilk and toast.
ï¿½But, after all, itï¿½s my only hobby—why shouldnï¿½t I indulge it?ï¿½ he
said sentimentally. As if Iï¿½d ever been able to indulge any of mine! On
the keep of those melons Kate and I could have lived like gods...

ï¿½One day toward the end of the summer, when Kate was too unwell to drag
herself up to the big house, she asked me to go and spend the afternoon
with cousin Joseph. It was a lovely soft September afternoon—a day
to lie under a Roman stone-pine, with oneï¿½s eyes on the sky, and let the
cosmic harmonies rush through one. Perhaps the vision was suggested by the
fact that, as I entered cousin Josephï¿½s hideous black walnut library, I
passed one of the under-gardeners, a handsome full-throated Italian, who
dashed out in such a hurry that he nearly knocked me down. I remember
thinking it queer that the fellow, whom I had often seen about the
melon-houses, did not bow to me, or even seem to see me.

ï¿½Cousin Joseph sat in his usual seat, behind the darkened windows, his fat
hands folded on his protuberant waistcoat, the last number of the
Churchman at his elbow, and near it, on a huge dish, a fat melon—the
fattest melon Iï¿½d ever seen. As I looked at it I pictured the ecstasy of
contemplation from which I must have roused him, and congratulated myself
on finding him in such a mood, since I had made up my mind to ask him a
favour. Then I noticed that his face, instead of looking as calm as an
egg-shell, was distorted and whimpering—and without stopping to
greet me he pointed passionately to the melon.

ï¿½ï¿½Look at it, look at it—did you ever see such a beauty? Such
firmness—roundness—such delicious smoothness to the touch?ï¿½ It
was as if he had said ï¿½sheï¿½ instead of ï¿½it,ï¿½ and when he put out his
senile hand and touched the melon I positively had to look the other way.

ï¿½Then he told me what had happened. The Italian under-gardener, who had
been specially recommended for the melon-houses—though it was
against my cousinï¿½s principles to employ a Papist—had been assigned
to the care of the monster: for it had revealed itself, early in its
existence, as destined to become a monster, to surpass its plumpest,
pulpiest sisters, carry off prizes at agricultural shows, and be
photographed and celebrated in every gardening paper in the land. The
Italian had done well—seemed to have a sense of responsibility. And
that very morning he had been ordered to pick the melon, which was to be
shown next day at the county fair, and to bring it in for Mr. Lenman to
gaze on its blonde virginity. But in picking it, what had the damned
scoundrelly Jesuit done but drop it—drop it crash on the sharp spout
of a watering-pot, so that it received a deep gash in its firm pale
rotundity, and was henceforth but a bruised, ruined, fallen melon?

ï¿½The old manï¿½s rage was fearful in its impotence—he shook,
spluttered and strangled with it. He had just had the Italian up and had
sacked him on the spot, without wages or character—had threatened to
have him arrested if he was ever caught prowling about Wrenfield. ï¿½By God,
and Iï¿½ll do it—Iï¿½ll write to Washington—Iï¿½ll have the pauper
scoundrel deported! Iï¿½ll show him what money can do!ï¿½ As likely as not
there was some murderous Black-hand business under it—it would be
found that the fellow was a member of a ï¿½gang.ï¿½ Those Italians would
murder you for a quarter. He meant to have the police look into it... And
then he grew frightened at his own excitement. ï¿½But I must calm myself,ï¿½
he said. He took his temperature, rang for his drops, and turned to the
Churchman. He had been reading an article on Nestorianism when the melon
was brought in. He asked me to go on with it, and I read to him for an
hour, in the dim close room, with a fat fly buzzing stealthily about the
fallen melon.

ï¿½All the while one phrase of the old manï¿½s buzzed in my brain like the fly
about the melon. ï¿½
Iï¿½ll show him what money can do!
ï¿½ Good heaven! If I
could but show the old man! If I could make him see his power of giving
happiness as a new outlet for his monstrous egotism! I tried to tell him
something about my situation and Kateï¿½s—spoke of my ill-health, my
unsuccessful drudgery, my longing to write, to make myself a name—I
stammered out an entreaty for a loan. ï¿½I can guarantee to repay you, sir—Iï¿½ve
a half-written play as security...ï¿½

ï¿½I shall never forget his glassy stare. His face had grown as smooth as an
egg-shell again—his eyes peered over his fat cheeks like sentinels
over a slippery rampart.

ï¿½ï¿½A half-written play—a play of
yours
as security?ï¿½ He looked at me
almost fearfully, as if detecting the first symptoms of insanity. ï¿½Do you
understand anything of business?ï¿½ he enquired mildly. I laughed and
answered: ï¿½No, not much.ï¿½

ï¿½He leaned back with closed lids. ï¿½All this excitement has been too much
for me,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½If youï¿½ll excuse me, Iï¿½ll prepare for my nap.ï¿½ And I
stumbled out of the room, blindly, like the Italian.ï¿½

Granice moved away from the mantel-piece, and walked across to the tray
set out with decanters and soda-water. He poured himself a tall glass of
soda-water, emptied it, and glanced at Aschamï¿½s dead cigar.

ï¿½Better light another,ï¿½ he suggested.

The lawyer shook his head, and Granice went on with his tale. He told of
his mounting obsession—how the murderous impulse had waked in him on
the instant of his cousinï¿½s refusal, and he had muttered to himself: ï¿½By
God, if you wonï¿½t, Iï¿½ll make you.ï¿½ He spoke more tranquilly as the
narrative proceeded, as though his rage had died down once the resolve to
act on it was taken. He applied his whole mind to the question of how the
old man was to be ï¿½disposed of.ï¿½ Suddenly he remembered the outcry: ï¿½Those
Italians will murder you for a quarter!ï¿½ But no definite project presented
itself: he simply waited for an inspiration.

Granice and his sister moved to town a day or two after the incident of
the melon. But the cousins, who had returned, kept them informed of the
old manï¿½s condition. One day, about three weeks later, Granice, on getting
home, found Kate excited over a report from Wrenfield. The Italian had
been there again—had somehow slipped into the house, made his way up
to the library, and ï¿½used threatening language.ï¿½ The house-keeper found
cousin Joseph gasping, the whites of his eyes showing ï¿½something awful.ï¿½
The doctor was sent for, and the attack warded off; and the police had
ordered the Italian from the neighbourhood.

But cousin Joseph, thereafter, languished, had ï¿½nerves,ï¿½ and lost his
taste for toast and butter-milk. The doctor called in a colleague, and the
consultation amused and excited the old man—he became once more an
important figure. The medical men reassured the family—too
completely!—and to the patient they recommended a more varied diet:
advised him to take whatever ï¿½tempted him.ï¿½ And so one day, tremulously,
prayerfully, he decided on a tiny bit of melon. It was brought up with
ceremony, and consumed in the presence of the house-keeper and a hovering
cousin; and twenty minutes later he was dead...

ï¿½But you remember the circumstances,ï¿½ Granice went on; ï¿½how suspicion
turned at once on the Italian? In spite of the hint the police had given
him he had been seen hanging about the house since ï¿½the scene.ï¿½ It was
said that he had tender relations with the kitchen-maid, and the rest
seemed easy to explain. But when they looked round to ask him for the
explanation he was gone—gone clean out of sight. He had been
ï¿½warnedï¿½ to leave Wrenfield, and he had taken the warning so to heart that
no one ever laid eyes on him again.ï¿½

Granice paused. He had dropped into a chair opposite the lawyerï¿½s, and he
sat for a moment, his head thrown back, looking about the familiar room.
Everything in it had grown grimacing and alien, and each strange insistent
object seemed craning forward from its place to hear him.

ï¿½It was I who put the stuff in the melon,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½And I donï¿½t want you
to think Iï¿½m sorry for it. This isnï¿½t ï¿½remorse,ï¿½ understand. Iï¿½m glad the
old skin-flint is dead—Iï¿½m glad the others have their money. But
mineï¿½s no use to me any more. My sister married miserably, and died. And
Iï¿½ve never had what I wanted.ï¿½

Ascham continued to stare; then he said: ï¿½What on earth was your object,
then?ï¿½

ï¿½Why, to
get
what I wanted—what I fancied was in reach! I wanted
change, rest,
life
, for both of us—wanted, above all, for myself,
the chance to write! I travelled, got back my health, and came home to tie
myself up to my work. And Iï¿½ve slaved at it steadily for ten years without
reward—without the most distant hope of success! Nobody will look at
my stuff. And now Iï¿½m fifty, and Iï¿½m beaten, and I know it.ï¿½ His chin
dropped forward on his breast. ï¿½I want to chuck the whole business,ï¿½ he
ended.

III

It was after midnight when Ascham left.

His hand on Graniceï¿½s shoulder, as he turned to go—ï¿½District
Attorney be hanged; see a doctor, see a doctor!ï¿½ he had cried; and so,
with an exaggerated laugh, had pulled on his coat and departed.

Granice turned back into the library. It had never occurred to him that
Ascham would not believe his story. For three hours he had explained,
elucidated, patiently and painfully gone over every detail—but
without once breaking down the iron incredulity of the lawyerï¿½s eye.

At first Ascham had feigned to be convinced—but that, as Granice now
perceived, was simply to get him to expose himself, to entrap him into
contradictions. And when the attempt failed, when Granice triumphantly met
and refuted each disconcerting question, the lawyer dropped the mask
suddenly, and said with a good-humoured laugh: ï¿½By Jove, Granice youï¿½ll
write a successful play yet. The way youï¿½ve worked this all out is a
marvel.ï¿½

Granice swung about furiously—that last sneer about the play
inflamed him. Was all the world in a conspiracy to deride his failure?

ï¿½I did it, I did it,ï¿½ he muttered sullenly, his rage spending itself
against the impenetrable surface of the otherï¿½s mockery; and Ascham
answered with a smile: ï¿½Ever read any of those books on hallucination?
Iï¿½ve got a fairly good medico-legal library. I could send you one or two
if you like...ï¿½

Left alone, Granice cowered down in the chair before his writing-table. He
understood that Ascham thought him off his head.

ï¿½Good God—what if they all think me crazy?ï¿½

The horror of it broke out over him in a cold sweat—he sat there and
shook, his eyes hidden in his icy hands. But gradually, as he began to
rehearse his story for the thousandth time, he saw again how
incontrovertible it was, and felt sure that any criminal lawyer would
believe him.

ï¿½Thatï¿½s the trouble—Aschamï¿½s not a criminal lawyer. And then heï¿½s a
friend. What a fool I was to talk to a friend! Even if he did believe me,
heï¿½d never let me see it—his instinct would be to cover the whole
thing up... But in that case—if he
did
believe me—he might
think it a kindness to get me shut up in an asylum...ï¿½ Granice began to
tremble again. ï¿½Good heaven! If he should bring in an expert—one of
those damned alienists! Ascham and Pettilow can do anything—their
word always goes. If Ascham drops a hint that Iï¿½d better be shut up, Iï¿½ll
be in a strait-jacket by to-morrow! And heï¿½d do it from the kindest
motives—be quite right to do it if he thinks Iï¿½m a murderer!ï¿½

The vision froze him to his chair. He pressed his fists to his bursting
temples and tried to think. For the first time he hoped that Ascham had
not believed his story.

ï¿½But he did—he did! I can see it now—I noticed what a queer
eye he cocked at me. Good God, what shall I do—what shall I do?ï¿½

He started up and looked at the clock. Half-past one. What if Ascham
should think the case urgent, rout out an alienist, and come back with
him? Granice jumped to his feet, and his sudden gesture brushed the
morning paper from the table. Mechanically he stooped to pick it up, and
the movement started a new train of association.

He sat down again, and reached for the telephone book in the rack by his
chair.

ï¿½Give me three-o-ten... yes.ï¿½

The new idea in his mind had revived his flagging energy. He would act—act
at once. It was only by thus planning ahead, committing himself to some
unavoidable line of conduct, that he could pull himself through the
meaningless days. Each time he reached a fresh decision it was like coming
out of a foggy weltering sea into a calm harbour with lights. One of the
queerest phases of his long agony was the intense relief produced by these
momentary lulls.

ï¿½That the office of the Investigator? Yes? Give me Mr. Denver, please...
Hallo, Denver... Yes, Hubert Granice.... Just caught you? Going straight
home? Can I come and see you... yes, now... have a talk? Itï¿½s rather
urgent... yes, might give you some first-rate ï¿½copy.ï¿½... All right!ï¿½ He
hung up the receiver with a laugh. It had been a happy thought to call up
the editor of the Investigator—Robert Denver was the very man he
needed...

Granice put out the lights in the library—it was odd how the
automatic gestures persisted!—went into the hall, put on his hat and
overcoat, and let himself out of the flat. In the hall, a sleepy elevator
boy blinked at him and then dropped his head on his folded arms. Granice
passed out into the street. At the corner of Fifth Avenue he hailed a
crawling cab, and called out an up-town address. The long thoroughfare
stretched before him, dim and deserted, like an ancient avenue of tombs.
But from Denverï¿½s house a friendly beam fell on the pavement; and as
Granice sprang from his cab the editorï¿½s electric turned the corner.

The two men grasped hands, and Denver, feeling for his latch-key, ushered
Granice into the brightly-lit hall.

ï¿½Disturb me? Not a bit. You might have, at ten to-morrow morning... but
this is my liveliest hour... you know my habits of old.ï¿½

Granice had known Robert Denver for fifteen years—watched his rise
through all the stages of journalism to the Olympian pinnacle of the
Investigatorï¿½s editorial office. In the thick-set man with grizzling hair
there were few traces left of the hungry-eyed young reporter who, on his
way home in the small hours, used to ï¿½bob inï¿½ on Granice, while the latter
sat grinding at his plays. Denver had to pass Graniceï¿½s flat on the way to
his own, and it became a habit, if he saw a light in the window, and
Graniceï¿½s shadow against the blind, to go in, smoke a pipe, and discuss
the universe.

ï¿½Well—this is like old times—a good old habit reversed.ï¿½ The
editor smote his visitor genially on the shoulder. ï¿½Reminds me of the
nights when I used to rout you out... Howï¿½s the play, by the way? There
is

a play, I suppose? Itï¿½s as safe to ask you that as to say to some men:
ï¿½Howï¿½s the baby?ï¿½ï¿½

Denver laughed good-naturedly, and Granice thought how thick and heavy he
had grown. It was evident, even to Graniceï¿½s tortured nerves, that the
words had not been uttered in malice—and the fact gave him a new
measure of his insignificance. Denver did not even know that he had been a
failure! The fact hurt more than Aschamï¿½s irony.

ï¿½Come in—come in.ï¿½ The editor led the way into a small cheerful
room, where there were cigars and decanters. He pushed an arm-chair toward
his visitor, and dropped into another with a comfortable groan.

ï¿½Now, then—help yourself. And letï¿½s hear all about it.ï¿½

He beamed at Granice over his pipe-bowl, and the latter, lighting his
cigar, said to himself: ï¿½Success makes men comfortable, but it makes them
stupid.ï¿½

Then he turned, and began: ï¿½Denver, I want to tell you—ï¿½

The clock ticked rhythmically on the mantel-piece. The little room was
gradually filled with drifting blue layers of smoke, and through them the
editorï¿½s face came and went like the moon through a moving sky. Once the
hour struck—then the rhythmical ticking began again. The atmosphere
grew denser and heavier, and beads of perspiration began to roll from
Graniceï¿½s forehead.

ï¿½Do you mind if I open the window?ï¿½

ï¿½No. It
is
stuffy in here. Wait—Iï¿½ll do it myself.ï¿½ Denver pushed
down the upper sash, and returned to his chair. ï¿½Well—go on,ï¿½ he
said, filling another pipe. His composure exasperated Granice.

ï¿½Thereï¿½s no use in my going on if you donï¿½t believe me.ï¿½

The editor remained unmoved. ï¿½Who says I donï¿½t believe you? And how can I
tell till youï¿½ve finished?ï¿½

Granice went on, ashamed of his outburst. ï¿½It was simple enough, as youï¿½ll
see. From the day the old man said to me, ï¿½Those Italians would murder you
for a quarter,ï¿½ I dropped everything and just worked at my scheme. It
struck me at once that I must find a way of getting to Wrenfield and back
in a night—and that led to the idea of a motor. A motor—that
never occurred to you? You wonder where I got the money, I suppose. Well,
I had a thousand or so put by, and I nosed around till I found what I
wanted—a second-hand racer. I knew how to drive a car, and I tried
the thing and found it was all right. Times were bad, and I bought it for
my price, and stored it away. Where? Why, in one of those
no-questions-asked garages where they keep motors that are not for family
use. I had a lively cousin who had put me up to that dodge, and I looked
about till I found a queer hole where they took in my car like a baby in a
foundling asylum... Then I practiced running to Wrenfield and back in a
night. I knew the way pretty well, for Iï¿½d done it often with the same
lively cousin—and in the small hours, too. The distance is over
ninety miles, and on the third trial I did it under two hours. But my arms
were so lame that I could hardly get dressed the next morning...

ï¿½Well, then came the report about the Italianï¿½s threats, and I saw I must
act at once... I meant to break into the old manï¿½s room, shoot him, and
get away again. It was a big risk, but I thought I could manage it. Then
we heard that he was ill—that thereï¿½d been a consultation. Perhaps
the fates were going to do it for me! Good Lord, if that could only
be!...ï¿½

Granice stopped and wiped his forehead: the open window did not seem to
have cooled the room.

ï¿½Then came word that he was better; and the day after, when I came up from
my office, I found Kate laughing over the news that he was to try a bit of
melon. The house-keeper had just telephoned her—all Wrenfield was in
a flutter. The doctor himself had picked out the melon, one of the little
French ones that are hardly bigger than a large tomato—and the
patient was to eat it at his breakfast the next morning.

ï¿½In a flash I saw my chance. It was a bare chance, no more. But I knew the
ways of the house—I was sure the melon would be brought in over
night and put in the pantry ice-box. If there were only one melon in the
ice-box I could be fairly sure it was the one I wanted. Melons didnï¿½t lie
around loose in that house—every one was known, numbered,
catalogued. The old man was beset by the dread that the servants would eat
them, and he took a hundred mean precautions to prevent it. Yes, I felt
pretty sure of my melon... and poisoning was much safer than shooting. It
would have been the devil and all to get into the old manï¿½s bedroom
without his rousing the house; but I ought to be able to break into the
pantry without much trouble.

ï¿½It was a cloudy night, too—everything served me. I dined quietly,
and sat down at my desk. Kate had one of her usual headaches, and went to
bed early. As soon as she was gone I slipped out. I had got together a
sort of disguise—red beard and queer-looking ulster. I shoved them
into a bag, and went round to the garage. There was no one there but a
half-drunken machinist whom Iï¿½d never seen before. That served me, too.
They were always changing machinists, and this new fellow didnï¿½t even
bother to ask if the car belonged to me. It was a very easy-going place...

ï¿½Well, I jumped in, ran up Broadway, and let the car go as soon as I was
out of Harlem. Dark as it was, I could trust myself to strike a sharp
pace. In the shadow of a wood I stopped a second and got into the beard
and ulster. Then away again—it was just eleven-thirty when I got to
Wrenfield.

ï¿½I left the car in a dark lane behind the Lenman place, and slipped
through the kitchen-garden. The melon-houses winked at me through the dark—I
remember thinking that they knew what I wanted to know.... By the stable a
dog came out growling—but he nosed me out, jumped on me, and went
back... The house was as dark as the grave. I knew everybody went to bed
by ten. But there might be a prowling servant—the kitchen-maid might
have come down to let in her Italian. I had to risk that, of course. I
crept around by the back door and hid in the shrubbery. Then I listened.
It was all as silent as death. I crossed over to the house, pried open the
pantry window and climbed in. I had a little electric lamp in my pocket,
and shielding it with my cap I groped my way to the ice-box, opened it—and
there was the little French melon... only one.

ï¿½I stopped to listen—I was quite cool. Then I pulled out my bottle
of stuff and my syringe, and gave each section of the melon a hypodermic.
It was all done inside of three minutes—at ten minutes to twelve I
was back in the car. I got out of the lane as quietly as I could, struck a
back road that skirted the village, and let the car out as soon as I was
beyond the last houses. I only stopped once on the way in, to drop the
beard and ulster into a pond. I had a big stone ready to weight them with
and they went down plump, like a dead body—and at two oï¿½clock I was
back at my desk.ï¿½

Granice stopped speaking and looked across the smoke-fumes at his
listener; but Denverï¿½s face remained inscrutable.

At length he said: ï¿½Why did you want to tell me this?ï¿½

The question startled Granice. He was about to explain, as he had
explained to Ascham; but suddenly it occurred to him that if his motive
had not seemed convincing to the lawyer it would carry much less weight
with Denver. Both were successful men, and success does not understand the
subtle agony of failure. Granice cast about for another reason.

ï¿½Why, I—the thing haunts me... remorse, I suppose youï¿½d call it...ï¿½

Denver struck the ashes from his empty pipe.

ï¿½Remorse? Bosh!ï¿½ he said energetically.

Graniceï¿½s heart sank. ï¿½You donï¿½t believe in—
remorse
?ï¿½

ï¿½Not an atom: in the man of action. The mere fact of your talking of
remorse proves to me that youï¿½re not the man to have planned and put
through such a job.ï¿½

Granice groaned. ï¿½Well—I lied to you about remorse. Iï¿½ve never felt
any.ï¿½

Denverï¿½s lips tightened sceptically about his freshly-filled pipe. ï¿½What
was your motive, then? You must have had one.ï¿½

ï¿½Iï¿½ll tell you—ï¿½ And Granice began again to rehearse the story of
his failure, of his loathing for life. ï¿½Donï¿½t say you donï¿½t believe me
this time... that this isnï¿½t a real reason!ï¿½ he stammered out piteously as
he ended.

Denver meditated. ï¿½No, I wonï¿½t say that. Iï¿½ve seen too many queer things.
Thereï¿½s always a reason for wanting to get out of life—the wonder is
that we find so many for staying in!ï¿½ Graniceï¿½s heart grew light. ï¿½Then
you
do
believe me?ï¿½ he faltered.

ï¿½Believe that youï¿½re sick of the job? Yes. And that you havenï¿½t the nerve
to pull the trigger? Oh, yes—thatï¿½s easy enough, too. But all that
doesnï¿½t make you a murderer—though I donï¿½t say it proves you could
never have been one.ï¿½

ï¿½I
have
been one, Denver—I swear to you.ï¿½

ï¿½Perhaps.ï¿½ He meditated. ï¿½Just tell me one or two things.ï¿½

ï¿½Oh, go ahead. You wonï¿½t stump me!ï¿½ Granice heard himself say with a
laugh.

ï¿½Well—how did you make all those trial trips without exciting your
sisterï¿½s curiosity? I knew your night habits pretty well at that time,
remember. You were very seldom out late. Didnï¿½t the change in your ways
surprise her?ï¿½

ï¿½No; because she was away at the time. She went to pay several visits in
the country soon after we came back from Wrenfield, and was only in town
for a night or two before—before I did the job.ï¿½

ï¿½And that night she went to bed early with a headache?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes—blinding. She didnï¿½t know anything when she had that kind. And
her room was at the back of the flat.ï¿½

Denver again meditated. ï¿½And when you got back—she didnï¿½t hear you?
You got in without her knowing it?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes. I went straight to my work—took it up at the word where Iï¿½d
left off—
Why, denver, donï¿½t you remember
?ï¿½ Granice suddenly,
passionately interjected.

ï¿½Remember—?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes; how you found me—when you looked in that morning, between two
and three... your usual hour...?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes,ï¿½ the editor nodded.

Granice gave a short laugh. ï¿½In my old coat—with my pipe: looked as
if Iï¿½d been working all night, didnï¿½t I? Well, I hadnï¿½t been in my chair
ten minutes!ï¿½

Denver uncrossed his legs and then crossed them again. ï¿½I didnï¿½t know
whether
you
remembered that.ï¿½

ï¿½What?ï¿½

ï¿½My coming in that particular night—or morning.ï¿½

Granice swung round in his chair. ï¿½Why, man alive! Thatï¿½s why Iï¿½m here
now. Because it was you who spoke for me at the inquest, when they looked
round to see what all the old manï¿½s heirs had been doing that night—you
who testified to having dropped in and found me at my desk as usual.... I
thought
that
would appeal to your journalistic sense if nothing else
would!ï¿½

Denver smiled. ï¿½Oh, my journalistic sense is still susceptible enough—and
the ideaï¿½s picturesque, I grant you: asking the man who proved your alibi
to establish your guilt.ï¿½

ï¿½Thatï¿½s it—thatï¿½s it!ï¿½ Graniceï¿½s laugh had a ring of triumph.

ï¿½Well, but how about the other chapï¿½s testimony—I mean that young
doctor: what was his name? Ned Ranney. Donï¿½t you remember my testifying
that Iï¿½d met him at the elevated station, and told him I was on my way to
smoke a pipe with you, and his saying: ï¿½All right; youï¿½ll find him in. I
passed the house two hours ago, and saw his shadow against the blind, as
usual.ï¿½ And the lady with the toothache in the flat across the way: she
corroborated his statement, you remember.ï¿½

ï¿½Yes; I remember.ï¿½

ï¿½Well, then?ï¿½

ï¿½Simple enough. Before starting I rigged up a kind of mannikin with old
coats and a cushion—something to cast a shadow on the blind. All you
fellows were used to seeing my shadow there in the small hours—I
counted on that, and knew youï¿½d take any vague outline as mine.ï¿½

ï¿½Simple enough, as you say. But the woman with the toothache saw the
shadow move—you remember she said she saw you sink forward, as if
youï¿½d fallen asleep.ï¿½

ï¿½Yes; and she was right. It
did
move. I suppose some extra-heavy dray must
have jolted by the flimsy building—at any rate, something gave my
mannikin a jar, and when I came back he had sunk forward, half over the
table.ï¿½

There was a long silence between the two men. Granice, with a throbbing
heart, watched Denver refill his pipe. The editor, at any rate, did not
sneer and flout him. After all, journalism gave a deeper insight than the
law into the fantastic possibilities of life, prepared one better to allow
for the incalculableness of human impulses.

ï¿½Well?ï¿½ Granice faltered out.

Denver stood up with a shrug. ï¿½Look here, man—whatï¿½s wrong with you?
Make a clean breast of it! Nerves gone to smash? Iï¿½d like to take you to
see a chap I know—an ex-prize-fighter—whoï¿½s a wonder at
pulling fellows in your state out of their hole—ï¿½

ï¿½Oh, oh—ï¿½ Granice broke in. He stood up also, and the two men eyed
each other. ï¿½You donï¿½t believe me, then?ï¿½

ï¿½This yarn—how can I? There wasnï¿½t a flaw in your alibi.ï¿½

ï¿½But havenï¿½t I filled it full of them now?ï¿½

Denver shook his head. ï¿½I might think so if I hadnï¿½t happened to know that
you
wanted
to. Thereï¿½s the hitch, donï¿½t you see?ï¿½

Granice groaned. ï¿½No, I didnï¿½t. You mean my wanting to be found guilty—?ï¿½

ï¿½Of course! If somebody else had accused you, the story might have been
worth looking into. As it is, a child could have invented it. It doesnï¿½t
do much credit to your ingenuity.ï¿½

Granice turned sullenly toward the door. What was the use of arguing? But
on the threshold a sudden impulse drew him back. ï¿½Look here, Denver—I
daresay youï¿½re right. But will you do just one thing to prove it? Put my
statement in the Investigator, just as Iï¿½ve made it. Ridicule it as much
as you like. Only give the other fellows a chance at it—men who
donï¿½t know anything about me. Set them talking and looking about. I donï¿½t
care a damn whether
you
believe me—what I want is to convince the
Grand Jury! I oughtnï¿½t to have come to a man who knows me—your
cursed incredulity is infectious. I donï¿½t put my case well, because I know
in advance itï¿½s discredited, and I almost end by not believing it myself.
Thatï¿½s why I canï¿½t convince
you
. Itï¿½s a vicious circle.ï¿½ He laid a hand on
Denverï¿½s arm. ï¿½Send a stenographer, and put my statement in the paper.ï¿½

But Denver did not warm to the idea. ï¿½My dear fellow, you seem to forget
that all the evidence was pretty thoroughly sifted at the time, every
possible clue followed up. The public would have been ready enough then to
believe that you murdered old Lenman—you or anybody else. All they
wanted was a murderer—the most improbable would have served. But
your alibi was too confoundedly complete. And nothing youï¿½ve told me has
shaken it.ï¿½ Denver laid his cool hand over the otherï¿½s burning fingers.
ï¿½Look here, old fellow, go home and work up a better case—then come
in and submit it to the Investigator.ï¿½

IV

The perspiration was rolling off Graniceï¿½s forehead. Every few minutes he
had to draw out his handkerchief and wipe the moisture from his haggard
face.

For an hour and a half he had been talking steadily, putting his case to
the District Attorney. Luckily he had a speaking acquaintance with
Allonby, and had obtained, without much difficulty, a private audience on
the very day after his talk with Robert Denver. In the interval between he
had hurried home, got out of his evening clothes, and gone forth again at
once into the dreary dawn. His fear of Ascham and the alienist made it
impossible for him to remain in his rooms. And it seemed to him that the
only way of averting that hideous peril was by establishing, in some sane
impartial mind, the proof of his guilt. Even if he had not been so
incurably sick of life, the electric chair seemed now the only alternative
to the strait-jacket.

As he paused to wipe his forehead he saw the District Attorney glance at
his watch. The gesture was significant, and Granice lifted an appealing
hand. ï¿½I donï¿½t expect you to believe me now—but canï¿½t you put me
under arrest, and have the thing looked into?ï¿½

Allonby smiled faintly under his heavy grayish moustache. He had a ruddy
face, full and jovial, in which his keen professional eyes seemed to keep
watch over impulses not strictly professional.

ï¿½Well, I donï¿½t know that we need lock you up just yet. But of course Iï¿½m
bound to look into your statement—ï¿½

Granice rose with an exquisite sense of relief. Surely Allonby wouldnï¿½t
have said that if he hadnï¿½t believed him!

ï¿½Thatï¿½s all right. Then I neednï¿½t detain you. I can be found at any time
at my apartment.ï¿½ He gave the address.

The District Attorney smiled again, more openly. ï¿½What do you say to
leaving it for an hour or two this evening? Iï¿½m giving a little supper at
Rectorï¿½s—quiet, little affair, you understand: just Miss Melrose—I
think you know her—and a friend or two; and if youï¿½ll join us...ï¿½

Granice stumbled out of the office without knowing what reply he had made.

He waited for four days—four days of concentrated horror. During the
first twenty-four hours the fear of Aschamï¿½s alienist dogged him; and as
that subsided, it was replaced by the exasperating sense that his avowal
had made no impression on the District Attorney. Evidently, if he had been
going to look into the case, Allonby would have been heard from before
now.... And that mocking invitation to supper showed clearly enough how
little the story had impressed him!

Granice was overcome by the futility of any farther attempt to inculpate
himself. He was chained to life—a ï¿½prisoner of consciousness.ï¿½ Where
was it he had read the phrase? Well, he was learning what it meant. In the
glaring night-hours, when his brain seemed ablaze, he was visited by a
sense of his fixed identity, of his irreducible, inexpugnable
selfness
,
keener, more insidious, more unescapable, than any sensation he had ever
known. He had not guessed that the mind was capable of such intricacies of
self-realization, of penetrating so deep into its own dark windings. Often
he woke from his brief snatches of sleep with the feeling that something
material was clinging to him, was on his hands and face, and in his throat—and
as his brain cleared he understood that it was the sense of his own
loathed personality that stuck to him like some thick viscous substance.

Then, in the first morning hours, he would rise and look out of his window
at the awakening activities of the street—at the street-cleaners,
the ash-cart drivers, and the other dingy workers flitting hurriedly by
through the sallow winter light. Oh, to be one of them—any of them—to
take his chance in any of their skins! They were the toilers—the men
whose lot was pitied—the victims wept over and ranted about by
altruists and economists; and how gladly he would have taken up the load
of any one of them, if only he might have shaken off his own! But, no—the
iron circle of consciousness held them too: each one was hand-cuffed to
his own hideous ego. Why wish to be any one man rather than another? The
only absolute good was not to be... And Flint, coming in to draw his bath,
would ask if he preferred his eggs scrambled or poached that morning?

On the fifth day he wrote a long urgent letter to Allonby; and for the
succeeding two days he had the occupation of waiting for an answer. He
hardly stirred from his rooms, in his fear of missing the letter by a
moment; but would the District Attorney write, or send a representative: a
policeman, a ï¿½secret agent,ï¿½ or some other mysterious emissary of the law?

On the third morning Flint, stepping softly—as if, confound it! his
master were ill—entered the library where Granice sat behind an
unread newspaper, and proferred a card on a tray.

Granice read the name—J. B. Hewson—and underneath, in pencil,
ï¿½From the District Attorneyï¿½s office.ï¿½ He started up with a thumping
heart, and signed an assent to the servant.

Mr. Hewson was a slight sallow nondescript man of about fifty—the
kind of man of whom one is sure to see a specimen in any crowd. ï¿½Just the
type of the successful detective,ï¿½ Granice reflected as he shook hands
with his visitor.

And it was in that character that Mr. Hewson briefly introduced himself.
He had been sent by the District Attorney to have ï¿½a quiet talkï¿½ with Mr.
Granice—to ask him to repeat the statement he had made about the
Lenman murder.

His manner was so quiet, so reasonable and receptive, that Graniceï¿½s
self-confidence returned. Here was a sensible man—a man who knew his
business—it would be easy enough to make
him
see through that
ridiculous alibi! Granice offered Mr. Hewson a cigar, and lighting one
himself—to prove his coolness—began again to tell his story.

He was conscious, as he proceeded, of telling it better than ever before.
Practice helped, no doubt; and his listenerï¿½s detached, impartial attitude
helped still more. He could see that Hewson, at least, had not decided in
advance to disbelieve him, and the sense of being trusted made him more
lucid and more consecutive. Yes, this time his words would certainly carry
conviction...

V

Despairingly, Granice gazed up and down the shabby street. Beside him
stood a young man with bright prominent eyes, a smooth but not too
smoothly-shaven face, and an Irish smile. The young manï¿½s nimble glance
followed Graniceï¿½s.

ï¿½Sure of the number, are you?ï¿½ he asked briskly.

ï¿½Oh, yes—it was 104.ï¿½

ï¿½Well, then, the new building has swallowed it up—thatï¿½s certain.ï¿½

He tilted his head back and surveyed the half-finished front of a brick
and limestone flat-house that reared its flimsy elegance above a row of
tottering tenements and stables.

ï¿½Dead sure?ï¿½ he repeated.

ï¿½Yes,ï¿½ said Granice, discouraged. ï¿½And even if I hadnï¿½t been, I know the
garage was just opposite Lefflerï¿½s over there.ï¿½ He pointed across the
street to a tumble-down stable with a blotched sign on which the words
ï¿½Livery and Boardingï¿½ were still faintly discernible.

The young man dashed across to the opposite pavement. ï¿½Well, thatï¿½s
something—may get a clue there. Lefflerï¿½s—same name there,
anyhow. You remember that name?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes—distinctly.ï¿½

Granice had felt a return of confidence since he had enlisted the interest
of the Explorerï¿½s ï¿½smartestï¿½ reporter. If there were moments when he
hardly believed his own story, there were others when it seemed impossible
that every one should not believe it; and young Peter McCarren, peering,
listening, questioning, jotting down notes, inspired him with an exquisite
sense of security. McCarren had fastened on the case at once, ï¿½like a
leech,ï¿½ as he phrased it—jumped at it, thrilled to it, and settled
down to ï¿½draw the last drop of fact from it, and had not let go till he
had.ï¿½ No one else had treated Granice in that way—even Allonbyï¿½s
detective had not taken a single note. And though a week had elapsed since
the visit of that authorized official, nothing had been heard from the
District Attorneyï¿½s office: Allonby had apparently dropped the matter
again. But McCarren wasnï¿½t going to drop it—not he! He positively
hung on Graniceï¿½s footsteps. They had spent the greater part of the
previous day together, and now they were off again, running down clues.

But at Lefflerï¿½s they got none, after all. Lefflerï¿½s was no longer a
stable. It was condemned to demolition, and in the respite between
sentence and execution it had become a vague place of storage, a hospital
for broken-down carriages and carts, presided over by a blear-eyed old
woman who knew nothing of Floodï¿½s garage across the way—did not even
remember what had stood there before the new flat-house began to rise.

ï¿½Well—we may run Leffler down somewhere; Iï¿½ve seen harder jobs
done,ï¿½ said McCarren, cheerfully noting down the name.

As they walked back toward Sixth Avenue he added, in a less sanguine tone:
ï¿½Iï¿½d undertake now to put the thing through if you could only put me on
the track of that cyanide.ï¿½

Graniceï¿½s heart sank. Yes—there was the weak spot; he had felt it
from the first! But he still hoped to convince McCarren that his case was
strong enough without it; and he urged the reporter to come back to his
rooms and sum up the facts with him again.

ï¿½Sorry, Mr. Granice, but Iï¿½m due at the office now. Besides, itï¿½d be no
use till I get some fresh stuff to work on. Suppose I call you up tomorrow
or next day?ï¿½

He plunged into a trolley and left Granice gazing desolately after him.

Two days later he reappeared at the apartment, a shade less jaunty in
demeanor.

ï¿½Well, Mr. Granice, the stars in their courses are against you, as the
bard says. Canï¿½t get a trace of Flood, or of Leffler either. And you say
you bought the motor through Flood, and sold it through him, too?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes,ï¿½ said Granice wearily.

ï¿½Who bought it, do you know?ï¿½

Granice wrinkled his brows. ï¿½Why, Flood—yes, Flood himself. I sold
it back to him three months later.ï¿½

ï¿½Flood? The devil! And Iï¿½ve ransacked the town for Flood. That kind of
business disappears as if the earth had swallowed it.ï¿½

Granice, discouraged, kept silence.

ï¿½That brings us back to the poison,ï¿½ McCarren continued, his note-book
out. ï¿½Just go over that again, will you?ï¿½

And Granice went over it again. It had all been so simple at the time—and
he had been so clever in covering up his traces! As soon as he decided on
poison he looked about for an acquaintance who manufactured chemicals; and
there was Jim Dawes, a Harvard classmate, in the dyeing business—just
the man. But at the last moment it occurred to him that suspicion might
turn toward so obvious an opportunity, and he decided on a more tortuous
course. Another friend, Carrick Venn, a student of medicine whom
irremediable ill-health had kept from the practice of his profession,
amused his leisure with experiments in physics, for the exercise of which
he had set up a simple laboratory. Granice had the habit of dropping in to
smoke a cigar with him on Sunday afternoons, and the friends generally sat
in Vennï¿½s work-shop, at the back of the old family house in Stuyvesant
Square. Off this work-shop was the cupboard of supplies, with its row of
deadly bottles. Carrick Venn was an original, a man of restless curious
tastes, and his place, on a Sunday, was often full of visitors: a cheerful
crowd of journalists, scribblers, painters, experimenters in divers forms
of expression. Coming and going among so many, it was easy enough to pass
unperceived; and one afternoon Granice, arriving before Venn had returned
home, found himself alone in the work-shop, and quickly slipping into the
cupboard, transferred the drug to his pocket.

But that had happened ten years ago; and Venn, poor fellow, was long since
dead of his dragging ailment. His old father was dead, too, the house in
Stuyvesant Square had been turned into a boarding-house, and the shifting
life of New York had passed its rapid sponge over every trace of their
obscure little history. Even the optimistic McCarren seemed to acknowledge
the hopelessness of seeking for proof in that direction.

ï¿½And thereï¿½s the third door slammed in our faces.ï¿½ He shut his note-book,
and throwing back his head, rested his bright inquisitive eyes on
Graniceï¿½s furrowed face.

ï¿½Look here, Mr. Granice—you see the weak spot, donï¿½t you?ï¿½

The other made a despairing motion. ï¿½I see so many!ï¿½

ï¿½Yes: but the one that weakens all the others. Why the deuce do you want
this thing known? Why do you want to put your head into the noose?ï¿½

Granice looked at him hopelessly, trying to take the measure of his quick
light irreverent mind. No one so full of a cheerful animal life would
believe in the craving for death as a sufficient motive; and Granice
racked his brain for one more convincing. But suddenly he saw the
reporterï¿½s face soften, and melt to a naive sentimentalism.

ï¿½Mr. Granice—has the memory of it always haunted you?ï¿½

Granice stared a moment, and then leapt at the opening. ï¿½Thatï¿½s it—the
memory of it... always...ï¿½

McCarren nodded vehemently. ï¿½Dogged your steps, eh? Wouldnï¿½t let you
sleep? The time came when you
had
to make a clean breast of it?ï¿½

ï¿½I had to. Canï¿½t you understand?ï¿½

The reporter struck his fist on the table. ï¿½God, sir! I donï¿½t suppose
thereï¿½s a human being with a drop of warm blood in him that canï¿½t picture
the deadly horrors of remorse—ï¿½

The Celtic imagination was aflame, and Granice mutely thanked him for the
word. What neither Ascham nor Denver would accept as a conceivable motive
the Irish reporter seized on as the most adequate; and, as he said, once
one could find a convincing motive, the difficulties of the case became so
many incentives to effort.

ï¿½Remorse—
remorse
,ï¿½ he repeated, rolling the word under his tongue
with an accent that was a clue to the psychology of the popular drama; and
Granice, perversely, said to himself: ï¿½If I could only have struck that
note I should have been running in six theatres at once.ï¿½

He saw that from that moment McCarrenï¿½s professional zeal would be fanned
by emotional curiosity; and he profited by the fact to propose that they
should dine together, and go on afterward to some music-hall or theatre.
It was becoming necessary to Granice to feel himself an object of
pre-occupation, to find himself in another mind. He took a kind of gray
penumbral pleasure in riveting McCarrenï¿½s attention on his case; and to
feign the grimaces of moral anguish became a passionately engrossing game.
He had not entered a theatre for months; but he sat out the meaningless
performance in rigid tolerance, sustained by the sense of the reporterï¿½s
observation.

Between the acts, McCarren amused him with anecdotes about the audience:
he knew every one by sight, and could lift the curtain from every
physiognomy. Granice listened indulgently. He had lost all interest in his
kind, but he knew that he was himself the real centre of McCarrenï¿½s
attention, and that every word the latter spoke had an indirect bearing on
his own problem.

ï¿½See that fellow over there—the little dried-up man in the third
row, pulling his moustache?
His
memoirs would be worth publishing,ï¿½
McCarren said suddenly in the last entrï¿½acte.

Granice, following his glance, recognized the detective from Allonbyï¿½s
office. For a moment he had the thrilling sense that he was being
shadowed.

ï¿½Caesar, if
he
could talk—!ï¿½ McCarren continued. ï¿½Know who he is, of
course? Dr. John B. Stell, the biggest alienist in the country—ï¿½

Granice, with a start, bent again between the heads in front of him. ï¿½
That

man—the fourth from the aisle? Youï¿½re mistaken. Thatï¿½s not Dr.
Stell.ï¿½

McCarren laughed. ï¿½Well, I guess Iï¿½ve been in court enough to know Stell
when I see him. He testifies in nearly all the big cases where they plead
insanity.ï¿½

A cold shiver ran down Graniceï¿½s spine, but he repeated obstinately:
ï¿½Thatï¿½s not Dr. Stell.ï¿½

ï¿½Not Stell? Why, man, I
know
him. Look—here he comes. If it isnï¿½t
Stell, he wonï¿½t speak to me.ï¿½

The little dried-up man was moving slowly up the aisle. As he neared
McCarren he made a slight gesture of recognition.

ï¿½Howï¿½do, Doctor Stell? Pretty slim show, ainï¿½t it?ï¿½ the reporter
cheerfully flung out at him. And Mr. J. B. Hewson, with a nod of amicable
assent, passed on.

Granice sat benumbed. He knew he had not been mistaken—the man who
had just passed was the same man whom Allonby had sent to see him: a
physician disguised as a detective. Allonby, then, had thought him insane,
like the others—had regarded his confession as the maundering of a
maniac. The discovery froze Granice with horror—he seemed to see the
mad-house gaping for him.

ï¿½Isnï¿½t there a man a good deal like him—a detective named J. B.
Hewson?ï¿½

But he knew in advance what McCarrenï¿½s answer would be. ï¿½Hewson? J. B.
Hewson? Never heard of him. But that was J. B. Stell fast enough—I
guess he can be trusted to know himself, and you saw he answered to his
name.ï¿½

VI

Some days passed before Granice could obtain a word with the District
Attorney: he began to think that Allonby avoided him.

But when they were face to face Allonbyï¿½s jovial countenance showed no
sign of embarrassment. He waved his visitor to a chair, and leaned across
his desk with the encouraging smile of a consulting physician.

Granice broke out at once: ï¿½That detective you sent me the other day—ï¿½

Allonby raised a deprecating hand.

ï¿½—I know: it was Stell the alienist. Why did you do that, Allonby?ï¿½

The otherï¿½s face did not lose its composure. ï¿½Because I looked up your
story first—and thereï¿½s nothing in it.ï¿½

ï¿½Nothing in it?ï¿½ Granice furiously interposed.

ï¿½Absolutely nothing. If there is, why the deuce donï¿½t you bring me proofs?
I know youï¿½ve been talking to Peter Ascham, and to Denver, and to that
little ferret McCarren of the Explorer. Have any of them been able to make
out a case for you? No. Well, what am I to do?ï¿½

Graniceï¿½s lips began to tremble. ï¿½Why did you play me that trick?ï¿½

ï¿½About Stell? I had to, my dear fellow: itï¿½s part of my business. Stell
is

a detective, if you come to that—every doctor is.ï¿½

The trembling of Graniceï¿½s lips increased, communicating itself in a long
quiver to his facial muscles. He forced a laugh through his dry throat.
ï¿½Well—and what did he detect?ï¿½

ï¿½In you? Oh, he thinks itï¿½s overwork—overwork and too much smoking.
If you look in on him some day at his office heï¿½ll show you the record of
hundreds of cases like yours, and advise you what treatment to follow.
Itï¿½s one of the commonest forms of hallucination. Have a cigar, all the
same.ï¿½

ï¿½But, Allonby, I killed that man!ï¿½

The District Attorneyï¿½s large hand, outstretched on his desk, had an
almost imperceptible gesture, and a moment later, as if an answer to the
call of an electric bell, a clerk looked in from the outer office.

ï¿½Sorry, my dear fellow—lot of people waiting. Drop in on Stell some
morning,ï¿½ Allonby said, shaking hands.

McCarren had to own himself beaten: there was absolutely no flaw in the
alibi. And since his duty to his journal obviously forbade his wasting
time on insoluble mysteries, he ceased to frequent Granice, who dropped
back into a deeper isolation. For a day or two after his visit to Allonby
he continued to live in dread of Dr. Stell. Why might not Allonby have
deceived him as to the alienistï¿½s diagnosis? What if he were really being
shadowed, not by a police agent but by a mad-doctor? To have the truth
out, he suddenly determined to call on Dr. Stell.

The physician received him kindly, and reverted without embarrassment to
the conditions of their previous meeting. ï¿½We have to do that
occasionally, Mr. Granice; itï¿½s one of our methods. And you had given
Allonby a fright.ï¿½

Granice was silent. He would have liked to reaffirm his guilt, to produce
the fresh arguments which had occurred to him since his last talk with the
physician; but he feared his eagerness might be taken for a symptom of
derangement, and he affected to smile away Dr. Stellï¿½s allusion.

ï¿½You think, then, itï¿½s a case of brain-fag—nothing more?ï¿½

ï¿½Nothing more. And I should advise you to knock off tobacco. You smoke a
good deal, donï¿½t you?ï¿½

He developed his treatment, recommending massage, gymnastics, travel, or
any form of diversion that did not—that in short—

Granice interrupted him impatiently. ï¿½Oh, I loathe all that—and Iï¿½m
sick of travelling.ï¿½

ï¿½Hï¿½m. Then some larger interest—politics, reform, philanthropy?
Something to take you out of yourself.ï¿½

ï¿½Yes. I understand,ï¿½ said Granice wearily.

ï¿½Above all, donï¿½t lose heart. I see hundreds of cases like yours,ï¿½ the
doctor added cheerfully from the threshold.

On the doorstep Granice stood still and laughed. Hundreds of cases like
his—the case of a man who had committed a murder, who confessed his
guilt, and whom no one would believe! Why, there had never been a case
like it in the world. What a good figure Stell would have made in a play:
the great alienist who couldnï¿½t read a manï¿½s mind any better than that!

Granice saw huge comic opportunities in the type.

But as he walked away, his fears dispelled, the sense of listlessness
returned on him. For the first time since his avowal to Peter Ascham he
found himself without an occupation, and understood that he had been
carried through the past weeks only by the necessity of constant action.
Now his life had once more become a stagnant backwater, and as he stood on
the street corner watching the tides of traffic sweep by, he asked himself
despairingly how much longer he could endure to float about in the
sluggish circle of his consciousness.

The thought of self-destruction recurred to him; but again his flesh
recoiled. He yearned for death from other hands, but he could never take
it from his own. And, aside from his insuperable physical reluctance,
another motive restrained him. He was possessed by the dogged desire to
establish the truth of his story. He refused to be swept aside as an
irresponsible dreamer—even if he had to kill himself in the end, he
would not do so before proving to society that he had deserved death from
it.

He began to write long letters to the papers; but after the first had been
published and commented on, public curiosity was quelled by a brief
statement from the District Attorneyï¿½s office, and the rest of his
communications remained unprinted. Ascham came to see him, and begged him
to travel. Robert Denver dropped in, and tried to joke him out of his
delusion; till Granice, mistrustful of their motives, began to dread the
reappearance of Dr. Stell, and set a guard on his lips. But the words he
kept back engendered others and still others in his brain. His inner self
became a humming factory of arguments, and he spent long hours reciting
and writing down elaborate statements of his crime, which he constantly
retouched and developed. Then gradually his activity languished under the
lack of an audience, the sense of being buried beneath deepening drifts of
indifference. In a passion of resentment he swore that he would prove
himself a murderer, even if he had to commit another crime to do it; and
for a sleepless night or two the thought flamed red on his darkness. But
daylight dispelled it. The determining impulse was lacking and he hated
too promiscuously to choose his victim... So he was thrown back on the
unavailing struggle to impose the truth of his story. As fast as one
channel closed on him he tried to pierce another through the sliding sands
of incredulity. But every issue seemed blocked, and the whole human race
leagued together to cheat one man of the right to die.

Thus viewed, the situation became so monstrous that he lost his last shred
of self-restraint in contemplating it. What if he were really the victim
of some mocking experiment, the centre of a ring of holiday-makers jeering
at a poor creature in its blind dashes against the solid walls of
consciousness? But, no—men were not so uniformly cruel: there were
flaws in the close surface of their indifference, cracks of weakness and
pity here and there...

Granice began to think that his mistake lay in having appealed to persons
more or less familiar with his past, and to whom the visible conformities
of his life seemed a final disproof of its one fierce secret deviation.
The general tendency was to take for the whole of life the slit seen
between the blinders of habit: and in his walk down that narrow vista
Granice cut a correct enough figure. To a vision free to follow his whole
orbit his story would be more intelligible: it would be easier to convince
a chance idler in the street than the trained intelligence hampered by a
sense of his antecedents. This idea shot up in him with the tropic
luxuriance of each new seed of thought, and he began to walk the streets,
and to frequent out-of-the-way chop-houses and bars in his search for the
impartial stranger to whom he should disclose himself.

At first every face looked encouragement; but at the crucial moment he
always held back. So much was at stake, and it was so essential that his
first choice should be decisive. He dreaded stupidity, timidity,
intolerance. The imaginative eye, the furrowed brow, were what he sought.
He must reveal himself only to a heart versed in the tortuous motions of
the human will; and he began to hate the dull benevolence of the average
face. Once or twice, obscurely, allusively, he made a beginning—once
sitting down at a manï¿½s side in a basement chop-house, another day
approaching a lounger on an east-side wharf. But in both cases the
premonition of failure checked him on the brink of avowal. His dread of
being taken for a man in the clutch of a fixed idea gave him an unnatural
keenness in reading the expression of his interlocutors, and he had
provided himself in advance with a series of verbal alternatives,
trap-doors of evasion from the first dart of ridicule or suspicion.

He passed the greater part of the day in the streets, coming home at
irregular hours, dreading the silence and orderliness of his apartment,
and the critical scrutiny of Flint. His real life was spent in a world so
remote from this familiar setting that he sometimes had the mysterious
sense of a living metempsychosis, a furtive passage from one identity to
another—yet the other as unescapably himself!

One humiliation he was spared: the desire to live never revived in him.
Not for a moment was he tempted to a shabby pact with existing conditions.
He wanted to die, wanted it with the fixed unwavering desire which alone
attains its end. And still the end eluded him! It would not always, of
course—he had full faith in the dark star of his destiny. And he
could prove it best by repeating his story, persistently and
indefatigably, pouring it into indifferent ears, hammering it into dull
brains, till at last it kindled a spark, and some one of the careless
millions paused, listened, believed...

It was a mild March day, and he had been loitering on the west-side docks,
looking at faces. He was becoming an expert in physiognomies: his
eagerness no longer made rash darts and awkward recoils. He knew now the
face he needed, as clearly as if it had come to him in a vision; and not
till he found it would he speak. As he walked eastward through the shabby
reeking streets he had a premonition that he should find it that morning.
Perhaps it was the promise of spring in the air—certainly he felt
calmer than for many days...

He turned into Washington Square, struck across it obliquely, and walked
up University Place. Its heterogeneous passers always allured him—they
were less hurried than in Broadway, less enclosed and classified than in
Fifth Avenue. He walked slowly, watching for his face.

At Union Square he felt a sudden relapse into discouragement, like a
votary who has watched too long for a sign from the altar. Perhaps, after
all, he should never find his face... The air was languid, and he felt
tired. He walked between the bald grass-plots and the twisted trees,
making for an empty seat. Presently he passed a bench on which a girl sat
alone, and something as definite as the twitch of a cord made him stop
before her. He had never dreamed of telling his story to a girl, had
hardly looked at the womenï¿½s faces as they passed. His case was manï¿½s
work: how could a woman help him? But this girlï¿½s face was extraordinary—quiet
and wide as a clear evening sky. It suggested a hundred images of space,
distance, mystery, like ships he had seen, as a boy, quietly berthed by a
familiar wharf, but with the breath of far seas and strange harbours in
their shrouds... Certainly this girl would understand. He went up to her
quietly, lifting his hat, observing the forms—wishing her to see at
once that he was ï¿½a gentleman.ï¿½

ï¿½I am a stranger to you,ï¿½ he began, sitting down beside her, ï¿½but your
face is so extremely intelligent that I feel... I feel it is the face Iï¿½ve
waited for... looked for everywhere; and I want to tell you—ï¿½

The girlï¿½s eyes widened: she rose to her feet. She was escaping him!

In his dismay he ran a few steps after her, and caught her roughly by the
arm.

ï¿½Here—wait—listen! Oh, donï¿½t scream, you fool!ï¿½ he shouted
out.

He felt a hand on his own arm; turned and confronted a policeman.
Instantly he understood that he was being arrested, and something hard
within him was loosened and ran to tears.

ï¿½Ah, you know—you
know
Iï¿½m guilty!ï¿½

He was conscious that a crowd was forming, and that the girlï¿½s frightened
face had disappeared. But what did he care about her face? It was the
policeman who had really understood him. He turned and followed, the crowd
at his heels...

VII

In the charming place in which he found himself there were so many
sympathetic faces that he felt more than ever convinced of the certainty
of making himself heard.

It was a bad blow, at first, to find that he had not been arrested for
murder; but Ascham, who had come to him at once, explained that he needed
rest, and the time to ï¿½reviewï¿½ his statements; it appeared that
reiteration had made them a little confused and contradictory. To this end
he had willingly acquiesced in his removal to a large quiet establishment,
with an open space and trees about it, where he had found a number of
intelligent companions, some, like himself, engaged in preparing or
reviewing statements of their cases, and others ready to lend an
interested ear to his own recital.

For a time he was content to let himself go on the tranquil current of
this existence; but although his auditors gave him for the most part an
encouraging attention, which, in some, went the length of really brilliant
and helpful suggestion, he gradually felt a recurrence of his old doubts.
Either his hearers were not sincere, or else they had less power to aid
him than they boasted. His interminable conferences resulted in nothing,
and as the benefit of the long rest made itself felt, it produced an
increased mental lucidity which rendered inaction more and more
unbearable. At length he discovered that on certain days visitors from the
outer world were admitted to his retreat; and he wrote out long and
logically constructed relations of his crime, and furtively slipped them
into the hands of these messengers of hope.

This occupation gave him a fresh lease of patience, and he now lived only
to watch for the visitorsï¿½ days, and scan the faces that swept by him like
stars seen and lost in the rifts of a hurrying sky.

Mostly, these faces were strange and less intelligent than those of his
companions. But they represented his last means of access to the world, a
kind of subterranean channel on which he could set his ï¿½statementsï¿½
afloat, like paper boats which the mysterious current might sweep out into
the open seas of life.

One day, however, his attention was arrested by a familiar contour, a pair
of bright prominent eyes, and a chin insufficiently shaved. He sprang up
and stood in the path of Peter McCarren.

The journalist looked at him doubtfully, then held out his hand with a
startled deprecating, ï¿½
Why
—?ï¿½

ï¿½You didnï¿½t know me? Iï¿½m so changed?ï¿½ Granice faltered, feeling the
rebound of the otherï¿½s wonder.

ï¿½Why, no; but youï¿½re looking quieter—smoothed out,ï¿½ McCarren smiled.

ï¿½Yes: thatï¿½s what Iï¿½m here for—to rest. And Iï¿½ve taken the
opportunity to write out a clearer statement—ï¿½

Graniceï¿½s hand shook so that he could hardly draw the folded paper from
his pocket. As he did so he noticed that the reporter was accompanied by a
tall man with grave compassionate eyes. It came to Granice in a wild
thrill of conviction that this was the face he had waited for...

ï¿½Perhaps your friend—he
is
your friend?—would glance over it—or
I could put the case in a few words if you have time?ï¿½ Graniceï¿½s voice
shook like his hand. If this chance escaped him he felt that his last hope
was gone. McCarren and the stranger looked at each other, and the former
glanced at his watch.

ï¿½Iï¿½m sorry we canï¿½t stay and talk it over now, Mr. Granice; but my friend
has an engagement, and weï¿½re rather pressed—ï¿½

Granice continued to proffer the paper. ï¿½Iï¿½m sorry—I think I could
have explained. But youï¿½ll take this, at any rate?ï¿½

The stranger looked at him gently. ï¿½Certainly—Iï¿½ll take it.ï¿½ He had
his hand out. ï¿½Good-bye.ï¿½

ï¿½Good-bye,ï¿½ Granice echoed.

He stood watching the two men move away from him through the long light
hall; and as he watched them a tear ran down his face. But as soon as they
were out of sight he turned and walked hastily toward his room, beginning
to hope again, already planning a new statement.

Outside the building the two men stood still, and the journalistï¿½s
companion looked up curiously at the long monotonous rows of barred
windows.

ï¿½So that was Granice?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes—that was Granice, poor devil,ï¿½ said McCarren.

ï¿½Strange case! I suppose thereï¿½s never been one just like it? Heï¿½s still
absolutely convinced that he committed that murder?ï¿½

ï¿½Absolutely. Yes.ï¿½

The stranger reflected. ï¿½And there was no conceivable ground for the idea?
No one could make out how it started? A quiet conventional sort of fellow
like that—where do you suppose he got such a delusion? Did you ever
get the least clue to it?ï¿½

McCarren stood still, his hands in his pockets, his head cocked up in
contemplation of the barred windows. Then he turned his bright hard gaze
on his companion.

ï¿½That was the queer part of it. Iï¿½ve never spoken of it—but I
did

get a clue.ï¿½

ï¿½By Jove! Thatï¿½s interesting. What was it?ï¿½

McCarren formed his red lips into a whistle. ï¿½Why—that it wasnï¿½t a
delusion.ï¿½

He produced his effect—the other turned on him with a pallid stare.

ï¿½He murdered the man all right. I tumbled on the truth by the merest
accident, when Iï¿½d pretty nearly chucked the whole job.ï¿½

ï¿½He murdered him—murdered his cousin?ï¿½

ï¿½Sure as you live. Only donï¿½t split on me. Itï¿½s about the queerest
business I ever ran into...
Do about it
? Why, what was I to do? I couldnï¿½t
hang the poor devil, could I? Lord, but I was glad when they collared him,
and had him stowed away safe in there!ï¿½

The tall man listened with a grave face, grasping Graniceï¿½s statement in
his hand.

ï¿½Here—take this; it makes me sick,ï¿½ he said abruptly, thrusting the
paper at the reporter; and the two men turned and walked in silence to the
gates.

The End

THE DILETTANTE

As first published in Harperï¿½s Monthly, December 1903

It was on an impulse hardly needing the arguments he found himself
advancing in its favor, that Thursdale, on his way to the club, turned as
usual into Mrs. Vervainï¿½s street.

The ï¿½as usualï¿½ was his own qualification of the act; a convenient way of
bridging the interval—in days and other sequences—that lay
between this visit and the last. It was characteristic of him that he
instinctively excluded his call two days earlier, with Ruth Gaynor, from
the list of his visits to Mrs. Vervain: the special conditions attending
it had made it no more like a visit to Mrs. Vervain than an engraved
dinner invitation is like a personal letter. Yet it was to talk over his
call with Miss Gaynor that he was now returning to the scene of that
episode; and it was because Mrs. Vervain could be trusted to handle the
talking over as skilfully as the interview itself that, at her corner, he
had felt the dilettanteï¿½s irresistible craving to take a last look at a
work of art that was passing out of his possession.

On the whole, he knew no one better fitted to deal with the unexpected
than Mrs. Vervain. She excelled in the rare art of taking things for
granted, and Thursdale felt a pardonable pride in the thought that she
owed her excellence to his training. Early in his career Thursdale had
made the mistake, at the outset of his acquaintance with a lady, of
telling her that he loved her and exacting the same avowal in return. The
latter part of that episode had been like the long walk back from a
picnic, when one has to carry all the crockery one has finished using: it
was the last time Thursdale ever allowed himself to be encumbered with the
debris of a feast. He thus incidentally learned that the privilege of
loving her is one of the least favors that a charming woman can accord;
and in seeking to avoid the pitfalls of sentiment he had developed a
science of evasion in which the woman of the moment became a mere
implement of the game. He owed a great deal of delicate enjoyment to the
cultivation of this art. The perils from which it had been his refuge
became naively harmless: was it possible that he who now took his easy way
along the levels had once preferred to gasp on the raw heights of emotion?
Youth is a high-colored season; but he had the satisfaction of feeling
that he had entered earlier than most into that chiarï¿½oscuro of sensation
where every half-tone has its value.

As a promoter of this pleasure no one he had known was comparable to Mrs.
Vervain. He had taught a good many women not to betray their feelings, but
he had never before had such fine material to work in. She had been
surprisingly crude when he first knew her; capable of making the most
awkward inferences, of plunging through thin ice, of recklessly undressing
her emotions; but she had acquired, under the discipline of his reticences
and evasions, a skill almost equal to his own, and perhaps more remarkable
in that it involved keeping time with any tune he played and reading at
sight some uncommonly difficult passages.

It had taken Thursdale seven years to form this fine talent; but the
result justified the effort. At the crucial moment she had been perfect:
her way of greeting Miss Gaynor had made him regret that he had announced
his engagement by letter. It was an evasion that confessed a difficulty; a
deviation implying an obstacle, where, by common consent, it was agreed to
see none; it betrayed, in short, a lack of confidence in the completeness
of his method. It had been his pride never to put himself in a position
which had to be quitted, as it were, by the back door; but here, as he
perceived, the main portals would have opened for him of their own accord.
All this, and much more, he read in the finished naturalness with which
Mrs. Vervain had met Miss Gaynor. He had never seen a better piece of
work: there was no over-eagerness, no suspicious warmth, above all (and
this gave her art the grace of a natural quality) there were none of those
damnable implications whereby a woman, in welcoming her friendï¿½s
betrothed, may keep him on pins and needles while she laps the lady in
complacency. So masterly a performance, indeed, hardly needed the offset
of Miss Gaynorï¿½s door-step words—ï¿½To be so kind to me, how she must
have liked you!ï¿½—though he caught himself wishing it lay within the
bounds of fitness to transmit them, as a final tribute, to the one woman
he knew who was unfailingly certain to enjoy a good thing. It was perhaps
the one drawback to his new situation that it might develop good things
which it would be impossible to hand on to Margaret Vervain.

The fact that he had made the mistake of underrating his friendï¿½s powers,
the consciousness that his writing must have betrayed his distrust of her
efficiency, seemed an added reason for turning down her street instead of
going on to the club. He would show her that he knew how to value her; he
would ask her to achieve with him a feat infinitely rarer and more
delicate than the one he had appeared to avoid. Incidentally, he would
also dispose of the interval of time before dinner: ever since he had seen
Miss Gaynor off, an hour earlier, on her return journey to Buffalo, he had
been wondering how he should put in the rest of the afternoon. It was
absurd, how he missed the girl.... Yes, that was it; the desire to talk
about her was, after all, at the bottom of his impulse to call on Mrs.
Vervain! It was absurd, if you like—but it was delightfully
rejuvenating. He could recall the time when he had been afraid of being
obvious: now he felt that this return to the primitive emotions might be
as restorative as a holiday in the Canadian woods. And it was precisely by
the girlï¿½s candor, her directness, her lack of complications, that he was
taken. The sense that she might say something rash at any moment was
positively exhilarating: if she had thrown her arms about him at the
station he would not have given a thought to his crumpled dignity. It
surprised Thursdale to find what freshness of heart he brought to the
adventure; and though his sense of irony prevented his ascribing his
intactness to any conscious purpose, he could but rejoice in the fact that
his sentimental economies had left him such a large surplus to draw upon.

Mrs. Vervain was at home—as usual. When one visits the cemetery one
expects to find the angel on the tombstone, and it struck Thursdale as
another proof of his friendï¿½s good taste that she had been in no undue
haste to change her habits. The whole house appeared to count on his
coming; the footman took his hat and overcoat as naturally as though there
had been no lapse in his visits; and the drawing-room at once enveloped
him in that atmosphere of tacit intelligence which Mrs. Vervain imparted
to her very furniture.

It was a surprise that, in this general harmony of circumstances, Mrs.
Vervain should herself sound the first false note.

ï¿½You?ï¿½ she exclaimed; and the book she held slipped from her hand.

It was crude, certainly; unless it were a touch of the finest art. The
difficulty of classifying it disturbed Thursdaleï¿½s balance.

ï¿½Why not?ï¿½ he said, restoring the book. ï¿½Isnï¿½t it my hour?ï¿½ And as she
made no answer, he added gently, ï¿½Unless itï¿½s some one elseï¿½s?ï¿½

She laid the book aside and sank back into her chair. ï¿½Mine, merely,ï¿½ she
said.

ï¿½I hope that doesnï¿½t mean that youï¿½re unwilling to share it?ï¿½

ï¿½With you? By no means. Youï¿½re welcome to my last crust.ï¿½

He looked at her reproachfully. ï¿½Do you call this the last?ï¿½

She smiled as he dropped into the seat across the hearth. ï¿½Itï¿½s a way of
giving it more flavor!ï¿½

He returned the smile. ï¿½A visit to you doesnï¿½t need such condiments.ï¿½

She took this with just the right measure of retrospective amusement.

ï¿½Ah, but I want to put into this one a very special taste,ï¿½ she confessed.

Her smile was so confident, so reassuring, that it lulled him into the
imprudence of saying, ï¿½Why should you want it to be different from what
was always so perfectly right?ï¿½

She hesitated. ï¿½Doesnï¿½t the fact that itï¿½s the last constitute a
difference?ï¿½

ï¿½The last—my last visit to you?ï¿½

ï¿½Oh, metaphorically, I mean—thereï¿½s a break in the continuity.ï¿½

Decidedly, she was pressing too hard: unlearning his arts already!

ï¿½I donï¿½t recognize it,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½Unless you make me—ï¿½ he added,
with a note that slightly stirred her attitude of languid attention.

She turned to him with grave eyes. ï¿½You recognize no difference whatever?ï¿½

ï¿½None—except an added link in the chain.ï¿½

ï¿½An added link?ï¿½

ï¿½In having one more thing to like you for—your letting Miss Gaynor
see why I had already so many.ï¿½ He flattered himself that this turn had
taken the least hint of fatuity from the phrase.

Mrs. Vervain sank into her former easy pose. ï¿½Was it that you came for?ï¿½
she asked, almost gaily.

ï¿½If it is necessary to have a reason—that was one.ï¿½

ï¿½To talk to me about Miss Gaynor?ï¿½

ï¿½To tell you how she talks about you.ï¿½

ï¿½That will be very interesting—especially if you have seen her since
her second visit to me.ï¿½

ï¿½Her second visit?ï¿½ Thursdale pushed his chair back with a start and moved
to another. ï¿½She came to see you again?ï¿½

ï¿½This morning, yes—by appointment.ï¿½

He continued to look at her blankly. ï¿½You sent for her?ï¿½

ï¿½I didnï¿½t have to—she wrote and asked me last night. But no doubt
you have seen her since.ï¿½

Thursdale sat silent. He was trying to separate his words from his
thoughts, but they still clung together inextricably. ï¿½I saw her off just
now at the station.ï¿½

ï¿½And she didnï¿½t tell you that she had been here again?ï¿½

ï¿½There was hardly time, I suppose—there were people about—ï¿½ he
floundered.

ï¿½Ah, sheï¿½ll write, then.ï¿½

He regained his composure. ï¿½Of course sheï¿½ll write: very often, I hope.
You know Iï¿½m absurdly in love,ï¿½ he cried audaciously.

She tilted her head back, looking up at him as he leaned against the
chimney-piece. He had leaned there so often that the attitude touched a
pulse which set up a throbbing in her throat. ï¿½Oh, my poor Thursdale!ï¿½ she
murmured.

ï¿½I suppose itï¿½s rather ridiculous,ï¿½ he owned; and as she remained silent,
he added, with a sudden break—ï¿½Or have you another reason for
pitying me?ï¿½

Her answer was another question. ï¿½Have you been back to your rooms since
you left her?ï¿½

ï¿½Since I left her at the station? I came straight here.ï¿½

ï¿½Ah, yes—you
could
: there was no reason—ï¿½ Her words passed
into a silent musing.

Thursdale moved nervously nearer. ï¿½You said you had something to tell me?ï¿½

ï¿½Perhaps I had better let her do so. There may be a letter at your rooms.ï¿½

ï¿½A letter? What do you mean? A letter from
her
? What has happened?ï¿½

His paleness shook her, and she raised a hand of reassurance. ï¿½Nothing has
happened—perhaps that is just the worst of it. You always
hated
, you
know,ï¿½ she added incoherently, ï¿½to have things happen: you never would let
them.ï¿½

ï¿½And now—?ï¿½

ï¿½Well, that was what she came here for: I supposed you had guessed. To
know if anything had happened.ï¿½

ï¿½Had happened?ï¿½ He gazed at her slowly. ï¿½Between you and me?ï¿½ he said with
a rush of light.

The words were so much cruder than any that had ever passed between them
that the color rose to her face; but she held his startled gaze.

ï¿½You know girls are not quite as unsophisticated as they used to be. Are
you surprised that such an idea should occur to her?ï¿½

His own color answered hers: it was the only reply that came to him.

Mrs. Vervain went on, smoothly: ï¿½I supposed it might have struck you that
there were times when we presented that appearance.ï¿½

He made an impatient gesture. ï¿½A manï¿½s past is his own!ï¿½

ï¿½Perhaps—it certainly never belongs to the woman who has shared it.
But one learns such truths only by experience; and Miss Gaynor is
naturally inexperienced.ï¿½

ï¿½Of course—but—supposing her act a natural one—ï¿½ he
floundered lamentably among his innuendoes—ï¿½I still donï¿½t see—how
there was anything—ï¿½

ï¿½Anything to take hold of? There wasnï¿½t—ï¿½

ï¿½Well, then—?ï¿½ escaped him, in crude satisfaction; but as she did
not complete the sentence he went on with a faltering laugh: ï¿½She can
hardly object to the existence of a mere friendship between us!ï¿½

ï¿½But she does,ï¿½ said Mrs. Vervain.

Thursdale stood perplexed. He had seen, on the previous day, no trace of
jealousy or resentment in his betrothed: he could still hear the candid
ring of the girlï¿½s praise of Mrs. Vervain. If she were such an abyss of
insincerity as to dissemble distrust under such frankness, she must at
least be more subtle than to bring her doubts to her rival for solution.
The situation seemed one through which one could no longer move in a
penumbra, and he let in a burst of light with the direct query: ï¿½Wonï¿½t you
explain what you mean?ï¿½

Mrs. Vervain sat silent, not provokingly, as though to prolong his
distress, but as if, in the attenuated phraseology he had taught her, it
was difficult to find words robust enough to meet his challenge. It was
the first time he had ever asked her to explain anything; and she had
lived so long in dread of offering elucidations which were not wanted,
that she seemed unable to produce one on the spot.

At last she said slowly: ï¿½She came to find out if you were really free.ï¿½

Thursdale colored again. ï¿½Free?ï¿½ he stammered, with a sense of physical
disgust at contact with such crassness.

ï¿½Yes—if I had quite done with you.ï¿½ She smiled in recovered
security. ï¿½It seems she likes clear outlines; she has a passion for
definitions.ï¿½

ï¿½Yes—well?ï¿½ he said, wincing at the echo of his own subtlety.

ï¿½Well—and when I told her that you had never belonged to me, she
wanted me to define
my
status—to know exactly where I had stood all
along.ï¿½

Thursdale sat gazing at her intently; his hand was not yet on the clue.
ï¿½And even when you had told her that—ï¿½

ï¿½Even when I had told her that I had
had
no status—that I had never
stood anywhere, in any sense she meant,ï¿½ said Mrs. Vervain, slowly—ï¿½even
then she wasnï¿½t satisfied, it seems.ï¿½

He uttered an uneasy exclamation. ï¿½She didnï¿½t believe you, you mean?ï¿½

ï¿½I mean that she
did
believe me: too thoroughly.ï¿½

ï¿½Well, then—in Godï¿½s name, what did she want?ï¿½

ï¿½Something more—those were the words she used.ï¿½

ï¿½Something more? Between—between you and me? Is it a conundrum?ï¿½ He
laughed awkwardly.

ï¿½Girls are not what they were in my day; they are no longer forbidden to
contemplate the relation of the sexes.ï¿½

ï¿½So it seems!ï¿½ he commented. ï¿½But since, in this case, there wasnï¿½t any—ï¿½
he broke off, catching the dawn of a revelation in her gaze.

ï¿½Thatï¿½s just it. The unpardonable offence has been—in our not
offending.ï¿½

He flung himself down despairingly. ï¿½I give it up!—What did you tell
her?ï¿½ he burst out with sudden crudeness.

ï¿½The exact truth. If I had only known,ï¿½ she broke off with a beseeching
tenderness, ï¿½wonï¿½t you believe that I would still have lied for you?ï¿½

ï¿½Lied for me? Why on earth should you have lied for either of us?ï¿½

ï¿½To save you—to hide you from her to the last! As Iï¿½ve hidden you
from myself all these years!ï¿½ She stood up with a sudden tragic import in
her movement. ï¿½You believe me capable of that, donï¿½t you? If I had only
guessed—but I have never known a girl like her; she had the truth
out of me with a spring.ï¿½

ï¿½The truth that you and I had never—ï¿½

ï¿½Had never—never in all these years! Oh, she knew why—she
measured us both in a flash. She didnï¿½t suspect me of having haggled with
you—her words pelted me like hail. ï¿½He just took what he wanted—sifted
and sorted you to suit his taste. Burnt out the gold and left a heap of
cinders. And you let him—you let yourself be cut in bitsï¿½—she
mixed her metaphors a little—ï¿½be cut in bits, and used or discarded,
while all the while every drop of blood in you belonged to him! But heï¿½s
Shylock—and you have bled to death of the pound of flesh he has cut
out of you.ï¿½ But she despises me the most, you know—far the most—ï¿½
Mrs. Vervain ended.

The words fell strangely on the scented stillness of the room: they seemed
out of harmony with its setting of afternoon intimacy, the kind of
intimacy on which at any moment, a visitor might intrude without
perceptibly lowering the atmosphere. It was as though a grand opera-singer
had strained the acoustics of a private music-room.

Thursdale stood up, facing his hostess. Half the room was between them,
but they seemed to stare close at each other now that the veils of
reticence and ambiguity had fallen.

His first words were characteristic. ï¿½She
does
despise me, then?ï¿½ he
exclaimed.

ï¿½She thinks the pound of flesh you took was a little too near the heart.ï¿½

He was excessively pale. ï¿½Please tell me exactly what she said of me.ï¿½

ï¿½She did not speak much of you: she is proud. But I gather that while she
understands love or indifference, her eyes have never been opened to the
many intermediate shades of feeling. At any rate, she expressed an
unwillingness to be taken with reservations—she thinks you would
have loved her better if you had loved some one else first. The point of
view is original—she insists on a man with a past!ï¿½

ï¿½Oh, a past—if sheï¿½s serious—I could rake up a past!ï¿½ he said
with a laugh.

ï¿½So I suggested: but she has her eyes on this particular portion of it. She
insists on making it a test case. She wanted to know what you had done to
me; and before I could guess her drift I blundered into telling her.ï¿½

Thursdale drew a difficult breath. ï¿½I never supposed—your revenge is
complete,ï¿½ he said slowly.

He heard a little gasp in her throat. ï¿½My revenge? When I sent for you to
warn you—to save you from being surprised as I was surprised?ï¿½

ï¿½Youï¿½re very good—but itï¿½s rather late to talk of saving me.ï¿½ He
held out his hand in the mechanical gesture of leave-taking.

ï¿½How you must care!—for I never saw you so dull,ï¿½ was her answer.
ï¿½Donï¿½t you see that itï¿½s not too late for me to help you?ï¿½ And as he
continued to stare, she brought out sublimely: ï¿½Take the rest—in
imagination! Let it at least be of that much use to you. Tell her I lied
to her—sheï¿½s too ready to believe it! And so, after all, in a sense,
I shaï¿½nï¿½t have been wasted.ï¿½

His stare hung on her, widening to a kind of wonder. She gave the look
back brightly, unblushingly, as though the expedient were too simple to
need oblique approaches. It was extraordinary how a few words had swept
them from an atmosphere of the most complex dissimulations to this contact
of naked souls.

It was not in Thursdale to expand with the pressure of fate; but something
in him cracked with it, and the rift let in new light. He went up to his
friend and took her hand.

ï¿½You would do it—you would do it!ï¿½

She looked at him, smiling, but her hand shook.

ï¿½Good-by,ï¿½ he said, kissing it.

ï¿½Good-by? You are going—?ï¿½

ï¿½To get my letter.ï¿½

ï¿½Your letter? The letter wonï¿½t matter, if you will only do what I ask.ï¿½

He returned her gaze. ï¿½I might, I suppose, without being out of character.
Only, donï¿½t you see that if your plan helped me it could only harm her?ï¿½

ï¿½Harm
her
?ï¿½

ï¿½To sacrifice you wouldnï¿½t make me different. I shall go on being what I
have always been—sifting and sorting, as she calls it. Do you want
my punishment to fall on
her
?ï¿½

She looked at him long and deeply. ï¿½Ah, if I had to choose between you—!ï¿½

ï¿½You would let her take her chance? But I canï¿½t, you see. I must take my
punishment alone.ï¿½

She drew her hand away, sighing. ï¿½Oh, there will be no punishment for
either of you.ï¿½

ï¿½For either of us? There will be the reading of her letter for me.ï¿½

She shook her head with a slight laugh. ï¿½There will be no letter.ï¿½

Thursdale faced about from the threshold with fresh life in his look. ï¿½No
letter? You donï¿½t mean—ï¿½

ï¿½I mean that sheï¿½s been with you since I saw her—sheï¿½s seen you and
heard your voice. If there
is
a letter, she has recalled it—from the
first station, by telegraph.ï¿½

He turned back to the door, forcing an answer to her smile. ï¿½But in the
mean while I shall have read it,ï¿½ he said.

The door closed on him, and she hid her eyes from the dreadful emptiness
of the room.

The End

THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD HAND

As first published in Atlantic Monthly, August 1904

I

ï¿½Above all,ï¿½ the letter ended, ï¿½donï¿½t leave Siena without seeing Doctor
Lombardï¿½s Leonardo. Lombard is a queer old Englishman, a mystic or a
madman (if the two are not synonymous), and a devout student of the
Italian Renaissance. He has lived for years in Italy, exploring its
remotest corners, and has lately picked up an undoubted Leonardo, which
came to light in a farmhouse near Bergamo. It is believed to be one of the
missing pictures mentioned by Vasari, and is at any rate, according to the
most competent authorities, a genuine and almost untouched example of the
best period.

ï¿½Lombard is a queer stick, and jealous of showing his treasures; but we
struck up a friendship when I was working on the Sodomas in Siena three
years ago, and if you will give him the enclosed line you may get a peep
at the Leonardo. Probably not more than a peep, though, for I hear he
refuses to have it reproduced. I want badly to use it in my monograph on
the Windsor drawings, so please see what you can do for me, and if you
canï¿½t persuade him to let you take a photograph or make a sketch, at least
jot down a detailed description of the picture and get from him all the
facts you can. I hear that the French and Italian governments have offered
him a large advance on his purchase, but that he refuses to sell at any
price, though he certainly canï¿½t afford such luxuries; in fact, I donï¿½t
see where he got enough money to buy the picture. He lives in the Via Papa
Giulio.ï¿½

Wyant sat at the table dï¿½hote of his hotel, re-reading his friendï¿½s letter
over a late luncheon. He had been five days in Siena without having found
time to call on Doctor Lombard; not from any indifference to the
opportunity presented, but because it was his first visit to the strange
red city and he was still under the spell of its more conspicuous wonders—the
brick palaces flinging out their wrought-iron torch-holders with a gesture
of arrogant suzerainty; the great council-chamber emblazoned with civic
allegories; the pageant of Pope Julius on the Library walls; the Sodomas
smiling balefully through the dusk of mouldering chapels—and it was
only when his first hunger was appeased that he remembered that one course
in the banquet was still untasted.

He put the letter in his pocket and turned to leave the room, with a nod
to its only other occupant, an olive-skinned young man with lustrous eyes
and a low collar, who sat on the other side of the table, perusing the

Fanfulla di Domenica
. This gentleman, his daily vis-a-vis, returned the
nod with a Latin eloquence of gesture, and Wyant passed on to the
ante-chamber, where he paused to light a cigarette. He was just restoring
the case to his pocket when he heard a hurried step behind him, and the
lustrous-eyed young man advanced through the glass doors of the
dining-room.

ï¿½Pardon me, sir,ï¿½ he said in measured English, and with an intonation of
exquisite politeness; ï¿½you have let this letter fall.ï¿½

Wyant, recognizing his friendï¿½s note of introduction to Doctor Lombard,
took it with a word of thanks, and was about to turn away when he
perceived that the eyes of his fellow diner remained fixed on him with a
gaze of melancholy interrogation.

ï¿½Again pardon me,ï¿½ the young man at length ventured, ï¿½but are you by
chance the friend of the illustrious Doctor Lombard?ï¿½

ï¿½No,ï¿½ returned Wyant, with the instinctive Anglo-Saxon distrust of foreign
advances. Then, fearing to appear rude, he said with a guarded politeness:
ï¿½Perhaps, by the way, you can tell me the number of his house. I see it is
not given here.ï¿½

The young man brightened perceptibly. ï¿½The number of the house is
thirteen; but any one can indicate it to you—it is well known in
Siena. It is called,ï¿½ he continued after a moment, ï¿½the House of the Dead
Hand.ï¿½

Wyant stared. ï¿½What a queer name!ï¿½ he said.

ï¿½The name comes from an antique hand of marble which for many hundred
years has been above the door.ï¿½

Wyant was turning away with a gesture of thanks, when the other added: ï¿½If
you would have the kindness to ring twice.ï¿½

ï¿½To ring twice?ï¿½

ï¿½At the doctorï¿½s.ï¿½ The young man smiled. ï¿½It is the custom.ï¿½

It was a dazzling March afternoon, with a shower of sun from the mid-blue,
and a marshalling of slaty clouds behind the umber-colored hills. For
nearly an hour Wyant loitered on the Lizza, watching the shadows race
across the naked landscape and the thunder blacken in the west; then he
decided to set out for the House of the Dead Hand. The map in his
guidebook showed him that the Via Papa Giulio was one of the streets which
radiate from the Piazza, and thither he bent his course, pausing at every
other step to fill his eye with some fresh image of weather-beaten beauty.
The clouds had rolled upward, obscuring the sunshine and hanging like a
funereal baldachin above the projecting cornices of Doctor Lombardï¿½s
street, and Wyant walked for some distance in the shade of the beetling
palace fronts before his eye fell on a doorway surmounted by a sallow
marble hand. He stood for a moment staring up at the strange emblem. The
hand was a womanï¿½s—a dead drooping hand, which hung there convulsed
and helpless, as though it had been thrust forth in denunciation of some
evil mystery within the house, and had sunk struggling into death.

A girl who was drawing water from the well in the court said that the
English doctor lived on the first floor, and Wyant, passing through a
glazed door, mounted the damp degrees of a vaulted stairway with a plaster
ï¿½sculapius mouldering in a niche on the landing. Facing the ï¿½sculapius
was another door, and as Wyant put his hand on the bell-rope he remembered
his unknown friendï¿½s injunction, and rang twice.

His ring was answered by a peasant woman with a low forehead and small
close-set eyes, who, after a prolonged scrutiny of himself, his card, and
his letter of introduction, left him standing in a high, cold ante-chamber
floored with brick. He heard her wooden pattens click down an interminable
corridor, and after some delay she returned and told him to follow her.

They passed through a long saloon, bare as the ante-chamber, but loftily
vaulted, and frescoed with a seventeenth-century Triumph of Scipio or
Alexander—martial figures following Wyant with the filmed melancholy
gaze of shades in limbo. At the end of this apartment he was admitted to a
smaller room, with the same atmosphere of mortal cold, but showing more
obvious signs of occupancy. The walls were covered with tapestry which had
faded to the gray-brown tints of decaying vegetation, so that the young
man felt as though he were entering a sunless autumn wood. Against these
hangings stood a few tall cabinets on heavy gilt feet, and at a table in
the window three persons were seated: an elderly lady who was warming her
hands over a brazier, a girl bent above a strip of needle-work, and an old
man.

As the latter advanced toward Wyant, the young man was conscious of
staring with unseemly intentness at his small round-backed figure, dressed
with shabby disorder and surmounted by a wonderful head, lean, vulpine,
eagle-beaked as that of some art-loving despot of the Renaissance: a head
combining the venerable hair and large prominent eyes of the humanist with
the greedy profile of the adventurer. Wyant, in musing on the Italian
portrait-medals of the fifteenth century, had often fancied that only in
that period of fierce individualism could types so paradoxical have been
produced; yet the subtle craftsmen who committed them to the bronze had
never drawn a face more strangely stamped with contradictory passions than
that of Doctor Lombard.

ï¿½I am glad to see you,ï¿½ he said to Wyant, extending a hand which seemed a
mere framework held together by knotted veins. ï¿½We lead a quiet life here
and receive few visitors, but any friend of Professor Clydeï¿½s is welcome.ï¿½
Then, with a gesture which included the two women, he added dryly: ï¿½My
wife and daughter often talk of Professor Clyde.ï¿½

ï¿½Oh yes—he used to make me such nice toast; they donï¿½t understand
toast in Italy,ï¿½ said Mrs. Lombard in a high plaintive voice.

It would have been difficult, from Doctor Lombardï¿½s manner and appearance
to guess his nationality; but his wife was so inconsciently and
ineradicably English that even the silhouette of her cap seemed a protest
against Continental laxities. She was a stout fair woman, with pale cheeks
netted with red lines. A brooch with a miniature portrait sustained a
bogwood watch-chain upon her bosom, and at her elbow lay a heap of
knitting and an old copy of
The Queen
.

The young girl, who had remained standing, was a slim replica of her
mother, with an apple-cheeked face and opaque blue eyes. Her small head
was prodigally laden with braids of dull fair hair, and she might have had
a kind of transient prettiness but for the sullen droop of her round
mouth. It was hard to say whether her expression implied ill-temper or
apathy; but Wyant was struck by the contrast between the fierce vitality
of the doctorï¿½s age and the inanimateness of his daughterï¿½s youth.

Seating himself in the chair which his host advanced, the young man tried
to open the conversation by addressing to Mrs. Lombard some random remark
on the beauties of Siena. The lady murmured a resigned assent, and Doctor
Lombard interposed with a smile: ï¿½My dear sir, my wife considers Siena a
most salubrious spot, and is favorably impressed by the cheapness of the
marketing; but she deplores the total absence of muffins and cannel coal,
and cannot resign herself to the Italian method of dusting furniture.ï¿½

ï¿½But they donï¿½t, you know—they donï¿½t dust it!ï¿½ Mrs. Lombard
protested, without showing any resentment of her husbandï¿½s manner.

ï¿½Precisely—they donï¿½t dust it. Since we have lived in Siena we have
not once seen the cobwebs removed from the battlements of the Mangia. Can
you conceive of such housekeeping? My wife has never yet dared to write it
home to her aunts at Bonchurch.ï¿½

Mrs. Lombard accepted in silence this remarkable statement of her views,
and her husband, with a malicious smile at Wyantï¿½s embarrassment, planted
himself suddenly before the young man.

ï¿½And now,ï¿½ said he, ï¿½do you want to see my Leonardo?ï¿½

ï¿½
Do I
?ï¿½ cried Wyant, on his feet in a flash.

The doctor chuckled. ï¿½Ah,ï¿½ he said, with a kind of crooning deliberation,
ï¿½thatï¿½s the way they all behave—thatï¿½s what they all come for.ï¿½ He
turned to his daughter with another variation of mockery in his smile.
ï¿½Donï¿½t fancy itï¿½s for your
beaux yeux
, my dear; or for the mature charms
of Mrs. Lombard,ï¿½ he added, glaring suddenly at his wife, who had taken up
her knitting and was softly murmuring over the number of her stitches.

Neither lady appeared to notice his pleasantries, and he continued,
addressing himself to Wyant: ï¿½They all come—they all come; but many
are called and few are chosen.ï¿½ His voice sank to solemnity. ï¿½While I
live,ï¿½ he said, ï¿½no unworthy eye shall desecrate that picture. But I will
not do my friend Clyde the injustice to suppose that he would send an
unworthy representative. He tells me he wishes a description of the
picture for his book; and you shall describe it to him—if you can.ï¿½

Wyant hesitated, not knowing whether it was a propitious moment to put in
his appeal for a photograph.

ï¿½Well, sir,ï¿½ he said, ï¿½you know Clyde wants me to take away all I can of
it.ï¿½

Doctor Lombard eyed him sardonically. ï¿½Youï¿½re welcome to take away all you
can carry,ï¿½ he replied; adding, as he turned to his daughter: ï¿½That is, if
he has your permission, Sybilla.ï¿½

The girl rose without a word, and laying aside her work, took a key from a
secret drawer in one of the cabinets, while the doctor continued in the
same note of grim jocularity: ï¿½For you must know that the picture is not
mine—it is my daughterï¿½s.ï¿½

He followed with evident amusement the surprised glance which Wyant turned
on the young girlï¿½s impassive figure.

ï¿½Sybilla,ï¿½ he pursued, ï¿½is a votary of the arts; she has inherited her
fond fatherï¿½s passion for the unattainable. Luckily, however, she also
recently inherited a tidy legacy from her grandmother; and having seen the
Leonardo, on which its discoverer had placed a price far beyond my reach,
she took a step which deserves to go down to history: she invested her
whole inheritance in the purchase of the picture, thus enabling me to
spend my closing years in communion with one of the worldï¿½s masterpieces.
My dear sir, could Antigone do more?ï¿½

The object of this strange eulogy had meanwhile drawn aside one of the
tapestry hangings, and fitted her key into a concealed door.

ï¿½Come,ï¿½ said Doctor Lombard, ï¿½let us go before the light fails us.ï¿½

Wyant glanced at Mrs. Lombard, who continued to knit impassively.

ï¿½No, no,ï¿½ said his host, ï¿½my wife will not come with us. You might not
suspect it from her conversation, but my wife has no feeling for art—Italian
art, that is; for no one is fonder of our early Victorian school.ï¿½

ï¿½Frithï¿½s Railway Station, you know,ï¿½ said Mrs. Lombard, smiling. ï¿½I like
an animated picture.ï¿½

Miss Lombard, who had unlocked the door, held back the tapestry to let her
father and Wyant pass out; then she followed them down a narrow stone
passage with another door at its end. This door was iron-barred, and Wyant
noticed that it had a complicated patent lock. The girl fitted another key
into the lock, and Doctor Lombard led the way into a small room. The dark
panelling of this apartment was irradiated by streams of yellow light
slanting through the disbanded thunder clouds, and in the central
brightness hung a picture concealed by a curtain of faded velvet.

ï¿½A little too bright, Sybilla,ï¿½ said Doctor Lombard. His face had grown
solemn, and his mouth twitched nervously as his daughter drew a linen
drapery across the upper part of the window.

ï¿½That will do—that will do.ï¿½ He turned impressively to Wyant. ï¿½Do
you see the pomegranate bud in this rug? Place yourself there—keep
your left foot on it, please. And now, Sybilla, draw the cord.ï¿½

Miss Lombard advanced and placed her hand on a cord hidden behind the
velvet curtain.

ï¿½Ah,ï¿½ said the doctor, ï¿½one moment: I should like you, while looking at
the picture, to have in mind a few lines of verse. Sybilla—ï¿½

Without the slightest change of countenance, and with a promptness which
proved her to be prepared for the request, Miss Lombard began to recite,
in a full round voice like her motherï¿½s, St. Bernardï¿½s invocation to the
Virgin, in the thirty-third canto of the Paradise.

ï¿½Thank you, my dear,ï¿½ said her father, drawing a deep breath as she ended.
ï¿½That unapproachable combination of vowel sounds prepares one better than
anything I know for the contemplation of the picture.ï¿½

As he spoke the folds of velvet slowly parted, and the Leonardo appeared
in its frame of tarnished gold:

From the nature of Miss Lombardï¿½s recitation Wyant had expected a sacred
subject, and his surprise was therefore great as the composition was
gradually revealed by the widening division of the curtain.

In the background a steel-colored river wound through a pale calcareous
landscape; while to the left, on a lonely peak, a crucified Christ hung
livid against indigo clouds. The central figure of the foreground,
however, was that of a woman seated in an antique chair of marble with
bas-reliefs of dancing mï¿½nads. Her feet rested on a meadow sprinkled with
minute wild-flowers, and her attitude of smiling majesty recalled that of
Dosso Dossiï¿½s Circe. She wore a red robe, flowing in closely fluted lines
from under a fancifully embroidered cloak. Above her high forehead the
crinkled golden hair flowed sideways beneath a veil; one hand drooped on
the arm of her chair; the other held up an inverted human skull, into
which a young Dionysus, smooth, brown and sidelong as the St. John of the
Louvre, poured a stream of wine from a high-poised flagon. At the ladyï¿½s
feet lay the symbols of art and luxury: a flute and a roll of music, a
platter heaped with grapes and roses, the torso of a Greek statuette, and
a bowl overflowing with coins and jewels; behind her, on the chalky
hilltop, hung the crucified Christ. A scroll in a corner of the foreground
bore the legend:
Lux Mundi
.

Wyant, emerging from the first plunge of wonder, turned inquiringly toward
his companions. Neither had moved. Miss Lombard stood with her hand on the
cord, her lids lowered, her mouth drooping; the doctor, his strange
Thoth-like profile turned toward his guest, was still lost in rapt
contemplation of his treasure.

Wyant addressed the young girl.

ï¿½You are fortunate,ï¿½ he said, ï¿½to be the possessor of anything so
perfect.ï¿½

ï¿½It is considered very beautiful,ï¿½ she said coldly.

ï¿½Beautiful—
beautiful
!ï¿½ the doctor burst out. ï¿½Ah, the poor, worn
out, over-worked word! There are no adjectives in the language fresh
enough to describe such pristine brilliancy; all their brightness has been
worn off by misuse. Think of the things that have been called beautiful,
and then look at
that
!ï¿½

ï¿½It is worthy of a new vocabulary,ï¿½ Wyant agreed.

ï¿½Yes,ï¿½ Doctor Lombard continued, ï¿½my daughter is indeed fortunate. She has
chosen what Catholics call the higher life—the counsel of
perfection. What other private person enjoys the same opportunity of
understanding the master? Who else lives under the same roof with an
untouched masterpiece of Leonardoï¿½s? Think of the happiness of being
always under the influence of such a creation; of living
into
it; of
partaking of it in daily and hourly communion! This room is a chapel; the
sight of that picture is a sacrament. What an atmosphere for a young life
to unfold itself in! My daughter is singularly blessed. Sybilla, point out
some of the details to Mr. Wyant; I see that he will appreciate them.ï¿½

The girl turned her dense blue eyes toward Wyant; then, glancing away from
him, she pointed to the canvas.

ï¿½Notice the modeling of the left hand,ï¿½ she began in a monotonous voice;
ï¿½it recalls the hand of the Mona Lisa. The head of the naked genius will
remind you of that of the St. John of the Louvre, but it is more purely
pagan and is turned a little less to the right. The embroidery on the
cloak is symbolic: you will see that the roots of this plant have burst
through the vase. This recalls the famous definition of Hamletï¿½s character
in Wilhelm Meister. Here are the mystic rose, the flame, and the serpent,
emblem of eternity. Some of the other symbols we have not yet been able to
decipher.ï¿½

Wyant watched her curiously; she seemed to be reciting a lesson.

ï¿½And the picture itself?ï¿½ he said. ï¿½How do you explain that?
Lux Mundi
—what
a curious device to connect with such a subject! What can it mean?ï¿½

Miss Lombard dropped her eyes: the answer was evidently not included in
her lesson.

ï¿½What, indeed?ï¿½ the doctor interposed. ï¿½What does life mean? As one may
define it in a hundred different ways, so one may find a hundred different
meanings in this picture. Its symbolism is as many-faceted as a well-cut
diamond. Who, for instance, is that divine lady? Is it she who is the true

Lux Mundi
—the light reflected from jewels and young eyes, from
polished marble and clear waters and statues of bronze? Or is that the
Light of the World, extinguished on yonder stormy hill, and is this lady
the Pride of Life, feasting blindly on the wine of iniquity, with her back
turned to the light which has shone for her in vain? Something of both
these meanings may be traced in the picture; but to me it symbolizes
rather the central truth of existence: that all that is raised in
incorruption is sown in corruption; art, beauty, love, religion; that all
our wine is drunk out of skulls, and poured for us by the mysterious
genius of a remote and cruel past.ï¿½

The doctorï¿½s face blazed: his bent figure seemed to straighten itself and
become taller.

ï¿½Ah,ï¿½ he cried, growing more dithyrambic, ï¿½how lightly you ask what it
means! How confidently you expect an answer! Yet here am I who have given
my life to the study of the Renaissance; who have violated its tomb, laid
open its dead body, and traced the course of every muscle, bone, and
artery; who have sucked its very soul from the pages of poets and
humanists; who have wept and believed with Joachim of Flora, smiled and
doubted with ï¿½neas Sylvius Piccolomini; who have patiently followed to
its source the least inspiration of the masters, and groped in neolithic
caverns and Babylonian ruins for the first unfolding tendrils of the
arabesques of Mantegna and Crivelli; and I tell you that I stand abashed
and ignorant before the mystery of this picture. It means nothing—it
means all things. It may represent the period which saw its creation; it
may represent all ages past and to come. There are volumes of meaning in
the tiniest emblem on the ladyï¿½s cloak; the blossoms of its border are
rooted in the deepest soil of myth and tradition. Donï¿½t ask what it means,
young man, but bow your head in thankfulness for having seen it!ï¿½

Miss Lombard laid her hand on his arm.

ï¿½Donï¿½t excite yourself, father,ï¿½ she said in the detached tone of a
professional nurse.

He answered with a despairing gesture. ï¿½Ah, itï¿½s easy for you to talk. You
have years and years to spend with it; I am an old man, and every moment
counts!ï¿½

ï¿½Itï¿½s bad for you,ï¿½ she repeated with gentle obstinacy.

The doctorï¿½s sacred fury had in fact burnt itself out. He dropped into a
seat with dull eyes and slackening lips, and his daughter drew the curtain
across the picture.

Wyant turned away reluctantly. He felt that his opportunity was slipping
from him, yet he dared not refer to Clydeï¿½s wish for a photograph. He now
understood the meaning of the laugh with which Doctor Lombard had given
him leave to carry away all the details he could remember. The picture was
so dazzling, so unexpected, so crossed with elusive and contradictory
suggestions, that the most alert observer, when placed suddenly before it,
must lose his coordinating faculty in a sense of confused wonder. Yet how
valuable to Clyde the record of such a work would be! In some ways it
seemed to be the summing up of the masterï¿½s thought, the key to his
enigmatic philosophy.

The doctor had risen and was walking slowly toward the door. His daughter
unlocked it, and Wyant followed them back in silence to the room in which
they had left Mrs. Lombard. That lady was no longer there, and he could
think of no excuse for lingering.

He thanked the doctor, and turned to Miss Lombard, who stood in the middle
of the room as though awaiting farther orders.

ï¿½It is very good of you,ï¿½ he said, ï¿½to allow one even a glimpse of such a
treasure.ï¿½

She looked at him with her odd directness. ï¿½You will come again?ï¿½ she said
quickly; and turning to her father she added: ï¿½You know what Professor
Clyde asked. This gentleman cannot give him any account of the picture
without seeing it again.ï¿½

Doctor Lombard glanced at her vaguely; he was still like a person in a
trance.

ï¿½Eh?ï¿½ he said, rousing himself with an effort.

ï¿½I said, father, that Mr. Wyant must see the picture again if he is to
tell Professor Clyde about it,ï¿½ Miss Lombard repeated with extraordinary
precision of tone.

Wyant was silent. He had the puzzled sense that his wishes were being
divined and gratified for reasons with which he was in no way connected.

ï¿½Well, well,ï¿½ the doctor muttered, ï¿½I donï¿½t say no—I donï¿½t say no. I
know what Clyde wants—I donï¿½t refuse to help him.ï¿½ He turned to
Wyant. ï¿½You may come again—you may make notes,ï¿½ he added with a
sudden effort. ï¿½Jot down what occurs to you. Iï¿½m willing to concede that.ï¿½

Wyant again caught the girlï¿½s eye, but its emphatic message perplexed him.

ï¿½Youï¿½re very good,ï¿½ he said tentatively, ï¿½but the fact is the picture is
so mysterious—so full of complicated detail—that Iï¿½m afraid no
notes I could make would serve Clydeï¿½s purpose as well as—as a
photograph, say. If you would allow me—ï¿½

Miss Lombardï¿½s brow darkened, and her father raised his head furiously.

ï¿½A photograph? A photograph, did you say? Good God, man, not ten people
have been allowed to set foot in that room! A
photograph
?ï¿½

Wyant saw his mistake, but saw also that he had gone too far to retreat.

ï¿½I know, sir, from what Clyde has told me, that you object to having any
reproduction of the picture published; but he hoped you might let me take
a photograph for his personal use—not to be reproduced in his book,
but simply to give him something to work by. I should take the photograph
myself, and the negative would of course be yours. If you wished it, only
one impression would be struck off, and that one Clyde could return to you
when he had done with it.ï¿½

Doctor Lombard interrupted him with a snarl. ï¿½When he had done with it?
Just so: I thank thee for that word! When it had been re-photographed,
drawn, traced, autotyped, passed about from hand to hand, defiled by every
ignorant eye in England, vulgarized by the blundering praise of every
art-scribbler in Europe! Bah! Iï¿½d as soon give you the picture itself: why
donï¿½t you ask for that?ï¿½

ï¿½Well, sir,ï¿½ said Wyant calmly, ï¿½if you will trust me with it, Iï¿½ll engage
to take it safely to England and back, and to let no eye but Clydeï¿½s see
it while it is out of your keeping.ï¿½

The doctor received this remarkable proposal in silence; then he burst
into a laugh.

ï¿½Upon my soul!ï¿½ he said with sardonic good humor.

It was Miss Lombardï¿½s turn to look perplexedly at Wyant. His last words
and her fatherï¿½s unexpected reply had evidently carried her beyond her
depth.

ï¿½Well, sir, am I to take the picture?ï¿½ Wyant smilingly pursued.

ï¿½No, young man; nor a photograph of it. Nor a sketch, either; mind that,—nothing
that can be reproduced. Sybilla,ï¿½ he cried with sudden passion, ï¿½swear to
me that the picture shall never be reproduced! No photograph, no sketch—now
or afterward. Do you hear me?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes, father,ï¿½ said the girl quietly.

ï¿½The vandals,ï¿½ he muttered, ï¿½the desecrators of beauty; if I thought it
would ever get into their hands Iï¿½d burn it first, by God!ï¿½ He turned to
Wyant, speaking more quietly. ï¿½I said you might come back—I never
retract what I say. But you must give me your word that no one but Clyde
shall see the notes you make.ï¿½

Wyant was growing warm.

ï¿½If you wonï¿½t trust me with a photograph I wonder you trust me not to show
my notes!ï¿½ he exclaimed.

The doctor looked at him with a malicious smile.

ï¿½Humph!ï¿½ he said; ï¿½would they be of much use to anybody?ï¿½

Wyant saw that he was losing ground and controlled his impatience.

ï¿½To Clyde, I hope, at any rate,ï¿½ he answered, holding out his hand. The
doctor shook it without a trace of resentment, and Wyant added: ï¿½When
shall I come, sir?ï¿½

ï¿½To-morrow—to-morrow morning,ï¿½ cried Miss Lombard, speaking
suddenly.

She looked fixedly at her father, and he shrugged his shoulders.

ï¿½The picture is hers,ï¿½ he said to Wyant.

In the ante-chamber the young man was met by the woman who had admitted
him. She handed him his hat and stick, and turned to unbar the door. As
the bolt slipped back he felt a touch on his arm.

ï¿½You have a letter?ï¿½ she said in a low tone.

ï¿½A letter?ï¿½ He stared. ï¿½What letter?ï¿½

She shrugged her shoulders, and drew back to let him pass.

II

As Wyant emerged from the house he paused once more to glance up at its
scarred brick facade. The marble hand drooped tragically above the
entrance: in the waning light it seemed to have relaxed into the
passiveness of despair, and Wyant stood musing on its hidden meaning. But
the Dead Hand was not the only mysterious thing about Doctor Lombardï¿½s
house. What were the relations between Miss Lombard and her father? Above
all, between Miss Lombard and her picture? She did not look like a person
capable of a disinterested passion for the arts; and there had been
moments when it struck Wyant that she hated the picture.

The sky at the end of the street was flooded with turbulent yellow light,
and the young man turned his steps toward the church of San Domenico, in
the hope of catching the lingering brightness on Sodomaï¿½s St. Catherine.

The great bare aisles were almost dark when he entered, and he had to
grope his way to the chapel steps. Under the momentary evocation of the
sunset, the saintï¿½s figure emerged pale and swooning from the dusk, and
the warm light gave a sensual tinge to her ecstasy. The flesh seemed to
glow and heave, the eyelids to tremble; Wyant stood fascinated by the
accidental collaboration of light and color.

Suddenly he noticed that something white had fluttered to the ground at
his feet. He stooped and picked up a small thin sheet of note-paper,
folded and sealed like an old-fashioned letter, and bearing the
superscription:—

To the Count Ottaviano Celsi.

Wyant stared at this mysterious document. Where had it come from? He was
distinctly conscious of having seen it fall through the air, close to his
feet. He glanced up at the dark ceiling of the chapel; then he turned and
looked about the church. There was only one figure in it, that of a man
who knelt near the high altar.

Suddenly Wyant recalled the question of Doctor Lombardï¿½s maid-servant. Was
this the letter she had asked for? Had he been unconsciously carrying it
about with him all the afternoon? Who was Count Ottaviano Celsi, and how
came Wyant to have been chosen to act as that noblemanï¿½s ambulant
letter-box?

Wyant laid his hat and stick on the chapel steps and began to explore his
pockets, in the irrational hope of finding there some clue to the mystery;
but they held nothing which he had not himself put there, and he was
reduced to wondering how the letter, supposing some unknown hand to have
bestowed it on him, had happened to fall out while he stood motionless
before the picture.

At this point he was disturbed by a step on the floor of the aisle, and
turning, he saw his lustrous-eyed neighbor of the table dï¿½hote.

The young man bowed and waved an apologetic hand.

ï¿½I do not intrude?ï¿½ he inquired suavely.

Without waiting for a reply, he mounted the steps of the chapel, glancing
about him with the affable air of an afternoon caller.

ï¿½I see,ï¿½ he remarked with a smile, ï¿½that you know the hour at which our
saint should be visited.ï¿½

Wyant agreed that the hour was indeed felicitous.

The stranger stood beamingly before the picture.

ï¿½What grace! What poetry!ï¿½ he murmured, apostrophizing the St. Catherine,
but letting his glance slip rapidly about the chapel as he spoke.

Wyant, detecting the manoeuvre, murmured a brief assent.

ï¿½But it is cold here—mortally cold; you do not find it so?ï¿½ The
intruder put on his hat. ï¿½It is permitted at this hour—when the
church is empty. And you, my dear sir—do you not feel the dampness?
You are an artist, are you not? And to artists it is permitted to cover
the head when they are engaged in the study of the paintings.ï¿½

He darted suddenly toward the steps and bent over Wyantï¿½s hat.

ï¿½Permit me—cover yourself!ï¿½ he said a moment later, holding out the
hat with an ingratiating gesture.

A light flashed on Wyant.

ï¿½Perhaps,ï¿½ he said, looking straight at the young man, ï¿½you will tell me
your name. My own is Wyant.ï¿½

The stranger, surprised, but not disconcerted, drew forth a coroneted
card, which he offered with a low bow. On the card was engraved:—

Il Conte Ottaviano Celsi.

ï¿½I am much obliged to you,ï¿½ said Wyant; ï¿½and I may as well tell you that
the letter which you apparently expected to find in the lining of my hat
is not there, but in my pocket.ï¿½

He drew it out and handed it to its owner, who had grown very pale.

ï¿½And now,ï¿½ Wyant continued, ï¿½you will perhaps be good enough to tell me
what all this means.ï¿½

There was no mistaking the effect produced on Count Ottaviano by this
request. His lips moved, but he achieved only an ineffectual smile.

ï¿½I suppose you know,ï¿½ Wyant went on, his anger rising at the sight of the
otherï¿½s discomfiture, ï¿½that you have taken an unwarrantable liberty. I
donï¿½t yet understand what part I have been made to play, but itï¿½s evident
that you have made use of me to serve some purpose of your own, and I
propose to know the reason why.ï¿½

Count Ottaviano advanced with an imploring gesture.

ï¿½Sir,ï¿½ he pleaded, ï¿½you permit me to speak?ï¿½

ï¿½I expect you to,ï¿½ cried Wyant. ï¿½But not here,ï¿½ he added, hearing the
clank of the vergerï¿½s keys. ï¿½It is growing dark, and we shall be turned
out in a few minutes.ï¿½

He walked across the church, and Count Ottaviano followed him out into the
deserted square.

ï¿½Now,ï¿½ said Wyant, pausing on the steps.

The Count, who had regained some measure of self-possession, began to
speak in a high key, with an accompaniment of conciliatory gesture.

ï¿½My dear sir—my dear Mr. Wyant—you find me in an abominable
position—that, as a man of honor, I immediately confess. I have
taken advantage of you—yes! I have counted on your amiability, your
chivalry—too far, perhaps? I confess it! But what could I do? It was
to oblige a ladyï¿½—he laid a hand on his heart—ï¿½a lady whom I
would die to serve!ï¿½ He went on with increasing volubility, his deliberate
English swept away by a torrent of Italian, through which Wyant, with some
difficulty, struggled to a comprehension of the case.

Count Ottaviano, according to his own statement, had come to Siena some
months previously, on business connected with his motherï¿½s property; the
paternal estate being near Orvieto, of which ancient city his father was
syndic. Soon after his arrival in Siena the young Count had met the
incomparable daughter of Doctor Lombard, and falling deeply in love with
her, had prevailed on his parents to ask her hand in marriage. Doctor
Lombard had not opposed his suit, but when the question of settlements
arose it became known that Miss Lombard, who was possessed of a small
property in her own right, had a short time before invested the whole
amount in the purchase of the Bergamo Leonardo. Thereupon Count
Ottavianoï¿½s parents had politely suggested that she should sell the
picture and thus recover her independence; and this proposal being met by
a curt refusal from Doctor Lombard, they had withdrawn their consent to
their sonï¿½s marriage. The young ladyï¿½s attitude had hitherto been one of
passive submission; she was horribly afraid of her father, and would never
venture openly to oppose him; but she had made known to Ottaviano her
intention of not giving him up, of waiting patiently till events should
take a more favorable turn. She seemed hardly aware, the Count said with a
sigh, that the means of escape lay in her own hands; that she was of age,
and had a right to sell the picture, and to marry without asking her
fatherï¿½s consent. Meanwhile her suitor spared no pains to keep himself
before her, to remind her that he, too, was waiting and would never give
her up.

Doctor Lombard, who suspected the young man of trying to persuade Sybilla
to sell the picture, had forbidden the lovers to meet or to correspond;
they were thus driven to clandestine communication, and had several times,
the Count ingenuously avowed, made use of the doctorï¿½s visitors as a means
of exchanging letters.

ï¿½And you told the visitors to ring twice?ï¿½ Wyant interposed.

The young man extended his hands in a deprecating gesture. Could Mr. Wyant
blame him? He was young, he was ardent, he was enamored! The young lady
had done him the supreme honor of avowing her attachment, of pledging her
unalterable fidelity; should he suffer his devotion to be outdone? But his
purpose in writing to her, he admitted, was not merely to reiterate his
fidelity; he was trying by every means in his power to induce her to sell
the picture. He had organized a plan of action; every detail was complete;
if she would but have the courage to carry out his instructions he would
answer for the result. His idea was that she should secretly retire to a
convent of which his aunt was the Mother Superior, and from that
stronghold should transact the sale of the Leonardo. He had a purchaser
ready, who was willing to pay a large sum; a sum, Count Ottaviano
whispered, considerably in excess of the young ladyï¿½s original
inheritance; once the picture sold, it could, if necessary, be removed by
force from Doctor Lombardï¿½s house, and his daughter, being safely in the
convent, would be spared the painful scenes incidental to the removal.
Finally, if Doctor Lombard were vindictive enough to refuse his consent to
her marriage, she had only to make a
sommation respectueuse
, and at the
end of the prescribed delay no power on earth could prevent her becoming
the wife of Count Ottaviano.

Wyantï¿½s anger had fallen at the recital of this simple romance. It was
absurd to be angry with a young man who confided his secrets to the first
stranger he met in the streets, and placed his hand on his heart whenever
he mentioned the name of his betrothed. The easiest way out of the
business was to take it as a joke. Wyant had played the wall to this new
Pyramus and Thisbe, and was philosophic enough to laugh at the part he had
unwittingly performed.

He held out his hand with a smile to Count Ottaviano.

ï¿½I wonï¿½t deprive you any longer,ï¿½ he said, ï¿½of the pleasure of reading
your letter.ï¿½

ï¿½Oh, sir, a thousand thanks! And when you return to the casa Lombard, you
will take a message from me—the letter she expected this afternoon?ï¿½

ï¿½The letter she expected?ï¿½ Wyant paused. ï¿½No, thank you. I thought you
understood that where I come from we donï¿½t do that kind of thing—knowingly.ï¿½

ï¿½But, sir, to serve a young lady!ï¿½

ï¿½Iï¿½m sorry for the young lady, if what you tell me is trueï¿½—the
Countï¿½s expressive hands resented the doubt—ï¿½but remember that if I
am under obligations to any one in this matter, it is to her father, who
has admitted me to his house and has allowed me to see his picture.ï¿½

ï¿½
His
picture? Hers!ï¿½

ï¿½Well, the house is his, at all events.ï¿½

ï¿½Unhappily—since to her it is a dungeon!ï¿½

ï¿½Why doesnï¿½t she leave it, then?ï¿½ exclaimed Wyant impatiently.

The Count clasped his hands. ï¿½Ah, how you say that—with what force,
with what virility! If you would but say it to
her
in that tone—you,
her countryman! She has no one to advise her; the mother is an idiot; the
father is terrible; she is in his power; it is my belief that he would
kill her if she resisted him. Mr. Wyant, I tremble for her life while she
remains in that house!ï¿½

ï¿½Oh, come,ï¿½ said Wyant lightly, ï¿½they seem to understand each other well
enough. But in any case, you must see that I canï¿½t interfere—at
least you would if you were an Englishman,ï¿½ he added with an escape of
contempt.

III

Wyantï¿½s affiliations in Siena being restricted to an acquaintance with his
land-lady, he was forced to apply to her for the verification of Count
Ottavianoï¿½s story.

The young nobleman had, it appeared, given a perfectly correct account of
his situation. His father, Count Celsi-Mongirone, was a man of
distinguished family and some wealth. He was syndic of Orvieto, and lived
either in that town or on his neighboring estate of Mongirone. His wife
owned a large property near Siena, and Count Ottaviano, who was the second
son, came there from time to time to look into its management. The eldest
son was in the army, the youngest in the Church; and an aunt of Count
Ottavianoï¿½s was Mother Superior of the Visitandine convent in Siena. At
one time it had been said that Count Ottaviano, who was a most amiable and
accomplished young man, was to marry the daughter of the strange
Englishman, Doctor Lombard, but difficulties having arisen as to the
adjustment of the young ladyï¿½s dower, Count Celsi-Mongirone had very
properly broken off the match. It was sad for the young man, however, who
was said to be deeply in love, and to find frequent excuses for coming to
Siena to inspect his motherï¿½s estate.

Viewed in the light of Count Ottavianoï¿½s personality the story had a tinge
of opera bouffe; but the next morning, as Wyant mounted the stairs of the
House of the Dead Hand, the situation insensibly assumed another aspect.
It was impossible to take Doctor Lombard lightly; and there was a
suggestion of fatality in the appearance of his gaunt dwelling. Who could
tell amid what tragic records of domestic tyranny and fluttering broken
purposes the little drama of Miss Lombardï¿½s fate was being played out?
Might not the accumulated influences of such a house modify the lives
within it in a manner unguessed by the inmates of a suburban villa with
sanitary plumbing and a telephone?

One person, at least, remained unperturbed by such fanciful problems; and
that was Mrs. Lombard, who, at Wyantï¿½s entrance, raised a placidly
wrinkled brow from her knitting. The morning was mild, and her chair had
been wheeled into a bar of sunshine near the window, so that she made a
cheerful spot of prose in the poetic gloom of her surroundings.

ï¿½What a nice morning!ï¿½ she said; ï¿½it must be delightful weather at
Bonchurch.ï¿½

Her dull blue glance wandered across the narrow street with its
threatening house fronts, and fluttered back baffled, like a bird with
clipped wings. It was evident, poor lady, that she had never seen beyond
the opposite houses.

Wyant was not sorry to find her alone. Seeing that she was surprised at
his reappearance he said at once: ï¿½I have come back to study Miss
Lombardï¿½s picture.ï¿½

ï¿½Oh, the picture—ï¿½ Mrs. Lombardï¿½s face expressed a gentle
disappointment, which might have been boredom in a person of acuter
sensibilities. ï¿½Itï¿½s an original Leonardo, you know,ï¿½ she said
mechanically.

ï¿½And Miss Lombard is very proud of it, I suppose? She seems to have
inherited her fatherï¿½s love for art.ï¿½

Mrs. Lombard counted her stitches, and he went on: ï¿½Itï¿½s unusual in so
young a girl. Such tastes generally develop later.ï¿½

Mrs. Lombard looked up eagerly. ï¿½Thatï¿½s what I say! I was quite different
at her age, you know. I liked dancing, and doing a pretty bit of
fancy-work. Not that I couldnï¿½t sketch, too; I had a master down from
London. My aunts have some of my crayons hung up in their drawing-room now—I
did a view of Kenilworth which was thought pleasing. But I liked a picnic,
too, or a pretty walk through the woods with young people of my own age. I
say itï¿½s more natural, Mr. Wyant; one may have a feeling for art, and do
crayons that are worth framing, and yet not give up everything else. I was
taught that there were other things.ï¿½

Wyant, half-ashamed of provoking these innocent confidences, could not
resist another question. ï¿½And Miss Lombard cares for nothing else?ï¿½

Her mother looked troubled.

ï¿½Sybilla is so clever—she says I donï¿½t understand. You know how
self-confident young people are! My husband never said that of me, now—he
knows I had an excellent education. My aunts were very particular; I was
brought up to have opinions, and my husband has always respected them. He
says himself that he wouldnï¿½t for the world miss hearing my opinion on any
subject; you may have noticed that he often refers to my tastes. He has
always respected my preference for living in England; he likes to hear me
give my reasons for it. He is so much interested in my ideas that he often
says he knows just what I am going to say before I speak. But Sybilla does
not care for what I think—ï¿½

At this point Doctor Lombard entered. He glanced sharply at Wyant. ï¿½The
servant is a fool; she didnï¿½t tell me you were here.ï¿½ His eye turned to
his wife. ï¿½Well, my dear, what have you been telling Mr. Wyant? About the
aunts at Bonchurch, Iï¿½ll be bound!ï¿½

Mrs. Lombard looked triumphantly at Wyant, and her husband rubbed his
hooked fingers, with a smile.

ï¿½Mrs. Lombardï¿½s aunts are very superior women. They subscribe to the
circulating library, and borrow Good Words and the Monthly Packet from the
curateï¿½s wife across the way. They have the rector to tea twice a year,
and keep a page-boy, and are visited by two baronetsï¿½ wives. They devoted
themselves to the education of their orphan niece, and I think I may say
without boasting that Mrs. Lombardï¿½s conversation shows marked traces of
the advantages she enjoyed.ï¿½

Mrs. Lombard colored with pleasure.

ï¿½I was telling Mr. Wyant that my aunts were very particular.ï¿½

ï¿½Quite so, my dear; and did you mention that they never sleep in anything
but linen, and that Miss Sophia puts away the furs and blankets every
spring with her own hands? Both those facts are interesting to the student
of human nature.ï¿½ Doctor Lombard glanced at his watch. ï¿½But we are missing
an incomparable moment; the light is perfect at this hour.ï¿½

Wyant rose, and the doctor led him through the tapestried door and down
the passageway.

The light was, in fact, perfect, and the picture shone with an inner
radiancy, as though a lamp burned behind the soft screen of the ladyï¿½s
flesh. Every detail of the foreground detached itself with jewel-like
precision. Wyant noticed a dozen accessories which had escaped him on the
previous day.

He drew out his note-book, and the doctor, who had dropped his sardonic
grin for a look of devout contemplation, pushed a chair forward, and
seated himself on a carved settle against the wall.

ï¿½Now, then,ï¿½ he said, ï¿½tell Clyde what you can; but the letter killeth.ï¿½

He sank down, his hands hanging on the arm of the settle like the claws of
a dead bird, his eyes fixed on Wyantï¿½s notebook with the obvious intention
of detecting any attempt at a surreptitious sketch.

Wyant, nettled at this surveillance, and disturbed by the speculations
which Doctor Lombardï¿½s strange household excited, sat motionless for a few
minutes, staring first at the picture and then at the blank pages of the
note-book. The thought that Doctor Lombard was enjoying his discomfiture
at length roused him, and he began to write.

He was interrupted by a knock on the iron door. Doctor Lombard rose to
unlock it, and his daughter entered.

She bowed hurriedly to Wyant, without looking at him.

ï¿½Father, had you forgotten that the man from Monte Amiato was to come back
this morning with an answer about the bas-relief? He is here now; he says
he canï¿½t wait.ï¿½

ï¿½The devil!ï¿½ cried her father impatiently. ï¿½Didnï¿½t you tell him—ï¿½

ï¿½Yes; but he says he canï¿½t come back. If you want to see him you must come
now.ï¿½

ï¿½Then you think thereï¿½s a chance?—ï¿½

She nodded.

He turned and looked at Wyant, who was writing assiduously.

ï¿½You will stay here, Sybilla; I shall be back in a moment.ï¿½

He hurried out, locking the door behind him.

Wyant had looked up, wondering if Miss Lombard would show any surprise at
being locked in with him; but it was his turn to be surprised, for hardly
had they heard the key withdrawn when she moved close to him, her small
face pale and tumultuous.

ï¿½I arranged it—I must speak to you,ï¿½ she gasped. ï¿½Heï¿½ll be back in
five minutes.ï¿½

Her courage seemed to fail, and she looked at him helplessly.

Wyant had a sense of stepping among explosives. He glanced about him at
the dusky vaulted room, at the haunting smile of the strange picture
overhead, and at the pink-and-white girl whispering of conspiracies in a
voice meant to exchange platitudes with a curate.

ï¿½How can I help you?ï¿½ he said with a rush of compassion.

ï¿½Oh, if you would! I never have a chance to speak to any one; itï¿½s so
difficult—he watches me—heï¿½ll be back immediately.ï¿½

ï¿½Try to tell me what I can do.ï¿½

ï¿½I donï¿½t dare; I feel as if he were behind me.ï¿½ She turned away, fixing
her eyes on the picture. A sound startled her. ï¿½There he comes, and I
havenï¿½t spoken! It was my only chance; but it bewilders me so to be
hurried.ï¿½

ï¿½I donï¿½t hear any one,ï¿½ said Wyant, listening. ï¿½Try to tell me.ï¿½

ï¿½How can I make you understand? It would take so long to explain.ï¿½ She
drew a deep breath, and then with a plunge—ï¿½Will you come here again
this afternoon—at about five?ï¿½ she whispered.

ï¿½Come here again?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes—you can ask to see the picture,—make some excuse. He will
come with you, of course; I will open the door for you—and—and
lock you both inï¿½—she gasped.

ï¿½Lock us in?ï¿½

ï¿½You see? You understand? Itï¿½s the only way for me to leave the house—if
I am ever to do itï¿½—She drew another difficult breath. ï¿½The key will
be returned—by a safe person—in half an hour,—perhaps
sooner—ï¿½

She trembled so much that she was obliged to lean against the settle for
support.

ï¿½Wyant looked at her steadily; he was very sorry for her.

ï¿½I canï¿½t, Miss Lombard,ï¿½ he said at length.

ï¿½You canï¿½t?ï¿½

ï¿½Iï¿½m sorry; I must seem cruel; but consider—ï¿½

He was stopped by the futility of the word: as well ask a hunted rabbit to
pause in its dash for a hole!

Wyant took her hand; it was cold and nerveless.

ï¿½I will serve you in any way I can; but you must see that this way is
impossible. Canï¿½t I talk to you again? Perhaps—ï¿½

ï¿½Oh,ï¿½ she cried, starting up, ï¿½there he comes!ï¿½

Doctor Lombardï¿½s step sounded in the passage.

Wyant held her fast. ï¿½Tell me one thing: he wonï¿½t let you sell the
picture?ï¿½

ï¿½No—hush!ï¿½

ï¿½Make no pledges for the future, then; promise me that.ï¿½

ï¿½The future?ï¿½

ï¿½In case he should die: your father is an old man. You havenï¿½t promised?ï¿½

She shook her head.

ï¿½Donï¿½t, then; remember that.ï¿½

She made no answer, and the key turned in the lock.

As he passed out of the house, its scowling cornice and facade of ravaged
brick looked down on him with the startlingness of a strange face, seen
momentarily in a crowd, and impressing itself on the brain as part of an
inevitable future. Above the doorway, the marble hand reached out like the
cry of an imprisoned anguish.

Wyant turned away impatiently.

ï¿½Rubbish!ï¿½ he said to himself. ï¿½
She
isnï¿½t walled in; she can get out if
she wants to.ï¿½

IV

Wyant had any number of plans for coming to Miss Lombardï¿½s aid: he was
elaborating the twentieth when, on the same afternoon, he stepped into the
express train for Florence. By the time the train reached Certaldo he was
convinced that, in thus hastening his departure, he had followed the only
reasonable course; at Empoli, he began to reflect that the priest and the
Levite had probably justified themselves in much the same manner.

A month later, after his return to England, he was unexpectedly relieved
from these alternatives of extenuation and approval. A paragraph in the
morning paper announced the sudden death of Doctor Lombard, the
distinguished English dilettante who had long resided in Siena. Wyantï¿½s
justification was complete. Our blindest impulses become evidence of
perspicacity when they fall in with the course of events.

Wyant could now comfortably speculate on the particular complications from
which his foresight had probably saved him. The climax was unexpectedly
dramatic. Miss Lombard, on the brink of a step which, whatever its issue,
would have burdened her with retrospective compunction, had been set free
before her suitorï¿½s ardor could have had time to cool, and was now
doubtless planning a life of domestic felicity on the proceeds of the
Leonardo. One thing, however, struck Wyant as odd—he saw no mention
of the sale of the picture. He had scanned the papers for an immediate
announcement of its transfer to one of the great museums; but presently
concluding that Miss Lombard, out of filial piety, had wished to avoid an
appearance of unseemly haste in the disposal of her treasure, he dismissed
the matter from his mind. Other affairs happened to engage him; the months
slipped by, and gradually the lady and the picture dwelt less vividly in
his mind.

It was not till five or six years later, when chance took him again to
Siena, that the recollection started from some inner fold of memory. He
found himself, as it happened, at the head of Doctor Lombardï¿½s street, and
glancing down that grim thoroughfare, caught an oblique glimpse of the
doctorï¿½s house front, with the Dead Hand projecting above its threshold.
The sight revived his interest, and that evening, over an admirable
frittata, he questioned his landlady about Miss Lombardï¿½s marriage.

ï¿½The daughter of the English doctor? But she has never married, signore.ï¿½

ï¿½Never married? What, then, became of Count Ottaviano?ï¿½

ï¿½For a long time he waited; but last year he married a noble lady of the
Maremma.ï¿½

ï¿½But what happened—why was the marriage broken?ï¿½

The landlady enacted a pantomime of baffled interrogation.

ï¿½And Miss Lombard still lives in her fatherï¿½s house?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes, signore; she is still there.ï¿½

ï¿½And the Leonardo—ï¿½

ï¿½The Leonardo, also, is still there.ï¿½

The next day, as Wyant entered the House of the Dead Hand, he remembered
Count Ottavianoï¿½s injunction to ring twice, and smiled mournfully to think
that so much subtlety had been vain. But what could have prevented the
marriage? If Doctor Lombardï¿½s death had been long delayed, time might have
acted as a dissolvent, or the young ladyï¿½s resolve have failed; but it
seemed impossible that the white heat of ardor in which Wyant had left the
lovers should have cooled in a few short weeks.

As he ascended the vaulted stairway the atmosphere of the place seemed a
reply to his conjectures. The same numbing air fell on him, like an
emanation from some persistent will-power, a something fierce and imminent
which might reduce to impotence every impulse within its range. Wyant
could almost fancy a hand on his shoulder, guiding him upward with the
ironical intent of confronting him with the evidence of its work.

A strange servant opened the door, and he was presently introduced to the
tapestried room, where, from their usual seats in the window, Mrs. Lombard
and her daughter advanced to welcome him with faint ejaculations of
surprise.

Both had grown oddly old, but in a dry, smooth way, as fruits might
shrivel on a shelf instead of ripening on the tree. Mrs. Lombard was still
knitting, and pausing now and then to warm her swollen hands above the
brazier; and Miss Lombard, in rising, had laid aside a strip of
needle-work which might have been the same on which Wyant had first seen
her engaged.

Their visitor inquired discreetly how they had fared in the interval, and
learned that they had thought of returning to England, but had somehow
never done so.

ï¿½I am sorry not to see my aunts again,ï¿½ Mrs. Lombard said resignedly; ï¿½but
Sybilla thinks it best that we should not go this year.ï¿½

ï¿½Next year, perhaps,ï¿½ murmured Miss Lombard, in a voice which seemed to
suggest that they had a great waste of time to fill.

She had returned to her seat, and sat bending over her work. Her hair
enveloped her head in the same thick braids, but the rose color of her
cheeks had turned to blotches of dull red, like some pigment which has
darkened in drying.

ï¿½And Professor Clyde—is he well?ï¿½ Mrs. Lombard asked affably;
continuing, as her daughter raised a startled eye: ï¿½Surely, Sybilla, Mr.
Wyant was the gentleman who was sent by Professor Clyde to see the
Leonardo?ï¿½

Miss Lombard was silent, but Wyant hastened to assure the elder lady of
his friendï¿½s well-being.

ï¿½Ah—perhaps, then, he will come back some day to Siena,ï¿½ she said,
sighing. Wyant declared that it was more than likely; and there ensued a
pause, which he presently broke by saying to Miss Lombard: ï¿½And you still
have the picture?ï¿½

She raised her eyes and looked at him. ï¿½Should you like to see it?ï¿½ she
asked.

On his assenting, she rose, and extracting the same key from the same
secret drawer, unlocked the door beneath the tapestry. They walked down
the passage in silence, and she stood aside with a grave gesture, making
Wyant pass before her into the room. Then she crossed over and drew the
curtain back from the picture.

The light of the early afternoon poured full on it: its surface appeared
to ripple and heave with a fluid splendor. The colors had lost none of
their warmth, the outlines none of their pure precision; it seemed to
Wyant like some magical flower which had burst suddenly from the mould of
darkness and oblivion.

He turned to Miss Lombard with a movement of comprehension.

ï¿½Ah, I understand—you couldnï¿½t part with it, after all!ï¿½ he cried.

ï¿½No—I couldnï¿½t part with it,ï¿½ she answered.

ï¿½Itï¿½s too beautiful,—too beautiful,ï¿½—he assented.

ï¿½Too beautiful?ï¿½ She turned on him with a curious stare. ï¿½I have never
thought it beautiful, you know.ï¿½

He gave back the stare. ï¿½You have never—ï¿½

She shook her head. ï¿½Itï¿½s not that. I hate it; Iï¿½ve always hated it. But
he wouldnï¿½t let me—he will never let me now.ï¿½

Wyant was startled by her use of the present tense. Her look surprised
him, too: there was a strange fixity of resentment in her innocuous eye.
Was it possible that she was laboring under some delusion? Or did the
pronoun not refer to her father?

ï¿½You mean that Doctor Lombard did not wish you to part with the picture?ï¿½

ï¿½No—he prevented me; he will always prevent me.ï¿½

There was another pause. ï¿½You promised him, then, before his death—ï¿½

ï¿½No; I promised nothing. He died too suddenly to make me.ï¿½ Her voice sank
to a whisper. ï¿½I was free—perfectly free—or I thought I was
till I tried.ï¿½

ï¿½Till you tried?ï¿½

ï¿½To disobey him—to sell the picture. Then I found it was impossible.
I tried again and again; but he was always in the room with me.ï¿½

She glanced over her shoulder as though she had heard a step; and to
Wyant, too, for a moment, the room seemed full of a third presence.

ï¿½And you canï¿½tï¿½—he faltered, unconsciously dropping his voice to the
pitch of hers.

She shook her head, gazing at him mystically. ï¿½I canï¿½t lock him out; I can
never lock him out now. I told you I should never have another chance.ï¿½

Wyant felt the chill of her words like a cold breath in his hair.

ï¿½Ohï¿½—he groaned; but she cut him off with a grave gesture.

ï¿½It is too late,ï¿½ she said; ï¿½but you ought to have helped me that day.ï¿½

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
ï¿½Defects,ï¿½ such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the ï¿½Right
of Replacement or Refundï¿½ described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ï¿½AS-ISï¿½ WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tmï¿½s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

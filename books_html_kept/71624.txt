PHILIP HAMILTON McMILLAN

MEMORIAL PUBLICATION

FUND

The present volume is the fourth work published by the Yale
University Press on the Philip Hamilton McMillan Memorial
Publication Fund. This Foundation was established December
12, 1922, by a gift to Yale University in pursuance of a pledge
announced on Alumni University Day in February, 1922, of a
fund of $100,000 bequeathed to James Thayer McMillan and
Alexis Caswell Angell as Trustees, by Mrs. Elizabeth Anderson
McMillan, of Detroit, to be devoted by them to the establishment
of a Memorial in honor of her husband.

He was born in Detroit, Michigan, December 28th, 1872, prepared
for college at Phillips Academy, Andover, and was
graduated from Yale in the Class of 1894. As an undergraduate
he was a leader in many of the college activities of his day, and
within a brief period of his graduation was called upon to assume
heavy responsibilities in the management and direction of
numerous business enterprises in Detroit; where he was also a
Trustee of the Young Menâs Christian Association and of Grace
Hospital. His untimely death, from heart disease, on October
4th, 1919, deprived his city of one of its leading citizens and his
University of one of its most loyal sons.

FOREWORD

uch
memoirs as were left to posterity
by Captain Elijah Cobb are fragmentary,
a few letters and a narrative of
certain voyages, yet they serve to portray
with singular fidelity the figure of a
New England shipmaster of a century
and more ago against the backgrounds
of his time. Seafaring has long since ceased to be interwoven
with the lives and interests of the American
people as a whole. No fact is more difficult to realize
than that we were once a maritime nation which, from
father to son, earned its bread upon the face of the
waters. The abandoned farm with the grassy cellar-hole
and the lilac bush surviving by the stone doorstep is the
accepted symbol of the Puritan and Pilgrim pioneers.
Just as eloquent and significant are the sloping shores of
a hundred bays and inlets where the little brigs, sloops,
and ketches were built to trade with Virginia, with the
West Indies, with the ports of Europe.

At the beginning of the Revolution, in fact, there
were more sailors than farmers in the coastwise settlements
of Maine and New Hampshire. Shipping was the
chief industry of Boston. On Cape Cod, where Elijah
Cobb was born and raised, the boys followed the sea instead
of the plow, and the dry land was merely a roosting
place until they were old enough to sign on in a forecastle.

[Pg 2]

The proverbial Yankee traits of canny business
dealings, handiness, and resourceful hardihood were
bred in those clumsy, home-made vessels. The skipper
was also a merchant who bought and sold and bartered
the cargoes that filled his holds. His crew risked their
own âadventuresâ in cash or merchandise, while his
neighbors ashore owned shares in the vessel and her enterprises.
And every voyage was a hazard that might
make or break them.

Elijah Cobb is well worth bringing to light because
he was so completely typical, from his piety and his eccentric
spelling to his mastery of difficulties. The romance
of the sea meant nothing to him, although he
sailed in continual peril of pirate and privateer and of
foundering in a gale of wind. Navigation was mostly
by guesswork and to us it seems miraculous that he and
his kind were able to fetch anywhere at all. What he
called a good ship was not much larger than a canal boat,
with a few men and boys to handle it. Such was the
training school of the shipbuilders and seamen who, in
succeeding generations, were to win for the Stars and
Stripes on the high seas a commercial prestige that challenged
the ancient supremacy of Great Britain and
achieved its superb climax in the clipper ship era.

With unconscious art Elijah Cobb suggests to us the
beginnings of his own career. It could not be better done
by the practised hand of a novelist. His father, the master
of a brig, dying at sea, left a young widow with six
small children in poverty on a forlorn Cape Cod farm.

[Pg 3]

The family could not be kept together. âSome of us,
must leave the perternal dwelling & seek subsistance
among strangersâmy Bro
r.
, being the elder, was tried
first, but wouâd not stay, & came home cryingâI was
then, in my 6
th
year, & althoâ too young to earn my
living, a place was offered me, & I left my dear Mother,
for that subsistance among strangers which she could
not procure for me.â

For seven years this brave little codger toiled away
from home and then disabled himself by lifting beyond
his strength. His dear mother nursed him back to health
and, in 1783, when he was in his fourteenth year, he
went to Boston to look for a voyage, with his âwhole
wardrobe packed in a gin case, for a trunk.â

You can imagine him wandering down to the long
wharf and admiring the âmonstrous sizeâ of a new vessel,
her great cables and anchors, when the marvelous
gentleman steps from her deck, and signs him on for the
voyage at $3.50 a month.

And so as a cook he sailed away for fever-stricken
Surinam, or Dutch Guiana. His wages, together with
some presents from the officers, enabled him to bring
back a private âadventureâ of a barrel of molasses and
some dried fruit. The trade with the West Indies had
flourished a full century before the Revolution. There
was always a market for salted codfish to feed the
slaves of the sugar plantations. The return cargoes were
largely molasses for distilling New England rum. These
voyages had been extended to the mainland of South

[Pg 4]

America; to Surinam, where fish and lumber were exchanged
for the products of the Dutch East Indies; to
Honduras, whose logwood and mahogany were cut for
export to England.

Young Elijah Cobb escaped the swamp fever and returned
with twenty silver dollars to put into his motherâs
hands, âprobably, the largest sum of money she had
possess
d.
since she had been a widowâ& that, from her
poor little sick Boy.â No wonder her tears flowed
freely, upon the occasion. For some time thereafter he
was sailing coastwise and working his way up to a mateâs
berth. Then he crossed the stormy Western Ocean and
felt qualified for command. He must have been twenty-three
years old when he became master of a brig. This
was not unusually youthful. Nathaniel Silsbee of Salem,
a captain in the East India trade at nineteen, could say
of his own family:

âConnected with the seafaring life of myself and my
brothers, there were some circumstances which do not
usually occur in one family. In the first place each of us
commenced that occupation in the capacity of clerk, or
supercargo, myself at the age of fourteen years; my
brother William at about fifteen; and my brother
Zachariah at about sixteen and a half years. Each and all
of us obtained the command of vessels and the consignment
of their cargoes before attaining the age of twenty
years, viz., myself at the age of eighteen and a half, my
brother William at nineteen and a half, and my brother
Zachariah before he was twenty years old.â

[Pg 5]

It was during his first voyage to Europe as a shipmaster
that Captain Elijah Cobb showed himself to be a
young man of exceptional courage and contrivance.
Steering for Cadiz, he learned that it was unsafe to venture
too close to Gibraltar and so he changed his course to
Coruna in the Bay of Biscay. The swift corsairs of the
Dey of Algiers were cruising like wolves to snap up
merchantmen and enslave their Christian crews. In his
journal Captain Cobb states that âthe Algerines were at
war with America.â This is not quite accurate, for the
United States delayed declaring war on the Barbary
pirates until 1801, several years after this.

The infant republic, left without any naval force at
the close of the Revolution, was compelled to submit to
the most humiliating insults and depredations at the
hands of these lawless sea rovers. It seems incredible to
recall the gifts and bribes that were abjectly paid the
Dey of Algiers as tribute, including a handsome new
frigate, nor can one read the newspaper account without
a blush.

Portsmouth, N. H., Jan 20, 1798. On Thursday morning,
about sunrise, a gun was discharged from the frigate
Crescent
,
as a signal for getting under way. May she arrive in safety at
the place of her destination, as a present to the Dey of Algiers
of one of the finest specimens of elegant naval architecture
which was ever borne on the Piscataquaâs waters. Richard
OâBrien, who was ten years a prisoner at Algiers, took passage
in the frigate and is to reside at Algiers as Consul-General of
the United States to all the Barbary States. The
Crescent
has

[Pg 6]

many valuable presents for the Dey, including twenty-six
barrels of dollars. It is worthy of remark that the captain, the
chief officers and many of the privates of the
Crescent
frigate
have been prisoners at Algiers.

When Captain Cobb prudently went wide of the
Strait of Gibraltar, in 1794, the Dey was running
amuck among American merchant vessels. As many as
ten of these luckless ships had been taken in one cruise
of a brig and three xebecks out of Algiers, and more
than a hundred Yankee seamen thrown into dungeons to
toil under the lash of Arab slave drivers. And honest
seamen were begging from door to door in Boston and
Salem to collect funds for the ransom of this fellow
mariner or that, with whom they had been shipmates.
The tourist who visits the Algiers of today, an ornate
French metropolis with the ancient Arab town climbing
the hill behind it, can behold strongholds whose stones
were laid by tortured, perishing sailormen from the land
of the brave and the free.

Bearing safely away from those ticklish waters, Captain
Elijah Cobb found himself out of the frying-pan
and into the fire. England had gone to war with France
in 1793 when most of Europe was allied in the effort to
stamp out the flames of the Revolution. The rights of
neutrals were tossed aside. American shipping was
ground between two millstones. All was fair in war.
British and French cruisers seized our ships for engaging
in trade which our own interpretation of international

[Pg 7]

law held to be perfectly legitimate. More than a
hundred American vessels were taken by France in 1793
on pretext of trading with England or her colonies.

Captain Cobb could find no reason why his voyage to
Spain should be molested and he was too stiff-necked to
submit without protest. His papers were stolen by the
prize master and there seemed to be no means of redress
whatever. He had no friends in France, official or otherwise,
and his ship was tied up in the port of Brest while
a starving populace looted her cargo of foodstuffs. The
Reign of Terror was at its height. Chaos and bloodshed
ruled in place of government. The guillotine was a law
unto itself. In a period of fifteen months, 17,000 persons
had been formally executed in France. The number
of those who were shot, drowned, or otherwise massacred
without pretense of a trial can never be known,
but must be reckoned far greater.

All of which may have harrowed the soul of Captain
Elijah Cobb, but he kept his eye firmly fixed on his own
predicament. His ship had to be released and indemnity
paid him for detention and loss of cargo. After six weeks
of wrangling with minor officials, he resolved to go to
Paris and seek satisfaction. A stubborn mariner who
shoved obstacles aside, behold him making this dangerous
journey with an official courier, for armament loaded
pistols and a blunderbuss, in a carriage that was âmusquet
shot proofâ and driving like Jehu night and day, without
a wink of sleep all the way from Brest, more than
six hundred miles.

[Pg 8]

Undismayed, persistent, Captain Elijah Cobb pursued
his way through the weltering horrors of Paris, merely
noting that he saw one thousand persons beheaded by
âthat infernal machine,â the guillotine. Thwarted at
every turn, he carried his case to none other than Robespierre
himself. The audacity of this Yankee seafarer
was amazing. He made dollars seem heroic. His motive
was really better than thisâthe compulsion of duty toward
the owners who had entrusted him with the ship
and her lading. Citizen Robespierre, Carlyleâs sea-green
monster, spoke the word that swiftly untangled the
affair.

Shortly after this, Robespierre was overthrown and
outlawed by the Convention. Trying to commit suicide
with a pistol, the bullet did no more than shatter his jaw.
And now for the final scene in the Place de la Concorde.
Captain Cobb stood there and beheld it with his own
eyes, on the 9th Thermidor (July 28, 1794). Robespierre
rides on a tumbril, the mangled jaw bound in
dirty linen. The Gendarmes point their swords at him
to show the people who he is. A woman leaps upon the
tumbril and screams: âThy death rejoices my very heart.

ScÃ©lÃ©rat
, go down to Hell with the curses of all wives
and mothers!â At the scaffold they stretch him on the
ground. Then Samson, the burly executioner, lifts him
aloft, wrenches off his coat, tears the dirty linen from
his jaw. A hideous cry and the head of Robespierre is
shorn from his shoulders.

And how does Captain Cobb describe this gigantic episode?

[Pg 9]

As if he were making an entry in a shipâs log.
âBefore I left the country; I saw Robertspeirs head
taken off, by the same MachineâBut to return to my
induvidual, and embarised affairsâ¦.â This was
characteristic of the New England breed of seafarers.
They are exasperating at times. They saw so much and
told so little. The wonders of the world left them unmoved.
The pen was an awkward tool to handle and
they were as thrifty with words as with pence.

You will find Captain Cobb waxing loquacious, however,
when it comes to the intricate and difficult business
of due bills and foreign exchange or smuggling gold out
of France. All this is of value to the modern reader as
showing how extremely competent were these master
mariners as bankers and merchants. It helps to explain
why they became the leaders in their communities when
they retired from the quarter-deck, and why they were
so successful, as a class, in commercial pursuits ashore.
They were literally the first American captains of industry,
men accustomed to large responsibilities and the
tests of critical emergencies.

It throws a curious slant on the moral code of the
time to find Elijah Cobb so profoundly pious and yet so
ready to bribe and smuggle with a clear conscience. In
a way, this point of view was inherited from the American
Revolution. The harsh restrictions laid by the mother
country on the commerce of her colonies had led to
smuggling as an easy road to wealth. In almost every
town prominent characters were named who, under

[Pg 10]

British rule, had stowed in their attics and cellars goods
that were not for the officers of the Kingâs Customs to
see. To these harbors came vessels built for speed and
laden with contraband wares gathered in the colonies
of France and Spain. And reputable merchants were always
ready to run the stuff ashore. Thus, on the very day
when the farmers of Middlesex drove the British out of
Lexington, John Hancock was to have stood trial for
defrauding the Customs.

And so Elijah Cobb, pillar of the Universalist church
in his later years, is not in the least ashamed to admit that
he did a very pretty job of running rum to a crew of
skilled smugglers between the Cove of Cork and the
Scilly Islands.

It was adroit intelligence and knowledge of the world
that enabled him to escape from the trap of the British
Orders in Council that ruined hundreds of American
shipmasters and owners. These high-handed measures
aimed against Napoleon, together with his Milan Decree
launched in retaliation, made American vessels liable to
confiscation in almost every foreign port to which they
traded. It was not a proud era in our national history.
The time was not far distant when the cry of âFree
Trade and Sailorsâ Rightsâ was to sound the note of the
Second War with England.

Elijah Cobb, loading a return cargo of wines and
dried fruit at Malaga, in 1806, learned that England
forbade such a voyage. He decided to take a sporting
chance of slipping by the English cruisers in the âGut

[Pg 11]

of Gibralter.â The wind failing him at the wrong time,
he obtained his clearance papers by bribing an official. In
the opinion of Elijah Cobb there was more than one way
to skin a cat.

The intolerable aggressions aimed at American commerce,
including the impressment of seamen, had caused
President Thomas Jefferson to use the embargo as a
weapon in reprisal. If he could not protect American
ships and sailors on the high seas, he could, at least, he
thought, save them by keeping them at home. Maritime
New England had been reluctant to accept an embargo
policy. Josiah Quincy had begged Congress to remember
that the ocean could not be abandoned by his people âof
whom thousands would rather see a boat-hook than all
the sheep-crooks in the world.â However, the first Embargo
Bill was passed in December of 1807, forbidding
the departure of American vessels for any foreign port.
The results were futile and disastrous. Ports filled with
dismantled ships, counting-houses deserted, grass growing
in the waterside streets failed to affect perfidious
Albion. Nevertheless, the embargo was tried again in
the spring of 1812.

Captain Cobb was loading flour at Alexandria, Virginia,
for a European voyage when the news of another
embargo came like a blow from a clear sky. Hard-bitten
New Englander, he had refused to heed the warnings.
His own Massachusetts Legislature had denounced such
Acts of Congress as unconstitutional, and a hundred
towns had adopted resolutions of protest. However, Mr.

[Pg 12]

Madisonâs latest embargo was a condition and not a
theory, so Elijah Cobb made haste to get to sea before
the officials could lawfully stop him. He had twenty-four
hours of grace. A gale of wind was blowing, so
violent that the ship was almost torn away from the
wharf. Here was the efficient shipmaster in actionâa
hundred tons of stone ballast to be landed, three thousand
barrels of flour to be stowed in the hold and secured,
provisions, wood, and water to be taken aboard,
a crew to be found and signed on, and the vessel cleared
at the custom house.

Elijah Cobb turned the trick without bluster or confusion.
It was the kind of thing he could do extremely
well. His portrait is that of a man very resolute and
composed, not much humor in the straight mouth and
steadfast eye, a good deal of the Puritan afloat. In his
sedate way he must have enjoyed what he called ârunning
away from the Embargo.â

England and the United States were on the brink of
war. This final embargo was frankly intended as a
preparation for war. It held American ships in our own
ports and saved them from capture while a swift pilot
schooner was sent to warn American merchantmen in
northern Europe that hostilities impended and they must
hasten home or lie up abroad in some neutral harbor.
These signs and portents seemed to have escaped the
notice of Captain Elijah Cobb. He was oddly unaware
of it all, busied with selling his flour in Cadiz at a profit
and buying British bills of exchange to reap more dollars.

[Pg 13]

Congress had formally declared war, on June 18,
while Captain Cobb was in the midst of his transactions.
And when he sailed from Cadiz for Boston, on July
5, âhe never felt himself saffer, on account of enemies
on the high seas.â Peacefully he jogged across the Atlantic,
as far as the Grand Bank, when he was overhauled
by a British armed schooner. The subsequent
proceedings must upset the conventional notions of the
sea warfare of bygone days. All British seamen are presumed
to have been ruffianly and outrageous persons. It
will be noted that the interviews between Captain Cobb
and his captors were conducted with courtesy and
friendliness.

The merchant skipper was pained and surprised to
find that he had fallen into the enemyâs hands. The
enemy endeavored to make it as comfortable as possible,
trusting that Captain Cobb would âexcuse their inquisitiveness.â

You will find the dialogue vastly entertaining and
not at all as the fictionist would fancy it. Mutual regrets
and esteem, the prize politely ordered to St. Johns,
the prisoners to be made as comfortable as possible under
the circumstances! And then it is your pleasure to meet
that fine old Port Admiral of St. Johns, Sir John
Thomas Duckworth, who tried to make these unwilling
visitors feel at home. âSupercargoes and Gentlemen
passengersâ were set at liberty.

The display of gentlemanly feeling between sailor
foemen was not unique in the annals of the War of

[Pg 14]

1812. England was well aware that the maritime interests
of the New England coast were out of sympathy
with the war and it was policy to avoid provoking them
more than possible. âOrganize a peace party throughout
your Country,â resolved the Massachusetts House of
Representatives, after war had been declared, âand let
the sound of your disapprobation be loud and deep.â The
climax came with the secretly seditious Hartford Convention.
The Federalist opposition was stupidly blind to
the fact that the war was a defensive struggle against
the massed resources of the British Empire. The seafaring
population, forgetting the national interests and
suffering destruction and blockade, allowed the politicians
to lead it by the nose.

Captain Elijah Cobb stayed at home on the farm until
the end of the war. Then he resumed his voyages to
Europe, uneventfully, and engaged in the African trade
in 1818, commanding the ship
Ten Brothers
. There
was no worse pest hole on earth than the West Coast
and its slave ports, no area so indelibly stained with
manâs inhumanity to man. A land of treacherous surf
and steaming jungle, of tawny beaches and sluggish
rivers, the infamies of centuries cursed the names of
Goree and Gambia, the Bight of Benin and the Bight of
Biafra, Calabar, Anamaboe, and the Congo. In 1819
the slave trade had been outlawed by England and the
United States, but many thousands of the poor wretches
were annually smuggled into the West Indies and the
southern ports of this country.

[Pg 15]

The barracoons and factories were flourishing when
Captain Cobb sailed on his lawful trading voyages to
Princeâs Island in the Gulf of Guinea. Like many another
American shipmaster he risked the deadly fever in
order to sell his goods to the natives and carry home palm
oil, ivory, coffee, and gold dust. The most lucrative traffic
was in New England rum, muskets, and gunpowder,
but Captain Cobb makes no mention of these as in his
invoice, and it is fair to give him the benefit of the
doubt. Not that it would have discredited him in the
reputable circles of Boston or Brewster. A man could
be a deacon and still peddle Medford rum to the benighted
Africans.

Captain Cobb stocked his ship with the customary
trade goods, gaudy cotton prints, tobacco, beads and brass
pots, bandana hankerchiefs, flour and meal, salt beef,
pork, and fish, candles, tinware, and crockery. His letters
are pretty doleful reading. Several other American vessels
were with him at Princeâs Island, their captains ill
or dead of fever, his own ship rotten with it. What they
called fumigation was crude and ineffectual. They suffered
grimly. It was all in the dayâs work, and they
could only commit themselves âto a mercifull just God
who always acts for the good of his Creaturs, & happy
would it be for us; if we could always bow with humble
submission to His righteous dispensations.â

Even this consolation was not enough to make Captain
Cobb endure more than two voyages to the Guinea
Coast. His ship had to be scuttled at a Boston wharf, so

[Pg 16]

foul she was with deadly fever, and there was fear that
the contagion might spread ashore. This was the end of
his seafaring career of nearly forty years. To a ripe old
age he dwelt in Brewster, a distinguished citizen and
active farmer, âtall & straight of fine figure his face
very pleasant to look upon.â The imperious traits of the
quarter-deck were carried into his religious activities. As
a Universalist he played a lone hand for some years, and
âmet with violent opposition to his views, yet waxing
only the more valiant in the fight, he came off conquerer.â

It is the wistful desire of every true sailorman to quit
the restless sea and own a farm. This boon was vouchsafed
Elijah Cobb and it is fitting to bid him farewell
when âthe wind has got around to the southâ and he is
just returning from a visit to the young orchardâa mellowed
old gentleman who had lived through the most
stirring era of American ships and sailors and had survived
hazards innumerable to find a quiet harbor! Not a
flamboyant career, but splendidly competent as one reads
between the lines. He was one of the pioneers, blood
brother of the men who turned landward to tame the
wilderness.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

The following Biographical sketch; with a few of
the incidents of my life, are committed to paper,
for the gratification, and amusement of my beloved
Grand-children. Considering the advanced
age of the writer, on the brink of 75, it
must be expected, there will be imperfections,
of various kindsâthe old mans trembling hand
is conspicuous at first sightâbut even that, may
interest, when the reader reflect, that the hand
which penâd these lines, is now mouldering in
Dust.

I
n
the year 1802, I was in Yarmouth, a sea port,
in the East of England; and by one of those
casual events of life, was favoured with an interview
with an aged Gentleman, a Port admiral, by
the name of Isaac Cobbâlea[r]ning, that I was
an American, and my name Cobb, he expressed a
desire to know the names of my ancestors, as far
back as I could recolect; I could only give him, to
my great G
r.
Father Jonathan Cobbâhe then told
me, that it was clear to him, that my ancestor originated
from Harwich in England, that he had been
at the seat, where he was born, many times,âthat

[Pg 18]

Silvanus Cobb, had 4 sons. viz Jonathan, Eleazer,
Silvanus, & Benjamin, that the two first named
embarked for America in the May Flower
[1]
that
Silvanus followed them some 2 or 3 years after;
& that Benjamin remained with his Father untill
he died, & then followed his Brothers to America.

He then produced a very lengthy Biography of
several generations, & read many particulars of the
Cobb families, and among themâthat Jonathan,
son of Silvanus, setled upon Cape CodâEleazer,
somewhat further westwardâ& Silvanus, some
distance north of Bostonâand that I was, no
doubt, a decendant from Jonathan.

The old gentlemen ordered his secretary, to
make a copy, of such parts of the biography, as related
to my ancestry, but circomstances obliged me
leave, before I received it.

So much for Admiral Cobb.

Ancestry

I remember, perfectly well, when I had five
Grand Parents alive, 4 on my Fathers side, & one,
on my Mothersâviz. my Great Gâd Father & gâd
Mother Cobbâmy Grand Father & gâd Mother
Cobb, & my Gâd Mother Freeman, my Mothers
Mother, I cannot trace my ancestry beyond my

[Pg 19]

Great gâd Father Cobbâthere were three, of his
family, which I perfecty rememberâviz. Jonathan,
Eleazer, & Benjaminâthe female part, I
have no knowledge ofâmy Gâd Fathers family
consisted of 10 children, 6 sons, & 4 daughters,
viz Elijah, Scottow, Isaac, John, Seth, Elkanah,
Mary, Sally, Hannah, Betseyâmy Grandmother

only child, & was only 12 years old when her
Father diedâat 17 she marreid my Father, Scottow
Cobb, their family consisted of 6 children,
viz. Huldah, Barna, Elijah, Reliance, Judith, &
Sallyâthree, have already paid the debt of nature;
& the united ages of the three alive, is 224
years.

My Father persued a seafaring life for subsistance;
was Master of a Brig, & died on his passage
from Cadiz to Quebec, in the 33
d
year of his ageâleaving
my Mother with 6 infant children, the
oldest but 10 years of age, and the youngest, born
after Father left home, the last time,âFor the
support of this helpless flock; was a small cape cod
farm, a small house & barn, and one cowâI have

[Pg 20]

heard my Mother say, that she never received
100$ for my Fathers effectsâ

Under such circomstances; it was not posible to
keep the family togetherâto support & educate
them, with the means in her power, was out of the
questionâsome of us, must leave the perternal
dwelling & seek subsistance among strangersâmy
Bro
r.
, being the Elder, was tried first, but wouâd
not stay, & came home cryingâI was then, in my
6
th
year, & althoâ too young to earn my living, a
place was offered me, & I left my dear mother
for that subsistance among strangers which she
could not procure for me.

I continued from my Mother, except at times
visiting her, untill in my 13
th.
year, when by an
imprudent attempt, to lift beyond my strength, I
broke a vessell in my stomack, which entirely disenabled
me; and I was sent home to my Mother,
incapable of labour of any kind.

I remained with her; under the care of a skilfull
Docter, about a year, when he advised me, to
be sent to sea, as the best method to regain my
health.

Seeks a Voyage

Accordingly, in the fall of 1783, I was fitted
out for Boston, to look for a voyageâMy whole
wardrobe, was packed in a gin case, for a trunk; a
tow bedsack, filled with rye straw, & a pair of,

[Pg 21]

home-made, blankets, for sleeping appuratis, with
two bushels of corn, to pay my passage to Bostonâand
acquipted thus, I left the family circle, with
buoyant sperits and in full confidence that I should
work myself throâ life, with honour & creditâI
embarked, at Skaket, in a small Schooner of only
25 Tons, called the
Creture
; & after going into
Provinctown, & laying there during a gale of
wind, we reached Boston, in about three days.

At the time, I am speaking of, there were more
men, than could readily find employ, & frequently,
the best of seamen, were distitute of voyagesâseveral
of our neighbouring young men,
had been to Boston, that fall, previous to my leaving
home, & had returned without giting employ,
they told my Mother, that I would only spend the
two bushels of corn, & return to her without giting
a voyageâbut their predictions were set at
naught; for the first time I went down the long
wharf, & stood gazeing at a new vessell, wondering,
& admiring her monstrous size, her great
cables & anchors &câa gentleman stept from her
deck & thus accosted me! My lad, do you want a
voyageâ. Yes Sirâwill you go with me in this
vessellâwhere are you bound Sirâto SiranamâI
am told Sir, that all flesh die, that go thereâwell
my boy, to prove, that you have not been told

[Pg 22]

the truth, I have been there 13 voyages, & you see
Iâm alive yetâwell Sir, I should like to go, what
wages will you allow meâdo you know how to
cookânot much Sir, but I can soon learnâwell
my boy, if you think so, I presume you will, I like
your candour & will take you, & give you the customary
wages of a boy; half of Seamens wages
$3.50 p
r
month, but you must go immediately on
board, & git dinner for the men at workâ& thus
I commenced my duty as cook & cabin Boy.

When the men broke off work, at night, they all
went away; the Cap
t.
then asked me, where my
bed & cloaths wereâI told him, on board the creture,
in town dockâwell, you must go & git them,
& Iâll keep ship untill you return, you must sleep
on board to nightâwho else will sleep on boardânobody,
there is no one belongs to the vessell, except
you & myselfânot liking the idea of sleeping
on board alone, I took the liberty of asking him,
where his mate wasâhe said, he had not got one
yetâI told him, I
gessed
, I knew a good man,
that would like to goâwho is heâI said, My
Uncle, who came up, in the creture to look for a
voyageâhas he ever been mateâYes Sir, & prise
mastre too, in the warâwell, you go after your
things, & if you see your Uncle, ask him to come
down & see me, in the morning when I got on

[Pg 23]

board the creture, my Uncle was there, and by
way of a reprimand, asked, where I had been all
dayâwhy Uncle, said I, I have shipped myself,
& I beleive I have got a voyage for you also.

Voyage to Surinam

To make a short story, my Uncle went down in
the morning, & shipped & went the voyage.âI
then wrote to my Mother, that I had got a voyage
for myself & Uncle, & if those young men would
come to Boston before I sailed, I would ship them
off, rather than have them stay at home Idle, &
upon expense all winter.

The vessell was soon loaded, & we went to seaâmy
inexperienc, & being very sea-sick, for a
while, rendered my situation very unpleasant, but
I soon surmounted those deficulties; & began to
injoy my new mode of life; after the opperation
of David Jonesâs medecine (sea-sickness) I felt
my health improved, & by the time we arrived in
Surinam, I felt quite well, and I found I was able
to give pritty good satisfaction in my line of duty.

My perticular attention to the officers, procured
me some presents, by wh I was enabled to
purchase a Barrel of molasses, & some fruit, for
an adventure back to Boston.

Nothing meterial took place, during the remainder
of the voyage, worth noting; we returned
to Boston in the spring of 1784, discharged our

[Pg 24]

cargo, mollases, was paid our wages & seperated,
each to home. My wages amouted to 21$, & by
the sale of my bbl of Molases, & some my fruit,
I was enabled to git myself a new suit of sailors
cloaths, from the Slopshop, & carried home, & put
into my Mothers hands, 20 silver Dollarsâprobably,
the largest sum of money she had posses
d.

since she had been a widowâ& that, from her
poor little sick Boyâher tears flowed freely, upon
the occasion, but they were tears of gratitude to
our heavenly Father, for his mercies to her child,
in permitting his return home, in the injoyment of
so much better health, than he left itâmy own
feelings, upon the occasion, can be better imagined
than discribed.

I tarried at home but a short time, before I returned
to Boston, in persuit of employ; & spent
the summer, with a Cap
t.
Lombard, in the coasting
business. In the fall I shipped, as a common sailor,
& made several voyages to the W. Idiesâreturning
from a voyage, in Dec
r.
1786, I was informed
that my Brother, had fallen from mast-head, in
the Delaware Bay, had Broken both his legs, one
thigh, & put out of joint, one shoulderâand was
then, in the Pensalvinia hospital, with one leg amputated.

The Season was then so far advanced, that the

[Pg 25]

navigation, was about closing with Ice, consequently,
I was compelled to relinquish my visit, to
my unfortunate Brother, untill the spring opened
the navigation.

Prehaps you will ask! why, Gâd Father did not
go on by landâbut, my dear G. children, the
mode of traveling then, was quite different from
now, we had no railroads, no, steam conveyance,
and scarcly, a carriageâeven the mail, was carried
upon horsesâa stage coach was not knownâ

Brotherly Love

I consequently, engaged a birth, for the spring,
with my uncle John Cobb, in the employ of Benj
a

Cobb & Sons, of Boston, in the Philadelphia trade,
went home, & attended School, about 2 months,
when I was callâd upon, to go on to Boston by land
to join the vessell. I accordingly started, in company
with 3 others, for the same object, & walked
to Boston. We there joined the vessell, loaded her,
& saild for Philadelphiaâon our arrival, I procured
a permit, as soon as posible, & visited
my poor Brother in the hospitalâaffectionate
Brothers & Sisters, can better imagine, our feelings
at meeting, than I can discribe itâsuffice it to
say, he was not well anough, to leave the hospital
then, but tâwas thought he wouâd be, by our next
tripâour trips, only took up about a month, & according

[Pg 26]

the next time, he came on with us to Boston,
& I sent him home to our Mother.

I continued in the employ of B. C. & Sons, about
a year, when they premoted me to the office of
mateâand in that capacity I served them, under
many different captains, between 6 & 7 years, untill
I felt myself qualifi
d.
to command a vessel, & seeing
no disposition on their part to indulge me, I
left the employ; went to Baltimore, & made two
voyages to Europe, in the capacity of 1
st.
mate of
a shipâafter which, I returned to Boston; and
got the command of a Brig, in the employ of
Edw
d.
& Will
m.
Reynoldsâ

Captured by the French

After making several voyages, to Virginia, &
one to the West Idies; in April 1793, I went to
the cape, & got married; I was then in my 25
th.

yearâ. I continued in the employ of the Mess
rs.

Reynoldsâs; principally in the virginia trade, about
two years longer, when they concluded to send
me, on a voyage to Europeâtheir object was, to
cadiz; but at that time, the algerines were at war
with America; & it was reported, that their crusiers
were outside of the streights of Gibaralterâin
consequence, it was recommended that I should
clear my vessell for Curruna, a northern port in
spain, and there essertain, whether it would be
safe, to proceed to CadizâI was however, spared

[Pg 27]

the trouble of enquirry, by falling in, with a
French Frigate, who captur
d
, & sent me to France.
x x x x & here commences my first trouble &
anxiety, as a ship Masterâhaving under my
charge, a valuable vessell & cargo, inexperienced
in businessâcarried into a foreign port, unacquainted
with the language, no American consel,
or merchant to advise withâand my reputation,
as a ship master, depending upon the measures I
persued &c &c.

The time, that I arrived in France, was during
the french Revolution, and in the
bloody
reign of
Robertspeireâall was arnachy & confusionâthe
galliotine, in continual opperation, & their streets
& publick squars, drenched with human bloodâI
minuted down, 1000 persons, that I saw beheaded,
by that
infernal
machine; and probably saw, as
many more, that I did not note down, men,
women, preists & laymen, of all agesâand finally,
before I left the country; I saw Robertspeirs head
taken off, by the same MachineâBut, to return to
my induvidual, and embarised affairsâall my
papers, relative to my ship & voyage, had been
taken from me, on board the Frigate, at sea; I
concluded they were put in possession of the prise
Master, who brought me in, but he, was not to be
found; neither could I find any clue to my papers,

[Pg 28]

and without them, I could not prove, any demand
for redress upon the government, for their violation
of our neutralityâit was true, my vessel was
there; but her cargo, Flour & Rice, was taken out,
& was daily made into bread, soups, &c &c, for the
half starved, populaceâand without papers, I
could not, even substanciate my claim to an empty
shipâthey meerly condecended, to send me to a
Hotell, to board; & those of my ships crew, that
were sent in with me, were also, provided for.

In this very unpleasant perdicerment I remained
about six weeksâI had, however, in that
time, written to the american charge des affairs at
Paris, & received an answer, but it contained nothing
definite, he regreted my situation, & that of my
countrymen generally, in France, & that it was
owing to the disorganized state of affairs in the
country; and that, I must exercise patiance, & the
government w
d.
do what was right in time.

In about six weeks, as before observed, I was
called upon, at my lodgings, by an officer, of the
tribunal of commerce, bringing, a copy of the
judgment, of said tribunal, upon my vessel and
cargo, & a linguister to explain it to me.

Thus, had they tried me, & passed sentance
without my hearing, or even knowing that I was

[Pg 29]

on trialâbut, in that way, all business was managed
in France at that time.

The decision of the tribunal, was, however, so
favourable, that it gave a spring to my feelings, &
a sensation that gave new life.

A Promise to Pay

They declared, my vessell & cargo, to be new-trial
property; & that, as the cargo was at
my
disposition,
I should be paid for it, by the government,
at the prices that might be fixed upon, by
myself & the agent of the government, and an
adequate endemnification, for my capture, detention,
expenditures &c &c

I was then waited upon, to the agent of marine,
to sell my cargo; when it is presumed, there was
not a pound, of the flour, or rice in existanceâand
after battleing, in words, three days in succession,
we fixed the prices, as follows, vizâFlour $16.50,
& Rice $5.50âthis, was a good begining, being
over 200 p
r
cent on the invoice.

but a long altercation now insueâd, relative to
the paymentâmoney, was out of the question, for
if they had it, to pay, there was a law against
bringing it away from the countryâgoods, also,
were out of the question, as well as bills on England
or Americaâfinally, I agreed to take, government
Bills of exchange, on Hamburg, payable
60 days after date, and was promised, by the

[Pg 30]

Agent; that I should have my bills, in 12 or 14
daysâI waited patiently a month, but no bills
came; & finding that no confidence could be placed
in their promises, & feeling doubtfull, as to obtaing
any thing for my Cargo; I thought it advisable
to send my vessell home, under charge of
the mateâconsequently, I ballased her, & sent her
away; writing to my owners, that I was determ
d.

to persevere, untill I obtained satisfaction.

My mind being releived, from seing my vessell
laying Idle, & at great expense; I came to the determination
of going to head quarters, Parisâbut
many deficulties were to be surmounted, in order
to attain this objectâ1
st.
the road was dangerous
to travail; the adherents of royalty, were reduced
to mere scurmaging parties, that committed their
depradations under cover of the night, in solitary
places, upon travellers, & the peaceble inhabitantsâand
as all horses were taken into requisition by
the government, except those that convey
d.
the
national dispatches; there was no other mode of
travelling; and it was conterary to law, for them
to take a passengersâbut my mind was fixed
upon going, as the only chance of ever accomplishing
my business with the French government. I
therefore called upon the Minister of Marine, &
got an official copy, of my demands on the government,

[Pg 31]

and had them recorded (a precautionary
measure) as I had lea[r]ned, that loseing a mans
papers, was one of their methods of procrastination,
to keep far off a settlement.

After this, I procured an interpreter, & waited
upon
Jean Con. S
t.
Andre
, a man, holding high
offices under the Government, & reported to be,
favourably disposed to Americansâto him I made
known my situationâthe treatment I had received,
the praplexity I was inâ& the necessity of
going to Parisâ& praying him, not only to grant
me a pasport, but to grant a special permitt, to one
of the Coureirs, to carry me thereâafter a long
demur, with himself, & repeatedly feeling of his
neck, to see how it would bear the knife; he returned
a favourable replyâviz. that I must call
upon him the next day, when he would make the
necessary arrangments &c

On to Paris

Accordingly, in two days, I was underway for
Paris, in one of the national coureirs with government
dispatches, the Master of which, did not
speak one word of English, & myself, but a few
words of French, of course, we were not
very
sociableâwe
were furnished, each with a pair of pistals,
with a blunderbus, loaded, in front, our carraige,
was musquet shot proof, except in front;
drove, by a postilion outside with from 5, to 9

[Pg 32]

horses, according to the road, which at best, was
very indifferent.

And thus we drove on, Jehu like, without stoping,
except to exchange horses, & mail; taking
occasionally, as we run, a mouthfull of bread, and
washing it down, with some low prised, red Burgendy
wineâas to sleep, I did not git one wink
during the journey, of 684 miles. But
la maitre
de les despach
, would sleep, during the day, pitching
about the carriage, for the roads were very
rough, to my very great anoyanceâbut, during
the night, his anxiety kept
him
awake, through
fear, althoâ we had a guard, of, from 12 to 24,
mouted horsmen each night, from sunset, to sunrise,
to preceed, & followâand as a demonstration,
that the precaution was necessary, on the 2
d

morning, after leaving Brewst, just before our
gaurds left us, we witnessed a scene, that filled us
with horrow.âthe remains, of a Coreir, laying in
the road, the Master, the Postilion, & 5 horses laying
dead, & mangled by it, & the mail mutalated
& scatered in all directions. We were informed,
afterwards, that the Coureir, was without an
gaurd, that the evening previous; there was an
alarm in the visinity, that had called out, all their
fources to supress, consequently, at the last stage,
there was none to supply; & it was death by law,

[Pg 33]

for national despatches to stop, therefore, the
Master proceeded, without a guard, and met the
fate, as discribed.

The next night, at about sun-setting we came to
a stage, where we expected to receive our guard, &
there was none for us, however, the next stage,
was only five miles, & not considered very dangerous;
we therefore proceeded on, athoâ not without
great anxiety; & preparation of our fire arms,
in case of an attact.

A Word of English

In the very neat village of Alan[âc]on, in Normondy,
I had the first, & only, word of English,
sporken to me, during the journey, we stopped to
exchange horses & mail, when the
Maitre
, as usual,
was called to an account for having a passenger, &
a foreigner too, in the Coureir; and while he was
making his justification, shewing pasports &c; a
man in a tattered uniform, came up to the door of
the Carraige, & reaching out his hand, said in quite
good english; for the love of God, my dear Sir,
do permitt me to shake hands, with one, who
comes from that country, where, the
great
, and
beloved Washington residesâhe only had time to
say, âthat he went to America with, la Fayettee,
and had the honour of having served under the

best man God ever made
, even the great Washington.

[Pg 34]

Nothing interesting took place untill we reached
Paris. It was at 4
[o:]
Clock, of a beautifull June
morning, that the Carriage stopped before the
gate of Hotel de Boston, & the bell rung, having
been just 74 hours from the gates of Brestâduring
which time, I had not lost myself in sleep,
taken nothing warm upon my stomack, nor used
water, upon either hands or faceâthus covered
with dust, & exhausted with fateague; I was received
by the Porter, conveyed to a chamber,
provid
d.
with washing apparatus, where I soon
freed myself from dust, applied clean linnen, and
ensconsâd myself in an excellent Bed, saying to
myself,
soul take thine ease in sleep
âbut, it appeared,
that sleep had departed from me, I laid
untill the clock struck 10, without being able to
obtain a doze, & then rose, & attended, throâ the
day, to finding out a train of my business, through
the American Consul &c, retired to Bed again at
9
[o:]
Clock, heard the Clock strike 12, and knew
nothing after, untill 11
[o:]
Clk the next day; when
awoke, feeling like myself again; although I slept
very sound the next night, for 9 hours without
awaking.

Hope Deferred

After essertaining where to apply, my first object
of attention was, to scearch for my Accounts,

[Pg 35]

sent on from Brestâthe result was, they denied,
at all the offices, ever having received them, or
heard of such a Brig, as the Jane, nor of her comander,
Cap
t.
Cobbâwell, âas I before observed, I
prepared for this event, before I left Brewst; by
procuring a copy of my Accounts &c &c, accordingly
I laid an official set before them, and thus
introducing the
Jane
, & her commanderâI was
told, to call the next day, & they would let me
know, when my Bills wouâd be ready. I therefore,
was obliged to exercise patiance & wait; but when
I called the next day, my papers were not to be
found in the officeâno one had put them away,
no one could tell any thing about themâand finally,
after a long French jabber, it was concluded,
that they must have been left upon the
counter, brushed off, & burned, among the lose
papers.

This was too much, for my already perplexed,
agitated, mind. I knew of no way, but to write back
to Brest, for another setâ& they, probably, wou
d.

meet the same fate, as the two preseeding ones had.
I was now fully conveinced, that the whole was
designed, for the purpose of procrastination & putting
off pay day as long as possibleâbut it was a
severe trial for me, in my inexperienced state. I

[Pg 36]

consulted with our consul; & with our Minister at
the court of France, but the only satisfaction was;
git another set of papers, & we will guard against
another lossâ

While seting, with writing meterials before me
in my chamber, in the act of writing for another
set of papersâa French gentleman, who occopied
the next room, & who spoke good English, passed
my door; I asked him in, & related to him my
greivancesâafter he had thought for a few moments;
he advised me, to endevour to obtain an
interveiw with Roberspeire, & make known to him
my greivances; assuring me that he was partial to
Americans, & had no doubt, but he would give me
such advice as would be servicable to meâBut, I
asked, will he, the leader of this nation, condesend
to listen to a private induvidual, & interpose, in
meely, a commercial transactionâyes, if the business
is managed right, I am confident he will. But,
how shall I obtain an interveiwâsimply by writing
him a billet yourself, in the republican stile,
an American cetizen, to citizen Roberspeire, &
send it by a servant of the Hotel, requesting an
interview upon business.

Interview with Robespierre

After duly considering upon the subject, I
wrote the following, & sent it by servant.

[Pg 37]

An American citizen, captured by a French Frigate
on the high seas, requests, a personal interveiw; & to lay
his greivances before citizens Roberspeire.

Very respectfully

E. Cobb

In about an hour, I received the following note,
in his own hand writing.

I will grant Citizen Cobb an interveiw to morrow at
10 A M.

Roberspeire

This, gave a spring to my feelings, and banished
that depression which had held me in chains, for
some days previous. I was puntual to the timeâsent
my name up, & was admitted into the presence
of the great man. He pointed me to a seat without
speaking; there was one man, only, in the Hall,
an enterpreter, who told me that, Citizen Roberspeire
whished me, to commince my relation, at the
time of my capture, and to tell the whole, up to
this timeâI accordingly proceeded; and, throâ
the interpreter, related my Capture & treatment,
up to that timeâupon my closing the detail; with
a waive of Roberspeires hand, the interpreter left
the hall, and he, Râe, began conversing with me,
in very good English, questioning me, upon some
perticcular points, of the former conversation; but

[Pg 38]

more perticurly, about the loss of my papers, since
I arrived in Parisâfinally, he told me to call at
an office, in Rue S
t.
Honorie, called the office of
the 2
d
department, &
demand
my papers, I told
him, that I had been there repeatedly, & that I
was forbid to enter the office again, upon my telling
him that, he exclaimed.
Sacra coquin
âgo, said
he, to that office, & tell cetizen F. T., that you
came from Râe, and if he does not produce your
papers, & finish your business
immediately
, he will
hear from me again, in a way not so pleasing to
him. Observing at the same time, that he regreted
that
his name
should be made use of, in a mercantile
transaction, but that my case, absolutely demanded
it.

I tendered my greatfull thanks for his services,
& left him; after receiving his injunctions, to call
& let him know how I succeededâI went direct to
the afores
d.
office; and, by the previledge of making
use of Roberspeirs name, I was kindly rec
d.
an
opology made, for former abuses, and my business
compleated the next dayâbut as my exchanges
were drawn, payable sixty days after date, & the
tribunal had decred, demurage &c, untill I received
my Bills, I refused to receive them in
Paris, as my pay wouâd then stop, but insisted on
their being sent to the agent in Brest agreable to

[Pg 39]

contractâmy object was, not to receive them untill
12 or 15 days before they were due, consequently
I remained in Paris about 3 weeks after
my bills were sent to Brest. and during that time,
the great man, who had so assentially befreinded
me, was beheaded by the Galliotine.

Various Pleasant Towns

This event, very meterially changed the aspect
of affairs in France; my exchanges, which before,
I could have readily sold at par value, now, would
not bring 50
cts.
on the dollarâthis induced me, to
go on to Hamburg with them myself & know the
result; and having a desire to see more of the
country, & could travell, principally, at the expence
of the nation, having full time, before my
bills wouâd become dueâI took my seat in the accomodation
stage for Burdeaux, visited that City,
tarried 5 days, again started, visited Nantes, Loreong,
[2]

& various pleasant towns in La Vanda,
[3]
& arrived
at Brest, 20 days before my bills were due.

The agent of Merine, expressed a little disapprobation
at my not calling before for my Bills,
having had them about 20 daysâbut I setled with
him, quite amicably; and found a small vessell,
bound direct for Hamburg, in her, I secured a

[Pg 40]

passage, & embarked 3 days after. We had a long
passage, but I arrived the next day after my bills
became due.

Welcome Advice

And here, I will relate, one of those casual
events, which frequently take place, to the benifit
of manâthe vessell in which I took passage,
stopped at Gluxstad, a town on the river Elbe,
about 30 miles below Hamburg; the Captain &
myself went on shore, & engaged a carraige to take
us up to the City; but night overtaking us before
we reached it, the gates were shut & we could not
enter (the gates were always shut at sunsetting, &
upon no occasion, were opened untill sun-rise)
consequently, we turned back, about a mile, to the
Danish city of Altony, where put up for the night,
at a famous Hotel, & there I found a number of
american ship Masters merchants &c; at the supper
table, various questions were asked me, by which
they learned that I was from France, that I came
as a passenger; but I discovered that curiosity was

wide awake
to know my businessâI, however,
thought proper, to keep that to myself; having my
fears, relative to my Billsâafter riseing from the
supper table, a gentleman came to me, & asked me
into his room; being seated; he introduced himself
as follows.âI am Sir, an american, from
New York, my name is Loyle, I noticed the curiosity

[Pg 41]

of our countrymen, at the supper table, to
know your business; & Sir, I was pleased to notice
your prudent reservation, upon the subjectâI do
not ask you; but conjecture what it is, and if it is,
as I think; I can be of service to you, by way of
advice, probably.âmy conjecture is, that you have
French government Bills on their agent in Hamburg;
if so, I advise you, to let no man know it,
but go & present your demands, in person; otherwise,
they will be protested; for their agent De
Ã§hapeaurouge, has already been prosecuted, for
paying French claims, I think, therefore, if you
conveince him, that no one but yourself, is privy
to the transaction, that he may pay them. I tended
to M
r.
Loyle my thanks, for his information &
left him, and the next morning, I entered the city,
and by enquiry soon found the office of the said
agent, & presented my Billâhe cast his eye upon
it, without speaking, then gave me a very scrutenizing
look, & said, how came you in possession
of this draftâI received, Sir, from M. V. la Fontaine,
Minister of Marine at Brestâdid you receive
it in person, or throâ other handsâI received
it myselfâhas it been in your possession ever
sinceâit hasâwho are your freinds in this cityâI
have none, nor even a corispondent, nor ever
was in the city before, &, Sir, your office, is the

[Pg 42]

first, & only building I ever entered in Hamburg,âwhere
did lodge last nightâI now told him,
that I came a passenger from Brewst, that the vessell
stopped at Gluxstaad, that I landed & hired
a carriage to bring me to Hamburg, that we were
too late to enter the city last night, that the driver
landed me in Altona, at Lantsâs Hotel, where I
lodged & Breakfasted this mornâ, that I came
alone into the city, & by enquiry had found his
officeâHe then observed, it is an unusual mode of
negociating bills, it is generally done throâ some
resident merchant, especially by a stranger, like
yourselfâI told him, that in so simple a transaction,
as that of presenting a draft for acceptance, I
felt myself competant to the task, and thereby save
paying a commissionâwell, âsaid he you have
acted discreetly, took a pen & wrote accepted,
across the face of the BillâHe then said; your
money is ready for you; but this draft, must not
go out of my hands again; for if it does, it never
will be paid by me.

This embarrassed me extreemly; what could I
do, with 40,000 crowns in silver, in my situation,
an entire stranger, in a strange City.

After a moments reflection, I said to him, will
you, Sir, give me your due bill, & allow me to receipt
the draftâcertainly, said he, I will; and accordingly,

[Pg 43]

it was done. This, I knew, was exchanging
the obligation, of a great & powerfull nation,
for that of a private induvidual; but I thought,
that circomstances justified the Act.

I then asked him, if he would name to me, a
house of entertainment, frequented by Americans,
& he ordered a servant to conduct me to Lilbons
Hotelâand thus closed the important interveiw
with Deâ chapeaurouge; & I found his
due Bill
, as
good as Cash.

The Ways of Providence

Thus, how fortunate the circomstance of my interveiw
with M
r.
Loyleâbut for his kind information
& advice, I shouâd, no doubt, have put my
draft, into the hands of the American Consul for
collection; the consequence would have been, a
protest; and another tour to France, to seek redress.
And all this saved, by the Gates being shut
before I reached them. How often, my dear
Grand Children, do we repine and murmer, when
disappointment, affliction, and trouble come upon
us; & even distrust the goodness of our Heavenly
Father; when we, very frequently, afterwards,
realize that it was for our good.

It was somewhat so with me, I felt, very much
put out, at the gates being shut, & chided the
driver for his dilatoryness, when he knew the city
gates closed at sun-settâbut this very circomstance,

[Pg 44]

was the means, of freeing my mind from a
burden, which had weighed it down for months,âit
was the means of a happy, and prosperous termination
of my labourous voyageâfor nothing now
remained to be done, but to remitt the funds to
T. Dickerson & Sons, London; & to take passage
for Boston myself, & give an account of my stewardship
to my employers. And all this, I could do,
with bouyant sperits, having made them an excellent
voyage.

I was not long in closing my business in Hamburg,
& took passage for Boston in the ship Warren,
Cap
t.
Hodgkins, where we safely arrived
after a passage of 54 days.

My arrival, gave great relief to my owners, for,
from the accounts they had from France, they
doubted the validity of my Bills on Hamburg, &
expected I wouâd have to return to France.â

The fortunate close of this tedious voyage, and
my return; being the first instance of the kind, under
the then state of things in France, produced,
no small, excitement among the merchants of Boston,
who had property in France; and applications
was continually made to me, for all the whys &
wherefores, relative to the fortunate result of my
business; and the consequence was, it added
greatly to my fame, as a ship master.

[Pg 45]

Another Voyage to France

Another voyage was immediately planed, by my
owners for France, & I was only allowed a very
few days, to visit my family,âalthough, our first
child (now Aunt Sampson) was but 24 hours old
when I left homeâwhen I returnâd, could say,

my par
. But short, endeed, was the time allotted
me, for injoying the objects of my affection, I
must leave them; and persue the road marked
out, for obtaining that subsistance for myself &
family, which nature required, and reason dictated.

After staying at home 4 days only, I returned
to Boston, fitted out my vessel, & sailed for Alexandria,
& there purchased a cargo of Flour &
sailâd for Franceâon my arrival in Harvre de
grace; I found that government purchased all the
flour that came to market Consequently, I sold
my cargo to the governments agent, at 20 crows
p
r
bbl, under a promis, that I shoâd have my pay,
in 40 days after delivery.

But I found, to my sorrow, that no confidence
could be placed in their pledges; & that I was
again subjected, to a tedious altercation with the
agent & his government. After dancing attendance
upon them about 2Â½ months, my vessell, at the
same time, laying Idle & at a great expence, I
again concluded to send her home, under charge

[Pg 46]

of the mate, & stay myself, & fight it out. Accordingly,
I dispatch
d
the Brig, & went on to Paris,
prepared for the seige & expecting a long one.

In about two months more, I received, about
one third of my demand, in Ingots of silver, &
made a trip over to London, & deposited their
amount with, Bird, Savage, & Bird; subject to my
owners orderâI then returned to France, and renewed
my claim for the remainder.

And after about three months more of attendance,
upon the government of France, I received
the ballance due me; about 40,000 Crownsâhere,
probably, you will conclude that my anxiety terminated.
But, on the conterary, it was, if posible, increased.

I had attained the object of 10 months contention
with the french governmentâI had on hand,
a fine voyage for my employersâbut the great
deficulty now was; how I should git the property
out of France. There was a special law, against
exporting
specie
from the country,âexchanges
were not to be obtained, in which my confidence
coulâd be placed; my vessell gone, so that, investing
in goods, was out of the question,âand 40,000
crowns in my sleeping chamber, brought there
publickly, at noon day.

Thus situated, you may judge, whether my

[Pg 47]

mind could be at easeâhowever, after having
taken the necessary precautionary measures against
robery, or theft; I went to work, & purchas
d
all
the
foreign Gold
I could find; in order to git the
value, into a smaller bulk, for the purpose of
smuggling it out of France.

Brings Back Gold

After about two months; by my agents, in Paris
& Roen, & my own, in Harvre de grace, I succeeded
in converting my 40.000 crowns, into less
than 3000 peices of gold, prinsapally, Spanis
doubloonsâthis had been done, in as secret a manner,
as posible.âI then, went to a village, about
3 miles, & ordered 2 leather belts made, of a sufficient
size to hold 8 or 9 hundred peices, and after
puting each peice, into a wrapper of silk paper, I
stowed my belts, & stiched it, in such a manner,
that there could be no motion of the peicesâthe
two belts contained 1700 peicesâthe remainder, I
made up into wads, of about 50 peices each, inveloped
in paper, & cloth.

I then engage my passage for Boston, in the
ship Caroline, Cap
t
Cutter, and after two or three
days, the ship hauled out of the bason, and stopped
opposite the custom house, and within Six rods of
my Lodgings; having free exces to the ship, at
all times, I soon decided, in my mind, how to dispose
of my money, not, contained in the two belts;

[Pg 48]

and in a short time, it was safely & secretly stowed
away on board the ship. On the morning of the
day, on which the ship was to sail, I made interest
with the ships Steward, to put one of the Belts
round his waist, by the promis of a guinia, & wear
it, untill we were clear from the peir head, the
other belt, I secured to my own person,âand
thus curcomstanced I had to submitt to the scearch
of 8 french officers at the head of whom, was an
old experi-
d.
Scearcher, who strongly suspected
that there was money on board.âBut notwithstanding
all, I got off clear with my money, and
after a passage of 35 days, I had the satisfaction
of delivering it to my owners in Boston.

On my return home, I found that my pertner,
in lifes voyage, had run me in debt, for a cape
Cod farm; and as the place was distitute of a suitable
building, for the accommodation of our little
family, it was thought advisable to proceed to
errect one, the following season; I consequently,
felt myself under the necesity of declining business,
in the sea-faring line, and attend to that of
a more domestic nature, for a whileâI remained
at home, from August 1798âuntill Sep
t.
1799âand,
as the events of this year, are something remarkable,
I will name a few of them.

This year 1799, the beloved Washington, the

[Pg 49]

Father of our Country died,âthis year, our first
son was bornâthis year I took possession of the
farm, built my house, and the family moved into
it on new years day 1800.

In Octo
r.
1799 I took charge of the Brig Mary,
went to Savannah, in Georgia, from that to Lisbon,
from thence to London, to Rotterdam, Copenhagen,
S
t.
Petersburg, and back to Bostonâand
performed the voyage, in 8 months & 4
daysâ

Commands the Monsoon

After remaining at home, a shot time, I received
a letter, offering me the charge of a new
ship called the Monsoon, I accordingly repaired
to Boston & took charge of herâshe was owned
by the following company; Mess
r.
Hayden & Baxter,
M
r.
Joshua Hall, & Jacob Tidd, they put on
board a valuable Cargo, & ordered me to find a
Market for it in some part of the north of Europe,
but as I had, in the cargo, a quantity of American
Rum, they recomended that I shouâd touch into
Ireland, upon the supposition that if I couâd obtain
permission to land it that it would command
a high price.

I accordingly made the best of my way for
Cork, and after a passage of 26 days arriv
d.
at the
Cove of Cork, this was meerly a harbour, & a village
of a few thousand inhabitantsâI landed &

[Pg 50]

proceeded for the City, which was about 12 miles
above; called upon the House of Jn
o.
& Isaac Carrel
& Co. to whoom I had a letter of introductionâthey
received me very politely, but doubted my
obtaining permission to land the rum, even if I
was willing to pay foreign duty. They, however,
went with me to the custom house, to consult with
the collector, who, I found was in favour of landing
it; but dare not give permission, without consulting
his superiors in office, and said he wouâd
attend to it & essertain in a few days.

I returned on board my ship in the evening, &
found her in possession of 3 custom house officers,
seized, ship and Carg, with the Kings seal upon
her hatchesâwhen I enquired the cause, I found
it was for having on board sperits, not of the
growth & manufactory of the British plantationsâI
called upon the deputy collector who ordered the
Seizure of the shipâ& he appeared so pleasant
upon the subject that I felt quite a releif. I consequntly
returnâd to the city, & called again upon
the Collector,

In Ireland

He told me, I would have to apply
in person
,
to the Admirallity of Dublin relative to the Seizure
of the shipâ& he at the same time he wouâd
write them relative to landing the sperits. I consequntly,
postâd of for the City of Dublin a journey

[Pg 51]

of about 200 miles, & arrived there without
accident; much amused in traveling throâ the hart
of Ireland, and observing the Irish people, in
their symplicity of manners, and to appearance,
almost, in a state of nature I called upon the board
of Admirallity and after a lengthy investigation,
& I employed council, twas found, that the ship &
cargo, was forfeited to the crown, and was ordered
fourthwith, to be adverti
d
& sold at publick Auctionâ.
It was (however) intimated to me (in private)
this was intended as a
shem
, & that I wouâd
have liberty, to buy ship & Cargo at my own priceâ&
so it proved; for when I returned to Cork, I
found the ship advertised, to be sold in 3 days, I
appeard at the time & place, ship & cargo, with
all appertunances, were set up together, to be sold
for Cash down, some one, freindly to me, bid 2/6âI
then bid 5
s
/. and the whole was struck off to
meâand thus, I was again in possession of ship
and Cargo,

Finding no prospect of obtaining permission to
land the rum, I concluded to proceed elswhere for
a Market for my Cargo, and was advised to try
the Island of Geurnseyâ& therefore applied to
the custom House, to clear the ship, which was
readily complied with; the collector, observed to
me when about taking leave, Cap
t.
Cobb, I must

[Pg 52]

confess, I think your usage has been something
rough here; and I shouâd not blame you, if you
was to help yourself a little, in the way of smuggling.âno
Sir said I, but wouâd you not be one of
the first to make a prize of me thereforâoh said
he, I shouâd have to do my dutyâwell Sir, said
I, when you
Catchâem
you
Habâem
God blesse you
said he, & thus we parted, and the next mornâ I
sailâd; matters were, however, so arrainged, that
between the cove of Cork, & the Scilly Islands,
that I hove overboard Eight hogheads of N. E.
rum, and a pilot boat sheerâd along side, and hove
on board a small bag, which I found contained 264
English guineasâand although I saw them pick
up, & hoist on board the 8 hhds of rum,
I was
satisfied
.

A Hurried Departure

I then proceeded for my Port of distination,
Geurnsey, an Island in the channel of England,
which had always been a free port, & a resort for
Smugglars.âI anchord in the roads about the
suns setting, & having a letter of introduction,
from a friend in Cork, to a merchant there; althoâ
the hour was an improper one,
the dusk of Eve
â,
to deliver a letter of introduction I took my boat
& went on shore, being an entire stranger, I had
to make enquiriesâbut finally, in about an hour,
I found the Gen
m.
to whom the letter was addressed,âhe

[Pg 53]

rec
d.
me with politeness, and read the
letterâI apologised for calling upon him, at so
unseasonable an hour; he promptly replied, it is
fortunate for you, that you have thus done.âI
am now Sir compelled to act a part, which not only
appears
uncivil
, but almost to an insult. Viz, that
you return immediately on board your ship, and
leave this port. He then, in a few words, told me
that, the British parlement, had recently, passed
revenue laws, that affected that Island; & that,
two English cutters, had that day arrived, to inforce
the laws; & that I shouâd certainly have
trouble, with my cargo, if I was not off, before
sun rise, the next morning.âI accordingly bid the
gentleman good bye, repaird to my boat, which
was waiting for me at the wharf, went on board
the ship, & immediately got underway and at sun
rise, the next morn, I was out of sight of the
Island of Geurnsay up channell, on my way for
the City of Hamburg.

Thus ended my deficulties of that voyageâI
arrived safe in Hamburg, found a good Market
for my cargo, loaded my ship, & returned to Boston,
having made a good voyage to all concernâd.

My employers were so well pleased with the
trade, I had opened in Hamburg; that they
planned another voyage immediately, and tho
t.

[Pg 54]

they youâd hardly afford me time to visit my
family at the cape. However, by promisâs of a
short stay, I came to Brewster; saw my family,
and returned to Boston to fit out the ship, for another
Voyage in which, it was concluded, that it
wouâd be for the Interest of the Voyage, that on
my arrival in Hâ
g
I should land my Cargo, load
the ship with a return cargo, & send her home by
my Mate, & remain in Hamburg myself throâ the
Winter, to sell the cargo then landed, and prepare
another for the ship, on her return to me in
the spring.âunder the foregoing arrangement, I
saild for Hamburg a 2
d
time; arrived their after
a common passage, landed my Cargo, loaded the
ship, with Russia & Germain goods, and sent her
for Boston, under the comman
d
of my mate,
David Nickerson.

She sailed, the last of September, and by the
middle of Nov
r
, we were compleatly bound in
fetters of
Frost
, and, in that high Lattitude, we
had only about 7. hours day light in 24. but there
was no lack of
amusements
, to please the eye, tast,
or mind, & I injoyed myself very well, untill the
last of Dec
r.
when I received a letter, which came
overland, by way of Holland, from one of my
employers, in which it was stated in a, Postcrip,

Your wife has been very Sick, but, I beleive, she

[Pg 55]

is better
. This unwellcome intiligence; the uncouth
manner, in which it was conveyed to me;
and the great uncertainty of hearing any thing
more, untill the ship returned to me; put my mind
into a perplexing state of anxiety, which bid defiance
to all injoyment of life.

Anxiety and Illness

Within a few days, as I entered the coffee room,
of the Hotel, one morning, the servant said to me;
there is an american Newspaper, which arrived
last evening, by way of London,âI took up the
paper, and first thing that attracted my notice, was
my
Brothers death
âThus the mind, already
bowed down with anxiety; was obliged to receive
this
heartrending
addition to its already overcharged
burden, but, our heavenly Father, lays no
more upon his children, than, He knows, they can
bear.âfor in addition to my afflixtions then, I was
attacted with the
brain
fever, and with such severity,
that for 8 days, I was unconcious of either
pleasure, or pain.âbut I was, finally, permitted to
recover, with the loss, only, of my full head of
black hair; but I got over that deficuty
pritty
well,
by substituting a Wig, and have been obliged to
wear one ever since, to keep my head warm.âbut
notwithstanding all, I was supported throâ the
winter, my business, by the help of merchants,
Brokers &c, went on well; and when the ship arrived;

[Pg 56]

about the 20
th
of May, I was ready prepared
for her; and the news she bro
t.
me, from
my family, was a cordial to my lasserated feelings.

As soon, as the Cargo which the ship bro
t.
out,
couâd be sold; the arrangements made, during the
winter, were such, that we were soon ready for
returning to Boston,âI reachâd home in Aug
t.
,
having been absent somthing over 14 months,
found Mrs C. very feeble, but convallessent.

I made one more voyage to Hamburg, in the
Monsoon, & when I returnâd she was sold; which
gave me an oppertunity of spending a few weeks
at home, with my beloved family.

But, it was not long, before I received a letter
from M
r.
J. Tidd, who was one of my former
owners in the Monsoon, requesting me to come to
Boston fourthwith, as there was a new Brig for
sale, which he had an idea of purchasing, and
wished for my opinion &c &c.âI accordingly went
to Boston, & the Brig, Sally & Mary, was purchased,
and another Hamburg voyage was plannâd
fourthwith.

Ship
Ten Brothers
.

M
r.
Tidd, had put on board a valuable cargo;
on his own account & risk, and ordered me for
Hamburg; and I accordingly proceeded for the
river Elbe; it being in the summer season, I took
the more direct passage; of north about, so called,

[Pg 57]

viz. between the Okney & Shetland Islands, into
the North sea, at the S E part of which, the river
Elbe comminces; Hamburg is 110 miles aboveâI
had heretofore, always obtained a Pilot, before
I reachâd the entrance of the riverâbut now, none
appeared, and I saw, at anchor, in the mouth of
the river, one large ship, & 2 or 3 smaller vessellsâit
struck me, at once, that the Elbe, was blockaded,
but I had no alternative but to proceed on &
know, I accordingly, run on, untill within about a
mile of the largest ship, when I came to an anchor.âshe
immediately sent her boat on board, for me
& my papers,âI found the commander, a

haughty
,
crabbed
, self
willed
, Scotchman.

The Blockade

He insisted upon it, that I knew of the blockade;
and that I intended a breach of it; of course,
I was a good prize, & he shouâd send me to England,
very well! I had to submitt to his superior
force; and I was accordingly ordereâd for Yarmouth
in England.

On my arrival there, my papers were sent to
London, to the Kings advocate for adjudication;
but they were return
d.
in 6 days, & I was pronounced
clear, to proceed to any port that was not
blockad
d
and I put to sea the next morning.

As I couâd not go to Hamburg, I concluded,
that Copenhagen, would be, the next
best
market

[Pg 58]

for my Cargo, and I accordingly, steered my
course for that port.âOn my arrival there, I was
advised, by a freindly, Danish Merchant, to proceed
to
Lubec
, one of the,
Hans Towns
, of Germany,
about 100 miles South of Copenhagen, on
the great Belt, so called, from which place, an inland
canal, communicated with Hamburg, where
my Cargo couâd readily be sent, in defiance of the
Blockade; and as my Cargo, was perticularly selected
for the Hamburg Market, this was a very
important object with me.

I consequently proceeded for Lubec where I arrived
in about 48 hours., and was told; that I displayed
the first American flag; ever wafted over
their City.âon approaching the Town, an entire
stranger, I recolected, that, on my last voyage to
Hamburgâa M
r.
Smidth, of the Firm, of Smidth
& Plessing, of Lubec, had made a shipment of 100
peices of Duck by me, which I had sold, & made
returns to them.

I was now glad to enquire them out, and avail
myself of their services in selling my cargo, & purchaseing
another on my return &c &c.âI very
readily found them; and received from them all
those kind attentions, to me, and my business; so
greatfull to a Stranger. A great part of my cargo,
went throâ the canel to Hamburg, and also, much

[Pg 59]

of my return cargo, came in the same way,âbut
I found a good Market; got quick dispatch, and
returned to Boston with an excellent voyage.

After discharging my cargo, in Boston, I visited
my dear family, at the cape; where I found an
aditional pledge of affection, in a little black-eyeâd
daughter, which we callâd Mary P, then 69 days
oldâit being in the night, & no light in the house,
I hawlâd her out of Bed, and held her up to the
window to look at her by moonlight.

Orders in Council

I was not permitted to remain, but a short time,
in the enjoyment of the family circle; before I
receivâd a letter, saying, that another voyage was
planned, & I must come forward. I accordingly,
went on to Boston, & found they had began loading
the Brig, for a voyage to Malaga.âthe loading
was soon compleated, and all necessary
preperations made; and I saild for the Medeterenaen.,
on the 15
th.
of Dec
r.
1807, & arrived at
Malaga, Jan
y
11
th.
1808. On my arrival, I was informed
that the
celebrated British orders in council

went into fource,
there
; the 10
th.
In
t
, the day
before I arrived.âthose orders, forbid american
vessells, taken a return cargo from any ports in
Europe, under the penalty of being a prize, in any
English port.âin consequence of this, we knew,
that
wines, & fruit
, wouâd rapidly advance in

[Pg 60]

price, in America; which made a return cargo, very
desirable.

The
American Consul
, with whoom I advised,
thought, if I got quick dispatch there wouâd be but
little risk in my taking a return cargo; that he
wouâd obligate himself, to dispatch me in 10 days
with a full cargo of wine & fruitâand I finally
concluded to take the risk.

Detained at Gibraltar

I accordingly proceeded in discharging my
cargo, & in receiving on board wine & fruit in return,
& in 8 days was ready to sailâin order to
succeed in escaping an investigation, & probably, a
capture, by the English, I tho
t
to wait for a strong
easterly wind, and to improve the night, to make
a run through the
Gut of Gibraltar
, where lay the
greatest danger of capture, or detention,âI accordingly
waited the first Easterly wind & left
Melaga, calculating to reach the rock of Gibralter,
about Dark, the same Eveâ, which I did, but unfortunally
as I approachâd it, the wind died away,
& by time I had passâd it, it was nearly calmâknowing
that if it remained so thro the night, that
daylight would expose me to Fort & their cruizers,
& that I should surely be exposed to examination,
& detention, I thought it advisable, to proceed to
Anchorage with what wind I hadâand I immediately
haw[l]ed into the Bay, for the neutrial

[Pg 61]

ground, but the wind being a head, I had to make
a tack under the Spanish shore, & while standing
over for the rock, was boarded by the boat of an
English Fregate, under the command of a midshipman,
who took charge of me, under pretence
that I was bound into Algazirasâafter we had
come to anchor, altho 12
o
Clock at night, he insisted
upon taken me on board the Frigate with
my papersâwell I was conducted on board & before
an officer, who questioned me, I told him the
truth, that I was from Malago, bound to Boston,
that I had come in there to evail myself of a clearence
from a British port, & a convoy thro the gutâwell
âsaid he, a convoy will sail, the day after
to morrow, & ordered the officer to carry me on
board my vessell again immediately. I went on
shore the next mornâ & call
d.
upon the American
consel, to whom, I made know my true situationâhe
told me, he thought there was but little chance
for me, as I was compleatly under the
Orders in
Council
.âI left the consul & in the street, fell in
with an old acquaintan[ce], to him also, I told my
greivanceâhe advised me, as a last resort, & as my
situation was not generally known, to endevour to
effect a clerance by bribery; & he gave other advice
& information upon that subject.

I accordingly went on board, got my papers, put

[Pg 62]

a couple of ounces of spanish gold into my pocket,
& went on shore & directly to the office, on the
Key; I found only the
Principall
in the officeâI
told him, I commanded an American vessell was
from Malaga, bound to Boston, and had put in
there, to obtain a clearance, & a convoy thro the
Gutâwell âsaid he, as you say, you have a cargo
on board, there are some serious questions to ask,
previous to your obtaining a clearance.âI know,
I know Sir, but do not be too perticular, give me a
clearance, & at the same time, I laid on the counter
before him,
two ounce peices of gold
âwellâ but
said he, if I give you a clearance you have another
office to git signed at, well âsaid I, if you will give
it, there will be more deficultyâ& as I spoke a
gentleman came into the office, to whom the first
observedâthis Captain was about going up to
your office with his clearance, will you be so kind
as to save him the trouble by signing it here, oh
yes, said he cheerfully, accordinly, in a few
minuits my clearance was compleated, the fees of
both offices paid, & I was in the street, making a
streight wake towards the American consulsâwhen
I entered his office, he, with a long face said,
I am glad to see you, but greatly regret your situationâI
took my clearance from my pocket, &
held it before his eyesâ
Good God
said he, how

[Pg 63]

did you git thatâsaid Iâask me no questions, &
I will tell you no liesâ

Escapes from the Convoy

The Signal Gun was fired, at sun-rise, the next
mornâ for the convoy to weigh, & I was one of
this first to moveâfor I was full of fear, that
some incident might
yet
subject me to the
fatal

investigation, I was therefore desirous to git out
of their reach; a large English merchant ship,
showing a teir of guns, streched over for the Barbary
coast, & I followed her, under easy sail;
our
convoy
, a gun Brig, was not then under-way and in
watching her motion, I discovered a boat after us,
full of men, roughing,
[4]
& sailingâI immediately
felt jelious,
they are after me
, I ordered sail immediately
put on, & in a very short time, the boat

give up
& put back for GibranterâI then felt
antious fearing the convoy might have orders to
bring me back; but I heard nothing more, parted
from the convoy off cape
Trafelgar
, & proceeded
home.

I have mentionâd a boat that was after meâsometime
after I arrived home, I fell in with a
Cap
t
Mills, whom I left in Malaga, in a Brig belonging
to Boston, & persueing the plan I had
done, he saild from Malaga the day after me, was

[Pg 64]

taken into Gibrater the night before I leftâseeing
me underweigh, without reflection, he observed
there is Cobb, why is he allowed to goâthe
boat was immediately dispatchâd after meâbut, by
my vigilence in making sail, in season, & being
favoued with a good stiff breeze I was enableâd
to keep clear of them.â

I was favoured with a good passage, and arrived
safe in Boston, a subject of the most intent
speculation; how it was managed to clear out, a

cargo of Spanish goods
, from Gibralter, under the

British orders in Council
.âBut, I had made a
good voyage for all concerned, & returnâd to my
family.

I remained but a short time with my family,
when I received a letter from Mess
r
Bixby, Vallintine
& co, requesting that I would go on to New
York, & take charge of a Ship, belonging to them,
called the W
m.
Tell, for a voyage to Europeâaccordingly,
I went to Boston, and after receiving
instructions from my Owners, I took the stage for
N. York and took charge of Ship, & fitted her,
with all posible dispatch for seaâI then proceeded
to Alexandria in Virginia, where I loaded the ship
with Flour, and went for Cadiz, in Spain, where
I sold my Cargo, Ballasted the ship with stones,
and returned to Norfolk in Virginiaâwhere I

[Pg 65]

found letters from my Owners with provisions,
from Boston, for another voyage, and orders to go
up to Alexandria & loadâbut, as a part of my
crew wished their discharge and others were to be
shipped to supply their places, a few days detention
was unavoidableâ

Mr. Madisonâs Embargo

While this process was in opperation, a most
violent
storm
came on, & as I had dischargâd the
most of the crew, I was on board the Ship, assisting
in secureing the ship to the Wharf, when M
r.

Fisk, the Merchant with whoom I advised, came
down the wharf & told me, that he had just received
a
dispatch
from M
r.
Randolph, in Congress,
saying to him,
what you do, must be done quickly

for the embargo will be upon you, on Sunday at
10 A M.âit was now Fryday P. M, & a violent
storm, well,â said M
r.
F, what can we do Cobb,
why said I, if we can hold the ship to the wharf,
while it blows so hard, I shall be gladâWe can,
however, see, where we can git the cargo, & if it is
fair to morrow much may be doneâIn fact much
must be accomplishâd in order to effect our object

viz. to cheat the Embargo
. We had about 100
Tons of stone Ballast on board, which must be
landed, upward of 3000 bbls of Flour, to take in
and stow away, provisions, wood & water to take
on board, a crew to ship, to clear at the custom H.

[Pg 66]

and, to git the ship to sea, before the embargo gits
possessionâand all this must be done, between
Saturday mornâ at day light, & sunday morn at
10
[o:]
Clock, in the month of Dec
r.
âWe found,
upon enquiry, that, we couâd have our supply of
Flour from a block of stores, direct along side of
the Ship, & by giving â

th
of a dollar extra, we
had liberty, if stopped by the embargo, to return
itâ

Saturday morning, was fine weather I had given
instructions to the mates, to have purchases up, at
each hatchway, the ship having threeâto discharge
ballast, at the main hatchway, & to receive
Flour forward, & abaft, with two gangs of Stevidore
in the holdâat about Sunrise, I went up to

lazy corner
, so callâd, & pressed every Negro into
my service, that came upon the stand, & sent them
on board the ship, untill I thought there were as
many, as could work.

I then visited the Sailors boarding houses, where
I shipped my crew, paid the advane to their landlords,
& took their obligations to see each sailor on
board, at sun-rise the next morning.âIt had now
got to be about 12
o
Clock & the ship must be
cleared at the Custom house at, or before, oneâI
accordingly prepared a Manifest & went to the
Custom house to clear the ShipâM
r.
Taylor, the

[Pg 67]

collector, knowing my situation, with the ship;

said
why Cobb, what is the use of clearing the
ship, you cannot git away, the embargo will be
here at 10 to morrow morning, & even if you git
your ship below, I shall have boats out that will
stop you, before you can git 3 leagus to sea. Said
I, â
M
r
Taylor
, will you be so kind as to clear my
ShipâOh yesâ said he, I cannot refuse, (untill the
embargo arrives; & accordingly the ship was
cleared & I returned on board, & found all things
going on well.âfinallyâto shorten the Storyâat
9 that evning, we had on board 3050 Barrels of
Flour, our long boat on board in the chocks, water,
wood, & provision on board & stowed, a pilot engage,
& all in readiness for Sea.

A Feat of Loading

The tide wouâd serve at 8
[o:]
Clock on sunday
morn, & we could not go before, & at 10 the embargo
was expectedâwell, âthe mornâ arrived,
the sailors were bro
t.
on board by their Landlords,
the pilot came on board, & at 8
o
Clock we started
with a fair wind, down a crooked nerrow river, but
the wind dying, our progress was Slow, & when
we entered Hampton roads, it had got to be after
11
o.
Clock, and nealy calmâfeeling anxious, I
kept a sharp look out a stern, & with my glass, I
saw about 12, a boat comeing down, under the full
opperation of sails & oarsâwell,â said I, to the

[Pg 68]

mate, I fear, we are goneâbut very soon I saw, to
appearance, a fresh breeze coming off from the
South shore, I saw that the boat, had already taken
itâI then ordered all the light sails set, ready to
receive the breeze.âwhen it reached us, the boat
was so near, that with my glass I trace the features
of the menâbut in 10 munuites after I took it the
boat give up the chace & turnâd back, and I went
to sea without further molestation.â

By the pilot, I wrote my Owners, informing
them of my running away from the Embargo, &
then proceeded on for Cadiz, & carraied to that
port the first news of the Embargo.

Flour was selling, on my arrival at $16.00 but
in consequence of the Embargo, & the war then
rageing in that vicinity, the flour holders had a
meeting, & agreed to raise the price of Flour to
$20.00.â& finally, althoâ I waited some time I
obtained that price for my Cargo.â

Soon after my arrival, I rec
d.
a letter, by a vessell
under Sweedish colours, adviseing me to bring
home money, providing there was liberty to export
it; & finding, upon enquiry, that was the case,
I immediately took out a license from the custom
house, to export $72,000, having funds here, of
last voyage,âbut before I got ready to sail I
heard of the repeal of the orders in Council, &

[Pg 69]

allso, of the
Milan
&
Berlin
decrees, & beleiving
this would have a favourable effect, to America,
in our Exchanges, & finding I couâd buy British
government Bills, at a great discount, I concluded
to give up my Licinse, & remitt my money to England,â(I
mention this circomstance to shew, how
fortunate it wasâas I was captured, on my return,
if the Monney had been on board, we shouâd have
lost it.âThe day before I sailed I dineâd in a
large party, at the american consul, & it being mentionâd
that I was to sail the next day, I was congratulated,
by a British officer, upon the safety of
our Flagg.âwellâ I tho
t.
the same, when at the
same time, the
War
between England & America
was then rageing.

Spoken off the Grand Banks

I sailâd from Cadiz, the 5
th.
day of July 1812
bound for Boston, & I never felt myself saffer, on
account of enemies on the high seas,âI had just
entered upon the eastern edge of the grand Bankâat
day light, of the mornâ of the 17
th
I went on
deck; we had a light breeze of wind from the
north, with all sails sett, that would draw, in casting
my Eye to windward, I saw a sail, to appearance,
bearing down directly for usânot having
spoken any thing, I told the mate, to back the
maim yard & would speak her, we accordingly did;
& at sunrise I ordered the Insign hoisted, at the

[Pg 70]

Mizen peak; no sooner were our colours up, than
his went up in the smoke of a gun, I saw that she
was a Schooner, under English colours, & that she
was armed; but did not alarm me, I continu
d.
to
lay by, she run down across
t.
my stern, with the
usual hail, of, where from, where bound, how
long out, &c &câ& he concluded from my replys
that I did not know that war existed; he said to
me, very mildly, I will thank you to continue laying
by, & I will send my boat on boardâSeeing
she was a cutter Schooner with 10 brass Guns, I,
of course, acquiesed, & her boat came on board,
with two petty officers, rowed by
only
two menâOne
of the officers requested me to go on board
the cutter with my papers; wellâ I asked the 2
officers below, while I shifted myself and got my
papers; while I was in my statroom, one of them,
says to me, Cap
t
, âwhat cargo did you carry to
Cadiz? Flour,â you got a good price, I presume
Yes,â said Iâgot Cash on board I suppose? No,
said I, I remitted my money, to England,â well,â
said he, Youâve a fine ship here! Yes, tolobleâwhat,â
said he do you think sheâs worthâthis
question, roused my curiocity, I stepâd to the door
of the Stateroom, & looking the man in the face,
said to him, have you an Idea of buying, or taking
the ship, Oh, said he, Captain, youâl excuse our inquisitiveness,

[Pg 71]

it was without meaning.âWhen I
was ready, one of the officers went in the boat with
me, & the other, remained on board the shipâI
was received on board the cutter, & conducted into
the cabin, to the Cap
t.
,âhe received my papers, &
looking them over, askâd, if I had not a Clearance
from Cadiz; I told him I had, but, I did not
[know] it wouâd be required, & I had not bro
t.
it,
well,â said he, I must have it; if youâl send your
boat Sir, I will go & look it up, I think its in my
writing desk,âwell,â said he, send for your desk,
I told him I was unwilling to do that, as it contained
papers of consequence to me, & by accident
it might be droped overboadâoh said he, Iâll
make good all damages, you
must
send for it.
well,â I wrote a line to the mate, to send my. W.
Desk, it was brought into the cutters cabin, & having
my keys in my pocket, I openâd it, & soon
found the paper required,âmy writing standing
upon the Table open, & the officers standing round,
they began looking at papers, among them, was a
small bundle of letters directed to the Commissary
Gen
l.
on the
Quebec Station
, they openâd it, &
broke the seal of one of the lettersâ; upon which
I lookâd at the Cap
t.
, & observâd, that this was
treatment which I had not anticipated, from the
British flagg; the Capt observâd, you must submitt,

[Pg 72]

we will explain ourselves bye. & bye about this
time, the word came from the decks,
a Strange sail
in sight
, & the Capt, dropâd the paper from hands,
& run on deck.âI set still & lookâd at the officers,
overhawling, & deranging my papers in my writing
desk.âafter a while the Capt came down below;
& said to me, Captain; you have expressed some
surprise at our investigation, at which, I am not at
all supprised, for I find, you are ignorant of a fact,
which will justify, our proceedings with you,
We
are at War with America
ânow Sir, said I I beleive
you are disposed to
tantalize
, for I do not beleive
it.âWell,â Sir, said he, we will not alticate upon
this subject; & he stepâd to a desk took out a newspaper,
& pointed me to the declaration of War, &
danced on deck again, to look at the Strange sail.âthe
paper that he handed me, was an American
paper, only 12 days oldâafter reading the declaration
of war, I lookâd it over for other news,
untill the Capt came down.âHe then said to me,
well Sir, what think ye nowâI told him, I was
satisfied, as to
war
, but, I shouâd like to know
now, whether
I
was to be
hung
, or
drounded
.

On Board the Cutter

He smilling said, âwell,â I beleive nither,
by
me
.âI will now, said he, explain to you the reasons,
for our conduct toward you; I am said heâfrom
Halifax, bound to England with dispatches

[Pg 73]

for Gov
t.
, I cannot take you, not having men to
man you, if I had found money on board I shouâd
have taken it out, & have put one man on board,
that might not be callâd piricy & have let you have
taken your chanceâbut as it is you can take charge
of your ship, & do the best you canâthe sail coming
down, is an American Frigate, & if I can keep
out the reach of her guns, I do not fear her heals,
& the sooner you go on board the betterâas soon,
as you please, said Iâ& I crow[d]ed some of my
papers into my Desk, & tied some up in a hankerchief,
& thus went into the boat & was set on
board my own ship again.âWhen I got on my
Ships deck, the Frigate was so near that she couâd
easyly have sent a shot over me, & coming down
will all sail set, & an American Insign at her Mizin
peak.âaltho I was confidant, she was an English
Frigate; still, being compleatly within the reach
of her guns, & my ships sails all taken, I had only
to lay still & take it.

The Frigate

The Frigate was down, in a few minuits & the
boats was manned, & came on board, under the
command of an officer, in an american uniform.âthe
usual questions, of, where from, where bound,
how long out &c &c, were askâd, & ansered; when
he thus interogated me, are you not in fear of being
taken, No Sir, said I, for I think I am
already

[Pg 74]

taken, whatâ. said he, by one of your own Frigates;
no,â said I, that is not an american Frigate, nither
Sir, are
you
intitled to wear that Button. Well,â
said he, you are about right.âthat is His Britianic
majistys Frigate, the Jason, & to her, you are a
prize.ânow, said he, what have you on board for
Cargo; sand Ballast, said I,
what
, did [you] cary
to Cadiz, Flour, did it sell yes, it Brought $20.00
p
r
Barrel.âOh, youâve Cash on board said he, No,
said I, I remitted the proceeds of my cargo to
London, & I have my thirds of exchange, to satisfy
you.âwell,â said he, you have a fine ship here;
what will you give for her, & we give you, a clear
passport into Boston.âafter a little reflection, I
nameâd $5000.00 well,â said he,
give us the
money
; Oh, I thank you said I, if it was on board,
you wouâd take it without asking me.âI will give
you a draft on London.âno, said he,
the cash
, or
we
burn
the ship.âwell said I, youâl not burn me,
in her I hope,âoh, no, you may give orders for
your men to pick up their duds, & we will carry
them on board the Frigate.âYou will remain on
board & select yourself a servant, from your crew,
the ship is too good to
Burn
.âI accordingly selected
my Nephew, E. C. Crosby, to remain with
me, my mates & crew, were all carraied on board
the Frigate,âAfter a while, the pinnace was sent

[Pg 75]

with special orders for me to come on board the
Frigate.âwell,â I went on Board, was received at
the Ganway, by a Leut
t.
, & conducted into the
Cabin, to the captain, he, with his officers, were
then sitting at the dinner table, I was placeâd in a
chair by his side, & offered a glass of wine; after
which; he, the cap
t.
, said to me! what Dâd rascal
put your papers in that situation, for they were
sent to him, as I took them from the cutter, open
letters &c,âwhyâ, Sir said I; that Dâd rascal, as
you are pleasâd to call him, was Leutenant Jones,
commanding his Majesties cutter the Alphea;
why,â said he, heâs broke the Kings Seal, Iâll have
the fellow hung,â well Sir, said I, you can do as
you please, with your own subjects.âhe then said
[to] me,â I am satisfied, on examination of your
papers, that you have not money on board, as a return
cargo, but I shall now ask you a question,
which it will be, for your Interest, to answer

candidly
, well Sir, I shall judge better, when I
hear the question,! have you money on board, on
your own private account; without hesitation, I
answerâd Yes, how much said he, about $2000,
â¦ it is safe, We, as yet, respect private property,
when it does not exceed $3000.; more than
that; we think is smugled.â

The Kingâs Seal

finally, he observed; your officers & men, now

[Pg 76]

on board here, shall fare, as we do, & we are 6 on
4. well, Sir, we have abundant provisions on board
the prise, if youâl permit, Iâl send some by the boat
that returns with me; certainly said he, & it shall
be kept for them exclusively, while they are on
board this ship,âI have put a prise master & crew
on board your ship, & ordered her for S
t.
Johns;
& I shall visit that coast, in 8 or 10 days, & will
then, send up your officers & crew, I will now send
you on board, I have charged the prise master,
not to intefere with,â but, to conform to, your
regulations, in your Cabin, &c &c.

A Prisoner of War

I returnâd on board, & we made sail for S
t.

Johns as ordered;âI found the prise Master a
very pleasant man, & all things went on pleasantly;
but by adverse winds, we were 6 days before
we arrived at S
t.
Johns.âit was evening when
we arrived; the next mornâ I was taken on shore,
& conducted before the Port Admiral, Sir John
Thomas Duckworth; after he had made enquiries,
relative to my voyage, capture &c &c; he told me,
that I had the liberty of the town, provided, I
choose to take up my residence on shore, or, I had
the liberty of remaining on board the shipâbut
could not have excess, to the ship, & shore both.âI
finally told him, that I wouâd like to remain on
board the ship, untill my officers & men were sent

[Pg 77]

in, after which, I wouâd like to come on shore.âAccordingly,
I returned to the ship, where, I was
allowed the same use of my cabin, & provisions, as
formally, in 4 days, my officers & crew, were sent
in, & on board the ship, we were again altogether,
& as we had remaining of our sea stock, a shoat, of
about 60 lb, I ordered it dressed, & a good dinner
provided for, all hands, of which I pertook; & the
next day, took up my residence on shore, at, prisiners
Hall, so called, where there were about 20,
Masters & supecargoes, prisinners, like myself.âI
found, that there were 27 American vessells, in
port, as prises, the Port Admiral, had given liberty
to the Supergaroes, & Gentlemen passengers to
leave; & git home, at there own expence; and provided,
they went away altogether, he would give
them a protection, against capture by the Englishâas
I had two Brothers, on board my ship, Josiah,
& E. C. Crosby, the Idea struck me, that it was

posible
, that I might git liberty, to send the latter,
a meer boy, home by the same chance, for they
had already purchasâd a small vessell, & was then
fitting her out.âI accordingly drafted a request,
to Sir John, stating, in as feeling a manner, as I
was capable, the inconsolibility of their Parents
&c &c, and waited upon the old Gentleman with
it, in person; He looked it over attentively;

[Pg 78]

looked up at me, & said Yes, Yes, Mr Cobb, send
him home to his parents, & I wish I couâd say the
same to you all I accordingly, made preparations
for sending the boy home.âI wrote to my family
by him, and also, stitched 20 peices of Spanish
Gold, into a plaid, which he put into his neck hankerchief,
& their wore it, night & day, untill he got
home, took it from his neck, & gave it to his Aunt.â6
days, after this vessell had saild; we were
greeted, at a very early hour in the mornâ, with
the sound, âan american,
cartile
[5]

Flagg
flying in
the harbour,âWe were soon, into the Town, &
learned, that a ship had arrived, during the previous
night, under the command of an american
officer, with a cartile flag; that the officer had then
gone, to report himself, to the port Admiral,âwe,
fourthwith repaired to a noted Coffee house,
where the American officer soon arrived.

An Exchange of Prisoners

Althoâ we were all strangers, he cordially took
us by the hand, as americans, and told us, that he
was 2
d
Leut,â of the American Frigage Câs
[6]

[Pg 79]

Cap
t.
Porter that ship, in the harbour; was the
British Sloop of War Elert, prize to the Câs, and
that, through the impertunity of the British Cap
t.
,
she had been sent in, by Cap
t.
Porter, with her officers
& crew, all on board, to be exchanged, for the
same number of Americans.âBut, said the officer,
I have cause to fear, that I may be a prisiner with
you, for, said he, I left the old Admiral, in a violent
rage, at Cap
t.
Porters proceedings, of making
a cartile, on the high seas. the officer told him, he
had no terms to make, his orders, from Cap
t.
Porter,
was, to lay there 24 hours, & if the terms were
not complied with, to proceed on to America, with
the Prise & her Crew, or, be your
prisinner
, said
he, as Iâm in your power, however, in a few
minuits, a note was received from the old Admiral,
saying, that upon a re-perusual of Cap
t.

Porters dispatches, he found that the
honor
, of the
British officer was pledgâd, for the fulfilling of
the contract, & as he knew his government, always
redeemâd the pledges of their officers; he wouâd
receive the officers & crew of Ellert, he wouâd give
in exchange, every American prissiner in port (&
there were 2 to 1) & that we must be off in 24
hours.

Now, commenced a Scene of confusion, and
bussle; the Crew of the cartile was soon landed,

[Pg 80]

and the Americans as speedily took possession, &
the next mornâ, at about the suns rising, we
weighed the anchors of the
Ellert
, left the harbour
of S
t.
Johns, and made sail for New York, with
246 Americans on board.âWe came on, without
falling in, with any floating object, untill we were
in the Longitude of the South shoal of Nantucket
when saw a topsail Schooner, running off S. Easterly,
upon which we fired, & brought her two; she
hoisted Sweedish colours, & lay bye, untill we
boarded her; We found she was from Boston,
bound for the West Idies, and gave us the pleasing
account of the American Frigate, the
Constitution
,
having captured the, British Frigate the
Garreire
,

This intilligence was communicated to the

Ellert
, by the boarding officer, and in quick time,
her yards were manned & three cheers were given,
which might have been heard miles.âtwo days
after, we arrived in New York, and dispersed to
our several places of residence.âI took passage
with my two mates, & Josiah Crosby, in a Schooner
for
Bass River
, we reached the river about the suns
setting, & being but about 6 miles from my family,
I could not feel willing to sleep without seeing
themâconsequently myself, & my 1
st.
mate,
M
r.

Berry
each hired a Saddle horse, & started for
Brewster, and I reach
d.
my dwelling, & gave a

[Pg 81]

knock, at your G. Mothers, sleeping room window,

the same I now occopy
, about 12
[o:]
Clock.
x x x x it may perhaps amuse my dear G. Childen,
if I turn back to the time of my arrival, a prisoner,
at S
t.
Johns, a circomstance then took place, connected
with my knocking at the window, as above

Petition to the Port Admiral

I learned, on my arrival in S
t.
Johns, that the
Port Admiral, Sir J. T. Duckworth, had given
liberty, to the American Supercargoes & passenger,
to purchase a vessel, & git home at their own expence,
& he wouâd give them a protection from
British Cruseirs; & as I had on board, two
Brothers, Josiah & E. C. Crosby, the
latter
, quite
a lad; the Idea struck me, that
posibly
, by application,
I might obtain liberty to send the boy home,
by this conveyance; for they had already purchased
a small vessell & were then fitting her for
seaâI accordingly drafted a petition; applying
pritty strongly to the old Gentlemans feelings, in
behalf of the disconsolate Parents &c &c, and presented
it myselfâafter perusing the petition; the
old Genâ rested his head in his hand, for a few
moments, and looked up very kindly in my face,
saying Yes, Yes, M
r.
Cobb,
send him home to his
Parents
& I wish I felt at liberty to send every
American in port home.âThis, wouâd give me an
oppertunity of informing my Family of my capture,

[Pg 82]

of sending some money, spared me by the
captors; and grattifiing my relatives by sending
home their beloved son.

I accordinly fixed him away; making a plaid
for his neckhankercheif, with 24 Dubloons in
Gold amounting to $384 dollars, which the
dear
child
put round his neck, in my room, in S
t.
Johns
& did not take it off, untill in my house, in the presencs
of his Aunt; and after having delivered my
letters &câThis happened, at about 8
[o:]
Clock on
the same evening I arrived at Bass revirâwellâ,
at 12
[o:]
Clock, as before stated I knowked at the
Winder.

It appears she had been reperusing my Lengthy
letter, Amegining & revolving in mind all the horrows
of my situation in an English prisin,
after
she had been in bed
, & had not been asleep, when
I knowâd at the Window.

Who is there! said sheâit is I, said Iâwellâ,
what do you want; to come in; for what said she;
before I couâd answer, I heard my daughter D.,
who was in bed with her say,
why, Mar it is Par
,
this was aneogh, the doors flew open, and the
greetings of affection & consanguinity multiplied
upon me rapidly.

End of the Voyage

Thus, in a moment was I transported to the

[Pg 83]

greatest earthly bliss, man can injoy, viz to the injoyment
of the happy family circil.

To fall of 1812â

T
he
foregoing was written by Gen Elijah
Cobb during the Year 1843, with the intention
of completing, but the state of his health prevented.

He remained at home from 1812 to 1815 or
1816, when he made several voyages to Europe
in the Ship âParagonâ built for him, and considered
at the time one of the finest ships of her day.

In 1818 & 1819 he made two voyages to Africa
in the Ship âTen Brothers,â taking with him on
the first voyage, his son Freeman.

The second voyage, there was much sickness of
a contagious character, and the ship on her return
was sunk at the end of the wharf to prevent contagion
in the city of Boston.
[7]

He left the sea in 1820, and after that time remained
in Brewster, Mass. filling the various civil
offices of Town Clerk, Treasurer, Inspector General,

[Pg 84]

Representative and Senator, and Justice of
Peace & Quoram, also the military rank of Brigadier
General.

He was a strong supporter of the Universalist
church of the town, in whose doctrines he took
much interest.

He was tall & straight of fine figure his face
very pleasant to look upon. He loved children and
was loved by them. Distinguished for his sterling
integrity as well as talent loved and respected by
all who knew him, he died at the age of eighty.
âMay our end be like his.â

His body & that of his wife lie in the new cemetery,
Brewster.

Cap
t
E Cobb,

Sir
,

We expect that Peace in Europe, will make
considerable difference both in the price, of the
articles, with which you were to load, and also in
the demand for them, in this Country; by the time
you could return; from these considerations we
think it best for you to sell the Ship Monsoon, if
you can get from Eight to Ten Thousand dollars,
clear of the Mates and People, and all other expences:
if you cannot sell the Vessel and the prices
of goods ordered have not considerably fallen you
will please take a freight to any part of America
or elsewhere if to be obtainâd on terms that you
think will answer, in either of the above mentioned
Cases you will place the proceeds of your
outward Cargo, (and Ship if sold) in the hands of
some safe House in London, say Tho
s
Dickerson
& C
o
if they still remain goodâin addition to the
above we have only to say that feeling much confidence

[Pg 86]

in your judgment, we leave it to you to do
as you think will be most for our Interests.âIf
the Peace continues we think the following articles
will not be worth more in Boston next spring than
say,â

Ironâ100$, to 110$.

Hemp 200$ to 230$.

Tumblers 40 Cents p

Straw.

Glass 8$, pr. Box, to 9$.â

Sir,

you being Master of the Ship William Tell,
we wish you as soon as you get your cargo on
board to proceed the first fair wind for Lisbon on
your arrival at Lisbon you will apply to Mess

Gould, Brothers & Co and if you with them think
it for our interest you will dispose of your cargo
to the best advantage or proceed to Cadiz or
Gibralter as you may think best. Should you proceed
to Cadiz we should recommend the house
of the Widow of Morace Roberts & Co to you to
do your business if you should proceed to Gibralter
we should recommend the Hous of George
Allardyce & Co but in all cases should you think
best you will value on any other houses you may
think most for our interest, after discharging your
cargo you will remit the proceeds of our goods
and the amount of your freight to Samuel Williams
Esq
r
London payable to the order of Bixby
Valentine & Co in favour of Humphrey & Clark

[Pg 88]

except such amount as you may think proper to
invest for a return cargo on our accounts after discharging
your cargo you will in case it is at Lisbon
or Cadiz ballast your ship with Salt and proceed
to the Havana if at Gibralter you will ballast
with Stone or Sand as you may be able to obtain,
and, if any cheap Red Wine or Malaga Wine can
be obtained or any freight you will take and proceed
to the Havana with all possible dispatch, In
case you get a part of a cargo at any place before
mentioned you will have it shipped as the property
of Mess

Drake & Murdock, merchants of
Havana, in the name of some Spanish House, On
your arrival at the Havana you will call on Mess

Drake & Murdock where you will find our instructions
how to proceed, our object is to get a freight
home from the Havana for the Ship with laying
out what funds you may have for a return cargo in

We should not confine the destination of the

My Dear Freind

We are here; & all well,
thanks to the controler
of every event
, but under circomstances, must remain
here two months longer, as we have a considerable
part of our cargo still on hand, business
is astonishingly altered since last voyage, the coast
is crouded with vessells & goods of every discription,
& the natives have nothing to buy with. This
circomstance is owing to the late interior war,
which has recently raged with great violence &
prevented the natives from procuring Gold dust
& Ivory as formally.âmy object for waiting is to
git clear of the Perishable part of my cargo for
coffee, when their Crop comes in, which is now
commin[c]ing but will not be at its height untill

[Pg 91]

the last of March
or
first aprilâI also calculate to
touch at one of the windward W. India Islands
(on my passage home) in order to s[ell]
[10]
my Tobacco,
Flour, Tea, & salmon; which I cannot sell
here for an[y thin]g
[10]
â& some Corn, which I shall
receive here in barter, so [that]
[10]
you need not be
antious if we dont git home untill [the la]st
[10]
of
July. we may sooner, but I think it douptfull;âWhat
I have sold of the cargo, has been at about
as good profit as last voyage, the deficulty is not
so much in the price, as in finding people able to
purchase, Scarcity of produce is the great complaint.
This comes by Esq. Clark, via the W.
Indies, he will sail to morrow; Cap
t
Nickerson is
very sick on shore, he will leave him to come with
us if he git well, but I have hardly a hope, he is

however
in the hands of a mercifull God, may his
will be done, & the submission of the creture sincierâ¦.
I expect our people will all write to
their freinds, another oppertunity will offer in
about 15 or 20 days direct for Boston. I will then
write again.

Hard Times

Pars love to all his children, he earnestly pray
that his life may be spared, & he permitted, once
more to greet his little flock in health & hapiness.

[Pg 92]

Docter will have all the perticulars respecting
the Schooners Voyage by the Esq: it is consequently
unnecesary for me to writeâ. They have
not managed matters quite to my mind, but so it
is, & prehaps for the best.

My Dear freind

I wrote you 4 days ago by the Schooner Hope
which I sent away under the care of John Dillingham
3
d
he being the only one willing to undertake,
â¦ you may
posibly
git this letter first, it is
therefore necessary to repeat that Esq. Clark has
paid the dept of nature, it was my task to close his
Eyes the 11
th
Ins
t
after a sickness of 8 daysâYoung
Kimbal died 4 days before, Cap
t
Nickerson
was very sick
on board this ship
, but his fever having
turned, it was the advice of Every One to send
him to sea, that a change of air would have a good
effect; I accordingly did, but fear he never will
reach America; we must
however
commit him &
ourselves to a mercifull just God, who always acts
for the good of his Creaturs & happy would it be
for us; if we could always bow with humble submission
to his righteous dispensations.

[Pg 94]

Cap
t
Mayo has been
very
sick; his fever turned
two days since, & the people here
who are no doupt
better judges than strangers
say he is out of danger,
he
also
has great currage, but he is very weak.
& it will be a long time before he gits [his]
[12]

strength, he is on shore, I am something unwell, &
[takin]g
[12]
Medicine that I cannot see him to dayâ

Feb
y
20
th

Alas Alas
, Cap
t
Mayo is gone; an unfavourable
turn in his disorder was his passport to
(I trust) realms of blessednessâI have ordered
the ship amediately to sea; shall work up to the
windward of these islands & pass away 3 or 4
weeks, untill the sickly season passes of.âI must
then return & git pay for 3 or 4000 Dollars of
goods trusted out to A. B. C. &c &c, in orders for
coffeeâand had I have foreseen the consequence;
I would not have put it out of my power to have
left altogether at pleasure altho we should have
bro
t
home half our cargo, but circomstancd as I
am, we must take all reasonable precaution, and
trust our lives & healths, to an alwise, aljust, &
mercifull God,
who cannot err
.

The scenes of distress, together with anciety of
mind, which I have had to encounter within the
last 15 days, have nearly unmaned me, I wouâd
write to Mrs Mayo but am not able, do afford her
all the consolation in your power, & oh, may God

[Pg 95]

of his infinite mercy pour the balm of consolation
into her afflicted Bosomâ

The crew will all write; they are well as yit, but
quite alamed, which induces me to put to sea,
where we shall git good air, &
I hope
, fresh sperits

I had, (previous to this last shock) written a
few lines to Mrs Clark, I do not feel able to put in
order by copying, I inclose it, youâl deliver it, or
not, as you think proper.

My love to our little ones & all freindsâdont
give yourself too much anciety, put your whole
trust in God, he can releive in the greatest distress
or most [imm]inent

danger.

The Rainy Season

I expect before this, my letters (by the two
schooners) filled with heart rending tidings to our
Brewster freind have been received, my mental,
as well as bodily distress, has been such, that I
hardly know what I wrote in those letters (probably
much incoherency) as they were dictated by
the feelings of the moment, but I trust those
scenes are not to return upon us this voyage, the
place is healthy, frequent turnardoes, with thunder
lightning & copeous showers purifies the air, all
nature smiles, & the human form wears a cheerfull
countenance in place of the gastly visage, which so
recently presented itself at all points.âWhat
abundant cause of greatfull praise to the supreem
controler of every event both of time & eternity,
more especially to us the living monuments of His
mercy who for wise purposes (thoâ hidden from
our veiw) have been spared while so many have
fallen around us, May we express our gratitude by
keeping his commands.

I have written to your mar by this conveyance
hope it will not be long (after you receive this)
before I shall be permitted to see my little flock in
health.

Samuel Swan, Jr., to Mrs. Elijah Cobb

[Ship] BelvidereâQuarantineâ

June 27th 1819

Mrs. Cobbâ

Madamâ

I arrived here last evening 84 Days from
AfricaâI left the Ten Brothers at Princes Island
April 4
th
âAfter the loss of Cap
t
Mayo, the ship
proceeded to sea in a very sickly stateâThe
change of air soon produced a favourable effect;
and on the Ships return to Princes in March they
were all quite recovered, though still m[uc]h
[13]
debilitatedâOne
man only was any ways ill during
my stay, & he was again on duty when we sailâdâThe
ship had been on her return to port thoroughly
clensed by washing with vinegar, & limejuice, and
twenty four hourâs fumigation with strong charcoal
fires in the hold, & between decksâDuring
this time I was honoured with Cap
t
Cobbâs company
on board the Belvidereâ

I believe, Madam, you may rest perfectly free
from any apprehensions of the sickness again appearing
on board the Ten BrothersâEvery precaution
has been taken to purify the shipâ& the
more immediate cause of their sickness was also removedâIt

[Pg 99]

is during the few weeks interval between
the closing of the Dry, & setting in of the
Rainy season, that the Islands are most unhealthyâThe
atmosphere is then heavy, & the Harbor is
so situated that the little air that is in motion during
the day is intirely secluded from the shipping,
while a vertical sun produces an intensity of heat
that operates powerfully to render the place unhealthyâAfter
the rains commence, the frequent
tornadoes which accompany that season, & always
blow from the eastward, directly into the harbor,
so purify the air that there is little danger of sickness
with the usual precautions which all strangers
should observe for preservation of health in warm
climatesâ

Good News

As I was in daily communication with Cap
t

Cobb, I can assure you of his intire restoration to
health, except the debility incident to a severe attack
of feverâ

It was Cap
t
Cobbâs intention to close all business
with the utmost dispatch, & he thought to be able
to sail in all April to a certaintyâHe will touch
at Martinique on his passage to Americaâ

I am fully aware, Madam, that the charge of
presumption may be alledged against meâIndeed
(reasoning from analogy) I offer no other
apology for writting, than the satisfaction I believe

[Pg 100]

my own family would recieve by any communication
from a person who had seen me
abroad, at a time when a variety of reports respecting
my safety would render any news highly gratifyingâ

I cannot close without most respectfully offering,
throâ your family, the tribute of my consolation
to the family of the late Henry Clarke Esq
r

of your t[ow]n
[14]
âOn my first arrival at Princes,
in Dec
r
, I found him there; & our constant intercourse,
during the short stay I there made, gave me
abundant cause to honour & admire himâon my
leaving the place he accompanied me out of the
harbor, & our last resolve, when he quited me, was,
to visit each others families when both should be
at homeâNothing could exceed the shock on my
feelings, on again visiting the Island, to learn his
lamented deathâIf the respect of a stranger can
be acceptable to his family, I beg, Madam, you
will mention my name, as one who feels proud to
acknowledge an acquaintance, & friendship, with
him abroadâ

With regard, I remain,

Madam, respectfully your

Most Humble servantâ

This Day, compleats the full time of 21 years,
since the
Supreem
doner of every thing, was
pleased to gladen the parential heart in the birth
of a Son; Who has since continued his existance
throâ Infancy; throâ Youth, & bro
t
him to the
commincment of manhood, without suffering any
action (of their childs) to wound their hearts;
What abundant cause of greatfull Praise for those
inestimable favours,âMay He enable them to
suplicate with fervency &
effect
, to continue His
Mercies to them & their children, & may it laden
all their hearts with a greatfull song of Thankgiving
& Praise,âWe recieved your letter by M
r

[Pg 102]

Copeland & noted your observations upon M
r
Hâs
enquiries, we think it wouâd be as well, to continue
where you are a while, (at least) untill the Fall,âBut
althoâ I wouâd not inculcate the Idea of taking
the advantage of any ones necesity; I think as M
r

H. has contributed so
very
sparringly to y
r
support
during the long time you have remained with
him, He ought now to give you a full support
at
least
untill you see your way clear to commince
business for yourself, which time we look forward
to with pleasure, mixed with a degree of anciety,
naturel to parential feelings always antious for the
wellfare of their ospring. prehaps the old edage
will apply,
that effection is blind
, but we feel confident
(from your former & present deportment)
that propriety, entigrity, virtue & piety will govern
all your actions,âThose virtues exercised by
a finite being will receive an
infinite
approbation
& blessingâ

Every advice, & every assistanc from your Parents,
will at all times be cheerfully bestowed, & it
is (we presume) unnecesary to ask, who is so suitable
to advise a child as its fond doating parentsâWe
will close for the present, by supplicating Our
Heavenly Father, to take you into His holy keeping;
to direct each gardian Angel to watch over

[Pg 103]

you, that no improper action may ever sully a good
name or wound y
r
parents feelings

Affectionately Yours

E. & M. Cobb

NB. Debby is favourably convalessent. wish you
to inform me, if you hear any thing from Cap
t

Tycross, or M
r
Hathawayâ

We hope Mrs Haven will come with Lincoln
(expect him the next tide) we shall be highly
pleased with a visit from her, & think it can be
made pleasant to her.

Dear Son

As our representitive will leave in the mornâ I
avial myself of the oppertunity to forward by him
the small paper Package, which I found snugly
laceed up, in the branch part, of your last package
of trees. I found the mice had made a hole throâ
the paper, among some small seed, when, or where
it was done I cannot say, I found no other traces
of them either about the package or ground where
they wereâI put the inverlope around them
again, but shall have an eye to them frequently.

The Lyceum appear to be in successfull opperation,

from

my
humble self

Libra
n
â24 became members, by signing the constitution,
& paying from 50
cs
to 2.00âthe members
were then, formed into 6 Sections of 4 each,
for discussions, by the board of managers, (the 5
officers as above) and the follow
g
subject assigned,
for the next wednesday eveâ viz, which exarts the
greatest influance, in a country Town,
wealth or
knowledge
âthe discussion was assigned to the 1
st

& 2
d
Sections, under the managements of the Rev
d

mess
rs
Conant, & Williams, the former advocating
wealth, & the latter knowledgeâthe subject
was ably & ingenously managed on both sides, but
the decision was in favour of wealth. an addition
of 17 became member, making now 41.

The next Wednesday Eveâ we are to have an
address by the Rev
d
M
r
Simpkinsâthe subject
for discussion is,
which injoys the greatest satisfaction,
the Rich man, or poor man
âassigned to
Sections 3
d
& 5
th
Rev
d
M
r
Pratt, & FatherâI expect

[Pg 105]

a powerfull opponent, but cannot feel any
fear upon the subject. He cannot expect much assistance
from his Section, except what he gits from
our bro
r
Jo. & I have M
r
Washburn in my Section,
which I think will match Docter.âThere appears
an interest in the cause, among our young
men, the older ones must begin, but they will soon
come forward.

Local Affairs

Our high School goes on well, it is as full, as
they can accommodate 46âthere appears perfect
satisfaction with M
r
Washburn, the instructorâhe
appears to be
wide awake
, & master of his business.

We are looking hourly for the Fayette, think
she will be here in the mornââshe no doubt came
unexpectedly to you, but she must have had a fine
time, and our shore is now clear of Ice for her return.

My eyes are somthing better, but very weak, I
am obliged to deny myself the pleasure of reading,
altogether, and I am in agony with writing
thus much, althoâ I have had 5 or 6 spells at it.

Grandfather wishes the children all,
a happy
new year
, not as the compliment of the season,
which is in the mouths of the multitude, but in
sencerity of heart.

Dear Son

Your last p

Patriot, gave general directions
about placeing manure &c &c, all which, Father
thinks, manifests agriculturel judiciousness. Freeman
commenced work March 27

your injuntion, relative to sea-weed, & a fine
oppertunity presenting last week, he did very little
elseâwe shall have, by night, anough up by my
salt works, to replenish your Barn Yardâa noble
lot, of excell
t
seaweed came on shore, directly below
my landing, while the other parts of the shore
was quite distituteâI hireed an extra team, &
extra man to pitch one day & we have secured, a
fine lot of it. F. & Joshua are at it to day, I have
tried to git another team, but have not succeeded,
there is still abundanc on the shore, & I shall keep
the boys at it, as such a fine chance, sildom offers,
of so good a quality.

I expect you intend to lay down, the peice of
land you planted, back of the barn, if so, youâl
want grass seed for it,âI shouâd put on it, Â½

Dear Son

The packet did not git to her moorings, to enable
us to git the roller & seed out, untill monday
eveâ, anticipating it wouâd come, M
r
F. had prepared
the upland for the seed, Viz. the peice
where y
r
wheat was, & the strip, quite down to the
ditch, where my oats was; for the swamp part of
that; plouged, equal to any of the upland, having
been well mixed with upland soil, & frequently
ploughed, beforeâcalculation was made, to commence
opperations with the seed & roller, on tuesday

[Pg 108]

mornâ, but when the morning came, a storm
had commenced, which still continues, without intermission,
consequently, they were compelled to
suspend those oppera
ns
for the time being. They
have got in, nearly all the Indian wheat, that is
worth harvesting; that article, turns out slim;
Gen
l
Mayo, M
r
Crocker, & Cap
t
Freeman, have
abandoned the Idea of harvesting any, except, for
their hogs, in the strawâI have givin mine, (the
little strip) to my pigs, as they required itâthey
love it dearly, & thrive finely upon it.âWe think
there is somthing uncongenial in our atmospere
to that plant.

Since the storm commenced, they have been attending
to threshing wheat &c &c. M
r
Freeman
had got all the creek stuff, home, & all the salt hay
secured in
stack
, before the storm commenced, so
that you have nothing exposed to injury, except
the peat, & that is so far made, that the injury to
it, will be little, or nothing. In regard to seed, for
the swampy part of your land, we think
a bushel

will be sufficient, for what you will be able to seed
this fallâI wish you to understand, that we included,
in the 4 Acres of upland, the strip, east of
my orchard, & the whole of the south strip (next
Mrs Snows) down to the main ditchâthat strip,
has been raised & tilled so much, that it is susceptable

[Pg 109]

of the same seed, as upland, for this, you
have sent seed already. If you cannot procure
foul
meadow seed
, I should recommend that you git 3
pecks of red top, & one peck of herds grass, & mix
them, in the same bagâif you can git
foul
meadow
, Â½ bush
l
of each, that, & red top, & no
herds grass.

The Plough

I surely wrote you how the swamp ploughed
east of my orchard; that after going round; that
they had to stop the team, & work with hoes, hands
&câthere were, an abundance of large roots &
stumps, which required prying out, hauling away
&c; they have carried, somthing like a cord, to
your wood house. The plough, is A 2Â½, a larger
one, no doubt, would do better, but no plough
would turn it over smooth, while coming in contact,
every few feet, with stumps & roots that required
the team & prys to start out of their bedsâhowever,
with hoes,
elbow greass
, & the plough, it
looks as if the rollow & harrow would leave it
pritty smooth; it would add greatly to the benifit
of it, if you can git on a quantity of sand; or soil
of some kind before sowing the seed on the
swamp. I hope you will be able to be here, the last
of the week, & see, & act for yourself.

Mr. Freeman says the sheer of the plough, has
worn so small, that anew one is necessary, the present

[Pg 110]

one will not cut a furrow of any weadth, &
under those circomstances, haveing considerable
hard plouging to perform, this fall, & next spring,
perhaps it will be advisable to git a new, & larger
one, the present one can be fitted for light ploughing,
and favour the new one.

The print (Nettle)

orchard, have been assisting M

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢

Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢âs
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

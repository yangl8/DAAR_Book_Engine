PREFACE.

In my former
[1]
as also in my present work, I have taken
Seldenâs âHistory of Tithes,â ed. 1618, as my chief authority. I
adopted his views on the interpretation of King Ethelwulfâs charter
as having been the first legal title deeds of granting tithes to
the clergy.

After carefully consulting the best authorities, especially Mr.
Kemble, Mr. Haddan, and Bishop Stubbs, I have in my present
work adopted their views, that Ethelwulf granted a tenth part of
his lands and not the tithes of the lands of his kingdom.

I have also considered Archbishop Egbertâs alleged canon for
the tripartite division of tithes as an anachronism.

In preparing my former work, I laboured under the great disadvantage
of residing too far away from a good public library,
where I could consult the best and most recent authorities on
the subject.

Just as the sheets of my former work passed through the press,
a third edition of Lord Selborneâs work, âA Defence of the
Church of England against Disestablishment,â was published.
And in the following year, 1888, appeared his âAncient Facts
and Fictions concerning Churches and Tithes.â

I could only then refer in the briefest manner in my former
book to his first work. But his two works contain so many
erroneous and fallacious statements, that I thought it a public
duty to expose and refute them.

With this view and in order to prepare materials, I had taken
[vi]

steps to have access to the Library and to the manuscripts in
the Manuscript Department of the British Museum.

I had not gone far with my work when I found it absolutely
necessary to
rewrite
the whole of my âHistory of Tithes,â and to
make the present work, as it really is,
quite a new one
.

I had not only to deal with Lord Selborneâs works, but also
with historians, who wrote private letters to parsons against the
threefold division of tithes, which letters contradicted statements
made in their own histories which favoured the tripartite division
of tithes, and the Church Grith law of
A.D.
1014.

The tithe disputes in Wales brought forward crude, erroneous,
misleading and ill-digested statements about the origin and history
of tithes in this country. âOur Title Deeds,â by the Rev.
M. Fuller, is a most remarkable specimen of that class.

Directly and indirectly, I have dealt with all these matters in my
present work. I mention these facts in order to indicate the absolute
necessity I was under of
rewriting
the whole of my history.

And now in reference to Lord Selborneâs works, which, owing
to his high position, have influenced the opinions of many, one
unsound mode of reasoning runs through many parts of them,
especially his âAncient Facts and Fictions.â I mean his
inferences
from negative evidence
. And these inferences are so cleverly
and shrewdly expressed, in the special pleading style, that
although I knew they were wrong, yet I found it extremely difficult
to prove
how
they were wrong, because they were based
on
negative evidence
. This mode of reasoning in the hands of
a shrewd, clever lawyer is most powerful, misleading and embarrassing;
and is at the same time most difficult to answer from
the nature of the evidence. In order to elucidate my meaning,
I shall give one out of many examples. He wants, in support
of a certain cause, to sweep away the Church Grith law (
A.D.

1014) which enacts the tripartite division of tithes, and this is
his mode of reasoning:ââSelden and Spelman were well acquainted
with the Worcester (Cottonian) manuscript [he calls
it âThe Worcester Volumeâ on the same page]; and, as neither
[vii]

of them made mention of this Church Grith document,
it may be
inferred that they did not regard it as having the character or the
authority of a law
.â
[2]
The reader of the book would naturally
suppose that Selden and Spelman
had seen
the âdocument,â
although it is an unquestionable fact that
they had never seen it
,
simply because it was never in Sir Robert Cottonâs library during
his lifetime for them to see. I could not have proved this point
if I were not aided by the official catalogue of 1632.

I have often thought that Lord Selborneâs error arose in his
assuming that all the manuscripts which are now in the Worcester
volume, Nero, A. 1, were in the same volume when Selden and
Spelman consulted it during the life of Sir Robert. If I am right,
it is a clear proof how unsound it is to draw inferences from
negative evidence, and how careless he must have been in not
having made himself
quite certain
that the âdocumentâ was in
the volume for them to see. As this is a vital point in the discussion,
I have devoted the whole of
chapter x.
in defence of
this Church Grith law. But the
most unfair
part adopted by the
opponents of this law is, that whilst they parade, with a great
flourish of trumpets, the opinions of Price and Wilkins against the
law, they carefully omit
material evidence
furnished by Archdeacon
Hale, which is dead against their opinions (see
pp. 107, 108
).

Since my former work was published, there appeared in July,
1887, the Parliamentary Return of the Tithes Commutation of
1836. I have dealt with this important information in
Chapter
XIX.
, and also in the
Appendices
.

In Chapter
XVII.
, I have given a very full account of the
enormous revenues received from tithes and house rentals by
the incumbents of parishes in the City and Liberties of London
for the spiritual work of small populations, and which revenues
have become a public scandal because valuable endowments are
thus wasted.

The âRedemptionâ of tithes is dealt with in
Chapter XVIII.

[viii]

I have inserted in
Chapter XX.
the Tithe Act of 1891.

Appendix F
contains a summary by counties of the rent
charges of England and Wales, taken from the return of 1887.

Appendix G
is an analysis of the Tithe Commutation Return
as regards (1) the number of old parishes; (2) parishes appropriated
and their vicars; (3) parishes which had not been appropriated.
Nearly one-half (or 3,864) in England were appropriated.
It was worse in Wales, for of 834 old parishes, 468 were appropriated.
When we add the sinecure rectories, pluralities and
non-residence of incumbents, we can form a correct conclusion
as regards the cause of the present position of the Church of
England in Wales.

In addition to the above, I have also given the number of
parishes in receipt of lands and money payments in lieu of tithes
by numerous Inclosure Acts.

But the most important statistics are given at
page 257
as regards
the gross aggregate amount of the âRevenues of the Church of
England.â Hitherto, very small and misleading amounts of these
revenues have been given. But the Parliamentary Return, made
up in the office of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and just published,
has now given the public, for the first time, a generally
correct idea of the gross annual amount, from
permanent sources
,
of these revenues, and also the number of benefices and parsonage
houses with their
rateable
value, which is
much less
than their

actual
value.

The Return is defective; (1) because it is framed on values
in 1886, and (2) it omits the large fluctuating incomeâabout a
million a yearâfrom fees, pew-rents, and Easter offerings.
Correctly, the gross income in 1890, was Â£6,825,730. But
the permanent income capitalized equals Â£140,000,000.

My best thanks are due to Walter de Gray Birch, Esq., of the
MSS. Department of the British Museum, for his kind assistance
and courtesy; also to the officials connected with the Library.

INTRODUCTION.

When engaged in writing the History of the Rise, Progress,
and Present Position of the Ecclesiastical Commission for England,
I had to deal with the endowments of the Church. My
desire was to collect facts as to their origin in the Christian
Church generally, and in the Church of England particularly. In
searching after truth and facts, I experienced no little difficulty
in arriving at correct conclusions, from the various contradictory
statements on the subject. One party saw in the payment of
tithes a continuity of old Scriptural laws in the Christian Church,
payment which Christians were bound to make, whether they
liked it or not; passages from the Old and New Testaments were
distorted, and forced meanings given to them; apostolical constitutions
were forged in support of their payment. What Isidore
did as regards his forged decretals we find other writers did as
regards tithes, and sham miracles are paraded in their works in
support of tithes in the Christian Church. Another party, of
whose views John Selden is the impartial exponent, took a more
correct view of the subject, and denied that the patriarchal custom,
or Mosaic law, bound Christians to the payment of tithes

quÃ¢
tithes. He asserted, with truth, that the Divine Founder
of the Christian religion and His apostles left behind them no
written instructions for the payment of tithes, but the latter did
state how the ministers were to be maintained, viz., on the purely
[xviii]

voluntary principle. I am certain it is against the whole tenour
of the New Testament writings, that any funds for the support
of those who minister at the altar, or in building or repairing
sanctuaries for divine worship, should be collected
vi et armis
.
It is revolting to all Christian principles enunciated in the New
Testament, that men should be imprisoned, or their goods seized,
or, even as it has happened in Ireland within this century, be
shot dead, because they refuse to pay tithes. But there have
been, and there are still, men in England who unblushingly justify
all the above means by which an odious and unscriptural tax
should be collected for the support of the ministers of the Church
of England. Some foolish writers assert that the payment of
tithes is not a tax. It is unquestionably a tax. On the other
hand, there have been, and there are still, in England noble-minded,
sympathetic, and large-hearted Christians, who have
conscientiously opposed such taxation as unscriptural.

For centuries after the Christian Era, the Christians paid no
tithes
quÃ¢
tithes. In some of the episcopal writings of the second
and third centuries suggestions are thrown out, but nothing more,
recommending the payment of tithes according to the Mosaic
law; certainly not with the view of handing over to the ministers
all the proceeds of such payments, but to supplement the Church
funds for the support of the poor, the fabric of the churches,
and the ministers. According to the Mosaic law, the priests
received but the one-hundredth part of the tithes, for the Levites
had also to be provided for.

It was not until the fifth century that canons were passed for
the payment of tithes. They were unknown in the British
Church when Augustine landed on our shores, at the end of the
sixth century. His mission was a mixture of good and evil. It
was good, because it introduced among the Anglo-Saxons an
[xix]

active evangelical spirit. It was evil, because it formed the first
link of an alliance between the Church of England and the
Church of Rome. From that time forward the bishops of Rome
interfered in the discipline and doctrines of the English Church.
They sent their legates to England to attend provincial synods
and to pass canons for the payment of tithes, without consulting
the laity. The Church of Rome never allows the laity to have a
share or a voice in any ecclesiastical matters. That was always,
and is still, the most prominent feature in her organization. In
the eighth century, tithe free-will offerings were first given in England
by a few individuals. In the ninth century Charlemagne
passed the first lay law for the payment of tithes in his dominions.
This was a great victory gained by the Church. His father, in

A.D.
755, gave Ravenna to Pope Stephen III., and thus initiated
the temporal territorial power of the popes. Milman in his
history gives a sad account of the working of the tithe law in
the Emperorâs territories, so different to the teaching and spirit
of the Gospel! The laity, however, refused to pay the tax.

In England, the
custom
of giving tithes as free-will offerings
gradually began, as I stated above, in the eighth century, or
eleven hundred years ago. The clergy were then quite satisfied
with such voluntary offerings. A few only at first gave them;
then the number gradually increased, by means of the pressure
exercised in the confessional box, in the ninth, tenth and eleventh
centuries, until it finally became
customary
for
all
to pay their
tithe offerings. The usual question put by the priest from the
confessional box was, Did they duly pay their tithes to God?
In
A.D.
850 a German bishop in his visitations had specially this
article of inquiry, âSi decimas recte darent?â The custom in
England gradually changed into a
common right
, and it was by
virtue of this common right that people were legally bound to
[xx]

pay tithes. There was no positive law made for their payment.
But here is their injustice. When this
custom
commenced, the
population of England and Wales could not have exceeded
160,000, with less than a quarter of a million of acres under
cultivation, and yet this
custom
, originating under the above circumstances,
generated a
common law right
, which legally bound
all subsequent generations to the payment of predial, mixt, and
personal tithes. I call this barefaced injustice. It is utterly
wrong to state, as some Church defenders do, that all the parochial
tithe endowments were
voluntarily
bestowed on the Church by
the landowners. In a subsequent part I have explained the 2
and 3 Edw. VI., c. 13, s. 5, about barren and waste grounds
brought into cultivation, and also the lands and corn rents awarded
in lieu of tithes by the various Inclosure Acts passed in the last
and present centuries.

Certain writers argue in the most unreasonable manner against
the division of tithes in England, and assert that the parson was
legally entitled to, and had enjoyed, all his tithes without diminution.
Lord Selborne, in his recent works, is the latest supporter
of this erroneous view. In another part I have fully explained
how untenable these views are.

The Norman monks initiated the appropriation of tithes to
monastic bodies. The lands belonging to the four privileged
orders were specially exempted from paying tithes, whilst others
purchased bulls of exemption from the popes.

The Third and Fourth Lateran Councils, held in 1180 and
1215 respectively, issued decrees against Infeudations and for the
payment of tithes. The latter council gave the English parson
a common right to parochial tithes. General Councils in which
the laity were unrepresented, had no right to pass decrees for the
disposal of the private property of the laity to whatever religious
[xxi]

purpose they wished, or for the payment of tithes. Their functions
were confined to the discipline and doctrines of the Church.

When monasteries and chantries were swept away by Henry
VIII. and his son, the lands, tithes, and all other kinds of property
passed to the Crown, and the Crown granted the greater
part of the tithes to bishops and chapters in exchange for landed
estates which were granted to laymen, many of whose posterity or
assignees hold them at the present day. In Edward VI.âs reign
about six millions of acres were under cultivation, but from that
time to the present over twenty millions of acres of waste lands
have been brought under cultivation, and for which tithes are paid.

From
A.D.
1547 to 1890, about 5,000 new parishes and districts
have been formed, of which 1,530 were formed from
A.D.
1547 to
1818, and about 3,470 from 1818 to the end of 1890.

Towards the end of the first quarter of the present century
there arose a cry for Church Reform. Dr. Howley, Archbishop
of Canterbury, was the first to take steps, in 1829, to reform
the then existing abuses in the Established Church, as to episcopal
revenues, commendams, non-residence of incumbents,
sinecures, pluralities, etc., which were like so many cancers
eating away the body politic. This led to Earl Greyâs Royal
Commission of Inquiry, dated 23rd of June, 1832; to Sir Robert
Peelâs Commission, dated 4th February, 1835; to the five remarkable
reports of this Commission; to the Episcopal Act and Tithe
Commutation Act of 1836; to the Ecclesiastical Commission for
England, 1836; to the Pluralities Act of 1838; to the Cathedral
Act of 1840; in fine, to the passing, from 1836 to 1890, or fifty-five
years, of about one hundred and thirty statutes directly and
indirectly affecting the Church of England, besides some
thousands of Orders in Council, having the force of Acts of
Parliament when published in the
London Gazette
. Yet many
[xxii]

Churchmen boastingly assert that the Church of England has
received no help from the State (!) The Ecclesiastical Commission
is actually a State Department. And what amount of
money would have remunerated the members of the various
successive governments from 1832, who boldly stepped forward
to drag the State Church out of that sink of abuses in which the
first Reformed Parliament found her? If our leading statesmen
in and after 1832 had not promptly and energetically taken steps
to reform the flagrant abuses of the Church, it could not possibly
long survive as an Established Church.

The Commutation Act of 1836 settled a long-burning question.
The gross value of the tithes was about six millions. These were
commuted to four millions. The landlords not only gained two
millions, but also increased rentals from the improvements which
their tenants made when the tithe was commuted into a corn rent
payable in money and permanent in quantity, but fluctuating
yearly in value, so that any improved value given to land would
not increase the amount of the rent charge. Again, the landlords
gained about half a million a year by the various changes
which were made in the extraordinary tithe rent charges. By the
Commutation Act, the landlords and not the tenants are the real
tithe-rent payers. But the landlords having contracted themselves
out of the 80th clause of that Act, and having arranged
with the tenants to pay the tithe rent-charge, a good deal of ill-feeling
has sprung up in certain parts of the country, especially in
Wales, on the part of the farmers against the tithe-owners. The
Tithe Act of 1891 makes the owner of the lands and not the
occupier liable for the tithe-rent charge.

Henry VIII., as âSupreme Head of the Church of England,â
made no change in her doctrines, and the clergy received their
tithes as hitherto for saying masses for the repose of the souls of
[xxiii]

departed parishioners, granting absolution, teaching transubstantiation
and doctrines as regards purgatory. The tithes and landed
endowments were originally granted for teaching these doctrines.
But in the reigns of his son and Elizabeth changes were made in
both ritual and doctrines, and those incumbents who refused to
adopt the doctrines, framed in accordance with those used in the
Primitive Christian Church, were deprived of their incumbencies
and consequently of their tithes and other Church endowments.
But there was no physical transfer made then of such endowments,
and the Church was the same Church of England, but
reformed. Their successors, who embraced the doctrines against
masses, purgatory, absolution, confession, transubstantiation, etc.,
were appointed on the condition of strictly complying with the
Act of Uniformity and of the doctrines enunciated in the Thirty-nine
Articles. It was in virtue of such compliance that they were
put in possession by Acts of Parliament of the tithes and other
endowments of the Church, which their predecessors had enjoyed.
It was purely a change of usufructuary possessors without the
least disturbance of the property. The new tenant solemnly
engaged to comply with the new laws of the Church; the old
tenant refused to do so, and had therefore to leave. That was
all. The incoming trustee held his endowments by a Parliamentary
Title. The present usufructuary possessors of Church
endowments hold them also on the above conditions, and by the
same Parliamentary Title. And as Parliament gave the Title,
it can also change the Title. But how do matters stand now?
Dr. Vaughan, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Salford, in a small
pamphlet recently published, says of the Church of England, âIts
bishops, ministers and people are busily engaged in ignoring or
denouncing those very articles which were drawn up to be their
eternal protest against the old religion. The sacramental power
[xxiv]

of orders, the need of jurisdiction, the Real Presence, the daily
sacrifice, auricular confession, prayers and offices for the dead,
belief in purgatory, the invocation of the Blessed Virgin and the
saints, religious vows, and the institution of monks and nunsâthe
very doctrines stamped in the Thirty-nine Articles as fond fables
and blasphemous deceitsâall these are now openly taught from a
thousand pulpits within the Establishment, and as heartily embraced
by as many crowded congregations. Even the statue of the
Blessed Virgin Mary has been recently enthroned upon a majestic
altar under the great dome of St. Paulâs.â From these facts
Bishop Vaughan claims that England is already âhalf Catholic.â

[1]

A HISTORY OF TITHES.

CHAPTER I.

BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN ERA.

The first instance on record of the payment of tithes is found in
Genesis xiv. 20, when Abraham, after having rescued Lot, was
returning a victor from the battle with the spoils of war. King
Melchizedek met him on the way, and Abraham gave him, in his
office of priest of God, âtithes of all.â It is a disputed point
whether Abraham meant a tithe of all his property or of all spoils
of war which he had with him.

The next instance we find is the vision of Jacobâs ladder. He
vowed to God âOf all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give
the tenth unto Theeâ (Gen. xxviii. 22). It is laid down in
the Mosaic law, âAnd thou shalt surely tithe all the
increase
of
thy seed, that the field brought forth year by yearâ (Deut. xiv.
22). It is important to note the word âincreaseâ in this passage,
which in our law courts had often decided disputed cases, whether
certain things were tithable or not. For instance, Were all herbs
tithable? Only those which man eats. In Leviticus xxvii. 30-32,
âAll the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or
of the fruit of the tree, is the Lordâs: and the tithe of the herd, or
of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth
shall be holy unto the Lord.â It was the custom for a person to
[2]

be at the sheep-cot with a coloured rod, and as the sheep came
out one by one, every tenth was marked with this rod; and that
is what is meant by âpassing under the rod.â

The priests at Jerusalem received the first fruits and heave
offerings, but not the tithes. The heave offerings were the one-sixtieth
of the gross produce. But the tithes were devoted to
the whole tribe of Levi at Jerusalem, and they gave the tithe of
their tithes to the priestsâthat is, one-hundredth part. It was
from this custom, and in order to support the Crusades, that the
popes of Rome exacted, early in the fourteenth century, the first
fruits and the tithe of the tithes from the hierarchy and beneficed
clergy, who were under their spiritual jurisdiction. And when
King Henry the Eighth displaced the pope and assumed the
supreme authority in the Church, he also exacted the first fruits
and tenths. Queen Anne, by an Act passed in 1704, gave the
first fruits and tenths back to the Church for the special purpose
of augmenting poor livings.

After the destruction of the second temple and the dispersion
of the Jews, the payment of tithes among the Jews ceased, because
they thought that Jerusalem alone was the place where
tithes ought to be paid, and also because it became impossible to
trace out the tribe and priesthood to whom alone they were to be
paid. It is a question whether the Jews who were converted to
Christianity before the destruction of the second temple had
paid tithes to the Levites.

The heathen nations seem to have copied and adopted the
Jewish custom of paying tithes. We read of the Greeks having
paid tithes of the spoils of war to Apollo, and of the Romans to
Hercules. But, properly speaking, they were not the sort of
tithes mentioned in the Mosaic Law. They were only arbitrary
vows and offerings; but no conclusion can be drawn that they
[3]

were tithes because tenths were given. Sometimes the heathen
offered more and sometimes less than one-tenth.

Some ardent supporters of the payment of tithes make themselves
ridiculous in tracing their origin to Adam. They state that
Adam paid tithes. Here is their story as stated by Selden: âGod
charged Adam when there was but one man in the world that he
should give Him the tenth part of everything, and to teach his
children to do the same; but as there was no man to receive it
for Holy Church, God commanded that the tenth part of everything
should be burned. In the offerings of Cain and Abel, Abel
tithed truly of the best, but Cain tithed falsely of the worst.
Cain killed Abel because he said he tithed evil. So people must
see that false tithing was the cause of the first murder, and it
was the cause that God cursed the earth.â
[3]

It is very wrong that Scriptural passages, such as that given
above, should be distorted in order to induce people to pay tithes
to âHoly Church.â

[4]

CHAPTER II.

FROM THE CHRISTIAN ERA TO THE COUNCIL OF MASÃON.

In Apostolical times the Christian ministers were supported by
voluntary contributions out of a common fund, and this practice
prevailed for four hundred years.
[4]
Those who preached the
Gospel lived by the Gospel, but this Scriptural statement did not
mean, as some assert, that they were to live on the payment of
tithes, otherwise it would have been stated. St. Paul ordered
weekly collections to be made for the saints in the Churches of
Galatia and Corinth (1 Cor. xvi. 1, 2). The voluntary contributions
of the faithful were collected and put into a common
treasure (Acts ii. 44; iv. 34). The liberality of the Christians
then far exceeded anything which could have been collected from
tithes. And even if tithes had been exacted, it is exceedingly
doubtful whether the progress of Christianity would not have
been materially checked at its outset.

The Jewish Law, as regards the payment of tithes, was not
binding on Christians, no more than the custom of bigamy and
polygamy adopted by the Israelites is binding on the Christian
Church. There is no injunction in the New Testament binding
Christians to pay tithes to their ministers. And when the payment
was first urged in the Christian Church, it was supported by
references to the Mosaic Law and not to St. Paulâs words, viz.,
âThat those who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.â
[5]

There was a growing habit of looking upon the clergy as the
successors and representatives of the Levites under the Old Law,
and this habit had given an impulse to that claim which they set
up to the payment of tithes by the laity.
[5]

The Apostolical Constitutions for the Christian Church, collected,
as it is alleged, by Pope Clement I., the successor as is
said of St. Peter, first bishop of Rome, were fabricated more than
eight centuries after apostolical times. Cardinal Bellarmine is
honest enough to ignore them. But they imposed on the
credulous and were accepted without criticism as genuine, even
by canonists, in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Selden thinks
they were concocted about
A.D.
1000; others think in 1042. In
these Constitutions tithes are stated to have been paid by the
Christians to the Apostles. Sir H. Spelman (p. 108) thinks the
first thirty-five canons are very ancient. âDionysius Exiguus,â
he says, âwho lived within 400 years after the Apostles, translated
them out of Greek.â

The fifth canon ordained that first fruits and tithes should be
sent to the house of the bishops and priests, and not to be offered
upon the altar. The Greek word in the copy is not Î´ÎµÎºÎ±ÏÎ¼Î¿ÏÏ. No
solid argument for the payment of tithes can be founded on this
canon, for if we take the custom of the Anglo-Saxon Churches at
the end of the sixth century, which was in accordance with that in
primitive times, we find no account for the payment of tithes.
âThere is no mention of tithes,â says Lord Selborne, âin any part
of the ancient canon law of the Roman Church, collected towards
the end of the fifth century by Dionysius (called Exiguus or the
Little), a Scythian monk who collected 401 Oriental and African
canons.â
[6]

[6]

The monks in their cells had sufficient leisure to concoct these
Constitutions, and palm them on the credulous as the genuine
production of the Apostles. The concocted Constitutions were
copied and handed down from century to century without any
attempt being made to test their genuineness and authenticity. It
seems exceedingly strange that African divines and laymen should
refer to the Apostolical Constitutions as an authority for the payment
of tithes in apostolic times, although Cardinal Bellarmine, a
great champion of âHoly Church,â ignored them.
[7]

Churchmen like Archdeacon Tillesley, many of whom are in
the receipt of tithes or tithe-rent charges, will naturally act like
drowning men, and snatch even at passing straws to save the tithes.
Could anything, for example, be more childish and absurd than
the story of tracing the payment of tithes to Adam? And what
makes the case worse is to distort Scripture so as to deceive the
people who could neither read nor write, and even those who
could read had no open Bible to consult to see for themselves
whether these things were so.

Members of the Anglican Church forget when using such
weapons as the âConstitutionsâ in support of tithes, that the very
cause of the English Reformation in the sixteenth century was the
adoption into the English Church of the traditions and errors of
the Church of Rome, which were said to have been handed down
by the Apostles in the so-called Apostolical Constitutions, although
many of them can be shown to be contrary to the Scriptures.
Archdeacon Tillesley does not defend the whole volume of the so-called
Constitutions of Clement I., but he does that part which
deals with the payment of tithes. He evidently had forgotten the
mechanical axiom, that nothing is stronger than its weakest part.
[7]

âBecause the early Christians,â he says, âwere liberal to the
Church, therefore it was reasonable that tithes in the âConstitutional
Apostolicalâ were true.â Nothing of the sort, because it
does not follow as a logical sequence.

After apostolical times, monthly offerings and oblations, we are
informed, were made in all the churches, and were used for three
purposes. (1) In maintaining the clergy; (2) in supporting the
sick and needy; and (3) in repairing the church fabric. These
monthly contributions were in the third century augmented by
grants of lands, which were annexed to churches, the revenues
derived from which were appropriated to the same three purposes.
In
A.D.
322 Constantine, the first Christian emperor,
published an edict which gave full liberty to his subjects to bestow
as large a proportion of their property to the clergy as they
should think proper. From all these sources of revenue the
Christian Church was rapidly increasing in wealth. But for
more than four hundred years after the Christian era there was no
authoritative Church canon made for the payment of tithes; and
then such canon was founded upon the Mosaic Law. The question
then is, are Christians justified in adopting the Mosaic Law
for the payment of tithes? This law had no force outside Jewish
territory. There is no order in the New Testament for their
payment. Among the Jews we fail to find such anomalies, rather
scandals and misappropriations, in respect to the distribution of
tithes, as are found in England and Wales. The gross amount
of tithe-rent charge is slightly over four millions per annum. Add
to this the extraordinary rent charges on hops, the corn rents and
extensive lands awarded in lieu of tithes by the large number of
Inclosure Acts. Among the Jews we find no record of lay impropriators,
schools, colleges, charities and hospitals receiving
tithes. Granted, for argumentâs sake, that the Christian priesthood
[8]

as succeeding the Mosaic priesthood, claimed the tithes according
to the Mosaic Law, then it is a misappropriation of tithes to give
them to those outside the priesthood, and who perform no spiritual
functions. We must therefore go back to very early times, to the
history of tithes in the Christian Church, for the beginning of the
scandalous misappropriations of tithe endowment for spiritual
purposes. In England the scandal commenced after the Norman
Conquest with the Norman monks who were in English
monasteries.

About one-fourth of the whole tithe rent charge is appropriated
or rather misappropriated to lay purposes by laymen, many of whom
are quite unconnected with the religious duties of those parishes
from which the tithes arise. Then, again, we have a large extent
of landâformerly monasticâwhich is tithe free. There are also
lands in the vicinity of large cities and towns built upon, for which
the landlords receive enormous ground rents, and when the leases
expire they take possession of the house property. But they pay
nothing to the Church for the increased value of their land, which
may be one hundred times the yearly value per acre before it was
built upon.

In the Christian Church tithes were
at first
given by the faithful
as spontaneous offerings, at the urgent solicitations of the
clergy. âNam nemo compellitur,â says Tertullian, âsed sponte
confert.â These spontaneous tithe free-will offerings were not
given in cash but in kind. Some gave a tithe of sheep, others of
wool, or of corn, etc., just according to the free-will of the donor.
This was the germ of tithes in the Christian Church, which commenced
in the fourth century, and were ordered to be paid by
canon law about the beginning of the fifth century. These canons
were framed and passed by ecclesiastics. The people who paid
had no voice in the matter. The canons which were framed
[9]

afterwards had ordered them to be paid as a right, as a divine
law of the Old Testament, and were not to be considered as free-will
offerings. Here is just that specimen of arbitrary conduct
on the part of the ecclesiastics which would only be tolerated in
the dark and middle ages. Tithes were too profitable a source of
revenue to be ignored in the Christian Church. A book entitled,
âThe Englishmanâs Brief on behalf of his National Church,â
has been published by the Society for the Promotion of Christian
Knowledge. A good cause needs no fiction to bolster it up. In
that book there is quite twice as much fiction as fact. The extensive
circulation of this mixture has embarrassed many in gaining
a correct knowledge of the tithe question from the earliest period
to the present time. It is written in the style adopted by special
pleaders. It gives a one-sided account of the subject. It asks
questions and then furnishes the answers. The answers are most
misleading and also erroneous, and it carefully omits a great deal
which could be said on the other side. I strongly object to this
way in dealing with so important a subject as the history of tithes
in this country. To be appreciated, the âBriefâ should be impartial,
which it is not. It is not my object to review the book
here
seriatim
, and to point out what is fiction and what is fact.
In my statements a good deal of the fiction is refuted indirectly
without reference to the âBrief.â But I may just indicate one
remarkable feat of fiction which appears in it. When the Christian
religion was first propagated, the writer of the âBriefâ would
have us to believe that the converted Jews transferred the payment
of their tithes from the Jewish to the Christian ministers,
just as easily and as quietly as one could transfer the payment of
a cheque from one bank to another. Here is the statement, âSo
that when the Jews and heathen became Christian, throwing off
their old religion and adopting the new religion of Christianity,
[10]

they never dreamt of being less liberal to that form of religion
which they loved the more and had adopted, than they had been
towards that which they had loved the less and had discarded.
Hence the transfer of tithes from the old religion to the new religion.â
[8]

We are not informed upon what authority this statement
is made. There is nothing about it in Josephus. There is
no order in the New Testament for the payment of tithes. No
order of a general or provincial council. We read nothing of this
in the writings of the first and second centuries. We read of exhortations
to pay tithes in the writings of the third and fourth
centuries. We read of canons having been made for their payment
in the fifth century. But I have failed to find any evidence
to support the statement quoted above from the âBrief.â

The Provincial Council of French bishops, held at MasÃ§on in

A.D.
586, is commonly considered to have been
the earliest council

which ordained the payment of tithes. It ordained, âUt decimas
ecclesiasticas omnis populus inferat, quibus sacerdotes aut in
pauperum usum, aut in captivorum redemptionem erogatis, suis
orationibus pacem populo ac salutem impetrent.â Isidore, in his
compilation of decrees of councils, makes no reference to this
council. Friar Crab is the first to have mentioned it in his
edition of the councils under Charles V.

Lord Selborne considers the canon of this council as spurious,
because it proves too much, for it wanted to prove that the
Mosaic Law, as regards the payments of tithes, was regarded in

A.D.
586 not only as binding from the first upon Christians, but
also as having been for centuries universally observed. This was
going too far, in his lordshipâs opinion, and therefore he stamped
it as spurious. Selden was the first to throw considerable doubt
[11]

upon the genuineness of this canon at the Council at MasÃ§on.
[9]

The mistake originated in calling the offerings and oblations tithes.
The same mistake is repeated by writers at the present time. For
instance, Dr. J. S. Brewer, in his âEndowments and Establishment
of the Church of England,â 2nd Edition, 1885, translates
âportionesâ (quoted from Bede),
tithes
. Pope Gregory says in
his reply to Archbishop Augustineâs question, âCommuni autem
vita viventibus jam de faciendis
portionibus
, vel exhibenda hospitalite
et adimplenda misericordia, nobis quid erit loquendum.â
âBut as for those who live in common, why should we say anything
now of making
portions
?â etc. Brewer translates the
passage thus, âAs for those who are living in common, I need
give no advice about dividing
tithes
,â etc. Now, the Latin word
for tithe is decima, and is so used in all the monastic charters.
The same writer states, and he is followed by writers of leaflets
for the Church Defence Institution, that the scriptural precept,
âTo live of the Gospelâ (1 Cor. ix. 14), refers to the payment of
tithes. I am certain that St. Paul never intended anything of the
sort. I fully admit that the passage may cover a tithe free-will
offering, as it would any other free-will offering, but I cannot
admit that it implies a compulsory payment of tithes, that is, to
carry it to its logical sequence, a distraint on the goods of a person
who is unable or unwilling to pay tithe. Such compulsion
would be contrary to the spirit of the Gospel of Christ.

I hold strongly to the view that free-will offerings are the only
scriptural mode for the maintenance of the Christian ministry,
and these are the same kind of offerings to which Pope Gregory
referred in his answers to Augustineâs questions.

The instances are many in which words of old authors and
passages of Scripture are not only strained but intentionally distorted,
[12]

in order to show the early origin of tithes. There is
nothing gained, but much confidence lost, in this critical age by
distorting the meaning of, or giving a forced interpretation to,
plain words of Scripture, or of secular and religious writers.

The Christian religion had been introduced into Britain at a
very early date, and from Britain it passed over to Ireland. Ireland
was specially remarkable for her evangelical missionary
monks, who visited Scotland, England, and the Continent, for the
purpose of converting the heathen. Its geographical position
favoured a quiet, retired and contemplative life. Britain served
as a
buffer
for many centuries against the piratical devastations of
the northern hordes. The inhabitants of Ireland were therefore
left in quiet and undisturbed possession of their lands, churches,
and monasteries at a time when the inhabitants of Britain were
driven from the east and south to the west of the island; their
lands were taken from them, their churches and monasteries were
pillaged, and then burnt down by the invaders.

[13]

CHAPTER III.

THE ROMAN MISSION TO ENGLAND.

In
A.D.
596 Pope Gregory, commonly called Gregory the Great,
selected Augustine, prior of St. Gregoryâs monastery in Rome, to
conduct in the same year a mission to Britain in order to convert
the people to Christianity. The journey to Britain was then
considered a hazardous undertaking, being thought in so remote
a part of the world. Even this band of Christian pioneers
became disheartened on their journey. Augustine, much discouraged,
left his companions in France and returned to Rome,
but Gregory sent him back, urging him and them to valiantly
carry out their mission.

In 597 Augustine and forty companions landed in the Isle of
Thanet. Ethelbert, a noble-hearted, liberal-minded and intelligent
heathen, was then King of Kent; but his wife, Bertha,
daughter of Charibert, King of Paris, was a Christian. Augustine
announced his arrival to the king, and the object of his mission.
The king repaired to Thanet and granted an interview to
Augustine and his companions. He was much impressed with
their external ceremonies, and permitted them to reside in Canterbury,
the metropolis of his kingdom. He presented his palace
in Canterbury to Augustine as a residence for himself and his
successors. On the 2nd of June in the same year the king
publicly declared himself a Christian and was baptized. On
the 17th November, 597, Augustine went to France and was consecrated
[14]

archbishop by the Archbishop of Arles, and returned to
England in 598.

There were at that time in the island some British Churches,
bishops and clergy, but no divisions of parishes, no parish
churches, no connection with the Roman Church, and indubitably
no tithes whatever were paid. We are therefore on solid
ground in asserting that during the first six hundred years of the
Christian era there is no genuine record of tithes in any shape
or form having been paid or given to the clergy of this island.

The Roman Mission subsequently produced mighty changes in
the Church of England through this initial connection. In the
several letters which the popes addressed to the kings and archbishops
of England in subsequent centuries, constant references
are made to Augustineâs mission; and the popes refer to this
event as the source of their supreme authority over the Church
of England.

King Ethelbertâs laws which were passed between 596 and 605,
recognise Christianity and the Christian priesthood. Bede informs
us that they were enacted by the advice of his Witan.
[10]

Article 1. âThe property of God and the Church [when
stolen, a fine of] twelve-fold; a bishopâs property, eleven-fold; a
priestâs property, nine-fold; a deaconâs property, six-fold, etc.â
[11]

The title runs thus, âThese are the dooms which King Ethelbert
established in the days of Augustine.â The Laws of Ethelbert
and other Kentish kings are taken by Mr. Thorpe from the
Textus
Roffensis
, in possession of the Dean and Chapter of Rochester,
and is the only ancient manuscript in which they are found. The
manuscript is of the twelfth century.

âWe shall hardly,â says Mr. Kemble, âbe saying too much if
[15]

we affirm that the introduction of Christianity was at least ratified
by a solemn act of the Witan.â
[12]

In 601 Augustine received his pall from Rome, died on the
26th of May, 605, and was buried in St. Augustineâs Abbey, near
the high altar. He was not of the Benedictine order of monks,
but followed the order of Pope Gregory in the cloister which he
had founded in Canterbury.
[13]
In 602 he laid the foundation of
his cathedral church in Canterbury. In 604 he ordained Mellitus,
one of his companions, bishop of London; and Justus,
another companion, bishop of Rochester. King Ethelbert granted
them London and Rochester respectively as their episcopal sees.
[14]

These bishops and their clergy were then but missionaries among
the heathen Saxons in the country, and being monks, had lived
together close to their cathedral churches, from which they proceeded
as itinerant preachers to the neighbouring localities. The
bishopâs church was at first the only one in his diocese, hence it
was called
mater ecclesia
. Subsequently it was called the
Cathedral
Church
, because the bishopâs cathedra, sedes, stool or chair
was in the choir and on the same level with the seats of other members
of the choir. But now there are only two cathedral churches
in England in which the bishopâs seat or
throne
is in the choir, and
that in a raised position. In all the other cathedrals, the
throne

is placed outside the choir in a conspicuous part of the church.

The bishopâs circuit or diocese was the parish. It will hereafter
be shown that the origin of parishes was erroneously traced
back to the episcopal division of dioceses, when âparishâ and
âdioceseâ were synonymous.

[16]

The bishop was originally both bishop and rector of the parish
or diocese, and the episcopi clerici were his curates.

Augustine, Mellitus, and Justus, and their respective clergy
were supported by the offerings and oblations of their flocks,
which were brought to the bishopâs house, and put into a common
fund, which was disposed of by the bishop himself. Canon law
gave the bishop the right over all these collections.

Augustine asked Pope Gregory, âInto how many portions ought
the oblations given by the faithful to the altar to be divided?â
âDe his quÃ¦ fidelium oblationibus accedunt altari, quantÃ¦
debeant fieri portiones?â He answered, âThat all emoluments
which accrue ought to be divided into four portions, namely, one
for the bishop and his family, because of hospitality and entertainments;
another for the clergy; a third for the poor; and the
fourth for the repair of churches.â âUt in omni stipendio, quod
accedit, quatuor debeant fieri portiones; una, videlicet, episcopo
et familiÃ¦ propter hospitalitatem atque susceptionem, alia clero,
tertia pauperibus, quarta ecclesiis reparandis.â

The pope added, âBut because your brotherhood has been
brought up under monastic rules, you ought not to live apart from
your clergy in the English Church, which, by Godâs assistance,
has been lately brought to the faith; you ought to follow that
course of life which our forefathers did in the time of the primitive
Church, when none of them said anything that he possessed was
his own, but all things were in common among them.â âSed quia
tua fraternitas monasterii regulis erudita, seorsum fieri non debet
a clericis suis in ecclesia Anglorum, quÃ¦, auctore Deo nuper
adhuc ad fidem adducta est, hanc debet conversationem instituere,
quÃ¦ initio nascentis ecclesiÃ¦ fuit patribus nostris; in quibus
nullus eorum ex his, quÃ¦ possidebant, aliquid suum esse dicebat,
sed erant eis omnia communia.â

[17]

He further adds, âBut as for those who live in common, why
need we say anything of making portions?â âCommuni autem
vita viventibus jam de faciendis portionibus, nobis quid erit
loquendum.â
[15]

This last passage is thus translated by Mr. Brewer and endorsed
by the new editor, Mr. Lewis T. Dibdin, a barrister: âFor
those who are living in common (
i.e.
the monks) I need give no
advice about dividing tithes or offerings among them.â
[16]
It is not
only misleading, but bad scholarship to translate âportionesâ by
âtithes.â
DecimÃ¦
is always the word used in Latin for tithes.

The quadripartite division of Church funds mentioned here by
the Pope existed in Italy and France. In Spain and other
countries the tripartite division was the custom.

Pope Sylvester, early in the fourth century, decreed, it is said,
but with which I do not agree, that the revenues of the Church
should be divided into four parts. One part should be assigned
to the bishop for his maintenance; another part to the priests and
deacons and the clergy in general; the third part to the reparation
of the churches; and the fourth part to the poor, and to the sick
and strangers.
[17]
Pope Simplicius, in the fifth century, mentions the
fourfold division of the Church funds in his third epistle. Pope
Gelasius (
A.D.
501), in his ninth epistle, renews the regulation of
Simplicius, and orders the bishops to divide their diocesan revenues
into four portions and distribute them as above indicated. This
was before the establishment of tithes.

Augustine, being a monk, could have no separate share of his
own, and the probability is that all the offerings were divided into
[18]

three but not necessarily equal parts. One part was for the maintenance
and clothing of the bishop and his clergy; a portion was
given to the poor and strangers, and a portion went towards the
repairs of the church and erecting oratories and schools.

Blackstone states that âAt the first establishment of parochial
clergy, the tithes of the parish were distributed in a fourfold
division: one for the use of the bishop; another for maintaining
the fabric of the church; a third for the poor, and the fourth to
provide for the incumbent. When the sees of the bishops became
otherwise amply endowed, they were prohibited from demanding
their usual share of these tithes, and the division was into three
parts only.â
[18]

Wharton, in his âDefence of Pluralities,â refers to the fourfold
and then to the tripartite divisions in England.
[19]

The rules and vows of the monks prevented them from being
scattered over the diocese. They lived together in common and
within their monastery. Their chief functions were to instruct
the converts, who, when duly prepared, were sent forth by the
bishop as ordained itinerant ministers to convert their countrymen
in the distant parts of the diocese where there were no churches
but crosses erected at convenient spots, and around these crosses
the people assembled to hear the word of God, to have their
children baptized, and to partake of the Sacrament of the Lordâs
Supper. Collections were always made on such occasions, which
the preachers brought and deposited at the bishopâs house for the
common fund. When the itinerant preachers saw people eager
and zealous in their religious duties, they reported the same to
the bishop, who caused to be built for them out of the common
fund some wooden chapels, which served as chapels of ease
to the mother-church. In some cases the bishop had a wooden
[19]

house constructed close to the chapel, where a priest could
permanently reside.

It is very improbable that Augustine preached or solicited the
payment of tithes. It is stated in the alleged laws of Edward the
Confessor, that âAugustine preached the payment of tithes, which
were granted by the king (Ethelbert), and confirmed by the barons
and people, but afterwards, by the instigation of the devil, many
detained them; and those priests who were rich were not very
careful in getting them,â etc.
[20]

These so-called laws are pure fabrications. Thorpe takes his
text from a Harleian manuscript written about the beginning of
the 14th century. Internal evidence condemns their genuineness,
for in law xi. there is a reference to the Church having been
exempted from paying Danegeld, and adds, âThis liberty had
been preserved by Holy Church even to the time of William the
Younger, called Rufus, who sought aid from the barons of England
in order to keep Normandy from his brother Robert when
he went to Jerusalem; and they granted him four shillings from
every ploughland, not excepting Holy Church,â etc.
[21]

The Rev. Morris Fuller, rector of Ryburgh, states, without the
slightest authority, âMay it not have a reference to the time of
Ethelbert, who began to reign in Kent
A.D.
566,
when tithes were
by law paid to the clergy
, and the time of Ina, King of Wessex, who
began to reign
A.D.
688,
when there was a law by which they were
then paid
.â
[22]
There is not one word about tithes in the laws of
Ethelbert and Ina. John Pulman, a barrister, ventilated exactly
the same opinions in 1864 in his âAnti-State Church Association
Unmasked.â Fuller copied the erroneous views of Pulman.

[20]

CHAPTER IV.

THE FIRST DOCUMENTARY STATEMENT OF TITHES IN ENGLAND.

The first genuine statement of the payment of tithes in England
appears in the second book of Archbishop Theodoreâs (668-690)
âPenitential.â It was not composed by Theodore himself, but
was drawn up under his direction and published with his authority.
They are answers given by him to questions asked him on the
subject of penance. It is edited by a âDiscipulus Umbrensium,â
or a Disciple of the Umbrians, for the benefit of the English.
There is no doubt that this Penitential is genuine. Bishop Stubbs,
Mr. Haddan and Professor Wasserschleben accept it as such.
[23]

The following three notices of tithes appear in the âPenitentialâ:

1. âPresbitero decimas dare non cogitur.â The priest is not
compelled to pay tithes.
[24]

2. âTributum ecclesiÃ¦ sit, sicut consuetudo provinciÃ¦, id est,
ne tantum pauperes inde in decimis aut in aliquibus rebus vim
patientur.â Let the offering to the church be according to the
custom of the province; that is, that no force should be put upon
the poor as to tithes or anything else.
[25]

3. âDecimas non est legitimum dare nisi pauperibus et peregrinis,
sivi laici suas ad ecclesias.â It is not lawful to give tithes
except to the poor and strangers, or laymen to their own churches.
[26]
[21]

This is a prohibition to the clergy against giving the laity presents
out of the tithes.

âThese articles,â says Lord Selborne, âput the payment of
tithes on the footing of custom, depending for its observance upon
episcopal or clerical influence, rather than ecclesiastical censures,â
[27]

the anathemas subsequently hurled against all who dared to keep
them back from Holy Church.

Theodoreâs âPenitentialâ was not a code of laws, but its contents
are very important as reflecting the custom and practice existing
with regard to tithes in that early age of the Anglo-Saxon Church.

The silence of Bede on Theodoreâs âPenitentialâ is brought
forward as evidence against it. But Haddan and Stubbs show
conclusively that âBede either did not know the book, or did not
consider Theodore as the immediate author.â
[28]

Bishop Stubbs makes a vital remark on (3). âTithes are mentioned,â
he says, âby Theodore in the genuine âPenitential,â in a
way that proves the duty of making the payment,
but not the right
of the clergy to the sole use of them
.â
[29]

Theodore encouraged landowners to build churches on their
estates by permitting them to have the appointment of the
priests who were to officiate in them.

It is remarkable that Bede, in his ecclesiastical history, mentions
the word âdecimaâ only once. It appears in bk. iv. c. 29. Writing
of Bishop Eadbert, the successor of Bishop Cuthbert at Lindisfarne,
he says, âSo that according to the law, he gave every year
the tenth part, not only of four-footed beasts, but also of all corn
and fruit, as also of garments
to the poor
.â [Ita ut juxta legem,
omnibus annis
decimam
, non solum quadrupedum, verum etiam
[22]

frugum omnium atque pomorum, necnon et vestimentorum partem,

pauperibus
daret]. The law referred to here was the Mosaic
or Divine law. Eadbert was made bishop
A.D.
688, two years
before Theodore died. He gave the tenth part
to the poor
.
Bedeâs history comes down to
A.D.
734, and yet this is the only
instance in which tithe is mentioned in his writings, and then it
was given to the poorâstrong evidence as to the common law
right of the poor to a share of the tithe.

Dr. Lingard quotes another passage from Bede, which he says
appears to him to allude to tithes, viz., âThat there was not a
village in the remotest parts of Northumbria which could escape
the payment of
tribute
to the bishop.â
[30]
If Bede alluded to
tithes, he would have written
decimÃ¦
and not
tributa
.
Tributum

is from
tribuo
, which is allied to
tribus
,
i.e.
,
pars
, and so
tribus
=
to divide into parts. Hence
tributa
= parts or portions. Bede
also uses the word âportionesâ to express the same idea without
any reference whatever to tithes. Theodore, in his âPenitential,â
uses the two words,
tributum
and
decimÃ¦
in the same passage
with separate meanings.
Tributum
âa tax, contribution, tribute,
collection, subscription.
[31]

Before leaving Theodoreâs genuine âPenitential,â I must refer
to the second revised edition of Mr. J. S. Brewerâs âEndowments
and Establishment of the Church of England,â by Chancellor
Lewis T. Dibdin, published in 1885. In his preface, the new
editor âgratefully acknowledges the valuable aid he received
from Dr. Wace and the Bishop of Chester (Dr. Stubbs, now
Bishop of Oxford) through more than one difficulty on endowments
as to which he was in doubt.â
[32]

[23]

âWith regard,â he says, âto tripartition of tithes, the documents
quoted in support of it are (as far as I am aware) a spurious
passage in the âPenitentialâ of archbishop Theodore; see Stubbsâ
âCouncils,â iii. 173, n. 203.â
[33]
In referring to the volume quoted
here, I find that the writers say nothing about this spurious passage,
but at p. 203, Haddan and Stubbs give the three passages in
Theodoreâs âPenitential,â which âPenitentialâ
they state is genuine
,
and to which I referred in a previous page. Then Mr.
Dibdin adds, âAn alleged law of Ethelred, 1013.â Where did
he get 1013? He refers to Wilkinsâs âAnglo-Saxon Laws,â p. 106,
but Wilkins gives it as a genuine law of Ethelred enacted in 1014.
The fact that he did not transfer this law to his âConciliaâ is
undoubtedly no argument against its genuineness as a law. I
refer for additional information on the law of 1014 to another
part of this book, where the Church-Grith law of Ethelred is
fully discussed.

âI will not put,â says Blackstone, âthe title of the clergy to
tithes upon any Divine right, though such a right certainly commenced,
and I believe as certainly ceased, with the Jewish theocracy.
Yet an honourable and competent maintenance for the
ministers of the gospel is undoubtedly
jure divino
; whatever the
particular mode of that maintenance may be.â
[34]
I quite agree
with these remarks. But as Mr. Serjeant Stephens, in his Commentaries,
says, âThe institution of tithes in its specific form is

odious
to the people and unsatisfactory to the political economists.â
[35]

Landownersâ Churches.

The nobility and landed gentry were not slow in fully appreciating
the advantages of resident over itinerant priests. Some of
the princes, in changing from place to place, selected certain of
[24]

the clergy to accompany them for the performance of divine
service for their families. The Thanes followed their example
and appointed chaplains, for they felt the great inconvenience,
especially in winter, in attending services at the mother-church,
which might have been at a very considerable distance from their
residences. The villagers were even in a worse condition. To
remedy these inconveniences, the landowners commenced slowly
to erect churches on their estates about
A.D.
686, but more
actively about
A.D.
700. The limits of these were conterminous
with the extent of their properties. Hence we find some of
the old parishes of very unequal extent. It is impossible to state
exactly, in the absence of documentary evidence, the origin of
the modern parish churches and much less their endowments.
âAt the original endowment,â Blackstone says, âof parish
churches, the freehold of the church, the churchyard, the parsonage
house, the glebe, and the tithes of the parish were vested
in the then parson by the bounty of the donor.â Blackstone
states here the parsonâs common law right to the tithes, but after
he receives them the same common law right obliges him to share
them according to the usage and canons of the Church. The
bishop was originally the recipient and distributor of all Church
revenues. The parochial incumbents had taken his place and
were bound to distribute them according to the original custom.
It would never suit for the poor to collect their own share of the
tithes. As Bishop Kennett says,
the parish priest was the bank
.

The manorial church was certainly the germ of the modern
parish church. And we can trace this germ back to
A.D.
686.
From that time to Edgarâs reign the germ rapidly expanded, and
the country became dotted all over with manorial or landownersâ
churches, when Edgar passed his celebrated law which gave these
with burial grounds a legal right to one-third part of the tithes of
[25]

the estate. This Act upsets Blackstoneâs statement, that the
incumbent received all the tithes of the parish. It is true what
Mr. Freeman says about the opinion of lawyers. âAs for modern
writers,â he says, âon the subject of the division of tithes, it is
utterly useless to go to the opinion of mere lawyers, Blackstone
or any other, as giving any help to either side. We may safely
go to them to learn what is the law in force at the present
moment;
for historical purposes they are worse than useless
.â
[36]
I
endorse every word he says. Mr. Fuller did not take this advice,
but quotes Blackstone as above. Lawyers are no better informed
on this point than other men. When Blackstone wrote his Commentaries,
he gave us what was then the accepted law, that
the parson had a right to the tithes, and hence he is quoted as
the best authority on this point. But he omitted to state that
although the parson is
the general collector
, is
the bank
, by
common law right, yet as trustee he is only entitled to a share of
church funds, and the poor and the church building have also
a common law right to a share of what the parson received.
Edgarâs law, which was re-enacted by Canute, gave the manorial
priest but one-third. When, then, did he get the whole? This
is answered further on.

Bede gives an account as early as
A.D.
686 of the erection of
churches by landowners on their own private estates. âNot very
far,â he says, âfrom our monastery, about two miles off, was the
country house of one Puch, an earl. It happened that the man
of God [Bishop John of Beverley] was at that time invited thither
by the Earl to consecrate a churchâ
[37]
[at South Burton, Yorkshire].

âAt another time also [
A.D.
686] he [Bishop John] was called
[26]

to consecrate the church of Earl Addi.â
[38]
These landed proprietors,
who also had the advowsons, made a provision for the
priests of their churches by erecting residential houses and attaching
to the churches some glebe lands, from five acres to a hide
and more. Add to the glebe the daily oblations. To the land
and oblations were added in course of time one-third of the tithe
of the produce of the manorial lands. Is it reasonable that a
single man should have for his
own personal use all the tithes
of the
estate, together with the glebe lands and oblations? No. Originally
he had none of the tithes, all of which went to the mother or
parish church. Edgarâs law, giving him one-third, was re-enacted
by Ethelred in 1014, and again re-enacted by Canute, and the
one-third of the tithes to the manorial church is to be seen in the
Domesday Survey of 1086. The mother or monastic church discharged
the poor manâs common-law right to a share in the tithes.
His common-law right to a share not only in tithes but in oblations
also, was as well established as that of the parsonâs. But the
parson in course of time became the recipient of all the tithes in
a manner which I shall hereafter explain, and was obliged by the
canons and custom of the church to distribute a portion to the poor
and to repair the church and defray other church expenses out of
the tithes and oblations after having allowed himself his own share.

As Christianity advanced in England the foundations of private
oratories became very numerous, for almost every great man, as
soon as he was converted to the Christian religion, built an
oratory for the convenience of his family, tenants, and dependents.
The bishops had prudently encouraged laymen to build
such churches on their estates, and allowed them to have the
advowsons. Residences for the incumbents were built close to
the churches, and the landowners endowed them with lands varying
[27]

in extent from five acres to over a hide as I have stated before.
In course of time, they endowed them with the one-third of the
tithes of their estates, transferring the remaining two-thirds to the
monastic or conventual church, which was the mother-church of
the entire parish. In these churches all seats were free. Pew-rents
were then unknown. The church built by a layman had to
be consecrated by the bishop, but the lay owner had the advowson
or nomination of the incumbent. This was the origin of lay
patronage in the Church of England. The church so built
belonged to the manor or estate. When in course of time the
property was sold or otherwise disposed of, the church and
advowson went with the property. In the change of ownerships,
the rectory and advowson were often separated from the manor,
and were at first appropriated by the owner to bishops, chapters,
or monasteries. At the Reformation, churches and advowsons,
which became the property of the Crown, were granted to laymen,
and were also granted to archbishops, bishops and chapters. The
Crown separated in some cases the advowson from the great
tithes, and sold or granted both to the same or different parties.
Therefore we find two owners instead of one. The original
patron never anticipated this change. An advowson or a rectory
may be and is possessed in shares or turns by several owners.
They are strictly treated as property and are dealt with accordingly.
The sales of advowsons are carried on at public auctions
and by private agents, and are given to the highest bidder. The
public sale-room is now less resorted to, owing to the scandal thus
created. But the sales are still vigorously pushed on
privately
by
family solicitors and professional agents. A living, for example,
is worth, say, Â£800 a year from glebe and tithe-rent charge; the
incumbent is old, and the owner of the advowson is desirous of
finding a purchaser of next nomination after the death or resignation
[28]

of present incumbent. A life-interest only is thus purchased.
There are other cases in which the advowson is completely sold.
The parishioners have no voice in the matter.

As regards the payment of tithes, I shall show that for many
years the English bishops and their clergy had threatened and
cajoled the simple-minded Anglo-Saxons into the belief that the
Church had the right to impose the Levitical obligations upon
them. We have only to read the miraculous legends recorded by
Bede and others to find out the means by which the clergy had
imposed upon the credulity of those simple-minded people. It
was by deceit, trickery, hypocrisy, and sham miracles that the
Anglo-Saxon bishops and their clergy had obtained tithes, first
as free-will offerings, then by legislative enactments, which made
these free-will offerings compulsory.

The Confessional.

The Confessional was a powerful instrument in the hands of
the clergy by which they obtained the payment of tithes. During
the archiepiscopate of Theodore (668-690) auricular confession
began to take the place of public discipline. Theodoreâs âPenitentiary,â
which was published with his authority, directed confessors
how to conduct themselves in hearing confessions and
how to enjoin penance. Confession to the priest was made
necessary, not in order to obtain his absolution, but to be informed
what sort of penance was required for every offence, and
for the several degrees and circumstances of it. The most difficult
part of the priestâs office was to proportion the private
penance to the crime, and Theodoreâs âPenitentiaryâ was looked
upon as the best rule in this particular.
[39]
It is remarkable that the
earliest mention of tithes in England is found in Theodoreâs
âPenitentiary.â

[29]

CHAPTER V.

WORKS ATTRIBUTED TO EGBERT, ARCHBISHOP OF YORK (734-766).

Briefly stated, they areâ

(1) The âPenitential,â a document of the tenth century.
[40]
There
are four books prefaced with twenty-one canons. The first book
only is Egbertâs.

(2) The âConfessional and Penitential.â The fourth book only
of the âPenitentialâ is Egbertâs. And as regards the âConfessional,â
he
may
have translated it.

(3) The Excerptions. Mr. Thorpe takes these from Cott.:
Nero, A. 1. They are in Latin, numbering 163. The first twenty-one
are ninth century canons. There is another different compilation
of excerpts in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, K. 2.
The excerptions which appear in these two manuscripts are not
Egbertâs.
[41]

Sir H. Spelman, Wilkins,
[42]
Johnson,
[43]
Bishop Kennett, Dr.
Lingard,
[44]
Kemble, Thorpe,
[45]
and others believed that the Excerptions
were written in the eighth century by the archbishop himself,
and some of these writers have referred to them in support
of the threefold division of tithes. But there is ample internal
[30]

evidence in the canons themselves to condemn them as the
genuine production of Egbert, or that they could have been written
during his archiepiscopate.

If any one should take the trouble or be obliged to refer to
Dr. Lingardâs History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church,
published in two volumes in 1845, he will observe the numerous
references which this Roman Catholic historian makes to Egbertâs
Excerptions and Penitentials, but which are now condemned as
spurious. This is a serious matter for his Church, because he
mainly supports many important acts of discipline in the Anglo-Saxon
Church by such references. But when the references are
condemned as spurious, all his arguments founded upon them
fall of course to the ground.

Mr. Haddan and Bishop Stubbs say that the excerptions are
not Egbertâs. What does Mr. Selden say? âAn antient collection
of divers canons written about the time of Henry the First,
with this inscription of equal age, âIncipiunt excerptiones Domini
Egberti Archiepiscopi Eburace Civitatis, de jure sacerdotaliâ
[= Here begin the excerptions of the Lord Egbert, archbishop of
the city of York, concerning the duty of priests], hath these words,
âUt unusquisque sacerdos cunctos sibi pertinentes erudiat, ut
sciant qualitÃ¨r decimas totius facultatis ecclesiis divinis debitÃ¨
offerant.â [That every priest teach all that belong to him to
know how they are to offer the tithes of all their substance in a
due manner to the churches of God.] And immediately follows,
âUt ipsi sacerdotes Ã  populis suscipiant decimas, et nomina
eorum, quicunque dederint, scripta habeant, et secundum authoritatem
canonicam coram testibus dividant, et ad ornamentum
ecclesiÃ¦ primam eligant partem, secundam autem ad usum pauperum
atque perigrinorum per eorum manus misericorditÃ¨r cum
omni humilitate dispensent; tertiam verÃ² sibimet ipsis sacerdotes
[31]

reservent?â [That the priests themselves receive the tithes of the
people, and write down their names and what they have given,
and divide it according to canonical authority in the presence of
witnesses, and choose the first part for the ornament of the
church, and distribute the second part with their own hands
tenderly and with all humility for the use of the poor and
strangers; and let the priests reserve the third part for themselves.]
[46]

âIf the credit of this,â continues Selden, âbe valued by the
inscription, then it is about 850 years old. For, that Egbert lived
Archbishop of York from the year 743 (?) to 767 (?). But the
authority of that title must undergo censure. Whoever made it,
supposed that Egbert gathered that law and the rest joined with
it out of some former church constitutions; neither doth the name
âExcerptionsâ denote otherwise. But in that collection some
whole constitutions occur in the same syllables, as they are in the
Capitularies of Charles the Great, as that of âunicuique ecclesiÃ¦
unus mansque integer,â etc., and some others, which could not be
known to Egbert, that died in the last year of Pipin, father to
Charles. How came he then by that? And how may we believe
that Egbert was the author of any part of those Excerptions?
unless you excuse it with that use of the middle times which often
inserted into one body and under one name laws of different ages.
But admit that; yet, what is âsecundum canonicam autoritatem
coram testibus dividantâ? The ancientest âcanonica autoritasâ
for dividing tithes before witnesses is an old Imperial, attributed
in some editions to the eleventh year of the reign of Charles the
Great, being King of France; in others to the Emperor Lothar
the First. But refer it to either of them, and it will be divers
[32]

years later than Egbertâs death. And other mixed passages there
plainly show that whosesoever the collection was, much of it was
taken out of the Imperial Capitularies, none of which were made
in Egbertâs time.â
[47]

This is a reasonable and argumentative statement of facts. In
addition to the above, I may refer to the seventh canon, âThat
all priests pray assiduously for the life and empire of our lord
the emperor, and for the health of his sons and daughters.â
Again, canon 24 is found in Charlemagneâs Capitulary of
A.D.

813. Egbert died on the 19th November, 766,
[48]
and Charles became
King of France in 768. These dates are very important in
this controversy.

The first twenty-one canons are from the Audain manuscript
in the monastery of St. Herbert in the Ardennes. Canons 22 to
28 inclusive are taken from other Gallican Capitulars. These
twenty-eight canons were made between
A.D.
789 and 816. The
remaining 135 canons are taken from other foreign sources.

It is quite unnecessary to introduce into the discussion of the
threefold division of tithes in England, doubtful canons, such as
the âExcerptionsâ of Egbert and other writings copied from them.
There are, without these, sufficient solid, genuine facts at our
command with which to prove the threefold division of tithes in
England, and these are stated further on.

[33]

CHAPTER VI.

THE FIRST PUBLIC LAY LAW FOR THE PAYMENT OF TITHES.

The first law making the payment of tithes legally imperative was
enacted in 779 by Charles, King of France, in a general assembly
of his estates, spiritual and temporal, viz., âConcerning tithes, it
is ordained that every man give his tithe, and that they be distributed
by the bishopâs command.â [De decimis, ut unusquisque
suam decimam donet, atque per jussionem pontificis dispensentur.]
[49]

Charlesâs civil law had only enforced by coercion the existing
ecclesiastical law or custom of payment of tithes; and the ecclesiastical
law was founded upon the Levitical law; but I hold that
the Levitical law, as regards tithes, was not binding on Christians.
In the New Testament there is no reference whatever to tithes
to be given to the Christian priesthood. None of the apostles
claimed tithes from their followers.

âThe growing habit,â says Kemble, âof looking upon the
clergy as the successors and representatives of the Levites under
the old law may very likely have given the impulse to that claim
which they set up to the payment of tithes by the laity.â
[50]

The establishment of the right in England followed the same
course as that in France.

[34]

It is important to give Milmanâs observations on the working
of the above law.

âOn the whole body,â he says, âof the clergy, Charlemagne
bestowed the legal claim to tithes. Already, under the Merovingians,
the clergy had given significant hints that the law of
Leviticus was the perpetual law of God. Pepin had commanded
the payment of tithes for the celebration of peculiar litanies during
a period of famine. Charlemagne made it a law of the empire;
he enacted it in its most strict and comprehensive form as

investing the clergy in a right to the tenth of the substance and of
the labour alike of freemen and serf
.â

âThe collection of tithes was regulated by compulsory statutes;
the clergy took note of all who paid or refused to pay; four or
eight, or more, jurymen were summoned from each parish as
witnesses for the claims disputed; the contumacious were three
times summoned; if still obstinate, they were excluded from the
Church; if they still refused to pay, they were fined over and
above the whole tithe, six solidi; if further contumacious, the
recusantâs house was shut up; if he attempted to enter it, he
was cast into prison to await the judgment of the next plea of
the Crown. The tithe was due on all produce, even on animals.
The tithe was usually divided into three portions, one for the
maintenance of the Church, the second for the poor, the third for
the clergy; the bishop sometimes claimed a fourth. He was the
arbiter of the distribution; he assigned the necessary portion for
the Church, and appointed that of the clergy. This tithe was by
no means a spontaneous votive offering of the whole Christian
people.
It was a tax imposed by imperial authority and enforced
by imperial power.
It had caused one, if not more than one, sanguinary
insurrection among the Saxons. It was submitted to in
other parts of the empire, not without strong reluctance. Even
[35]

Alcuin ventured to suggest that if the apostles of Christ had demanded
tithes, they would not have been so successful in the
propagation of the Gospel.â
[51]

Papal Legates in England,
A.D.
787.

For 190 years no papal legate appeared in England since
Augustine landed on our shores in 597. When Pope Gregory
sent his missionaries to England, he thought the whole country
was inhabited by English, and so ordered that there should be
two provinces, each containing twelve Episcopal sees and governed
by two Metropolitans, one at London and the other at York.
[52]

Still Gregory must have been aware of the existence of a
British Church in the island, for British bishops were present at
the Synods of Arles,
A.D.
314; Sardica, 347; and Rimini, 359.

The following historical facts should be carefully noted. Each
of the several divisions of Englandâcall them the Heptarchy
or anything elseâowed its evangelization to a source not exclusively
of the Roman mission. Kent and Essex had certainly
remained Christian under the successors of Augustine; but
Wessex, with Winchester as its capital, was converted by Birinus
a missionary from Northern Italy; East Anglia by Felix, a
Burgundian; Northumbria and Mercia by Irishmen; Essex by
Cidd and Sussex by Wilfrid. Therefore the Roman mission,
after the death of King Ethelbert whose successors relapsed into
heathenism, was rather a failure.
[53]
Augustine was narrow-minded
and sectarian, attached to everything Italian. There were seven
British bishops then in England. In 602 a meeting was held
at which representatives of the Italian and British Churches were
present. Augustine demanded that the Celtic Church should
[36]

change the time of keeping Easter in order to adopt the Roman
time. The British bishops declined to do anything of the
sort, and then Augustine lost his temper and rebuked them.
His conduct thus exasperated the members of the Celtic Church.
The Italians were looked upon as foreigners seeking to lord it
over the native Church, and the Scots and Britons were determined
to yield their independence to neither threats nor
entreaties.

Augustine claimed metropolitan power, but the Celtic bishops
haughtily rejected such a proposal.

On the death of Ethelbert, and when a difference arose between
his son who succeeded him and Laurentius the archbishop,
Laurentius, Mellitus and Justus, were about to throw up the
Italian mission in England and retire to Gaul.
[54]
London was
lost, and the whole aspect of the Roman mission was gloomy in
the extreme, when the second Archbishop died in 619. Mellitus
the third died in 624. Justus who succeeded him had consecrated
Paulinus on the 21st of July, 625, as the first Archbishop
of York. In 627 King Edwin held a WitenagemÃ³t in a
room

where the introduction of Christianity into the Kingdom of
Northumbria was discussed. The result was that the king and
his nobles were converted to the Christian religion.
[55]
The
fact that a room was capable of accommodating the WitenagemÃ³t
has led to the conclusion that the number must be small.
Paulinus had fled from York in 633, eight years after his consecration,
and after the battle of Heathfield. But his place was
taken by Bishop Aidan, a missionary from Columbaâs Irish
monastery in Iona, who had established an Episcopal see in
Lindisfarne.

[37]

There is a letter of Pope Boniface V. to Archbishop Justus,
written between April, 624, and October, 625, conferring on him
the primacy of all Britain and ending with these words, âHanc
autem ecclesiam utpote specialiter consistentam sub potestate et
tuitione sanctÃ¦ RomanÃ¦ ecclesiÃ¦.â
[56]
[But this Church as specially
remaining under the power and instruction of the Roman
Holy Church.]

In 634, Pope Honorius I. conferred on Archbishop Honorius,
seven years after his consecration, the primacy of all Britain.
[57]

But there is no evidence to show that the Celtic bishops
acquiesced in this power of metropolitan over all England conferred
by the Pope on the Archbishop of Canterbury. It was
therefore an arbitrary assumption of ecclesiastical authority
exercised by the Pope of Rome over the Anglo-Saxon Church,
simply because a Roman mission was sent to Christianize the
Saxon heathen. But other missionaries were at work in the same
field, who were quite unconnected with Rome or its bishop.

The time of keeping Easter was the terrible stumbling-block
in the way of a union between the Roman and Celtic missionaries.

In
A.D.
664, a synod was held at Streaneshalch; the subject
of the proper time of keeping Easter was discussed in the presence
of King Oswy of Northumberland by Bishop Colman and
Wilfrid. In the same year Deusdedit, Archbishop of Canterbury,
died. The result was that the king espoused the Roman style.
[58]

Then followed an interregnum of four years. Wilfridâs strong
opinions about Easter kept him out of the archiepiscopate.

It is vitally important to note this turn of the tide to Rome. I
take all particulars from Bedeâs Ecclesiastical History. If this
[38]

turn had not occurred there would have been two separate and
independent Churches in England, the Celtic and the Roman.

In 664 a synod was convened in the monastery of Streaneshalch
(Whitby) presided over by King Oswy, who was at first a
follower of the Celtic ritual, for the discussion of the proper time
for keeping Easter. Bishop Colman spoke for the Celtic Church;
Priest Wilfrid for the Roman time. The latter had previously
gone to Rome to learn the ecclesiastical doctrine. Colman
traced the Celtic time to the teaching of St. John the Evangelist;
Wilfrid traced his to St. Peter, and then quoted, âThou art
Peter and upon this rock I will build My Church and the gates of
hell shall not prevail against it; and to thee I will give the keys of
the Kingdom of Heaven.â This quotation turned the scales, as
will be seen from what followed. âIs it true, Colman,â said the
King, âthat these words were spoken to Peter by our Lord?â
âIt is true, O King!â âCan you show,â said the King, âany
such power given to your Columba?â Colman answered âNone.â
âThen,â added the King, âdo you both agree that these words
were principally directed to Peter, and that the keys of heaven
were given to him by our Lord?â They both answered, âWe
do.â Then the King concluded, âAnd I also say unto you that
he is the door-keeper, whom I will not contradict, but will, as
far as I know and am able in all things, obey his decrees, lest
when I come to the gates of the Kingdom of Heaven, there
should be none to open them, he being my adversary who is
proved to have the keys.â The King having said this, all present
resolved to conform to the Roman ritual.
[59]
This was not the first
nor the last case in England in which St. Peter and the power of
the keys did good duty for the Church of Rome. The result of
[39]

this discussion turned the scales from Irish to Roman Christianity
as the religion of England.

King Oswy had, before the synod met, held the Celtic views.
His son, who was present, held the Roman views. The result of
this discussion led to serious changes in the Church of England,
for in the same year,
A.D.
664, the archbishopric of Canterbury
became vacant, and Kings Oswy and Egbert sent to Rome Wighard,
an Englishman, whom they appointed, there to be consecrated archbishop
by the Pope, because there was no metropolitan in England
to perform this duty of consecration. He died there, and then the
Pope was empowered by the same kings to select and consecrate
a suitable person himself. âWe have not been able,â writes Pope
Vitalian, ânow to find a man docile and qualified in all respects
to be a bishop according to the tenor of your letter.â
[60]
Again,
âKing Egbert, being informed by messengers that
the bishop they
had asked of the Roman prelate
was in the kingdom of France.â
[61]

From these two quotations, it is beyond all doubt or question
that the English kings did ask the Pope to select a qualified
person for the see of Canterbury. And it is absurd for Protestant
writers, such as Soames, in the face of these quotations, to assert
that Theodoreâs appointment was a piece of skilful manÅuvring
on the part of the Pope. It was nothing of the sort. It is but
reasonable to assume that when Wighard died in Rome, Vitalian
wrote at once and informed the English kings of the event, and that
they then, although we have not their letters, asked the Pope to
choose a man for them. He therefore consecrated Theodore, a
Greek by birth and education. We all know what followed. In
the same year the Pope conferred on Theodore the âsupremacy
over all England.â
[62]
He landed in England in 669, and held his
[40]

see for twenty-one years. The Churches of the Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms were independent of each other up to the arrival of
Theodore, who had energetically worked to unite all the Churches
under the metropolitan power of Canterbury. Here then we are
on solid ground. The Popeâs supremacy over all the Churches
in England dates from the archiepiscopate of Theodore.

There is no reference to tithes from the publication of
Theodoreâs âPenitential,â probably about
A.D.
686, until the two
legates came to England in 787, or a period of one hundred years,
Archbishop Boniface of Mentz, writing to Archbishop Cuthbert
between 746 and 749, refers to tithes having then been received
by English bishops, âIn daily offerings,â he says, âand
tithes of the faithful, they receive the milk and wool of the sheep
of Christ, but they take no care of the Lordâs flock.â [âLac et
lanas ovium Christi oblationibus cotidianis ac decimis fidelium
suscipiunt; et curam gregis Domini deponunt.â
[63]
] Here is an
early instance of endowed bishops neglecting their flocks.

This brief sketch will enable the reader to follow further
particulars.

King Offa.

Pope Adrian I. had risen from the position of a subject of the
empire to that of a sovereign prince through the instrumentality
of Charlemagne. Jaenbert, archbishop of Canterbury, thought
that by the same person he could exercise sovereign authority,
like the Bishop of Rome, over the kingdom of Kent as feudatory
of Charlemagne. Offa, the Mercian king, had assumed the title
of King of Kent and treated it as a province of Mercia. The
King of France was too shrewd a diplomatist to encourage such
[41]

a foolish idea as that of the Archbishop against the terrible and
powerful Offa. But Offa found out this prelateâs intrigues, and
instead of sending an army to Kent to crush Jaenbert, he adopted
another line of policy of dividing his ecclesiastical province, and
having a full-blown archbishop in his own kingdom of Mercia,
with his seat at Lichfield, and endowed with the revenues which
Jaenbert had drawn from that part of his province.
[64]

Offa had thus touched Jaenbertâs pocket, a very sore point
with some people. In order to carry out his design of changing
the bishopric of Lichfield into an archbishopric with metropolitan
powers, he sent a special mission to the Pope, and it was during
this negotiation that the shrewd Adrian came on the scene in
English history. Adrian had reason to fear Offaâs power, for there
is a letter from Offa to Charlemagne, intriguing to depose Adrian,
and put a Frenchman in the chair of St. Peter.
[65]

Higbert, bishop of Lichfield (c. 779), was made archbishop by
Offa in 785; he first signs the charter as archbishop in 788, but
could not act as Metropolitan, and so be on an equality with
the Metropolitans of Canterbury and York, without the pallium,
which it was taken as granted could only be given by the Pope.
The pallium is a long strip of fine woollen cloth, ornamented
with crosses, the middle of which was formed into a loose collar
resting on the shoulders, while the extremities before and behind
hung down nearly to the feet. This pallium gave him the power
to ordain the bishops of his province, or to summon them to his
synod, or to sit on the archiepiscopal throne. It was the sign of
the Popeâs confirmation of his appointment as archbishop.

The Roman Curia at first hesitated to comply with the Kingâs
request. Offa was determined to carry his point, and he knew
[42]

well by what means he could realize his object. He resorted to
wholesale bribery among the Roman officials, and thus gained
his point.
[66]
Peterâs pence probably was also part of the bargain.
[67]

I have gone into details on this subject on account of the
results which followed. Hitherto the Church of England was
practically independent of the Roman Church. But here was a
splendid opportunity for so astute a diplomatist as Adrian to
advance Papal supremacy over the Anglican Church. Certainly,
Theodoreâs appointment was a great step in the same direction.

The Pope proposed, and Offa consented, that a mission should
be sent to England with a view of holding a council in Mercia,
and of making such regulations in the disorganized Church as
may be found necessary. Thus the Anglican Church lost her
independence, and subsequently became a slave to a foreign
bishop and the Roman Curia. For what? What was the
quid
pro quo
? To convert the bishopric of Lichfield into an archbishopric
with metropolitan power from 788 to 801. The price
was too much. Higbert was the only person who ever bore the
title of archbishop of Lichfield. He died in 801, and his successor
bore the title of bishop.

Legatine Councils in England.

In 786, the two papal legates, accompanied by Wighood, a
French abbot, sent by Charlemagne to assist them, reached
England with letters from the Pope to King Offa, Aelfwold, King
of Northumbria, and to the two archbishops.

George, Bishop of Ostia, went to King Aelfwoldâs court, and
Theophylact, Bishop of Todi, repaired to Offaâs. These kings
[43]

then summoned councils of their chief men, both spiritual and
temporal. The Northern Council assembled in 787; Offaâs
Council assembled at Calchyth,
i.e.
Chelsea, London, in the
same year. The legates placed before each Council the twenty
Injunctions, which were drawn up at Rome previous to their
departure. After the Injunctions were read out at each Council,
they were signed by the two kings, the princes, two archbishops,
bishops, and abbots. These ecclesiastical synods, presided over
by the kings, were WitenagemÃ³ts, and the twenty Injunctions
were so many laws regularly and legally passed. The 17th Injunction
relates to tithes; therefore the payment of tithes received
on this occasion a legal sanction in the two kingdoms of Mercia
and Northumbria. Here then we put our fingers on the first
case in which tithes in England had been legally ordered to be
paid. Previous to 787 there existed the custom of voluntarily
paying tithes. Some paid, and some did not. But in this year
and in these two kingdoms only, the custom was made a legal
obligation by the two Anglo-Saxon Parliaments.

âWhat copy,â says Selden, âof this synod the centuriators
had, or whence they took it, I find not. But if it be good
authority,
it is a most observable law to this purpose
. Being made
with such solemnity by both powers of both states of Mercland
(Mercia) and Northumberland, which took up a very great part
of England; and it is likely that it was made general to all
England.â
[68]
It is most important to note that for 120 years after
these legatine councils were held, there is a dead silence in our
laws and chronicles as regards the payment of tithes.

The legates, on their return to Rome, made a report to the
Pope of their proceedings in England. The document was published
in
A.D.
1567 at Basle by the Magdeburg Centuriators, from
[44]

a manuscript of which they give no account.
[69]
It contains, however,
as Lord Selborne admits, abundant internal proof of authenticity.
[70]

Yet he adds: âBut because it is not probable that, if
the Injunctions which we now know from this source only had
entered into the body of the public law of the three greatest
Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the eighth century, they would, in this
country, have entirely disappeared.â
[71]
When such arguments
from negative evidence as to laws are urged, I always think of
Mr. Thorpeâs wise remarks, that âwhat we now possess of Anglo-Saxon
laws is but a portion of what once existed.â
[72]
It contains
twenty Injunctions, and was signed by the two kings and all the
bishops, including an Irish and Welsh bishop.

In this document the object of the mission is thus stated: âTo
travel through and visit the island, and to confirm the authority
of the Roman Pontiff acquired there formerly through the mission
of Augustine.â
[73]

First Civil Law in England for Payment of Tithes.

The seventeenth Injunction is this:

âOf giving tithes, as it is written in the law. Thou shalt bring
the tenth part of all thy crops or first fruits into the house of the
Lord thy God. Again, by the prophet: âBring,â he says, âall the
tithe into My barn, that there may be meat in My house, and
prove Me upon this if I shall not open unto you the windows of
heaven, and pour out a blessing even to abundance, and I will
rebuke the devourer for your sake, who eats and spoils the fruit of
your land, and your vineyard shall no more be barren.â As a
[45]

wise man says, âNo man can justly give alms of what he possesseth,
unless he had first separated to the Lord what he from
the beginning directed to be paid to Him.â And on this account
it often happens that he who does not give a tenth is himself
reduced to a tenth. Wherefore we solemnly enjoin that all be
careful to give tithes of all that they possess, because it is the
special part of the Lord God; and let a man live on the nine
parts and give alms, and we advise that these things should be
done secretly, because it is written, âWhen thou doest thine alms,
do not sound a trumpet before thee.ââ
[74]

âThe terms of this article,â says Lord Selborne, âspeak for
themselves; their character is evident, being that of a
pastoral
precept, not legal enactment
.â
[75]
He therefore rejects this as a civil
enactment for payment of tithes.

âThere can be no doubt,â says Haddan and Stubbs, âthat the
legatine canon, approved by the kings and Witan, had the force
of law, although it is uncertain by what means the law was
enforced, or whether it was enforced at all.â
[76]

And Bishop Stubbs says in his history, âIn 787 tithe was
made
imperative
by the legatine councils held in England, which,
being attended and confirmed by the kings and ealdormen, had
the authority of WitenagemÃ³ts.â
[77]

On the legal aspect of this question, Bishop Stubbs and Mr.
Selden are correct. The tithe Injunction was not made legal or
imperative by legatine councils
quÃ¢
legatine councils, but because
these councils were actual WitenagemÃ³ts, whose consent gave it
the force of law in the respective kingdoms of the two kings.
[46]

They made
legal
what was before
customary
, without attaching
any punishment to its non-fulfilment. It will be seen as we
proceed that the Anglo-Saxon laws had only endorsed the custom
which previously existed of paying tithe. And as this custom
became general, so the law enforced its payment. But this penal
enforcement was not carried out in the laws of 787, because the
custom of paying tithe was not then general.

It is important to notice here that the Anglo-Saxon ceorls, or
churls, or freemen, occupying the social position between the
thane and slave, had no voice whatever in the passing of the
laws. The WitenagemÃ³ts, which sanctioned the payment of
tithe, and granted away the national property, called folcland,
to bishops, cathedral churches, and monasteries, were composed
of archbishops, bishops, aldermen, abbots, priests, deacons,
princes, dukes, earls, and thanes. In these assemblies, both
secular and ecclesiastical laws were enacted, and charters embodying
grants of public lands by kings were confirmed and
ratified.

In the 17th Injunction, quoted above, there are references to
Scripture in support of tithes. The two main positions taken up
by Selden in his history of tithes are (1) that the tithes of the
Christian Church are not the continuation of the tithes of the
Levitical law as put forth by the Church in support of payment,
and (2) that tithes had a legal as opposed to a Divine origin in
the Christian Church. These two positions are impregnable, and
can never be overthrown. The Levitical tithes were given to the
Levites, âfor the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.â
[78]

But charity was at the very root of all primitive references to
the payment of tithes in the Christian Church. Some writers
[47]

assent to Seldenâs second position as stated above, but will not
admit that they were given for different purposes to those given
to the Levites, and yet they were. In this respect they indicate
inconsistency. They would be consistent if they should assert,
which they do not, that the English parsons receive their tithes
by
Divine right, and in continuation of the Levitical law
; then all
the tithes would go to the parson as they went to the Levites.
But the history of the origin of tithes in the Christian Church is
quite opposed to all this. Those who uphold the Divine right
consider the tithes as private professional incomes, and not as
trust funds to be used for the benefit of the people. Most of the
sermons preached in the eighth century placed the summit of
Christian perfection in the payment of tithes. The people in
England reluctantly submitted to a general permanent tribute in
the shape of tithes.

The obligation of paying tithes was originally confined to
predial or the fruits of the earth. But about
A.D.
1200 the obligation
was extended to every species of profit, and to the wages
of every kind of labour. I have already stated the passage from
the Old Testament on which the Christian clergy base their
claim to personal tithes.

Offaâs supposed Law of Tithes in
A.D.
794.

Dr. Humphrey Prideaux, Dean of Norwich, published a work
on Tithes in 1709, 2nd ed. 1736. The title is, âThe Original
and Right of Tithes for the maintenance of the ministry in a
Christian Church.â

His main object was to prove the Divine in opposition to the
legal right of tithes. He quotes questionable authorities in
support of his views.

In reference to King Offa, he says, âAnd in imitation [of
[48]

Charlemagneâs Capitulars] Offa made a law about the year 794,
whereby he gave to the Church the tithes of all his kingdom,
which the historians tell us was done to expiate for the death of
Ethelbert, king of the East Angles, whom in the year preceding
he had caused basely to be murdered on his coming to his court
to marry his daughter.â
[79]
He quotes as his authority for this
story the chronicle of Bromton, abbot of Jervaulx, in Yorkshire,
who lived towards the end of the 14th century. Now, in referring
to this chronicle, I find that Prideaux made two wrong quotations,
viz. (1) that Offa made a law; (2) that he gave tithes of all
his kingdom of Mercia. Let John Bromton speak for himself.
âThis Offa, by the wicked advice of his wife, treacherously (prodicionaliter)
put to death St. Ethelbert, king of the East Angles,
who was on a visit to him for the purpose of marrying his
daughter; in atonement for which sin he brought down his pride
to such a degree of humility and penitence that he gave to
Holy
Church a tenth of all that belonged to him
.â
[80]

Roger of Wendover gives a very graphic account of the murder
of King Ethelbert by Offaâs wife in 792, in order to add his
kingdom to Mercia. After his death Offa annexed it to his
own.
[81]

Polydore Vergil followed Bromton, and Holinshed followed
Polydore. Selden quotes from Polydore thus: âOffaâs giving
the tithe of his estate
to the clergy and the poor
.â
[82]

Bromton says that he gave the tithe to Holy Church. Polydore
explains what Bromton meant by Holy Church; viz., âThe clergy
and the poor.â Polydore was an Italian priest sent to England
[49]

by the Pope to collect Peters pence. He was archdeacon of
Wells, and wrote a history of England, which he dedicated to
Henry VIII. In this history he explains what was meant by
âHoly Churchâ thus: âHe (Offa) gave the tenth part of all his
goods to priests and other poor men.â
[83]
Holinshed says, âHe
granted the tenth part of his goods unto churchmen and poor
people.â
[84]

The poor were always considered in grants of tithes or offerings,
because charity was, and is, the basis of the Christian
religion. And this fundamental principle of Christianity runs
through all donations to Holy Church in Anglo-Saxon and
Norman times.

Lord Selborne considers Bromtonâs statement as regards Offaâs
grant of tithes, as a âmythical story,â
[85]
because other chroniclers
do not mention it. Is Lord Selborne consistent in pushing on
this theory of ignoring any statement which is not confirmed by
some other independent writer? Let us take for example, the
Ordinances made at Habam about
A.D.
1012. They are found
only in Bromtonâs work. They are not confirmed by any other
writer, but are copied by writers from this source. Does Lord
Selborne state that they are âmythical,â because other chroniclers
do not mention them? No. He admits them as genuine.
[86]
So
does Mr. Thorpe.
[87]
If Lord Selborne were consistent, he would
have rejected them, because they are not confirmed by other independent
writers. No one knows from what source Bromton
had taken his text.

Lord Selborne admits the other two statements made by
[50]

Bromton; viz., (1) King Ethelbertâs murder. (2) The grant
of Peterâs Pence.

Now, it appears to me that this so-called âmythical storyâ was
not unreasonable, (1) because King Offa enacted the payment of
tithes in his own kingdom in 787; and (2) because it was a tenth
of his own property which was granted. It certainly was not
a general enactment for the payment of tithes throughout his
kingdom.

Kemble says on this point, âI think that in this case he
[Bromton] has probability on his side, if we restrict the grant to
Offaâs demesne lands, or to a release of a tenth of the dues payable
to the King on folcland.â
[88]
This is exactly my opinion
also.

Dean Prideaux is not correct when he states, âThis law of Offa
was that which first gave the Church a civil right in tithes in
this land, by way of property and inheritance, and enabled the
clergy to gather and recover them as their legal due by the coercion
of the civil power.â
[89]
This dignitary of the Church, so often
quoted, polluted the tithe question with so much fiction and ill-digested
conclusions that he has made the true history of tithes
very embarrassing. But there is one comfort that the light which
the latest researches have thrown upon the whole tithe question
has completely dissipated the numerous fictions which surround
it.

It is erroneously stated that when tithes originated in England
there were no poor, although our Lord says we should always have
the poor among us; and that the owner of the soil was bound to
support all that were born on his soil; that they worked and lived
for him, and therefore there was no necessity for making provision
[51]

for the poor out of the tithes. Now on this special point we
have overwhelming genuine documentary evidence that provision
was distinctly made for the poor in the first mention of tithes
being paid in England. âIt is not lawful,â says Archbishop
Theodore, âto pay tithes except to the
poor and strangers
.â This
is the first instance in which tithes are mentioned in English
writings. It is therefore wrong to say that there were no poor in
this country when the custom of paying tithes commenced in
England. Theodoreâs statement was written not later than
A.D.

686. The second reference to tithes is in Bedeâs âEccl. Hist.,â
where he states that Bishop Eadbert gave (
A.D.
686)
one-tenth of
his own goods to the poor
.
[90]
âNot tithes in particular,â says Lord
Selborne, âbut all church property of every kind was from early
times, and down even to the fourteenth century, described as
the
patrimony of the poor
. The poor were always, and almost must
be in an especial degree, objects of the Christian ministry.â
[91]

In Anglo-Saxon times the State did not provide for the poor.
It demanded that every man should be answerable for himself in
a mutual bond of association with his neighbour, or should place
himself under the protection of some lord. The man without
means or protection was treated as an outlaw. This was heathenism
and not Christianity. The grand humanitarian, philanthropic
principles of the Christian religion were taught the Saxon heathen
from the very first by the Christian missionaries. Unquestionably
these missionaries found poor, outcast Anglo-Saxons to whom
they preached the Gospel, and assisted them with their charity
and protection. This was the special function of the bishops and
their clergy in their dioceses, and monks in their monasteries.
When they appealed to the people for their voluntary offerings of
[52]

tithes, the strongest point in that appeal was for means to help the
poor and strangers, and so tithes went partly towards poor rates,
partly towards a church rate to repair the edifice, and partly towards
the clerical sustentation fund. These were originally the
three distinct functions of tithes in England. There is sufficient
evidence for a reasonable conviction on this much-disputed point
of the division of tithes.

[53]

CHAPTER VII.

KING ETHELWULFâS ALLEGED GRANT OF TITHES.

âBut this establishment,â says Prideaux, âreached no further
than the kingdom of Mercia, over which Offa reigned, till Ethelwulf,
about sixty years after, enlarged it for the whole realm of
England. And because hereon the civil right of tithes in this
land had its main foundation, and this matter hath been much
perplexed by those who have wrote of it, both
pro
and
con
, I
shall for the clearing of it from all objections and difficulties
raised about it, here give a thorough and full account of the
whole matter,â etc.
[92]
This erroneous view has been long
exploded.

It is amusing to read what Prideaux calls Seldenâs able and
learned history of tithes: âMr. Seldenâs wild chimera,â and again,
âhis wild conceitâ; but nothing could be wilder than his own

conceit
on the Divine origin of tithes in the Church of England.
Another DeanâComberâalso wrote strongly against Mr. Seldenâs
âTithes.â
[93]

Mr. Selden had taken Ethelwulfâs charter passed in a WitenagemÃ³t,

A.D.
844, as the first legal title-deed of granting tithes to
the clergy. In this view he was followed by Prideaux, Hume,
Collier, Rapin, Milman, Echard, and others.

[54]

Sir Henry Spelman had taken another view, and supposed the
grant to have been the origin of the glebe-lands of the Church;
but this opinion was wrong, because churches had been endowed
with glebe lands prior to these grants.

The great question at issue is, âDid Ethelwulfâs charters
grant a tithe of yearly increase?â They did not.

I have consulted the following chronicles on this matter:â

(
a
) The Saxon Chronicle under the year
A.D.
855 writes: âIn
this year Ethelwulf, inscribing in a book the tenth part of the
land and also of his whole kingdom, dedicated it to Godâs praise,
and thereby seeking also his own eternal salvation.â [âDecimam
terrÃ¦ suÃ¦ et regni quoque totius partem libro inscribens, in
laudem Dei, suÃ¦que etiam Ã¦ternal saluti consulens, dicavit.â]

(
b
) Simeon has under
A.D.
855: âAt this time King Ethelwulf
tithed all the empire of his kingdom for the redemption of his
own soul and the souls of his ancestors.â [âQuo tempore rex
Ethelwulfus decimavit totum regni sui imperium, pro redemptione
animÃ¦ suÃ¦ et antecessorum suorum.â]

(
c
) Huntingdon, under
A.D.
854, writes: âEthelwulf in the
nineteenth year of his reign tithed all his land to the uses of the
Churches for Godâs love and his own redemption.â [âEthelwulfus
decimo nono anno regni sui totam terram suam adopus ecclesiarum
decimavit, propter amorem Dei et redemptionem sui.â]

(
d
) Wendover,
A.D.
854: âIn this same year the magnificent
King Ethelwulf conferred upon God and the blessed Mary and
all the saints the tenth part of his kingdom free from all secular
services, exactions, and tributes.â [âEodem anno rex magnificus
Athelwulfus decimam regni sui partem Deo et BeatÃ¦ MariÃ¦ et
omnibus sanctis contulit, liberam ab omnibus servitiis sÃ¦cularibus
exactionibus et tributis.â]

(
e
) Malmesbury says: âEthelwulf granted to Christâs servants
[55]

the tenth part of all the ploughlands within his kingdom, free
from all duties, and discharged from all liability to disturbance.â
[âEthelwulfus decimam omnium hidarum infra regnum suum
Christi famulis concessit, liberam ab omnibus functionibus absolutam
ab omnibus inquietudinibus.â]

(
f
) Asser, surnamed Menavensis, from the place of his birth,
writes, under
A.D.
855: âIn the same year Ethelwulf released the
tenth part of his whole kingdom from all royal service and
tribute, and by a perpetual inscription offered it as a sacrifice on
the cross of Christ to the Trinity for the redemption of his own
soul and the souls of his ancestors.â [âEodem anno Ãthelwulfus
decimam totius regni sui partem ab omni regali servitio et tributo
liberavit, in sempiternoque graphio in cruce Christi pro redemptione
animÃ¦ suÃ¦ et antecessorum suorum, uni et trino Deo immolavit.â]

Asser was well acquainted with the traditions of the kingâs
house, having been tutor and biographer of Alfred, Ethelwulfâs
son.

(
g
) Ingulphus,
A.D.
855: âIt added to the prosperity of the old
age (of GuthlÃ¦, Abbot of Crowland) that Ethelwulf, the famous
king of the West Saxons, when he recently returned from Rome
(where, with his younger son Alfred, he had visited abroad the
thresholds of the Apostles Peter and Paul and the most holy
Pope Leo), with the free consent of all his prelates and princes
who ruled under him, the various provinces of all England, then
first endowed the whole English Church throughout his kingdom
with the tithes of the lands and other goods and chattels, by a
writing under his own hand in this form,â then follows the charter.
[âAccessit ad prosperitatem senii sui, quod inclytus rex west saxonum
Ethelwulphus cum de Roma, ubi limina Apostolorum Petri
et Pauli, ac sanctissimum Papam Leonem, multa devotione una
[56]

catallorum, universam dotaverat ecclesiam Anglicanam per suum
regium chirographum confectum inde in hunc modum.â]

services, exactions, and tributes; (
g
) refers to tithes.

The word
decimare
had been often used as regards gifts in
tenths quite apart from the idea of tithes. The whole difficulty
in reference to Ethelwulfâs grants, turns upon his use of the word
tenth as a convenient measure for ecclesiastical and other benefactions.
This fact testifies to another fact; namely, the growing
recognition of the tithe as the clerical portion.
[95]

In order to get a correct idea of the application of the charters,
it is essentially necessary to make oneself familiar with the proper
meanings of âFolclandâ and âBocland.â

Folcland and Bocland.

Folcland
was the general property of the communityâ
i.e.
,
Anglo-Saxon national propertyâ
terra fiscalis
, and its possessors
were bound to assist in repairing royal vills and in other public
works; and were also liable to have travellers quartered upon
them for subsistence. They were required to give hospitality to
kings and great men in their progresses through the country; to
furnish them with carriages and relays of horses, and to extend
the same assistance to their messengers, followers, and servants,
[57]

and even to persons who had charge of their hawks, horses, and
hounds. Such are the burdens from which lands were liberated
when converted by charter into bocland. For breach of these
conditions they were liable to forfeiture or witeraeden; that is,
fines. Freemen of all ranks and conditions, as well as common
people, held folcland. The possessor had only a life-interest in
it. On his demise the king could dispose of it to another. The
holder may also possess bocland. Every one was desirous of
having grants of folcland, and to convert as much as possible of
it into bocland.

Bocland
was land held by book or charter. It had been land
severed by an act of the government from the folcland, and, by
a written instrument was converted into an estate of perpetual
inheritance. The possessors of bocland were released from all
services to the public except the
trinoda necessitas
; that is, contributing
to military expeditions, repairs of castles and bridges.
The Church contrived in some cases to obtain exemption from
them, but in general its lands, like those of others, were subject
to them. The greater part of the charters granting exemptions
to the Church, are forgeries. The estates of the higher nobility
consisted chiefly of bocland. Bishops and abbots had bocland
of their own in addition to what they held in right of the Church.

The Anglo-Saxon kings had private estates of bocland, and these
estates did not merge in the crown, but were devisable by will, gift, or
sale, and transmissible by inheritance in the same manner as bocland
held by a subject.
Among the Anglo-Saxons royalty was elective.
It sometimes happened that on the demise of the king his nearest
blood did not succeed to the throne. The former kingâs private
estate did not then pass to his successor, but to his own children.
Hence the advantage of a private estate in addition to the
demesne or crown lands. The folcland could not be converted
[58]

into bocland without the consent of the king by and with the
advice of his WitenagemÃ³t, an expression of the national will in
its distribution. There is hardly a Saxon charter creating bocland,
which is not said to have been granted by the king with the consent
and leave of his nobles and great men. âCum consilio,
consensu et licentia procerum,â or similar expressions. If that
consent were withheld, the kingâs grant would be invalid. There
was a case of this sort. Baldred, king of Kent, had given to
Christ Church, Canterbury, the manor of Malling, in the county
of Sussex; but the king having offended his nobles, they refused
to ratify his grant, and therefore the grant had not taken effect
until King Egbert, in 838, with his counsel assembled at Kingston-upon-Thames,
restored the manor to the Church through the
action of Archbishop Ceolnoth.
[96]

If the king himself received a grant of folcland, he had first to
receive the consent of his Witan. Ethelwulf booked twenty hides
of folcland to himself in his private capacity, but he had the
consent of his Witan;
[97]
Offa did the same.

When folcland was appropriated to the kingâs subsistence, that is,
to the maintenance of his household, court, etc., it was said to be
held
in demesne
, or let out to farm; afterwards called Terra Regis,
or crownland. A great part of the âTerra Regisâ of Domesday
was folcland, or public property of the State, and the king was
only the usufructuary possessor. We have an important definition
of Terra Regis at page 75 of the âExon Domesday,â viz.,
âThe demesne land of the king
belonging to the kingdom
,â and
we find a similar definition in the âExchequer Domesday.â
[98]

[59]

In dealing with Ethelwulfâs charters, it is essentially necessary
to state Mr. Kembleâs six canons of tests by which the Saxon
charter may not only be distinguished from a will or the record
of a synodal decree, but whether it is spurious.

These canons are (1) The Invocation; (2) The Proem; (3)
The Grant; (4) The Sanction; (5) The Date; (6) The Teste.

(1) The Invocation is a short ejaculation which usually forms
the first member of the document. (2) The Proem is a general
observation on the virtue of charity to the Church, the nothingness
of earthly possessions, and the advantage of purchasing with
them heavenly treasures. (3) The Grant, which is the important
part of every charter. (4) The Sanction, by which is meant the
punishment attached to the violation of the premises. It is called
the âSi quisâ clause. (5) The Date. (6) The Teste or Subscriptions.
In almost all ecclesiastical documents the witnesses
subscribed with their own hands.
[99]

Ethelwulfâs Charters.

In Ethelwulfâs Charters we have all these points. I shall omit
1, 2, and 4, and give here 3, 5, and 6.

(3) Charter A.ââWherefore I Ethelwulf, king of the West-Saxons,
with the consent of my bishops and princes, have resolved
on a salutary council and uniform remedy and have determined
to make a gift of a certain hereditary portion of land to all ranks

already in possession
of it, whether monks or nuns serving God,
or laypeople, always the tenth hide, where it may be the least yet
the tenth part perpetually enfranchised so as to be free and protected
from all secular services, royal dues, tributes, greater and
lesser taxes, which we call âWiteredenâ and that it be free from
[60]

all things for the deliverance of our souls and sins, for serving
God only, without military expedition and bridge-building and
castle fortification, so that they may more diligently without ceasing
pour forth their prayers to God for us, for which we in some
degree lighten their secular services,â etc.

(5) âNow this Charter of donation was written in the year of
the incarnation of our Lord 844, in the seventh Indiction, on the
day of the nones of November, in the city of Winchester, in the
church of St. Peter, before the high altar.â

(6) It was signed by King Ethelwulf, by bishops Elmstan and
Aelstan, 6 dukes, 3 abbots, and 16 thanes.

(3) Charter A.ââQuamobrem ego Ethelwulfus, rex Occidentalium
Saxonum cum consilio episcoporum ac principum meorum,
consilium salubre atque uniforme remedium affirmavi, ut aliquam
porcionem terrarum hereditarium antea possidentibus gradibus
omnibus, sive famulis et famulabus Dei Deo servientibus, sive
laicis, semper decimam mansionem ubi minimum sit tum decimam
partem in libertatem perpetuam perdonare dijudicavi ut sit
tutus atque munitus ab omnibus secularibus servitutis, fiscis,
regalibus tributis majoribus et minoribus, sive taxationibus quod
nos dicimus Witereden; sitque liber omnium rerum pro remissione
animarum et peccatorum nostrorum Deo soli ad serviendum,
sine expeditione, et pontis instructione, et arcis municione, ut eo
diligencius pro nobis ad Deum preces sine cessacione fundant,
quo eorum servitutem secularem in aliqua parte levigamus pro
honore Sancti Michaelis Archangeli et Sancte Marie Regine
gloriose Dei genetricis.â

(5) âScripta est autem hÃ¦c donacionis cartula anno DominicÃ¦
Incarnacionis DCCCXLIIII., Indictione vii., die quoque nonas
Novembris. In civitate Wentana in ecclesia, Sancti Petri ante
altare capitale, et hoc fecerunt.â

[61]

This Charter is printed by Kemble in the âCodex Diplomaticus,â
vol. v. p. 93, No. 1048, from a Malmesbury cartulary of the
14th century, Lansd., 417, f. 6, which Haddan and Stubbs collated
with a Malmesbury cartulary in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.
Wood., donat. 5, of the thirteenth century, see âCouncils,â iii. p.
630, etc. The rubric in the Bodleian cartulary stands thus: âQuomodo
Ãthelwulfus Rex decimavit terram suam Deo et sanctÃ¦
EcclesiÃ¦; et quota parte hujus decimÃ¦ Meldunensem Ecclesiam
ditaverit,â etc. [âIn what way King Ethelwulf decimated his
land to God and Holy Church, and with what part of that tenth
he enriched the Church of Malmesbury, for the honour of St.
Michael the Archangel and St. Mary.â] I have taken the orthography
of the charter from Mr. Birchâs âCartularium Saxonicum,â
ii. No. 447, p. 26.

I have translated
decimam mansionem
as the tenth hide.

It appears from this Malmesbury cartulary that annexed to it
was a statement of particular lands already in possession (
antea
possidentibus
) of the monastery which by this charter were enfranchised.
But in the copies of this charter the schedule of
enfranchised land is omitted except in this particular case of
Malmesbury.

As regards the date of this charter, Helmstan, whose name
appears in it, was bishop of Winchester from 838 to 852.
Swithun succeeded him in 852. If, therefore, the charter be
dated 854 with Helmstanâs name in it, the date is spurious. I
have taken the episcopal dates from Bishop Stubbsâs âRegistrum
Sacrum Anglicanum,â ed. 1858.

Wilkins gives the general provisions of this grant with the date

A.D.
844, Indiction iv., but makes a serious blot by inserting
Swithunâs name instead of Helmstanâs.
[100]

[62]

Selden says, âIn Malmesbury the date of the first charter is
DCCCXLIV, Indict. iv., v. Nonas Novembris; plainly it is
false, neither could that Indiction be in the charter of the year
DCCCXLIV, which fell in the seventh Indiction.â
[101]

Ethelwulfâs Second Charter of Grants.

Recital of the grant of Ethelwulf, king of the West-Saxons, to
the Church of England, of a tenth of lands, etc. Grant by the
same to Huntsige, the thane of land at Worthy,
county of Hants
,
Easter, 22 April, 854.

Charter B.ââWherefore I, Ethelwulf, by the grace of God,
king of the West-Saxons, in the holy and most solemn feast of
Easter, for the health of my soul and prosperity of my kingdom
and of all the people by Almighty God committed to my care,
with my bishops, earls and all my nobles, have resolved on a
salutary counsel, that I have not only given the tenth part of the
lands through our kingdom to Holy Church, but also have
granted to our ministers placed in the same to enjoy them in
perpetual liberty; so that such grant shall remain firm and immutable,
freed from all royal services, and from all other secular
services whatsoever.â

Here follows a statement that it had pleased Ãlthstan, bishop
of Sherborne, and Swithun, bishop of Winchester, with all those
serving God, to agree that on every Saturday in each church five
psalms shall be sung, and every presbyter shall sing two massesâone
for King Ethelwulf and the other for the bishops and nobles,
etc.

Then follows the date. âThis charter was written in the year
[63]

of the incarnation of our Lord 854, in the second Indiction, on
Easter Day, in our Palace at Wilton.â

Charter B.ââQuapropter ego Ãthelwulf gratia Dei Occidentalium
Saxonum rex, in sancta ac celeberrima Paschale sollempnitate,
pro meÃ¦ remedio animÃ¦ et regni prosperitate et populi
ab omnipotente Deo michi conlati consilium salubre cum episcopis,
comitibus, et cunctis optimatibus meis perfeci ut decimam partem
terrarum per regnum nostrum non solum sanctis Ã¦cclesiis darem
verum etiam et ministris nostris in eodem constitutis in perpetuam
libertatem habere concessimus. Ita ut talis donatio fixa incommutabilisque
permaneat ab omni regali servitio et omnium sÃ¦cularium
absoluta servitute.â

âScripta est autem hÃ¦c cartula, Anno DominicÃ¦ incarnationis
DCCCLIIII.; Indictione ii. die vero Paschali in palatio nostro
quod dicitur Wiltun.â

Then follow the names of the king, two of the kingâs sons,
bishops Alhstan and Swithun, six dukes, two abbots, sixteen
thanes.

This is found in Kembleâs âCodex Diplomaticus,â No. 1054,
and he takes his text from the Codex Wintoniensis, MS. Brit.
Mus., Add. 15,350, fol. 89.

Mr. Kemble marks this charter as doubtful, but Haddan and
Stubbs remark: âThis doubt lies on a very large portion of the
charters contained in the Codex Wintoniensis. The above is,
however, the best specimen of the class of charters which it represents.â
[102]

Mr. Kemble thinks that Ethelwulfâs first grant in 844 does not
refer to tithing in the legal sense of the term. The passages
found in the ancient chronicles, as quoted above, refer, in his
opinion, to two several transactions; one which took place in
[64]

854 (844?) before the kingâs visit to Rome; the second in the
year 857, after his return to England. âEthelwulf,â Mr. Kemble
says, âbeing humbled and terrified by the distress of wars and
the ravages of barbarous and pagan invaders, devised as a useful
remedy thus: he determined to liberate from all those various
exactions and services, which went by the general name of
âWitereden,â the tenth part of the estates which, though hereditary
tenure had grown up in them, were still subject to the general
obligations of folcland, whether they were in the hands of laics or
clergy; that when the estate amounted to ten hides, one was to be
free; when it was a very small quantity, at all events a tenth was
to be enfranchised; and as the greater part of this land was either
in the hands of the clergy, or was very likely ultimately to come
there, he granted this act of enfranchisement that on these estates
the holders might be the better able to devote themselves to the
services of God, all other services being discharged except indeed
the inevitable three.â
[103]

Mr. Kemble further adds, âEthelwulf did three distinct things
at different times:â

â(1) He first released from all payments, except the inevitable
three, a tenth part of the folclands or unenfranchised lands,
whether in the tenancy of the Church or of his thanes. In
this tenth part of the lands, so burdened in his favour, he
annihilated the royal rights, regnum or imperium, and as the
lands receiving this privilege were secured by charter, the
chronicle can justly say that the king booked them to the honour
of God.
[104]

(2) âThe second thing he did was his giving a tenth part of
[65]

his own private estates of book-land to various thanes or clerical
establishments.
[105]

(3) âAnd, lastly, upon every ten hides of his own land, he
commanded that one poor man, whether native born or stranger,
that is, whether of Wessex or some other kingdom, should be
maintained in food or clothing.â
[106]
This is remarkable as the
beginning of secular provision for the poor, a proof that there
were poor in Anglo-Saxon times, which some deny, in order
to show there was no need of a provision for them out of the
tithes!

âMr. Kembleâs views,â say Haddan and Stubbs, âof the
several cartularies, and his interpretation of them, may be regarded
as provisionally satisfactory.â
[107]

Charter C.âHere is an abridgment of the charter given by
William of Malmesbury, with altered date
A.D.
855, November
5th, written at Winchester. I give only the grant, so that it
may be compared with Charters A and B.

âWherefore I, Ethelwulf, king of the West Saxons, with the
consent of my bishops and princes, resolved on a salutary counsel
and also a uniform remedy; viz., to give
a certain portion of my
land
to God, the blessed Mary and all the saints, possessing it by
a perpetual right; viz., the
tenth part of my land
, so as to be
safe, protected and free from all secular services, and also from
royal tributes, the greater and less, or from the taxes which we
call âWitereden,ââ
[108]
etc. Attention is drawn to the words in
italics.

[66]

Seldenâs Conclusion on Ethelwulfâs Charter.

âIf we well consider the words of the chiefest of these ancients,
that is, Ingulphus, we may conjecture that the purpose of the
charter was to make a general grant of tithes payable freely
and discharged from all kind of exactions used in that time.â
[109]

Selden is not correct in this conclusion; for if we take the collateral
evidence of the chronicles, we shall find that the kingâs
grant referred to land and not to tithe of increase.

Selden says, âIn Matthew of Westminster no other
decima
is
mentioned in it than
decima terrÃ¦ meÃ¦
. Out of the corrupted
language [of the charter] it is hard to collect what the exact
meaning of it was.â
[110]
Here Selden unquestionably expresses a
doubt as to the interpretation of the charter. And we are therefore
bound to give him credit as having been the first to doubt
Ingulphâs interpretation of the charter; namely, that âEthelwulf
first endowed the whole English Church throughout his kingdom
with the tithes of the lands.â Therefore I agree with Lord Selborne
that Haddan and Stubbs have not done justice to Selden
in not having taken this doubtful statement into consideration.
[111]

[67]

CHAPTER VIII.

TITHE LAWS MADE BY ANGLO-SAXON KINGS.

Prideaux says: âFor King Alfred, the son of Ethelwulf, about
thirty years afterwards (885), having published a body of laws for
the well government of the realm, in one of them strictly enjoins
the payment of these tithes to the Church.â
[112]
He quotes as
his authority for this statement, Spelmanâs âConcilia,â tome i.
p. 360, No. 38: âDecimas, primigenia, et adulta tua Deo dato.â
This is the Vulgate translation of the Saxon. Thorpe translates
the Saxon thus: âThy tithes and thy firstfruits of moving and
growing things, render thou to God.â
[113]

It is important to note that King Alfred placed a long
Scriptural preface to his secular laws. He began with the ten
commandments, translated and transposed them in a strange
manner. It is all in Anglo-Saxon, which Alfred had translated
from the Vulgate which they taught him at Rome when there in
his younger days. The passage quoted from Spelman is taken
from Exodus xxii. 29, and this is in Alfredâs Scriptural preface to
his laws. The Vulgate translation is, âDecimas tuas et primitias
tuas non tardabis reddere.â [âThou shalt not delay to give thy
tithes and firstfruits.â] The renderings of this passage in the
Septuagint, Vulgate, and English Bible, are
paraphrases
and
not
translations
of the Hebrew text. For example, âThou shalt
[68]

not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits and of thy liquors.â
[114]

Again, âThou shalt not delay to offer from thy abundance and
of thy liquors.â
[115]

This passage in his preface was not one of his laws on tithes,
as Prideaux states. âIn King Alfredâs laws,â says Lord Selborne,
âthere is nothing about tithes. He made a treaty of peace
with Guthrum; in that treaty there was nothing about tithes.â
[116]

I quote his lordship because recently the Rev. M. Fuller has
dedicated âOur Title Deedsâ to him. Should his lordship
take the trouble to read through that book, he would be
astonished at some of the statements made in it;
e.g.
, Mr.
Fuller says that King Ethelbert of Kent passed laws for the
payment of tithes, and that King Alfred passed a law for their
payment, quoting, of course, for the second case, Dean Prideaux,
who has misled so many on the subject of tithes. âIn a code
of laws,â says Mr. Fuller, âpublished during Alfredâs reign, he
in one of them strictly enjoins the payment of these tithes to
the Church.â
[117]
And adds, âIn this Digest of the laws of his
predecessors, Alfred made not a
new
law for tithes; he merely
copied from them whose laws have long since been lost.â
[118]

Now, the only reference to tithes in Alfredâs laws is the above
quotation, which he made in his preface from the Vulgate translation
of Exodus xxii. 29.

âNo legislative enactment,â says Mr. Kemble, âcan be shown
on the subject of tithes in the codes of Alfred, Ini, or the
Kentish kings.â
[119]

âIt is not easy to say,â says Johnson, âwith what view Alfred
put this Scriptural preface to his laws, if it were not to show his
[69]

great esteem for Godâs word. There is no hint given that he
expected his people should make the judicial precepts of Moses
the rule of their action,â
[120]
etc.

Again, Mr. Fuller says, âAlfred, with the consent of his Witan,
entered into a treaty with Guthrum, by which the former ceded
to the latter the provinces of East Anglia and Northumberland
upon six conditions, the sixth being, âIf any man withhold tithes,
let him pay lah-slit (a fine of twenty shillings) among the Danes,
and wite (a fine of thirty shillings) among the English.ââ
[121]
Those
Danes were heathen, and it seems strange that they were compelled
to pay tithes to the Christian Churches. But this treaty
was not concluded between Alfred and Guthrum I., but between
his son Edward and a Guthrum II. âOur Title Deedsâ must
have been very loosely prepared. The rubric to this law states,
âThis is the ordinance which King Alfred and King Guthrum,
and afterwards King Edward and King Guthrum, chose and
ordained.â
[122]
âThe rubrics to these laws,â says Mr. Thorpe,
âare very defective in the manuscripts.â
[123]
âThe party,â adds
Mr. Thorpe, âto this treaty with Edward was apparently a second
Guthrum, who, according to Wallingford, was living in Edwardâs
time, and probably succeeded Eohric, the immediate successor
of Guthrum I.â
[124]
Edward the Elder succeeded his father in 901,
and died in 924. The treaty was made in 907. Guthrum I. received
East Anglia and Northumberland in 880, and died in 891.

Selden says, âIt may be seen by this that some other law
preceded for the payment of tithes, or else that the right of them
was otherwise supposed clear.â
[125]
There may have been some
previous secular law which is now lost. As I have stated before,
[70]

we have lost most valuable Anglo-Saxon charters and laws during
the incursions of the Danes and the disturbed state of the whole
country. There is a dead silence as regards tithes for 120
years between the Council of Chelsea,
A.D.
787, and the treaty
between Edward and Guthrum,
A.D.
909. âWhat we now
possess,â says Thorpe, âof Anglo-Saxon laws is but a portion
of what once existed.â
[126]

Athelstanâs Law on Tithes.

Athelstan succeeded his father in
A.D.
924, and in 927 published
the following Ordinance:â

âI, Athelstan the king, with the counsel of Wulfhelm, archbishop,
and of my other bishops, make known to the reeves at
each burgh, and beseech you in Godâs name, and by all His
saints, and also by my friendship, that ye first of my own goods
render the tithes both of live stock and of the yearâs earthly
fruits, so as they may most rightly be either meted or told or
weighed out; and let the bishops then do the like from their own
goods, and my ealdormen and my reeves the same. And I will
that the bishops and the reeves command it to all those who
ought to obey them, that it be done at the right term. Let us
bear in mind how Jacob the patriarch spake, âDecimas et
hostias pacificas offeram tibiâ; and how Moses spake in Godâs
law, âDecimas et primitias non turdabis offerre Domino.â It is
for us to think how awfully it is declared in the books: if we
will not render the tithes to God, that He will take from us the
nine parts when we least expect; and moreover we have the sin
in addition thereto.â
[127]

[71]

This is unquestionably the first general law in England for the
payment of predial and mixed tithes. I admit, and have stated,
that tithes were paid by Edwardâs treaty with Guthrum, and that
clause in the treaty implied that they were paid previously, but
there was no public law recorded like Athelstanâs, which set forth
the payment of predial and mixed tithes.

Now, Lord Selborne states that Athelstanâs ordinance is not
in form a public legislative Act, but merely a royal message
addressed to his reeves, bishops, and ealdormen.
[128]
Against this
opinion, I place the opinions of Selden, Kemble, Bishop Stubbs,
and Dean Prideaux.

(1) Selden says: âKing Athelstan, about the year 930, by the
advice and consent of the bishops of the land made a general law
for predial and mixed tithes.â
[129]

(2) Kemble says: âIt is well known that the earliest legislative
enactment on the subject of tithes in the Anglo-Saxon laws
is that of Athelstan, bearing date in the first quarter of the tenth
century.â
[130]

Kemble further adds: âThe tithes mentioned by Athelstan is
the predial tithe, or that of the increase of the fruits of the earth,
and increase of the young of cattle. The nature of the sanction
of tithes is obvious; it is the old, unjustifiable application of the
Jewish practice, which fraud or ignorance had made general current
in Europe.â
[131]

(3) Bishop Stubbs says: âThe formula by which the co-operation
of the WitenagemÃ³t was expressed is definite and distinct.
Alfred issues his code with the counsel and consent of his
[72]

Witan; Athelstan writes to the reeves with the counsel of the
bishops.â
[132]

Here Bishop Stubbs
includes
Athelstanâs law among the examples
he gives as regards the definite and distinct formula used
to indicate the co-operation of the WitenagemÃ³t. And the
Bishopâs opinion is the most important because Lord Selborneâs
objection is founded on a technical point, viz., the
formula
used.
But the Bishop admits that the formula used in this case was an
indication of the co-operation of the WitenagemÃ³t.

(4) Dean Prideaux says, âThis law was passed in a Parliament
of all England, assembled at Grately, about the year 928,
etc.â
[133]

Dr. Lingard calls the law a âCircular letter which the king
sent to his officers. From the tenour of this circular it seems
probable that numerous pleas of exemption had been set up
in favour of the lands belonging to the Crown, the bishops and
the ealdormen, and also of lands held under them by others.â
[134]

Lord Selborne then agrees with Dr. Lingard; the former calls
it âa royal message to his reeves,â the latter, âa circular
letter from the king to his officers.â If so, why should the Parliamentary

formula
have been used?

(5) Mr. Thorpe may also be added to the four. He clearly
lays down the rule by which he was guided in classifying and
separating the Laws from the
Monumenta Ecclesiastica
. âAll
ordinances,â he says, âproceeding from the king and WitenagemÃ³t,
whether of a secular or ecclesiastical character,
are
considered as Laws
. Those without such sanction, and of a
[73]

nature strictly ecclesiastical, are placed among the
Monumenta
Ecclesiastica
.â
[135]
He placed it among the Laws.

The question here is, What constitutes a WitenagemÃ³t? The
word means a meeting of the Witan or wise men. It was a counsel
of wise men. Our information is indeed very vague as to its
constitution. There is no law extant prescribing or defining the
constitution of the WitenagemÃ³t. A synod with the king present
would constitute a WitenagemÃ³t. There is no trace whatever
that it was representative or elective, or that there was a property
qualification. It is on record that the king named the members
who were to attend.
[136]
But the members were the leading men of
the country, viz., the archbishops, bishops, abbots, presbyters and
even deacons (the priests and deacons doubtless attended on the
bishops), princes, ealdormen and thanes.

The formula used in this law is, âThe king, with the council of
his archbishops and other bishops.â This was a council of wise
men presided over by the king. And whether it was called a
synod or a council, the laws passed by such a meeting formed the
general laws of the kingdom. The objections raised by some
writers to the formula used in making Anglo-Saxon laws, and to
the words Ordinance, Council and Synod, are groundless and
have no force. Mr. Fuller in âOur Title-Deedsâ is conspicuous
for this sort of objections. He says, âIt was
not
an act of the
Witan, but was an Ordinance made at a council or synod only, at
the council of Greatanlea,â etc.
[137]

Let us examine the formula used in other laws generally admitted
to be laws.

(1) âThe Laws of King Edward.â âEdwardâs Ordinances,â
[74]

âKing Edward commands all his reeves,â etc.
[138]
There is not a
word here about the Witan, archbishop, bishop, etc., yet they are
admitted as laws.

Athelstanâs secular ordinances passed at the council of Greatanlea,
[139]

had been enacted by the same Witan which enacted the
Kingâs Ordinance to his reeves as regards tithes. If one is a
âRoyal messageâ or âCircular letter,â so are the secular Ordinances.
But the latter are admitted to be laws, so therefore are
the former.

To carp about the words âcouncilâ and âsynod,â shows ignorance
of the Latin translation of WitenagemÃ³t, viz.,
concilium
,
conventus
,

synodus
, etc.

âAlthough synods,â says Kemble, âmight more properly be
confined to ecclesiastical conventions,
the Saxons do not appear
to have made any distinction
, probably because ecclesiastical and
secular regulations were made by the same body, and at the same
time.

âBut it is very probable that the Frankish system of separate
houses for the clergy and laity prevailed here also, and that
merely ecclesiastical affairs were decided by the king and clergy
alone. There are some Acts in which the signatures are those of
clergymen only; others in which the clerical signatures are
followed by those of the laity; and in one remarkable case of this
kind, the king signs at the head of each list, as if he had in fact
affixed his mark successively in the two houses as president of
each. This is in Codex Diplomaticus, No. 116.â
[140]

[75]

The Letter of the Kentish Men to King Athelstan.

Dr. Lingard makes the following remark on the thankful
acknowledgment which the Kentish men sent the King on the
promulgation of his Ordinance dated
A.D.
627.

âThe meaning is evident; in consequence of the Kingâs
admonition, they promised to pay tithes.â
[141]

Mr. Freeman makes some very important observations on the
above letter.

âAs the other kingdoms merged in Wessex, the Witan of the
other kingdoms became entitled to seats in the GemÃ³t of Wessex,
now become the common GemÃ³t of the Empire. But GemÃ³t of the
other kingdoms seem to have gone on as local bodies, dealing with
local affairs, and perhaps giving a formal assent to the resolutions
of the central body. The letter of the Kentish men to Athelstan
reads like an act of acceptance on the part of a local GemÃ³t, of
resolutions passed by the general body.â
[142]

Mr. Freeman then opposes Dr. Lingardâs theory and also Lord
Selborneâs, âfor the resolutions of the general bodyâ were those
of âthe common GemÃ³t of the Empire.â He therefore sides
with Selden, Kemble, Stubbs, etc., that the Ordinance passed at
Greatanlea was a general law.

But I shall quote the most conclusive evidence to show that
the Ordinances passed at Greatanlea were legal enactments, viz.,
âThat they would all hold the frith (peace) as King Athelstan
and his Witan had counselled at Greatanlea.â
[143]

[76]

Definition of Tithe.

Tithe was the tenth part of the increase yearly arising and renewing
from the profits of lands, the stock upon lands and the
personal industry of the inhabitants.
[144]

Tithes were (1) Predial, (2) Mixed, and (3) Personal.

(1) Predial tithes were the crops and wood which grew and
issued from the ground. (2) Mixed tithes were wool, sheep,
cattle, pigs and milk. They were called
mixed
because they
were predial in respect of the ground on which the animals were
fed, and personal from the care they required. (3) Personal
tithes were the tenth part of the clear gain after charges were
deducted; in other words, on net profits of artificers, merchants,
carpenters, smiths, masons, and all other workmen. Even the
servant-girls paid a tenth of their wages. The Scriptural passage
quoted in support of personal tithes is Deuteronomy xii. 6. âAnd
thither ye shall bring your tithes and heave offerings of your
hand.â

By 2nd and 3rd Edward VI., c. xiii. s. 7, âEvery person exercising
merchandizes, bargaining and selling clothing, handicraft, or
other art or faculty, by such kind of persons and in such places
as heretofore within these forty years have accustomably used to
pay such personal tithes, or of right ought to pay, other than
such as be common day labourers, shall yearly, before the feast
of Easter, pay for his personal tithe the tenth part of his clear
gains, his charges and his expenses, according to his estate, condition
or degree, to be therein abated, allowed and deducted.â
Sec. 9. âAnd if any person refuse to pay his personal tithes in
form aforesaid, that then it shall be lawful to the ordinary of the
[77]

diocese, where the party that ought to pay the said tithes is dwelling,
to call the same party before him, and by his discretion to
examine him by all lawful and reasonable means otherwise than by
the partyâs own corporal oath, concerning the true payment of the
said personal tithes.â Sec. 12. âExcept the inhabitants of the
city of London, Canterbury, and the suburbs of the same, and
also those of any other town or place that used to pay their tithes
by their houses, otherwise than they ought or should have done
before the making of this Act.â

The Laws of King Edmund.

He succeeded his brother Athelstan
A.D.
940.

The Laws Ecclesiastical. âKing Edmund assembled a great
synod at London, during the Holy Easter-tide (about
A.D.
994),
as well of ecclesiastical as of secular degree,â etc.

âOf Tithes and Church-Scots.â

Act 2. âA tithe we enjoin to every Christian man by his
Christendom, and Church-scot and Rome-feoh, and plough-alms.
And if any one will not so do, let him be excommunicated.â

Act 5. âWe have also ordained that every bishop repair the
houses of God in his own [district], and also remind the king
that all Godâs churches be well conditioned as is very needful
for us.â
[145]

Church-Scot =
Cyriesceat
= Firstfruits,
primitiÃ¦ seminum
. The
Jews had been commanded to give firstfruits
[146]
as well as tithes.
Here again the Levitical legislation was taken to be applicable
to the Christian ministry, and hence we find firstfruits as well as
tithes given to them.

This impost remained a fixed charge upon the land till the
[78]

time of the Conquest, when it ceased to be generally paid.
[147]
The
first instance of this payment in Anglo-Saxon law is found in
the laws of King Ina [
A.D.
690]: âLet church-scots be rendered
at Martinmas. If any one do not perform that, let him forfeit
60 shillings and render the Church-scot twelve-fold.â
[148]
This Act
was passed more than 200 years before the legal enactment of
tithes. It is strange that we should find firstfruits but not tithes
enacted by King Ina. The omission proves that tithes were not
then paid in Wessex. In Athelstanâs law passed at Greatanlea,
it is stated, âI will also that my reeves so do that there be given
the church-scots.â
[149]
Between the laws of Ina and that of Athelstan,
there is no mention of church-scots in Anglo-Saxon laws.

There must have been a large number of landownersâ churches
erected in the country at the time the above law was passed,
for the priests received only one-third of the tithes, the remaining
two-thirds was paid to the baptismal churches of the diocese
and placed at the bishopâs disposal; one-third of the two-thirds
was for the repairs of churches. The bishop who had the control
of these funds must have neglected their repairs, and this law
commanded the bishops not only to repair the churches but
also âto remind the king that all Godâs churches be well
conditioned.â

If there had been no customary appropriation of tithes, as
some assert, why should this law place the expenses of repairing
the churches upon the bishops?

We are gravely told by Mr. Fuller that this law passed in
A.D.

940 is no law, although presided over by the king, because the
meeting was called a â
Synod
â and not a â
Witan
â!
[150]

[79]

Prideaux calls it a law.
[151]
Selden says: âAbout 940, Edmund,
king of England, in a great synod or council, a kind of Parliament
both of lay and spiritual men held in London, made this Act.â
[152]

Kemble, Freeman, Bishop Stubbs, and every writer of distinction
admit this to be a proper legislative enactment.

King Edgarâs Laws.

Edgar succeeded his brother Edwig, or Edwy, in 959; died
975.

In the following law, Mr. Thorpe takes his text from a collection
of two important manuscripts; (1) Corpus Christi MS. 265 (K. 2);
(2) Cott. Nero, A. 1, both apparently written in the middle of
the 11th century.

âThis is the Ordinance
[153]
that King Edgar, with the counsel of
his Witan, ordained, in praise of God and in honour to himself
and for the behoof of all his people.â

Act 1. âThese then are first, that Godâs churches be entitled
to every right; and that every tithe be rendered to the old
minster to which the district belongs, and that be then so paid,
both from a thaneâs inland
[154]
and from geneat-land
[155]
so as the
plough traverses it.â

Act 2. âBut if there be any thane who on his bocland has
a church at which there is a burial place, let him give the third
part of his own tithe to his church. If any one have a church
at which there is not a burial-place, then of the nine parts, let
him give to his priest what he will; and let every church-scot go
[80]

to the old minster according to every free hearth; and let
plough-alms be paid when it shall be fifteen days over Easter.â

Act 3. âAnd let a tithe of every young be paid by Pentecost;
and of the fruits of the earth by the equinox; and every church-scot
by Martinmas on peril of the full wite which the doom-book
specifies; and if any one will not then pay the tithe, as
we have ordained, let the Kingâs reeve go thereto, and the
bishopâs, and the mass-priest of the minster, and take by force
a tenth part for the minster to which it is due; and assign to
him the ninth part; and let the eight parts be divided into two;
and let the landlord take possession of half, half the bishop;
be it a kingâs man, be it a thaneâs.â
[156]

In these laws there is a threefold division of churches. (1) The
âold minster,â that is the senior church, which name was anciently
given to the monastic or cathedral church. (2) A church with a
burial place. (3) A church without a burial place. âThe old
minster,â says Selden, âwas the ancientest church or monastery
where he hears Godâs service, which I understand not otherwise
than of any church or monastery, that is his parish church or
monastery. They were in many places the only oratories and
auditories that the near inhabitants did their devotions in.â
[157]

This is the first English law which expressly appropriates
tithes. They were previously appropriated according to custom.
In the first mention of tithes which is found in Theodoreâs
âPenitential,â it is a customary and not a legal appropriation.

[81]

CHAPTER IX.

ORIGIN OF OUR MODERN PARISH CHURCHES AND BOUNDARIES.

The church with burial-place, as stated in Art. 2 of King Edgarâs
laws, clearly indicates the transition which had been going on from
the old minster to the landownerâs church, from which originated
our modern parish churches.

There is the old minster or parish church, then the landownerâs
church, with burial-place, erected on his private estate for the
convenience of his family, tenants, and labourers. This becomes
a new parish church within the district of the old minster.
Edgarâs laws are the first to mention these churches. But since

A.D.
675 chapels of ease had been built, but no district, no parish
boundary, was assigned to any of them. The slow and gradual
manner in which parochial churches became independent, appears
of itself an efficient answer to those who ascribe a great antiquity
to the universal payment of tithes.
[158]

It is impossible to state precisely when parishes in England
were formed. There is no record or evidence to show it. They
gradually commenced in the latter quarter of the seventh century
and increased very much in the eighth century. It is too late to
assign the origin of our modern parish churches to the reign of
King Edgar. It would be nearer the truth to say that the modern
parish churches gradually grew up from Bedeâs account in
A.D.
[82]

686, but were not then called parishes. It is evident that the
two churches recorded by Bede were built for the accommodation
of those residing on each of the earlsâ estates. So when
churches increased, the jurisdiction of the incumbent of each
manorial church was limited by the extent of the landownerâs
estate. Hence the estate on which the church was built, with
burial ground, became the parochial boundary. Some estates were
larger than others; hence the parochial areas are very unequal.

The church had a boundary conterminous with the landownerâs
estate. And by Edgarâs law the incumbent received one-third
of the tithes of the estate on which the church was built, free
from all incidental expenses. The old minster received the
remaining two-thirds for the purpose of repairing the churches
and relieving the poor and strangers.
[159]
Edgarâs law points out a
division of the tithes. But the most important question in
reference to Edgarâs appropriation is âWhy was one-third
specially assigned to the priest of the manorial church?â Because
that part was the well-recognised priestâs share of the tithes.

In Domesday we find several churches in possession of only
this one-third of the tithes from the manor or township. Let us
take the properties of St. Paulâs, London. The Vicar of
Cadendon, in Herts, received a third part of the tithe of the
demesne; the Vicar of Tillingham, in Essex, assessed at 20
hides in Domesday, had a third part of the great and small tithes
of the demesne. The Vicar of Nastock, in Essex, had a third
sheaf of the tithe of the demesne; the Vicar of Drayton, in
Middlesex, had one-third of the tithe of the demesne; the Vicar
of Sutton, which is not in Domesday, had one-third of the tithe.
On the other hand, we find vicars on the Chapter estates receiving

all
the tithes. But the fact existed of Edgarâs one-third appearing
[83]

in the Domesday Survey, which did not record one-third
of the churches which were then on the lands surveyed; and if
we had in that survey a complete record of the number of
churches, we should find a large number of vicars in receipt of
Edgarâs one-third part of the tithes.

We sometimes find the tithes of a portion of land in one
parish, paid to the parish priest of the church of another parish,
for this detached piece of land may have belonged to the
manorial owner, who built the church on his estate and endowed
it not only with the tithes of the lands of the manor but also
with the tithes of the land which he possessed in other parishes.

The modern parish system has been erroneously traced back
by some
[160]
to Archbishop Honorius in
A.D.
630. Mr. Selden
refutes this opinion.
[161]

âHonorius primus provinciam in parochias divisit,â meant that
Honorius was the first to divide his province into bishoprics and
not into parishes. The error originated out of a confusion of
the original and subsequent meanings of the word âparochia.â
Originally, âparochiaâ meant a diocese and also a parish. But
in Edgarâs reign the words âdioceseâ and âparishâ had two
distinct and separate meanings. The distinction had not originated
in his reign, but previously and gradually. The
germ
of
the modern parish appeared in
A.D.
686.
[162]

It is important to observe that in speaking of a clergymanâs
sphere of duty the word âprovinciaâ and not âparochiaâ was
used;
e.g.
, âQuicunque enim presbiter in
propria provincia
aut
in aliena,â etc.
[163]

[84]

Selden makes some weighty remarks on Edgarâs law. âBut as
the first part,â he says, âof his law that gives all tithes to the
mother Church of every parish, meant in them a parochial right
to incumbent; so also the second part, that permits a third portion
of the founderâs tithes to be settled in a church new built, whereto
the right of sepulture is annexed, makes a dispensation for a
parishioner that would build such a church in his bocland....

I doubt not that such new erections within old parishes bred also
new divisions, which afterwards became whole parishes
, and by
connivance of the time took (for so much as was in the territory
of that bocland) the former parochial right that the elder and
mother Church was possessed of. For that right of sepulture
was, and regularly is, a character of a parish church, and as commonly
distinguished from a capella.â
[164]

Edgarâs law was of great importance. If it were carried out at
the present day, the several daughter Churches which have burial
grounds would receive a share of the parochial tithes. These
district or daughter Churches relieve the mother or parish Church
of a large part of the spiritual duties without receiving any part of
the spiritual endowments. At no time was this neglected condition
so keenly felt as before the creation of the Ecclesiastical
Commission. Some private patrons were, and are still reluctant
to divide a portion of the parochial tithes among the incumbents
of the daughter Churches. But public patrons do so. At the
present time, when some well-endowed parishes become vacant,
public patrons and some private patrons also, redistribute the tithe
endowments among the poorer incumbents of the same parish.
But these commendable changes have been brought about by
Acts of Parliament and Orders in Council.

[85]

In reference to the one-third to the priest of the manorial
church, Bishop Kennett says: âAnother fair pretext of the religious
to regain appropriations, was to desire no more than two
parts of the tithe and profits, leaving a third to the free and quiet
enjoyment of the parish priest, whom at the same time
they eased
from the burthen of repairing the church and relieving the poor, and
took that charge upon themselves
. This again was a colour that
looked well, for it was but a
returning to the old institution of
dividing the profits of a parish into three parts
: one to the priest,
one to the church, and a third to the poor. The one-third was
called the churchâs part, and was expressly excepted as belonging
to the priest, and was frequently described as a portion separate
from the share of the monks and pertaining to the parish church.
It was on this account that the patronâs charter of consenting to
an appropriation, did sometimes expressly reserve a third part to
the bishop, and for the same reason the bishops of Man had their

Tertiana
, or third part of all churches, in that island. The bishops
provided perpetual vicars, who enjoyed a full third of the tithes,
and in addition he had oblations and perquisites, which all made
his portion often equal to, if not exceeding that of the convent.â
[165]

These are the words of a bishop of the Church of England. He
fully admits the existence of âthe old institution of dividing the
profits of a parish into three parts,â etc. This old division was
not questioned until fifty-eight years ago by Archdeacon Hale,
of London, and recently revived by Lord Selborne. I shall
presently deal with the opinions of these two writers.

Bishop Kennett further adds, that although there was a threefold
division of tithes and oblations in England, yet the whole
product of tithes and offerings was the
bank of each parish church
,
[86]

and the minister was the
sole trustee
and
dispenser
of them according
to the stated rules of piety and charity. This is a most remarkable
and vital observation, because in course of time this
sole trustee kept all the tithes and oblations to his own personal
use, in the same manner as the monks acted in respect to all the
profits of the churches appropriated to them after the Norman
Conquest.

It may be observed that at one time lay patrons had kept to
themselves the two parts for the poor and repairs of the churches,
and gave the priest the remaining one-third. This arrangement
led to great disorders, because they kept the two parts to their
own use and had them infeoffed in them and their heirs, leaving
the altarage or small tithes to the parish priest. By conscientious
scruples, however, they restored in course of time the two
parts to the parochial priests, or religious houses, for distribution
to the poor and for repairing the churches.

Canons Enacted under King Edgar.
[166]

Canon 55. âAnd we enjoin that the priest so distribute the
peopleâs alms, that they do both give pleasure to God and accustom
the people to alms.â

The following is a gloss on this canon:ââAnd it is right that
one part be delivered to the priest, a second part for the need of
the church, and a third part for the poor.â

The text is taken from MS. 201 in Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge. The gloss is taken, by Mr. Thorpe, from a Bodleian
MS., Junius 121, fol. 25
b
, which he calls âXâ in a page between
his Preface and Table of Contents. He says the Bodleian MS.
is of the tenth century. Mr. Thorpeâs commanding position as an
[87]

Anglo-Saxon scholar is generally admitted; yet Lord Selborne
questions his opinion as to the date of the Bodleian MS.
He says it must have been written in the eleventh century, and
was copied from the Church Grith; thus dating the MS. a
century later than Mr. Thorpe.
[167]
That could not have been,
for the Church Grith law deals only with the tithe, but Edgarâs
canon deals with all alms, including tithe. And as to the date of
the MS., I should prefer the opinion of a disinterested Anglo-Saxon
scholar and expert like Mr. Thorpe.

It is probable that the Cambridge MS. is a late copy made in
Cnuteâs reign, and that the Bodleian MS. was a gloss made in
the tenth century on the original copy of the canons. The force
of the gloss is that the priest was entitled only to one-third part of
the peopleâs alms, which included the tithe. The Church Grith
law deals only with the tithe, of which a third part was the priestâs.
The gloss gives the general custom of all the churches of giving
the priest only one-third part of all alms, oblations, tithes, etc.,
and not
ALL
the alms and oblations in addition to one-third part
of the tithes. In principle, the words of the gloss do not differ
from the wording of Ethelredâs law.

Canon 56. âAnd we enjoin that priests sing psalms when
they distribute the alms, and that they earnestly desire the poor to
pray for the people.â Why pray for the people? Because they
gave alms to them.

Odo, Archbishop of Canterbury.

He was of Danish birth. His father was one of the Danish
chiefs who were engaged in the invasions of England in
A.D.
870.
Odo was first a soldier in the wars of Edward the Elder. In 926
he was appointed bishop of Ramsbury. He was three times engaged
[88]

on the battle-field after he became a bishop. In 942 he
was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury.

Odoâs canons were compiled from Egbertâs Excerptions and
Legatine Injunctions; the former I have shown not to be Egbertâs
production. Odoâs tenth canon on tithes is the seventeenth Injunction
passed at the Council at Calchyth,
i.e.
, Chelsea, in 787.

The Monks.

It gives great pleasure to a certain class of writers to blacken
the characters of the monks, and to extol Henry VIII. and the
favourites and courtiers who surrounded him. But the present
age is too critical and well-informed to be misled by the prejudiced
and bigoted statements which have no foundation in fact. The
monks were no doubt superstitious, and so were the parochial
clergy; but the former were not ignorant men, as Judge Blackstone
states in his Commentaries. He was much indebted to them
for the preservation of ancient charters, laws, and historical annals,
which form so important a part of his Commentaries. The various
charters of English liberty, wrung from English sovereigns from
time to time, were deposited in the monasteries by the barons for
safe keeping, where they were carefully and faithfully preserved by
the so-called âignorant and superstitious monks.â

In every great abbey there was a large room called the âScriptorium,â
where several writers made it their sole business to
transcribe books for the use of the library. They were generally
engaged upon the Fathers, Classics, Histories, etc., etc. There
was then no printing press. So zealous were the monks in general
for this work, that they often had lands given to them and churches
appropriated to them for carrying on the work. In all the great
abbeys persons were appointed to take notice of the principal
occurrences of the kingdom, and at the end of every year to digest
[89]

them into annals. The constitutions of the clergy in their national
and provincial synods, and even Acts of Parliament, were sent to
the abbeys, in order to be duly recorded. The choicest records
and treasures of the kingdom were preserved in the monasteries.
A copy of the charter of liberties granted by Henry I. was sent to
some abbey in every county to be preserved. The abbeys were
schools of learning and education, for every convent had one person
or more appointed for this purpose, and all the neighbours
that desired it, might have their children taught certain branches
of education free of charge. In the nunneries, also, young women
were taught to work, and to read English and Latin also. Most
of the daughters of noblemen and gentlemen were educated in
those places.

Again, the monasteries were great hospitals, and most of them
were obliged to relieve poor people every day. They served the
same purposes of relieving the poor and strangers as the workhouses
which originated in the reign of Queen Elizabeth did.
When the monasteries were dissolved, and all their properties
handed over as a free gift by Parliament to Henry VIII., to do
with them as he pleased, there were no longer any places where
the poor and strangers could be relieved. If all the monastic properties
had then been placed under a Board of Commissioners to
be utilized towards the relief of the poor, an annual income would
now be at the command of such Commissioners as would be sufficient
to cover the eight and a half millions per annum, the present
cost of the relief of the poor of England and Wales, and thus the
ratepayers of the kingdom would be relieved of the payment of
poor rates. The annual value of all the property was Â£250,000,
including the tithes possessed by the monastic bodies. If we
take into account the valuable landed estates which the bishops
and chapters were forced to exchange for the monastic appropriated
[90]

tithes, firstfruits, and tenths, we shall get a revenue of at
least Â£300,000 per annum, which, at the present time, would realize
eight and a half millions per annum. To place such vast properties
at the
free disposal
of Henry VIII. and his successors on
the throne, is the most convincing proof of the subservient and
even slavish Parliaments of the Tudor sovereigns.
[168]

It is important to observe that we have no trustworthy record
of any single event of English history previous to the arrival of
Augustine. We have tradition, but nothing more. No great
power of writing existed up to that period. But Augustine and
his companions did more than introduce Christianity among the
Saxons. They also introduced writing, annals, and other forms
of Roman civilization. The first Anglo-Saxon charter is dated
April 28,
A.D.
604, by which Ethelbert, king of Kent, granted to
the Cathedral church of Rochester, lands at Southgate. This
charter was granted by the advice of Bishop Laurence and of all
the kingâs princes.
[169]
There are no signatures, but ends with
âAmen.â The second charter, dated
A.D.
605, granting land in
Canterbury to found an abbey, is signed by King Ethelbert,
Archbishop Augustine, Edbald the Kingâs son, Duke Hamigisil,
Angemund referendarius, Hocca comes, Grafio comes (count or
comites of the King), Tangilisil regis optimas, Pinca, and Geddi.
The first charter is remarkable, in which Laurence is styled
âbishop.â Augustine had not died until the 26th May, 605,
[170]
so
he must have consecrated Laurence as Archbishop more than
thirteen months before his death. Augustine signed the Charter
dated 9th January, 605, as a member of the WitenagemÃ³t.

[91]

Population.

Mr. Walter de Gray Birch, of the MSS. Department of the
British Museum, had discovered in 1883, in the British Museum,
a MS. in Anglo-Saxon of the late tenth or early eleventh century.
It is the only extant Anglo-Saxon copy. It is the oldest and best
text. There is internal evidence that the MS. is a copy of an
older one now lost. It is in the Harley Collection of MSS. 3271
f. 6B. It is the earliest census return of the Anglo-Saxon population.
[171]

There are thirty-four divisions or territorial names which
are very ancient. The total is 243,600 hides, which mean
families, throughout England. Allowing five to each family, the
population of England in
A.D.
1066 was 1,218,000. As the sanitary
arrangements and medical science were little known among the
Anglo-Saxons, I take 10 per 1,000 as the excess of births over
deaths. From these data I conclude that in
A.D.
597, when
Augustine landed in England, the population was 80,000; in
A.D.

700, the population was 160,000; in
A.D.
800, population 300,000;
in
A.D.
900, population 600,000; in
A.D.
1,000, population 900,000.
The population of Kent in
A.D.
597 was about 5,500. There is a
statement in Bedeâs Ecclesiastical History that the population of
Kent was 10,000 when Augustine landed, but this was an exaggeration.
There were then 21 monasteries in England. Between

A.D.
600 and 700, 100 monasteries were built and endowed.
Therefore in
A.D.
700 there were 121 monasteries for a population
of 160,000. Only 29 monasteries were built between 700 and
800, 22 between 800 and 900, 38 between 900 and 1000, and 43
between 1000 and 1066, or 253, but one-half of them were in
ruins through Danish invasions, at the time of the Conquest.

[92]

I shall now give the population of the country at the periods
when tithes were ordered to be paid by civil or ecclesiastical
law.

In 787, when the Popeâs two legates came to England, the
population was about 260,000. The Injunctions read to the
Northern Synod were attested by the King of Northumberland,
Archbishop of York, Bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, Whitherne,
Mayo in Ireland, Ethelwin of Bangor, two dukes, two
abbots, some presbyters, deacons and thanes.

In the Southern Synod they were attested by the King of
Mercia, Archbishop of Canterbury, Bishops of Lichfield, Lindsey,
Leicester, Elmham, London, Winchester, Dunwich, Hereford,
Selsey, Rochester, Sherborne, Worcester (13 bishops); 3 abbots,
3 dukes, and 1 comes,
i.e.
16 ecclesiastics and 5 laymen.

It will be seen from these facts that not only was the population
small, but ecclesiastics formed the majority in the synods or
councils who framed laws and canons for the payment of tithes
to the Church. King Athelstanâs law made in 927 for the payment
of tithes runs thus:â

âAthelstan, king, with the council of Wulfhelm Archbishop,
and of my other bishops, make known to the reeves, etc.â Here
is the King with a council of bishops making a law for the payment
of tithes to bishops themselves and to their clergy. And
this is considered the first general law in England for setting
forth the payment of predial and mixed tithes. The population
then was about 700,000.

In 960, King Edgar passed his tithe laws with and by the
advice of his Witan, who included the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and bishops. The population then was about 800,000.

Let us now take a glance at the number of bishops in England
and Wales up to the time of the Norman Conquest.

[93]

Kent had Canterbury and Rochester.

East Saxons: London. East Angles: Dunwich and Elmham.

West Saxons: Dorchester (transferred to Winchester), Sherborne,
Mercia (including eight counties), Lichfield, Leicester, Sidnacester
(or Lindsey), Worcester, Hereford.

South Saxons: Selsey.

Northumberland: York, Lindisfarne, Hexham.

Sixteen bishops in England and 4 in Wales in
A.D.
705, when
the population was only 160,000,
i.e.
a bishop for every 8,000. By
absorption only 14 bishops in England, 4 in Wales, and 1 in the Isle
of Man in 1066, or one bishop for every 66,000 of the population.

Lord Selborne, Bishop Stubbs, and Mr. Haddan
[172]
say the manorial churches,
to which Edgarâs laws granted one-third of the tithes, were the type of our
own modern parish churches. This I grant. It is
the first Act
of Parliament
by which they received tithes. By
custom
the
mother churches
originally received
tithes. But it was not by custom, but by an Act of Parliament passed
at Andover in
A.D.
960, that the type of our modern parishes received one-third
of the tithes of the parochial limits.

Up to
A.D.
1180, the owners of lands from which tithes arose might give
them, as they please, to bishops, chapters, monasteries, or
to the parish churches
on their own estates
. Hence, churches erected by landowners after 960 received
in
many
cases, up to 1180,
all the tithes
of the new parochial boundaries,
and not one-third.

But I disagree with them in limiting the origin of the type of our modern
parishes to
A.D.
960. I trace the
germ
of our modern parishes back to the
two earlsâ churches, consecrated in
A.D.
686.
[173]
Soames, Lappenberg, and Dean
Hook refer the origin of our modern parishes to Archbishop Theodore (668 to
693). That Bedeâs churches were in the north of England does not militate
against my view.
It was but the germ
, which gradually expanded.
[174]

[94]

CHAPTER X.

THE LAWS OF ETHELRED II.

The following nine laws appear in Thorpeâs âAncient Laws,â
etc.
[175]

I.
Council of Woodstock.
Thorpe takes his text from Cott.
Titus, A. 27. The MS. is of the thirteenth century, and contains
perhaps the best text extant of the old Latin version of the Saxon
laws. Wilkins has it among his âSaxon Laws,â but omits it in his
âConcilia.â Bromton also has it.

II.
The Treaty with the Norwegian Kings
, viz., Anlaf, Justin,
and Guthmund. Thorpe prints his text from the above MS.
Bromton has it Wilkins has it in his âLaws,â but not in his
âConcilia.â

III.
The Council at Wantage
(
A.D.
997). Thorpe prints it
from the above. Bromton has it. Wilkins has it in his âLaws.â

IV.
De Institutis LondoniÃ¦
(prob.
A.D.
997). Thorpe prints it
from the above, and remarks that it was a most important law as
regards the commercial and monetary history of England.

V.
Liber Constitutionum
(
A.D.
1008). Thorpe prints it from
Cott. Nero, A. 1. Wilkins has it in his âLaws,â but not in his
âConcilia.â Lord Selborne confounds this with the Ordinances
passed at Habam.

VI.
Council of Enham
(probably âEnsham in Oxfordshireâ).
Thorpe prints it from a MS. in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
[95]

201, which was written apparently in the middle of the
eleventh century, and which he collated with Cott. Claud., A. 3.
Wilkins has it in his âLawsâ and also in his âConcilia.â Spelman
dates the council
A.D.
1009.

VII.
Grith and Mund.
Thorpe prints it from Cott. Nero, A.
1, collated with MS. C.C. 201 (Nasmith). âThese manuscripts,â
says Mr. Thorpe, âclosely agree together.â Wilkins has it in his
âLaws,â but not in his âConcilia.â

VIII.
The Ordinances of Habam
(
A.D.
1012). Bromton alone
gives the text, from which Thorpe copied his text and collated it
with the Macro and Holkham manuscripts. Wilkins has printed
it in his âConciliaâ (i. 295), but not in his âLawsâ; Spelman has
it (âConcilia,â i. 530).

IX.
Church Grith
(
A.D.
1014). Thorpe prints it from Cott.
Nero, A. 1. collated with C.C. 201. He does not state that these
manuscripts closely agree together, as he does the two collated in
VII. Wilkins has it in his âLaws,â but not in his âConcilia.â

N.B.âVI. VIII. and IX. only are in the volume Nero, A. 1.

Bromton has only I. II. III. VIII.

IX.
Church Grith.

Mr. Thorpe takes his text from the so-called Worcester volume
of the Cottonian manuscript, Nero, A. 1, fol. 96
b
. It begins
thus:â

âThis is one of the Ordinances which the king of the English
composed with the counsel of his Witan, etc.â

Art. 6. âAnd respecting tithe, the king and his Witan have
chosen and decreed, as is just, that one-third part of the tithe
which belongs to the Church, go to the reparation of the Church,
and a second part to the servants of God, the third to Godâs poor
and to needy ones in thraldom.â

[96]

Art. 7. âAnd be it known to every Christian man, that he pay
to his Lord his tithe justly, always as the plough traverses the
tenth field, on peril of Godâs mercy, and of the full âwite,â which
King Edgar decreed, that isâ:â

Art. 8. âIf any one will not justly pay the tithe, then let the
kingâs reeve go, and the mass-priest of the minster, or of the
âlandricaâ (the proprietor of the land, lord of the soil) and the
bishopâs reeve and take forcibly the tenth part for the minster to
which it is due, and assign to him the ninth part; and let the
eight parts be divided into two, and let the landlord take
possession of half, half the bishop; be it a kingâs man, be it a
thaneâs.â

Art. 9. âAnd let every tithe of young be paid by Pentecost,
on pain of the âwiteâ; and of earthâs fruit by the equinox or at
all events by Allhallowâs Mass.â

âOn comparing these articles,â says Lord Selborne, âwith
King Edgarâs laws, it will be seen that, if enacted, they would have
omitted the clause in those laws which authorized the payment of
one-third of the local tithes to a manorial church having a burial
ground.â
[176]

Dr. Lingard says, âBut its (Edgarâs) subsequent re-enactment
in the reign of Ethelred, and again in the reign of Canute, will
justify a suspicion, that in many places its provisions were set at
defiance, and in many but very imperfectly enforced.â
[177]

Bishop Stubbsâs references to articles 2 and 44, and to the
latter part of the sixth of this law prove (1) that he read the
whole law of Church Grith in Thorpeâs translation by referring to
three articles of this law; (2) that he referred to the third part in
this law for the poor and needy in thraldom in support of a
[97]

certain statement which he made about the poor; (3) that if he
thought the law was not genuine or authentic, he would not have
quoted from it; (4) and that the very fact of his having quoted
from it, proves that he admitted its genuineness. Here are the
Bishopâs words: âThe case of the really helpless poor was regarded
both as a
legal
and as a religious duty from the very first
ages of English Christianity. St. Gregory, in his instructions to
Augustine, had reminded him of the duty of a bishop to set apart
for the poor, a fourth part of the incomes of his church. In 1342
Archbishop Stratford ordered that in all cases of impropriation a
portion of the tithe should be set apart for the relief of the poor.
The
legislation of the WitenagemÃ³ts of Ethelred bore the same
mark; a third portion of the tithe that belonged to the church was
to go to Godâs poor, and to the needy ones in thraldom
.â
[178]

Dr. Stubbs cannot go behind what he states above in his
published history.

Let us now compare this statement with what he has written
since he became a bishop. âThe tripartite division, never was
adopted in England, and that the passages in support of it are
either altogether unauthorized, or merely statements of an ideal
state of law conformable to the uses of some foreign churches.â
[179]

Lord Selborne gives the following extract from a printed letter
of Bishop Stubbs to a rural dean of the diocese of Chester, 12th
December, 1885: âThe claim of the poor on the tithe was a part of
the claim of the Church; and, although this claim
was never made
the subject of an apportionment, tripartite or
quadripartite, except
in unauthoritative or tentative recommendations, it has never been
ignored or disregarded by the Church or Clergy.â
[180]

[98]

How can Dr. Stubbs reconcile these statements with an actual
quotation which he had taken from Ethelredâs law, where the
threefold division is stated? It cannot be. Bishop Stubbs
and Professor Freeman must be kept strictly to what they have
published in their well-known histories until they publicly repudiate
what they have written. Private letters which contradict
historical statements must be ignored.

Sir Robert Cottonâs Library.

It is essentially necessary, before going further into the discussion
of the manuscript of the Church Grith law, to give a
sketch of the origin of the Cottonian Library.

Sir Robert Cotton, about
A.D.
1588, commenced and continued
for about 40 years to collect old charters, laws, seals, coins, etc.,
etc., which after the dissolution of the monasteries were dispersed
through the country from their invaluable libraries. Many of
them were secured by the nobility and gentry, but a considerable
number fell into the hands of peasants, mechanics, and other
persons who were ignorant of their important value and totally
careless of their preservation. Valuable books of parchments
were sold to grocers, soap-sellers, etc., who used them as they
do old newspapers now. Others were sent out of the country
in shiploads to foreign booksellers; the servants used them for
scouring candlesticks and rubbing boots. Two noble libraries
were sold for forty shillings. Sir Robert found no difficulty in
purchasing these valuable documents wherever he could find
them. Many of them were loose skins, small tracts or thin
volumes. Sir Robert had several of them bound up in one cover.
He also obtained by legacy and purchase some of the most
valuable manuscripts collected out of the scattered remains of
[99]

monastic libraries by Josseline, Noel, Allen, Lambarde, Bowyer,
Camden and others.

It was a timely and excellent opportunity for Cotton, Bodley,
and Archbishop Parker. Sir Robert formed his library in one of
the best rooms of his London residence called âCotton House,â
near the House of Parliament. He permitted persons to consult
and copy the manuscripts. It was in that library John Selden
obtained his wonderful stock of ancient lore, which made his
name immortal. Sir Henry Spelman drank deeply from the same
fountain. Other antiquarians were equally indebted to Sir Robert
Cotton. As I have already stated, he had many manuscripts
bound up in separate volumes, and others he arranged in small
parcels. Each volume and parcel contained several parts which
were written at different times. He had a list on the first page
of the headings of the manuscripts bound up in each volume. It
is very important to note that fact, because in the present volume
Nero, A. 1, there is the original list made in Sir Robertâs time, in
which ten headings of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts appear, but
none
of Church Mund and Church Grith laws
, because they were not
bound up in that volume, and I shall presently prove that these
manuscripts were not in the library during the lives of Sir Robert
and his son, but were put there towards the end of his grandsonâs
life. Therefore Selden and Spelman, and other antiquarians
who consulted Sir Robertâs library, did not and
could not
see the
Church Mund and Church Grith laws of King Ethelred II. in
the Worcester volume, as it is called, and where they are now
bound up. Were they in any other parcel or volume in the
library? They were not. Here is the proof. In 1629 the
Privy Council ordered the library to be locked up, and a catalogue
to be taken of the whole contents of the library in order to find
out whether any of the Kingâs books were in it. In 1631 Sir
[100]

Robert died; and in 1632 an engrossed official catalogue was
made out by order of the Privy Council. That catalogue is
now in the Cottonian Library, in the British Museum, marked
âAdd. MSS. 8926.â I have carefully examined the roll; it has
three seals attached to it; the titles of the manuscripts and
books are arranged under thirty-five headings, beginning with
âLibri Historici.â But there are no press marks such as Nero,
A. 1, Claudius, B. 3. Another heading is, âLibri Saxonici,â
under which every Anglo Saxon manuscript in the library in
1632 was placed; but the Church Mund and Church Grith
manuscripts do not appear under this heading. Then when
were they placed in the library and in this volume Nero, A. 1?
Sir Robertâs son and grandson added considerably to the library.
Sir John, the grandson, had given permission to Dr. Thomas
Smith to make a catalogue of the contents of the fourteen presses.
In 1696 Dr. Smith published the first printed catalogue in which
the Worcester volume, Nero, A. 1, contains only the same ten
Anglo-Saxon headings which appear in the list of 1632. I conclude
that the Church Mund and Church Grith laws were not
in the Worcester volume in 1695, when Dr. Smith penned his
Preface.

An Act of Parliament was passed in 1700 vesting the Library,
after the death of Sir John, in trustees, who were Matthew
Hutton, John Anstis, and Humphrey Wanley. Sir John died in
1702. The library then passed at once into the custody of the
three trustees. The first thing done was to make out a catalogue
of the contents of the library on the death of Sir John, when
the trustees took possession. In 1705, Wanley, one of the
trustees, published his âAntiquÃ¦ LiteraturÃ¦ Septentrionalis
Liber, etc.â His preface is dated 28th August, 1704. For the
first time the Church Mund and Church Grith laws appear in
[101]

Wanleyâs Catalogue. He was the first who named the volume
Nero A. 1 as the âWorcesterâ volume, and Platna copied
Wanley. From these facts I conclude that the above laws were
purchased or otherwise obtained by Sir John Cotton, and were
put into the âWorcesterâ volume between 1695 and 1702. I
am aware that Dr. Smithâs catalogue was very imperfect, and
these laws might have been in the library when he issued his
imperfect catalogue. But this is a pure conjecture on my part.
My conclusions are based on facts, and not on conjectures.
There is not the slightest doubt about the correctness and completeness
of the official catalogue of 1632. They were not then
in the library.

I have considered these details as vitally essential in the important
discussion which is here to follow.

Lord Selborneâs âAncient Facts and Fictions.â

He has published a book on âAncient Facts and Fictions
concerning Churches and Tithes,â in which he has devoted
a large portion to prove that the Church Grith law of
A.D.

1014 âwas either a draft or project of laws which the framer,
evidently an ecclesiastic of Ãlfricâs school, wished to have
enacted.... There is indeed now written in the margin
of that manuscript,
[181]
in a small modern hand, the date âAáµ.
Dom. 1014.ââ
[182]
I have often examined the manuscript, and
found the reading to be âAâ¿áµ. dni. 1014.â Lord Selborne gives
the reading as it is printed in the Catalogue, but decidedly it is
not the reading in the manuscript. It is supposed to have been
written by Josseline, secretary to Archbishop Parker. There is
internal evidence in article 43 to support this date (1014), viz.
[102]

âBut let us do as is needful to us; let us take to us for an
example that which former secular Witan deliberately instituted.
Athelstan and Edmund, and
Edgar who was last
,â etc.

Ethelred had returned from exile in the spring of 1014, after
which this law was passed.

In reference to the above words in italics, Lord Selborne says
that Edward (975-979) reigned between Edgar and Ethelred,
and therefore Edgar could not have been the last;
[183]
but it must
be remarked also that Edred and Edwy who reigned between
Edmund and Edgar, are also omitted in this 43rd article. Then
why had the framers of the whole law particularized the names
of Athelstan, Edmund, and Edgar, and leave out Edred,
Edwy, and Edward? If we look at the arrangement of the
Anglo-Saxon laws, we find the order as above, viz., the laws of
Athelstan, next those of Edmund, and next the laws of Edgar,
none by Edward, then come the laws of Ethelred. The 43rd
Article referred to these laws, and therefore Edgarâs were the
last. So there is no force in Lord Selborneâs remarks.

King Ethelredâs law on the threefold division of tithes has
been found so important in the discussion on the tripartite
division that Lord Selborne has devoted all his eminent legal
powers, though unsuccessfully, to upset this Anglo-Saxon law.
(1) His first witnesses are Selden, Spelman, Lambarde, Wheelock,
and John Johnson.

âSelden and Spelman,â says Lord Selborne, â
were well
acquainted
with the Worcester (Cottonian) manuscript; and as
neither of them made mention of this Church Grith document, it
may be inferred that they did not regard it as having the character
or the authority of a law.â
[184]

[103]

âIf Lambarde, Wheelock, and John Johnson,â continues Lord
Selborne, âwere acquainted with either manuscriptâChurch
and Mund, and Church Grithâ(
the contrary supposition is improbable
),
the inference as to them also, from their silence about it
(
i.e.
the Church Grith) must be the same,â
i.e.
that âthey did
not regard it as having the character or the authority of a law.â
[185]

I shall examine these five writers
seriatim
.

(1) John Selden published his âHistory of Tithesâ in 1618. I
have already proved that the Church Grith law was not in Sir
Robert Cottonâs library in 1632. It was therefore impossible
for Selden to have seen it in the âWorcester manuscript.â
The âWorcester (Cottonian) manuscriptâ is a very vague and
loose way to express the Worcester (Cottonian) volume Nero,
A. 1. The fact is that Selden had never seen or heard of the
Church Grith law, otherwise he would unquestionably have referred
to such a law in his âHistory of Tithes.â In dealing with
Egbertâs Excerptions, Selden has quoted largely in his âHistory of
Tithesâ from this very volume, which contained the Excerptions,
and which volume in his time had no particular name. In his
marginal quotation he merely informs his readers that they were
taken from a âMS. in the Biblioth. Cottoniana.â We have lost
the advantage of his valuable opinion on the Church Grith law, by
its absence from the volume from which he had made large quotations
on other subjects. I agree with Lord Selborne that Mr.
Selden was well acquainted with the contents of the volume; but
I totally disagree with his lordshipâs inference as regards Seldenâs
silence on the Grith Law, because that law was not in the volume
for him to see or read; nor was it in the library.

(2) Sir Henry Spelman published his first volume of the
âConciliaâ in 1639. In this volume he gives only two of King
[104]

Ethelredâs laws out of the nine given by Thorpe. As a matter
of fact, he, like Selden, had never seen or heard of the Church
Grith law. Spelman was one of Sir Robertâs most intimate friends,
and had access to every manuscript and book in his library.
Lord Selborne assumes without any authority that the so-called
Worcester volume in Cottonâs Library, open to the inspection
of Selden and Spelman, contained
all
the manuscripts which it
now contains. If Lord Selborne had only taken the trouble of
reading the original list of manuscripts on the first page of the
volume, he would see at once that the Church Mund and Church
Grith are not in the list of manuscripts contained then in that
volume. Therefore Selden and Spelman could not have seen
them. The original list, and no more, is in the catalogue of 1632.

(3) William Lambarde, the Kent antiquarian, published his
collection of Anglo-Saxon Laws in 1568, in which the Church
Grith law does not appear, from which Lord Selborne again

infers
that Lambarde did not regard it as having the character
or the authority of a law. Let us apply his Lordshipâs canon
of criticism to other omissions made by Lambarde in his collection
of Anglo-Saxon laws, and then see to what conclusions
such inferences lead.

He omitted the Laws of the Kentish Kings, the Laws of
William the Conqueror and of Henry I. Then are we to infer
that Lambarde saw these âdocuments,â but would not notice
them in his collection because âhe did not regard them as
having the character or authority of lawsâ?

This is really the logical sequence of Lord Selborneâs
inferential

canon of criticism, as regards Lambardeâs omission of
the Church Grith law. The fact is that he, like Selden and
Spelman, had never seen the law.

(4) Wheelock published a second edition of Lambardeâs
[105]

âLawsâ in 1644, in which he added the laws of the Conqueror and
of Henry I., but omitted the laws of the Kentish kings. Why?
Must the answer be according to Lord Selborneâs canon of
criticism, viz., that âhe regarded them as not having the character
or the authority of lawsâ? No. He, like Lambarde, had
not seen the Kentish laws or the Church Grith law.

(5) John Johnson published a âCollection of the Laws and
Canons of the Church of England,â in 1720, mainly founded
upon Spelmanâs âConcilia.â

Mr. John Baron, in his new edition of Johnsonâs collection,
published in 1850, says, âMr. Thorpe publishes some ecclesiastical
laws of King Ethelred at pp. 129, 141, 145, which
were
altogether unknown
to Johnsonâ
[186]
There is at p. 129 âLiber
Constitutionumâ; at p. 141 âGrith and Mundâ; at p. 145
âChurch Grith.â

Mr. Baronâs edition is quoted probably one hundred times
by Lord Selborne in his âFacts and Fictionsâ and âChurch
Defence,â and he must unquestionably have read Baronâs Prefatory
statement that âGrith and Mundâ and âChurch Grith
lawsâ
were unknown
to Johnson. Yet in the face of that statement,
Lord Selborne says, âIf Lambarde, Wheelock, and John
Johnson were acquainted with either manuscript (
the contrary
supposition is improbable
), the inference is that they did not regard
it (Grith law) as having the character or the authority of a law.â
I have taken these five authors
seriatim
, and the general conclusion
is that the Grith law was unknown to each and all of them.

II. His sixth witness is Wilkins. Lord Selborne says:â

âDavid Wilkins was the first to publish the Church Grith in
his âLeges Anglo-Saxonica,â where he combined it in a manner,
for which the manuscripts afforded no warrant, with the Ordinances
[106]

of âHabam,â etc. If he had regarded it as an authentic
ecclesiastical law when he afterwards (in
A.D.
1737) published his
great collection of âActs of Councilsâ and other English ecclesiastical
documents, it must have found a place there, which it does
not.â
[187]

Dr. Wilkins was also the first to publish the laws of the Kentish
kings.

Mr. Thorpe says of Wilkinsâs âConcilia,â âAs a monument of
industry this edition is very creditable to Dr. Wilkins; at the
same time it must, though reluctantly, be acknowledged by every
one competent to judge, that as a translator of Anglo-Saxon he
not unfrequently betrays an ignorance even of its first principles,
that though not unparalleled, is perfectly astounding.â
[188]

I shall now examine the above statement of Lord Selborne.

I have failed to find that Wilkins combined the Grith with the
Ordinances of Habam. These Ordinances do not appear at all in
his âSaxon Laws.â The four laws of Ethelred which he has are
(1) Liber Constitutionum, (2) Mund, (3) Church Grith, (4)
Wantage.

Now the âLiber Constitutionumâ has 35 articles, of which 19
are ecclesiastical. But Wilkins did not insert it in his âConcilia.â
And yet Lord Selborne makes no remark on its omission, but he
is careful to note the omission of the Church Grith.

III. His seventh witness is Mr. Price,
[189]
who commenced to
edit, under the instructions of the Record Commissioners, an
edition of the âAnglo-Saxon Laws.â Archdeacon Hale, of London,
like Lord Selborne, was a great stickler for the non-admission
of any tripartite division of tithes in England. He was mainly
guided by Wilkinsâs edition of 1737, and had not even seen his
[107]

âAnglo-Saxon Laws,â which were published in 1721. But after
having written strongly against the tripartite division, a friend
referred him to Ethelredâs law of 1014, in Wilkinsâs âAnglo-Saxon
Laws.â He became anxious on reading it, and stopped
a new edition of his work until he could have the point clearly
settled. He consulted Mr. Price, who, on the 26th July, 1832,
addressed the following letter to him:â

âIt is an unauthorized assemblage of points of canon law,
gathered indifferently from foreign and home sources, and he did
not think it genuine, because Wilkins had omitted it from his
new edition.â
[190]

The Archdeacon seemed not to be satisfied with this formal
opinion, and so after Priceâs death, which occurred soon after he
had written the above letter, he consulted another gentleman,
âWhose reputation,â says the Archdeacon, âfor extensive knowledge
of Anglo-Saxon literature is not confined to his own university,
or to this country, but whose name I do not consider
myself at liberty to mention. He gave me in writing an opinion
at variance with that of Mr. Price, and
was in favour of the
genuineness of the law of Ethelred
, and his opinion was founded
upon the fact of Schmid having published it in his edition of the
Anglo-Saxon Laws, and
upon the persuasion that no weight whatever
was due to what Wilkins had said or thought upon the subject
.â
[191]

I have always admired the straightforward manner in which the
Archdeacon placed the whole matter before the public. A prejudiced
person would have kept back the damaging opinion of the
unnamed writer. He is therefore much fairer on this matter than
Lord Selborne, Mr. Fuller, and Mr. Chancellor Dibdin, who,
while quoting Priceâs opinion,
carefully avoided any reference whatever
[108]

to the second or favourable opinion, although it is printed
in a footnote at the page where Priceâs letter appears.
[192]

Reinhold Schmid, to whom the Archdeaconâs second referee
referred, was Professor of Laws at Jena, and published at Leipzig
in 1832 an edition of the âAnglo-Saxon Laws.â âThis edition,â
says Mr. Thorpe, âis a very creditable publication, decidedly
superior to the preceding ones (
i.e.
Lambardeâs and Wilkinsâs).
The version is free from the gross errors of Wilkins and generally
correct.â
[193]

This statement corroborates the independent testimony of the
Archdeaconâs unnamed writer.

IV. Lord Selborneâs eighth witness is Professor Freeman, of
Oxford.

âMr. Freeman,â says Lord Selborne, âwho seems to have
accepted the date
A.D.
1014 as evidence that the document represents
some public act of that year, was also led to the conclusion
that these were âhardly laws at all,â but mere âadvice,â and an
expression of pious and patriotic feeling, a promise of national
amendment rather than legislation strictly so called.â
[194]

I shall give some extracts from Mr. Freemanâs letter written
in 1885, directly referring to the Church Grith law, and then I
shall contrast such opinions with those expressed on the same
subject in the last edition of his âNorman Conquest,â published in
1877. The reader can then form his own conclusion with regard
to the letter and the historical statement.

âThe only caseâ he says in his letter, âof the action of the
[109]

State in the ancient laws is that to which I have referred in the
laws of Ethelred.
[195]
Here the sixth enactment of 1014, under the
head of Church Grith, clearly ordains the threefold division, and
that with solemnity.

âHere then at last we come to the threefold division of the
tithe enjoined by secular as well as by ecclesiastical authority.

But something is wanting to make legislation perfect.
If we look
on a little further to the next clause but one, we shall find a strict
enactment about the payment of tithes, and not only an enactment,
but
a means prescribed for carrying the enactment into force
.
But this is simply copied from an earlier law of Edgar.
[196]
And in
the law of 1014 it stands almost alone as a real piece of legislation
with a sanction. In truth these laws, of which I have found
something to say elsewhere,
[197]

are hardly laws at all
. As was not
wonderful, under the peculiar circumstances of the time,
they are
rather an expression of pious and patriotic feeling
(see the last
clause), a kind of promise of national amendment than legislation,
strictly so called. They go along with the discourses of Archbishop
Elfric,
good advice rather than legislation
, rather than with
those codes which not only make decrees, but provide means for
executing them. In such a collection of recommendations rather
than of real statutes we are not at all surprised to find the threefold
division of tithe. But it is nowhere found in any of those
codes which are real acts of legislation, providing the means for
carrying out what is ordained, etc.â

Mr. Freeman, in his long private letter, has produced no proof
whatever to upset the Church Grith as a proper legal enactment.
He has not stated what the
something
was to make the legislation
[110]

perfect. If he means that no provision was made to carry out
what was ordained, he contradicts himself, because he distinctly
states above what is true, that as regards the sixth law for the
payment of tithes, âmeans were prescribed, copied from Edgarâs
laws, for carrying the enactment into force.â

It was quite common for an Anglo-Saxon king and his WitenagemÃ³t
to re-enact some of the laws of his predecessors. So
Ethelred re-enacted Edgarâs law as to the punishment which
would follow the non-payment of tithes. And Cnute re-enacted
wholesale the laws of his predecessors.

The most remarkable, inconsistent, and contradictory part of
this letter is the abrupt jump which the writer takes from statements
he was making
in support
of the Grith laws, to the statement,
âIn truth these laws are hardly laws at all.â

I now turn to Mr. Freemanâs âNorman Conquestâ to find
what he has written in it about this law. In it we get the mature
thoughts of the historian, before Lord Selborneâs books appeared.

âIt was most likely,â says Mr. Freeman, âin a GemÃ³t held on
his return, that the King and his Witan passed the laws which
bear the date of this year.
[198]
They relate mainly to ecclesiastical
matters, but they contain the same pious and patriotic resolutions
as the codes of former years, and they also contain some clauses
of a special and remarkable kind. He expressly approves the conduct
of certain earlier assemblies held under Athelstan, Edmund,
and Edgar, which dealt with ecclesiastical and temporal affairs conjointly,
and they seem to deplore a separation between the two
branches of legislation which had taken place in some later assemblies.â
He then refers to sections 36, 37, and 38 of the Church
Grith, and adds, âcf. sec. 43, where the three kings are named.â

[111]

âThe laws of this year (1014) again proclaim that one God
and one King is to be loved and obeyed.â

â
Such is the general summary of the last recorded legislation of
Ethelred, conceived in exactly the same tone as the laws of earlier
assemblies.
â
[199]

Here there is no reference whatever that in this last recorded
legislation of Ethelred, âthey were hardly laws at all, but rather
an expression of pious and patriotic feeling, a kind of promise
of national amendment, than legislation strictly so called.â

The two statementsâone in the History, and the other in a
private letterâare contradictory. Contradictory statements
coupled with an immense display of pedantry and egotism,
characterize the recent writings of this author.
[200]

Historians must be kept to the opinions expressed in their
published histories until they publicly repudiate them. This Mr.
Freeman has not yet done. Private letters which contradict them,
are not only worthless, but are injurious. Historians who adopt
this plan place themselves in a false position before the public.
They cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.
They cannot
consistently
address private letters to clerical
tithe-owners expressing opinions against the threefold division
of tithes, and Church Grith law, which contradict their historical
opinions and statements.

V. The next witnesses produced by Lord Selborne are the
Old Latin Translators of the Anglo-Saxon laws. âAn earlier
[112]

collection,â he says, âof the Anglo-Saxon laws, translated into
Latin in the twelfth century, of which Bromton may be presumed
to have made use (though by giving the Habam Ordinances he
has shown that he had also access to other materials) contains,
with that exception, the same laws which are in Bromton.â

âThe Latin translators, therefore, if they were acquainted, as
is possible, with the documents omitted in both collections
(
i.e.
in their Anglo-Saxon laws, and in Bromtonâs), but classed by
more modern compilers among the public acts of King Ethelredâs
reign, did not regard them as possessing that character in any
such sense as to make it fit that they should find a place in a
code of Anglo-Saxon laws; and it may be inferred that they
found no such place in any records of a public nature to which
those translators had access.â
[201]

Here, again, his lordship resorts to his stereotyped formula,
when laws are omitted by writers that âThey did not regard
them as possessing the character of laws.â I have already shown
the several omissions made by various writers in their collections
of Anglo-Saxon laws,
because they were unknown to them
. If we
adopt Lord Selborneâs canon of criticism, we must not only sweep
away the Church Grith law, but actually
five
of King Ethelredâs
laws, because they do not appear in the old Latin version!

I have carefully compared Thorpeâs collection with the old
Latin version, and the following is the result. There are fifteen
Anglo-Saxon laws in Thorpeâs collection which are omitted in the
old Latin version; viz., the Laws of the Kentish kingsâEthelbert,
Lothere, Edric, and Withred. King Alfredâs Scriptural
Laws, King Athelstanâs Decretum Cantianum and Decretum
Sapientum AngliÃ¦, King Edmundâs Concilium Culintonense,
King Edgarâs Supplemental Laws, King Ethelredâs Liber Constitutionum,
[113]

Council of Enham, Church and Mund, Church
Grith, and Council at Habam; King Cnuteâs Forest Laws.

Applying Lord Selborneâs canon of criticism, we are bound to
repudiate every one of these fifteen laws, because they are not in
the old Latin version. He cannot draw the line at the Church
Grith law, and not include the others.

In the face of these facts, Lord Selborne adds: âThe Ancient
Latin Version of the Anglo-Saxon laws
was evidently meant to be
complete
, and which does contain all the legislature properly so
called of Ethelredâs predecessors from Alfred downwards (why
not also before Alfred?), and also of Canute.â
[202]
Lord Selborne
does not tell us who the Latin translators were, and what opportunities
they had, or what materials were at their command to
make their code complete. What official position did they
occupy? But we know, as an unquestionable fact, that the
Latin version was
not complete
, and that up to 1840 we have
not had a complete code of Anglo-Saxon laws from extant
manuscripts until Mr. Thorpeâs was published under the direction
and authority of the Commission of Public Records.

âThe undoubted legislation Acts,â he further adds, âof
King Ethelredâs reign (viz., the Ordinances of Woodstock and
Wantage), and also that to which the Latin date
A.D.
1008 is
prefixed, have general titles in the Anglo-Saxon text, signifying
that they were passed by the king in the national WitenagemÃ³t.
But the title of the document numbered IX.
[203]
by Mr. Thorpe,
is very different.â
[204]
This is not correct, for the law numbered IX.
in Thorpeâs, has this title, âThis is one of the Ordinances which
the King of the English composed with the counsel of his
[114]

Witan.â
[205]
Now, let us compare this title with those of (1)
Woodstock, (2) Wantage, and (3) the Law of
A.D.
1008, which
Lord Selborne admits to be genuine. (1) âThis is the Ordinance
which King Ethelred and his Witan ordained.â
[206]
(2) âThese are
the laws which King Ethelred and his Witan have decreed at
Wantage.â
[207]
(3) âThis is the Ordinance that the King of the
English and both the ecclesiastical and lay Witan have chosen
and advised.â
[208]
These facts completely refute Lord Selborneâs
statements. The general title to the Church Grith law, with the
name of the King and Witan, is as strong as that of any of the
admitted legal Acts stated by Lord Selborne. Again, if we compare
the title of the Church Grith with that of Athelstanâs law, it
is even stronger and in much better legal form. Here it is: âI,
Athelstan, King, with the counsel of Wulfhelm, archbishop, and
of my other bishops, make known to the reeves,â etc.
[209]
Selden,
Kemble, and Bishop Stubbs admit, but Lord Selborne denies, the
above to be a genuine law of King Athelstan. Lord Selborne
criticises the titles of Anglo-Saxon laws made nearly 1,000 years
ago in the same critical and technical manner as he would one
passed at the present time. Here is an example. The Church
Grith law begins thus: âThis is
one
of the ordinances which the
King of the English composed with the counsel of his Witan.â
Here is Lord Selborneâs note: âThis form of expression is singular.
I do not think that anything exactly like it is to be found elsewhere.â
[210]

The usual style is, âThis is the ordinance,â etc., or,
âThese are the ordinances,â etc. But there is really no practical
difference.

VI. The next witness is John Bromton, abbot of Jervaulx in
[115]

Yorkshire, who lived towards the end of the fourteenth century.
His history comprises the period from
A.D.
588 to
A.D.
1198.
Brompton copied his collection of Anglo-Saxon laws
[211]
from the
Latin version. But he alone has the text of the Ordinances
passed at Habam. He has four of the nine laws of Ethelred.

Lord Selborne says: âBromton knew no laws of the reign of
King Ethelred, except those of Woodstock and Wantage, the
Treaty with the Norwegian kingsâAnlaf, Justin, and Guthmund
(all purely secular), and the Ordinances of Habam, which he only
preserved.â
[212]

The Ordinances of Habam are found only in Bromtonâs
history, and they contain one important provision as to tithes
and other Church dues. Art. 4: âAnd we charge that every
man, for the love of God and all His saints, give church-scot, and
his rightful tithe as it stood in the days of our ancestors, when it
stood best; that is, as the plough shall pass through the tenth
acre, and let every customary due be paid for the love of God to
our mother-church to which it is near. And let no one take
away from God what belongs to God, and our ancestors have
granted.â
[213]

This Ordinance would indicate a spirit of revolt against the
payment of tithes, and that the provisions made by previous
kings for their payment were set at defiance. I do not agree
with Lord Selborne that this Ordinance grants
all the tithes
and

dues
to the
nearest mother-church
, and thereby cancels or disregards
Edgarâs law as to the payment of one-third of the tithes
to the manorial church with burial ground.
[214]
The revolt about
paying the customary dues or tithes was against payment to the
mother-churches and not to the manorial churches. This is a
[116]

vital distinction as indicating an early revolt against the spiritual
parochial endowments having been given to churches which did
no spiritual duties in the manorial parishes for them.

Owing to the same spirit of setting the tithe-law at defiance, we
find a re-enactment of Edgarâs stern law to enforce the payment
of tithes in the 6th article of the Church Grith, and a second
re-enactment by Cnute. It would be most unreasonable, and
indeed absurd, to assume that the Habam Ordinances ignored the
claims of the manorial churches to a third of the parochial tithes.
The manorial churches in the beginning of the 11th century were
too numerous to be deprived of their portions of the tithes, especially
in 1014, when Ethelred, after returning from exile, tried to
conciliate the clergy.

Dr. Lingardâs opinion is valuable upon this point. âIt was
probably thought,â he says, âthat a law so precise (as Edgarâs),
and so severeâa forfeiture of eight-tenths of the cropâwould
insure for the future the exact payment of the tithe; but its subsequent
re-enactment in the reign of Ethelred,
[215]
and again in the
reign of Canute, will justify a suspicion that in many places its
provisions were set at defiance, and in many but imperfectly
enforced.â
[216]

Mr. Fuller, in âOur Title-Deeds,â regards Dr. Lingardâs
silence about the Church Grith law as âinexplicable in every
way.â The above quotation, as regards this law, clearly proves
the charge to be groundless.

As Bromton had copied his Anglo-Saxon laws from the old
Latin version, he has not fourteen of the fifteen laws which were
omitted in that version.
[217]

âIt may be asserted,â says Lord Selborne, âwithout risk of
[117]

error, that
no part
of the Worcester volume, Nero, A. 1 of the
Cottonian collection was written before the end of Cnuteâs reign,
who died in 1035, for the volume begins with Cnuteâs laws,
which are followed by those of Edgar, Alfred, Athelstan, Edmund,
Ethelred; and after them Grith and Mund, and Church
Grith:âall in Anglo-Saxon,
without break
, and in that order.â
[218]

Every reader of âFacts and Fictionsâ cannot consult the Worcester
volume to judge for himself whether this statement is
correct or not. Readers generally accept as true what men of
position and education publish, without investigatingâfor they
have not timeâthe truth of the subject-matter. Mr. Fuller makes
the following candid admission: âIn Thorpeâs âAnglo-Saxon
Laws,â i. 342, the tripartite division
seems expressly sanctioned by
law
; it will be therefore necessary for us to investigate this important
fact, and see
if it is not possible to shake its authority and
bearing on the case
.â
[219]
This is exactly the spirit with which
certain writers attack the law. Let us test the above quotation
from âFacts and Fictions.â The volume contains 184 folios
quarto. Folios 1 to 39 form the first tract in the volume; 42 to
56 the second; 57 to 68
b
the third; 71 to 97
b
the fourth, etc.

There was a good deal of guess work in arranging the tracts
in this order. They were not written by the same hand; some
were written early in the eleventh century, and others in the
third quarter of the same century. The laws of Canute, Edgar,
and part of Alfredâs, were written in the Conquerorâs reign.
A large portion of Alfredâs laws is written in Josselineâs hand,
in the 16th century, then a common practice to complete imperfect
manuscripts, and the manuscript of Alfredâs laws in the
Worcester volume is very imperfect. Then the laws of Athelstan
[118]

and Edmund may be seen at once to be a much earlier hand, of
the first quarter of the 11th centuryâthe period assigned by
Thorpe. There is a fragment of Edgarâs laws at folio 89, placed
between Edmundâs and Ethelredâs, and in the same handwriting,
and fully sixty years earlier than Edgarâs laws, which are at folios
15 to 41. These facts as to dates of handwriting can easily be
verified by comparing them with charters of certain dates. I
have compared the handwriting in the several tracts with the
charters written towards the end of the 10th century, and beginning,
middle, and end, of the 11th. The Church Grith law was
certainly written before Canuteâs death in 1035. There are
several breaks in the volume between the laws of the five kings,
although Lord Selborne says, âAll in Anglo-Saxon,
without break
.â
The first break is of six folios between the first and second parts
of Alfredâs laws. Then a second break of no less than twenty-eight
folios between the last part of Alfredâs and the beginning of
Athelstanâs. Here, then, are two breaks of thirty-four folios, and
there are seven heads of other manuscripts on different subjects
which are bound up in these breaks of thirty-four folios.

It is quite evident that in the Worcester volume, Nero, A. 1, we
have
two incomplete sets
of Anglo-Saxon laws, picked up by Sir
Robert Cotton and thus preserved from destruction, which Lord
Selborne would lead one to think were
one complete, continuous
set of laws
of these five kings. The other parts are lost. I have
already given a brief sketch how our antiquarians collected, as best
they could, the tons of manuscripts which belonged to the libraries
of the dissolved monasteries scattered throughout the country.

Here is one specimen out of many from âOur Title-Deeds,â
p. 119, by which Mr. Fuller attempts âto shake the authorityâ of
the Church Grith Law. âA document,â he says, âwhich Selden
casts a slur upon, is surely not one upon which to rest a fact of
[119]

English history.â Then in a footnote Mr. Fuller adds, âSelden
calls it only a sort of document, and passed in a Council in a
kind of Parliament, and tells us it remains only a manuscript of
or about the time of the
Roman
Conquest. The preface of it
shall be here first noted, that the authority of it may be better
understood,
i.e.
appraised at its real value.â

Mr. Fullerâs book is dedicated to Lord Selborne, who truly
states that Mr. Selden, in his âHistory of Tithes,â
made no
mention of the Church Grith document
.
[220]
Of course, Mr. Fuller is
romancing as usual. Miserable efforts âto shake the authorityâ
of a law. There is not one word of truth in the whole of the
above quotations. âRoman Conquest!â Utter nonsense.

Mr. J. S. Brewer.

Mr. J. S. Brewer in âThe Endowment and Establishment of
the Church of England,â supported the tripartite division of tithes.
But after his demise, Mr. L. T. Dibdin
[221]
has edited a new edition
in which he opposes Brewerâs views. He adopts the views of
Archdeacon Hale and Lord Selborne. He states that the
supporters of the tripartite division can bring forward only
spurious canons and laws to prove their case, and then instances
(1) a
spurious passage
in the âPenitentialâ of Archbishop Theodore,
for proof of which he refers to âHaddan and Stubbs,
âCouncils,â iii. 173, note 203â; (2) An alleged law of Ethelred
(1013), and adds in reference to Ethelredâs law, âBut the better
opinion [he actually blends together the opinions of Price,
Stubbs and Selborne] appears to be that the code, of which it is
a part, is a private compilation or collection of points of Canon
Law gathered indifferently from foreign and home sources, published
tentatively, and not recognised as possessing any legislative
[120]

force. With this exception (if it be one), no English law as
distinguished from Ecclesiastical ordinance or opinion, directs the
division of tithe into thirds or fourths, or refers to the supposed
right of the poor to a share.â
[222]

As regards the quotation from the well-known writings of
Haddan and Stubbs, they actually held the opposite opinion to
that attributed to them by Dibdin. They state that Theodoreâs
âPenitentialâ is genuine. Here are their words, which may be
contrasted with Dibdinâs: âIn 1851, at Halle, Dr. F. W.
Wasserschleben, Professor of Law in the University of Halle,
published from a comparison of several continental manuscripts,
the work of the âDiscipulus Umbrensium,â which is to be found
in our text.â They then enumerate nine editions of works published
under Theodoreâs name. They reject all as spurious except
the âDiscipulus Umbrensium,â which they printed from the Corpus
Christi College Cambridge MS. 320. The three eminent scholars,
Mr. Haddan, Bishop Stubbs and Professor Wasserschleben,
pronounce distinctly and emphatically in favour of the genuineness
of the treatise of the âDiscipulus Umbrensiumâ as being the
genuine âPenitentialâ of Theodore. The Cambridge manuscript,
they assert, was written not later than the eighth century, although
the reference to another copy found in lib. ii. c. xii. s. 5 seems to
preclude the idea that it is the original.
[223]

Bishop Stubbs, in his history, remarks that in this very âPenitential,â
viz., lib. ii. c. xiv. s. 10, commencing, âDecimas non est
legitimum dare,â
the clergy had not the sole use of the tithes
.
[224]

I refer the reader to pp. 20-23 in this book for a full discussion
on this point.

[121]

In the second place, as regards Mr. Priceâs opinion, I must also
refer the reader to p. 107.

Cnuteâs Laws.

These laws are divided into three branches, (1) Ecclesiastical,
(2) Secular, (3) Constitutiones de Foresta.

The text from which Mr. Thorpe prints (1) and (2), is Cott.
Nero., A. 1, which was written in the middle of the eleventh
century. The text of (3) is from Spelmanâs âGlossarium ArchÃ¦ologicum.â
There are twenty-six laws in (1); eighty-five in (2);
thirty-four in (3).
[225]

In
A.D.
1018 at a WitenagemÃ³t at Oxford, Cnute confirmed
the laws of Edgar. âThe laws of Edgar,â says Lappenberg,
[226]

âhad shown particular regard to the Danes dwelling in England,
while in those of Ethelred, as far as we are acquainted with them,
similar provisions do not appear.â This was the true reason for
Edgarâs laws having been adopted as a model by Cnute. He
also made use, however, of Ethelredâs laws, especially those on
Ecclesiastical subjects. It is remarkable to find very many of the
articles of âGrith and Mundâ and of âChurch Grithâ embodied
in Cnuteâs laws, although much pains have been taken to prove
that these laws were spurious and unauthentic. And yet we find
that no less than thirty-six of the forty-four articles in the Church
Grith law are incorporated in Cnuteâs laws! It is interesting
to notice how Lord Selborne disposes of the remaining eight.
Five (articles 36 to 39 and 43), he says, are of that historical,
rhetorical, expostulatory and didactic character as are not proper
for laws which could in that or any similar form be enacted by
[122]

any legislature. One was omitted apparently as superfluous (
i.e.

41: âIf a monk or mass-priest become altogether an apostate,
let him be for ever excommunicated, unless he the more readily
submit to his duty.â) Two remain which were evidently, on
consideration, disallowed. One is for the tripartite division of
tithes, of which there is no trace in any later collection of Anglo-Saxon
laws, and one is rejected (art. 32) which gave extraordinary
aid and protection to abbots and their stewards.
[227]
Now by rejecting
article 32, are we to suppose that the abbots and their
stewards were not to be protected by the kingâs reeves? for the
article states, âAnd the King commands all his reeves in every
place that ye protect the abbots on all secular occasions as ye
best may; as ye desire to have Godâs or my friendship, that ye
aid their stewards everywhere to right, that they themselves may
the more uninterruptedly dwell closely in their minsters, and
live according to rule.â
[228]

It has escaped Lord Selborneâs notice that Cnuteâs confirmation
of Edgarâs law, which grants one-third of the tithes to the
manorial priests, comes to the same thing as the threefold division
of tithes in the Church Grith law. The principle is the same in
both, namely, that the manorial priest, or the priest of the mother
church, was legally entitled to no more than one-third part of the
tithes, and that the modern use of taking
all the tithes
was contrary
to all rules, laws, and customs. They were never originally
given, and would never be given to the priests on any such condition,
namely, to convert them all to their own personal useâin
fact, to be their own private property or income, as is the case now.

Now the great and important question is, âWhen and in what
way did the manorial priest acquire the other two parts?â How
did the third, asks Lord Selborne, pass into the whole? His
[123]

answer is, âThere is not, as far as I know, so much even as a
canon of any council, or a decree of any Pope in the nature of a
legislative act, enlarging the right, or appropriating tithes generally,
to parish churches in England or elsewhere.â
[229]

His conclusion is, that as the laity were at liberty to give their
tithes to whatever church they wished, âthey might with equal
right and reason endow parish churches on their own estates with
the predial tithes of their lands within the parishes; and the
probability was that they would do so. No more likely explanation
of the general prevalence of such parochial endowments, where
churches were not appropriated to monasteries, has yet been
suggested.â
[230]

Lord Selborneâs statement is very plausible, but will not stand
investigation. The incumbents were only trustees, and as such
received all the tithes. They had a common law right to a
usufructuary part only, so had the poor and strangers and the
church fabric. But in the various changes which took place in
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the trustees gave what
they liked of the tithes to the poor, and also placed the expenses
of repairing the church fabric upon the parishioners. It is too
much to assume that the poor and strangers were in a pecuniary
position to appeal, as Lord Selborne and others assert, to the
superior courts and claim their share of the tithes. A body
representing the poor with funds at their disposal might have done
so, but it is really too much to expect that the individual poor
person had his or her âlegal remedy,â as they assert, against the
parson for his or her part of the tithes. The fact is, that the
incumbents began in the thirteenth century to consider themselves
not as trustees but actual owners of all the tithes of their parishes,
and doled out to the poor some alms, and therefore kept up a
[124]

semblance of assisting the poor. It is remarkable that lay and
clerical rectors in receipt of the rectorial tithes are bound, up to
the present time, to keep the chancel of the church in proper
repair, and if blown down, to rebuild it. This is a remnant of
the original claim on the tithes to repair the fabric of the church.
The monastic rectors set the example of totally neglecting to
repair the churches appropriated to them, and the parishioners,
for their own comfort and convenience, collected funds among
themselves to keep the churches in repair, although it is a fact
that the owner of the rectorial tithes was bound by common and
canon law to keep in repair the whole church fabric, including not
only the chancel but also the body of the church.
[231]
The secular
rectors were not slow in following the example of the religious
rectors, and in course of time they saddled the parishioners with
the expenses of repairing the body of the church. The present
trustees have therefore misappropriated all the tithes to their own
use. Again, it is stated by Lord Selborne and others that when
the poor laws were enacted, Parliament would have made the tithe-owners
contribute to the support of the poor, if it thought they
were bound to set apart a portion of the tithes for this purpose.
But who were then the law-makers? The majority of them
were then in possession of the extensive monastic tithes, and
landed properties. It is well known that the properties were
handed over to them subject to the same burdens which had been
attached to the same properties when they were in possession of
the monastic bodies; but the new owners ignored these burdens.

[125]

CHAPTER XI.

THE FIRST POOR LAW ACT.

The first Act for the relief of the poor was passed in 1535 (27
Henry VIII., c. xxv.).

âAll governors of shires, cities, towns, etc., shall find and keep
every aged poor and impotent person which was born or dwelt
three years within the same limit, by way of voluntary and charitable
alms, etc., with such convenient alms as shall be thought
meet by their discretion,â etc.

It was in this year (1535) that the lesser monasteries were dissolved.
So the first poor law was enacted, to provide for the poor
and impotent, in the same year in which the dissolution occurred.

The total annual revenue of
all
the monastic and chantry
estates, together with the episcopal and chapter estates surrendered
to the Crown, was about Â£300,000, which, if carefully managedâsay
by a Board of Commissionersâto provide for the poor,
would now realize an annual revenue of eight and a half millions
sterling, sufficiently adequate to defray all the expenses of the
poor of England and Wales, without a penny expense to the
ratepayers. All the vast properties were disgracefully granted
away to unprincipled, poor, avaricious favourites and courtiers of
Henry VIII., and his children.

It was Cromwell who, in his desire to promote the Reformation,
advised the King to divide the abbey lands among the nobles and
gentry, either by grant or sale on easy terms; and that by being
[126]

thus bound by the sureties of private interest, they might always
oppose any return towards the dominion of Rome.
[232]

Cromwellâs views turned out to be correct, as we know from
the conduct of members of Parliament who were in possession of
monastic property. In Maryâs reign her Parliament, which was so
obsequious in all matters of religion, adhered with a firm grasp to
their Church lands. Nor could the papal supremacy be re-established
by Mary until her sanction was given that they should
be allowed the full enjoyment of their Abbey lands, and we may
ascribe the zeal of the same class, in bringing back and preserving
the reformed Church under Elizabeth, to a similar motive; that,
according to the general laws of human nature, they gave a readier
reception to truth, which made their estates more secure.
[233]
They
would be any religion, provided they retained their church lands.
[234]

The 31 Henry VIII., c. xiii., expressly states that the laity in
possession of the lands of the dissolved monasteries were to
maintain hospitality. But they never did any such thing, nor
were they required to do so. They increased the rentals of the
monastic, episcopal and capitular lands fourfold more than had
previously been paid, for ecclesiastical lands were let at about
one-fourth of their rack-rental value. A good deal of the land
was tithe-free, and therefore higher rentals were demanded than
for lands which paid tithes. These men made the poor laws;
their increased rentals increased pauperism, but they had only a
small fractional part to pay themselves towards the maintenance
of the poor; the bulk of the rates for the relief of the poor (increased
[127]

in number by the conduct of these new landlords) was
paid by people unconnected with the land.

âThe poor of England,â says Blackstone, âtill the time of
Henry VIII., subsisted entirely upon private benevolence, and
the charity of well-disposed Christians. For though it appears
by the âMirrorâ that by the Common Law the poor were to be
âsustained by
parsons
, rectors of the church, and the
parishioners
,
so that none of them die for default of sustenance;â and though by
the statutes 12 Rich. II., c. vii. and 19 Henry VII., c. xii. the poor
are directed to be sustained in the cities or towns wherein they
were born or where they had dwelt for three years (which seem to
be the first rudiments of parish settlements), yet till the statute of
27 Henry VIII., c. xxvi., I find no compulsory method chalked
out for this purpose; but the poor seem to have been left to such
relief as the humanity of their neighbours would afford them.
The monasteries were, in particular, their principal resource.â
[235]

Here the âMirrorâ distinctly states that by Common Law the
parson and his parishioners sustained the poor, and by the same
Common Law the parson, as trustee, received all the tithes, and
by the same law the poor had a claim to a part of those tithes.

It is a favourite argument with Lord Selborne, and others who
follow him, that the part allotted out of the tithes for the poor
would be insufficient for their support. But he omits the important
fact that in one of Edgarâs canons it was enacted that the
people should also distribute alms to the poor, so that the part
allotted out of the tithes was not intended to be the
whole
maintenance
which the poor should receive.
[236]

[128]

In
A.D.
960, when Edgarâs laws and canons were enacted, the
population of England was about 800,000, with about 1,000,000
acres under cultivation. The provision for the poor was more
than sufficient.

Mr. Blunt, in his âHistory of the Reformation,â tells us that
âA large body of almost starving people was formed by the ruined
monks, and those who had been maintained by them, either in
labour or charity. Rents were enormously raised by those to
whom the monastic grants fell by grants or purchase, the new
landlords exacting three or four times more than had been required
by the old church landlords. The poverty of the poor and
the wealth of the rich drew away class from class and introduced
that disintegration of society, which caused so much trouble in
the 17th century.â
[237]

Sir Simon Degge, in his âParsonâs Counsellor,â says âThat
there are many pluralists in England that hardly see either of their
livings in a year; that all the greatest and best livings in the kingdom
are now (1676) held by pluralists, and served by mean
curates; that thereby many poor souls are neglected in danger to
perish; that in many places two great parishes are left to the care
of two boys, who came but the other day from school, and perhaps
fitter to be there still, while the shepherd that takes the fleece
either feasts it out in his lordâs family or takes his ease upon a
prebend or deanery; that it is no other than hiring out the sacred
trust to pitiful mercenaries at the cheapest rate; that it is a thing
of high scandal for one to receive the fees and commit the work
to some inferior or raw practitioners; that one end of the law of
residence (21 Henry VIII.) was to maintain hospitality; that the
best livings in the kingdom are served with poor curates and no
hospitality; that we are now in a far worse condition than before
[129]

making the Act, for that dispensations from Rome were slow and
costly, and that there are ten dispensations for pluralities now to
one then.â He further added that the revenues of the Church
were divided into four parts, and referred to Pope Sylvester as
having originated this division; and then used these words:ââ
And
I would wish every clergyman to remember that the poor have
a share in the tithes with him
.â
[238]

Referring to this authorâs words, Lord Selborne says, âSir
Simon Degge was a (not particularly distinguished) lawyer of
Charles the Secondâs time. For his citation of Pope Sylvester, etc.,
he was called to account in his own day, and in a later edition he
defended it lamely enough, maintaining on the authority of some
Roman canonists the genuineness of the extracts from synodical
Acts of Pope Sylvester published by Isidore, and it must therefore
be supposed, of the forgeries in the same collection also.â
[239]

He carefully avoids giving us the name of the writer who
called Degge to account. It was the Rev. Henry Wharton, the
author of the âAnglia Sacra.â

In 1693 this boy pluralistâthe author of âA Defence of Pluralitiesââpublished,
under the name of Anthony Harmer, âA Specimen
of some Errors and Defects,â in Bishop Burnetâs âHistory of
the Reformation.â For an account of the malicious spirit in which
this book was written, see Burnetâs Preface to the third volume of
his âHistory of the Reformation.â âHere is a writer,â says the
Bishop, âwho is wanting in Christian temper and in decency, and
I regret to see such facts and industry soured and spoiled with so
ill a temper.â
[240]

Dr. Cave, author of âHistoria Literaria,â who employed
[130]

Wharton as his amanuensis, in a letter to Archbishop Tillotson,
fully corroborates Bishop Burnetâs character of Wharton. The
bishop knew who Anthony Harmer was, and his caustic remarks
on Whartonâs âAnglia Sacraâ were well deserved.
[241]

While Lord Selborne traduced the character of Degge, âas a
not particularly distinguished lawyer,â he has not a word to say
against Henry Whartonâs
legion
of blunders. I shall prove that
Sir Simon Degge does not deserve the above character.

Sir Simon Degge was a judge of West Wales in 1660; recorder
of Derby in 1661; Knighted in 1669; a bencher of the Inner
Temple; in 1673 was high sheriff of Derbyshire. His âParsonâs
Counsellor and Law of Tithesâ was a leading text book for many
years. He dedicated it to a bishop, and in his sixth and last
edition in his lifetime, he writes: âTo the parsons, vicars, and
the rest of the reverend clergy of the Church of England. Your
kind acceptance of the former impressions of the book has encouraged
me this sixth time to appear in public.â He died in 1704.

In this edition he says, âNor is there any doubt but that by
the Canon Law
the poor ought to have a share in the revenues of
the church
, which was all I endeavoured to prove.â
[242]

Lord Selborne quotes his closing admonition from the seventh
revised edition of 1820,
i.e.
116 years after Deggeâs death: âBy
all which it appears that
originally
the poor had a share of the
tithe.â
[243]
Degge never wrote these words, and it is not fair nor
just to a dead author to publish a garbled edition of his work,
and to quote against him from this garbled edition. I have
[131]

given above his own words from his last edition published in
1703.

The 13 Eliz. c. xx. enacts that the lessor absent above eighty
days in a year should lose one yearâs profits of the benefice, to
be distributed by the Ordinary among the poor of the parish.

A subsequent statute (18 Eliz. c. xi. s. 7) confirms the above;
and provides that the Ordinary shall grant sequestration of the
profits, and in default that every parishioner may retain his tithes;
and the churchwarden will take the other profits of the benefice
to distribute among the poor.

The rights of the Poor to a portion of the tithes were given by
(1) The Act of 1014; (2) 15 Rich. II. c. vi.; (3) 13 Eliz. c.
xx.; (4) 18 Eliz. c. xi. s. 7.

When we come to the Act for the relief of the Poor, (43 Eliz.
c. ii.) it provides for the taxation of every occupier of lands, houses,
tithes impropriate, propriation of tithes, coal mines and underwoods.
But it does not take any portion of the tithes for the
support of the poor; hence it is argued that the poor had no
claim to any portion of the tithes. The fact is, that previously
there was no machinery by which their claims could have been
carried out. The parochial incumbents were trustees of their property,
and as such had many claims on their incomes, the poor
had to put up with whatever the trustees wished to give them.
And finally the trustees
closed upon all the tithes
as their own.

There is a remarkable instance on record, in which certain
parochial rectors
closed upon all the tithes
of their parishes.

Henry de Blois, Bishop of Winchester, founded the Hospital
of St. Cross, near Winchester, by his charter dated
A.D.
1137,
in which he named sixteen churches, with their appurtenances
and appendages, with which he endowed the Hospital. The
commuted value of the tithes of these sixteen parish churches
[132]

is Â£12,006 per annum. Now, the Hospital has only the tithe-rent
charges, amounting to Â£3,462 per annum, of four out of the
sixteen. The Hospital lost all the tithes of twelve parishes, and
the twelve rectors are now in possession of them, giving in lieu
the insignificant sum of Â£44 per annum, in the aggregate, as
pensions.

Now, when did these twelve rectors close upon all the tithes?
It was before the Reformation, because in the reign of Henry VIII.
the Hospital had only the four churches. It is highly probable
that the twelve rectors closed upon all the tithes during the period
of the protracted quarrels between the Bishops of Winchester and
the Priors of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, as to who
should have the appointment of the master of the Hospital.
[244]

The parochial incumbents commenced about the beginning of
the fourteenth century to close upon all the tithes, and to ignore
the claims of poor or church fabric upon these revenues. So at
the period of the Reformation, the incumbents claimed to have a
prescriptive right to
all the tithes
.
[245]

[133]

CHAPTER XII.

CANONS FOR PAYMENT OF TITHES.

Alexander III., who was Pope from 1159-1181, was very active
in writing to archbishops and bishops of foreign churches, commanding
them to order the people to pay tithes. In 1170 he
wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and to the Bishop of
Winchester on the subject. The former prelate held a provincial
synod in 1175, at Westminster, at which were present
King Henry II., his crowned son, and all the bishops and abbots
of the province. At this Synod the Popeâs letter for the payment
of tithes was read. In compliance with such orders from a
foreign bishop, the Synod commanded all tithes to be paid on
crops from the ground and from trees, of young animals, wool,
lambs, butter, cheese, etc. Anathemas and excommunications
were hurled against all and every one who would not pay tithes.

The Archbishop of York, twenty years after (1195), held a
similar synod in his province, which also commanded the payment
of tithes; and this synod, like that of Westminster, wound
up its proceedings with anathemas and excommunicationsâthe
great bugbear of those daysâagainst all who would not pay
tithes. These archbishops were only acting up to orders from
Rome. They were tools in the hands of the Pope, to carry out
the orders of a foreign bishop who usurped supremacy over
all other Christian churches.

The most important canon of the English canon law for the
[134]

payment of tithes, was that passed in
A.D.
1295 (23 Edw. I.), at
a provincial synod held in London by Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop
of Canterbury (1294-1313). The canon sets forth that
on account of the various quarrels, contentions, and scandal,
arising between rectors and their parishioners, as regards several
customs then in use of paying tithes, some uniform claim was
necessary to be set forth. It then ordains that tithes were to be
paid on the gross value of all crops from the ground, from trees,
herbs, and hay. It also sets forth how tithes were to be paid on
the produce of animals, lambs, and wool. If sheep were fed in
one place in winter and in a different place in summer, the tithe
was to be divided. Similarly, if any one should buy or sell sheep
in the middle of the time, and it was known from which parish
they came, the tithe of these sheep must be divided, as it followed
the two residences. But if it were not known, then that
church should have the whole tithe within whose limits at the
time of shearing they were found. It further states how milk
was to be tithed, and that tithes were to be paid for the pasture
of animals, according to their number, and the number of days.
Tithes were to be paid on mills, fisheries, bees, etc., etc., which
were yearly renewed. There was nothing in this canon about
paying tithes on timber wood, because it was part of the inheritance
of the land.

The canon then passed from predial to personal tithes. Artificers
and merchants were to pay tithes of the profits of their
business; and carpenters, blacksmiths, weavers, and all other
workmen working for wages, were to pay tithes of their wages.
This meant that after deducting all reasonable and necessary
expenses, they were to pay the tenth part of the profits.

The rector was also to receive his mortuary fees, viz., the
clothes worn by the person before dying, also a horse and cow.
[135]

These fees were to be paid as a satisfaction to the Church for the
personal tithes which he had forgotten, or wilfully neglected to
pay in his lifetime.
[246]
Henry VIII. fixed a money payment in lieu
of the mortuary fees. This was the origin of burial fees. If
parishioners would not pay their tithes, they were to be excluded
from the Church until they did so; and if they continued contumacious,
other ecclesiastical censures would follow. An Act was
passed, 2 and 3 Edward VI. c. xiii. s. 9, that modified and limited
the payments of personal tithes. âThat in all such places where
handicraftsmen have used to pay their tithes within these forty
years, the same custom of payment of tithes to be observed and
to continue; and if any person refuse to pay his personal tithes,
etc., it shall be lawful for the Ordinary of the same diocese to call
the same party before him, and by his discretion to examine him
by all lawful and reasonable means, other than by the partyâs own
corporal oath, concerning the true payment of the said tithes.â

The main difficulty in collecting personal tithes arises in the
want of any method of discovery.

In
A.D.
1343, a canon was passed at a provincial synod of
Canterbury, held at St. Paulâs, London, that all manner of timber
was tithable.
[247]
This canon led to bitter strife, because wood had
not been previously tithable; for, like mines and quarries, it was
thought to be a part of the inheritance of the land. Timber was
not tithable in the important canon of 1295. It does not yield
annual profits; yet the tithe of wood is due by common law
right.

In reference to making canons at synodical meetings, it was
both profitable and pleasant work for ecclesiastics. The laymen
who had to pay were not permitted to be present to express an
[136]

opinion in the matter. The tithe system was a very elastic band.
It was stretched as population and agriculture increased. We
have the principle of development exhibited in a remarkable
degree in the tithe question. As the power and influence of
the bishops of Rome increased in the dark and middle ages, so
did tithes. Yet we are unblushingly told that tithes were the
free voluntary offerings of private individuals. I admit this to
a limited extent. The question is, Did all the landowners freely
and voluntarily grant tithes of the produce of their lands to
the rectors of parishes? The synodical meetings to which
I have referred, prove that they were not so given, but were
arbitrarily exacted by the anathemas of the Church, and by
ecclesiastical and civil courts.

Things became tithable by the canons of 1295 and 1343, which
were not thought of in the days of Kings Offa and Ethelwulf.
Provincial synodical canons of the dark and middle ages had a
pretending binding force upon the people. But those ecclesiastics
had put the last straw upon the donkeyâs (peopleâs) back
in their synod of 1343. The young British House of Commons,
then only seventy-eight years old, was roused to opposition. In
1343, 1344, 1347, and 1351, the House petitioned Edward III.
against the canon of 1343, but the petitions led to no satisfactory
result.
[248]
The Commons succeeded, however, in 1371, in limiting
the power of the canon. It was enacted
[249]
that trees of twenty
yearsâ growth and upward should not be tithable, and that if
a suit should be commenced in any spiritual court for the payment
of such tithes, a prohibition should issue. This was the
first victory gained by the House of Commons as regards tithes.
[137]

The failures in the above years were caused by ecclesiastical
influence exercised over the King. There had been previous
Acts on Church questions, such as the Mortmain Act of 1297,
which was a much bolder step than that of 1372, but it was
rather the production of King Edward I. himself than any
action of the House of Commons, owing to the nervous state of
feeling among the lay nobility to check the extensive alienation
of property to the monasteries which deprived the King of help
towards the defence of the country. The nobility were also becoming
extremely jealous of the growing power and luxurious
living of the monastic bodies, and also of the Church dignitaries.

The Statute of Mortmain had forbidden the Kingâs subjects
from bequeathing lands and tenements to the
religiosi
without
the Kingâs license. But the shrewd, cunning monks eluded the
Act by licenses of alienation. Here we have another instance of
ecclesiastical ingenuity in devising plans to evade the law. Testators
left property in perpetuity to support priests to pray for
their souls. Hence originated thousands of chantries throughout
the country, but they followed the same fate as the monasteries.
Much landed property had thus indirectly passed into the hands
of ecclesiastics. In 1531, an Act was passed that all such
wills would not in future hold good for more than twenty years.
The Legislature thought that twenty yearsâ prayers were sufficient
to get a testatorâs soul out of purgatory, and that twenty yearsâ
revenue amply remunerated the priest for his services.
[250]

The House of Commons was not a century old when a Bill
was brought in, âThat no statute or ordinance of the clergy be
granted without the assent of the Commons, and that the
Commons be not subjected to any constitutions
which the clergy
make for their own advantage
, without the assent of the Commons,
[138]

for the clergy do not wish to be subjected to any statute or
ordinances made by the Commons without the consent of the
clergy.â

From the angry tone of the Commons on the canon of 1343,
may we not naturally infer that if the House existed in 1175 or
1195, or at an earlier date, or was a little older in 1295, when
the most important canon was passed, that they would have
made a similar energetic protest that âThey would not be subjected
to any canons which the clergy made for their own advantage
without the assent of the Commonsâ? I have already fully
explained that the popes, archbishops, bishops, chapters, secular
clergy and monks, took advantage of their position in the dark
and middle ages in imposing on the credulity of the simple and
innocent laypeople, by pretending that the Christian priesthood
were the successors of the Mosaic priesthood, and therefore were
entitled by Divine right to the tithes enacted by the Mosaic laws,
and even a great deal more of the tithes which those cunning and
crafty ecclesiastics added thereto by their numerous canons passed
by them at councils and synods where no layman dare appear.

In the âEnglishmanâs Brief for his National Church,â to which
I have before referred, it is asked (Q. 21), âIs it not hard on the
cultivators of land that they should have to pay tithes on its
produce?â The answer given is, that there is really no hardship
in the matter. âIf a person rents land which in every respect is
tithe-free, he pays so much more rent for it; if it be subject to
tithes, he pays so much less. In any case he pays the same
amount,â etc. This answer was written for the purpose of misleading
the reader. The landlord will try to get as high a rent
for his land which is not tithe-free as the landlord who has his
land tithe-free. But another important question arises. Why
should the whole burden of paying tithes fall upon land? There
[139]

was a time when personal tithes were also paid. Scripture was
quoted in support of these tithes. But they are all now
abolished, and only landâand not all the landâhas to pay
tithes.

The Earl of Selborne makes the following remarks in his
pamphlet: âThe Endowment and Establishment of the Church of
England.â âThe rectorial tithes of Selborne, which belong to a
college at Oxford,
[251]
were in 1882, Â£447; the vicarial tithes, which
alone belong of right to the Vicar of Selborne, were Â£336. The
rectorial or lay tithes of two parishes in Basingstoke also belong
Magdalen, Oxford, were in the same year Â£1,617. A lady received
the rectorial tithes of Bishopâs Sutton, amounting to Â£1,431; and
one of the London Companies, those of Chertsey, amounting to
Â£1,112.â I have placed in the Appendix a statement as to the
recipients of the clerical appropriations; also the impropriations
of colleges, schools, hospitals and charities, as they appear in the
Tithe Commutation Return of 1887.

In the âBrief,â it is asked (Q. 28): âWere not many of the
Endowments which the Church of England now holds given to
the Church of Rome?â No, is the answer, and it adds, âNot
a single endowment was given to the Church of Rome.â Both
question and answer are misleading. The Church of England
was never
the Church of Rome
. The correct way to put the
question, but which would not suit the misleading object the
author of the âBriefâ had in view, is, âWere not almost all the
endowments, which the Church of England now holds, given to
her when she held the same doctrines as the Church of Rome?â
Yes. The main object of the grants and endowments of land,
churches, tithes, etc. was that perpetual prayers should be offered
up by the recipients and their successors for the souls of the
[140]

benefactors, of their families and relatives. The benefactors believed
in the doctrine of purgatory, and in the efficacy of prayers
to bring their souls out of it. The Church of England in pre-Reformation
days believed and taught the same lucrative doctrine.
It also taught that works of charity and not faith were stepping-stones
to heaven. Two churches, E and R, held the same doctrines,
and both received large endowments in tithes, lands, etc.,
in support of such doctrines. For centuries E was in possession
of such endowments, but in the sixteenth century E repudiated
the doctrines by the teaching of which E had obtained the endowments
from certain benefactors who otherwise would not have
given them. Parliament permitted E to hold the ancient endowments
on certain conditions specified in Acts of Parliament, and
E now dishonestly ignores the conditions, holds the doctrines
repudiated, but keeps a firm grip on the ancient endowments.
E has but a parliamentary title to the ancient endowments. And
as such, Parliament has the right to change and convert the endowments,
if it should think proper, to other purposes. At the period
of the Reformation there was no physical transfer of the endowments
from the old to the new trustees; from incumbents who
would not conform to the Acts of Parliament, to those who did conform.
The incumbents who were in possession of the endowments
before the Acts were passed, and who conformed to the Acts
when passed, were left in possession of them, and as their successors
similarly conformed to the Acts, they peaceably entered
into possession; so there was no physical transfer of the property,
but there was a change of trustees when the old trustees declined
to conform to the Acts of Parliament, but no change when they
did conform. It is therefore very clear that the Church of
England holds her ancient endowments by a parliamentary title,
just as the Sovereign does the throne. And the logical sequence
[141]

is that Parliament has the right, if it should think proper, to convert
the endowments to any other use, especially when the present
holders are frequently ignoring the conditions upon which they
were granted at the Reformation.

It is not quite correct to say at page 52, in the âBrief,â that
all the monastic endowments have been swept away and confiscated
to the Crown. The properties of the alien priories are
now enjoyed by some of our wealthy colleges and public
schools. Henry VIII. had endowed, out of the monastic properties,
six bishoprics and chapters, of which five bishoprics
exist at the present day. Again, Christ Church, Oxford, the
aristocratic college for the sons of our nobility, was built and endowed
out of the property of over twenty monasteries which were
confiscated, with the full sanction of both King and Pope, in order
to supply Cardinal Wolsey with funds to build and endow
âCardinal College,â Oxford. This college receives at present
Â£40,000 per annum gross from tithe-rent charges. Again, the
eight conventual chapters were not only left in possession of all
their monastic endowments, but also received in augmentation of
their incomes a great deal of the properties of some of the dissolved
monasteries. For example, Canterbury received almost
all the endowments of St. Augustineâs monastery.

The year 1836 was a turning-point in the episcopal and capitular
endowments; the 6 & 7 William IV. c. lxxvii. created the
Ecclesiastical Commission. The commissioners utilized the endowments
in order to provide for the spiritual destitution of large
parishes. Up to 1890, upwards of 5,700 benefices have received
Â£971,700 per annum in perpetuity towards augmenting the incumbentâs
incomes. We must add to this the enormous capital
sums which have been expended out of the Common Fund of the
Commissioners, in erecting some thousands of new parsonages,
[142]

repairing and clearing off mortgages of others. The average net
income of the âCommon Fundâ is more than one million a year.
The gross income of the âCommon Fundâ of the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners, on the 31st August, 1890, was Â£1,722,709; it
disbursed that year Â£1,140,334, leaving a balance of Â£582,374.
[252]

Fully four-fifths of the properties in the hands of the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners has come, partly from the ancient public
landed endowments granted to archbishops, bishops, and
chapters by Anglo-Saxon kings with the consent of their
respective WitenagemÃ³ts; and partly from the monastic rectorial
tithes which were transferred by the Crown to the above
corporations in lieu or exchange of landed estates surrendered
to the Crown at the period of the Reformation.

The duties performed by the parochial priests for the tithes
were their regular duties, including (1) saying mass, (2) praying
for the dead, and (3) invoking the saints. But by Acts of Parliament
the mass has been suppressed, the dead by some are not
prayed for, and the saints are no longer invoked by some who
now enjoy the tithe-rent charges.

It is stated in the âBriefâ that âwhen the principal parochial
endowments were given, papal supremacy was not admitted by
the Church of England, and Roman doctrines were not held.â
I have already explained the active part the popes and legates of
Rome had taken to introduce the payment of tithes in England.
There is not a shadow of doubt that the supremacy of the popes
of Rome was admitted by the Church of England when tithes,
the principal endowment, commenced to be paid first by custom
and afterwards by compulsion in the Anglo-Saxon Church. The
Roman doctrines followed the supremacy. The archbishops
from the time of Augustine received their palls from the Pope,
[143]

and Pope Boniface V., in a letter dated
A.D.
624, conferred
the primacy of all Britain on Justus, Archbishop of Canterbury.
The letter contained these remarkable words, âHanc autem
ecclesiam utpote specialiter consistentem sub potestate et tuitione
sanctÃ¦ RomanÃ¦ ecclesiÃ¦.â
[253]

Again in 634 Pope Honorius I. conferred the primacy to
Canterbury, and again in 668 Pope Vitalian gave the supremacy

over all England
to Archbishop Theodore.
[254]

It must be noted that the endowments of the Church were not all
given at once, but were spread over a period of about six hundred
years. The period will be longer if we take the time in which
the waste and barren lands of Edward VI.âs Act were brought into
cultivation; and again the lands and corn-rents awarded by the
Inclosure Acts of last and present centuries in lieu of tithes. So
the above quotation from the âBrief,â like a great deal more of
the book, is nothing but twaddle. The parochial endowments
commenced on a small scale in the latter part of the seventh
century, when landowners commenced to build churches upon
their own estates, and they increased in the eighth and ninth.
First the endowments consisted of church, parsonage and glebe;
then tithes were added first as free-will offerings. The Norman
Conquest made great changes in the Church of England. The
Norman monks, who looked on the Pope and obeyed him as the
supreme head of the Church, introduced a new plan by inducing
landowners to appropriate their churches with their glebe and
tithe endowments to them. To give an idea of the enormous
impetus which had been given to the erection of monasteries from
1066 to 1215, or 150 years, there were 427 erected in England,
possessing extensive endowments in lands and tithes. Add
[144]

130 up to
A.D.
1066, and we get 557, as the total number in 1215.
I have selected 1215, for by the Council of Lateran tithes were
henceforth to be paid to the parochial clergy, thus abolishing from
1215 the system of appropriating parochial tithes to monasteries
and other bodies. The decadence of building and endowing
monasteries commenced with the reign of Richard I. (1189).
Tithes were not given to monasteries until after 1066, and from
this year to 1215 they had received the tithes of some thousands
of parishes. Of course they put vicars in the parishes to perform
the religious duties, and allowed them at first certain stipends, but
afterwards the small tithes. The question now is, In what respect
did the Church of England differ in doctrines and discipline from
the Church of Rome from the seventh to the thirteenth centuries,
and from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries? The parochial
system continued in course of formation for 600 years. During
this time the Church received the principal parochial endowments.
It cannot be stated with truth that the âRoman doctrines
were not held by the Church of Englandâ during this
period of 600 years. Neither can it be said with truth that
âpapal supremacy was not admitted by the Church of Englandâ
during the same period.

There is no doubt whatever that the original donors of Church
endowments would never have given them to men who not only
ignored but utterly detested their most dearly cherished doctrinal
views, viz: (1) the mass, (2) prayers for the dead, and (3) praying
to the saints. To support this statement, I shall give a quotation
from a speech delivered in the House of Lords by Archbishop
Howley, in 1840, when speaking on the Cathedral Bill. âThey
must consider,â he says, âin what times many of the donations
of property were made. The persons who have made them
might, and probably would, if living in the present day, wish to
[145]

see them applied in a very different manner.â These remarks
were made in reply to the following observations delivered in the
same debate by Dr. Sumner, Bishop of Winchester. âWhat
rightâ he asked, âhad the Legislature so to deal with property
given for
certain specific purposes
, not by the State, but by individuals,
for ever?â The Archbishop pointedly stated in the
speech quoted above, that the âcertain specific purposesâ existed
no longer.
[255]

It is again stated in the âBriefâ that tithes are not endowments(!)
and that they were given âwithout any specific conditions
being attached to their payment.â Is it reasonable to
think that tithes were given to the parish priest without a â
quid
pro quo
â? Is not the â
quid pro quo
â implied in his office?
The âBriefâ further observes at p. 52: âIt is an interesting
work for all zealous people concerned in such matters to see, as
a matter of public trust, that those who now possess such property
[256]

shall fulfil the conditions attached to its original grant or bequest.â
I cannot defend for one moment the enrichment of the
nobility and gentry of this country with Church spoliation. But
I ask myself the question: âDo the Bishops of Chester,
Gloucester and Bristol, Oxford and Peterborough and their
respective chapters, âfulfil the conditions attached to the original
grant or bequest of the property which they possess?ââ We
must not forget that the King who endowed them with monastic
property, passed the Act commonly called âThe Whip with its
Six Strings,â and, further, that he died in the full belief of the
doctrines of the Church of Rome, then the doctrines of the
Church of England, of which he was the supreme head.

[146]

CHAPTER XIII.

APPROPRIATION OF TITHES TO MONASTERIES.

From
A.D.
1000 to
A.D.
1215 is a remarkable period in the
history of the English Church and English monasteries. The
monasteries were built and richly endowed with lands, churches,
and tithes. All these were conveyed by deeds of gifts to their
perpetual use. The benefactions were given for the special purpose
of prayers being perpetually said by the monks in their respective
churches for the repose of the souls of the donors and
their relatives. In some cases the monasteries received the tithes
without any churches; but when they received churches with the
cure of souls, then the monastic corporations became rectors by
virtue of which they were in possession of all the tithes of each
parish. For many centuries the benefactions were conveyed by
lay owners, without any reference to the king or bishop, for they
were considered as private property, which the owner may dispose
of to whom he pleased. Subsequently it was necessary, before
such grants could be given, to obtain the licence of the king and
bishop in order to complete the scheme. After the Conquest,
the Norman monks invented the system of having churches with
their tithes appropriated to them. Previous to the Conquest
there were no appropriation of churches, but patrons granted to
monasteries, bishops or chapters the advowsons of the churches.
As religious services had to be performed in the church appropriated,
the monastic body had either to depute one of their
[147]

own fraternity in Holy Orders to do the duty, or to appoint a
deputy or vicar to act for them and to whom they gave most
miserable stipends. This latter alternative became the general
rule. But the abbot or prior took care to get the lionâs share of
both parochial tithes and offerings. The capitular bodies, nuns
and religious military orders imitated the practice of the monks
and received similar licences for appropriating churches from
the king and bishop. The same system was adopted by single
persons, such as deans, chancellors, treasurers, precentors, and
archdeacons. Even parochial incumbents had nominated vicars
to do their work, and they themselves became sinecure rectors.
The pretext which the monks had given to gain appropriations was
to obtain two parts of the tithes and profits, leaving a third to the
parish. These two parts were for the relief of the poor and the
repair of the church; but in course of time they neglected both
poor and fabric, and the parishioners, for their own comfort, had
actually subscribed towards a fabric fund and hence originated
church rates which were, like tithes, at first purely voluntary, but
subsequently became compulsory.

When the practice of appropriating churches, with their glebe
and tithe endowments, was first introduced by the Norman monks
in England, the patrons or owners considered that they were
transferring a freehold property, and therefore thought the conveyance
did not require the bishopâs confirmation. The patron
conveyed his gift by placing the deed of conveyance and a knife
or cup upon the altar of the church of the monastery, as this
was then the usual mode of livery of seisin. In the deeds of
conveyances some are given âCanonicis ibidem Deo servientibus,â
etc.; others, âCanonicis regularibus ibidem Deo servientibus,â
etc.; and, âMonachis ibidem Deo servientibus,â etc.

The lay patrons sometimes exercised the power of discharging
[148]

the incumbent of his church and appointing another in his place.
The church was not as now, the incumbentâs freehold property.
He then held his position according to the will of the patron.
We have sufficient evidence on this point. It is stated in the
Acts of the Third Lateran Council of
A.D.
1179-80, âSo far has
the boldness of laymen been carried, that they collate clerks to
churches without institution from the bishops,
and remove them
at their will
; and, besides this, they commonly dispose as they
please of the possessions and goods of churches.â This council
condemned âarbitrary consecrations,â as Selden calls them, of
laymen. âBefore the Council of Lateran (evidently the third),
any man might give his tithes to what spiritual person he
would.â
[257]
Four English bishops sat at this council. The Council
gave the death-blow to arbitrary appropriations of tithes by laymen,
without the consent of the bishop, to whatever church or
monastery they pleased. It was ordained by this Council that
no religious orders should receive any appropriations of churches
or tithes without the assent of the bishop. In Anglo-Saxon
times the tithes were given to the parish churches, but from

A.D.
1066 to
A.D.
1200, they were also given to monasteries,
bishops, and capitular corporations. âArbitrary consecrations
of tithes,â says Blackstone, âwere in general use till the time
of King John, which was probably owing to the intrigues
of the regular clergy or monks of the Benedictine and other
rules, under Archbishop Dunstan and his successors, who endeavoured
to wean the people from paying their dues to the
secular or parochial clergy. A layman, who was obliged to pay
his tithes somewhere, might think it good policy to erect an
abbey, and there pay them to his own monks, or grant them to
some abbey already erected, and thus have masses for ever sung
[149]

for his soul.â
[258]
Not only had laymen appropriated tithes to
episcopal, capitular, and monastic corporations, but, in Lord Selborneâs
opinion, they may also have given them to parish
churches. Hence, he thinks,
the true origin of the endowment of
parish churches with tithes
.

The decree of the Third Lateran Council, making void arbitrary
appropriations of tithes, was at first opposed by the laymen of
England, and so the practice continued. But the English
hierarchy from that time opposed the practice, and by degrees
it gradually ceased.

Pope Innocent III., in a decretal epistle which he addressed
to the Archbishop of Canterbury about
A.D.
1200, owing to the
continued arbitrary appropriation of tithes by laymen in face of
the decrees of the Third Lateran Council, enjoined the payment
of tithes to the parsons of the respective parishes. But the
epistle had no binding force on the lay subjects of this kingdom.

The arbitrary appropriation of tithes by landowners to monasteries,
although according to their rights, was contrary to canon
law.
[259]
At a national synod held at Westminster in 1125 (25
Henry I.) it was constituted that no abbot, prior, monk, or clergyman
should accept a church or tithe or any other ecclesiastical
benefice from a layman without the authority and assent of his
own bishop. The lay patrons paid no attention to this canon,
because they thought it was an ecclesiastical encroachment upon
the rights of property. It was a part of the supremacy over the
civil power which the Church was then usurping wherever she
found weak instruments. In the reigns of Richard I. and John,
however, laymenâs investitures gradually ceased. The Church became
[150]

supreme. Archbishop Anselm was a very strong supporter of
papal canons which inhibited the custom of lay investiture. The
struggle continued after his death. The practice at the present
time is, the patron nominates or presents, the bishop institutes,
and the archdeacon inducts. But before the reigns of Richard
I. and John, the lay patrons nominated, instituted, and inducted.
The bishop had no voice in the matter. The practice, as I have
already stated, was condemned and made void by the Third
Lateran Council held in 1180.

At the General Council of Lateran, held in 1215, the arbitrary
appropriation of tithes to monasteries or other ecclesiastical
corporations which were not parochial, was strongly condemned,
and the tithes were commanded to be paid in future to the
parish churches. This council therefore gave the parsons the
parochial right to tithes. It was certainly very wrong to hand
over the parochial tithes to outsiders who did no parochial work
and took no interest whatever in the parishes from which they
drew large incomes, while the parochial clergy who did the work
were most miserably remunerated. But we find that when the
parsons received the tithes they became wealthy, indolent, and
vicious. We have the trustworthy testimony of Wickliffe himself
for this statement. No man could possibly write or speak
stronger than he did against the conduct of the monks and
secular clergy of his time.

In King Johnâs reign the papal power was supreme in England,
and therefore the canon law gained strength as England became
weak, particularly after Pope Innocent III. issued his interdict
against the kingdom.

The decrees of the Council of Lateran,
A.D.
1215, had not
disturbed the then existing appropriations of tithes to monasteries,
but were directed towards the future, and made void all new
[151]

grants of tithes to monasteries after the date of this council.
The council is a landmark for the following arrangements: (1)
The tithes of parishes, which before
A.D.
1215 could have been
given by the owners of the property to any church they pleased,
either in or out of the kingdom, were henceforth to be given
only to the parsons of the parishes from which they arose. (2)
The tithes which had been appropriated to corporations outside
of the parishes, continued to be given to them. (3) The tithes
which the parsons possessed before
A.D.
1215 could not be appropriated
afterwards to any other person. Therefore the tithes which
rectors received were those which they possessed at the date of
this council, and all tithes created after
A.D.
1215.

The parish system which commenced in its germ about
A.D.

686 was completed about
A.D.
1200, thus covering a period of over
five hundred years in its development.

From the beginning of the 13th century, tithes became payable
to the parsons of the parishes by
common right
. But monasteries
and chapters had to show their title to them either by
grants
or
by
prescriptions
. We may thus trace tithes in England from their
origin, (1) as free-will offerings; (2) compulsory payment to some
religious body, and (3) compulsory payment only to the incumbents
of parishes. It is an error to state that all the tithes of England
were paid freely. I have stated enough to show that it was not so.

Tithes appropriated to monasteries were of two kindsâ(1)
Monastical, (2) Parochial. With reference to (1), the monastic
bodies performed no spiritual functions for the tithes which the
benefactors had granted them out of demesnes which had no
churches annexed. For these tithes they had distributed alms
to the sick, the poor, and stranger who called at their gates; and
said masses perpetually in their own churches for the souls of their
founders and benefactors, and those of their heirs and relatives.

[152]

As regards the second case, they received churches, with the
tithes and glebe lands annexed thereto, as a free gift from the
owners, and had therefore the cure of souls. They purchased
the advowsons of other churches, and even built churches themselves,
of which as owners they possessed the advowsons. At
first if the churches were near the monasteries, they sent members
of their community, who were in holy orders, to perform the
religious duties. But when the churches were situated at a considerable
distance, and became numerous, the monastic bodies
employed curates or vicars to perform the religious duties. These
at first received no part of the tithes as their salaries, but only a
small sum of money, just what the monks liked to give, and the
miserable sum they allowed varied from year to year as it suited
the caprices of the monks, who received all the tithes, offerings,
and oblations. In the kingâs licence, permitting the appropriation,
there was the usual condition which the monks ignored, âthat an
adequate portion be allowed the vicar out of the profits of the
church.â The wretched salaries of the curates or vicars produced
great scandal and complaints. As the curate or vicar was liable
to be dismissed at any moment by the appropriator, he was not
likely to insist too rigidly on the sufficiency of his stipend, and so
the miserable salary was continued after the passing of Richard
II.âs Act. The bishops were much to blame in this matter.
Some of them had been monks themselves from their youth;
others were anxious to be buried among the monks, or their
anniversaries kept by them. These considerations induced some,
but not all of the bishops, to favour the appropriation of churches
to monasteries. Again, the rich monasteries were able to bribe
the bishops, and even the papal curia, and they did so; they
allowed the bishops pensions out of the tithes, and even appropriated
some of their churches,
i.e.
the rectorial tithes of their
[153]

churches, to the bishopâs table, on condition that he, as bishop,
allowed them to receive churches with all their endowments from
the lay owners.
[260]

The preaching friars and John Wickliffe opened the peopleâs
eyes as to the monastic luxuries, and the poverty of the vicars
whom they employed to do their work. The age of building
monasteries and granting extravagant endowments had passed,
never again to be revived, but there was a growing tendency to
sweep all the monasteries away. The scandalous manner in
which the monastic bodies had paid the vicars induced Parliament
to pass the following Act in 1392.
[261]

â
In Appropriation of Benefices there shall be Provision
Made for the Poor and the Vicar.
â

âIn every licence from henceforth to be made in the chancery
of the appropriation of any parish church, it shall be expressly
contained and comprised that the diocesan of the place, upon the
appropriation of such churches, shall ordain, according to the
value of such churches, a convenient sum of money to be paid
and distributed yearly of the fruits and profits of the same
churches, by those that shall have the said churches in proper
use, and by their successors, to the poor parishioners of the said
churches in aid of their living and sustenance for ever; and also
that the vicar shall be well and sufficiently endowed.â

Lord Selborne remarks on this statute: âThis law had nothing
to do with tithes in particular, or with fruits and profits of any
churches not appropriated to monasteries. If there had been
then (
i.e.
in 1391) a law for a partition of tithes, as against all
rectors, giving the poor one-third, or any other definite share, no
[154]

such legislation could have been necessary; nothing would have
been wanting, except simply to
enforce that existing law
.â
[262]

These remarks are open to grave objections. The law refers
to a provision being made for the vicar as well as for the poor.
When a church was appropriated to a monastery, it simply meant
that the monastic corporation appropriated all the endowments,
lands and tithes of that church together with all oblations. The
monastic corporation placed a deputy, called a vicar, in the parish
to perform the ecclesiastical duties, and allowed him such a
wretchedly poor stipend, insufficient to keep soul and body together.
As for the poor of the parish, it is too much to expect,
as Lord Selborne remarks above, that the poor of 1391, or 500
years ago, had their legal remedy against the powerful and rich
monastic corporation in order to enforce their common law and
legal rights to one-third of the tithes. Why, in this enlightened
and advanced age, as compared with 1391, the poor are coerced
and defrauded of their rights by the wealthy, who know that they
have not the means âto enforce their rightsâ in the superior courtsâa
luxury which can only be enjoyed by those who have a good
banking account.

Lord Selborne says the law had nothing to do with tithes in
particular, and yet the provision for the vicar, namely the small
tithes, formed his main endowments. This law, no doubt, referred
to all the endowments of the vicar. The statute did not
move the monastic bodies, who had still the power of removing
at pleasure the vicar of the parish, until the Act 4 Henry IV. c.
xii. (1402) was passed. âThat from henceforth in every church
appropriated, or to be appropriated, a secular person be ordained
perpetual vicar, canonically instituted and inducted to the same,
and
convenably endowed by the discretion of the Ordinary
, to do
[155]

divine service, to inform the people and to keep hospitality
there.â What is meant by keeping hospitality? To provide for
the poor out of the endowments. Here is a list of the small
tithes:â

Sir John de Cobham, appropriated Horton Kirby Church to
Cobham Chantry. The Bishop of Rochester, when confirming
this appropriation in 1378, assigned the vicar all the oblations,
obventions, the tithe of flax, hemp, milk, butter, cheese, cattle,
calves, wool, lambs, geese, ducks, pigs, eggs, wax, honey, apples,
peas, pigeons, fisheries of ponds, rivers and lakes, fowling,
merchandizing, trade, herbage, pasture, feedings, mills; all the
herbage of the churchyard, and all other small tithes arising
within the said parish. The bishop taxed all at seven marks =
Â£4 13
s.
4
d.
per annum. The chantry was to repair the chancel
and parsonage house, but the vicar was to pay the procurations of
the archdeacon. At the dissolution of monasteries, the parsonage
and advowson were given to the Crown, who granted them away
by sale. At the present time the impropriators receive Â£848, and
Queenâs College, Oxford, Â£200 12
s.
tithe-rent charge per annum
from Horton parish, whilst the vicar receives Â£266 12
s.
from the
small tithes above stated, and has thirty-four acres of glebe. The
present patron is H. B. Rashleigh, who is also the vicar, and
his curate is C. Rashleigh. This is a good specimen parish as
regards the distribution of tithes, and also the patronage, for
Â£1,050 of the rent charge is in lay hands, and the advowson or
patronage is a marketable commodity, and now in possession of
the present vicar. It is also important to note that the vicarage
has been augmented by Queen Anneâs bounty by the purchase of
an estate at Brockhull in the same parish. We note that J. K.
Rashleigh is vicar of Luxulyan, diocese of Truro; patron, Sir C.
Rashleigh, Bart. There is an immense number of livings in
[156]

possession of incumbents, obtained either by purchase or by
family patronage.

The appropriator gave the vicar the small tithes because he
found them more difficult to collect than the great tithes.

It is unreasonable to state that an unmarried parish priest with
a free parsonage house would be allowed to enjoy all these tithes
as his own income. No, for he was to keep hospitality. The
rectors or monastic bodies, who had the great tithes, kept the
chancel of the church in repair. And up to the present time, the
owners of the great or rectorial tithes,
and not the owners of any
other church endowment
, are legally bound to keep the chancels in
good repair, and if they fall down, to build them up again. What
is this but a compliance with the original division of tithes by
which a portion was set apart for the repairs of the church. And,
as I shall show, these repairs included the whole building, but
in course of time the rectors kept the tithes and shifted this
responsibility on the shoulders of the parishioners, which led to
church rates. They did the same as regards the portion for the
poor, who were pecuniarily unable to maintain their claims in the
higher courts, to which legal remedy Lord Selborne refers.

In King Edmundâs law
[263]
the bishops were ordered to keep the
churches in repair, as the whole tithes of the parish went to
them; but in Canuteâs laws of 1018, all the parishioners were
ordered to keep their churches in repair. Canuteâs change from
the bishops to the parishioners can only be explained from the
fact that the dilapidated condition of the churches, the result
of the Danish invasions, and a general destruction of property
throughout the country, made the funds at the bishopsâ disposal
insufficient for the purpose, and so the burden was thrown
generally upon the inhabitants. But when the country increased
[157]

in riches and prosperity, the liability for the repairs of the chancel
was again, and is still, placed on the owners of the great or
rectorial tithes.

The following canon 4 is taken from the provincial constitutions
of John Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury, made in a
provincial council in London, 10th of October, 1342.

âWhereas ecclesiastical men are entrusted with dispensing of
tithes and other things belonging to the church,
that the poor by
their prudent management may not be defrauded
; yet the religious
of our province having churches appropriate, do so apply
the fruits of them to their own use,
as to give nothing in charity to
the poor parishioners
, being regenerate sons of the churches,
to
whom they are bound to do this
more than to strangers; by which
means such as owe tithes and ecclesiastical dues become not only
indevout, but invaders, destroyers and disturbers, to the danger
of their own souls and theirs, and to the scandal of many; therefore
with the approbation of this sacred council, we ordain that
the said religious, having ecclesiastical benefices appropriate, be
compelled by the bishops every year to distribute to the poor
parishioners a certain portion of their benefices, in alms to be
moderated at the discretion of the bishops in proportion to the
value of such benefices, under pain of sequestration of the fruits
and profits thereof, till they yield a reasonable obedience in the
premisses.â
[264]

The inference to be drawn from this canon, and from the subsequent
statute of 15 Richard II. c. vi. (1391), is that the poor
had a claim on the tithes and other endowments; and this claim
is admitted by Bishop Stubbs. But Lord Selborne, Fuller, and
others, stoutly deny this claim. No doubt, the canon and Act
refer to appropriated churches, when the avaricious monks retained
[158]

all the tithes to their own use. But the inference above is
generally applicable to all tithes. If not, what right had a provincial
synod to make a canon, compelling appropriators who had
neglected the poor to distribute to the poor, under the severe
penalty of sequestration, a portion of the appropriated property?
and almost all this property, unquestionably, consisted of tithes.

The vicar-perpetual of Henry IV.âs Act must not be confounded
with the later âperpetual curate,â who by a recent Act is
now styled âvicar.â The former is endowed with the small or
vicarial tithes; the latter is not so endowed.

The most important parts of Henry IV.âs Act are, (1) permanently
endowing the vicar, which, as regards tithes, equalled
one-third part; and (2) giving the vicar as permanent a position
in the parish as the rector.
[265]
But the autocratic freehold tenure
has been grossly abused. This abuse, within the past thirty years,
has much increased, owing to the lack of discipline and inability
of the bishops to correct insubordinate and law-breaking parsons.

There is no parochial council to check the conduct and
actions of the autocratic endowed incumbent. He snaps his
fingers at the parishioners, bishop, archdeacon, rural dean, or any
other episcopal officer. He is the bishop of his own parish.
His freehold tenure and endowments make him independent and
absolute master for life within his parochial limits.

[159]

CHAPTER XIV.

INFEUDATIONSâEXEMPTIONS FROM PAYMENT OF TITHES.

Infeudations are the conveyances of the perpetual right of tithes
to laymen.

The Third Council of Lateran, held in
A.D.
1180, was the first
to forbid infeudations. Such conveyances, although frequent on
the Continent, were not so in England until the general dissolution
of monasteries. Very little of the lands, tenements, and
tithes in possession of the alien priories was given away or sold
to laymen when Parliament had at various times alienated the
same. The properties were bestowed on other monasteries and
on colleges for religious and educational purposes. In the latter
case, the owners were clergymen. This was not so with the
enormous properties of the dissolved monasteries and chantries
which Parliament had given to Henry VIII. and Edward VI.
The amount of confiscated property was about Â£250,000 per
annum. If this vast property had been placed under the
management of Commissioners, it would realize an annual income
at the present time, of eight and a half millions, quite
sufficient to defray all the expenses which are now paid by the
ratepayers for the maintenance of the poor in England and
Wales.

I shall deal here only with the tithes, which form but a small
part of the immense properties which were then confiscated, and
which Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Elizabeth lavishly bestowed
on the numerous poor hungry court favourites and court flunkeys,
who were the ancestors of many who are now high in the peerage.
[160]

The War of the Roses had swept away the ancient nobility of
England, and in their places sprang up a crowd of poor hungry
men who surrounded Henry VIII. and his children. Nothing
could possibly turn out more opportune for them than the confiscation
of the vast monastic properties which Parliament
handed over to Henry VIII. and Edward VI. to do with them
as they thought proper. What could possibly be better for these
poor court sycophants? We have only to open out the county
histories of the country, and there we shall find very sad
accounts of the manner in which the vast monastic estates had
been given away to the ancestors of some of the aristocracy.
Archbishops, bishops, and chapters had to surrender to the Crown
numerous manors which had been given by Anglo-Saxon kings
to their predecessors out of folcland which was the national property
of the Anglo-Saxons. These manors were afterwards given
away by the Crown to these poor hungry court favourites, and
thus formed the title-deeds of many aristocratic families who
now carry high heads in the country.

The 32 Henry VIII. c. viii. gave the king power (1) to grant
the properties to whom he wished; (2) that such persons should
be free from the payment of tithes if such lands had been
exempted previous to the dissolution; and (3) that the lay-owners
of monastic lands could claim tithes from them. So,
then, laymen who claimed tithes were called
impropriators
, because
they were
improper
persons to receive them. But the
same may have been said of the lay-monks, nuns, military orders,
etc., who had at one time been in the receipt of tithes.

The total tithe-rent charge gross is Â£4,053,985; of this, lay
impropriators receive Â£962,290, or a little less than one-fourth.
Therefore we may take it as a general statement that laymen
receive about one-fourth of the tithes. To this must be added
[161]

the large estates which are tithe-free, and from which enhanced
rents are received.

Exemption from Paying Tithes by Religious Houses.

All abbots, priors, and other heads of monasteries had originally
paid tithes. But Pope Paschal II. exempted generally
all the
religiosi
from tithes on lands which were under their own
management. About
A.D.
1160, Pope Adrian IV. limited this
exemption to the Templars, Hospitallers, and Cistercians, who
alone were exempted from paying tithes for lands which were
then, but not afterwards, acquired under their own immediate
management. The privilege did not extend to lands let to
farmers, but only to those which they occupied before the
Council of Lateran
A.D.
1215, which confirmed the above exemptions.
A fourth orderâthe Premonstratensianâwas added
by Pope Innocent III. These were called the four privileged
orders. After the passing of the Mortmain Act, which gave a
terrible blow to the monastic bodies, the privileged order of
Cistercians purchased bulls of exemption from paying tithes for
their lands, tenements, and possessions let to farmers, and also
for the lands which they acquired since 1215. These bulls had
the force of law in the English canon law, and were allowed in
actions for tithes. This objectionable mode of purchasing bulls
of exemption was put a stop to in 1400 by 2 Henry IV. c. iv.
which subjected the purchaser to premunire.
[266]
The Statute of
Premunire was passed in 1393 (16 Richard II. c. v.) against
âProcuring at Rome or elsewhere, any translations, processes,
excommunications, bulls, instruments, or other things which
touch the king, against him, his crown and realm, and all persons
[162]

aiding or assisting therein shall be put out of the kingâs protection,
their lands and goods forfeited to the kingâs use, and
they shall be attached by their bodies to answer to the king
and his council, or process
prÃ¦munire facias
shall be made out
against them, as in any other cases of provisors.â

The lands of the four privileged orders which were thus
exempted from paying tithes, are exempted up to the present
day, because at the dissolution of the monasteries, the 31
Henry VIII. c. xiii., provided that all lands held by the monasteries,
and exempted from tithes, should also be exempted when
vested in the Crown, and the same Act extended the exemption
to all those who should become possessors of such Crown property.
There is also 2 Edward VI. c. xiii. This explains the
fact that some of the present holders of monastic property pay
no tithes; some do; and others are tithe-owners.

[163]

CHAPTER XV.

MONASTERIES.

In giving a history of tithes, it is absolutely necessary to give
a brief account of the monasteries and monastic property in
England.

Immediately after Augustine came to England, the age of building
monasteries commenced. Before his arrival there were about
twenty-one monastic establishments in the island not of the Benedictine
order. The first British monastery, properly so-called,
was established at Glastonbury, by St. Patrick, about
A.D.
433.
Previous to his arrival there was a sort of hermitage there, but
when he came he formed the hermits into a society, framed
monastic rules for their guidance, and made himself their abbot.

A monastery was a place where people of both sexes lived
alone, secluded from the common employment of the world
for sacred duties and devotion. Monk, A.-S.
munuc
, through
the Latin
monachus
, Greek Î¼Î¿Î½Î±ÏÏÏ = solitary. Nun, Latin

nonna
. The British monks and nuns married until the Benedictine
rule was rigidly enforced by King Edgar and Archbishop
Dunstan in the tenth century. The religious houses may be
classified thusâcathedral churches, abbeys, and priories. There
were four chief officers in the abbeys and prioriesâ(1) the
chamberlain, who provided the monksâ clothing; (2) the cellarer
catered for them; (3) the treasurer or bursar collected their
rents and other revenue, and paid all their expenses; and (4)
[164]

the sacrista or sexton took charge of the buildings and church,
and all the utensils, books, pictures, etc., in them.

The Benedictine monks were originally laymen, working in
a very praiseworthy manner with their hands to support themselves.
Some were ordained as the needs of the monastery
required, and although ordained, they were still monks, and
resided within the walls of their convent. The monastic life had
taken a great hold as early as the seventh century upon the Anglo-Saxon
kings and nobles. But we must look to the Norman period
for the full development of monastic institutions in this country.
The mode of life and dress of the monks and nuns fascinated
the Anglo-Saxons, and struck them with awe. The monasteries
were richly endowed with estates. They also monopolized the
rich mortuary fees. The treasures of the Anglo-Saxon kings,
of their families, and of wealthy laymen, were poured into the
monasteries. But the time was fast approaching when all those
costly buildings, rich treasures, and priceless libraries, were to
be swept away and destroyed by foreign savage hordes. The
Danes made their first appearance in England
A.D.
787. They
were implacable enemies of the Christian religion. Between

A.D.
858 and 878 they rifled and burnt the British monasteries.
Plunder was always their game, and therefore they first attacked
the monasteries because they were defenceless, and contained
immense wealth. This vandalism was disastrous to the nation,
because it dried up the only channel of learning and education
in the land, and destroyed the only existing libraries. The
monasteries were the treasure-houses for charters and privileges
granted by kings and nobles from time to time, which were
deposited for safety in these sanctuaries. A carefully-written
history of the country was also kept in many of the monastic
libraries. The destruction of the monasteries by the Danes,
[165]

and the dispersion of their inmates among the villages, gave
a powerful impetus to the erection of more parish churches; for,
after the departure of the Vandals, it was much cheaper to build
a wooden church than to rebuild a monastery. The monastic
churches served, up to the time of their destruction, as the
parochial churches in many places. When these were destroyed,
the nobility, wealthy landowners and bishops, exerted themselves
to supply not only the deficiencies, but to increase the number
of parish churches. The inmates of the monasteries scattered
through the villages took, no doubt, an active part in church-building.

The monasteries remained in ruins until the reign of King
Edgar, who was a great supporter of the Church, and seemed
to be under the complete control of Archbishop Dunstanâthe
first episcopal pluralistâthe originator of a practice, contrary
to the primitive custom of the Church, which, in subsequent
centuries, was carried to a most scandalous extent. Wolsey,
in more modern times, held several bishoprics at the same
time, and yet one of his great objects was the reformation of
the Church. But he should have commenced at home. The
ostensible reason assigned in Dunstanâs time for his conduct,
was that there was a dearth of suitable men for the episcopal
appointments; but the real cause was, as in the case of Bishop
Oswald, to carry out the scheme for removing the seculars and
bringing the monks into the cathedral churches. In Wolseyâs
time the same ostensible reason could not be urged. But the
revenues of a multiplicity of bishoprics were necessary to maintain
his pride and extravagant living, and to build palaces, which
he presented to an ungrateful king.

The leading church ideas of King Edgar during his reign
were, (1) to rebuild the monasteries which lay in ruins, and
[166]

(2) to drive the married clergy out of the convents, replacing
them by monks. Dunstan, Athelwold of Winchester, and
Oswald of Worcester (afterwards of York), were the kingâs
chief agents in carrying out his schemes. It does not appear
that any of the other bishops had taken an active share in the
work. Before King Edgarâs reign, the monasteries were filled
with secular clergymen, who did duty outside their monasteries.

The English monks passed through three reformations: (1)
At the Council of Cloveshoe,
A.D.
747, where no reference was
made to Benedictâs rule, although it had been framed in 529 and
approved of by the Pope in 595. (2) At the Council of Winchester,

A.D.
965, where Benedictâs rule was prominently set forth
for general adoption. The monks were henceforth to confine
themselves to their cloisters, to have no parochial cure of souls,
and to adopt celibacy. These facts alone prove that the discipline
of the Roman Church on the Continent, was imported into
the English Church long before the Norman Conquest. Some
writers, in treating of tithes and other church endowments, strive
to show that the Church of England, before the Conquest, had
not the same doctrines as the Roman Church. The object of
this line of erroneous argument is to show that the endowments
of the Church of England were given to her when her doctrines
were different from those of the Church of Rome. The system of
doctrinal development which was going on in the Roman Church
on the Continent, was introduced and adopted in the Church of
England by her hierarchy and priests. (3) At the Council of
London,
A.D.
1075, where monks were enjoined to adhere more
strictly to the rule of Benedict.

As I have stated above, before King Edgarâs reign the monasteries
were convents of secular married clergy, whose children
kept up a monopoly of all the valuable appointments in the
[167]

establishments. The result was certainly most pernicious to
church and people. The clergy grew more and more indolent
and illiterate, and their thoughts were entirely absorbed in the
worldly affairs of their families, to the neglect of their spiritual
duties. Although the monks had many faults, yet the English
nation owes them a large debt of gratitude. They were better
educated than the secular clergy; were more refined, and were
therefore better able to raise the standard of civilization in the
country. That is what the married clergy could not then have
done. The monasteries were the only schools where the children
of the kings, nobility and gentry could be educated. King
Edward the Confessor received his early training in the monastery
of Ely. Their schools formed models for our most ancient
universities. The monasteries were like so many burning torches
in the midst of darkness and ignorance, and were the only
sources which could then supply men intellectually capable of
occupying episcopal positions. Some of the noblest benefactors
to the Church were bishops taken from the cloisters.

The Norman Conquest.

At the time of the Conquest, there were in England about 130
monasteries and cathedral churches, possessing about one-twelfth
of the land. There were then nineteen bishoprics in England
and Wales exclusive of the Isle of Man. Most of the Saxon
bishops and abbots were replaced by Normans. The change
was good. Some writers censure the Norman rulers for the
change. But a better educated and more refined class of men
had taken their places. A careful study of their lives and acts,
as recorded in the âMonasticon,â will corroborate my statement.

All the property given to the religious houses in Anglo-Saxon
[168]

times, was held in common. But the Norman bishops changed
this arrangement in the cathedral churches. They divided the
property and assigned to the canons what revenues they thought
fit, and kept the rest of the church lands for their own personal
use. These bishops had also initiated another innovation in the
distribution of the cathedral revenues, which continued until 1840.
They gave separate endowments of lands or tithes or both to the
deans, priors, chancellors, treasurers, precentors, vicars choral,
archdeacons, and prebendaries, for their own personal use, and
quite separate from the common fund, of which the four principal
officers had also their shares. Some of the Norman bishops
purchased landed estates out of their own episcopal revenues,
which they divided into prebends, and endowed prebendaries
with them; other bishops divided some of the episcopal estates
into prebends. Landed estates were also given by private donors
which formed new prebendal endowments. These kind of endowments
ceased about the thirteenth century. By the Cathedral
Act of 1840, all the separate estates, amounting to about Â£60,000
per annum, were vested in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for
the Common Fund.

At the time of the Conquest, the nineteen cathedral churches
were composed of secular canons, except two, viz., Winchester
and Worcester, which were composed of Benedictine monks.
These two were subsequently increased to eight, viz., Canterbury,
Durham, Carlisle, Ely, Norwich, and Rochester, and so
continued until the general dissolution of monasteries, when they
were formed into secular chapters by changing the priors into
deans, and chapters into canons. The fact that there were only
two conventual chapters at the time of the Conquest, indicates
that the seculars more than held their own in face of the powerful
patronage and protection of King Edgar and Archbishop
[169]

Dunstan. It is doubtful whether this had been an improvement.
The ranks of the episcopal order, as I have hitherto stated, were
generally recruited from the monks, because competent men
could not be found elsewhere. The magnificent and artistic
cathedrals of this country, had been designed and built by men
connected with the monkish order. There is Durham, by
William de Carilepho, formerly a Norman abbot; Ely, by its last
abbots; Gloucester, by its abbots; Rochester, by Bishop Gundulf,
a monk; Bishop Wacelin, in 1070, commenced to rebuild
Winchester, and William of Wickham finished it; Bishop Wolstan
laid the foundation of Worcester in 1084, etc.

The following table of monasteries, taken from Bishop Tannerâs
âNotitia Monastica,â published in 1695, will give an idea
of the powerful impetus which the Norman Conquest had given
to their erection in this country.

Alien Monasteries.

The governing bodies of the foreign or alien monasteries, to
which landed estates, tenements, tithes, churches, etc., in England
were granted, had built priories in convenient parts of
England on their manors, and sent monks from their own monasteries
to occupy them. The principal duties which these monks
performed, were to collect the revenues from the properties, and
transmit the money to the heads of the foreign monasteries. In
fact they were their resident agents in this country. It is stated
that not less than Â£2,000 a year, a sum equal to Â£60,000 at
the present time, was forwarded, in the reign of Edward III., to
Cluny, in France, by the twenty-six Cluniac priories in England.
King Edward I., in his wars with France, was the first to put a
stop to the transmission of money from the alien priories in
England to the heads of the foreign monasteries in France. They
were dissolved by Henry V. and Henry VI.

Owing to the pomp and luxuries of the hierarchy and monastic
bodies, a religious revolutionary wave passed over this country
in the thirteenth century. The main indications were, (1) the
Lateran Council in 1215; (2) the appearance in England in 1217
of the Dominican, and in 1224 of the Franciscan preaching
friars; (3) the Mortmain Act of 1279. The religious mania for
building and richly endowing monasteries commenced to decline
in Edward I.âs reign. The Franciscan order was founded in
A.D.

1208, and the Dominican in 1215. Pope Innocent III. approved
of both orders in 1215. The ruling idea of these mendicant
friars was the elevation of poverty to a virtue; but, strange to
say, that before they were in existence many years they became
the richest orders in Christendom. Wherever they were located
they became the strongest supporters of the papacy, and for two
[171]

hundred years members of these orders occupied the papal
throne.

The friars in England, by their powerful and zealous preaching,
had become very popular, to the great loss of the parochial clergy,
who were steeped in ignorance and indolence. In their sermons
and pamphlets, the friars strongly advised the people to pay no
tithes to the parsons; that tithes were but alms, and may be
given to any charitable use, and that the parsons had no parochial
rights to them. The result was that the people gave the
tithes to the friars, both personal and predial, as alms. The
parish priests seriously felt the diminution of their revenues.
Convocation, of course, moved vigorously in the matter.
[267]

The begging friars knew how to draw water to their own
fountains, and succeeded well. But âHoly Churchâ proved
too powerful for them. They were pronounced
heretics
for
preaching against the payment of tithes to the parsons, and for
receiving the parsonsâ tithes themselves. But those cunning,
crafty friars were only changing the course of the âalmsâ into
their own channel. Apostolic poverty was written high on their
banners, and yet they soon surpassed the parsons in luxury and
indolence.

A truly sincere and honest Englishman then appeared on the
scene. John Wickliffe, rector of Lutterworth, who died
A.D.

1384, preached the same views about tithes as the friars did. He
strongly asserted that tithes were only alms, and may be given
for any religious use, or retained, according to the will of the
donor. The Church, of course, considered his statement rank
heresy, and a council of ecclesiastics condemned his opinions as
heretical. The cry, âthe Church in danger,â was then heard as
loudly as in our own times whenever any salutary changes for her
[172]

improvement have been suggested, or when scandals and abuses
are attempted to be removed. The most important and latest
example occurred in 1840, when the so-called Cathedral Act was
passed.
[268]
Oxford and Cambridge Universities petitioned Parliament
against this Act. Oxford took the lead and strongly
protested against all church reforms and improvements originating
within the Church (which our leading statesmen then advocated)
by means of a better and an equal distribution of church
revenues. Oxford urged in 1840 that a large State grant should
be made to the Church in order to supply the existing deficiencies
of religious instruction. This was simply an impertinent application
for State aid when the revenues of the Church were wasted
in a disgraceful manner by her own officers. The twenty-six
archbishops and bishops appointed before 1836, had received five
and a half millions of money from their
episcopal
revenues alone.
Counsel were actually engaged, who appeared at the bar of the
House of Lords to oppose the Cathedral Act of 1840, which has
turned out one of the most beneficial acts for the amelioration of
the Church which our leading statesmen could then devise. Sir
R. Inglis, M.P. for Oxford, called the Bishops Act of 1836 and
the Cathedral Act of 1840, âConfiscations which were leading to
the utter destruction of the Church of England.â Let us compare
this statement with that made in Parliament in 1882 by Sir John
Mowbray, who now represents the same constituency. âThe
Ecclesiastical Commissioners,â said Sir John, âaugmented the
value of livings in upwards of 4,700 out of 15,000 parishes into
which England and Wales are divided. From 1836 to 1882 they
added Â£19,000,000 to the property of the Church, besides eliciting
Â£4,000,000 from private sources in the shape of contributions,
[173]

making a total of Â£23,000,000, which represents an annual
income of Â£690,000.â
[269]

In the 43rd Report (1891) of the Commissioners, the following
statement appears: âDuring a period of fifty years, from 1840
(when the Common Fund was first created) to 31st October,
1890, the Commissioners have augmented and endowed upwards
of 5,700 benefices with annual payments charged on the fund,
or by the annexations of lands, tithes, etc., or by the grant of
capital sums for the erection of parsonage houses, etc., to the
value of about Â£781,400 per annum, in perpetuity, equivalent to
a capital sum of about Â£23,469,000. The value of benefactions
from private sources, of lands, tithes, stock, cash, etc., secured to
various benefices, and met for the most part by grants from the
Commissioners, exceeds Â£164,340 per annum in perpetuity, equivalent
to a permanent increase of endowment of say Â£4,930,000,
apart from a sum of about Â£26,000 per annum, contributed by
benefactors to meet the Commissionersâ grants for curates in
mining districts. Thus the total increase in the incomes of benefices
made by the Commissioners or resulting from the benefactions
accepted, and met by them, exceeds Â£971,700 per annum, and
may be taken to represent a capital sum of about Â£29,179,000.â
[270]

The foregoing statement is the best proof as to the absurd and
short-sighted remarks of Sir. R. Inglis and his followers in 1840.
The net income of the Common Fund is now over one million per
annum. It has taken more than 125 Acts of Parliament directly
and indirectly relating to the Church, and some thousands of
Orders in Council to drag the State Church out of the sink of
abuses in which it was found in 1832 when the first Reform Act
was passed.

[174]

There were also grave and serious abuses in the Church in
Wickliffeâs days. He was as hostile to the Popeâs supremacy as
he was to the compulsory payment of tithes. He held that kings
were superior to popes, and therefore that appeals from spiritual
to temporal tribunals were just, right, and lawful. Time proved
that his opinion on this point was correct. He must have been
a man of great boldness to question in those days the supremacy
of the popes. We, living in the end of the nineteenth century,
can take a historical survey of the various changes and struggles
which occurred, as regards the popesâ supremacy, since Wickliffeâs
time. He utterly detested the monks for their luxurious and
worldly habits. The parochial clergy also did not escape his
lash. He preferred the good old custom of one paying oneâs
tithes, according to oneâs own free-will, to good and godly men,
who were able to preach the gospel; and he condemned in his
complaint to King Richard II. and his Parliament, the practice
of compelling people to pay tithes.
[271]

If we examine the charters which appropriated tithes to monasteries,
we shall find that the tithes are stated therein to be given
as
alms in perpetuity
. As regards tithes given to rectors and
vicars of parishes, the usual style of the grant ran thus: âThe
tithes were granted as
free, pure, and perpetual alms for ever
.â
The words in italics are most remarkable. Richard de Clare,
Earl of Herts, gave the rectorial tithes of Brenchley and Yalding,
in Kent, to Tunbridge Priory
in pure and perpetual alms
. Robert
de Crevequer, founder of Leeds Abbey about 1137, gave the
canons there
in free and perpetual alms
, all the churches on his
estates, with their glebe lands, tithes, and advowsons. King John
had appropriated the rectory of Bapchild, in Kent, to the Dean
and Chapter of Chichester, on the recommendation of the Bishop
[175]

of Chichester, to be held
in free, pure, and perpetual alms
. The
chapter received Â£437 a year tithe-rent charge; vicar, Â£167.
William de Auberville, in 1192, gave to the priory of West Langdon
the rectories of Oxney and of St. Maryâs, Liddon,
in pure and
perpetual alms
.
[272]
I have given here only a few examples to show
how the tithes had been granted by the owners to parishes and
monasteries. Yet in the face of these grants, episcopal, cathedral
and parochial, incumbents claim the tithes as their own exclusive
property. But Wickliffe and the friars were much better judges
of the facts than church defenders at the present time. They
truly asserted that the tithes were by custom originally given as
alms or free-will offerings without any compulsion whatsoever; and
Wickliffe gave some additional information, viz., that they were
given only to good and godly men who were able to preach the
gospel. The fact that the landowners had given their tithes for
any religious use to monks who were mostly laymen, to nuns, to
the religious military orders, to foreign monasteries, I say that this
proves to demonstration that tithes were not due by divine or
legal right to the evangelical priesthood; that tithes were property
which could have been and were disposed of, like any other kind
of property, to whatever use the benefactor or owner wished.
But by clerical pressure at home, by threats of anathemas and
excommunications, by the power of the confessional box, and by
ecclesiastical pressure from Rome, the English landowners, and
also those who paid personal tithes, had slowly come round to
the practice of paying them to the parochial clergy not as their
exclusive income, but as trustees reserving an adequate portion of
the tithes for their own personal use, and dividing the remainder
among the poor and stranger, and for repairing the church. But
the trustees appropriated all the tithes to their own personal use,
[176]

and relieved the poor and repaired the church out of alms and
contributions of the parishioners. These are the real facts of
this disgraceful case of clerical trustees misappropriating the tithes
to their own personal use, and this misappropriation has been
going on at least 500 years, which gives them a prescriptive right
to all the tithes. I have already sketched out how this misappropriation
commenced, and the inability of the poor to obtain redress.

The following extract, taken from one of the charters granting
tithes to monasteries, indicates how tithes were given:â

Charter of Earl Randulph Gernons of Chester to the Monastery of Chester.

âUniversitati vestrÃ¦ notum facio me dedisse
in elemosina in
perpetuum
Deo et S. MariÃ¦ ecclesiÃ¦ S. WerburgÃ¦ et Rudulpho
abbati et conventui dictÃ¦ ecclesiÃ¦ pro salute animÃ¦ Hugonis
comitis, prÃ¦dictÃ¦ ecclesiÃ¦ fundatoris ac pro salute animÃ¦ Randulphi
comitis patris mei, et antecessorum meorum, et pro salute
animÃ¦ meÃ¦, et Christianorum omnium, omnem decimam integriter
et plenariÃ¨ omnium reddituum meorum civitatis CestriÃ¦,â etc.
[273]

This earl died in
A.D.
1153. Earl Hugh Lupus, the refounder,
who died in 1101, granted many manors, churches, and tithes, as

alms in perpetuity
. All the early parochial records are lost, and
therefore in dealing with the old parishes we are at a great disadvantage.
It is not so with the monasteries. The monastic
bodies, free from Danish invasions, had carefully preserved all
their charters of grants, because they had often to produce their
title deeds when claims were made by others to some of the property
which they possessed, and also when some of their property
had been lost or taken from them by force or by kings.
It was not so with regard to lands and tithes held by parochial
incumbents.

[177]

CHAPTER XVI.

THE DISSOLUTION OF MONASTERIES.

What precedents had Henry VIII. to guide him in dissolving
the monasteries?

(1) Edward I., in
A.D.
1295, seized the property of the alien
priories.

(2) In 1324 (17 Edward II.) the lands and tenements held in
England by the Templars were, by Act of Parliament, seized
and transferred to the Knights Hospitallers, when the services
of the former were no longer required for purposes for which the
property had been assigned to them.

(3) Edward III., in 1337, seized the alien priories, and let out
the lands and tenements, until there was peace with France in
1361. The most valuable of them were naturalized, and thus
became free from the yoke of any foreign monastery, and could
elect their own priors.

(4) Richard II. bestowed on the Carthusians several of the
smaller alien priories which Edward III. had seized.

(5) In the reign of Henry IV. the House of Commons suggested,
in 1404, that the clergy, including the
religiosi
, should be
deprived of all their temporalities, in order to furnish funds for
the defence of the kingdom and for the maintenance of a large
army. A similar proposal was made in 1410, but the king,
directly influenced by the Archbishop of Canterbury, would not
listen to the suggestions. These facts indicate the growing
[178]

unpopularity of the Church even at that early period of the life
of the House of Commons. The Statute of Mortmain in 1279,
the Statutes of Provisors in 1351 (25 Edward III. c. vi.), and
1353 (27 Edward III.), the Statute of Premunire in 1393, are
all so many previous illustrations of the growing hostile feeling
of Parliament towards the Church, monastic establishments, and
the pope of Rome.

(6) In the reign of Henry V. another attack was made upon
the property of the Church by the Parliament which met in 1415,
but the tact of the Archbishop of Canterbury on this occasion,
as well as in 1404 and 1410, saved the property. The Parliament
granted the King, however, all the property of the alien priories,
except those which were free and could elect their own priors.
Henry V. built and endowed six colleges and three religious
houses, principally out of the property of the suppressed priories.

(7) Henry VI. founded and endowed Eton College and Kingâs
College, Cambridge, out of the same suppressed property.

(8) Cardinal Wolsey, with the approval of King Henry VIII.
and the Pope, suppressed over twenty small religious houses in

A.D.
1523, in order to furnish funds to build and endow his
collegeâCardinal College, now Christ Church, Oxfordâthe
richest in that University.

These are instructive and interesting facts. Large monastic endowments
were devoted to building and richly endowing colleges
and schools for the sons of the wealthy men of the country.
In the Appendices will be found a complete account of the gross
amounts of tithe-rent charges which the colleges of Oxford and
Cambridge, and some of the public schools receive. I should also
gladly give the monastic manors and glebe lands, quite separate
from the vicarial glebe lands, which these colleges and schools
also received, but I have not the information. But I supply
[179]

the large patronage they have at their disposal. And I may
state that of all Church patronage, the most objectionable is
collegiate and public school patronage. Broken-down old dons,
fellows, and teachers of schools, men full of eccentricities, totally
unfit for parish work, are pensioned off with college livings,
which are generally well endowed with glebe lands and tithes,
and each with a rural population of a few hundreds. Here they
end their days in ease and quietness, after giving the best and
most active part of their lives to tutorial work in their respective
colleges and schools. The wealthy parochial endowments of the
collegiate and scholastic livings are out of all proportion to the
population and
parish work
, which in their cases is
nil
. In
purchasing advowsons, the colleges select country parishes with
large endowments, small areas, and small populations.

I have stated eight cases for Henry VIII.âs guidance in dissolving
the monasteries. I shall now state his own action in the
matter.

In 1533 (24 Henry VIII. c. xii.) the Statute for the Restraint
of Appeals to Rome was passed. In 1534 Parliament made him
âSupreme head of the Church of England.â He therefore took
the Popeâs place, and received the firstfruits and tenths. In
1535 Commissioners were appointed to take the value of all
ecclesiastical benefices, in order to settle the firstfruits and
tenths. In 1536 the valuation was completed. In 1535, by
27 Henry VIII. c. xx., for tithes to be paid throughout the realm.
In 1536 (28 Henry VIII. c. xvi.), the power of the Pope over
tithes in England was finally extinguished. The monks viewed
the Kingâs conduct in taking the Popeâs place with the most
bitter hostility. They constantly used their influence to excite
the feelings of the people against the King. Henry knew all this,
and that he could never alienate them from the Pope. The subsequent
[180]

conduct of the King and his ministers was guided more
by political expediency than on religious or moral grounds.
There was but one course open to the King, and that was to
dissolve all the religious houses. It was a bold, arduous, and
dangerous step. The morality of these houses was the only
vulnerable point in which he thought he could successfully carry
out his plan. He first obtained an Act of Parliament empowering
him âto visit, order, and reform all errors and abuses in religion.â
This was the lever which Henryâs agents used to expose every
real and imaginary immoral act, and thus create hostility in the
minds of the people against them. A Royal Commission was
issued in 1535 with unlimited power to visit the monasteries. In
1536 the report was finished. But the original was destroyed in
Queen Maryâs reign. We must be careful as to what credence
should be given to evidence taken down and reported upon by
such Commissioners as Leigh and Leyton, who had not scrupled
to suborn witnesses. An Act was passed in 1536 (27 Henry VIII.
c. xxviii.), which dissolved every monastery with a revenue of less
than Â£200 per annum, and transferred to the King all the monasteries,
priories, and other religious houses, all the sites, circuits,
churches, chapels, advowsons, patronage, manors, granges, lands,
hereditaments, tithes, pensions, annuities, rights, etc., which
belonged to such monasteries; and that âThe king shall have
them in as large and ample a manner as the governors of those
houses possessed them. That he was to have and to hold them,
his heirs and assigns, to do and use therewith his and their own
wills, to the pleasure of God and to the honour and profit of this
realm.â And the Act further states that âThose who take the
above property from the king shall have, hold, and enjoy the
same
in like manner, form, and condition as before the Act of
Dissolution
.â Those who took the property were therefore subject
[181]

to the same limitations, privileges, and burdens as the

religiosi
were. By this Act, 376 houses were dissolved and their
properties vested in the Crown. The King received Â£32,000
per annum from the estates, and also he received jewels and
personal effects valued at Â£100,000. He gave small pensions
to some abbots, priors, and monks; others he transferred to
larger monasteries. The houses were stripped of their lead, bells,
glass, and materials, which were sold to the neighbouring gentry.

The conditions upon which all the vast monastic property was
given by Parliament to the King were, âThat they were to be
used to the pleasure of God and to the honour and profit of this
realm.â Did Henry VIII. or his successors carry out these
conditions? They certainly did not. The property of the
alien priories was insignificantly small as compared with the
enormous properties which Parliament granted to Henry VIII.
But there was this distinction between them. Almost all the
former properties were devoted to religious and educational
purposes. Laymen received little or nothing. But the case was
very different with Henry VIII.âs confiscations. The courtiers
and favourites were most eager to share, and did obtain, monastic
estates and tithes, and also episcopal and capitular landed estates,
which some of their successors still hold, others sold them, and
thus much of the property has been handed down to the present
time through a long line of purchasers.

Henry VIII. intended to create twenty-one new bishoprics,
and out of the proceeds of the monastic properties to suitably
endow them. But he created and endowed only six. The
courtiers and favourites of Henry, Edward, and Elizabeth, who
received inferior monastic lands, induced these sovereigns to
make certain of the archbishops, bishops, and chapters exchange
their good lands for the inferior lands of the courtiers and favourites,
[182]

and also to exchange impropriated tithes for lands of equal
value belonging to episcopal and capitular corporations. These
exchanges were very numerous in the reigns of Edward and
Elizabeth. Hasted, in his âHistory of Kent,â makes the following
remark, âCranmer observing that his stately palaces excited
the envy of the courtiers,
passed them away with their estates to
the King
.â For example, Otford Palace and its beautiful parks.
Archbishop Warham spent Â£33,000, an enormous sum in those
days, in rebuilding the palace. Cranmer, in 1538, was ordered
to surrender the palace and the manor of Otford and Sergeants
Otford to Henry VIII. Edward VI. granted the Little Park of
Otford on lease to Sir Henry Sidney. Elizabeth granted Sergeants
Otford and the Little Park on lease to Sir Robert Sidney. James
I. granted the palace and Greater Park to Sir Thomas Smith.
Edward VI. granted the parsonage and advowson of Shoreham
with the Chapel of Otford to Sir Anthony Denny, who exchanged
them with the Dean and Chapter of Westminster for the advowson
of Cheshunt in Herts. The Chapter had Â£702, tithe rent
charge from Otford; there was no vicar; and Â£806 10
s.
from
Shoreham; total Â£1,508 16
s.

Hasted says of Knole manor and manor house: âCranmer
observing
murmurings among the hungry courtiers of the archbishopâs
palaces
, compounded with Henry VIII. to give up the
best and richest manors; therefore, in 1538, Cranmer gave to
the King the manors of Otford, Wrotham, Bexley, Northflete,
Maidstone, Knole, Sergeants Otford, Sevenoke, Shoreham,
Chevening, Panters, and Brytains, with their appurtenances.â
Here were twelve manors given in one swoop to satisfy Henry
VIII.âs âhungry courtiers,â who were âmurmuringâ for the spoils.
The reader will have to consult Hastedâs âKent,â to know the
courtiers and favourites to whom these manors were granted.

[183]

An Act was passed, 1 Elizabeth c. xix., which authorized the
Queen to take in her hands, on the voidance of any bishopric,
so much of the lands belonging to it as should be equal in
value to the monastic confiscated rectorial tithes belonging to
the Crown in that diocese, and to exchange such tithes for lands.
Some of these lands were then given to her ministers and
favourites, some were kept by the Crown, and others sold to
furnish funds for national purposes, so as to prevent application
to Parliament for money. It was in this manner that bishops
and cathedral chapters lost so much landed property which the
Crown granted as above stated, and the court favourites, soon
after they received the grants, sold the estates and parsonages
to the highest purchaser. Here then were landed estates, with
endowments and advowsons of the churches belonging to such
estates
freely
granted away. Lord Cobhamâs to the Cecils, for
instance, who almost immediately sold the properties which they
freely received from the Crown, and applied the proceeds to their
own personal use.

Now, as regards the suppression of the larger monasteries, they
were to be carried out, if possible, by voluntary surrender. I
shall show that this was purely a sham. The Commissioners, no
doubt, tried in every way to persuade them to surrender by
promising the abbots and priors good pensions during life,
because no charges of immorality could have been preferred
against them. In 1536-7, there were but three surrenders. In
1537-8 there were twenty-four. The Commissioners induced
those who surrendered to persuade others to follow their example,
for it was the Kingâs policy to let the public see that the surrenders
were voluntarily made. When persuasion failed, the Commissioners
used threats, and so we read that the monks of the
Charterhouse were committed like common felons to Newgate,
[184]

where five of them died, and five more were on the point of death
from the cruel and barbarous treatment they received within the
walls of that prison. But the most revolting act of pure despotism
on the part of Henry VIII. was the execution of Whiting, abbot
of Glastonbury, Coke, abbot of Reading, and Beche, abbot of
St. Johnâs, Colchester. These despotic acts drove terror into
those who had not yet surrendered. In 1538-9, one hundred
and seventy-four surrendered, and in 1539-40, seventy-six. In
April, 1539, a slavish Parliament ratified the surrenders up to that
time, and allowed the King to extend the Act to all the other
monasteries which had not yet surrendered, by 31 Henry VIII.
c. xiii., âAn Act for the dissolution of monasteries and abbeys,â
by which about 277 monasteries of the value of Â£200 a year or
upwards, were dissolved; and what makes their dissolution more
remarkable and important, is that all the property of 193 of
them was and is discharged of tithes up to the present time.
Over 653 monasteries were dissolved by the Acts of 1536 and
1540, with properties equal to Â£250,000 per annum. In the
preamble of the above Act we do not find those grave charges
hurled against monks which appear in the Act which suppressed
the smaller monasteries in 1535.

In order to pass the above Acts, some of the nobility were promised
estates by free gifts from the King, others obtained them
by easy purchase. The members of the House of Commons were
also promised large shares, and of course Henryâs agents dangled
before the people: âNo more subsidies, no fifteenths, no loans, no
common aids,â as the wealth of the dissolved monasteries was
considered ample to maintain an army of 40,000 men, and so all
taxation may in future be dispensed with! The Church was also
to be conciliated. There were to be twenty-one bishoprics created,
with cathedrals, deans, and chapters all endowed out of the property.
[185]

This number was, however, reduced to six. Westminster
existed only for about nine years. Five now exist. Gloucester
and Bristol were united in 1836; but when sufficient funds are
collected to endow the Bristol bishopric, they are to be separated.

In 1540, there were 653 monasteries suppressed. In 1546,
90 colleges, 110 hospitals, and 2,347 chantries, with all their
properties, were handed over to the King by 1 Edward VI. c. xiv.,
the preamble of which runs thus: âTo convert to good and godly
uses the chantries, or in erecting grammar schools to the education
of youth in virtue and godliness, and in further augmenting
of universities and
better provision for the poor and needy
.â This
provision for the use of the chantry estates lamentably failed.
Neither the universities nor the poor were benefited. Like the
monastic estates, the hungry and avaricious courtiers who surrounded
the young king, had received the property for their own
personal use.

The capital value of all the property handed over to Henry
VIII., Edward VI. and Elizabeth would equal Â£200,000,000 at
the present time.

The 27 Henry VIII. c. xx. (1536) provides that âall tithes
should be paid according to the ecclesiastical laws and ordinances
of the Church of England, and after the laudable usages of the
parish or place where the party dwelt.â

The 32 Henry VIII., c. vii. s. 5 (1541): âNo tithes are to be
paid for lands discharged from paying tithes, or are not chargeable
in the payment of tithes.â

[186]

CHAPTER XVII.

TITHES IN THE CITY AND LIBERTIES OF LONDON.

In the early history of the Christian Church, the citizens of
London made oblations or offerings at every mass on Sundays
and holidays, and such oblations were applied to the relief of the
poor, the repairs of the church and the support of the clergy.
From these purely voluntary oblations grew up a custom in the
City of London, that every person paying 20
s.
a year rental should
give to God and the Church, Â½
d.
for every Sunday or Apostleâs
day, the vigil of which was a fast. If he paid only 10
s.
a year
rental, he was to give Â¼
d.
This amounted in the former case to
2
s.
6
d.
in the pound, and 1
s.
3
d.
in the latter, per annum. These
were customary payments, and were applied for the same three
purposesâpoor, fabric and clergy. As these customary payments
were found to decrease, it was deemed necessary to promulgate
an order to permanently fix the customary payments. Bishop
Roger took up the subject immediately after his consecration as
Bishop of London. The following are the facts of the case:â

(1) In
A.D.
1228, in the reign of Henry III., Bishop Roger,
surnamed Niger, or Le Noir, of London, made a constitution or
modus, that every occupier of a house should offer as his tithe to
his parish church, Â½
d.
for 20
s.
a year rental, and Â¼
d.
for 10
s.
a
year rental, for every Sunday and every Apostleâs day, whereof
the evening was fasted. There were fifty-two Sundays and eight
Apostlesâ days in the year that were fasted. Two shillings and
[187]

sixpence a year was then the amount of the
modus decimandi

which the former occupier had to pay, and one shilling and three
pence a year the latter. The amounts would be less when any
of the Apostlesâ days fell upon Sundays.

The above particulars appear in the Records in the Town
Clerkâs office, London. It is a well-known point in law that a
house
quÃ¢
house is not liable for the payment of tithes. Tithes
were paid for what issued or grew out of the ground. Enormous
house properties have been erected in and around all our cities
and towns, for which one penny as tithe-money has never been
paid, and yet the house property in the City and Liberties of
London, and landed property throughout the country, have to pay
a modus and tithe-rent charges.

(2) Bishop Rogerâs modus was paid for 160 years, viz., from
1229 to 1389, when Archbishop Arundel, of Canterbury, interfered
with the arrangement in the latter year. He was not satisfied
with the interpretation put upon Bishop Rogerâs Constitution as
regards the number of Apostlesâ days, and so he added twenty-two
more saintsâ days, thus increasing the payments from 2
s.
6
d.

to 3
s.
5
d.
a year, and this he did without consulting the payers.
The citizens of London were quite indignant at the additional
number of saintsâ days, and placed on record their protest against
the same for the information of future generations. There were
constant quarrels between the citizens and their clergy in the
ecclesiastical courts, and at the Popeâs court at Rome, with regard
to the payment of the extra 11
d.
The Archbishop appealed to
the Pope as to the soundness of his interpretation, and as a matter
of course, Pope Innocent VII., in 1403, confirmed the interpretation.
But the Popeâs bull did not pacify the citizens of London.
They considered the additional 11
d.
a cheatâa fraud. Besides,
the Popeâs bull could not compel them to pay the additional
[188]

amount. In 1453, however, it appears, by a record in the Town
Clerkâs office,
[274]
that Archbishop Arundelâs order is declared by
the Common Council to be âdestructory rather than declaratory,
and that it was obtained surreptitiously and deceptiously, without
assent on the part of the citizens, or summoning them.â I should
imagine that the Church, with its terrible ecclesiastical courts
made them pay the 3
s.
5
d.
, for we find no change in the payment
until 1535, when the whole subject was considered by the Privy
Council, who made an order for the payment of 2
s.
9
d.
in the
pound. Therefore in the same year an Act was passed,
[275]
authorizing
the citizens of London to pay their tithes at the rate of 2
s.
9
d.

in the pound. Ten years later another Act was passed,
[276]
âThat
the citizens and inhabitants of the City of London and Liberties
of the same shall yearly, without fraud or covin, for ever pay their
tithes to the parsons, vicars, and curates of the said City, and their
successors for the time being, after the following rate: For every
10
s.
rent by the year of all houses, shops, warehouses, cellars,
tables, etc., within the City and Liberty, 16Â½
d.
; and for every 20
s.

rent by the year, 2
s.
9
d.
; and so above the rent of 20
s.
by the
year, ascending from 10
s.
to 10
s.
, according to the rate aforesaid.â

(3) The next account of tithes in London was after the great
fire in 1666. An Act which I call the first Fire Act was passed in
1670,
[277]
for the better settlement of the maintenance of the parsons,
vicars and curates in the parishes of the city of London burnt by
the great fire. The preamble runs thus:â

âWhereas the tithes in the city of London were levied and paid
with great inequality, and are, since the late dreadful fire there,
in the rebuilding of the same, by taking away some houses, altering
[189]

the foundations of many, and the new erecting of others, so
disordered, that in case they should not for the time to come be
reduced to a certainty, many contrivances and suits of law might
arise, be it enacted that the annual certain tithes of every parish
in the City of London and its Liberties, whose churches have been
demolished or in part consumed by the late fire, be paid according
to the sum opposite each.â

Sec. 3. âWhich respective sums of money to be paid in lieu of
tithes within the said respective parishes, and assessed as hereinafter
is directed, shall be and continue to be esteemed, deemed
and taken to all intents and purposes, to be the respective annual
maintenance (over and above glebes and perquisites, gifts and
bequests to the respective parson, vicar and curate of any parish
for the time being, or to their successors respectively, or to others
for their use) of the said respective parsons, vicars and curates,
who shall be legally instituted, inducted and admitted in the
respective parishes.â

In subsequent sections assessments were ordered to be made
before the 24th July, 1671, upon all houses, shops, warehouses,
cellars, and other hereditaments, except parsonage and vicarage
houses.

Three transcripts were to be made by the assessors, containing
the respective sums to be payable out of all the premises within
each parish; one was for the Lord Mayor, the second for the
Bishop of Londonâs registry, and the third was to remain in the
vestry. The payments were to be made in four quarterly payments.

If any inhabitant should refuse payment the Lord Mayor
should issue his warrant of distress on his goods. If the Lord
Mayor should refuse to issue his warrant, then it shall be lawful
for the Lord Chancellor, or Keeper of the Great Seal, or any
[190]

two or more of the barons of his Majestyâs Court of Exchequer
to issue warrants of distress.

The payments made by 22 & 23 Car. II. c. xv. (1670) were
increased by 44 George III. c. lxxxix. (1804).

As the City and Liberties of London are converted into offices,
banks, warehouses, etc., and are almost depopulated, it is important
and instructive to give the names of the parishes which
appear in the Fire Act of 1670, with the respective annual sums
allowed in 1670 and the modified annual sums allowed in 1804.
The first sum is for 1670, the second for 1804, and the third
shows net income in 1890, with population from Clergy List, 1891.

With respect to other parishes in the City and Liberties of
London which are not included in the Fire Act, the incumbents
received the tithes specified in the Acts 27 Henry VIII., c. xxi.
and 37 Henry VIII. c. xii., viz., 2
s.
9
d.
in the pound upon the
rentals of the houses. The whole sum was paid into the common
treasury of the parish, and was applied to three purposes, viz. (1)
the support of the clergy; (2) the relief of the poor; and (3) the
repairs of the church. Here is the tripartite division.
[279]
By the
London (City) Tithes Act, 27, 28 Vict. c. cclxviii. (1864), annual
fixed sums are paid in lieu of tithes, but subject to a revision
on the first avoidance of the benefice that happens after the
expiration of a period of 28 years from the passing of the Act.

Tithes commuted for fixed annual sum of Â£1,600. Out of the
proceeds of this tithe-rate, two new churchesâAll Hallows,
Bromley, and S. Anthony, Stepneyâhave been built, and their
vicars endowed each with Â£500 per annum, and the balance
is accumulating for the erection of a third church and the endowment
of its vicar.

The tithes of the following parishes have been commuted by
local Acts.

[281]

The rector of S. Giles-in-the-Fields has a charge of Â£300 net
a year on next avoidance of S. Botolph without, Bishopsgate.

Under the London (City) Tithes Act, 1879, portions of the
sums payable as above have been redeemed, the consideration
being such sum as will, if invested in 3 per cent. consols., produce
an annual sum equal as near as may be to the annual
amount of such rent-charge. The consideration is paid to the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who pay the dividends on the stock
to the incumbents.

It is important to give
seriatim
some further particulars about
the above benefices.

(1) Of the Â£2,500 of
S. Andrew Undershaft, w. S. Mary-at-Axe
,
eight parishes receive in the aggregate Â£500 a year.
[282]
The
Bishop of London is patron; the rector is Bishop Billing, his
suffragan; his net income is Â£2,057, with Â£375 a year for house
rented; total, Â£2,432. Church accommodation, 210; population,
315.

(2) The fixed tithe of
S. Catherine Colman
is Â£1,550, out of
which six parishes at Bethnal Green receive in the aggregate
Â£400, S. Thomas Charterhouse Â£150, the rectors of S. Giles-in-the-Fields
Â£100, and S. Mary, Whitechapel, Â£500 per annum.
[283]

Bishop of London, patron; rector, Bishop Wilkinson; income,
[196]

Â£1,500 per annum, including Â£1,100 a year from rentals. Church
accommodation, 290; population, 277.

Here are two rich London benefices in the gift of the Bishop,
who gave them to his two suffragan bishops; the Bishop of
London sticks fast to his own Â£10,000 a year, and gives nothing
to his suffragans from this immense income.

(3)
S. Olave, Hart Street, w. All Hallows Staining.
Rectorâs
gross income, Â£2,050,
[284]
of which S. Olaveâs, Mile End, has Â£600
per annum, and house. Church accommodation, 250; population,
430.

(4)
All Hallows, London Wall
; fixed tithe Â£1,700; church
accommodation, 250; population, 535; patron, Lord Chancellor;
present rector was appointed in 1834; on next vacancy Â£1,400
will be divided into four parts; the rector will take one part
Â£350 + Â£300 = Â£650; Holy Trinity, Barking Road, Â£350; S.
Gabriel, Canning Town, Â£350; St. Luke, Victoria Dock, Â£350.

(5)
All Hallows Barking
; fixed tithe, Â£2,000; church accommodation,
600; population, 350; the incumbent has 4 curates
for a population of 350 (!); they are all well looked after.

(6)
S. Ethelburga
; fixed tithe, Â£950; income, Â£1,050;
church accommodation, 300; population, 199. On next avoidance,
Â£400 a year will be given to S. Botolph without, Aldgate.

(7)
S. Alphege, London Wall
; fixed tithe, Â£1,350; church
accommodation, 200; population, 31; on which S. George-in-the-East
has a charge of Â£500 per annum. The rector has
Â£925 for 31 of population!

(8)
S. Martin Outwich
, Threadneedle Street, was pulled
down and sold; fixed tithe, Â£2,250. Three churches erected
out of proceeds, and vicars endowed, thus. The charges on
[197]

this tithe are Â£600 Holy Trinity, Dalston; Â£300 Christ Church,
Stepney; Â£592 S. Peterâs, Limehouse; rector of S. Helen,
Bishopsgate with S. Martin Outwich, receives Â£858 per annum,
with house. Population, 541.

(9)
S. Peter-le-Poer w. S. Benet-Fink
; fixed tithe, Â£1,725;
church accommodation, 690; population, 530. The charges on
this tithe are Â£125, S. Mary Charterhouse; Â£200 a year each
to Holy Trinity, Haverstock-hill; Old Saint Pancras; St. Peterâs,
Regent Square; S. Mary, Somers Town; and; Â£100 to Holy
Cross, S. Pancras. The rector has a gross income of Â£1,000 a year.

(10)
S. Gilesâ, Cripplegate
; commuted tithe, Â£1,800; subject
to revision every ten years; in 1890 the value = Â£1,100, with
house; population, 2,473; S. Lukeâs, Old Street, has a charge of
Â£200 a year net.

(11)
S. Martin, Ludgate, w. S. Mary Magdalene
and
S.
Gregory by S. Paul
. The tithes of S. Gregory were commuted
under sect. 12 of S. Paulâs Cathedral Minor Canons Act, 1875,
by agreement published in the
London Gazette
of 19th March,
1878, for a
fixed annual sum of
Â£4,000, receivable by the holder
of the beneficial lease granted by the minor canons. When the
lease will lapse, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners will receive the
Â£4,000 per annum. What does the vicar get who has to look
after the 1,200 parishioners? Â£468, plus Â£100 from the E.C.,
arising out of local claim. The minor canons must have received
Â£10,000 at least for that lease.

(12)
S. Mary Abchurch w. S. Laurence
; income, Â£590, with
house; population, 236.

(13)
S. Catherine Cree w. S. James, Dukeâs Place
; income,
Â£583; population, 1,480. The latter was united to former by
Order in Council,
Gazette
, 6th May, 1873, taking Â£300 net a
year, which it had from 1867, from S. Peterâs, Cornhill.

[198]

(14)
S. Dunstan-in-the-East
; income, Â£536, from house property
chiefly; population, 442.

(15)
S. Bartholomew the Great w. Smithfield
; income, Â£650;
population, 2,373.

(16)
S. Botolph without, Aldersgate.
By 7 Geo. IV. c. cxvi., the
tithes were commuted for a fixed sum of Â£1,150 per annum payable
to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as rectors. This sum,
less Â£300 a year payable to the vicar, they leased, and the lessee
retains Â£850 a year. Income of vicar, Â£390; population, 3,330.

(17)
S. Botolph without, Bishopsgate
, has been given. Has a
house.

(18)
S. Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street.
By 1 Geo. IV. c. lix.,
the tithes were commuted to an annual payment by the ratepayers
of Â£359, of which Â£5 went to the Crown. By an order
in Council dated 16th April, 1886, S. Thomas in the Liberty of
the Rolls was united to the above parish, but the church of S.
Thomas was taken down and the site and materials sold. The
proceeds are to go towards building another church elsewhere,
erecting a new parsonage for the rector of S. Dunstan and augmenting
his income, which is Â£500 per annum; population, 2,300.

These eighteen incumbents receive Â£18,632, or average of
over Â£1,000 each per annum. But it must be noted that the
lessees of three parishes receive Â£11,350 per annum, in lieu of
tithes, from the ratepayers, viz.: S. Botolph without, Aldgate,
Â£6,500; S. Gregory-by-S.-Paul, Â£4,000; and S. Botolph without,
Aldersgate, Â£850. This Â£11,350 is not included here in any of
the incumbentâs incomes.

But here arises the public scandal. Eleven of these eighteen
incumbents receive Â£13,341 per annum for an aggregate population
including children, of 3,886, or Â£3 9
s.
per head.

The populations are taken from the census of 1881; and it
[199]

is probable that a considerable reduction in population will
appear from the census returns of 1891. But the clerical incomes
are not reduced.

Again, twenty-six incumbents of Fire parishes receive Â£15,702
for a population of 14,000. If we compare the income of Â£350
for the incumbent of only one of the parishes in Bethnal Green,
with a population of close on 14,000, with the Â£15,702 for a
similar population in the aggregate, we at once perceive the public
scandal.

Again, eleven incumbents of the Fire parishes have Â£8,050 for
an aggregate population of 7,000. If we take a single parish
outside of the City and Liberties of London, we shall find it with
a population much larger than 7,000, and yet the incumbent
would consider himself fortunate to receive a net income of Â£300
per annum.

I have now given sufficient data to prove that there exists
reasonable grounds for the public scandal as regards the parishes
in the City and Liberties of London. It is not my province to
suggest remedies, but to indicate facts and figures.

But eleven incumbents to receive Â£13,341 for an aggregate
population of 3,886 forms the coping-stone not to a public scandal,
but to a
public disgrace
, in this Christian country.

But the greatest public disgrace of all is to see the Bishop of
London himself receiving Â£10,000 net per annum, with three
suffragan bishops not paid by him, but paid out of parochial
revenues.

Then, on the top of the hill, is S. Paulâs Cathedral, with
a net

income of Â£25,000 per annum, and with palatial residences,
which recently cost Â£20,000, close to the cathedral, for the
canons. Truly it may be said of them,
Lac et lanas ovium Christi
suscipiunt, sed curam gregis Domini deponunt
.

[200]

The City of London Tithes Act of 1879 (42 & 43 Vict. c.
clxxvi.) provides for the commutation of tithes and payments in
lieu of tithes arising or growing due in certain parishes in the City
of London, and for the redemption of rent-charges charged upon
lands under the above Act.

By the Christ Church (City) Tithe Act, 1879 (42 & 43 Vict.
c. xciii.), S. Bartholomewâs Hospital receives in lieu of tithes the
annual sum of Â£1,800, which is levied and collected as tithe rates
by the hospital from persons rateable to poor rates in that parish.
Tithes in arrears are recoverable by distress in the same manner
as stated in the Commutation Act of 1836. The vicar of Christ
Church, Newgate Street, with S. Leonard, Foster Lane, has Â£456
per annum; population, 1,380. This is a Fire parish.

Mr. Edward Jeffries Esdaile and his successors are the owners
by purchase, Â£20,000, of the tithes of the parish of S. Botolph
without, Aldgate. Disputes arose after the Act of 1879 as to
payments to be made to Mr. Esdaile in respect of tithes. An
Act was therefore passed in 1881, called, âThe City of London
Tithes, S. Botolph without, Aldgate,â (42 & 43 Vict. c. cxcvii.)
to commute the tithes.

By sec. 3 of this Act, the tithe-owner is to receive Â£6,500
a year in lieu of tithes, which was to be levied and collected by
the churchwardens from the persons by law rateable to poor
rates, and shall be assessed on the annual rateable value of the
houses assessed for poor rates. The Â£6,500 a year was to be
paid by the churchwardens to the tithe-owner after the 29th
September, 1881, by two half-yearly payments. The cost of
making and collecting the tithe-rates is to be paid by the ratepayers,
and is to be exclusive of the Â£6,500. The owners of
houses can redeem the tithes as if they were rent-charge under
the Tithes Commutation Act of 1836.

[201]

CHAPTER XVIII.

THE COMMUTATION ACT OF 1836
[285]
.

Up to the time that this Act was passed, the tithe-owner
claimed in kind the tenth part of the gross produce of the land,
without contributing anything towards cultivation or improvement.
In fact, the claim retarded both, and the object of the Act was
to advance and not to keep back the cultivation and improvement
of the land. The tithe was a tax upon labour and capital. The
collection of tithes became both unpopular and obnoxious.

âTithes are a tax,â says Archdeacon Paley, ânot only upon
industry, but upon that industry which feeds mankind. They
operate as a bounty upon pasture. The burden of the whole tax
falls upon tillage, that is, upon that precise mode of cultivation
which it is the business of the State to relieve and remunerate in
preference to every other.â
[286]

âThe tithe,â says Adam Smith, âis always a great discouragement
both to the improvement of the landlords and to the
cultivation of the farmers. The one cannot venture to make the
most important, which are generally the most expensive, improvements,
nor the other to raise the most valuable, which are
generally, too, the most expensive, crops, when the Church, which
lays out no part of the expense, is to share so very largely in the
profit.â
[287]

[202]

Agricultural depression, during the four years previous to 1836,
and the growing discontent of agricultural tithe-payers, demanded
a speedy solution of this problem. Statesmen tried to solve it
before Lord Russell attempted the task. Lord Althorp tried it
in 1833, and again in 1834, but failed on both occasions. His
three principal propositions were: (1) To substitute a money
payment in lieu of tithes in kind; (2) The rent-charge to bear a
fixed proportion to the rent payable on the land; and (3) To
redeem the tithe by twenty-five yearsâ purchase, or the creation
of a rent-charge of equal value. The second proposition was the
weakest. Any attempt to establish a proportion between the
tithe and rent would end in failure, for the two had no similar
foundation. Tithe was founded upon produce, but rent was not.
Lord Althorp would make tithe to fluctuate with rent, retaining
a fixed proportion of rent-charge. In principle it was a tax on
capital, and therefore failed.

In 1835, Sir Robert Peel, when Prime Minister, introduced a
Bill on the same subject. The principle contained in his Bill
was that there should be a fixed money payment in the shape of
a corn-rent in lieu of tithes, varying yearly according to the price
of the three cornsâwheat, barley, and oats; that it should be a
voluntary arrangement between the tithe-owner and tithe-payer.
The machinery to carry out this Bill was to appoint three Commissioners,
viz., two by the Crown, and one by the Archbishop
of Canterbury. These Commissioners should appoint Assistant
Commissioners. Within a month after he had introduced this
Bill, his Government went out of office, on the 8th of April,
1835.

Lord John Russell, a member of Lord Melbourneâs Government
which succeeded Sir Robert Peelâs, took up the subject of tithes
by introducing a Bill on the 9th of February, 1836. âTithe,â
[203]

said his lordship, âwas a discouragement to industry, a penalty
on skill, a heavy mulct on those who expended the most capital
and displayed the greatest skill in the cultivation of the land.â
These were true words; and it gives one pleasure to observe that
he had the courage to boldly express his opinions. But his boldest
statement was that âtithes were the property of the nation.â
This remark has again and again been quoted by the opponents
of tithes, and it has as often been contradicted by the defenders
of tithes.

Lord Russell rejected Lord Althorpâs plan which related to
the establishment of a proportion between tithe and rent. He
adopted the machinery and some other parts of Sir Robert Peelâs
Bill. The principles contained in Lord Russellâs Bill were that
the landowner or tenant might agree with the tithe-owner
to
commute the tithe
, whether paid by modus or composition or
otherwise,
into a corn-rent payable in money and permanent in
quantity, but fluctuating yearly in value
, so that in future any
improved value given to land would not increase the amount of
the rent-charge. The corns were to be wheat, oats, and barley.
The base of calculation was to be the average tithe paid for the
seven years previous to Christmas, 1835. The arrangement was
to be voluntary up to the 1st October, 1838, then compulsory.
The Bill was at first but tentative, and was materially changed in
its progress through the House.

The Commutation Act made a great change. The tithes were
no longer to be paid on the produce or
increase
of the land, as
stated in the Mosaic Law, upon which law the payment of tithes
in the Christian Church was founded. Before the passing of the
Act, the tithe-owner had to sue the tithe-payer for arrears, but
after the Act was passed, he had the power to distrain on the
land for arrears, and the Act further empowers the tithe-owner
[204]

to go on any other land belonging to the same landowner which
may be in the same parish to recover the arrears of rent-charge,
should the land from which the tithe was due be unable to satisfy
his claim and costs. The tithe-owner has a prior claim to the
landlordâs.

The following statement will serve as an illustration of Lord
Russellâs Act. A money payment was fixed by the Tithe Commissioners
on an average of seven yearsâ payment of tithes. Let
this be Â£100; the third of which, or Â£33 6
s.
8
d.
, is for wheat,
a similar sum for barley, and oats. The average prices of the
three corns per bushel for the seven yearsâ previous to 1835
wasâfor wheat, 7
s.
0Â¼
d.
; for barley, 3
s.
11Â½
d.
; for oats, 2
s.
9
d.

The tithe-payer has to pay in respect of his Â£100 rent-charge
the price of 94Â·95 bushels of wheat, 168Â·42 bushels of barley,
and 242Â·42 bushels of oats. Early in January of every year
a duly authorized advertisement is inserted in the
London
Gazette
by order of the Comptroller of Corn, stating the average
prices of wheat, barley, and oats for the seven years then next
preceding. The serious objection to this plan is that the average
prices of the three cereals are calculated on the prices sold to the
millers, which included the cost of freight of one or more middlemen,
instead of calculating on the prices sold by the farmers.
This false system enhances the value of the rent-charge.

Supposing that for any year, say 1885, wheat was advertised
in the
London Gazette
at 5
s.
1Â¾
d.
per bushel; barley, 3
s.
11Â¾
d.
;
oats, 2
s.
8Â¾
d.
, what has the tithe-owner to receive for Â£100
tithe-rent charge?

He receives (94Â·95 Ã 61Â¾
d.
+ 168Â·42 Ã 47Â¾
d.
+ 242Â·42 Ã 32Â¼
d.
) =
Â£90 10
s.
3Â½
d.

The 80th section of the Act says that âany tenant who shall
pay any such rent-charge shall be entitled to deduct the amount
[205]

thereof from the rent payable by him to his landlord, and shall
be allowed the same in account with his landlord.â There are
few instances in which the tenants deduct the tithes from their
rents according to this section. The general practice is that the
farmer, in his lease or agreement, agrees to pay the tithes himself
to the tithe-owner, and the rent is computed accordingly.
The tenant therefore pays the rent-charge for the landlord.
If a tenant should take a farm without making any such agreement,
then the 80th section comes into force. But in the other
case the landlord contracts himself out of the 80th section.
There is no doubt that the Legislature in 1836 intended that
the landlords should pay the rent-charges, and thus prevent any
friction which may occur in the collection between the clergyman
and his parishioners. To remove this friction, the Government
brought in a Bill in 1890.

In the Commutation Act, although the rent-charge is to be
paid by the landlord, yet the tithe-owner cannot bring an action
against him for any arrears, but is bound by the act to distrain
on the land. The tenant has therefore two landlords. Hence
we find in years of agricultural depression that tenants who
receive a deduction in the half-yearâs rents from their landlord,
seek also for a deduction from their second landlord, the tithe-owner.
These applications are generally made to parochial
incumbents, who prefer making the deduction asked for than
run the odium resulting from distraints on the lands of their
parishioners. Other tithe-owners, such as the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners, impropriators, colleges, schools, etc., will make
no deduction whatever, but sternly carry out the provisions
of the Act by making distraints on the lands. Similar conduct
was pursued before the passing of the Commutation Act. The
parochial clergy, in the most sympathetic manner, accepted very
[206]

low tithes in years of agricultural depression, but the clerical
appropriators and all the impropriators strictly exacted every
part of their tithes.

When the Commutation Bill was passing through Parliament,
it was urged that many landlords were often absent from the
country for a considerable time, and therefore if the rent-charges
were not paid, the tithe-owners would find it very difficult
to get payment from absent landlords, who had no agents in
the country. The law was therefore framed to enable the
tithe-owners to distrain on the lands for arrears, just in the
same manner as the landlords could distrain for arrears of rent.
This was the origin of dual landlordism as it appears in the
Act.

The rent-charges are liable to parliamentary, parochial, county,
and other rates, charges, and assessments, to which the tithes
were liable. The great injustice of tithe-rent charges is that
they are levied only upon agricultural produce, thus leaving free
of such charges the extensive city and town lands. The lands in
the vicinity of large cities and towns, which produced a rental
Â£3 per acre, and tithe, 10
s.
, when converted to building
purposes produce enormous ground-rents, besides a reversion
of the house property at the expiration of the leases. In such
cases the tithe-owner receives no tithe on the building value.
Thus the value of the landlordâs acre is increased one hundredfold,
but the tithe is not increased, and thus the growing
value of the land leaves no part of it for the support of
religion.

Let us take, for example, the enormous house properties in
London held by three dukes, viz., Westminster, Portland, and
Bedford. They pay but a small amount of rent-charge compared
with their rentals.

[207]

When the Commutation Act was passed, there was much
boasting by the supporters of the Church as to the humility of
the clergy who had not petitioned Parliament, or held any
meetings to protest against the Bill while passing through Parliament.
There was good reason for such silent acquiescence.
The Church made a good bargain under the circumstances.
The expenses of collecting the tithes in kind sometimes reached
50 per cent, of the gross value. The tithe-owner is now relieved
of all this expense and trouble, and the Act has given him a
firm security.

Sir James Caird, in his book, entitled, âLanded Interest,â
says, âSince the passing of the Tithe Commutation Act, in 1836
to 1876, the rent of tithable land increased from thirty-three
millions a year to fifty millions a year. The tithe-rent charge
in 1836 was four millions, and is about the same still.â He then
asserts that the Church has lost two millions a year by the Act.
In 1890, there is a considerable reduction in the rentals throughout
the country, owing to agricultural depression. The repeal
of the Corn Laws has led to the introduction of such large
quantities of wheat from foreign countries, that our farmers, with
their heavy rents, rates, taxes, and tithe-rent charges, are unable
to compete with foreign producers. It is calculated that what
is produced in England and Wales for the maintenance of the
population, would only suffice for three months out of the
twelve, and that nine monthsâ provisions are imported from
foreign countries and from Ireland and Scotland. It is therefore
doubtful that if the Commutation Act were repealed, whether
the tithe-owners would receive more from tithes in kind than
the gross rent-charge of four millions per annum. But it would
be utterly unreasonable, and practically impossible now, to repeal
this Act, as Church defenders want, and have a re-valuation;
[208]

and even some go so far as to assert that the tithe in kind
should again be collected. Now, one statement is sufficient to
overthrow these assertions. The main object of the Commutation
Act of 1836 was to prevent tithe-owners from receiving
an increased quantity of tithes from increased agricultural improvements.
So long as this system continued, landlords and
tenants were always unwilling to sink capital in agricultural improvements,
because a large part of the profits would be claimed
by the tithe-owners who had not expended a shilling to realize
these profits. But all this was changed by the Commutation
Act; and, consequently, both landlords and tenants have expended,
since 1836, enormous sums of money in improvements.
Therefore, if there were now a re-valuation, it would be estimated
upon present improvements, which it was the main object of
the Commutation Act to prevent. And the re-valuation would
be a gross injustice on those who sank their money in improvements.
On the other hand, I must admit, in justice to the
tithe-owners, that the repeal of the Corn Laws had never been
anticipated when the Act of 1836 was passed, and it is an
unquestionable fact that the repeal of these laws has brought
about the present diminution of rent-charges, which are based
upon the prices of three cereals, the most important being wheat,
which has been and will be the most important and extensive
article of importation from foreign countries, and its growing
diminution of cultivation in England and Wales. The tithe,
or tithe-rent charge being national property, and no compensation
being made when the Corn-Laws were repealed, which
obviously would affect, in course of time, the prices of the cereals
in England, it seems to me that an act of injustice to this class
of property was perpetrated when the Corn-Laws were repealed,
and when no counterbalancing compensation was given, or provision
[209]

made in the Act to meet any future diminution of this
property
below par
, which diminution may be traced to the
operations of this Act. This national property should be carefully
safeguarded, especially against landlords, who, in the
majority, are the law-makers.

Redemption of Tithe-Rent Charge.

The force of this observation is keenly felt when the property
is put up for sale. It will be difficult to frame a Redemption
Act, for one party will calculate the price at
par value
; another
party, at the current annual value, which is now so much below
par. And it is uncertain when the upward turn in the average
annual value will occur, and when it does occur, it will be very
small and slow. This is what makes the redemption question
so difficult to deal with. In the Tithe Act of 1891, the provision
for redeeming the tithe-rent charge is omitted and postponed.
In framing a Redemption Bill, everything will turn on
the meaning attached to the word
value
. Two values will be
the salient points for discussion: (1)
Present market value
of
the tithe-rent charge; and (2)
a fair value
. The most opposite
opinions will be found to prevail on these two vital points. Let
us take Â£100 of the âcommuted value,â and put it in the
market for sale. The present value (1891) of the Â£100 is
Â£73 3
s.
3Â¾
d.
Present purchaser will reason thus: Depreciation,
Â£24; rates and other charges, Â£20 = Â£100 - 44 = Â£56.
Having arrived at this amount, the next important question the
purchaser will ask himself, How many yearsâ purchase shall I
give? Some will say twenty, but a reasonable man will say
twenty-five, and will offer 56 Ã 25 = Â£1,400 for the Â£100 of the
âcommuted value.â Again, there is a powerful body, and
[210]

among them the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who would probably
not sell at Â£1,400. They would start from
par value
and only
allow a deduction for rates and other charges,
i.e.
, Â£ 100 - 20 =
Â£80, and would not sell for less than twenty-five yearsâ purchase
on this value,
i.e.
, Â£80 x 25 = Â£2,000. These are the salient
facts with which the framers of any Redemption Bill will have
to deal. There may be a
modus vivendi
arrived at by âsplitting
the difference,â and selling Â£100 say for Â£1,800, and other
amounts in the same proportion. The Bill will never pass except
both parties will agree to a
modus vivendi
, as above sketched out.
But in my opinion, the price should not be less than Â£2,000.

The following statement is taken from the Tithe Commissionersâ
Report, dated 4th July, 1887.

The recipients of (1) and (4) are stated in the Appendix.

In 1891, the depreciation is Â£967,419, and the total gross
value is Â£3,061,705. Assuming Â£2,000 to be the price by Act
of Parliament of Â£100 commuted value; the Government would
advance to the landowners Â£58,837,965 at Â£4 per cent., and
would hand over stock at Â£2Â¾ per cent. to this amount to the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners, in trust for the parochial incumbents
and clerical appropriators. They would pay the dividends,
amounting to Â£1,705,200 per annum, to the incumbents, etc., just
as they do the dividends on other properties vested in them.

Now, in 1891, the same tithe-owners receive about Â£1,734,152
net. The depreciation in value of tithe is, we may say, at its
[211]

nadir
. Therefore the income from stock should not be less than
this nadir value, and hence the purchasing value should not be
less than Â£2,000. The property is national, and therefore care
should be taken to maintain its value, and to prevent landowners,
as in 1836, from getting another large slice of this national
property.

The Extraordinary Tithe-Rent Charge.

On one important point, Lord Russell had deviated from its
leading principle in the second reading of the Bill. A deputation
of Middlesex market-gardeners waited upon him after the Bill
was introduced, who pointed out that they had expended a large
amount of capital on improvements of their market-gardens
during the past seven years, and that if they were to pay a rent-charge
on the average of these seven years, they would continue
liable to a very heavy charge, while the owners of arable land or
common land in their neighbourhood, paying very low tithe composition,
would come into competition with them and thus ruin
them. This argument had actually influenced his lordship even
against his own will, and so he introduced an extraordinary rent-charge,
calculated on each acre, in addition to the ordinary
rent-charge on hop grounds, orchards, and market-gardens,
brought into new cultivation. In introducing this Bill, and before
the Middlesex market-gardeners influenced him, Lord Russell
used these remarkable words: âWhatever might be done with
orchards and gardens now existing, he felt considerable difficulty
in rendering land that might be converted into orchards or gardens
in future, liable to increased tithes. Orchards were a precarious
and uncertain description of property, and frequently
did not bear in certain years; and in respect of garden lands, if
[212]

the Legislature allowed the question to be opened again from
time to time, it would give rise to incessant disputes.â
[288]

Although he thus modified his views in the second reading,
yet he was thoroughly opposed to the principle. And his prophetic
words stated above, were fully realized in the subsequent
amendment Acts which were absolutely necessary as regards the
modification of extraordinary rent-charges. No extraordinary
charge was to be made the first year for new cultivations, and
only one-half of the charge for the second year, but the full
charge was to be made in the third year. In thus deviating from
the principle of his Bill, he made the following remark: âTithes
on extremely valuable crops, such as hops, orchards, and market-gardens,
could not be allowed to enter into an average for a
general commutation.â From the passing of the Act in 1836, up
to the present time, this extraordinary rent-charge has been a
fruitful source of discontent, because it is a tax on capital and
labour, against which the principle of the Commutation Act was
framed.

It kept almost stationary the cultivation of hops and market-gardens,
instead of extending them. The hop proprietors were
at the time in favour of the petition of the market-gardeners.
When lands would go out of cultivation of hops, or of orchards,
or of market-gardens, then they would be subject only to the
ordinary rent-charge. But all new cultivations were to pay the
extraordinary rent-charge, which in some cases reached as high
as 30
s.
per acre. When this amount was added to the ordinary
charge, the whole profit was absorbed, especially since the hop
growers have now to compete with foreign countries, which pay
no tithes nor duty on hops imported into this country.

It may be said that the duty on hops, having been repealed
[213]

since 1862, the reduction of about Â£4 5
s.
per acre must have
benefited the hop growers. The fact is, that the landlords and
not the tenants mainly derived the profits from the reduction.
Before 1836, there were 56,300 acres of hops cultivated; in 1880
there were 66,703 acres.

The Market-Gardens Act of 1873 was passed on account of a
burst of popular indignation against the conduct of the Vicar of
Gulval, in Cornwall, who endeavoured to enforce the payment
of an extraordinary tithe-rent charge of 1
s.
6
d.
per acre on 213
acres brought into new cultivation. It was enacted that the
provisions relating to the extraordinary charge on market-gardens,
newly cultivated as such,
should only apply to parishes where such
charge was distinguished at the time of commutation
.

In 1839 (2 & 3 Vict. c. lxii. s. 27) an Act was passed in a
quiet manner which placed orchards as regards the extraordinary
tithe-rent charge on the same footing as the Act of 1873 (36 &
37 Vict. c. xlii.) placed the market-gardens. The Acts of 1839
and 1873 admit that extraordinary rent-charges are wrong in
principle, and that those on hops should have been abolished.

In 1886 an Act was passed (49 & 50 Vict. c. liv.) in the preamble
of which it is stated that the extraordinary rent-charge
levied under previous Acts, is an impediment to agriculture, and
therefore the Act should have been limited, and power given to
redeem the same. It is enacted that after the passing of this
Act, no extraordinary charge shall be made or levied under the
Tithe Commutation Acts on any hop ground, orchard, fruit
plantation, or market-garden newly cultivated as such. The
Land Commissioners are authorized to fix the capital value of the
extraordinary charge payable on each farm or parcel of land at
the date of the passing of the Act. The third section indicates
the manner in which the capital value is to be ascertained. Such
[214]

land is to be charged with the payment of an annual rent-charge
equal to four per centum on the capitalized value of the extraordinary
charge, in lieu of the extraordinary charge. This rent-charge
shall be payable half-yearly on the days on which the
extraordinary charge was made payable. Arrears of rent-charge
are to be recovered in one of the High Courts of Justice, or a
County Court, âor in the same way that rent charge in lieu of
ordinary tithe is recoverable, and subject to like conditions, or by
entry upon and perception of the rents and profits of the land
subject to such rent-charge.â The rent-charge is not to be subject
to any parochial, county or other rate, charge, or assessment.
The rent-charge may be redeemed by the owner or other person
interested in any land, subject to an extraordinary charge or rent-charge
substituted therefor. The redemption money is to be
paid to the Governors of Queen Anneâs Bounty, to be applied for
the benefit of the incumbent, if the owner be the incumbent of a
benefice. Provision is made for the redemption of the rent-charge
in other cases of ownership. If the tenant had contracted,
before the passing of the Act, to pay the extraordinary rent-charge
to the owner, he shall do so no longer, but pay to his
landlord during his tenancy the rent-charge substituted for the
extraordinary charge. The landlord is then made liable for the
payment of the rent-charge to the owner, notwithstanding any
agreement to the contrary which the tenant had made with his
landlord. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners are empowered to
adjust the fixed charges made before the passing of the Act, on
the income of benefices in receipt of extraordinary tithes in
favour of other benefices, or of district churches or chapelries
within the parishes of which the incumbents are in receipt of
extraordinary tithes.

Lord John Russell, when introducing the Tithe Commutation
[215]

Bill, said these words: âThe income of the clergy will now flow
from the landlord and not from the farmer, and the clergyman
will be relieved from an alternative that too often exists, either
of making personal enemies by pressing his demand, or of injuring
himself by abandoning it.â His lordship, in his âRecollections
and Suggestions,â makes the following statement: âAll the
evils of the tithe system were the subject of fair compromise and
permanent settlement by the Act of 1836. Three Commissioners,
two of whom were appointed by the Crown and one by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, were empowered, after examination,
to proceed by certain fixed rules to a final adjudication. In
about seven years this process was completed, and a work from
which Pitt had shrunk was accomplished.â

In reading this statement one may smile at the âpermanent
settlement.â Ever since 1836 there has been a continuous
struggle going on down to 1886 on the subject of âExtraordinary
tithe-rent charge.â

It is important to state who were the clerical appropriators,
schools, colleges, etc., in receipt of tithes in 1836. As regards
the lay impropriators, it would entail enormous work to get their
names. The Tithe Commissioners have their names in each
apportionment. But in very many cases the property has, since
1836, changed hands, either by sale, wills, etc.

The endowments of the Welsh bishops and Cathedral churches
were taken from the parochial tithes. This meant spiritual destitution
in such Welsh parishes. The Norman conquerors seized
and held the Welsh episcopal and Cathedral endowments; then
the bishops and chapters seized the parochial tithes, and at the
time of the Reformation, the Crown annexed additional parochial
tithes in augmentation of episcopal and capitular incomes. These
tithes were not, as in England, monastic, but were actually taken
from the parish clergy by virtue of the Crownâs prerogative as head
of the Church.

Diocese of Bangor.

Bishop of Bangor
had from 16 parishes, Â£5,560; viz., Â£3,258
in his own diocese; Â£2,302 in the diocese of St. Asaph. The
Ecclesiastical Commissioners (E. C.), when this property was
vested in them, annexed Â£3,701 to parochial incumbents in the
diocese, and retained to Â£1,859.

By an Act of 1 James II. (1685), the Dean and Chapter received
the tithes of five parishes in Montgomeryshire for the
service and repairs of church. They amount to Â£1,616, which
they still possess.

Diocese of Llandaff.

The Bishop received Â£1,872 from 11 parishes. The Bishop
of Gloucester and Bristol received Â£430 from two parishes.

The Chapter received Â£4,487 from 28 parishes. And in
addition to this enormous sum, the Chapterâs separate estates
amounted to Â£1,922 from 16 parishes. Here, then, is a total of
[219]

Â£6,409 per annum, taken from 44 parishes by the Chapter of
Llandaff.

But this is not the end of the depletion of parochial endowments.
The Dean and Chapter of Gloucester received Â£2,618
from 12 parishes; and the Dean and Chapter of Bristol Â£966
from 5 parishes. Here, then, is a total of Â£12,297 per annum,
taken from 76 parishes in this diocese alone by two bishops and
three chapters.

Diocese of St. Asaph.

This was the most lamentable diocese in Wales.

The Bishop received Â£8,121 per annum from 23 parishes.

Bishop of St. Davidâs, Â£800 from one.

The Dean and Chapter received Â£1,649 from three parishes.
By 29 and 30 Charles II., they received Â£1,370 from 4 parishes
for âDomus and Fabric.â

The Chapterâs eight separate estates amounted to Â£6,084 from
14 parishes, viz., Dean, Â£1,987; Precentor, Â£1,585; Chancellor,
Â£868; Treasurer, Â£350; four Prebendaries, Â£1,294.

The Dean and Chapter of Oxford, Â£2,513 from 4 parishes.

The Dean and Chapter of Winchester, Â£2,205 from two
parishes.

The Vicars-Choral received Â£846 from three parishes.

The total is Â£23,588 from 54 parishes; add Â£2,302 received
by the Bishop of Bangor from 4 parishes, which has already
been stated under âBangor Diocese,â or Â£25,890 from 58
parishes in the Diocese of St. Asaph, was received per annum
by three bishops and three chapters.

There were 15 sinecure rectories in this diocese in 1836, with
incomes amounting in the aggregate to Â£6,227 commuted value.
[220]

The rectors of these benefices had no duties whatever to perform.
They received handsome incomes and nothing to do for them.
Here was the rich harvest for the bishopâs sons and other relatives.
The benefices were all in the bishopâs patronage. Bishop
Luxmoore, who was bishop of St. Asaph from 1815 to 1830, had
an income of Â£12,000 per annum, and his two sons and two
relatives had between them Â£15,000 a year from the diocese,
i.e.

Â£27,000 per annum received by the father, his two sons and two
relatives, at a time when the total net receipts by
all the working
clergy
of this diocese amounted to only Â£18,000 per annum.

It is a very serious matter in reference to the prebendal estates.
The Act of 1840 vested all these estates in the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners. The prebendaries anticipated what was coming,
and therefore granted leases on the lives of mere infants. The
result was lamentable to the parishes. No help from the tithe-rent
charges could be given them until the leases lapsed. It is
[222]

now 1891,
i.e.
, fifty-one years after the passing of the Act, and yet
sixteen leases of the thirty-seven are still running. And so all the
rent-charges of these parishes have for so many years been
diverted from these parishes, and so parochial destitution has
continued in this diocese. As the leases expire, the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners come into possession of the property, and then,

but not till then
, are steps taken to annex to parishes certain
portions of this property. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners
have often, in a very kind manner, granted to parishes in England
and Wales annuities out of the common Fund, in regard to local
claims, in anticipation of the lapse of the leases on tithes, lands,
mines and house property.

The net annual income derived by the E. C. for 1888 from
[224]

property in Wales was Â£28,796. Therefore Â£38,838 was a free
grant out of the Common Fund to the Church in Wales in 1889,
and the amount was much larger for 1890.

The value in 1889 of Â£29,169 commuted tithes in Wales, was
Â£23,014, which was all that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners
can be credited with.

By a parliamentary return, issued 30th June, 1890, the E. C.
state that in 1885 they had Â£23,798 of depreciated value of the
commuted tithes. The amount in possession of the E. C. varies
from year to year on account of (1) depreciation of value; (2)
the falling in of beneficial leases, and (3) annexations of all or
part of this property to parishes to satisfy local claims when the
leases expire.

The total gross revenues from tithes, glebes, Common Fund of
E.C., Queen Anneâs Bounty, etc., of bishops, chapters and incumbents,
in the four Welsh dioceses were in 1890 Â£325,226; curates,
etc., Â£55,000 additional. Church population, including children,
350,000. Nonconformist population = 1,400,000.

receive Â£186,595
gross
tithe-rent charges from
these thirteen
counties
. Average for each, gross Â£245, and in 1891,

This income is exclusively from tithes.

Chapter VIII.

An Act to make better provision for the Recovery of Tithe Rentcharge
in England and Wales.

[54 Vict. c. viii., 26th March, 1891.]

Be it enacted by the Queenâs most Excellent Majesty, by and
with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the
authority of the same, as follows:

[226]

Liability of owner to pay tithe rentcharge, and modification of
contracts with tenants.

I.â(1) Tithe rentcharge as defined by this Act issuing out of
any lands shall be payable by the owner of the lands, notwithstanding
any contract between him and the occupier of such lands,
and any contract made between an occupier and owner of lands,
after the passing of this Act, for the payment of the tithe rentcharge
by the occupier shall be void.

(2) Where the occupier is liable under any contract made
before the passing of this Act to pay the tithe rentcharge, then
he shall cease to be bound by that part of his contract, but he
shall be liable to pay to the owner such sum as the owner has
properly paid on account of the tithe rentcharge which such
occupier is liable under his said contract to pay, exclusive of any
costs incurred or paid by the owner in respect of such tithe rentcharge,
and every receipt given for such sum shall state expressly
that the sum is paid in respect of that tithe rentcharge: Provided
that where the lands, out of which any tithe rentcharge issues, are
occupied by several occupiers who have contracted to pay the
tithe rentcharge, any of such occupiers shall be liable only to pay
such proportion of the sum paid by the owner of the lands on
account of that tithe rentcharge as the rateable value of the lands
occupied by him bears to the rateable value of the whole of the
lands occupied by such occupiers.

(3) Such sum shall be recoverable from the occupier by distress
in like manner as is provided by sections eighty-one and eighty-five
of the Act of the session of the sixth and seventh years of the
reign of King William the Fourth, chapter seventy-one, and the
enactments amending those sections, and not otherwise.

[227]

Recovery of tithe rentcharge through County Court.

II.â(1) Where any sum due on account of tithe rentcharge
issuing out of any lands is in arrear for not less than three months,
the person entitled to such sum may, whatever is the amount,
apply to the County Court of the district in which the lands or any
part thereof are situate, and the County Court, after such service
on the owner of the lands as may be prescribed, and after hearing
such owner if he appears and desires to be heard, may order that
the said sum, or such part thereof as appears to the Court to be
due, be, together with the costs, recovered in manner provided
by this Act, and tithe rentcharge as defined by this Act shall not
be recovered in any other manner.

(2) Where it is shown to the Court that the lands are occupied
by the owner thereof, the order shall be executed by the appointment
by the Court of an officer who, subject to the direction of the
Court, shall have the like powers of distraint for the recovery of
the sum ordered to be paid as are conferred by the Tithe Acts on
the owner of a tithe rentcharge for the recovery of arrears of tithe
rentcharge, and no greater or other powers; and if there is no
sufficient distress the person entitled to the sum ordered to be
recovered may proceed to obtain possession of the lands under
section eighty-two of the Tithe Act, 1836.
[291]

(3) In any other case the order shall be executed by the
appointment by the Court of a receiver of the rents and profits
of the lands, and of any other lands which would be liable to be
distrained upon for the tithe rentcharge to which the order refers
under the provisions of section eighty-five of the Tithe Act, 1836,
and where any of such lands are held at one rent together with
other lands in another parish, the Court shall apportion the rent
[228]

between the said lands and the lands in the other parish in
proportion to their rateable value, in which case the payment of
such apportioned rent by the occupier to the receiver shall in
every respect, as between the occupier and the owner of the lands,
be deemed to be a payment on account of the total rent payable
to the owner of such lands.

(4) Subject to the prescribed regulations, the County Court shall
have the same powers over receivers as in any other case, and
may confer on the person appointed receiver any powers which
the Court can confer upon persons appointed receivers, but the
court shall not have power to order the sale of lands.

(5) Any sum ordered by the Court under this section to be
recovered shall be payable by a trustee in bankruptcy, sheriff,
or officer of a Court who is in possession of the lands, in like
manner as if it were tithe rentcharge recoverable under the Tithe
Acts.

(6) Where the occupier of the lands out of which the tithe
rentcharge issues is liable under any contract made before the
passing of this Act to pay the tithe rentcharge, and is consequently
liable by virtue of this Act to pay the amount thereof to
the owner of the lands, the owner of such lands shall serve notice
of such liability on the owner of the tithe rentcharge, and thereupon,
before an order under this section is made, there shall be
such service on the occupier in addition to the owner as may be
prescribed, and a hearing of such occupier if he appears and
desires to be heard. Any owner of the lands who fails to serve
such notice as aforesaid on the owner of the tithe rentcharge, shall
not be entitled to recover from the occupier any sum which he
has paid on account of the tithe rentcharge as aforesaid, unless
and until he has, after notice to the occupier of his application
for the same, obtained from the County Court a certificate that
[229]

there was good and sufficient cause for the failure to give such
notice, and that the occupier has not been prejudiced thereby.

(7) Rules under this Act may regulate the procedure practice
and costs under this Act in County Courts, and may direct what
service shall be good service for the purposes of this Act on the
owner or occupier of any lands or the owner of any tithe rentcharge,
and may provide that, if the owner of any lands is not
known, any proceeding under this Act may be taken against the
owner of the lands without naming the person who is the owner.

(8) The fees payable on the proceedings under this section
shall not exceed those set forth in the schedule to this Act, and
the fees, charges, and expenses in or incidental to any distress
under this Act shall be the same as are for the time being payable
under the Law of Distress Amendment Act, 1888.
[292]

(9) Nothing in this Act shall impose or constitute any personal
liability upon any occupier or owner of lands for the payment of
any tithe rentcharge, or any other sum recoverable or payable
under this Act, and the Court shall not, by virtue of this Act, or
of the County Courts Act, 1888,
[293]
have any power to imprison any
such occupier or owner by reason only of the non-payment of such
tithe rentcharge or other sum, and shall in any other case have no
other or greater powers of fine or imprisonment than are conferred
by the County Courts Act, 1888.

Rules.

III.â(1) The Lord Chancellor may, after consultation with the
Rule Committee of County Court Judges, make rules for carrying
this Act into effect, and for regulating, providing, and prescribing
any matter authorised by this Act to be regulated, provided, or
[230]

prescribed by rules under this Act. In framing such rules, regard
shall be had to making the procedure as simple and inexpensive
as is practicable.

(2) Every rule under this Act shall be laid before each House
of Parliament within forty days next after it is made, if Parliament
is then sitting, or, if not, within forty days after the commencement
of the then next ensuing session, and if an address
is presented to Her Majesty by either House of Parliament within
the next subsequent forty days on which the said House shall
have sat, praying that any such rule may be annulled, Her
Majesty may thereupon, by Order in Council, annul the same;
and the rule so annulled shall thenceforth become void and of no
effect, but without prejudice to the validity of any proceedings
which may in the meantime have been taken under the same.

Lands occupied rent free, etc.

IV.âWhere a receiver appointed under this Act of the rents
and profits of any lands satisfies the County Court that the lands
are let on such terms as not to reserve a rent sufficient to enable
the receiver to recover from the owner thereof the sum ordered
to be recovered, the Court, after such service on the owner and
occupier of the lands as may be prescribed, and after hearing such
owner and occupier if they appear and desire to be heard, may
direct that the order for such recovery shall be executed as if the
occupier were the owner of the lands: Provided that any such
occupier shall be entitled in addition to any other remedy, unless
he would have been liable to pay the tithe rentcharge under any
contract made before the passing of this Act, to deduct from any
sums at any time becoming due from him to the landlord under
whom he holds, any amount which shall have been recovered from
him under this section in respect of tithe rentcharge or costs, with
[231]

interest thereon at the rate of four per centum per annum: Provided
further, that such occupier shall be entitled, notwithstanding
anything in this Act, to recover from such landlord by action at
law any such amount which shall have been recovered from him
under this section as aforesaid as money paid on the account of
such landlord.

Restrictions as to costs.

V.â(1) An application to a County Court for an order under
this Act may be made on behalf of the tithe-owner by his agent,
although not a solicitor.

(2) On any application to a County Court for an order under
this Act, no costs either of a solicitor or of a witness shall be
allowed in any case where the amount claimed is paid without
further proceedings, nor where notice of intention to apply for
time to pay the tithe-ownerâs claim has been given (except in
cases where costs could be allowed by the Court on a judgment
summons), and when notice of opposition has been given within
the prescribed time, the costs of a solicitor shall only be allowed
for work done subsequent to the notice.

Rating of owner of tithe rentcharge.

VI.â(1) Any rate to which tithe rentcharge is subject shall
be assessed on and may be recovered from the owner of the tithe
rentcharge, in the like manner and by the like process as on
and from any occupying ratepayer; and so much of any Act
as authorises any rate on tithe rentcharge to be assessed on or
recovered from the occupier of any lands out of which the tithe
rentcharge issues is hereby repealed.

(2) If the collector of the rate satisfies the County Court that
he is unable to recover in manner aforesaid any rate assessed on
[232]

the owner of any tithe rentcharge, the Court may, after such
service on the owners of the tithe rentcharge, and of the lands out
of which the tithe rentcharge issues, as may be prescribed, and
after hearing such owners, if they appear and desire to be heard,
order the owner of the lands to pay such tithe rentcharge to the
collector until the amount of the rate, and any costs allowed by
the Court, are fully paid; and the order may be executed as if it
were an order under this Act for the payment of a sum due on
account of the tithe rentcharge.

(3) The Court may, if satisfied that the circumstances justify it,
make such order as aforesaid in respect of any future rate, either
generally or during the time limited by the order.

(4) The expression ârateâ in this section means a poor rate,
highway rate, general district rate, borough rate, and every other
rate assessed on an owner of tithe rentcharge by a public authority
for public purposes; and the expression âcollectorâ means the
overseer, surveyor of highways, rate-collector, or other person
authorised, for the time being, to collect the rate.

Power of appeal.

VII. If any party in any action or matter under this Act shall be
dissatisfied with the determination or direction of the judge of the
County Court in point of law or equity, or upon the admission or
rejection of any evidence, the party aggrieved by the judgment,
direction, decision, or order of the judge may appeal from the
same to the High Court, in such manner and subject to such
conditions as may be for the time being provided by the rules of
the Supreme Court regulating the procedure on appeals from
inferior courts to the High Court.

[233]

Remission of tithe rentcharge when exceeding two-thirds annual
value of land.

VIII.â(1) Where a sum is claimed on account of tithe rentcharge
issuing out of any lands, and the County Court is satisfied
that, if the sum claimed is paid, the total amount paid on account
of the tithe rentcharge for the period of twelve months next preceding
the day on which the sum claimed became payable, will exceed
two-thirds of the annual value of the lands as ascertained and
entered in the assessment for the purpose of Schedule B. to the
Income Tax Act, 1853,
[294]
or as certified as hereinafter mentioned,
the Court shall order the remission of so much, whether the whole
or part of the sum claimed, as is equal to the excess, and the
amount so ordered to be remitted shall not be recoverable; and
if the Court is satisfied that neither such remission, nor the
liability thereto, has been taken into account in estimating the
rateable value of the tithe rentcharge, the Court may remit such
amount of any then current rate assessed on the owner of the
tithe rentcharge as appears to the Court to be proportionate to the
amount of the remission of tithe rentcharge.

(2) Where the lands out of which any tithe rentcharge issues
are assessed for the purposes of the said Schedule B. together with
other lands, the surveyor of taxes for the parish in which the lands
are so assessed, on the application of the owner or occupier of the
lands, shall divide the annual value in such assessment between
the lands out of which any tithe rentcharge issues and the other
lands, and give notice of the annual value of the lands as determined
on such division to the applicant and to the owner of the
tithe rentcharge; and if either of them is dissatisfied with the
annual value so determined, he may appeal to the general commissioners
[234]

of income tax for the division in which the lands are
assessed, and those commissioners, after due notice to and
hearing the parties or their agents if any of them wishes to be so
heard, shall finally determine the proper division of the annual
value; and the annual value of lands so determined as aforesaid
shall, for the purposes of this section, be the annual value of the
lands as ascertained for the purpose of the said Schedule B.

(3) For the purposes of this section the owner of tithe rentcharge
shall have the same right of appeal as the owner of lands,
whether under the enactments relating to the said assessment or
under this section.

(4) If in any case the annual value of any lands is not ascertained
and entered in the assessment for the purpose of the said
Schedule B., the general commissioners of income tax for the
division in which the lands are situate shall, on the application of
the owner or occupier of the lands, ascertain the annual value of
the lands for the purpose of the said Schedule B., and inform the

Remark on the Tithe Act, 1891.

I. i. The main principle of this Act, is that the tithe rentcharge
is in future payable by the owner of the lands and not by
the occupier, unless he is also owner. The same principle
existed in the Tithe Commutation Act of 1836. But unfortunately
the 80th section of that Act, out of which landlords contracted
themselves, says that âany tenant who shall pay any
such rentcharge, shall be entitled to deduct the amount thereof
from the rent payable by him to his landlord, and shall be allowed
the same in account with his landlord.â Very few tenants deducted
[239]

the tithes from their rents according to this section. It
therefore became the general practice for the tenants in their
leases or agreements, to agree to pay certain rents to the landlord,
and also the tithe rentcharge to the tithe-owner. This Act
carries out the intention of the Commutation Act in making the
landowners liable to the payment of the tithe rentcharge. The
Lords made a wise addition to subsection 1, viz. that, âAny contract
made between an occupier and owner of lands
after
the
passing of this Act, for the payment of tithe rentcharge by the
occupier,
shall be void
.â The Bill on leaving the Commons, provided,
in subsection 2, for contracts made
before
the passing of
this Act, but made no provision against contracts made
after
the
passing of the Act, thus leaving the door open to contracts
which may be made
after
the passing of the Act.

The owner of the lands is now the collector of the tithe-owner.
And the great advantages which the tithe-owner derives from this
Act increase the market value of the rentcharge fully 25 per
cent; and it will materially increase the value of the rentcharge
when redeemed.

I. 3. It gives power to the owner to distrain for the sum
equivalent to the tithe rentcharge paid by the owner of the lands
and due by the occupier under a contract made previous to the
passing of this Act, according to section 85 of the Act of 1836.
The present Act thus transfers the unpopular system of distraint
from the tithe-owner to the owner of the lands. No doubt section
85 was framed with a view of preventing tenants escaping payment
by removing produce and stock from one field to another.

II. 1. To recover the tithe rentcharge through the County
Court is new machinery. It is a new buffer between the tithe-owner
and tithe-payer; it removes all immediate friction between
the clergyman and his tithe-paying tenant. The subject of
[240]

âfeesâ and âcosts,â was the most contentious point in passing
the Bill through Committee of the House of Commons. The
Lords introduced the amendment, that âcostsâ should be recovered
as in the case of an ordinary action in the County Court.
This amendment will be extremely irritating to the small landowners,
especially in Wales. It will also be a fruitful source of
irritation to tithe-payers and of legal persecution by tithe-owners
through their agents. The Lordsâ amendment, introduced by
Lord Selborne, was truly compared by Sir William Harcourt
to âtares sown among wheat.â The Tithe Act of 1836 gave
21 days to the occupier to pay his tithe after it had fallen due,
but this Act gives three months to the owners of the lands. This
is a reasonable time, for the landlord has often to wait six months
and even longer for his rents.

II. 2. By this, the tithe-owner can, in default of payment on
distraint, take possession of the lands, and derive all the advantages
of the tillage, and keep possession for years without rendering
any compensation to the occupier. This is but one of the
many cases which show that the Act was wholly framed in the
interest of the tithe-owner, and disadvantageous to the tithe-payer.
The security and stringent means for recovering tithe
rentcharge are all advantages to the tithe-owner.

II. 5. The tithe-owner has a prior claim to all other creditors.

II. 9. The owner of the lands, or the occupier, cannot be
imprisoned for non-payment of the tithe rentcharge, but may be
fined or imprisoned as regards other matters in the execution of
County Court warrants.

IV. The object which the framers of this section in the
House of Lords had in view was to prevent collusion, as stated
in their debates, between the owner of the lands and the
[241]

occupying tenant. They based the assertion on the groundless
assumption that certain landowners and farmers would enter
into a conspiracy to defraud the tithe-owner. This discovery
was reserved for the Lords. So section 4 contradicts section 1
subsection 1. The last proviso in section 4 was added by the
House of Commons to protect the occupier by giving him a
remedy against the landowner. The landowner may have been
impecunious, and therefore let his land free of rent for some
years, on condition that the tenant should erect certain buildings
on the farm or put the farm and fences into better order; or he
may let his lands for a sum down with a small rental; or the lands
may have been let on beneficial leases on payment of a fine
with a small reserve rental. But all these are common arrangements
without any reference to collusion. The Lords, however,
thought differently. But the most important point for consideration
is, that this section upsets the main principle of the Act,
namely, that the landowner, and not the occupier, should pay
the tithe rentcharge. This section makes the latter pay it under
certain circumstances, but which he can recover from his landlord
in the manner stated.

VI. 1. In consequence of a decision in the Law Courts, if a
tithe-owner should make default in payment of rates, as many
have done, the only remedy for the collector was to recover from
the occupier for a debt which was none of his; and the only
remedy which the occupier had for this payment was to recover
it from his landlord; and the landlord was to recover it from the
tithe-owner. Here was a remarkable roundabout way to recover
payment of rates from the proper personâthe tithe-owner. Many
tithe-owners, in order to annoy and irritate rate-collectors and
tithe-payers, would not pay the rates. They knew well and took
advantage of the legal ruling, and so they would not pay until
[242]

rate-collectors, tithe-payers, and landlords, had to go through the
above legal process to get payment of the rates from them. And
so this subsection was framed in order to put a stop to such conduct
on the part of tithe-owners, who are now bound to pay the
rates, and it also repeals any part of any Act which authorizes
payment from the occupier of rates on tithe rentcharge.

VIII. 1. This is generally called the âRelief Clause.â Quite
a
misnomer
. This paltry relief was given for the great benefits
and advantages which the tithe-owners derive from this Act.
The relief will affect only a few farms in each county. In estimating
the annual value of the lands, the valuable building
erected will be taken in the valuation, and so tend to diminish
the amount of remission of tithe rentcharge.

The disclosures made in the Tithe Commutation Return of
1887 (Lord Wolmerâs) as regards the extent of the prebendal and
other separate estates, are most astonishing. The four principal
officersâDean, Precentor, Chancellor, and Treasurerâof certain
cathedrals, were endowed with separate estates in tithes and
lands, in addition to their shares of the Chapter properties.
Then the prebendal estates were in the aggregate enormous. I
am now dealing only with tithe property. And it is well to
remark again that we should add one-half of the commuted
value to the commuted value in order to ascertain the original
tithe value, according to Sir John Cairdâs opinion, that the commuted
value of tithes = 4 millions, was 2 millions less than the
tithe value = 6 millions. I must also remark, that the rentals
of the episcopal, capitular and prebendal tithes, were only one-third
[249]

their rack-rental value, because the owners had for centuries
let all their properties on beneficial leases for years, or on
lives for one-third their rack-rental value. The lessees retained
the other two-thirds. The tithe-payers had to pay them their
tithes in full. In 1835, appeared, for the first time since the
reign of Henry VIII., an official Parliamentary Report of the
revenues of the Church. The creation of the Ecclesiastical
Commission in 1836, and the passing of the Cathedral Act of
1840, led to investigations as to the actual rack-rental value of
the episcopal, capitular, and prebendal properties. The leasehold
property with which the Act of 1840 vested the Commissioners
was ascertained to be only one-third of its rack-rental
value, and it was also found that the same remark applied
to all the church properties which were let on beneficial leases.
This was a vital discovery. The Commissioners set about their
Herculean work of enfranchising all the leasehold estates in
order that they should obtain for the Church, the two-thirds
which the wealthy lessees were receiving. The leases for years
are of course long ago in possession of the Commissioners; but
a great many leases for lives are still running on, although it is
now fifty-one years since the Act of 1840 was passed.

It was never anticipated by Sir Robert Peel, Lord Russell,
and other Church reformers, that the net income of the Common
Fund of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners would be over one
million per annum. Any person who would have said so then
would have been considered insane. In 1840 the idea of enfranchising
all the leasehold property of the church was not for one
moment thought of, and if it were, that it could never be realized.

Without going into the history of the Ecclesiastical Commission,
it is essentially necessary to state that this Commission
has cleared away, as far as public patronage is concerned with
[250]

Acts of Parliament, the gross, yes, the disgraceful waste of
church endowments. For instance, the present Archdeacon of
Surrey, instead of receiving about Â£6,000 a year, of which
Â£4,539 came from the tithe-rent charges, has a canonry in
Winchester Cathedral, gross income Â£1,000 per annum, and the
vicarage of Frensham, with net income Â£400 and house. An
Order in Council divided, respecting vested interests, the Archdeaconâs
enormous income among poor benefices and endowed
new churches in the parishes where the tithes arose. This is a
good specimen of all the operations of the Commissioners.
Incumbents possessing enormous incomes, whose benefices were
in public patronage, have been dealt with by Orders in Council,
and by private Acts of Parliament, in a similar manner, on the
next avoidances, when the new incumbents were appointed, on
very reduced incomes, and the residue divided among the poorer
incumbents in the same parishes. Then as regards the episcopal,
capitular, and prebendal revenues, the Commissioners allow the
bishops and chapters their incomes as set forth in Acts of Parliament
and Orders in Council, and with the residue of the immense
property, they satisfy local claims of parishes where the tithes
arose or landed estates were situate. As for the prebendal properties,
separate estates of capitular offices, sinecure rectories
and dissolved canonries, the Cathedral Act of 1840 vested them
in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for the good of the Common
Fund, but Parliament allowed local claims on the tithes only. In
a subsequent Act (1860), the local claims were extended, rather
unwisely, to all kinds of church property. Hence we find many
country parishes, with a population of a few hundreds, richly
endowed and furnished with comfortable, well-built parsonages.
The incumbents claim this by virtue of the extension clause of
the local claims. The Commissioners have therefore been
[251]

bound to satisfy local claims of hundreds of parishes with populations
varying from 150 to 300, while the teeming populations
of the town parishes have to go without help from the above
resources. About Â£360,000 per annum has been given out of
the Common Fund to satisfy local claims up to 1890. The Commissioners
were opposed to this extension clause, and it was not
in the Bill, but was inserted and carried by members of Parliament
after the Bill was introduced, who had churches on their
own estates, and in their neighbourhood, where large church
endowments existed. The clause included all the landed estates
and house property of the bishops, chapters, prebendaries, sinecure
rectories, etc. In London there are lamentable cases of small
incomes in parishes where there are no local claims, and large
incomes of adjacent parishes, arising from local claims.

For example, the Finsbury estate in London consists of three
acres of land, which were given, in the fourteenth century, by a
layman to St. Paulâs for the support of one prebendary. The
Corporation of London leased this estate from the dean and
chapter, and built valuable houses upon it. The Act of 1840
vested this property, on the expiration of the lease, in the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners. In 1867 the lease expired, and
the Commissioners came into possession of Â£60,000
per annum

from the rentals of this property. By the Act of 1840, there
would be no local claim, for none of this revenue came from
tithes. But by the Act of 1860, there was a local claim. Hence
eighteen district churches within the parish had their incumbentsâ
incomes raised to Â£500 a year each; new costly parsonage
houses were erected, and large annual sums are allowed to the
churchwardens of all these churches for the church services and
repair of churches. But not a shilling was given to the poor
incumbents in the adjacent populous parochial districts.

Column 1 indicates that nearly one-half of the parochial tithes
in England and Wales were appropriated to archbishops, bishops,
chapters, monasteries, colleges, etc. There are 8,856 old parishes
in England and Wales. Columns 2, 3, and 4 give the number of
appropriated rectories, total 3,985. So we have 3,985 old parishes
deprived of their rectorial tithes. Who have these? Column 2 are
archbishops, bishops, chapters, vicars-choral, and archdeacons.
Column 3 are what are sometimes called âLay Rectors,â
i.e.
, impropriated
rectors, namely, lay persons in receipt of rectorial tithes,
resulting from the dissolution of monasteries and the dispersion of
their tithes by the Crown to laymen. Columns 3 and 4 are lay
persons receiving tithes from 2,417 parishes, amounting to gross
[256]

Â£962,390, or nearly a million a year. Appendices A, B, and C,
give the rectors in column 2. Appendix D gives the 321 in
column 4. As regards column 3, the tithe-rent charges are dealt
with as private property, and as such is constantly changing
hands by sales or otherwise.

In columns 6 and 7, 3,985 appropriated and impropriated
rectors of the old parishes employed 2,916 vicars. But column
6, or 347 parishes, have vicars, but no rectors.
[306]
Again, the
1,568 clerical rectors in column 2 employed only 1,176 vicars,
and the remaining 392 parishes had no vicars. Again, the
2,096 impropriated rectors in column 3 employed only 1,525
vicars, and the remaining 564 parishes had none. Again, the 321
college, etc., rectors employed 207 vicars, and the remaining 102
parishes had none.

I refer the reader to the summary of tithe-rent charges at page
253. (1) The Clerical Appropriators having Â£681,695, number
1,568. They are classified in Appendices A, B, and C. (2) The
Parochial Incumbents receiving Â£2,415,040, consist of rectors,
4,524 + 3,263 vicars = 7,787. (3) Lay Impropriators receive
Â£766,334; they number 2,096. (4) Schools, colleges, etc.,
receive Â£196,055; they number 321, and are classified in Appendix
D, page 247.

[257]

APPENDIX H.

Lands and Money Payments in Lieu of Tithes.

The number of parishes in which awards were made under the
Inclosure Acts, in 29 counties, was 989.

To 9,845 are added 200 benefices in London, Canterbury, Isle
of Man, etc., which receive tithe-taxes from houses, also fixed and
variable incomes from commuted tithes. Therefore, 10,045
benefices derive incomes from tithes. The total number of benefices
is 13,979. Of the remaining 3,934, 464 are not endowed
with tithes or glebes, and 3,470 were formed between
A.D.
1818
and
A.D.
1890. As regards the 9,845 parishes, it is important to
notice that the tithes of one-half or 4,886 in England and Wales,
were
impropriated
, that is,
alienated
from the parishes, and 4,959
were
not alienated
.

The total number of beneficed clergy in England, Wales, Isle
of Man and Channel Islands, may be taken as 13,979 (as very
few benefices are now held in plurality), viz., England 13,048,
Wales 856, Isle of Man 34, Channel Islands 41. In the census
of 1881, the number of
civil parishes
was stated to be 14,926,
hence 947 were consolidated. The benefice may consist of one
or many parishes united. For example, at page 192, there are 43
parishes united into 11 benefices, so 13,979 benefices mean about
15,000 parishes. 11,667 benefices have parsonage houses, 2,312
have not.

Its capitalized value is about Â£140,000,000.

The return deals only with the
permanent sources
of revenues.
Hence it omits fees, pew-rents and Easter offerings. The return
was made from values in 1886. The Commissionersâ own gross
income in 1890 was Â£1,320,000, and not Â£1,247,827. The
gross income of the beneficed clergy is by this return Â£4,810,662
or gross Â£344 a year each, net Â£262. To find net income, I
have allowed Â£1,140,000 to cover depreciation and expenses out
of Â£2,592,000 tithe-rent charge, 1890.

The total
rateable
value of the episcopal, capitular and parsonage
houses = Â£11,151 + Â£18,928 + Â£518,054 respectively =
Â£548,133. The rack-rental value is about Â£800,000 a year.

Dealing with the fluctuating part of the beneficed clergyâs income,
we may safely estimate fees, pew-rents and Easter offerings
at Â£1,000,000 a year. In arriving at this amount I have been
guided by certain well-known official data. (1) The average fluctuating
incomes of the 115 rectors in the old parish of Manchester
were, for 1890, Â£142 each. (2) The 987 benefices of Wales and
Monmouth had, in 1890, Â£10 each. My conclusion, therefore, is
that 4,600 benefices get, like Manchester, Â£653,000; 4,600 get
Â£300,000; and 4,779 get the Welsh rate, viz., Â£48,000. Total,
Â£1,000,000. It varies from one to one and a half millions a year.

In 1890 we may safely take the following as the correct gross
aggregate revenues of the beneficed clergy:âÂ£3,941,057 +
Â£272,605 + Â£617,000 (C.F.) + Â£1,000,000 = Â£5,830,662 or
Â£415 each; net Â£334 calculated like the net Â£262 above. But
Â£6,000,000 a year for the 13,979 incumbents is nearer the truth.
Add to 11,667 with parsonages, a rental of Â£52 a year for house =
net average for each of the 11,667 Â£386. We have, at last, a
correct idea of the
immense wealth
of the beneficed clergy alone.

Matth. Paris, under
A.D.
1240, has these words: âCum ex auctoritatibus

since, by the authority of the Holy Fathers, the revenues of the church were
appropriated to the definite use of the church,â p. 139. There he stops, and
omits,
ministers and poor
. The rectors of Reading referred to the tripartite
division of their revenues, viz., to the church, ministers and poor. But it did
not suit Fuller to give a fair, complete translation of the passage, because it
referred to the tripartite division of the church revenues.

It is important to note (1) that Edgarâs law gave the manorial priests a
legal right to one-third part of the tithes; (2) that the bishops in apportioning
the permanent endowment of the vicar-perpetual, by 4 Hen. IV., ch. xii. (1402),
were guided by Edgarâs law in appropriating one-third part and selecting the
small tithes, to which, if insufficient, they added a portion of the great tithes;
(3) that the vicar, who previously held his position at the will of the patron,
had by this Act obtained a freehold permanent position for life; (4) that 8,500
vicars now beneficed have been so circumstanced by Acts of Parliament.

These parishes are united to other parishes. 41 parishes out of the 86
are united thusâ

(1) Numbers 1, 6, and 23 = 4 parishes, are united under one rector, whose
net aggregate annual income = Â£800; total population, 481.

(2) Numbers 2, 29, 40, and 47 = 7 ditto; rectorâs ditto = Â£1,060 and house;
population, 661.

(3) Number 3 and Bridewell = 2 ditto; rectorâs ditto = Â£450 H; pop., 2,163.

(4) Number 4 and S. Peter-le-Poer = 2 ditto; rectorâs ditto = Â£1,000; pop.,
1,200.

(5) Numbers 5 and 30 = 3 ditto; rectorâs ditto = Â£582 and house; pop., 432.

(6) Numbers 8 and 43 = 3 ditto; rectorâs ditto = Â£680 H; pop., 474.

(7) Numbers 12 and 44 = 3 ditto; rectorâs ditto = Â£568; pop., 1,200.

(8) Numbers 16 and 39 = 5 ditto; rectorâs ditto = Â£810; pop., 272.

(9) Numbers 22 and 38 = 4 ditto; rectorâs ditto = Â£840 H; pop., 285.

(10) Numbers 24, 45 and 46 = 6 ditto; rectorâs ditto = Â£660 and house;
pop., 297.

(11) Numbers 32 and 50 = 4 ditto; rectorâs ditto = Â£600 H; pop., 360.

11 incumbents = 43 parishes = Â£8,050 = 7,163 population.

S. Peter-le-Poer and Bridewell included above are not in the Fire Acts.

The total incomes of the 37 incumbents from the 86 Fire parishes were in
1890, Â£22,852; aggregate population, 12,000.

By the revised Fire Act of 1804, Â£12,241 of the Â£22,852, comes from the
Fire rates paid by the ratepayers of these parishes; the balance, Â£10,611,
comes from ground-rents and house-rents of properties which belong to the
incumbents of the respective parishes.

The average
net
annual income of each of the 37 incumbents was, in 1890,
Â£642, for an average population of 572, or Â£1 2s. per head, including children.

(
a
) S. Michael, Cornhill, has over Â£700 a year from house rentals; (
b
) the
present rector of S. Peterâs, Cornhill, has Â£2,500 a year from rentals of two
houses on glebe estate, out of which he pays Â£300 a year net to S. James,
Dukeâs Place; he has also Â£200 from Fire Act;
i.e.
, Â£2,400 a year for 196
parishioners including children. On next avoidance the Â£2,200 will be
divided into five shares; he gets one; and four other benefices get Â£440 each.
His income will then be Â£440 + Â£200 by Fire Act = Â£640. (
c
) The rector of
S. Edmund the King and S. Nicholas Acons has a net income of Â£1,150, for
222 parishioners; viz., Â£300 by Fire Act and Â£850 from ground-rents and
interest on Â£18,000, the price of a house sold belonging to the benefice [see
26th Report, p. 86, of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners].

copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
works.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

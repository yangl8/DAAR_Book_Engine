TO WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT, ESQ.

OF NEW-YORK.

Sir
:âWhatever may be the particular
estimate set upon the intellectual character of the American
aborigines, or the decision had on the perplexing question of their
remote origin, or their actual and varying condition, few will dispute
the large share of interest which they have in the public mind. And
it is a species of interest which, I think we shall perceive, will be
found to assume a higher and more imaginative cast, connected with the
advancing state of letters and the fine arts, as we recede from the
historical era, when these tribes were confessedly the lords and rulers
of the land.

Their name and semblance are, in truth, infiltrated, if I may use a
chemical phrase, into the very elements of the American landscape,
which can hardly ever be contemplated without bringing out from the
latent depths of the imagination, the image of the lithe Indian, with
his Robin Hood arms and his picturesque costume. The policy which
an enlightened government and people ought to pursue towards them,
at all times, is a question that chiefly concerns the statesman and
the philanthropist. But there are a hundred subordinate questions
which come home for decision to the bosoms of all readers and
thinkers, travellers and writers, to whom the race itself, viewed as
a broken link in the ethnological chain, is a fruitful theme, both
for retrospection and for actual observation. I have indeed, myself,
participated largely in this field of observation, and may with truth
affirm, that I return to society, after completing a period of but
little short of four and twenty years in their territories.

How far the interest of these reminiscences of a noble race are
realized, or communicated in the following tale, I cannot pretend
to predict. But if I may rely on the American press, and it is an
authority which, in this instance, is sustained abroad, there are
few persons who are so well qualified to judge of success in this
particular as yourself. This consideration would plead a justification
for the liberty I take, of addressing the present sketch to you; but it
is a liberty which I should hardly venture on, were I not,

Very truly yours,
The Author
.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The treaty of Ghent, concluded in the autumn of 1814, terminated the
contest then existing between the United States and Great Britain,
although it was not promulgated in time to arrest one of the severest
battles of the war. In this contest, as in all prior ones of a general
character, subsequent to the settlement of European nations in the new
world, the native tribes were deeply involved. Indeed, it was under the
influence of an extraordinary prophetic delusion, that it may be said
to have commenced, on their part, on the plains of Tippecanoe.

If the opening of this renewed struggle for supremacy by the aborigines
in 1811, on the banks of the Wabash, had the effect to bring on the
stage of action a noted warrior, in the person of Tecumthe,
[1]

who certainly has had few equals as a military and political leader,
since the era of the prior stand made by the American tribes under
Pontiac; its onward events, and its, to them, disastrous close, drew
into prominent notice a scarcely less remarkable, and in some traits
superior, character, under the name of Tuscaloosa, or the Black
Warrior. This man, from his personal courage, skill, and activity,
absorbed the full confidence of his tribe; and to him was, in effect,
committed the cause of the Indian war in the south, until the date of
his voluntary personal surrender to the American commander, after the
power of his nation had been crushed in a series of sanguinary battles,
and a price set upon his head.

[Pg 2]

It was the race of the Muscogees, who, under the popular name of
Creeks, opposed the most strenuous opposition to the arms of the United
States. This nation, in its numerous clans and subdivisions, were, at
the period, strong in their numbers, and confident in their strength.
These clans, influenced and misled by foreign counsel, were seated
in their original vallies, forests, and fastnesses, in the remoter
slopes and spurs of the Southern Alleghanies, stretching towards the
gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi, but were found to have their chief
point of military supply in Florida, then under the dominion of Spain,
into which the operations of the war were eventually and necessarily
transferred. It was in this manner that the Seminoles, who have since
made so protracted a stand, first drew upon themselves the force of the
American arms.

The present tale, in which fiction builds itself upon these general
facts, turns upon the contest of the Muscogees, their exertions, their
discomfitures, and their final fall. It opens at a distant point, many
degrees towards the north, within a short period after the close of
the Creek war. It occupies two days and two nights in its action. The
idea here brought forward of uniting or intermingling the dramatic,
with the narrative and descriptive, is believed to be well adapted to
topics of this character, in which the natural bent of the natives
for declamation and mystic romance may be indulged, while the time
of the action, it is conceived, may be thereby curtailed, and verbal
description retrenched. The measure is thought to be not ill adapted
to the Indian mode of enunciation. Nothing is more characteristic of
their harangues and public speeches, than that vehement, yet broken and
continued strain of utterance, which would be subject to the charge of
monotony, were it not varied by an extraordinary compass in the stress

[Pg 3]

of voice, broken by the repetition of high and low accent, and often
terminated with an exclamatory vigor, which is sometimes startling.
It is not the less in accordance with these traits, that nearly every
initial syllable of the measure chosen, is under accent. This at least
may be affirmed, that it imparts a movement to the narrative, which, at
the same time that it obviates languor, favors that repetitious rhythm,
or pseudo-parallelism, which so strongly marks their highly compound
lexicography.

Of the theme itself, nothing further is requisite to be said. The
tale was written, as it now stands, in 1826, with a few exceptions of
earlier date; and it may be added, that it was among the
agremens

of the writerâs seclusion, while he was living in a public capacity,
within the impressive scenes, and among the manly tribes, in the lake
region described. That its publication should have been deferred until
the author had seen cause to resume the original orthography of the
initial syllable of his patronymic name, may render it proper further
to add, in this connection, that the change from School, and resumption
of Col, in the adjective syllable of the name, is in strict conformity
with family tradition, supported by recent observation in England. In
the latter country, however, the name is uniformly written Cal, however
it may be pronounced.

[Pg 5]

INTRODUCTORY STANZAS.

Stretched on his couch, the Indian warrior lay,

His bow and quiver prostrate at his side,

Revolving all his fate in still dismay,

Dominion lost, skill baffled, power defied.

âShades of my fathers!â thus his reverie ran,

âAnd shall the Red Man thus, in clouds decline,

With no memorial of his name or clan,

Or only left to point the poetâs line,

And tell to other years, the tale of his decline?â

âOh, is it thus, the noble woodswise race,

Shall steal away to an unhonored tomb,

Who once were lords of the ascendant chase,

And swept the forests in their pristine bloom?

Brave were their hearts, and strong in sinewy strength

They drew the shaft that fellâd the stately deer,

Or spread the craven foeman at his length,

And triumphed in the battleâs wild career,

A wanderer of the woodsâlord of the bow and spear.â

âAh tell me, Spirit of the Golden West!

Say, is it want of knowledge dooms my race?

Or the wild passions of an untamed breast,

That leaves nor peace nor virtue there a place?

Can raging tumults of the mortal soul

[Pg 6]

Prejudge its fate, and lead the wayward mind

Through seas of want and poverty to roll,

Till in a gloom of fixed despair it find

Lifeâs path without a friend, and even death unkind?â

âDoth human rectitude, in mind and heart,

The inward purposes of right and wrong

In human actsâso great a boon impart,

Or lead, by their neglect, to thraldom strong?

And can it be, ye messengers of air!

Who know the great high Spiritâs sovâreign will,

So vast a detriment he can prepare

For those who follow natureâs dictates still,

And worship Manitoes on every breezy hill?â

ââTis wondrous all, and yet there are, I ween,

Some inward inklings of the Indian soul

That whisper to his mind of things unclean,

That taint his rites, and all his life control,

Leading the mindâwhenever he would do

An evil act, or eâen the purpose form,

To that High Excellence beyond the view,

Who guides the sun and regulates the storm,

Dispensing winter winds, or summer breezes warm.â

âAnd is this conscience? So the white man tells,

Pointing to letters as the star-light kind,

That manâs own heart to man himself reveals,

And warms and renovates the wandering mind,

Impels the hand to drop the bloody blade,

And seek support from artâs more kindly cares,

Where genial fields invite the plough and spade,

[Pg 7]

And industry her golden wreath prepares,

And peace and joy and health, the household circle shares.â

âBut whyâand here my doubts and fears ariseâ

Why are kind precepts of such angel forms

All bleared by acts that sunder friendshipâs ties,

And overcast our atmosphere with storms;

Our lands despoiled by arts, we know not how,

Erst in the solemn council we convene,

But ere we note the hour, the white manâs plough,

Driven reckless through each quiet hamlet scene,

While steel-armed horsemen, stand as guards between?â

âAnd whenceâif we must acts by precepts tryâ

Whence all the new-found ills that mar our life,

The liquid fire of distillation high,

That whelms our bands in most unseemly strife,

And oft our maddening blood, unruled before,

Stains with its purple tide our utmost lands?

Is this benignly meant? say, ye who teachâ

Or be there few that aim to overreach?

Ah, do not outward acts most eloquently preach?â

Such is the race, whose deeds of scaith and strife,

The muse essays in numbers to review,

In that dark hour of opening peril rife,

When late to arms the Southern war chiefs flew,

Albeit, misguided in their warlike ires,

By foreign counsels cast with cruel ken,

And war, through all their borders, lit his fires,

Transferring ruin to the peaceful glen,

And woe to many a band of noble hunter men.

A tent on the open shores of Lake
Superiorâa camp-fireâcanoes turned up on the beachâboatmen engaged
in cooking. A conference at the tent-door. Ethwald, a traveller.
Oscar, a missionary. De la Joie, a trader. Mongazid (Azid), an Indian

Timeâsun-set.]

ETHWALD.

Hoary
hunter, stern and wild,

Natureâs lone forsaken child!

Wandâring born and wandâring bred,

Forest schoolâd and forest fedâ

Turn thy quick revolving glance,

Oâer yon waterâs bright expanse.

Seeâalong the purple sky,

See the billows looming high;

Not in rage as (if aright

Men report the wild affright,)

[Pg 10]

Oft with fear too sorely true,

Thy adventârous kinsmen view,

But with long and labâring swells,

That of lulling tempest tells;

Seest thou? near the horizon dim,

Shadowy form upon its brim,

Dun and smallâthat closer scannâd,

Main and margin, should be land.

Tell!âfor by thy lifted eye,

Well I ken thou readâst the skyâ

Tell me!âin its shadowy forms

Is there sunshineâis there storms?

Seest thou there, a spirit mild,

Or the fiend of waters wild,

Who shall make to-morrowâs wave,

Many a hapless hunterâs grave,

And along the yellow strand,

Raise their mounds amid the sand?

Or to thy well-practised eye,

Is the god of south winds nigh,

With his soft, ethereal balms,

Whispâring peace and breathing calms?

Say, shall mortal blade essay,

Oâer yon waves a tranquil way

On the morrowâspirit blest!

Shall it speed toward the west,

[Pg 11]

And the genii of the strand,

Waft the ventârous bark from land,

With a breeze and with a smile,

To yon dim-discovered isle?

MONGAZID.
[2]

Listen, white man! go not there;

Unseen spirits stalk the air!

Though the sky be clear and calm,

And the south-west winnow balmâ

Though each wave be smooth and fair,

Be thou cautionedâgo not there!

Misty forms, that walk the wind,

Guard the treasures there enshrined;

Hungry birds their influence lend,

Snakes defy, and kites defend:

There, the star-eyed panther prowls,

And the wolf in hunger howls;

There, the speckled adder breeds,

And the mighty canieu feeds;

Spirits prompt themâfiends inciteâ

They are eager for the fight,

And are thirsting, night and day,

On the human heart to prey:

[Pg 12]

Be they gods, or be they not,

Touch not thou the sacred spot.

ETHWALD.

Tell me, red man! old and hoar,

Dweller on Igomeeâs
[3]
shore!

Wherefore bound by spell or wile,

Spirit guarded, is yon isle?

Is there not embowelled there

Many a gem of lustre rareâ

Glow there not, in hidden mine,

Jewel stones of ray divineâ

Ore resplendentâcrystal bright,

That illume the cavern-night?

Or, along the mystic strand,

Massy piles of golden sand?

Tell me, hunter! wilt thou not

Guide me to the treasurâd spot?

Arms, with Europeâs skill prepared,

Shall the daring deed reward;

Bands shall deck thee, feathers bless,

And the pride of Albion dress,

With Columbiaâs banner wide,

And a chieftainâs plate beside.

[Pg 13]

MONGAZID.

Listen, white man! Moons have past

Since this earth was all a waste:

Rains had drenched itâthunders rentâ

Winds demolishedâwaters spentâ

And the ocean, black and still,

Slumbered deep oâer every hill,

And not one lingâring beam of light

Illumâd the vast and sullen night.

âTwas then the spirit of the sky,

In mercy hung yon lamps on highâ

Sun, moon and starsâand by their light

Expelled the dread chaotic night:

Then clothed he hills and vales with trees,

And stated bounds to lakes and seas;

Then sent he bird and beast in woods,

And fish in all our limpid floods,

And creatures small, of foot and wing,

And every living, breathing thing:â

Last sent he manâ(a barbârous race,

From whom my long descent I trace,)

As lord oâer allâand thus benign,

Addressed the parent of our line.

To thee I give these smiling woods,

These lofty hills, and peopled floods,

[Pg 14]

Filled with all needful game, and blest

For thy maintainance, peace and rest.

I give thee bow, I give thee spear,

To dart the fish, and fell the deer;

I give thee bark full light to sweep

Oâer the broad stream and billowy deep;

I give thee skins for thy attire;

To shade thee, woods; to warm thee, fire;

More needâst thou not, nor covet more,

And peace her joys shall round thee pour.

But touch not gold; the tempter fly,

Or all thy kin shall droop and die;

For in that potent evil pent,

Lurk envy, pain, and discontent;

And luxuryâof life the baneâ

And woe, with all her haggard train.

Listen, white man! Dreamest thou

My soul could eâer descend so low,

To sell my country, life, and line,

For any frail reward of thine?

Or break the Sire-of-lifeâs command,

By treading yonder sacred strand?

My fare is scant; my roof is low;

My country cold, and deep my woe,

[Pg 15]

And every moon that gilds yon hill,

Sees growing want and growing ill!

But scantier still must be my meal,

And keener woes my bosom feel,

A sharper winter chill our sky,

And louder tempests rage on high,

Gaunt famine howl along the plain,

And every limb be rackâd with pain,

Ere I compromit heavenâs decree,

By touching gold, or guiding thee.

ETHWALD.

Man of the woods! thy fancies seem

Like some distemperâd midnight dream;

Wild and devoid of reason. Vain

Are all thy fears of gold or gain!

Not more vain the infantâs call

To the starry skies to fall;

Or the fear this ocean-lake

Oâer yon cliffs its way shall take,

If a single pebble-trace

Circles in its glassy face.

MONGAZID.

Wealth is a curse, our old men said,

[Their wisdom speaks, though they be dead,]

[Pg 16]

Wealth is a curse, and all its trust

A breath of windâa heap of dust:

âTis hereââtis gone! told or untoldâ

And Mystery is my name for gold.

We have been pining, since we knew

The wonders ye could make it doâ

But find with cavil, years, and time,

It is the white manâs curse and crime.

Of old, our fathers held it good

To deal in shells, and rove the wood;

And had no fear of scaith or storm,

With food, and skins to keep them warm.

But ye, with your unhallowed gain,

Have burned our forests from the plain,

Causing our hopeâour gameâto fly,

And making life itself a lie.

ETHWALD.

Know! thou man of suffâring proud,

Ills that press, and woes that cloud!

Know, that gold doth hold a charm

Want to banish, care disarmâ

To dispel the fatherâs fears,

And suppress kind womanâs tears.

Gold ensures the ready meal,

And the joys the libâral feel,

[Pg 17]

In the palace, or the cot,

Famâd, applauded, or forgot.

Oft its peace-inspiring power

Gilds fair virtueâs evening hourâ

Oft, at stern-eyed powerâs command,

Renovates a drooping landâ

Opening, by a blest employ,

Founts of noble, lasting joy:

From its toil-impelling springs,

Commerce spreads her daring wings;

Art uprears the public dome,

Agriculture treads her loom,

And a thousand pleasures stand

To obey its potent wand.

It is not wealth that ills produceâ

So sages writeâbut its
abuse
.

MONGAZID.

Yet, is the sweet with bitter blent,

And all without that boonâcontent!

Else hadst thou not quit friend and home,

In these unmeasured wilds to roam;

Or boldly dared this forest-sea

For gains, that still thy grasp shall fleeâ

Or proffered me thy valued pelf

To sell my godsâmy peaceâmyself!

[Pg 18]

ETHWALD.

Thou wouldst shun the white manâs joy,

Lest there should be slight alloy:

Know, to mortal is not given

Joy unmixed, by righteous heaven:

Death and sorrow, toil and woe,

All must dread, and all must know.

But me thinks thy purpose stern,

That would neither teach nor learn,

Give nor guide, remit or feel,

Doth some
secret
power revealâ

Power that doth thy being sway,

And thou must, perforce, obey!

Is it pride of hunter fame,

Azidâs art, or Azidâs name?

Is it dread of fate severe,

Is it hope, or is it fear?

MONGAZID.

Fear of mortal shaft or ill,

Foemanâs ire or foemanâs skillâ

Dread of pain or dread of woe,

Azidâs heart can never know!

It hath breasted famine drear,

And the jagged flinty spear,

[Pg 19]

Warriorâs wrath, or wizardâs sign,

Nor doth dread the force of thine!

ETHWALD.

Wizard am I not, nor part,

Read or know of such foul art,

False and visionary. There,

Wrapt in his robes of holy care,

Behold yon pilgrim, early gray,

Companion of my toilsome way,

As now along the desert strand,

With sober tread, he marks the sandâ

Eâen now his lips the skies implore,

Thy long-lost people to restore;

To lead their steps where joys invite,

And love, and truth, and life, and light!

Disciple he, severe and high,

Of the great ruler of the sky,

To thee but known by thunders loud,

The rushing wind, the fire-lit cloud;

But to our fathers, sage and eld,

By holy word and book revealed.

If aught from fiend, or spiritâs wile

Thou fearest on the desert isle,

His simple, solemn, sacred prayâr

Shall guard and guide and bless thee there.

[Pg 20]

OSCAR.

The fear from which you fly, is thisâ

You would not
make
but
find
your bliss.

But so God ruleth not his people. He

Hath so hewn out our destiny,

And linked it with our own free will,

That means with ends must tally still.

The bliss for which you chase and roam,

You might more truly find at home,

If but one tittle of the time

You give to hunting, war, and crime,

Were turned, with simple, peaceful hand,

To stocks or grain upon the land.

Besides, in every good manâs view,

You worship nowâye know not who;

The very Power, which, dark of eye,

If seen, ye would most swiftly fly.

MONGAZID.

âTis well!
Thy
god will list to
thee
,

And thinkâst thou
mine
shall turn from
me
?

More may be vain: thee and thy crew

Fair skies oâershadowâfriend, adieu!

DE LA JOIE.

Hunter, stay; I have a gift,

Of such potence it shall lift

[Pg 21]

From thy brain, and from thy mind,

Every care of grosser kind,

Every latent, earthly woe,

Such as weary mortals know,

And induce the lifted soul

In one round of joy to roll.

It shall banish selfish care,

Change the fouler fate to fair,

And inspire, with visions high,

Thy sedate, prophetic eye.

Take this little vase; the draught

May be oft and freely quaffed,

By those only who have felt

Oft its sovereign power to melt,

Raise and gladden; but with care

Let thy lips the liquid share!

When the sun, with splendor bright,

Wakes the drowsy world with light,

Come thou hither, straight, and tell

If my gift be ill or well:

If my words thou findest trueâ

If such raptures may ensueâ

And, with new-found courage brave,

Thou wilt tempt with me the wave.

[Pg 22]

ETHWALD.

[
An attendant here introduces the pipe of peace.
]

Accept my pledge of purpose high,

That calls me to your northern sky.

Much have I heard, and longed to view

These spreading coasts, and waters blue,

These rosy skies, and beaming shores,

Replete with all their sylvan stores.

Nor less my interest in that race

Who poise the dart, and lead the chase;

And, with a pride of kin and sire,

Still light up here their council fire.

Tradition hath informed me well

Of deeds in which ye yet excel:

Your skill by water, rift and rock,

The war-path and the battleâs shock;

And all those arts, through which ye sing,

âI am the wild-woodâs subtle king.â

Take of my proffered pledge: we stand

Thus heart in heart, as hand in hand.

MONGAZID.

So be it, sire: the heavens turn black

On all who from this pledge draw back.

[Pg 23]

CANTO II.
THE SACRED ISLAND.
A DISCOVERY.

[
Scene.
The broad expanse of the Lake. An
assemblage of Indian canoes on the water. One, in advance, bearing the
national flag of the United States. Timeâmorning.]

The
golden sun with early ray,

Saw Ethwald on his ocean way,

With silent Azid for his guide,

And mission-father by his side:

His birchen vessel light and gay

Speeds swan-like oâer the liquid wayâ

The sky is calmâthe morning air

Scarce stirs that mass, so vast, so fairâ

That, like a sheet of waving gold,

The eye may not undimmâd behold;

Yet is there motionâbark and crew

Dance lightly on that ocean blue,

And ever, as up and down they ride

Upon that broad, eternal tide,

The strained sight descries the while,

Short glimpses of that holy isle,

Like dreams of bliss, that, fair and sheen,

Flit in the moment they are seen.

[Pg 24]

Nearer and nearer as they ply,

A gathering mist swells up the sky,

And every object, dun or fair,

Spreads wild distorted through the airâ

The trees like shrouded spectres stand,

To guard that evil haunted landâ

The pointed cliffs spread broad and square,

Like castles with their banners fair,

And motley shapes of monstrous size

Start up, and glare before the eyes.

To all but Azidâs fearful view

The scene is glorious, grand, and new,

But wondrous notâthey know and prize

The gay refractions of these skies;

But Azidâghastly forms pursue,

All that he fears he sees in view!

At first he muttersâthen he speaks,

Cold drops bedew his aged cheeks;

But ere he lifts thâ imploring eye,

Tâ appease the spirit of the sky,

An offering meet of sacred things

Upon the misty wave he flings,

But chief that herb whose sacred fame

And power, the tribes UssÃ¡ma name.

Then with brief word and solemn air

Recites the simple hunterâs prayer.

[Pg 25]

ââTis now with TheeâGreat Spirit free,

My rite is doneâit is with Thee!â

Now western breezes briskly play,

And sweep those fleecy forms away;

In broken fields they wheel on high,

And show that treasurâd island nigh,

In all its loveliest verdure drest,

Like sanctuary of the blest,

Where peace hath rearâd her forest throne,

To man and all his works unknown.

With joy they reach the silver strand,

With joy they gazeâthey leap to land,

Like beings from a higher sphere,

Dropt down to dwell and worship here.

On all its cliffs and arching bays,

They pour intent their ardent gazeâ

Each airy, wild, fantastic sight,

They scan with ever new delight,

As if the very earth-clod there

Had something more than earthly fair,

And every rock that wallâd the shore

Were jewel set, or bright with ore;

Each pebble on the saffron sands,

They search with prying, chemic hands,

[Pg 26]

By glass or magnet, lest perchance

Aught should escape a grosser glance:

The fragile little helix shell

Along the shore their steps impel,

Intent each speckâd and striped whorl

To find a mass of orient pearl:

The fallen trunk they search with care,

For mark of ancient hatchet there;

Or scan the antler bleachâd and dry

With curious, searching, eager eye.

Hours thus elapse: and every hour

Is fraught with some expressive power;

But now a task must be essayed,

They seek the islandâs central shade;

And first they pass a thicket green,

Where birch and aspen intervene,

And next a grove of sombre hue,

Where spruce and fir arrest the view;

A hill succeeds, and then a wold,

With pines encumberâd, sere and old,

That stretch their branches dead and bare,

High forked amid the upper airâ

Beyond, a beetling rock is seen,

Of massy graniteâcrownâd with green,

[Pg 27]

And from its clefts a limpid stream

Pours on the sight its silver gleam,

And murmâring on its downward way

Speeds idly to a neighbâring bay.

Here pause the travellers, joyâd to meet

Such lonely, wild, and still retreat;

And oft the streamletâs mossy side

They press, to taste the crystal tide,

Or lost in pleasing converse gay,

Review the devious, toilsome way.

But hark! a sound or voice is heard,

A human voiceâperchance a bird?

Or, in some spiral cliff around,

Can rushing winds produce the sound?

Or is the gaunt hyena here?

To Azidââtis a voice of fear!

But hark againâthe softening sound

Reverbârates as if cavern-bound.

They pause, they listâa strain is sung,

âTis in the well-known Indian tongue.

They listâa female voice essays

This fond lament of other days.

[Pg 28]

EDNEEâS SONG.

1.

To sunny valesâto balmy skies,

My thoughâa flowery arrow flies.

I see the woodâthe bankâthe glade,

Where first a wild-wood girl I played:

I think on scenes and faces dear;

They are not
here
âthey are not
here
.

2.

In this cold skyâin this lone isle

I meet no friendâsâno motherâs smile:

I list the windâI list the wave,

They seem like songs around the grave,

And all my heartâs young joys are gone;

It is aloneâit is alone.

3.

Ah! can I ever cease recall

My fatherâs cot, though it were small;

The stream where oft, in sun and shade,

I roved, a happy Indian maid,

Pleased with the wild flowers, pink and red,

A brave youth bound around my head.

4.

I love the land that gave me birth,

Its woods and streams, its air and earth;

[Pg 29]

I love the very sounds I knewâ

Sweet woodland soundsâwhen life was new;

I love the garb my fathers had,

And my own bright Muscogee lad.

That voice is mute: with care they seek,

By winding rock and fallen peak,

For rift or path that foot may tread,

To gain the cragâs oâerhanging head.

At length a rugged path they spy,

That seems nor light, nor safe to try;

But still with patience, skill and might

Suffices to attain that height.

A faintly beaten path succeeds;

This through a cedar coppice leads,

Then by a rock, when turning short,

A cave displays its ample port;â

An Indian maid of stature fair,

And forehead high and flowing hair,

Sits pensively, secure and lone,

Beside that rustic hall of stone;

A string of shining shells she prest

Upon her slender chisellâd breast;

Unmoved her air,âand now again

She raised the half unfinished strain,

[Pg 30]

When that prizâd guardian of the night,

The hunterâs dog, and fond delight,

Darts forth instinctive, and defies

Their near approach with doubling cries.

Instant she starts, as with a shock,

And flies within the cavernâd rock.

Soon from within a man of years,

The warrior father, slow appears;

Tall, rigidâfirm of step and eye,

That speaks of sage, or prophecy;

A head, by nature bald, or shorn,

A look of care, but not forlornâ

A simple spear is in his hand;

With brow upraised, and gesture bland,

He stands beside the cavern way,

With silent gaze, that seems to say,

Come friendâcome foeâye still shall find

A proud, resolved, unbroken mind,

That oft hath tried the battle blade,

Or set the deadly ambuscade;

That neither shuns, nor seeks to die,

That will not stoop, and will not fly.

OSCAR.

Holy hermitânot in ire

Press we on thy cavern fire;

[Pg 31]

Travellers we, from distant shores,

Where the loud Atlantic roars,

And the sun its earliest light

Pours on valley, plain and height.

By the Erieâs fretted shore,

Plied we fast the cedar oar,

And the Huronâs placid sea

Swept with spirits light and free:

Northward still we held our way,

Glancing on by isle and bay,

Bank and river, rift and wall,

To St. Maryâs sounding fallâ

Foamy pass of waters wild!

Islet green and rock up-piled,

Where the torrent silver-crownâd,

Dances on with murmâring sound,

Deep and mellowâwhile the eye

Glows with thrilling ecstasy!

There we pausâd, and gazed, and felt

Natureâs potent power to melt;

But with ever brief delay

Urged again our watery way,

Till we felt the dizzy swell,

As it rose, and as it fell,

[Pg 32]

Of this vasty sheet and breeze,

Sire of continental seas!

And with joy unfelt before,

Gazed upon its ocean shore.

Nor upon that border hoarse,

Bent we many days our course,

When a hunter, old and hoar,

Spied we joyous on the shore.

Him we urged, and by his skill

Reached this storm-indented isle:

Yet in all our lengthened way,

Nought of wondrous, grave or gay,

Have we met in joy or fear,

Strange as thy existence here,

Deemed by men a sacred shore,

Mortal never trod before.

ALHALLA.

Hear me! of thy race severe,

Nought I hope and nought I fear,

Steelâd in heart, and steelâd in mind,

To the ills of human kind;

Yet, if in fateâs thorny round,

Woes that press, and pains that wound,

[Pg 33]

There were still a pang unblest,

Deeper, keener than the rest,

âTwould be, in this secret place,

To behold the white-manâs faceâ

Fatal race! to whom I owe

Bitter, lasting streams of woeâ

Hunted from my native plains,

By wild warâs horrific strainsâ

From my nationâs council-fire,

By the plundererâs reckless ireâ

From my lovâd, paternal streams,

By the cannonâs battle-gleamsâ

Driven from all I valued most,

Kindred, country, fortune lost!

I resolved apace to flee

To some valley lone and free,

Friendly wood or sheltering cave,

Or some wild and distant wave,

All too frigid, poor and dread,

Eâer to tempt the white-manâs tread;

There unknown to pass my life,

Free from rapineâfree from strifeâ

Happy in thâ unpeopled wild,

With my loved, my only child!

And full happy, freed from cares,

Envy breeds, or hate prepares!

[Pg 34]

Here in numbers brief and low,

All unseen to vent my woeâ

Dream oâer scenes of early peace,

And, as lifeâs pulsations cease,

Sink to earth without a groan,

Calm, unnoticed, and alone.

But eâen this may not be so,

Fresh the springs of sorrow flow!

And the fiat black and drear

Still pursues its victim here;

As if âtwere a boon too high

Thus to live and thus to die!

To declare thy presence here

Doth inspire a joy sincere,

Or with gladness fills my eye,

Were most base, unseemly lie!

Yet, to wayward mortal feet,

Is my roof a safe retreat;

Be ye foes, or be ye friends,

If impelled by noble ends,

Chance, or circumstance severe,

Chilly blast, or famine drear,

Welcome is my stony cot,

Welcome is my forest lot;

Freely enterâfreely share

Cottage fire and cottage fare.

[Pg 35]

CANTO III.
THE BATTLES OF TALLASATCHES AND TALLADEGA.

[
Scene.
A Cave on the Island. The king of
the Hillabees, his sister and daughter. Ethwald and Oscar. Others
attendance. Time, evening.]

The fire shone bright on rift and wall,

Within Alhallaâs cavern-hall;

And oft had that lone maid, his pride,

With splinterâd pine the flame supplied,

And kindly spread, with ready zeal,

The wholesome, frugal cottage meal:

The ruddy haunch, the shreded moose,

With vermil trout, and firland grouse,

And sapid rice, and many a root,

And many a tiny forest-fruit;

And oft, in birchen vase, supplied

The limpid fountainâs crystal tide,

With such obeisance kind and brief,

As well may suit an Indian chief.

Nor wanting sheâwhose age and art

Supplied the maidâa motherâs part.

And now that chieftain, proud and high,

Glanced round a wild, unsettled eye,

[Pg 36]

As if that scanning glance should say,

Up, strangers, and pursue your way!

This Oscar marked with ready art,

And thus expressâd his glowing heart.

OSCAR.

Thanks were but light and all too weak,

Hearts mantling oâer, like ours, to speak,

But we shall hold and carry hence,

Of thee and thine, so high a sense,

Thy courtesyâthy lifeâthy lot,

As but with life can be forgot.

One only wishâone strong desire,

Still draws us to thy cavern-fire,

And stays thâ intent we felt the while,

To quit this ocean-cinctured isle.

âTis more to knowâto hearâto see,

Of one so noble, poor, and free,

So proudâunfortunate as thee.

Deign, then, oh chief!âfor trust you may,

If aught that man can feel or say

Can give assurance of our faith,

To hold thee quit of ill or scaith.

Deign, then, thy latent woes to tell,

The rush and struggle, rout and yell,

The scenes of care, or deeds of strife,

That mark thy onward course through life,

[Pg 37]

And weighing down with double weight,

Of age and care that neâer abate,

Have searâd thy cheeks, and searâd thy heart,

And made thee, exile! what thou art.

So when we reach our native vales,

Dear land where home-bred bliss prevails!

With joyâwith pride we may relate

A good manâs fame, a brave manâs fate.

ALHALLA.

Man of prayerâfor I ween,

By thy words, and dress, and mien,

Such thou art,âwords, words are vain

To cure my woes, or soothe my pain.

Little boots it thee, to know

Whence I came or whence I go.

Hard my lotânor would I eâer

Draw afresh the scalding tear,

Tear the wound that has been healâd,

Or renew the bloody field;

And if eâen my tongue were prone

Thus to dwell on actions done,

Could I? âtwere reliance base,

Eâer again to trust thy race.

OSCAR.

Deem not, stoic of the wood,

Harshly thus of Christian blood;

[Pg 38]

Warm, and pure, and kind it flows,

For the suffering Indianâs woes,

Proudly beats and nobly swells,

Where bland pityâs voice impels,

Honor points, or justice drawsâ

Justice! guide of Christian laws!

There are bosoms burning high,

Souls of bland philanthropy!

Hearts and hands and means and space

That would joy to serve thy race,

Joy to see thee happier here,

Happier in another sphere,

And eâen life itself would give,

That the Indianâs
soul
should live.

And were none to teach or pray,

Point or lead the heavenly way,

Soothe the lot so roughly cast,

Or avert fateâs angry blastâ

Were there not in all the land,

One kind heart with love so bland,

Aim so noble, care divine,

Trust, lone recluse, trust to mine!

Mine the purpose, mine the will,

Heavenâs kind message to reveal,

Teach the ever-glorious Son,

Mercies promised, doing, done!

[Pg 39]

Aid the weak, persuade the wise,

And lead to worlds beyond the skies.

ALHALLA.

Man of wisdom, on mine ear

Dark thy holy truths appear,

And I would not, old and weak,

Novel rites or doctrines seek,

Or a path unknown pursue,

That my fathers never knew,

Though thou put the thorns aside,

And lead on, a zealous guide.

Ponder well this furrowâd face,

See in me a hunter race,

Rude in manners, poor in skill,

Wanting knowledge, wanting will,

Means and purpose, care and force,

To pursue the white manâs course,

But not lacking means or power

That may suit the hunterâs bower,

Brave the ills a man may brave,

And deserve an honored grave,

I would scorn the labor base

Of thy wonder-working race;

As my fathers lived, would I

Wish to live and wish to die,

[Pg 40]

Hold the precepts they have given,

Seek with them my final heaven;

Proper are thy gifts to
thee
,

Proper are my gifts to
me
;

Go thy wayâmy fervent cry

Is
here
undisturbed to die.

ETHWALD.

Yet when, beside the stormy wave,

The tall grass whistles oâer thy grave,

âTwere sweet, perhaps, for thee to know

Kind hearts remember thee below.

Thy glorious feats in earthly wars,

Thy name, thy honors, and thy scars.

OSCAR.

And when the good, by word or pen,

Spoke praises meet of gallant men,

Chief, hunter, warriorâhearts divine!

Who grace the manly Indian line,

âTwere grateful thy proud course to scan,

And say, thou wert the braver man.

ALHALLA.

Hear my words:âThrice twenty snows

Have bleachâd and chillâd these frontless brows,

[Pg 41]

And sun and frost, and wind and rain,

Prevailâd alternate oâer the plain,

As moons revolvedâsince erst with joy

I roved a careless hunter boy,

Full free from sorrow, care, and pain,

On Talladegaâs sunny plain,

And every year with fresh delight,

Gleamed on my fond enraptured sight,

And youth fled fast, and manhood came,

But manhood found me still the same.

I swept the woods with bended bow,

And laid the deer and panther low;

I sailâd the streams with net and line,

And captive schools were often mine;

I marched against the western foe,

And laid the roving Paunee low;

I sung my war-song, danced my round,

Spuming with manly tread the ground;

I met my peers in wood and glen,

And knew no want, and fearâd no men,

But lookâd, and spoke, and felt, and thought,

As one that lackâd and dreaded nought;

And all was gloriousâall was gay,

A happy, bright, transcendent day.

But years, that turn the young man gray,

Brought silent on another day.

[Pg 42]

War came:ânot such as memâry tells

Once rung through Tuscaloosaâs dells,

When simple wood-craft plied her art,

Club against club, and dart to dart,

But grim, exterminating wrath,

That heaped with dead his giant path,

Embracing in one genâral sweep

Both those; who strike and those who weep,

The young and old, the weak and brave,

Drivân onward to one genâral grave.

Upon the front of this fell storm,

Rode gallant chief of martial form,

Whose woodland skill, and battle ire,

Eâen vanquishâd warriors may admire.

OSCAR.

Sayest thou there was no mercy shown,

No prisoner saved in battleânone?

ALHALLA.

Little there wasâI must be brief,

Yet would not play the knave or thief,

By robbing foeman, chief or youth,

Of one small tittle of the truth,

To save this witherâd trunk the ire

And rack of slow-consuming fire.

[Pg 43]

When erst this cloud obdurate rose,

Red with the wrath of many foes,

And men and steeds promiscuous slain,

Strewed Tallasatcheâs fatal plain,

The struggle oâer, compassion fair,

Perched on the standards floating there!

I, on that sanguinary day,

Mixed freely in the dubious fray,

And with my war-axe, lance and brand,

Fought with the foremost of my band.

These scars upon my arm and breast,

My valor on that day attest.

But vain was every warrior art,

By charge or war-whoop, club or dart;

The foeman pressing on our ground,

With horse and bayonet wallâd us round,

And with fierce courage bearing down,

Swept plain and covert, host and town,

And nine score warriors, whom I led,

Upon that day lay cold and dead.

Few suns set on that dismal scene,

My wounds were still unsearâd and green,

When thundering on with trump and drum,

I heard again the war-horse come,

[Pg 44]

Like gathering tempest, big and black,

That through the forest wings its track,

Sweeping and tearing all that stand,

And desolating wood and land.

But I had oft seen danger near,

And knew not that base feelingâfear!

I roused my warriors from the rest

That with short, fitful dreams they prest,

And armed for fight, and strife and pain,

Stood firm on Talladegaâs plain.

Oh Talladega! thou art still

My native wood! my native hill!

There knew I first my fatherâs voice,

And felt my infant mind rejoice,

And all those sweet endearments start,

That nature winds about the heart,

And home, and love, and bliss, and fame,

That cluster round a parentâs name.

And there I hoped to live and die,

In natureâs sweet simplicity;

Unmovâd with arts, or cares, or strife,

That mingle in the white manâs life;

Nor knew I whence thâ intruder came,

Nor what his race, or what his fame;

Nor carâd, nor wishâd, nor sought to be

Else than I wasâa Hillabee.

[Pg 45]

And still I hoped, when nature threw

Around my brows the silver hue,

And fainting limbs proclaimed the close

Of earthly cares and earthly woes,

To lay me down with sober care,

And slumber with my fathers there.

Ah! land of all my heart holds dear,

Thy groves are desolate and searâ

The echoes of thy winding shore

Shall charm my listening ear no moreâ

The winds that whistle oâer thy plain

Repeat a sad and hollow strain,

And all thy haunts are fillâd with moans,

And whitened by my nationâs bones.

But let me drop this strain of woe:

I told thee of the coming foe,

And he did come, in such array

As well foretold a stubborn day.

Few words I spoke to those who stood,

With ready arms, within that wood;

But, when I ceasâd, the battle cry

Rung long and loudlyâstrike or die!

Erst trampling horse, in armor bright,

Pricked to the front and wooed the fight,

[Pg 46]

With volley quick and furious tread

Essayed thâ assault, and, wheeling, fled.

I forward sprang, and at one yell

A thousand warriors served me well,

And urging ball and featherâd dart,

Playâd hot and strong the warriorâs part;

And once I drove the reeling ranks

Back on their chiefâthe chief outflanks,

Pours from behind his galling horse,

And opes the war with all his force.

Thick round my sides my bowmen lieâ

They faint, they waver, and they fly;

Then streams afresh the battle gore

Wider and wider along the shore,

And those who fly but fly to feel

Thâ avenging horsemenâs angry steel.

And when the night closed on that plain,

To veil the dying and the slain,

Few, out of all my gallant band,

Had âscaped the mark of ball or brand;

And death, of brave Muscogee men,

Had numbered fourteen score and ten.

[Pg 47]

CANTO IV.
THE WARRIORâS DREAM.
A PROPHECY.

[Scene in reminiscence. The forest of Talladega. Alhalla alone. Time, midnight.]

ALHALLA.

The sun went down that fatal night,

Not as it wont, in glory bright,

But veilâd in clouds of sombre trace,

Prophetic of my falling race.

I stood upon a rising ground,

As darkness flung her mantle round,

And heard the last, departing din,

Of horse and footmen, gathering in,

With clank of steel, and sharp hallo,

As from the onset they withdrew,

Far winding down the distant hill,

Faint, and more faintâthen all was still,

Save crackling tread, or groan severe

Of hapless comrade, weltering near:

For all that wide, extended wood,

Was strewed with carnage, death and blood.

[Pg 48]

I stood as petrified, with thought

On all one fleeting day had wroughtâ

Of friend and foeâthe brave and deadâ

And those who fought, and those who fled;

And bitter were the pangs that came

That hour within my inmost frame:

For I had seen a father slain,

A father old in years and pain;

Two brothers stricken at my side,

And a fond parentâs dearest pride,

The child hope shone most brightly on,

My loved, my first-born, only son!

In grief absorbed and musing high,

And yet no tear escaped my eyeâ

No sigh my bosom heavedâno moan

Bespoke my heartâs forsaken tone;

But sealed in woe, within that wood,

Unmoved as storm-beat rock I stood.

The moon, in pity veiled that night,

Shed out a transitory light,

As dusky clouds, in rapid chase,

Now hid, and now revealed her face;

And by her feeble, trembling ray,

I took my solitary wayâ

[Pg 49]

The narrow, winding, leaf-clad road,

Conducting to my own abodeâ

The fragile shed, that, low and poor,

So oft hath made me feel secure;

So oft hath spread its sheathing wild

To guard the mother and the child;

That shed, which, howsoeâer he roam,

Still forms the Indian warriorâs homeâ

And which he would not change, or give,

Like Briton, Scot, or Gaul to live,

For all the wealth that kings command,

Or temples made with mortal hand.

Brief space I walked, when, turning round

A beetling rock that walled the ground,

And just oâerhung my lodge, there fell

Sounds on my ear I knew not well;

A murmur indistinctâand then

The harsh, brief words of stranger men.

A pause ensuedâshriek! I sped

To guard my lowly, leaf-crowned shed,

And saw, with deeply rousâd alarms,

My Ednee in a soldierâs arms

Borne shrieking off, in accents wild,

âOh, father! save thy injured child!â

[Pg 50]

What space there was âtwixt him that bore

And my own stand upon the shore,

Ill can I vouchâbut, wide or spare,

One instant served to waft me there.

I raised one yell my warriors knewâ

For I had warriors still, and trueâ

Then sprang, and drew, and smote with might,

And still the plunderers answeredâsmite!

And still those thrilling accents wild,

Rung in my earsââOh, save thy child!â

Vain cry! outnumbered, hand to hand

I felt the foemanâs heavy brand,

And reeled to earthâand bleeding there,

I felt unuttârable despair,

For still I heard that plaint so wild,

âOh, father! save thy injured child!â

As hungry panther from his tree

Darts on his victim, bold and free,

Or black crotalis, ere he spring,

Gives warning of the deadly sting,

Thus swift and sure in strength and mood

Ten warriors leapt from out the wood,

Upon the instant when, with pain,

I sank upon the dewy plain;

[Pg 51]

Each armed with arms of steel and dread,

With brave Clewalla at their head,

And at one shout, and at one bound,

They shake the trembling woods around.

They fightâthey vanquish! words are vain,

They bring me safe my child again.

What boots it, that I here should tell,

Or those who âscapâd, or those who fell?

Thâ assailants, merged in margin damp

And tangled brushwood, sought their camp.

Of those who fell, a liquid grave

We gave in Coosaâs yellow wave;

Which, soft and slow, and winding, bore

Its charge to oceanâs sand-bound shore.

Now sober silence once again

Began to hold her wonted reign;

My wounds, with simple skill, were bound,

My warriors lay reclining round,

And ere the hour of midnight chill,

All seemed as dreary, hushâd, and still,

As if the shout, or battleâs roar,

Had neâer been heard upon that shore.

I sat within my tent, and mused,

(As oft in peaceful days I used,)

[Pg 52]

Upon the Spirit, great and high,

That rules the earth, the sea, the sky,

And that mysterious power and will

That warrants man still man to kill,

Sends powers and nations to and fro,

And fills the earth with strife and woe.

I thought upon my own wild kin,

And all their wandârings, want, and sin,

And that untoward fate that gave,

Profuse, their bodies to the grave,

And seemed to set them in array,

For Saxon arms to drive and slay.

I cast my eye in thought profound,

On that dear circle slumbâring round,

And markâd thâ unoccupied recess

A son, a father, once could press;

And last bethought me of the fate

And juncture of my own estate:

Weak, wounded, foiled, and sore distrestâ

Of friends bereavâdâby foemen prestâ

Sad, bitter thoughts my heart control,

A dreamy madness steeps my soul,

Or wake or sleeping wist I not,

By whom environâd, whom forgot;

Unreal scenes before me rise,

And visions pass before my eyes.

[Pg 53]

Methought I looked upon the sea,

And low, dark waves, not large nor free,

Came rolling in towards the shore,

With scarce a pebble dash, or roar,

Then larger grew, and louder sound,

Till one wide tumult rings around.

I looked againâa monster bear,

With claws of steel, and fiery hair,

Emerged from out the deepâhis head,

Two polished horns of brass oâerspread,

And at his side a leader stood,

Of visage pale,âa full-plumâd hood

Danced oâer his brows, and in his hand

He held a sharp and shining brand.

I looked again, and from a tree,

A beauteous bird sang joyfully;

A ray of light from either eye

Shot forth in bright tranquillity,

Illuminating all the wood,

Within whose ample disk I stood.

Yet once again my view I cast;

Another changing vision past:

A fleecy cloud came from its height,

And stood before my wondâring sight,

And parting, like two banners drawn,

A figure stept upon the lawn,

[Pg 54]

In size, and color, dress and air

Like my own kindredâbut more fair.

I, wondering much what these should bode,

Put question meetâhe answerâdââGod,

Whom once thy sires, on burning sands,

In other years and other lands

Most truly served, hath doomed thy race

To melt before the white-manâs face,

To fail in battle, and in store,

A scornâa by-word on the shore;

For ye from his commands have turnâd,

And ye unholy fires have burnâd,

And with new altars and abodes

Set up and worshipâd other gods,

And through unholy rites and sin,

In word and deed become unclean;

And for a season he hath given

Your nations to the wrath of heaven,

By divers men from foreign climes,

Who loathe your waywardness and crimes,

And congregate from far and near

To worship God in spirit here.â

âTis well, I said; but tell me true,

What bodes this vision to my view?

[Pg 55]

It comes with a prophetic air,

But can I see the Red Race there?

âThe little waves which erst thou spyâd,

Calm and unruffled,â he replied,

âDenote the earliest flag unfurlâd,

Adventârous in this western world;

Whence gaining strength, in heart and hand,

The stranger spreads along the strand,

Like tumbling waves, whose onward way

No human force can check or stay.

The monster rising from the sea,

Imports dominionâonce by thee

In peace and war triumphant swayâd,

But now to other hands conveyâd;

His horns of brass and claws of steel,

A more obdurate power reveal;

His altered, red and fiery hair,

Denotes unnumbered means of war,

Complex inventions, sharp and true,

Such as thy fathers never knew,

Whereby the rule at first he gains,

And then with growing power maintains;

The leader is that iron race,

Who drive thee on, from place to place,

And long have drivân, and long shall drive,

The waning, scattered, Indian hive,

[Pg 56]

Till they forsake thâaccursed road,

And turn to virtue, peace, and God.

Then shall they quit the forest gloom,

The sceptre and the plough resume,

Renounce all base, revengeful ires,

Rebuild the altars, light the fires,

And cherish every sweet employ

Denoted by the bird of joy,

Whose beaming eyes, with stellar light,

Shall chase away barbaric night,

And teach thy race in holy lays

To sing the great Elohimâs praise.â

[Pg 57]

CANTO V.
THE FALL OF THE MUSCOGEE RACE.
THE VOLUNTARY EXILE.

[Scene in reminiscence. The valley of the Coosa river, and parts adjacent.]

ALHALLA.

Who is Elohim? who? I saidâ

The vision brokeâthe angel fled.

Dread on my ear these accents broke,

And highâit seemed a god who spokeâ

His features, as my race he drew,

Assumed a clear and heavenly hue,

And voice, and attitude, and air,

Became more fearful, bright and fair,

Till the transcendence pained the sight;

And when he ceasâdâa cloud of light,

Far stretching up the starry frame,

Told whence he flew, and whence he came.

My soul an inward tremor shook,

And in a wild amaze I woke.

The sun was darting from his bed

A gorgeous flame of gold and red,

[Pg 58]

That streaming far, and wide, and free,

Gilt bank and bower, cliff and tree,

And merry birds of plumage fair,

With varied sweetness fillâd the air.

The man who oâer unfathomâd brink

Hangs trembling, and in dread to sink,

By friendly arm quick rescued thence,

Feels not more deep or joyful sense

Of peril pastâthan to my heart

That morningâs opening scenes impart.

But as that fear the trembler knew,

My joy was all as transient too.

I could not chase away the gleam,

And semblance of that mystic dream;

And still before my waking eyes,

I saw that bloody monster rise,

And heard the furious dash and roar,

Of waves loud beating on the shoreâ

I felt the truths that spirit said,

I felt that we had errâd and strayâd,

And left the bright and shining road,

That leads through nature up to God:

And yet, I ill could comprehend,

That visionâs proper type and end,

[Pg 59]

Or tell what time my warlike band,

Had worshipâd him in other land,

Or followed other rites, or why

Thus doomed to quit that kindlier sky;

Or how I might direct my race,

Their âwildered track again to trace.

Hard, dark and cruel seemâd my lot,

Part knew I, and part knew I notâ

And as, on either hand I weighed

Thought and beliefâthe more I strayâd:

This told me, it were sure designâd,

One God should rule all human kind;

That, that the white and red manâs road

Led upward to a separate god;

That spirits obdurate or kind,

Of lesser rank oâerruled the mind,

And that, of powers who oâer us stood,

The good, unasked, were ever good,

While some fit rite and offâring had

Been deemâd a duty towârd the bad.

OSCAR.

An erring creed! one God alone,

Rules and supports the starry throne,

And earthly spheresâand all the host,

Of various men, from coast to coast;

[Pg 60]

Nor could that power be good or just,

To sanction discord, crime, or lust.

ALHALLA.

Thou speakest of thy knowledge. Mine,

Ill should I speak, to call divine.

In forests nurtured, raised, and taught,

Of simple nature is my thoughtâ

That nature which, if eâer it felt

The power of love divine to melt,

And purify and raise the heart,

And tread the darkling maze of art,

Or ever learned to think or feel,

With holy, pure, ethereal zeal,

Long since hath fallân and wanderâd thence,

To deeds of plain, material sense;

And what we touch, and know, and see,

With form or life to move or be,

And all that is not such, or seems,

Makes up the Indianâs world of dreams.

Nor, till that well remembered hour,

Eâer felt I aught of
other
power,

Or taskâd my mind to think my fate

Hung on supernal love or hate;

Or when, from this frail tenement

To other worlds the spirit went,

[Pg 61]

Had questioned my confiding breast,

The brave manâs spirit should be blest.

But anxious thoughts opprest me now,

I feltâwhat I could scarce avowâ

A sense of error deep and base,

Both in myself and in my race,

And that whateâer in former hour

Had been my nationâs fame or power,

Or whatsoeâer that power might be,

In distant, dim futurity,

We now were given oâer to feel

The strong oppressorâs heavy steel,

And weak and vain must be that fight,

Maintainâd in fateâs and heavenâs spite.

I callâd the eldersâthey who prest

Still on the leafy couch of rest,

And leaning on my staff arose,

To paint our bleeding countryâs woesâ

I spoke of losses dread and sore,

By shot or brand, in field and store,

And that still sorer press and great,

I saw within the womb of fate;

[Pg 62]

And lastâupon thâ awakenâd ear,

With voice and gesture strong and clear,

I poured my high prophetic dream,

Part after partâsuch as still gleam

Before my mind, its features dread,

With all that boding spirit said.

âAnd oh, my people,â thus I cried,

âSnatch from your breast the serpent, pride;

Forsake the war-path and the strife,

Throw from your hands the murdârous knife,

And bury deep, and bury free,

The purple war-club; and decree,

That he who digs it up in ire,

The same shall expiate in fire.â

I ceasâdâapproving plaudits loud,

Rang heart-responsive through the crowd.

The sun had not ascended high,

Along the blue, unclouded sky,

When, bearing pipe and wampum gay,

My counsellors were on their way,

And ere the heath had lost its damp,

They stood within the foemanâs camp,

Prepared from further strife to cease,

The firm ambassadors of peace,

[Pg 63]

And urge their suit: the war-worn chief,

Assents in words direct and brief,

But calls on all the gathered band,

Before his star-crownâd tent to stand,

By chief or elderâthere to treat,

And judge of peace, and limits meet;

Meantime with promise bids them speed,

To consecrate such holy deed.

But ah! what mortal man can say,

He counts upon one single day

Of fortune, favor, health, or bliss,

In such uncertain scene as this!

For, ere another setting sun,

Allâall! was vanished, lost, undone!

And while, from war-markâd front and cheek

My young men washed the vermil streak,

And elders counsel and prepare

To drop the war-club and the warâ

Upon a suddenâhorse and men

Come rushing on oâer hill and glen,

And wide encircling field and cot,

With fire and sword, and hissing shot,

Assail my wonder-stricken bands,

Who stand with peace-pipes in their hands!

[Pg 64]

Unarmed and unprepared, they spy

The foe perfidious drawing nigh,

Yet scarce can deem that deed so base

Should stain the whitesâ obdurate race;

Nor deigned theyâwhen they felt thâ attack,

With all its missile horror black!

To raise a lanceâor draw a bow,

Or supplicate thâ infuriate foe;

Or break that honest pledge of faith

Once given: but calmly meeting death,

There brave as noble martyrs stood,

Nor shed one drop of foemanâs blood,

While three score warriors, honor-crownâd,

In mortal silence pressed the ground,

And twice six score the conqâror saves,

To grace his tarnishâd sword as slaves.

Perfidious! have I calledâwho slights

Or peace or warâs time-honored rights!

For then I knew not
other
head
[4]

That band of fierce assailants led,

And not that chief surnamed The Hard,
[5]

Who erst received our warm regard.

[Pg 65]

But ours the wrong, and ours the woe,

We only saw one genâral foe,

And knew not name or rank, or who

Thâ extended hand of peace withdrew.

Me, wounds detained within my bower,

Upon that fell, destroying hour,

Nor deemed I rout, or battle roar,

Should vex my suppliant nation more;

Their hapless fate my bosom mournâd,

And all to peace my hopes I turnâd.

Old as I was, and weak and scarrâd,

Meet seemed the thought, to be prepared,

At night or noon, in bed or field,

The prisoned spark of life to yield,

And leave to those with vigor rife,

Its sweets and sorrows, joys and strife.

One wish alone inspirâd my breast,

It was to see my Ednee blest.

And now, around my cottage fire

Due care the festive rites require,

For oft had bold Clewalla sued

Alliance with my ancient blood,

[Pg 66]

And with meet gifts and parlance bland,

Implored my Edneeâs timid hand;

But neâer beforeâthat gentle claim

Enforced in fame and valourâs name,

For now in the same person blend,

The swain, deliverer and friend.

But still, a cruel fate in this,

Pervades, and mars the cup of bliss!

And while the gallant warrior stands

Expectantâat my willing hands,

A sudden tumult wild and high,

Rings fearfully along the skyâ

âA foeâa foe!â the runners shout,

And all is hurry, whoop, and rout!

Short space there is for look or wordâ

The warriors, with one spirit stirrâd,

Seize club and bow, and fusil light,

And fly towards the gathering fight;

Clewalla leadsâalong the wood

Deep shouts resound, and cries of blood,

And soon the distant crack and roar

Proclaim another scene of gore.

And rumor rife, along the plain,

Repeats a tale of lost and slain.

[Pg 67]

From out a wood two hosts advance,

With glittering sword and pointed lance,

Rank upon rankâour light clad men,

Unbooted all, re-sought the glen,

There, tree to tree, to ward the blow,

And best their forest breeding show;

But while they rally, shout and form,

Behold athwartâanother storm!

Fierce, heavy horsemen, sword on high,

Gleam through the woods and fill the sky.

Environed thus, no hope remains

But that a brave manâs hand sustains;

Nor this availed, though plied with skill

Oâer mead and valley, wood and hill,

And sixty brave hearts, slain that day,

Attest the fury of the fray;

Clewalla, known for daring cry,

Where bayonets cross and bullets fly,

With rampant arm is seen maintain

The strife, till sinking with the slain;

But whether wounded, or if low,

The pulse of life still kept its flow,

Spake rumor not; we searched in vain

Along the wood, amid the slain;

We traced each secret glen and shore,

But never saw Clewalla more.

[Pg 68]

Murmur there was of varying sound

That he to distant fort was bound,

A captive held; yet ever prone

To swell and shift, and change her tone,

We found it like an eveningâs tale,

And all our search was doomed to fail:

Or if he eâer returned, his tread

Was light as ghost of warrior dead.

Betrayed, encompassed, beaten, prest!

Stem desperation fired each breast;

They burn with wild revenge and ire,

Re-light again the battle fire;

Re-poise the lanceâre-plume the dart,

And rousing each bold warrior art,

Poured on the reckless battle tide,

Nor asked the boon which they denied.

And long they fought and freely bled,

And heaped their valleys with the dead;

For plain, defile, or wild retreat,

Still brought disaster and defeat,

And every hallowed wood and shore,

Was soiled with war-hoof, axe, or gore.

[Pg 69]

I mixed again amid the strife,

Light estimating limb or life,

And for a season strove to guide

And stem the furious battle tide.

But why repeat the bitter tale?

I saw each manly effort fail;

We fought, as if against a spell,

And, foiled, with Tuscaloosa fell.
[6]

The poor Muscogee race may say,

They yet shall see a happier day;

That happier day I neâer shall see,

I deem none happy if not free:

And with that warâso fates conspireâ

Went out the brave Muscogee fire.

I, scorning on that soil to be

No longer honorâd, lovâd, or free!

Resolved to leave those sunny strands,

For distant woods and strangerâs lands,

[Pg 70]

And bending far, still onward hied,

By vale and torrent, rock and tide,

With purpose high, and aim severe,

To close a life of suffâring here.

Here in my house, which nature made

Without the white manâs skill or aid,

A few short years shall close my eyes,

And leave my bones in northern skies,

And not a trace be left to show

Alhallaâs fateâAlhallaâs woe.

[Pg 71]

CANTO VI.
THE RE-UNION.

[
Scene.
The Cave; Alhalla, Ethwald, Oscar, Mongazid, Ednee,
Clewalla, De la Joie; with their separate retinues and attendants.
Time, Evening.]

As spoke the chief of waning fate,

And foemanâs ire, and spiritâs hate,

And hurried on through martial feats,

And routs, and battles, and defeats,

No tremor weak, or muscleâs throe,

Betokenâd mark of inward woe,

Or, aught the scanning eye could see,

That stoic warrior should not be.

But when he told of sacred seats,

And winding shores, and still retreats,

By trampling hoof, and rampart soilâd,

And sepulchre of gifts despoilâd

To light the torch, that spread amain

One smoking ruin oâer the plain,â

And that, though loved and cherishâd yet,

The land his soul could neâer forget,

[Pg 72]

He sickenâd on that soil to be,

When now no longer blest or freeâ

An altered brow, a look of fire,

Betray a burst of scorn and ire,

And that high spirit, air, and gait,

Which rises still above its fate,

And though hemâd in by want or pain,

Stoops not to parley or complain.

And when he ceasâdâin conscious pride,

He drew his ample robe aside,

Revealing gorget, crest, and ring,

Thâ insignia of an Indian King,

And cowry shell, and wampum wreath,

That ill-concealâd the scars beneath,

And all might know, and all might see,

His double honors and degree.

Then folding back, with lofty air,

His wrapper-robeâerect and fair,

With martial pomp, and thoughtful mood,

In silent majesty he stood;â

An object, more ennobled far,

By high-born soul, and honored scar,

Than all the baubles, gaud, and show,

That mortal monarch can bestow.

[Pg 73]

While yet the chieftainâs accents rung

Upon the mind, and chainâd each tongue,

With looks that spoke some latent care,

Though ill concealed by studied air,

Advanced, with ever sober speed,

That spare and silverâd Jossakeed,
[7]

Grave Mongazid, and in his hand

He bore a pipe, and held a wand,

And from his belt, securely drawn,

Impends the furrâd MetÃ¡-wyaunâ

A sacred careâwhile eagleâs crest

And amulet protect his breast

From ill by unseen spirit sent,

Or fiendâs transforming punishment;

(Such as once fell, to his deep ken,

When gods assumed the shapes of men,)

And over all, the quiver light,

And javelin-club, for mortal fight

Contingent: Bold and free his tone,

Bow or obeisance makes he none;

But, poisâd erect as plummetâs line,

Thus speaks of evil thoughtâdesign:

The while on Oscar casts his eyes,

Or Ethwald, bent in mute surprise.

[Pg 74]

MONGAZID.

Not far the golden orb of light

Had sped, on his aerial flight,

Nor gained he yet the central sky,

Ereâbent on mystic rite and highâ

I sought a lone, embowerâd place,

And just within the woodâs embrace,

But not excluding partial sight

Of winding shore, and waters bright,

There had I raisâd my humble stone

Of sacrifice;âthat duty done,

Would have returnâd, when object new,

Half veiled in mist, arrests my view;â

In human form it seemâd bedight,

Of giant limb and giant mightâ

Onward it came, along the strand,

With thoughtful pace and outstretchâd hand,

As if in act to speak, or press,

But changing, still grew less and less,

Till burst of sunbeam, quick and bright,

Displayed a stature human quite,

And as he came more near to me,

Behold, a noble Hillabee!

A youth of pensive mien, and tall,

Whom in thy thoughts thou mayâst recall.

[Pg 75]

He stopt;âand drawing from his breast

A knife-sheath, oft its surface prest

With fervent lipâand it seemâd fair,

With inwrought quill, and stained hairâ

Then lookâd he up to heaven, with eyes

That sought the pity of the skies,

And once again that pledge he prest,

Then drew the bladeâand in his breast

Had plungâd it deep, but from my stand

I sprang, and foilâd his lifted hand.

Pale and aghast awhile he stood,

Then flung that weapon in the flood,

And, with embraces warm and rife,

Thankâd and re-thankâd me for his life.

EDNEE.

Didst thou not ask, what fate severe

Had drivân the hapless wandârer here?

What cruel ills his life had prest,

Or woes were rankling in his breast?

MONGAZID.

Speech had we some; but ever shy

And cautious, seemed he, in reply:

He spoke of wandering and of loss,

In war and peace, by wile and cross;

[Pg 76]

Of hopes still false, and objects eâer

Upon the grasp, yet never near;

With much of wild and frantic lore,

That spoke a bosom painâd and sore,

But ever indistinct, and still

He thankâd me for my friendly will.

EDNEE. [aside]

Strange! tale most strange! ah, could it be!

But he is dead!âa Hillabee!

ALHALLA.

Sawâst thou no mark upon his breast,

To note the chieftainship? or crest?

MONGAZID.

Mark saw I none, and ill could test

What neither word nor sign exprest;

More if ye would of purpose ask,

Himself shall spare my tongue the task.

[
Enter an Indian, clad in the Southern costume.
]

Ceasâd Azidâs voice; when there appears

A form, in stature, looks, and years,

Such as the fondest wish might trace

When dreaming on the human race;

[Pg 77]

Bold, tall, upright of frame and tone,

The image of proud natureâs son;

Thought markâd his brow, and inward care

Had flung oâer all a pensive air;

The scars he bore, the eagle plume,

Bespoke a warrior, not a groom

Decked for the dance, with gay metasse,
[8]

And figured band, and bell of brass.

A collar of the sacred shell

He wore, that graced his figure well.

Loose was his robe of banded blue,

And ample fold, and gather true.

Light was his tread, as zephyrâs sigh,

And youth beamâd brightly from his eye.

Cautious he passed the cavern bound,

Then pausâd, and gazed intently round.

It is Clewalla!âdeftly oâer

He sped, across that cavern floor,

And at one rush, with joy confest,

He clasps his Ednee to his breast.

No word is saidâthe sudden gush

Of feeling warm, and memoryâs flushâ

[Pg 78]

Of cares, and doubts, and hopes, and pains,

Thâ oâermasterâd tongue awhile enchains,

While heart to throbbing heart careers,

And vents its joy, at first, in tears!

And then with quick response is heard,

Soft interchange of fitting word,

And all the fervid greeting kind,

That rivets constant mind to mind.

Oh love, there is no word, no sign,

No token half so sweet as thine,

When sighing hours, when lingâring years,

When hopes deferred, when pallid fears,

Are banishâd all, and, at a start,

Kind heart is riveted to heart.

Whether the face be white or red,

Within a cot or palace bred,

Beneath the line, or at the pole,

An unwont rapture fires the soul.

We cannot say that sigh or vow

Were brought to mind, or uttered now;

We cannot say, that months or years

Were counted oâer amid their tears;

But this we can, and this we know,

That past and gone was every woe;

That former crossesâformer tears,

Were cast behind, with other years,

[Pg 79]

And every thought that could annoy

Deep buried in the present joy.

And now had gratulation past,

And warrior-lover broken fast,

And dainty haunch, and wild-fruit sharâd,

By Edneeâs gentle hand preparâd,

And all in high expectance wait

The annals of his wayward fate.

CLEWALLA.

Little suits it tide or time

I should here descant on crime,

War or loss, mischance or boast,

That befell on southern coast,

Where, by cruel fate impelled,

As a captive I was held.

Little boots it, that I here

Once again should drop the tear,

Not by red man often shed,

Save above the honored dead;

Or, by sad recitals, throw

Oâer this scene a garb of woe.

Let it, once for all, suffice,

That my path was hemmed by vice,

[Pg 80]

Power, misfortune, cross and ill,

Such as stoutest bosoms kill;

But I had a warriorâs heart,

That not light with life could part.

Oft I fought with club and knife,

Strewing deathâs dark path with life,

But not often felt the blight

Fate prepared
that
fearful night,

When by river, rock, and dell,

There Alhallaâs household fell:

As I lifted high my brand,

Oâer the wide retreating strand,

Hot the fight and loud the yell,

This I only know, I fell:

Consciousness, as with a thought,

Left me, as the fight I fought,

Sudden, as, if in a dream,

What we do may only seem.

When, from this unguarded stroke,

First to life and sense I woke,

Darkness spread around the plain,

Shielding dying, dead, and slain;

Slowly rising from my gore,

Faint, I sought the riverâs shore;

[Pg 81]

Fatal act! to drink or die,

Purchased by captivity.

Yet my fate was not to fall

By the broadsword or the ball;

Taught by kindly hands to know

War doth mingle balms with woe,

And âtis only on the field

Saxon men will never yield.

Soft they made my prison bed,

Kindly nurtured, kindly fed,

Till my wounds and fevered brain

Health and soundness felt again.

Seasons now had passed their round

When I sought my native ground;

But I found no kindred tone,

Fire had swept it, friends were gone;

Men were ploughing, where, in cheer,

Once I chased the noble deer;

Piles of brick, and wood, and stone,

Rose to heavenâthe engineâs groan,

The big wheelâs dash, the rattling train,

Announced the white manâs iron reign.

I sought thy cotâit was a plain

Where reapers reapt the yellow grain;

[Pg 82]

I sought the grove, whose solemn shade

Our council fire so oft displayed:

It was with angled piles beset,

Dome, dwelling, garnished minaret,

Or steeple called;âwith pensive tread

I wound me, where repose the dead,

And long affectionâs pious hand

With evening fires illumed the land;

It was a shorn and mangled glade,

Where not a staddle cast a shade.

Still
thee
I sought, the wide west round,

But need I say, I never found,

Or where thou hadst in solace flown,

To what strange people, not thine own.

At length I came where I could hear

That thou wert living, but not near;

But still so balked by wayward fate,

My footsteps they were eâer too late;

Last, chanced I, with a random aim,

For still I heard thy fatherâs fame,

Ethwaldâs rapid bark to spy

Bound to this magnific sky;

Him I followedâbut no wail,

Word or gesture, told my tale,

[Pg 83]

Trusting some kind chance would ope

Fortune, which I scarce could hope;

And so led, by heavenâs decree,

Ventured in this sylvan sea.

Ask me not of other woes,

Why I chose notâwhy I chose?

Why I did notâwhy I did?

Time will tell what now is hid;

For my joy that thus we meet,

Changing bitter scenes to sweet,

Is as flowing, fair, and free,

As kind heaven could make it be.

ALHALLA.

Warrior, rest thee. Take the seat

Due thy rank and presence meet,

By ancient custom, right and power,

Deemed sacred in the forest bower.

It is our wont, that groom and bride,

As heart in heart, so side by side

Be-seat them: act and sight

Thus simple, seals our forest rite.

To-morrow, ere the dawning east

The sun illumes, prepare the feast,

Where joy and plenty shall preside,

To crown the warrior and his bride.

[Pg 84]

[Pg 85]

MISCELLANIES.

[Pg 86]

Most of the ensuing pieces, having been written
at an early period of life, and at widely distant geographical points,
and many of them having been published in newspapers, magazines, or
other forms, and not before reclaimed, it is conceived that there is a
propriety in retaining the local dates.

[Pg 87]

PONTIACâS APPEAL.

[After the taking of Quebec, in 1759, the North
Western Indians adhered to their Gallic allies, and formed an extensive
combination for retaking all the posts west of the Alleghanies. Pontiac
was the leader and master-spirit of this confederacy, the seat of which
was Detroit. In 1763 he besieged the garrison at that place, with a
large confederated force of Indians, and defeated the besieged at the
battle of Bloody Bridge, killing their commander. The next year Gen.
Bradstreet advanced from Niagara to break up this confederacy, with
an army of 3000 men. The appeal may be supposed to be uttered on this occasion.]

Now, the war-cloud gathers fast,

See it rising on the blastâ

Soon our peace-fire shall be quenchâd,

Soon our blades in gore be drenchâd.

See the red-robed legions pour

From WyÃ¡nockâs
[9]
gulfy shore,

Threatening woe to me and mine,

Means and power, name and line;

None may âscape whose souls are free,

Noneâwho doat on liberty,

Who is true, or who is brave,

Or who scorns to be a slave.

Warriors, up, and hurl them back!

âTis the voice of Pontiac.

Hang the peace-pipe on the wall,

Rouse the nations, one and all,

Bid them for the fight prepare,

Warâred, raging, ruthless war.

[Pg 88]

Now begin the sacred dance,

Raise the club, and shake the lance;

Now prepare the bow and dart,

âTis our fathersâ ancient art.

Other weapons need we none,

All by Indian arms be won;

Let each heart be strong and bold,

As our fathers were of old;

Valiant they, in wood or storm,

Panthersâ doublets kept them warm;

Warriors, rise, and drive them back!

âTis the voice of Pontiac.

Take the wampum, warrior, flyâ

Say, a foreign foe is nigh;

On he comes, with furious breath

Speaking peace, but dealing death;

Spreading oâer our native plains

Forts and banners, fire and chains.

Death comes marching in his trainâ

Death with never-ending painâ

Not the pain that warriors fear;

Not the faggot, ball, or spear;

Not fierce dangerâthat is sweet;

Not the red pineâs burning heat;

But the bane from which we shrink,

Fiery, fell, destroying drink.

New found art to feed the grave,

And sink a freeman to a slave.

Warriors, hear: if deep below,

Where evil dwells, there be a woe

More deadly, bitter, foul, and black,

Than aught that haunts the Red Manâs track,

[Pg 89]

It is to sit, and tamely see

A dog glut up our liberty,

Our life, our soilâeach dear-loved place,

And bind our hands with shackles base.

Upâup, and arm for the attack!

It is the voice of Pontiac.

Is there sachem who is wise?

Him, his country bids arise.

Is there warrior who is brave?

Let him rise, his land to save.

Trust not time shall come again

Eâer to break the iron chain.

Or if now ye waive the blow,

Once again to strike the foe;

Fate forbids itâ
now
ââtis
now
!

Honor calls to seal the vow.

Let the legions clothed with red,

Howl their pathway to the dead,

Sink, or perish in the sea,

But never trample on the free.

Tribe that lags or lingers now

Breaks the spirit-witnessed vow;

Nor shall ever rise again,

Lord or master of the plain.

Thus, in types of cloud and breeze,

Mighty Manito decrees.

I have seen his shining throne;

I have heard himâI alone.

Listâthe paths of truth I track;

âTis the voice of Pontiac.

Ye who skim the big lake floods,

Ye who roam the western woods,

[Pg 90]

Tribes and kindreds, large and small,

Hear the mandatory call;

All who feel with high control

Throbbings of the Indianâs soul,

Come, to save a threatened land

From the rampart and the brand;

From the arts and from the crimes

Bred in transatlantic climes;

From the thirst of pinching gains,

That foredooms our sunny plains,

And the cold unpitying rush,

Name and rule that aims to crush,

Till blow on blow, and stroke on stroke

Bind on the hateful Saxon yoke.

Firmness now is all that saves;

To submit is to be slaves.

Better die as warriors bold,

Than be hunted, tracked and sold;

Living days in misery rife,

For the cowardâs bountyâlife!

Warriors, rally to the field;

Teach the lordly foe to yield;

Spurn his counselsâspurn his laws;

Strike alone for freedomâs cause;

Let confusion cross his track;

âTis the voice of Pontiac.

Let your sufferingsâlet your wrongs

Swell your rising battle songs;

Strike your drums a noble peal,

Boding deeds of strife and steel.

Let your piercing battle yells

Shake the wildest woodland dells,

[Pg 91]

Reaching nations far and nigh,

While our scouts prolong the cry,

Till it reaches every ear

Who the Indianâs wrongs can hear;

Gathering force as on it sweeps

Over mountains, lakes and steeps;

Louderâlouder every hour,

Till it wakes our utmost power,

Rousing all our warlike bands,

Waking all our pillaged lands;

Till one deep, appalling cry,            }

Rings throughout the western sky,        }

Echoing
vengeance
â
liberty
!}

Back! thou bold invader, back!

âTis the voice of Pontiac.

Former woes provoke your ire,

Think
, but hate; and
feel
, but fire;

Every peaceful hue be fled;

Every hue but warlike red.

Strangers occupy our soil;

Sons of dull mechanic toil;

They pollute our ancient seats,

Altars, groves and fond retreats.

Ever claiming deeper grants,

Nothing
can allay their wants,

Or evade their arts or will;

But they drive, and drive us still;

Pouring onward, as they go,

Livid streams of liquid woe,

That subdues the soul when quaffedâ

Bitterâbitterâbitter draught;

[Pg 92]

Of all ills the last and worst,

Spirit-brewed, and spirit-cursed.

Fear not horsemanâs heavy knife;

We can give them life for life,

Blow for blow, and dart for dartâ

Arrows are the woodmanâs art;

Sharp and true, as bow to string,

Let your arrows swiftly sing.

Warriors, on to the attack!

âTis the voice of Pontiac.

Now, my favâring dreams portend

Their ill-gotten power shall end.

Now the goal is reached and won;

Fate decreesâ
it must be done
!

Crush the serpent, ere his length

Tell superior skill or strength.

Strike the panther, ere he springs,

And the mortal fang he flings.

Take the monster grizzle-bear,

Young and feeble, in his lair.

Mar his talonsâblear his sight,

Ere he waxes strong in might;

Else the day shall hasten by,

Else we quickly droop and die;

Or shall linger on our lands,

Frail, dependent, feeble bands;

Weak in numbers, low in fame;

Sad, impovârished, sunk and tame,

Asking alms from door to door,

Where our chieftains
ruled
before,

While the stranger lords it high

âNeath our once joy-kindled sky;

[Pg 93]

And his children, as they turn

From the furrow, blade or urn,

Axe or pestle, pipe or bone,

Once our fathersâ or our own,

Shall with pride indignant spurn,

Name and nation, bone and urn,

And exclaimâ
contemptuous grave!

Indian dog, or Indian slave.

Heavens! and can ye live and burn,

And not on thâ insulter turn?

Have ye hearts, and have ye ears,

And not shake your vengeful spears?

Are ye men by Godâs decrees,

And can suffer taunts like these?

Rend, oh rend the big blue sky,

With your thrilling battle cry:

VengeanceâValorâLiberty!

On, bold hearts, to the attack!

âTis the voice of Pontiac.

GEEHALE.
AN INDIAN LAMENT.

The blackbird is singing on Michiganâs shore,

As sweetly and gaily as ever before,

For he knows to his mate he at pleasure can hie,

And the dear little brood she is teaching to fly.

[Pg 94]

The sun looks as ruddy, and rises as bright,

And reflects oâer our mountains as beamy a light,

As it ever reflected, or ever expressâd,

When my skies were the bluestâmy dreams were the best.

The fox and the panther, both beasts of the night,

Retire to their dens on the gleaming of light,

And they spring with a free and a sorrowless track,

For they know that their mates are expecting them back,

Each bird and each beast, it is blest in degree,

All nature is cheerfulâall happy but me.

I will go to my tent, and lie down in despair,

I will paint me with black and will sever my hair:â

I will sit on the shore where the hurricane blows,

And reveal to the god of the tempest my woes:â

I will weep for a season, on bitterness fed,

For my kindred are gone to the hills of the dead;

But they died not by hunger, or lingâring decay,

The steel of the white man hath swept them away.

This snake skin, that once I so sacredly wore,

I will toss with disdain on the storm-beaten shore;

Its charms I no longer obey or invoke,

Its spirit hath left me, its spell is now broke.

I will raise up my voice to the source of the light,

I will dream on the wings of the blue-bird at night,

I will speak to the spirits that whisper in leaves,

And that minister balm to the bosom that grieves,

And will take a new manitoâsuch as shall seem

To be kind and propitious in every dream.

Oh, then, I shall banish these cankering sighs,

And tears shall no longer gush salt from my eyes.

I shall wash from my face every peace-colorâd stain,

Red, red! shall alone on my visage remain.

[Pg 95]

I will dig up my hatchet and bend my oak bow,

By night and by day, I will follow the foe;

No lake shall repress meâno mountain oppose,

His blood can alone give my spirit repose.

They came to my cabin when heaven was black,

I heard not their comingâI knew not their track,

But I saw by the light of their blazing fusees,

They were people engenderâd beyond the big seas.

My wife and my childrenâoh spare me the tale,â

But who is there left, that is kin to Geehale?

Albany

THE CHOICE.
ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY.

A sweet, retiring, simple, modest mien,

Not shunning, and not seeking to be seen;

A taste in dress and each domestic care,

Neat but not gaudy, pleasing without glare;

Such have I often wished âheavenâs last best giftâ should be,

Such have I oft, with joy, remarked in thee.

An even temper, mild, endearing, kind,

A sound, discreet, and regulated mind,

Improved by reading, by reflection formed,

By reason guided, by religion warmed.

This have I often prayed âheavenâs last best giftâ to be,

This have I oft, with joy, remarked in thee.

[Pg 96]

Benevolent to all, to soothe or cure,

But a firm friend to all the neighbâring poor;

The poor in worldly goods, or
bon ton
merit,

The sunk in sickness, and the bowâd in spirit.

This have I often hoped âheavenâs last best giftâ to be,

This have I oft, with joy, remarked in thee.

Possessing spirit, yet a gentle creature,

Lover of quiet and the charms of nature,

With no vain rage to simper, glare or roam,

Pleased if abroad, but mostly pleased at home.

This have I fondly hoped âheavenâs last best giftâ to be,

This have I oft admired, sweet maid, in thee.

In person comely, rather than renowned,

In books conversant, rather than profound,

With too much sense to slight domestic duty,

Or sigh to shine a wit, or flaunt a beauty.

This have I fondly wished âheavenâs last best giftâ to be,

Such have I seen thee oft, and often hope to see.

In virtue principled, in love sincere,

In manners guarded, in expression clear,

Kind to all others in a just decree,

But fixed, devoted, loving only me.

This have I ever hoped âheavenâs last best giftâ would be,

This have I sought, and heaven-blest, found in thee.

Thee, in whose gentle manners, polished mind,

Grace, sweetness, taste, benevolence are joined,

Sense to engage, a
naivete
to admire,

Candor to please, and love itself to fire.

Thee have I fondly hoped âheavenâs last best giftâ to me,

And all my hopes of bliss are hopes of thee.

[Pg 97]

THE BIRCHEN CANOE.

In the region of lakes, where the blue waters sleep,

My beautiful fabric was built;

Light cedars supported its weight on the deep,

And its sides with the sunbeams were gilt.

The bright leafy bark of the betula
[10]
tree

A flexible sheathing provides;

And the firâs thready roots drew the parts to agree,

And bound down its high swelling sides.

No compass or gavel was used on the bark,

No art but the simplest degree;

But the structure was finished, and trim to remark,

And as light as a sylphâs could be.

Its rim was with tender young roots woven round,

Like a pattern of wicker-work rare;

And it prest on the waves with as lightsome a bound

As a basket suspended in air.

The builder knew well, in his wild merry mood,

A smile from his sweet-love to win,

And he sung as he sewed the green bark to the wood,

Keen ata nee saugein.
[11]

The heavens in their brightness and glory below,

Were reflected quite plain to the view,

And it moved like a swanâwith as graceful a show,

My beautiful birchen canoe.

[Pg 98]

The trees on the shore, as I glided along,

Seemed rushing a contrary way;

And my voyagers lightened their toil with a song,

That caused every heart to be gay.

And still as I floated by rock and by shell,

My bark raised a murmur aloud,

And it danced on the waves as they rose and they fell,

Like a fay on a bright summer cloud.

I thought as I passed oâer the liquid expanse,

With the landscape in smiling array;

How blest I should be, if my life should advance,

Thus tranquil and sweetly away.

The skies were serene, not a cloud was in sight,

Not an angry surge beat on the shore,

And I gazed on the waters, and then on the light,

Till my vision could bear it no more.

Oh! long shall I think of those silver-bright lakes,

And the scenes they exposed to my view;

My friendsâand the wishes I formed for their sakes,

And my bright yellow birchen canoe.

ON LEAVING THE VILLAGE OF GENEVA
IN 1812.

When acts of affection have softenâd the heart,

And taught two fond bosoms in union to glow,

Oh! how sweet is the joy that their meetings impart,

The pleasures how lively from converse that flow.

[Pg 99]

But oh! when the warm hand of friendship sincere,

Is shookâand those pleasures are soon to be past,

How painful the thought, and how galling the fear,

That friends are assembledâperhaps for the last.

Yes! such were the pangs I was destined to know,

When from thy dear circle I lately withdrew;

And I said, as we parted, wherever I go,

Oh! think of me often, and Iâll think of you.

âTis thus we may still, although seas intervene,

In fond recollection past pleasures recall,

And forget in our dreams of the days that have been,

The woes that await usâthe ills that befall.

And oft, as ye rove oâer the frequented green,

Or pause at high noon, to regale in the shade,

Remember how oft with you there I have been,

When summer with roses enamelled the glade.

The flowers of your fields, they were lovely and fair,

And charmed with their fragrance the hours that are gone,

Yet, it had been a desert if youâd not been there,

Ye tender and beautiful nymphs of the lawn.

Adieu, smiling circle; wherever I go,

In memory still shall I turn to this spot,

And cherish thy noble and generous glow,

Till virtue, and friendship, and love be forgot.

[Pg 100]

ON THOSE WHO FELL IN THE WAR OF 1812.

On Niagaraâs banks they sleep,

And in Erieâs stormy deep,

Where the rapid Wabash glides,

On Ontarioâs warlike sides;

By the deep, where Lawrence fell,

Or in lone Moravian dell,

On the field where Pike was slain,

At Sanduskyâat Champlain.

There the bones of heroes rest;

Honorâd, loved, lamented, blest.

Keene, N. H. 1815.

ON THE MARRIAGE OF
MR. SAVAGE TO MISS WILD.
[1811.]

Long had a Savage roved the lonely bower,

Braved the cold storm and trod the dangerous glen,

Till touched by loveâs all humanizing power,

He sought that happiest state of peaceful men.

No more wan care, his tardy hours beguiled,

But fixed in thought, in hymenâs fetters tied,

Deep in the tempting bosom of a Wild,

His every wish, hope, peace and joy abide.

[Pg 101]

LIKES AND DISLIKES.

Whateâer is false, impertinent or dull,

A fop, a meddler, formalist or fool,

Oâerbearing consequence, oâervaunting sense,

The loungerâs visit, and the rakeâs pretence,

The idle manâs excuse, the babblerâs prate,

These ask for censure, and all these I hate.

I hate the cit, whose tread diurnal brings,

Witâs cast-off robes, and learningâs worn-out things.

At home, abroad, in place, or out of place,

With fearful longitude of knowing face,

Repeats the jest, half hitting and half hit,

The vapid ribaldry, which is not
wit
;

Or where misfortune bows a noble heart,

Wounds the searâd bosom with satiric dart.

I hate the sea-fop, whose obtrusive lore,

Repeated oft, can please the ear no more,

Whose vast credulity and only care,

Is to raise wonder, and produce a
stare
;

Yet if they pall, or if the jaded tales

A doubt createsâhe with his â
log-book
â nails.

I hate the tattler, whose bold thirst of fame

Is based on publishing his neighborâs shame,

Whose task it is to catch the latent tale,

The rumored doubt or inuendo stale,

To fan the darling falsehoods as they rise,

To pander scandal, and to retail lies.

[Pg 102]

I hate that ever-busy, bustling man,

Whose wink or nod directs the village clan,

Intent, not on the public weal or good,

Or eâen his ownâa point not understoodâ

But urged by little talent, much pretence,

Ten grains of impudence, and one of sense:

A strange compound of villain, fop, and clown,

He struts the busy-body of the town.

I hate the sly, insidious, smirking
friend
,

Who, ever driving at some secret end,

Bespeaks your interest for a vote or place,

With smiling sweet sincerity of face,

Yet, all the while with bitter malice fed,

Is working to deprive you of your bread.

I hate the gourmand, whose eternal wish

Is centred in a bottle or a dish:

Law without justice, physic without skill,

Priests without reason, laymen without will;

Misguided charity, delusive zeal,

Or for religion, or the common weal:

Power without mercy, humor void of sense,

Affected greatness, beggarly pretence:

A splendor based upon a neighborâs cash,

Rogues escaped halter, prison, stocks or lash,

All these, howeâer allied to fortune or to fate,

Demand my censure, and all these I hate.

My hatreds into love now let me turn:

I love the breast where truth and nature burn,

The virtuous poor man, struggling to be free,

The rich, not dazzled with his high degree;

[Pg 103]

The sageâs wish, the patriotâs calm desire,

The painterâs fancy, and the poetâs fire,

The modest step, the frank, unvarnishâd air,

The fame unsullied, and the virtue fair.

I love the faith, that, principled and clear,

Trusts not alone to frail enjoyments here,

But casting up the firm, imploring eye,

Scans the bright mansions of the starry sky.

I love the hope, that, bound by honorâs ties,

With modest diligence essays to rise;

Trusts to no sudden shower, no falling star,

No wit precocious, no chance-medley care;

But, bent to use aright the talent given,

Performs its part, and leaves the rest to heaven.

I love the charity, that for itself,

And nought beside, conveys the silent pelf.

I love the zeal, that honest, firm, and clear,

Contemns the placemanâs frown, the skepticâs jeer.

I love the rays that winter nights beguile,

I love compassionâs tear, and womanâs smile;

I love the spirit noble in its aims,

The sacred ardor love and friendship claims,

Bland natureâs solitude, the lore of men;

I love my home, my study, and my pen.

[Pg 104]

WASHINGTON.

[On a visit to the tomb of Washington at Mount
Vernon, April 28th, 1822, the writer picked out and selected from the
rude earthen mound which covers it, some plain mineralogical fragments,
which he deposited in a neat paper box in his cabinet, with the
following lines:]

These little relics, if they show

No rubyâs tint, no diamondâs glow,

Yet shall they shed upon my heart,

A joy that gems can neâer impart,

And exercise upon my mind,

A power of talismanic kind;

A power to think, to act, to feelâ

In youth and manhood, wo and weal;

Like him, the lovâd, the great, the blest,

Whose hallowed tomb they lately prestâ

To emulate his noble fires,

His measured aims, his chaste desires,

His firmness in the trying hour,

His modârate use of fame and power;

In social round, his skill to please,

His stately manners, mixâd with ease,

And all those virtues great and bland,

Which erst aroused an injurâd land,

And raised its strength, and winged its ires,

And fannâd its hopes, and curbâd its fires,

And spoke by act, by sword and pen,

Him first of heroes, first of men.

When prest by thought, or danger tried,

By slander stung, or rage defied;

[Pg 105]

These relics shall afford a clue,

The bold to awe, the strong subdue.

And if, in some propitious hour,

One deed of fame, one ray of power,

A wayward fortune should decree

To one so poor and lone as me,

Still should my thoughts to Vernon turn,

To ponder on the heroâs urn,

And, in whispering accents, breathe

My reverence for the dust beneathâ

The sacred dust, which, living, won,

And, deadâstill! still! is Washington:

And each proud hope, and each lone sigh,

Shall be, like him to live, to die.

And when I see the scholar pore

On deeds of glorious fame of yore;

Trimming his lamp, at midnight hour,

To trace the wrecks of bygone power;

Or stealing through sequestered groves,

To sip the tale of Grecian loves;

Or pondâring on the double doom,

Where fame and valor fell with Rome;

And when I hear thâ enthusiast tell

How Fabius foilâd, Marcellus fell,

With triumph shall I quick reply,

At Vernon doth a greater lie;

More firm in war, more just in peace,

And loved with love that neâer can cease;

But time shall seal, and rolling years

Augment his fame, and swell our tears.

Go! shall I say, to yon scrutoire

Of shells and fossils, gems and ore,

[Pg 106]

Cullâd from each clime, and marshallâd there

With home-bred skill and pleasing care;

Amid the glitter, thou shalt find

An humble group of plainest kind,

But prizâd most truly, not for dyes,

But for the scene it typifies:

The airy banks, the cooling groves,

That mark the spot Columbia lovesâ

A spot, which few vain marbles may,

Entombs a virtuous heroâs clay.

Go! and peruse!âno chemic fame,

No foreign, harsh, pedantic name,

With slavish, trite, empiric air,

Inscribes the group enchased there.

With pious hand I cullâd these stones

Upon the tomb that wraps his bones:

He who, while living, ever shinâd,

And, dying, left no peer behind;

Let no rude hand, or unadvisâd,

Molest the boon so lovâd, so prizâd.

THE WHITE FISH.

Of venâson let Goldsmith so wittily sing,

A very fine haunch is a very fine thing;

And Burns, in his tuneful and exquisite way,

The charms of a smoking Scotâs haggis display,

But âtis often much harder to eat than descant,

And a poet may praise what a poet may want;

Less doubt there shall be âtwixt my muse and my dish,

Whilst her power I invoke, in the praise of white fish.

[Pg 107]

All friends to good living by tureen or dish,

Concur in extolling this prince of a fish,

So fine on a platter, so tempting a fry,

So rich in a broil, and so sweet in a pie,

That even before it the red trout must fail,

And that mighty
bonne bouche
of the land, beaverâs tail.

This fish is a subject, so dainty and white,

To show in a lecture, to eat or to write,

That equal âs my joy, I declare on my life,

To raise up my voice, or to raise up my knife;

âTis a morsel alike for the gourmand or faster,

Whiteâwhite as a tablet of pure alabaster;

Its beauty and flavor no person can doubt,

If seen in the water, or tasted without;

And all the dispute that opinion eâer makes,

Of this king of lake fishesâthis deer of the lakes,
[12]

Regards not its choiceness, to ponder or sup,

But the best mode of dressing and serving it up.

Now this is a point where good livers may differ,

As tastes become fixed, or opinions are stiffer;

Some men prefer roastedâsome doat on a fry,

Or extol the sweet savor of
poisson blanc
pie;

The nice
petit patÃ¨
, this palate excites,

While that on a boiled dish and
bouillon
delights;

Some smoked and some salted, some fresh and some dried,

Prefer to all fish in our waters beside;

And âtis thought the main question of epicuresâ look,

Respects not the method so much as the cook;

For, like some moral dishes that furnish a zest,

Whateâer is best served up, is still thought the best.

[Pg 108]

There are, in gastronomy, sages who think

âTis not only the prime of good victuals, but drink,

That all sauces spoil it, the richer the quicker,

And make it insipid, except its own liquor;

These move in a wild epigastric mirage,

Preferring the dish
a la mode de sauvage
,

By which it quells hunger and thirstiness both,

First eating the fish, and then drinking the broth:

We leave this unsettled for palates or pens

Who glean out of hundreds their critical tens,

While drawn to the board where full many a dish

Is slighted to taste this American fish.

The planter, who whirls through the region by steam,

The Creole, who sings as he lashes his team;

The merchant, the lawyer, the cit, and the beau,

The proud and gustative, the poor and the low;

The gay
habitant
âthe inquisitive tourist,

The chemic physician, the dinner-crost jurist,

And even the ladies, the pride of the grove,

Unite to extol it, and eat to approve.

Full oft the sweet morsel, while poised on the knife,

Excites a bland smile in the blooming young wife,

Nor deems she a sea-fish one moment compares,

But is thinking the while not of fish, but of heirs.

To these it is often a casual sweet,

To dine by appointment, or taste as a treat;

Not so, or in mental or physical joy,

Comes the sight of this fish to the
courier de bois
;

That wild troubadour and his joy-loving crew,

Who sings as he paddles his birchen canoe,

And thinks all the hardships that falls to his lot,

Are richly made up at the platter and pot.

[Pg 109]

To him thereâs a charm neither feeble nor vague

In the mighty repast of the
grande Ticameg
;
[13]

And oft as he starves amid Canada snows,

On dry leather lichens and
bouton de rose
,

He cheers up his spirits to think he shall still

Of
poisson blanc bouillon
once more have his fill.

âOh, choice of all fishes,â he sings as he goes,

âThou art sweeter to me than the Normandy rose;

And the venâson thatâs stolân from the parks of the king,

Is never, by half, so delicious a thing.â

The muse might appeal to the science of books

To picture its ichthyological looks,

Show what is its family likeness or odds,

Compared to its cousins, the salmons and cods;

Tell where it approximates, point where it fails,

By counting its fins, or dissecting its scales;

Or prove by plain reasonsâsuch proofs can be hadâ

âTis not âtoothless salmon,â but rather lake shad;

Here, too, might a fancy, to descant inclined,

Contemplate the lore that pertains to its kind,

And bring up tradition in fanciful strains,

To prove its creation from feminine brains;
[14]

Or point out its habits, migrations, and changesâ

The mode of its capture, its cycles and ranges.

But let me forbearââtis the fault of a song,

A tale, or a book, if too learned or long.

Thus ends my discussion. More would you, I pray,

Ask Mitchell, or Harlan, Lesieur, or De Kay.

A TALE OF THE NORTH,
[1830.]

[In 1785, Mr. Alexander Kay, a fur-trader from
Montreal, was stabbed by an Indian at Sandy Lake, on the source of the
Mississippi. By the kindness and medical skill of a friendly chief,
who accompanied him to Michilimackinac, the wound was healed, but
suppurated soon after, on his arrival at the Lake of Two Mountains,
where he died.]

I cannot tell of monarch wise,

Or fameâs loud trumpet swell;

But I can tell a simple tale,

Which on a time befell.

For long ago, for moneyâs sake,

As well as with us now,

Bold men would venture wood and lake,

To fill the golden vow.

And forth the voyager he went,

With goods of richest dye;

And bark that was a sight to see,

Far through the northern sky.

And lakes he past, and snows he trod,

Where wolves and panthers cry,

And natureâs poor, forsaken sons,

The Indians, live and die.

He trafficked for a few brief months,

For skin of beaver black;

And aye he thought with wealth supreme

To hie him quickly back.

[Pg 111]

But still the red man liked him not,

For he had wilful ways;

And ever, when the night returned,

Would burn with passionâs blaze.

The voyager was a drinking man,

And a man of swelling pride,

Whom fury stirrâd, and lust of rule,

And high impatience tried.

And when he had their wealth amassed,

He loathed the Indian boor;

And as with noise they vexâd his peace,

He spurned him from his door.

The Indian is a passive man,

To all observant eyes;

But he has pride, and entertains

Revenge, that never dies.

He has a soul that scorns to live

Where slave or coward be;

And all his goods are free to share,

And wishâis to be free.

Free was he born, and free will die,

And time, however long,

Can neâer erase an injury

While he has pipe or song.

He may be kicked like any dog,

But ah, beware the day,

When he awakes from brawl, or draws

The insult to repay.

[Pg 112]

This found the lordly voyager,

Upon that fatal day,

When deep in northern woods remote

Arose the bloody fray.

And first, in peaceful words began

The deep dissembled plot,

And âgive me drink!â the hunter criedâ

âOff, villain! from my cot.â

He pointed to the door, with air

And gesture of a lord;

Then turned him back within his tent,

With haughty look and word.

Instant the Indian drew his knife,

And in that twinkling frame

He dealt a blow upon his neck,

But dealt with erring aim.

The voyager he had a friend

Among the Indian band,

Who lay and slept, while Christian blood

Thus dyed the yellow sand.

He started up, and drew a knife,

With vengeance in his eye,

And seizâd the murdârer by his hair,

And, âDog!â he utterâd, âdie!â

And with these words, he smote with might,

And pierced the Indian dread,

Who prayed for life, and gasped for breath,

Then sank to earth and bled.

[Pg 113]

On, on they rushed, a furious throng,

For wild disorder reigned;

And drinking, yelling, noise, and song,

The live-long day had stained.

Out furious in the wild melÃ©e,

The voyager he ran,

With streaming wound, and upraised knife,

Averse to counselâs plan.

At once a cry of death arose,

âIâm killed,â he said, and fell:

A deep, low wound, and gushing blood,

Attest the truth I tell.

O ye who hear this living tale,

Your hearts with care berate,

Nor give the red man cause to feel

The bitter pangs of hate.

Learn that strict justice is alike,

Nor favors red, nor white;

That kindness winsâthat patience charms,

Eâen more than beauty bright;

That friendshipâs glow, whateâer the name,

Clime, country, shade or line,

Is eâer the same, if touchâd with truth

And constancy benign.

Lastâsaddest, truest of my songâ

Provoke nor sot, nor king;

Shun passionâs sway, and liquorâs ire,

Nor trust its poison sting.

Sault Ste. Marie
, 1832.

[Pg 114]

THERE IS A TIME TO DIE.

Bury me in the autumn time, when the leaves begin to fall,

And nature oâer her forest grounds extends her leafy pall;

It is a season which I loved when life was young and new,

And often oâer the landscape then I cast a tranquil view.

âTis then the winds, with airy whirl, begin their autumn play,

And merrily over hill and dale, career their buoyant way;

The whispering trees bend down their boughs, as soft they sweep along,

And every leaf that joins the gale contributes to the song.

It is a time when ripened fruits their nut-brown stores display,

And the squirrel nimbly trips it then, his winterâs stock to lay;

The partridge, too, with feathers spread, steps on the hollow tree,

And flaps his wings, with doubling sound, to tell his mate âtis he.

The waters murmur softly then, and, as the trees grow bare,

Display their channels through the woods, and glitter doubly fair.

All nature is mature of mood, and woodland scenes unite,

And man, and herds and flocks all join, to gratify the sight.

The harvestâs in, the fruit is ripe, the flowers are fallân and sere,

And joy and peace and plenty crown the labors of the year:

Then put me in the ground while thus all natureâs in her fill,

I loved the season when I lived, and, dead, shall love it still.

N. Y. 1843.

LINES,
ON THE DEATH OF CAPT. M. M. DOX,

LATE OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY.

Friend of my youth! whom thoughts of other years,

When life was young, and hope was new, endearsâ

Thy solemn change, where all that live must go,

Strikes on my heart a salutary woe.

Oft have I known thee in the social hour,

When mirth and conversation owned thy power,

Or, with one heart, we lingered to explore

Genevaâs woodlands, or Ontarioâs shore;

Oft books or men employed the leisure thought,

Who wrote most happy, who most gallant fought,

Or cogitating plans, left all undone,

How fame is earned, or fortune may be won

To read, to muse, to meditate, to sigh,

We thought of all, but how with faith to die.

Long severed by the varied course of time

By lands remote, by fortune, care, and clime,

What once, in youth, no terrors could impart,

Fate brings with sad sensations to my heart;

Hopeâs brittle thread is severed at a breath,

And all that meets the gazing eye is death.

Arms drew thee forth, when late thy country saw

Right raised on arrogance, power stampt as law;

But me, erewhile, a wayward fortune drew,

Long streams to traverseâboundless plains to view;

While now on arts, and now on letters cast,

Hope bore me lightsome on the western blast,

I but return to honor, with the brave,

A friendâsâa patriotâsâand a soldierâs grave.

Michilimackinac.

[Pg 116]

THE CHIPPEWA GIRL.

They tell me, the men with a white-white face

Belong to a purer, nobler race;

But why, if they do, and it may be so,

Do their tongues cry, âyesââand their actions, âno?â

They tell me, that white is a heavenly hue,

And it may be so, but the sky is blue;

And the first of menâas our old men say,

Had earth-brown skins, and were made of clay.

But throughout my life, Iâve heard it said,

Thereâs nothing surpasses a tint of red;

Oh, the white manâs cheeks look pale and sad,

Compared to my beautiful Indian lad.

Then let them talk of their race divine,

Their glittering domes, and sparkling wine;

Give me a lodge, like my fathers had,

And my tall, straight, beautiful Indian lad.

SHINGABAWOSSIN.

[A ruling chief of the Chippewa nation, of noble
mien and respected character, who died and was buried on the banks of
lake Superior in 1828, aged about 76.]

Blest be the spot that marks the chieftainâs tombâ

There let the bright red flowers of summer bloom,

And, as the winds sweep heavily along,

Be they the warriorâs chant and funeral song;

And yearly there, his native woods shall fling

Their leafy honors oâer their sylvan king,

While far around, the big and stormy wave

Casts foamy incense oâer his rustic grave.

killed in battle; he came voluntarily to Gen. Jacksonâs camp and
surrendered himself. He had disguised himself in mean clothes to
prevent his being shot down by the soldiers, as a price had been set
on his head. Hence the nobility of his declaration, on entering the
Generalâs tentââI am Tuscaloosa.â

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

INTRODUCTION

Damas.
* * * The Prince of Como does not

understand his own language.

Melnotte.
Not as you pronounce it: Who the

deuce could?

It may be regarded as one of the commendable
peculiarities of the English language that, despite
provincialisms, vulgarisms, neglected education, foreign
accent, and the various corrupting influences to
which it is subjected, it may be understood wherever
it is heard, whatever differences of distance or
associations may have existed between the speaker
and the listener, both claiming familiarity with it.
Considering these influences and the arbitrariness of
the orthoepical rules of the language, there has been
expressed surprise that frequent degenerations into
uncouth dialects or patois have not occurred. A
decent regard for the common weal should cause
gratification that such degenerations have not taken
place, for were it not for the ability of our tongue
to preserve its individuality against the tendency
toward corruption, we might reasonably fear such a
Babel-like confusion, that, when asked, "Do you

[Pg iv]

speak English?" one might appropriately,
sans
the
profanity, reply in the language of the text, "Not
as you pronounce it: Who the deuce could?" While
the majority of people place no other value upon
language than that of convenience, and are indifferent
to any corruption, so long as they can simply
understand and be understood, there is happily a
better class, the æsthetic cultivation of which is such
that those who belong to it are anxious to preserve
the purity of our vernacular and are ashamed of all
errors of speech in their daily conversations. For
such it will not be uninteresting to look over a number
of errors, principally of pronunciation, that are
not formally laid down as such in books, and which
people, even many of the best educated, are constantly
committing, just because they have never had
their attention called to them. These errors are becoming
more deeply rooted every day and if not
soon eradicated, it will not be many years before our
orthoepic standard will be overthrown as it was in
England some years ago.

Smart, one of the most celebrated of English orthoepists,
in the preface of his dictionary says: "The
proprietors of Walker's dictionary, finding it would
slide entirely out of use unless it were adapted to
the present day, engaged me as a teacher of elocution,
known in London since Walker's time, to make
the necessary changes." A standard pronouncing
dictionary is a work that involves an extraordinary

[Pg v]

amount of labor and research in its compilation,
and exerts an influence almost autocratical. The
possibility of its becoming worthless in a short time
is strange, especially when it is not on account of
any work claiming superiority, but merely because
error long persisted in finally becomes more authoritative
than the original exemplar. With little effort,
however, we can discern the causes. Persons are apt
to acquire the pronunciation and use of the greater
number of words by imitation, rather than by study.
With confidence in the knowledge of the parent,
teacher, minister, physician and others, their examples
are followed without ever considering that they
are often very fallible guides.

A complete dictionary is an immense volume, and
to turn over its pages with even a casual observation
of each word, requires an amount of time that few
would feel like devoting to it; and yet this is the
only way in which a person can become
assured
of
the sanctioned pronunciation and meaning of a great
many words. If they would make it an invariable
rule to make memoranda of all the words they read
or hear spoken, about the orthoepy and import of
which they are not absolutely certain, and at their
first leisure opportunity would consult their chosen
authority, it would not be long before the majority
of errors would be corrected; but this requires memory,
inclination, time, continuity of purpose, possession
of dictionaries or access to them—circumstances

[Pg vi]

that are seldom found combined. It will doubtless
be useless to rehearse any of the arguments commonly
employed to prove the necessity of having
some sovereign standard, to the guidance of which we
must be willing to submit. Those for whom this
work is intended will be willing to admit that. Nor
is it necessary to assert that as far as the English
speakers of the United States are interested, the only
works that lay claim to such a position are the dictionaries
of Webster and Worcester. If the right
of the opinions of the majority of scholars throughout
the land were alone considered, the former would
certainly be entitled to the preference; but the work
of the latter is too full of merit and has too many
adherents in the ranks of the educated to permit
any one to say that it is not worthy of high esteem.

With my own preference for the former and with
my willingness to acknowledge the worth of the latter,
I have consulted both authorities concerning
every word in the following vocabulary—that is,
every word requiring reference to either. It will be
seen that there is much less difference between the
decisions of the two dictionaries than is commonly
supposed. By this reference to each, I have not only
corrected errors in an impartial manner, but have also
stopped up that loop-hole through which so many try
to escape by saying, when they are called to account
according to one dictionary, that they do not accept
that as their standard. As far as the people of this

[Pg vii]

country are concerned, there is no escape from the
conclusion that a person is considered a correct or
an incorrect speaker of English, according to whether
or not he conforms his discourse to one of the above
mentioned authorities. At first glance it will appear
that the size of this volume is not at all commensurate
to the task of correcting the many errors that
are heard in our communication with all classes that
pretend to speak the English language. It is not
intended to instruct those whose education has been
so neglected that they are guilty of the grossest violation
of syntax and orthoepy, nor to cultivate the
taste of those whose selection of words and cant and
slang phrases betrays the low grade of the associations
by which they have been surrounded. It is
designed rather as a collection of the more common
of those errors, chiefly orthoepical, that I have before
spoken of as being of constant occurrence even
among people of education, unless they have paid
considerable attention to philology or
belles-lettres
.
If by presenting them in this convenient form, thus
saving much time and trouble in referring to the
dictionary, I have merited the thanks of my readers,
or if I have contributed even a mite toward the conservation
of the present usage, I shall feel amply
repaid.

I have taken advantage of the alphabetical arrangement
to introduce a few miscellaneous errors that
might have been placed under a separate heading.

[Pg viii]

Instead of dividing the words into syllables and
loading them with marks as is usually done in dictionaries,
I have thought that it would make a deeper
impression on the memory to present the words
as they are commonly seen in print, depending on
respelling to furnish the correct and incorrect accent
and pronunciation.

The corrections have first been made according to
Webster; if Worcester is unmentioned, it is to be
understood that both authorities agree.

Obscure vowel sounds, or those which are glided over in
a word without any noticeable accent, are unmarked. In
those cases where the pronunciation is so evident that mistakes
seem improbable, the marks are also omitted.

[Pg 11]

EVERY-DAY ERRORS

OF

SPEECH.

A.

Abacus
—ab´a-kŭs, not a-băk´ŭs.

Abdomen
—ab-dō´men, not ab´do-men.

Acclimate
—ak-klī´māte, not ak´kli-māte.

Acclimated
is also accented on the second syllable.

Acclimatization
—ak-kli-mat-i-zā´shun, not
ak-klī´ma-ti-zā-shun.

Adult
—a-dŭlt´, not ăd´ult.

Aerated
—ā´er-ā-ted, not ā´rē-ā-ted.
"
Areated bread
" is a mistake that is frequently
made.

Ailantus
—ā-lăn´tŭs, not ā-lăn´thŭs;
ăt-lăn´tus is a still worse error.

Albumen
—al-bū´men, not al´bu-men.

Alder
—awl´der, not ăl´der;
it is the name of a
tree
and
does not mean the ordinary
elder
.

Alike.
It is sufficient to say
that two persons or things
are
alike
, not
both alike
.
The word associated with

alike
is just as unnecessary
as it is with
resemble
and

equal
in the following sentences:
"These two men

both
resemble each other."
"These two sums are
both

equal."

Allopathy
—al-lŏp´a-thy, not
al´lo-path-y.

Allopathist
is similarly accented.

Alpaca
—al-păk´a, not al-la-păk´a.

Altercate
—ăl´ter-kāte, not
awl´ter-kate.

Amenable
—a-mē´na-ble, not
a-mĕn´a-ble.

Among.
A thing is divided

among
many and
between

two.

Amour
—a-mōōr´, not am´-mōre
nor ā´mōōr.

Angry.
Say angry
with
a person
and
at
a thing.

Animalcula
is the plural of

[Pg 12]

animalculum
; there is no
such word as
animalculœ
.
Animalcule (singular) and
animalcules (plural), are
proper words; the former
is pronounced an-i-mal´kūle
and the latter an-i-mal´kūlz.

Antarctic
—ant-ärk´tik, not
ant-är´tik.

Antepenult
—an-te-pe-nŭlt´,
not an-te-pē´nŭlt.

Apex
—ā´pex, not ăp´ex.

Apparatus
—ap-pa-rā´tus, not
ap-pa-răt´us.

Aquaria
, not
aquariums
, is
the plural of
aquarium
.

Arabic
—ăr´a-bĭk, not a-răb´ĭk,
a-rā´bĭk, nor ăr´a-băk;
which errors are very common,
especially in the compound
word
gum-arabic
.

Arbitrary
is often incorrectly
pronounced as if spelled

ar-bi-ta-ry
.

Archangel
—ärk-ān´jel, not
ärch-ān´jel.

Archbishop
—ärch-bish´op,
not ärk-bish´op.

Archipelago
—ärk-i-pel´a-gō,
not ärch-i-pel´a-gō.

Architect
—är´ki-tect, not
är´chi-tect.

Archives
—är´kīvez, not är´chīvez,
nor är´kēvez.

Arctic
—ärk´tik, not är´tik.

Arid
—ăr´id, not ā´rid.

Aroma
—a-rō´ma, not ăr´o-ma.

At
should not be used when
it has no possible connection
with the other words
of a sentence; as, "Where
are you living
at
?"

At all
, not a tall.

Attacked
, not attackted.

Auction
—awk´shun, not ŏk´shun.

Ay
or
Aye
, meaning
yes
, and

aye
, an affirmative vote,
are pronounced äĭ and not
ī nor ā.

Aye
, meaning forever, always
(used chiefly in poetry),
is pronounced ā not
ī nor äĭ.

B.

Bade
—băd, not bāde.

Badinage
—băd´in-äzh, not
băd´in-āje. Worcester gives
the same pronunciation,
but places the accent on
the last syllable.

Balance.
There are two
common errors connected
with this word. One is to
write it
ballance
: the other
is to use it in the sense of

remainder
,
rest
, etc.; as, the

balance
of the day, the
balance

of the people. Balance
means properly "the
excess on one side, or what
added to the other makes
equality." The corrupt use
of the word, as above mentioned,
is laid down as a
vulgarism.

Bantam
, not
banty
.

Bellows
—bĕl´lŭs, not bĕl´lōz.
The plural is the same as
the singular.

[Pg 13]

Besom
—bē´zum, not bē´sum.
A broom.

Betroth
—be-trŏth, not be-trōth.

Betrothed
,
Betrothal
,
etc., are similarly
pronounced.

Blacking
, not
blackening
for
boots and shoes.

Blouse
—blowz, not blowss.

Bologna
—bō-lōn´ya, not bō-lō´na.

Bologna
sausage,

Bologna
phial, etc.

Bona fide
—bō´na-fī´de, not
bō´na-fīde nor bŏn´a-fīde.

Booth.
The
th
is sounded
as in the preposition
with
,
not as in
both
.

Bouquet
—bōō-kā´ or boōō´kā,
not bō-kā´.

Bourgeois
, meaning a kind
of type, is pronounced bür-jois´,
not like the following
word:

Bourgeois
, a citizen, pronounced
bōōr-zhwaw´.

Brand-new
, not
bran-new
.
Although the latter adjective
is much used, it is evidently
a corruption of the
former. An article in its
newness may be bright like
a
brand
of fire, or the
brand

of the manufacturer may
remain intact, but there is
certainly no
bran
about it.

Breeches
—brĭtch´ez, not as
spelled.

Bretzel
, not
pretzel
. A brittle
German cake.

Brilliant.
A diamond of the
finest cut, with its faces and
facets so arranged as to secure
the greatest degree
of brilliancy—whence the
name. The name to many
conveys the idea of paste,
or imitation. A
rose
diamond
may be just as pure,
but its depth does not permit
it to be made a
brilliant

of without a much greater
loss of substance.

Brougham
—brōōm or brōō´am,
not brō´am nor brow´am.
A kind of carriage.

Burst
,
Burst
and
Bursting
,
not
bust
,
busted
and
busting
.

C.

Calculate
is often inappropriately
used in lieu of
believe
,

suppose
,
expect
, etc., as
in the following sentences:
"I
calculate
you are my
friend;" "I
calculate
the
report is true." Still worse
than this passive misuse
is that active one of using
the word in some such
sense as this: "Doctor, I
know that you are a man
of great intelligence and I
have unlimited confidence
in your honor and ability;
but I must say that I think
the course of treatment
pursued by you during this
epidemic, is
calculated
to increase
the mortality among
your patients." How inconsistent
with the encomium
is the dreadful accusation

[Pg 14]

just following!
As if the Doctor had sat
down and
calculated
how
he could cause injury rather
than benefit. Calculate
means to ascertain by
means of figures or to
study what means must be
used to secure a certain
result. A person may
make a speech, write a
book, or do anything else

calculated
to do good, or
more rarely, evil, but the
intention to accomplish
the object spoken of must
be present, before the word
can be properly used.

Calliope
—kal-lī´o-pe, not
kal´li-ōpe.

Calvary
, not
cavalry
, when
the place of our Saviour's
crucifixion is meant.

Camelopard
—ka-mel´o-pärd
or kam´el-o-pärd, not kam-el-lĕop´ard.

Cantatrice
—kăn-ta-trē´che,
not kăn´ta-treess.

Canon
—kăn´yun, not kăn´nun.
A deep gorge or ravine.
Spelled also
Canyon
,
pronounced kän-yōn´ or
kăn´yon.

Capoch
—ka-pōōtsh´, not ka-pōch´.

Capouch
is another
orthography.

Caption
in the sense of the
heading of a discourse,
chapter, page, etc., is not
sanctioned by good writers.

Carminative
—kär-mīn´a-tive,
not kär´mi-nā-tive.

Casualty
—kăzh´u-al-ty, not
kăz-u-ăl´i-ty.

Cater-cornered
—kā´ter-cor-nered,
not kăt´ty-cor-nered.
Not down, thus
compounded in Webster,
but his pronunciation of
the separate words is as
given. Worcester gives
the word as above and defines
it as an adjective—diagonal.
It is generally
used though, I believe, as
an adverb; as, "the piano
stands cater-cornered" (diagonally).
It is regarded as
an inelegant word, diagonal
and diagonally being
preferred: though it is
probable that this opinion
has been caused by the
abominable pronunciations

catty
and
kitty
cornered.

Catalpa
—ka-tăl´pa, not ka-tawl´pa.

Catch
,
Catching
—kătch and
kătching, not kĕtch and
kĕtching.

Catholic
means liberal, general,
not bigoted, and not

Roman
Catholic, unless
specially so applied.

Caucasian
—kaw-kā´sian,not
kaw-kāzh´ian, kaw-kăsh´ian,
kaw-kāz´ian nor kaw-kăss´ian.

Cayenne
—kā-ĕn´, not kī-ĕn´.

Chaps
—chŏps, not chăps.
The jaws.
Chops
is also
correct orthography.

Chasten
—chās´en, not chăs´en.

Chastened
,
chastening
,

[Pg 15]

etc., have also the
long a.

Chew
, not
chaw
. The latter
word either as a verb or
noun is now considered
quite vulgar.

Chid
, not chī´ded, is the imperfect
tense of chide.

Chimera
—kĭ-mē´ra, not chi-mē´ra,
nor kī-mē´ra.

Chivalric
—shĭv´al-rik, not
shĭv-ăl´rik. Worcester allows
the latter.

Chivalrous
—shĭv´al-rŭs, not
shĭv-ăl´rus.   Worcester
gives chĭv´al-rus also.

Chivalry
—shĭv´al-ry, not
chĭv´al-ry. Worcester
sanctions both.

Cicerone
—chē-che-rō´ne or
sĭs-e-rō´ne, not sĭs´e-rōne.
A guide.

Citrate
—sĭt´rate, not sī´trate.
"Citrate of magnesia."

Climbed
, not clomb (klum).
One climbs
up
but does not
climb
down
.

Cochineal
—kŏch´i-neel, not
kō´chi-neel nor kō´ki-neel.

Cocoa
(kō´kō) is not made
from the cocoa-nut or tree,
but from the seeds of the

cacao
(ka-kā´o) or chocolate
tree. The word is evidently
a perversion, but it
has gained a permanent
footing in its present signification.

Cognomen
—kŏg-no´men,
not kŏg´no-men.

Cold-chisel
, not
coal-chisel
.
It is a chisel of peculiar
strength and hardness for
cutting
cold
metal.

Cole-slaw.
In the former
editions of some dictionaries
it has been taught
that this word is derived
from
cole
meaning cabbage,
and
slaw
meaning salad.
Cole-slaw—cabbage-salad.
The uninstructed soon
changed the
cole
into
cold

and substituted
hot
for the
other extreme of temperature,
thus entirely changing
the signification. What
was really meant, was
hot
cole-slaw
and
cold cole-slaw
.
Many persons still regard

cole-slaw
as the proper
word, and receipt books
give that orthography. The
last editions of Webster and
Worcester, however, only
give the words
cole
and

slaw
in separate places and
define the latter as "sliced
cabbage."

Combatant
—kŏm´bat-ant,
not kom-băt´ant.

Combativeness
—kŏm´bat-ive-ness,
not kom-băt´ive-ness.

Come
is often thoughtlessly
used for
go
or some other
word. If How is just leaving
Howard's house it is
right for How to say, "I'll
come to see you soon," but
Howard could not properly
say,
at that place
, the
same thing. He should
say, "I will go to see you

[Pg 16]

soon." If they both live in
Philadelphia and should
meet in New York, neither
could say appropriately,
"I'll come to see you after
I get home;" that would
mean that one would travel
back from his home in
Philadelphia to New York
to see the other. But either
might say, "Come and
see me when you get
home."

Comparable
—kŏm´pa-ra-ble,
not kŏm-păr´a-ble.

Complaisance
—kŏm´pla-zans,
not kŏm-plā´zăns. In
complaisant and complaisantly,
the accent is also on
the first syllable. Worcester
places it on the third,
thus: complaisant (kom-pla-zănt´),
etc.

Comptroller
—kon-trōl´ler,
not kŏmp-trōl´ler.

Conduit
—kŏn´dĭt or kŭn´dit,
not kŏn´duĭt or kŏn´dūte.
A pipe or canal for the
conveyance of fluid.

Confab
, not
conflab
. A contraction
of confabulation.

Congeries
—kŏn-jē´rĭ-eez,
not kon-jē´rēz nor kŏn´je-rēz.
A collection of particles
into one mass.

Contemptuous
, not
contemptible
,
when the manifestation
of contempt for
another is meant. I once
heard a young lady describing
how she had withered
at a glance a poor
young man that had incurred
her displeasure. "O,
I gave him such a
contemptible

look," said she. If
in the enthusiasm of the
rehearsal, the look that
dwelt upon her features
was akin to that given upon
the occasion mentioned,
no auditor doubted the exact
truth of what she said;
but she meant differently.

Contiguous
—kon-tig´ū-ŭs,
not kon-tĭj´ū-ŭs.

Contour
—kŏn-tōōr´, not
kŏn´tōōr. The boundary
lines of a figure.

Contra-dance
is better than

country-dance
, the latter
word being a corruption;
but it has become admissible
from long use.
Contredanse

is the French original,
and means that the parties
stand opposite to each
other.

Contrary
—kŏn´tra-ry, not
kon-trā´ry, interfering with
the rhythm of the distich
from Mother Goose's Melodies:

"Mary, Mary, quite contrary,

How does your garden grow?"

Contumacy
—kŏn´tu-ma-sy,
not kon-tū´ma-sy. Obstinacy,

From Webster's
dictionary are taken the
following definitions and
remarks:

1. "One born in America,
or the West Indies, of
European ancestors.

2. "One born within or
near the tropics, of any
color. 'The term creole
negro is employed in the
English West Indies to
distinguish the negroes
born there from the Africans
imported during the
time of the slave trade.
The application of this
term to the colored people
has led to an idea common
in some parts of the
United States, though wholly
unfounded, that it implies
an admixture greater
or less of African blood.'—R. Hildreth."

No such word as

is seen.

Deficit
—dĕf´i-sit, not de-fī´sit
nor de-fĭs´sit. A deficiency.

Delusion
, not
illusion
, when
deception occurs from want
of knowledge of the world,
ignorance of business or
trade, or from lack of acumen

[Pg 18]

generally. Illusions
are deceptions arising from
a temporarily or permanently
disordered imagination,
or from phenomena
occurring in nature: thus
we speak of the illusions
of fancy, of dreams, and of
optical illusions. The mirage
of the desert and the
fata Morgana are instances
of the latter.

The French is déshabillé,
pronounced about
like dā-zä-be-yā, without
any particular accent.
Some persons, in their vain
efforts to get the peculiar
liquid sound of the double
l, sometimes used, distort
the word terribly, pronouncing
it even as broad
as dĭs-ha-beel´yuh.

Desideratum
—de-sid-e-rā´tum,
not de-sĭd-er-ăt´um;

and
Dolorousness
are
similarly accented; but

dolor
is pronounced dō´lor.

Doubt.
"I do not doubt
but that it is so," is a very

[Pg 19]

common error. The meaning
conveyed is just the
opposite to that which the
speaker intends. He declares
in other words, that
he has
no
doubt
but
a doubt
that it is so; or he does not
doubt that it is false. "I
have no doubt but," and
"there is no doubt but,"—are
similar mistakes. The
word "but" should be left
out.

Dough-face
means one that
is easily molded to one's
will, or readily changed in
his views, and not a putty-faced
or white-faced person.

[Pg 20]

small ornaments and fancy
articles upon; a what-not.

—ex-krĕs´sense
not ex-krē´sense. A superfluous
appendage: morbid
outgrowth.

Expect
has reference to the
future only, and not to the
present or past. "I
expect

that you are wrong." "I

expect
you were disappointed
yesterday," are
errors. There is an abundance
of words that may be
correctly used, as
suppose
,

suspect
,
imagine
,
believe
and

think
.

Expose
(Fr. exposé)—ĕks-po-zā´,
not ex-pōz´. An
exposition; statement.

is accented on the first syllable
also.

even by dentists, erroneously
given to the
root
or
part that is set into the jaw.

, not
fur
.

—fē´brĭl or fĕb´rĭl, not

Forage
—fŏr´aje, not fō´raje.

Forceps
—fôr´seps, not fōr´seps.
The word is spelled
the same in both the singular
and the plural numbers.
Such mistakes as,
"hand me a forcep," instead
of "hand me a
forceps," are very common.
Strictly speaking,
"a pair of forceps," ought,
I suppose, to mean
two
forceps;
but like the expressions
"a pair of scissors"
and "a pair of stairs," the
phrase has been in use so
long that it must be tolerated.

Forehead
—fŏr´ed, not fōr´hĕd.
Worcester allows
either.

Worcester gives the
latter.

Fuzz
, not
furze
, is the word
to use, if used at all, when
the embryo whiskers, or
the downy surface of fruit,
etc., are meant. Down is
the more appropriate
word.
Furze
is the name
of an evergreen shrub.

G.

Gallivating
, not
gallivanting
.
Gallivanting is a word that
is used to some extent, being
applied to persons that
are roaming about for
amusement or adventure;
as, "this young man has
been
gallivanting
around."
If it is a corruption of
gallanting
,
it should certainly
be abolished as a vulgarism;
but if it is a corruption
of
gallivating
, from

gallivat
, the name of a
small sailing vessel, it
might be clothed in its
proper garb and retained
as a useful word in our
language. If either is used,
the one above preferred
should be chosen, at any
rate.

(jĕn-e-a-lŏj´i-kal)

(jĕn-e-a-lŏj´i-kal-ly).

Got.
There are some sticklers
for niceties that overdo
themselves in contending
that the use of the verb

got
is generally unnecessary
and incorrect in conjunction
with
have
and
had
.
Get means to procure, to
obtain, to come into possession
of, etc., and it is a
very tame assertion that
one simply
has
a thing
that cost much mental or
physical labor. A scholar

has
his lesson, but did it
creep into his head while
he passively shut his eyes
and went to sleep? On the
contrary, he
got
it or
learned it by hard study,
and it is proper to say that
he has
got
it. A man
has

a cold, but he
got
it or
took

it by exposing himself. A
person
has
a sum of money,
but he
got
or
earned
it by
his labor. Another
has

good friends, but he
got
or

secured
them by his pleasant
address. The great
causes of the warfare
against this word are, I
think, that
have
and
had
,
though generally used as
auxiliaries, can sometimes
be used as principal verbs
and make good sense; and
that it has not been recollected
that in the majority
of cases
got
either stands
for, or can be substituted
for another verb. In confirmation

[Pg 23]

of this last statement,
is appended the following
composed by Dr.
Withers: "I
got
on horseback
within ten minutes
after I
got
your letter.
When I
got
to Canterbury,
I
got
a chaise for town, but
I
got
wet before I
got
to
Canterbury; and I have

got
such a cold as I shall
not be able to
get
rid of in
a hurry. I
got
to the Treasury
about noon, but first of
all I
got
shaved and dressed.
I soon
got
into the secret
of getting a memorial
before the board, but I
could not
get
an answer
then; however, I
got
intelligence
from the messenger,
that I should most likely

get
one the next morning.
As soon as I
got
back
to my inn, I
got
my supper
and
got
to bed. It was not
long before I
got
asleep.
When I
got
up in the
morning, I
got
my breakfast,
and then I
got
myself
dressed that I might
get

out in time to
get
an answer
to my memorial. As
soon as I
got
it, I
got
into
the chaise and
got
to Canterbury
by three, and about
tea-time, I got home. I
have
got
nothing for you,
and so adieu."

Applying this test of
substitution to any doubtful
case, I think it right to
assert that if there is no
other verb, or participle,
that will appropriately
take the place of "got,"
the latter word is
unnecessary
;
but it should hardly
be considered as an error,
as it is so slight an impropriety
compared with
many others that are allowed,
and especially because
we have long had the
usage of many of the best
writers to sanction the employment
of the word. The
very people that appear to
be so shocked at the use of
the superfluous
got
, may
generally be heard making
use of such expressions
as "fell
down
upon the
ground," "rose
up
and
went away," "covered it

over
," and "a great,
big

fire." The
down
,
up
,
over

and
big
are certainly superfluities,
but they have
been heard so long that
they are seldom mentioned
as errors.

Gourmand
—gōōr´mänd, not
gôr´mand, unless the orthography

gormand
is
used.

Gout
—gowt, not gōōt, as actors
are sometimes heard
pronounce it in the following
line from Macbeth:
"On thy blade and dudgeon,

gouts
of blood."

Government
—gŭv´ern-ment
not gŭv´er-ment. It is a

[Pg 24]

mistake, frequently made,
to write and pronounce the
word as if it had no "n"
in the penultimate.

Gramercy
—gra-mër´sy, not
grăm´er-sy. A word formerly
used to express

not hŏl´ler. Worcester
gives
halloo
(hal-lōō´),

holla
(hŏl-lä´),
hollo
(hŏl-lō´)
and
hollow
(hŏl´lōw
or hŏl-lōw´). It is strange
that with such a variety of
words to choose from, people
generally say "
holler
."

Hanged
is preferable to

hung
, when the infliction
of the death penalty
by hanging is meant.

Harass

Harem
—hā´rem, not hăr´em.
Worcester gives hä´rem
also. Written also
haram

(ha-răm´).

Hardly.

Don't
and
can't

should not be used with

hardly
. Such errors as,
"I don't hardly believe
it," are not uncommon.

Hardly
means
scarcely
, and
the use of don't or can't
gives an opposite signification
to the sentence.

ĭm-brŏl´yō. Worcester says

Lay
. This word in the sense
here considered is a transitive
verb, or one in which
the action or state implied
by the verb, passes over to
an object. The present
tense is
lay
; the imperfect
tense and past participle
are
laid
; and the present
participle
laying
. Requiring
an object in each of
the various meanings attached
to it, it is proper to
say: "The hen
lays
an egg
every day;" "The man
laid

his load on the ground;"
"The rain has
laid
the
dust;" "The hunter is
laying

a snare." The verb
lie

is an
intransitive
verb and
can have
no object
after it.
The present tense is
lie
; the
imperfect tense is
lay
; the
past participle is
lain
; the
present participle is
lying
.
Having no objective case
to which the action or state
passes over, it is correct to
say: "Ohio
lies
north of
Kentucky;" "The sick
man
lay
upon the bed yesterday;"
"He has
lain

there helpless for weeks;"
"The goods I bought are

lying
on my hands." Contrasting
the sentences under
each verb it will be
readily seen that Ohio does
not
lie
Kentucky, but the
hen
lays
the egg; the invalid
did not
lay
the bed like
the man
laid
his load; he
has not
lain
anything, as
the rain has
laid
the dust;
and the goods are not
lying

anything, as the hunter is

laying
the snare. If the
foregoing differences have
been carefully observed, I
imagine that it will always
be easy to select the proper
word by remembering
the following rules:

1. If the person or thing
spoken of exerts an action
that must pass over to an
object, use
lay
,
laid
and

laying
.

2. If the person or thing
spoken of exerts an action
that does not pass over to
an object, use
lie
,
lay
,
lain

and
lying
.

"He
laid
upon the bed,"
then, is incorrect, for the
verb has no object. It
should be: "He
lay
upon
the bed." But, "He
laid

himself
upon the bed,"
would be correct, for there
is an objective case,
himself
,
supplied. "Let these papers

lay
," should be, "Let
these papers
lie
." "The
ship
lays
at anchor," should

[Pg 28]

be, "The ship
lies
at anchor."
"The ship
laid
at
anchor," should be, "The
ship
lay
at anchor." "They
have
laid
in wait for you,"
should be, "They have

lain
in wait for you." "This
trunk is
laying
in our way,"
should be, "This trunk is

lying
in our way." Errors
connected with the use of
these verbs are more common,
probably, than any
others in our language,
being detected in the conversation
and writings of
many of the best educated
people. Attention to the
above rules, and a few trial
sentences in the different
moods, tenses, numbers
and persons, ought to make
the selection of the proper
word so simple, that persons
should seldom make
mistakes.

Learn.

Learning
is done by
the scholar or student, and

teaching
by the instructor.
"She will
learn
me how to
play," should be, "She
will
teach
me how to play,"
etc.

Leasing
—leez´ing, not lēs´ing.
An obsolete word
meaning falsehood; lying.
"Thou shalt destroy them
that speak leasing."—
Bible.

Leg.
Of late years there
has become quite popular
a prudish notion that it is
indelicate to say
leg
when
one of the limbs that supports
the human body is
meant,
limb
being preferred
instead.
Leg
is certainly
a less euphonious
word than
limb
, and if the
latter had the same signification
attached to it,
there would be no objection
to its employment;
but
limb
means
arm
just as
much as it does
leg
. There
is nothing immodest in the
sound or meaning of the
word
leg
; if there were, it
would be well to speak of
the
limb
of a table, a
limb

of mutton, or a three

limbed
stool; and the mention
of such words as
legacy

or
legate
should cause
the blush to rise to our
cheeks. The very use of
the word
limb
indicates
what is passing in the mind
of the speaker—a thought
of
leg
, an indelicate meaning
attached to it, and a
fear to speak the word.
The mind of the listener
is affected similarly and
the result is that a conversation
intended to be perfectly
pure, has a slight
stain left upon it. If we
could pass through life
without ever finding it necessary
to speak of our legs
to strangers, there would
be no danger of compromising
ourselves; but run-away
and other accidents

[Pg 29]

are constantly occurring in
which legs are broken or
otherwise injured. When
a surgeon is called, if he is
told that a
limb
is injured,
he has one chance in four
of guessing the riddle. It
is not always safe to trifle
thus with some of the serious,
practical old followers
of Esculapius. Before
now they have given such
rebukes as to make people
ashamed that they did not
say
leg
in the first place;
or they have left the bedside
abruptly with such a
remark as: "When you
find out whether it is your
arm or your leg, send for
me again." If people will
persist in using
limb
for

leg
, it is to be hoped that
they will adopt some adjective
prefix to remove all
ambiguity. How would
north-east, south-east, etc.,
do? Any one informed
that the
south-east limb
was
fractured, would know at
once that it was the
right

leg
.

Legate
—lĕg´ate, not lē´gāte.

Legendary
—lĕj´end-a-ry,
not lē´jĕnd-a-ry.

Leisure
—lē´zhur, not lĕzh´ur,
nor lā´zhur.

etc.

. The
mythological and poetical
name of a river of the infernal
region, the drinking
of a portion of which
caused forgetfulness of the
past.

Lethean
—lē-thē´an, not lē´the-an.

Let's.
It should be remembered
that
let's
is really
let

us
, the apostrophe denoting
the elision of the u.
Such expressions then as:
"let's us go," "let's him
and me go," should he,
"let us go" (or let's go),
and "let him and me go;"
for who wishes to say "let
us us go," or "let us him
and me go."

Leverage
—lĕv´er-aje, not lē´ver-aje.

Licorice
—lĭk´o-rĭs, not lĭk´er-ĭsh.

Lie.
See
Lay
.

Lien
—lē´en or lī´en, not
leen
.
A charge upon property

debt.

Lighted
is preferable to lĭt as
the imperfect tense and
past participle of
light
.
"He
lighted
the gas," instead of,
"He
lit
the gas."
"I have
lighted
the fire,"
instead of, "I have
lit
the
fire." The same remarks

[Pg 30]

apply to the imperfect and
participle of
light
taken as
an intransitive verb. "The
bird has
lighted
upon the
tree," instead of, "has
lit

upon the tree."
Lit
is
condemned as common.

not lĭth´o-grăph-er,
nor lī-thŏg´ra-pher.

Machiavelian
—măk-i-a-vēl´ian,
not măsh-i-a-vĕl´ian.

Mad.
In the sense of provoked,
wrathful or indignant,
angry
is generally
considered the more appropriate
word. "
Mad as a

March hare
," is an indelicate
term that should not
be used on account of its
origin.

Madame

măd´am.

Magna Charta

or mĕm´wär.

Mesdames
—mā-däm´, not
mĕz-dāmes´.

Metallurgy
—mĕt´al-lur-jy,
not me-tăl´lur-jy.

Metaphor.
The failure to
distinguish between metaphors
and similes, is a
very common mistake. In
a metaphor the resemblance
is implied without
any words to show the similarity;
as soon as the latter
are added it becomes a
simile. "Hope is an anchor,"
and "Judah is a
lion's whelp" are metaphors.
"Hope is
like
an
anchor," and "Judah is

like
a lion's whelp" are
similes.

not mĭs-chē´vŭs, nor mis-chē´ve-us.

Mischievously

and
mischievousness
are
also accented on the first
syllable.

Modulate.
This word is often
used incorrectly instead
of
moderate
in such sentences
as: "
Modulate
your
voice," when it is meant to
command or request that
the tone be
moderated
or
lowered.
Modulate
means
to vary or inflect in a musical
manner, and although
the word might often be
used with propriety in
such sentences as the above,
yet it is not always what is

meant
by the speaker. A
person's voice may be perfectly

modulated
and yet
the tone may be so high
that it is desirable, upon
certain occasions, to have
it
moderated
.

Moire
—mwôr, not mōre nor
mō´re.
Moire antique

(mwor ăn-tēk´).

Molasses.
It may seem incredible
to those who have
never heard the error I am
about to mention, that such
a ridiculous blunder could
occur. I should hardly
have believed it myself, if
I had only heard
of
it; but
I was once in a portion of
the country where all the
people for miles around
spoke of molasses as if it
were a plural noun, and I
frequently heard such remarks
as the following:
"
These
molasses are very
good;
they
are the best I
have seen for some time."
I once began to remonstrate
with one of the
champions of the plurality
of the treacle, and
insisted that he should
say, "
this
molasses" and,
"
it
is good," etc.; but it
was of no avail. He insisted
that the word was
analogous to
ashes
, and if
one was plural so was the
other. There was no good
dictionary or other reliable
authority in the neighborhood,
as might be imagined

[Pg 32]

from what has been
said, so they were left happy
in their ignorance.

a wall for an ornament is
meant. If a piece is
chopped roughly out of
anything, it is a

.
Nick

of time, not
niche
of time,
when a critical moment
is meant; but in figurative
language there is
no doubt that the phrase
"niche of time," may be
appropriately used. A
great event may be said to
stand in a
niche of time
as
an example for coming
ages.

Nomad

One of a wandering
tribe. Written
nomade

verb or a noun it is pronounced
păt´ent.

Patois
—păt-wŏ´, not păt´wŏ
nor păt-waw´.

Patriot
—pā´tri-ot, not păt´ri-ot.

Patriotic

Pedal
—pĕd´al, not pē´dal,
when that portion of a
piano or harp that is acted
upon by the feet, is meant.
Pē´dal is an adjective, and
means pertaining to the
above, or to a foot.

Perfect.
I have selected
this as the representative
of a class of adjectives that,
strictly speaking, do not
admit of comparison. I
have noticed, invariably,
that those who appear to
be so anxious to correct
the error of giving degrees
of comparison to a few
stereotyped words of this
class, such as
round
,
square
,

universal
,
chief
,
extreme
, etc.,
are singularly remiss in
calling attention to a great
many other mistakes of the
same kind that are equally
prominent. Amongst the
latter may be mentioned
the comparison of
correct
,

complete
,
even
,
level
,
straight
,
etc. It will be admitted
that if anything is
perfect

it can not be
more
so; and
as soon as it is
less
so it fails
to be
perfect
at all. So, if
anything is
correct
it is
perfectly free from error;
it can not be made
more

correct, and if its correctness
is detracted from, it
is not quite correct any
longer. A
straight
line is
one that does not vary from
a perfectly
direct
course in
the slightest degree; it can
not be
straighter
and if it
could be
less
straight, it
would be
curved
. It is ridiculous
for any one to insist
upon a national reformation
of a few such errors,
and suffer a hundred
others just like them to exist
without remonstrance.
Either
nearer
and
nearest
,

more nearly
, and
most nearly
,

[Pg 35]

and the like, should be
substituted for the degrees
of comparison and used
with all such words; or
people should treat them
as all other adjectives, just
as the best writers and
speakers have always done.
The former course is the
more desirable; the latter
is certainly the more probable.

Perfidious
—per-fĭd´i-ous,
not pĕr´fĭd-oŭs. Worcester
allows per-fĭd´yŭs in

long e.

Perspire
, not
prespire
.

Perspiration
, not
prespiration
.

Persuade.
This word carries
with it the idea of success
in one's endeavors to
convince or induce. "I

persuaded
him for a long
time, but he would not
grant my request," should
be, "I
tried
to
persuade

him," etc.

A bird. Worcester allows
the latter also.

Phaeton
—phā´et-on, not

—pi-ä´no, not pī-ăn´o.
Worcester allows pĭ-ăn´o.

Piano-forte
—pĭ-ä´no-fōr´tā,
not pī-ăn´o-fōrt. Worcester
sanctions pĭ-ä´no-fōr´te,
pĭ-ăn´o-fôr-te, and remarks
in parenthesis,
often
pe-ăn´o-fōrt;
but the last pronunciation
is evidently not
preferred.

Plat

(plăt) is a proper word,
however, having the same
meanings, but the difference
in pronunciation must
be observed, when the
spelling is as above.
Plait
,
meaning a fold of cloth, as
in a shirt bosom, is also
pronounced plāt. How
common an error it is to

[Pg 36]

speak of the
pleets
when
alluding to such folds.

Platina

not pla-tī´na nor pla-tĭn´a.

pla-tī´num, not pla-tē´num
nor pla-tĭn´um. Worcester
gives plăt´i-num only.

plē´bi-an. Ple-bŏn´, as
some pronounce it, is outrageous,
neither French,
English, nor Hottentot.

Plenary

plĕn´a-ry. Full; entire.
Worcester gives both methods.

battle."

gives săm´ist also for
the latter word.

sĭk´ĭk-al nor fĭz´ĭk-al, as it
is sometimes thoughtlessly
pronounced in reading.

, not
punkin
.
Pumpkin

itself is a corruption
of
pumpion
or
pompion
, but
is the word that is now
generally used.

—pū´ru-lent, not
pŭr´u-lent. Containing
pus or matter.
Purulence

and
purulency
have also
the long u in the first syllable.

Put
—pŏŏt, not pŭt. This anomalous
pronunciation is
hard for some to adopt,
the natural tendency being
to sound the
u
as it is in a
host of other words consisting
of two consonants
with a short u between
them, as: bun, but, cut,
dug, fun, gun, hut, nut, etc.

Pyrites

Raise
—
Rise.

Raise
is a
transitive verb, or one in
which the action passes
over to an object. Present
tense,
raise
; imperfect tense
and past participle,
raised
;
present participle,
raising
.

Rise
is an intransitive verb,
the action not passing over
to an object. Present tense,

rise
; imperfect tense,
rose
;
past participle,
risen
; present
participle,
rising
. Errors
in the use of these
words ought to be avoided
by remembering the following
rules:

1. If the person or thing
spoken of exerts an action
that passes over to an object,
use
raise
,
raised
, and

raising
.

2. If the person or thing
spoken of exerts an action
that does not pass over to
an object, use
rise
,
rose
,

risen
,
rising
. To avoid
further repetition in the
method I have adopted to
impress upon the mind the
difference between transitive
and intransitive verbs
by contrasted sentences, I
would refer the reader to
the remarks under
Lay
.
"I will
raise
in the morning
at five," should be, "I
will
rise
," etc. "I will

raise
the
window
," etc., is
correct, for the action passes
to or affects the window.
"I will
raise myself

if I have the strength" is
correct, because an object,

myself
, is furnished. "The
price of flour is
raising
,"
should be, "The price of
flour is
rising
;" but it is
right to say, "The merchants
are
raising
the price
of flour." "Gold has

raised
in value," should
be, "Gold has
risen
in
value." "The price of
bonds
raised
in less than
an hour," should be, "The
price of bonds
rose
," etc.
"The sun is
raising
,"
should be, "The sun is

rising
." "The sun is

raising
the temperature,"
is proper. The pulse has

risen
, but excitement has

raised
it. The river has

risen
in its bed and has

raised
the canal. Birds
rise

in the air.
Arise
can often
be appropriately substituted
for
rise
.

Rampant
—răm´pant, not
ram-pant´.

Rapine
—răp´ĭn, not răp´een
nor rā-peen´.

Reconnoissance

not rek-on-nois´sançe. Worcester
gives re-cŏn´noĭs-sänçe´.

Reconnaissance
is another
method of spelling.

Recriminations
, not
mutual

recriminations
; the word
itself tells of the
mutuality
.

—rĕd´o-lent, not
redō´lent. Diffusing odor
or fragrance.

Relevant
, not

rendezvouses

(rĕn´de-vōōz-ez).

gives both pronunciations.

(Fr. résumé)—rā-zū-mā´,

your
mouth," said an uneducated

after

the patient. "

have done that, but I'll

rinse
it, if you please."

also.

(Fr. roué)—rōō-ā´, not

S.

not sā-ser-dō´tal, sā-ker-dō´tal
nor săk-er-dō´tal.

Sacrament
—săk´ra-ment,
not sā´kra-ment.
Sacramental

(săk´ra-ment-al),
etc.

etc.

—săk´rist-an, not

(săk´rist-y).

—sa-läm´, not sa-lăm´.

also, and
pronounced similarly.

gives sa-līne´ only.

gives sälv also.

Samaritan
—sa-măr´i-tan,
not sa-mā´ri-tan.

to health is
meant.
Sanatory
is more
restricted in its application,
and means healing;
curative.

Saracen
—săr´a-sen, not săr´a-ken.

Sarsaparilla
—sär-sa-pa-rĭl´la,
not săs-sa-pa-rĭl´la, nor
sär-sa-fa-rĭl´la.

Satyr
—sā´tur, according to
Webster. Worcester gives
săt´ir also.

Saucy
—saw´sy, not
sassy
.

Said.

Said
(sĕd), not says
(sĕz), in speaking of past
remarks. Many of the
most cultivated people are
guilty of this vulgarism.
"'I will call to see you
soon,'
sez
he." "'I will
be glad to see you at any
time,'
sez
I." Where the
details of a long conversation
are given the frequent
repetition of
sez
, or even

said
, is very grating to the
refined ear. The use of

asked
,
inquired
,
remarked
,

suggested
,
answered
,
replied
,
etc., instead, has a pleasing
effect upon narrative
or anecdote. It is preferable,
also, to give the
exact

words
of the speaker after

said
, etc., as: "When he
had finished reading the
letter, he said: 'I will attend
to the business the
first leisure moment I
have.'" When the word

that
follows the
said
, the
substance only of the remark
may be given, as
"He said that he would
attend to the business the
first leisure moment he
had." Whichever form
is used in narrative, it is
not at all harmonious to
give the
exact words
of one
speaker and only the substance
of the remarks of
another, at least without
regard to regularity in
alternation.

Schism
—sĭzm, not skĭsm.

Seckel
, not sĭck-el. A kind
of pear.

See.
It is not uncommon
to meet with people that
incorrectly use
see
in the
imperfect tense, as: "I
see

him yesterday," instead of,
"I
saw
him yesterday."
See is never used in any
tense but the present, without

[Pg 41]

an auxiliary, as did,
shall, etc.

Seignior
—sēn´yur, not sān´yor.

Seine
—sēn, not sān. A net
for catching fish.

Senile
—sē´nīle, not sĕn´īle.
Pertaining to old age.

Separate
, not
seperate
. The
loss of the a is not noticed
in the pronunciation, but
the mistake frequently occurs
in writing this word
as it does in the words
inseparable
,

inseparableness
,

separation
, etc.

Servile
—sër´vĭl, not sër´vīle.

Set.
Noun. There are
many who incorrectly use

sett
in writing of a
set
of
dishes, a
set
of chess-men,
a
set
of teeth, or of some
other collection of things
of the same kind. A
sett

is a piece placed upon the
head of a pile for striking
upon, when the pile can
not be reached by the
weight or hammer.

Set
—
Sit.
Blunders in the
use of these words are
amongst the most common
we have.
Set
, as we shall
first consider it, is a transitive
verb, or one in which
the action passes over to an
object. Present tense,
set
;
imperfect tense and past
participle,
set
; present participle,

setting
.
Sit
is an
intransitive verb, or one
which has no object after
it. Present tense,
sit
; imperfect
tense and past participle,

sat
; present participle,

sitting
.

To avoid repetition as
much as possible, I would
refer any one to whom the
explanation here given is
not perfectly clear, to the
rules and remarks under

Lay
and
Raise
, which are
equally applicable here.
"Will you
set
on this
chair?" should be, "Will
you
sit
on this chair?"
"Will you
set
this
chair

in the other room?" is
correct. "I
set
for my
picture yesterday," should
be, "I
sat
," etc. "This
hat
sets
well," should be,
"This hat
sits
well."
"Court
sets
next month,"
should be, "Court
sits
next
month." "The hen has
been
setting
for a week,"
should be, "The hen has
been
sitting
," etc. "As
cross as a
setting
hen,"
should be, "As cross as a

sitting
hen." But a person
may
set
a hen; that is,
place her in position on
eggs. One
sits
up in a
chair, but he
sets
up a
post. One
sits
down on
the ground, but he
sets

down figures.
Set
is also
an intransitive verb and
has special meanings attached
to it as such, but
they may be readily understood

[Pg 42]

by a little study
of the dictionary, and no
confusion need arise. The
sun
sets
. Plaster of Paris

sets
. A setter dog
sets
.
One
sets
out on a journey.

Sit
may also be used in
two senses as a transitive
verb, as: "The general

sits
his horse well," and
"The woman
sat
herself
down."

Slake
—slāke, not slăk, when
the word is spelled as
given, as:

one's thirst, etc. If
spelled
slack
, the ordinary
pronunciation is right.

Slough

slō. A mudhole. Written

sloo
(slōō) also.

The cast skin of a serpent.
Dead flesh which separates

pronounced the same.

also not infrequently
heard.

is also
used.

W.

Wake
, etc.
Wake
is both a
transitive and an intransitive
verb. Present tense,

wake
; imperfect and past
participle,
waked

participle,

.
Awake

is also both transitive and
intransitive. Present,

awake
; imperfect,
awoke
or

awaked
; participles,
awaked

and
awaking
.
Awaken
is
another verb, both transitive
and intransitive. Present,

awaken
; imperfect and

[Pg 46]

past participle,

awakening
.
Thus it is seen that
we have a great many
words to express the fact
of
being
in a conscious
state, and the arousing of
a person who is asleep.
With a little attention
there is no reason for committing
an error in the
use of these words. One
may say that he
waked
,

awoke
, or
awakened
early
in the morning, but it is
wrong to say that he
woke

in the morning, or that he

woke
another; for there is
no such word as
woke
. "I

wakened
at five o'clock,"
should be, "I
awakened
at
five o'clock;" for there is
no such word as
wakened
.

Up
is used only with
wake
,

waked
and
waking
, but
even then it is one of our
most senseless superfluities.
There is no stronger
meaning in the assertion
that a man was
waked up
,
than that he was
waked
or

awakened
. If
waking up

meant to
wake
and make

get up
, it would be different,
but it does not. One
may be
waked up
and it is
just as likely that he will
go to sleep again as if
he were simply
awakened
.

Awake
and
awaken
are
more elegant words than

wake
.

—wŏs´sĭl, not wăs´sĭl.
A festive occasion,
carousal, the song sung at
such a time, etc. The verb
and the adjective are
spelled and pronounced
similarly.

Welsh
, not
Welch
. The latter
word is seldom used.

Welshman
, etc.

Whinny
, not
winny
, when the
cry of a horse is spoken of.

Whisk
, not
whist
, when
a small hand-broom is
meant.
Wisp
, however,
is a proper word, meaning
the same thing.

Whiting
is preferable to

whitening
.

It is not necessary
to say
widow woman
; no
one will suspect her of
being a man.

SCRIPTURAL, MYTHOLOGICAL AND

OTHER PROPER NAMES.

In the vocabulary just completed, it has been the
design to point out the majority of errors occurring
in the pronunciation of the words usually selected by
people of fair or excellent education to carry on ordinary
English discourse. In the portion of the
work now under consideration, nothing like such
thoroughness is contemplated.

After a moment's reflection, it will appear to any
one, that to mention the thousands upon thousands
of proper names, the erroneous pronunciation of
which is rather to be expected than the correct,
would require an elaborate volume. Every one who
has striven to become a fine orthoepist has longed
for the ability to comprehend the pronunciation of
that myriad of names, any one of which is apt to
confront him in any book or paper he may chance
to pick up. But to become a proficient in this respect
would require years of study and a knowledge
of the principles of many foreign languages.

Amongst geographical names, for example, who
but the specially instructed would think of pronouncing

[Pg 48]

correctly
Goes
(
h
ŏŏce),
Gelves

(
h
ĕl´vĕs)
or
Jalapa
(
h
ä-lä´pä); or amongst biographical
names,
Gaj
(gī),
Geel
(
h
āl) or
Geijer
(gī'er).

It is fortunate for the reputation of those who bear
the name of being good scholars, that errors in the
pronunciation of most proper names are excusable,
which is not the case with the mistakes that have
before been laid down. But there are some proper
names, of such constant occurrence in daily lectures,
reading and conversation, that errors connected with
them are not to be overlooked. It is the intention
here, simply to call attention to the more common of
these, and to lead the reader to appreciate the fact
that if one depends upon the usual power of the English
letters to gain a correct pronunciation of
proper names, he will be more often led astray than
otherwise.

The Authorities consulted are the best—Webster,
Worcester, Lippincott's Universal Pronouncing Dictionary
of Biography and Mythology and Lippincott's
Pronouncing Gazetteer of the World.

ORTHOEPICAL ERRORS OF THE PROFESSIONS.

Although errors of speech are at all times to be
deprecated, and are generally criticised without much
leniency, it must be admitted that unless they are
very gross, reasonable excuses are to be taken for
those who have never made their language a subject
of close study, and whose only use of words is entirely
impromptu in the business affairs of life, in
the home circle, or in the social gathering.

Though a person's descent from Belgravia or Billingsgate
is in a great measure revealed by the propriety
of his discourse, yet this refers principally to
those words that are employed by the masses in the
every-day conversations of life, rather than to technicalities
and words related to particular professions,
the use of which is generally confined to the specially
instructed. But when a man stands forth as an
orator, a teacher, a minister, or a professor of some
college, it is certainly not unreasonable for those
that sit under his instruction, to expect and demand
that his speech should be almost free from errors.

One occupying such a position may well be excused

[Pg 68]

for occasional embarrassment, poor voice, unpleasant
address, hesitation of delivery, and various
failings and peculiarities that can not be overcome,
but little or no allowance can be made for constantly
repeated errors.

Probably there has never been a public speaker
so perfect in diction, that he has not in moments of
embarrassment, or when much absorbed in his subject,
been guilty of grammatical inaccuracies or mistakes
of pronunciation; and doubtless he is as often
aware of them as his listeners are, as soon as they
drop from his lips, but it would be foolish to call attention
to them by going back to correct them. But
when these offenses are so glaring and so frequently
repeated that it is evident the speaker knows no better,
it is no wonder that the educated hearer often
thinks that the teacher had better leave his position
and submit to being taught.

What allowance can an intelligent congregation
make for their minister who has nothing else to do
but prepare his sermons, if, besides a multitude of
common English mistakes, he pronounces more than
half of his scriptural names in a manner that is not
sanctioned by any authority?

When the orotund medical professor stands up to
address his students, or to engage in the discussions
of a convention, and rolls out technicality after technicality
pronounced in a manner that would be disowned
by the original Latin or Greek, and is totally

[Pg 69]

at variance with established usage, who would not
ask for a little less elegance and a little more education?
If it required a great amount of labor outside
of the usual course of study for professional men to
acquire a knowledge of the pronunciation of words
peculiar to the professions, the subject might be
treated with more tolerance; but as the definitions
and the orthoepy might be so readily learned together
during those years of daily reference to books that
are required before one should be considered competent
to stand as a guide to others, it certainly seems
that they do not properly appreciate the dignity of
their position by thus laying themselves open to public
criticism.

Many a student, in order to become instructed in
certain branches, has been compelled to reluctantly
sit for months or years at the feet of those that he
felt were far inferior to him in common school education,
hearing hourly such violations of orthoepy
and syntax as would be a discredit to school children.
And, doubtless, many such students have had
such a charity for their teachers that they have
wished to direct their attention to their faults, but
have been restrained on account of the fear of enmity,
expulsion, or of lessening the chances for passing
the final examination.

The bare thought of being so criticised should be
so galling to any one bearing the dignified title of
"professor," that he ought to be stimulated to endeavor

[Pg 70]

to make himself an authority concerning the
proprieties of speech.

The study of orthoepy was held in such high esteem
by the accent Greeks, and their delicate ears
were so offended by any violation of its rules, that
if an orator mispronounced a single word, the entire
audience immediately hissed him.

During the present state of pronunciation it would
indeed be embarrassing to the public speaker, if such
a custom existed in this country. Let us imagine,
for instance, our friend Professor Abdominous Gynæcophonus,
with his face ebullient with smiles of
self-conceit, arising to address such an audience.
"Gentlemen: I have listened patiently to this op´po-nent
(
hisses
) of al´lo-path-y (
hisses
) and now arise
to make a few remarks and in´quir-ies (
hisses
). In
answer to his objections against hy-os-cy-ā´mus
(
hisses
) as an anodyne and sō´por-if-ic, (
hisses
) I
would say that in cases of cough and sleeplessness,
I have long used hyoscyamia combined in trō´chĕz
(
hisses
) without any of those effects that the păt´ron
(
hisses
) of hō´me-o-path-y (
hisses
) mentions. And
having made almost a specialty of the treatment of
făç´i-al (
hisses
) neuralgia or tic-dŏl-o-rōō´" (
hisses
)—and
it would certainly be time for him to dolorously
sit down, although he might raise the question—

"What's in a name? that which we call a rose,

By any other name would smell as sweet,"

[Pg 71]

and argue therefrom that the pronunciation of a word
should make no difference so long as its meaning was
understood. Amongst professional men, it has been
observed that physicians and dentists are by far more
prone than others to orthoepical errors. Attention
is requested to a few of the more common of these
in addition to those found in the preceding vocabulary
connected with words that are alike used by the
professional and the unprofessional, such as:
abdomen
,

acclimated
,
albumen
,
animalcula arabic
,
citrate
,

embryo
,
excrescence
,
fetid
,
fetor
,
forceps
,
homeopathy
,

hydropathy
,
jugular
,
jujube
,
nasal
,
pharmacopœia
,
purulent
,

spasmodic
,
sulphurous
,
tragacanth
, etc. The
authorities appealed to are Dunglison, Thomas, Webster
and Worcester. Notwithstanding the superior
merit of Dunglison's Medical Dictionary, as far as the
comprehensiveness and reliability of its definitions
are concerned, it is evident that it is almost useless
as an orthoepical guide. The principal accent is in
many cases marked, but the pronunciation of preceding
and succeeding syllables can not be determined,
and there is no attempt at syllabication.

Dr. Thomas' dictionary, though less comprehensive,
is equally reliable in its definitions, and is excellent
authority in regard to orthoepy; though it
is to be regretted that in some words important syllables
are not sufficiently marked. For instance,
take the words
as-bes´tos
and
bis´muth
; how can it
be determined whether the first should be pronounced

[Pg 72]

ăs-bĕs´toss or ăz-bĕs´tōz or the latter bĭz´muth
or bĭss´muth? Webster and Worcester are
undoubtedly good authorities for the pronunciation
of the medical words they give. In the following
vocabulary all of the authorities that mention the
words may be considered as agreeing, unless notice
is made of their disagreement.

[Pg 73]

MEDICAL AND DENTAL WORDS.

[In Latin and Latinized Greek words, the English sounds of the vowels
are given as those used by the majority of professional men. If any
one, however, prefers to adopt the continental method, sounding
a
as in

father
,
y
and
i
as
e
in
veto
, etc., and consistently applies it to all such
words, no one, of course, has a right to object.]

Ala
—ā´la, not ăl´a.
Alæ
,
plural.

Alis

as a termination of many

abdominalis
,

digitalis

transversalis
,
etc., is often erroneously
pronounced ăl´is.

—(al-vē´o-lar).
Alveolus
is the name given to the

cavity
in the jaw that is
seen upon the removal of
the root of a tooth, and it
possesses no more tangibility
than a pinch of air;
almost daily, however, we
hear dentists speak of extracting
a tooth with a piece
of the
alveolus
attached.
What a curiosity for preservation
in a museum is a
tooth with a piece of a little
hole fastened to the root!
What is meant is a piece
of the
alveolar process
, or
portion of bone around
the alveolus.

SENTENCES FOR PRACTICE.

The following extract is from the letter of a friend, to
whom were sent some of the advance pages of this work:
"I am absolutely filled with astonishment to see how many
simple words I have been mispronouncing all my life, and
would have kept on mispronouncing to the end of my days
if my thoughts had not been directed to them. If I were in
your place I would end the book with a story in which all
the words would be used in the course of the narrative. I
can imagine no amusement more instructive or interesting
than for a social party to read in turns, under some penalty
for each mistake."

I had myself conceived the idea of presenting the words
untrammeled with explanation of the orthoepy, or marks of
accent; but the form was not decided upon.

The effort to compose a narrative was abandoned after a
fair trial; for to have a plot and also bring the words in natural
position would require a large volume; otherwise, it
made senseless jumble. In the trial sentences given the objects
are gained in small space. Those objects are to allow
readers to exercise the memory and test their friends; and
at the same time to use the words syntactically. It is hoped
that the reader will pardon any absurdities of context; as
they can not be avoided where one is compelled to use so
many selected words, and is obliged to force them into a
small compass.

arid
desert of
Sahara
, where there is no
aroma

of sweet flowers, or anything
at all

are in constant fear of being
harassed

truculent
nomads
—then will you realize that there are no joys

comparable
to those that exist around the
hearthstone

of your humble home.

When the contents of the
museum

The attempt at a
reconnoisance
in force had been
unsuccessful; immediately after
reveille
, the commander
of the
fortress

put
it to vote amongst his officers,
whether or not they should surrender. The

carried it, although some
vehemently
opposed on
account of the excellent

of the garrison.

The
heroine
of the
melodrama
sent to her
betrothed
Seignior
an
exquisite bouquet
, composed of
catalpa

flowers,
dahlias

marigold

thyme
, and prayed his
forgiveness for not allowing him the promised
tête-à-tête

at the
trysting
place; she had been suffering with
the
tic-douloureux
, she said. He generously forgave
her and sent her a
sonnet
, in which he said that her
voice was sweeter than that of
Piccolomini
, or any
other
cantatrice
; that no
houri
could be more beautiful
than she; he called her a fair
florist
, and after

extolling
her
naïveté
,
roseate
cheeks and
nymphean

graces, he swore eternal
homage
and that he would
love her forever and for
aye
.

The judge

A

General
Silvester
and his
protégé
,

with a
casualty
that nearly cost them their lives. The
horses attached to their

At the

I have heard much of the
gamins
of
Gotham
, but
I never realized what the
gallows
-deserving rascals
were till I settled in New York City. I opened business
as a
pharmaceutist
on a corner that was a favorite

haunt
of theirs. Such a crowd of
tatterdemalions

as stood in front of my show-window the first
day I made my display of
Parisian
fancy goods, baffles
description. One had the
hooping
cough, and
every now and then would hoop till the
perspiration

rolled down his face; then he would shriek out the
daily
newspapers
, in a voice like a
calliope
. One

[Pg 83]

dirty-faced
gourmand
ate
papaws
till he had to
gape

for breath, and would shoot the seeds and throw the
skins at his
hundred
comrades, half of them coming
in my front door. Another, dressed in ragged
jean
,
his face covered with
soot
, played the
jew's-harp
hour
after hour, with as much pride in his ability as
Paganini

at his violin. Another, a tall,
jaundice
visaged
youth with an
embryo
beard of about a dozen hairs,
covered nearly to his heels with his great-grandfather's

surtout
, in the
lapel
of which was pinned a
death's-head, danced upon the iron cellar door till it
roared like distant artillery.

Then there were many other "
partners
" bearing
such
sobriquets
as "Sore Snoot," "Pig Eye," "Limpy,"
etc.,
improvising irrational
songs, boxing,

wrestling
, indulging in
raillery
and
ribald
jests,
pitching
quoits
,
meawing
like cats, howling at my

patrons
and driving reputable
patronage
away. Every
now and then they would send in little,
saucy
,
precocious

urchins, who offered to
patronize
me by asking
for two cents' worth of
jujube
paste,
tolu
or
licorice
,
or some
Samaritan

salve
for Jim Biles' sore nose.
At last, when the sun had reached the
horizon
, as a

finale
of the day's
progress
, one of the young villains
hurled a bowlder through my French plate-glass,
which, after its flight through a lot of
citrate
of magnesia,

cochineal
and
quinine
, finally spilled a large
bottle of red ink all over my new
pharmacopœia
.
Springing over the
débris
, I rushed to the door with

[Pg 84]

implacable
anger flashing from my eyes. But one
glance at that
imperturbable
crowd showed me how

impotent
I was. One of them with
placid
countenance
and
stolid
indifference simply accosted me with,
"Say, Mister, are you going to see the '
Naiad

Queen' to-night?"

I left that store in less than a
fortnight
.

The
comptroller
was appointed by the
government

upon the supposition that he was
conversant

details of
finance

finances
,
until the conscience-stricken
defalcating
officer acknowledged
his
defalcation

The emigrants to the
frontier
chose a beautiful
spot for their settlement; but they found that the
wells dug there and on the

From the

Young
Philemon
after reading
Lalla Rookh

More

excellence and sense can be

than in any of the
products
of his brain that he has
given us. His brothers,
Eben
and
Philander
, have
become stage-struck, and expect to excel in the
Protean

art. Their
guardian
, himself a great lover of

drama
, having foolish confidence in their success,
grants them
plenary
indulgence in all their whims.
They are
habitués
of the
theatre
, and have fitted up
a
suite
of apartments next to a
suit
of rooms occupied
by some stock actors, with whom they are bound
in
indissoluble
bonds of friendship. There they
spend the day in practice, and if you should call at
any hour, there is no telling what will present itself
to you. Perhaps Macbeth with the
glamour
of his
eyes, viewing the imaginary
gouts
of blood; or
Banquo

with his gory locks; or some knight with his

cuirass
on and his
visor
down, plunging, without a

qualm
, his carmine-stained
poniard
into the
jugular

of some
patriot
. Possibly, Othello the
Moor
, King
John with the
Magna Charta
, or a
legendary
warrior
of frightful
mien
with his
falchion
drawn, will admit

[Pg 86]

you. Or you may see a
viscount
with
falcon

rampant

villain, a
jocund
host, or an
irate
,
splenetic
old
man with
spectacles
, pronouncing with
senile vehemence

a curse upon some
fragile
female in
negligee

before him, who beseeches the aid of an
immobile
statue
in a
niche
in the wall. You may get there in
the nick of time to save Desdemona by an
exposé
of

Iago
'so villainy, to rescue Pythias whom Damon holds
by the
nape
of the neck on the
threshold
of eternity,
or to restrain the
suicidal
design of the
Montague

informing him that the fair Capulet is only under the
influence of a
soporific
—not dead. You may arrive
soon enough to arouse the womanhood in the
docile

Kate, making her less

Petruchio

And you will find the guardian of these promising

The
ennui
, recently complained of, was relieved by
an invitation to a party given by the
Mesdames
B.,
the same you met at the
conversazione
of the church

guild
. The ladies received their guests with their
usual
suavity
. Their niece,
Rosamond
, recently from

Madrid
, was the attraction of the evening; she wore
an elegant
moire
antique with a profusion of
valenciennes
;
she had a beautiful set of jewelry—
opal

and diamonds. It was marvelous how her
tiny
hands
flew over the
piano-forte
. She sings very sweetly

[Pg 87]

too; her voice is a sort of
mezzo-soprano
. The

naïve
Miss
Ursula
was present, nearly smothered in
black silk and
guipure
. She looks much prettier in

dishabille
. The little
piquant
Miss
Irene
, with her

plaited
hair, sang with a voice like a
paroquet
her
favorite, "
Tassels
on the Boots." That disgusting
young
Leopold
was there, feeling as important as a

Rothschild
, making his
salams
, and
palavering sotto
voce
to all the girls, circulating his
monogram
cards
and sporting his paste pin with its dazzling
facets
.
He thinks he cuts a wide
swath

Late in the evening those that were fond of
Terpsichorean

amusement were ushered into a room where
the
tapestry
was covered and there spent several hours
in
minuets
, waltzes, quadrilles, etc.

The topics of conversation amongst the more sensible
during the evening were the object of the visit
of the new
prelate
, and the recent speeches of
Disraeli

and
Thiers
.

Madame B. caused a good deal of merriment by
describing an improvement in her
cuisine
that had
been introduced that day. Bridget, a late importation
from
Belfast
, who had charge of the
culinary

department, was told to send for some
vermicelli
to
put in the soup, but she ordered
spermaceti
instead.

There was an old superstition that when the
sacristan

caused the bell in the
cupola
to toll its
dolorous

funeral notes, the
manes
of former friends joined

, and gathering around the grave
moved their lips in inaudible
requiem
, and wrote in
invisible letters upon the tomb,

Suffice
it to say that the dentist gave the patient

Lethe

a draught from which caused forgetfulness.

It is reported in the
Pall Mall
Gazette that
Basil

S., whom you met several years ago at
Leipsic
, is
dead. He lived the life of a
roué
for some years in
Paris and London, and turned out to be a most
perfidious

villain. In the latter city he committed

[Pg 89]

many
heinous
offenses and acts of
subtle
knavery that
were almost without
precedent
. He was engaged for
a long time in the manufacture of
spurious
money by
a new
process
, in which dies were taken from
gutta-percha

impressions. He had purchased the services
of an experienced professor of
metallurgy
, and the

produce
of their crime would have been immense, if
some of his other crimes had not been betrayed.

Placards
, offering a large reward for his arrest, were
posted all over the city. He fled to Venice where
he was soon afterward drowned by falling from a

gondola
, thus cheating the
gibbet
of its dues.

The foolish lover,
Ivan

Some fishermen rescued him with their
seine
, poured

guerdon
for his faithfulness.

The
Saracens
, taking advantage of the
strategic

point, made a sudden dash into the territory of the

usurper
; while a detachment
houghed
the horses of

predatory

raid characterized by
rapine
and terror, and after
the
spoliation
of the villages, and the burning of
the
granaries
, returned to their own possessions.

Lionel
,

wealth and position and become a

hovel
on the
heather
, whitened with lime which he
himself
slaked

redolent

of spring, present a strange contrast with his former
mansion and magnificent grounds.

Eva

servile

work. He is confident that his
genealogy
, if known,
would show that he was unto a
manor
born, and that
some
supposititious
child robbed him of his rights.

VIOLATED RULES OF GRAMMAR.

Many, who claim to be good grammarians, are occasionally
guilty of the violation of certain important
rules. Attention is solicited to a few of the
more common errors of this nature.

NUMBER.

Certain compounds change the form of the first
word in pluralizing, as:
court-martial
,
brother-in-law
,

sister-in-law
. Plural,
courts-martial
,
brothers-in-law
,
etc. "John has three brother-in-laws," then, is incorrect.

But
tea-spoonful
,
table-spoonful
,
cupful
,
pocketful
,
etc., are not considered such compounds; therefore,
"two tea-spoonsful of medicine" and "two-cupsful of
flour," should be, "two tea-spoonfuls of medicine,"
and "two cupfuls of flour."

[Pg 94]

When name and title are given, with a numeral
adjective prefixed, the
name
is pluralized. "Are the
two Misses Wilson at home?" should be, "Are the
two Miss Wilsons at home?" But when the numeral
is omitted the
title
must be pluralized. "Were
the Dr. Browns there?" should be, "Were the Drs.
Brown there?" The rule has been given that the

name
only of married ladies is pluralized, but
there appears to be no reason except that of euphony:
the
Mrs. Clarks
certainly sounds more agreeably
than the
Mistresses Clark
. In giving the plural
of such titles as:
Hon.
,
Rev.
,
Squire
and
Capt.
,
euphony is also often considered; but in such cases
it would doubtless be better to add the numeral, as:
the
three Hon. Jacksons
.

EACH OTHER—ONE ANOTHER.

Each other
applies to two;
one another
to more
than two. "The three witnesses contradicted each
other," and "the two men accused one another," are
incorrect.

NEITHER, NOT—NOR.

Neither
and
not
are followed by
nor
, not
or
.
"Neither James or Charles will come," and "it is
not white or black," are incorrect.

TO BE, UNITING WORDS.

Words united by
to be
, referring to the same person,
must be of the same case.

"It is me," "It may have been him," "It could

[Pg 95]

not be her," and "It was not them," are not correct:

it
, in each of the sentences, is
nominative
and the
other pronouns should be
I
,
he
,
she
and
they
. "I
took it to be he," and "I understood it to be they,"
are also wrong; for
it
is objective in both instances,
and the following pronouns should be
him
and
them
.

THAN, AS.

Than
and
as
implying comparison, have the same
case after as before. "He loses more than me,"
"John knows more than him" and "James is not so
tall as her," should be, "He loses more than I"
(lose), "John knows more than he" (knows) and
"James is not so tall as she" (is tall).

WHO.

Errors connected with the use of this word are
very common, even amongst good speakers.

"Who did you see?" "Who do you know?" and
"Who did you hear?" are wrong:
whom
should be
used, for it is the object of the transitive verbs,
see
,

know
and
hear
.
Who
in such sentences as: "Who
are you looking at?" and "Who are you writing
to?" should likewise be changed into
whom
, for it is
the
object
of the prepositions
at
and
to
.

ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS.

Adjectives are often erroneously used for adverbs
in sentences like the following: "This is an uncommon
good portrait," "It is a miserable poor painting.

[Pg 96]

"
Uncommonly good
and
miserably poor
are
right.

Adverbs are still more commonly used for adjectives.
"Mary looked
beautifully
at the party," and
"Janauschek looked
majestically
on the stage," are
incorrect, for it is intended to describe the appearance
of Mary and Janauschek, not their manner of
looking; therefore the adjectives
beautiful
and
majestic

should be used.

When
two
objects are compared, the
comparative

degree should be used. "William is the heaviest of
the two," and "Which is the most desirable—health
or wealth?" ought to be, "William is the heavier
of the two," and "Which is the more desirable—health
or wealth?"

THESE, THOSE.

The plural demonstratives
these
and
those
are often
erroneously used with singular nouns, as: "I don't
like these kind of people," and "Those sort of
things are very embarrassing."
Kind
and
sort
are
singular and should have
this
and
that
.

INTO.

Into
, not
in

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

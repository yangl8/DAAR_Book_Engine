PREFACE

During the past ten years the writer has been trying
to find some consistent and satisfactory working
plan for handling the almost bewildering number of
facts, of ecological significance, which have been accumulating
in the literature of zoÃ¶logy, biology, and
the allied sciences. This book is the outgrowth of
the effort as it has developed in the study and teaching
of animal ecology. I have not attempted to
make this an exhaustive treatment of the subject,
but rather to indicate briefly some of its general
bearings and a method of approach. I have tried
to keep in mind the needs of the beginner in ecology.

An ecological point of view is described more fully
than the other subjects discussed, so that the student
may see the need of familiarity with those tests
or criteria by means of which he may be able to
determine for himself ecological relations and the
validity of ecological studies. The other phases are
treated less fully in the discussions and with more
detail bibliographically so that this may be a useful
source book. The geographical (in the ordinary
sense of the word) aspect has been deliberately
omitted. The references should be looked upon
from the standpoint presented in the general portions
of this book, and if the facts and inferences
aid in the interpretation of the relations which exist
[Pg vi]

between animals and the sum total of their environments,
one may fairly consider that they are of
ecological worth.

In the arrangement of the references I have tried
to group related papers, but many defy any single
system. Some of the publications deserve to be in
several lists, but little duplication has been made,
as this would unduly prolong the lists. The annotations
will supplement the titles and their grouping
in indicating the contents and importance of the
papers for our purpose. It has often been difficult
to select from several almost equally valuable and
useful papers. Others with different interests, aims,
and experience would doubtless make a different
choice. It will therefore be a favor, if those who
use this handbook and feel that important papers
have been excluded, will communicate this fact to
the author.

This book is not intended as a treatise on the science
of ecology; its aim is primarily educational.
This is the justification, if any were necessary, for
placing emphasis upon the point of view and the
importance of an understanding of explanatory processes
and of the methods of scientific investigation.
Any adequate treatment of this subject would exceed
the space of this volume and it is reserved for
future elaboration.

At present ecology is a science with its facts out
of all proportion to their organization or integration.
There is thus an immediate need of integration, and
this above all requires a clear conception of the scientific
[Pg vii]

method as a tool, and independent thinking
as well. The fact that scientific work progresses
more rapidly when consciously pursued than otherwise
should serve as ample justification for this
emphasis.

A word of explanation is desirable to explain certain
features of this volume. It is the outcome of
coÃ¶perative work on the part of the Illinois State
Laboratory of Natural History and certain members
of the Ecological Survey Committee of the Illinois
Academy of Science, Professors E. N. Transeau and
T. L. Hankinson. A local ecological study was
made, as a piece of coÃ¶perative work, and directions
for study were to be an introductory section of my
part of this report. But as this part grew on my
hands, with the permission of Professor S. A. Forbes,
Director of the Illinois State Laboratory of Natural
History, I decided to publish it separately. This
part was written two years and a half ago, and when
separate publication was decided upon, additional
references to the literature were added to bring it
to date. These circumstances explain the emphasis
placed upon ecological surveying and also the brevity
of treatment of other aspects.

Further, I am indebted to Professor Forbes for
reading the manuscript and for valuable criticisms,
and likewise, for similar assistance, to my wife, Alice
Norton Adams. Skillful help on the proof and index
has been given by Miss Marion E. Sparks.

RELATION OF ECOLOGY TO BIOLOGY

âI shall try to show that life is response to the
order of nature.... But if it be admitted, it follows
that biology is the study of response, and that
the study of that order of nature to which response
is made is as well within its province as the study
of the living organism which responds, for all the
knowledge we can get of both these aspects of nature
is needed as a preparation for the study of that
relation between them which constitutes life.â

âTo study life we must consider three things:

first
, the orderly sequence of external nature;

second
, the living organism and the changes
which take place in it; and,

third
, that continuous adjustment between the
two sets of phenomena which constitutes life.â

âThe physical sciences deal with the external
world, and in the laboratory we study the structure
and activities of organisms by very similar methods;
but if we stop there, neglecting the relation of the
living being to its environment, our study is not
biology or the science of life.â

W. K. BROOKS.

[Pg 1]

ANIMAL ECOLOGY

I. AIM, CONTENT, AND POINT OF VIEW

Ecology has no aim, but ecologists have. The
problems of the ecologist are not fundamentally
different from those of any other kind of naturalist.
The superficial differences in aim are due to the
different points of view, or methods of approach,
rather than to any essential difference in the character
of the problems.

The essentially biological core of ecology may be
best shown by considering the relation which this
science bears to other branches of biology, a relation
which has been admirably expressed by the eminent
physiologist, Burdon-Sanderson (â94, pp. 438-439),
as follows:

âNow the first thing that strikes us in beginning
to think about the activities of an organism is that
they are naturally distinguishable into two kinds,
according as we consider the action of the whole
organism in its relation to the external world or to
other organisms, or the action of the parts or organs
in their relation to each other. The distinction to
which we are thus led between the
internal
and

external
relation of plants and animals has of course
always existed, but has only lately come into such
[Pg 2]

prominence that it divides biologists more or less
completely into two campsâon the one hand those
who make it their aim to investigate the actions of the
organism and its parts by the accepted methods of
physics and chemistry, carrying this investigation as
far as the conditions under which each process manifests
itself will permit; on the other, those who interest
themselves rather in considering the place which
each organism occupies, and the part which it plays
in the economy of nature. It is apparent that the
two lines of inquiry, although they equally relate
to what the organism
does
, rather than to what it
is, and therefore both have equal right to be included
in the one great science of life, or biology, yet lead
in directions which are scarcely even parallel. So
marked, indeed, is the distinction, that Professor
Haeckel some twenty years ago proposed to separate
the study of organisms with reference to their place
in nature under the designation of âÅcology,â defining
it as comprising âthe relations of the animal to its
organic as well as to its inorganic environment,
particularly its friendly or hostile relations to those
animals or plants with which it comes into direct
contact.â
[1]
Whether this term expresses it or not,
the distinction is a fundamental one. Whether with
the Åcologist we regard the organism in relation to
the world, or with the physiologist as a wonderful
[Pg 3]

complex of vital energies, the two branches have this
in common, that both studies fix their attention,
not on stuffed animals, butterflies in cases, or even
microscopical sections of the animal or plant bodyâall
of which relate to the framework of lifeâbut on
life itself.â

[1]
These he identifies with âthose complicated mutual relations which
Darwin designates as conditions of the struggle for existence.â Along
with chorologyâthe distribution of animalsâÅcology constitutes what
he calls
Relations-physiologie
. Haeckel, âEntwickelungsgang u. Aufgaben
der Zoologie,â Jenaische Zeitschr., 1869, Vol. V, p. 353.

The quotations from Brooks, on a preceding page,
show even more explicitly the intimate relation which
exists between biology and ecology. At first glance
they may seem to prove almost too muchâthat
biology and ecology are synonymous. They show at
least that ecology is concerned with fundamental
biological problemsâthe responses of organisms
to their complete environments.

The relations which different branches of ecology
bear to one another may be discussed under three
headings, individual, aggregate, and associational
ecology. These phases are superficially so distinct
that students of one branch may be almost unaware
of the existence of the coÃ¶rdinate branches and may
not realize that each is a part of the larger unit.

Individual Ecology.
âThe study of individual
ecology is the investigation of the development
(
process
of formation) of the structure, function,
and behavior of a given individual or kind of animal
from the standpoint of its relations and responses
to the complete environment. All ecologically significant
facts should be considered. Such a study
may be devoted to an animal, as, for example, a
bumblebee, a crawfish, or a garter snake, and may
be limited to a single habitat or locality, or extended
[Pg 4]

throughout the entire geographic range of an animal.
From this standpoint the individual studied becomes
the hub of the microcosm, from which all relations
and responses radiate. Most of the physiological
studies of ecological bearing and many investigations
of animal behavior have been made from this viewpoint.
The organism is thus considered as an agent
which, transforming and utilizing substance and
energy, produces a varied number of physiological
conditions and forms of activity, which in turn furnish
the basis for the constant process of response between
the organism and its environment.

Aggregate Ecology.
âThe study of aggregate ecology
is the investigation of the ecological development,
relations, and responses of animals based upon
hereditary or taxonomic units, as in a family community,
or in genera, families, orders, etc. These
groups or aggregates are made the basis for the
ecologic study, as a hive of bees, birds, dragon flies
(Odonata), the genus
Bombus
. From this approach
the activities and responses of the group are traced
throughout all environments and associations within
the area studied, or throughout the world, and its
responses and adjustments to the whole environment
receive primary attention. The hereditary or taxonomic
unit is here the hub of the microcosm. Perhaps
most of the contributions to ecology by the taxonomists
are made from this standpoint. Here also
the aggregate is considered as an agent or entity
which produces many kinds of activities and adjustments
to the environment.

[Pg 5]

Associational Ecology.
âAssociational ecology is
devoted to the investigation of the development,
interrelations, and responses of animals which are
grouped or associated in the same habitats and
environments. In this case the associates in a
given association and habitat are considered as a
unit, whose activities and interrelations and responses
are investigated in the same manner as if
it were a single animal. The interactions among
members of an association are to be compared to
the similar relations existing between the different
cells, organs, or activities of a single individual.
Such groupings have a composition which has
developed into an arrangement, or âspacing,â
of individuals within it, and which produces a particular
plan or pattern, as a result of the innumerable
responsive activities on the part of the individuals
which live together. For example, when the animals
living in a small brook, the littoral zone of a lake,
in a colony of breeding gulls, or on the floor of a
forest, are treated as a unit, the entire history of the
animals in the habitat is considered as a response to
the conditions of life.

In this form of study the association becomes
the center of all radiating relations and responses.
Such an association is an agent which transforms
substance and energy, producing varied physiological
conditions and responses in the continuous process
of adjustment âwhich constitutes life.â The
physiological needs and states of an association
have as real existence in individual animals as have
[Pg 6]

similar needs in the cell or cells which compose
the animal body. The mere statement of the facts
of such relations is enough to make valid such a
comparison.

For the associational aspect of ecology the German
naturalist, MÃ¶bius, proposed in 1877 the term âbiocÅnosis.â
The meaning of this he expressed very
clearly and concisely, and on account of its relatively
obscure publication, in a paper devoted to oyster
culture, it has not gained the circulation among
zoÃ¶logists which its importance merits. His statement
(MÃ¶bius, â83, p. 723) is as follows:

âEvery oyster-bed is thus, to a certain degree, a
community of living beings, a collection of species,
and a massing of individuals, which find here everything
necessary for their growth and continuance,
such as suitable soil, sufficient food, the requisite
percentage of salt, and a temperature favorable to
their development. Each species which lives here
is represented by the greatest number of individuals
which can grow to maturity subject to the conditions
which surround them, for among all species the
number of individuals which arrive at maturity
at each breeding period is much smaller than the
number of germs produced at that time. The total
number of mature individuals of all the species living
together in any region is the sum of the survivors of
all the germs which have been produced at all past
breeding or brood periods; and this sum of matured
germs represents a certain quantum of life which
enters into a certain number of individuals, and which,
[Pg 7]

as does all life, gains permanence by means of transmission.
Science possesses, as yet, no word by
which such a community of living beings may be designated;
no word for a community where the sum
of species and individuals, beings mutually limited
and selected under the average external conditions
of life, have, by means of transmission, continued
in possession of a certain definite territory. I
propose the word
BiocÃ¦nosis
[2]
for such a community.
Any change in any of the relative factors of a biocÃ¶nose
produces changes in other factors of the same.
If, at any time, one of the external conditions of life
should deviate for a long time from its ordinary
mean, the entire biocÃ¶nose, or community, would be
transformed. It would also be transformed, if the
number of individuals of a particular species increased
or diminished through the instrumentality of man, or
if one species entirely disappeared from, or a new species
entered into, the community.â (See Figure 1).

The three methods of approach to ecological
study are not so distinct as they appear at first
thought. With perfecting knowledge the network of
interrelations increases and the paths converge. Then
also the study of the individual behavior of âsocialâ
animals, as ants, white ants, bees, or birds which
live and breed in colonies, shows transitional stages
from the individual unit to that of the family, the
colony, and on to the association. Yet the advantage
of each point of view should be recognized as an aid
in the analysis and synthesis of any problem.

[Pg 8]

Some students feel that the study of individual
ecology should precede that of the associational.
Within certain limits this is true, but if our general
knowledge of biology had waited for the perfection
of our knowledge of the individual cells of animals,
the results would have been disastrous to all concerned.
Even now our knowledge of these subjects
is very incomplete. For similar reasons there
should be no delay in studying animal aggregates
and associations.

A combination of ecological and taxonomic study
generally appeals most strongly to those students
who have made a specialty of some group of animals.
They are familiar with certain forms, have some
confidence in taxonomic methods, and frequently
have given some attention to habits, life histories,
and to collecting. To those who like the descriptive
aspect of taxonomy, ecological studies also offer a
new field for further description and classification.
At present perhaps the majority of ecological students
have entered the subject through taxonomy. It is
the almost universal verdict of such students that it
has required much effort on their part to make the
change in the point of view. Such a change cannot
be made by a simple resolve, but requires a modification
of the habits of the mind, which will be attended
by a distinct consciousness of effort. As in other
habits, reversion to the older attitude of mind is very
easy. This change in point of view is a problem in
habit formation, a study of the mental behavior of
the ecologist, which is in reality the main topic
[Pg 9]

thus far discussed. One may attempt to make
such a change and find that he does not have sufficient
modifiability to make it permanent, so that it is
only for the moment, during actual collision with
some stubborn fact, that he is able to realize ecological
relations and an ecological point of view.

To the physiologist, however, individual ecology
tends to appeal most strongly, and he, perhaps on
account of the preponderance of analytical methods
in his work, feels that this is the safest and most
important aspect. This statement is perhaps also
true of most students of animal behavior. This
is largely due to the great present need of analytical
methods in these lines, and perhaps indicates a stage
in the development of their science rather than a
permanent condition. Later a synthetic development
will probably become more prominent, and
with it will come a change in estimating relative
values. Generally physiologists allow for a greater
influence of the environment than do many other
students. They are impressed with the dependence
of organisms upon their environment, and the study
of their reactions only reinforces this conception.

The ecologist who studies the responses of animals
cannot help being impressed with the processes of
adjustment, and with adaptation as a
process
. It
is adaptation as a process, rather than as a product,
which perhaps interests him most, and emphasis
needs to be placed upon this distinction. The
problem of adaptation as a process may be a different
and separate one from that of evolution, but individual
[Pg 10]

animals must have shown adjustive adaptation,
or there could have been no perpetuation to
continue the struggle of adjustment. Ecological
problems are likely to raise a question as to the relative
importance of adaptation and evolutionâif
they are separate problems. The present generation
has perhaps been more deeply impressed by evolution
as a process, than by adaptation as a process.

The ecology of living animals is only the latest
chapter in the volume on this subject; the preceding
chapters will contain a history of the indefinitely
long series of ecological responses which have taken
place in the geologic past. Here is where the ecologist
and paleontologist and geologist find common
ground. The ecology of living animals must furnish
us with whatever firm basis we have for the interpretation
of the conditions of life in the past, upon
which the paleontologist, stratigrapher, or paleogeographer
must depend, at least in part, for his
interpretations.

With still another training and interest, as in the
case of those especially interested in human affairs,
such as the sociologist, the physician, the sanitary
expert, and the agriculturist, we may ultimately
expect a greater appreciation for the associational
aspect because of the social or associational character
of human society. The associational is the phase
of animal activity which may be considered as the
form of animal behavior which has developed into
the human social relations. It is a response to the
complete organic and inorganic environment.

[Pg 11]

It is rather natural that in a relatively newly
recognized subject like ecology this human aspect
has not been very fully discussed. For practical
reasons the ecology of man has been developed
largely independent of that of animals; just as human
physiology and psychology have been developed
relatively independent of comparative or general
physiological psychology. To the mutual advantage
of these subjects they are now rapidly converging,
and we may anticipate a similar relation between
general animal ecology and the ecology of man. In
a general treatise on animal ecology the human
phase should not receive undue emphasis any more
than it should in a general physiology of animals
or in a comparative psychology. But, nevertheless,
the relationships of man and his animal associates
(slaves, domestic animals, rats, mice, parasites, etc.)
form as truly an animal association as do those of
the animals which live associated in some forest
glade; and in all probability, before any approximately
complete understanding can be had of the
human associations, their roots and principles of
activity must be known and understood in the less
aristocratic portion of his animal relatives.

The recognition of the associational aspect of
ecology, as well as that human ecology is a part of
general animal ecology, is of recent origin. This is
very well shown in the following quotation from
Huxley (1854. On the Educational Value of the
Natural History Sciences):

âBiology deals only with living beings as isolated
[Pg 12]

thingsâtreats only of the life of the individual:
but there is a higher division of science still, which
considers living beings as aggregatesâwhich deals
with the relation of living beings one to anotherâthe
science which
observes
menâwhose
experiments

are made by nations one upon another, in battlefieldsâwhose

general propositions
are embodied in history,
morality, and religionâwhose
deductions
lead to
our happiness or our miseryâand whose
verifications

so often come too late, and serve only

âTo point a moral, or adorn a taleââ

I mean the science of Society or
Sociology
.â

At a later date (1876. On the Study of Biology)
Huxley says: âFor whatever view we may entertain
about the nature of man, one thing is perfectly
certain, that he is a living creature. Hence, if
our definition is to be interpreted strictly, we must
include man and all his ways and works under the
head of Biology; in which case, we should find that
psychology, politics, and political economy would
be absorbed into the province of Biology. In
strict logic no one can object to this course.... The
real fact is that we biologists are a self-sacrificing
people ... [so that] we feel that we have more than
sufficient territory.... But I should like you to recollect
that that is a sacrifice, and that you should not
be surprised if it occasionally happens that you
see a biologist apparently trespassing in the region
of philosophy or politics; or meddling with human
education; because, after all, that is a part of his
kingdom which he has only voluntarily forsaken.â

[Pg 13]

Whether sociology is regarded as a response of
man to his fellows or to the whole of his environment
is inconsequential in its bearing upon whether or not
it is ecological. The response of man, as an animal,
to a part or the whole of his environment is strictly
ecological. Huxley recognized one relation very
clearly, and that is that the ecological relations of

individuals
do not currently include the higher synthesis
which deals with them as associations, or
âaggregatesâ as he terms them. So far as known to
the writer, human activities in general have never
been fully and comprehensively oriented from the
ecological standpoint, even by the humanitarians
themselves, although some important preliminary
steps have been taken. It looks as if such a viewpoint
might give a new unity to all studies of human
relations.

There is still another class of persons, particularly
teachers and isolated students, who desire first of
all to understand and interpret their own vicinity,
and who will inquire which of the three plans their
work best fits. If such a one begins with the detailed
study of each species, the general survey will not be
completed during his lifetime. If he uses the larger
taxonomic units, he may survey the field by going
over the same ground again and again, with each of
the different groups successively in mind, until the
entire field has been surveyed. Or, lastly, he may
divide the area into associations and study the animals
which are found living together, and by studying one
association after another he may cover the entire field.
[Pg 14]

A teacher will find certain important advantages in
this plan, and certain disadvantages. One of the most
important considerations in its favor is that such a
study results in a familiarity with the kinds of animals
one actually finds in natural groups, as when his
class is on an excursion. The natural history which
a farmer, a fisherman, a summer vacationist, or a
sportsman acquires is grouped in this same manner.
Thus to a large number of people this is the natural
method of approach, and is generally of most permanent
value, except possibly to some professional
teachers or zoÃ¶logists. One of its greatest disadvantages
is that in most of the literature which one must
use, the animals are not grouped in this way, but
taxinomically.

The individual, aggregate, and associational
methods of study are in themselves subject to diverse
angles of approach, and each has its particular advantages
and disadvantages. Of the methods of
approach mention will be made of three only, the
descriptive, the comparative, and the genetic or
method of processes. The descriptive method must
develop to some degree before the genetic problems
can be adequately stated, and the mature development
of the genetic may, and generally does, lag
far behind that of the descriptive. The reason
for this is simple, for it is evident that it is much easier
to describe what we see than it is to explain how it
originated or its process of development. At present
biology as a science is mainly in the descriptive stage,
though it is slowly but surely becoming explanatory
[Pg 15]

and genetic. The developmental or explanatory
method is so difficult that every possible expedientâobservation,
comparison, reflection, experiment, etc.âmust
be used to secure the proper development
of the main phases of ecology. There is a marked
tendency in the naturalist to master one system of
work, as observation or experiment, and to use it as
a tool almost exclusively, turning from one phase
of the subject to another, and continuing the use
of the same method. This way of working is favorable
to a good technique, but its weakness is that it
often tends to give its user a feeling of the great
superiority and reliability of the result reached by
his method, and a correspondingly less appreciative
recognition of results secured by other methods.
To observe, to experiment, to reflect, to dissect,
to stain, and to collect are only partial methods of
investigation, and this fact should be realized and
be kept in mind when estimating values and planning
work.

The aim of the ecologist is professedly genetic
or explanatory because it is the study of
responses
to
all conditions of the complete environment. But
these responses must be described, and the conditions
influencing them as well, so that a descriptive aspect
is an essential part in all phases of ecology. In the
study of the responses of an individual, an order,
or an association, pure description of the responses is
necessary; but a description which will at once
describe and show the working of the processes by
which the results were produced, is of quite a different
[Pg 16]

order. This phase of explanation has been most
concisely expressed and applied by the students of
the physical sciences, and biologists may profit
much from a study of their methods.

When, however, we turn to the viewpoint of the
development of the science of ecology as a whole,
a symmetrical development of the subject is most
desirable. The preponderating influence of any
special point of view tends, like dominance in
general, to smother or suppress other germinating
and competing ideas. The different special interests
each have their advantages and disadvantages,
as does a general interest. Diversity in students
leads to diversity in the development of the subject,
and a variety of emotional appeals to the student
has its advantages. And just as the special student
should devote some attention to the general bearing
of his work, so also should the student of the general
aspects cultivate some special field of interest.

The preceding discussion of the aims and methods
in ecological study has been intended to indicate
some of its general bearings, and to give the student
some idea of the tests or criteria which may be used
to aid in steering his course through the maze of
observations which he may make and the opinions
which he encounters. It is of equal importance
for the student to be able to perceive ecological
relations as recorded by others, because one personâs
experience is so limited compared with the general
body of recorded fact and inference. Furthermore,
there are also so many degrees and kinds of
[Pg 17]

work that go by the name ecological, which may or
may not be, and so many also which are truly ecological
but which do not pass under that name, that it is
necessary that the student shall be able to see through
its diverse guises and recognize its essential character.
Whenever the question arises as to the ecological
character of a fact, inference, or conclusion, its
ecological validity may be tested in the following
way:

Do the facts, inferences, or conclusions show a

response
to the inorganic or organic environment:

1. As an individual of a species or kind of animal?

2. As a group of taxonomically related animals?

3. As an association of interacting animals?

Not seen by writer. Dr. W. M. Wheeler, of Harvard
University, has kindly sent me the following note
from p. 285. ââIt is to ethology therefore that the
fourth part of this work is devoted, to which belongs
the study of the relations of organisms within the
family and the society in the aggregate and in the
community.â In a volume of the same work, page
xx, St. Hilaire gives his program and speaks of the
general facts belonging to ethological laws. These are
defined as ârelating to the instincts, habits and more
generally to the external vital manifestations of organisms.ââ
About the preceding Dr. Wheeler remarks:
âYou see this covers precisely the field which
was a few years later called âecologyâ by Haeckel.
Apparently the part of the work in which St. Hilaire
wished to give a detailed account of the ethological
phenomena of animals was not published. Only
three volumes of the work exist. He died November
10, 1861, without having completed the work.â

Thus ethology has priority over ecology, but to my
mind this fact carries no special weight, particularly
since the word has become current in botany. To
use a different name for the same subject or process
in botany and zoÃ¶logy is as undesirable as to use a
different term for heredity in plants and in animals.

Lankester, E. R.

1889. Article âZoÃ¶logy.â Ency. Britannica, 9th ed. Amer.
Reprint. Vol. XXIV, pp. 842, 856.

Lankester defines âBionomics.âThe lore of the farmer,
gardener, sportsman, fancier, and field naturalist,
including thremmatology, or the science of breeding,
and the allied teleology, or science of organic adaptations:
exemplified by the patriarch Jacob, the poet
Vergil, Sprengel, Kirby and Spence, Wallace, and
[Pg 20]

Darwin.... Buffon (1707-1788) alone among the
greater writers of the three past centuries emphasized
that view of living things which we call âbionomics.â
Buffon deliberately opposed himself to the
mere exposition of the structural resemblances and
differences of animals, and, disregarding classification,
devoted his treatise on natural history to a
consideration of the habits of animals and their
adaptations to their surroundings, whilst a special
volume was devoted by him to the subject of reproduction....
Buffon is the only prominent writer
who can be accorded historic rank in this study.â

As I have access to but few of Buffonâs writings, I
quote the above. Bionomics is seen not to be synonymous
with ecology, as defined by most students,
although it includes much that is ecological. The
chaotic and unorganized âlore of the farmerâ has
no unifying or guiding principles, and although it
contains many facts, from which a science may be
built, to call it science seems undesirable.

It is of course advantageous in some ways to have
agreement as to the limitations of ecology, or any
science, but even the more exact sciences seem to fare
little better, as is shown by the following statement:
âIt is not long since I heard a university professor
begin a lecture on physics somewhat in this way:
âPhysics is the science of matter and energy. This
field is so large that it is customary at present to
break off the physics of the molecule and its reactions
and call it chemistry. Also to put to one side the
physics of the heavenly bodies and call this a part
of astronomy,â etc.â (Strong, Science, N. S., Vol.

II. THE VALUE AND METHOD OF
ECOLOGICAL SURVEYS

âI cannot too strongly emphasize the fact ... that a comprehensive
survey of our entire natural history is absolutely essential
to a good
working knowledge
of those parts of it which
chiefly attract popular attention,âthat is, its edible fishes, its
injurious and beneficial insects, and its parasitic plants. Such a
survey, however, should not stop with a study of the dead forms
of nature, ending in mere lists and descriptions. To have an

applicable
value, it must treat the life of the region as an organic
unit, must study it
in action
, and direct principal attention to
the laws of its activity.ââ
S. A. Forbes.
1883.

Natural history surveys have come down to us
from the early days of zoÃ¶logy. These surveys have
been of many kinds and have ranged from the
adventurous accounts of early and daring explorers
to those of such naturalists as Belt, Bates, Wallace,
and Darwin, onward to the voluminous accounts of
the âBiologia Centrali-Americana,â and in the
Challenger

reports. These surveys have contributed
greatly to our knowledge of the fundamental facts
of zoÃ¶logy and to the training of naturalists.

The most frequent form of survey is that carried
on along the lines which most nearly approach
individual and aggregate ecology. Most of such
surveys give only slight attention to the
responsive
relation
, or only to its most general aspects. Surveys
[Pg 24]

of the usual character are of great importance, and
with students of taxonomic training and interests
only, this form of survey occurs very naturally.
Most of the governmental and state surveys and
museum expeditions are developed along these
lines. The frequency with which such methods are
used in surveys, which are expected to produce
economic results, indicates that these methods are
generally considered the most satisfactory. The
exceptions to this rule are mainly surveys of fresh
and salt waters, and are related in some way to
aquatic resources. Except when detailed individual
studies of certain species or some special subject
has been made, the usual form of the reports of such
surveys is the annotated list. It is rarely that even
brief chapters discuss the groupings of the animals
as they are found associated in nature. These
statements show that, judging from the past, the
methods currently used cannot be depended upon
for a rapid and symmetrical development of
ecology, or for the best development of ecological
surveys. These must be developed in a more direct
and deliberate manner, by carefully planned and
executed ecological investigations. It is desirable
also that ecological surveys should be conducted
along some one of the three main avenues of approach,
individual, aggregate, and associational, in
order that the science may develop symmetrically.
The following are some of the reasons which may
be mentioned in favor of such surveys:

As a record of the associations, their interrelations
[Pg 25]

and responses to their environmentâbefore they
have become too much changed or exterminated.
This is a duty to future naturalists and to future
science. The animal remains in themselves are only
a very incomplete record; their activities and environments
are an essential part of the animals and
should also be preserved.

The study of original conditions is a simpler problem
than after interference by man, but excessive
modifications result in the simplicity due to annihilation
and a corresponding imperfection of
knowledge. The value of a knowledge of original
conditions tends to increase with time, and will aid
much in future interpretations when there is still
more disturbance. Thus an important perspective
may be developed which will aid in estimating
relative values. At the present time the loss of
records of original conditions is only beginning to be
felt. The possibility of making certain records will
vanish with each generation. It is not even desirable
to
preserve all
, but it is evident that many ecological
records should be preserved.

As the importance of ecological studies, in natural
environments, comes to be more generally recognized
the serious encroachments of civilization upon habitats
and associations is enforced upon us. Not only
are the descriptions of these associations very few
in number, but the interrelations of the animals in
them are even less known, and the chances of preserving
adequate records before their complete extinction
are becoming fewer every year. Without
[Pg 26]

the least disparagement of other lines of work, one
can but wonder if the naturalists of the future will
commend our foresight in studying with such great
diligence certain aspects of biology which might
be very well delayed, while ephemeral and vanishing
records are allowed to be obliterated without the
least concern. These changes are generally greatest
where civilized man is most dominant, and in progressive
attenuations, zones, or strips, the degree of
change produced by him radiates. Ecology has
developed only at a late stage in civilization, after
much of the environment has undergone great
changes, so that in order to study the original conditions,
which are of such great historic and genetic
significance, he must make long journeys, or invade
the swamps or sterile uplands which man has
not yet been able to reduce to the average conditions
best suited to his needs. This state of
affairs is one which, at times, makes him thankful
that there are conditions which, for the present at
least, man cannot cultivate and utterly change and
mutilate. Some appear to think that an interest in
such original conditions is of no particular scientific
value, or is largely one of sentiment; still others, that
such studies have no practical value. But if we
come to consider that the original primeval conditions
give us our best conception of the
normal processes
of nature
and are comparable to the normal
health of an organism, it puts the subject in another
light. A pathological condition is, of course, a
state in a natural process, as is also any disturbance
[Pg 27]

of the normal order of nature by man, and each
should be studied scientifically. But the science
of pathology has developed best as a study of the
disturbances of normal processes and is interpreted
primarily in terms of the normal; and the artificial
should be similarly interpretedâthe natural being
the basis to which all standards must be referred.
A comparison may also profitably be made between
natural conditions and the physiological and
vital optima of organisms and to the responses which
are made with departures from such conditions.
Similar comparisons should be made in the study
of the responses of aggregations and associations
in natural environments and departures from them.
No matter how much we learn, the normal must
remain as the ideal, and all departures from and disturbances
of such conditions must be interpreted in
terms of this fundamental unit.

To study disturbed, artificial, and âpathologicalâ
conditions, without an adequate knowledge of the
normal and original conditions of both the organisms
and the environment, is an attempt to interpret
the abnormal and artificial in terms of itself, rather
than in terms of the normal. If, however, the normal
is no longer preserved, then its nearest approach
should be studied, but with all the more care and
caution. With a proper understanding of the
normal, the disturbances made by man will be capable
of
interpretation in an orderly sequence strictly
comparable to that found in the original and natural
conditions
. The cutting down and washing of the
[Pg 28]

lands, the draining and filling of depressions, the
flooding of the lands, the destruction (or succession)
of plant and animal associations (including crop rotation),
are processes brought about or practiced by
other organisms or animal agencies. An ecological
standpoint gives us a consistent, comprehensive
orientation of all these natural and âartificialâ activities
and processes, and shows the unity in all
organic responses to the environment. Manâs influence
in the main consists of hastening or retarding
ânatural processes.â

Naturalists have for a long time spoken of the
âbalance of natureâ and of the all-pervading influence
of any serious disturbance of it. This
balance is, of course, only a relative condition, and
not absolutely fixed. It swings from one side, then
back, sometimes showing considerable amplitude
in its swing, then again its moves are very slight,
mere tremblings, as it were. But now and then
some local catastrophic event occurs which overturns
everything, as when a volcano becomes active, or
some dominant association takes possession of the field,âas
in the case of man,âand a new order is initiated
and a new balance is developed. The mongoose
in Jamaica, our English sparrow, and rabbits in
Australia are the classic examples of the overturning
of the local order of nature by the agency of other
organisms. Obviously this balance is not a condition
limited to any particular locality or group
of organisms. Balance is very generally conceded
to be of fundamental importance in the study of any
[Pg 29]

species or group of organisms, if its place in the economy
of nature is understood. A vast number of the
problems of the economic zoÃ¶logist are thus problems,
not so much of individual or aggregate ecology, but
ones in which the balance of the whole local biotic

association
is concerned.

This was the fact pointed out by MÃ¶bius when he
studied the oyster and came to see that it must be
studied not in isolation but as a member of a community,
association of animals, or a biocÅnosis,
as he called these interrelated organisms. These
facts are mentioned, as examples from a vast number
that are recorded, to show that our applied or
economic zoÃ¶logy and entomology are
fundamentally
more closely related to associational ecology
than to
any other phase of zoÃ¶logy, and to suggest that it
would be to the great advantage of the students
of such problems if they clearly understood this
relation. This is also an argument for the ecological
organization of a vast number of natural history
surveys, because the associational grouping of
observations and responses gives the most intimate
knowledge of the life of animals in the network of
their environmental relations.

In addition to the balance of nature which is
found within the small associational units there are
the larger ones of considerable geographic extent,
which the students of faunal or floral problems frequently
call zones or distinct regions. Some of these
are distinct ecological units, whose
dynamic status

should be determined, so that we may know and
[Pg 30]

understand whether it is in a condition of stress, a
process of adjustment, or one of relative equilibrium
or balance. Under present conditions in what
direction does it tend to move? At what rate?
The non-ecological surveys have not put these questions
or worked deliberately toward a goal which
will answer them. For any comprehensive study of
this character we need to have determined what may
be considered as a
biotic base
, optimum, or balance,
toward which relations under given conditions tend,
and at which an equilibrium will become established
(The Auk, 1908, Vol. XXV, p. 125). Such facts
underlie all of the problems involved in the interpretation
of climax biotic associations, and their application
by man. Cook (1909, Bull. 145, Bur. Plant
Industry, U. S. Dept. Agriculture, pp. 7, 8) has
expressed similar relations as follows: âUnless we
can form a definite idea of the original conditions
we cannot expect to judge of their influence on
primitive man, nor can we determine what effects
man has had upon the vegetation and other natural
conditions. We need what might be called a
bionomic base line, an idea of the conditions which
existed before man came upon the scene, the conditions
which would again supervene if the human
inhabitants were withdrawn.â

It is perhaps significant that the genetic or successional
relations of habitats and associations, as contrasted
with their descriptive classification, both in
plants and animals, have in the past been developed,
not by the ecological students who live and work among
[Pg 31]

conditions greatly modified by man, as in parts of
Europe, but in the newer, less modified America. In
this respect a parallel exists to the development of
our knowledge and the process and genetic interpretation
of topography, which has also developed more
rapidly in America than elsewhere. The process and
genetic method which has developed in this physical
science has now spread to the biological sciences and
has found a fertile soil there for development on
account of the
relatively
undisturbed biotic conditions
which still persist in certain areas.

In this connection it may be worth while to indicate
some of the ecological disadvantages under which the
non-ecological surveys are carried on. As a rule,
such surveys feel no strong obligation to record fully
the conditions of the environment, or its developmental
processes. The environment is considered as
static, and not as a changing medium; it has no past
or future, it has merely horizontal extension. The
problem as to its
dynamic status
, whether in a condition
of stress, in the process of adjustment, or in
relative equilibrium, is not raised, or if it should be,
it could not be handled. The student eager for
new and little-known species is not the one to study
such relations, at least, as a rule, this has not been
his practice. So long as the success of a dayâs work
is measured by the length of the list of novelties
secured, rather than by the quality and quantity
of ecological relations discovered, such students and
surveys will not contribute greatly to our knowledge
of the economy of nature in the regions surveyed.

[Pg 32]

At the present time it is very difficult to secure
trained men to do ecological surveying. Even a
superficial examination of this paper should show
that familiarity with ecologic methods and results
is not one to be acquired offhand, but a knowledge
which requires considerable special training; not
only as much as is usually required for other kinds
of zoÃ¶logical work, but generally more, because of
its synthetic relational tendency which requires a
broad knowledge as well as some special knowledge
in several lines of biology and the allied sciences.
Conventionally considered, a properly equipped
physiologist must have a working knowledge of
certain phases of modern physics and chemistry in
addition to his grounding in biology. A properly
trained anatomist should have a knowledge of physiological
and developmental processes, or his anatomy
is purely descriptive and static. A student of general
zoÃ¶logy should be grounded not only in physiological
and developmental processes, but also in the relations
of the organisms to their complete environment.
The ecologist requires also the grounding in physiological,
developmental, and ecological processes
of adjustment, but as well he must understand the
processes by which the vegetation and the physical
environment have been and are being developed
and their method of mutual interrelations and adjustment.
It is difficult for some students to develop
the ecological phases in the field. There are many
disadvantages to be overcome. The difficulties are
similar, in some respects, to those of the ethnologist
[Pg 33]

who is sent on some museum expedition. The
wealthy donor of the funds may wish to see a room
filled with specimens on the return of the ethnologist,
so that materials which have bulk and make a showing
take precedence over detailed studies of the
habits, traditions, languages, and descriptions of
the people, because such studies require appreciation
rather than inspection for evaluation. The zoÃ¶logical
student may meet with just the same kind of
difficulty. His institutional authorities often judge
values by the cubic foot and pound, rather than
by the quality of relations discovered. The student
himself who has had an extensive collecting experience,
in which quantity and variety have been
the ideal, finds it difficult to return from a dayâs
work with only a few pages of notes on the responses
of the animals, and with perhaps only a few specimens.

With such an understanding of the general rules
of the game we may turn to the application or art
of ecology, to indicate its relation to general problems.
With a grounding in the general principles of organic
response to the total environment, one is able to see
that the disturbances due to man are a problem in
the adjustment of the highest type of animal, as a
member of an animal association, to its complete
environment. The âcontrol of natureâ for which
men strive is the process of making the environments
and associations
to order
. The disturbances in the
natural order may be looked upon as so many huge
experiments or trial activities in this process of
adjustment.

[Pg 34]

If natural preserves are not made, how will the
next generation be best grounded in the general
principles of the science? Are these complex modified
conditions the natural place to start the student,
or should such problems be reserved for the maturely
trained one? These disturbed fragmentary conditions
may be likened to fragmentary fossils whose
interpretation is attempted. A paleontologist whose
only knowledge of animals was derived from such
fragments, and who had never known a perfect living
animal, would certainly be at a great disadvantage
in such an investigation. The natural starting point
therefore seems to be in as nearly natural normal environments
and associations as is possible, and with
such experience one is prepared for the more complex
problems resulting from manâs activity.

By way of conclusion, some of the main advantages
of ecological surveys are:

1. The
record
of natural environments and their
associations for future generations.

2. The study of natural biotic conditions giving
a
perspective
not derived in any other way.

3. The clearer conception of the
dynamic relations

of the balance of nature, biotic base, and
climax associations.

4. Emphasis of the
process and interpretative

phase of scientific investigation over that of purely
descriptive study.

5. Facilitating the invention of multiple working
hypotheses which bear upon animal responses in
nature.

[Pg 35]

6. Furnishing important conceptions to the study
of the
processes
of adaptation and the struggle for
existence.

III. FIELD STUDY

âIs not the biological laboratory which leaves out the ocean
and the mountains and meadows a monstrous absurdity? Was
not the greatest scientific generalization of your times reached
independently by two men who were eminent in their familiarity
with living things in their homes?ââ
Brooks
, 1899, p. 41.

In taking up field work, or any other kind of complex
study, a definite working plan is of much value.
For this reason this subject deserves more than a
mere mention. Such a plan greatly aids in keeping
in mind the general aim of the study, and particularly
the lesser aims which develop with the analysis of
the subject. It further aids in the proper orientation
and subordination of allied subjects which crowd in
from all directions.

For many students it is a good plan to make out a
general outline of any proposed study as soon as
possible after the work has been started. In the beginning
it is difficult to realize the radiating relations
of a subject, and the attempt at such plans aids
in the perception of these relationships and becomes
an important guide. Such an outline will need
several revisions, but these changes will come with
a broadening and deepening grasp of the subject.
Perhaps the greatest value of such a plan is that
it facilitates the conscious effort to seek a definite
[Pg 37]

goal by maintaining a standard of measurement.

In addition to a comprehensive analytical plan
others are useful. Particularly is this true when
several lines of work are being done simultaneously
or when the work must be interrupted frequently.
Under such circumstances even a daily program may
aid in utilizing many of the fragments of time which
are so easily lost. In this way incomplete observations,
verifications, and similar small items which
are time-consuming may be made. These plans
apply with particular force to field study when
several lines of observation are being driven abreast.
I have found it profitable to keep memoranda on
note slips which will recall items needing further
attention, at certain places in the field or on certain
subjects. Thus, for example, if plans are suddenly
changed and another locality is visited, the proper
note slips indicating the points for special study at
such a place are quickly secured, and one can
hasten to the field prepared for the work of the day.
Of course, similar plans are applicable to many
kinds of work.

To learn how to study in the field, and not simply
to collect, is one of the most important habits which
a field naturalist and the ecologist has to acquire.
This is one which he must, to a large degree, master
alone, without the ready access to assistance, as is
usually the case in the laboratory study. It is also a
subject about which it is difficult to give useful suggestions,
other than those of the most general nature.
[Pg 38]

Directions for collecting are, on the other hand, simpler
and more accessible in the form of numerous manuals
filled with practical suggestions.

Field study is not confined to observations alone,
but to the securing of all kinds of evidence from the
field which will aid in the interpretation of the
field relations of animals. Thorough intimacy with
the animals can only be acquired through repeated
and prolonged excursions in the field. This may
mean excursions at any hour of the day or night. Part
of this familiarity is best acquired by an intensive
study of some limited area or association, and by
thus establishing a unit for comparison so that the
differences in other places are more readily perceived
and described.

Before selecting a limited area for study one should
make a general examination of a much larger tract, so
that one may be sure that the area selected is a fair
sample and worthy of the special study. There are
also many advantages in selecting areas little modified
by man. Such modified areas may, to better
advantage, be considered later; just as pathology
should be studied after one is grounded in normal
histology. Undoubtedly the normal, or its approximation,
is the best foundation upon which to build,
and here we have the educational argument for
natural preserves for animals and their superiority
over highly modified âparksâ for the same purpose.

Having selected a locality, repeated and prolonged
visits, careful observation, and description of the
place and animals will enable one to acquire the desired
[Pg 39]

familiarity. For the study of the behavior
of the animals concerned many observations can
be made by remaining quiet, carefully concealed,
and recording all observations. This method is
particularly applicable to animals which live in
exposed places, such as many insects, birds, and
mammals. For other kinds, only indirect methods
of observation are possible, or only when under
controlled conditions. For the indirect methods of
observation many forms of traps have been devised,
traps not intended merely to receive the dead animal,
but those also which will secure the animal and
reveal something of its behavior. For the study of
the habits and behavior of such animals as live in
the soil or under bark, etc., both extensive collecting
and examination of the animals in vivaria will also
be necessary.

Fortunately for the student of mammals, birds, and
fishes we have excellent guides for the technique of
study and photographing of individual and associated
kinds in the works of Kearton (1907), Chapman
(1900), Herrick (1905), and Reighard (1908). It
is very desirable that these methods be applied to
the interrelations among the animals of an association.
The student of behavior in nature has much
to learn from many excellent studies of animal
behavior which have been carried on in recent years
by laboratory students. Fortunately the line between
these two methods of study is breaking down to
the mutual advantage of each. The border line
between these two methods will give excellent returns
[Pg 40]

to any student well prepared in each line of
work.

Another essential for good field work is a clear
understanding of what ecological studies attempt
to do. This implies some general conception of
what is worth while ecologically; it assumes a point of
view or other criterion which may be applied to
test the trueness of oneâs aim. The ecologist will
meet with much more than ecological facts, but it is
to these that he should give primary attention.
These accessory facts, no matter how interesting in
themselves, should not divert him from the main
course. The ecologist must select from this mass of
experience those facts, inferences, and conclusions
which help in the
interpretation
of the responses of
animals to their complete environment. It is thus
evident why the ecologist must have a clearly
defined aim, with criteria for estimating values,
or he will be at the risk of dissipating his energies.
This phase of our problem as applied to the studies
of a geologist, but applying with equal force to the
ecologist, has been concisely expressed by Van
Hise (1904, pp. 611-612) as follows: âI have heard a
man say: âI observe the facts as I find them, unprejudiced
by any theory.â I regard this statement
as not only condemning the work of the man, but
the position is an impossible one. No man has
ever stated more than a small part of the facts with
reference to any area. The geologist must select
the facts which he regards of sufficient note to record
and describe. But such selection implies theories of
[Pg 41]

their importance and significance. In a given case
the problem is therefore reduced to selecting the facts
for record, with a broad and deep comprehension
of the principles involved, a definite understanding
of the rules of the game, an appreciation of what is
probable and what is not probable; or else making
mere random observations. All agree that the
latter alternative is worse than useless, and therefore
the only training which can make a geologist safe,
even in his observations, is to equip him with such a
knowledge of the principles concerned as will make
his observations of value.â

Early in field work one should learn that the
collection of specimens is not the primary aim of
excursions, that specimens are only
one
kind of
facts, but that field study should be devoted to the
accumulation of specimens, and to observations on
the habits, activities, interrelations, and responses
of animals, as well as to all facts, inferences, and
suggestions which are likely to be of use in the interpretation
of the problems studied.

We sometimes hear that reflections upon the work
should be reserved for the return to the laboratory
or study. This advice seems to be based upon the
assumption that study in the field is not particularly
stimulating and suggestive. On the other hand deliberating
interpretatively in the midst of the problems
under consideration is one of the most favorable
conditions possible for the improvement of the quality
and quantity of oneâs work. It should be recalled in
this connection that Darwin and Wallaceâs evolutionary
[Pg 42]

theory did not
originate
in the laboratory, but
while in the field in the midst of their studies, while
working reflectively upon their observations and
collections, as Brooks indicates in the quotation
at the beginning of this chapter. The classic case
of Bates discovering mimicry in his London study
instead of in the forests of Brazil is to some minds
not an argument for laboratory study, but one for
field study. There are but few subjects which have
suffered more from the preponderating influence of
the laboratory.

To be sure, it may require more time to study in
the field than if one collects specimens only, but it is
economical in the long run. There are, of course,
certain phases of more indirect observation which
can be done best in the study or laboratory, but at
present, field study, as contrasted with collecting,
is a phase of effort urgently needing emphasis.

The processes of observation and field study and
note taking are so intimately related that taking
notes becomes one of the essential parts of careful
observation. This is also one of the most difficult
habits to acquire. The beginner is inclined to write
them up, especially field notes, in the evening after
his return from the field. Such notes are generally
brief, lack details, and are usually of little value.
Therefore the safest course to pursue is to describe
fully whatever seems of value, then to go over these
facts again and by further observations increase the
number of items noted several times. These observations
should be recorded
as soon as made
, for
[Pg 43]

generally the lack of notes means a lack of detailed
observation. Some observations can be made only
at long intervals, even of many years, others only
with the return of another cycle of behavior, or of
another season, and still others cannot be repeated.
It is such considerations as these which emphasize
the need of pursuing the safest course and recording

instantly
and fully all observations when made. An
excess of notes is of very rare occurrence. In the
effort to write carefully worded notes one has a very
important check upon the tendency toward hasty
observation, because such a description requires
one to think over the observation before it can be
expressed. This deliberation is thus made at the
time when reobservation can be made to the best
advantage, and calls attention to the weak points
to which special consideration may perhaps be given
a moment later, and thus affords a chance to complete
the observation. Comstock (Insect Life, 1897,
p. 323) has well summed up the taking of notes as
follows: âFill your notebook with descriptions, but
digest them carefully, sifting out for publication only
those that exhaustive study and repeated observation
prove to be valuable. In making observations

be sure
you are right and then look again.â
And again as Van Hise (Science, N. S., Vol. XVI, p.
326) has said, âThe difference between
bad
observation
and
good
observation is that the former is

erroneous
; the latter is
incomplete
.â

Notes are generally taken in one of two forms,
in a book or on loose slips of paper or cards (Hopkins,
[Pg 44]

1893; Sanderson, 1904). It seems to be very
generally agreed that if a book is used it should be
of small size, of about 4 Ã 6 inches, so that it may be
conveniently carried in the pocket. For a permanent
record such books are a great convenience when
once indexed. But when using such notes, while
preparing a report, they are not so convenient as
the note slips, unless one limits such a report to the
form of a narrative. About ten years ago the writer
began using a form of notebook in which an aluminum
cover held the loose note slips. Thus while in the
field one has the advantage of a book with a firm
writing surface, and also that of the loose-leaf plan.
This form of cover is now used by a number of field
naturalists. The disadvantage of the slips not being
bound might be remedied in part by using some
form of punched slips which are convenient for
binding.

Each one must decide for himself which form of
recording notes answers his needs most satisfactorily.
There are advantages in uniformity, but with the
variable nature of work, it is sometimes very convenient
to use both methods of recording.

Some students have no method of recording their
observations or reflections upon their lines of interest.
This seems to be unwise and suggests a method of
business without bookkeeping. The efficiency of
some students is greater than that of others, not so
much because they possess superior mental ability,
but because they have superior methods of preserving
whatever useful ideas occur to them, while the others,
[Pg 45]

from their lack of records, have no cumulative store
upon which to draw. This is an important form of
capital. Note keeping is readily seen to consist not
only of observations, but also of suggestions, inferences,
conclusions, and reflections of any kind which
will facilitate methods of work and the interpretation
of the facts.

In describing environments, it is desirable to
use the same general method for different localities
so that the descriptions may be comparable and show
some degree of standardization. This method has
been found very useful in taxonomic studies and has
similar advantages here. A brief general statement
of the most conspicuous features may precede, and
be followed by detailed descriptions. The order
may well vary with individual workers, but a uniform
method is desirable throughout any single
piece of work and has obvious advantages. Thus one
practical plan applied to a forest habitat is, to describe
the substratum, the soil, rock, etc., then the forest
litter of organic dÃ©bris, then the boles of the trees
and the forest crown and its character, and finally
the operation of those agencies which are causing
changes in the forest and which will perpetuate
or change it in the future. No practical forester
would be content to shut his eyes to the future crop
of wood, and in the study of animal habitats we must
not be content to rest below such a commercial standard.
To some this seems very theoretical, and yet
a farmer who counts upon a crop in five months,
or a forester, in fifty years, is not so branded, and
[Pg 46]

the ecologist need have no fear in using such practical
methods. In other words, we should consider the
future stages of the developing habitat and learn
to perceive the evidences which show in which direction
development or change is taking place; or to
determine the âorderly sequence of external nature.â
Not only should the future be considered, but we
should strive also to read the record backward and
interpret the past in terms of processes now in
operation. In this respect the point of view of the
geologist who interprets the past in terms of present
processes may well merit our attention. To understand
our habitats they must be studied not only
in their length and breadth, but also in depthâpast
and futureâas they have all three dimensions.

The preceding remarks bear equally well upon
observations of the activities of animals in nature,
on account of the absence of controlled conditions,
for these methods have almost as much significance
as the study of the environments themselves; and
equally careful observations and descriptions are
essential, if the detailed processes of animal activities
and their transformations are to be recorded.

An experienced naturalist finds that from year to
year the amount of notes which he takes increases rapidly,
and in a very direct ratio to the progress which
he makes in his study. Good note taking is not a
passive process, but one which calls for an alert mind.
The prolonged interest which is necessary to secure
detailed observations implies such a frame of mind.
[Pg 47]

Every one soon tires of any subject unless new
features are constantly being discovered.

In the description of the associations in any given
habitat, the problem is much simplified if one has a
clear idea of dominance, knows how to recognize
it, and understands some of its main implications.
The dominant forms are the most common and powerful
individuals in the association. They may or
may not be the most conspicuous, from a superficial
view. Conspicuousness may depend upon
size, but dominance refers to large absolute numbers
and to influence exerted. We may profitably compare
an association of animals in a given habitat to a
play upon the stage. The environment corresponds
to the stage. The dominant members of the association
correspond to the leading characters, the
secondary species, always present, to the essential
but subordinate characters. The individual animals
adjust themselves to one another, especially to the
dominant forms, and to the environment, as the
personalities in the play adjust themselves to the
dominant characters, to one another, and to the environment.
In both groups some individuals are
dominant, some used and useful, some are tolerated,
others pick up the crumbs, still others are predatory
or parasitic, and all must be mutually adjusted to
one another and to the environment.

The number of dominant species within an association
is relatively limited, a fact which holds for
both plants and animals. A knowledge of perhaps
200 or 300 species of animals (and 150 plants)
[Pg 48]

will enable one to work advantageously in many
localities (as in the state of Illinois). Of this number
perhaps not more than about one half or one third
can be considered dominant. Every one who has
tried to make extensive local lists of species knows
that it requires many years of collecting to secure a
large number of species. These rare species are
generally of quite minor importance ecologically.
Considerations of this character should be encouraging
to those who may be intimidated by the idea of
large numbers of species. Then, of course, it should
be remembered that there are many aspects of ecological
work which do not meet with this variety of
animals.

[Pg 49]

IV. THE COLLECTION, PRESERVATION
AND DETERMINATION OF SPECIMENS

Ecological study does not end with collecting
specimens, and it may not begin there. The importance
of collecting and preserving specimens will vary
with the phase of ecological study considered. In
the field study of behavior of a single species there
may be almost no collecting of animals but much
collecting of notes; but if one is devoted primarily
to the recognition and study of the composition of
associations and their interrelations, much collecting
will have to be done. Also, when studying the
ecological relations of some taxonomic unit, as in
aggregate ecology, the number of associates is so large
that one must do rather extensive collecting. But
even the exhaustive study of the behavior of any
single species will necessitate considerable collecting.
The necessity for this has been shown by Forbes
(1880, The Food of Fishes, p. 20) as follows: âIf
one wishes to become acquainted with the black bass,
for example, he will learn but little if he limits himself
to that species. He must evidently study also
the species upon which it depends for its existence,
and the various conditions upon which
these
depend.
He must likewise study the species with
which it comes in competition, and the entire system
[Pg 50]

of conditions affecting their prosperity. Leaving out
any of these, he is like one who undertakes to make
out the construction of a watch, but overlooks one
wheel; and by the time he has studied all these
sufficiently, he will find that he has run through the
whole complicated mechanism of the aquatic life
of the locality, both animal and vegetable, of which
his species forms but a single element.â

Collecting is an important means of ecological
study. This is particularly true in the early stages
of such study, but as the student becomes familiar
with species and comes to know many of them at
sight, less collecting will be necessary, except in the
case of very small species and in those studies which
depend upon the total catch as a means of securing
data, as, for example, the case of plankton organisms.
On account of the large number of species, very few
students will be able to determine them at sight,
but this does not disqualify a student for beginning
ecological study. The greatest aid in handling such
a varied population is a numbering of the individuals,
or lots of specimens, consecutively and recording
the full data for them in the notebook. The question
arises at once as to how many specimens are
to be assigned to
one
number. No rigid rule can
be followed, but in general it is safe to assign a single
number to all specimens which agree in
all the fundamental
data
, as date, place of capture, and exact
habitat. And for my own part I number all individuals
taken, upon which any special observations
are made, as when a Phymatid is taken with a dying
[Pg 51]

or dead honeybee, or a dragon fly is taken from
the web of an
Argiope
. In this way the confusion
which is particularly liable to creep into oneâs work,
where he deals with a large number of species, and
before familiarity with them is acquired, may be
reduced to the minimum. For small animals I
have found useful a very liberal use of vials, into
which field numbers, corresponding to numbers
in the field notes, are placed
immediately upon capture

of the specimens, and not minutes or hours
later when the vials have become mixed, and recollection
is less sharp. Specimens which have been
thoroughly numbered may thus be sent to specialists
for determination. This method uses up many
numbers, but, fortunately, the supply is unlimited,
and it gives greater precision to oneâs notes, and encourages
detailed observations on individual animals.

In the eyes of many the determination of specimens
is such a formidable task that they are at once repelled
from any subject which involves numerous
species. But as we have previously remarked, there
are phases of ecological study which involve only
a minimum amount of such work. On the other
hand, one may readily have an undue fear of numerous
species, but no one can doubt that the smaller
number of species found upon mountains or in the far
north gives to a beginner certain advantages for
study. But if oneâs studies are confined to the more
restricted habitats, the number of species involved
is comparable to the more favored localities mentioned.

[Pg 52]

An accurately determined series of specimens,
conveniently arranged, will be an important aid
in oneâs studies. Two forms of arrangement of
such determined series are very helpful; one being
synoptic or systematically arranged, and the other
ecologically, by associations or by a topical arrangement
in harmony with the subjects being investigated.
With the use of such series and proper
caution, aided by the best keys in the literature,
one may hope to make many of his own determinations
and thus economize his time.

There are many ways to secure the initial series
of determined specimens, and some of these are
the following: Our governmental departments, both
national and state, and many of our large museums,
universities, and academies, have numerous experts
who are quite willing and even eager to aid earnest
students who wish to have specimens determined.
Then, in addition, there are many expert amateurs
who are equally liberal, so that when all the sources
of aid are considered, the list becomes a surprisingly
long one. This is the fact that should be called
to mind when considering large numbers of species.
A student therefore does not need to work alone,
but may have the coÃ¶peration of a large number of
able and willing collaborators. Naturally we turn
for aid to our United States National Museum as
one of the first sources of assistance, to the Smithsonian
Institution, and to the various scientific
departments of the U. S. Department of Agriculture,
particularly to the Bureaus of Plant Industry,
[Pg 53]

Biological Survey, and Entomology. These sources
alone are able to determine almost any reasonable
series of specimens, particularly if they are well
preserved. Arrangements for such determinations
can probably be made by addressing the proper
authorities.

The museums of our larger cities, as the American
Museum of Natural History of New York, the Carnegie
Museum at Pittsburgh, the Field Museum of
Chicago, and many smaller state and local museums
are able to give very efficient aid in this line. Other
local institutions are the State Universities and
Experiment Stations, and the local natural history
surveys, which often exist under the guise of a geological
or agricultural organization. Frequently
they are qualified and willing to do this work.

In very difficult cases it may be necessary to
have recourse to Cassellâs Naturalistâs Universal
Directory (Boston, 1905), in order to find the
address of some specialist in a foreign land, who
can help, but generally Americans are the best
informed upon their own fauna.

Supplementary to, and in some cases a necessary
substitute for, a reference series of authentically
determined specimens, is one which the student is
able to name for himself, by the study of the literature.
Without some special training this may
become dangerous ground to tread upon, but every
now and then some young student begins in this
way and develops such care in determining his
own collections, that the method cannot be wholly
[Pg 54]

condemned. Such work in itself has fascinations,
and one may easily occupy all oneâs time with it.
From the ecological standpoint to stop with determinations
only would be like acquiring a certain
vocabulary, and stopping before learning how to
use the language. Ecological work aims to use
the names of species as the most concise method of
referring to kinds of animals whose interrelations
are to be described and interpreted. Taxonomy is
the tool.

There is such an abundance of literature on the
technique of collecting and preserving specimens,
and so much of it can easily be secured by any earnest
student, that space will not be taken to discuss
these subjects in detail. Reference will simply
be made to the main convenient sources of information.
It should perhaps be mentioned that very
few of these papers have been especially prepared
from the standpoint of the animal ecologist. The
student must select and devise his methods from all
available sources.

I have included in this list a few references on
the subject of camping, photography, and the use
of instruments needed in the determination of the
physical features of the environment. A few miscellaneous
papers which are suggestive on methods
of technique are also added.

This contains, in addition to its suggestions on collecting,
an interesting outline or classification of animal
habitats (Cf. also Enderlein, 1908, pp. 72-77).
This is not a genetic classification. Dahlâs list of
habitats will prove very suggestive to the student
[Pg 60]

who wishes to develop the genetic system of classification.
Ultimately we must, of course, develop
the latter system.

In concluding this list of references I would suggest to the
student the desirability of securing the following catalogues or
lists of publications. A glance at the lists in this volume will
show that a surprisingly large number of the papers or works are
governmental publications, many of which have long been out
of print, but many may still be secured from the different departments
or from the Superintendent of Documents at Washington,
D.C.

maps. Washington, D.C.

the best methods of securing many publications which
are out of print.

3. The Preparation of Papers for Publication and on Proof
Reading

The preparation of papers for publication is a
practical phase of study and an art, or form of
technique, about which the zoÃ¶logical student is
liable to hear but little. There may be a great
economy of effort, and much time saved, if early in
[Pg 66]

his work the student realizes the need of cultivating
the
habit
of preparing all manuscripts in a form
suitable for publication. While there is much variation
in details, yet within certain limits there is a
certain amount of standardization which should become

habitual
. Departures from such a standard
necessitate much loss of time which must be devoted
to revisions and corrections. One may work for
years and fail to realize this fact, until he attempts
to adjust his habits of writing to the requirements
of the editors of scientific publications. The following
references are intended to cover the main
aspects of the preparation of manuscripts and the
reading of proof.

Lewes, George Henry
(Edited by F. N. Scott).

The four preceding papers are in many respects models
of presentation. They exemplify the process method
applied to
regions
, a phase of much importance in
certain ecologic studies, particularly ecological surveys.
The last two papers are rather detailed applications
of the same ideas. A very profitable
study may be made of the method of presentation
in these papers.

VI. IMPORTANT SOURCES OF INFORMATION
ON THE LIFE HISTORIES OF INSECTS
AND ALLIED INVERTEBRATES

Insects are to-day one of the dominant forms of
life and are present in almost every large animal
association or habitat. They therefore form an
important element in a large number of ecological
studies. And although facts of ecological significance
have been accumulating for many years they
are so widely scattered that to find them when
needed is quite a serious problem. To aid in such
a search the following references are given. It
should be remembered that spiders, mites, and
myriapods are commonly included in entomological
literature and are therefore included in this list.
The list is not intended as a substitute for the more
elaborate sources such as the ZoÃ¶logical Record
and similar standard works to be found in large libraries,
but it includes publications that are more likely
to be within the grasp of teachers and students not
located at library centers. Many of these are public
documents, and even if out of print, can easily be
secured from second-hand dealers.

A student who has access to large libraries will
find the following paper very valuable in suggestions
as to the methods of finding the literature on many
general zoÃ¶logical subjects.

VII. THE LAWS OF ENVIRONMENTAL
CHANGE, OR THE âORDERLY SEQUENCE
OF EXTERNAL NATUREâ

The Dynamic and Process Relations of the Environment

âOf all the truths relating to phenomena, the most valuable to
us are those which relate to the order of succession. On a knowledge
of these is founded every reasonable anticipation of future
facts, and whatever power we possess of influencing those facts
to our advantage.ââ
John Stuart Mill.

âTo study life we must consider three things: first, the orderly
sequence of external nature; second, the living organism and
the changes which take place in it; and, third, the continuous
adjustment between the two sets of phenomena which constitutes
life.ââ
W. K. Brooks.

âThe truth, indeed, is, that in physical inquiries, the work of
theory and observation must go hand in hand, and ought to be
carried on at the same time, more especially if the matter is very
complicated, for there the clue of theory is necessary to direct
the observer. Though a man may begin to observe without any
hypothesis, he cannot continue long without seeing some general
conclusion arise; and to this nascent theory it is his business to
attend, because, by seeking either to verify or to disprove it,
he is led to new experiments, or new observations. He is led
also to the very experiments and observations that are of the
greatest importance, namely to those
instantiÃ¦ crucis
, which are
the criteria that naturally present themselves for the trial of
[Pg 80]

every hypothesis. He is conducted to the places where the transitions
of nature are most perceptible, and where the absence of
former, or the presence of new circumstances, excludes the action
of imaginary causes. By this correction of his first opinion,
a new approximation is made to the truth; and by the repetition
of the same process, certainty is finally obtained. Thus theory
and observation mutually assist one another; and the spirit
of system, against which there are so many and such just complaints,
appears, nevertheless, as the animating principle of
inductive investigation. The business of sound philosophy is
not to extinguish this spirit, but to restrain and direct its efforts.â

â
J. Playfair
, âIllustrations of the Huttonian Theory of
the Earth,â Edinburgh, 1802, pp. 524-525.

The facts and ideas with which the animal ecologist
needs to become acquainted are so widely scattered
that a large amount of selective reading is
necessary. The ecologist must read, select, and
become an organizing center of things ecological.
All of the facts and conceptions which he needs are
not even confined to zoÃ¶logical or biological literature.
In seeking an understanding of any problem, conventional
groupings of the sciences and their arbitrary
boundaries must not bar one from fertile fields.
Many of the conceptions of the physical sciences,
due to their more advanced stage of development,
anticipate the future development of biology. This
is particularly true of their dynamic conceptions.
For this reason we should not hesitate to utilize and
deliberately strive to secure development along
similar lines in animal ecology. Elsewhere I have
stated (An Ecological Survey in Northern Michigan,
1906, pp. 11, 12) that: âIt is thus very apparent
[Pg 81]

that as soon as ecological phenomena are investigated
dynamically and expressed in terms of processes,
this science will of necessity become more closely
correlated with those allied sciences which have already
availed themselves of such methods.... It
seems a very simple matter to give assent to the idea
of the law of change, yet in its practical application
this simplicity often vanishes at once when it is
seen that it involves the relation of cause and effect....
As this method of thinking is not generally
understood, it is occasionally applied in such a crude
and general sense that its bearing cannot be grasped
when applied to special or concrete problems. There
can be no question as to the general validity of this
method, but what is now needed is to know how these
processes are combined and related to produce
particular environmental conditions or situations.
That these difficulties are not confined to the ecologist
alone, but are obstacles which arise in any
attempt at scientific interpretation, is worthy of
special notice. We are thus able to see why certain
naturalists, apparently not recognizing or understanding
the developmental processes which scientific ideas
undergo, nor being acquainted with the tendencies
of interpretation, dynamically considered, now making
such rapid headway in ecological botany, geography,
physiography, geology, and psychology, are inclined
to look upon such attempts in biology as merely a
fad or personal peculiarity of the student, and not of
any particular consequence. Such ideas confuse
the incidental with the essential and suggest a complete
[Pg 82]

failure to grasp the situation or to realize the
fundamental importance of stating explanations
in terms of processes. Furthermore, in several of
the allied sciences, the methods of dynamical interpretation
have already made considerable advance.
Here, then, is a resource, at present largely unworked
by many biologists, where a wealth of ideas and
explanations lies strewn over the surface and only
need to be picked up in order to be utilized by those
acquainted with this method of interpretation....
If the signs of the times are now read correctly, the
most striking advance in scientific methods of
thinking during the present century will be in the
direction of interpretation from the standpoint of
processesâdynamically.â

For these reasons I have begun the list of literature
with certain references which deal with the dynamic
relations of the environment. These publications
are particularly valuable not only for this method
of treatment, but also for their content. These
papers clearly emphasize the âorderly sequence of
external nature,â a conception which must be grasped
much more than superficially, if one is to interpret
the development or evolution of environments.
Although this is an essential part of our problem,
as has been so well expressed by Brooks, yet this
phase is probably one of the least understood by
zoÃ¶logists. And as long as zoÃ¶logical students lack
the proper training this condition will continue.
To neglect this aspect in the training of an ecologist
is like neglect of chemical training in a physiologist
[Pg 83]

or of a physiological training in a psychologist.
For one who is ignorant of the principles of âorderly
sequence,â or successions of changes occurring in the
physical, vegetational, and animal environments,
it is manifestly impossible to realize their development;
and the application of such principles to the
interpretation of practical problems is utterly beyond
his grasp. We are thus able to see that although the
phrase âorderly sequence of external natureâ is
fundamentally a simple conception, it is not grasped
without effort, training, and careful investigation.

Obviously it is impossible to arrange the series of
references with perfect satisfaction. The arrangement
which will serve one purpose will not another,
and for this reason it has been necessary to arrange
the lists in more than one order. Certain general
references, or some intended to facilitate the acquirement
of the general
point of view
, are given first, and
others are arranged alphabetically. For example,
the papers listed on the processes of change in the
physical and vegetational environment are approximately
in an order in which they may profitably be
studied to make the view as concrete as possible.
It is primarily not the abstract idea of the principle
of change, which is relatively easy to grasp, but to
be able to apply it to any condition or location and
to make it a guiding principle is very difficult. And
judging from my own observation upon others and
my own experience this method is very rarely mastered,
if at all, unless it is actually worked out in
[Pg 84]

some concrete case, and later expanded to its logical
consequences.

Only a few references are given on general physiology,
metabolism, and allied subjects, but those
given furnish a valuable index to further literature.
Only the most arbitrary line can be drawn between
papers dealing with habits, behavior, and individual
ecology, and for this reason most of the references
selected are arranged alphabetically.

Particular attention should be called to the fact
that it is not to be assumed that the various authors
strive to make the points to which attention is here
called; they may or may not do so. My aim is to
call attention to the
utility
of the publications from
the
standpoint
advocated throughout the book.

From this point onward in this book the references
form its main feature. For this reason it is important
that one should not get an exaggerated idea of the
value of the literature. It is perhaps true that a
large part of the best ecological work has been done
with little knowledge of other ecological writings.
This was of course particularly true of the early
workers, and the best work of to-day does not come
from the largest library centers. A student looking
over these lists, and finding that he has access to
relatively few papers, may conclude that all effort
is of no avail. The greatest need is not all or even
a majority of the publications on the
general field
,
but the relatively limited number which bear
directly upon the problem at hand and enough of
the general papers to aid him in a general orientation.
[Pg 85]

It may be of some comfort to the isolated student,
with his small shelf of books, to realize that there
are perhaps not a half-dozen libraries in America
which contain
all
the references given in this book.
The nearer one reaches the boundaries of our knowledge,
the smaller the amount, and often the smaller
the value of the literature, and the greater the value
of a proper orientation, which comes only with a
grasp of general principles.

âSeeing, then, that in all cases we may consider the external
phenomena as simply in relation, and the internal phenomena also
as simply in relation; the broadest and most complete definition
of Life will beâThe continuous adjustment of internal relations
to external relations.ââ
Herbert Spencer.

âIt is of the utmost importance, if we are to understand the
behavior of organisms, that we think of them as dynamicâas
processes, rather than as structures. The animal is something
happening.ââ
H. S. Jennings
(1907).

Not only is the environment subject to an orderly
sequence of changes, but this same law applies with
equal thoroughness to the living animal itself.
The animal is an agent which transforms, in âan
[Pg 93]

orderly sequence,â by its processes of metabolism,
both energy and substance, resulting in growth,
differentiation, multiplication, and behavior. These
activities take place in an orderly manner and are
dependent upon both energy and substance derived
from the environment. For these reasons the
processes or changes in metabolism, growth, development,
and behavior,
in so far as they are responses
to the orderly sequence of environmental changes, are
ecological problems
. The changes in behavior during
the life of the animal or the development of its
behavior give one of the main clues to the physiological
conditions which determine some of the most
characteristic forms of responses, and finally as a
result of all these activities and processes of adjustment
to the conditions of life, a relatively mature and
adjusted condition of the struggle for existence in
animals and associations may be reached, the culmination
of animal harmonies. For this reason
studies in modifications of behavior are of fundamental
ecological importance, because they consider
behavior not only as ready-made, but also in the
process of making. Such considerations as these
make it desirable to include some of the most valuable
and suggestive books and papers which deal with those
general physiological processes influencing growth,
development, multiplication, and behavior, and

particularly those which aid one in realizing their
order or successive changes, or âorderly sequence.â

In studying the activities of the individual animal,
the normal environment to which it is
attuned
[Pg 94]

forms the natural unit or basis for study. All
processes which modify or change such an optimum
will stimulate the animal, cause responses and
adjustments. There are many degrees or stages in
the development of these optima which change with
the functional rhythms and with the development of
the animal. There are those conditions which influence
the activity of certain functions or organs;
those which influence the general vital processes in
general, the vital optimum; those which appear to
condition the best development of certain families,
genera, etc.; and finally those of animal associations.
Of course these grade imperceptibly into one
another, and a single animal may in its development,
traverse all of these stages in the development
of its associational optimum. Optima thus have
histories, and their development and laws of transformation
are of the most fundamental ecological
importance (Adams, 1904, 1909; Blackman, 1905,
1906; Shelford, 1911, 1912).

In the selection of these papers I have been guided
by several considerations. Studies of common
animals are given preference, also those papers
which by their method of treatment and point of
view are especially suggestive and may act
as models for further study, and particularly those
papers which treat of the activities from the standpoint
of their changes, cycles, modifiability, and
development. It is to such papers that we must look
for suggestions regarding the methods or processes
of adjustment between the animal and the environment.
[Pg 95]

All of these papers are not equally ecological,
but all will be of much utility in ecological
work.

The similar responses to diverse stimuli or the

conditions which make an analysis and the isolation
of causes necessary. With departures from the normal
and optimum into zones of stimulation and of
unfavorable conditions many similar effects or results
are produced. The similar results of extremes of
high and low temperature as shown in Fischerâs
experiments on Lepidoptera, and the effects of high
temperatures, aridity, and the lack of oxygen may
be cited as examples. Such effects have an important
bearing upon the subject of physical and

aggregations, and associations.

3. Animal Behavior as a Process

âThe actual method of work is to first watch the organism
under its natural environment, until one finds out all things it
does. Then the environment is changed a little, to see what
difference this makes in the behavior. We thus try all sorts of
different ways of getting the animal to change its behavior,âincluding
the application of definite chemical and physical
reagents of most varied character.... We thus try to find the
organismâs system of behavior and the things that influence it,âbecoming
acquainted with the creature as we might get acquainted
with a person with whom we are thrown much in contact.ââ
H.
S. Jennings
(1910).

âMy object being the study of the correlative instincts
of the young and adult in relation to all that could be learned
about them in a natural environment, I have followed my usual
custom of going out to the birds, instead of taking them into the
laboratory. The facts which the laboratory can be made to
yield are invaluable, but they belong to a different class from
those for which we are now mainly in search, behavior under the
usual or normal conditions.ââ
F. H. Herrick
(1910).

âAs will be seen, these studies include both field and laboratory
work, especially of the American species, and I have made
the field work emphatic wherever at all practicable. I have
elsewhere (1909, p. 157) [Jour. Exp. ZoÃ¶l., Vol. VII] emphasized
the crying need for larger attention to this phase of experimental
work, believing that in many cases it is all but impossible to
secure trustworthy results as to behavior of animals where the
work has been done under such unusual, unnatural and artificial
conditions as most laboratory provisions afford. What right
[Pg 103]

has one to assume that the actions of an animal taken rudely
from its natural habitat and as rudely imprisoned in some improvised
cage are in any scientific sense an expression of its
normal behavior, either physical or psychical? Is it within
the range of the calculus of probability that conclusions drawn
from observations made upon an animal in the shallow confines
of a finger-bowl, but whose habitat has been the open sea, are
wholly trustworthy? It is no part of my purpose to discredit
the laboratory or laboratory appliances as related to such investigations.
They are indispensable. But at the same time
let it be recognized that they are at best but artificial make-shifts
whose values, unless checked up by constant appeal to
nature, must be taken at something of discount.... It
seems to the writer that until one has been able to place his
specimens under conditions approximating the natural, or
has at least brought them to a state of semi-domestication,
where in food-taking, evidence of health, etc., they are at ease,
he has small right to dogmatize as to conclusions, or presume
to make such conclusions the basis of so-called laws of behavior.
Not a little of recent investigation along the lines of behavior has
been vitiated at just this point, and must be repeated to be made
trustworthy. The amazing mass of contradictory results which
has loaded the literature of recent years is attributable to some
extent to this misfortune.ââ
C. W. Hargitt
(1912).

âWe are apt to contrast the extremes of instinct and intelligence,
to emphasize the blindness and inflexibility of the one
and the consciousness and freedom of the other. It is like contrasting
the extremes of light and dark and forgetting all the
transitional degrees of twilight.... Instinct is blind; so
is the highest human wisdom blind. The distinction is one of
degree. There is no absolute blindness on the one side, and no
absolute wisdom on the other.ââ
C. O. Whitman
(1899).

The precedence here given to
changes in behavior

is in harmony with the emphasis which is put upon
[Pg 104]

processes
and genetic phases or sequences throughout
this book. As Holmes (1905, p. 108) has well pointed
out, behavior consists of relatively fixed and relatively
changeable responses, with intergradations. There are
thus two avenues of approach which he sums up as
follows (p. 112): âIn the trial and error method the
random character of the movement impresses us
most; in the tropisms, the element of direct determination
by the environment. Both of these factors
run through the behavior of all animals, but they are
mingled in various proportions in different forms.
In the lives of most, if not all animals both are essential
elements in the adjustment of the organism to
its conditions of existence.â And in regard to those
responses which do not change in form with experience,
he says (p. 106): âThe element of spontaneous
undirected activity is one of vast if not essential
importance in the life of nearly all animals. The
simpler animals profit by their varied experience,
although they may not learn, and thus secure some
of the advantages which it is generally considered
the special function of intelligence to confer.â Thus
to the ecologist studying the sequences of changes
in the environment, and changes in the organism, it is
but natural and consistent for him to apply the same
methods to behavior, in order to facilitate their
mutual relations and aid in their interpretation. In
a study of the environment we also have the relatively
stable elements and the relatively rapidly changing
ones, and any adequate understanding of animals
must correlate these four variables: two relatively
[Pg 105]

changing, one in the organism and one in the environment;
and two others relatively stable, one in
the organism and the other in the environment.

âNothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the
universal struggle for life, or more difficultâat least I have
found it soâthan constantly to bear this conclusion in mind.
Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, the whole
economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance,
extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite
misunderstood.ââ
Darwin.

âEvery reflective biologist must know that no living being is
self-sufficient, or would be what it is, or be at all, if it were not
part of the natural world, although no truth is easier to lose sight
of. Living things are real things, ... but their reality is in
their interrelations with the rest of nature, and not in themselves.ââ

2. The Dynamic Relations of Aggregations and Associations, with

âA group or association of animals or plants is like a single
organism in the fact that it brings to bear upon the outer world
only the surplus of forces remaining after all conflicts interior
to itself have been adjusted. Whatever expenditure of energy
is necessary to maintain the existing internal balance amounts
[Pg 131]

to so much power locked up, and rendered unavailable for
external use. In many groups this latent energy is so considerable
and is liable to such fluctuations, that a knowledge of its amounts
and kinds, and of the laws governing its distribution, is extremely
important to one interested in measuring or foreseeing the sum
and character of the outward-tending activities of the class.â

On pp. 721-729 the oyster is discussed as a member
of a social community or âbiocÃ¶nosis.â He describes
the succession of animals due to the overfishing
of the oyster beds and the invasion of cockles and
edible mussels which close up the available space
and prevent the return of the oyster. One of the
earliest papers to recognize clearly a social community
in animals. A very important paper, which
also shows the method of applying the science of
ecology.

a. The Relation of Animals to Pollination and to Plant Galls

The relation of animals to the pollination of plants and to
plant galls is a phase of the
associational relation
of organisms,
but it has rarely been considered (if at all) from the standpoint
of a
biotic community
. The following list will probably aid one
but little in gaining this general conception, but once the student
has it he will find the list of much assistance. Undoubtedly a
relatively new and fertile field for investigation would be to study
the interrelations of plants and their pollinators as an ecological
community, the association being taken as a unit rather than the
individual species of plants or animals.

Genetics.
An Introduction to the Study of Heredity

By
HERBERT EUGENE WALTER

Assistant Professor of Biology, Brown University

Cloth, 12mo, $1.50 net; postpaid, $1.63

In his âGeneticsâ Professor Walter summarizes the more recent
phases of the study of heredity and gives to the non-technical
readers a clear introduction to questions that are at present agitating
the biological world.

Professor Walterâs conception of sexual reproduction is that it
is a device for doubling the possible variations in the offspring, by
the mingling of two strains of germ plasm. The weight of probability,
he concludes, is decidedly against the time-honored belief
in the inheritance of acquired characters. Professor Walter also
predicts that the key to this whole problem will be furnished by
the chemist, and that the final analysis of the matter of the
âheritage carriersâ will be seen to be chemical rather than morphological
in nature. In the practical application of this theory to
human conservation or eugenics, it would follow that the only control
that a man has over the inheritance of his children is in
selecting his wife. Professor Walter holds, if only modifications
of the germ plasm can count in inheritance, and if these modifications
come wholly from the combination of two germ plasms, then
the only method of hereditary influence is in this selection.

âI find that it is a very useful study for an introduction to the subject. Professor
Walter has certainly made one of the clearest statements of the matters involved
that I have seen, and has made a book which students will find very useful because
he keeps everything in such entirely simple and clear outlines, and at the same
time he has brought the book up to date.ââ
Professor Loomis
of Amherst
College.

âI am much pleased with it and congratulate you upon securing so excellent a
treatment. It is one of the most readable scientific books I have, and goes unerringly
to the fundamentals of our most recent advances in the experimental study of
heredity as well as those of the older studies.ââ
Professor George H. Shull
,
Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, N. Y.

âThere was a decided need for just such a work. The book strikes me as most
excellently done.ââ
Professor H. S. Jennings
, Johns Hopkins University.

The Fitness of the Environment

By
LAWRENCE J. HENDERSON

Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry in Harvard University

Cloth, 12mo, $1.50 net

âDarwinian fitness is compounded of a mutual relationship
between the organism and the environment. Of this,
fitness of environment is quite as essential a component as
the fitness which arises in the process of organic evolution;
and in fundamental characteristics the actual environment is
the fittest possible abode of life.â Such is the thesis which
this work seeks to establish through discussions of the physical
and chemical characteristics of life and cosmogony, and
through critical study of the properties of matter in their
biological relations.

Water and carbonic acid are shown to be the primary
constituents of the environment. Analysis shows their properties,
together with those of the component elements, hydrogen,
oxygen, and carbon, to make up a series of maxima,
among all known compounds and elements, so numerous, so
varied, and so highly favorable, to the organic mechanism
that the fitness of the world for life assumes an importance
not less than the fitness which has been won by adaptation
in the course of organic evolution.

A final chapter discusses the bearing of these conclusions
upon theories of organic evolution, modern vitalism, including
the views of M. Bergson, and the old natural theology,
and seeks to harmonize implications of design with the
mechanistic view of nature.

COLLEGE ZOÃLOGY

By
ROBERT W. HEGNER, Ph.D.
Assistant Professor of ZoÃ¶logy in the University of Michigan

Illustrated, Cloth, 12mo, xxiv + 733 pp., $2.60 net

This book is intended to serve as a text for beginning students in universities
and colleges, or for students who have already taken a course in
general biology and wish to gain a more comprehensive view of the animal
kingdom. It differs from many of the college text-books of zoÃ¶logy now
on the market in several important respects: (1) the animals and their
organs are not only described, but their functions are pointed out; (2) the
animals described are in most cases native species; and (3) the relations
of the animals to man are emphasized. Besides serving as a text-book, it
is believed that this book will be of interest to the general reader, since it
gives a birdâs-eye view of the entire animal kingdom as we know it at the
present time.

Within the past decade there has been a tendency for teachers of zoÃ¶logy
to pay less attention to morphology and more to physiology. As a prominent
morphologist recently said, âMorphology ... is no longer in favor
... and among a section of the zoÃ¶logical world has almost fallen into
disgraceâ (Bourne). The study of the form and structure of animals is,
however, of fundamental importance, and is absolutely necessary before
physiological processes can be fully understood; but a course which is
built up on the âold-fashioned morphological linesâ is no longer adequate
for the presentation of zoÃ¶logical principles.

The present volume has not been made by merely adding a description
of the vertebrates to the authorâs âIntroduction to ZoÃ¶logyâ (for a brief
account of which see the last pages of this circular). On the contrary, it
is a new work throughout, although the same general method of treatment,
which proved so successful in the earlier book, has been employed in this
one. Similarly, in the preparation of this book the author has submitted
the manuscript of each chapter to a scholar and teacher of unquestioned
authority in the particular field. The criticisms and suggestions thus secured
have greatly increased both the accuracy and the practicability of
the text.

An Introduction to ZoÃ¶logy

By
ROBERT W. HEGNER, Ph.D.
Instructor in ZoÃ¶logy in the University of Michigan

Illustrated, 12mo, $1.90 net

Only a few animals belonging to the more important phyla, as viewed
from an evolutionary standpoint, are considered. They are, however, intensively
studied in an endeavor to teach the fundamental principles of ZoÃ¶logy
in a way that is not possible when a superficial examination of types from
all the phyla is made. Furthermore, morphology is not specially emphasized,
but is coÃ¶rdinated with physiology, ecology, and behavior, and serves
to illustrate by a comparative study the probable course of evolution. The
animals are not treated as inert objects for dissection, but as living organisms
whose activities are of fundamental importance. No arguments are
necessary to justify the âtype course,â developed with the problems of organic
evolution in mind, and dealing with dynamic as well as static phenomena.

âI have read your chapter (The Crayfish and Arthropods in General)
and can express my satisfaction with reference to the general
arrangement of the matter, as well as with reference to the detail.
The whole treatment is up to date, taking account of the modern advancement
in our knowledge of the crayfishes, and, chief of all, the
more important features in the natural history of these animals are
very properly separated from the unimportant ones. I think this
chapter gives the essence of what we know about crayfishes, and any
student might use the book advantageously. In fact, I know no other
text-book which gives such a wealth of information upon so few
pages.ââProfessor
A. E. Orthmann
, Carnegie Museum.

âThe plan is very satisfactory, and the book will be very instructive
for class use. I am very glad that you have chosen the bee as your
insect type.â (Chapter XII.)âDr.
E. E. Phillips
, Department of
Agriculture, Washington, D.C.

Household Bacteriology

BY
ESTELLE D. BUCHANAN, M.S.
Recently Assistant Professor of Botany, Iowa State College

AND
ROBERT EARLE BUCHANAN,
Ph.D.
Professor of Bacteriology, Iowa State College, and Bacteriologist of the
Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station

Cloth, 8vo, xv + 536 pp., index, $2.25 net

The word Household is used as an extension rather than a limitation of the
title. In a thoroughly scientific manner the authors treat the subject-matter
of general as well as of household bacteriology and include, therefore, the
true bacteria as well as the yeasts, molds, and protozoa. The volume is,
therefore, a general textbook of micro-biology in which special attention is
given to those problems which are of particular interest to the student of
household science. The main divisions of the book treat (1) the micro-organisms
themselves, (2) fermentations with special reference to those
affecting foods, (3) the relations of bacteria and other micro-organisms to
health. A fully illustrated key (comprising 37 pages) to the families and
genera of common molds, supplements the unusually extended discussion of
the morphology and classification of yeasts and molds, and makes possible
the satisfactory identification of all forms ordinarily encountered by the
student. The work embodies the results of the most recent researches. The
book is exceptionally well written, the different topics are treated consistently
and with a good sense of proportion. While concise in statement, it
is thorough in method and scope. It is, therefore, well adapted for use as a
text not only
for students of household science
, but
also
for those to whom it is
desired to present the science of bacteriology from
an economic and sanitary
rather than from a strictly medical point of view
.

âThe book is a concisely written work on micro-biology, a branch of
economic science that the public is beginning gradually to understand, has
important relationship to the total welfare and prosperity of the community....
The manual can be recommended as a very good elementary bacteriology.
It comprises about all there is of practical domestic value.ââ

Advertiser.

A Laboratory Guide to the Study of
Parasitology

By
W. B. HERMS
University of California, Berkeley, California;
Author of âMalaria: Cause and Controlâ

Cloth, 8vo, xv + 72 pages, 80 cents net

Part IâMedical Entomology

Part IIâHelminthology

Part IIIâLife History Studies on Living Parasites

With the rapid growth of parasitology there is also a
growing demand for laboratory instruction in this field.
The authorâs greatest desire during the time that he has
been engaged in teaching this subject has been to place
the work upon a good systematic footing, giving it
proper rank with other phases of applied biology. The
exercises in this volume are based upon two standard
courses given at the University of California during the
last four years. These courses are Human Parasitology
(first half-year) and Veterinary Parasitology (second
half-year). Each exercise has had careful testing in
the laboratory and is practical.

The aim of this guide is to give the student a wide,
practical view of the field, so that he may have a fair
grasp of the general subject in its application to the
health and well-being of man and beast. The exercises
are in sufficient detail to enable the student to continue
work on some specific group or species if he so chooses.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenbergâ¢ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢

Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢âs
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundationâs EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your stateâs laws.

The Foundationâs business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundationâs website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

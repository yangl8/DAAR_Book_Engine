TO THE

READER.

This Book was juÅ¿t finiÅ¿hed, and deÅ¿igned for the PreÅ¿s, when the Author, to the great
loÅ¿s of the Learned World, was Å¿eized by a DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e that brought him to his Death.
However he took care in his laÅ¿t Will of its Publication, deÅ¿iring his Brother, to
whom it was writ, to take that Trouble upon him. But he was Å¿o taken up with BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s
and Removals, (as being Secretary in
Holland
to the King of
Great Britain
) that he could find no time for it till a Year after the Death of the Author: When
it Å¿o fell out, that the Printers being Å¿omewhat tardy, and this Gentleman dying,
the Book was left without either Father or Guardian. Yet it
[

now ventures into the Publick, in the Å¿ame Method that it was writ by the Author,
and with the Å¿ame InÅ¿cription to his Brother, thoâ dead; in confidence that this laÅ¿t
Piece of his will meet with as kind a Reception from the World as all the other Works
of that Author have. âTis true there are not every where Mathematical DemonÅ¿trations;
but where they are wanting, you have probable and ingenious Conjectures, which is
the moÅ¿t that can be reaÅ¿onably expected in Å¿uch matters. What belongs to, or has
any thing to do with AÅ¿tronomy, you will Å¿ee demonÅ¿trated, and the reÅ¿t ingeniouÅ¿ly
and Å¿hrewdly gueÅ¿sâd at, from the Affinity and Relation of the heavenly Bodies to
the Earth. For your farther Satisfaction read on, and farewel.

THE

PUBLISHER

TO THE

READER.

I Doubt not but I Å¿hall incur the CenÅ¿ures of learned Men for putting this Book into
EngliÅ¿h,
becauÅ¿e, theyâll Å¿ay, it renders PhiloÅ¿ophy cheap and vulgar, and, which is worÅ¿e,
furniÅ¿hes a Å¿ort of injudicious People with a Å¿mattering of Notions, which being not
able to make a proper uÅ¿e of, they pervert to the Injury of Religion and Science.
I confeÅ¿s the Allegation is too true: but after BiÅ¿hop
Wilkins,
Dr.
Burnet,
Mr.
WhiÅ¿ton
and others, to Å¿ay nothing of the ancient PhiloÅ¿ophers, who wrote in their own
[
vi
]
Tongues; I Å¿ay, after theÅ¿e great Authors have treated on as learned and abÅ¿truÅ¿e
Subjects in the Å¿ame Language, I hope their Example will be allowed a Å¿ufficient excuÅ¿e
for printing this Book in
EngliÅ¿h.

Concerning this Edition I can Å¿ay, that I have taken care to have the Cutts exactly
done, and have placed each Figure at the Page of the Book that refers to it, which
I take to be more convenient to the Reader than putting them all at the End.

I have been careful to procure the beÅ¿t Paper, that I might in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure come up
to the Beauty of the Latin Edition, though this bear but half the Price of it.

And I hope the TranÅ¿lator has expreÅ¿Å¿ed the Authorâs SenÅ¿e aright, and has not committed
Faults beyond what an ingenuous Reader can pardon.

BOOK the FirÅ¿t.

A Man that is of
Copernicus
âs Opinion, that this Earth of ours is a Planet, carryâd round and enlightenâd by
the Sun, like the reÅ¿t of the Planets, cannot but Å¿ometimes think, that itâs
[
2
]
not improbable that the reÅ¿t of the Planets have their DreÅ¿s and Furniture, and perhaps
their Inhabitants too as well as this Earth of ours: EÅ¿pecially if he conÅ¿iders the
later DiÅ¿coveries made in the Heavens Å¿ince
Copernicus
âs time,
viz.
the Attendants of
Jupiter
and
Saturn
, and the champaign and hilly Countries in the Moon, which are a Å¿trong Argument of
a Relation and Kin between our Earth and them, as well as a Proof of the Truth of
that SyÅ¿tem. This has often been our Talk, I remember, good Brother, over a large
TeleÅ¿cope, when we have been viewing thoÅ¿e Bodies, a Study that your continual BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s
and AbÅ¿ence have interrupted for many Years. But we were always apt to conclude, that
âtwas in vain to enquire after what Nature is doing there, Å¿eeing there was no likelihood
of ever coming to any Certainty of the Enquiry. Nor could I ever find that any PhiloÅ¿ophers,
either antient or modern, have attempted any thing upon this Subject. At the very
Birth
[
3
]
of AÅ¿tronomy, when the Earth was firÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿erted to be Spherical, and to
Some have already talkâd of the Inhabitants of the Planets, but went no farther.
be Å¿urrounded with Air, even then there were Å¿ome Men Å¿o bold as to affirm, there
were an innumerable Company of Worlds in the Stars. But later Authors, Å¿uch as Cardinal

CuÅ¿anus
,
Brunus
,
Kepler
, (and if we may believe him,
Tycho
was of that opinion too) have furniÅ¿hed the Planets with Inhabitants. Nay,
CuÅ¿anus
and
Brunus
have allowed the Sun and fixed Stars theirs too. But this was the utmoÅ¿t of their
BoldneÅ¿s; nor has the ingenious
French
Author of the Dialogues about
the Plurality of Worlds
carried this Matter any farther. Only Å¿ome of them have coined Å¿ome Stories of the
Men in the Moon, juÅ¿t as probable as
Lucian
âs true HiÅ¿tory; among which I muÅ¿t count
Kepler
âs, which he has diverted us with in his AÅ¿tronomical Dream. But a while ago thinking
Å¿omewhat Å¿eriouÅ¿ly of this matter (not that I count my Å¿elf quicker-Å¿ighted than thoÅ¿e
great Men, but that I had the HappineÅ¿s to live after
[
4
]
moÅ¿t of them) the Enquiry appeared not Å¿o impracticable, nor the Way Å¿o Å¿topt up with
Difficulties, but that there was very good room left for probable Conjectures. As
they came into my Head, I put them down into common Places, and Å¿hall now try to digeÅ¿t
them into Å¿ome Method for your better Conception of them, and add Å¿omewhat of the
Sun and fixâd Stars, and the Extent of that UniverÅ¿e of which our Earth is but an
inconÅ¿iderable Point. I know you have Å¿uch an EÅ¿teem and Reverence for any thing that
belongs to the Heavens, that I perÅ¿wade my Å¿elf you will read what I have written
with Å¿ome PleaÅ¿ure: Iâm Å¿ure I writ it with a great deal; but as often before, Å¿o
now, I find the Saying of
Archytas
true, even to the Letter,
That thoâ a Man were admitted into Heaven to view the wonderful Fabrick of the World,
and the Beauty of the Stars, yet what would otherwiÅ¿e be Rapture and ExtaÅ¿ie, would
be but a melancholy Amazement if he had not a Friend to communicate
[
5
]
it to
. I could wiÅ¿h indeed that all the World might not be my Judges, but that I might
chuÅ¿e my Readers, Men like you, not ignorant in AÅ¿tronomy and true PhiloÅ¿ophy; for
with Å¿uch I might promiÅ¿e my Å¿elf a favourable hearing, and not need to make an Apology
for daring to vent any thing new to the World. But becauÅ¿e I am aware what weak Hands
itâs likely to fall into, and what a Å¿evere Sentence I may expect from thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e
Ignorance or Zeal is too great; it may be worth the while to guard my Å¿elf beforehand
againÅ¿t the AÅ¿Å¿aults of thoÅ¿e Å¿ort of People.

The Objections of ignorant Cavillers prevented.
Thereâs one Å¿ort who knowing nothing of Geometry or Mathematicks, will laugh at it
as a whimÅ¿ical and ridiculous Undertaking. Itâs an incredible Thing to them to talk
of meaÅ¿uring the DiÅ¿tance and Magnitude of the Stars: And for the Motion of the Earth,
they count it, if not a falÅ¿e, at leaÅ¿t a precarious Opinion; and no wonder then if
they take whatâs built upon Å¿uch a Å¿lippery Foundation
[
6
]
for the Dreams of a fanciful Head and a diÅ¿temperâd Brain. What Å¿hould we anÅ¿wer to
theÅ¿e Men, but that their Ignorance is the CauÅ¿e of their DiÅ¿like, and that if they
had Å¿tudied theÅ¿e things more, and viewed the Works of Nature nicely, they would have
fewer Scruples? But few People having had an opportunity of proÅ¿ecuting theÅ¿e Studies,
either for want of Parts, Learning or LeiÅ¿ure, we cannot blame their Ignorance; and
if they reÅ¿olve to find fault with us for Å¿pending time in Å¿uch Matters, becauÅ¿e they
do not underÅ¿tand the UÅ¿e of them, we muÅ¿t appeal to properer Judges.

TheÅ¿e Conjectures do not contradict the holy Scriptures.
The other Å¿ort, When they hear us talk of new Lands, and Animals, and Creatures endued
with as much ReaÅ¿on as themÅ¿elves, will be ready to cry out, that we Å¿et up our Conjectures
againÅ¿t the Word of God, and broach Opinions directly oppoÅ¿ite to Holy Writ. For we
do not there read any thing of the Production of Å¿uch Creatures, no not Å¿o much as
that they exiÅ¿t; nay rather we
[
7
]
read the quite contrary. For, That only mentions this Earth with its Animals and Plants,
and Man the Lord of them: To Å¿uch PerÅ¿ons I anÅ¿wer, what has been often urged by others
before me: That itâs evident, God had no deÅ¿ign to make a particular Enumeration in
the Holy Scriptures, of all the Works of his Creation. When therefore it is plain
that under the general Name of
Stars
or
Earth
at the Creation, are comprehended all the Heavenly Bodies, even the Attendants upon

Jupiter
and
Saturn
, why muÅ¿t all that Multitude of Beings which the Almighty Creator has been pleaÅ¿ed
to place upon them, be excluded the Privilege, and not Å¿uffered to have a Share in
the ExpreÅ¿Å¿ion? And theÅ¿e Men themÅ¿elves canât but know in what SenÅ¿e it is that all
things are Å¿aid to be made for the UÅ¿e of Man, not certainly for us to look at through
a TeleÅ¿cope, for thatâs very abÅ¿urd. Since then the greateÅ¿t part of Godâs Creation,
that innumerable multitude of Stars, is placed out of the
[
8
]
reach of any Manâs Eye; and many of them itâs likely, of the beÅ¿t GlaÅ¿Å¿es, Å¿o that
they donât Å¿eem to belong to us; is it Å¿uch an unreaÅ¿onable Opinion to think, that
there are Å¿ome reaÅ¿onable Creatures who Å¿ee and admire thoÅ¿e glorious Bodies at a
nearer diÅ¿tance?

This Enquiry not over curious.
But perhaps theyâll Å¿ay, it does not become us to be Å¿o curious and inquiÅ¿itive in
theÅ¿e Things which the Supreme Creator Å¿eems to have kept for his own Knowledge: For
Å¿ince he has not been pleaÅ¿ed to make any farther DiÅ¿covery or Revelation of them,
it Å¿eems little better than preÅ¿umption to make any inquiry into that which he has
thought fit to hide. But theÅ¿e Gentlemen muÅ¿t be told, that they take too much upon
themÅ¿elves when they pretend to appoint how far and no farther Men Å¿hall go in their
Searches, and to Å¿et bounds to other Mens InduÅ¿try; as if they knew the Marks that
God has placed to Knowledge: or as if Men were able to paÅ¿s thoÅ¿e Marks. If our Forefathers
had been at this rate Å¿crupulous, we might
[
9
]
have been ignorant Å¿till of the Magnitude and Figure of the Earth, or that there was
Å¿uch a Place as
America
. We Å¿hould not have known that the Moon is inlightned by the Sunâs Rays, nor what
the CauÅ¿es of the EclipÅ¿es of each of them are, nor a multitude of other Things brought
to light by the late DiÅ¿coveries in AÅ¿tronomy. For what can a Man imagine more abÅ¿truÅ¿e,
or leÅ¿s likely to be known, than what is now as clear as the Sun? Whence it follows,
that vigorous InduÅ¿try, and piercing Wit were given Men to make Advances in the Search
of Nature, and thereâs no ReaÅ¿on to put any Stop to Å¿uch Enquiries. I muÅ¿t acknowledge
that what I here intend to treat of is not of that Nature as to admit of a certain
Knowledge; I canât pretend to aÅ¿Å¿ert any thing as poÅ¿itively true (for how is it poÅ¿Å¿ible)
but only to advance a probable GueÅ¿s, the Truth of which every one is at his own liberty
to examine. If any one therefore Å¿hall gravely tell me, that I have Å¿pent my Time
idly in a vain and fruitleÅ¿s Enquiry
[
10
]
after what by my own acknowledgment I can never come to be Å¿ure of; The AnÅ¿wer is,
that at this rate he would put down all Natural PhiloÅ¿ophy as far as it concerns it
Å¿elf in Å¿earching into the Nature

of Things: In Å¿uch noble and Å¿ublime Studies as theÅ¿e, âtis a Glory to arrive at
Probability, and the Search it Å¿elf rewards the Pains. But there are many degrees
of Probable, Å¿ome nearer Truth than others, in the determining of which lies the chief

of our Judgment. But beÅ¿ides the NobleneÅ¿s and PleaÅ¿ure of the Studies, may not we
be Å¿o bold as to Å¿ay, they are no Å¿mall help to the Advancement of WiÅ¿dom and Morality?
Å¿o far are they from being of no uÅ¿e at all. For here we may mount from this dull
Earth, and viewing it from on high, conÅ¿ider whether Nature has laid out all her CoÅ¿t
and Finery upon this Å¿mall Speck of Dirt. So, like Travellers into other diÅ¿tant Countries,
we Å¿hall be better able to judge of whatâs done at home, know how to make a true EÅ¿timate
of, and Å¿et

]
its own Value upon every Thing. We Å¿hall be leÅ¿s apt to admire what this World calls
Great, Å¿hall nobly deÅ¿piÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Trifles the generality of Men Å¿et their Affections
on, when we know that there are a multitude of Å¿uch Earths inhabited and adorned as
well as our own. And we Å¿hall worÅ¿hip and reverence that God the Maker of all theÅ¿e
things; we Å¿hall admire and adore his Providence and wonderful WiÅ¿dom which is diÅ¿played
and manifeÅ¿ted all over the UniverÅ¿e, to the ConfuÅ¿ion of thoÅ¿e who would have the
Earth and all things formed by the Å¿huffling ConcourÅ¿e of Atoms, or to be without
beginning. But to come to our PurpoÅ¿e.

Copernicus
âs SyÅ¿tem explained
.
And now becauÅ¿e the chief Argument for the Proof of what we intend will be taken
from the DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the Planets, among which without doubt, the Earth muÅ¿t be
counted in the Copernican SyÅ¿tem, I Å¿hall here firÅ¿t of all draw two Figures. The
firÅ¿t is a DeÅ¿cription of
[
12
]
the Orbs the Planets move in, in that order that they are placed round the Sun, drawn
as near as can be in their true Proportions, like what you have Å¿een in my Clock at
home. The Å¿econd Å¿hows the Proportions of their Magnitudes in reÅ¿pect of one another
and of the Sun, which you know is upon that Å¿ame Clock of mine too. In the firÅ¿t the
middle Point or Center is the Place of the Sun, round which, in an order that every
one knows, are the Orbits of
Mercury
,
Venus
, the Earth with that of the Moon about it; then thoÅ¿e of
Mars
,
Jupiter
and
Saturn
: and about the two laÅ¿t the Å¿mall Circles that their Attendants move in: about
Jupiter
four, and about
Saturn
five. Which Circles as well as that of the Moon are drawn larger than their true
Proportion would admit, otherwiÅ¿e they could not have been Å¿een. You may eaÅ¿ily apprehend
the VaÅ¿tneÅ¿s of theÅ¿e Orbits by this, that the diÅ¿tance of the Earth from the Sun
is ten or twelve thouÅ¿and of the Earthâs Diameters. AlmoÅ¿t all theÅ¿e Circles are in
the Å¿ame Plane, declining very
[
13
]
little from that in which the Earth moves, callâd
The Plane of the Ecliptick
. This Plane is cut obliquely by the Axis upon which the Earth turns it Å¿elf round
with reÅ¿pect to the Sun in 24 Hours, whence ariÅ¿e the SucceÅ¿Å¿ions of Day and Night:
The Axis of the Earth always keeping the Å¿ame Inclination to the Ecliptick (except
a Å¿mall Change beÅ¿t known to AÅ¿tronomers) while the Earth itÅ¿elf is carried in its
yearly CourÅ¿e round the Sun, cauÅ¿es the regular Order of the SeaÅ¿ons of the Year:
as you may Å¿ee in all AÅ¿tronomers Books. Out of which I Å¿hall tranÅ¿cribe hither the
Periods of the Revolutions of the Planets,
viz. Saturn
moves round the Sun in 29 Years, 174 Days, and 5 Hours:
Jupiter
finiÅ¿hes his CourÅ¿e in 11 Years, 317 Days, and 15 Hours:
Mars
his in about 687 Days. Our Year is 365 Days 6 Hours:
Venus
âs 224 Days 18 Hours: and
Mercury
âs 88 Days. This is the now commonly received SyÅ¿tem, invented by
Copernicus
, and very agreeable to that frugal Simplicity Nature Å¿hows in all
[
14
]
Arguments for the Truth onât.
her Works. If any one is reÅ¿olved to find fault with it, let him firÅ¿t be Å¿ure he
underÅ¿tands it. Let him firÅ¿t Å¿ee in the Books of AÅ¿tronomers with how much greater
EaÅ¿e and PlainneÅ¿s all the Motions of the Stars, and Appearances in the Heavens are
explained and demonÅ¿trated in this than either in that of
Ptolomy
or
Tycho
. Let him conÅ¿ider that DiÅ¿covery of
Kepler
, that the DiÅ¿tances of the Planets from the Sun, as well of the Earth as the reÅ¿t,
are in a fixâd certain proportion to the Times they Å¿pend in their Revolutions. Which
Proportion itâs Å¿ince obÅ¿erved that their Satellites keep round
Jupiter
and
Saturn
. Let him examine what a contradictory Motion they are fain to invent for the Solution
of the Polar Starâs changing its DiÅ¿tance from the Pole. For that Star in the end
of the little Bearâs Tail which now deÅ¿cribes Å¿o Å¿mall a Circle round the Pole, that
it is not above two Degrees and twenty Minutes, was obÅ¿erved about 1820 Years ago,
in the Time of
Hipparchus
, to be above 12:
[
15
]
and will within a few Ages more be 45 Degrees diÅ¿tant from it: and after 25000 Years
more will return to the Å¿ame Place it is now in. Now if with them we allow the Heavens
to be turned upon their own Axis, at this rate they muÅ¿t have a new Axis every Day:
a Thing moÅ¿t abÅ¿urd, and repugnant to the Nature of all Motion. Whereas nothing is
eaÅ¿ier with
Copernicus
than to give us Satisfaction in this Matter. Then he may impartially weigh thoÅ¿e
AnÅ¿wers that
GalilÃ¦us
,
GaÅ¿Å¿endus
,
Kepler
, and others have given to all Objections propoÅ¿ed, which have Å¿o Å¿atisfied all Scruples,
that generally all AÅ¿tronomers now-a-days are brought over to our Side, and allow
the Earth its Motion and Place among the Planets. If he cannot be Å¿atisfied with all
this, he is either one whoÅ¿e DulneÅ¿s canât comprehend it, or who has his Belief at
another Manâs DiÅ¿poÅ¿al.

In the other Figure you have the Globes of the Planets, and of the Sun, repreÅ¿ented
to your Eyes as placed near one another. Where
[
16
]
The Proportion of the Magnitude of the Planets, in reÅ¿pect of one another, and the
Sun.
I have obÅ¿erved the Å¿ame Proportion, of their Diameters to that of the Sun, that
I publiÅ¿hed to the World in my Book of
The Appearances of Saturn
: namely, the Diameter of the Ring round
Saturn
is to that of the Sun as 11 as to 37; that of
Saturn
himÅ¿elf about as 5 to 37; that of
Jupiter
as 2 to 11; that of
Mars
as 1 to 166; of the Earth as 1 to 111; and of
Venus
as 1 to 84: to which I Å¿hall now add that of
Mercury
obÅ¿erved by
Hevelius
in the Year 1661, but calculated by my Å¿elf, and found to be as 1 to 290.

If you would know the way that we came to this Knowledge of their Magnitudes, by knowing
the Proportion of their DiÅ¿tances from the Sun, and the MeaÅ¿ures of their Diameters,
you may find it in the Book before-mentioned: And I cannot yet Å¿ee any ReaÅ¿on to make
an Alteration in thoÅ¿e I then Å¿ettled, althoâ I will not Å¿ay they are without their
Faults.
The
LamellÃ¦
more convenient than Micrometers.
For I canât yet be of their Mind, who think the UÅ¿e of Micrometers, as they call
them, is beyond that of
[
17
]
our Plates, but muÅ¿t Å¿till think that thoÅ¿e thin Plates or Rods of which I there taught
the UÅ¿e, not to detract from the due PraiÅ¿es of Å¿o uÅ¿eful an Invention, are more convenient
than the Micrometers.

In this proportion of the Planets it is worth while to take notice of the prodigious
Magnitude of the Sun in compariÅ¿on with the four innermoÅ¿t, which are far leÅ¿s than

Jupiter
and
Saturn
. And âtis remarkable, that the Bodies of the Planets do not increaÅ¿e together with
their DiÅ¿tances from the Sun, but that
Venus
is much bigger than
Mars
.

The Earth juÅ¿tly likened to the Planets, and the Planets to it.
Having thus explained the two Schemes, thereâs no Body I Å¿uppoÅ¿e but Å¿ees, that in
the firÅ¿t the Earth is made to be of the Å¿ame Å¿ort with the reÅ¿t of the Planets. For
the very PoÅ¿ition of the Circles Å¿hows it. And that the other Planets are round like
it, and like it receive all the Light they have from the Sun, thereâs no room (Å¿ince
the DiÅ¿coveries made by TeleÅ¿copes) to doubt. Another Thing they are like it in is,
that they are moved
[
18
]
round their own Axis; for Å¿ince âtis certain that
Jupiter
and
Saturn
are, who can doubt it of the others? Again, as the Earth has its Moon moving round
it, Å¿o
Jupiter
and
Saturn
have theirs. Now Å¿ince in Å¿o many Things they thus agree, what can be more probable
than that in others they agree too; and that the other Planets are as beautiful and
as well Å¿tockâd with Inhabitants as the Earth? Or what Å¿hadow of ReaÅ¿on can there
be why they Å¿hould not?

If any one Å¿hould be at the DiÅ¿Å¿ection of a Dog, and be there Å¿hewn the Intrails,
the Heart, Stomach, Liver, Lungs and Guts, all the Veins, Arteries and Nerves; could
Å¿uch a Man reaÅ¿onably doubt whether there were the Å¿ame Contexture and Variety of
Parts in a Bullock, Hog, or any other BeaÅ¿t, thoâ he had never chancâd to Å¿ee the
like opening of them? I donât believe he would. Or were we thoroughly Å¿atisfyâd in
the Nature of one of the Moons round
Jupiter
, Å¿hould not we Å¿traight conclude the Å¿ame of the reÅ¿t of them? So if we could be

[
19
]
aÅ¿Å¿urâd in but one Comet, what it was that is the CauÅ¿e of that Å¿trange Appearance,
Å¿hould we not make that a Standard to judge of all others by?
Arguments from their Similitude, of no Å¿mall weight.
âTis therefore an Argument of no Å¿mall Weight that is fetchâd from Relation and LikeneÅ¿s;
and to reaÅ¿on from what we Å¿ee and are Å¿ure of, to what we cannot, is no falÅ¿e Logick.
This muÅ¿t be our Method in this TreatiÅ¿e, wherein from the Nature and CircumÅ¿tances
of that Planet which we Å¿ee before our Eyes, we may gueÅ¿s at thoÅ¿e that are farther
diÅ¿tant from us.

The Planets are Å¿olid, and not without Gravity.
And, FirÅ¿t, âtis more than probable that the Bodies of the Planets are Å¿olid like
that of our Earth, and that they donât want what we call Gravity, that Virtue, which
like a LoadÅ¿tone attracts whatÅ¿oever is near the Body to its Center. And that they
have Å¿uch a Quality, their very Figure is a Proof; for their RoundneÅ¿s proceeds only
from an equal preÅ¿Å¿ure of all their Parts tending to the Å¿ame Center. Nay more, we
are Å¿o skilful now-a-days, as to be able to tell how
[
20
]
much more or leÅ¿s the Gravitation in
Jupiter
or
Saturn
is than here; of which DiÅ¿covery and its Author you may read my
EÅ¿Å¿ay of the CauÅ¿es of
Gravitation
.

But now to carry the Search farther, let us Å¿ee by what Steps we muÅ¿t riÅ¿e to the
attaining Å¿ome knowledge in the deeper Secrets concerning the State and Furniture
of theÅ¿e new Earths. And, firÅ¿t, how likely is it that they may be Å¿tockâd with Plants

Have Animals and Plants.
and Animals as well as we? I Å¿uppoÅ¿e no Body will deny but that thereâs Å¿omewhat
more of Contrivance, Å¿omewhat more wonderful in the Production and Growth of Plants
and Animals, than in LifeleÅ¿s Heaps of inanimate Bodies, be they never Å¿o much larger;
as Mountains, Rocks, or Seas are. For the Finger of God, and the WiÅ¿dom of Divine
Providence, is in them much more clearly manifeÅ¿ted than in the other. One of
Democritus
âs or
Cartes
âs
Scholars may venture perhaps to give Å¿ome tolerable Explication of the Appearances
in Heaven and Earth, allow him but his Atoms
[
21
]
and Motion; but when he comes to Plants and Animals, heâll find himÅ¿elf non-plusâd,
and give you no likely account of their Production. For every Thing in them is Å¿o
exactly adapted to Å¿ome DeÅ¿ign, every part of them Å¿o fitted to its proper UÅ¿e, that
they manifeÅ¿t an Infinite WiÅ¿dom, and exquiÅ¿ite Knowledge in the Laws of Nature and
Geometry, as, to omit thoÅ¿e Wonders in Generation, we Å¿hall by and by Å¿how; and make
it an AbÅ¿urdity even to think of their being thus happily jumbled together by a chance
Motion of I donât know what little Particles. Now Å¿hould we allow the Planets nothing
but vaÅ¿t DeÅ¿erts, lifeleÅ¿s and inanimate Stocks and Stones, and deprive them of all
thoÅ¿e Creatures that more plainly Å¿peak their Divine Architect, we Å¿hould Å¿ink them
below the Earth in Beauty and Dignity; a Thing very unreasonable, as I Å¿aid before.

Well then, we have gainâd the Point thus far, and the Planets may be allowed Å¿ome
Creatures capable of moving themÅ¿elves, not at all inferior
[
22
]
to ours; and theÅ¿e are Animals. And if this be allowed, it almoÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily follows,
that there muÅ¿t be Herbs
Not to be imaginâd too unlike ours.
for Food for them. And as for the Growth and NouriÅ¿hment of all theÅ¿e, âtis no doubt
the Å¿ame with ours, Å¿eeing they have the Å¿ame Sun to warm and enliven them as ours
have.

But perhaps Å¿ome Body may Å¿ay, we conclude too faÅ¿t. They will not deny indeed but
that there may be Plants and Animals on the Surface of the Planets, that deÅ¿erve as
well to be provided for by their Creator as ours do: but why muÅ¿t they be of the Å¿ame
Kind with ours: Nature Å¿eems to love variety in her Works, and may have made them
widely different from ours either in their matter or manner of Growth, in their outward
Shape, or their inward Contexture; Å¿he may have made them Å¿uch as neither our UnderÅ¿tanding
nor Imagination can conceive. Thatâs the Thing we Å¿hall now examine, and whether it
be not more likely that Å¿he has not obÅ¿ervâd Å¿uch a Variety as they talk of. Nature

[
23
]
Å¿eems moÅ¿t commonly, and in moÅ¿t of her Works, to affect Variety, âtis true; But they
Å¿hould conÅ¿ider âtis not the BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s of Men to pretend to Å¿ettle how great this Difference
and Variety muÅ¿t be. Nor does it follow, becauÅ¿e it may be Infinite, and out of our
ComprehenÅ¿ion and Reach, that therefore Things in reality are Å¿o. For Å¿uppoÅ¿e God
Å¿hould have pleaÅ¿ed to have made all Things in the reÅ¿t of the Planets juÅ¿t as he
has here, the Inhabitants of thoÅ¿e Places (if there are any Å¿uch) would admire his
WiÅ¿dom and Contrivance no leÅ¿s than if they were widely different; Å¿eeing they canât
come to know whatâs done in the other Planets. Who doubts but that God, if he had
pleaÅ¿ed, might have made the Animals in
America
and other diÅ¿tant Countries nothing like ours? yet we Å¿ee he has not done it. They
have indeed Å¿ome difference in their Shape, and âtis fit they Å¿hould, to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h
the Plants and Animals of thoÅ¿e Countries from ours, who live on this Å¿ide the Earth;
but even in this Variety there is an Agreement,
[
24
]
an exact CorreÅ¿pondence in Figure and Shape, the Å¿ame ways of Growth, and new Productions,
and of continuing their own Kind. Their Animals have Feet and Wings like ours, and
like ours have Hearts, Lungs, Guts, and the Parts Å¿erving to Generation; whereas all
theÅ¿e Things, as well with them as us, might, if it had pleaÅ¿ed Infinite WiÅ¿dom, have
been orderâd a very different Way. âTis plain then that Nature has not exhibited that
Variety in her Works that Å¿he could, and therefore we muÅ¿t not allow that Weight to
this Argument, as upon the Account of it to make every Thing in the Planets quite
different from what is here. âTis more probable that all the Difference there is between
us and them, Å¿prings from the greater or leÅ¿s diÅ¿tance and influence from that Fountain
of Heat and Life the Sun; which will cauÅ¿e a Difference not Å¿o much in their Form
and Shape, as in their Matter and Contexture.

Planets have Water.
And as for the Matter whereof the Plants and Animals there conÅ¿iÅ¿t, thoâ
[
25
]
it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible ever to come to the Knowledge of its Nature, yet this we may venture
to aÅ¿Å¿ert (there being Å¿carce any Doubt of it) that their Growth and NouriÅ¿hment proceeds
from Å¿ome liquid Principle. For all PhiloÅ¿ophers
agree
that there can be no other way of Nutrition; Å¿ome of the Chief among them having
made Water to be the Original of all Things: For whatÅ¿oeverâs dry and without MoiÅ¿ture,
is without Motion too; and without Motion, itâs impoÅ¿Å¿ible there Å¿hould be any IncreaÅ¿e.
But the Parts of a Liquid being in continual Motion one with another, and inÅ¿inuating
and twiÅ¿ting themÅ¿elves into the Å¿malleÅ¿t Places, are thereby very proper and apt
to add not themÅ¿elves only, but whatÅ¿oever elÅ¿e they may bring along with them, to
the IncreaÅ¿e and Growth of Bodies. Thus we Å¿ee that by the Means of Water the Plants
grow, bloÅ¿Å¿om, and bear Fruit; and by the Addition of that only, Stones grow together
out of Sand. And thereâs no doubt but that Metals, CryÅ¿tals, and Jewels,
[
26
]
have the Å¿ame Method of Production: Thoâ in them there has been no opportunity to
make the Å¿ame ObÅ¿ervation, as well by reaÅ¿on of their Å¿low Advances, as that they
are commonly found far from the Places of their Generation; thrown up I Å¿uppoÅ¿e by
Å¿ome Earthquakes, or ConvulÅ¿ions. That the Planets are not without Water, is made
not improbable by the late ObÅ¿ervations: For about
Jupiter
are obÅ¿erved Å¿ome Spots of a darker Colour than the reÅ¿t of his Body, which by their
continual change Å¿how themÅ¿elves to be Clouds: For the Spots of
Jupiter
which belong to him, and never remove from him, are quite different from theÅ¿e, being
Å¿ometimes for a long time not to be Å¿een for theÅ¿e Clouds; and again, when theÅ¿e diÅ¿appear,
Å¿howing themÅ¿elves. And at the going off of theÅ¿e Clouds, Å¿ome Spots have been taken
notice of in him, much brighter than the reÅ¿t of his Body, which remained but a little
while, and then were hid from our Sight. TheÅ¿e MonÅ¿ieur
CaÅ¿Å¿ini
thinks are only the
[
27
]
Reflection from the Snow that covers the Tops of the Hills in
Jupiter
: But I Å¿hould rather think that it is only the Colour of the Earth, which happens
to be free from thoÅ¿e Clouds that commonly darken it.

Mars
too is found not to be without his dark Spots, by means of which he has been obÅ¿erved
to turn round his own Axis in 24 Hours and 40 Minutes; the Length of his Day: but
whether he has Clouds or no, we have not had the Å¿ame opportunity of obÅ¿erving as
in
Jupiter
, as well becauÅ¿e even when he is neareÅ¿t the Earth, he appears to us much leÅ¿s than

Jupiter
, as that his Light not coming Å¿o far, is Å¿o brisk as to be an Impediment to exact
ObÅ¿ervations: And this ReaÅ¿on is as much Å¿tronger in
Venus
as its Light is. But Å¿ince âtis certain that the Earth and
Jupiter
have their Water and Clouds, there is no ReaÅ¿on why the other Planets
But not juÅ¿t like ours.
Å¿hould be without them. I canât Å¿ay that they are exactly of the Å¿ame nature with
our Water; but that they Å¿hould be liquid their UÅ¿e requires, as their Beauty does
that they Å¿hould be
[
28
]
clear. For this Water of ours, in
Jupiter
or
Saturn
, would be frozen up inÅ¿tantly by reaÅ¿on of the vaÅ¿t diÅ¿tance of the Sun. Every Planet
therefore muÅ¿t have its Waters of Å¿uch a temper, as to be proportioned to its Heat:

Jupiter
âs and
Saturn
âs muÅ¿t be of Å¿uch a Nature as not to be liable to FroÅ¿t; and
Venus
âs and
Mercury
âs of Å¿uch, as not to be eaÅ¿ily evaporated by the Sun. But in all of them, for a continual
Å¿upply of MoiÅ¿ture, whatever Water is drawn up by the Heat of the Sun into Vapours,
muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily return back again thither. And this it cannot do but in Drops, which
are cauÅ¿ed as well there as with us, by their aÅ¿cending into a higher and colder Region
of the Air, out of that which, by reaÅ¿on of the Reflection of the Rays of the Sun
from the Earth, is warmer and more temperate.

Here then we have found in theÅ¿e new Worlds Fields warmâd by the kindly Heat of the
Sun, and waterâd with fruitful Dews and Showers: That there muÅ¿t be Plants in them
as well for Ornament as UÅ¿e, we have Å¿hewn
[
29
]
juÅ¿t now. And what NouriÅ¿hment, what manner of Growth Å¿hall we allow
Plants grow and are nouriÅ¿hed there as they are here.
them? Probably, there can be no better, nay no other, than what we here experience;
by having their Roots faÅ¿tned into the Earth, and imbibing its nouriÅ¿hing Juices by
their tender Fibres. And that they may not be only like Å¿o many bare Heaths, with
nothing but creeping Shrubs and BuÅ¿hes, we may allow them Å¿ome nobler and loftier
Plants, Trees, or Å¿omewhat like them: TheÅ¿e being the greateÅ¿t, and, except Waters,
the only Ornament that Nature has beÅ¿towed upon the Earth. For not to Å¿peak of thoÅ¿e
many uÅ¿es that are made of their Wood, thereâs no one that is ignorant either of their
Beauty or PleaÅ¿antneÅ¿s. Now what way can any one imagine for a continual Production
and SucceÅ¿Å¿ion of theÅ¿e Plants, but their bearing Seed? A Method Å¿o excellent, that
itâs the only one that Nature has here made uÅ¿e of, and Å¿o wonderful, that it Å¿eems
to be deÅ¿igned not for this Earth alone. In fine, thereâs the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on to think
that this Method is obÅ¿erved in thoÅ¿e
[
30
]
diÅ¿tant Countries, as there was of its being followed in the remote Quarters of this
Å¿ame Earth.

The Å¿ame true of their Animals.
âTis much the Å¿ame in Animals as âtis in Plants, as to their manner of NouriÅ¿hment,
and Propagation of their Kind. For Å¿ince all the living Creatures of this Earth, whether
BeaÅ¿ts, Birds, FiÅ¿hes, Worms, or InÅ¿ects, univerÅ¿ally and inviolably follow the Å¿ame
conÅ¿tant and fixâd InÅ¿titution of Nature; all feed on Herbs, or Fruits, or the FleÅ¿h
of other Animals that fed on them: Å¿ince all Generation is performed by the impregnating
of the Eggs, and the Copulation of Male and Female: Why may not the Å¿ame Rule be obÅ¿erved
in the Planetary Worlds? For
âtis certain that the Herbs and Animals that are there would be loÅ¿t, their whole
Species deÅ¿troyed without Å¿ome daily new Productions
: except there be no Å¿uch thing there as Misfortune or Accident: except the Plants
are not like other humid Bodies, but can bear Heat, FroÅ¿t, and Age, without being
dryâd up, killâd or decayâd: except the Animals have Bodies as hard
[
31
]
and durable as Marble; which I think are groÅ¿s AbÅ¿urdities. If we Å¿hould invent Å¿ome
new Way for their coming into the World, and make them drop like Soland GeeÅ¿e from
Trees, how ridiculous would this be to any one that conÅ¿iders the vaÅ¿t Difference
between Wood and FleÅ¿h? Or Å¿uppoÅ¿e we Å¿hould have new ones made every Day out of Å¿ome
Å¿uch fruitful Mud as that of
Nile
, who does not Å¿ee how contrary this is to all thatâs reaÅ¿onable? And that âtis much
more agreeable to the WiÅ¿dom of God, once for all to create of all Å¿orts of Animals,
and diÅ¿tribute them all over the Earth in Å¿uch a wonderful and inconceivable way as
he has, than to be continually obliged to new Productions out of the Earth? And what
miÅ¿erable, what helpleÅ¿s Creatures muÅ¿t theÅ¿e be, when thereâs no one that by his
Duty will be obliged, or by that Å¿trange natural fondneÅ¿s, which God has wiÅ¿ely made
a neceÅ¿Å¿ary Argument for all Animals to take care of their own, will be moved to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t,
nurÅ¿e or educate them?

[
32
]

As for what I have Å¿aid concerning their Propagation, I cannot be Å¿o poÅ¿itive; but
the other Thing, namely, that they have Plants and Animals, I think I have fully proved,

viz.
from hence, that otherwiÅ¿e they would be inferiour to our Earth. And by the Å¿ame
Argument, they muÅ¿t have as great a Variety of both as we have. What this is, will
be beÅ¿t known to him that conÅ¿iders the different Ways our Animals make uÅ¿e of in
moving from one Place to another. Which may be reducâd, I think, to theÅ¿e, either
that they walk upon two Feet or Four; or like InÅ¿ects, upon Six, nay Å¿ometimes Hundreds;
or that they fly in the Air bearing up, and wonderfully Å¿teering themÅ¿elves with their
Wings; or creep upon the Ground without Feet; or by a violent Spring in their Bodies,
or paddling with their Feet, cut themÅ¿elves a Way in the Waters. I donât believe,
nor can I conceive, that there Å¿hould be any other Way than theÅ¿e mentioned. The Animals
then in the Planets muÅ¿t make uÅ¿e of one or more of theÅ¿e, like our amphibious Birds,

[
33
]
which can Å¿wim in Water as well as walk on Land, or fly in the Air; or like our Crocodiles
and Sea-HorÅ¿es, muÅ¿t be Mongrels, between Land and Water. There can no other Method
be imagined but one of theÅ¿e. For where is it poÅ¿Å¿ible for Animals to live, except
upon Å¿uch a Å¿olid Body as our Earth, or a fluid one like the Water, or Å¿till a more
fluid one than that, Å¿uch as our Air is? The Air I confeÅ¿s may be much thicker and
heavier than ours, and Å¿o, without any DiÅ¿advantage to its TranÅ¿parency, be fitter
for the volatile Animals. There may alÅ¿o be many Å¿orts of Fluids ranged over one another
in Rows as it were. The Sea perhaps may have Å¿uch a fluid lying on it, which thoâ
ten times lighter than Water, may be a hundred Times heavier than Air; whoÅ¿e utmoÅ¿t
Extent may not be Å¿o large as to cover the higher Places of their Earth. But thereâs
no ReaÅ¿on to Å¿uÅ¿pect or allow them this, Å¿ince we have no Å¿uch Thing; and if we did,
it would be of no Advantage to them, for that the former Ways of moving would not
be hereby at all increasâd:
[
34
]
But when we come to meddle with the Shape of theÅ¿e Creatures, and conÅ¿ider the incredible
Variety that is even in thoÅ¿e of the different parts of this Earth, and that
America
has Å¿ome which are no where elÅ¿e to be found, I muÅ¿t then confeÅ¿s that I think it
beyond the Force of Imagination to arrive at any knowledge in the Matter, or reach
to Probability concerning the Figures of theÅ¿e Planetary Animals. Althoâ conÅ¿idering
theÅ¿e Ways of Motion we eâen now recounted, they may perhaps be no more different
from ours than ours (thoÅ¿e of ours I mean that are moÅ¿t unlike) are from one another.

If a Man were admitted to a Survey of
Jupiter
or
Venus
, he would no doubt find as great a Number and Variety as he had at home. Let us then,
that we may make as near a GueÅ¿s at, and as reaÅ¿onable a Judgment of the Matter as
we can, conÅ¿ider the many Sorts, and the admirable Difference in the Shapes of our
own Animals; running
Great Variety of Animals in this Earth.
over Å¿ome of the Chief of them (for âtwould be tedious to Å¿et about a general Catalogue)
that are notoriouÅ¿ly
[
35
]
different from one another, either in the Figure or Å¿ome peculiar Property belonging
to them; as they belong to the Land, or the Water, or the Air. Among the BeaÅ¿ts we
may take notice of the great DiÅ¿tance between the HorÅ¿e, the Elephant, the Lion, the
Stag, the Camel, the Hog, the Ape, the Porcupine, the TortoiÅ¿e, the Cameleon: in the
Water, of that between the Whale, and the Sea-Calf, the Skait, the Pike, the Eel,
the Ink-FiÅ¿h, the Pourcontrel, the Crocodile, the Flying-fiÅ¿h, the Cramp-fiÅ¿h, the
Crab, the OiÅ¿ter, and the Purple-FiÅ¿h: and among Birds, of that between the Eagle,
the OÅ¿trich, the Peacock, the Swan, the Owl, and the Bat: and in InÅ¿ects, of that
between the Ants, the Spider, the Fly, and the Butterfly; and of that Prodigy in their
wonderful change from Worms. In this Roll I have paÅ¿sâd by the creeping Kind as one
Sort, and skipâd over that vaÅ¿t Multitude of leÅ¿s different Animals that fill the
intermediate Spaces. But be they never Å¿o many, there is no
And no leÅ¿s in the Planets.
reaÅ¿on to think that the Planets cannot match them. For thoâ we in vain gueÅ¿s
[
36
]
at the Figures of thoÅ¿e Creatures, yet we have diÅ¿coverâd Å¿omewhat of their manner
of Life in general; and of their SenÅ¿es we Å¿hall Å¿peak more by and by.

The Å¿ame in Plants.
The more conÅ¿iderable Differences in our Plants ought to be thought on, as well as
the other. As in Trees, that between the Fir and the Oak, the Palm, the Vine, the
Fig, and the Coco-Nut Tree, and that in the
Indies
, from whoÅ¿e Boughs new Roots Å¿pring, and grow downwards into the Earth. In Herbs,
the Difference is notable between GraÅ¿s, Poppy, Colewort, Ivy, Pompions, and the Indian
Fig with thick Leaves growing up without any Stalk, and Aloe. Between every one of
which again there are many leÅ¿s differing Plants not taken notice of. Then the different
Ways of raiÅ¿ing them are remarkable, whether from Seeds, or Kernels, or Roots, or
by grafting or inoculating them. And yet in all theÅ¿e, whether we conÅ¿ider the Things
themÅ¿elves, or the Ways of their Production, I make no doubt but that the Planetary
Worlds have as wonderful a Variety as we.

[
37
]

But Å¿till the main and moÅ¿t agreeable Point of the Enquiry is behind,
Rational Animals in the Planets.
which is the placing Å¿ome Spectators in theÅ¿e new DiÅ¿coveries, to enjoy theÅ¿e Creatures
we have planted them with, and to admire their Beauty and Variety. And among all,
that have never Å¿o Å¿lightly meddled with theÅ¿e Matters, I donât find any that have
Å¿crupled to allow them their Inhabitants: not Men perhaps like ours, but Å¿ome Creatures
or other endued with ReaÅ¿on. For all this Furniture and Beauty the Planets are Å¿tockâd
with Å¿eem to have been made in vain, without any DeÅ¿ign or End, unleÅ¿s there were
Å¿ome in them that might at the Å¿ame time enjoy the Fruits, and adore the wiÅ¿e Creator
of them. But this alone would be no
prevailing
Argument with me to allow them Å¿uch Creatures. For what if we Å¿hould Å¿ay, that God
made them for no other DeÅ¿ign, but that he himÅ¿elf might Å¿ee (not as we do âtis true;
but that he that made the Eye Å¿ees, who can doubt?) and delight himÅ¿elf in the Contemplation
of them? For was not
[
38
]
Man himÅ¿elf, and all that the whole World contains, made upon this very account? That
which makes me of this Opinion, that thoÅ¿e Worlds are not without Å¿uch a Creature
endued with ReaÅ¿on, is, that otherwiÅ¿e our Earth would have too much the Advantage
of them, in being the only part of the UniverÅ¿e that could boaÅ¿t of Å¿uch a Creature
Å¿o far above, not only Plants and Trees, but all Animals whatÅ¿oever: a Creature that
has Å¿omething Divine in him, that knows, and underÅ¿tands, and remembers Å¿uch an innumerable
number of Things; that deliberates, weighs and judges of the Truth: A Creature upon
whoÅ¿e Account, and for whoÅ¿e UÅ¿e, whatÅ¿oever the Earth brings forth Å¿eems to be provided.
For every Thing here he converts to his own Ends. With the Trees, Stones, and Metals,
he builds himÅ¿elf HouÅ¿es: the Birds and FiÅ¿hes he Å¿uÅ¿tains himÅ¿elf with: and the Water
and Winds he makes Å¿ubÅ¿ervient to his Navigation, as he doth the Å¿weet Smell and glorious
Colours of the Flowers to his Delight. What can there be
[
39
]
in the Planets that can make up for its Defects in the want of Å¿o noble an Animal?
If we Å¿hould allow
Jupiter
a greater Variety of other Creatures, more Trees, Herbs and Metals, all theÅ¿e would
not advantage or dignify that Planet Å¿o much as that one Animal doth ours by the admirable
Productions of his penetrating Wit. If I am miÅ¿taken in this, I do not know when to
truÅ¿t my ReaÅ¿on, and muÅ¿t allow my Å¿elf to be but a poor Judge in the true EÅ¿timate
of Things.

Vices of Men no hindrance to their being the Glory of the Planet they inhabit.
Nor let any one Å¿ay here, that thereâs Å¿o much Villany and WickedneÅ¿s in Man that
we have thus magnified, that itâs a reaÅ¿onable Doubt, whether he would not be Å¿o far
from being the Glory and Ornament of the Planet that enjoys his Company, that he would
be rather its Shame and DiÅ¿grace. For firÅ¿t, the Vices that moÅ¿t Men are tainted with,
are no hindrance, but that thoÅ¿e that follow the Dictates of true ReaÅ¿on, and obey
the Rules of a rigid Virtue, are Å¿till a Beauty and Ornament to the Place that has
the HappineÅ¿s to harbour them.
[
40
]
BeÅ¿ides, the Vices of Men themÅ¿elves are of excellent UÅ¿e, and are not permitted and
allowed in the World without wiÅ¿e DeÅ¿ign. For Å¿ince it has Å¿o pleaÅ¿ed God to order
the Earth, and every Thing in it as we Å¿ee it is (for itâs abÅ¿urd to Å¿ay it happenâd
againÅ¿t his Will or Knowledge) we muÅ¿t not think that Å¿o great a DiverÅ¿ity of Minds
were placed in different Men to no End or PurpoÅ¿e: but that this mixture of bad Men
with Good, and the ConÅ¿equents of Å¿uch a Mixture, as Misfortunes, Wars, Afflictions,
Poverty, and the like, were permitted for this very good End,
viz.
the exerciÅ¿ing our Wits, and Å¿harpening our Inventions; by forcing us to provide
for our own neceÅ¿Å¿ary Defence againÅ¿t our Enemies. âTis to the Fear of Poverty and
MiÅ¿ery that we are beholden for all our Arts, and for that natural Knowledge which
was the Product of laborious InduÅ¿try; and which makes us that we cannot but admire
the Power and WiÅ¿dom of the Creator, which otherwiÅ¿e we might have paÅ¿Å¿ed by with
the Å¿ame indifference as BeaÅ¿ts. And if Men
[
41
]
were to lead their whole Lives in an undiÅ¿turbed continual Peace, in no fear of Poverty,
no danger of War, I doubt they would live little better than Brutes, without all knowledge
or enjoyment of thoÅ¿e Advantages that make our Lives paÅ¿s on with PleaÅ¿ure and Profit.
We Å¿hould want the wonderful Art of Writing, if its great UÅ¿e and neceÅ¿Å¿ity in Commerce
and War had not forced out the Invention. âTis to theÅ¿e we owe our Art of Sailing,
our Art of Sowing, and moÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e DiÅ¿coveries of which we are MaÅ¿ters; and almoÅ¿t
all the Secrets in experimental Knowledge. So that thoÅ¿e very Things on account of
which the Faculty of ReaÅ¿on Å¿eems to have been accuÅ¿ed, are no Å¿mall helps to its
Advancement and Perfection. For thoÅ¿e Virtues themÅ¿elves, Fortitude and ConÅ¿tancy,
would be of no uÅ¿e if there were no Dangers, no AdverÅ¿ity, no Afflictions for their
ExerciÅ¿e and Trial.

If we Å¿hould therefore imagine in the Planets Å¿ome Å¿uch reaÅ¿onable Creature as Man
is, adornâd with the Å¿ame
[
42
]
Virtues, and liable to the Å¿ame Vices, it would be Å¿o far from degrading or vilifying
them, that while they want Å¿uch a one, I muÅ¿t think them inferior to our Earth.

ReaÅ¿on
they are
not different from what âtis here.
But if we allow theÅ¿e Planetary Inhabitants Å¿ome Å¿ort of ReaÅ¿on, muÅ¿t it needs, may
Å¿ome Å¿ay, be the Å¿ame with ours? Certainly it muÅ¿t, whether we conÅ¿ider it as applied
to JuÅ¿tice and Morality, or exerciÅ¿ed in the Principles and Foundations of Science.
For ReaÅ¿on with us is that which gives us a true SenÅ¿e of JuÅ¿tice and HoneÅ¿ty, PraiÅ¿e,
KindneÅ¿s and Gratitude: âtis That that teaches us to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h univerÅ¿ally between
Good and Bad; and renders us capable of Knowledge and Experience in it. And can there
be any where any other Sort of ReaÅ¿on than this? or can what we call juÅ¿t and generous,
in
Jupiter
or
Mars
be thought unjuÅ¿t Villany? This is not at all, I donât Å¿ay probable, but poÅ¿Å¿ible.
For the Aim and DeÅ¿ign of the Creator is every where the PreÅ¿ervation and Safety of
his Creatures. Now when Å¿uch ReaÅ¿on as we are MaÅ¿ters
[
43
]
of, is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the preÅ¿ervation of Life, and promoting of Society (a thing that
they are not without, as we Å¿hall Å¿how) would it not be Å¿trange that the Planetary
Inhabitants Å¿hould have Å¿uch a perverÅ¿e Sort of ReaÅ¿on given them, as would neceÅ¿Å¿arily
deÅ¿troy and confound what it was deÅ¿ignâd to maintain and defend? But allowing Morality
and PaÅ¿Å¿ions with thoÅ¿e diÅ¿tant Inhabitants to be Å¿omewhat different from ours, and
Å¿uppoÅ¿ing they may act by other Principles in what belongs to FriendÅ¿hip and Anger,
Hatred, HoneÅ¿ty, ModeÅ¿ty, and ComelineÅ¿s, yet Å¿till there would be no doubt, but that
in the Search after Truth, in judging of the ConÅ¿equences of Things, in ReaÅ¿oning,
particularly in that Sort which belongs to Magnitude or Quantity, about which their
Geometry (if they have Å¿uch a Thing) is employâd, there would be no doubt, I Å¿ay,
but that their ReaÅ¿on here muÅ¿t be exactly the Å¿ame, and go the Å¿ame way to work with
ours, and that whatâs true in one part will hold true over the whole UniverÅ¿e; Å¿o
that all the difference
[
44
]
muÅ¿t lie in the Degrees of Knowledge, which will be proportional to the Genius and
Capacity of the Inhabitants.

They have SenÅ¿es.
But I perceive I am got Å¿omewhat too far: Let us firÅ¿t enquire a little concerning
the bodily SenÅ¿es of theÅ¿e Planetary PerÅ¿ons; for without Å¿uch, neither will Life
be any PleaÅ¿ure to them, nor ReaÅ¿on of any UÅ¿e. And I think it very probable, that
all their Animals, as well their BeaÅ¿ts as rational Creatures, are like ours in all
that relates to the SenÅ¿es: For without the Power of Seeing we Å¿hould find it impoÅ¿Å¿ible
for Animals to provide Food for themÅ¿elves, or be Å¿ore-warnâd of any approaching Danger,
Å¿o as to guard themÅ¿elves from it. So that where-ever we plant any Animals, except
we wouâd have them lead the Life of Worms or Moles, we muÅ¿t allow them Sight; than
which nothing can conduce more either to the PreÅ¿ervation or PleaÅ¿ure of their Lives.
Then if we conÅ¿ider the wonderful Nature of Light, and the
Sight.
amazing Artifice in the fit framing the Eye for the Reception of it, we cannot
[
45

but Å¿ee that Bodies Å¿o vaÅ¿tly remote could not be perceived by us in their proper
Figures and juÅ¿t DiÅ¿tances, any other way than by Sight. For this SenÅ¿e, and all others
that we know of, muÅ¿t proceed from an external Motion. Which in the Å¿enÅ¿e of Seeing
muÅ¿t come either from the Sun, the fixâd Stars, or Fire: whoÅ¿e Particles being put
into a very quick Motion, communicate it to the CeleÅ¿tial Matter about, whence âtis
conveyâd in a very Å¿hort time to the moÅ¿t diÅ¿tant parts, juÅ¿t like Sound through the
Air. If it were not for this Motion of the intermediate Ãtherial Matter, we Å¿hould
be all in DarkneÅ¿s, and have Sight neither of Sun nor Stars, nor any thing elÅ¿e, for
all other Light muÅ¿t come to us by Reflection from them. This Motion perceived by
the Eyes is called Light. And the nice CurioÅ¿ity of this Perception is admirable,
in that it is cauÅ¿ed by the Å¿malleÅ¿t Particles of the luminous Body brought to us
by that fine Matter, which at the Å¿ame time determine the CoaÅ¿t from whence the Motion
comes; and in that all theÅ¿e different Roads of
[

Motion, theÅ¿e Waves croÅ¿Å¿ing and interfering with one another, are yet no hindrance
to every oneâs free PaÅ¿Å¿age. All theÅ¿e Things are Å¿o wiÅ¿ely, Å¿o wonderfully contrived,
that itâs above the Power of humane Wit, to invent or frame any thing like them; nay,
it is very difficult Å¿o much as to imagine and comprehend them. For what can be more
amazing, than that one Å¿mall Part of the Body Å¿hould be Å¿o deviÅ¿ed and framed, as
by its means to Å¿how us the Shape, the PoÅ¿ition, the DiÅ¿tance, and all the Motions,
nay, and all the Colours, of a Body that is far remote from us, that it may appear
the more diÅ¿tinct? And then the artful CompoÅ¿ition of the Eye, drawing an exact Picture
of the Objects without it, upon the concave Side of the Choroides, is even above all
Admiration, nor is there any Thing in which God has more plainly manifeÅ¿ted his excellent
Geometry. And theÅ¿e Things are not only contrivâd and framâd with Å¿o great WiÅ¿dom
and Skill, as not to admit of better, but to any one that conÅ¿iders them attentively,
they Å¿eem to be of Å¿uch a Nature

as not to allow any other Method. For itâs impoÅ¿Å¿ible that Light Å¿hould repreÅ¿ent
Objects to us at Å¿o vaÅ¿t a diÅ¿tance, except by Å¿uch an intervening Motion; and itâs
as impoÅ¿Å¿ible that any other CompoÅ¿ition of the Eye Å¿hould be equally fitted to the
Reception of Å¿uch ImpreÅ¿Å¿ions. So that I cannot but think them greatly miÅ¿taken, that
maintain theÅ¿e Things might have been contrived many other Ways. Itâs likely then,
and credible, that in theÅ¿e Things the Planets have an exact correÅ¿pondence with us,

deprived of the BleÅ¿Å¿ing of Å¿o advantageous Members? For by them we view the various

in the Animals of thoÅ¿e new Worlds. For âtis of great conÅ¿equence in defending us
from Å¿udden Accidents; and, eÅ¿pecially when Seeing is of no uÅ¿e to us, it Å¿upplies
its Place, and gives us Å¿eaÅ¿onable warning of any imminent Danger. BeÅ¿ides, we Å¿ee

the vaÅ¿t UÅ¿es and neceÅ¿Å¿ary OccaÅ¿ions of Speaking on the one Å¿ide, and Hearing on

credible that two Å¿uch uÅ¿eful, Å¿uch

excellent Things were deÅ¿igned only for us. For how is it poÅ¿Å¿ible but that they that
are without theÅ¿e, muÅ¿t be without many other NeceÅ¿Å¿aries and Conveniences of Life?
Or what can they have to recompenÅ¿e this Want? Then, if we go Å¿till farther, and do
but meditate upon the neat and frugal Contrivance of Nature in making the Å¿ame Air,
by the drawing in of which we live, by whoÅ¿e Motion we Å¿ail, and by whoÅ¿e Means Birds

puts it paÅ¿t doubt that they have Air too; that being moÅ¿tly formed of the Particles
of Water flying about, as the Clouds are of them gathered into Å¿mall Drops. And another
Proof of it is, the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of breathing for the preÅ¿ervation of Life, a Thing that
Å¿eems to be as univerÅ¿al a Dictate of Nature, as feeding upon the Fruits of the Earth.

[

Touch.
As for Feeling, it Å¿eems to be given upon neceÅ¿Å¿ity to all Creatures that are coverâd
with a fine and Å¿enÅ¿ible Skin, as a Caution againÅ¿t coming too near thoÅ¿e Things that
may injure or incommode them: and without it they would be liable to continual Wounds,
Blows and BruiÅ¿es. Nature Å¿eems to have been Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible of this, that Å¿he has not
left the leaÅ¿t place free from Å¿uch a Perception. Therefore itâs probable that the
Inhabitants of thoÅ¿e Worlds are not without Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary a Defence, and Å¿o fit a PreÅ¿ervative
againÅ¿t Dangers and MiÅ¿haps.

Smell and TaÅ¿te.
And who is there that doth not Å¿ee the inevitable neceÅ¿Å¿ity for all Creatures that
live by feeding to have both TaÅ¿te and Smell, that they may diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h thoÅ¿e Things
that are good and nouriÅ¿hing, from thoÅ¿e that are miÅ¿chievous and harmful? If therefore
we allow the Planetary Creatures to feed upon Herbs, Seeds, or FleÅ¿h, we muÅ¿t allow
them TaÅ¿te and Smell, that they may chuÅ¿e or refuÅ¿e any Thing according as they find
it likely to be advantageous or noxious to them.

[

I know that it hath been a QueÅ¿tion with many, whether there might not have been more
SenÅ¿es than theÅ¿e five.
Their SenÅ¿es not very different from ours.
If we Å¿hould allow this, it might nevertheleÅ¿s be reaÅ¿onably doubted, whether the
SenÅ¿es of the Planetary Inhabitants are much different from ours. I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s,
I cannot deny but there might poÅ¿Å¿ibly have been more SenÅ¿es; but when I conÅ¿ider
the UÅ¿es of thoÅ¿e we have, I cannot think but they would have been Å¿uperfluous. The
Eye was made to diÅ¿cern near and remote Objects, the Ear to give us notice of what
our Eyes could not, either in the Dark or behind our Back: Then what neither the Eye
nor the Ear could, the NoÅ¿e was made (which in Dogs is wonderfully nice) to warn us
of. And if any thing eÅ¿capes the notice of the other four SenÅ¿es, we have Feeling
to inform us of the too near Approaches of it before it can do us any miÅ¿chief. Thus
has Nature Å¿o plentifully, Å¿o perfectly provided for the neceÅ¿Å¿ary preÅ¿ervation of
her Creatures here, that I think Å¿he can give nothing more to thoÅ¿e there, but what

[
52
]
will be needleÅ¿s and Å¿uperfluous. Yet the SenÅ¿es were not wholly deÅ¿igned for uÅ¿e:
but Men from all, and all other Animals from Å¿ome of them, reap PleaÅ¿ure as well as
Profit, as from the TaÅ¿te in delicious Meats; from the Smell in Flowers and Perfumes;
from the Sight in the Contemplation of beauteous Shapes and Colours; from the Hearing
in the SweetneÅ¿s and Harmony of Sounds; from the Feeling in Copulation, unleÅ¿s you
pleaÅ¿e to count that for a particular SenÅ¿e by it Å¿elf.
They have PleaÅ¿ure ariÅ¿ing from the SenÅ¿es.
Since it is thus, I think âtis but reaÅ¿onable to allow the Inhabitants of the Planets
theÅ¿e Å¿ame Advantages that we have from them. For upon this ConÅ¿ideration only, how
much happier and eaÅ¿ier a Manâs Life is rendred by the enjoyment of them, we muÅ¿t
be obliged to grant them theÅ¿e BleÅ¿Å¿ings, except we would engroÅ¿s every thing that
is good to our Å¿elves, as if we were worthier and more deÅ¿erving than any elÅ¿e. But
moreover, that PleaÅ¿ure which we perceive in Eating or in Copulation, Å¿eems to be
a neceÅ¿Å¿ary and provident Command of Nature,
[
53
]
whereby it tacitly compels us to the preÅ¿ervation and continuance of our Life and
Kind. It is the Å¿ame in BeaÅ¿ts. So that both for their HappineÅ¿s and PreÅ¿ervation
itâs very probable the reÅ¿t of the Planets are not without it. Certainly when I conÅ¿ider
all theÅ¿e Things, how great, noble, and uÅ¿eful they are; when I conÅ¿ider what an admirable
Providence it is that thereâs Å¿uch a Thing as PleaÅ¿ure in the World, I canât but think
that our Earth, the Å¿malleÅ¿t part almoÅ¿t of the UniverÅ¿e, was never deÅ¿ignâd to monopolize
Å¿o great a BleÅ¿Å¿ing. And thus much for thoÅ¿e PleaÅ¿ures which affect our bodily SenÅ¿es,
but have little or no relation to our ReaÅ¿on and Mind. But there are other PleaÅ¿ures
which Men enjoy, which their Soul only and ReaÅ¿on can reliÅ¿h: Some airy and brisk,
others grave and Å¿olid, and yet nevertheleÅ¿s PleaÅ¿ures, as ariÅ¿ing from the Satisfaction
which we feel in Knowledge and Inventions, and Searches after Truth, of which whether
the Planetary Inhabitants are not partakers, we Å¿hall have an opportunity of enquiring
by and by. There

[
54
]

There are Å¿ome other things to be conÅ¿iderâd firÅ¿t, in which itâs probable they have
Å¿ome relation to us. That the Planets have thoÅ¿e Elements of Earth, Air and Water,
as well as we, I have already made not unlikely. Let us now Å¿ee whether they may not
have Fire alÅ¿o: which is not Å¿o properly callâd an Element, as a very quick Motion
of the Particles in the
inflammable

Body. But be it what it will, there are many Arguments for their not being without
it. For this Earth is not Å¿o truly callâd the Place of Fire as the Sun: and as by
the Heat of that all Plants and Animals here thrive and live; Å¿o, no doubt, it is
in the other Planets. Since then Fire is cauÅ¿ed by a moÅ¿t intenÅ¿e and vigorous Heat,
it follows that the Planets, eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e nearer the Fountain of it, have their
proportionate degrees of Heat and Fire. And Å¿ince there are Å¿o many ways of its Production,
as by the collection of the Rays of the Sun, by the reflection of Mirrors, by the
Å¿triking of Flint and Steel, by the rubbing of Wood, by the cloÅ¿e loading of
[
55
]
moiÅ¿t GraÅ¿s, by Lightning, by the eruptions of Mountains and Volcanos, itâs Å¿trange
if neither Art Å¿hould have produced it, nor Nature effected it there by one of theÅ¿e
many means. Then how uÅ¿eful and neceÅ¿Å¿ary is it to us? By it we drive away Cold, and
Å¿upply the want of the Sun in thoÅ¿e Countries where his oblique Rays make a leÅ¿s vigorous
ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion, and Å¿o keep a great part of the Earth from being an uninhabited
DeÅ¿ert
: which is equally neceÅ¿Å¿ary in all the Planets, whether we allow them SucceÅ¿Å¿ion
of SeaÅ¿ons, or a perpetual Spring and Ãquinox: for even then the Countries near the
Pole would receive but little Advantage from the Heat of the Sun. By the help of this
we turn the Night into Day, and thereby make a conÅ¿iderable addition to the Å¿hortneÅ¿s
of our Lives. Upon all theÅ¿e Accounts we ought not to think this Earth of ours enjoy
it all alone, and exclude all the other Planets from Å¿o advantageous and Å¿o profitable
a Gift.

But perhaps it may be asked as well concerning Brutes as rational Creatures,
[
56
]
and of their Plants and Trees too, whether they are proportionably
The bigneÅ¿s of their Creatures not rightly gueÅ¿t at by the bigneÅ¿s of the Planets.
larger or leÅ¿s than ours. For if the Magnitude of the Planets was to be the Standard
of their meaÅ¿ure, there would be Animals in
Jupiter
ten or fifteen times larger than Elephants, and as much longer than our Whales, and
then their Men muÅ¿t be all Giants in reÅ¿pect to us. Now thoâ I donât Å¿ee any Å¿o great
AbÅ¿urdity in this as to make it impoÅ¿Å¿ible, yet there is no reaÅ¿on to think it is
really Å¿o, Å¿eeing Nature has not always tyâd her Å¿elf to thoÅ¿e Rules which we have
thought more convenient for her: For example, the Magnitude of the Planets is not
anÅ¿werable to their diÅ¿tances from the Sun; but
Mars
, thoâ more remote, is far leÅ¿s than
Venus
: and
Jupiter
turns round his Axis in ten Hours, when the Earth which is much leÅ¿s than him, Å¿pends
24. But Å¿ince Nature, perhaps Å¿ome will Å¿ay, has not obÅ¿erved Å¿uch a Regularity in
the proportion of Things, for ought we know there may be only a Race of Pygmies about
the BigneÅ¿s of Frogs and Mice,
[
57
]
poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿sâd
of the Planets. But I Å¿hall Å¿how that this is very improbable by and by.

In the Planets are Å¿orts of rational Creatures as well as here.
There may ariÅ¿e another QueÅ¿tion, whether there be in the Planets but one Å¿ort of
rational Creatures, or if there be not Å¿everal Å¿orts poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of different degrees
of ReaÅ¿on and SenÅ¿e. There is Å¿omething not unlike this to be obÅ¿erved among us. For
to paÅ¿s by thoÅ¿e who have human Shape (althoâ Å¿ome of them would very well bear that
Enquiry too) if we do but conÅ¿ider Å¿ome Å¿orts of BeaÅ¿ts, as the Dog, the Ape, the
Beaver, the Elephant, nay Å¿ome Birds and Bees, what SenÅ¿e and UnderÅ¿tanding they are
maÅ¿ters of, we Å¿hall be forced to allow, that Man is not the only rational Animal.
For we diÅ¿cover Å¿omewhat in them of ReaÅ¿on independent on, and prior to all Teaching
and Practice.

But Å¿till no Body can doubt, but that the UnderÅ¿tanding and ReaÅ¿on of Man is to be
preferrâd to theirs, as being comprehenÅ¿ive of innumerable Things, indued with an
infinite memory of whatâs paÅ¿t, and capable of providing
[
58
]
againÅ¿t whatâs to come. That there is Å¿ome Å¿uch Species of rational Creatures in the
other Planets, which is the Head and Sovereign of the reÅ¿t, is very reaÅ¿onable to
believe: for otherwiÅ¿e, were many Species endued with the Å¿ame WiÅ¿dom and Cunning,
we Å¿hould have them always doing MiÅ¿chief, always quarrelling and fighting one with
another for Empire and Sovereignty, a Thing that we feel too much of where we have
but one Å¿uch Species. But to let that paÅ¿s, our next Enquiry Å¿hall be concerning thoÅ¿e
Animals in the Planets which are furniÅ¿hed with the greateÅ¿t ReaÅ¿on, whether itâs
poÅ¿Å¿ible to know wherein they employ it, and whether they have made as great Advances
in Arts and Knowledge as we in our Planet. Which deÅ¿erves moÅ¿t to be conÅ¿idered and
examined of any thing belonging to their Nature; and for the better Performance of
it we muÅ¿t take our RiÅ¿e Å¿omewhat higher, and nicely view the Lives and Studies of
Men.

And in thoÅ¿e things wherein Men provide and take care only of whatâs
[
59
]
abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the preÅ¿ervation of their Life; in defending themÅ¿elves from
the Injuries of the Air; in Å¿ecuring themÅ¿elves againÅ¿t the IncurÅ¿ions of Enemies
by Walls; and againÅ¿t Fraud and DiÅ¿turbances by Laws; in educating their Children,
and providing for themÅ¿elves and them: In all theÅ¿e I can Å¿ee no great reaÅ¿on that
Man has to boaÅ¿t of the Pre-eminency of his ReaÅ¿on above BeaÅ¿ts and other Animals.
For moÅ¿t of theÅ¿e Things they perform with greater EaÅ¿e and Art than we, and Å¿ome
of them they have no need of. For that SenÅ¿e of Virtue and JuÅ¿tice in which Man excels,
of FriendÅ¿hip, Gratitude and HoneÅ¿ty, of what uÅ¿e are they, but either to put a Å¿top
to the WickedneÅ¿s of Man, or to Å¿ecure us from mutual AÅ¿Å¿aults and Injuries, Things
wherein the BeaÅ¿ts want no Guide but Nature and Inclination? Then if we Å¿et before
our Eyes the manifold Cares, the DiÅ¿turbances of Mind, the reÅ¿tleÅ¿s DeÅ¿ires, the dread
of Death, that are the reÅ¿ult of this our ReaÅ¿on; and compare them with
[
60
]
that eaÅ¿y, quiet, and harmleÅ¿s Life which other Animals enjoy, we Å¿hould be apt to
wiÅ¿h a Change, and conclude that they, eÅ¿pecially Birds, lived with more PleaÅ¿ure
and HappineÅ¿s than Man could with all his WiÅ¿dom. For they have as great a ReliÅ¿h
of bodily PleaÅ¿ures as we, let the new PhiloÅ¿ophers Å¿ay what they will, who would
have them to be nothing but Clocks and Engines of FleÅ¿h; a Thing which BeaÅ¿ts Å¿o plainly
confute by crying and running away from a Stick, and all other Actions, that I wonder
how any one could Å¿ubÅ¿cribe to Å¿o abÅ¿urd and cruel an Opinion. Nay, I can Å¿carce doubt
but that Birds feel no Å¿mall PleaÅ¿ure in their eaÅ¿y, Å¿mooth Å¿ailing through the Air;
and would much more if they but knew the Advantages it hath above our Å¿low and
Men chiefly differ from BeaÅ¿ts in the Study of Nature.
laborious ProgreÅ¿Å¿ion. What is it then after all that Å¿ets human ReaÅ¿on above all
other, and makes us preferable to the reÅ¿t of the Animal World? Nothing in my Mind
Å¿o much as the Contemplation of the Works of God, and the Study of Nature, and the
improving
[
61
]
thoÅ¿e Sciences which may bring us to Å¿ome knowledge in their Beauty and Variety. For
without Knowledge what would be Contemplation? And what difference is there between
a Man, who with a careleÅ¿s Å¿upine Negligence views the Beauty and UÅ¿e of the Sun,
and the fine golden Furniture of the Heaven, and one who with a learned NiceneÅ¿s Å¿earches
into their CourÅ¿es; who underÅ¿tands wherein the Fixâd Stars, as they are callâd, differ
from the Planets, and what is the ReaÅ¿on of the regular ViciÅ¿Å¿itude of the SeaÅ¿ons;
who by Å¿ound ReaÅ¿oning can meaÅ¿ure the Magnitude and DiÅ¿tance of the Sun and Planets?
Or between Å¿uch a one as admires perhaps the nimble Activity and Å¿trange Motions of
Å¿ome Animals, and one that knows their whole Structure, underÅ¿tands the whole Fabrick
and Architecture of their CompoÅ¿ition? If therefore the Principle we before laid down
be true, that the other Planets are not inferiour in Dignity to ours,
They have AÅ¿tronomy.
what follows but that they have Creatures not to Å¿tare and wonder at the
[
62
]
Works of Nature only, but who employ their ReaÅ¿on in the Examination and Knowledge
of them, and have made as great Advances therein as we have? They do not only view
the Stars, but they improve the Science of AÅ¿tronomy: nor is there any thing can make
us think this improbable, but that fond ConceitedneÅ¿s of every Thing that we call
our own, and that Pride that is too natural to us to be eaÅ¿ily laid down. But I know
Å¿ome will Å¿ay, we are a little too bold in theÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿ertions of the Planets, and that
we mounted hither by many Probabilities, one of which, if it chance to be falÅ¿e, and
contrary to our SuppoÅ¿ition, would, like a bad Foundation, ruin the whole Building,
and make it fall to the Ground. But I would have them to know, that all I have Å¿aid
of their Knowledge in AÅ¿tronomy, has Proofs enough, antecedent to thoÅ¿e we now produced.
For Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the Earth, as we did, one of the Planets of equal Dignity and Honour
with the reÅ¿t, who would venture to Å¿ay, that no where elÅ¿e were to be found any that

[
63
]
enjoyâd the glorious Sight of Natureâs Theatre? Or if there were any Fellow-Spectators,
yet we were the only ones that had dived deep into the Secrets and Knowledge of it?
So that hereâs a Proof not Å¿o far fetchâd for the AÅ¿tronomy of the Planets, the Å¿ame
which we uÅ¿ed for their having rational Creatures, and enjoying the other Advantages
we before talkâd of, which Å¿erves at the Å¿ame time for the Confirmation of our former
Conjectures. But if Amazement and Fear at the EclipÅ¿es of the Moon and Sun gave the
firÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion to the Study of AÅ¿tronomy, as probably they did, then itâs almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible
that
Jupiter
and
Saturn
Å¿hould be without it; the Argument being of much greater force in them, by reaÅ¿on
of the daily EclipÅ¿es of their Moons, and the frequent ones of the Sun to their Inhabitants.
So that if a PerÅ¿on diÅ¿intereÅ¿ted in his Judgment, and equally ignorant of the Affairs
of all the Planets, were to give his Opinion in this Matter, I donât doubt he would
give the CauÅ¿e for AÅ¿tronomy to thoÅ¿e two Planets rather than us.

[
64
]

This SuppoÅ¿ition of their Knowledge and UÅ¿e of AÅ¿tronomy in the Planetary Worlds,
will afford us many new Conjectures about their manner of Life, and their State as
to other things.

And all its Å¿ubÅ¿ervient Arts.
For, FirÅ¿t: No ObÅ¿ervations of the Stars that are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the Knowledge of their
Motions, can be made without InÅ¿truments; nor can theÅ¿e be made without Metal, Wood,
or Å¿ome Å¿uch Å¿olid Body. Hereâs a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of allowing them the Carpenters Tools,
the Saw, the Ax, the Plane, the Mallet, the File: and the making of theÅ¿e requires
the UÅ¿e of Iron, or Å¿ome equally hard Metal.
Geometry and Arithmetick
:
Again, theÅ¿e InÅ¿truments canât be without a Circle divided into equal Parts, or a
Å¿trait Line into unequal. Hereâs a neceÅ¿Å¿ity for introducing Geometry and Arithmetick.
Then the NeceÅ¿Å¿ity
And Writing.
in Å¿uch ObÅ¿ervations of marking down the Epochas or Accounts of Time, and of tranÅ¿mitting
them to PoÅ¿terity, will force us to grant them the Art of Writing; perhaps very different
from ours which is commonly uÅ¿ed, but I dare affirm not more ingenious
[
65
]
or eaÅ¿y. For how much more ready and expeditious is our Way, than by that multitude
of Characters uÅ¿ed in
China
; and how vaÅ¿tly preferable to Knots tied in Cords, or the Pictures in uÅ¿e among the
barbarous People of
Mexico
and
Peru
? Thereâs no Nation in the World but has Å¿ome way or other of writing or marking down
their Thoughts: So that itâs no wonder if the Planetary Inhabitants have been taught
it by that great School-miÅ¿treÅ¿s NeceÅ¿Å¿ity, and apply it to the Study of AÅ¿tronomy
and other Sciences. In AÅ¿tronomical Matters the NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of it is moreover apparent
from hence, that the Motion of the Stars is as âtwere to be fancied and gueÅ¿sâd at
in different SyÅ¿tems, and theÅ¿e SyÅ¿tems to be continually improved and corrected,
as later and more exact ObÅ¿ervations Å¿hall convince the old ones of Faults: all which
can never be deliverâd down to Å¿ucceeding Generations, unleÅ¿s we make uÅ¿e of Letters
and Figures.

But after all theÅ¿e large and liberal Allowances to Them, they will Å¿till
[
66
]
be behind-hand with us. For we have Å¿o certain a Knowledge of the true
And Opticks.
SyÅ¿tem and Frame of the UniverÅ¿e; we have Å¿o admirable an Invention of TeleÅ¿copes
to help our failing Eye-Å¿ight in the view of the BigneÅ¿s and different Forms of the
Planetary Bodies, in the diÅ¿covery of the Mountains, and the Shadows of them on the
Surface of the Moon, in the bringing to light an innumerable multitude of Stars otherwiÅ¿e
inviÅ¿ible, that we muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be far their MaÅ¿ters in that Knowledge. Hence
it is almoÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary (except we have a Mind to flatter and complement our Å¿elves
as the only People that have the Advantage of Å¿uch excellent Inventions) either to
allow the Planetary Inhabitants Å¿uch Å¿harp Eyes as not to need them, or elÅ¿e the uÅ¿e
of GlaÅ¿Å¿es to help the Deficiency of their Sight. And yet I dare not aÅ¿Å¿ert this,
leÅ¿t any one Å¿hould be Å¿o diÅ¿turbed at the Extravagancy of Å¿uch an Opinion, as to
take the meaÅ¿ure of my other Conjectures by it, and hiÅ¿s them all off, upon the account
of this alone.

[
67
]

TheÅ¿e Sciences not contrary to Nature.
But Å¿ome Body may perhaps object, and that not without reaÅ¿on at firÅ¿t Å¿ight, that
the Planetary Inhabitants itâs likely are deÅ¿titute of all refined Knowledge, juÅ¿t
as the
Americans
were before they had Commerce with the
Europeans
. For if one conÅ¿iders the Ignorance of thoÅ¿e Nations, and of others in
AÅ¿ia
and
Africa
equally barbarous, it will appear as if the main DeÅ¿ign of the Creator in placing
Men upon the Earth was that they might live, and, in a juÅ¿t Å¿enÅ¿e of all the BleÅ¿Å¿ings
and PleaÅ¿ure they enjoy, worÅ¿hip the Fountain of their HappineÅ¿s; but that Å¿ome few
went beyond the Bounds of Nature in their Enquiries after Knowledge. There does not
want an AnÅ¿wer to theÅ¿e Men. For God could not but foreÅ¿ee the Advances Men would
make, in their enquiring into the Heavenly Bodies: that they would diÅ¿cover Arts uÅ¿eful
and advantageous to Life: that they would croÅ¿s the Seas, and dig up the Bowels of
the Earth. Nothing of all this could happen contrary to the Mind and Knowledge of
the Infinite Author of all Things. And if
[
68
]
he foreÅ¿aw theÅ¿e Things would be, he Å¿o appointed and deÅ¿tinâd them to humane kind.
And the Studies of Arts and Sciences cannot be Å¿aid to be contrary to Nature, Å¿ince
in the Å¿earch thereof they are employâd: eÅ¿pecially if we conÅ¿ider how great the natural,
deÅ¿ire and love of Knowledge, rooted in all Men is. For itâs impoÅ¿Å¿ible this Å¿hould
have been given them upon no DeÅ¿ign or Account. But they will urge, that if Å¿uch a
Knowledge is natural, if we were born for it, why are there Å¿o very few, eÅ¿pecially
in AÅ¿tronomy, that proÅ¿ecute theÅ¿e Studies? For
Europe
is the only Quarter of the Earth in which there have been any Advancements made in
AÅ¿tronomy. And as for the Judicial AÅ¿trology, which pretends to foretel what is to
come, it is Å¿uch a wretched and oftentimes miÅ¿chievous piece of MadneÅ¿s, that I do
not think it ought to be Å¿o much as named here. And even in
Europe
, not one in a hundred ThouÅ¿and meddles with theÅ¿e Studies. BeÅ¿ides, its
Original
and RiÅ¿e is Å¿o late, that many Ages were paÅ¿t before
[
69
]
the very firÅ¿t Rudiments of AÅ¿tronomy or Geometry (which is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the learning
of it) were known. For every Body is acquainted almoÅ¿t with its firÅ¿t Beginnings in

Egypt
and
Greece
. Add to this, that âtis not yet above fourÅ¿core Years Å¿ince the bungling Epicycles
were diÅ¿carded, and the true and eaÅ¿y plain Motion of the Planets was diÅ¿covered.
For the Satisfaction of theÅ¿e Scruples, to what we Å¿aid before, concerning the Fore-knowledge
of God, may be added this; That God never deÅ¿igned we Å¿hould come into the World AÅ¿tronomers
or PhiloÅ¿ophers; theÅ¿e Arts are not infuÅ¿ed into us at our Birth, but were ordered,
in long Tracts of Time, by degrees to be the Rewards and ReÅ¿ult of laborious Diligence;
eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e Sciences which are now in debate, are Å¿o much the more difficult
and abÅ¿truÅ¿e, that their late Invention and Å¿low ProgreÅ¿s are Å¿o far from being a
Wonder, that it is rather Å¿trange they were ever diÅ¿coverâd at all. There are but
few, I acknowledge one or two perhaps in an Age, that purÅ¿ue them,
[
70
]
or think them their BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s: but their Number will be very conÅ¿iderable if we take
in thoÅ¿e that have lived in all the Ages in which AÅ¿tronomy hath flouriÅ¿hed: and no
Body can deny them that HappineÅ¿s and Contentment which they have pretended to above
all others. In fine, it was Å¿ufficient that Å¿o Å¿mall a Number Å¿hould make it their
Study, Å¿o that the Profit and Advantage of their Inventions might but Å¿pread it Å¿elf
over all the World. Since then the Inhabitants of this Earth, let them be never Å¿o
few, have had Parts and Genius Å¿ufficient for the Attainment of this Knowledge; and
thereâs no reaÅ¿on to think the Planetary Inhabitants leÅ¿s ingenious or happy than
our Å¿elves; we have gainâd our Point, and âtis probable that they are as skilful AÅ¿tronomers
as we can pretend to be. So that now we may venture to deduce Å¿ome ConÅ¿equences from
Å¿uch a SuppoÅ¿ition.

We have before Å¿howâd the neceÅ¿Å¿ary Dependence and Connexion, not only of Geometry
and Arithmetick, but of Mechanical Arts and InÅ¿truments with this Science. This leads

[
71
]
us naturally to the Enquiry how they can uÅ¿e theÅ¿e InÅ¿truments and Engines for the
ObÅ¿ervation of the Stars, how they can write down Å¿uch their ObÅ¿ervations, and perform
other Things which we do with our Hands. So that we muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily give them
They have Hands.
Hands, or Å¿ome other Member, as convenient for all those UÅ¿es, inÅ¿tead of them. One
of the ancient PhiloÅ¿ophers laid Å¿uch StreÅ¿s upon the UÅ¿e and Conveniency of the Hands,
that he made no Å¿cruple to affirm, they were the CauÅ¿e and Foundation of all our Knowledge.
By which, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, he meant no more, than that without their Help and AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance
Men could never arrive to the Improvement of their Minds in natural Knowledge: And
indeed not without ReaÅ¿on. For Å¿uppoÅ¿e inÅ¿tead of them they had had Hoofs like HorÅ¿es
or Bullocks given them, they might have laid indeed the Model and DeÅ¿ign of Cities
and HouÅ¿es in their Head, but they would never have been able to have built them.
They would have had no Subject of DiÅ¿courÅ¿e but what belongâd to their
[
72
]
Victuals, Marriages, or Self-preÅ¿ervation. They would have been void of all Knowledge
and Memory, and indeed would have been but one degree diÅ¿tant from brute BeaÅ¿ts. What
could we invent or imagine that could be Å¿o exactly accommodated to all the deÅ¿ignâd
UÅ¿es as the Hands are? Elephants can lay hold of, or throw any thing with their ProboÅ¿cis,
can take up even the Å¿malleÅ¿t Things from the Ground, and can perform Å¿uch Å¿urpriÅ¿ing
Things with it, that it has not very improperly been callâd their Hand, thoâ indeed
it is nothing but a NoÅ¿e Å¿omewhat longer than ordinary. Nor do Birds Å¿how leÅ¿s Art
and DeÅ¿ign in the UÅ¿e of their Bills in the picking up their Meat, and the wonderful
CompoÅ¿ure of their NeÅ¿ts. But all this is nothing to thoÅ¿e Conveniences the Hand is
Å¿o admirably Å¿uited to; nothing to that amazing Contrivance in its Capacity of being
Å¿tretched, or contracted, or turned to any Part as OccaÅ¿ion Å¿hall require. And then,
to paÅ¿s by that nice SenÅ¿e that the Ends of the Fingers are endued with, even to the
feeling and
[
73
]
diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing moÅ¿t Å¿orts of Bodies in the Dark, what WiÅ¿dom and Art is Å¿howâd in
the DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the Thumb and Fingers, Å¿o as to take up or keep faÅ¿t hold of any
Thing we pleaÅ¿e? Either then the Planetary Inhabitants muÅ¿t have Hands, or Å¿omewhat
equally convenient, which it is not eaÅ¿y to conceive; or elÅ¿e we muÅ¿t Å¿ay that Nature
has been kinder not only to us, but even to Squirrels and Monkeys than them.

And Feet.
That they have Feet alÅ¿o Å¿carce any one can doubt, that does but conÅ¿ider what we
Å¿aid but juÅ¿t now of Animals different Ways of going along, which itâs hard to imagine
can be performâd any other ways than what we there recounted. And of all thoÅ¿e, thereâs
none can agree Å¿o well with the Å¿tate of the Planetary Inhabitants, as that that we
here make uÅ¿e of. Except (what is not very probable, if they live in Society, as I
Å¿hall Å¿how they do) they have found out the Art of flying in Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e Worlds.

That they are upright.
The Stature and Shape of Men here does Å¿how forth the Divine Providence
[
74
]
Å¿o much in its being Å¿o fitly adapted to its deÅ¿ignâd UÅ¿es, that it is not without
reaÅ¿on that all the PhiloÅ¿ophers have taken notice of it, nor without Probability
that the Planetary Inhabitants have their Eyes and Countenance upright, like us, for
the more convenient and eaÅ¿y Contemplation and ObÅ¿ervations of the Stars. For if the
WiÅ¿dom of the Creator is Å¿o obÅ¿ervable, Å¿o PraiÅ¿e-worthy in the PoÅ¿ition of the other
Members; in the convenient Situation of the Eyes, as Watches in the higher Region
of the Body; in the removing of the more uncomely Parts out of Å¿ight as âtwere, we
cannot but think he has almoÅ¿t obÅ¿erved the Å¿ame Method in the Bodies of thoÅ¿e remote
Inhabitants. Nor
It follows not therefore that they have the Å¿ame Shape with us.
does it follow from hence that they muÅ¿t be of the Å¿ame Shape with us. For there
is Å¿uch an infinite poÅ¿Å¿ible variety of Figures to be imagined, that both the Structure
of their whole Bodies, and every part of them, both outÅ¿ide and inÅ¿ide, may be quite
different from ours. How warmly and conveniently are Å¿ome Creatures
clothâd
with
[
75
]
Wool, and how finely are others decked and adornâd with Feathers? Perhaps among the
rational Creatures in the Planets there may Å¿ome Å¿uch diÅ¿tinction be obÅ¿ervâd in their
Garb and Covering; a Thing in which BeaÅ¿ts Å¿eem to excel Men in here. UnleÅ¿s perhaps
Men are born naked, for this reaÅ¿on to put them upon employing and exerciÅ¿ing their
Wits, in the inventing and making that Attire that Nature had made neceÅ¿Å¿ary for them.
And âtis this NeceÅ¿Å¿ity that has been the greateÅ¿t, if not only occaÅ¿ion of all the
Trade and Commerce, of all the Mechanical Inventions and DiÅ¿coveries that we are MaÅ¿ters
of. BeÅ¿ides, Nature might have another great Conveniency in her Eye, by bringing Men
into the World naked, namely, that they might accommodate themÅ¿elves to all places
of the World, and go thicker or thinner clothâd, according as the SeaÅ¿on and Climate
they livâd in requirâd. There may Å¿till be conceived a greater difference between
us and the Inhabitants of the Planets; for there are Å¿ome Å¿ort of Animals, Å¿uch
[
76
]
as OyÅ¿ters, LobÅ¿ters, and Crab-fiÅ¿h, whoÅ¿e FleÅ¿h is on the inÅ¿ide of their Bones as
âtwere. But that which hinders me from aÅ¿cribing Å¿uch a kind of Frame and CompoÅ¿ition
to the Planetary Inhabitants, is that Nature Å¿eems to have done it only in a few of
the meaneÅ¿t Sort of Creatures, and that hereby they would be deprived of that quick
eaÅ¿y motion of their Hands and Fingers, which is Å¿o uÅ¿eful and
neceÅ¿Å¿ary
to them, otherwiÅ¿e I Å¿hould not be much affected with the odd Shape and Figure.

A rational Soul may inhabit another Shape than ours.
For âtis a very ridiculous Opinion, that the common People have got, that âtis impoÅ¿Å¿ible
a rational Soul Å¿hould dwell in any other Shape than ours. And yet as Å¿illy as âtis,
it has been the occaÅ¿ion of many PhiloÅ¿ophers allowing the Gods no other Shape; nay,
the Foundation of a Sect among the ChriÅ¿tians, that from hence have the Name of
Anthropomorphites
. This can proceed from nothing but the WeakneÅ¿s, Ignorance, and Prejudice of Men;
the Å¿ame as that other concerning humane Shape, that it is
[
77
]
the handÅ¿omeÅ¿t and moÅ¿t excellent of all others, when indeed itâs nothing but a being
accuÅ¿tomed to that Figure that makes us think Å¿o, and a Conceit that we and all other
Animals naturally have, that no Shape or Colour can be Å¿o good as our own. Yet Å¿o
powerful are theÅ¿e, that were we to meet with a Creature of a much different Shape
from Man, with ReaÅ¿on and Speech, we Å¿hould be much Å¿urpriÅ¿ed and Å¿hocked at the Sight.
For if we try to imagine or paint a Creature like a Man in every Thing elÅ¿e, but that
has a Neck four times as long, and great round Eyes five or Å¿ix times as big, and
farther diÅ¿tant, we cannot look uponât without the utmoÅ¿t AverÅ¿ion, althoâ at the
Å¿ame time we can give no account of our DiÅ¿like.

The Planetarians not leÅ¿s than we.
When I juÅ¿t now mentioned the Stature of the Planetary Inhabitants, I hinted that
âtwas improbable they Å¿hould be leÅ¿s than we are. For itâs likely, that as our Bodies
are made in Å¿uch a proportion to our Earth, as to render us capable of travelling
about it, and making ObÅ¿ervations
[
78
]
upon its Bulk and Figure, the Å¿ame Order is obÅ¿ervâd in the Inhabitants of the other
Planets, unleÅ¿s in this Particular alÅ¿o, which is very conÅ¿iderable, we would prefer
our Å¿elves to all others. Then Å¿eeing we have before allowâd them AÅ¿tronomy and ObÅ¿ervations,
we muÅ¿t give them Bodies and Strength Å¿ufficient for the ruling their InÅ¿truments,
and the erecting their Tubes and Engines. And for this the larger they are the better.
For if we Å¿hould Å¿uppoÅ¿e them Dwarfs not above the BigneÅ¿s of Rats or Mice, they could
neither make Å¿uch ObÅ¿ervations as are requiÅ¿ite; nor Å¿uch InÅ¿truments as are neceÅ¿Å¿ary
to thoÅ¿e ObÅ¿ervations. Therefore we muÅ¿t Å¿uppoÅ¿e them larger than, or at leaÅ¿t equal
to, our Å¿elves, eÅ¿pecially in
Jupiter
and
Saturn
, which are Å¿o vaÅ¿tly bigger than the Planet which we inhabit.

They live in Society.
AÅ¿tronomy, we Å¿aid before, could never Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t without the writing down the ObÅ¿ervations:
Nor could the Art of Writing (any more than the Arts of Carpenters and Founders) ever
be found out except in a Society
[
79
]
of reaÅ¿onable Creatures, where the NeceÅ¿Å¿ities of Life forcâd them upon Invention:
So that it follows from hence, (as was before Å¿aid) that the Planetary Inhabitants
muÅ¿t in this be like us, that they maintain a Society and FellowÅ¿hip with, and afford
mutual AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tances and Helps to one another. Hereupon we muÅ¿t allow them a Å¿ettled,
not a wandring
Scythian
way of living, as more convenient for Men in Å¿uch CircumÅ¿tances. But what follows
from hence? MuÅ¿t they not have every thing elÅ¿e proper for Å¿uch a manner of living
granted them too? MuÅ¿t they not have their Governours, HouÅ¿es, Cities, Trade and Bartering?
Why Å¿hould they not, when even the barbarous People of
America
and other Places were at their firÅ¿t DiÅ¿covery found to have Å¿omewhat of that nature
in uÅ¿e among them. I donât Å¿ay, that Things muÅ¿t be the Å¿ame there as they are here.
We have many that may very well be Å¿pared among rational Creatures, and were deÅ¿ignâd
only for the preÅ¿ervation of Society from all Injury, and for the curbing of thoÅ¿e

[
80
]
Men who make an ill uÅ¿e of their ReaÅ¿on to the Detriment of others. Perhaps in the
Planets they have Å¿uch plenty and affluence of all good Things, as they neither need
or deÅ¿ire to Å¿teal from one another; perhaps they may be Å¿o juÅ¿t and good as to be
at perpetual Peace, and never to lie in wait for, or take away the Life of their Neighbour:
perhaps they may not know what Anger or Hatred are; and if Å¿o, they muÅ¿t be much happier
than we. But itâs more likely they have Å¿uch a mixture of Good with Bad, of WiÅ¿e with
Fools, of War with Peace, and want not that School-miÅ¿treÅ¿s of Arts
Poverty
. For, as was before Å¿hown, Å¿ome good uÅ¿e may be made of theÅ¿e things, but if not,
there is no ReaÅ¿on why we Å¿hould prefer their Condition to our own.

They enjoy the PleaÅ¿ures of Society.
What I am now going to Å¿ay may Å¿eem Å¿omewhat more bold, and yet is not leÅ¿s likely
than the former. For if theÅ¿e Nations in the Planets live in Society, as I have pretty
well Å¿howâd they do, âtis Å¿omewhat more than probable that they enjoy not only the

[
81
]
Profit, but the PleaÅ¿ures ariÅ¿ing from Society: Å¿uch as ConverÅ¿ation, Amours, JeÅ¿ting,
and Shews. OtherwiÅ¿e we Å¿hould make them live without DiverÅ¿ion or Merriment; we Å¿hould
deprive them of the great SweetneÅ¿s of Life, which it canât well be without, and give
our Å¿elves Å¿uch an Advantage over them as ReaÅ¿on will by no means admit of.

But to proceed to a farther Enquiry into their BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s and Employment, letâs conÅ¿ider
what we have not yet mentionâd, wherein they may bear any LikeneÅ¿s to us. And firÅ¿t
we have good ReaÅ¿on to believe they build themÅ¿elves HouÅ¿es, becauÅ¿e we are Å¿ure they
are not without their Showers. For in
Jupiter
have been obÅ¿erved Clouds, big no doubt with Vapours and Water, which hath been proved
by many other Arguments, not to be wanting in that Planet. They have Rain then, for
otherwiÅ¿e how could all the Vapours drawn up by the Heat of the Sun be diÅ¿poÅ¿ed of?
And Winds, for they are cauÅ¿ed only by Vapours diÅ¿Å¿olved by Heat, and itâs
[
82
]
plain that they blow in

Clouds about him. To protect themÅ¿elves from theÅ¿e, and that they may paÅ¿s their
Nights in Quiet and Safety, they muÅ¿t build themÅ¿elves Tents or Huts, or live in Holes
of the Earth. But why may we not Å¿uppoÅ¿e the Planetary Inhabitants to be as good Architects,
have as noble HouÅ¿es, and as Å¿tately Palaces as our Å¿elves? UnleÅ¿s we think that every
Thing which belongs to our Å¿elves is the moÅ¿t beautiful and perfect that can be. And
who are we, but a few that live in a little Corner of the World, upon a Ball ten ThouÅ¿and
times leÅ¿s than
Jupiter
or
Saturn
? And yet we muÅ¿t be the only skilful People at Building; and all others muÅ¿t be our
Inferiours in the Knowledge of uniform Symetry; and not be able to raiÅ¿e Towers and
Pyramids as high, magnificent, and beautiful, as our Å¿elves. For my part, I Å¿ee no
reaÅ¿on why they may not be as great MaÅ¿ters as we are, and have the UÅ¿e of all thoÅ¿e
Arts Å¿ubÅ¿ervient to it, as Stone-cutting and Brick-making,
[
83
]
and whatÅ¿oever elÅ¿e is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for it, as Iron, Lead and GlaÅ¿s; or ornamental to
it, as Gilding and Picture.

If their Globe is divided like ours, into Sea and Land, as itâs evident it is (elÅ¿e
whence could all thoÅ¿e Vapours in
Jupiter
proceed?) we have great ReaÅ¿on to allow them the Art of Navigation, and not vainly
ingroÅ¿s Å¿o great, Å¿o uÅ¿eful a Thing to our Å¿elves. EÅ¿pecially conÅ¿idering the great
Advantages
Jupiter
and
Saturn
have for Sailing, in having Å¿o many Moons to direct their CourÅ¿e, by whoÅ¿e Guidance
they may attain eaÅ¿ily to the Knowledge that we are not MaÅ¿ters of, of the Longitude
of Places. And what a Multitude of other Things follow from this Allowance? If they
have Ships, they muÅ¿t have Sails and Anchors, Ropes, Pullies, and Rudders, which are
of particular UÅ¿e in directing a Shipâs CourÅ¿e againÅ¿t the Wind, and in Å¿ailing different
Ways with the Å¿ame Gale. And perhaps they may not be without the UÅ¿e of the CompaÅ¿s
too, for the magnetical Matter, which continually paÅ¿Å¿es throâ the Pores of our Earth,

[
84
]
is of Å¿uch a Nature, that itâs very probable the Planets have Å¿omething like
They have Navigation, and all Arts Å¿ubÅ¿ervient.
it. But thereâs no doubt but that they muÅ¿t have the Mechanical Arts and AÅ¿tronomy,
without which Navigation can no more Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t, than they can without Geometry.

But Geometry Å¿tands in no need of being provâd after this manner. Nor doth it want
AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance from other Arts which depend upon it, but we may have a nearer and Å¿horter
AÅ¿Å¿urance of their not being without it in thoÅ¿e Earths. For that Science is of Å¿uch
Å¿ingular Worth and Dignity, Å¿o peculiarly imploys the UnderÅ¿tanding, and gives it
Å¿uch a full ComprehenÅ¿ion and infallible
As Geometry.
certainty of Truth, as no other Knowledge can pretend to: it is moreover of Å¿uch
a Nature, that its Principles and Foundations muÅ¿t be Å¿o immutably the Å¿ame in all
Times and Places, that we cannot without InjuÅ¿tice pretend to monopolize it, and rob
the reÅ¿t of the UniverÅ¿e of Å¿uch an incomparable Study. Nay Nature it Å¿elf invites
us to be Geometricians; it preÅ¿ents us with Geometrical
[
85
]
Figures, with Circles and Squares, with Triangles, Polygones, and Spheres, and propoÅ¿es
them as it were to our ConÅ¿ideration and Study, which abÅ¿tracting from its UÅ¿efulneÅ¿s,
is moÅ¿t delightful and raviÅ¿hing. Who can read
Euclid
, or
Apollonius
, about the Circle, without Admiration? Or
Archimedes
of the Surface of the Sphere, and Quadrature of the Parabola without Amazement? or
conÅ¿ider the late ingenious DiÅ¿coveries of the Moderns with BoldneÅ¿s and UnconcernedneÅ¿s?
And all theÅ¿e Truths are as naked and open, and depend upon the Å¿ame plain Principles
and Axioms in
Jupiter
and
Saturn
as here, which makes it not improbable that there are in the Planets Å¿ome who partake
with us in theÅ¿e delightful and pleaÅ¿ant Studies. But whatâs the greateÅ¿t Argument
with me, that there are Å¿uch, is their UÅ¿e, I had almoÅ¿t Å¿aid NeceÅ¿Å¿ity, in moÅ¿t Affairs
of humane Life. Now we are got thus far, what if we Å¿hould venture Å¿omewhat farther,
and Å¿ay, that they have our Inventions of the Tables of Sines, of Logarithms, and

[
86
]
Algebra? I know it would Å¿ound very odd, and perhaps a little ridiculous, and yet
thereâs no reaÅ¿on but the thinking our Å¿elves better than all the World, to hinder
them from being as happy in their DiÅ¿coveries, and as ingenious in their Inventions
as we our Å¿elves are.

They have MuÅ¿ick.
Itâs the Å¿ame with MuÅ¿ick as with Geometry, itâs every where immutably the Å¿ame,
and always will be Å¿o. For all Harmony conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in Concord, and Concord is all the
World over fixâd according to the Å¿ame invariable MeaÅ¿ure and Proportion. So that
in all Nations the Difference and DiÅ¿tance of Notes is the Å¿ame, whether they be in
a continued gradual ProgreÅ¿Å¿ion, or the Voice makes skips over one to the next. Nay
very credible Authors report, that thereâs a Å¿ort of Bird in
America
, that can plainly Å¿ing in order Å¿ix muÅ¿ical Notes: Whence it follows, that the Laws
of MuÅ¿ick are unchangeably fixâd by Nature, and therefore the Å¿ame ReaÅ¿on holds for
their MuÅ¿ick, as we eâen now Å¿hewed for their Geometry. For why, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing other
[
87
]
Nations and Creatures, endued with ReaÅ¿on and SenÅ¿e as well as we, Å¿hould not they
reap the PleaÅ¿ures ariÅ¿ing from theÅ¿e SenÅ¿es as well as we too? I donât know what
Effect this Argument, from the immutable Nature of theÅ¿e Arts, may have upon the Minds
of others; I think it no inconÅ¿iderable or contemptible one, but of as great Strength
as that which I made uÅ¿e of above to prove that the Planetary Inhabitants had the
SenÅ¿e of Seeing.

But if they take delight in Harmony, there is no doubt but that they have invented
MuÅ¿ical InÅ¿truments. For they could Å¿carce help lighting upon Å¿ome or other by chance;
the Sound of a tight String, the NoiÅ¿e of the Winds, or the whiÅ¿tling of Reeds, might
have given them the hint. From theÅ¿e Å¿mall Beginnings they perhaps, as well as we,
have advanced by degrees to the UÅ¿e of the Lute, Harp, Flute, and many Å¿tringâd InÅ¿truments.
But althoâ the Tones are certain and determinate, yet we find among different Nations
a quite different manner and rule for Singing; as
[
88
]
formerly among the
Dorians
,
Phrygians
, and
Lydians
, and in our Time among the
French
,
Italians
, and
PerÅ¿ians
. In like manner it may Å¿o happen, that the MuÅ¿ick of the Inhabitants of the Planets
may widely differ from all theÅ¿e, and yet be very good. But why we Å¿hould look upon
their MuÅ¿ick to be worÅ¿e than ours, thereâs no reaÅ¿on can be given; neither can we
well preÅ¿ume that they want the UÅ¿e of HalÅ¿-Notes and Quarter-Notes, Å¿eeing the Invention
of HalÅ¿-Notes is Å¿o obvious, and the UÅ¿e of them Å¿o agreeable to Nature. Nay, to go
a Step farther, what if they Å¿hould excel us in the Theory and practick part of MuÅ¿ick,
and outdo us in ConÅ¿orts of vocal and inÅ¿trumental MuÅ¿ick, Å¿o artificially composâd,
that they Å¿hew their Skill by the Mixtures of DiÅ¿cords and Concords? and of this laÅ¿t
Å¿ort âtis very likely the 5th and 3d are in uÅ¿e with them.

This is a very bold AÅ¿Å¿ertion, but it may be true for ought we know, and the Inhabitants
of the Planets may poÅ¿Å¿ibly have a greater inÅ¿ight into the Theory of MuÅ¿ick than
has yet been
[
89
]
diÅ¿coverâd among us. For if you ask any of our MuÅ¿icians, why two or more perfect
Fifths cannot be uÅ¿ed regularly in CompoÅ¿ition; Å¿ome Å¿ay âtis to avoid that SweetneÅ¿s
and LuÅ¿hiouÅ¿neÅ¿s which ariÅ¿es from the Repetition of this pleaÅ¿ing Chord. Others Å¿ay,
this muÅ¿t be avoided for the Å¿ake of that Variety of Chords that are requiÅ¿ite to
make a good CompoÅ¿ition; and theÅ¿e ReaÅ¿ons are brought by
Cartes
and others. But an Inhabitant of
Jupiter
or
Venus
will perhaps give you a better ReaÅ¿on for this,
viz.
becauÅ¿e when you paÅ¿s from one perfect Fifth to another, there is Å¿uch a Change made
as immediately alters your Key, you are got into a new Key before the Ear is prepared
for it, and the more perfect Chords you uÅ¿e of the Å¿ame kind in ConÅ¿ecution, by Å¿o
much the more you offend the Ear by theÅ¿e abrupt Changes.

Again, one of theÅ¿e Inhabitants perhaps can Å¿how how it comes about, that in a Song
of one or more Parts, the Key cannot be kept Å¿o well in the Å¿ame agreeable Tenour,
unleÅ¿s the intermediate CloÅ¿es and Intervals be Å¿o temperâd,
[
90
]
as to vary from their uÅ¿ual Proportions, and thereby to bear a little this way or
that, in order to regulate the Scale. And why this Temperature is beÅ¿t in the SyÅ¿tem
of the Strings, when out of the Fifth the fourth Part of a Comma is uÅ¿ually cut off;
This Å¿ame thing I have formerly Å¿hewâd at large.

But for the regulating the Tone of the Voice (as I before hinted) that may admit of
a more eaÅ¿y proof, and we Å¿hall give you an EÅ¿Å¿ay of it, Å¿ince I have mentioned a
thing that is not mere Imagination only: I Å¿ay therefore, if any PerÅ¿on Å¿trike thoÅ¿e
Sounds which the MuÅ¿icians diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h by theÅ¿e Letters, C, F, D, G, C, by theÅ¿e agreeable
Intervals, altogether perfect, interchangeable, aÅ¿cending and deÅ¿cending with the
Voice: Now this latter Å¿ound C will be one Comma, or very Å¿mall portion lower than
the firÅ¿t Å¿ounding of C. BecauÅ¿e of theÅ¿e perfect Intervals, which are as 4 to 3,
5 to 6, 4 to 3, 2 to 3, an account is made in Å¿uch a Proportion, as 160 to 162. that
is, as 80 to 81, which is what they call a Comma. So that if the Å¿ame Sound
[
91
]
Å¿hould be repeated nine times, the Voice would fall near the Matter a greater Tone,
whoÅ¿e proportion is as 8 to 9. But this the SenÅ¿e of the Ears by no means endures,
but remembers the firÅ¿t Tone, and returns to it again. Therefore we are compellâd
to uÅ¿e an occult Temperament, and to Å¿ing theÅ¿e imperfect Intervals, from doing which
leÅ¿s Offence ariÅ¿es. And for the moÅ¿t part, all Singing wants this Temperament, as
may be collected by the aforeÅ¿aid Computations. And theÅ¿e things we have offerâd to
thoÅ¿e that have Å¿ome Knowledge in Geometry.

We have Å¿poke of theÅ¿e Arts and Inventions, which it is very probable the Inhabitants
of the Planets partake of in common with us, beÅ¿ides which it Å¿eems requiÅ¿ite to take
in many other Things that Å¿erve either for the UÅ¿e or PleaÅ¿ure of their Lives. But
what theÅ¿e Things are we Å¿hall the better account for, by laying before us many of
thoÅ¿e Things which are found among us. I have before mentionâd the Variety of Animals
and Vegetables, which very much differ from each other,
[
92
]
among which there are Å¿ome that differ but little; and I have Å¿aid, that there are
no leÅ¿s differences in theÅ¿e Things in the Planetary Worlds.

I Å¿hall now take a Å¿hort view of the Benefits we receive both from thoÅ¿e Herbs and
Animals, and Å¿ee whether we may not with very good reaÅ¿on conclude that the Planetary
Inhabitants reap as great and as many from thoÅ¿e that their Countries afford them.

And here it may be worth our while to take a Review of the Variety and Multitude of
our Riches. For Trees and Herbs do not only Å¿erve us for Food, they in their delicious
Fruits, theÅ¿e in their Seeds, Leaves and Roots; but Herbs moreover furniÅ¿h us with
PhyÅ¿ick, and Trees with Timber for our HouÅ¿es and Ships. Flax, by the means of thoÅ¿e
two uÅ¿eful Arts of Spinning and Weaving, affords us Clothing. Of Hemp or Matweed we
twiÅ¿t our Å¿elves Thread and Å¿mall Ropes, the former of which we employ in Sails and
Nets, the latter in making larger Ropes for MaÅ¿ts and Anchors. With the Å¿weet Smells
and
[

The Advantages we reap from Herbs and Animals.
beauteous Colours of Flowers we feaÅ¿t our SenÅ¿es: and even thoÅ¿e of them, that offend
our NoÅ¿trils, or are miÅ¿chievous to our Bodies, are Å¿eldom without excellent UÅ¿es:
or were made perhaps by Nature as a Foil to Å¿et off, and make us the more value the
Good by comparing them with theÅ¿e. What vaÅ¿t Advantages and Profit do we reap from
the Animals? The Sheep give us Clothing, and the Cows afford us Milk: and both of
them their FleÅ¿h for our SuÅ¿tenance. AÅ¿Å¿es, Camels, and HorÅ¿es do, what if we wanted
them we muÅ¿t do our Å¿elves, carry our Burdens; and the laÅ¿t of them we make uÅ¿e of,
either themÅ¿elves to carry us, or in our Coaches to draw us. In which we have Å¿o excellent,
Å¿o uÅ¿eful an Invention of Wheels, that I canât Å¿uppoÅ¿e the Planets to enjoy Society
and all its ConÅ¿equences, and be without them. Whether they are Pythagoreans there,
or feed upon FleÅ¿h as we do, I dare not affirm any Thing. Thoâ it Å¿eems to be allowed
Men to feed upon whatÅ¿oever may afford them NouriÅ¿hment, either on Land, or in
[
94
]
Water, upon Herbs, and Pomes, Milk, Eggs, Honey, FiÅ¿h, and no leÅ¿s upon the FleÅ¿h
of many Birds and BeaÅ¿ts. But it is a Å¿urpriÅ¿ing thing! that a rational Creature Å¿hould
live upon the Ruin and DeÅ¿truction of Å¿uch a number of other his Fellow-Creatures!
And yet it does not Å¿eem at all unnatural, Å¿ince not only he, but even Lions, Wolves,
and other ravenous BeaÅ¿ts, prey upon Flocks of other harmleÅ¿s Things, and make mere
Fodder of them; as Eagles do of Pidgeons and Hares; and large FiÅ¿h of the helpleÅ¿s
little ones. We have different Å¿orts of Dogs for Hunting, and what our own Legs cannot,
that their NoÅ¿e and Legs can help us to. But the UÅ¿e and Profit of Herbs and Animals
are not the only Things they are good for, but they raiÅ¿e our Delight and Admiration
when we conÅ¿ider their various Forms and Natures, and enquire into all their different
ways of Generation: Things Å¿o infinitely multifarious, and Å¿o delightfully amazing,
that the Books of natural PhiloÅ¿ophers are deÅ¿ervedly filled with their Encomiums.
For even in the
[
95
]
very InÅ¿ects, who can but admire the Å¿ix-cornerâd Cells of the Bees, or the artificial
Web of a Spider, or the fine Bag of a Silk-worm, which laÅ¿t affords us, with the Help
of incredible InduÅ¿try, even Shiploads of Å¿oft delicate Clothing. This is a Å¿hort
Summary of thoÅ¿e many profitable Advantages the animal and herbal World Å¿erve us with.

But this is not all. The Bowels of the Earth likewiÅ¿e contribute much to Manâs HappineÅ¿s.
For what Art and Cunning does he employ in finding, in digging, in trying Metals,
and in melting, refining, and tempering them?
And from Metals.
What Skill and Nicety in beating, drawing or diÅ¿Å¿olving Gold, Å¿o as with inconÅ¿iderable
Changes to make every Thing he pleaÅ¿es put on that noble LuÅ¿tre? Of how many and admirable
UÅ¿es is Iron? and how ignorant in all Mechanical Knowledge were thoÅ¿e Nations that
were not acquainted with it, Å¿o as to have no other Arms but Bows, Clubs, and Spears,
made of Wood. Thereâs one Thing indeed we have, which itâs a QueÅ¿tion whether it has

[
96
]
done more harm or good, and that is Gun-powder made of Nitre and BrimÅ¿tone. At firÅ¿t
indeed it Å¿eemâd as if we had got a more Å¿ecure DefenÅ¿e than former Ages againÅ¿t all
AÅ¿Å¿aults, and could eaÅ¿ily guard our Towns, by the wonderful Strength of that Invention,
againÅ¿t all hoÅ¿tile InvaÅ¿ions: but now we find it has rather encouraged them, and
at the Å¿ame time been no Å¿mall OccaÅ¿ion of the Decay of Valour, by rendring it and
Strength almoÅ¿t uÅ¿eleÅ¿s in War. Had the
Grecian
Emperor who Å¿aid,
Virtue was ruinâd
only when Slings and Rams firÅ¿t came into uÅ¿e, livâd in our Days, he might well have
complainâd; eÅ¿pecially of Bombs, againÅ¿t which neither Art nor Nature is of Å¿ufficient
Proof: but which lays every Thing, CaÅ¿tles and Towers, be they never Å¿o Å¿trong, even
with the Ground. If for nothing elÅ¿e, yet upon this one account, I think we had better
have been without the DiÅ¿covery. Yet, when we were talking of our DiÅ¿coveries, it
was not to be paÅ¿sâd over, for the Planets too may have their miÅ¿chievous as well
as uÅ¿eful Inventions.

[
97
]

We are happier in the UÅ¿es for which the Air and Water Å¿erves us; both of which helps
us in our Navigation, and furniÅ¿hes us with a Strength Å¿ufficient, without any Labour
of our own, to turn round our Mills and Engines; Things which are of uÅ¿e to us in
Å¿o many different Employments. For with them we grind our Corn, and Å¿queeze out our
Oil; with them we cut Wood, and mill Cloth, and with them we beat our Stuff for Paper.
An incomparable Invention! Where the naÅ¿tieÅ¿t uÅ¿eleÅ¿s Scraps of Linen are made to
produce fine white Sheets. To theÅ¿e we may add the late diÅ¿covery of Printing, which
not only preÅ¿erves from Death Arts and Knowledge, but makes them much eaÅ¿ier to be
attained than before. Nor muÅ¿t we forget the Arts of Engraving and Painting, which
from mean Beginnings have improved to that Excellence, that nothing that ever Å¿prung
from the Wit of Man can claim Pre-eminence to them. Nor is the way of melting and
blowing GlaÅ¿Å¿es, and of poliÅ¿hing and Å¿preading Quick-Å¿ilver
[
98
]
over Looking-GlaÅ¿Å¿es, unworthy of being mentioned, nor above all, the admirable uÅ¿es
that GlaÅ¿Å¿es have been put to in natural Knowledge, Å¿ince the Invention of the TeleÅ¿cope
and MicroÅ¿cope. And no leÅ¿s nice and fine is the Art of making Clocks, Å¿ome of which
are Å¿o Å¿mall as to be no weight to the Bearer; and others Å¿o exact as to meaÅ¿ure out
the Time in as Å¿mall Portions as any one can deÅ¿ire: the Improvement of both which
the World owes to my
1
Inventions.

From the diÅ¿coveries of our Age.
I might add much here of the late DiÅ¿coveries, moÅ¿t of them of this Age, which have
been made in all Å¿orts of Natural Knowledge as well as in Geometry and AÅ¿tronomy,
as of the Weight and Spring of the Air, of the Chymical Experiments that have Å¿hown
us a way of making Liquors that Å¿hall Å¿hine in the Dark, and with gentle moving Å¿hall
burn of themÅ¿elves. I might mention the Circulation of the Blood through the Veins
and Arteries, which was underÅ¿tood indeed before; but now, by the help of the MicroÅ¿cope,
has an ocular demonÅ¿tration
[
99
]
in the Tails of Å¿ome FiÅ¿hes: of the Generation of Animals, which now is found to be
performed no otherwiÅ¿e than by the Seed of one of the Å¿ame kind; and that in the Seed
of the Male are diÅ¿coverâd, by the help of GlaÅ¿Å¿es, Millions of Å¿prightly little Animals,
which itâs probable are the very Offspring of the Animals themÅ¿elves: a Å¿urpriÅ¿ing
thing, and never before now known!

The Planets have, thoâ not theÅ¿e Å¿ame, yet as uÅ¿eful Inventions.
Thus have I put together all theÅ¿e late DiÅ¿coveries of our Earth: and now, thoâ perhaps
Å¿ome of them may be common to the Planetary Inhabitants with us, yet that they Å¿hould
have all of them is not credible. But then they may have Å¿omewhat to make up that
Defect, others as good and as uÅ¿eful, and as wonderful, that we want. We have allowâd
that they may have rational Creatures among them, and Geometricians, and MuÅ¿icians:
We have provâd that they live in Societies, have Hands and Feet, are guarded with
HouÅ¿es and Walls: Wherefore if a Man could be carried thither by Å¿ome powerful Genius,
Å¿ome
Mercury
, I donât
[
100
]
doubt âtwould be a very curious Å¿ight, curious beyond all Imagination, to Å¿ee the
odd ways, and the unuÅ¿ual manner of their Å¿etting about any thing, and their Å¿trange
methods of living. But Å¿ince thereâs no hopes of our going Å¿uch a Journey, we muÅ¿t
be contented with whatâs in our Power: we may Å¿uppoÅ¿e our Å¿elves there, and inquire
as far as we can into the AÅ¿tronomy of each Planet, and Å¿ee in what manner the Heavens
preÅ¿ent themÅ¿elves to their Inhabitants. We Å¿hall make Å¿ome ObÅ¿ervations of the Eminence
of each of them, in reÅ¿pect of their Magnitude, and number of Moons they have to wait
on them; and Å¿hall propoÅ¿e a new Method of coming to Å¿ome Knowledge of the incredible
diÅ¿tance of the Å¿ixâd Stars. But firÅ¿t after this long and deep ThoughtfulneÅ¿s we
will give our Å¿elves a little ReÅ¿t, and Å¿o put an end to this Book.

New Conjectures concerning the Planetary Worlds.

BOOK the Second.

âTwas a pretty many Years ago that I chancâd to light upon
AthanaÅ¿ius Kircher
âs Book, callâd
The EcÅ¿tatick Journey
, which treats of the nature of the Stars, and of the Things that are to be found
in the Superficies of the Planets: I wondered to Å¿ee nothing there of what I had often
thought not improbable, but quite other Things, nothing but a Heap of idle unreaÅ¿onable
Stuff: which I was the more confirmâd in, when, after the writing of the former part,
I ran over the Book again. And I thought mine were very conÅ¿iderable and weighty Matters
if comparâd with
Kircher
âs. That other People may be Å¿atisfied in this, and Å¿ee how vainly thoÅ¿e, who caÅ¿t
off the only Foundations of Probability in Å¿uch Matters, which we have all the way
made uÅ¿e of, pretend to philoÅ¿ophize
[
102
]
in this caÅ¿e, I think it will not be beÅ¿ide the PurpoÅ¿e to beÅ¿tow Å¿ome few Reflections
upon that Book.

Kircher
âs Journey in EcÅ¿tacy examinâd
.
That ingenious Man Å¿uppoÅ¿ing himÅ¿elf carried by Å¿ome Angel throâ the vaÅ¿t Spaces
of Heaven, and round the Stars, tells us, he Å¿aw a great many things, Å¿ome of which
he had out of the Books of AÅ¿tronomers, the reÅ¿t are the Product of his own Fancy
and Thoughts. But, before he enters upon his Journey, he lays down theÅ¿e two Things
as certain; that no Motion muÅ¿t be allowed the Earth, and that God has made nothing
in the Planets, no not Å¿o much as Herbs, which has either Life or SenÅ¿e in it. Leaving
then the SyÅ¿tem of
Copernicus
, he chuÅ¿es
Tycho
for his Guide. But when he Å¿uppoÅ¿es all the fixâd Stars to be Suns, and round each
of them places their Planets, here (againÅ¿t his Will I Å¿uppoÅ¿e) he has unawares made
an infinite number of
Copernican
SyÅ¿tems. All which, beÅ¿ide their own Motion, he abÅ¿urdly makes to be carried, with
an incredible Å¿wiftneÅ¿s, in twenty four Hours round the Earth. Since moÅ¿t
[
103
]
of theÅ¿e Worlds are out of the Reach of any Manâs Å¿ight, as he owns they are, I cannot
think for what purpoÅ¿e he makes Å¿o many Suns to Å¿hine upon deÅ¿olate Lands (like our
Earth in every thing, he Å¿ays, only that they have neither Plants nor Animals) where
thereâs no one to whom they Å¿hould give light. And from hence he Å¿till falls into
more and more AbÅ¿urdities. And becauÅ¿e he could find no other uÅ¿e of the Planets,
even in our SyÅ¿tem, he is forcâd to beg Help of the AÅ¿trologers; and would have all
thoÅ¿e vaÅ¿t Bodies made upon no other account than that the whole UniverÅ¿e might be
preÅ¿erved and continue Å¿ecure by their means, and that they might govern the Mind
of Man by their various and regular Influences. Accordingly, to gratify AÅ¿trology,
he Å¿ays that
Venus
was the moÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ant Place, every thing fine and handÅ¿ome, its Light gentle, its
Waters Å¿weet and purling, and it Å¿elf beÅ¿et all about with Å¿hining ChryÅ¿tals. In
Jupiter
he found wholeÅ¿ome and Å¿weet Gales, delicate Waters, and a Land Å¿hining like Silver.
For from
[
104
]
theÅ¿e two Planets it Å¿eems, Men have all that is happy and healthful poured down upon
them; and all that renders them handÅ¿ome and lovely, wiÅ¿e and grave, is owing to their
Influences.
Mercury
had I donât know what AirineÅ¿s and BriskneÅ¿s in it; whence Men derive, when they
are firÅ¿t born, all their Wit and Cunning.
Mars
was nothing but infernal, Å¿tinking, black Flames and Smoke: and
Saturn
was all melancholy, dreadful, naÅ¿ty, and dark: for theÅ¿e are the Planets (I donât
know why, but all Fortune-tellers hate them) that bring all the Plagues and MiÅ¿chiefs
that we feel upon us, and would exerciÅ¿e their Spite Å¿till more, unleÅ¿s they were
Å¿ometimes mitigated and corrected by the benign and kind Influences of the other Planets.
All this and Å¿uch like Stuff his Genius teaches him. Which he makes give a Å¿erious
AnÅ¿wer to this idle QueÅ¿tion, Whether a Jew or Heathen could be duly and rightly baptized
in the Waters of
Venus
? Of him too he learns that the Heaven of the fixâd Stars is not made of Å¿olid Matter,
but of a thin fluid,
[
105
]
wherein an innumerable company of Stars and Suns lie floating here and there, not
chainâd down to any Place, (thus far heâs in the right) and deÅ¿cribing in the Space
of a Day theÅ¿e prodigious Circles round the Earth. He forgets here, if there were
Å¿uch a Motion, with what an incredible Å¿wiftneÅ¿s they would fly off from every part
of their Orbits. But I Å¿uppoÅ¿e the Intelligences that he has placâd in them are to
take care of that, thoÅ¿e Angels that preÅ¿ide over, and regulate their Motions. And
in that he follows a company of Doctors that harbourâd that idle fancy of
AriÅ¿totle
upon no Account or ConÅ¿ideration. But
Copernicus
has freed thoÅ¿e Intelligences of all that Labour and Trouble, only by bringing in
the Motion of the Earth: which, if upon no other Account, every one that is not blind
purpoÅ¿ely, muÅ¿t own to be neceÅ¿Å¿ary upon this. I dare Å¿ay
Kircher
, if he had darâd freely to Å¿peak his Mind, could have afforded us better Å¿ort of
Things than theÅ¿e. But when he could not have that liberty, I think he might as well
have
[
106
]
let the whole Matter alone. But enough of this; letâs have have done with this famous
Author: And now that we have venturâd to place Spectators in the Planets, let us examine
each of them, and Å¿ee what their Years, Days, and AÅ¿tronomy are.

The SyÅ¿tem of the Planets in
Mercury.
To begin with the innermoÅ¿t and neareÅ¿t the Sun: We know that
Mercury
is three times nearer that vaÅ¿t Body of Light than we are. Whence it follows that
they Å¿ee him three times bigger, and feel him nine times hotter than we do. Such a
degree of Heat would be intolerable to us, and Å¿et afire all our dryâd Herbs, our
Hay and Straw that we uÅ¿e. And yet there is no doubt but that the Animals there, are
made of Å¿uch a Temper, as to be but moderately warm, and the Plants Å¿uch as to be
able to endure the Heat. The Inhabitants of
Mercury
, itâs likely, have the Å¿ame opinion of us that we have of
Saturn
, that we muÅ¿t be
intolerably
cold, and have little or no Light, we are Å¿o far from the Sun. Thereâs reaÅ¿on to
doubt, whether the Inhabitants of
Mercury
, thoâ they live Å¿o much nearer
[
107
]
the Sun, the Fountain of Life and Vigour, are much more airy and ingenious than we.
For if we may gueÅ¿s at them by what we Å¿ee here, we Å¿hall not be obliged to grant
it. The Inhabitants of
Africa
and
BraÅ¿il
, that have got for their Share the hotteÅ¿t Places in the Earth, being neither Å¿o
wiÅ¿e nor Å¿o induÅ¿trious as thoÅ¿e that belong to colder and more temperate Climates;
they have Å¿carce any Arts or Knowledge among them; and thoÅ¿e of them that live upon
the very Shore, underÅ¿tand little or no Navigation. Nor can I be willing to make all
that vaÅ¿t number that muÅ¿t inhabit thoÅ¿e two large Planets,
Jupiter
and
Saturn
, and have Å¿uch noble Attendance, mere dull Blockheads, or without as much Wit as
our Å¿elves, thoâ they are Å¿o far more diÅ¿tant from the Sun. The AÅ¿tronomy of thoÅ¿e
that live in
Mercury
, and the appearance of the Planets to them, oppoÅ¿ite at certain times to the Sun,
may be eaÅ¿ily conceived by the Scheme of the
Copernican
SyÅ¿tem in the former Part. At the times of theÅ¿e OppoÅ¿itions
Venus
and the Earth muÅ¿t needs
[
108
]
appear very bright and large to them. For if
Venus
Å¿hines Å¿o gloriouÅ¿ly to us when Å¿he is new and horned, Å¿he muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily in oppoÅ¿ition
to the Sun, when Å¿he is full, be at leaÅ¿t Å¿ix or Å¿even times larger, and a great deal
nearer to the Inhabitants of
Mercury
, and afford them Light Å¿o Å¿trong and bright, that they have no reaÅ¿on to complain
of their want of a Moon. What the Length of their Days are, or whether they have different
SeaÅ¿ons in the Year, is not yet diÅ¿covered, becauÅ¿e we have not yet been able to obÅ¿erve
whether his Axis have any inclination to his Orbit, or what Time he Å¿pends in his
diurnal Revolution about his own Axis. And yet Å¿eeing
Mars
, the Earth,
Jupiter
and
Saturn
, have certainly Å¿uch SucceÅ¿Å¿ions, thereâs no reaÅ¿on to doubt but that he has his
Days and Nights as well as they. But his Year is Å¿carce the fourth part Å¿o long as
ours.

The Inhabitants of
Venus
have much the Å¿ame Face of Things as thoÅ¿e in
Mercury
, only they never Å¿ee him in oppoÅ¿ition to the Sun, which is occaÅ¿ioned
[
109
]
by his never removing above 38 degrees, or thereabouts, from it. The Sun appears to
them larger by half in his Diameter, and above twice in his Circumference, than to
us: and by conÅ¿equence affords them but twice as much Light and Heat, Å¿o that they
are nearer our Temperature than
Mercury
. Their Year is compleated in Å¿even and a half of our Months. In the Night our Earth,
when âtis on the other Å¿ide of the Sun from
Venus
, muÅ¿t needs Å¿eem much larger and lighter to
Venus
than Å¿he doth ever to us; and then they may eaÅ¿ily Å¿ee, if their Eyes be not weaker
than ours, our conÅ¿tant Attendant the Moon. I have often wonderâd that when I have
viewâd
Venus
when Å¿he is neareÅ¿t to the Earth, and reÅ¿embled an Half-moon, juÅ¿t beginning to have
Å¿omething like Horns, through a TeleÅ¿cope of 45 or 60 Foot long, Å¿he always appeared
to me all over equally lucid, that I canât Å¿ay I obÅ¿erved Å¿o much as one Spot in her,
thoâ in
Jupiter
and
Mars
, which Å¿eem much leÅ¿s to us, they are very plainly perceivâd.
[
110
]
For if
Venus
had any Å¿uch Thing as Sea and Land, the former muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily Å¿how much more obÅ¿cure
than the other, as anyone may Å¿atisfy himÅ¿elf, that from a very high Mountain will
but look down upon our Earth. I thought that perhaps the too brisk Light of
Venus
might be the occaÅ¿ion of this equal appearance; but when I uÅ¿ed an Eye-glaÅ¿s that
was Å¿mokâd for the PurpoÅ¿e, it was Å¿till the Å¿ame Thing. What then, has
Venus
no Sea, or do the Waters there reflect the Light more than ours do, or their Land
leÅ¿s? Or rather (which is moÅ¿t probable in my Opinion) is not all that Light we Å¿ee
reflected from an AtmoÅ¿phere Å¿urrounding
Venus
, which being thicker and more Å¿olid than that in
Mars
or
Jupiter
, hinders our Å¿eeing any thing of the Globe it Å¿elf, and is at the Å¿ame time capable
of Å¿ending back the Rays that it receives from the Sun? For it is certain that if
we looked on the Earth from the outÅ¿ide of the AtmoÅ¿phere, we Å¿hould not perceive
Å¿uch a difference as we do from a Mountain; but by reaÅ¿on of the interpoÅ¿ed
[
111
]
AtmoÅ¿phere, we Å¿hould obÅ¿erve very little DiÅ¿parity between Sea and Land. âTis the
Å¿ame Thing that hinders us from Å¿eeing the Spots in the Moon as plain in the Day as
in the Night, becauÅ¿e the Vapours that Å¿urround the Earth being then
enlightenâd
by the Rays of the Sun, are an Impediment to our ProÅ¿pect.

In
Mars.
But
Mars
, as I Å¿aid before, has Å¿ome Parts of him darker than other Å¿ome. By the conÅ¿tant
Returns of which his Nights and Days have been found to be of about the Å¿ame length
with ours. But the Inhabitants have no perceivable Difference between Summer and Winter,
the Axis of that Planet having very little or no Inclination to his Orbit, as has
been diÅ¿coverâd by the Motion of his Spots. Our Earth muÅ¿t appear to them almoÅ¿t as

Venus
doth to us, and by the Help of a TeleÅ¿cope will be found to have its Wane, IncreaÅ¿e,
and Full, like the Moon: and never to remove from the Sun above 48 Degrees, by whoÅ¿e
DiÅ¿covery they Å¿ee it, as well as
Mercury
and
Venus
, Å¿ometimes paÅ¿s over the Sunâs Disk. They as Å¿eldom Å¿ee
[
112
]
Venus
as we do
Mercury
. I am apt to believe, that the Land in
Mars
is of a blacker Colour than that of
Jupiter
or the Moon, which is the reaÅ¿on of his appearing of a Copper Colour, and his reflecting
a weaker Light than is proportionable to his diÅ¿tance from the Sun. His Body, as I
obÅ¿erved before, thoâ farther from the Sun, is leÅ¿s than
Venus
. Nor has he any Moon to wait upon him, and in that, as well as
Mercury
and
Venus
, he muÅ¿t be acknowledged inferiour to the Earth. His Light and Heat is twice, and
Å¿ometimes three times leÅ¿s than ours, to which I Å¿uppoÅ¿e the ConÅ¿titution of his Inhabitants
is anÅ¿werable.

Jupiter
and
Saturn
the moÅ¿t eminent of the Planets both for bigneÅ¿s and attendants
.
If our Earth can claim pre-eminence of the fore-mentionâd Planets, for having a Moon
to attend upon it, (for its Magnitude can make but a Å¿mall difference) how much Superiour
muÅ¿t
Jupiter
and
Saturn
be to thoÅ¿e three and the Earth alÅ¿o? For whether we conÅ¿ider their Bulk, in which
they far exceed all the others, or the Number of Moons that wait upon them, itâs very
probable that they are the chief, the
[
113
]
primary Planets in our SyÅ¿tem, in compariÅ¿on with which the other four are nothing,
and Å¿carce worth mentioning. For the eaÅ¿ier Conception of their vaÅ¿t DiÅ¿parity, I
have thought fit to add a Scheme of our Earth, with the Moonâs Orbit, and the Globe
of the Moon itÅ¿elf, and the SyÅ¿tems of
Fig. 3.

Jupiter
and
Saturn
, where I have drawn every thing as near the true Proportion as poÅ¿Å¿ible.
Jupiter
you Å¿ee is adorned with four, and
Saturn
with five Moons, all placed in their reÅ¿pective Orbits. The Moons about
Jupiter
we owe to
GalilÃ¦o
, âtis well known: and any one may imagine he was in no Å¿mall Rapture at the DiÅ¿covery.
The outermoÅ¿t but one, and brighteÅ¿t of
Saturn
âs, it chancâd to be my lot, with a TeleÅ¿cope not above 12 foot long, to have the
firÅ¿t Å¿ight of in the Year 1655. The reÅ¿t we may thank the induÅ¿trious
CaÅ¿Å¿ini
for, who uÅ¿ed the GlaÅ¿Å¿es of
JoÅ¿. Campanus
âs grinding, firÅ¿t of 36, and afterwards of 136 foot long. He has often, and particularly
in the Year 1672, Å¿hewâd me the Third and Fifth. The FirÅ¿t and Second he gave
[
114
]
me notice of by Letters in the Year 1684; but they are Å¿carce ever to be Å¿een, and
I canât poÅ¿itively Å¿ay, I had ever that HappineÅ¿s; but am as Å¿atisfied that they are
there, as if I had; not in the leaÅ¿t Å¿uÅ¿pecting the Credit of that worthy Man. Nay,
I am afraid there are One or Two more Å¿till behind, and not without reaÅ¿on. For between
the Fourth and Fifth thereâs a DiÅ¿tance not at all proportionable to that between
all the others: Here, for ought I know, there may be a Sixth; or perhaps there may
be
another
without the Fifth that may yet have eÅ¿caped us: for we can never Å¿ee the Fifth but
in that part of his Orbit, which is towards the WeÅ¿t: for which we Å¿hall give you
a very good reaÅ¿on.

Perhaps when
Saturn
comes into the Northern Signs, and is at a good height from the Horizon (for at the
writing of this he is at his loweÅ¿t) you may happen to make Å¿ome new DiÅ¿coveries,
good Brother, if you would but make uÅ¿e of your two TeleÅ¿copes of 170 and 210 Foot
long; the longeÅ¿t, and the beÅ¿t I believe now
[
115
]
in the World. For thoâ we have not yet had an opportunity of obÅ¿erving the Heavens
with them (as well by reaÅ¿on of their
UnwieldineÅ¿s
, as for the Interruption of our Studies by your AbÅ¿ence) yet I am Å¿atisfied of their
GoodneÅ¿s by our trial of them one Night, in reading a Letter at a vaÅ¿t diÅ¿tance by
the Help of a Light. I cannot but think of thoÅ¿e times with PleaÅ¿ure, and of our diverting
Labour in poliÅ¿hing and preparing Å¿uch GlaÅ¿Å¿es, in inventing new Methods and Engines,
and always puÅ¿hing forward to Å¿till greater and greater Things. But to return to the
Figures, of which there remains Å¿omething further to be Å¿aid.

The proportion of the Diameter of
Jupiter,
and of the Orbs of his
Satellites,
to the Orbit of the Moon round the Earth
.
I have there made the Diameter of
Jupiter
about two third parts of our diÅ¿tance from the Moon: for the Diameter of
Jupiter
is above twenty times bigger than that of the Earth; which is about a thirtieth part
of the Moonâs diÅ¿tance. The Orbit of the outermoÅ¿t of
Jupiter
âs Satellites is to that of the Moon round the Earth, as 8 and Â½ is to 1. And each
of theÅ¿e Moons, by the Shadow they make upon
Jupiter
,
[
116
]
cannot be leÅ¿s than our Earth. Their
The Periods of
Jupiter
âs Moons
.
Periods, that I may not omit them, are according to
CaÅ¿Å¿ini
âs Account theÅ¿e. That of the inmoÅ¿t is one day, 18 hours, 28 minutes, and 36 Å¿econds.
The Second Å¿pends 3 days, 13 hours, 13 min.
,
52 Å¿econds in going round him. The Third 7 days, 3 hours, 59 min.
,
40 Å¿ec. The Fourth 16 days, 18 hours, 5 min.
,
6 Å¿ec. The DiÅ¿tance of the innermoÅ¿t from
Jupiter
himÅ¿elf is 2â
 of his Diameters. That of the Second is 4 and a half: Of the Third
7 and one Å¿ixth part: Of the Fourth 12 and two thirds, of the Å¿ame
And

âs

Diameters. The InnermoÅ¿t of
Saturn
âs Satellites moves round him in 1 day, 21 hours, 18 min.
,
31 Å¿ec. The Second in 2 days, 17 hours, 41 min.
,
27 Å¿ec. The Third in 4 days, 13 hours, 47 min.
,
16 Å¿ec. The Fourth in 15 days, 22 hours, 41 min.
,
11 Å¿ec. The Fifth in 79 days, 7 hours, 53 min.
,
57 Å¿ec. Their DiÅ¿tances from the Center of
Saturn
are, that of the firÅ¿t almoÅ¿t one, that is 39 fortieth parts of the Diameter of his
Ring; that of the Å¿econd one and a quarter of thoÅ¿e Diameters;
[
117
]
of the third one and three quarters of them; of the fourth four, or according to my
Calculation, but 3 and a half; of the 5th 12, which were found with vaÅ¿t Pains and
Labour.

Now can any one look upon, and compare theÅ¿e SyÅ¿tems together, without being amazed
at the vaÅ¿t Magnitude and noble Attendance of theÅ¿e two Planets, in reÅ¿pect of this
little Earth of ours? Or can they force themÅ¿elves to think, that the wiÅ¿e Creator
has diÅ¿poÅ¿ed of all his Animals and Plants here, has furniÅ¿hâd and adornâd this Spot
only, and has left all thoÅ¿e Worlds bare and deÅ¿titute of Inhabitants, who might adore
and worÅ¿hip him; or that all thoÅ¿e prodigious Bodies were made only to twinkle to,
and be Å¿tudied by Å¿ome few perhaps of us poor Mortals?

This proportion true according to all modern ObÅ¿ervations.
I do not doubt but there will be Å¿ome who will think we are very much miÅ¿taken about
the Magnitude of theÅ¿e Planets. For will you pretend to make them who are taken up
in admiring the LargeneÅ¿s of this Globe,
[
118
]
its multitude of Nations, Cities, and Empires; can you pretend I Å¿ay to make them
ever believe that there are Places in compariÅ¿on of which the Earth is as inconÅ¿iderable
as this Figure would make it? But they ought to be informâd, that theÅ¿e Proportions
are thoÅ¿e which the beÅ¿t AÅ¿tronomers of this Age have agreed upon. For if the Earth
be diÅ¿tant from the Sun ten or eleven thouÅ¿and of its own Diameters, according to
the Accounts of MonÅ¿ieur
CaÅ¿Å¿ini
in
France
, and Mr.
FlamÅ¿ted
in
England
, wherein they made uÅ¿e of very exact ObÅ¿ervations of the Parallaxes of
Mars
; or if, according to a very probable Conjecture of mine, it be diÅ¿tant twelve thouÅ¿and,
then the Magnitudes of the other Orbs will very near anÅ¿wer the Proportions here Å¿ettled.

The apparent magnitude of the Sun in
Jupiter,
and a way of finding what Light they there enjoy
.
But to return to
Jupiter
. The Sun appears to them who are upon it five times leÅ¿s than to us, and conÅ¿equently
they have but the five and twentieth part of the Light and Heat that we receive from
it. But that Light is not Å¿o weak as we imagine, as is
[
119
]
plain by the BrightneÅ¿s of that Planet in the Night; and alÅ¿o from hence, that when
the Sun is Å¿o far eclipÅ¿ed to us, as that only the 25th part of his Disk remains uncovered,
he is not Å¿enÅ¿ibly darkenâd. But if you have a mind exactly to know the Quantity of
Light that
Jupiter
enjoys, you may take a Tube of what Length you pleaÅ¿e. Let one end of it be cloÅ¿ed
with a Plate of BraÅ¿s, or any Å¿uch thing, in the middle of which there muÅ¿t be a Hole,
whoÅ¿e Breadth muÅ¿t have the Å¿ame proportion to the length of the Tube, as the Chord
of 6 Minutes bears to the Radius; that is, about as one is to 570. Let the Tube be
turned Å¿o to the Sun, that no Light may fall upon a white Paper placed at the End
of it, but what comes through the little Hole at the other end of the Tube. The Rays
that
come
through this will repreÅ¿ent the Sun upon the Paper of the Å¿ame BrightneÅ¿s that the
Inhabitants of
Jupiter
Å¿ee it in a clear Day. And if removing the Paper you place your Eye in the Å¿ame Place,
you will Å¿ee the Sun of the Å¿ame Magnitude and
[
120
]
BrightneÅ¿s as you would were you in Jupiter.

And in
Saturn.
If you make the Hole twice as little in breadth, you will Å¿ee the Å¿ame in
Saturn
. And althoâ his Light be but the hundredth part of ours, yet you Å¿ee it makes him
Å¿hine tolerably bright in a dark Night. But in both theÅ¿e Planets, if there ever be
any cloudy Days, it muÅ¿t be very dark in compariÅ¿on of us; yet without doubt the Inhabitants
have no more reaÅ¿on to complain of the want of Light, than our Owls and Batts, to
whom the Twilight or the Night itÅ¿elf is more agreeable than the BrightneÅ¿s of the
Day.

In
Jupiter
their days are five Hours
.
But itâs a little Å¿trange, that when
Jupiter
is Å¿o much bigger than our Planet, their Days and Nights Å¿hould be but five of our
Hours. By this we may Å¿ee that Nature has not obÅ¿ervâd that proportion that their
Bulk Å¿eems to require, Å¿eeing in
Mars
the Days are very little different from ours. But in the length of their Years, that
is, in the Revolution of the Planets round the Sun, there is an exact proportion to

[
121
]
their diÅ¿tances from the Sun followed. For as the Cubes of their DiÅ¿tances, Å¿o are
the Squares of their Revolutions, as
Kepler
firÅ¿t Å¿ound out. Which proportion the Moons of
Jupiter
and
Saturn
keep in their CourÅ¿es round thoÅ¿e
Always of the Å¿ame length.
Planets. As the Years and Days in
Jupiter
are different from ours in this reÅ¿pect, Å¿o are the Days in another; namely, that
they are all of the Å¿ame length. For they there enjoy a perpetual Equinox, their Axis
having little or no inclination to their Orbit, as the Earthâs has, as has been diÅ¿covered
by TeleÅ¿copes. The Countries that lie near their Poles have little or no Heat, by
reaÅ¿on the Rays of the Sun fall Å¿o obliquely upon them; but then they are freed from
the Inconveniency that ours are troubled with, of tedious long half-year Nights, and
have the conÅ¿tant returns of Day and Night every five Hours. Indeed Å¿uch Å¿hort Days
would not be agreeable to us, but we think our Å¿elves much better done by, that ours
are more than twice as long, thoâ upon no other account, but that whatever is our
own, we are apt to imagine, muÅ¿t be beÅ¿t.

[
122
]

The reÅ¿t of the Planets are Å¿o near the Sun (
Mars
himÅ¿elf never being above 18 degrees from it) that in
Jupiter
they have the Å¿ight only of
Saturn
. But we cannot deny but that their four Moons Å¿tand them in greater Å¿tead than our
one doth us, if âtwere only that they Å¿eldom know any Å¿uch Thing as to be without
MoonÅ¿hiny Nights. And they are of great Advantage to them, as we Å¿aid before, in their
Navigation, if they have any Å¿uch thing. Not to mention the pleaÅ¿ant Sights of their
frequent Conjunctions and EclipÅ¿es, Things that they are Å¿eldom a Day without.

Saturn
enjoys all thoÅ¿e PleaÅ¿ures and Advantages in a Å¿till higher Degree, as well for his
five Moons, as for the delightful ProÅ¿pect that the Ring about him affords his Inhabitants
Night and Day. But we will give an account of their AÅ¿tronomy, as we have done of
the reÅ¿t of the Planets.

They Å¿ee the fixâd Stars juÅ¿t as we do.
And firÅ¿t of all we Å¿hall obÅ¿erve what we might have remarkâd before, but which will
be more Å¿trange here, that the fixâd Stars appear to them of
[
123
]
the Å¿ame Figure and Magnitude, and with the Å¿ame degree of Light that they do to us:
and this, by reaÅ¿on of their immenÅ¿e diÅ¿tance, of which we Å¿hall have occaÅ¿ion to
Å¿peak by and by. In compariÅ¿on with which the Space that a Bullet-Å¿hot out of a Cannon
could travel in 25 Years, would be almoÅ¿t nothing.

Their AÅ¿tronomers have all the Å¿ame Signs of the Bear, the Lion, Orion, and the reÅ¿t,
but not turning upon the Å¿ame Axis with us: for thatâs different in all the Planets.

As
Jupiter
can Å¿ee no Planet but
Saturn
, Å¿o
Saturn
knows of no Planet but
Jupiter
; which appears to him much as
Venus
doth to us, never removing above 37 Degrees from the Sun. The Length of their Days
I cannot determine: But if from the DiÅ¿tance and Period of his innermoÅ¿t Attendant,
and comparing it with the innermoÅ¿t of
Jupiter
âs, a Man may venture to give a GueÅ¿s, they are very little different from
Jupiter
âs, 10 Hours or Å¿omewhat leÅ¿s. But whereas in
Jupiter
theÅ¿e are equally divided between
[
124
]
Light and DarkneÅ¿s, the Inhabitants of
Saturn
muÅ¿t perceive a more Å¿enÅ¿ible difference than we, eÅ¿pecially between Summer and Winter.
For our Axis inclines to the Plane of the Ecliptick but 23 degrees and a half
,
but thereâs above 31. Upon this Account his Moons muÅ¿t decline very much from the
Path that the Sun Å¿eems to move in, and his Inhabitants can never have a full Moon
but juÅ¿t at the Equinoxes; Two of which fall out in 30 of our Years. âTis this PoÅ¿ition
of the Axis too that is the CauÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e delightful Appearances, and wonderful ProÅ¿pects
that its Inhabitants enjoy: For the better underÅ¿tanding of which I Å¿hall draw a Figure
of
Saturn
with his Ring about him: in which the Proportion between the Diameters of the Globe
and Ring is as 9 to 4. And the empty Space between them is of the Å¿ame Breadth with
the Ring itÅ¿elf. All ObÅ¿ervations conÅ¿pire to prove that That is of no great ThickneÅ¿s,
althoâ if we Å¿hould allow it Å¿ix hundred
German
Miles, I think, conÅ¿idering its Diameter, we Å¿hould not overdo the Matter.

SuppoÅ¿e then, agreeable to what has been Å¿aid, the Globe of
Saturn
,
Fig. 4.
whoÅ¿e Poles are A, B. G N is the Diameter of the Ring, as you view it Å¿ideways, repreÅ¿enting
a narrow Oval. ThoÅ¿e that live about the Poles within the Arches C A D, E B F, each
of which are 54 Degrees, (if the Cold will Å¿uffer any Body to live there) never have
a Sight of the Ring.
The Appearances of the Ring in
Saturn.
From all other parts it is continually to be Å¿een for fourteen Years and nine Months,
which is juÅ¿t half their Year. The other Half it is hid from their View. ThoÅ¿e then
that dwell between the Polar Circle C D, and the Equator T V, all that time that the
Sun enlightens the Part oppoÅ¿ite to them, have every Night the Sight of a Piece of
it H G L, much in the Shape of a Å¿hining Bow, which comes from the Horizon, but is
darkenâd in the Middle by the Shadow of
Saturn
G H, which reaches moÅ¿t commonly to the outermoÅ¿t Rim of it. But after Midnight that
Shadow by little and little begins to move towards the right Hand to thoÅ¿e in the
Northern, but the Left
[
126
]
to thoÅ¿e in the Southern HemiÅ¿phere. In the Morning it diÅ¿appears, leaving behind
it a LikeneÅ¿s indeed of a Bow, but much paler and weaker than our Moon is in the Day
time. For they, as I Å¿aid before, have an AtmoÅ¿phere, or an Air Å¿urrounding them enlightened
by the Sun. OtherwiÅ¿e Night and Day they would have their Ring, their Moons, and all
the fixâd Stars, equally conÅ¿picuous. Another thing that muÅ¿t make the Sight of their
Ring very curious, is, that by Å¿ome Spots in it, it is diÅ¿coverâd to turn round upon
it Å¿elf: A thing that thoÅ¿e that are Å¿o near cannot but take notice of, when we that
live at this DiÅ¿tance can deÅ¿cry a great Inequality, the inÅ¿ide of it being brighter
much than the outÅ¿ide is. When the Shadow of the Globe falls upon that part of the
Ring G H, the Shadow of the Ring at the Å¿ame time darkens another Part of the Globe
about P F, which otherwiÅ¿e would have the Sun upon it. So that there is always a Zone
of the Globe P Y F E, Å¿ometimes of a larger extent than at others, which is deprivâd
of the Sight
[
127
]
both of the Sun and Ring for a conÅ¿iderable time, the latter of which hides Å¿ome part
of the Stars from it too. And certainly an amazing Thing it muÅ¿t be, all of a Å¿udden
to have the Sun intercepted and to become as dark as
Midnight
, without Å¿eeing any CauÅ¿e of Å¿uch an Accident. All which time their Moons are their
only Comfort. The other half of the Year the HemiÅ¿phere T B V enjoys the Å¿ame Light
that T A U before did, and then this undergoes thoÅ¿e long EclipÅ¿es that That before
Å¿ufferâd. At the Equinoxes, when the Sun is in the Å¿ame Plane with the Ring, the Inhabitants
of
Saturn
cannot well perceive it: no not even we with our GlaÅ¿Å¿es, by reaÅ¿on of its DarkneÅ¿s.
This happens when
Saturn
, viewâd from the Sun, is advanced one and twenty degrees and a half in
Virgo
or
PiÅ¿ces
, as I have Å¿howâd formerly in my SyÅ¿tem of
Saturn
: Where there is an Account given of the RiÅ¿ings of the Sun above the Ring, throughout
all the Saturnian Year.

[
128
]

With
Saturn
in this Scheme you have the Globes of the Earth and Moon drawn in their true proportion,
to put you in mind again of a Thing worth
remembring
,
viz.
how very Å¿mall our Habitation is when comparâd with that Globe or the Ring about
it. And now any one, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, can frame to himÅ¿elf a Picture of the Night in
Saturn
, with two Arches of the Ring, and five Moons Å¿hining about, and adorning him. This
then is what I had to Å¿ay to the primary Planets.

We are now come a little lower, to make an enquiry into the Attendants of theÅ¿e Planets,
eÅ¿pecially our own. And here we Å¿hall not only conÅ¿ider their AÅ¿tronomy, but Å¿hall
alÅ¿o Å¿earch into their Furniture and Ornament, if they are found to have any Å¿uch
thing, which we have deferred conÅ¿idering till now.

Very little to be Å¿aid of the Moon.
And here one would think that when the Moon is Å¿o near us, and by the Means of a
TeleÅ¿cope may be Å¿o nicely and exactly obÅ¿ervâd, it Å¿hould afford us Matter for more
probable
[
129
]
Conjectures than any of the other remote Planets. But it is quite otherwiÅ¿e, and I
can Å¿carce find any thing to Å¿ay of it, becauÅ¿e I have not a Planet of the Å¿ame Nature
before my Eyes, as in all the primary ones I have. For they are of the Å¿ame kind with
our Earth; and Å¿eeing all the Actions, and every thing that is here, we may make a
reaÅ¿onable Conjecture at what we cannot Å¿ee in thoÅ¿e Worlds.

The Guards of
Jupiter
and
Saturn
of the Å¿ame nature with our Moon
.
But this we may venture to Å¿ay, without fear, that all the Attendants of
Jupiter
and
Saturn
are of the Å¿ame Nature with our Moon, as going round them, and being carried with
them round the Sun juÅ¿t as the Moon is with the Earth. Their LikeneÅ¿s reaches to other
Things too, as youâll Å¿ee by and by. Therefore whatÅ¿oever we can with reaÅ¿on affirm
or conjecture of our Moon (and we may Å¿ay a little of it) muÅ¿t be Å¿upposâd with very
little Alteration to belong to the Satellites of
Jupiter
and
Saturn
, as having no reaÅ¿on to be at all inferior to that.

The Moon hath Mountains.
The Surface of the Moon then is found, by the leaÅ¿t TeleÅ¿copes of about
[
130
]
three or four Foot, to be diverÅ¿ified with long Tracts of Mountains, and again with
broad Valleys. For in thoÅ¿e Parts oppoÅ¿ite to the Sun you may Å¿ee the Shadows of the
Mountains, and often diÅ¿cover the little round Valleys between them, with a Hillock
or two perhaps riÅ¿ing out of them.
Kepler
from the exact roundneÅ¿s of them would prove that they are Å¿ome vaÅ¿t work of the
rational Inhabitants. But I canât be of his mind, both for their incredible LargeneÅ¿s,
and that they might eaÅ¿ily be occaÅ¿ioned by natural CauÅ¿es. Nor can I find any thing
like Sea there, thoâ he and many others are of the contrary Opinion I know. For thoÅ¿e
vaÅ¿t Countries which appear darker than the other, commonly taken for and called by
the Names of Seas, are diÅ¿coverâd with a good long TeleÅ¿cope, to be full of little
round Cavities; whoÅ¿e Shadow falling within themÅ¿elves, makes them appear of that
Colour: and thoÅ¿e large Champains there in the Moon you will find not to be always
even and Å¿mooth, if you look carefully
[
131
]
upon them: neither of which two
But no Sea.
Things can agree to the Sea. Therefore thoÅ¿e Plains in her that Å¿eem brighter than
the other Parts, muÅ¿t conÅ¿iÅ¿t, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, of a whiter Å¿ort of Matter than they. Nor
do I believe
Nor Rivers.
that there are any Rivers, for if there were, they could never eÅ¿cape our Sight,
eÅ¿pecially if they run between the Hills as ours do. Nor have they
Nor Clouds.
any Clouds to furniÅ¿h the Rivers with Water: For if they had, we Å¿hould Å¿ometimes
Å¿ee one part of the Moon darkened by them, and Å¿ometimes another, whereas we have
always the Å¿ame ProÅ¿pect of her.

Nor Air, and Water.
âTis certain moreover, that the Moon has no Air or AtmoÅ¿phere Å¿urrounding it as we
have. For then we could never Å¿ee the very outermoÅ¿t Rim of the Moon Å¿o exactly as
we do, when any Star goes under it, but its Light would terminate in a gradual faint
Shade, and there would be a Å¿ort of a Down as it were about it; not to mention that
the Vapours of our AtmoÅ¿phere conÅ¿iÅ¿t of Water, and conÅ¿equently that where there
are no Seas
[
132
]
or Rivers, there can be no AtmoÅ¿phere. This is that notable difference between the
Moon and us that hinders all probable Conjectures about it. If we could but once be
Å¿ure that there were Seas and Rivers in it, it would be no weak Argument to prove
that it has alÅ¿o all other Furniture which belongs to our Earth, and the Opinion of

Xenophanes
might be true, that it has its Inhabitants, Cities, and Mountains. But as âtis, I
cannot imagine how any Plants or Animals, whole whole nouriÅ¿hment comes from liquid
Bodies, can thrive in a dry, waterleÅ¿s, parchâd Soil.

The Conjecture of its Plants and Animals very dubious.
What then,
is
it credible that this great Ball was made for nothing but to give us a little Light
in the Night-time, or to raiÅ¿e our Tides in the Sea? May there not be Å¿ome People
there that may have the PleaÅ¿ure of Å¿eeing our Earth turn upon itÅ¿elf, preÅ¿enting
them Å¿ometimes with a ProÅ¿pect of
Europe
and
Africa
, and then of
AÅ¿ia
and
America
; Å¿ometimes half of it bright, and Å¿ometimes full? And muÅ¿t all thoÅ¿e Moons round

Jupiter
and
Saturn

[
133
]
be condemned to the Å¿ame
UÅ¿eleÅ¿neÅ¿s
? I do not know what to Å¿ay concerning it, becauÅ¿e I know of nothing like them to
found a Conjecture upon. And yet âtis not improbable that thoÅ¿e great and noble Bodies
have Å¿omewhat or other growing and living upon them, though very different from what
we Å¿ee and enjoy here. Perhaps their Plants and Animals may have another Å¿ort of NouriÅ¿hment
there. Perhaps the MoiÅ¿ture of the Earth there is but juÅ¿t Å¿ufficient to cauÅ¿e a MiÅ¿t
or Dew, which may be very Å¿uitable to the Growth of their Herbs. This I remember is

Plutarch
âs Opinion, in his Dialogue upon this Subject. For in our Earth a very little Water
drawn from the Sea into Dew, and falling down again upon the Herbs, would be Å¿ufficient
for all our Needs, without any Rain or Showers. But theÅ¿e are mere GueÅ¿Å¿es, or rather
Doubts, but yet they are the
Jupiter
âs and
Saturn
âs Moons turn always the Å¿ame Side to them
.
beÅ¿t we can make of this, and all thoÅ¿e other Moons: for, as I Å¿aid before, they
are all of the Å¿ame nature, which is proved likewiÅ¿e by this, that as our
[
134
]
Moon can afford us the Sight never but of one Side of her, Å¿o they turn always the
Å¿ame Face to their primary Planets. It may perhaps Å¿eem Å¿trange, how we Å¿hould come
to know this; but âtis no hard matter, after that ObÅ¿ervation which I juÅ¿t now made,
that the outermoÅ¿t of
Saturn
âs Moons can never be Å¿een but when Å¿he is on the WeÅ¿t-Å¿ide of her Planet. The reaÅ¿on
of which is plainly this, that one Side of her is darker, and does not reflect the
Light Å¿o much as the other, which when it is turned towards us, we cannot Å¿ee by reaÅ¿on
of its weak Light. This always happening when âtis EaÅ¿t of him, and never on the other
Side, is a manifeÅ¿t proof that Å¿he always keeps the Å¿ame Side toward
Saturn
. Now Å¿ince the outermoÅ¿t of
Saturn
âs and our Moon carry themÅ¿elves thus to the Planets round which they move, who can
well doubt it of all the reÅ¿t round
Jupiter
and
Saturn
? And thereâs a very good reaÅ¿on for it, namely, that the matter of which thoÅ¿e Moons
conÅ¿iÅ¿t, being heavier, and more Å¿olid on the Side that is averÅ¿e from us, than on

[
135
]
that which we have the Sight of, does conÅ¿equently fly with a greater force from the
Centre of its Orbit: for otherwiÅ¿e, according to the Laws of Motion, it Å¿hould turn
the Å¿ame Side always, not to its Planets, but to the Å¿ame fixâd Stars.

This PoÅ¿ition of the Moons, in reÅ¿pect of their Planets, muÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion a great many
very Å¿urprizing Appearances to their Inhabitants, if they have any, which is very
doubtful, but may for the preÅ¿ent be Å¿upposâd. An enquiry into our Moon may Å¿erve
for all the reÅ¿t. Its Globe is divided into two Parts, in Å¿uch a manner, that thoÅ¿e
who live on one Side never loÅ¿e the Å¿ight of us, and thoÅ¿e on the other never enjoy
it. Except only Å¿ome few who live on the Confines of each of theÅ¿e, who loÅ¿e us, and
Å¿ee us again by turns. The Earth to them muÅ¿t Å¿eem
The AÅ¿tronomy of the Inhabitants of the Moon.
much larger than the Moon doth to us, as being in Diameter above four times bigger.
But that which is moÅ¿t Å¿urprizing, is, that Night and Day they Å¿ee it always in the
very Å¿ame part of the Heaven, as if it never moved: Å¿ome of them as if âtwas falling

[
136
]
upon their Heads: others Å¿omewhat above the Horizon, and others always in the Horizon,
Å¿till turning upon it Å¿elf, and preÅ¿enting them every twenty Å¿our Hours with a View
of all its Countries, even of thoÅ¿e that lie near the Poles (I could wiÅ¿h my Å¿elf
in the Moon only for the Å¿ight of them) yet unknown and undiÅ¿covered by us. They have
it in its monthly Wane and IncreaÅ¿e, they Å¿ee it half, and horned, and full, by turns,
juÅ¿t as we do the Body of the Moon. But the Light that they receive of us is five
times larger than what we receive from them. So that in dark Nights that part that
hath the Advantage of being towards us, receives a very glorious Light from us, thoâ

Kepler
thought otherwise. Their Days are always of the Å¿ame Length with their Nights; and
the Sun riÅ¿ing and Å¿etting to them but once in one of our Months, makes the time both
of their Light and DarkneÅ¿s to be equal to 15 of our Days. If their Bodies were of
the Å¿ame Materials with ours, thoÅ¿e that have the Sun pretty high in their Horizon,
would be almoÅ¿t roaÅ¿ted
[
137
]
in Å¿uch long Days. For the Sun is not farther from them than he is from us. This will
be the CaÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e that live upon the Borders of the two HemiÅ¿pheres we mentioned;

middle of their Summer, in their Days of three Months length, they very often find
it extreme Cold. I call thoÅ¿e the Poles of the Moon, round which the fixâd Stars Å¿eem

the Ecliptick, although they move round theÅ¿e latter, at the diÅ¿tance of five Degrees,
in a period of nineteen Years. Their Year they count by the Motion of the Stars, and
their return to the Sun, and âtis the Å¿ame with ours. They can eaÅ¿ily do it, becauÅ¿e
they have the Stars Day and Night, notwithÅ¿tanding the Light of the Sun: for they
have no AtmoÅ¿phere (which is the only reaÅ¿on that we donât every
[
138

Day enjoy the Å¿ame Sight) to hinder their ObÅ¿ervations. Nor have they any Clouds to
obÅ¿truct their View, Å¿o that it is eaÅ¿ier for them to find out the CourÅ¿es of the
Planets, but more difficult to make a true SyÅ¿tem of them. For they will be apt to
lay a wrong Foundation, by Å¿uppoÅ¿ing that their Earth Å¿tands Å¿till, which will lead
them into more dangerous Errors than

ever it did us. All that I have Å¿aid belongs as well to
Jupiter
âs and
Saturn
âs Satellites as to our Moon, in reÅ¿pect of the Planets they move round. The Length
of their Day and Night is always equal to the Time of their Revolution: For example,
the fifth Moon moves round
Saturn
in 80 Days, and the Days and Nights there are equal to Forty of ours. Both their
Summer and Winter (
Saturn
moving round the Sun in thirty Years) are fifteen Years long. Therefore it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible
but that their way of living muÅ¿t be very different from ours, having Å¿uch tedious
Winters, and Å¿uch long watching and Å¿leeping times.

Having thus explained the primary and Å¿econdary Planets round the Sun, we Å¿hould next
Å¿et about the third Sort, the Sun and fixâd Stars; but before we do that, it would
be worth while to Å¿et before you at once, in a clearer and more plain Method than
hitherto, the Magnificence and Fabrick of the Solar SyÅ¿tem. Which we canât poÅ¿Å¿ibly
do in Å¿o Å¿mall a Space as one of our Leaves will but admit of, becauÅ¿e the Bodies
of the Planets are Å¿o prodigiouÅ¿ly Å¿mall in companion of their Orbs. But what is wanting
in Figure Å¿hall be made up in Words. Going back then to the firÅ¿t Scheme, Å¿uppoÅ¿e
another

BigneÅ¿s as the 2d Figure Å¿hows you. Let all the other Planets be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed every one
in his own Orbit, and in the middle of all the Sun, of the Å¿ame BigneÅ¿s that That
Figure repreÅ¿ents,
[
140

namely, about four Inches in Diameter. And then the Orbit or Circle in which the Earth
moves, which the AÅ¿tronomers call the
Magnus Orbis
, muÅ¿t have about Å¿ix and thirty Foot in Semidiameter. In which the Earth muÅ¿t be
conceived moving, not bigger than a grain of Millet, and her Companion the Moon Å¿carcely
perceivable, moving round her in a Circle a little more than two Inches Diameter,
as in
Fig. 5.
the Figure here adjoined, where the Line A B repreÅ¿ents a Å¿mall portion of that Circle
which the Earth moves in: the Å¿mall Circle therein C is the Earth, and the Circle
D E the Path of the Moon round it, in which the Body of the Moon is D.

The outermoÅ¿t of
Saturn
âs Moons moves in an Orbit whoÅ¿e Semidiameter is 29 Inches; that of
Jupiter
in a Å¿omewhat Å¿maller, whoÅ¿e Semidiameter is 19 and a quarter.

And thus we have a true and exact DeÅ¿cription of the Sunâs Palace, where the Earth
will be Twelve thouÅ¿and of its Semidiameters diÅ¿tant from him, which in
German
Miles makes above
[
141
]
Å¿eventeen Millions. But perhaps we may have a clearer ComprehenÅ¿ion of this vaÅ¿t Length,
by comparing it with Å¿ome very Å¿wift Motion after the Example of
HeÅ¿iod
the Poet, who imaginâd that an Anvil let fall from the Top of Heaven, reachâd the
Earth the tenth Day of its Journey, and in ten more arrivâd at the Bottom of Hell,
the end of it: Å¿o making the Earth the mid-way between Heaven and Hell. I Å¿hanât make
uÅ¿e of the Anvil, but of Å¿omething as good, namely, a Bullet Å¿hot out of a great Gun,
which may travel perhaps in a Moment, or PulÅ¿e of an Artery, about a hundred Fathom,
as is proved by thoÅ¿e Experiments that
MerÅ¿ennus
in a TreatiÅ¿e of his relates; by which the Sound was found to extend itÅ¿elf eighty
hundredth parts in the

Å¿ame time. I Å¿ay then, that Å¿uppoÅ¿ing a Bullet to move with this SwiftneÅ¿s from the
Earth to the Sun, it would Å¿pend 25 Years in its PaÅ¿Å¿age. To make a Journey from
Jupiter
to the Sun, would require 125, and from
Saturn
thither 250 Years. This account depends upon the meaÅ¿ure of the Earthâs
[
142
]
Diameter, which, according to the accurate ObÅ¿ervations of the
French
, is 6538594 times Å¿ix
Paris
Feet, one Degree being 57060 of that MeaÅ¿ure. This Å¿hows us how vaÅ¿t thoÅ¿e Orbs muÅ¿t
be, and how inconÅ¿iderable this Earth, the Theatre upon which all our mighty DeÅ¿igns,
all our Navigations, and all our Wars are tranÅ¿acted, is when compared to them. A
very fit ConÅ¿ideration, and Matter of Reflection, for thoÅ¿e Kings and Princes who
Å¿acrifice the Lives of Å¿o many People, only to flatter their Ambition in being MaÅ¿ters
of Å¿ome pitiful Corner of this Å¿mall Spot. But to return to the matter in hand, now
we have given you an account of the Sunâs proportion to thoÅ¿e Orbs and Bodies, weâll
Å¿ee what more we can Å¿ay of him.

No ground for Conjecture in the Sun.
And Å¿ome have thought it not improbable but that the Sun himÅ¿elf has alÅ¿o his Inhabitants.
But upon what reaÅ¿on I cannot imagine, there being leÅ¿s ground for a Probability in
him than in the Moon. For we are not yet Å¿ure, whether he be a Å¿olid or liquid Globe;
althoâ, if my Notion of Light
[
143
]
be true, upon that account I Å¿hould rather think him liquid: which his RoundneÅ¿s and
equal diÅ¿tribution of his Light to all parts are an Argument for. For that very Å¿mall
inequality on his Surface, which is diÅ¿covered by the TeleÅ¿copes, (and that not always
neither) which makes Men fancy they Å¿ee boiling Seas and belching Mountains of Fire,
is nothing but the trembling Motion of the Vapours our AtmoÅ¿phere is full of near
the Earth; which is likewiÅ¿e

the CauÅ¿e of the Stars twinkling. Nor could I ever have the Luck to diÅ¿cern thoÅ¿e
bright Spots in the Sun which they boaÅ¿t as much of as they do of his dark ones, which
latter I have very often Å¿een; Å¿o that I have very good ReaÅ¿on to doubt whether there
be any thing in the Sun brighter than the Sun itÅ¿elf. For by the moÅ¿t exact ObÅ¿ervations,
I could never find any Å¿uch pretended to be Å¿een any where but juÅ¿t about his dark
Spots; and it is no great wonder that thoÅ¿e Parts which are Å¿o near the darker, Å¿hould
appear Å¿omewhat

brighter than the reÅ¿t. That the Sun is extremely hot and fiery, is beyond
[
144
]
all diÅ¿pute, and Å¿uch Bodies as ours could not live one Moment in Å¿uch a Furnace.
We muÅ¿t Å¿uppoÅ¿e a new Å¿ort of Animals then, Å¿uch as we have no Idea or LikeneÅ¿s of
among us, Å¿uch as we can neither imagine nor conceive: which is as much as to Å¿ay,
that we can make no SuppoÅ¿ition at all about them. No doubt that glorious and vaÅ¿t
Body was made for Å¿ome noble End and UÅ¿e, and framâd with excellent DeÅ¿ign. And I
think we all very well know and feel its UÅ¿efulneÅ¿s in that effuÅ¿ion of Light and
Heat to all the Planets round it; in the PreÅ¿ervation and HappineÅ¿s of all living
Creatures, and that not only in our Ball, but in thoÅ¿e vaÅ¿t Globes of
Jupiter
and
Saturn
, not contemptible when compared with its own. TheÅ¿e are Å¿uch great, Å¿uch wiÅ¿e Ends,
that it is not Å¿trange that the Sun Å¿hould have been made, if it had been only upon
their account. For, as for
Kepler
âs Fancy, that he hath another Office, namely, to help on the Motion of the Planets
in their own Orbs, by turning about his own Axis (which he would fain eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h in
his Epitome of the
Copernican

[
145
]
SyÅ¿tem) I Å¿hall give good ReaÅ¿ons why I cannot aÅ¿Å¿ent to it.

The Å¿ixâd Stars so many Suns.
Before the Invention of TeleÅ¿copes, it Å¿eemed to contradict
Copernicus
âs Opinion, to make the Sun one of the fixâd Stars. For the Stars of the firÅ¿t Magnitude
being eÅ¿teemâd to be about three Minutes Diameter; and
Copernicus
(obÅ¿erving that thoâ the Earth changed its Place, they always kept the Å¿ame diÅ¿tance
from us) having venturâd to Å¿ay that the
Magnus Orbis
was but a Point in reÅ¿pect of the Sphere in which they were placed, it was a plain
ConÅ¿equence that every one of them that appeared any thing bright, muÅ¿t be larger
than the Path or Orbit of the Earth: which is very abÅ¿urd. This is the principal Argument
that
Tycho Brahe
Å¿et up againÅ¿t
Copernicus
. But when the TeleÅ¿copes took away thoÅ¿e Rays of the Stars which appear when we look
upon them with our naked Eye, (which they do beÅ¿t when the Eye-glaÅ¿s is blackâd with
Smoke) they Å¿eemed juÅ¿t like little Å¿hining Points, and then that Difficulty vaniÅ¿hed,
and the Stars may yet be Å¿o many Suns. Which is
[
146
]
the more probable, becauÅ¿e their Light is certainly their own: for itâs impoÅ¿Å¿ible
that ever the Sun Å¿hould Å¿end, or they reflect it at Å¿uch a vaÅ¿t DiÅ¿tance. This is
the Opinion that commonly goes along with
Copernicus
âs SyÅ¿tem.
They are not all in the Å¿ame Sphere.
And the Patrons of it do alÅ¿o with reaÅ¿on Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that all theÅ¿e Stars are not in
the Å¿ame Sphere, as well becauÅ¿e thereâs no Argument for it, as that the Sun, which
is one of them, cannot be brought to this Rule. But itâs more likely they are Å¿catterâd
and diÅ¿persâd all over the immenÅ¿e Spaces of the Heaven, and are as far diÅ¿tant perhaps
from one another, as the neareÅ¿t of them are from the Sun.

Here again too I know
Kepler
is of another Opinion in his Epitome of
Copernicus
âs SyÅ¿tem, that we mentionâd above. For thoâ he agrees with us, that the Stars are
diffusâd through all the vaÅ¿t ExpanÅ¿e of the Heavens, yet he cannot allow that they
have as large an empty Space about them as our Sun has. For then âtwas his Opinion,
we Å¿hould Å¿ee but very few, and thoÅ¿e of very different Magnitudes:
For, Å¿eeing
[
147
]
the largeÅ¿t of all appear Å¿o Å¿mall to us, that we can Å¿carce obÅ¿erve or meaÅ¿ure them
with our beÅ¿t InÅ¿truments; how muÅ¿t thoÅ¿e appear that are three or four times farther
from us? Why, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing them no larger than theÅ¿e, they muÅ¿t Å¿eem three or four times
leÅ¿s, and Å¿o on âtill a little farther they will not be to be Å¿een at all: Thus we
Å¿hall have the Å¿ight of but very few Stars, and thoÅ¿e very different one from
another
; Whereas we have above a ThouÅ¿and, and thoÅ¿e not conÅ¿iderably bigger or leÅ¿s than
one another. But this by no means proves what he would have it; and his MiÅ¿take was
chiefly, that he did not conÅ¿ider the Nature of Fire and Flame which may be Å¿een at
Å¿uch diÅ¿tances, and at Å¿uch Å¿mall Angles as all other Bodies would totally diÅ¿appear
under. A thing that we need go no farther than the Lamps Å¿et along the Streets to
prove. For althoâ they are a hundred Foot from one another, yet you may count Twenty
of them in a continued Row with your Eyes, and yet the twentieth Part of them Å¿carce
makes an Angle of Å¿ix Seconds. Certainly
[
148
]
then the glorious Light of the Stars muÅ¿t do much more than this; Å¿o that itâs no
wonder we Å¿hould Å¿ee a ThouÅ¿and or two of them with our bare Eyes, and with a TeleÅ¿cope
diÅ¿cover twenty times that number. But
Kepler
had a private DeÅ¿ign in making the Sun thus Å¿uperiour to all the other Stars, and
planting it in the Middle of the World, attended with the Planets: For his Aim was
hereby to Å¿trengthen his CoÅ¿mographical MyÅ¿tery, that the DiÅ¿tances of the Planets
from the Sun are in a certain proportion to the Diameters of the Spheres that are
inÅ¿cribed within, and circumÅ¿cribed about
Euclid
âs Regular Bodies. Which could never be Å¿o much as probable, except there were but
one Chorus of Planets moving round the Sun, and Å¿o the Sun were the only one of his
kind.

But that whole MyÅ¿tery is nothing but an idle Dream taken from
Pythagoras
or
Plato
âs PhiloÅ¿ophy. And the Author himÅ¿elf acknowledges that the Proportions do not agree
Å¿o well as they Å¿hould, and is fain to invent two
[
149
]
or three very Å¿illy ExcuÅ¿es for it. And he uÅ¿es yet poorer Arguments to prove that
the UniverÅ¿e is of a Å¿pherical Figure, and that the Number of the Stars muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily
be finite, becauÅ¿e the Magnitude of each of them is Å¿o. But what is worÅ¿t of all is,
that he Å¿ettles the Space between the Sun and the Concavity of the Sphere of the fixâd
Stars, to be Å¿ix hundred thouÅ¿and of the Earthâs Diameters. For this reaÅ¿on, which
he has no Foundation for, that as the Diameter of the Sun is to that of the Orbit
of
Saturn
, which he makes to be as 1 to 2000, Å¿o is this Diameter to that of the Sphere of
the fixed Stars. I cannot but wonder how Å¿uch things as theÅ¿e could fall from Å¿o ingenious
a Man, and Å¿o great an AÅ¿tronomer. But I muÅ¿t be of the Å¿ame Opinion with all the
greateÅ¿t PhiloÅ¿ophers of our Age, that the Sun is of the Å¿ame Nature with the fixâd
Stars. And this will give us a greater Idea of the World, than all thoÅ¿e other Opinions.

The Stars have Planets about them like our Sun.
For then why may not every one of theÅ¿e Stars or Suns have as great a Retinue as
our Sun, of Planets, with their
[
150
]
Moons, to wait upon them? Nay, thereâs a manifeÅ¿t reaÅ¿on why they Å¿hould. For if we
imagine our Å¿elves placed at an equal diÅ¿tance from the Sun and fixâd Stars; we Å¿hould
then perceive no difference between them. For, as for all the Planets that we now
Å¿ee attend the Sun, we Å¿hould not have the leaÅ¿t glimpÅ¿e of them, either becauÅ¿e their
Light would be too weak to affect us, or that all the Orbs in which they move would
make up one lucid Point with the Sun. In this Station we Å¿hould have no occaÅ¿ion to
imagine any difference between the Stars, and Å¿hould make no doubt if we had but the
Sight, and knew the Nature of one of them, to make that the Standard of all the reÅ¿t.
We are then placâd near one of them, namely, our Sun, and Å¿o near as to diÅ¿cover Å¿ix
other Globes moving round him, Å¿ome of them having others performing them the Å¿ame
Office. Why then may not we make uÅ¿e of the Å¿ame Judgment that we would in that caÅ¿e;
and conclude, that our Star has no better attendance than the others? So that
[
151
]
what we allowed the Planets, upon the account of our enjoying it, we muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e
grant to all thoÅ¿e Planets that Å¿urround that prodigious number of Suns. They muÅ¿t
have their Plants and Animals, nay and their rational Creatures too, and thoÅ¿e as
great Admirers, and as diligent ObÅ¿ervers of the Heavens as our Å¿elves; and muÅ¿t conÅ¿equently
enjoy whatÅ¿oever is Å¿ubÅ¿ervient to, and requiÅ¿ite for Å¿uch Knowledge.

What a wonderful and amazing Scheme have we here of the magnificent VaÅ¿tneÅ¿s of the
UniverÅ¿e! So many Suns, Å¿o many Earths, and every one of them Å¿tockâd with Å¿o many
Herbs, Trees, and Animals, and adornâd with Å¿o many Seas and Mountains! And how muÅ¿t
our Wonder and Admiration be
increaÅ¿ed
when we conÅ¿ider the prodigious DiÅ¿tance and Multitude of the Stars?

That their DiÅ¿tance is Å¿o immenÅ¿e, that the Space between the Earth and Sun (which
is no leÅ¿s than Twelve thouÅ¿and of the Earthâs Diameters) is almoÅ¿t nothing when comparâd
to it, has more Proofs than one to confirm
[
152
]
it. And this among the reÅ¿t. If you obÅ¿erve two Stars near one another, as for example
thoÅ¿e in the middle of the Great Bears Tail, differing very much from one another
in ClearneÅ¿s, notwithÅ¿tanding our changing our PoÅ¿ition in our Annual Orbit round
the Sun, and that there would be a Parallax were the Star which is brighter nearer
to us than the other, as is very probable it is, yet whatever Part of the Year you
look upon them, they will not in the leaÅ¿t have altered their diÅ¿tance. ThoÅ¿e that
have hitherto undertook to calculate their DiÅ¿tance, have not been able perfectly
to compaÅ¿s their DeÅ¿ign, by reaÅ¿on of the extreme NiceneÅ¿s and almoÅ¿t ImpoÅ¿Å¿ibility
of the ObÅ¿ervations requiÅ¿ite for their PurpoÅ¿e. The only Method that I Å¿ee remaining,
to come at any tolerable Probability in Å¿o difficult a CaÅ¿e, I Å¿hall here make uÅ¿e
of. Seeing then that the Stars, as I Å¿aid before, are Å¿o many Suns, if we do but Å¿uppoÅ¿e
one of them equal to ours, it will follow that its diÅ¿tance from us is as much greater
than that of the Sun, as its apparent
[
153
]
Diameter is leÅ¿s than the Diameter of the Sun. But the Stars, even thoÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t
Magnitude, though viewâd through a TeleÅ¿cope, are Å¿o very Å¿mall, that they Å¿eem only
like Å¿o many Å¿hining Points, without any perceivable Breadth. So that Å¿uch ObÅ¿ervations
can here do us no good. When
A way of making a probable gueÅ¿s at the diÅ¿tance of the Stars.
I Å¿aw this would not Å¿ucceed, I Å¿tudied by what way I could Å¿o leÅ¿Å¿en the Diameter
of the Sun, as to make it not appear larger than the Dog, or any other of the chief
Stars. To this purpoÅ¿e I closâd one End of my twelve-foot Tube with a very thin Plate,
in the Middle of which I made a Hole not exceeding the twelfth Part of a Line, that
is the hundred and forty fourth Part of an Inch. That End I turnâd to the Sun, placing
my Eye at the other, and I could Å¿ee Å¿o much of the Sun as was in Diameter about the
182d part of the Whole. But Å¿till that little piece of him was brighter much than
the Dog-Å¿tar is in the cleareÅ¿t Night. I Å¿aw that this would not do, but that muÅ¿t
leÅ¿Å¿en the Diameter of the Sun a great deal more. I made
[
154
]
then Å¿uch another Hole in a Plate, and againÅ¿t it I placâd a little round GlaÅ¿s that
I had made uÅ¿e of in my MicroÅ¿copes, of much about the Å¿ame Diameter with the former
Hole. Then looking again towards the Sun (taking care that no Light might come near
my Eye to hinder my ObÅ¿ervation) I found it appeared of much the Å¿ame ClearneÅ¿s with

Sirius
. But caÅ¿ting up my account, according to the Rules of
Dioptricks
, I found his Diameter now was but 1â152 part of that hundred and eighty Å¿econd part
of his whole Diameter that I Å¿aw through the former Hole. Multiplying 1â152 and 1â182
into one another, the Product I found to be 1â27664â. The Sun therefore being contracted
into Å¿uch a CompaÅ¿s, or being removed Å¿o far from us (for itâs the Å¿ame thing) as
to make his Diameter but the 27664 part of that we every Day Å¿ee, will Å¿end us juÅ¿t
the Å¿ame Light as the Dog-Å¿tar now doth. And his diÅ¿tance then from us will be to
his preÅ¿ent diÅ¿tance undoubtedly as 27664 is to 1; and his Diameter little above four
Thirds, 4â´. Seeing
[
155
]
then
Sirius
is Å¿uppoÅ¿ed equal to the Sun, it follows that his Diameter is likewiÅ¿e 4â´, and that
his DiÅ¿tance to the DiÅ¿tance of the Sun from us is as 27664 to 1. And what an incredible
DiÅ¿tance that is, will appear by the Å¿ame way of reaÅ¿oning that we uÅ¿ed in meaÅ¿uring
that of the Sun. For if 25 Years are required for a Bullet out of a Cannon, with its
utmoÅ¿t SwiftneÅ¿s, to travel from the Sun to us; then by multiplying the Number 27664
into 25, we Å¿hall find that Å¿uch a Bullet would Å¿pend almoÅ¿t Å¿even hundred thouÅ¿and
Years in its Journey between us and the neareÅ¿t of the fixâd Stars. And yet when in
a clear Night we look upon them, we cannot think them above Å¿ome few Miles over our
Heads. What I have here enquirâd into, is concerning the neareÅ¿t of them. And what
a prodigious Number muÅ¿t there be beÅ¿ides of thoÅ¿e which are placed in the vaÅ¿t Spaces
of Heaven, as to be as remote from theÅ¿e as theÅ¿e are from the Sun! For if with our
bare Eyes we can obÅ¿erve above a ThouÅ¿and, and with a TeleÅ¿cope can
[
156
]
diÅ¿cover ten or twenty times as many; what bounds of Number can we Å¿et to thoÅ¿e which
are out of the Reach even of theÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tances! eÅ¿pecially if we conÅ¿ider the infinite
Power of God. Really, when I have been reflecting thus with my Å¿elf, me-thoughts all
our Arithmetick was nothing, and we are versâd but in the very Rudiments of Numbers,
in compariÅ¿on of this great Sum. For this requires an immenÅ¿e TreaÅ¿ury, not of twenty
or thirty Figures only, in our decuple ProgreÅ¿Å¿ion, but of as many as there are Grains
of Sand upon the Shore. And yet who can Å¿ay, that even this Number exceeds that of
the Fixâd Stars? Some of the Ancients, and
Jordanus Brunus
carryâd it further, in declaring the Number infinite: he would perÅ¿wade us that he
has provâd it by many Arguments, thoâ in my opinion they are none of them concluÅ¿ive.
Not that I think the contrary can ever be made out. Indeed it Å¿eems to me certain,
that the UniverÅ¿e is infinitely extended; but what God has been pleasâd to place beyond
the Region of
[
157
]
the Stars, is as much above our Knowledge, as it is beyond our Habitation.

Or what if beyond Å¿uch a determinate Space he has left an infinite Vacuum; to Å¿how,
how inconÅ¿iderable all that he has made is, to what his Power could, had he Å¿o pleasâd,
have produced? But I am falling, before I am aware, into that intricate DiÅ¿pute of
Infinity: Therefore I Å¿hall wave this, and not, as Å¿oon as I am free of one, take
upon me another difficult Task. All that I Å¿hall do more is to add Å¿omewhat of my
Opinion concerning the whole World, as it is a Place for the Reception of the Suns
or fixâd Stars, every one of which, I have Å¿howed, may have their Planetary SyÅ¿tems
about them.

Every Sun has a Vortex round it, very different from thoÅ¿e of
Cartes.
I am of Opinion then that every Sun is Å¿urrounded with a Whirl-pool or Vortex of
Matter in a very Å¿wift Motion; thoâ not in the leaÅ¿t like
Cartes
âs either in their Bulk, or manner of Motion. For
Cartes
makes his Å¿o large, as every one of them to touch all the others round them, in a
flat Surface, juÅ¿t as you have Å¿een the Bladders that
[
158
]
Boys blow up in Soap-Å¿uds do; and would have the whole Vortex to move round the Å¿ame
way. But the Angles of every Vortex will be no Å¿mall hindrance to Å¿uch a Motion. Then
the whole Matter moving round at once, upon the Axis as it were of a Cylinder, did
not a little puzzle him in giving ReaÅ¿ons for the RoundneÅ¿s of the Sun: which however
they may Å¿atisfy Å¿ome People that do not conÅ¿ider them, really prove nothing of the
Matter. In this Ã¦thereal Matter the Planets float, and are carried round by its Motion:
and the thing that keeps them in their own Orbs is, that they themÅ¿elves, and the
Matter in which they Å¿wim, equally Å¿trive to fly off from the Center of this Motion.
AgainÅ¿t all which there are many AÅ¿tronomical Objections, Å¿ome of which I touchâd
upon in my EÅ¿Å¿ay of the CauÅ¿es of Gravity. Where I gave another Account of the Planets
not deÅ¿erting their own Orbs; which is their Gravitation towards the Sun. I Å¿howâd
there the CauÅ¿es of that Gravitation, and cannot but wonder that
[
159
]
Cartes
, the firÅ¿t Man that ever began to talk reaÅ¿onably of that Matter, Å¿hould never meddle
with, or light on it.
Plutarch
in his Book of the Moon above-mentioned Å¿ays, that Å¿ome of the Ancients were of Opinion,
that the ReaÅ¿on of the Moonâs keeping her Orbit was, that the Force of her Circular
Motion was exactly equal to her Gravity, the one of which pullâd her to, as much as
the other forcâd off from the Centre. And in our Age
AlphonÅ¿us Borellus
, who was of this Å¿ame Opinion in the other Planets as well as the Moon, makes the
Gravitation of the primary Planets to be towards the Sun, as that of the Secondary
is towards the Planets round which they move: Which Sir
IÅ¿aac Newton
has more fully explainâd, with a great deal of Pains and Subtilty; and how from that
CauÅ¿e proceeds the Ellipticity of the Orbs of the Planets, found out by
Kepler
. According to my Notion of the Gravitation of the Planets to the Sun, the Matter
of his Vortex muÅ¿t not at all move the Å¿ame

way, but after Å¿uch a manner as to have its Parts carryâd different ways on all Sides.
And yet there is no fear of its being deÅ¿troyed by Å¿uch an irregular Motion, becauÅ¿e
the Ãther round it, which is at reÅ¿t, keeps the Parts of it from flying out. With
the Help of Å¿uch a Vortex as this I have undertook in that EÅ¿Å¿ay to explain the Gravity
of Bodies on this Earth, and all the Effects of it. And I Å¿uppoÅ¿e there may be the
Å¿ame CauÅ¿e as well of the Gravitation of the Planets, and of our Earth among the reÅ¿t,
towards the Sun, as of their RoundneÅ¿s: A Thing Å¿o very hard to give an Account of
in
Cartes
âs SyÅ¿tem.

I muÅ¿t differ from him too in the BigneÅ¿s of the Vortices, for I cannot allow them
to be Å¿o large as he would make them. I would have them diÅ¿perÅ¿ed all about the immenÅ¿e
Space, like Å¿o many little Whirl-pools of Water, that one makes by the Å¿tirring of
a Stick in any large Pond or River, a great way diÅ¿tant from one another. And as their
Motions do not all intermix
[

]
or communicate with one another, Å¿o in my Opinion muÅ¿t the Vortices of Stars be placed
as not to hinder one
anothers
free Circumrotations.

So that we may be Å¿ecure, and never fear that they will Å¿wallow up or deÅ¿troy one
another; for that was a mere Fancy of
Cartes
âs, when he was a Å¿howing how a fixâd Star or Sun might be turnâd into a Planet. And
âtis plain that when he writ it, he had no Thoughts of the immenÅ¿e DiÅ¿tance of the
Stars from one another; particularly, by this one Thing, that he would have a Comet
as Å¿oon as ever it comes into our Vortex, to be Å¿een by us. Which is as abÅ¿urd as
can be. For how could a Star, which gives us Å¿uch a vaÅ¿t Light only from the Reflection
of the Beams of the Sun, as he himÅ¿elf owns they do; how I Å¿ay could that be Å¿o plainly
Å¿een at a diÅ¿tance Ten thouÅ¿and times larger than the Diameter of the Earthâs Orbit?
He could not but know that all round the Sun there is a vaÅ¿t
ExtenÅ¿um
; Å¿o vaÅ¿t, that in
Copernicus
âs SyÅ¿tem the
[
162
]
magnus Orbis
is counted but a Point in compariÅ¿on with it. But indeed all the whole Story of Comets
and Planets, and the Production of the World, is founded upon Å¿uch poor and trifling
Grounds, that I have often wonderâd how an ingenious Man could Å¿pend all that pains
in making Å¿uch Fancies hang together. For my part, I Å¿hall be very well contented,
and Å¿hall count I have done a great Matter, if I can but come to any Knowledge of
the Nature of Things, as they now are, never troubling my Å¿elf about their Beginning,
or how they were made, knowing that to be out of the reach of human Knowledge, or
even Conjecture.

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CELESTIAL WORLDS DISCOVER'D ***

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting

same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from

you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

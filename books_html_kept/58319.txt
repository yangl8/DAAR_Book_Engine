PREFACE

It
is a rare privilege to stand as we do at the
meeting-point of the centuries, bidding a reluctant
farewell to the old, while simultaneously we cry
âAll hail!â to the new; first looking back over
the open book of the past, then straining eager
eyes for a glimpse of the mysteries that the future
holds hidden, and which are to be revealed only
moment by moment, hour by hour, and day by
day.

The nineteenth century, so preÃ«minently one
of progress in almost every line of mental and
material activity, has witnessed a marvelous growth
in the paper industry. It was in the early years
of the century that crude old methods, with their
meager machinery, began yielding to the pressure
of advanced thought, and the development since
has kept full pace with the flying years. The
hundred years that have written the modern history
of paper-making mark also the period during
which the
J.Â W. Butler Paper Company
, or its
immediate predecessors, have been associated with
viii

the industry in this country. It has therefore
seemed to the present representatives of the company
that the closing year of the century was an
especially fitting time to put into story form the
history of the wonderful and valuable product
evolved almost wholly from seemingly useless
materials, and they consider it their privilege, as
well as the fulfillment of a pleasant obligation, to
present this account to their friends and associates
in the paper, printing, and auxiliary trades. We

âKnow not what the future hath

Of marvel and surprise,â

but we feel confident that the incoming century
will bring changes and improvements as wonderful
as any the past has wrought, and we hope that it
may be our good fortune to in some measure be
instrumental in promoting whatever tends to a
greater development of the industry with which
our name has been so long associated.

CHAPTER I

ARTICLES EARLY USED FOR PURPOSES NOW
SUPPLIED BY PAPER

Full of dignity, significance, and truth is the
noble conception which finds expression in Tennysonâs
verse, that we are the heirs of the ages, the
inheritors of all that has gone before us.

â¦
We are the heirs of the ages
â¦

Through countless cycles of time men have
been struggling and aspiring; now âmounting up
with wings, as eagles,â now thrown back to earth
by the crushing weight of defeat, but always rising
again, undaunted and determined. âThe fathers
have wrought, and we have entered into the reward
of their labors.â We have profited by their
striving and aspiration. All the wisdom of the
past, garnered by patient toil and effort, all the
wealth of experience gained by generations of
men through alternating defeat and triumph,
belongs to us by right of inheritance. It has
been truly said, âWe are what the past has made
us. The results of the past are ourselves.â

â¦
Tradition untrustworthy
â¦

But to what agency do we owe the preservation
of our inheritance? What conservator has
2

kept our rich estate from being scattered to the
four winds of heaven? For the wealth that is
ours to-day we are indebted in large measure to
manâs instinctive desire, manifested in all ages,
to perpetuate his knowledge and achievements.
Before the thought of a permanent record had
begun to take shape in menâs minds, oral tradition,
passing from father to son, and from
generation to generation, sought to keep alive the
memory of great achievements and valorous
deeds. But tradition proved itself untrustworthy.
Reports were often imperfect, misleading, exaggerated.
Through dull ears, the spoken words
were received into minds beclouded by ignorance,
and passed on into the keeping of treacherous
memories. As the races advanced in learning and
civilization, they realized that something more
permanent and accurate was necessary; that without
written records of some sort there could be
little, if any, progress, since each generation must
begin practically where the preceding one had
begun, and pass through the same stages of ignorance
and inexperience.

â¦
Hieroglyphic records
â¦

In this strait, men sought help from Nature,
and found in the huge rocks and bowlders shaped
by her mighty forces a means of perpetuating
3

notable events in the histories of nations and the
lives of individuals. From the setting up of
stones to commemorate great deeds and solemn
covenants, it was but a step to the hewing of obelisks,
upon which the early races carved their
hieroglyphs, rude pictures of birds and men, of
beasts and plants. As early as four thousand
years before Christ, these slender shafts of stone
were reared against the deep blue of the Egyptian
sky, and for ages their shadows passed with
the sun over the restless, shifting sands of the
desert. Most of the ancient obelisks have
crumbled to dust beneath Timeâs unsparing hand,
but a few fragmentary specimens are still in
existence, while the British Museum is so fortunate
as to be in possession of one shaft of black
basalt that is in perfect condition. A part of it
is covered with writing, a part with bas-reliefs. In
Egypt these hieroglyphs were employed almost
exclusively for religious writingsâa purpose suggested
by the derivation of the word itself, which
comes from the Greek,
ieros
, a priest, and
glypha
,
a carving.

â¦
Inscriptions on stone and clay
â¦

As the obelisk had taken the place of the rude
stones and unwieldy bowlders which marked
manâs first effort to solve an ever-recurring problem,
4

so it in turn was superseded. The temples
were sacred places, and especially fitted to become
the repositories of the records that were to preserve
for coming generations the deeds of kings
and priests. Accordingly, the pictured stories of
great events were graven on stone panels in the
temple walls, or on slabs or tablets of the same
enduring material. Then came a forward step to
the easier and cheaper method of writing on soft
clay. The monarchs, not being obliged to take
into consideration questions of ease or economy,
continued to make use of the stone tablets, but
private individuals usually employed clay, not
only for literary and scientific writings, but in their
business transactions as well. A careful baking,
either by artificial heat or in the burning rays of
a tropic sun, rendered the clay tablets very enduring,
so that many which have been dug from
ancient ruins are now in a remarkable state of
preservation, bearing letters and figures as clear as
any of the inscriptions on marble, stone, or metal
that have come to us from the splendid days
of Greece or Rome. The people of Assyria
and Chaldea recorded almost every transaction,
whether public or private in character, upon tablets
of clay, forming thus a faithful transcript of
5

their daily lives and occupations, which may be
read to-day by those who hold the key; thus
it is we bridge the gulf of centuries. From
the ruins of ancient Nineveh and Babylon,
records of almost every sort have been unearthed,
all inscribed on indestructible terra-cotta. There
are bank-notes and notes of hand, deeds of property,
public records, statements of private negotiations,
and memoranda of astronomical observations.
The life in which they played a part has
passed into history; the once proud and mighty
cities lie prostrate, and upon their ruins other
cities have risen, only to fall as they fell. The
terra-cotta to which they committed their records
is all that is left, and the tablets that were fashioned
and inscribed so long ago give to us the
best histories of Chaldea, Babylonia, and Assyria.

â¦
Assyrian, Babylonian and Chaldean records
â¦

One of the largest collections of these clay-writings
is now in the British Museum and was
taken from a great edifice in Assyria, which was
probably the residence of Sennacherib. Several
series of narratives are comprehended in the collection;
one referring to the language, legends, and
mythology of the Assyrians; another recording the
story of creation, in which âWater-deepâ is said
to be the creator of all forms of life then in existence,
6

while a third relates to the deluge and the
story of the Assyrian Moses. But however interesting
these facts may be in themselves, we
refer to them only by way of illustration, since
we are dealing not so much with the writing itself
as with the material on which writing was done.

â¦
Inscriptions on prisms
â¦

Another form of tablet, a somewhat singular
variation it may seem, was in use among the
Assyrians at a very early date. This was a prism,
having either six or eight sides, and made of exceedingly
fine terra-cotta. Such prisms were frequently
deposited by the Assyrian kings at the
corners of temples, after having been inscribed
with accounts of the notable events in their lives,
interspersed with numerous invocations. Apparently
the custom was similar to that followed at
the present day, and the ancient Assyrian tablets
no doubt served the same purpose as the records,
newspapers, and documents that are now deposited
in the corner-stones of public or other
important buildings. The prisms used as tablets
varied in length from a foot and a half to
three feet, and were covered very closely with
small writing. That the writersâ endeavor was to
make the most of the space at their disposal is
suggested by the fact that upon a prism found in
7

the ruins of the ancient city of Ashur the inscriptions
are so crowded that there are thirty lines in
the space of six inches, or five lines to the inch.
The prism recites the valiant deeds of Tiglath-Pileser
I., who reigned from 1120 to 1100
B.Â C.
,
and undertook campaigns against forty-two other
nations and their kings. He was a monarch
whose very name inspired terror among the surrounding
peoples, and his reign was filled with
stirring events and brilliant achievements.

â¦
Economy of space
â¦

Small
wonder that it was necessary to crowd the inscriptions
upon the prism! Rawlinsonâs âAncient
Monarchies,â in an account of the writings
that have come down to us from the earliest
days of the worldâs recorded history, has this to
say: âThe clay tablets are both numerous and
curious. They are of various sizes, ranging
from nine inches long by six and a half wide to
an inch and a half long by an inch wide, or even
less. Sometimes they are entirely covered by
writings, while at others they exhibit on a portion
of their surface impressions of seals, mythological
emblems, and the like. Some thousands
have been recovered. Many are historical, and
still more are mythological.â Their use in writing
and drawing was almost universal, and we read
8

that the prophet Ezekiel, when dwelling with
âthem of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by
the river of Chebar,â was commanded, âTake
thee a tile and lay it before thee, and portray upon
it the city, even Jerusalem.â (Ezekiel iv. 1.)

We get a glimpse of another side of that ancient
life in a tablet of Nile clay, preserved in the British
Museum, which is one of the earliest specimens
of writing now in existence. It is a proposal of
marriage, and was written about 1530
B.Â C.
, more
than thirty-four hundred years ago, by a Pharaoh
asking the hand of a daughter of the Babylonian
king. Forty years later, in 1491
B.Â C.
, the ten
commandments were graven on tablets of stone.

â¦
The works of Homer
â¦

In the early efforts of men to find a means of
preserving in lasting and convenient form the records
of their lives and achievements, some queer
materials were pressed into service. Plates of
metal were used, even the precious gold and
silver being employed for the purpose. Skins of
animals, tanned to a sort of leather, found favor
among many peoples, while their bones, and even
their intestines, were by no means disdained. The
works of Homer, preserved in one of the great
Egyptian libraries in the days of the Ptolemies,
were written in letters of gold on the skins of serpents.
9

Ivory was used, also wood and the bark
of trees. In the early days of Rome, the reports
of notable events were engraved on wooden tablets,
which were then exposed to view in public places,
and citizens of all classes, mingling freely, according
to custom, in the great Forum that was the
center of the cityâs life, were easily and quickly
informed of the important happenings of the day.
The greatest defect in this method was remedied
when, later on, wax was used to form a surface
upon the wood, thus admitting of corrections and
erasures, and making it possible to use the same
table indefinitely, simply by scraping off the coating
after it had served its purpose, and supplying
other coatings as they were needed. But the first
real advance toward modern writing materials
came in the use of the leaves of olive, palm, poplar,
and other trees, which were prepared by being cut
in strips, soaked in boiling water, and then rubbed
over wood to make them soft and pliable.

â¦
Old materials necessarily discarded
â¦

It will be readily understood, however, that
these crude materials and primitive methods could
not long keep pace with the steady march of
progress. The peoples of the earth were increasing
rapidly; they were advancing in the arts and
sciences, and in the experiences that inspire thought,
10

poetry, and philosophy; they had a heritage of
knowledge to which they were constantly adding,
while business transactions, together with other
deeds worthy of record, had greatly multiplied.
It was but natural that the materials which had once
been entirely adequate should now be discarded
as cumbersome and unfitted to the new conditions.
The sands in the hour-glass were beginning to run
golden; time was taking on a value unknown
before. A deed of land written in clay and put
away to bake might answer the purpose when real-estate
transfers were infrequent and attended with
much ceremony. A clay tablet might serve in a
marriage proposal by a king who had the power
to meet and vanquish all rivals, but terra-cotta was
not suited either for the record of numerous and
rapid business transactions or for the writing of
books. The biography of one man, or a single
treatise in philosophy, would have required a whole
building, while a library of modern dimensions,
as to the number of books, would probably have
left little room in a city for the dwellings of its
inhabitants.

â¦
Discovery of papyrus
â¦

What was to take the place of the old and cumbersome
materials? Even at a very early date
men were asking this question, and it was the good
11

fortune of Egypt to be able to give answer. Along
the marshy banks of the Nile grew a graceful
water-plant, now almost extinct, which was peculiarly
fitted to meet the new demands, as we shall
see in the succeeding chapter. The discovery of
its value led to an extensive industry, through
which the land of the Pharaohs was enabled to
take high rank in letters and learning, and, to
maintain a position of wealth, dignity, power, and
influence that otherwise would have been impossible,
even in those remote days when printing was
still many centuries beyond the thoughts or dreams
of men.

CHAPTER II

PAPYRUS AND PARCHMENT

â¦
The bulrush of the Nile
â¦

The graceful water-plant whose plumy, drooping
heads were swayed by the breezes that ruffled
the waters of the Nile was one of the most useful
plants known to Egypt, in whose commerce it
long held a leading place. As early as 2000
B.Â C.
,
or five hundred years before Moses led the children
of Israel out of bondage, there was made from
its smooth green stems a material called by the
same name, papyrus, a kind of crude paper, which
came into universal use, and was so valuable and
in such great demand that one of the kings proposed
to maintain his army from the sale of this
product alone. The plant was the familiar bulrush
of the Nile, which grew in forest-like profusion
along the banks of that mighty stream; and from
its strong stems was woven the ark in which the
infant Moses was hidden away âamong the flags
by the riverâs brink,â and so saved from the death
that menaced him under Pharaohâs cruel decree.
The Egyptian papyrus was thus the means of preserving
to the world the life of the greatest law-giver
13

of history. It has been equally instrumental
in perpetuating the code of laws whose principles
still serve as foundation for the jurisprudence of
the leading nations of the earth, nearly four thousand
years after they were first promulgated to his
own people, the wandering tribes in the desert.

â¦
Many uses for papyrus
â¦

The papyrus, a tall, smooth-stemmed reed of
triangular form, grew to a height of ten or fifteen
feet, and terminated in a tufted plume of leaves
and flowers. Like so many plants that grow
beneath the ardent skies of the tropics, it had
numerous uses. It was noted especially for the
soft, cellular substance found in the interior of
its stems, which was a common article of food,
both cooked and in its natural state. It was
employed also for the making of mats, sail-cloth,
cordage, and wearing apparel; while in Abyssinia,
in whose marshes it is still to be found, boats
were fashioned by weaving the stems closely together
and covering them with a sort of resinous
matter. At a very early day, judging from sculptures
of the fourth dynasty, Egypt made a similar
use of the papyrus, employing it in the construction
of light skiffs suited to the navigation of the
pools and shallows of the Nile. It is believed
that Isaiah referred to boats of this sort when he
14

spoke of the âvessels of bulrushes upon the
waters.â But valuable as the papyrus was through
these manifold uses, its enduring fame was due
to an entirely different source. It held closely
wrapped within its green stems the scrolls upon
which, through hundreds of years, the history and
literature of the world were to be written; and that
fact alone was sufficient to engrave its name deeply
on the thoughts and memories of men.

â¦
The preparation of papyrus
â¦

In the manufacture of this Egyptian paper,
papyrus, the outer rind of the stem was first
removed, exposing an interior made up of numerous
successive fiber layers, some twenty in number.
These were separated with a pointed instrument,
or needle, arranged side by side on a hard, smooth
table, crossed at right-angles with another set of
slips placed above, and then dampened. After
pressure had been applied for a number of hours,
the sheets were taken out and rubbed with a piece
of ivory, or with a smooth stone or shell, until the
desired surface was obtained, when the process was
complete, except for drying in the sun. The inner
layers of the plant furnished the best product, the
outer ones being coarse and suitable only for the
making of cordage. Single sheets made in this
way were fastened together, as many as might
15

be required, to form the papyrus rolls, of which
hundreds have been discovered in recent years. It
is said that the Romans, when they undertook the
manufacture of papyrus, made a great improvement
in the sheets by sizing them with flour, to
which a few drops of vinegar were added, and then
beating the surface smooth.

â¦
Early Chinese discoveries
â¦

The Chinese, far
away to the East, also learned some of the secrets
of paper-making. It is believed that in early
times they used silk as their basis, but later on
they made the so-called rice-paper by a method
similar to that employed in the manufacture of
papyrus, deftly cutting a continuous slice from the
pith of the papyrifera.

THE THRASHERâ
Page 57

From the reed, and the process of manufacture
through which it passed, the English language has
gained a number of words. The plant itself, called
papyrus in the Latin tongue, byblos in the Greek,
has given us the two words paper and bible. It
is claimed further that the process of furrowing off
the different layers of the pith gave us, through
the Greek word charasso ÏÎ±ÏÎ±ÏÏÏ, to furrow, and
the Greek and Latin charta, a piece of paper, our
several words chart, card, carte blanche, and, of
course, the âchartaâ of that famous document,
Magna Charta, the great sheet-anchor of English
16

liberties. In the course of manufacture, twenty
sheets of papyrus were glued together into a
scapus by the glutinatorie, the first known bookbinders,
and then into a roll known as a volumer,
from which we get our word volume. The city
of Paris boasts a volumer of this sort, a papyrus
manuscript, well preserved, which is thirty feet in
length.

â¦
Extensive use of papyrus
â¦

The rolls, or papyri, are said to have become
known in Europe through the French expedition
into Egypt in 1798, and specimens were reproduced
in print by one Cadet in 1805. The
making of papyrus is mentioned by Philostratus
as a staple manufacture of Alexandria in
A.Â D.

244, and it continued to be used in Italy until
the twelfth century. The extent to which it was
employed may be judged by the fact that nearly
1,800 rolls were unearthed in the ruins of Herculaneum,
about the year 1753. The durability of
this substance added greatly to its value, and it is
claimed that the ancient papyrus manuscripts that
have been properly preserved are almost as serviceable
to-day as when first made. It is doubtful
whether a similar statement can be made four
thousand or even two thousand years hence in
regard to many of the books printed on nineteenth-century
17

paper. Chicago has the largest collection
of ancient papyri west of the Atlantic, consisting
of three hundred complete pieces and hundreds of
fragments, which were discovered by an Arab
sheik while digging along the banks of the Nile.

â¦
Parchment a substitute for papyrus
â¦

Following the making of papyrus came the
manufacture of parchment, the use of which in
diplomas and certain public documents continues
to the present time. As the story runs,
the invention of the new writing material was due
to the spirit of rivalry between two cities of the
ancient world. Attalus, king of Pergamus, was
anxious to establish in his capital a library that
would excel the splendid collection at Alexandria,
but Egypt, having a monopoly of papyrus, refused
to sell to him. But no monopoly of that
day or this could ever control all the means of
supplying manâs needs. Nature is resourceful,
and man, when driven by necessity, soon learns
that her treasures are practically limitless. When
the supply of one article is for any reason curtailed,
she furnishes something as good or better to take
its place. If all the paper in the world to-day
were owned by a monopoly that refused to sell,
something would speedily be found to take its
place. So the inhabitants of Pergamus, being
18

refused papyrus, set about manufacturing a substitute,
which came to be known among the
Romans as âpergamena,â from which comes our
word parchment.

â¦
Manufacture of parchment
â¦

The skins of sheep and goats were employed
in the making of parchment. These were steeped
in pits impregnated with lime, and afterward
stretched upon frames, where their thickness was
reduced by paring and scraping them with sharp
instruments. To obtain the fine, uniform, velvety
surface characteristic of the best parchment,
it was necessary to sprinkle the skin with chalk, and
rub and polish it with fine pumice-stones, which
not only smoothed and softened the leather, but
also improved its color. When it had been reduced
to about half its original thickness, it was
dried for use. Vellum, which still represents the
acme of luxury in bookbinding, was made in a
similar manner, from the skins of young calves.
As early as 1085
B.Â C.
, the Hebrews wrote on
the skins of animals, and it is believed that the
Medes, at about the same period, used a substance
resembling parchment, and prepared in a
similar manner, the cost of land carriage being too
great to admit of any extensive introduction of
papyrus into western Asia. âFor public documents,
19

the rock, and for private, the pen and the
prepared skin, seem to have been preferred by
them, and in the earlier times, at any rate, they
employed no other materials.â

â¦
The advent of paper
â¦

For many years parchment was used in England
for all deeds of real estate, and so lengthy
were these documents that it was said it took a
flock of sheep to convey an acre of land or make
a marriage settlement. As the age of stone, the
carved obelisk, the clay tablet, and other crude
materials was outgrown, so was that of papyrus
and parchment. With the next step forward
came paper, and the improvements in its
manufacture with regard to quality, variety, and
increase of production, have kept pace with the
varying and growing demands. It is not given us
to know what the future may bring forth, but paper
seems likely to hold sway until the end of time.

20

CHAPTER III

THE ORIGIN AND EARLY HISTORY OF PAPER

â¦
Paper from mulberry bark
â¦

To the Chinese is now generally conceded the
discovery of the art of making paper, of the sort
familiar to us, from fibrous matter reduced to a
pulp. According to the old saying, âTime and
patience will change the mulberry leaf into satin.â
The ingenious, painstaking sons of the Flowery
Kingdom had been demonstrating its truth through
some centuries, when, about 150
A.Â D.
, they discovered
that the mulberry might be put to still
another use. The tree that they chose for their
new manufacture was not identical with the one
upon which they fed their silkworms, and to
which they were indirectly indebted for their softly
shimmering silks, but it belonged to the same
family. From its bark they made, by a process
that must have seemed to them something akin to
magic, a material which, in its developed and improved
form, has been of priceless value to the
world, far exceeding that of the rich and costly
stuffs woven from the cocoons of the silkworm.

â¦
Chinese methods
â¦

Compared with modern methods of paper-making,
21

this primitive process, which is said to be
still in vogue in China, was fairly simple. The
branches of the tree were first boiled in lye to
remove the bark. Then followed maceration in
water for several days, after which the outer part
was scraped off and the inner part boiled in lye,
until it was separated into fibers. These were
washed in a pan or sieve, then worked by hand
into a pulp, which was spread on a table and beaten
fine with a mallet. The pulp was placed in a tub
containing an infusion of rice and a root called

oveni
, and thoroughly stirred to mix the materials.
The sheets were formed by dipping a âmoldâ
made of strips of bulrushes, confined in a frame,
into the vat containing the pulp, which was taken
out in a thin layer, after the method followed in
making paper by hand. After molding, the
sheets were laid one above another, with strips of
reeds placed between, weights were applied, and
the sheets were afterward dried in the sun.

â¦
Natureâs process
â¦

It has been suggested that in regions where the
water-plant called the
conferna
grows, Nature herself
teaches the method of making paper from
vegetable fibers beaten to a pulp. The plant consists
of slender green filaments, similar to what is
called frog-spittle. The fibers are disintegrated
22

by the action of the water, and rise to the surface
as a scum. Driven hither and thither by the
winds, tossed by the waves, and carried on resistlessly
by the currents, this scum is at last beaten
into pulp and matted together by the forces whose
plaything it has been. Bleached by the sun, it is
finally, in some overflow of the water, cast upon
the shore to dry, as veritable sheets of paper. But
if Nature taught the process, man was slow to
discover the teacher, or to learn the lesson.

â¦
Crusaders learn paper-making
â¦

When the Arabs captured the splendid city of
Samarcand from the Chinese, about 704
A.Â D.
,
they gained something more than material booty,
for the art of paper-making flourished there, and
they carried the secret back with them to their
own towns and cities. Western Europe in turn
learned it from the Arabs, through the Crusaders,
who visited Byzantium, Palestine, and Syria. The
followers of the Cross, many of whom were grossly
ignorant and superstitious, went east to christianize,
by conquest, the inhabitants of these ancient
lands, and to wrest from the infidels the tomb of
the Savior, and found to their surprise many arts
and refinements of which they had been ignorant.

â¦
French and Dutch improvements
â¦

It was in 1189
A.Â D.
that the art of making
paper from pulp was introduced into France. At
23

that time the French people were far in advance
of the English in cultivation and in regard to the
refinements of life. They were energetic, and took
great delight in construction, manufacturing, and
building. Profiting by their new knowledge, they
prosecuted this art with such zeal and industry
that they were soon in a position to supply not
only the wants of France, but those of surrounding
countries as well. The people of the Netherlands
were stimulated by the example of France,
and for a long period the French and Dutch were
the best, and indeed almost the only papers produced
in Europe.

THE SORTING AND SHREDDING ROOMâ
Page 57

No reliable record can be established as to the
first paper-making in England. It is stated that
in the personal expense account of Henry VII. of
England, in 1498, there appears the following
entry: âFor a rewarde at the paper mylne, 16s.
8d.â This would indicate that some kind of
paper, which gave the name of âpaper mylneâ to
the establishment where it was handled or manipulated,
existed in England nearly two hundred
years before any patent was issued for its manufacture.
It was almost two centuries later that the
patent referred to farther on in this chapter was
granted, which stated that no such industry had
24

previously existed in the kingdom. In an old
book, Wynken de Wordeâs âDe Proprietatibus
Rerumâ (About the Properties of Things), issued
in 1498, appear these significant lines:

âAnd John Tate, the Younger, joye mote he brok!

âWhiche late hathe in England, doo make this paper Thynne

âThat now in our Englysh, this book is printed Inne.â

â¦
English paper-mills
â¦

This mill is said to have been located at Hartford,
England, and the print of the watermark
used is given in Herbertâs âTypographic Antiquities,â
Vol. I, page 20, as an eight-pointed star surrounded
by a circle. John Tate died in 1498.

â¦
Recognition by royalty
â¦

In the year 1558 appeared âSparks of Friendship,â
a book by Thomas Churchyard, who was
born in 1520 and died in 1604, and who bore the
title of âNestor of the Elizabethan era.â This
book mentions the paper-mill of Spillman. A
poem in a work entitled âProgress of Queen
Elizabeth,â in 1565, has the title, âA Description
and Playne Discourse of Paper and the whole
Benefits that Paper Brings, with Rehearsal and
Setting forth in verse a Paper-myll Built near
Darthforth, by a High Germaine, called Master
Spillman, Jeweler to the Queenâs Majestie.â This
25

is often said to have been the first mill in England,
but if the quotation with regard to John
Tate is intended to imply that the paper was made
by him in England, then certainly there must have
been a paper-mill in operation in that country
nearly a hundred years before, and this, taking
the entry of King Henry VII. as proof of an
English mill, must have been the second, if not
the third, of its kind. It is said that Spielman,
or Spillman, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth as
a fitting honor and reward for the noble work of
having built a paper-mill at Dartford, England, in
1588. A lease recorded in the Land Revenue
Records of England, in 1591, reads, âPenlifton
Co., Cambridge, lease of water, called paper-mills,
late of Bishopric of Ely to John George, dated
14th. July, 34th. Elizabeth,â which would seem
to indicate a third or fourth mill in 1592.

In 1649 watermark of the finest English
paper (whether made in England or not) bore the
royal arms, but later on, in contempt of Charles
I., a fool with cap and bells was substituted for
the kingâs arms.

For some reason, the industry of paper-making
languished in England, and in 1670 the people
of the âright little, tight little islandâ were almost
26

entirely dependent upon France for their supply
of the indispensable fabric, its manufacture, if carried
on at all in their own country, meeting with
but slight success. In the âHistory of Commeret,â
by Anderson, published in 1690, it is
claimed that this was the date of the first manufacture
of paper in England, and that previous to
this time England had bought paper of her
neighbor across the Channel to the amount of
Â£100,000 annually. The war with France occasioned
such high duties on foreign products as to
make the cost of importation too great; but, as
sometimes happens, the temporary deprivation
was in course of time transmuted into a permanent
benefit. The way was opened for the home
manufacturer, and the opportunity was soon improved
by French Protestant refugees, who, fleeing
from persecution in their own land, settled in
England and established paper-mills.

â¦
White writing-paper
â¦

In 1687
appeared a proclamation for the establishment of
a mill for the making of white writing-paper; in
the following year it was stated, in an article in
the âBritish Merchant,â that hardly any but
brown paper was manufactured, while in 1689,
according to report, paper became so scarce and
high that all printing ceased. It is evident that
27

up to the time when the patents of 1675 and
1685 were granted, the industry was in anything
but a prosperous condition, existing only in brief
and isolated attempts at manufacture, and comprehended
merely the crudest products.

â¦
Early English patents
â¦

The first British patent for paper-making was
granted to Charles Hildegard, February, 1665,
for âthe way and art of making blue paper used
by sugar bakers and others.â A decade later, in
January, 1675, was granted the second patent,
already referred to in this chapter, which was for
the making of âwhite paper for the use of writing
and printing, being a new manufacture and never
before practiced in any way in any of our kingdoms
or dominions.â Another decade intervened
between the second and the third patents,
the latter bearing the date of July 4, 1685, and
being âfor the true art and way of making English
paper for writing, printing, and for other uses,
both as good and serviceable in all respects and as
white as any French or Dutch paper.â

A seeming contradiction of the statement of
the second patent is found in Shakespeareâs
Henry VI., where Jack Cade, in 1450, makes the
accusation against Lord Say: âThou hast most
traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in
28

erecting a grammar school, and whereas, before,
our forefathers had no other books but the score
and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be
used; and contrary to the king, his crown and his
dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill.â In the
same act Cade observes, âIs not this a lamentable
thing, that, of the skin of an innocent lamb should
be made parchment; that parchment being scribbled
oâer should undo a man?â thus making it
evident that parchment and not paper was in
general use. Since, however, Shakespeare delineated
Cade as a low, ignorant rebel, we are not
compelled to believe that he was necessarily truthful
or historically correct in all his accusations.
The charges put into his mouth are intended to
exhibit his ignorance, and his prejudice against
all learning or refinement, extending even to
decency of dress and comportment.

â¦
Watermark of Henry VIII.
â¦

There is always some dispute as to exact dates.
It is claimed that about 1540, Henry VIII. of
England used for his private correspondence, a
paper whose watermark represented a hog with a
miter. This was to show his contempt for the
pope at Rome, with whom he had so bitterly
quarreled. It may have been manufactured for
him by special order in Germany or the Netherlands,
29

or it may have been made by foreign settlers
who returned to their own country, so that
the trade was afterward lost for a time in England,
and its manufacture was not known to the
authorities that granted the patents.

â¦
Spanish and Italian makers
â¦

Long before this, paper-making had been introduced
into Spain by the hordes of Saracenic
invaders, who, coming over from Africa on a
plundering expedition, had ended by making conquest
of the whole peninsula. When, however,
the long struggle between Christian and Moor
ended in the downfall of the latter, and his expulsion
from the land that had seemed to him the
paradise of the prophet, the industry declined in
Spain, to be revived at Fabriano, in the province
of Ancona, in Central Italy, which soon rose into
prominence as a paper-making center. Later on,
in 1340, a paper-mill was established in Padua.

â¦
Americaâs first manufacturers
â¦

The beginning of the industry in America was
almost coincident with the granting of patents
for the manufacture of paper in England. A
paper-mill was established by William Rittenhouse,
a native of Holland, at Germantown,
Pennsylvania, in the year 1690, one of the builders
and owners being William Bradford, a Philadelphia
printer, who was afterward the owner of
30

the first printing office in New York City. It
was through him that Benjamin Franklin, in 1723,
received his first introduction to a temporary home,
and employment, in Philadelphia. The paper at
this first American mill was made from linen rags,
and the product was about two hundred and fifty
pounds per day. The mill was on a stream subsequently
called Paper-mill Run, which empties
into the Wissahickon. In 1697, William Bradford,
probably in preparation for his intended
removal to New York City, rented his quarter
interest in this paper-mill near Germantown to
William and Nicholas Rittenhouse, for a term of
ten years, the annual rental being âye full quantity
of seven reams of printing paper, two reams
good writing paper and two reams of blue paper.â
William De Wees, a brother-in-law of Nicholas
Rittenhouse, in 1710 erected another mill in that
part of Germantown called Crefeld, this being
also on the banks of a small stream that emptied
into the Wissahickon.

â¦
Russian mills
â¦

It is stated by several authorities that in the
year 1712 Peter the Great of Russia visited
Dresden, and was so pleased with the process of
paper-making as he witnessed it there that he secured
workmen and sent them to Moscow, where
31

they erected a paper-mill with many valuable
royal grants and privileges. The following year,
1713, saw a revival of the industry in England,
where it had again gone to decay, and where
Thomas Watkin, a stationer of London, brought
it into great repute in a short time.

â¦
Rapid advancement in America
â¦

In 1714 a Mr. Wilcox, who, it is stated, furnished
paper to Benjamin Franklin, erected a
paper-mill in Delaware. The date of the erection
of this mill is given by another authority as
1729, and the place Chester Creek, Delaware
County, Pennsylvania, where paper was still made
by hand as late as 1870. It may possibly have
been a second mill that was built by Thomas
Wilcox at that time, in which case there would
be no conflict of authorities. The manufacture
made rapid strides in this young and growing
country, so that in 1770 there were forty paper-mills
in the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
and Delaware. The advance among the leading
nations of Europe during the same period was
equally rapid. The manufacture was introduced
into Massachusetts in 1717, and into Norwich,
Connecticut, in 1768, but the progress in New
England was not so rapid as in the states where it
had been first established.

32

A bill which came before the New York Legislature
in 1724, but failed of passage, introduced
the policy of protection for infant industries, in
an exceedingly narrow and discriminating sense.
The beneficiary of the bill was William Bradford,
doubtless the same man who owned the quarter
interest in the first Pennsylvania mill, and by its
provisions he and his assigns were to be encouraged
to make paper, while all other persons were
to be prohibited from manufacturing it in the
province during a period of fifteen years.

â¦
Pulp from stone
â¦

Manâs untiring endeavor, his constant effort
through the centuries to find something better
suited to his needs, had in a figurative sense succeeded
in turning stone into paper. It remained
for two apprentices of Rittenhouse, who erected
a third paper-mill in Pennsylvania in 1728, to
advance the claim that this could be done literally,
that stone, the primitive material on which had been
carved the first written characters of the race could
be converted into a paper resembling assesâ skins.
We have no means of knowing what the so-called
stone was, nor what process was followed, but it is
safe to assume that both material and methods
were similar to those employed at the present time
in the manufacture of asbestos papers.

33

â¦
A state grant
â¦

The year 1728, which marked the establishment
of the third mill in Pennsylvania, was a
notable one in the annals of paper-making. It is
stated that in that year William Bradford owned
a mill at Elizabethtown, New Jersey, which is
supposed to have been the first one in the state,
while in the same year the General Court or Legislature
of Massachusetts granted a ten-year patent
to a company for the exclusive right to manufacture
paper. By the terms of this grant the company
was to make at least 115 reams of brown and
60 reams of writing paper in the first fifteen
months, and to increase a certain amount each
year until the annual product of the various qualities
should be not less than 500 reams a year.
The mill established under this patent went into
operation at Milton, one of the small towns near
Boston, in 1730. It was erected by Daniel
Henchman, an enterprising stationer of Boston,
and is supposed to have been discontinued owing
to the impossibility of securing a skilled workman,
though in 1731 Henchman produced before the
General Court samples of paper made at the mill.
In the following year another stationer of Boston,
Richard Fry, who was also bookseller, paper-maker
and rag merchant, returned thanks to the
34

people for gathering rags, of which he had already
received several pounds weight, in response to a
request in a previously published advertisement.

â¦
Crude methods and machines
â¦

During these early days of the industry both
methods and machinery were crude. It was not
until 1750 that wove molds came into use and
did away with the roughness of laid paper. Six
years later engines were introduced to facilitate the
process of reducing the rags to pulp, which had
previously been accomplished by pounding, while
in 1759 cylinders provided with sharp steel blades
were invented in Holland for the same purpose,
and soon came into general use, taking the place
of the heavy stampers, which had required a great
expenditure of power in their operation.

The mill at Milton, Massachusetts, established
in 1730, and discontinued for lack of workman,
was put into operation again by a citizen of Boston.
Finding among the British troops stationed
in the city a soldier who was also a paper-maker,
he obtained for him a furlough of sufficient duration
to enable him to get the mill into running
order once more. The state of Connecticut showed
its appreciation of the important industry by issuing
a special charter to the mill at Norwich, already
mentioned as having been built in 1768, and by
35

the payment of a bounty to the manufacturer,
Christopher Leffingwell.

â¦
Scarcity of rags
â¦

There were constant appeals for rags in this
early stage of the industry. The Boston News
Letter in 1769 published an article stating that
âthe bell cart will go through Boston before the
end of next month to collect rags for the paper-mills
at Milton, when all the people that will
encourage the paper manufactory may dispose of
them,â and followed with an appeal in ârime.â
Apparently the people of New England did not
âencourage the paper manufactoryâ to any great
extent, for at the outbreak of the Revolution there
were only three paper-mills in that section of the
country, and as a consequence, paper became
exceedingly scarce during the war.

Connecticut gave state aid to the mill at Norwich
for two years, but withdrew its special encouragement
in 1770, having paid Leffingwell a
bounty of 2d. per quire on 4,020 quires of writing-paper,
and 1d. a quire on 10,600 quires of
printing-paper.

â¦
Mills in the South
â¦

In the South, the industry was not established
as early as in New England and the Middle
States, and the first mills were encouraged by
loans and rewards. The Maryland convention
36

in 1775 resolved that Â£400 granted and advanced
to James Dorsey for starting a paper-mill,
he to repay the same within two years, without
interest, either in cash or in writing or cartridge
paper. In the same year, South Carolina offered
Â£500 currency to the first one who should erect
and establish a paper-mill in the colony, the
money to be paid upon the production of three
reams of good writing-paper made at the mill.

In the year 1776, a paper-mill at East Hartford,
Connecticut, supplied the press at Hartford,
which issued about 8,000 papers a week, and
manufactured also the writing paper used in the
state, together with much of that used by the
Continental Congress.

â¦
Paper-makers exempt from military service
â¦

With the outbreak of hostilities came a keener
realization of the importance of the paper interest,
and the greatest care was exercised in providing
for all details of the manufacture. In 1776
Massachusetts provided by law for the appointment
of a suitable person in each town to receive
rags for the paper-mills; and the inhabitants were
admonished to be careful to save even the smallest
quantity of rags. In anticipation of the coming
conflict, New York, in the same year, by
special enactment, exempted from military service
37

the master workman and two attendants at each
paper-mill. The Council of Public Safety of
Pennsylvania went a step further. The Continental
Congress having resolved on the retention
of paper-makers, the Council took measures to
prevent them from joining the volunteers who
were about to march to New Jersey.

â¦
A sermon effectively delivered
â¦

These various provisions and enactments furnish
a striking object-lesson as to the value of
paper, even to the public safety. The wisdom of
these precautions soon became evident. Notwithstanding
all the care that had been exercised, the
supply ran low, and after advertising for paper, and
ordering the people to produce all they had, it was
found necessary, just before the battle of Monmouth,
to send files of soldiers to search for the
indispensable article wherever there was a likelihood
of finding it. In the garret of a house in
which Benjamin Franklin had once lived and had
his printing-office were found about twenty-five
hundred copies of a sermon by Rev. Gilbert Tenant,
upon âDefensive War,â which had been
printed by Franklin. These were used for musket
cartridges and âwadding,â and in the battle
that raged about old Tenant church, where fought
representatives from every one of the thirteen
38

colonies, mingling their patriotic blood upon the
historic field, the sermon proved one of the most
effective ever delivered. The Rev. Mr. Tenant,
when he penned his discourse, probably had no
idea that it would ever be delivered in so forceful
a manner, just outside the doors of his church.
The fact that these sermons were stored in the
garret of Benjamin Franklin, printer, and held for
payment, will perhaps call forth a rueful smile
from the modern printer, who has himself had
some experience of similar sort, the final outcome
of which was not so satisfactory as this use of these
old sermons must have proved to the patriot
printer Franklin.

â¦
Great scarcity of paper
â¦

As the war advanced, the scarcity of paper
caused much inconvenience. It was on this account
that the journal of the second session of
the New York Assembly, in 1781, was not
printed. In 1789, so it is stated, the paper-mill
nearest to Albany, New York, was one at Bennington,
in the state of Vermont. The product
was frequently brought from the mill on horseback,
and although it was very coarse and unbleached
compared with the paper of to-day, it
was so valuable that every torn or broken sheet
was repaired with paste. This work was so neatly
39

and deftly done that in old copies of the âRegister,â
preserved in the Albany Institute, the
patching can be seen only by holding the paper
to the light.

â¦
Appeal for rags
â¦

The first mill to be established in the northern
part of New York was erected at Troy in 1793.
About that time, or in 1801, the postmaster of
the city issued a special plea under the heading,
âPlease save your rags,â in which he said: âThe
press contributes more to the diffusion of knowledge
and information than any other medium;
rags are the primary requisite in the manufacture
of paper, and without paper the newspapers of
our country, those cheap, useful, and agreeable
companions of the citizen and the farmer, which
in a political and moral view are of the highest
national importance, must decline.â He then
went on to show how, with sufficient rags, the
paper-mills of the state could meet all demands;
how the patriotic saving of rags had been inculcated
and was practiced in New England, saving
to Connecticut alone $50,000 a year, and how the
thrifty New England housewife had reduced the
methods of saving to a science, or rather to a fine
art, and closed as follows: âThe rich, who regard
the interest of their country, will direct their children
40

or domestics to place a bag or box in some
convenient place as a deposit for rags, that none
may be lost by being swept into the street or fire;
the sales of which saving will reward the attention
of the faithful servant, and encourage the prosperous
enterprise of prudence.â

â¦
The establishment of the Crane mills
â¦

Zenas Crane, of Worcester, Massachusetts,
seeking a favorable site for a paper-mill, visited
Berkshire County in 1799, and finally decided
upon a location on the south branch of the Housatonic,
at Dalton. That small beginning was like
the acorn from which springs the giant oak. It
was the foundation of the great paper interest of
that region, which has made the name of the beautiful
hill county famous, both for the importance
and extent of the manufacture and for the excellence
and fineness of its products.

As we have already seen, the early paper-mills
were greatly hampered by the scarcity of rags,
and matters grew worse instead of better during
the last fifteen years of the century. But the year
1800 brought some relief. Matthew Kooper, of
France, who in the following year succeeded in
making paper from straw and wood, invented a
process by which 700 reams of clean, white paper
were turned out weekly from such old written,
41

printed, and waste paper as had previously been
thrown away. In the face of a rag famine, such a
process was a great boon to the paper manufacturer.

The following appeal, issued by Zenas Crane
and his associates to the people of Worcester in
1801, shows how great was the scarcity of rags at
that time, and helps to complete the history leading
up to the erection of the new mill at Dalton:

The Butler mills of early days
â¦

A few years later, but yet early in the life of
the nineteenth century, Zebediah Butler, Sr., and
his son, Zebediah Butler, Jr., were interested in a
paper-mill at Hubbellâs Falls, Vt., and it was here
that Oliver Morris Butler, elder brother of J.Â W.
Butler, learned his tradeâhere, too, J.Â W. Butler
was born. The paper made was of the kind now
known as Straw Wrapping. Later this mill became
the property of James I. Cutler, and Oliver Morris
Butler went south to Lee, Massachusetts, to perfect
his knowledge of the paper industry, there
having been erected at Lee a large and modern
plant representative of the latest and best ideas
then known to the art of paper-making. In 1840
Oliver Morris Butler returned to Hubbellâs Falls,
and, being unable to collect certain obligations due
him, took paper in part paymentâthis particular
invoice of finished paper he brought west to Chicago.
The venture, while not profitable, is yet
of much interest, as it practically marks the beginning
of the present J.Â W. Butler Paper Company.

â¦
The Butler mills the first in the West
â¦

In 1841 Oliver Morris Butler moved west
into Illinois, locating at St. Charles, a town about
thirty miles from Chicago and situated upon the
Fox River. Here he immediately built a wrapping-paper
mill; later, and upon the opposite
43

bank of the same stream, he erected a print-paper
plant, the first of its kind west of Pittsburg. It is
also recorded in the Atlas Biographical Dictionary
that Simeon and Asa Butler, members of another
branch of the Butler family, made the first letter-paper,
the product of an American mill, that was
used in the Senate of the United States.

â¦
The great Fourdrinier machine
â¦

The desire for improvement in material conditions,
for better implements and better methods,
has marked every stage of manâs advance. The
same spirit that led primitive man to seek a better
and more convenient medium of expression than
the cumbersome bowlder or the carved obelisk,
manifested itself again, centuries later, in the
untiring zeal with which manufacturers sought to
improve a product that may be considered the
final successor of the bowlder and the obelisk.
The beginning of the century saw many improvements
in the methods of paper-making. In 1804
Messrs. Henry and Seely Fourdrinier, enterprising
and public-spirited stationers doing business in
England, brought to a good degree of perfection
the great machine which bears their name, and
which is described at some length in a subsequent
chapter dealing with the methods of modern paper
manufacture. The machine had been invented,
44

though not perfected, a year or two previously, by
a Mr. Roberts in France; in 1805, Mr. Donkin,
the engineer of the Fourdrinier Brothers, who had
built the machine, further improved it by altering
the position of the cylinders so as to dispense with
an upper web. By this change the process was so
simplified that the work of six vats could be done
in twelve hours. These improvements were made
in a paper-mill at Two Waters, England; but the
machine that can now do in a day the work that
formerly required three months was not immediately
introduced into this country.

â¦
Many new mills
â¦

The increase of paper-mills in the United States
had been so rapid that in 1810 the number in the
country was stated to be 185. In 1811, Zenas
Crane, who had built the first mill at Dalton, since
known as the Berkshire Mills, erected a new mill
at the lower falls of the Housatonic. These pioneers
gave a great impetus to the manufacture,
and paper-mills sprang up as if by magic along all
the swift-flowing mountain streams of New England.

A paper-mill, the first built in the British
American provinces, was erected at what is now
Bedford, and in the same year, 1816, a paper
factory was put into operation at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.
45

It was operated by a 16 horse-power
steam-engine, employed forty persons, and with
an annual output valued at only $20,000 required
the consumption of 10,000 bushels of coal and the
use of 120,000 pounds of rags, showing that the
method must have been slow and cumbersome,
and the margin of profit small.

â¦
Duty on books
â¦

It is believed that the Gilpins, who were celebrated
paper-makers on the Brandywine, near
Philadelphia, were the first to introduce paper
machinery from France and England, about the
year 1820, but the experiment proved so expensive
that it met with little encouragement at that time.
Some interesting facts were brought out during
this year by a petition to Congress from the paper-makers
of Pennsylvania and Delaware, who asked
for a duty on paper, claiming that seventy paper-mills,
with ninety vats, employing 950 persons, and
using 2,600 tons of rags, with an annual output
of $500,000 in value, had by foreign competition
been reduced to seventeen vats. The allied trades
of printing and publishing were so closely connected
with paper-making that what affected one
affected all; it was this community of interests
that led representatives of the three industries to
unite, in 1822, in a memorial to Congress, urging
46

that the duty on books should not be reduced,
as the books, entirely of American products and
manufacture, which were issued in the country,
amounted in value to more than $1,000,000 per
annum.

RAGS IN VARIOUS STAGES

â¦
The calender invented
â¦

Notwithstanding foreign competition, possibly
because of that stimulus, improvements were
constantly being made in methods and machinery.
The agitator now used on paper machines, consisting
of a semi-cylindrical cradle vibrating so as
to prevent the fibers from being arranged parallel
one to another, the result of which would be to
make the paper weaker in one direction than in
the other, was patented by Reuben Fairchild of
Trumbull, Connecticut, in 1829. In the following
year Thomas Gilpin of Philadelphia invented
what are called âcalenders,â for giving the polished
surface to paper. These are described later,
in
Chapter V
. True cylinders were first made in
this same year by an inventor in England. The
result was gained by grinding the rollers together
while a stream of water flowed over them, this
operation requiring many weeks. Through these
various inventions and improvements, and through
the introduction of machinery from Europe, by
means of which the coarsest of rags and other
47

materials were cleaned, bleached, and purified,
and increased three hundred per cent in value, a
decided impetus was imparted to the manufacture.

â¦
Improved machinery
â¦

The advance in the industry during the
following years was so marked that in 1842,
according to an estimate made at a meeting of
paper-makers held in New York City in that
year, the paper-mill property of the United States
was valued at $16,000,000, and the annual output
at $15,000,000, while the value of rags imported
from Europe amounted to $468,230, and the raw
stock, rags, and other material collected in the
United States to $6,000,000. With the adoption,
in 1843, of the devices for a rotating strainer, for
draining water from the pulp in the washing or
beating vats, came another advance in the process
of paper-making.

â¦
The first paper-house in Chicago
â¦

In 1844 a jobbing house was opened in Chicago
by Oliver Morris Butler to dispose of the paper
made at his St. Charles Mill. Several years later
J.Â W. Butler, the present head of the J.Â W. Butler
Paper Company, was placed in sole charge of the
Chicago branch. Oliver Morris Butler was also a
part owner and president of the Lockport Paper
Company, of Lockport, Illinois, a successful plant
erected for the manufacture of Straw Board, and
48

he remained active in the trade up to the time
of his death, which occurred in 1888.

â¦
Genealogy of the Butlers as paper-makers
â¦

The store
which he established in 1844 and put under the
management of his younger brother, J.Â W. Butler,
touches closely, through him, his ancestors, and
their earlier years as paper-makers, nearly the
whole of the nineteenth century in the line of the
paper industry in this country. That this direct
branch of the Butler family may have had even
earlier identification with paper-making is not improbable;
the family line is clearly and directly
traceable as continuous residents in America back
to the earlier half of the seventeenth century, only
a few years subsequent to the Pilgrimsâ landing,
but the meager records of our earliest settlers
seldom speak of their vocations, and our first
positive knowledge of the Butler familyâs connection
with the paper industry is early in the nineteenth
century.

CHAPTER IV

EARLY METHODS OF PAPER-MAKING

âAs far as the East is from the West,â so
great is the difference between the methods and
processes of the slow-going Orient and those
that prevail in the Occident.

It is fully a century and a half since Berkeley
gave expression to his faith in the high destiny
of the West:

âWestward the course of empire takes its way;

The four first acts already past,

A fifth shall close the drama with the day;

Timeâs noblest offspring is the last.â

â¦
Progress of the West
â¦

As the years followed each other swiftly in the
past, it became strikingly evident that the world
must look to the Occident for industrial activity
and progress, and for the practical application of
new inventions and discoveries. And yet, through
the inevitable exception that proves the rule, we
occasionally find East and West working along
strikingly similar lines. The making of paper
by hand, as carried on in our own country in
50

early days, and to a limited extent at the present
time, furnishes such an exception. In many
respects, the process is not unlike that followed
by the Chinese in making paper from the bark
of the mulberry-tree, which has already been described
in the preceding chapter. In either case,
whatever the material employed, the first step,
which was of prime importance, was to remove
from the fibers all glutinous, resinous, or other
superfluous matter. The fibers are the slender,
elongated cells, the enduring portion of the plant
that gives to the paper its strength, toughness,
and elasticity.

â¦
Decomposition of rags
â¦

Before the science of chemistry had been called
upon to furnish its potent aid in the process of
paper-making, the rags used were moistened and
piled together in some warm, damp place, often
in a cellar, where they were left to decay for a
periodâtwenty days or more. During this time,
the perishable portion, sometimes spoken of as
vegetable gluten, fermented or decayed to such
an extent that it could be washed from the
fibrine, or long, white elastic filaments. Before
being submitted to the process of decomposition,
the rags were of course dusted, and, as
far as possible, cleansed from all mineral, foreign,
51

or indissoluble substances, after which they were
cut into small pieces. When the fermentation
engendered by heat and moisture had done its
important work, the rags were boiled and washed,
and finally beaten to a smooth pulp by the use
of mallets.

In the early days of paper-making, before the
discovery of the use of chemical agents to remove
the coloring matter, the color of the paper was
determined by that of the rags or other material,
modified somewhat by the boiling and washing.
When it was discovered that certain chemicals
would dissolve or separate the coloring matter
from the tissue, one great factor in the cost of
making white paper was eliminated. Lye, lime,
solutions of chlorine and of chloride of lime were
employed for the purpose.

â¦
Hand-made process
â¦

The fibers having been separated, by this slow
and tedious method, from all foreign matter, they
were placed in a vat, with a proper admixture of
water to form a soft, slightly cohering mass of
âpulp.â The next step in the process was the
forming of the paper sheets. For this purpose
the paper-maker employed a fine wire screen, or
cloth, called the âmold,â which was oblong in
shape, and supported by a light frame underneath.
52

Above this was placed a very shallow
frame known as the âdeckel,â which in size and
shape corresponded exactly with the mold. Dipping
the mold into the mass of pulp, the operator
filled it even with the top of the deckel, the thickness
of the paper being determined by the depth
of the deckel-frame. Then as the water from the
pulp drained through the wire cloth, the operator
moved the mold back and forth, giving a constant,
even, and gentle motion to the mass within.

â¦
The watermark
â¦

The manner in which the wires of the mold
were arranged gave to certain papers their distinguishing
characteristics. In some molds the wire
was woven like cloth, and the product was therefore
known as âwoveâ paper; in others, the
small wires ran only one way, straight and very
close together, and were crossed by stronger wires
an inch or so apart, the paper in this case being
called âlaidâ paper. At some point in the wire
of the mold a small figure was worked out, also
in wire, and as the pulp was shaken it became a
little thinner over the design, leaving the impress
known as the âwatermark.â

When the pulp had been properly drained,
and matted together, the mold was passed on to
another operator, who was known as the âcoucher,â
53

from the fact that his work was the turning of the
moist sheet of pulp upon a sheet of felt stretched
over a board termed a âcouch.â Over this first
layer of pulp was placed another sheet of felt, then
another mold full of the pulp, and so on until
there was obtained a pile, or âpost,â as it was
called, several quires in thickness. The layers
were then subjected to heavy pressure, by which
as much of the water as possible was squeezed
out, when the sheets of felt were removed, and
pressure was applied a second time to the paper
that remained. The sheets of paper on being
taken out were hung over ropes or poles to dry,
in some room or loft.

â¦
Sizing
â¦

At this point in the process the paper would
be open and porous, and would naturally absorb
ink, instead of carrying it in lines or letters upon
its surface. To overcome this defect, the paper
was dipped in a solution made of clippings of
hides, horns, or hoofs, or in the gelatine prepared
from leather and parchment clippings. The process
was, and is still, termed âsizing,â while the
material is known as âsize,â and is used to render
the paper non-absorbent, also to fill up the pores
and give an even surface. After being dipped in
this solution, the sheets were pressed again, and
54

for a second time hung up to dry; if a smoother
surface was desired, it was obtained by passing
the paper between metal rollers.

â¦
Bank of England notes
â¦

Hand-made paper is now made to a limited
extent in America, and to a still greater extent in
England. All Bank of England notes are printed
on hand-made paper, two notes to a sheet, so that
three edges of every note are rough. Working
under the old method, it took three men a day to
mold, press, and hang up to dry, or finish, four
thousand small sheets of paper, while the process
from beginning to end required about three
months.

â¦
From tree to paper in a day
â¦

In these modern days, as will be seen
later, paper can be made in twenty-four hours from
a tree standing in the forest, in the glory of its full
strength and vigor; though in actual practice a
longer time is taken in covering all the different
processes. Truly the times are changed, and
everything is changed with them!

CHAPTER V

MODERN PAPER-MAKING

â¦
The modern mill
â¦

Though the steady march of progress and
invention has given to the modern paper-maker
marvelous machines by which the output is increased
a thousand-fold over that of the old, slow
methods, he still has many of the same difficulties
to overcome that confronted his predecessor.
While the use of wood pulp has greatly changed
the conditions as regards the cheaper grades of this
staple, the ragman is to-day almost as important
to the manufacturer of the higher grades as he was
one hundred years ago, when the saving of rags
was inculcated as a domestic virtue and a patriotic
duty. Methods have changed, but the material
remains the same. In a complete modern mill,
making writing and other high-grade papers, the
process begins with unsightly rags as the material
from which to form the white sheets that are to
receive upon their spotless polished surface the
thoughts of philosophers and statesmen, the tender
messages of affection, the counsels and admonitions
56

of ministers, the decisions of grave and
learned judges, and all the

âWisdom of things, mysterious, divine,â that

âIllustriously doth on paper shine,â

as was duly set forth in rhyme by the âBoston
News Letterâ in 1769. âThe bell cart will go
through Boston about the end of next month,â
it announced, and appealed to the inhabitants of
that modern seat of learning and philosophy to
save their rags for the occasion, and thus encourage
the industry.

â¦
The methods of to-day
â¦

The rags do not come to the mammoth factories
of to-day in âbell carts,â but by the carload,
in huge bales, gathered from all sections of
this great Republic, as well as from lands beyond
the eastern and the western oceans. The square,
compact, steam-compressed bundles are carried
by elevators well up toward the top of the building,
where they await the knife of the âopener.â
When they have been opened, the âfeederâ
throws the contents by armfuls into the âthrasher.â
The novice or layman, ignorant of the state in
which rags come to the mill, will find their condition
a most unpleasant surprise, especially disagreeable
to his olfactory nerves. Yet the
57

unsavory revelation comes with more force a little
farther on, in the âassorting-room.â

â¦
The thrasher
â¦

The
âthrasherâ is a great cylindrical receptacle, revolving
rapidly, which is supplied with long
wooden beaters or arms, passing through a
wooden cylinder, and driven by power.

â¦
The sorting room
â¦

When
the rags have been tossed in, there ensues a great
pounding and thrashing, and the dust is carried
off in suction air-tubes, while the whipped rags
are discharged and carried to the âsortingâ and
âshreddingâ room. Here the rags are assorted
as to size, condition, and the presence of buttons,
hooks and eyes, or other material that must be
removed. Then those that need further attention
are passed on to the âshredders,â these as
well as the âsortersâ being women. The âshreddersâ
stand along a narrow counter; in front of
each one there is fastened a long scythe-blade,
with its back toward the operator and its point
extending upward, the shank being firmly fixed
to the table or operating board. Here buttons,
hard seams, and all similar intruders are disposed
of, and the larger pieces of rags are cut into
numerous small ones on the scythe-blades. The
rags thus prepared are tossed by the women into
receptacles in the tables. The work in this room
58

is the most disagreeable and unwholesome of any
in the entire process of manufacture, and this
despite the fact that these rags, too, have been
thrashed, and freed from an amount of dust and
dirt beyond ordinary belief.

â¦
The higher grades
â¦

While watching the operations carried on
here, it is impossible to repress the wish that rags
might be bought otherwise than by the pound,
for, unfortunately, filth, dust, and dirt weigh,
and to wash rags only reduces the weight.
While this is a true reflection of the condition in
the average mill, it is pleasant to know, however,
there are others of the higher class that are
decided exceptions, as far as dust and dirt are
concerned. Such are the mills making high-grade
ledger and bond papers, as well as the mill
manufacturing the paper that is used for the
printing of our âgreenbacks,â to which further
reference will be made later. In these exceptional
mills everything is neat and perfectly clean,
all the stock used being new and fresh from the
cotton or linen mills, or from factories producing
cloth goods, like shirt and corset factories, and
others of the same sort. The sorting and shredding
room is always large and light, with windows
on all sides, and is well ventilated, offering a
59

decided contrast in many respects to the less
cleanly mills first referred to, where the women
must wear bonnets or hoods for the protection of
the hair. In either case the process is certainly
an improvement over the old plan of leaving the
rags to decay in a cellar to expedite the removal
of the glutinous matter.

â¦
The cutter
â¦

From the âsortingâ and âshreddingâ room
the rags are conveyed to the âcutter,â where
they are cut and chopped by revolving knives,
leaving them in small pieces and much freer from
dust and grit. Various ingenious devices are
employed for removing metal and other hard and
injurious matter, magnetic brushes serving this
purpose in some mills.

â¦
The devil
â¦

When the âcutterâ has
finished its work, the still very dirty rags go for a
further cleansing to the âdevil,â or âwhipper,â
a hollow cone with spikes projecting within,
against which work the spikes of a drum, dashing
the rags about at great speed. Human lives
are often freed of their baser elements and
restored to purity and beauty through the chastening
influences of tribulation or adversity; in
like manner the âwhipperâ carries the rags forward
a step in the process of purification that is
necessary before they can be brought to their
60

highest usefulness. But the cleansing process,
which is only a preparation for what is to follow,
does not end with the âwhipper,â the latter
having served merely to loosen, not to dislodge,
a great deal of dust and dirt.

â¦
The duster
â¦

The final operation
in the preliminary cleaning is performed by
the âdusterâ proper, which is a conical revolving
sieve. As the mass of rags is tossed and
shaken about the loosened dust is carried away
by the suction of the air, which draws the dust
particles into tubes furnished with suction fans.
In most modern mills the rags are carried forward
from the âdusterâ on an endless belt, and a
careful watch is kept upon them as they emerge
to detect the presence of unchopped pieces, buttons,
or other foreign substances. The journey
of the rags over this endless belt or conveyor
terminates in a receiving-room, in the floor of
which there are several openings, and immediately
below these the mouths of the âdigesters,â
which are in a room beneath.

â¦
The digester
â¦

The âdigesters,â
as they are suggestively and appropriately termed,
are huge revolving boilers, usually upright, which
often have as great a diameter as eight feet, with
a height of twenty-two feet, and whose digestive
capacity is upward of five tons of rags each.

61

â¦
Cooking of rags
â¦

The rags that are to be âcookedâ are fed into
the âdigestersâ through the openings in the
floor, and the great movable manhole plates are
then put in place and closed, hermetically sealing
the openings or mouths through which the
boilers have been fed, these having first been
charged with a mixed solution of lime and soda,
and with live hot steam in lieu of gastric juice
as a digesting fluid and force. In some mills
the boilers are placed in a horizontal position,
while in others they are in the form of a large
ball or globe, in either case being operated in the
manner described; those of upright form, however,
are most commonly in use. The rags are
boiled under steam pressure of about forty pounds
to the square inch, and the cooking is continued
from twelve to fourteen hours.

THE MODERN FOURDRINIER MACHINEâ
Page 73

â¦
The washers or Hollanders
â¦

It is here that the process of cleaning begins
in earnest; and as the mass of rags is tumbled
about in its scalding bath of steam-heated lime-water,
or âmilk of lime,â the coloring and glutinous
matters, as well as all other impurities, are
loosened from the fibers, which are in the end so
cleansed and purified as to come forth unstained
and of virgin purity. Having been sufficiently
boiled and digested, the mushy material, still looking
62

dark and forbidding, is emptied onto the floor
below or into receptacles placed directly beneath
the boilers, where the color and dirt are allowed
to drain off. The mass is then conveyed to the
âwashers,â great tub-like receptacles, which are
shown among the
illustrations
, and which are
known as âHollanders,â from the fact that these
rag engines were invented in Holland, about the
year 1750
A.Â D.
They are oval-shaped tubs, about
twenty feet long, nine feet wide, and three feet
high, varying somewhat according to the conditions.
Each tub is divided for two-thirds of its
length by an upright partition, or âmid-feather,â
as it is called, which makes a narrow course
around the vat. On one side of the partition
the tub is raised in a half-circle, close to which
revolves an iron roll about three or four feet in
diameter, and covered with knives; in the bottom
of the tub, and directly under the revolving roll,
is another set of knives called a âbed-plate,â
which is stationary, and against which the roll can
be lowered. But not to anticipate. When the
emptyings from the boiler have been thrown into
the âwasherâ a continuous stream of water is
turned in at one end, the knife-roll having been
adjusted so as to open up the rags as they are set
63

in motion. These then begin a lively chase
around the edge of the vat, through the racecourse
formed by the âmid-feather,â and under
the rag-opening knives, where the water is given
a chance to wash out all impurities; then on up
the incline over the âback fall,â so-called from
the elevation in the tub. A cylinder of wire cloth,
partly immersed in the moving mass, holds
back the now rapidly whitening fibers, while the
dirty water escapes into buckets inside the wire cloth
drum, and is discharged into and through
an escape-spout. The heavy particles of dirt
settle into what is termed a âsand-trapâ at the
bottom of the tub.

â¦
Bleaching material
â¦

As the water clears, the roll is lowered closer
and closer to the bottom of the bed-plate, in
order to open up the fibers more thoroughly for
the free circulation of the water among them.
When the several agencies of the âwasherâ have
accomplished their purpose, and the water runs
clear and unsullied, a bleaching material is put
into the mass, which in the course of from two
to six hours becomes as white as milk. The
dirty offscourings of all ragdom, first seen in the
original bales, and gathered from the four quarters
of the globe, have endured many buffetings,
64

many bruisings and tribulations, and having been
washed come forth pure, sweet, and clean. From
the washers the rags are precipitated through a
trap into drainers, which are chambers made of
stone and brick, with a false bottom, through
which the water is allowed to drain. This rag
pulp, now called half stock, is kept in this receptacle
until the water and liquor are thoroughly
drained off, when it becomes a white and compact
mass of fibers.

â¦
The drainers
â¦

The rags should stand in the drainers for at
least one week, though better results are obtained
if they are left for a period two or three times
as long, as the fibers become more subdued.
The process of paper-making, as it has already
been described, applies more particularly to
papers made from rags. To-day a very large
proportion of the cheaper papers are made from
wood, either entirely or in part, and these wood-made
papers are subjected to a different treatment,
to which further reference will be made in
this chapter.

â¦
The beaters
â¦

From the drainer the mass is carted to the
beating engine, or âbeater,â which is very similar
in construction to the washer just described. The
knives on the roll in the beater are grouped three
65

together instead of two, and are placed nearer
the bottom or bed-plate in order to separate more
thoroughly the fibers. In the beater are performed
many and varying manipulations, designed
not only to secure a more perfect product, but
also to produce different varieties of paper. It is
the theory of the beating process that the fibers
are not cut, but are drawn out to their utmost
extent. In watching the operations of the
âbeater,â one notices on the surface of the slowly
revolving mass of fibers, floating bluing, such as
the thrifty housewife uses to whiten fine fabrics.
This familiar agency of the laundry is introduced
into the solution of fibers with the same end in
view that is sought in the washtubâto give the
clear white color that is so desirable. Many of
the inventions and discoveries by which the world
has profited largely have been due primarily to
some fortunate accident, and according to a pretty
story upon which paper-makers have set the seal
of their belief for more than one hundred and
fifty years, the use of bluing was brought about
in the same way.

â¦
The bluing story
â¦

About the year 1746, so runs
the story, a Mrs. Buttonshaw, the wife of an
English paper-maker, accidentally dropped into a
tub of pulp the bag of bluing, or its contents,
66

which she was about to use in a washing of fine
linen. Frightened at what she had done, and
considering it the part of wisdom to keep silence,
she discreetly held her peace and awaited results.
But when her husband had expressed great wonder
and admiration over the paper made from
that particular pulp, and had sold it in London
at an advance of several shillings over the price
of his other paper, which had not met with any
such accident, she realized that the time for
silence had passed. Her account of the happy
accident led her grateful husband to purchase a
costly scarlet cloak for her on his next visit to
London town. This accident brought about
another result which was to prove of inestimable
value to the future paper-makerâthe use of
bluing in paper when especial whiteness is
desired.

â¦
Engine-sizing
â¦

Important as the bluing or coloring is, however,
it is only one of the numerous operations or
manipulations that take place in the beater. Many
of these, such as engine-sizing and body-coloring,
require skill and constant watchfulness. Here,
too, if anywhere, adulteration takes place. It is
sometimes necessary to secure a fine-appearing
paper at small cost, and it is profitable to add to
67

its weight. In such cases, a process of âloadingâ
takes place here, and clay or cheap, heavy fibers
are added. Clay is of value not only to increase
the weight, but also to render the paper more
opaque, so as to prevent type or illustrations from
showing through, while at the same time it makes
possible a smoother surface by filling the pores
in the paper. But while it adds to the weight,
clay must, of necessity, weaken the paper. In
engine-sizing, which is done in the beater, the
size is thoroughly incorporated with the fibers as
these revolve or flow around the engine. This
sizing renders the paper more nearly impervious
to moisture. The difference between a paper that
is sized, and that has a repellent surface which
prevents the ink from settling into it when it is
written upon, and an ordinary blotting-paper with
its absorbent surface, is due entirely to the fact
that the former is most carefully treated with
sizing, both in the beating engine and in the size
tub or vat referred to later, whereas in the latter
paper it is omitted.

â¦
Body-coloring
â¦

If the paper is to be tinted
or body-colored, colors made from aniline are
generally used. Only in the highest grade of
writing-paper, and in some few papers that demand
colors fast to the light, is any other order of coloring
68

matter employed. As may be easily imagined,
considerable skill is required to secure
exactly the desired tint, and to get the coloring
matter so evenly mixed that each small fiber shall
receive its proper tint, thus insuring that the
paper when finished shall be of uniform color
and not present a mottled appearance.

â¦
Machine for making continuous web
â¦

When the operations of the beating engine
have been completed, a most interesting process
begins, which marks a vast advance over the
earlier method of forming the sheets of paper
with mold and deckel, straining off the water, and
shaking the frame with a quick motion to mat the
fibers together. The patient striving toward
something better, which has marked all the centuries
since man first learned to carve his rude
records, finds its consummation in the process of
making paper in a continuous web. This result is
accomplished by a machine first invented by Louis
Robert, a workman in a mill at Enonnes, France,
who obtained a French patent, with a bounty of
eight thousand francs for its development. This he
later sold to M. Didot, the proprietor of the mill,
and the latter crossed the Channel into England,
where, with the aid of a skilled mechanic, the machine
was in a measure perfected, and then sold
69

to Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier. They, with the
further aid of Bryan Donkin, their employe and
expert engineer, made many additional improvements,
and sunk in the enterprise some sixty
thousand pounds sterling, for which their only
reward was blighted hopes and embittered lives.
In 1847 the London âTimesâ made a fruitless
appeal on behalf of the surviving brother, who
was eighty years of age, and in great poverty. It
is seldom that the world voluntarily makes return
to those who have bestowed upon it great material
or moral benefits, though it is ever ready to expend
its treasure for engines of destruction, and
to magnify and reward those who have been most
successful in destroying human life.

â¦
First machine mill
â¦

The first âmachineâ mill was started at Frogmore,
Hertz, England, in 1803, which was the
year of the great Louisiana Purchase by the
United States, and it is not difficult to say which
event has been productive of the greater and
more beneficial results to this nation. Through
this invention and its improvements the modern
newspaper and magazine, with their tens and
hundreds of thousands of copies daily, have been
made possible, and men of all classes have been
brought in touch with the best thought of the
70

day. Whatever makes for greater intelligence
and enlightenment throughout a nation makes for
the greater stability of the national life, and gives
new emphasis to Bulwerâs words:

âTake away the sword;

States can be saved without itâbring the pen.â

â¦
The power of the pen
â¦

If to-day the power of the pen over the sword is
greater than it has ever been before, its increased
and increasing influence must be credited in large
measure to the inventive genius and the public-spirited
enterprise that has made possible the great
output of our modern paper-mills. So thoroughly
did these forces do their work in the beginning,
that in the century that has elapsed since the
Fourdrinier brothers sacrificed themselves and
their means in the perfecting of their machine,
there have been really no changes in the fundamental
principle. Those that have been made
have been in the nature of further development
and improvement, such as increasing the speed
and widening the web, thereby multiplying the
product many fold.

But to resume the interesting journey of the
rags, which had reached a state of purification and
perfection as pulp, and which we left in the

beaters. In some grades of paper the perfected
and prepared pulp is taken from the beaters and
passed through what is known as a ârefiningâ or
âJordanâ engine; this for the purpose of more
thoroughly separating the fibers and reducing
them to extreme fineness. The refining engines,
are, however, used only in the manufacture of
certain grades of paper.

â¦
The stuff chest
â¦

The pulp is next
taken from the beater or refining engine, as the
case may be, to what is called a âstuff-chest,â
an inclosed vat partly filled with water, in which
a contrivance for shaking and shifting, properly
called an âagitator,â keeps the fibers in suspension.

â¦
The screen
â¦

From the stuff-chest the mixture is pumped
into what is known as the âmixingâ or âregulatingâ
box. Here the stream first passes over
the âsand-tablesâ in a continuous flow. These
are composed of little troughs with cross-pieces,
and are covered at the bottom with long-haired
felt, to catch any sand or dirt that may still adhere
after the numerous operations to which the
pulp has been subjected. The flow is then forced
through the âscreen,â which is a horizontal piece
of metal pierced with slots. For very fine paper,
these slots are so small as to be only one one-hundredth
72

of an inch in width. They are usually
about a quarter of an inch apart. Through these
tiny apertures the fibers must find their way, leaving
behind in their difficult passage all lumps, dirt,
or knotted fibers which would mar the perfection
of the product toward which they are tending.
A vibrating motion is given to the screen as the
flow passes over it, or revolving strainers may be
used.

â¦
The flow onto machine
â¦

When the screen has finished its work, the
water carrying the pulp in solution flows in an
even stream, whose volume varies according to
the width of the web of paper to be produced,
through a discharge-cock onto the Fourdrinier or
cylinder machine, as the case may be, each of
which will be duly described. This stream has a
filmy appearance, and is of diverse color, depending
upon the shade of paper to be produced.
From its consistency, which is about that of milk,
it is difficult to imagine that it floats separate
particles of fiber in such quantities as, when
gathered on the wire cloth and passed to a felt
blanket and then pressed between rollers, to form
in a second of time a broad web of embryo paper
sufficiently strong and firm to take definite form.
Manâs mastery of the process by which this
73

startling and wonderful change is effected has
come as one of the rewards of his long and patient
study.

The Fourdrinier machine, which preserves at
least the name of the enterprising developers of
the invention, takes up the work that was formerly
done by the molder. The wire cloth upon
which the fibers are discharged as described is an
endless belt, the full width of the paper machine.
Upon this the fibers spread out evenly, being
aided by a fan-shaped rubber or oil cloth, which
delivers the smooth stream under a gate regulated
to insure perfect evenness and to fix uniformly the
fibers of the web now commencing its final formation.

â¦
Deckel-straps
â¦

Deckel-straps of india-rubber are fastened
on both sides of the wire screen, and move with
it, thus holding the watery pulp in place. The
deckel-straps are adjustable, and fix or regulate
the width of the paper. These and the gate, or
âslicer,â are attached to what is termed the deckel-frame,
which corresponds to the deckel used by
paper-makers in the days when the manufacture
was carried on by hand.

â¦
Endless wire cloth
â¦

As the stream flows
onto the endless belt of wire cloth, the water
which has borne the fibers filters into the trough
beneath. Being charged with very fine fibers,
74

size, coloring matter, and other similar ingredients,
it is carried back into the pulp-chest, to save these
materials, as well as to contribute again to the
extra supply of water needed.

â¦
The save-all
â¦

For this reason
the trough into which it falls from the revolving
âwireâ is called the âsave-all.â A shaking
motion is imparted to the âwireâ from the frame
upon which rest the rolls that keep it in its never-ending
round. This aids in draining away the
water, and mats or interlaces the fibers together.
At the end of the âsave-all,â where the fibers are
to leave the âwireâ for the next stage of their
journey, suction-boxes are placed, provided with
an air-pump to take up the surplus water that has
not yet found its way through the meshes.

â¦
The dandy roll
â¦

Between
these suction-boxes above the wire is a wire-covered
roll, which impresses the newly formed
sheet; this impression cylinder is called a âdandy
roll,â and it is from this that the web receives the
markings or impressions that characterize different
papers. All watermarks, patterns, and designs
which it is desired to have appear in the paper are
put upon this roll, and here impressed upon the
soft sheet, which is clarified and left transparent
at the points of contact. Thus the impression is
permanently fixed in the fiber, so that it can be
75

seen at any time by holding the sheet to the light.
The power of suggestiveness is a quality which is
highly esteemed wherever it is found, and which
frequently furnishes a standard of judgment.
Judged by such a criterion, the impression cylinder,
or âdandy roll,â has an added value, for in
all probability its operation suggested the idea of
printing from cylinders, as in our present web or
perfecting presses.

â¦
The press-rolls
â¦

The matted pulp, now having sufficient body,
passes on between two rolls covered with felt,
which deliver the web of damp paper upon an
endless belt of moist felt, while the âwireâ
passes under and back to continue a fresh supply.
The paper is as yet too fragile to travel
alone, and the web felt carries it between two
metal rolls called the first press-rolls. These
squeeze out more water, give a greater degree of
compactness to the fibers, smooth the upper surface,
and finally deliver the web of paper to a
second felt apron, which carries it under and to
the back of the second press-rolls. In this way
the under surface comes to the top, and is in its
turn subjected to the smoothing process. A
delicate scraper or blade, the length of the press-rolls,
is so placed on each roll that should the
76

endless web from any cause be broken, the blade
may operate with sufficient force to prevent the
wet paper from clinging to the rolls and winding
about them. From this point the paper travels
alone, having become firm and strong enough to
sustain its own weight; passing above the second
press-rolls, it resumes its onward journey around
the drying cylinders, passing over and under and
over and under.

â¦
The dryers
â¦

The drying cylinders are hollow
and heated by steam, their temperature being regulated
according to requirements. These driers, made
from iron or steel, are usually from three to four
feet in diameter, and vary in length according to
the width of the machine. There are from twelve
to fifty of these cylinders, their number depending
upon the character and weight of the paper to be
produced, very heavy sheets requiring many more
drying cylinders than sheets of lighter weight.

â¦
Tensile strength
â¦

Strange, almost phenomenal, conditions come
about in the transformation from filmy pulp to
finished paper. A sheet which, though formed,
is at the first press-roll too fragile to carry its own
weight, becomes possessed of a final strength and
power that is almost incredible. The myriad of
minute fibers composing the sheet, upon drying
uniformly, possesses great aggregate strength. A
77

sheet of paper yields readily to tearing, but the same
sheet, when a perfectly even tension is applied,
will demonstrate that it is possessed of wonderful
resisting power. In evidence may be cited an instance
that seems almost beyond belief. Through
some curious mishap a web of heavy paper,
in fact, bristol board, which had been thoroughly
formed, was suddenly superheated and then
cooled while still on the driers. This was caused
by a difference in temperature of the driers and
resulted in the sudden contraction of the web of
bristol; the strain on the machine was so great
that not only were the driving-cogs broken on
two of the driers around which the paper was at
the moment passing, but the driers themselves
were actually lifted out of place, showing a resisting
power in the paper of at least several tons.

â¦
The calenders
â¦

The paper now passes to the upright stack of rolls
shown in the
illustrations
, which are known as
âcalenders.â The word is derived from calendra;
a corruption of cylindrus, a roller or cylinder,
they are simply rollers revolving in contact,
and heated from the interior by steam. These
calenders are used for giving to the paper a
smooth and even surface, and are also employed
in the smoothing and finishing of cloth.

â¦
Speed of machines
â¦

The
78

speed with which the paper passes through these
cylinders is remarkable, from one hundred to
five hundred feet running through and over the
machine in a minute; and in some of the most
recent mills the web is as wide as one hundred
and fifty-six inches (thirteen feet); this is very
nearly double the average machine width of a
few years ago, while the speed has increased in
proportionate ratio; only a very few years ago the
maximum speed was from two hundred and fifty
to three hundred feet per minute; at this writing
(1900) there are machines in operation which run
as high as five hundred feet per minute. But
great as has been the increase in the production
of paper, the demand has kept pace steadily.
The wonderful product of the rag-bag holds an
invincible position in the worldâs economy.

THE SIZE-TUBâ
Page 81

â¦
Five miles in a roll
â¦

For machine-finished book and print papers,
as well as for other cheaper grades, the process
ends with the calenders, after which the paper is
slit into required widths by disk-knives, which
are revolving, and so cut continuously. Paper
intended for web newspaper presses is taken off
in continuous rolls of the widths required, varying
from seventeen to seventy-six inches, according
to the size of the paper to be printed. These
79

reels contain from fifteen to twenty-five thousand
lineal feet of paper, or from three to five miles.
The amount of paper used in disseminating the
news of the day is enormous; sometimes one or
two mills are required to manufacture the supply
for a single metropolitan daily, while one New
York newspaper claims to have used four hundred
and fifty tons of paper in one Christmas edition,
which is about four times the amount of its regular
daily consumption.

After having been slit into the proper widths
by the revolving knives, ordinary flat and book
papers are cut into sheets by a straight knife
revolving at proper intervals on a horizontal
drum. The paper, in sheets, is carried by a traveling
apron onto a receiving table at the end of
the machine, where the sheets as they fall are
carefully examined by experts, usually women,
who remove any that may be imperfect.

â¦
The immensity of modern machines
â¦

The entire length of a paper machine, from
the screens to the calenders, is about one hundred
and twenty-five feet, while the height varies, the
average being about ten feet. The machines, while
necessarily of the finest adjustment, are ponderous
and heavy, weighing in some cases as much
as four hundred tons, this being the weight of the
80

machine itself, exclusive of its foundations. The
machine-room is of necessity well lighted and
thoroughly ventilated, and should be kept clean
throughout, as cleanliness is an essential factor in
the making of good paper.

â¦
Deckel edging
â¦

While the same general process applies to all
classes of paper made, the particular character of
any paper that is to be produced determines exactly
the details of the process through which it
shall pass, and regulates the deviations to be made
from the general operations in order to secure
special results. For example, some papers are
wanted with a rough or âantiqueâ finish, as it is
called; in such cases calendering is omitted.
Another special process is that by which the paper
is made with a ragged or âdeckel edgeâ; this
result is obtained in some mills by playing a
stream of water upon the edge of the pulp, crushing
and thinning it, and thus giving it a jagged
appearance. At the present time this âdeckel-edgeâ
paper is being quite extensively used in
high-class bookwork.

In the case of writing-papers, as has already
been stated in the description of the beating
engines, a vegetable sizing made from resinous
matter is introduced into the paper pulp while it
81

is still in solution, and mixes with it thoroughly,
thus filling more or less completely the pores of
the pulp fibers. This is found sufficient for all
ordinary book-papers, for papers that are to be
printed upon in the usual way, and for the cheapest
grades of writing-paper, where the requirements
are not very exacting, and where a curtailment
of expense is necessary. For the higher
grades of writing-paper, however, a distinctly
separate and additional process is required.

â¦
Tub sizing
â¦

These
papers while on the machine in web form are
passed through a vat which is called the size-tub,
and which is filled with a liquid sizing made of
gelatine from clippings of the horns, hides, and
hoofs of cattle, this gelatine or glue being mixed
with dissolved alum and made fluid in the vat.
Papers which are treated in this way are known
as âanimal,â or âtub-sized.â

â¦
Loft drying
â¦

We have duly described machine-dried papers,
but these higher grades of writing-papers are
dried by what is known as loft, or pole-dried
process. Such paper is permitted to dry very
slowly in a loft specially constructed for the purpose,
where it is hung on poles several days,
during which time the loft is kept at a temperature
of about 100Â° Fahrenheit.

82

Another detail of considerable importance is
that of the âfinishâ or surface of the paper.
When paper with a particularly high or glossy
surface is desired it is subjected to a separate
process after leaving the paper machine, known as
supercalendering.

â¦
SuperÂ­calenderÂ­ing
â¦

âSupercalenderingâ is effected by passing the
web through the stack of rolls shown in the
illustration
,
which are similar to the machine calenders
already described. These rolls are composed
of metal cylinders, alternating with rolls made of
solidified paper or cotton, turned exactly true, the
top and bottom rolls being of metal and heavier
than the others; a stack of supercalenders is
necessarily composed of an odd number of rolls,
as seven, nine, or eleven. The paper passes and
repasses through these calenders until the requisite
degree of smoothness and polish has been acquired.

â¦
Electricity in paper
â¦

The friction in this machine produces so much
electricity that ground wires are often used to
carry it off, in order that the paper may not become
so highly charged as to attract dust or cause
the sheets to cling together. When the fine polish
has been imparted, the rolls of paper go to
the cutting machines, which are automatic in
action, cutting regular sheets of the required
83

length as the paper is fed to them in a continuous
web. In the manufacture of some high
grades of paper, such as linens and bonds, where
an especially fine, smooth surface is required, the
sheets after being cut are arranged in piles of
from twelve to fifteen sheets, plates of zinc are
inserted alternately between them, and they are
subjected to powerful hydraulic pressure.

â¦
Plating
â¦

This
process is termed âplating,â and is, of course,
very much more expensive than the process of
supercalendering described above.

â¦
Sorting
â¦

From the cutters, the sheets are carried to the
inspectors, who are seated in a row along an extended
board table, before two divisions with
partitions ten or twelve inches high, affording
spaces for the sheets before and after sorting.
The work of inspection is performed by women,
who detect almost instantly any blemish or imperfection
in the finished product as it passes
through their hands. If the paper is to be ruled
for writing purposes, it is then taken to the
ruling machines, where it is passed under revolving
disks or pens, set at regular intervals.
These convey the ruling ink to the paper as it
passes on through the machine, and thus form
true and continuous lines.

â¦
Ruling and folding
â¦

If the paper is to
84

be folded after ruling, as in the case of fine
note-papers, the sheets pass on from the ruling
machine to the folding machines, which are
entirely automatic in their action. The paper is
stacked at the back of the first folding guide, and
is fed in by the action of small rubber rollers,
which loosen each sheet from the one beneath,
and push it forward until it is caught by the folding
apparatus. Manâs mechanical ingenuity has
given to the machines of his invention something
that seems almost like human intelligence, and in
the case of the folding machine, the action is so
regular and perfect that there seems to be no
need of an attendant, save to furnish a constant
supply of sheets. The folding completed, cutting
machines are again brought into requisition,
to cut and trim the sheets to the size of folded
note or letter paper, which is the final operation
before they are sent out into the world on their
mission of usefulness. The finished paper may
or may not have passed through the ruling and
folding process, but in either case it goes from
the cutters to the wrappers and packers, and then
to the shipping-clerks, all of whom perform the
duties indicated by their names. The wonderful
transformation wrought by the magic wand of
85

science and human invention is complete, and
what came into the factory as great bales of
offensive rags, disgusting to sight and smell, goes
forth as delicate, beautiful, perfected paper, redeemed
from filth, and glorified into a high and
noble use.

â¦
Beauty of perfected paper
â¦

Purity and beauty have come from
what was foul and unwholesome; the highly
useful has been summoned forth from the seemingly
useless; a product that is one of the essential
factors in the worldâs progress, and that
promises to serve an ever-increasing purpose, has
been developed from a material that apparently
held not the slightest promise. Well might the
âBoston News Letterâ of 1769 exclaim in quaint
old rhyme:

âRags are as beauties which concealed lie,

But when in paper, charming to the eye!

Pray save your rags, new beauties to discover,

For of paper truly every oneâs a lover;

By the pen and press such knowledge is displayed

As would not exist if paper was not made.â

And well may man pride himself on this achievement,
this marvelous transformation, which represents
the fruitage of centuries of striving and
endeavor!

BLOWPIPES COOLING CALENDER ROLLS

â¦
Wood pulp
â¦

Up to this point the reference has been almost
86

entirely to paper made from rags, but radical improvements
have been made, caused by the introduction
of wood pulp, and these are of such
importance that the account would not be complete
without some mention of them. These
changes are mainly in the methods of manipulating
the wood to obtain the pulp, for when that is
ready, the process, from and including the âwashersâ
and âbeaters,â is very similar to that already
described. All papers, whether made from rags
or wood, depend upon vegetable fiber for their substance
and fundamental base, and it is found that
the different fibers used in paper-making, when
finally subdued, do not differ, in fact, whether obtained
from rags or from the tree growing in the
forest. In the latter case the raw wood is subjected
to chemical treatment which destroys all resinous
and foreign matters, leaving merely the cellular
tissue, which, it is found, does not differ in substance
from the cell tissue obtained after treating
rags. In either case, this cellular tissue, through
the treatment to which the raw material is subjected,
becomes perfectly plastic or moldable, and while
the paper made from one differs slightly in certain
characteristics from the paper made from the other,
they are nevertheless very similar, and it might be
87

safe to predict that further perfecting of processes
will eventually make them practically alike.

â¦
Mechanical wood
â¦

The woods used for this purpose are principally
poplar and spruce, and there are three
classes of the wood pulp: (1) mechanical wood,
(2) soda process wood, and (3) sulphite wood
pulp. The first method was invented in Germany
in 1844. The logs are hewn in the forest, roughly
barked, and shipped to the factory, where the first
operation is to cut them up by steam saws into
blocks about two feet in length. Any bark that
may still cling to the log is removed by a rapidly
revolving corrugated wheel of steel, while the
larger blocks are split by a steam splitter. The
next stage of their journey takes these blocks to a
great millstone, set perpendicularly instead of
horizontally. Here a very strong and ingenious
machine receives one block at a time, and with an
automatically elastic pressure holds it sidewise
against the millstone, which, like the mills of the
gods, âgrinds exceeding fine,â and with the aid
of constantly flowing water rapidly reduces these
blocks to a pulpy form. This pulp is carried
into tanks, from which it is passed between rollers,
which leave it in thick, damp sheets, which are
folded up evenly for shipment, or for storage for
88

future use. If a paper-mill is operated in connection
with the pulp-mill, the wood pulp is not
necessarily rolled out in sheets, but is pumped
directly from the tanks to the beaters.

In the preparation of pulp by the other processes,
the blocks are first thrown into a chipping
machine with great wheels, whose short, slanting
knives quickly cut the blocks into small chips.

â¦
The soda process
â¦

In the soda process, invented by M. Meliner
in France in 1865, the chips from spruce and
poplar logs are boiled under pressure in a strong
solution of caustic soda.

â¦
The sulphite process
â¦

When sulphite wood pulp is to be prepared,
the chips are conveyed from the chipper into
hoppers in the upper part of the building. Here
they are thrown into great upright iron boilers or
digesters charged with lime-water and fed with the
fumes of sulphur, which is burned for the purpose
in a furnace adjoining the building, and which
thus forms acid sulphide of lime. The sulphite
process was originally invented by a celebrated
Philadelphia chemist, but was perfected in Europe.

The âcooking,â or boiling, to which the wood
is subjected in both the soda and sulphite processes,
effects a complete separation of all resinous
and foreign substances from the fine and true cell
89

tissue, or cellulose, which is left a pure fiber, ready
for use as described. In the case of all fibers,
whether rag or wood, painstaking work counts,
and the excellence of the paper is largely dependent
upon the time and care given to the reduction of
the pulp from the original raw material.

â¦
Components of print-paper
â¦

Chemical wood pulp of the best quality makes
an excellent product, and is largely used for both
print and book paper; it is frequently mixed with
rag pulp, making a paper that can scarcely be
distinguished from that made entirely from fine
rags, though it is not of the proper firmness for
the best flat or writing papers. All ordinary
newspapers, as well as some of the cheaper grades
of book and wrapping paper, are made entirely
from wood, the sulphite or soda process supplying
the fiber and ground wood being used as a
filler. In the average newspaper of to-dayâs issue,
twenty-five per cent of sulphite fiber is sufficient
to carry seventy-five per cent of the ground wood
filler. The value of the idea is an economical
one entirely, as the ground wood employed costs
less than any other of the component parts of a
print-paper sheet.

The cylinder machine, to which reference was
made earlier in the chapter, was patented in 1809
90

by a prominent paper-maker of England, Mr.
John Dickinson. In this machine, a cylinder
covered with wire cloth revolves with its lower
portion dipping into a vat of pulp, while by suction
a partial vacuum is maintained in the cylinder,
causing the pulp to cling to the wire until it
is conveyed to a covered cylinder, which takes it
up and carries it forward in a manner similar to
the system already described. This machine is
employed in making strawboard and other heavy
and cheap grades of paper.

â¦
Esparto
â¦

Generous Mother Nature, who supplies manâs
wants in such bountiful fashion, has furnished on
her plains and in her forests an abundance of
material that may be transformed into this fine
product of human ingenuity. Esparto, a Spanish
grass grown in South Africa, has entered largely
into the making of print-paper in England.
Mixed with rags it makes an excellent product,
but the chemicals required to free it from resin
and gritty silica are expensive, while the cost of
importation has rendered its use in America impractical.
Flax, hemp, manila, jute and straw,
and of course old paper that has been once used,
are extensively employed in this manufacture, the
process beginning with the chemical treatment and
91

boiling that are found necessary in the manipulation
of rags. The successful use of these materials
has met demands that would not otherwise have
been supplied. As a result, the price has been so
cheapened that the demand for paper has greatly
increased, and its use has been extended to many
and various purposes, which are mentioned in the
following chapter, in an enumeration of the various
kinds of paper.

Many additional items of interest might be
described in connection with the methods of
manufacturing paper, but as this work is intended
for the general reader, rather than for the manufacturer,
those wishing further information are
referred to technical works on the subject.

â¦
Government bank-note paper
â¦

The best linen rags are used for the highest
grades of writing and bond papers, while ordinary
note, letter, and flat papers are made from cotton
rags. In some mills, such as the government
mill at Dalton, Massachusetts, where government
paper is made for bank-notes, and in others where
the finest ledger papers are manufactured, none
but new, clean linen rags are used. These come
from the remnants left in the making of linen
goods. In the government mill where is made
the paper for our national currency, or âgreenbacks,â
92

there is a special attachment on the
machine for introducing into the paper the silk
threads that are always to be seen in our paper
money. This attachment is just above the
âwireâ on the machine, and consists of a little
conducting trough, through which flows, from a
receptacle near the machine, a stream of water
holding the silk threads in solution. The trough
extends across the machine, and is provided at
intervals with openings, through which the short
pieces of silk thread are automatically released, and
sprinkled continuously onto the web of pulp as it
passes beneath.

â¦
To prevent counterfeiting
â¦

The paper is thus distinguished,
and infringement and possible counterfeiting are
made extremely difficult by the fact that the
government absolutely forbids the making of
paper by others under a similar process, as well
as the production of any paper containing these
silk threads. The laws of the United States pertaining
to anything that borders on infringement
of our various money issues, both metal and currency,
are most rigid; anything approaching a
similarity of impression is prohibited, and a cut,
stamp, or impression of any character that approaches
in its appearance any money issue of our
government is considered a violation of the law
93

against counterfeiting, and is dealt with severely.
The government takes the same uncompromising
position in regard to the fabrics used in printing
its paper-money issues, and it will be quickly seen
that the silk thread process above described is so
great a variation from anything required in the
mercantile world that it would be difficult to produce
a paper at all similar without an ulterior
purpose being at once apparent. For this reason,
the silk thread interspersion is in reality a very
effective medium in preventing counterfeiting, not
only on account of its peculiar appearance, but
also because of the elaborate methods necessary in
its production.

In those mills making the finest grades of
paper, much of the process of thrashing, beating,
dusting, and cleaning necessary in the ordinary
mill is omitted. The cleanliness and brightness
which are reached only at the âwasherâ and
âbeaterâ engines in the process of manufacturing
the lower grades of paper from cheaper rags, prevail
at every step in these higher grade mills.

â¦
Pure water necessary
â¦

One of the first requisites in making good
paper, especially the better grades, is an abundance
of pure water, and spring-water, where available,
is preferred.

94

The effort has been made in the description
given to cover the process of making paper from
the crudest rags. In enumerating the several
kinds of paper, in another chapter, brief reference
will be made to the varying methods required in
their manufacture. In this chapter, no attempt
has been made to cover more than the principal
divisions or varieties of paperâwriting, print,
and wrapping papers.

â¦
The center of the industry
â¦

The United States, with characteristic enterprise,
leads the world in paper-making, supplying
about one-third of all that is used on the globe.
The city of Holyoke, in Massachusetts, is the
greatest paper center in the world, turning out
each working-day some two hundred tons of
paper, nearly one-half of which is âtub-sized,â
âloft-driedâ writings. The region in the vicinity
of Holyoke is dotted with paper-mills, and within
a few miles of the city is made about one-half of
all the âloft-driedâ writings produced in the
United States. The tiny acorn planted two centuries
ago has waxed with the years, gaining
strength and vigor with the increasing strength of
the nation, till now it has become a giant oak,
whose branches extend to the lands beyond the
seas.

CHAPTER VI

WATER-MARKS AND VARIETIES OF PAPER

â¦
Importance of water-marks
â¦

Though the water-mark in a sheet of paper
may at first thought seem a comparatively unimportant
detail, the story of water-marks and the
part they have played in momentous transactions
would easily furnish material for a volume. Especially
is this true of the early water-marks,
with which there is connected much interesting
history. They have even become important witnesses
in the courts of justice, where their silent
but eloquent testimony has brought confusion to
seemingly clever criminals. The proof of the
time when a water-mark was introduced has been
the means of fixing the crime of forgery, where
the forger, in order to reach the end sought
through the forged document, dated the same
back, and unconsciously used a paper bearing a
water-mark of a later date. As the early water-marks
have suggested the names of many varieties
of paper, the two subjects are fittingly coupled.

It is not known exactly how long a history
the water-mark has; the first evidence of one, in
96

the form of a ramâs horn, is said to have been
found in a book of accounts in 1330. Simple
designs of common objects, such as a pot, urn, or
jug, were popular forms of the water-mark in
early days. Mention has already been made of
Henry VIII. and the curious method he adopted
of showing his contempt for the Pope, by having
his paper marked with a hog wearing a miter.

â¦
Origin of âfoolâs capâ
â¦

Then followed the coat-of-arms of the king,
and when Charles I. was driven from the throne
and beheaded, the âfoolâs capâ and bells was
in derision substituted for the royal arms, followed
later by the figure of Britannia. Changing
water-marks in those days meant stirring
history. âPotâ paper had a tankard for its water-mark,
and the âfoolâs capâ gave its name to a
larger sized paper, which has borne the name to
the present day. âPostâ was the old size made
for letters, and bore a âpost-hornâ as its water-mark,
the name being preserved to-day in the
United States by âfolio-post.â âCrownâ paper,
as its name suggests, bore the water-mark of a
crown.

In recent years, water-marks have been used
as a means of designating the manufacturer,
rather than for the purpose of distinguishing the
97

paper itself. The crane, for instance, appropriately
designates the paper made by the Cranes,
a family whose name has been long and prominently
associated with the industry in this country.

â¦
Paper in the mechanical arts
â¦

The many and divers uses to which the paper
product can be put have opened up a practically
unlimited field to the originality and genius of
the paper manufacturer, who has learned to so
manipulate his raw materials as to permit of the
finished productâs being substituted for iron, lumber,
cloth, etc., and in many cases it better serves
the desired purpose.

As has already been stated, paper, considered
in reference to its general quality and the method
of manufacture, falls into three main divisions,
viz., writing, print, and wrapping papers, but
these divisions give only an inadequate idea of
the many varieties. The most of these are
obtained by the varying manipulations of paper
already complete in one or another of the three
forms. The various kinds of boards furnish an
interesting example of one of the most comprehensive
classes of paper. Bristol board, so named
from the place where it was first manufactured,
cardboard, pressboard, binderâs board, trunk-board,
and the like, all hold very prominent
98

positions in this, one of the most important of
industries. The heavier of these boards are
made by combining as many sheets of paper as
are necessary to give the desired thickness, and
then by using paste or applying hydraulic pressure,
consolidating them. The number of sheets
used is indicated by the word âply,â used as a
suffix, as two-ply, three-ply, four-ply, and so on.

Like other articles of the commercial world,
papers take their names from varying circumstances,
and there is a large class whose designations
have been derived from the materials or
processes employed in their manufacture, as well
as from the purposes for which they are to be
used.

â¦
Coated paper
â¦

Coated paper, or paper having an enameled
surface, is made by applying a mixture of clay
and glue to ordinary paper. When referred to
in connection with coated paper, this ordinary
paper is called raw stock or body paper. It is
manufactured in the regular way, but is made
slack-sized and sent to the coating factory in web
or roll form, and before it has been calendered.
The clay used is pure kaolin or china clay,
formed by the disintegration of feldspathic rock.
The clay is largely found near Cornwall, England,
99

and the pure white variety, principally used, is
known as leemore clay, while the finest is called
blanc fixe. The clay is ground to the fineness
of fine wheat flour and mixed into solution of
about the consistency of milk. Its purpose in
the paper-coating process is to cover the body
paper, giving it an even surface, susceptible of a
high and glossy finish. The glue used is of the
ordinary sort so well known in the regular market.
Its presence renders the clay solution very
adhesive when applied to the body paper.

â¦
Extreme smoothness required
â¦

The cost of illustrations having been greatly
reduced through the perfection of photogravure
or half-tone processes, a large and increasing demand
exists for a paper of extremely smooth,
firm, and sensitive surface, suitable for the reproduction
of the finest half-tone cuts; a paper with
such delicate fineness and susceptibility that the
minute lines of a photogravure cutâso minute
in instances as to be indistinguishable to the
touch of the fingerâwill be perfectly reproduced
when printed upon its enameled surface.

Large factories are devoted entirely to the
coating process. They do not necessarily make
their own body paper, but frequently purchase it
from outside sources. At first, this clay solution
100

was carried to and spread upon the surface of
paper by the use of a fine hair brush. This was
applied to one side or surface of the paper at a
time, the same process being repeated on the
opposite side, if both were to be coated. Since
its earlier introduction, the process of surface-coating
paper has undergone great improvement, and
the method to-day in vogue, while seemingly
complete and exceedingly rapid, is yet readily
understood, and the machinery required is quite
simple. This consists of:

â¦
Parts of coating machine
â¦

FirstâA vat, to hold the enameling solution.

SecondâRollers, to regulate its distribution
upon the web of paper.

ThirdâBrushes, to work out small lumpy
particles and overcome any tendency to unevenness
of coating.

FourthâAn automatic carrier, to convey the
coated web through a drying-room; after which
it is calendered to the surface wanted and cut
into sizes required.

A roll of body paper ready to be enameled is
placed before the vat which contains the coating
solution. The end of the paper-web is started
through the solution by being passed under a
wooden roller hung in the vatâthe purpose of
101

the roller is to insure an even tension and uniform
immersion of the web. After passing under the
roller the paper-web leaves the vat, and is passed
between two rollers that regulate the thickness of
the coating and remove all surplus. From the
rollers the web passes forward through two sets
of brushes, one above and one below, both sets
working back and forth transversely upon the top
and bottom of the coated web.

â¦
Distribution of coating
â¦

Each set of
brushes is comprised, first, of a coarse, then
intermediate, and finally of extremely delicate
brushes, made usually of camelâs hair, which as
they play upon the coated surface work out all
roughness or small lumpy particles, and reduce
the coating to uniform fineness.

â¦
Carrier
â¦

Upon leaving
the brushes, the paper reaches an automatic carrier.
This consists of wooden slats conveyed at
intervals upon two endless chains that pass at
either side of the machine just outside of the
coated web, the chains supporting the slats at
their ends. As the paper reaches the slats it falls
upon one, which by an ingenious device is carried
forward and upward, permitting the coated web
of damp paper to fall in long loops or foldsâsucceeding
slats follow upon the carrier at regular
intervals, and prevent any marring of the damp
102

surface by keeping it from foreign contact. The
slats upon the carrier convey the web in this
festooned form through a drying-room, kept
at a temperature of about 140Â° Fahrenheit,
thus thoroughly drying the coated web. The
paper, dried by its passage through the drying-room,
is rerolled upon reels, and is then finished
by being passed rapidly between alternate steel
and paper rollers, after the ordinary method of
calendering paper.

â¦
The gloss or finish
â¦

The rollers are susceptible to
regulation or adjustment, so that almost any
degree of gloss can be put upon the coated surface;
hence, for the highest finished paper the
rolls are set slightly closer together, giving greater
pressure; and if necessary, the web can be run
through a second or third time. After calendering,
the paper is cut to sizes required, this being
done in the same manner all rolled paper is cut
into sheets, except that if three or four rolls are
run through the cutter at onceâas is frequently
the case to facilitate rapid cuttingâa device is
used that causes the sheets from each roll to fall
in separate piles, so that all of the sheets in each
pile will be from one roll, insuring uniformity.

THE SUPERCALENDERSâ
Page 82

The quality and value of coated paper depend
upon the quality of the body paper, the fineness
103

of the clay and other ingredients used in the
coating, together with the perfection of its manufacture.

â¦
Glazing processes
â¦

Glazed paper is one of the most interesting
and useful forms of coated paper. The glazing
is done by two processes, known as friction and
flint glazing. In either process the method of
coating, up to and including the drying, is practically
the same as that followed in the coating of
other papers, except that wax is mixed with the
coating to act as a lubricator, and to permit of
securing the desired glassy finish.

In friction-glazing, the paper is passed through
a friction calender, which consists of a cotton roll
and a chilled iron roll, the latter revolving at
much greater speed than the former, the friction
generated giving the paper a very high polish.

In the flint process, the paper is fed into a
special burnishing machine, and passes over a
groove in which operates a flint-stone, fitting
closely in the groove and working back and forth
upon and across the sheet. As will readily be
seen, this is a very slow process as well as expensive,
although it produces a finish, higher and
more lasting, than can be secured by the friction
method.

104

Paper made by the two processes can be distinguished
by the lines appearing on the flint-paper
made by the stone in its travels across the
sheet.

Glazed papers are used largely in the manufacture
of boxes and numerous fancy articles.

â¦
Lithographic stock
â¦

Lithographic paper is a product especially prepared
to take impressions from stones in lithographing.
For ordinary use, common book or
print papers are employed, but these are usually
given extra care and attention in the course of
their manufacture; the stock is so manipulated as
to not only secure the desired quality and finish,
but also to counteract the tendency of the paper
to stretch, which if not overcome is apt to destroy
the register and injuriously affect the quality of
the work. The better grades of lithographing-paper
are made by applying a clay coating especially
prepared to bring about the desired results.

Asbestos-paper is made by combining paper
pulp and the mineral amianthus. Its fireproof
and non-conducting qualities make it a staple
commodity for many purposes, such as drop-curtains
for theaters, insulation of electric wires,
packing of steam-pipes, etc.

Tar-paper is a coarse, thick paper soaked with
105

a tar product, and used for covering roofs and
lining walls, to secure warmth and dryness.

Paper coated with the white of eggs is known
as albumen-paper, and is employed as a vehicle
for silver prints in photography.

â¦
Photographic
â¦

Paper which has been so chemically treated
that the color of its surface may be altered by the
action of light is known as sensitized paper.
Under this general designation are included
numerous papers differing from each other in the
details of manufacture, though the name is most
commonly applied to paper that has been floated
in a bath of nitrate of silver, or coated with an
emulsion of silver-nitrate of chloride.

â¦
For blue-prints
â¦

One of the
most common of papers included under the general
term is that known in general trade as blue-process
paper, which is prepared by floating white
paper in a solution of potassium ferrocyanide.
It is used for copying plans and maps, as well as
for printing photographic negatives. After exposure
to the light for the proper length of time,
under the subject to be reproduced, the print is
finished by immersion in several changes of clean
water. Very similar to the blue-process paper is
the blue or ferro-prussiate paper, which is sensitized
or made sensitive by being treated with a
106

solution in water of red prussiate of potash and
peroxide of iron. This may be applied as a
coating to the surface of the paper, or the latter
may be floated upon the solution. When exposed
to light under a drawing, those parts of the
sheet to which the light has access through the
transparent portions of the drawing are more or
less affected, according to the greater or less transparency,
as well as to the length of the exposure.
When this printing has proceeded as far as
desired, the sheet is washed in clear water, and
those parts that have been protected from the
light, become white, while those exposed to the
light and affected by it take on, when dry, a permanent
blue.

â¦
Other sensitized papers
â¦

Another variety of what may properly be
termed sensitized paper is the arrowroot-paper
used in photography for positive prints. It is
plain or non-glossy, and is coated with a weak
solution of arrowroot in water, with sodium,
chloride, and a trace of citric acid. Photographic
paper, as such, includes a great variety of these
sensitized papers, employed in various processes
of the art; albumenized, salted, coated with
emulsion, or otherwise treated. One of these,
known as Pizzighelli paper, a sensitized platinum-paper,
107

gives a neat surface, and soft, clear, gray
tones, which are most artistic and pleasing for
many subjects.

â¦
Carbon or transfer
â¦

Other papers are so treated chemically as to
produce certain effects under the application of
pressure, instead of by the action of light. Such
is the transfer-paper used for transferring a design
mechanically, which is prepared by coating the
sheet with adhesive pigments of lampblack,
vermilion, indigo, or other chemical. The carbon-paper
universally used in typewriting when
more than one copy of a letter or paper is
desired, is paper faced with carbon or lampblack.
Alternate sheets of writing and carbon paper,
placed one above the other, are put into the typewriter,
and the impression of the letter on the
surface of one sheet serves to print three or four
sheets underneath.

â¦
Manifold
â¦

Manifold writing or copying papers are made
from strong unsized papers adapted to receive
writing or printing, and to transfer this readily
under pressure to another sheet which has been
dampened. It is the common rule to-day to
make permanent record of correspondence and
business transactions by the use of this system of
impression-copying. The manifold paper largely
108

used by railroads is very thin, making possible a
large number of copies from a single impression,
thus effecting a great saving of time and labor.

â¦
Stencil
â¦

Stencil-paper is produced by giving to a sheet
of fibrous paper, as fine and thin as gauze, a thick,
even coating of paraffin, and from this the stencil
may be prepared in two different ways. Either it
may be placed in the typewriter, from which the
ink-pad or ribbon has been removed, and the
stencil cut by allowing the type to strike the wax
sheet, or it may be placed upon a flat steel plate,
the surface of which is cut into multitudinous
microscopic steel points, and then written upon
by a stylus, a steel pencil made especially for the
purpose, which cuts the wax without tearing the
gauzy body of the sheet. Copies are produced
in the same manner as with other stencils, viz.,
by placing the blank sheet under the stencil and
then passing an inked roller over the latter.

Luminous paper is prepared by compounding
the pulp with gelatine and phosphorescent powder.

â¦
Transparent paper
â¦

Transparent papers are made by several different
methods. The usual one employed is to apply a
thin coating of a solution of Canada balsam in
turpentine, or a solution of castor or linseed oil
in absolute alcohol, the alcohol in the latter case
109

being permitted to evaporate, thereby rendering
the paper transparent. Such paper is largely used
for tracing purposes, and may be restored to its
original state of opacity, with the tracings left
unchanged, by removing the oil with a fresh bath
of alcohol.

â¦
Safety
â¦

Safety-paper is a paper so treated or coated
with chemicals that any ink-writing upon its
surface cannot be erased, effaced, or removed
without leaving indelible marks on the paper.
As its name implies, it is used for safety in bank-checks
or other commercial paper, to protect
against alteration.

Gunpowder-paper is prepared by spreading
an explosive substance on paper, which is then
dried and rolled up in the form of a cartridge.

â¦
Sand and emery
â¦

Sand and emery papers are produced by coating
a stout paper with glue, and then sprinkling
sand or emery-dust upon the surface. Manâs
skill has devised for this purpose an ingenious
machine. This first coats the paper with glue
from a revolving brush, which plays over the
surface of melted glue in a steam gluing-pot
below. Having accomplished this result, it softens
the glue with a spray of steam, and sifts the
sand upon the surface, all surplus sand dropping
110

into a box below as the sanded or emery-surfaced
paper passes over a roller. Other loose
particles are blown off by a fan, while the remaining
ones are still more firmly fixed by a second
jet of steam.

â¦
Cork
â¦

Cork-paper, an American invention, is made
by coating one side of a thick, soft and flexible
paper with a preparation of glue, gelatine, and
molasses, and covering it with finely ground cork
lightly rolled in. This paper is used for packing
bottles, glassware, etc.

â¦
Slate
â¦

Slate-paper, which takes its name from the
fact that it can be cleansed like a slate, is prepared
from the regular product, of the required
thickness and consistency, by the use of benzine,
followed by a preparation made of lead, zinc
oxide, turpentine, seed-oil, copal, and sandarach.

Soft plate-paper is a thick unsized paper,
especially adapted to receive impressions for fine
engravings printed from steel and other plates.

â¦
Filter
â¦

Filtering-paper, much used by chemists and
druggists, is simply unsized open or porous
paper. With such paper, of course, the process
of manufacture ceases at the first drying or crushing
rollers, all the finishing or hardening operations
being omitted.

CUTTING FROM THE ROLLâ

â¦
Waterproof
â¦

Waterproof papers comprise a large and most
useful class. It is practically only within the
past twenty-five years that a process has been
known and employed for rendering a paper
waterproof by destroying its absorptive properties.
At the present time there are many and
various methods used in waterproofing, such as
soaking the stock in dissolved shellac and borax.
This method is found especially satisfactory in
waterproofing heavy paper and boards. Another
process is by brushing the surface of the paper
with boiled oil, and paper thus prepared was formerly
used largely in lieu of bladders and gut-skins
for wrapping butter, covering fruit-jars, etc.,
but it has been almost entirely superseded by the
introduction of parchment-paper, of which mention
will be made later.

â¦
Paraffin
â¦

Since the invention of the process of clay-coating
paper, it has been found possible to incorporate
in the coating solution certain materials
which render it waterproof. The application of
wax or paraffin to paper to make it waterproof
is a common method; and although this product
is largely used, the process has never reached the
state of development expected. A great amount
of time and money has been spent in the endeavor
112

to perfect the process, and at the same
time cheapen the cost, but so far with only indifferent
success, and the experiment has usually
proved very discouraging and expensive to its
supporters.

In its simplest form, this method consists in
dipping the paper in a bath of melted paraffin,
the paper being at a temperature lower than the
melting-point of the paraffin, and promptly
removing it from the bath, whereby the adhering
paraffin is prevented from entering the paper to
any considerable extent, and forms a thin coating
upon its surface. This paper is odorless, and is
used for wrapping meats, fish, butter, candies, etc.

â¦
Vegetable parchment
â¦

Parchment-paper, which is almost like the real
parchment made from the skins of animals, is
prepared from unsized rag-paper by immersing it
for a few seconds in a solution of two parts of
sulphuric acid, or oil of vitriol, in one part of
water, at a temperature of 60Â° Fahrenheit, then
washing it in cold water and removing any remaining
traces of the acid by dipping it in a
weak solution of ammonia. By this treatment it
is rendered tough, translucent, glossy, and almost
impervious to water. It is known as vegetable
parchment, and is extensively used in wrapping
113

lard, butter, meats, etc., and also to hermetically
seal jars and pots for preserving fruit.

â¦
Grass-bleached
â¦

Silver tissue, or what is known to the trade
as grass-bleached tissue, is extensively used for
wrapping silverware. It is specially treated to
remove all chemicals that would tend to corrode
or tarnish silver. The best qualities of this paper
are made in England.

Metallic paper is paper washed with a solution
of whiting, lime, and zinc. Characters written on
this paper with a pewter pencil are almost indelible.

â¦
Litmus
â¦

Test or litmus papers are used in laboratories
and factories for indicating the presence of acids
or alkalies and various liquids. It is prepared by
treatment with a peculiar coloring matter that
gives its name to the paper. It is of a blue or yellow
tint, according to the chemical employed in
its preparation, and changes color under the influence
of different chemical agents. The blue
litmus paper, for instance, when thrust into an
acid solution becomes red, but may be restored
to its normal color by being subjected to the
action of an alkali.

The enumeration already given by no means
exhausts the uses of the wonderful product evolved
114

and perfected by centuries of study and toil.
Widespread as is its use in the various departments
of chemistry, and in all the graphic arts, it
fills an equally wide field of usefulness in the
mechanic arts, where it has become a staple.

â¦
Paper car-wheels
â¦

One of its most curious uses in this field is in
the manufacture of car-wheels. The material is
calendered rye-straw board, or thick paper, and
the credit of the invention belongs to Richard N.
Allen, a locomotive engineer. The paper is sent
to the car-wheel shops in circular sheets measuring
from twenty-two to forty inches in diameter,
and over each of these is spread an even coating
of flour paste. The sheets are then placed one
above the other until a dozen are pasted together,
when all are subjected to a hydraulic pressure of
five hundred tons or more. After two hoursâ pressure,
these twelve-sheet blocks of paper are kept
for a whole week in a drying-room heated to a
temperature of 120Â° Fahrenheit, after which a
number are pasted together, pressed, and dried for
a second week; a third combining of layers is then
made, followed by a monthâs drying, until there
is obtained a solid block, containing from one
hundred and twenty to one hundred and sixty
thicknesses or sheets of the original paper. The
115

thickness is only from four and one-half to five
and one-half inches, and in weight, density, and
solidity the block resembles more the finest
grained, heaviest metal than it does the original
paper product. It may be called car-wheel paper.
To complete the wheel, there are required a steel
tire, a cast-iron hub, wrought-iron plates to protect
the paper on either side, and two circles of
bolts, one set passing through the flange of the
tire, the other through the flange of the hub, and
both sets through the paper. The paper blocks
are turned on a lathe, which also reams out the
center-hole for the hub; two coats of paint are
applied to keep out moisture; the cast-iron hub
is pressed through by hydraulic pressure; the
other parts are forced into place, and the paper
center is forced into the steel tire by like hydraulic
power; and there, a product of human ingenuity,
is a paper car-wheel, which never is injured by
vibrations, and is safer and longer-lived, though
costing more, than any other car-wheel made.

â¦
Paper lumber
â¦

Paper lumber is another curious form of the
staple. It is produced by making the ordinary
strawboard on a cylinder machine, running it
through a vat of resin and other waterproofing
heated to a temperature of 350Â° Fahrenheit, then
116

placing together the sheets so resined and subjecting
them to hydraulic pressure. The result is a
paper board three-sixteenths of an inch thick, and
of a dark or blackish color. It can be cut with a
saw or chisel, is very hard and solid, and has been
marketed in slabs thirty-two inches in width by
twelve feet in length at forty dollars a thousand.
It is used for the interiors of railway-cars and for
perforated chairs.

â¦
Chamois fiber
â¦

A product of the paper-mill has been used
quite extensively the last few years for clothing.
It is called chamois fiber or mangled fiber. It is
made from a long-fibered, strong sulphite stock,
and is passed through a specially constructed
machine which mangles or crushes the fiber, giving
it a soft and flexible character, like chamois.
It has been used in dress-skirts and for under-vests,
and has an added advantage over cloth in
being practically impervious to air.

Paper boats are made of especially prepared
paper pulp, molded and pressed into shape.

Paper flour-barrels, water-pails, and other like
articles are made by stamping out their form from
paper pulp or heavy cylinder-made paper possessing
folding properties.

â¦
Papier-machÃ©
â¦

Papier-machÃ© is another product of paper
117

almost unlimited in its uses. The materials of
which it is made, for the commoner classes of
work, are old waste and scrap paper, repulped
and mixed with a strong size of glue and paste.
To this are often added quantities of ground
chalk, clay, and lime. For the finest class of
work, a method invented in 1772 by Henry Clay,
of Birmingham, England, is followed. Sheets of
specially made paper are soaked together in a
strong size of paste and glue, molded into the
desired shape and dried in an oven, other layers
being added, if necessary, to secure the required
size and shape. The dried object is hardened by
being dipped in oil, and is then trimmed and
prepared for japanning and ornamentation. In
delicate relief-work, a pulp is prepared of scrap
paper, which is dried, then ground to powder and
mixed with paste and a proportion of potash until
a very fine, thin paste is formed. Papier-machÃ©
is an exceedingly strong, tough, durable substance,
slightly elastic, and not liable to warp or
fracture. The articles for which it is used make
a long list, including ornamental boxes, trays,
match-safes, dollsâ heads, toys, anatomical and botanical
models, artistsâ lay-figures, picture-frames,
panels, and other mural ornaments. It has also
118

been employed in the construction of coaches and
for door-panels, while under the name of carton
pierre, which is practically the same substance, are
molded ornaments for walls and ceilings. Ordinary
roofing and carpet felts are similar in manufacture.
The use of moistened papier-machÃ© in
electrotyping, and the method followed, is too
well known to need description.

â¦
Wall-paper
â¦

In the use of paper for wall-hangings, the
artistic and practical come together. From the
earliest days when men made for themselves permanent
abodes, mural decoration of one form or
another has been known, and every branch of
painting, sculpture, and decorative art has been
called into service. It is not strange that paper,
with its many adaptations and wonderful possibilities,
should, when it reached the proper stage
of development, find one of its principal uses in
making beautiful the walls of our homes. The
eighteenth century was well advanced when wall-papers
came into use in Europe, but it is claimed
that they were used much earlier by the Chinese,
who, with characteristic ingenuity, have made
clothing, handkerchiefs, napkins, and a great
variety of other useful articles out of paper. The
first patterns were very crude, but through the
119

slow processes of development and improvement
a wonderful degree of perfection has been attained.
Beauty and taste in the decorative art find their
highest exponent in the ârepped moroccoâ and
fine colored papers. Repped or corded papers
are those having raised designs, which are produced
by passing the web between rollers on
which the ribs or other devices have been cut or
engraved. The embossing of morocco and other
paper of raised design is done in the same way.
The morocco and leather papers are imitations
of the old stamped leather hangings of earlier
days, which were usually made of the skins of
goats and calves, cut into rectangular shape.

â¦
Embossed effects
â¦

These skins were stamped and embossed, having
been first covered with silver-leaf and varnished
with a transparent yellow lacquer that gave to the
silver the appearance of gold. The reliefs were
painted by hand in many bright colors. Leather
wall-papers are treated in a similar manner, and
are capable of being brought to any desired degree
of richness. The richer grades of flat-surfaced
figured wall-papers are printed with wooden
blocks, upon which the designs are cut in relief,
there being a block for each color. These blocks
are applied by hand, after having been dipped in
120

an elastic cloth sieve charged with tempera pigments.
Care is used to place each block on
exactly the right place, thus securing perfect
register. In many cases the figures on the block
are inlaid with copper, especially in the thin outlines.

â¦
Block printing
â¦

In âblockâ and gold and silver printing
the design is first printed in a strong size; the
finely cut wool of the required color, called
âflock,â or the metallic powder imitating gold or
silver, is then sprinkled on by hand all over the
paper, and adheres closely to the size. Where
the pattern is to stand out in relief, the process is
repeated until the desired results are obtained.
The cheaper sorts of wall-papers, as well as some
that are very rich, are printed by machinery from
the web, on rollers or cylinders carrying the
designs, under which the paper passes.

â¦
Surface tinting
â¦

Reference has been made to the process of
coloring paper by mixing the colors in the engine,
but wall-papers and many others are surface-tinted
by being run through a color-vat. An
iridescent or ârainbowâ surface is given by treating
the paper with a wash containing sulphates of
iron and of indigo, and then exposing quickly to
ammoniacal vapors.

SORTING OF FINISHED SHEETSâ
Page 83

Mother-of-pearl paper is produced by a somewhat
121

similar process. Glazed paper is first floated
on a solution of silver, lead, or other metal, then,
when dry, exposed to the vapors of sulphide of
hydrogen, after which collodion is poured over
the surface, producing rich and fascinating color
effects.

â¦
Marbled paper
â¦

Marbled paper, used largely in binding, is
prepared from a shallow bath of gum tragacanth,
or goatâs-horn, upon which the workmen sprinkle
from a flat brush the films of colors needed for
the desired pattern. When the whole surface is
covered with bands and splashes of color, the
workman takes a huge comb, which he draws with
a wavy motion the length of the tub. The
practiced marbler will so lay the colors and
manipulate the comb as to copy any desired pattern.
The marbling is done by deftly laying the
smooth white paper on the bath for a moment,
and then removing it, when the entire film of
color comes with the sheet, so that a resprinkling
of the bath is necessary. In marbling the edges
of the leaves of a book, the body of the book,
without the covers, is so held that the edges may
be quickly dipped into the bath. In this case, of
course, one covering of coloring matter will marble
a number of volumes. Paper is also colored,
122

as has been noted, by passing the web through a
coloring-bath.

The papers briefly described in this chapter
have been classified largely according to the
methods of manufacture or chemical treatment,
or to the purposes for which they were to be
used. Another basis for classification is found in
the size. In the United States, the usual writing
papers of commerce are divided, according to
sizes, as follows:

CHAPTER VII

THE EXTENT OF THE BUSINESS IN THE
UNITED STATES

The century just past has witnessed a marvelous
growth in the paper industry. As a seedling
oak, first struggling for root-hold and then pushing
its way steadily upward through difficulties
and obstructions, it has assumed giant proportions,
being now firmly established beyond any possibility
of disturbance, and sending its branches in
every direction. Many causes have contributed
to this wonderful development.

â¦
Publications of 1776 compared with 1900
â¦

In no country of the world are books and
newspapers read so extensively as in the United
States, whose people must be thoroughly cosmopolitan
if, as has been said, âevery man who reads
the newspaper is a citizen of the world.â In
1776, the natal year of our independence, there
were in all the colonies thirty-seven publications,
whose total yearly output did not exceed as many
thousands; in 1900, according to tabulated statistics,
the thirty-seven had increased to twenty
thousand eight hundred and six regular daily,
124

weekly, and monthly publications, and their aggregate
output is counted not by thousands, nor even
millions, but by billions. This too has no reference
whatever to the myriad of publications which,
while appearing intermittently, are not issued at
stated periods; it refers only to regular periodicals,
including our daily papers.

â¦
Illinoisâ rank in number of publications
â¦

In an analysis of
these interesting statistics we of Illinois find occasion
for great gratification, as it develops that in
the number of her publications Illinois outstrips
all of her sister states except New York, ranking
a close second in the grand total, and even taking
first place in the number of her weekly issues.
The following table shows the exact figures and
their divisions of the four leading states:

Â
Daily.
Weekly.
Monthly.
Quarterly.
Total.

An increase of such phenomenal proportions as
indicated by these figures makes tremendous demands
upon allied and tributary industries, but
the increase in the production of paper of the
variety required has been sufficient to meet these
demands. These conditions, however, affect only
125

one branch of the industry. The increase in the
publication of books, together with the multiplicity
of commercial and industrial uses to which
paper may be put, as briefly outlined in the preceding
chapter, explain an expansion that would
otherwise be inexplicable. Another cause to be
taken into account, a third factor in the wonderful
growth of the century, is the export trade. President
Hugh J. Chisholm, in his annual report to
the American Paper and Pulp Association in New
York City, February 15, 1899, made the following
statement:

â¦
Export statistics
â¦

âThe past year has been one of marvelous expansion
in the export trade of this country. Our industry has
shared in this increase of foreign trade, but not to the
extent that it ought. Our own markets being the best
in the world, manufacturers in past years have naturally
confined their efforts practically to them, but we have
reached such proportions in our ability to manufacture
all kinds of paper that it seems as though there was
never a more opportune time to explore and make conquest
of the foreign paper market. The amount of
paper exported during the eleven months ending with
November, 1897, was $4,014,842, and for the eleven
months ending November, 1898, $5,143,055, showing
an increase of $1,128,213.â

During the past two years there has been even
a greater proportionate increase. Considering the
126

fact that ten years ago the exportation of paper
was practically unknown, it will be quickly seen
that we are fast forging to the front and taking
the position in foreign fields which, as the leading
paper manufacturing country of the world, we
now fully merit. Our products are generally at a
premium in foreign markets, and American genius,
enterprise, and versatility are everywhere recognized.
This export trade also acts as a safety-valve
against overproduction, and by thus preserving
equality between supply and demand
lends stability and confidence to the industry.

â¦
Number of mills in operation in United States
â¦

There are to-day in the United States 762
different concerns owning and now operating one
thousand and seventy paper and pulp mills; these
are distributed through thirty-five different states.
Of these, New York shows the greatest output,
the capacity of her mills being 7,854,000 pounds
daily, or nearly one-quarter the total daily output
of the United States. Next to the Empire
State comes Maine, with a daily capacity of
3,723,000 pounds, while Wisconsin and Massachusetts
take third and fourth rank, their mills
producing, respectively, 2,674,000 and 2,195,000
pounds daily. Massachusetts upholds her literary
reputation by ranking first in the production of
127

both writing and book papers. In the production
of wood-pulp paper New York easily outstrips all
competitors, her output being nearly double that
of any other state, while Maine stands second and
Wisconsin third. The total daily capacity (not
production) of the paper and pulp mills of the
United States is estimated at 28,100,000 pounds,
divided according to varieties as follows:

â¦
Division of product
â¦

Writing

1,074,000

Book

2,650,000

News

4,856,000

Wrapping

3,617,000

Boards

3,230,000

Miscellaneous, including varieties
too numerous to mention

1,707,000

Ground wood and chemical wood pulp

10,966,000

The process of paper-making is continuous,
owing to the great expense involved in wiping or
cleaning the machinery, an operation necessary to
prevent the pulp from drying to or rusting the
many parts through which it passes from the time
of its entrance into the washer and beater until it
comes forth as a finished and perfect product.
Allowing three hundred working-days a year to
each mill, the total annual output possible would
be 4,215,000 tons, which, allowing thirty thousand
pounds to a car, would make 281,000 carloads.
128

According to statistics gathered by the United
States Commissioner of Labor for the first six
months of 1898, the seven hundred and twenty-three
plants, many of them having two or three
separate mills, actually produced 1,733,019 tons
of paper and pulp. This would make 3,466,038
tons for the entire year, although the mills were
not run to their full capacity, by any means. The
six months from October 1, 1899, to March 31,
1900, mark probably the greatest activity the
paper trade ever experienced. The mills were
taxed to their utmost to supply demands which
were fierce and exacting. The difference between
the actual production as estimated for the year
1898 and the present estimated capacity of the
mills is 750,000 tons; and as the increased demand
has taken up a large proportion of this, it is safe
to assume that not for many years have the mills
run so nearly to their full capacity as during the
two just past.

â¦
Estimated value of total output for 1900
â¦

Estimating an average price on all
the different classes of paper, not including pulp,
the total value of the output for 1900 would
amount to about $150,000,000.

THE HYDRAULIC PRESS

â¦
Paper ranks third among staple commodities
â¦

Statistics bring out the interesting fact that
over one-quarter of the paper output is roll and
sheet news paper. If an average value of 2Â¼
129

cents per pound at the mills be allowed for this,
it is evident that the users of news paper pay out
some thirty-two million dollars every year for this
important product. Notwithstanding the fact
that this paper is sold for one-sixth of the current
price of twenty-five years ago, it is yet greatly
improved in quality. As a staple in this country,
paper has come to rank third in importance
in the list of manâs wants. The products of
mother earth hold first place, including foodstuffs,
raiment, etc.; and the second place must be
given to iron and steel, the bulwark of our commercial
life. Paper follows next, as the keystone
of our intellectual life, and promises in the years to
come to play even a more important part in the
upbuilding of our modern advancement and business.
The conditions of civilization are such that
intelligent reading is one of the essentials in individual
progress. Affording as it does food for the
mind, and opening up the way to profitable employment
through which the bodily wants are
supplied, reading might almost be classed as next
in importance to the food that nourishes and gives
strength to the body.
On account of its large production of the
higher grades of writing, book, and ledger papers,
130

Massachusetts leads in the value of the output;
if our estimates are correct, the value of the paper
of all varieties manufactured in the state was about
$25,000,000 for the year 1900, or one-sixth of the
entire estimated product. New York follows with
an almost equal amount in the value of the product,
while Maine, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania
will show about $10,000,000 each, the five states
thus making, in value, over one-half of the paper
manufactured in the country. In considering
these figures it must be taken into account that by
increasing the width of the webs and the rate of
speed at which the paper passes over the machine,
the possible output has in many plants been more
than quadrupled during the past ten years, which
in part explains the doubling of the value of the
output since 1890, during which year, according
to the government census, the output amounted
in value to $74,308,388.

â¦
Number of mills and their value
â¦

The number of paper-making establishments
is placed at 762, operating 1,070 mills, and the
value of the plants is $107,759,974; 52,391 persons
find employment in the industry, and are
paid wages aggregating $23,575,950, while the
value of the material used reaches $78,067,882.

â¦
Average output per plant
â¦

During the decade between 1880 and 1890 the
131

number of paper plants proper had decreased from
692 to 567, 125 in all, or eighteen per cent. In 1880
the average number of employes to each factory
was thirty-five, with an average yearly output from
each plant of $79,639. During the ten years that
followed, the average number of employes in a
factory rose to 53, and the average yearly output
from each plant to $131,056. With a decrease
of 125 mills during that period, there must have
been an increase of 5,831 employes and of $19,198,564
in the value of the output.

While the stately array of figures already marshaled
is an impressive reminder of the wonderful
development of the paper industry, which we
accept unthinkingly as one of the benefits of a
marvelous century, mere numerals can never tell
the whole story. They must be forever silent as
to the aims and purposes, the patient efforts, the
determination and perseverance, the alternation of
defeat and triumph which are embodied in the
perfected product of to-day. It is not for them
to chronicle the crude beginnings of the industry
in the days of the dim and far-away past, nor to
trace the slow steps by which it has advanced to
its present commanding position. As our earlier
chapters recount, its most marvelous strides forward
132

have occurred during the hundred years just
past.

â¦
Paper aids other industries
â¦

The century that has marked such material
progress in the production of paper has been pre-eminently
one of vast intellectual and industrial
activity and advancement, and it is a fair statement
that paper has not only contributed largely to the
general progression that has taken place, but
through it as a medium standards have been
reached that must have remained unknown were
it not for its efficient service. Through manâs
inventive genius the utility of this valuable product
has been increased a hundred-fold, and its
wider use has been the means of broadening and
extending other manufactories. It has aided invention,
and is the medium through which new
discoveries, theories, and conclusions have been
proclaimed. It is the handmaid of literature and
music, and through its fostering agency the highest
culture is to-day placed within the possible
reach of the masses. Formerly, any considerable
degree of learning was confined to the favored
fewâthey were the âwise menâ and the âmagiâ;
those who could read even the simplest forms
of language were the decided exception, and
works to be read were rare, and confined to the
133

libraries of the great cities. To-day, through the
abundance and cheapness of publications, all men
may hold close communion with the minds of
leading thinkers past and present, and the melodies
of the great masters are brought within the
hearing of all.

â¦
Paperâs service to the fine arts
â¦

In art it has served as noble a
purpose as in literature and music. The fineness
and delicacy of surface, attained through modern
processes, make possible the half-tone and other
fac-simile reproductions, which cultivate an appreciation
of the beautiful and carry into even the
humblest of homes the refining influences of great
works of art; reproductions used in illustration
also elucidate and render great assistance to the
correct interpretation of scientific and other publications.

But do these material attainments mark, in
themselves, manâs greatest achievements? Vast
and complete as they are, our answer must be no.
Each, within itself a type of highest thought, becomes
an integral factor in the progression of the
race, the perfectability of man, his nature and
condition.

â¦
Paper aids great reforms
â¦

The advanced thinkers of to-day agree that
the hundred years just ended have been especially
remarkable from a humanitarian standpoint. They
134

have been made notable by movements tending
toward manâs elevation, toward the righting of
his wrongs, and the alleviation of his sufferings.
Victor Hugo declares: âThis century is the
grandest of centuries ... because it is the sweetest.
This century ... freed the slave in America,
elevated the pariahs in Asia, extinguished the
funeral pile in India, and crushed the last fire-brands
at the martyrâs stake in Europe.â If we
ask how these great reforms were wrought, the
answer must be, in part at least, that their accomplishment
was the result of public sentiment
properly educated and directed. This were surely
impossible without paper. By dint of the universality
of its service to mankind the ruling minds
of all thinking nations are frequently placed upon
a common plane, becoming possessed of common
convictions, and upon the sudden presentation of
important international problems, often act with
a degree of unison that strikingly illustrates how
much of one mind we are, how nearly upon one
plane the thoughts of men are moving. As a
force both in shaping and giving expression to
public opinion, the press wields a power that is at
once unquestioned and invincible. As Chapin
says, the productions of the press âgo abroad
135

through the land, silent as snowflakes, but potent
as thunder.â Power without an agency of expression
is helpless, and the paper sheet is the
medium that makes possible the potency of the
press. On its white wings it bears abroad the inspired
words that stir menâs hearts and prove the
heralds of âliberty, equality, and fraternity.â

â¦
The power of education
â¦

When man has been set free from his fetters,
whether they be the physical ones of iron or the
no less binding chains of caste and custom, he is
helpless until education and enlightenment restore
to him the manhood, independence, and self-reliance
which he has been denied. It is the chief
glory of this century that mankind has been helped
to a higher intellectual plane and the blessings of
truth and knowledge have been more widely disseminated
than ever before. âThe statesman
is no longer clad in the steel of special education,
but every reading man is his judge.â Higher
education has brought to man a quickened sense
of the inherent nobility of his nature, and has
changed his conceptions of the relations that exist
between his own life and that which pulsates about
him. To quote again from the great French
writer: âThis century proclaims the sovereignty
of the citizen and the inviolability of life; it crowns
136

the people and consecrates man.â And this
broadened enlightenment, this deepened sense of
manâs dignity and nobility, have in their turn contributed
to the humanitarian side of life, making
it easier to redress wrong and establish justice.

In all these great movements of the century,
paper has been the means of transmitting intellectual
force; it has been the messenger and herald
of better things than the world had known. Its
history has always been closely linked with that
of man; it has been the pace-maker of his progress,
in the realm of mechanics and of economics
as well as in music, literature, and art. They
have come up together out of the past; they are
associated in noble and uplifting work in the
present; together they go forward to such broader
fields of usefulness as the future may disclose.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

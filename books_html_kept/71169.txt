MANCHESTER STRIKE.

Chapter I.
THE WEEKâS END.

One fine Saturday evening in May, 18â, several
hundred work-people, men, girls, and boys,
poured out from the gates of a factory which
stood on the banks of the Medlock, near Manchester.
The children dispersed in troops, some
to play, but the greater number to reach home
with all speed, as if they were afraid of the sunshine
that checquered the street and reddened the
gables and chimnies.

The men seemed in no such haste; they lingered
about the factory, one large group standing
before the gates, and smaller knots occupying
the street for some distance, while a few proceeded
slowly on their way home, chatting with
one or another party as they went. One only
appeared to have nothing to say to his companions,
and to wish to get away quietly, if they
would have let him. He was one of the most

2
respectable looking among them, decent in his
dress, and intelligent though somewhat melancholy
in countenance. He was making his way
without speaking to anybody, when first one and
then another caught him by the button and
detained him in consultation. All seemed anxious
to know what Allen had to relate or to advise;
and Allen had some difficulty in getting leave to
go home, much as he knew he was wanted
there. When he had at length escaped, he
walked so rapidly as presently to overtake his
little daughter, Martha, who had left the factory
somewhat earlier. He saw her before him for
some distance, and observed how she limped, and
how feebly she made her way along the street,
(if such it might be called,) which led to their
abode. It was far from easy walking to the
strongest. There were heaps of rubbish, pools
of muddy water, stones and brickbats lying
about, and cabbage-leaves on which the unwary
might slip, and bones over which pigs were
grunting and curs snarling and fighting. Little
Martha, a delicate child of eight years old, tried
to avoid all these obstacles; but she nearly
slipped down several times, and started when
the dogs came near her, and shivered every time
the mild spring breeze blew in her face.

âMartha, how lame you are to-day!â said
Allen, taking her round the waist to help her
onward.

âO father, my knees have been aching so all
day, I thought I should have dropped every
moment.â

3
âAnd one would think it was Christmas by
your looks, child, instead of a bright May day.â

âIt is very chill after the factory,â said the
little girl, her teeth still chattering. âSure the
weather must have changed, father.â

No; the wind was south, and the sky cloudless.
It was only that the thermometer had
stood at 75Â° within the factory.

âI suppose your wages are lowered as well as
mine,â said Allen; âhow much do you bring
home this week?â

âOnly three shillings, father; and some say it
will be less before long. I am afraid motherââ

The weak-spirited child could not say what it
was that she feared, being choked by her tears.

âCome, Martha, cheer up,â said her father.

âMother
âMother
knows that you get sometimes more
and sometimes less; and, after all, you earn as
much as a piecer as some do at the hand-loom.
There is Field, our neighbour; he and his wife
together do not earn more than seven shillings
a week, you know, and think how much older
and stronger they are than you! We must make
you stronger, Martha. I will go with you to
Mr. Dawson, and he will find out what is the
matter with your knees.â

By this time they had reached the foot of the
stairs which led up to their two rooms in the
third story of a large dwelling which was occupied
by many poor families. Barefooted children
were scampering up and down these stairs at
play; girls nursing babies sat at various elevations,
and seemed in danger of being kicked

4
down as often as a drunken man or an angry
woman should want to pass; a thing which
frequently happened. Little Martha looked up
the steep stairs and sighed. Her father lifted
and carried her. The noises would have stunned
a stranger, and they seemed louder than usual
to accustomed ears. Marthaâs little dog came
barking and jumping up as soon as he saw her,
and this set several babies crying; the shrill
piping of a bulfinch was heard in the din, and
over all, the voice of a scolding woman.

âThat is Sally Fieldâs voice if it is anybodyâs,â
said Allen. âIt is enough to make one shift oneâs
quarters to have that woman within hearing.â

âShe is in our rooms, father. I am sure the
noise is there; and see, her door is open and
her room empty.â

âShe need not fear leaving her door open,â
observed a neighbour in passing. âThere is
nothing there that anybody would wish to carry
away.â

Allen did not answer, but made haste to restore
peace in his own dwelling, knowing that his wife
was far from being a match for Sally Field. As
he flung open the door, the weaker party seemed
to resign the contest to him; his wife sank into
a chair, trembling all over. Her four or five
little ones had hidden themselves where they
could, some under the table, some behind the bed,
having all been slapped or pushed or buffeted
by Sally for staring at her with their thumbs in
their mouths. She was not aware that Sally
Field in a passion was a sight to make any one
stare.

5
Allen carried Martha to a seat in preparation
for turning out Sally Field and locking the door
upon her, which he meant to do by main force
if gentler means should fail. Her surprise at
seeing him, however, and perhaps some degree
of awe of his determined countenance, made her
pause for a moment.

âWhat is all this, wife?â inquired Allen.

âI am sure I donât know. Sally has been
rating me and the children this hour past, and
heaven knows what for.â

Sally proceeded upon this to declare a long
list of offences of which Allenâs family had been
guilty towards her, and Allen suffered her to go
on till she had exhausted her breath. When at
length she lost her voiceâa catastrophe which
happens sooner or later to all scolds,âhe took
up the word.

âIâll tell you what, Sally,â said he; âI am
very sorry for you, and very much ashamed of
you, and I should be more angry on my wifeâs
account than you ever saw me if I did not know
you well, and understand what is at the bottom
of all this. Remember, Sally, I have known
you and your husband since you were this high,
as well as if you had been children of my own.
Donât put me in mind how young you are.
Donât make me treat you like a child when you
have taken upon you so early to be a woman.
Donât make me call your husband to take care
of you as if you could not take care of yourself.â

âCall him! call him and welcome, if you

6
can find him,â cried Sally. âShow me where
he is, and Iâll find a better use for my tongue
than in scolding your mean-spirited wife there
that looks as if she were going to die whenever
one speaks. Go, pray, call my husband.â

âAye, aye; thatâs the grievance, I see,â said
Allen. âWe all have our grievances, Sally,
and it is great folly to make them worse of our
own accord. Do you expect to tempt your
husband to stay at home with you by scolding
as you were doing just now?â

âDo you leave your wife for the twenty-four
hours together?â cried Sally. âDo you make
yourself drunk with your last shilling?âand yet
any man had rather see his wife in a passion
now and then than have her such a poor, puny,
crying creature as your wife is.â

âHush, hush, mistress!â interrupted Allen.
âI will lock the door upon you this moment,
and would have done it before but that you
would raise a mob in the street if I turned you
out. Sally, you know you have not a friend in
the world if you quarrel with us, and what will
you do with your sore heart then?â

The poor creatureâs passion now dissolved in
tears. She threw herself on the bed and sobbed
bitterly. She was left to herself for some time.
Allen produced his weekâs wages, and settled
with his wife how they should be disposed of,
and persuaded her to go out herself and make
the necessary purchases, saying that he would
search for Field and try to get him home.
Allenâs wife sighed.

7
âYou are not afraid to trust me in an alehouse?â
said he smiling.

âBless your heart, no; that I never was nor
ever shall be: but I was thinking of what you
said, that we all have our grievances. Here is
three shillings less wages this week.â

âYes, and another sixpence off Marthaâs too:
but donât fret, wife; we must do as others do,
and be glad if nothing worse happens. See to
poor Marthaâs knees before you go out; she is
more lame than ever to-day.âAnd now, Sally,
if you will promise me to go to your own room,
and stay there till I bring your husband back,
and if you will give me your word to keep the
peace with him whatever he may have been doing,
I will go and search him out, and see what I can
do to make him behave better to you.â

Sally promised to keep the peace, but begged
to stay and take care of the children till their
mother should return. Seeing however that
Martha looked up beseechingly in her fatherâs
face, and that the little ones clung to their
motherâs apron, she cursed herself for having deserved
that they should be afraid of her, and ran
down to bolt herself into her own room and recover
her composure as she might.

As there was no fire, and as Martha was very
discreet for her years, the parents promised the
children to lock them up, that no scold might
come and terrify them while they had to take
care of themselves. Martha was advised to sit
still, and her bulfinch was taken down from the
window and placed beside her to be fed and
watered; the other little things promised to be

8
good, and their father and mother went, the
one to the Spread-Eagle and the other to the
market.

It required no great sagacity to prophesy that
Field would be found at the Spread-Eagle. He
varied his excursions a little, according to times
and seasons: but those who knew his ways could
easily guess at which of his haunts he might be
expected when missing from home. When he
stole out before getting to his loom in the morning,
or after leaving it late at night, he generally
stepped only to the dram-shop, for a glass of gin
to warm him for his work, or to settle him to his
sleep, as his pretence was; but when he had
finished his piece and got his pay, he felt himself
at liberty to go to the Spread-Eagle and have a
carouse, from which he returned in the dark,
sometimes reeling on his own legs, sometimes carried
on other menâs shoulders. This habit of drinking
had grown upon him with frightful rapidity.
He had, a year before, been described by his
employers as a steady, well-behaved lad. He
had fallen in love with Sally and married her in
a hurry, found her temper disagreeable and his
home uncomfortable, tried in vain to keep her in
order, and then, giving up all hope, took to
drinking, and would not tolerate a word of remonstrance
from any one but his old friend
Allen.

There were more customers this evening at the
Spread-Eagle than was usual even on Saturdays.
Allen was warmly welcomed as he entered, for
it was supposed he came to keep company with
his companions from the same factory. Almost

9
all present were spinners and power-loom weavers
under the firm of Mortimer and Rowe; and the
occasion of their assembling in greater numbers
than usual, was the reduction of wages which had
that day taken place. Room was made for
Allen as soon as he appeared, a pipe and pot of
porter called for, and he was welcomed to their
consultation. But Allen looked round instead
of taking his seat, and inquired for Field. The
landlord pointed to a corner where Field lay in a
drunken sleep under a bench.

âLet him lie,â said one. âHe is too far gone
to be roused.â

âWhat concern is it of yours?â cried another.
âCome and listen to what Clack was saying.â

âYou shirked us in the street,â said a third:
ânow we have caught you, we shall not let you
go.â

The landlord being really of opinion that
Field had better lie where he was for an hour or
two, Allen sat down to hear what was going on.

Clack turned to him to know what their masters
deserved for lowering their wages.

âThat depends upon circumstances,â replied
Allen. âBe they much to blame or little, something
must be done to prevent a further reduction,
or many of us will be ruined.â

âShake hands, my fine fellow!â cried Clack.
âThat was just what we had agreed. It is time
such tyranny was put down, and we can put it
down, and we will.â

âGently, gently,â said Allen. âHow do you
think of putting it down?â

10
âWhy should not we root out the one who is
the most of a tyrant, and then the others may
take warning before it is too late? We have
nothing to do but to agree.â

âNo easy matter sometimes, friend.â

âStuff! we have agreed before upon a less
occasion, and when there was danger in it. Had
not we our combinations, when combination
was against the law? and shall not we have
them again now that the law lets us alone?
Shall we be bold in the day of danger and shrink
when that day is over?â

âWell, well, neighbour: I said nothing about
being afraid. What would you have us agree
to do?â

âTo root out Messrs. Mortimer and Rowe.
Every man in our union must be sworn not to
enter their gates; and if this does not frighten
the masters and make them more reasonable, I
donât know what will.â

âAnd if, instead of being frightened, the
masters unite to refuse us work till we give up
our stand against Mortimer and Rowe, what are
we to do then?â

âTo measure our strength against theirs, to
be sure. You know they canât do without us.â

âNor we without them; and where both parties
are so necessary to each other, it is a pity
they should fall out.â

âA pity! To be sure it is a pity; but if
the masters drive us to it, the blame rests with
them.â

âI hope,â said a timid-looking man, Hare by

11
name, who had a habit of twirling his hat when
silent, and of scratching his head when he spoke,
âI hope, neighbour, you will think what you
are about before you mention a strike. Iâve seen
enough of strikes. I had rather see my children
on the parish than strike.â

Clack looked disdainfully at him, and said it was
well that some dove-like folks had not to manage a
fight against the eagle. For his part, he thought
any man ought to be proud of the honour of making
a stand against any oppression; and that he
had rather, for his own share, have the thanks of
the Union Committee than wear Wellingtonâs
star. Would not his friend Allen say the same?

No. Allen agreed with Hare so far as thinking
that there could be few worse evils than a
strike; but at the same time it was an evil which
might become necessary in certain cases. When
convinced that it was necessary in defence of the
rights of the working-man, he would join in it
heart and hand; but never out of spite or revenge,ânever
to root out any master breathing.âSo
many agreed in this opinion, that Clack
grew more eager than ever in defending himself
and blaming the masters in question.

âDare any one say,â he cried, âthat the Dey
of Algiers himself is a greater tyrant than Mortimer
would be if he dared? Does not he look
as if he would trample us under foot if he could?
Does not he smile with contempt at whatever is
said by a working-man? Does not he spurn
every complaint, and laugh at every threat? and

12
if he takes it into his lofty head to do a kindness,
does not he make it bitter with his pride?â

âAll true, Clack, as everybody knows that
works for Mortimer; butâââ

âAnd as for Rowe,â interrupted the talker,
âhe is worse, if possible, in his way.â

âI donât know,â said Hare, doubtfully.
âMr. Rowe came once and talked very kindly
with me.â

âAye, when he had some purpose to answer.
We are all, except you, Hare, wise enough to know
what Roweâs pretty speeches mean. You should
follow him to the next mastersâ meeting, man,
and hear how he alters his tone with his company.
The mean-spirited, shuffling knave!â

âWell, well, Clack; granting that Mortimer
is tyrannical and Rowe not to be trusted,âthat
does not alter the case about rooting them out.
To make the attempt is to acknowledge at the
outset that the object of our union is a bad one:
it will fill the minds of the operatives with foul
passions and provoke a war between masters and
men which will end in the destruction of both.
Whenever we do strike, let it be in defence of
our own rights, and not out of enmity to individuals
among our employers.â

Clack muttered something about there being
shufflers among the men as well as the masters;
to which Allen replied that the way to make
shufflers was to use intimidation. The more
wisdom and moderation there was in the proceedings
of any body of men, the better chance

13
there was of unanimity and determination. He
repeated that, as long as the Union of which he
was a member kept in view the interests of the
body of operatives, he would be found ready to
do and to sacrifice his share; but as soon as it
should set to work on other objects, he should
withdraw at all risks.

Before he had done speaking, the attention of
his companions was called off by an unexpected
addition to their company. Music had been
heard gradually approaching for some minutes,
and now the musician stood darkening the door
and almost deafening the people within with the
extraordinary variety of sounds he produced. An
enormous drum was strapped across his body;
a Panâs pipe employed his mouth, and his hat,
with a pointed crown and a broad brim, was
garnished with bells. A little girl, fantastically
dressed, performed on the triangle, and danced,
and collected halfpence from the bystanders.
While the musician played a jig, jerking his head
incessantly from side to side, nobody thought of
looking particularly at him: but when he turned
to the company within doors and set his little
companion to sing to his playing

âShould auld acquaintance be forgot,â

several of the debaters began to fancy that they
knew the face and figure of the musician. âIt
isâyes, it certainly is Bray!â said one to
another; and many a hand was held out to him.

âI thought you were not likely to forget old
acquaintance, even if they come in a new dress,â

14
said Bray, laughing heartily, and proceeding to
deposit his decorations with one or another of
his former companions. He put his hat on
Allenâs head, slipped the strap of his drum over
Clackâs shoulders, and gave the triangle to
Hare.

âCome,â said he, âlet us have a concert. It
is my turn to see spinners turn strollers. Come,
Allen, shake your head, man, and let us hear
what comes out of it.â

âHow we have wondered,â exclaimed Allen,
âwhat had become of you and yours! Is that
poor little Hannah that used to be so delicate?â

âThe same that your good wife nursed
through the measles. She would hardly know
her now.â

Allen shook his head.

âAh, I see what you mean,â said Bray.
âYou had rather see her covered with white
cotton flakes than with yellow ribands; but
remember it is no fault of mine that she is not
still a piecer in yonder factory; and I donât
know that I need call it my misfortune any more
than my fault. Look how strong and plump she
is! so much for living in the open air, instead of
being mewed up in a place like an oven. Now,
donât take off the hat on purpose to shake your
head. What can a man doâââ and looking
round, he appealed to the company, âwhat can
a proscribed man do but get his living, so as not
to have to ask for work?â

A loud clapping and shuffling of feet was the
answer to his question. The noise half roused

15
the drunken man in the corner, who rolled himself
over to the terror of little Hannah, who had
got as far as she could out of the way of the
smokers, among whom her father had been so
well received. Allen rose to go, having some
hope that Field might be safely set on his legs
again by this time. He asked Bray whether he
meant to stay in the neighbourhood, and where
he would lodge.

âYou must stay,â cried one, âand play a
tune before your old mastersâ gates.â

âYou must stay,â said another, âand see how
we manage a strike now-a-days.â

âA strike! Are you going to try your
strength again? You will make me wish I was
one of you still; but I can head the march.
Stay? Yes, Iâll stay and lead you on to victory.
Hurra! Iâll go recruiting with my drum. Iâll
manage to meet Mortimer, when I have a procession
a mile long at my heels!â

âYou lay by your drum on Sundays, I suppose?â
said Allen.

âYes, yes. We keep within and take our
rest on Sundays. It is as great a treat to us to
sit within doors all day once a week, as it is
to some other folks to get into the green meadows.
If the landlord can give us lodging,
you will find us here in the morning, Allen.â

âLet Hannah go home with me, Bray. I
know my wife will be glad to see her and to
hear her story, and this is no place for a child.
If I can rouse yon sleeper, I will go now, and
send my wife with a cloak or something to hide

16
the childâs frippery, and then she will spend to-morrow
in a fitter place than a public-house.â

Bray sat gravely looking at his child for a
few moments, and then started up, saying that
he would undertake to rouse the sleeper. Blowing
the Panâs pipe close by his ear made him
start, and a rub-a-dub on the drum woke him up
effectually: so that he was able, cross and
miserable, to crawl homewards with the help of
Allenâs arm, and to be put to bed by his wife
with the indistinct dread in his mind of a terrible
lecture as soon as he should be in a condition to
listen to it.

Chapter II.

CHILDâS GOSSIP.

Much business was transacted at the Spread-Eagle
on the Sunday by the Committee of the
Union. It was the general opinion that a great
struggle between masters and men was on the
eve of taking place, and measures were adopted
for finding out what was the disposition of the
operative spinners respecting a general strike, if
an equalization of wages was not to be obtained
by other means. It had been agreed on the Saturday
night that twenty-five members of the Union
should employ the Sunday in obtaining the

17
names of as many as were willing to turn out, or
to subscribe for the assistance of those who
should turn out, in case of opposition from the
masters. These twenty-five men were to bring
in their reports on Sunday night; after which, if
the affair should look promising, a petition was
to be addressed to the masters, for a public meeting,
at which an equalization of wages was to be
agreed on.

Clack was somewhat at a loss how to apportion
his own business, and that of other people,
on this occasion. Having a very high opinion
of his own powers of persuasion, and being confident
of his knowledge of law, he wanted to be
everywhere at once, and to guide all the movements
of the people he employed. As this was
impossible, however, he thought it best to
remain in some known place of appeal where
parties might come to him for direction and
information. He therefore sat at the Spread-Eagle
all day big with importance, and dissatisfied
only because his underlings could not
be about their business abroad, and listening to
him at the same time.

The Allens knew nothing of what was going
forward. Mrs. Allen was so full of interest and
curiosity about little Hannah Bray, that she had
no thoughts to bestow on public affairs, as the
transactions of the Union were commonly called.
Her husband had gone early into the country
with Bray this day dressed like other people, to
visit some relations of the latter, who did not
know what had become of him after he had been

18
refused employment in Manchester, and obliged
to betake himself to some new mode of obtaining
a livelihood.

Little Hannah slept till the sun was high on
the Sunday morning, and might have slept
longer if Mrs. Allen had not feared she would
not get breakfast over in time for church.
Hannah jumped up with the excuse that the
place was so quiet, there was nothing to wake
her.

âIndeed!â said Mrs. Allen. âWe think the
children and the neighbours make a great deal
of noise; but I suppose you sleep in public-houses
for the most part.â

Hannah observed that people call so loud for
what they want in public-houses, and they care
so little for hours, that there is no knowing when
you may sleep quietly.

âHave you no other frock than that, my
dear?â asked Mrs. Allen. âI suppose you go to
church on Sundays, and you cannot possibly go
in all those gay ribands.â

âO no,â said Hannah. âI have a dark frock
for Sundays, and a straw bonnet; but they are
in fatherâs pack, and I suppose that is at the
Spread-Eagle.â

âAnd he is gone into the country for the
day. Well, you must change with Martha when
church time comes. Poor Martha has but one
tidy frock; but she is too lame to go out to-day,
even as far as the apothecaryâs; and I am sure
she will lend you her frock and tippet to go to
church in.â

19
Martha was willing to lend but had rather put
on her factory dress than Hannahâs red frock
with yellow trimmings. Hannah hinted that
she should like to stay within with Martha all
day; and the indulgent mother, seeing Marthaâs
pleasure at the prospect of a companion and
nurse of her own age, left the little girls to
amuse themselves, while she took the younger
children to church with her as usual.

âFather says he heard you sing last night,â
said Martha when they were left alone. âWill
you sing to me?â

âI am so tired of singing!â pleaded Hannah.
âI donât know many songs, and I sing them
so very often! Wonât that bird do as well?
Let me get down the cage, may I?â

âYes, do, and we will give him some water,
poor fellow! He is my bird and I feed him every
day. Somebody that could not afford to keep
him sold him to father, and father gave him to
me. Had you ever a bird?â

âNo, but I had a monkey once. When we
went away, father got a monkey, and I used to
lead him about with a string; but I was glad
when we had done with him, he was so mischievous.
Look here how he tore my arm one
day, when somebody had put him in a passion
with giving him empty nutshells.â

âWhat a terrible place!â said Martha. âWas
it long in getting well?â

âNo; father got an apothecary to tie it up,
and it soon got well.â

âMy father is going to show my knees to

20
Mr. Dawson, the apothecary. Do look how
they are swelled; and they ache so, you canât
think.â

âO, but I can think, for mine used to ache
terribly when I walked and stood before the
wheels all day.â

âBut yours were never so bad as mine, or I
am sure you could not dance about as you do.â

âNot so bad, to be sure, and my arms
were never so shrunk away as yours. Look, my
arm is twice as big as yours.â

âI wonder whatâs the reason,â sighed Martha.
âMother says I get thinner and thinner.â

âYou should have meat for dinner every day
as I have,â said Hannah, âand then you would
grow fat like me. Father gets such good
dinners for us to what we used to have. He says
âtis that, and being in the air so much that prevents
my being sickly, as I used to be. I donât
think I could do the work that I used to do with
all that noise, and the smell of oil and the heat.â

âAnd I am sure I could not sing and dance
as you do.â

âNo, how should you dance when you are
so lame?â

âAnd I donât think I can sing at all.â

âCome, try, and I will sing with you. Try
âGod save the king.ââ

âIt is Sunday,â said Martha gravely.

âWell, I thought people might sing âGod
save the kingâ on Sundays. I have heard father
play it on the drum, just before the Old Hundred.
You know the Old Hundred.â

21
Martha had heard this hymn-tune at church,
and she tried to sing it; but Hannah burst out
a laughing.

âLord! Martha, your voice is like a little
twittering birdâs. Canât you open your mouth
and sing this way?â

âNo, I canât,â said Martha, quite out of
breath; âand besides, Hannah, you should not
say âLord!â Father and mother never let us say
those sort of words.â

âNor my father either. He is more angry
with me for that, than for anything; but it slips
out somehow, and you would not wonder if you
knew how often I hear people say that, and many
worse things.â

âWorse things?â said Martha, looking
curious.

âYes; much worse things; but I am not
going to tell you what they are, because father
made me promise not to tell you about any of
the bad people that I have heard swear and seen
tipsy. Was your father ever tipsy?â

âNot that I know of; but our neighbour
Field is often tipsy. I am afraid every day that
he will topple down stairs.â

âMy father was tipsy once,â said Hannah,
âand he beat me so, you canât think.â

âWhen? Lately?â

âNo, just after we began to stroll. Though
it is so long ago, I remember it very well, for I
was never so frightened in my life. I did not
know where to go to get away from him; and the
people pushed him about and laughed at me the

22
more the more I cried. I asked him afterwards
not to get tipsy any more, and he said he never
would, and he never has. It was only because
we had got more money that day than we ever
got in a day before: but it soon went away, for
when father woke the next morning, his pocket
was quite empty.â

âAnd did you soon get some more money?â

âO yes; we get some every day except Sundays.
I carry the hat round every time we stop
to play, and I always get some halfpence and
sometimes a silver sixpence.â

âAh! then, you get a great deal more than I
do, Hannah. I brought home only three shillings
this week.â

âI take much more than that, to be sure; but
then it is my fatherâs earning more than mine.
His great drum sounds farther and brings more
people to listen than my triangle.â

âIs your triangle here? I wish you would
teach me to play,â said Martha. âNow do. If
you will, I will ask mother to show us the pictures
in grandfatherâs bible when she comes
home.â

Hannah had been very fond of these pictures
when she was recovering from the measles; and
this bribe and her goodnature together overcame
her disgust at the instrument she had to play
every day and almost all day long. She indulged
herself with a prodigious yawn, and then began
her lesson. When Mrs. Allen came back, she
found the bulfinch piping at his loudest pitch to
the accompaniment of the triangle, Hannah

23
screaming her instructions to her new pupil, and
poor palefaced little Martha flushed with flattery
and with the grand idea of earning a great many
silver sixpences every day if her father would let
her make music in the streets instead of going to
the factory.

Chapter III.

NO UNION OF MASTERS.

The achievements of the twenty-five who canvassed
for support during Sunday were such as to
put Clack into high spirits. The list of names with
signatures or marks annexed, amounted to several
thousands; and if the orator had been allowed
to have his own way, he would have proclaimed
war against the masters at once, and the turn-out
would have begun on the Monday morning: but
there were a few soberer folks than himself engaged
in the consultation; and these smiled at
his brag of the many thousand pounds that
would pour in from Leeds, Coventry, Liverpool,
Glasgow, and other places, and insisted upon
offering the masters the option of a peaceable
agreement before any measures of opposition
were taken.

Clack retorted that these men were afraid of
their wives, and declared that they might wait

24
long for a strike if it was necessary to refrain till
the women voted for it, since there was never a
woman yet who did not hate a turn-out as she
would the plague.

This observation called forth some joke at his
expense, for Clack was known to be engaged to
be married, and it was thought he spoke from
awkward experience. In the eagerness of defence
he went a step too far. He asked if it was
likely, knowing the disposition of the women on
this subject, that he should consult any woman
breathing as to the part he should take, or provoke
opposition from any female tongue, or care
for it if he should happen to meet with it. These
words were, as he might have expected, carried
to the ears which should never have heard them,
and prevented his next meeting with his betrothed
from being the pleasantest in the world. While
a storm was brewing at a distance in consequence
of his indiscreet boast, Clack made himself very
merry with those who were less bold than himself.

âWhere is Hare to-day? Henpecked, I
warrant. Did not he promise faithfully to be one
of the twenty-five?â

âYes, and he is no where to be found,â said a
neighbour.

âBut I wonder, Clack, you troubled yourself
to take a promise from such a shilly-shally
fellow as Hare. His being married has nothing
to do with it: he was never in the same mind
for an hour together from his youth up.â

âHow did he get married then?â

25
âO there was another and a steadier mind
concerned in that matter, you know: not that I
mean any harm against his wife: she is as mild
as she is sensible. I only mean that her judgment
strengthens his when they have to act
together.â

âThen I suppose she does not like the idea of
a strike any better than the other women, and
persuades him not to come?â

âMore likely she knows nothing of it. If there
is one thing rather than another that Hare is afraid
of, it is combination. That imprisonment of his
father under the old combination laws made him
a coward for life; and there is no use in telling
him that the law leaves us to manage our own
business now as long as we keep the peace.â

âHe does, indeed, make a pitiful figure
between his dread of belonging to the Union
and his horror of being left out. But why do
we waste our breath upon him? Who has seen
Allen to-day, and why does he not come? We
shall count his modesty for backwardness if he
does not take care.â

âDonât be in a hurry to blame a better man
than yourself,â said a neighbour. âAllen has
been in the country all day.â

There was no offence in such a comparison;
for Allen was generally looked up to as the first
man in that branch of the Union, though he was
so little aware of his own merits that he did not
come forward so much as he should have done,
except on urgent occasions; and then he never
failed to do all that was expected of him.

26
When the petition to the masters to hold a
public meeting was prepared, and when Clack
had appointed himself and two others to carry it
round the next day, the Committee terminated
their present sitting.

The first firm to which the deputies addressed
their petition was that of Mortimer and Rowe.

âAre the partners at home?â they inquired.

âI donât know whether Mr. Mortimer is here
yet, but there is Mr. Rowe. Sir! Mr. Rowe!â
called the clerk, as he saw the junior partner
making his escape, âthese men wish to speak
with you, sir, if you please.â

Mr. Rowe, perceiving that he had been seen,
came forward to be spoken with.

âA public meeting,âequalization of wages,âaye,
very fair: hum! very well, my good
fellows. Well: what do you want me to do?â

âTo give your voice in favour of this public
meeting.â

âWhy, you know you have a good friend in
me. You surely cannot anticipate any difficulty
with me. I am a friend of peace, you know.
No man more so.â

âAye, sir: but there is more than one sort
of peace. The masters have called it peace when
they had all their own way, and their men were
cowed by the law and dared not openly resist.
The men call it peace when the two parties have
confidence in each other, and make a cordial
agreement, and keep to it. This is what we want
at the present time.â

So said Gibson, whose turn it was to be

27
spokesman; but Clack could not help putting in
his word.

âAnd if either party refuses peace, you know,
sir, the next thing is war.â

âO, no war!â said Mr. Rowe. âA cordial
agreement, as you say, is the right thing. So,
for this purpose you wish for a public meeting.
Well; I shall be happy to attend a public meeting,
ifâââ

âWe are happy to find you so agreeable, sir.
Will you just sign for self and partner, if you
please.â

âSign! I see no signatures.â

âBecause you happen to be the first person
we have applied to, sir; that is all. We hope
for signatures plenty before the day is over.
Will you please to sign, as you approve of the
meeting?â

Mr. Rowe suddenly recollected that he must
consult his partner who sat in a back room. The
men had not to wait long. The junior partner,
indeed, did not appear again, but Mr. Mortimer
issued forth, looking not a whit less haughty
than usual. He begged the deputies would make
the best of their way off his premises, as he had
nothing to say to them.

What were his sentiments respecting the meeting,
if they might inquire?

His sentiments were, that the masters had been
far too tolerant already of the complaints of the
men; and that it was time the lower orders were
taught their proper place. He had neither leisure

28
nor inclination to argue with any of them,
either there or elsewhere; so the sooner they
took themselves off the better.

âYou may live to change your sentiments,
sir,â observed Gibson.

âBeware of threats!â said Mr. Mortimer.
âThere is law yet for the punishment of threats,
remember.â

âI have neither forgotten the law, Mr. Mortimer,
nor used threats. I said, and I say again,
you may live to change your sentiments; and,
for your own sake, it is to be hoped you will.
Good morning, sir.â

âHe is too busy even to wish us good morning,â
observed Clack. âHow coolly he looked
over the letter he took from his clerk, as if we
were not worth attending to for a moment!â

âHaughty as he is,â said Gibson, âI would
sooner bear with his pride than Roweâs behaviour
or Elliotâs.â

âThey are young men, Gibson, and Mortimer
is old, and we would sooner bear with an old
manâs mistakes than a young manâs, be they what
they may! Where next? To Elliottâs?â

âYes, we are sure of being ill-treated there;
so the sooner it is over the better.â

As they approached Mr. Elliottâs house, they
perceived that gentleman mounted on his favourite
hunter, and in the act of leaving his own
door. He was too much occupied with his own
affairs to see them coming, for the most important
part of his morningâs business was setting
off for his ride; and he had eyes for little else

29
while he was admiring the polish of his boots,
adjusting his collar, settling the skirts of his
coat, and patting his horseâs neck. Clack was
not the man for ceremony; he came straight up
before the horse, and laid his hand on the handsome
new rein, saying, âBy your leave, sirââ

âHands off,â cried Elliott, giving him a cut
across the knuckles with his riding whip. âHow
dare you stop me? How dare you handle my
rein with your greasy fingers?â

âHow would you get such a rein, I wonder,
sir, if we did not grease our fingers in your
service?â said Clack, indignantly.

âIâm in a hurry,â said Elliott; âyou can speak
to the people within, if you want any thing.â

âWe will not detain you, sir,â said Taylor,
who was now spokesman, âbut nobody but
yourself can answer our question.â And he told
the story in a few words, and put the petition
into the gentlemanâs hands.

Elliott glanced his eye over it as well as the
restlessness of his horse would permit, and then
struck it contemptuously with his riding-whip into
the mud, swore that that was the proper place for
such a piece of insolence, rode up against the
men, and pranced down the street without bestowing
another look or word upon them.

âPride comes before a fall; let the gentleman
take care of himself,â said Gibson, quietly
picking up the petition and wiping off the mud
with his handkerchief.

Clack talked about using his greasy fingers to
cram the soiled petition down the gentlemanâs

30
throat, and seemed disposed to harangue the
laughing bystanders; but his more prudent companions
took him by the arm and led him away.
Mr. Elliottâs clerk, who had seen the whole proceeding
from an upper window, and was ashamed
of his masterâs conduct, came after them, out of
breath, to ask them in while he copied the petition,
which was not, as he observed, fit to show
to any other gentleman. Gibson thanked him
for his civility, but observed that the soiled paper
would tell part of their story better than they
could tell it themselves. The clerk, therefore,
slowly returned, saying to himself that it is a pity
when young men, coming to a large fortune obtained
in trade, forget by whose means their
wealth was acquired, and by what tenure it is held.

After visiting several manufacturers, some of
whom were more and others less favourable to their
claims than they expected, the deputies requested
an interview with Mr. Wentworth. Mr. Wentworth
had been rich as a young man, had failed
through unavoidable misfortunes, and had worked
his way up again to a competence, after having
paid every shilling he owed. He was now an
elderly man, homely in his person, somewhat
slovenly in his dress, not much given to talk,
and, when he did speak, causing some surprise
and weariness to strangers by the drawling twang
of his speech. Those who knew him well, however,
had rather hear his voice than any music;
and such of his men as belonged to the Union
agreed that ten words from him were worth a
speech of an hour long from Clack. There was,

31
to be sure, no need for so many words from him
as from other people, for he practised a great
variety of inarticulate sounds, the meaning of
which was well understood by those accustomed
to converse with him, and served all the purposes
of a reply.

Mr. Wentworth was sitting at his desk when
the deputies were introduced. As they uncovered
their heads and made their bow, some murmurings
and clutterings reached them which they
understood as a welcome. He looked steadily
at them from under his shaggy eyebrows while
they explained their business, and then took the
petition to look over.

âYou can hardly have any paper-makers in
your Union,â said he, chuckling as he unfolded
the sheet; âor are you saving your pence
against a strike, that you canât afford paper as
fair as your writing?â

âAye, aye; wait a while and you will see him
grow wiser,â was his observation on hearing the
story of Elliottâs insolence. âWe were all boys
before we were men.âHum:âequalization.âWho
will avouch that this equalization is all that
you want?â

âI, sir,â said the ever-ready ClackââI drew
it up, and so I ought to know.â

Gibson observed, that though no further object
was expressly contemplated by the Union, he
would not answer for their not increasing their
demands as they proceeded. If there was any
attempt to equalize the wages by reducing all to
the lowest now given, the Union would demand
an advance.

32
âWho gives the lowest?â inquired Mr. Wentworth.

âExcept some upstarts whom we can easily
manage, Mortimer and Rowe give the lowest,
and you, sir, the next lowest, and Elliott the
highest.â

âWho was lamenting lately that the combination
laws were repealed, so that the masters
cannot be prosecuted for oppression? Who proposed
to burn them in effigy, tied to one
anotherâs necks?â

The deputies looked at one another, and then
answered that all this was only private talk of
one of their meetings; it was never meant for
earnest.

âWell, I only let you know that you may
look about your Committee-room and find where
the little bird builds that carries the matter; and
if you canât find her, take care that she has nothing
to carry that you would be ashamed to own.
Did you learn from her that the masters combine
against you?â

âWe learn it from our own eyes, and ears,
and senses,â said Clack. âHave not masters
oppressed their men from the beginning of the
world?â

âIndeed I donât know,â said Mr. Wentworth.
âIf Adam had a gardener under him in Paradise,
they might have tried to turn one another out,
but I never heard of it.â

âStuff and nonsense, sir, begging your pardon.
Donât we know that masters always have
lorded it over the poor? They were born with a
silver spoon in their mouths, andâââ

33
âI wonder where mine is,â observed Mr.
Wentworth; âI will look in my motherâs plate
chest for it.â

The orator went on,â

âThey openly treat us like slaves as long as
they can, and when we will bear it no longer,
they plot in secret against us. They steal to one
anotherâs houses when they think we are asleep;
they bolt their doors and fill their glasses to
their own prosperity, and every bumper that goes
down their throats is paid for with the poor
manâs crust.â

âThey must have made the little bird tipsy,
Clack, before she carried you such a strange
story as that.â

âDonât tell me, sir, that it is not true! Donât
tell me!â

âI am not telling you anything; for the
plain reason, that I have nothing to tell. I only
want to ask you one or two things, as you seem
to know so much more than we do. Pray what
have the masters combined for just now?â

âTo lower our wages, to be sure.â

âAnd yet Mortimer pays one rate, and I
another, and Elliott another. Why donât I ask
as much labour for my money as Mortimer?â

âYou dare not,â cried Clack.

âYou know itâs not fair,â said Taylor.

âYou are not the man to grind the poor,â
said Gibson.

âYou have not hit it, any of you. You all
seem to think it is a matter of pure choice with
us, what wages we give.â

34
âTo be sure,â said Clack, âand that is the
reason we want parliament to settle the matter
at once and for ever.â

âParliament has no more choice in the matter
than we masters,â drily observed Mr. Wentworth.
âIf ever Parliament passes a Bill to regulate
wages, we must have a rider put to it to decree
how much rain must fall before harvest.â

Clack muttered something about not standing
any longer to be trifled with; but his companions
thought it possible that Mr. Wentworth
might have something to say that was worth
hearing, and persuaded the orator to be quiet.
Gibson inquired,â

âWhere then does the choice rest, sir, if
neither with the government nor the masters?â

âSuch power as there is rests with those who
take, not with those who give wages. Not such
power as tips our friendâs tongue there,â nodding
at Clack, ânot such power as you gain by the
most successful strike, not such power as combination
gives you, be it peaceable or threatening;
but a much more lasting power which
cannot be taken from you. The power of the
masters is considerable, for they hold the administration
of capital; but it is not on this that
the rate of wages depends. It depends on the
administration of labour; and this much greater
power is in your hands.â

The deputies thought that they who pay wages
must always have power over those who receive.

âThat is as much as saying that wages are a
gift. I thought you had supposed them your
right.â

35
All were eager to urge the rights of industry.

âAye, all very true; no right can be clearer
when we see what wages are. Come, Clack,
tell us, (for who knows if you donât?) tell us
what wages Adam gave his under gardeners.
You canât say? Why, I thought you knew all
that the masters did at the beginning of the
world. Well, when Adam was some hundred
years old, (you may trust me, for I am descended
from him in a straight line,) he said to Eve,
âStay you here and spin with the women, while
I go yonder and set my men to delve; and donât
expect us back in a hurry, for tillage is tough
work here to what it was in Eden, and we must
gather our crops before we can bring them to
market. Come, my good fellows, work hard
and you shall have your shares.â âAnd pray, sir,â
said the men, âwhat are we to live upon while
our fruit and vegetables are growing?â âWhy,â
says Adam, âinstead of my sharing the fruit with
you when it is grown, suppose you take your
portion in advance. It may be a convenience to
you, and it is all the same thing to me.â So the
men looked at the ground, and calculated how
much digging and other work there would be,
and then named their demand; not in silver
money with king Georgeâs head upon it, but food
and clothing, and tools.â

âThen at harvest time,â observed Gibson,
âthe whole produce belonged to Adam?â

âOf course. The commodity was made up,
like all commodities, of capital and labour:
Adamâs capital and the menâs labour.â

36
âAnd of a deal besides,â cried Clack. âIf
it was grain, there was the root, and the stalk,
and the ear; and if it was fruit, there was the
rind, and the pulp, and the juice.â

âBegging your pardon, friend, there was
nothing but capital and labour. Without labour,
and the soil and the tools which made the capital,
there would have been neither grain nor fruit;
and if grain and fruit grew wild, they could be
no commodity without labour, any more than
the diamond in the mine, and the pearl in the
sea, are a commodity before the one is dug, and
the other fished up. Well, Adam and his men
expected to get as much by their crop as would
pay for their subsistence and their toil; and this
much the men asked, and Adam was willing to
give, and a fair surplus remained over for himself.
So they made their bargain, and he bought
their share of the commodity, and had to himself
all the flax and other things that his produce exchanged
for in the market. And so that season
passed off, and all were contented.â

âAnd what happened next season, sir?â

âNext season, twice the number of men came
to ask work in the same plot of ground. Adam
told them that he had very little more wages to
pay away than he had the year before, so that if
they all wanted to work under him they must be
content with little more than half what each had
formerly earned. They agreed, and submitted
to be rather pinched; but they hoped it would be
only for a time, as it was a very fine harvest
indeed, so much labour having been spent upon

37
it, and there being a fine profit into Adamâs
pocket.â

âDid they wear pockets then, sir?â

âNo doubt; for the women were improving
their tailoring, as much as the men their gardening,
and expecting, like them, to increase their
gains in consequence; and so they would have
done, but that four times the number of labourers
appeared next year, so that, notwithstanding the
increase of capital, each had not so much as one-third
the original wages; and the men grew
very cross, and their wives very melancholy.
But how could Adam help it?â

âWhy did not the men carry their labour
elsewhere?â asked Clack contemptuously.

âWhy do you go on spinning for Mortimer
and Rowe, when Elliott pays higher wages?â

âBecause nobody is taking on new hands. I
canât get work.â

âWell, nobody was taking on new hands
in Adamâs neighbourhood; all the capital was
already employed.â

âBut I donât mean to go on so,â said Clack.
âI shall strike with all the rest of Mortimerâs
men, if we donât get better paid.â

âAye, it is as I thought, Clack. Adamâs
head labourer was your grandfather, for he said
just the same thing you are saying; and what is
more, he did it. They all turned out, every man
of them, and let the field take care of itself.â

âAnd what happened?â

âOnly half a harvest came up; so that, of
course, wages were lower than ever next year. The

38
worst folly of all was that they went on to blame
Adam, though he showed them that the harvest
would not even pay its own expenses; much
less leave anything to divide between him and
them. âYou talk to me,â says he, âas if I could
get capital down from the clouds as fast as I
please: whereas you might have seen from the
beginning, that I have a certain quantity and no
more. If you choose to bring a thousand
labourers to live upon the capital which was
once divided among a hundred, it is your fault
and not mine that you are badly off.ââ

âIf the thousand men agreed to live for so
little, it was their own affair, to be sure.â

âAnd if they did not agree, their bidding
against each other could not shift the blame
upon Adam. If there was such competition
among the men as to enable him to obtain more
labour for the same wages, he was not to blame,
was he, for employing three men for what he
had at first paid to one?â

âNor were the men to blame, sir, for bargaining
for such wages as were to be had.â

âCertainly. Where then was the evil?â

âClearly in there being too many hands
for the work to be done,â replied Gibson. âBut
who could help that, sir?â

âNobody could relieve the immediate pressure,
Gibson, unless some had the means of taking
themselves off, or of applying their labour to
some employment which was less overstocked;
but all had it in their power to prevent the evil
returning. By foresight and care, labour may

39
be proportioned to capital as accurately as my
machinery to the power of my steam-engine.â

âWhat has all this to do with our petition?â
asked the orator, who was impatient of remaining
so long in the background.

âA great deal,â replied Gibson. âMr. Wentworth
means to point out how much rests with
the masters, and how much with the men, and to
warn us against a strike. But, sir, about equalization
of wages: you think that fair enough, I
suppose. In the very same market, and under
the very same circumstances, labour ought to be
paid at the same rate, surely?â

âOne circumstance, you know, is the extent
of the masterâs capital, which is seldom the same
in any two cases, and on which his power of
waiting for his returns depends. But I agree
with you that a man cannot safely lower his rate
of wages much and permanently below that of
his competitors, and that an equalization of
wages is desirable for all parties; so I will sign
my agreement to your wish for a public meeting.
Coming, Charles, coming.â

Gibson had observed Mr. Wentworthâs old gray
pony in the yard for some time, and he now saw
that Charles looked tired of leading it backwards
and forwards while the animal turned its head
one way and another, as if looking for its usually
punctual master. While helping the gentleman
on with the heavy great-coat, which he wore
winter and summer, the deputy apologized for
having kept the rider and his steed so long
asunder.

40
âNever mind,â drawled Mr. Wentworth.
âDobbin and I have two rounds, a long, and a
short; and I dare say he has made up his mind
already which it will be to-day. If I have
helped you to a short cut to your business, you
will not think your time wasted any more than
I.â Then as he buttoned the last button, and
pulled his hat over his brows, âThatâs well: all
tight. Hey ho, Dobbin! Good day to ye all.â

The shaggy pony pricked up his ears,
quickened his pace, and well nigh nodded to his
master at the sound of his voice. When Mr.
Wentworth scrambled up into the saddle and left
the yard at a funeral pace, the deputies looked
with much more respect on him and his equipage,
than on the brilliant spectacle they had met at
Elliottâs door.

Chapter IV.

UNION OF MEN.

As soon as it was ascertained that, though many
of the masters declined committing themselves
by signing their names, most or all of them
would attend the desired meeting, Clack took
upon himself to issue a placard, whose large red
and black letters attracted the eyes of all who
could read. It made known the intention of the

41
masters to meet at the York Hotel, on the Wednesday
afternoon, and of the Committee of the
men to hold a previous meeting at the Spread
Eagle, in the morning, in order to prepare resolutions
to be laid before the masters. The Committee
was to be escorted to and fro by a circuitous
route by a procession; and the place appointed
where those were to meet who wished to
make a part of the show, was St. Georgeâs Fields.
The placard began and ended by an appeal to the
people to guard their rights against oppression.
Many were surprised at the anxiety of the leading
men among the spinners to disown this
placard. It seemed to the crowd very spirited
and eloquent, and they began to look out their
decorations for the procession.

Bray was one of the first on the spot, piping,
drumming, and shaking his bells at the appearance
of every new group. Other musicians
joined the train, flags were displayed, the women
gathered to look on, the children cheered and
brought green boughs, and all had the appearance
of rejoicing, though it would have been
difficult for any one to say what there was to
rejoice about. Many had no clear idea of what
was doing or going to be done: some had no
idea at all, and those who knew best thought it
a pity that such a display should have been made
as might bear the appearance of being intended
to intimidate the masters. The Committee were
so generally of this opinion, that they did not
attend, but went quietly, one by one, to the
Spread Eagle; so that, in fact, the procession

42
was formed to escort Clack, and nobody else.
This was all the more glorious for him, he
thought; and he walked proudly just behind the
chief musician, Bray, now shaking hands from
side to side, now bowing with his hand on his
heart, now bidding all halt and giving the signal
for groans or cheers. There were three groans
at Mortimer and Roweâs, and three cheers at
Elliottâs, which were received with infinite disdain
by that gentleman as he sat at his breakfast
table, balancing his egg-spoon and glancing at
the newspaper. The procession next overtook
Mr. Wentworth in Chancery Lane, pacing to
business on his gray pony. All eyes were
turned to Clack for a signal whether to groan or
cheer. There was, in the meanwhile, a faint
beginning of each, at which the pony looked
more astonished than his master, who only
chuckled and murmured in his usual manner as
he looked upon the assemblage with a quiet
smile.

âWhat do you expect to get by this fine
show?â said he to a youth near him.

âCheap bread! Hurrah!â cried the lad waving
his bludgeon, and wishing there was a loaf
on the top of it.

âAnd you, and you, and you?â said Mr.
Wentworth to one and another as they passed.

âNo potato peelings! Reform and good
wages! Liberty and cheap bread!â cried they,
according to their various notions. The childrenâs
only idea was (and it was the wisest) that
it was a holiday, with a procession and a band of
music.

43
When Clack had got a little a-head of the
slow-moving pony and its rider, he decided to
halt and hold a short parley. Advancing with a
bow, he said,

âYou call yourself the poor manâs friend, I
believe, sir?â

âNo manâs enemy, I hope,â replied Mr. Wentworth.

âThen allow us the honour of giving you
three cheers on your pledge to support our interests
this evening. Hats off!â

âBetter wait awhile,â said Mr. Wentworth.
âCheers will keep, and I dislike unnecessary
pledges.â

Clack looked suspicious, and nods and winks
went round.

âWe might differ, you know, as to what your
interests are, and then I might seem to break
my word when I did not mean it.â

âLet him go free,â said a bystander. âHe
knows the consequences if he opposes us.â

âThat is rather a strange way of letting
me go free,â observed the gentleman, smiling.
âHowever, friend, threats are empty air to a
man who knows his own mind; and my mind is
made up to consider the interests of all, come
groans, come cheers.â

âIt is not everybody, sir, who would speak
so independently,âto our faces too.â

âTrue, friend. All the masters and all the
men have not my years, and have not learned to
look steadily in honest faces; and that is why I
am sorry to see this parade, which looks too much

44
like intimidation. Come now, be persuaded. I will
give you house-room for your flags, and my old
friend Bray there shall not lose his job; he shall
make it a holiday to the children in my factory.â

It was too much to ask of Clack. He could
not give up his procession, and so made haste to
march on. As Mr. Wentworth turned in at his
factory gate in Ancoats Street, every man in the
long train bowed respectfully. In his case, the
regard of his neighbours was not measured by
the rate of wages he paid.

The procession, having deposited Clack at the
Spread-Eagle, was by no means so ready to depart
as to arrive. They insisted that it should
be an open meeting, and that they should have a
voice in the demands to be offered to the masters.
They rushed through the house to the skittle-ground
behind, caused a table with paper and
ink to be placed in an arbour, and, setting the
Committee entirely aside on the plea that this
was a special occasion, began to call aloud for
Allen to take the chair. Allen was nowhere to
be found on the premises, for the good reason
that he was at his work, and knew little of what
was going on. Being sent for, he presently appeared
and asked what he was wanted for.

âTo take the chair.â

But Allen was too modest to accept the honour
at a word; he drew back, and urged his being
totally unused to come forward at public meetings,
and named several who understood the
management of that kind of business better than
himself. Those that he named were all single

45
men; for he bore in mind,âand this certainly
added to his reluctance,âthat the sin of taking a
prominent part in a combination of workmen, is
apt to be remembered against the sinner when
the days of trouble are over; and he felt that a
family man was not the one who ought to be
made to incur the risk.âWhen further pressed,
he did not scruple to declare this to be one of his
objections; but the people were in the humour to
overcome objections, and they promised faithfully
that he and his family should not be injured;
that if discharged from the factory, they should
be maintained by the Union; and that as no one
knew so much of their affairs as Allen, as he
could express himself with moderation in speech,
and with ease on paper, he was the man to be at
the head of their affairs, and that it was his
bounden duty to accept the office.

Allen could not deny this, and did not, therefore,
dally with his duty; but it cost him a bitter
pang. While Clack listened and looked on with
a feeling of jealousy, and thought it a moment
of triumph such as he would fain have enjoyed
himself, he little knew how little Allen was to be
envied. He could not guess what feelings
rushed on Allenâs mind at the moment that he
took the decisive step into the arbour and seated
himself at the table, and received the pen into his
hand. Thoughts of the dismay of his timid wife,
of the hardships to which he might expose his
children, of the difficulties of his office, and the
ill-will which its discharge must sometimes bring
upon him,âthoughts of the quarrels in which he

46
must mediate, and of the distress which, in case of
a turn-out, he must witness, without much power
to relieve,âmight have overcome a man of
firmer nerve than Allen; but though they distressed,
they did not conquer him, convinced as
he was that he ought not to evade the choice of
the people. His fellow-labourers allowed him a
few minutes to collect his thoughts before addressing
them, and while he was seemingly arranging
the papers before him, they packed
themselves and one another closely, in order to
leave room for new comers, without creating a
noise and bustle. Those who stood nearest the
arbour hung the flags so as to make a sort of
canopy over it, and a few of the most efficient of
the standing Committee took their places on
each side of Allen.âHis address was in natural
accordance with the feelings which had just passed
through his mind:â

âCombinations are necessary, my fellow-labourers,
when one set of men is opposed to
another, as we are to our masters. The law
could not prevent combinations, even when
severe punishments visited those who were engaged
in them; which was a clear proof that men
must combine, that the law was of no use, and
ought therefore to be done away. Let me congratulate
you that these severe laws are done
away; that a man cannot now be shut up in
prison for many months together for agreeing
with his companions to withhold their labour in
order to increase its price. Let me congratulate
you that when a man cannot be caught in the

47
trap of the combination laws, he can no longer
be punished under a law against conspiracy,
which was made long before such a thing as
combinations of workmen were thought of. We
can now meet in the face of day, and conduct
our bargains with our masters either by agreement
or opposition, without any one having a
right to interfere, as long as we keep the peace.
Evils there are, indeed, still; and such a thing is
still heard of as persecution in consequence of a
combination; but such evils as are inflicted by
the crushing hand of power light on a few, and
the devotion of those few secures the exemption
of the rest. It is certainly an evil to a peaceably
disposed man to see himself regarded with a
fierce eye by those to whom he no longer dares
touch his hat lest he should be accused of suing
for mercy. It is certainly an evil to a man of independent
mind to be placed under the feet of any
former enemy, to receive his weekly subsistence
from the hands of his equals, and to fancy that
the whisper is going roundââThis is he who lives
upon our gathered pence.ââSuch evils await, as
you know, him who comes forward to lead a
combination; but they belong to the state of
affairs; and since they can neither be helped, nor
be allowed to weigh against the advantages of
union, they should be, not only patiently, but
silently borne. Well is it for the victim if he can
say to himself that now is the time for him to
practise the heroism which in grander scenes has
often made his bosom throb. He may even
esteem himself honoured in his lot being somewhat

48
of the same cast,âthough his own consciousness
alone may perceive the resemblance,âsomething
of the same cast, I say, with that
of venerated statesmen who have returned to the
plough to be forgotten in their own age, and
remembered in another,âwith that of generals
who have held out the decrepit hand with a petition
to the gay passers by to give a halfpenny
to the deliverer of their country.âNay, no cheers
yet! Your cheers only recall me with shame to
that which I was going to say when my personal
feelings led me away,âled me to compare that
which is universally allowed to be moving because
it is noble, with that which, if moving at
all, is so only because it is piteous. As I was
saying, combinations are ordered by laws more
powerful than those which, till lately, forbade
them; and this shows the wisdom of the repeal of
the latter. If it had been wished to prevent our
meeting for caprice or sport, laws might have
availed. If their object had been to hinder the
idle from meeting to dissipate their tediousness,
or the gamesome from pursuing that on which
no more valuable thing was staked than their
present pleasure, these laws might have been
successfully, though somewhat tyrannically, enforced.
But such are not they who form combinations:
but rather such as have their frames
bowed with over-toil, and their brows knit with
care, such as meet because the lives and health
of their families, their personal respectability,
and the bare honesty of not stealing a loaf from
another manâs counter, are the tremendous stake

49
which they feel to be put to hazard. Sound and
wise laws can restrain the fiercest passions of the
few, because, being sound and wise, they are
supported by the many; and it is therefore clear
that when laws give way like cobwebs before
the impulse of a body of men too united to be
brought together by caprice, those laws are
neither wise nor sound. Such were the combination
laws, and therefore were they repealed.
Never again will it be attempted to set up the
prohibition of parliament against the commands
of nature,âa threat of imprisonment against the
cravings of hunger. Security of person and property
being provided for, (as, indeed, they were
already by former laws,) we are left free to make
the best agreement we can for the sale of our
labour, and to arrange our terms by whatever
peaceable methods we choose.

âCombination on our part is necessary from
power being lodged unequally in the hands of
individuals, and it is necessary for labourers to
husband their strength by union, if it is ever to
be balanced against the influence and wealth of
capitalists. A master can do as he pleases with
his hundred or five hundred workmen, unless
they are combined. One word of his mouth,
one stroke of his pen, can send them home on
the Saturday night with a blank prospect of destitution
before them; while these hundred or five
hundred men must make their many wills into
one before his can even be threatened with opposition.
One may tremble, another may mourn,
a third may utter deep down in his heart the

50
curses he dares not proclaim; but all this is of no
avail. The only way is to bring opposition to
bear upon the interests of the master; and this
can only be done by union. The best of the
masters say, and probably with truth, that their
interests demand the reductions under which we
groan. Be it so: we have interests too, and we
must bring them up as an opposing force, and
see which are the strongest. This may be,âallow
me to say, must beâdone without ill-will
in any party towards any other party. There
may be some method yet unknown by which the
interests of all may be reconciled; if so, by union
we must discover it. But if, indeed, interests
must continue to be opposed, if bread must be
fought for, and the discord of men must for ever
be contrasted with the harmony of nature, let the
battle be as fair as circumstances will allow. Let
the host of pigmies try if they cannot win a
chance against the regiment of giants by organizing
their numbers, and knitting them into a
phalanx. The odds against them are fearful, it
is true; but more desperate battles have been
sustained and won. I have not indeed, as the
friend at my elbow reminds me, represented our
case so favourably as I might have done. Many
here think that the power is in our own hands;
some that the chances are equal, and the least
sanguine, that the chance is fair.âI have spoken
of the general necessity of union, and not with
any intention of taking for granted that we are
on the eve of an express struggle. This depends
on circumstances yet to be disclosed. Some

51
change, and that a speedy one, there ought to be
in the condition of the working classes: they
cannot go on long labouring their lives away
for a less recompense than good habitations,
clothing, and food. These form the very least
sum of the just rewards of industry; whereas a
multitude are pinched with the frosts of winter,
live amidst the stench of unwholesome dwellings
in summer, have nearly forgotten the taste of
animal food, and even sigh for bread as for a
luxury. The question to be debated, and to be
put to the trial if necessary,âand I wish every
master in Manchester was here to take down my
words for his further consideration, is whether a
social being has not a right to comfortable subsistence
in return for his full and efficient labour.ââAllenâs
pause was interrupted by a voice from
behind the crowd, declaring,â

âNo doubt, no doubt, my good fellows: a
clear right, and I wish with all my heart you
may win your right.â

It was Rowe, who had entered as if for the
purpose of convincing the men that he was on
their side. An opening was made from the table
to the outskirts of the crowd; but Rowe slunk
back in opposition to all attempts to push him
forward. The fact was, he saw another person
present whom he little expected to meet, and
before whom he was sorry to have committed
himself. Mr. Wentworth advanced through the
opening, with his memorandum book in his
hand:â

âI am willing to put down your question,

52
Allen, for further discussion, provided you add a
clause to it:ââWhether a member of society
has not a right to a comfortable subsistence in
return for full and efficient labour,
provided he
does not, by his own act, put that subsistence
beyond his reach
?ââ

Allen smiled, and all within hearing stared at
Mr. Wentworthâs simplicity in adding this clause
which nobody could dispute.

âWe have certainly nothing to object to your
addition, sir,â said Allen. âOnly I cannot
think it necessary.â

âLet it stand, however, for my satisfaction;
and now go on with what you have to say.â

A seat was offered to Mr. Wentworth, and
proclamation was made of one for Mr. Rowe,
who, however, had disappeared, Allen proceeded:â

âI have only a few words to add respecting
the terms on which I will consent to resume my
present office on any future occasion, or to accept
of any power you may wish to put into my hands.
I must be supported by you in all measures
taken to preserve our own peace and that of the
masters; and to this end, there must be the utmost
strictness in the full performance of all contracts.
Whether the present dispute be amicably settled
this very evening, or whether it be protracted, or
a partial or a general strike should take place,ânone
of these things can set aside a contract previously
entered into. Integrity must be our
rule as much as liberty is our warrant and justice
our end. The first man who deserts the work he

53
has pledged himself to perform, puts the weapon
of the law into the hands of our opponents; the
first who is legally convicted of a breach of contract,
brands our cause with indelible disgrace.
We want no truants here, and we will own none
but honest labourers to be of our company; and
unless I am aided in preserving the reputation
of our cause, I declare,âwhatever may be
thought of the importance of the threat,âthat
from that moment I withdraw my countenance
and my help. If at the period of any strike,
any part of my contract with my employers is
undischarged, I shall hold it to be my duty to
work for them during the stated number of hours,
even if I should repair from their factory to preside
over a meeting like the present; and the
same is expected of every man who enrols himself
in our bands. Honour towards our masters
is as necessary as fidelity to each other.â

The meeting having signified an unanimous
assent to what Allen had said, he proceeded to
draw up a statement of wages to be presented to
the masters. A great number of men pushed
and jostled one another in order to get near the
table and state their grievances; for some under
every firm supposed their wages to be the lowest.
It was found to be as the deputies had stated,
that Mortimer and Rowe paid the lowest wages,
and Elliott the highest.âMortimer and Rowe
were therefore to be requested to answer this
evening, yes or no, whether they would give
Elliottâs rate of wages. Allen, Clack, and

54
Gibson were deputed to wait on the masters with
the written demand.

The meeting broke up for a while, and the
quietest and most industrious of the men went
home, while the rest prepared to parade again
through the streets.

Allen withdrew one of the last, as he wished
to see the place quiet before he left his post. As
he turned from the door of the public-house, his
hands in his pockets and his eyes bent on the
ground in deep thought, he was startled by some
one taking his arm. It was his wife, who had
been watching and lingering in the neighbourhood
till she was tired and frightened.

âWhy, Mary,â said her husband, smiling,
âyou will make me lose my good name. This
is the way wives haunt the public-house when
their husbands are given to drink.â

Mary could trust her husband for soberness if
ever woman could; but she feared his being
drawn in to join against the masters, and bring
ruin on his family.

Allen answered that he was not the man to be

drawn in
to do what his wife knew he disliked
as much as she could do; but he might of his
own free choice determine to do what she feared;
and, in that case, he trusted the discharge of his
public duty would not be embittered by domestic
opposition and discontent. His prospect was
not a very cheering one, however, in this respect.
When fairly seated in his own home, his wife
seemed prodigiously inclined to lock the door

55
and pocket the key; and she cried so piteously
at the bare idea of a strike and its distresses, that
Allen longed to go to sleep, and forget all that
had been done, and all that was in prospect.

Chapter V.

NO PROGRESS MADE.

The mastersâ meeting was a tedious affair to all
parties. The chairman and the three deputies
held such long disputes, as to whether wages
were really much lower than formerly, that the
people who waited in anxious expectation at
the Spread-Eagle, began to wonder whether
the deputies had lain down to take a nap, or
found their business a different kind of affair
from what they had expected. If they had known
what point was in dispute, they would have
wondered what room there was for argument, as
any man among them could have told what he
was paid two years before, and what now. They
all knew that they were now paid by Mortimer
and Rowe, only three and fourpence per one
thousand hanks, while some time before, they had
had upwards of four shillings. How, they
would have asked, could there be any doubt as
to whether wages were lowered?

Clack was profuse in his expressions of astonishment
at the stupidity of those who made

56
a question of so plain a matter; but his wonder
did no more towards settling the point than the
shuffling of the chairman, who did not understand
the true state of the case, and could therefore
render no service in throwing light upon it.

If it had not been for Mr. Wentworth, and
one or two more who held his views, nothing at
all would have been done.

âNobody doubts,â observed Wentworth, âthat
you now take so many shillings less than you
took five years ago; but that matters nothing to
you or to us.â

The chairman and Clack stared in about an
equal degree.

âMy dear sir, that is the very point,â said the
one.

âI always thought you had had a heart to feel
for the poor,â cried the other.

âI beg your pardon,â said the gentleman
quietly, âit is not, sir, the point in dispute, and
I trust, Clack, my observation does not carry
any great cruelty in it. If a penny a week
would enable a man to buy all necessaries for
himself and his family, and if a pound would do
no more, would it signify to any man whether
his wages were a penny or a pound?â

âCertainly not; but who ever heard of such
wonderful pennies?â

âI have heard of shillings which you might
think nearly as wonderful as such pennies:
shillings which would buy more than twice as
much at one time as at another.â

âTo be sure,â said Clack, laughing contemptuously,

57
âevery child knows that the price
of bread and other things rises and falls.â

âVery well. Your concern is about how
much of bread and other things you get in
return for your labour, and not how many shillings.
Shillings are of no value to you but for
what they buy. If half the money in the kingdom
were to be carried off by fairies this night,
so that you could have only half your present
nominal wages, you would be no worse off than
at present. The same quantity of food and
clothing would be in the market, and you would
get as much for sixpence as you now get for a
shilling. This is why I said the nominal amount
of your wages mattered little. I said nothing
about the real amount.â

âBut you do not deny, sir,â said Allen, âthat
our real wages are less than they were?â

âI am afraid it is as true as that our profits
are less. There is less surplus remaining over
our manufacture for us to divide. If this division
were made in kind, instead of your being paid in
money in advance, you would see the real state
of the case,âthat we cannot afford higher
wages.â

âIn kind! Lord, sir,â cried Clack, âwhat
should we do with a bundle of yarns on a Saturday
night? what baker or grocer would take
them?â

âNone, I dare say; and therefore, for the
convenience of the parties, payment for labour is
made in money; but it is not the less true that
your wages consist of the proportion you receive

58
of the return brought by the article you manufacture.
You know how the value of this return
varies; how, when an article is scarce, it brings
in a large return, and how, when it is plentiful,
our customers give less for it; and you must
therefore see how your wages vary independently
of our will.â

âBut whose doing is it, sir, that the return
varies so much?â

âIt is partly your doing; I mean that of those
who bring labour to market. We masters have
nothing to do with the quantity of labour brought
to sale any further than to purchase it. If you
bring so much as to reduce its price too far,
whose fault is that?â

âTo be sure we cannot expect you to pay
high, when you can purchase labour cheap,â
said Allen, âany more than we would give sixpence
for a loaf, if we could get as good a one
for fivepence.â

âIf,â observed one of the masters, âyou
brought only half the present quantity of
labour to us, we must, whether we liked it or
no, pay double for it. If you choose to bring
up large families who will in turn rear large
families to the same occupation, it is a necessary
consequence that wages will fall to the very
lowest point.â

âWhat do you call the lowest point?â

âThat at which the labourer can barely subsist.
If he cannot subsist, he cannot labour, of
course. If he can do more than merely subsist,
his wages are not at the lowest point.â

59
âOurs are so now,â said Gibson, despondingly.

âNot exactly so,â replied the manufacturer.
âDonât fancy that I wish them lower, or
would not make them higher if I could; but I
cannot allow that they are at the lowest. Do
you know no Irish hand-loom weavers who
make only four shillings a week?â

âPoor creatures! yes; but how do they live?
Crowded together on straw, with mere rags to
cover them, and only half as much food as they
could eat. It is dreadful!â

âIt is; and God forbid we should see many
more sinking down into such a state! I only
mentioned their case to show you that your wages
may still fall, if the labourersâ proportion of the
returns to capital is still further divided among
a number. Upon the proportion of your labour
to our capital depends the rise and fall of wages
through the whole scale of payment.â

âWhat would you call the highest rate?â inquired
Allen.

âThe greatest possible proportion of the return
that the capitalist can spare, so as to leave it
worth his while to manufacture; and this highest
rate is, of course, paid only when labour is difficult
to be had.â

âWe cannot wait till that time,â said Clack.
âIf we waited till a war or a fever carried off
part of our numbers, it would do little good; for
there are plenty of young ones growing up. We
must bestir ourselves and see if a strike will not
do as well. The plague would no doubt be more

60
acceptable to gentlemen, as long as it did not
stop their manufacture, like a strike; but the
poor must raise themselves by such means as are
in their own hands, and not wait for a judgment
of Providence.â

âI quite agree with you,â said Mr. Wentworth.
âProvidence would have men guide
themselves by its usual course, and not by uncommon
accidents. But I doubt whether a strike
is one of the means which will gain your point.
It will leave your case worse than in the
beginning, depend upon it. A strike works the
wrong way for your interest. It does not decrease
your numbers, and it does decrease the
capital which is to maintain you.â

Clack would hear nothing against a strike.
Let the masters all give the same wages as Elliott,
or prepare for a strike. Rather to silence the
orator than with hope of much benefit from the
observation, Gibson said that a pernicious multiplication
of hands took place from the big
piecers being allowed to spin. The masters for
the most part liked that they should, because they
soon got to employ them to spin at less wages;
and too many of the men liked it, also, because
it saved them trouble: and some would even sit
down to read, while their piecers were looking
after the wheels; but it seemed to him very hard
that good spinners should be sometimes out of
work, while piecers were practising their business.

The masters thought that any regulation of the
kind Gibson wished for, would only have a slight
effect for a short time; it could not permanently

61
keep down the spinning population to the number
required to ensure sufficient wages.

Clack would not be diverted any longer from
the plain answer to his plain question, would
Messrs. Mortimer and Rowe raise their wages to
Elliottâs rate? Rowe took a long pinch of snuff
to avoid answering. Mortimer sat bolt upright
with his arms folded, and replied, âCertainly
not.â Not a word more could be got out of
him. Others of the masters tried to mediate,
proposing that Elliott and Mortimer should meet
half-way, that is, at Mr. Wentworthâs rate: but
this proposal was rejected by all parties. Elliott
said he left these things to the people under him;
but he believed his clerk was popular with the
operatives and wished for no change any more
than himself; so that he should not reduce.
Mortimer would not be dictated to by a mob;
and the representatives of this âmobâ declared
their intention of calling Wentworth to account,
when they had done with Mortimer, and that his
rate must not therefore be proposed for adoption.
And thus the matter was no nearer being settled
than before.

âPray is it true,â inquired Mortimer, âthat
you have talked of rooting me out?â

âSuch a thing has been mentioned in private,
sir,â replied Allen, âbut immediately scouted.
It was never proposed at any public meeting,
and will not be mentioned again I dare say.â

âSo! you have more prudence than I gave
you credit for. I almost wish you had made the
trial, that you might end by learning your own

62
place. You would soon have known what
comes of dictating to us.â

This was a signal for Clack to renew his
oratory. The peace-makers on both sides found
it was time to separate, as there seemed no
chance of coming to any agreement. The three
men made their bow and withdrew,âAllen with
a heavy heart, leaving the masters to agree that
the affair must be gone through with firmness
and temper; that is, some were for firmness, and
some for temper. Mortimer was annoyed at
being exposed to annoyance from people so much
beneath him; and Wentworth and others thought
that the shortest way to a good issue was to regard
the claims of the people with respect, their
mistakes with gentleness, and their distresses with
compassion.

Before Allen could speak a word in reply to
the inquiries of his eager companions, Clack
began in a strain of indignation to pronounce
him a trimmer, for having answered Mortimer as
he did about the proposal to root him out. The
men being disposed at the moment to listen to
everything that regarded the punishment of
Mortimer, were hard upon Allen, though not so
abusive as Clack. Allen kept his temper, stood
the brunt of that to which his rectitude of principle
exposed him, stayed till the business of the
evening was finished, and then pondered, on his
way home, the hard chance by which he was exposed
to the displeasure of the masters, the unreasonableness
of his comrades, and the timid
complaints of his wife. Allen was not made
for ambition.

63
Before the operatives separated, it was agreed
that all employed at a lower rate of wages than
Elliottâs should turn out the next morning,
except the children, whose maintenance would
cost so much that it was desirable they should
earn as long as allowed to do so. Meetings
were to be held from day to day, first to appoint
a fresh committee, and afterwards to take measures
for securing assistance from fellow-labourers
at a distance.

Bray, who had taken care that the meeting
should not want for harmony of one kind at
least during its sitting, betook himself at its close
to the York Hotel, just when the masters were
dispersing, and with some degree of impudence
stated his desire to be impartial, and his readiness
to drum the gentlemen home, if they would
please to marshal themselves, as he had played
in front of the men in the morning. Elliott
called for a waiter to turn the fellow away, and
Wentworth observed that he feared his travels
had not improved the quality of his wit.

Chapter VI.

NIGHT AND MORNING.

âHow is Martha?â was Allenâs first inquiry on
meeting his wife at the head of the stairs.
Martha had been asleep when he had returned in

64
the middle of the day; for it was now her turn
for night-work at the factory, and what rest she
had must be taken in the day. Her mother said
that her lameness was much the same; that she
had seen Mr. Dawson, the apothecary, who pronounced
that rest was what her weak limbs most
required; and that as perfect rest was out of the
question, her mother must bandage the joints
while the child was at her work, and keep her
laid on her bed at home. Here was the difficulty,
her mother said, especially while Hannah was
with her, for they were both fond of play when
poor Martha was not too tired to stir. She was
now gone to her work for the night.

The little girl repaired to the factory, sighing
at the thought of the long hours that must pass
before she could sit down or breathe the fresh air
again. She had been as willing a child at her
work as could be till lately: but since she had
grown sickly, a sense of hardship had come
over her, and she was seldom happy. She was
very industrious, and disposed to be silent at her
occupation; so that she was liked by her employers,
and had nothing more to complain of
than the necessary fatigue and disagreeableness
of the work. She would not have minded it for
a few hours of the day; but to be shut up all
day, or else all night, without any time to nurse
the baby or play with her companions, was too
much for a little girl of eight years old. She
had never been so sensible of this as since her
renewed acquaintance with Hannah. This
night, when the dust from the cotton made

65
her cough, when the smell and the heat brought
on sickness and faintness, and the incessant
whizzing and whirling of the wheels gave her
the feeling of being in a dream, she remembered
that a part of Hannahâs business was to walk on
broad roads or through green fields by her
fatherâs side, listening to the stories he amused
her with, and to sit on a stile or under a tree to
practice a new tune, or get a better dinner than
poor Martha often saw. She forgot that
Hannah was sometimes wet through, or scorched
by the sun, as her complexion, brown as a
gipsyâs, showed; and that Hannah had no home
and no mother, and very hard and unpleasant
work to do at fairs, and on particular occasions.
About midnight, when Martha remembered that
all at home were probably sound asleep, she could
not resist the temptation of resting her aching
limbs, and sat down, trusting to make up afterwards
for lost time, and taking care to be on her
feet when the overlooker passed, or when any
one else was likely to watch her. It is a dangerous
thing, however, to take rest with the
intention of rousing oneself from time to time;
and so Martha found. She fairly fell asleep
after a time, and dreamed that she was attending
very diligently to her work; and so many things
besides passed through her mind during the two
minutes that she slept, that when the overlooker
laid his hand upon her shoulder, she started and
was afraid she was going to be scolded for a long
fit of idleness. But she was not harshly
spoken to.

66
âCome, come, child; how long have you
been asleep?â

âI donât know. I thought I was awake all
the time.â And Martha began to cry.

âWell, donât cry. I was past just now, and
you were busy enough; but donât sit down;
better not, for fear you should drop asleep again.â

Martha thought she had escaped very well;
and winking and rubbing her eyes, she began to
limp forward and use her trembling hands.
The overlooker watched her for a few moments,
and told her she was so industrious in general
that he should be sorry to be hard upon her; but
she knew that if she was seen flagging over her
work, the idle ones would make it an excuse to
do so too. Martha curtsied, and put new vigour
into her work at this praise. Before he went on
in his rounds, the overlooker pointed to the
window and told her morning was come.

It was a strange scene that the dawn shone
upon. As the grey light from the east mingled with
the flickering, yellow glare of the lamps, it gave a
mottled dirty appearance to everything; to the
pale-faced children, to the unshaved overlooker,
to the loaded atmosphere, and even to the produce

of the
of the
wheels.

When a bright sunbeam shone in through the
window, thickened with the condensed breath of
the work-people, and showed the oily steam rising
through the heated room, the lamps were extinguished,
to the great relief of those who found
the place growing too like an oven to be much
longer tolerable. The sunbeams rested now on

67
the ceiling, and Martha knew that they must
travel down to the floor and be turned full on her
frame and some way past it, before she could be
released; but still it was a comfort that morning
was come.

She observed that the overlooker frequently
went out and came back again, and that there
was a great deal of consultation among her
betters as the hours drew on. A breath of fresh
air came in now and then from below, and news
went round that the gates were already open, two
hours earlier than usual. Presently the tramp of
heavy feet was heard, like that of the weavers
and spinners coming to their daily work. Martha
looked up eagerly to the clock, supposing that
the time had passed quicker than she had been
aware of; but it was only four oâclock. What
could bring the people to their work so early?
They could scarcely have mistaken the hour
from the brightness of the morning, for it had
now clouded over, and was raining a soaking
shower. More news went round. Those who
had arrived had barely escaped being waylaid
and punished for coming to work after a strike
had been proclaimed. They had been pursued
to the gates and very nearly caught, and must
now stay where they were till nightfall, as they
could not safely appear in broad daylight, going
to and returning from their dinners. Many
wondered that they had ventured at all, and all

prophesied
prophesied
that they must give up to the will of
the Union if they wished to be safe. The overlooker,
finding much excitement prevailing on the

68
circulation of the news, commanded silence, observing
that it was no concern of any of the
children present. There was no strike of the
children, and they would be permitted to go and
come without hinderance. Martha determined to
get away the first moment she could, and to
meet her father, if possible, that he might not
encounter any troublesome people for her sake.

Allen was watching the moment of release as
anxiously for his little daughter as she could
have done for herself, and he was to the full as
weary as she. On the previous evening he had
carried home paper and pens, preferring to write
the necessary letters at his own dwelling to
spending the night at the Spread-Eagle. He
got his wife to clear and wipe down the deal table,
when she had put all the children to bed; and
then he sat down to compose a pattern letter,
stating the circumstances which had led to a
strike, and urging an appeal to their fellow-workmen
in distant places for aid in the struggle
which might be deemed a peculiarly important
one. Having tolerably well satisfied himself
that the letter was the proper thing, he read it to
his admiring wife, who by turns smiled because
she was proud of her husband, and sighed to
think how perilous an office he had undertaken.
She then went to bed and was soothed to sleep
by the scratching of his nicely-mended pen.
From this time all was silence in the apartment,
except the occasional crackle when Allen folded
his paper, or the cautious taking up and laying
down of the snuffers when the long candle-wick

69
craved snuffing, or the passing squalls of the
baby, who, however, allowed himself to be so
quickly hushed as not materially to disturb the
scribe.

When nearly twenty copies of his letter had
been written, each varying a little from the original,
according to the differing circumstances of
those to whom it was addressed, Allen was so
weary that he could write no longer without some
refreshment. He put out his light, and opened
the window for a minute to breathe the fresh air.
The pattering of the rain wakened his wife, who
roused herself to fret over the weather and
wonder how Martha was to get home. Her
husband told her he meant to go for the child,
and would carry a shawl to wrap her up in. If
Mary had known what lions were in her husbandâs
path, she would not have let him go.

There was but one man visible when Allen
went forth, and he was walking rapidly at some
distance. It was Hare,âwho, having never been
well disposed towards a turn-out, and being supported
in his dislike of it by his wife, hoped to
avoid mischief and continue his earnings by
going to the factory before people should be
looking for him, and doing his work as usual,
without talking about wages to anybody. Such
devices did not suit the purposes of the Union,
and were guarded against, as in all similar cases.
Hare thought it just possible that he might meet
with opposition, and looked as far before him as
his eyes could reach; but he did not suspect an
ambush on either hand. When he continued in

70
the same direction, however, so as to render it
certain that he was making for the factory, six
men issued, one by one, from opposite alleys, and
formed a line across the street. Hareâs name
was shouted to some one still concealed, coupled
with a question whether he was under contract.

Having received their answer, they coolly told
their trembling fellow-workman that as he had
not the pretence of any contract, and was nevertheless
going to work at an unfair price, he must
be ducked. They had a rope ready, and would
deliver him up to be dragged through the river.

Hare turned from one to another with as
large a variety of excuses as he could invent at
the moment. Among the rest, he vowed that he
came to watch who would be wicked enough to
go to work at this same factory after having
sworn to strike. He was laughed at, let off
with a roll in the kennel and with being hunted
part of the way home, whither he ran to seek
refuge with his wife in panting terror, and presenting
a woeful spectacle of disgrace. He
perhaps owed it to his known cowardice that he
fared no worse; as his companions were well
assured he was sufficiently daunted not to attempt
to cheat them a second time.

Allen proceeded at his best pace while this
judgment was being inflicted on Hare, never
supposing that he could be suspected of taking
work unfairly; but, like all eminent men, he had
his enemies, and these chose to take for granted
that he could not be going to the factory with
any honest design. He was seized, girded with

71
the dreadful rope, and hauled towards the river,
though he produced the shawl, demanded time
to call witnesses, and used all the eloquence he
could command. His last resource was to
explain that the supplies from a distance must
be delayed if any harm happened to him. This
occasioned a short pause, during which the night-children
came forth from the factory. One of
the ambush, who had some sense of justice, and
wished to find out the truth about Allen, ran up
to Martha, as soon as she appeared, and before
she could know what had happened, and asked
her whether her father was not late in coming to
work this morning?

âHe is not coming to work at all,â said the
child; âbut he said he would come for me.
Perhaps the rain made him stay at home.â

This testimony released Allen, and disappointed
some of the lads who stood round of a
frolic, which they had desired to fill up the time
till they could proceed to a frolic of a different
kind. They looked up at the clouds, and hoped
the rain would not make the parson cheat them.
They were going to be married. Several had
begun to think of this some time before (as lads
and lasses that work together in factories are
wont to do); and this seemed the very time,
when they had a holiday they did not know what
to do with, and were sure, they believed, of ten
shillings a week as long as the turn-out should
last. So, amid the warning looks of elderly
friends, and the remonstrances of parents who
justly thought this the worst possible time to

72
take new burdens upon them, several thoughtless
young couples went laughing through the rain
to the altar, and snapped their fingers at the
clergyman behind his back because his careful
enquiries brought to light no cause why the solemnization
of matrimony should not proceed.

Chapter VII.

A COMMITTEE.

This was an eventful day. The masters published
a placard, (not, however, signed by all,)
threatening to turn off every man in their employ
who should continue, after a certain day, to
belong to the Union. The effect was exactly
what the wisest of them expected; the turn-out
became general; and the workmen, being exasperated,
put new vigour into all their proceedings.
Their Committee was enlarged and instructed to
sit daily. Delegates were despatched on tours
to distant places, with authority to tell the tale,
and collect supplies; and the people at home
consented to receive, for their weekly maintenance,
no more than half what the young bride-grooms
had settled as the probable allowance.
Five shillings a week was to be allowed as long
as the children remained at work; and in case of
their employment failing, the sum was to be increased

73
in proportion to the capability of the
fund. Weekly meetings were ordered to be held
in St. Georgeâs Fields, at which any one should
be welcome to attend; and it was agreed that it
would be worth while going to some expense to
have the proceedings of the body made public
through the newspapers.

Allen was strongly in favour of having only
three members of the Committee sit daily for the
dispatch of common business; viz., the treasurer,
secretary, and one of the other members,
in rotation, for the sake of a casting vote. He
knew enough of such Committees to believe that
ill-natured tittle-tattle was particularly apt to find
its way into them, and that quarrels between
masters and men were often kept up by these
means long after they would naturally have died
out; and that a weekly sitting, at which the
three members should be accountable for all they
had done, would be sufficient for the interests of
the association. The proposal gave offence,
however; some supposing that he wanted to
keep the power in few hands, others being unwilling
to enjoy the pomp and privilege of their
office no oftener than once or twice a week,
and some honestly thinking that the voices of all
were wanted for the decision of questions daily
arising. Allen would have cared little for his
motion being rejected; but, in spite of all the
allowance he strove to make, it vexed him to the
heart to hear evil motives assigned for every
proposition which did not please the people. He
often said to himself that it must be a very different

74
thing to sit in a committee of gentlemen
where opinions are treated as opinions, (
i.e.
, as
having no moral qualities, and to be accepted or
rejected according to their expediency,) and in a
committee of persons who expose their deficiencies
of education by calling all unkind or foolish who
differ from themselves. Such remarks appeared
to Allen to proceed from the same spirit which
tortured martyrs in former days, and proscribed
the leaders of a combination in the present.

Any one committee-meeting afforded a pretty
fair specimen of all. Sometimes there were
more letters than at others, sometimes larger,
sometimes smaller remittances than had been
expected, and occasionally none at all. Sometimes
there was a dearth of gossip about the
sayings and doings of the masters, and then
again an abundance of news of spiteful devices
and wilful misrepresentations and scornful sayings
for which there should be a sure retribution.
But the same features distinguished all;
and one sketch will therefore describe the whole.

A little before ten, the committee-men might
be seen tending towards St. Georgeâs road. They
could win their way but slowly, for they were
continually waylaid by one or another who had
some very important suggestion to make, or
question to answer; or a piece of news to tell
which would sound well in committee. Allen
was the most sore beset.

âLord! Allen, what work yours must be with
such a many letters to write! Why, it must
cost a mint of money to pay postage.â

75
âAll for the cause, you know. Let me go,
will you? I am rather late.â

âNot a clock has struck yet, man, and I want to
know whether itâs true about the large order thatâs
gone to Glasgow because Elliott canât execute it?â

âAll true, perfectly true. Good bye.â

âWell, but have you seen Elliott since?
Lord! I should love to see him look chap-fallen
when he finds the power is with us.â

ââTis for us to look chap-fallen, I think,â
said Allen, trying to disengage his button;
âwhereâs the power if more such orders go
the same way?â

âStop, Allen, one thing more. Do you know,
several of us are of a mind that it is a disgrace
to the Union that Wooller, with his large family,
has no more on a pay-day than Briggs.â

âBriggs has a sick wife, and his children are
too young to work.â

âWooller must have more, however, and
that youâll find to your cost, if you donât take
care. Pretty encouragement to turn out, indeed,
if such a man as he is to be sacrificed to
worse men than himself!â

âLet him carry his complaint to the proper
place, if he is discontented. The committee
ordered his allowance, and it is they must alter
it, not I.â

Allen now thought he had made his escape;
but his gossip called after him that he had something
to tell him on which the whole fate of the
strike depended. Allen was all ear in a moment.
It was said, and on very good authority, that the

76
masters would never employ a Manchester man
again. They had sent to Glasgow and to Belfast,
and all over England, and if they could not
get workmen enough by these means, they would
bring them in troops from abroad.

âWho told you this?â said Allen, laughing.

âThatâs between him and me,â replied the
gossip mysteriously; âbut you may rely upon
it, it is true.â

âAye, we have been told so twice a day since
we turned out,â said Allen; âbut that is no reason
why we should believe it. You might as well
tell me they mean to take their mills on their
backs and march over the sea to America.â

âYou may laugh, sir, but Iâm far from as
sure as you that we are not going to ruin.â

âI am sure of no such thing,â replied Allen.
âI wish I were; but if we are ruined, it will not
be by French people spinning in Chorlton Row.â

A knot of smokers, each with as much to
say, stood or lolled about the door of the Spread-Eagle.
Allen looked at the window of the committee-room,
and wished he could have got in
that way; but there was no escape from the file
of questioners. Several of his companions were
ready to tell him that he was late, when he at
length took his seat at the end of the table, and
began to arrange his papers.

âI know it; but I left home half an hour
since. I have been stopped by the way.â

âAnd so you always will be. Youâre so soft,
man, youâre not fit for office if you canât say
âno.ââ

77
Dooley, the representative of the Irish hand-loom
weavers, here took up Allenâs defence,
urging that it would be too hard if the people out
of office might not make their remarks to those
who were in; and that a secretary must be as
stony-hearted as the last speaker to refuse them
a hearing.

âCome, come; to business,â cried Allen, to
stop the dispute. âBut first shut the door,
Brown, and make every one knock that wants to
come in. If they wonât obey at once, slip the
bolt. We must preserve the dignity and quiet of
the Committee.â

âO, by all manner of means,â said the Irishman,
sitting down demurely at the board, and
twirling his thumbs; âit puts me in mind of the
way his honour set us to play when we were
childrenâââ

âI have here a letter from number three,â
Allen began, as if all had been silence, âwho
has prosecuted his journey successfully as far as
Halifax, from whence he hopes to transmit, in a
post or two, a sum nearly as large as was contributed
by that place to the Bradford strike. It
will gratify you, I am sure, to know with how
much friendly anxiety our fellow-labourers watch
the result of our present noble struggle; and I
trust you will agree with me that their suggestions
are entitled to our respectful attention.
Dooley, be so good as read the letter to the
Committee, while I look what must be brought
forward next.â

âWith raal pleasure, Mr. Secretary; but first

78
Iâll take lave to wet my throat with a little ale
or spirits. Itâs dry work reading and advising,
and a clear sin to keep so many men shut up on
a summerâs day with not a drop to help their
wits.â

âWhatever is ordered is at your own cost,
remember,â said Allen; âand I would recommend
your going elsewhere to refresh yourself.
Meanwhile, will some one else have the goodness
to read the letter now under consideration?â

After much complaint and discussion, Dooley
was prevailed on to be quiet and let the business
go forward. Having first loaded Allen with abuse
and then with praise, he tried to behave well,
much in the same way as if his priest had put
him under penance.

The letter in question and some others having
been discussed and dismissed with due decorum,
a member brought before the notice of his fellow-workmen
a calumny which he believed had been
widely circulated, and which was likely to impair
the credit of the association, and thus to deprive
them of the countenance of their distant friends
and of all chance of reconciliation with the
masters. It was said and believedââ

A push at the door. âWho is there?â

âOnly Tom Hammond.â

âLearn what he wants.â

Tom Hammond only thought he would look
in and see whether it was a full committee-day,
and how they got on: which thought only occasioned
the door to be shut in his face, and the
delivery of an admonition to go about his own

79
business and leave other people to manage theirs
in quiet.

âWell; what was this libel?â

It was said that the Committee had taken
upon themselves to go round as inspectors, and
to examine the work done by all members of the
Union, and determine whether the price given
for it was fair or not. Allen thought it incredible
that any of the masters could have given heed to
so absurd a report; but if one instance could be
brought of its having been actually believed, he
would be the first to propose some measure of
effectual contradiction.

Clack would wish that the secretary was somewhat
less inclined to make light of the information
brought to the committee by some who
were as likely to know what was going forward
as himself. The association was not to lose its
character because its secretary chose to laugh at
the foul calumnies circulated against it, and
which seemed anything but laughable to those
who had the honour of the Union really at
heart. And so forth.

The secretary begged to explain that nothing
was further from his intention than to risk the
good name of the association; and he must
further assert that no man breathing had its
honour more at heart than himself. He need
but appeal to those who had heard him say but
just nowââ And so forth.

The result was a resolution that a paper should
be drawn up and presented to the masters, containing
an explanation of what the office of this

80
committee consisted in;
viz.
:ânot in determining
the value of work and the rate of wages,
but in managing the affairs of the turn-out after
the strike had been actually made; in collecting
and distributing money, and conducting the correspondence
and accounts.

While Allen was consulting his companions
about the wording of this letter, the rub-a-dub of
a drum, accompanying shrill piping, was heard
approaching from a distance, and presently the
sounds of merriment from without told that
Bray was among the smokers on the outside.
Sometimes a rumble and screech seemed to show
that the unskilful were trying his instruments,
and then it appeared from the heavy tread and
shuffling of feet that some were dancing horn-pipes
under his instructions. Dooley soon started
up.

âLet us have Bray in here. Heâll put a
little life in us, for all this is as dull as sitting at
a loom all day. We make it a point of honour,
you know, not to trample on a fallen man. We
let Bray come and go as if he was still one of
us, poor cratur.â

âWait till he comes,â said Allen. âHe is
thinking no more of us at this moment than we
need think of him.â

Dooley returned to his seat with the mock
face of a chidden child, and walking as softly as
if he trod on eggs, twirling his thumbs as before.
He had not long to wait for his diversion. Bray
suddenly made a lodgment in the window, sitting
astride on the sill with his drum balanced

81
before him and playing with all his might, so as
almost to deafen those within. When he saw
the vexed countenances of two or three of the
men of business, he ceased, dropped into the
room, rolled his drum into a corner, flung his
belled cap behind it, and said,â

âDonât scold me, pray. Iâll make it all up to
you. Iâll have bars put up at the windows at
my own cost to prevent any more idle fellows
dropping in upon you when you have made all
safe at the door. Moreover, I will give you the
benefit of my best wisdom at this present time.
Whatâs the matter in hand?â

The Committee found their advantage in the
consideration which made them admit Bray to
their councils, though he had no longer any connexion
with their affairs. His natural shrewdness
and travelled wisdom were valuable helps upon
occasion. When the terms of the disclaimer
were agreed upon, Bray told them he had something
of importance to say, and he should say it
out as plainly as he had heard it, since he hoped
they were all men, all possessed of resolution
enough to bear what might be said of them, and
to surrender their own gratification for the
public good.

Clack was the first to give a vehement assent.
With his hand on his heart, he protested that he
would take his heart in his hand and give it to be
toasted at the hangmanâs fire, if it would do the
cause any good. All with different degrees of
warmth declared their readiness to sacrifice or
to be sacrificed. Allenâs assent was given the

82
last and the least confidently, though without
hesitation. He had inwardly flinched on first
hearing Brayâs portentous words, but the recollection
that he had already devoted himself, restored
his firmness and prepared him for whatever
might be coming. He would have flinched no
more, even had Brayâs story concerned himself
instead of another.

âI have been a pretty long round this morning,â
said Bray, âand among other places to Middleton,
and there some good fellows and I had a
pot of ale. Who should come in there but a traveller
who deals, I am told, with several firms in
this place. Well; he heard us talking about the
strike, and not liking, seemingly, to overhear
without speaking, like a spy, he joined in with
us, and talked like a very sensible man,âmore
so than I should have expected, considering how
much he has clearly been with the masters.â

âYou never miss a stroke at your old enemies,
Bray.â

âAs long as they are enemies to me and such
as me, I shall give them a hit at every turn.
Well; this gentleman told us that he could
speak to the dispositions of the masters, if any
one could; and he was positive that if the men
would take one step, they would soon have overtures
from the masters. âIf,â said he, âthey
will prevent Clack from having anything to do
with their strike, the masters will begin to come
round from that moment.ââ

âTurn
me
out!â exclaimed Clack. âPrevent

my
having anything to doâââ

83
Bray pursued as if Clack were a hundred miles
off. ââThey think that fellow,â says he, âa
vulgar speechifier that knows nothing about the
matter in dispute, and is only fit to delude the
more ignorant among the spinners and to libel
the masters. Send him back into the crowd
where his proper place is, and then you will see
what the masters have to say to the Committee.ââ

Allen endeavoured to stop remarks which it
must be painful enough to Clack to hear under
any form, and which were made needlessly offensive
by Bray, who was rather glad of the opportunity
of giving a set down to the mischief-maker.
Clack was necessarily soon stopped also
by general consent. He raged and vowed revenge
in such a style that it was plainly right to dismiss
him now if it had not been so before. He could
no longer be trusted with any degree of power
against the masters, if the Committee wished to
preserve their character for impartiality. As
soon as he could be persuaded to leave the room
to have his case considered, it was agreed to
recommend him to resign, if he wished to avoid
being regularly deposed at the next public
meeting. He preferred the appeal to the public;
and his companions could only hope that the
masters would hear of what had passed, and
would take the will for the deed.

It was next proposed by a member of the
Committee that a sum of money should be presented
to Allen in consideration of his services;
and he had the pain of hearing himself lauded at

84
the expense of Clack, according to what seemed
the general rule, to admire one man in proportion
to the contempt with which another was treated.
If Rowe was railed at, Wentworth was praised;
if Clack was complained of, Allen was immediately
extolled. Being aware of this, Allen
would have declined the gift, if for no other
reason than that a fit of generosity might be
transient; but he had other reasons for refusing
to listen to all mention of a gift. He chose to
keep his disinterestedness beyond all question;
and he feared that the funds were about to
decline on the whole, though liberal contributions
were looked for from particular places.

To stop further argument, which he intended
should be unavailing, he returned brief thanks to
his companions and broke up the Committee.

Chapter VIII.

A TETE-A-TETE.

It was the policy of the Committee to hold the
public meetings of the workmen on pay-days, in
order that they might appear on the green refreshed
and in good spirits, and thus give the
masters the most favourable impression possible
of their resources and of the vigour with which
they meant to maintain the strike. This arrangement
had not the effect of raising the

85
spirits of the leaders. Pay-day was an anxious and
painful day to them. In addition to all the sad
stories of distress which they must hear, and the
discontent which they must witness, there was a
perpetual dread of the fund appearing to decline,
and of the confidence of the people being therefore
shaken. It was frequently necessary to
borrow money,âsometimes as much as a hundred
pounds at a time,âon the security of what was
to come in during the next week; and even those
least disposed to foresight could not help asking
themselves and each other what was to be done
next time, if the remittances of the week should
not superabound.

Allen was turning these things over in his
mind as he proceeded to the Spread-Eagle on
the morning of the day when Clack was expected
to be dismissed from the Committee by the
public voice. News was afloat which did not
tend to cheer his spirits, though he thought he
discerned in it a sign that the measures already
taken concerning Clack were prudent. Ann
Howlett, Clackâs betrothed, had been taken up
on a charge of breach of contract, and had been
committed to prison by the magistrate. This
woman having been singled out as an example
seemed to indicate enmity against Clack; and if
it was indeed necessary to propitiate the masters
by sacrificing him, it was well that the sacrifice
was offered by the Committee before the arrest
of the woman instead of in consequence of it. A
more painful piece of intelligence followed. Immediately
after this arrest, a carrier, who was

86
conveying work into the country for Mortimer
and Rowe, was attacked on his way out of the
town, his cart ransacked, himself beaten, and the
work carried off in triumph. Ten or twelve men
had been concerned in the outrage; and it was
acknowledged that they belonged to the Union;
but Allen in vain attempted to learn who they
were. His integrity was so well known, that it
was understood that he would deliver the offenders
up to justice, be they who they might; and
therefore, though many knew, no one would tell.
Mute signs and obscure hints conveyed that
Clack headed the enterprise; but nothing in the
shape of evidence was offered.

Mr. Rowe was standing at his window when
Allenâs gossips left him to pursue his way. The
gentleman threw up the sash, looked cautiously
up and down the street, to ascertain whether he
was observed, and then mysteriously beckoned
to Allen to come into the house.

âWhat do you want with me, sir?â

âI want a little conversation with you, thatâs
all. Canât you come in for a quarter of an
hour?â

âIf I could find any one to take my place at
the board,â replied Allen, who thought that some
overture might be coming. âIf you will let me
step to the Spread-Eagle or write a note, I am
at your service.â

The plan of writing a note was preferred, on
condition that Allen should not say whence or
why he wrote. He saw that the gentleman
glanced over his shoulder, to see whether he kept

87
his word, and turning sharp round, held up the
paper in Roweâs face, saying,

âThere is honour on the part of us men, I
assure you, sir, whatever suspicion there is on the
part of you gentlemen. Read the note, if you
please.â

Rowe did as he was desired, disclaiming suspicion,
of course, and getting entangled in a
complimentary speech which Allen listened to
very quietly, waiting, with his arms by his side,
for the end of it.

As an ending did not come readily, however,
the gentleman broke off in order to send the
note. He gave a penny to a child in the street
to carry the note to the Spread-Eagle, and run
away directly without saying where he came
from; and then returning, made Allen sit down
and take a glass of ale,âparticularly fine ale,âsuch
capital ale that the gentleman often indulged
himself in a draught with a friend.

When nothing more remained to be said
about ale, Mr. Rowe sighed, and observed what
a pity it was that people should fall out to their
mutual injury, and that those who had power to
reconcile differences should not endeavour to do
so.

Allen asked what party was meant by this
description.

âYou,â replied Rowe, shaking him warmly
by the hand. âYou must know, Allen, that
you can do what you please in the Union; and
I only wish you knew how the masters look up
to you, and respect your manly, moderate conduct.

88
Any proposition from you would meet
with attention from both parties; if you wouldâââ

âI beg pardon, sir; but you forget that
my propositions are before the masters already,
and do not meet with attention. My propositions
are those adopted by the Unionâââ

âYes, yes; I know well enough what they
are; but you must bring forward something
new. Is there nothing else you can propose
that we can support without going from our
word?â

âJust tell me plainly,â said Allen, âsince
you seem to like plain speaking: will you yourself
make a concession about raising the wages to a
middle point, if we yield some of our demands of
equal importance?â

âWhy, you see,â replied Rowe, edging his
chair closer, and filling Allenâs glass, âI donât
want to come forward the first in this kind of
thing. Indeed, as a junior partner, I ought not
so to commit myself. I canât be the first, you
see; but I have no objection to be the second.
Yes, you may, between you and me, depend upon
my being the second.â

âBetween you and me!â exclaimed Allen,
laughing. âThat leaves me nothing to propose
to the meeting. See now how they would laugh
at me!ââMy fellow-workmen, I propose that
we should lower our demands because a person
(I am not at liberty to say who) offers, between
himself and me, to yield in part after others have
yielded.â Why, sir, they would jeer me off the

89
stand, or bid me say to their concealed opponent,
âThank you for nothing. If others have yielded
first, we shall owe nothing to you.ââ

âWell but, Allen, you donât seem to me to
know the difficulty I am in, if you use my name.
You donât know how unpleasantâââ

âPardon me, sir, I do know. You and I
are neither of us men of nerve, Mr. Rowe, and
so far, you have chosen your listener well.
Clack would have laughed in your face, by this
time, and been half way to the Spread-Eagle to
tell the people there all that you have been
saying; but I have so far a sympathy with you
that I know the misery of looking round and
seeing entanglement with one party or another
on every sideâblame from one or another sure
to come. I know the longing to be somehow
out of the scrape, the shrinking back with the
hope of keeping out of sight, the dread of every
one that comes near lest some new difficulty
should be arising. I can pity you, sir, for all
these feelings, for I have felt them myself.â

âHave you? have you indeed?â replied
Rowe, grasping his hand again. âWhat a sad
thing it is for you, then, to be a leader of a turn-out.â

âI am of a different opinion, sir. Because
these feelings are natural to some persons, it
does not follow that they should be indulged.
It will not do to indulge them, sir, believe me.
We have our duties as well as men of our make
on the field of battle; and we must surrender
ourselves, like them, to our duties, or be disgraced

90
in our own eyes. Happen what will
within us or without us, it is for you and me to
speak out, to act openly, and bear the consequences.
You will excuse my freedom.â

Another grasp of the hand, with a speech
about the secretaryâs integrity; upon which
Allen rose, saying,â

âThen as we are of one mind, sir, suppose
we go together to the meeting, and say what we
have to say there, instead of shut up in this parlour.
I believe I can promise you a courteous
hearing.â

âO no, no; that is quite out of the question.
I have no offer, you know, to make on behalf of
the masters,ânothing to say that I should think
of occupying the meeting with.â

âThen you can have nothing to say to me,
sir, since, as an individual, I have no power to
negotiate. Good morning, Mr. Rowe.â

âStay a moment, Allen. You understand
that the men are not to know of this interview;
and it is of more importance still that the masters
should not. Promise me, Allen.â

âI can promise no such thing,â said Allen,
returning from the door. âI regard your consent
to be the second to raise wages as a concession,
and I was going to report it to Mr.
Wentworth.â

âFor Godâs sake donât!â

âI must,â said Allen, firmly; and all entreaty,
all reproach, was in vain.

âAt least, donât give up the name. The fact
will do just as well without the name. Give me

91
your word to conceal the name till you see me
again.â

Out of pure compassion, Allen yielded thus
far. Mr. Rowe accompanied him to the house-door,
harping upon âthe name, the name,â till
Allen turned round to say gravely,

âA promise once given is enough, sir, between
honest men. I have given you my word.â

âTrue, true, my good friend. It is only a
trick I have got of repeating my sentences.â

And the gentleman shut the door behind his
guest, feeling very like a child who has persuaded
her maid not to tell her governess who broke
the china cup; knowing all the time that the
mishap must come to light, and trembling every
time any one goes near the cupboard.

Chapter IX.

A PUBLIC MEETING.

âHow much did you fall short to-day?â inquired
Allen, as he joined in with a group of
committee-men going to the meeting.

âSixty pounds; but we shall make it up
before three days are over, depend upon it; and,
besides, the masters will yield as soon as Clack
is done for, youâll see. Wentworth is before us,
going to the meeting. But what have you been
about, Allen, playing truant on pay-day?â

âPreaching fortitude and giving a fillip to the
faint-hearted.â

92
âAs Christian a duty as feeding the hungry
and easing the poor,â observed a companion.
âIf Allen is absent from a good deed, you may
be sure he is doing a better.â

There was no part of Allenâs duty that he disliked
more than opening the weekly meetings.
The applause discomposed him. He could not,
like Clack, make a deprecating flourish of the
hands, or shake his head modestly, or look round
with a proud smile. He was very apt to fidget,
and swing his hat, and make a short, ungraceful
bow. As soon as he found this out, he adopted
one posture, from which he determined not to
move till the thing was over. He folded his
arms and dropped his head upon his breast, and
so stood as if facing a gust of wind, till the clapping
had sunk into silence.âThis day, the clapping
on his appearance was twice as long and
twice as vehement as usual, Clackâs former popularity
being transferred to himself. Mr. Wentworth
appeared in time to share his honours, and
to relieve him from applause, which seemed as
if it would never end. Clack would fain have
appropriated both series of cheers; but he could
not manage it. As soon as he began to bow
and look flattered, there arose cries of âOff,
off!â which strengthened into groans when he
attempted to brave them. With a nervous sneer,
the orator observed to those within hearing that
his time would soon come, when he would carry
off more cheers than any of them.

âBetter put yourself under Allenâs wing, if
you want to be clapped,â observed Mr. Wentworth.

93
âI conclude it was because I stood next
to him that they cheered me to-day, instead of
groaning, as they did a week ago. We must
submit to be beholden to Allenâhey, Clack?â

With a look of ineffable contempt, the orator
withdrew as far as he could from Allen, without
going out of sight, while Mr. Wentworth sat
down to take a pinch of snuff on the edge of the
waggon in which the speakers were stationed.

The object of the meeting was to obtain the
opinions of the people on certain questions to be
proposed; and, in order to put Clack out of the
pain of suspense, his affair was the first brought
on. Allen expressed himself in the most moderate
terms he could devise, saying that it sometimes
happened that the usefulness of an individual
was not in proportion to his zeal in the
cause he had espoused, or to his desire to fulfil its
duties, especially where the likings of two opposite
parties had to be consulted; that it so happened,
in the present case, that the individual in
question did not possess the confidence of the
masters, and that his remaining a member of the
Committee might therefore prove an obstacle in
the way of an amicable agreement. It was for the
meeting to declare whether they were willing to
take the chance of an accommodation by naming
some substitute for Clack, who might be equally
energetic in their service, and more agreeable to
their employers. After a pause, and with evident
effort, he added, that if the conduct of the
person in question had been, in all respects,
such as the Union could approve, it would have

94
gone hard with the committee before they would
have sanctioned his removal from office; but, as
it seemed too evident that the cause had received
injury by his means in ways which he might be
spared the pain of pointing out, they might consider
themselves relieved from the perplexity of
reconciling consideration for the individual with
a regard to the interests of the body.

A hubbub ensued; a strong party of Clackâs
friends raising shouts on his behalf, while opposing
cries rose on all sides of âDown with the
blusterer!â âWho waylaid the carrier?â âHe
is none of us. The Union keeps the laws.â
âLaw and concord! No Clack!â

Quiet was restored on Mr. Wentworthâs rising
to explain that his being present was not to be
considered as a sign that the masters would yield
on Clackâs dismissal. He had no authority to
confirm any such belief.

Applause,âand Clack doomed by an overwhelming
majority; whereupon his supporters
made their way to the waggon, agreed with him
that the meeting was not worth addressing, even
if he
had
been allowed to speak; and carried
him off on their shoulders to fish for popularity
in the streets of Manchester, while the meeting
conducted its affairs as well as it could without
him. So ended that matter, except that somehow
Clack and his party were forestalled in their
return into the town, and the walls everywhere
presented, conspicuous in white chalk, the phrase
which still rang in their ears, âLaw and Concord!
No Clack!â An extraordinary number

95
of little boys too seemed to have taken the fancy
to mimick the action of weaving, with arm and
foot, crying at the same time

âClickity, clickity, clack,

Lay him on his back!

Clickity, clickity, clack,

Away let him pack!â

Far more decorous was the meeting in their
rear, while the queries were dismissed, each in
its turn.

âThe case of Ann Howlett being admitted
by all parties to be a hard one, (her contract
being for wages which would not support her,)
was her breach of contract sanctioned by the
Union?â

Shouts of âNo; we would have helped her to
perform it!â

âIf this breach of contract had been sanctioned
by the Union, was it thought lawful revenge for
the committal of Ann Howlett to waylay the
carrier and strip his cart?â

Groans, and shouts of âNo revenge!â

Some one near the cart having spoken to
Allen, he put the question,â

âSupposing this attack to have no connexion
with Ann Howlettâs affair, does the Union sanction
forcible attempts to prevent work being carried
into the country?â

Answer, âNo. Law and Concord for ever!â

âIf the men abide by the law, and the masters
are found disposed to concord, will the Union be
disposed to concession?â

Mixed cries, the most distinguishable of which
was, âStick by the Union! The Union for ever!â

96
Mr. Wentworth and Allen exchanged nods, as
much as to say, âYou seeâââYes, I see.â

âSupposing the Union to be preserved entire,
are its members disposed to any concession in
respect of wages?â

Cries of âEqualization!â

âAn equalization is, as the Committee knows,
indispensable; but the point on which the Committee
has not yet received your instructions is
whether that equalization may be fixed below
the highest rate,
viz.
, that which Elliott is now
giving?â

The answers were at first hesitating, then confused,
so that no one prevailed.

âDonât press for an answer yet,â said Mr.
Wentworth. âI may tell them something which
may help their judgments.â

Way was made for Mr. Wentworth, and he
presented himself to speak.

âBefore you put this question to the vote, let
me just mention a circumstance or two that you
may not be aware of, from your having been lately
out of communication with the factories. There
are few things that we hear more of than of the
changes that all mortal things are liable to; and
these changes affect the affair we have in hand,
like all other affairs. We are told that every
one rises from sleep in the morning a different
man from him who lay down at night; there
having been a waste and repair of the substance
of which the bodily man is composed. In the
same manner, you may find that your strike is a
different thing to-day from what it was at its
beginning. Some of its parts have fallen off,

97
and others have been added. Whether your
body, having undergone this change, be the
more vigorous, like a man refreshed with sleep,
you know better than I. But further, whenever
you return to your work, you may find a factory
a very different place on re-entering from what
it was on your leaving it. There has been much
waste, I fear, without any repair. You know
what kind of waste I refer to. You have heard
of large orders, which we have been unable to
execute, having been sent to Scotland and elsewhere.
You know that much of our capital,
which ought by this time to be returning to us
again, has been for many weeks locked up in our
stocks of raw material. You know that the expense
of keeping on our establishments has not
been repaid by the production of goods for the
market; or the cost of maintaining ourselves and
our families, by the profitable employment of our
time and our wits. We have been consuming
idly, and so have you; and thus there must
needs have been great waste.âAnd what is it
which has been thus wasted? The fund which
is to maintain you; the fund out of which your
wages are paid. Your strike has already lasted
long enough to change our ground of dispute.
You will find that the question with the masters
now is, whether fewer of you than before shall be
employed at the same wages, or fewer still at
higher wages, or as many as before at lower wages
than you have yet received. Keep on your strike
a little longer, and the question will be, how
many less shall be employed, at how much less.

98
Keep it on long enough, and the question will
be entirely settled; there will be no wages for
anybody. Do you understand me?â

The speaker took snuff while the murmur of
disapprobation went round, and then continued.

âI do not suppose, any more than you, that
we shall come to this pass, because your capital
must be exhausted sooner than ours, and then
you must have bread, and will come to us for
work before our fund for wages is all wasted
away; but the nearer you drive us to this point,
the more injury you do yourselves. Let me
hear your objection, friend,â he continued to a
man in the crowd who looked eager to speak.
âWhere do you think me wrong? You acknowledge
that a strike is a bad thing, but sometimes
necessary to obtain a good one. Refusing
wages altogether for a time, is to be the means
of securing better afterwards. Do I understand
you right? Why, that would be very true if
you had the power or were in the habit of keeping
workmen and wages in proportion to each
other. If the masters had more capital than
was necessary to pay you all at the rate you
have hitherto received, you might gain your
point by a strike, not as you sometimes do now,
just for a little time till the masters can shake
themselves free of their engagement,âbut permanently.
But this is not the case. The mastersâ
capital does not return enough to pay you
all at the rate you desire. If they are to keep
their capital entire, you must either take less
wages, or fewer of you must take wages at all.

99
If you will all have the wages you desire, the
capital which pays them wastes away, and ruin
approaches. This is the worst event that could
happen, as I am sure we shall all agree. Your
alternative, therefore, is to withdraw a portion of
your people from taking wages, or all to take
less than you are striking for. You are not
satisfied yet? (speaking to the same man.)
Well, let me hear. There are places where
there are no strikes, because the workmen get as
high wages as they wish for? Very true; there
are such places, and London is one; concerning
which I heard, the other day, a case in point.

âThe money wages of skilled labour in London
were higher from 1771 to 1793 than was ever
known. They had been raised because prices
were high. They were afterwards somewhat
lowered; but as prices fell in a greater proportion
after the war, the real wages of skilled
labour are at present higher than they had ever
been. They cannot be lowered while, as at present,
there is an occasional deficiency of labour,
since the men would strike when most wanted by
the masters, and the loss thus caused would be
greater than the gain of giving lower wages. In
London there are two seasons in every year;
a slack season in which many workmen remain
unemployed; and a busy season in which they
work overhours, because there are not hands
enough. Now, here, you see, lies their advantage;
in the supply of labour being limited. If
it was the case with them, as with you, that some
of their class always remained unemployed, the

100
unemployed would undersell the busy, and wages
would fall. Then, as here, there would be
strikes; and then, as here, strikes would be of no
avail. Where there are permanently fewer workmen
than are wanted the men hold the power.
Where there is the exact number that is wanted,
the power is equal, and the contest fair. Where
there are more than are wanted, even to the extent
of three unemployed to a hundred, the power
is in the mastersâ hands, and strikes must fail.
Must there not be a larger surplus of unemployed
labour than this in our neighbourhood, and elsewhere,
since wages are fallen too low to enable
the labourer to do more than barely exist?
Allen, is there a silk small-ware weaver present,
do you suppose? They have just struck, I
find.â

Proclamation was made for a silk small-ware
weaver, and several held up their hands. In
answer to questions, they stated that within two
years their wages had been reduced forty-five
per cent. Two years before, common galloon
weaving was paid at the rate of 1
s.
10
d.
per
gross; it was now reduced to 1
s.
4
d.
per gross;
and it was for an addition of 2
d.
per gross that
the men struck: little enough when it is considered
that, in the winter season, a weaver cannot
average more than twelve gross per week. As
he has to pay for the hire of his loom, for winding,
for candle-light, and other expenses belonging
to his work, he has left only about 8
s.
a week
for himself and his family.

âCould so dreadful a reduction have ever

101
taken place,â continued Mr. Wentworth, âif you
had not undersold one another? And how are
the masters to help you if you go on increasing
your numbers and underselling one another, as if
your employers could find occupation for any
number of millions of you, or could coin the
stones under your feet into wages, or knead the
dust of the earth into bread? They do what
they can for you in increasing the capital on
which you are to subsist; and you must do the
rest by proportioning your numbers to the means
of subsistence. But see how the masters are
met! In Huddersfield the masters are doing
their utmost to extend their trade; but the
multitudes who are to subsist by it increase much
faster. There are now thirteen thousand work-people
in that place who toil for twopence halfpenny
a day. At Todmorden, the most skilful
work fourteen hours a day for the pittance of one
shilling. In the fair county of Kent there are
thirty thousand who earn no more than sixpence
a day. Compare this state of things with the
condition of skilled labour wages in London,
and see how much depends on the due proportion
of labourers, and the capital by which they
are to be fed. Would you could be convinced
that your strike, besides occasioning vexation and
ill-will between the two parties, besides inflicting
distress upon yourselves, and inconvenience upon
your employers, cannot but be worse than in
vain!â

During the last few sentences, several persons
had been engaged in conference with Bray, who

102
leaned over a corner of the waggon to hear what
they had to say. He now came forward and
placed himself beside Mr. Wentworth, observing
that all that had fallen from the gentleman
seemed pretty true and reasonable as far as it
went, but that it did not at all explain what
course the people had now to pursue. It was
poor comfort to tell the people that wages could
not be any higher on account of their numbers,
since it was not in their power to lessen those
numbers.

âIt is not with the view of giving present
comfort,â replied Mr. Wentworth, âthat I represent
what appears to me to be the truth: for
alas! there is but little comfort in the case any
way. My object is to prevent your making a
bad case worse; and if it were possible, to persuade
you not to prepare for your descendants a
repetition of the evils under which you are yourselves
suffering. All that you can now do, is to
live as you best may upon such wages as the
masters can give, keeping up your sense of respectability
and your ambition to improve your state
when better times shall come. You must watch
every opportunity of making some little provision
against the fluctuations of our trade, contributing
your money rather for your mutual relief in hard
times, than for the support of strikes. You
must place your children out to different occupations,
choosing those which are least likely
to be overstocked; and, above all, you must
discourage in them the imprudent, early marriages
to which are mainly owing the distresses

103
which afflict yourselves and those which will for
some time, I fear, oppress your children. You
ask me what you must do. These things are all
that I can suggest.â

âBut these things, sir, will not guard our
children any more than ourselves from the fluctuations
in trade you speak of.â

âBut they will prevent those fluctuations
from being so injurious as they now are. The
lower wages are, the more are such fluctuations
felt. In India, where an average dayâs wages
are only three-pence, the people live in the
poorest possible manner,âsuch as the poorest of
you have no idea of. Any decrease of wages,
therefore, makes the more weakly of the labourers
lie down and die. In Ireland, where the average
is five-pence a day, there is less positive
starvation than in India, but more distress on a
fall of wages, than in England. In England,
such fluctuations are less felt than in old days,
when the people knew nothing of many things
which you now call necessaries. The better the
state of the people, the better able are they to
stand against the changes to which all trades are
liable; but the worst of it is that we are all too
little inclined to foresee the effects of these
changes, and to provide for them; and when we experience
the necessary consequences of a change
which took place twenty years before, we are apt
to suppose these consequences arise from something
amiss at the present time. When a demand
for any article of manufacture makes
labour unusually profitable, labourers provide for

104
a great decline of wages in future years, by
bringing up large families to the same employment.
During many years, that is, while their
children are growing up, they feel no ill effects,
and suppose that all is going on right. When a
decline of wages comes, they suppose it happens
from some new circumstance, and not from their
own deed in overstocking the labour market.
Again; it must be some time before the effects
of a decline in lessening the supply of labour are
felt. A part of the population perishes slowly
from want and misery, and others are made
prudent in respect of marriage; but by the
time these checks are seen to operate, a new
period of prosperity has arrived, which is ascribed
by the people to accident. It is this impossibility
of making the supply of labour suit the
demand at a momentâs notice, which makes
fluctuations in trade so sensibly felt, for good or
for evil, by the labourer. Since he cannot, as
you say, Mr. Bray, diminish the number of
workmen when trade is slack, and if he wishes
his descendants not to be plunged into degradation
by extreme poverty, he will do what in him
lies to prevent population from increasing faster
than the capital which is to support it.â

Mr. Wentworth was encouraged to pursue his
argumentative manner of speaking by the attention
of the people near the waggon. Some of
them had become a little tired of the weekly
meetings at which their orators had said the
same things over and over again, and were
pleased to be reasoned with by one whom they

105
esteemed, and to obtain, by these means, a better
insight into their affairs than was given them by
leaders who were all of one party. The more the
present meeting assumed the character of a conference,
the more eagerly the most thinking men
in the crowd pressed towards the waggon, and
cheered the questions and replies. Those on the
outskirts, who were more fond of noise and display,
were at liberty to come and go as they
pleased; to listen to Mr. Wentworth, or to
follow Clack.

Bray now observed that population must
increase rapidly indeed, as it had outstripped the
increase of capital in the cotton manufacture. He
believed so rapid an increase of capital had never
been known before. To this Mr. Wentworth
replied by asking of the crowd whether there
was any one among them who had known James
Hargraves. An old man stept forwards and said
that he was a native of Blackburn, and had been
accustomed, as a boy, to frequent Hargravesâ
workshop; that he remembered seeing the carpenter
busy about his invention, and his own
delight at having the design of the spinning-jenny
explained to him by the inventor; he saw
directly how eight threads could be spun instead
of one, and thought it a very fine thing, and had
little notion how soon it would be so much improved
upon as that a little girl might work one
hundred, or one hundred and twenty spindles.
When was this? Why, a few years after the
old king George began to reign; in 1767, he
believed.

106
âWhen that king came to the throne,â
observed Mr. Wentworth, âthe whole value of
the cotton goods manufactured in this country
was only 200,000
l.
a year.â

âThere were very few people employed in it
then,â interrupted the old man. âWe had no
factories and no towns full of cotton-spinners
and weavers. My father used to take his work
home to his own cottage, and grow the flax
that was then used for warp in his own garden,
and set my mother to card and spin the raw
cotton for the weft. This, and getting the warp
from Ireland, was the way till Arkwrightâs spinning
frame came into use.â

âThen was the
time,â
time,â
said Mr. Wentworth,
âthat the people in China and in India had no
rivals in the market for whatever was made of
cotton. We owe it to these machines, and the
mule-jenny, and the power-loom that came in
afterwards, that though we have to bring our
cotton from thousands of miles off, and though
the wages in India are, as I said, only 3
d.
a day,
we have beaten them in the competition, and can
carry back their cotton five thousand miles, made
into a cheaper fabric than they can afford. Such
powers as these must make our capital grow;
and the fact is that the cotton manufacture is the
chief business carried on in the country, and that
it has enabled us to sustain burdens which would
have crushed any other people. Instead of
200,000
l.
, the annual produce of the manufacture
is now more than 36,000,000
l.
We have
no means of knowing how few persons were

107
employed sixty years ago; but it is reckoned
that the manufacture now affords subsistence to
more than 1,400,000 persons. This enormous
population has arisen naturally enough from the
rise of the manufacture; but your present condition
shows that it has already gone too far; and
it rests with yourselves to determine whether the
evil shall be found to have increased fifty years
hence. And now, Allen, you know the reason
of the clause I added to your query in the
arbour.â

âWill our trade go on
increasing?â
increasing?â
was the
next question asked.

âI hope and trust that it will, as we have got
the start of our competitors abroad; but it will
probably increase at a slower rate; and a succession
of strikes may prove its destruction.â

Here the speaker abruptly ceased, and nothing
could induce him to say more. He let himself
down from the waggon, and quietly made his
way through the crowd, thinking perhaps that
the people would draw their inferences from what
he had said more freely in his absence.

The substance of Mr. Wentworthâs argument,
and especially the last words he spoke, left Allen
and others thoughtful. They would not, on the
impulse of the moment, advise a compromise
with the masters; but appointed another general
meeting for the next day, to take into consideration
some matters of important concern.

One matter of important concern was taken
into immediate consideration, however. As
soon as Allen had turned his back, some members

108
of the committee recalled the crowd for a
few minutes, related how Allen had, from time
to time, refused money in compensation for his
services, and moved that a suit of clothes should
be voted to him. This was a present which he
could not refuse, if given under colour of enabling
him to appear more respectably as their advocate
before the masters, and would serve to
make a proper distinction between such a sound
friend to their cause as Allen, and such a frothy
fellow as Clack. The motion was carried by
acclamation; and as all Allenâs scruples were
so forestalled as that he could not decline the
gift, he was, before nightfall, clothed in a suit
which must mark him out at the meetings as
leader of the Union proceedings.

Chapter X.

HOPE DECLINING.

Alas! what is so fleeting as popularity! Allenâs
was in great part gone before morning. Some
mischievously disposed persons, who had marked
what impression had been made on the mind of
the secretary by Mr. Wentworthâs speech, and
who had afterwards ascertained that he wished
to propose a compromise with the masters, took
upon themselves to make known that the favourite

109
secretary had turned tail and meant to betray the
cause. A general gathering about the waggon
of all who scorned to be betrayed was advised,
in order to keep his friends at a distance and to
raise a hiss with the more effect. When, confident
of his reception, Allen advanced with a
smiling countenance, in order to express his gratification
at the mark of esteem he had received,
he was startled by a burst of groans and hisses.
For a moment he looked about him to see if Clack
or any other unpopular person was standing near;
but signs not to be mistaken convinced him too
soon that he was the object of the peopleâs dislike.
He coloured scarlet, and was about to cover his
face with his hands, but checked himself, and,
by a strong effort, stood it out. Those who were
near him saw how the papers in his hand shook;
but his countenance was fixed and his attitude
firm. After many vain attempts to make himself
heard, he stripped off his new coat, folded it up
and placed it in the hands of the committee-men
near, and sent a messenger home for his working
dress. This he communicated to the meeting
the first moment that they would let him speak.
He would not accept any gift from those to
whom his services were no longer acceptable.
He was ready to resign his office,âan arduous
office, which they no doubt remembered had been
forced upon him,âas soon as they should direct
him into whose hands he should deliver his
papers. In the meanwhile, he would proceed
with their business, forgetful of all personal considerations.

110
All propositions, whether made by himself or
others, tending to a compromise, were rejected,
and the meeting, after a stormy discussion, in
which no point was settled, broke up. The
whole affair put Clack and his friends in glee,
and filled wiser people with grief and apprehension
of the consequences.

The first consequence was that all the children
were turned off. The masters were bent on
bringing the affair to a close as speedily as possible;
and, being disappointed in the hope that
the men would propose a compromise, endeavoured
to drive them to it.

This was thought by some parents far from
being the worst thing that had happened. While
the Committee shook their heads over this
weighty additional item of weekly charge, many
tender mothers stroked their childrenâs heads
and smiled when they wished them joy of their
holiday, and bade them sleep on in the mornings
without thinking of the factory bell.âIt was
some days before the little things got used to so
strange a difference from their usual mode of
life. Some would start up from sound sleep
with the question, âFather, is it time?â Some
talked in their sleep of being too late, and went
on to devour their meals hastily, as if their time
was not their own.âIt would have amused some
people and made others melancholy to watch
the sports of these town-bred children. One
little girl was seen making a garden;âthat is,
boring a hole between two flints in a yard with
a rusty pair of scissors and inserting therein a

111
daisy which by some rare chance had reached
her hands. Others collected the fragments of
broken plates and teacups from the kennels, and
spread them out for a mock feast where there was
nothing to eat. The favourite game was playing
at being cotton-spinners, a big boy frowning and
strutting and personating the master, another
with a switch in his hand being the overlooker,
and the rest spinners or piecers, each trying
which could be the naughtiest and get the most
threats and scolding. Many were satisfied with
lolling on the stairs of their dwellings and
looking into the streets all day long; and many
nursed their baby brothers and sisters, sitting on
the steps or leaning against the walls of the street.
Hannah Bray, when not abroad with her father,
took pains to stir up her little neighbours to what
she called play. She coaxed her father into
giving them a ball, and tried to teach the
children in the next yard to play hide and seek;
but she often said she never before saw such
helpless and awkward people. They could not
throw a ball five feet from them, or flung it in
one anotherâs faces so as to cause complaints and
crying-fits. In hiding, they always showed themselves,
or came out too soon or not soon enough,
or jostled and threw one another down; and
they were the worst runners that could be conceived.
Any one of them trying to catch Hannah
looked like a duck running after a greyhound.
Hannah began with laughing at them all round;
but observing that her father watched their play
with tears in his eyes, she afterwards contented

112
herself with wondering in silence why some
children were so unlike others.

The affairs of all concerned in the strike looked
more and more dismal every day. There were
more brawls in the streets; there was less peace
at home; for none are so prone to quarrel as
those who have nothing else to do, and whose
tempers are at the same time fretted by want.
All the men who were prone to drink now spent
hour after hour at the alehouse, and many a
woman now for the first time took to her âdrop
of comfortâ at home. Many a man who had
hitherto been a helper to his wife and tender to
his children, began to slam the door behind him,
after having beaten or shaken the little ones all
round, and spoken rough words to their trembling
mother. While she, dashing away her tears,
looked for something to do, and found one thing
that she would wash if she had fuel and soap,
and another that she would mend if she had
material and cotton.âNow was the time to see
the young woman, with the babe in her arms,
pushing at the curtained door of the dram-shop,
while her husband held it against her,âhe saying,ââWell,
I tell you Iâm coming in five minutes;
I shanât be five minutes,ââand she plaintively
replying, âAh, I know, you always say so.ââNow
was the time to see the good son pacing
slowly to the pawnbrokerâs to pledge his aged
motherâs last blanket to buy her bread. These
were the days when the important men under the
three balls civilly declared, or insolently swore,
that they could and would take no more goods in

113
pawn, as their houses were full from top to bottom,
and there was no sale for what they had
encumbered themselves with. Never before had
they been so humbly petitioned for loans,âa
mother shewing that her winter shawl or her
childâs frock would take very little room,âor a
young girl urging that if a pawnbroker did not
want her grandmotherâs old bible he could get
more for it at a book-stall than she could. These
were the times for poor landlords to look after their
rents, and for hard landlords to press for them.
These were the days for close scrutiny to be
made by the Union Committee whether menâs
wives were really lying-in, and whether each
really had the number of children he swore to;
and, therefore, these were the times when knaves
tried to cheat and when honest men were wounded
at having their word questioned. Now was the
time when weak-minded men thought themselves
each worse off than his neighbour. Many landlords
were pronounced the hardest that ever
owned two paltry rooms; many an applicant
was certain the committee had been set against
him by some sneaking enemy. In the abstract
it was allowed, however, that the sneakers had
the most to bear. Hare, for one, was in the
depth of distress. Opposition was made, week
after week, to his having any relief from the
committee because he was not a hearty member
of the Union; and on one occasion, when he had
with the utmost difficulty obtained an extra shilling
for his lying-in wife, and had failed in his
plea that he was dunned for rent, he found on

114
returning home that his landlord had sent in the
officers during his
absence
absence
, who had taken away
all the little he possessed, but the mattress on
which his wife lay. It was laid on the floor,
the bedstead being gone; and the children and
their mother were left crying within four bare
walls.âAllen, to whose knowledge this hard
case was brought, could do little to relieve it;
but he almost succeeded in convincing his nervous
wife that their own sufferings were light in
comparison. Yet they had many painful sacrifices
to make,âthe more painful to Allen because
his wife was not convinced that they were necessary.
She urged that he might now ask for
some of the money the Committee had formerly
offered him, since his services had not been
repaid even in empty good-will, to the degree
that he deserved. It was his duty, she thought,
to demand more than the common weekly allowance;
and the least he could do for his children
was to take the suit of clothes back again which
he had thrown away in a pet. Failing in her
arguments, she had recourse to two measures,âone
of action and the other of persuasion. She
went secretly to the Committee, and asked in her
husbandâs name for the clothes, which she sold
on her way home, trying to persuade herself
that she was only doing a motherâs duty in providing
her children with bread; and then she
assailed her husband on the subject of taking
work at the masterâs prices. She knew that he
now wished for a compromise and thought the
strike had been continued too long, and she

115
would not see why he was bound to wait till the
Union viewed the matter as he did. She thought
it very cruel to talk of honour, and very absurd to
plead duty when he knew that his family were
in want, and could not deny that it was not by
his own choice that he had filled so conspicuous
a station. It made Allen very miserable to hear
her talk in this manner, sobbing between almost
every word she said; especially when little Martha
looked wistfully from one to the other, not understanding
the grounds of the dispute, but hoping
that it would end in fatherâs leaving off walking
about the room in that manner, and in motherâs
stopping her sobs, and in there being something
better than those nasty potatoes for dinner.
Once or twice she tried to make her bulfinch
sing so loud that they could not hear one another
speak; but this did not do, for her mother twitched
off her apron and flung it over the cage, so that
the poor bird cowered down in a corner for the
whole day afterwards.

One morning when Allen had persuaded his
wife that he was immovable, and that the best
thing she could do was to go out and buy some
potatoes with what money they had, he came
and leaned over the table to see Martha feed her
bird.

âYou are as fond of that bird as ever,
Martha.â

âYes,âand I have so much time to teach
him things now.â

âHad you rather play with him or be at the
factory all day?â

âI donât know. My knees are so much better

116
since I have been at home, and I like playing
with Billy; but mother has got to cry so lately;
and, father, we are all so tired of potatoes, we
donât know how to eat them.â

âPoor child! I wish we could give you anything
better. But, Martha, do you think you
could bear to stay at home without Billy?â

Marthaâs countenance fell.

âYou see, my dear child, we have sold
almost everything we have; and when we can
scarcely get food for ourselves, it does not seem
to me right to keep animals to feed. This was
why I sold the dog so many weeks ago.â

âBut, father, it is only just a halfpenny now
and then. Mother has always found me a halfpenny
now and then for Billy.â

âA halfpenny is as much to us now, child, as
a guinea is to some people; besides we could
get money by Billy. Ah! I knew it would
make you cry to say so.â

And he left her and walked about the room in
the way which it always frightened Martha to
see. She sobbed out a few words,â

âI canâtâI canât help crying, father, but I
donât meanâI wish you would take Billy and
sell him.â

âListen to me, my dear child,â said Allen sitting
down by her, and putting his arm round her
waist. âYou were always a very good little
girl in working industriously as long as you had
work. Now you cannot earn money by working,
but you can get some by giving up your
bird. Now, you know I always tried to make
you as comfortable as I could when you earned

117
money, and I promise you, that I will do the same
if you will let me sell your bird. The very first
money that I can properly spare, when better
days come, shall go to buy you a bird, and this
very bird if we can get it back again.â

Martha thanked him, and said the bird should
go for certain; but if this very bird could not be
got back again, she would rather have a triangle
like Hannahâs, and then, she thought, they might
all grow rich. Allen smiled and said they would
see about that when the time came; in the
meanwhile, if Billy was to go, the sooner the
better, and all the more as she had just cleaned
the cage; and he took his hat.

Martha struggled with her tears, and asked if
she might go too. Her father thought she had
better not; but she said nobody could make
Billy sing all his songs so well as herself; so her
father kissed her, and let her follow him down
stairs, asking Fieldâs wife who happened to be
in good humour, to have an eye to the children
till their mother came home.

It was a sad trial to Martha to hear the bird-fancier
speak slightingly of her pet, and remark
that the cage was very shabby. She had a great
mind at first to make Billy seem dull, which she
knew how to do: but remembering that this
would punish nobody but her father, she put
away the evil thought, and made Billy sing his
best songs in his clearest tone. The bargain
was made; her father bade the bird-fancier pay
the money into her hand, and whispered that he
wished he had anything which would sell for so

118
much. When they were on the threshold, she
once more turned round. The man was twirling
the cage in a business-like manner, between his
hands. âO, once more!â cried Martha, running back.
Once more Billy fluttered at the
sight of her, and put out his beak between the
wires to meet her lips; and then she went away
without looking back any more. Every day for
the next fortnight, however, little Martha lingered
about the bird-fancierâs door, doing all she
could without being observed, to set Billy singing.
One day she was remarked by her parents
to be very silent; and after that she went out
less. She had missed Billy, though his empty
cage still hung in the shop; and having made
bold to ask, had found that he was sold to a
country customer; really gone for ever. This
hope destroyed, Martha tried to comfort herself,
as she had proposed, with visions of a triangle.

Chapter XI.

FINAL DELIBERATION.

The spirits of the people were sunk, not only by
poverty, but by a more bitter disappointment
than had attended any former strike. The Combination
Laws having formerly been the great
object of dread and hatred, it had been too hastily
supposed that the repeal of these laws would

119
give all that was wanted; whereas the repeal
only left the people free to make the best bargain
they could for their labour, without its having any
thing to do with the grounds of the bargain.
The repeal could not increase the supply of
capital, or diminish the supply of labour; it could
not therefore affect the rate of wages.

One more event was looked to with hope; the
arrival of the delegates who had travelled in
search of support. They had remitted money as
they had received it, and the remittances had
fallen off much of late; but it was still hoped
that the messengers might bring such assurances
of sympathy and support, as might justify
the people in holding out a little longer. These
men, who returned nearly all at the same time,
were met some miles out on the road, greeted
with cheers, carried to the Committee-room, and
with difficulty left alone with the Committee to
tell their business.

These men brought advice and intelligence so
various as might have perplexed the most discerning
and prudent of all managers of public
affairs. There were exhortations from some
places to hold out to the very last shilling; and
from others to retreat, while retreat could be
managed with honour. Some distant friends
gave them a kindly warning to look for no more
contributions from that quarter; and others
were sorry to send so little at present, but hoped
to raise such and such sums before they should
be much wanted. Some sent word that it had
always been a bad case which they could not

120
in conscience support, while so many more promising
needed help; others declared that if ever
there was a righteous cause, this was it, and that
they should brand with the name of traitor the
first who quailed. While the members of the
Committee sighed and inquired of one another
what they were to think of such opposite advice,
and each delegate was vehement in urging the
superior value of that which he brought, Allen
proposed that they should abide by the advice
of the London delegates, who had been in communication
with persons who understood more of
the matter in hand, than any who occupied a less
central situation. All agreed to this, and the
consideration of the matter was deferred till the
next morning, when the delegates were expected
to have arrived from London.

Every member of the Committee was in his
place the next morning, and the expected messengers
appeared at the foot of the table, and
delivered in their report, which was brief enough.
Their London friends believed their strike to be
in a hopeless condition, and advised their making
the best terms they could with their masters,
without any further waste of time and capital.
Not that all combinations were disapproved of by
their London advisers; there were cases in which
such union was highly desirable, cases of especial
grievance from multiplication of apprentices, or
from unfair methods of measuring work, or from
gross inequality of wages, &c.; but for a general
and permanent rise of wages, no strike could
ultimately prevail, where there was a permanent

121
proportion of unemployed labour in the market.
A proportion of three per cent. of unemployed
labour must destroy their chance against the
masters.

âJust what Wentworth told us,â observed a
committee-man. âPray did you inquire whether
it is possible to get a rate of wages settled by
law?â

âOf course, as we were instructed so to do;
and the answer is what you probably expect,âthat
unless the law could determine the amount
of capital, and the supply of labour, it cannot
regulate wages. The law might as well order
how much beef every man shall eat for his daily
dinner, without having any power to supply
cattle. If there be not cattle enough, men cannot
have law beef. If there be not capital
enough, men cannot have law wages.â

âBesides,â observed the other delegate,
âwages-laws involve the same absurdity as the
combination laws we are so glad to have got rid
of. Every man who is not a slave has a right
to ask a price for his labour; and if one man has
this right, so have fifty or fifty thousand. What
is an innocent act in itself, cannot be made guilt
by being done by numbers; and if Government
treats it as guilt, Government treats those who
do it as slaves. Government then interferes
where it has no business. This was the argument
in the case of the combination laws, and it
holds in this case too: Government is neither
buyer nor seller, and has nothing to do with the
bargain; and having nothing to do with it, could

122
neither pass a just wages-law, nor enforce it
when passed, any more than in the case of the
combination laws, which we all know to have
been unjust and perpetually evaded.â

As it was now clear that the turn-out must
come to a speedy end, the committee decided to
waste no more time in discussion, but to proceed
to immediate action. Allen begged to produce
the accounts, which were balanced up to the present
day, and the sight of which would, he
thought, quicken their determination to let all
get work who could. He had for some time
found it difficult to get a hearing on the subject
of the accounts, as his brethren were bent on
holding out, and would listen to nothing which
opposed their wishes; but they were now completely
roused. âHow much have we left?â
was their first question.

âLeft!â exclaimed Allen. âYou know I
have been telling you for this fortnight past that
we are deficient 70
l.
, without reckoning the bills
for advertisements, which had not then come in,
and which, I am sorry to say, swell the amount
considerably.â

This declaration was received with murmurs,
and on the part of some, with loud declarations
that there must have been mistake or bad
management.

Allen passed his hand over his forehead, while
enduring the bitter pang caused by this outcry;
but he recovered himself instantly.

âThere are the accounts,â he said. âSee for
yourselves whether there has been any mistake,

123
and bring home to me, if you can, your charge
of bad management. You pressed the task upon
me in the first instance against my will; you
referred it to my disinterestedness to resume it,
when, fearing that I had lost the confidence of
the people, I would have resigned it. At your
call, I have done my best, andâthis is my
reward!â

There was a cry of âShame, shame!â and
two or three friends rose in turn to say for Allen
what he was too modest to say for himself; that
the unthankful office had been repeatedly forced
upon him, because there was no other man who
could discharge it so well; that he had never
been detected in a mistake, never found in the
rear of his business, never accepting fee or reward,
neverâ

This eulogium was interrupted by objections.
He
had
erred in involving the Union with the
editor of a newspaper, who now unexpectedly
brought an enormous charge for the insertion of
notices, intelligence, &c., which it had been supposed
he was glad to print gratuitously. Allen

had
also claimed fee and reward in a way which,
to say the best of it, was shabby.

Allen calmly related the facts of the transaction
with the editor, leaving it to his judges to
decide whether the
misunderstanding
misunderstanding
arose from
carelessness on his part, or from some other
cause. As to the other charge, what fee or
reward had he taken?

âThe clothes, the clothes!â was the cry.
âTo send for them privately to sell, after pretending

124
to give them back in the face of the
people. Fie! Shabby!â

Allen looked on his thread-bare dress with a
smile, supposing this a mistake which a moment
would clear up. He went to the press belonging
to the committee, where the clothes had been
deposited, and flung open the doors. He looked
very naturally surprised at their having disappeared,
and turned round with an open countenance
to say,

âI see how it is. Some dishonest person
has used my name to obtain possession of the
clothes. I give you my word of honour that I
have never seen the clothes, or known that
they were not here, since the hour that I gave
them back in the face of the people.â

All believed him, and some had consideration
enough to command silence by gesture; but
before it could take effect, the fact was out, that
Allenâs own wife was the âdishonest person.â
While he silently walked to the window, and
there hid his face in his hands, his friends called
on business which attracted attention from him.
It was pay-day, and what was to be done?
What funds were in hand?

Allen returned to his seat to answer this
question; and, as all were just now disposed to
do as he pleased, he carried his point of honesty,
and obtained authority to lessen the allowance
one-half, and give advice to every applicant
to attend the afternoon meeting for the purpose
of voting for the dissolution of the strike.

Of these applicants, some were glad, and some

125
were sorry to receive the advice of the paymaster;
but there was a much greater unity of
opinion about the reduction of the allowance.
Some murmured, some clamoured, some silently
wept, some sighed in resignation; but all felt
it a great hardship, and wondered what was to
become of them either way, if it was true, as Mr.
Wentworth had said, that the wages-fund of the
masters
and
and
the Union-fund of the men were
wasting away together. Some were ready with
bad news for Allen in return for that which he
offered to them.

âYou will be worst off, after all, Allen; for
there is not a master that will give you work.â

âDid you hear, Allen, what Elliott said about
you? He hopes you will go to him for work,
that he may have the pleasure of refusing you.â

âMortimer has got a promise out of his
cowardly partner, that he will not let you set foot
on the premises, Allen, on account of the part
you have taken.â

âThey say, Allen, that you are a marked man
in Manchester, and that no master in any trade
will take you in among his men. What do you
think of doing, I wonder?â

This question Allen could not have answered
if he had wished it. It was again put to him by
his wife, who waited for him in the street to tell
him through her tears all the evil-bodings which
a succession of Jobâs comforters had been pouring
into her ears since the news of the probable
dissolution of the strike had got wind. âWhat

126
do you think of doing, I wonder?â was still the
burden of her wail.

âDo you know that man?â replied her husband,
pointing to a wasted and decrepit man
who was selling matches; âthat man was once
a well-paid spinner. He lost his health in his
employment, and now, at forty years of age, is
selling matches from door to door. He has
submitted to Godâs will. I too will submit to
sell matches, if it be Godâs will that I should
lose my good name as innocently as that man
has lost his health.â

âI told you how it would be. I told youââ
cried Mary.

âI too foresaw it, Mary, and prepared myself
for much;âbut not for all.â

He reproached her no further for the injury
she had done to his good name than by declaring
his unalterable will that not an article should be
purchased by her beyond a bare supply of daily
food till the clothes were bought back again and
restored to the Committee, or their full value, if
they could not be recovered.

Chapter XII.

HOPE EXTINCT.

There had been a lingering hope among some
who would fain have stood out longer, that this
dayâs post would have brought the wherewithal

127
to build up new expectations and prolong the
struggle. The wiser ones had resolved that not
even the receipt of 200
l.
should shake their determination
to return to work; but there was no
question about the matter, for no money came.âA
prodigious amount of business was done in
the few hours preceding the final meeting. The
masters met and settled that they would give no
more than the medium wages,âthat is, the rate
given by Wentworth; Elliot carelessly consenting
to lower his, and Mortimer being with difficulty
persuaded to raise his. Rowe was consulted only
as a matter of form, and the other firms had to
make slight differences or none at all. They
agreed to yield the point of their men belonging
to the Union, since it appeared vain to contest it
while of importance, and needless when not so.âThe
men settled that they must agree to a
medium rate of wages, and make what they could
of having obtained an equalization, such as it was,
and of being permitted to adhere to the Union.âClack
agitated for his own private interest,âto
get himself appointed to some salaried office
in the Union, as he was no more likely to obtain
employment from the masters than Allen.âSo
much was settled beforehand as to leave little to
be done at the meeting but to make a public declaration
of agreement.

With dark countenances and lagging steps the
people came,ânot in proud procession, with
banners and music and a soldier-like march, but
in small parties or singly, dropping into the track
from by-streets and lanes, and looking as if they

128
were going to punishment rather than to consultation.
There was a larger proportion than
usual of ragged women and crying babies; for,
as the women had been all along opposed to the
strike, they were sensible of a feeling of mournful
triumph in seeing it dissolved. Bray was present,
without his pipe and his bells, for this was
no time for lively music; but he carried his drum
to be used as a signal for silence if the speakers
should find any difficulty in obtaining a hearing.
He beat a roll between each proposition submitted
and agreed to; and thus did his last
service to the turn-out he had watched from its
commencement.

Proposed:âThat as the masters are represented
to be inclined to concession, the men shall
do their part towards promoting an adjustment
of their differences, agreeing to take such and
such a rate of wages, provided that the masters
pay all alike, and that the men be not disturbed
in their peaceable adherence to the Union.âAgreed.

Proposed: that the men shall set apart a
portion of their weekly earnings, as soon as able
to do so, and in proportion to the size of their
families, in order to liquidate the debt incurred
on account of the strike now about to be closed.âMurmurs.

Allen came forward to state the gross amount
of subscriptions and expenses, intimating that
the account-books would be left at the Committee-room
for one month, open to the inspection
of all who could prove themselves to belong

129
to the Union. It would be seen through what
unavoidable circumstances a debt had been incurred,
and how essential it was to the honour
of the body that it should be liquidated as soon
as possible.

No reasonable exception could be made to any
of the items of expenditure. The people could
only wonder that there should be such crowds of
children to receive pay, so many lying-in women
to be relieved, so many sick persons to be aided,
and so much to pay for printing and advertising.
They could not deny that the expenses of the
Committee had been very small.

This explanation finished, Allenâs part was
done. He had neither faults of his own nor
favours of theirs to acknowledge. He spoke
not of himself, but, when he had rendered his
account, gravely made his bow and retired.

Clack then came forward, and, supported by
a powerful party of friends near the waggon,
succeeded in obtaining the public ear. With
more success than delicacy, he enlarged upon his
public services, pleaded his betrothment to one
who was now suffering under the persecution of
the masters, as a title to their support, as well as
the certainty that he should not again be employed
by any firm in Manchester. He declared
that were it only through zeal for their rights,
he would marry Ann Howlett as soon as she
came out of prisonââ

âIf she will have you,â cried somebody; and
the crowd laughed.

Clack repeated his declaration without noticing

130
the doubt, and moreover declared his willingness
to travel into every county in England, Scotland,
and Ireland, in behalf of the Union. He boasted
of his connexions in all places, and pointed out
the wisdom there would be in employing him as
a missionary of the Union, in preparation for
any future struggle.âThis proposal went a degree
too far in impudence, or Clack might, perhaps,
have gained his object; for he seemed to have
recovered his hold on the people in proportion as
that of better men had been weakened. A plain
statement from the Committee that, as they were
in debt, they had no power at present to appoint
a missionary, served, however, to disappoint
Clackâs hopes. He skilfully laid hold of the
words âat present,â and left it an understood
matter between himself and the people that the
office was to be his by and by.

Within half an hour, not a trace of the meeting
was left but the trampled grass and the empty
waggon. The people seemed to try who could
flee the fastest, some to obtain the first access to
the masters, some to get out of sight of a scene
which had become disagreeable, and some few to
talk big at the Spread-Eagle of what might have
happened if this cowardly Committee would but
have stood out a little longer.

Allenâs steps were directed to Mr. Wentworthâs
counting-house. âI will ask work of him and
of him only, in this line,â thought he. âIf I
fail, I must take to some other occupation.
They can hardly be all shut against an honest
man.â

131
âI am sorry for you, Allen,â was Mr. Wentworthâs
reply when, with some difficulty, Allen
had made his way through a crowd of people on
the same errand with himself. âBut you shall
pronounce upon the case yourself. I can employ
now only two-thirds of the number who turned
out from me. Of these, at least half left me
unwillingly, and have therefore the first title to
employment; and the rest have worked for my
firm for many years. At the best, I must refuse
many whose services I should be glad to keep;
judge then whether I can take on a stranger, be
he who he may.â

Allen bowed and had no more to say.

âIf the firm you worked under cannot take
you on, I fear you have little chance, Allen; for
all are circumstanced like myself, I believe.â

Allen shook his head, and would trespass no
longer on Mr. Wentworthâs time.

In the street he met Bray, who was looking
for him to say farewell, while Hannah was doing
the same to little Martha. Where were they
going, and why so soon?

There was nothing to stay for now, Bray
thought; for he had no liking to see honest men
stand idle in the labour-market, except by their
own choice. Choice made the entire difference
in the case. As for where he was going,âhe
and Hannah must find out where people were
most fond of street music and dancing, and
would pay the best for it. And this put him in
mind of what he had to say. He was as much
obliged as Hannah herself, and more, by the

132
hospitality with which she had been received at
Allenâs house; but his friend could not suppose
he meant his daughter to be any charge upon the
family in times like these. On this account, and
for old friendshipâs sake, and from the sympathy
which one proscribed man should feel for another,
he hoped Allen would do him the favour to
pocket this little bit of paper and say no more
about it.âAllen agreed so far as to defer saying
much about it till better times should come. He
only just told Bray that the bank note was most
acceptable at present for a very particular purpose,
wrung his friendâs hand, and ran home to fetch
his wife, that the suit of clothes might be rebought
without loss of time. They proved a dear bargain;
but that was a secondary consideration,
poor as Allen was. He went to rest that night,
satisfied that his honour was redeemed, and that
his wife would scarcely venture to put it in pawn
again.

His wife said to herself that she had no idea
he could have been so stern as he was all this
day; she scarcely knew him for William Allen.âMany
people made the same observation
from this time forward. His sternness only appeared
when matters of honour were in question,
and no one who knew by what means he had
been made jealous on this point wondered at the
tone of decision in which a once weak and timid
man could speak. But there were other circumstances
which made them scarcely able to believe
him the same William Allen. He no longer
touched his hat to the masters, or appeared to

133
see them as they passed. He no longer repaired
to the Spread-Eagle to hear or tell the news, or
to take part in consultation on the affairs of the
workmen of Manchester, though he was ever
ready to give his advice with freedom and mildness
when called upon. He stated that he was
a friend to their interests, and therefore anxious
to avoid injuring them by being one of the body.
He would not even represent his children, who
grew up one after another to be employed in the
factories, while their father toiled in the streets
with his water-cart in summer and his broom in
winter; enduring to be pointed out to strangers
as the leader of an unsuccessful strike, as long as
his family were not included with himself in the
sentence of proscription.

When will it be understood by all that it rests
with all to bring about a time when opposition
of interests shall cease? When will masters
and men work cheerfully together for their common
good, respect instead of proscribing each
other, and be equally proud to have such men as
Wentworth and William Allen of their fellowship?

Summary of Principles illustrated in this Volume.

Commodities
, being produced by capital and
labour, are the joint property of the capitalist and
labourer.

The capitalist pays in advance to the labourers
their share of the commodity, and thus becomes
its sole owner.

The portion thus paid is
Wages
.

Real Wages
are the articles of use and consumption
that the labourer receives in return for
his labour.

Nominal Wages
are the portion he receives
of these things reckoned in money.

The fund from which wages are paid in any
country consists of the articles required for the
use and consumption of labourers which that
country contains.

The proportion of this fund received by
individuals must mainly depend on the number
among whom the fund is divided.

The rate of wages in any country depends,
therefore, not on the wealth which that country
contains, but on the proportion between its capital
and its population.

As population has a tendency to increase

135
faster than capital, wages can be prevented from
falling to the lowest point only by adjusting the
proportion of population to capital.

The lowest point to which wages can be permanently
reduced is that which affords a bare
subsistence to the labourer.

The highest point to which wages can be permanently
raised is that which leaves to the capitalist
just profit enough to make it worth his
while to invest his capital.

The variations of the rate of wages between
these extreme points depending mainly on the
supply of labour offered to the capitalist, the rate
of wages is mainly determined by the sellers, not
the buyers of labour.

Combinations of labourers against capitalists
(whatever other effects they may have) cannot
secure a permanent rise of wages unless the
supply of labour falls short of the demand;âin
which case, strikes are usually unnecessary.

Nothing can permanently affect the rate of
wages which does not affect the proportion of
population to capital.

Legislative interference does not affect this
proportion, and is therefore useless.

Strikes affect it only by wasting capital, and
are therefore worse than useless.

Combinations may avail or not, according to
the reasonableness of their objects.

Whether reasonable or not, combinations are

136
not subjects for legislative interference; the law
having no cognizance of their causes.

Disturbance of the peace being otherwise provided
against, combinations are wisely therefore
now left unregarded by the law.

The condition of labourers may be best improved,â

1st. By inventions and discoveries which create
capital.

2d. By husbanding instead of wasting capital:âfor
instance by making savings instead of
supporting strikes.

3d.
By adjusting the proportion of population
to capital
.

COUSIN MARSHALL.

Chapter I.

A VERY HOT MORNING.

The gray light of a summerâs morning was dawning
on the cathedral towers of the city of ââ,
when Mr. Burke, a surgeon, returned on horseback
from the country, where he had been detained
by a patient till past midnight. It was
Sunday morning, and he was therefore less surprised
than grieved to see what kind of people
they were who still loitered in the streets, and
occasionally disturbed the repose of those who
slept after their weekly toils. Here and there
lay on a door-step, or in the kennel, a working
man, who had spent his weekâs wages at the alehouse,
and on being turned out when the clock
struck twelve, had sunk down in a drunken sleep.
Farther on were more of the same class, reeling
in the middle of the street, or holding by the
walls of the houses, with just sense enough to
make their way gradually homewards, where
their wives were either watching anxiously, or disturbed
with miserable dreams on their account.
The sound of the horseâs hoofs on the pavement

2
roused the watchmen, of whom one rubbed his
eyes, and came out of his box to learn the hour
from the church clock, while another began to
make a clearance of the tipplers, bidding them
move on with threats which were lost upon their
drowsy ears. One of these guardians of the
night, however, was too far gone in slumber to
be roused like the rest. Perhaps his own snoring
prevented his hearing that any one passed
by. Mr. Burke tickled this manâs ear with his
riding whip, and asked him the meaning of certain
clouds of dun smoke which were curling up,
apparently at some little distance, between the
gazers and the pale eastern sky. The watchmanâs
wit served him just so far as to suggest
that there ought to be no smoke in that direction
at this hour of a Sunday morning, and that he
supposed smoke must come from fire. Upon
this hint, Mr. Burke rode off at full trot, through
such byways as would lead him most directly to
the spot. Before he got there, however, his
fears were confirmed by the various methods in
which information of a fire is given. Rattles
were sprung in quick succession, shouts and
whoops were echoed from street to street, a red
blaze was reflected from every chimney, and
glittered like the setting sun on the windows of
the upper storys, and the clangor of bells followed
in less time than could have been supposed
possible. Window after window was
thrown up, as Mr. Burke passed, and nightcapped
heads popped out with the incessant inquiryââFire!
Where?â

3
This was what Mr. Burke was as anxious as
any one to know, and he therefore increased his
speed till he arrived on the spot, and found that
it was not a dwelling-house, but a large grocery
warehouse, that was in flames. Having satisfied
himself that no lives were in danger, and that
every one was on the alert, he hastened homewards
to deposit his horse, and quiet his sisterâs
alarms, and returned to give assistance.

When he came back, two or three engines
were on the spot, but unable to work from a deficiency
of water. The river was not far distant;
but so many impediments arose from the disposition
of some of the crowd to speculate idly on
the causes of the fire, and of others to bustle
about without doing any good, that the flames
were gaining ground frightfully. As more gentlemen
arrived, however, they assisted Mr. Burke
in his exertions to form two lines down to the
river side, by one of which the full, and by the
other the empty, buckets might be passed with
regularity and speed. Meanwhile, the crowd
felt themselves at liberty to crack their jokes, as
nothing but property was yet at stake.

A child clapped its hands in glee, as a pale
blue flame shot up where there had been no light
before.

âThatâs rum,â said a man. âIf there be
raisins beside it, âtis a pity we are not near
enough to play snap-dragon.â

âThere will be a fine treat for the little ones
when all is cool again,â observed another. âA
fine store of lollipops under the ruins. Look

4
how the hogsheads of sugar light one after
another, like so many torches!â

âThey say tea is best made of river water,â
said a third; âand it canât but boil in such a
fire; so suppose you fetch your tea-service,
neighbour.â

âRather tea than beer,â replied another.
âDid you taste the beer from the brewery fire?
Pah! âtwas like what sea-water will be when the
world is burnt.â

âI missed my share then,â answered the
neighbour; âbut I got two or three gallons of
what was let out because the white-washerâs boy
was drowned in it. That was none the worse,
that I could find out. My wife was squeamish
about it, so I had it all to myself. Heyday!
whatâs this about? Why, they wonât let a man
look on in peace!â

The constables were now vigorously clearing
a space for the firemen, as there was some apprehension
that the flames were spreading backwards,
where there were courts and alleys
crowded with dwellings of the poor. The fear
was soon perceived to be too well founded.
From an arched passage close by the burning
building there presently issued a half-dressed
woman with two children clinging to her, a third
girl shivering and crying just behind, and a boy
following with his arms full of clothes and bedding.
Mr. Burke was with them instantly.

âHave the houses behind caught fire?â

âOurs has, sir; and it canât be saved, for
there is no way to it but this. Not a thing could

5
we get out but what we have on; but, thank God,
we are all safe!â

âO, mammy, mammy!â cried the elder girl.
âShe has not been out of bed this week, sir.
Sheâll die with cold.â

Mr. Burke had observed the ghastly look of
the woman. He now bade her compose herself,
and promised that the children should be taken
care of, if she would tell him where she wished
to go. She answered doubtfully that her sister
lived in the next street.

âO, not there, mother!â said the boy. âLet
us go to John Marshallâs.â

ââTis too far, Ned. My sister will surely
take us in at such a time as this. Lord have
mercy! The flames dizzy one so!â

And the poor woman fell against the wall.
Mr. Burke raised her, and bidding Ned go before
to show the way, he half led and half carried her
the short distance to her sisterâs house, the little
ones running barefooted, holding by the skirts
of his coat. On their way, they met a man whom
the children proclaimed with one voice to be
John Marshall.

âI was coming to you,â said he, supporting
the widow Bridgeman on the other side. âThis
is a sad plight I see you in, cousin; but cheer
up! If you can get as far as our place, my wife
bids me say you will be kindly welcome.â

Mr. Burke thought the nearest resting-place
was the best; and Marshall yielded, hoping the
sisterâs door would be open, as it ought. It was
but half open, and in that half stood the sister,

6
Mrs. Bell, arguing with Ned that the place was
too small for her own family, and that his mother
would be more comfortable elsewhere, and so
forth. Mr. Burke cut short the argument by
pushing a way, and depositing his charge upon
the bed within. He then gave his name to the
amazed Mrs. Bell, desired her to lend the children
some clothing, and to keep her sister quiet
till he should come again, sent Marshall for his
wife, who would apparently nurse the widow
Bridgeman better than her own sister, and then
returned with Ned to see if any of the widowâs
little furniture could be saved. Before they
reached the spot, however, the tenement was
burned to the ground, and the two or three next
to it were pulled down to stop the fire, so that
nothing more was to be done.

The widow seemed at first so much revived by
the treatment which Mr. Burke ordered, and her
cousin Marshall administered, that there was
room for hope that the shock would leave her
little worse than it found her; and the benevolent
surgeon went home at six oâclock to refresh
himself, bearing tidings to his sister, not only
that the fire was extinguished, but that it appeared
to have done no irreparable mischief beyond
the destruction of property. He was not
fully aware, however, in how weak a state his
patient had previously been.

âMammy!â said little Ann Bridgeman, who sat
on a low stool, with a blue apron of her auntâs
over her shoulders, her only covering except her
shift, âMammy, there goes the church bell.â

7
âHush!â said Jane, the eldest, who was more
considerate.

âMammy is awake,â persisted Ann, looking
again into the curtainless bed to see that the
widowâs eyes were open. âDo you hear the
bell, mammy? And we cannot go to church.â

ââTis a strange Sunday, indeed, my child,â
replied her mother. âWhen I prayed last night,
after all our work was done, that this might be a
day of rest, I little thought what would happen.â

Her cousin, Mrs. Marshall, came to her and
begged that she would try to rest, and not to
trouble herself with uneasy thoughts.

âMy mind is so tossed about!â replied the
poor woman. âIt distracts me to think what we
are to do next. And there sit the poor children
without so much as a petticoat to wear; and the
room is all as if the fire was roaring about me;
and a letter from my husband, the only one I
ever had, that I thought to have carried to my
grave with me, is burned; and I might as well
have saved it, if I had had a minuteâs thought;
andâââ

The sick woman burst into a hysterical cry
which shook her frame so, that her cousin began
to think how she could calm her. She ventured
on a bold experiment when she found that her patientâs
talk still ran upon the letter, and that the
consolations of Mrs. Bell, who now came to the
bedside, only made the matter worse.

âWell now, I wonder,â said Mrs. Bell, âthat
you should trouble yourself so about a letter, when
you will be sure to remember what is in it. One

8
would think it was a bank note by the way you
cry after it.â

âA bank note!â cried the poor woman.
âI would have set light to my house with a
handful of bank notes, if I had had them, sooner
than lose that letter; and yet nobody would think
so by the way I left it behind me. There it was
in the box with my rent, and with my motherâs
gold thimble, nigh at hand as I got out of bed,
and I might just as well have saved it. O Lord!
what a wretch I am!â she cried. âTake the
children away! Donât let them come near me
any more. Lord forgive me! Lord have mercy
upon me!â and she raved fearfully.

âSheâs out of her senses,â said Mrs. Bell,
âand all for that trumpery letter. Iâll make her
believe we have found it.â

âAnd so make her worse than ever when she
discovers the trick,â said Mrs. Marshall. âNo,
that wonât do.â And she turned to the sick
woman,ââI say, Mary, you would not mind
so much about the letter if you were to see your
husband very soon, would you?â

âSurely no,â replied the widow, looking perplexed,
but immediately calm. âBut my husband
is gone, long ago, is not he? But perhaps
I am going too. Is that what you mean, cousin
Marshall?â

âI donât know whether you be or no, Mary;
but you have no strength for raving as you did
just now. If you wish to live for your childrenâs
sake, you must be quiet.â

âI was thinking a deal about dying last

9
night, and what was to become of the children;
but I forgot all about it to-day. Poor things!
they have no friends but you two,â looking from
Mrs. Bell to her cousin Marshall. âYou will see
to them, I am sure. You will not cast them out
upon the world; and depend upon it, it will be
repaid to you. I will pray God day and night,
just as I would here, to watch over them and
reward those that are kind to them; particularly
whichever of you takes Sally; for I am much
afraid Sally will go blind.â As she gazed
earnestly in the faces of her relations, Mrs. Bell
tried to put her off with bidding her make her
mind easy, and trust in Providence, and hope to
live. Her cousin Marshall did better.

âI will take charge of Sally and of one of
the others,â said she. âI promise it to you;
and you may trust my promise, because my
husband and I have planned it many a time
when we saw what a weakly way you were in.
They shall be brought up like our own children,
and you know how that is.â

âGod bless you for ever, cousin! And as
for the other twoâââ

âLeave that to me,â replied Mrs. Marshall,
who saw that the patientâs countenance began
to resume its unsettled expression. âLeave it
all to me, and trust to my promise.â

âJust one thing more,â said the widow,
starting up as her cousin would have retired.
âDear me! how confused my head is,âand all
because you have moved the bed opposite the
window, which my head never could bear. Listen

10
now. In the cupboard on the left side the bed,âat
least, that is where it was,âyou will find a
japanned box that I keep my rent in. At the
bottom of that box there is a letterâââ

âWell, well, Mary. That will do by-and-by.â

âLet me finish, cousin. Give that letter to
Ned, and bid him keep it, becauseâââ

âAye, I understand. Because it is his fatherâs
writing, and the only one you ever had.â

âWhy, you know all about it!â exclaimed the
widow, smiling, with a look of surprise. âI did
not know I had ever told anybody. Well, now,
I canât keep awake any longer; but be sure you
wake me in time in the morning. I must be up
to wash the childrenâs things, for they want
them sadly.â

She dropped asleep instantly when her cousin
had hung a shawl at the foot of the bed to
hide the strange window. Ned had gone some
minutes before for Mr. Burke, who pronounced,
on seeing her, that she would probably never
wake again. This proved true; and before night
she was no more.

The fire created a great sensation in the city.
The local newspapers described it as the most
awful that had occurred in the place within the
memory of man; and the London prints copied
from them. Strangers came in from the country
to visit the smoking ruins, and the firm to whom
the warehouses belonged were almost overwhelmed
with sympathy and offers of assistance.
Mrs. Bell was disposed to make a profit out of
all this. She would have stationed Ned, in a

11
tattered shirt, on the ruins of his motherâs dwelling
to beg, and have herself carried about a
petition in behalf of the orphan children. The
funeral, at least, ought, she thought, to be paid
for by charity; but there was no moving the
Marshalls on any of these points. They were
so sure that the widow would have died, at all
events, in a very short time, that they could not
see why the fire should throw the expense of her
funeral on the public; and even Mrs. Bell could
not pretend that anything of much value had
been lost in the fire except the rent, which would
never be called for. The Marshalls countenanced
Nedâs dislike to go near the idle boys
who were practising leaping on the ruins, and
found it a far more natural and pleasant thing to
dress the little Bridgemans in some of their own
childrenâs clothes and take them home, than to
appeal to strangers on their behalf.

âYou may do as you please, neighbour,â
cried Mrs. Bell, after an argument upon this
subject. âIf you choose to burden yourselves
with two children in addition to your own five,
it is no concern of mine; only donât expect me
to put any such dead-weight upon my husbandâs
neck.â

âYour husband earns better wages than mine,
Mrs. Bell.â

âAnd that is what makes me wonder at your
folly in not sending the children to the workhouse
at once. No need to tell me what a little way a
manâs wages go in families like yours and mine.â

âYou have a good deal of help in other ways

12
to make out with, indeed, neighbour,â observed
Mrs. Marshall. âYou have found the gentry
very kind to you this year; so much so that I
think the least you can do is to keep these
children from being a burden on the rates, for the
little time till they can shift for themselves.âI
believe you bought neither coals nor blankets
last winter.â

âBless your heart, cousin, the coals we got
did not last half the winter through; for my
husband likes a good fire when he can get it,
and always expected to find one in the grate
when he came home from the Leopard, however
late at night it might be; and I had to sell one
of the blankets presently. The other, on the
bed there, is the only one we have till winter,
when I hope to get a new one, if the ladies are
not too particular about my having had two
already. But, really, it tries oneâs patience to
wait upon them ladies. Do you know I am disappointed
again about the bag of linen against
my confinement. I may be down any day now,
and every bag is engaged, so that they canât
promise with any certainty. So I must just take
my chance for getting through somehow.â

âAnd how is your baby provided?â

âO, they gave me a few trifles for it, which
will do till I get about again, and can carry it to
show how poorly it is off.â

âWell,â said Mrs. Marshall, âI do wonder
you can bear to live from hand to mouth in that
way. You got your first set of baby-linen at the
same time that I did, and with your own money;

13
and why yours should not have lasted as well as
mine, I canât think. Mine are not all worn out
yet, and I always managed to replace, by timely
saving, those that were. However, if you canât
clothe your own children, I donât wonder so
much that you will not feed your sisterâs. Poor
things! must they go to the workhouse?â

âUnless you choose to take them all, cousin.
So wonderful a manager as you are, perhaps you
might contrive it.â

Mrs. Marshall shook her head mournfully.
She had not lodging room for more than two
girls among her own, and could not have
engaged that her husbandâs rent should be ready
if more than two in addition were to share their
daily meals. As it was, they must give up one
dish of meat a week, and make some other
reductions of the same kind.

âBetter ask the gentry to help you, at once,â
said Mrs. Bell; âbut I suppose you are too
proud?â

âWe will try what our own charity can do
before we ask it from those who have less
concern in the matter,â said Mrs. Marshall.
âThere is one thing I mean to ask, however,
because I cannot anyhow get it for them myself;
and that is, to have them taught like my
own children. Poor Sally must learn to knit
while she has some eyesight left.â

âWhich of the others do you mean to take?â
enquired Mrs. Bell, as if quite unconcerned in
the matter.

Mrs. Marshall called in the four children from

14
the next room to consult them, to her cousinâs
utter amazement. She told them the plain truth,âthat
she had promised their mother to take
charge of two of them, and that one of the two
should be Sally; that the other two must live in
the workhouse till they could earn their own subsistence;
and that she wished them to agree
with her which had best remain with her and
Sally. Ned looked at his aunt with tears in his
eyes; to which she answered by promising to
see him sometimes, and to bring him some gingerbread
when she had a penny to spare. Ned,
who was too old to be spoken to in this way,
brushed his sleeve across his eyes, and observed
to cousin Marshall that Jane had better go with
him to the workhouse, because she was the
oldest and would be soonest out of it, and because
Sally liked to have little Ann to do things
for her that she could not see to do herself.
Cousin Marshall was quite of this opinion; and
so the matter was settled.

A long private conversation followed after
Mrs. Bell had left the room; if conversation it
might be called which consisted of sobs and
tears on the part of the children, and exhortations
and pity on that of their friend.

âRemember, Ned,â said she, âthe one thing
you must be always thinking about after you go
into the workhouse is how soon you can get out
again. It is Godâs will that has taken your
mother from you, and that has made your relations
poor, and so we must try and not think
your lot a disgrace; but it will be a disgrace if

15
you stay long. Keep this up in Janeâs mind too,
for I am afraid of her forgetting it, as she is
rather giddy.âI am not sorry, Jane, to see you
cry so much, because I hope it will make you
remember this strange day. I have heard of
workhouse frolics, my dear. Never let me hear
of them from you. You will have a service, I
hope, in a few years, and you must try to make
yourself fit to live with a different sort of people
from those you will find in the workhouse.â

Mrs. Bell, who had come back in time to hear
the last few words, began to tell all she had
heard about the pleasant kind of life people
might lead in a workhouse if they chose; but her
cousin cut her short by bidding the children take
leave at once.

Few events wrung tears from this stout-hearted
woman; but she kept her apron to her eyes the
whole way home, and could not speak to any
body all day.

Chapter II.

AN INTERIOR.

Miss Burke had gone into the country the
morning after the fire, and remained some weeks.
When she returned, she inquired of her brother
what had become of the family who had been

16
burnt out. She was an occasional visitor at the
workhouse school, and besides knew some of
the elderly paupers, and went to see them now
and then. Her visits were made as disagreeable
as possible by the matron, who hated spies, as
she declared, and had good reasons for doing so;
many practices going forward under her management
which would not bear inspection. She was
sometimes politic enough to keep out of sight,
when she was aware that something wrong had
already met the ladyâs eye; but she more frequently
confronted her near the entrance with
such incivility as might, she hoped, drive her
away without having seen anything. The master
was an indolent, easy man, much afraid of
the more disorderly paupers, and yet more of his
wife. He seldom appeared to strangers till called
for; but was then quite disposed to make the
best of everything, and to agree in all opinions
that were offered. There was little more use,
though less inconvenience, in pointing out
abuses and suggesting remedies to him than to
his wife; yet Mr. Burke and his sister conscientiously
persevered in doing this,âthe gentleman
from the lights he obtained in his office of
surgeon to the workhouse infirmary, and the
lady, from her brotherâs reports and her own
observations.

Miss Burkeâs first inquiry at the workhouse
gate was for nurse Rudrum. The porterâs office
consisted merely in opening the gate; so that
when the lady had entered the court, she had to
make further search. The court was half-full of

17
people, yet two women were washing dirty linen
at the pump in the midst. Several men were
seated cutting pegs for the tilers and shoemakers,
and others patching shoes for their fellow-paupers;
while several women stood round with their
knitting, laughing loud; and some of the
younger ones venturing upon a few practical
jokes more coarse than amusing. At a little
distance, sat two young women shelling peas for
a grand corporation dinner that was to take
place the next day, and beside them stood a
little girl whose business was apparently to clean
a spit on which she was leaning, but who was
fully occupied in listening to the conversation
which went on over the pea-basket. This group
looking the least formidable, Miss Burke approached
to make her inquiry. Being unperceived,
the conversation was carried on in the
same loud tone till she came quite near, when
one of the young women exclaimed,

âI donât want to hear any more about it. I
wonder you had the heart to do it.â

âTo do what?â asked Miss Burke. âSomething
that you do not look ashamed of,â she
continued, turning to the first speaker.

âLord, no,â said the girl with a bold stare.
âIt is only that a young mistress of mine, that
died and left a child a week old, bade me see
that it was taken care of till her husband came
back, who was gone abroad; and I could not be
troubled with the little thing, so I took it direct
to the Foundling Hospital; and I heard that the
father came home soon after, and the people at

18
the hospital could not the least tell which was his
child, or whether it was one that had died. I
kept out of the way, for I could not have helped
them, and should only have got abused; for
they say the young man was like one gone mad.â

âAnd was it out of your own head that you
took the child there, or who mentioned the hospital
to you?â

âI knew enough about it myself,â said the
woman with a meaning laugh, âto manage the
thing without asking anybody. It is a fine place,
that Foundling Hospital, as I have good reason
to say.â

âPray find the matron,â said Miss Burke
to the little spit-cleaner, who was listening with
open mouth; âand ask whether Miss Burke
can be admitted to see nurse Rudrum. I think,â
she continued, when the little girl was out of
hearing, âyou might choose your conversation
better in childrenâs company.â

âAnd in other peopleâs company too,â said
the other sheller of peas. âIâve not been used
to such a place as this, and I canât bear it.â

âYouâll soon get used to it, Susan, my love,â
replied the bold one.

âWhere do you come from, Susan, and why
are you here?â inquired Miss Burke.

With many blushes, Susan told that she was a
servant out of place, without friends and with no
one to give her a character, her last master and
mistress having gone off in debt and left her to
be suspected of knowing of their frauds, though
she had been so ignorant of them as not to have

19
attempted to secure her own wages. It was a
hard case, and she did not know how to help
herself; but she would submit to any drudgery
to get out of the workhouse.

âAnd who are you?â said the lady to the
other. âAre you a servant out of place too?â

âYes.â

âAnd without a character?â

âO yes, quite,â said the woman with a laugh.
âIt is well for me that there are some places
where characters donât signify so much as the
parson tells us. Susan and I are on the same
footing here.â

Susan rose in an agony, and by mistake
emptied the shelled peas in her lap among the
husks.

âThere! never mind picking them out again,â
said the other. âIf I take such a trouble, it
shall be for my own supper, when the rest are
done.â

âSo you really think,â said Miss Burke,
âthat you and Susan are on the same footing
because you live under the same roof and sit on
the same seat? I hope Susan will soon find that
you are mistaken.â

At this moment appeared Mrs. Wilkes the
matron, shouting so that all the yard might
hear.

âIs it nurse Rudrum you want? She is out
of her mind and not in a state for prayer. Gentlefolks
are enough to send poor people out of
their minds with praying and preaching.â

20
âI am not going either to pray or preach,â
replied Miss Burke; âand you well know that
it is some years since nurse Rudrum was in her
right mind. I only ask the way to her.â

âYonder lies your way, madam. Only take
care of the other mad people, thatâs all.â

Surprised and vexed to perceive Miss Burke
persevering in her purpose, notwithstanding this
terrifying warning, she continued,

âRemember, if you please, that the doctors
donât allow their patients to be made methodists
of; though God knows how many are sent here
by the methodists. Youâll please to take it all
upon yourself, maâam.â

Miss Burke, not seeing how all this concerned
herself and nurse Rudrum, who were about
equally far from methodism, pursued her way,
as well as she could guess, to the right ward.âShe
could not easily miss it when once within
hearing of nurse Rudrumâs never-ceasing voice,
or the tip tap of her ancient high-heeled shoes,
which she was indulged in wearing, as it was a
fancy not likely to spread. Nurse was employed
as usual, pacing to and fro in the ward appropriated
to the harmless insane, knitting as fast as
her well-practised fingers would go, and talking
about Jupiter.

âMiss Burke, I declare,â cried she, as soon
as her visitor appeared. âYou are welcome, as
you always areâalways very welcome; but,â
and she came nearer and looked very mysterious,
âyou are come from them people at a distance,

21
I doubt. Now donât deny it if you be. If they
have practised upon me, you didnât know it; so
no need to deny it, you know.â

âI am come from Mr. Earleâs, nurse; and
Mr. Earle sent his love to you, and hopes you
will accept some tea and sugar; and the young
ladies will come and see you when they visit me,
and in the meanwhile they have sent you a Sunday
shawl.â

A dozen curtseys, and âMy duty to them,
my duty and many thanks; and I dare say it is
because they are so sorry about them people at
a distance that practise upon my ancle, without
so much as shaking their heads.â

âO, your ancle! I was to ask particularly
how your ancle is. You seem able to walk pretty
briskly.â

âThatâs to disappoint âem, you see,â and she
laughed knowingly. âI only tell
you
, you
know, so youâll be quiet. They canât touch me
anywhere else, because of Jupiter in my cradle.â

âWhat was that, nurse?â

âO that was when they made me a watch-planet;
and a fine thing it was to keep me from
harm,âall except my ancle, you see. It was
Jupiter, you know; and I feel it all over me now
sometimes,âmost in my elbows. It was only
Jupiter; none of the rest of them. That was my
motherâs doing; for Jupiter is the most religious
of all the planets.â

And so she ran on till her visitor interrupted
her with questions about some of her companions
in the ward.

22
âAyeâa queer set for me to be amongst,
aânât they? That poor man! Look at his sash;â
and she giggled while she showed how a poor
idiot was fastened by a leathern belt to a ring in
the wall. âHe spins a good deal as it is; but
if he could walk about, he would do nothing.
He has no more sense than a child, and people
of that sort are always for tramp, tramp, tramping
from morning till night, till it wearies oneâs ears
to hear them.â

And nurse resumed her walk. When she
returned to the same place, she went on,â

âIf these people could be made to hold their
tongues, they would be better company; but you
never heard such a clatter; they
wonât
wonât
hear one
speak. That girl sings to her spinning-wheel
the whole day long, and she has but one tune.
They say I am growing deaf; but Iâm sure I
hear that song for ever, as much when she is not
singing as when she is. But do you think that
I am growing deaf, really now?â

Miss Burke could only say that when people
got to nurseâs age, and so on.

âWell now, âtis only because of Jupiter,âlistening
as a watch-planet should, you know.
You should have heard his music last night;âthat
that I used to sing to the little Earles, when
master Charles was afraid to go to bed alone
because of the ghost-story I told him; and I put
him to bed in Miss Emmaâs room for once, and
nobody knew: so donât tell my mistress, for she
never forgave such a thing.â

Miss Burke smiled and sighed; for this master

23
Charles was now a man of forty, and Mrs.
Earle had been in her grave nearly twenty years.
As the visitor was about to take leave, nurse
laid her hand on the ladyâs arm, drew up her
tight little person to its best advantage, and
gravely said,

âOne thing more, Miss Burke. You will
give me leave to ask why I am detained in this
place, among idiots and dolts that are no companions
for me? This is a poor reward for my
long service, and so you may tell Mr. Earle.â

âWe hoped you had everything comfortable,
nurse. You always seem in good spirits.â

âComfortable! You mean as to tea and
sugar and shawls; but what is that compared
with the company I keep? The Earles donât
know what they miss by what they do. Many a
time I would go and see them, and carry them a
piece of gingerbread, if I was not prevented.â

âWell, nurse, you shall come and see them
at our house by and by. In the meanwhile,âyou
know the boys in the yard are very rude,
and they are too apt to teaze old people. We
think you are more comfortable out of their
way.â

Nurse still looked haughty and dissatisfied.

âBesides,â continued Miss Burke, âwatch-planets
are not common, you know; and who
knows how they might be treated in the world?â

âTrue, true, true,â cried the delighted old
woman. âThere are but two in the world
besides me, and they are at Canterbury, where
my mother lived nurse twenty years. âTis only

24
them that study the stars that bow before watch-planets.
Well! we shall all study the stars up
above, and then will be the time for us watch-planets.â

So saying, nurse Rudrum returned to the track
she had worn in the floor, and Miss Burke heard
the well known pit pat all the way down stairs.

The lady now turned into the school, where
she was equally welcome to mistress and scholars,
especially after an absence of some duration, as
now. The mistress, Mrs. Mott, was not exactly
the person the ladies would have appointed to the
office, if the choice had been left to them; but,
all things considered, the appointment might have
been worse filled. Mrs. Mott, a starched, grim-looking
personage, had kept a dame school in a
village for many years, during which time she
had acquired a very high opinion of herself and
her modes of tuition;âan opinion which she
continued to instil into the guardians of the poor,
by whom she was appointed to her present
office; their choice being also aided by the consideration
that Mrs. Mott must have parish assistance
at all events, and might as well do something
in exchange for it. The ladies who interested
themselves about the children, seeing that
the choice lay between having no school at all
and having Mrs. Mott for a schoolmistress, made
the best of the latter alternative.

When the lady entered, Mrs. Mott was doing
what she rather prided herself upon,âcarrying
on two affairs at once. She was fixing work for
the girls,âplying her needle as fast as possibleâand

25
leading a hymn which the children sang
after her, kneeling on their benches, with their
hands clasped before them, and every little body
rocking from side to side to mark the time.
When it was over, and the children scrambled
down into their seats, a universal grin of pleasure
greeted Miss Burke from her old acquaintance,
and a stare of wonder from the new comers who
yet knew her only by reputation. Mrs. Mott,
meanwhile, went on drawing out her thread most
indefatigably, and murmuring as if under some
emotion.

âGood morning, Mrs. Mott. It is some time
since I saw you last.â

âTime, madam! Aye: time is given, time is
given where all else is given. âTis ours to seize
it ere it flies.â

âHow are your family, Mrs. Mott? I hope
your sons are doing better.â

âSon, madam, son! I suppose you donât
know that the Lord has made choice of Jack?â

Miss Burke was much concerned; and tried
to hear the story notwithstanding a hubbub at
the bottom of the school, which at length roused
the teacherâs wrath.

âTommy bit Jemmy,â was the reply of twenty
little voices to the inquiry of what was the matter.

âTommy is a bad boy and must be punished,â
was the verdict; and the sentence speedily followed.
âWe are going to prayers, and I will
have no disturbance while prayers are going on;
but I will have justice. So, as soon as prayers

26
are over, Jemmy shall bite Tommy in whatever
part he chooses.â

Miss Burke considered how she might best
interfere with the process without setting aside
the mistressâs authority. She waited till prayers
were over, and then called the two boys before her.
She represented to the sobbing culprit the enormity
of biting human flesh, and then asked Jemmy
if he had any urgent desire to bite Tommy.

âI donât want to bite him, unless Iâm bid,â
was the reply.

âVery well; then, suppose you forgive him
instead. This will make him very careful not to
hurt you another time. Will it not, Tommy?â

Tommy agreed, and words instead of wounds
were exchanged.

The next inquiry was for the Bridgemans.
Ned was called out of the ranks of departing
school-boys, and Jane was sent for, being detained
from school this day to help to prepare for
the corporation dinner. On her appearance, she
was recognized as the cleaner of spits, who had
listened so eagerly to the praises of the Foundling
Hospital. Miss Burke told them how she had
heard of their circumstances, and her intention
to visit them from time to time. She asked them
if they were happy.

âYes, maâam,â replied Jane, readily; âa deal
happier than we thought.â

Ned, however, only bit his lip to keep back his
tears. Miss Burke framed her speech to suit both.

âYou know,â she said, âthat we all consider

27
that you are here only for a time, and we trust a
short time. It has pleased God to take from you
your natural protectors and teachers; and children
like you must be taken care of, and taught,
before you can find a way in the world. But, if
you choose, you may soon make yourselves fit
for a better and a happier place than this; and
the more cheerfully you set about it, Ned, the
more quickly you will learn. You, Jane, should
seek out the more sober and quiet young women
to talk to, instead of listening to the foolish
gossip that goes on in the yard. Has Susan
been kind to you?â

âShe always keeps by herself when she can,
maâam.â

âShe will be kind to you, however, I am sure,
if you deserve it; and I believe she can teach you
many things you will like to learn.â

In order to unloose Nedâs tongue, the lady
made several inquiries about their comforts.
They had nothing to complain of but that they
did not like milk-broth, which composed their
dinner twice a week, and that the workhouse
dress was very hot and heavy. The first evil
could not be helpedâthe other seemed very reasonable;
and Miss Burke determined to urge an
objection to it through her brother, as it appeared
that a thick woollen dress was the most
liable to dirt of any that could be fixed upon,
and the most unseemly when worn into holes;
besides this, the children were exposed to colds
from the temptation to throw off the dress when
heated, and from exchanging it for their own

28
old clothes on Sundays and holidays. Jane had,
as her brother declared, been scarcely ever without
colds since she entered the workhouse, as
cousin Marshall had been kind enough to provide
her with a complete suit on her entrance,
which Jane was fond of wearing whenever she
went to church, or to the gardens, orâââ

âTo the gardens! What gardens?â

The public tea-gardens, where the girls and
boys were treated very often on Sundays, sometimes
under guidance, and sometimes without any.
Jane was very eloquent in describing these frolics,
and others which took place within the walls.

Miss Burke had little hope of counteracting
such influences as these by an occasional visit;
but she now said what she thought most likely
to impress the mind of the poor girl, and then
proceeded to find Susan, in order to recommend
Jane to her care. She was glad to see Wilkes,
the master, unaccompanied by his wife, and conversing
with a gentleman whom she knew to be
one of the visitors. Before she reached them,
she perceived that Ned was following her with a
wistful look.

âHave you anything more to say to me?â she
inquired.

âOnly, maâam, that perhaps you may know
when we may get out. I should like to see the
time when we shall get out.â

âI wish I could tell you, my dear boy; but I
can only guess, like you. I guess it will be when
Jane is fit for service, and you for labour in the
fields or elsewhere.â

29
âI can labour now,â said the boy, brightening.
âIf they would try me, I am sure I could dig all
day.â

âBe patient, Ned; and then, if you turn out
a clever workman when the right time comes,
who knows but you may not only keep out of the
workhouse yourself, but prevent somebody else
from coming in?â

Ned smiled, pulled his forelock, and went
away cheered.

Mr. Nugent, the visitor, met Miss Burke with
an observation on the improvement of workhouses
which rendered them accessible to female
benevolence; whereas they were once places
where no lady could set her foot. Miss Burke
gravely replied that there was much yet for benevolence
to do. The necessary evils of a workhouse
were bad enough; and it was afflicting to
see them needlessly aggravated,âto see poverty
and indigence confounded, and blameless and
culpable indigence, temporary distress, and permanent
destitution, all mixed up together, and
placed under the same treatment. These distinctions
were somewhat too nice for the gentlemanâs
perceptions; at least, while announced in abstract
terms. He stood in an attitude of perplexed
attention, while Wilkes asked whether
she would have the paupers live in separate
dwellings.

Miss Burke observed that the evil began out
of the workhouse; and that the want of proper
distinctions there made classification in the
house an imperative duty.

30
âWe are too apt,â she said, âto regard all the
poor alike, and to speak of them as one class,
whether or not they are dependent; that is,
whether they are indigent or only poor. There
must always be poor in every society; that is,
persons who can live by their industry, but have
nothing beforehand. But that there should be
able-bodied indigent, that is, capable persons
who cannot support themselves, is a disgrace to
every society, and ought to be so far regarded
as such as to make us very careful how we confound
the poor and the indigent.â

âI assure you, maâam,â said Wilkes, âit
grieves me very much to see honest working
men, or sober servants out of place, come here
to be mixed up with rogues and vagabonds.â

âBut they are all indigent alike,â observed
Mr. Nugent, âor your honest labourers would
not have to come here.â

âAll indigent, certainly, sir; but not all alike.
We have had cottagers here for a time, after
losing cows and pigs by accident; and even
little farmers after a fire on their premises; and
labourers, when many hundreds were turned off
at once from the public works. Now, this sort
of indigence is very different from that which
springs out of vice.â

âIt seems to me,â said Miss Burke, âthat as
wide a distinction ought to be made between
temporary and lasting indigence, and between
innocent and guilty indigence, within the workhouse,
as between poverty and indigence out of
it; and as the numbers are, I believe, very unequal,

31
I should think it might easily be done. I
suppose, Mr. Wilkes, those who require permanent
support, the invalids and the thoroughly
depraved, are few in comparison with those
who come in and go out again after a time.â

âVery few indeed, maâam. Mr. Nugent
knows that our numbers are for ever varying.
One year we may have seven hundred in the
house, and another year not so much as three
hundred. It seems to me the surest way of
making the industrious into vagabonds, and the
sober into rogues, to mix them all up together;
to say nothing of the corruption to the children.â

âI heard the other day,â said Mr. Nugent,
âthat few of the children who have been brought
up here turn out well. But it canât be helped,
madam. The plan of out-door pay must have
its limits, and our building a new house for the
moral or immoral, is out of the question in the
present state of the funds. The rate has increased
fearfully of late, as your brother will tell
you. I confess I do not see what is to become
of the system altogether, if we go on as we have
been doing for the last five years.â

Miss Burke observed that she was far from
wishing to urge any new expenses. She rather
believed that much money would be saved by
enabling the industrious to pursue their employments
undisturbed, and by keeping the young
and well-disposed out of the contagion of bad
example. She pointed out the case of Susan as
one of great hardship, and that of little Jane
as one of much danger. Wilkes confirmed the
fact of Susan being a good girl, and a well-qualified

32
servant, and told that the other woman
had been discharged from various services for
theft and other crimes.

Mr. Nugent who, in the midst of his talk
about improvement, disliked trouble and innovation,
related that an attempt at classification had
once been made by building a wall across the
yard, to separate the men and women; but that
the wall had been pulled down in a riot of the
paupers, after which it was considered too formidable
an undertaking to rebuild it.

Miss Burke thought, on her way home, that
classification must begin among the guardians of
the poor, before much reformation could be
looked for. The intrepid and active among
the gentlemen, if separated from the fearful
and indolent, might carry the day against the
ill-conducted paupers; but such a result was
scarcely to be hoped while the termagant Mrs.
Wilkes monopolized all authority within the
walls, and the majority of the guardians insisted
on the let-alone plan of policy being pursued;
a plan under which everything was let alone but
the rates, which increased formidably from year
to year.

Chapter III.

TEA AND TALK.

Mr. Burke came in earlier than usual this evening,
the first time since his sisterâs return that he
could enjoy her society in peace. When he arrived

33
wet and chilly from a stormy ride, and found
a little fire, just enough for a rainy summerâs evening,
burning brightly in the grate, the tea apparatus
prepared, his slippers set ready, his study
gown awaiting him, and a pile of new medical
books laid within reach, as if to offer him the
choice of reading or conversation, he wished
within himself that Louisa would leave home no
more till he was married, if that time should ever
come. This wish was pardonable; for he was, to
use his own expression, so accustomed to be
spoiled by his sister that he scarcely knew what
comfort was while she was away.

âAny notes or messages for me, Louisa?â he
inquired, before resigning himself to his domestic
luxuries.

âAlas, yes!â she replied, handing him two
or three from their appointed receptacle.

âThese will all do to-morrow,â he cried; âso
make tea while I change my coat.â A direction
which was gladly obeyed. On his return he
flung the books on a distant table, stretched himself
out with feet on fender, coaxed his dog with
one hand, and stirred his steaming cup with the
other.

âI wish I were a clergyman,â were his first
words.

âTo have parsonage comforts without getting
wet through in earning them, I suppose,â said
Louisa, laughing.

âYou are far from the mark, Louisa.â

Louisa made many guesses, all wrong, about

34
capricious patients, provoking consulting physicians,
unpaid bills, jealous competitors, and
other causes of annoyance.

âNo, no, dear. It is a deeper matter than
any of these. The greatest question now moving
in the world is, âWhat is charity?ââ

âAlas, yes! And who can answer it? Johnson
gave a deficient answer, and Paley a wrong
one; and who can wonder that multitudes make
mistakes after them?â

âA clergyman, Louisa, a wise clergyman who
discerns times and seasons, may set many right;
and God knows how many need it! He will not
follow up a text from Paul with a definition from
Johnson and an exhortation from Paley. He
will not suppose because charity once meant
alms-giving that it means it still; or that a
kind-hearted man must be right in thinking
kindness of heart all-sufficient, whether its manifestation
be injurious or beneficial. He will not
recommend keeping the heart soft by giving
green gooseberries to a griped child,âas he
might fairly do if he carried out Paleyâs principle
to its extent.â

âA professional illustration,â replied Louisa.
âYou want me to carry it on unto the better
charity of giving the child bitter medicine. But,
brother, let the clergyman preach as wisely and
benignantly as he may, why should you envy
him? Cannot you, do not you, preach as
eloquently by example?â

âThat is the very thing,â replied her brother.

35
âI am afraid my example preaches against my
principles.âO, dear, if it was but as easy to
know how to do right as to do it!â

âWhat can have wounded your conscience
to-day?â replied Louisa. âYou are generally
as ready in applying principles as decided in
acting upon them. What can have placed you
in a new position since morning?â

âNothing: but my eyes are more opened to
that in which I already stood; and really,
Louisa, it is a very questionable one. I will
tell you.âI am a medical officer of various
charities which would be good if benevolent
intention and careful management could make
them so, but of the tendency of which I think
very ill. The question is whether I am not doing
more harm than good by officiating at the Dispensary
and Lying-in Hospital, while it is clear
to me that the absence of these charities would
be an absence of evil to society?â

âYou must remember, brother, that your
secession would have no other effect than to put
another medical officer in your place. I am
afraid you are not yet of consequence enough,â
laughing, âto show that these institutions must
stand or fall with you.â

âThat argument of yours, Louisa, has done
long and good service to many a bad cause. I
can allow it no more weight with me than with
a discontented Catholic in good old Lutherâs
days. No; my plea to my own doubts has
hitherto been that my office gave me the opportunity
of promoting my own views both among

36
the benefactors and the poor; but I begin to
think I may do so much more effectually by
resigning my office in those charities which I
consider to be doing harm, openly stating my
reasons, of course.â

âHave you long meditated this, brother?â

âYes, for several months; but a particular
circumstance has roused my attention to-day.
These anniversary times always disgust me,âthese
stated periods for lauding the benevolent and
exhibiting the benefited. I am sure the annual
dinner would be better attended by the subscribers
to the Dispensary, for instance, if the
custom of parading round the room as many of
the patients as could be got hold of were discontinued.
But it is the matter of fact of the
Report, and the way in which it is viewed by the
patrons, that has startled me to-day. I was referred
to, as usual, by the secretary and one or
two more for information respecting certain
classes of patients, and I was shown the Report
which is to be read after dinner to-morrow.
You will scarcely guess what is the principal
topic of congratulation in it.â

âThat Lord Bââ takes the chair to-morrow,
perhaps? Now, do not look angry, but let me
guess again. That the subscriptions have increased?â

âAim in an opposite direction, and you will
hit it.â

âThat the funds are insufficient? Can this
be it?â

âJust so. The number of patients has increased

37
so much, that a further appeal is made
to the public in behalf of this admirable charity,
which has this year relieved just double the
number it relieved ten years ago.â

âI thought,â said Louisa, âthat its primary
recommendation, ten years ago, was that it was
to lessen the amount of sickness among the
poor.â

âTrue,â replied her brother; âand upon this
understanding many subscribed who are now
rejoicing over the numbers of the sick. If the
plague were to visit us, they might see the
matter in its right light. They would scarcely
rejoice that five hundred more were brought to
the pest-house daily.â

âBut how comes the increase?â inquired
Louisa. âI understand it in the case of the
Lying-in Charity, which seems to me the worst
in existence, except perhaps foundling hospitals;
but this is differentâââ

âFrom all other institutions, it is to be
hoped,â interrupted her brother. âIt is dreadful
to see the numbers of poor women disappointed
of a reception at the last moment, and
totally unprovided. The more are admitted, the
more are thus disappointed; and those who are
relieved quit the hospital in a miserable state of
destitution.â

âProbably, brother. What else could be
expected under so direct a bounty on improvidenceâunder
so high a premium on population?
But how do you imagine the number of sick increases
so fast? Are your Dispensary patients

38
in due proportion to the general increase of
numbers in the place?â

âAlas, no! They are much more numerous.
Not only do numbers increase very rapidly; but
from their increasing beyond the means of comfortable
subsistence, the people are subject to a
multitude of diseases arising from hardship alone.
It would make your heart ache if I were to tell
you how large a proportion of my Dispensary
patients are children born puny from the destitution
of their parents, or weakly boys and girls,
stunted by bad nursing, or women who want rest
and warmth more than medicine, or men whom
I can never cure until they are provided with
better food.â

âHow you must wish sometimes that your
surgery was stocked with coals and butcherâs
meat!â

âIf it were, Louisa, the evil would only be
increased, provided this sort of medicine were
given gratis, like my drugs. There is harm
enough done by the poor taking for granted that
they are to be supplied with medicine and advice
gratis all their lives: the evil is increasing every
day by their looking on assistance in child-birth
as their due; and if they learn to expect food
and warmth in like manner, their misery will be
complete.â

âBut what can we do, brother? Distress
exists: no immediate remedy is in the hands of
the poor themselves. What can be done?â

âThese are difficulties, Louisa, which dog the
heels of all bad institutions.âWe must do this.

39
We must make the best of a vast amount of
present misery, thankful that we see at length
the error of having caused it. We must steadily
refuse to increase it, and employ all the energies
of thinking heads and benevolent hearts in preventing
its recurrence, and shortening to the
utmost its duration. Here is ample scope for
all the tenderness of sensibility which moralists
would encourage, and for all the wisdom which
can alone convert that tenderness into true
charity.â

âWhat should be our first step, brother?â

âTo ascertain clearly the problem which we
are to solve. The grand question seems to me
to be thisâ
How to reduce the number of the
indigent?
which includes, of course, the question,
How to prevent the poor becoming indigent?â

âIf this had been the problem originally proposed,
brother, there would have been little indigence
now: but formerly people looked no
further than the immediate relief of distress, and
thought the reality of the misery a sufficient
warrant for alms-giving.â

âAnd what is the consequence, Louisa? Just
this: that the funds raised for the relief of pauperism
in this country exceed threefold the total
revenues of Sweden and Denmark. Aye; our
charitable fund exceeds the whole revenue of
Spain; and yet distress is more prevalent than
ever, and goes on to increase every year. The
failure of British benevolence, vast as it is in
amount, has hitherto been complete; and all for
want of right direction.â

40
âWell, brother, how would you direct it?
How would you set about
lessening the number
of the indigent
?â

âI would aim at two objects: increasing the
fund on which labourers subsist, and proportioning
their numbers to this fund.âFor the first of
these purposes, not only should the usual means
of increasing capital be actively plied, but the
immense amount which is now unproductively
consumed by the indigent should be applied to
purposes of production. This cannot be done
suddenly; but it should be done intrepidly,
steadily, and at a gradually increasing rate.
This would have the effect, at the same time, of
fulfilling the other important object,âthat of
limiting the number of consumers to a due proportion
to the fund on which they subsist.â

âYou would gradually abolish all charitable
institutions thenââO no! not all. There are
some that neither lessen capital nor increase
population. You would let such remain.â

âThere are some which I would extend as
vigorously and perseveringly as possible; viz.
all which have the enlightenment of the people
for their object. Schools should be multiplied
and improved without any other limit than the
number and capabilities of the people.â

âWhat! all schools? Schools where maintenance
is given as well as education?â

âThe maintenance part of the plan should be
dropped, and the instruction remain.â

âBut, brother, if one great evil of gratuitous
assistance is that the poor become dependent

41
upon a false support, does not this apply in the
case of a gratuitous education?â

âThe time will come, I trust, Louisa, when
the poorer classes will provide wholly for themselves
and their families; but at present we must
be content with making them provide what is
essential to existence. To enable them to do
this, they must be educated; and as education is
not essential to existence, we may fairly offer it
gratis till they have learned to consider it indispensable.
Even now, I would have all those pay
something for the education of their children
who can; but let all be educated, whether they
pay or not.â

âThe blind, and the deaf and dumb, I suppose,
among others?â

âYes; and in these cases I would allow of
maintenance also, since the unproductive consumption
of capital in these cases is so small as
to be imperceptible, and such relief does not act
as a premium upon population. A man will
scarcely be in any degree induced to marry by
the prospect of his blind or deaf children being
taken off his hands, as the chances are ten thousand
to one against any of his offspring being
thus infirm. Such relief should be given till
there are none to claim it.â

âI heard the other day, brother, of a marriage
taking place between a blind man and woman in
the asylum at Xââ.â

âIndeed! If anything could make me put
these institutions on my proscribed list, it would
be such a fact as that. The man could play the

42
organ, and the woman knit, and make sash-line,
I suppose?â

âJust so; and they could each do several
other things, but, of course, not those common
offices which are essential to the rearing of a
family. It struck me immediately as a crime
against society. Wellâwhat other charities
should stand?â

âWhatever else I resign, Louisa, I shall
retain my office at the Casualty Hospital. I
hope this kind of relief will be dispensed with in
a future age; but the people are not yet in a
condition to provide against the fractures, wounds
and bruises which befall them in following their
occupations. This institution may rank with
Blind Asylums.â

âAnd what do you think of alms-houses for
the aged?â

âThat they are very bad things. Only consider
the numbers of young people that marry
under the expectation of getting their helpless
parents maintained by the public! There are
cases of peculiar hardship, through deprivation of
natural protection, where the aged should be
taken care of by the public. But the instances
are very rare where old people have no relations;
and it should be as universal a rule that
working men should support their parents, as
that they should support their children. If this
rule were allowed, we might see some revival of
that genial spirit of charity and social duty
among the poor, whose extinction we are apt to
mourn, without reflecting that we ourselves have

43
caused it by the injudicious direction of our own
benevolence.âThis reminds me of the Bridgemans.
Mark how those poor children are disposed
of. Two are taken care of by distant relations
who have never in their lives accepted charity,
except the schooling of their children. A
nearer relation, who has, to my knowledge, uselessly
consumed many a pound of the charitable
fund, sends the other two to the workhouse.â

âA case very appropriate to what you have
been saying, brother. But how is poor Sally?
Can nothing save her sight?â

âNothing, I fear. I have already spoken of
her case to several governors of the Blind Asylum,
where I hope she may be received on the first
vacancy. The Marshalls are too sensible, I am
sure, not to see the advantage of getting her
placed there; and it may be the means of releasing
one of the others from the workhouse.â

Louisa now related her morningâs adventures.
Her brother smiled as he warned her that she
would, no doubt, be pronounced an eccentric
young woman by Mr. Nugent, and declared that
he thought her in the way to be admirably disciplined,
between the railings of Mrs. Wilkes, the
rude wonder of the paupers, and the more refined
speculations of those who had different notions
of charity from herself.

Louisa considered that an important constituent
of charity was its capability of âbearing
all things.â She blushed while she described to
her best friend the little trials she was exposed
to in her attempts to do good. Abuse from

44
beggars she little regarded, as it was the portion
of all who passed along the streets of this ill-regulated
city without giving alms; much harder
things to bear were the astonishment of her
fellow-members of the school committee at her
refusing to sanction large gifts of clothing to the
children; the glances of the visitors of the soup
and blanket charities, when she declined subscribing
and yielding her services; and, above
all, the observations of relatives whom she respected,
and old friends whom she loved, on the
hardness of heart and laxity of principle shown
by those who thought and acted as she did.

âLaxity of principle!â exclaimed her brother.
âThat is a singular charge to bring in such a
case;âas if less vigour of principle was required
to reflect on the wisest, and to adopt unusual,
methods of doing good than to let kindly emotions
run in the ruts of ancient institutions! I
should say that the vigour of principle is on your
side.â

âBetter make no decision about it, brother.
It is not the province of charity to meddle with
motives, whatever its real province may be.âBut
about your medical offices;âit seems to me
that you must resign them, thinking as you do.â

âAnd then what a hard-hearted, brutal fellow
I shall be thought,â said her brother, smiling.

âNo, no: only an oddity. But the speculations
upon you may prove good for the cause
of charity.â

âIt shall be done, Louisa; and that as soon
as we have determined on the best manner. I

45
shall give up the Dispensary and the Lying-in
Charity, and keep the Casualty Hospital. As
for the Workhouse Infirmaryâââ

âAye; I was wondering what you would say
to that.â

âI like it no better, but considerably worse,
than many others; but it stands on a different
footing, inasmuch as it is established by law;
and it seems to me that I must follow other methods
of abolition than that of withdrawing my
services. There is no place of appeal for such
an act, as there is in the case of a voluntary
charity.â

âThere is little enough that is voluntary in
this case, to be sure, brother. Such complaints
about the rate from the payers! Such an assertion
on the part of the poor of their right to a
maintenance by the state! Whence arises this
right?â

âI do not admit it,â replied her brother.
âThose who do admit it, differ respecting its
origin. Some assert the right of every individual
born into any community to a maintenance from
the state; regarding the state and its members
as holding the relation of parent and children.
This seems to me altogether a fallacy;âoriginating
in benevolent feelings, no doubt, but
supported only by a false analogy. The state
cannot control the number of its members, nor
increase, at its will, the subsistence-fund; and,
therefore, if it engaged to support all the members
that might be born to it, it would engage
for more than it might have the power to perform.âOthers,

46
who admit this in the abstract,
plead for the right of the indigent of Great Britain
to a maintenance from the state, on the
ground of the disabilities to which the poor are
peculiarly liable in this country, from the aristocratic
nature of some of our institutions, the oppressive
amount of taxation, and its pressure
upon the lower classes. I admit a claim to relief
here; but the relief should not be given, even
could it be effectual, in the shape of an arbitrary
institution like that of our pauper system. The
only appropriate relief is to be found in the removal
of the grievances complained of; in the
modification of certain of our institutions; in the
lightening, and, yet more, in the equalization of
taxation.âMark what a state we have arrived at
from our mistaken recognition of this
right
to
support! Though the subsistence-fund has increased
at a rapid rate within a hundred years,
through the improvements introduced by art and
civilization, the poor-rate has, in that time, increased
from five or six hundred thousand pounds
a year to upwards of eight millions!â

âSome say,â observed his sister, âthat it is
not the recognition of the right which has caused
the mischief, but the imperfect fulfilment of the
original law. You know better than I whether
this is true.â

âIt is clear,â replied her brother, âthat neither
the letter nor the spirit of the original law
was adhered to; but it is also clear that, in that
law, the state promised more than it could perform.
Did you ever read the famous clause of

47
the famous 43d of Elizabeth? No? There lies
Blackstone. I will show it you.â

âBut first tell me what state the poor were
in when that act was passed.â

âFor the credit of Elizabethâs government, it
is certainly necessary to premise what you inquire
about.âFrom the year 597, that is, from
Pope Gregoryâs time, tithes paid to the clergy
were expressly directed to be divided into four
parts, as Blackstone here tells us, you see; one
part for the bishops, one for the clergyman, incumbent,
or parson; one for repairing and keeping up
the church; and one for the maintenance of the
poor.â

âBut do the clergy pay a fourth part of their
tithes to the poor?â

âO no,â replied her brother, laughing. âThat
troublesome order was got rid of many hundred
years ago; and so was the clause respecting the
share of the bishops; so that tithes became, in a
short time, a very pretty consideration. Well;
though some notice of the poor was occasionally
taken by the legislature, no complaints of their
state made much noise till Henry VIII. suppressed
the monasteries. These monasteries
had supported crowds of idle poor, who were
now turned loose upon the country; and with
them a multitude of vagabond monks, who were
a nuisance to the whole kingdom. It became
necessary to stop the roaming, begging, and
thieving, which went on to the dismay and injury
of all honest people; and for this purpose, the
famous act of Elizabeth was framed. This

48
statute enacts, âThat the churchwardens and
overseers shall take order, from time to time,
(with the consent of two or more justices,) for
setting to work the children of all such whose
parents shall not be thought able to keep and
maintain their children; and also for setting to
work all such persons, married or unmarried,
having no means to maintain them, and using
no ordinary or daily trade to get their living by;
and also to raise, by taxation, &c., a convenient
stock of flax, to set the poor on work; and also
competent sums of money for and towards the
necessary relief of the lame, impotent, old, blind,
and such other among them, being poor and not
able to work.â You see how this is aimed at
vagabonds as well as designed for the impotent.
Many a monkish bosom, no doubt, heaved a sigh
at the mention of âa convenient stock of flaxâ.â

âSurely, brother,â said Louisa, âthe state
promises by this act just what you said no state
could fairly promise, without having the control
of its numbers; it promises to support all its
indigent members.â

âIt does; and it promises another thing
equally impossible of fulfilment. Here is an engagement
to find employment for all who would
not or could not procure it for themselves. Now,
as the employment of labour must depend on the
amount of the subsistence-fund, no law on
earth can enforce the employment of more labour
than that fund can support.â

âThen this promise has not been fulfilled, I
suppose?â

49
âMany attempts have been made to fulfil it,
all of which have had the effect of diverting industry
from its natural channel, and taking the
occupation of the independent labourer out of
his hands to put it into that of the pauper. This
is so ruinous an operation, that the wonder is how
the pauper system has failed to swallow up all
our resources, and make us a nation of paupers.â

âIn which case,â observed Louisa, âthe
state would be found to have engaged to maintain
itself in a pauper condition. What a blunder!
Twenty-four millions of paupers are bound by
law to maintain twenty-four millions of paupers!â

âThis is the condition we shall infallibly be
brought to, Louisa, unless we take speedy means
to stop ourselves. We are rolling down faster
and faster towards the gulf, and two of our
three estates, Lords and Commons, have declared
that we shall soon be in it;âthat in a few
more years the profits of all kind of property
will be absorbed by the increasing rates, and
capital will therefore cease to be invested; land
will be let out of cultivation, manufactures will
be discontinued, commerce will cease, and the
nation become a vast congregation of paupers.â

âDreadful! brother. How can we all go
quietly about our daily business with such a
prospect before us?â

âA large proportion of the nation knows
little about the matter; some hope that fate, or
Providence, or something will interfere to save
us; others think that it is no business of theirs;

50
and those whose business it is are at a loss what
to do.â

âBut how long has there been so much cause
for alarm?â

âOnly within a few years. Thanks to the
ungracious mode of executing the law, it effected
less mischief during a century and a half than
might have been anticipated. When persons
could be relieved only in their own parishes, and
when that relief was given in a manner which
exposed the applicant to a feeling of degradation
among his neighbours, few asked relief who
could by any means subsist without it. Workhouses,
too, were regarded as odious places, and
to the workhouse paupers must go, in those days,
if out of employ; and all who had any sense of
comfort or decency delayed to the very last moment
classing themselves with paupers. So that,
up to 1795, the state was less burdened with pauperism
than, from the bad system it had adopted,
it deserved.â

âWhat makes you fix that precise date?â

âBecause in that year a change took place in
the administration of the poor-laws, which has
altered the state of the country disastrously.
There was a scarcity that season, and consequently
much difficulty with our paupers, among
whom now appeared not only the helpless, but
able-bodied, industrious men, who could no longer
maintain their families. It was most unfortunately
agreed by the county magistrates, first
of Berkshire, and afterwards of other parts of

51
the middle and south of England, that such and
such ought to be and should henceforth be the
weekly income of the labouring poor; and a
table was published exhibiting the proportions of
this income according to the size of families and
the price of bread.â

âBut how could that mend the matter?â exclaimed
Louisa. âThese magistrates and the
public could not increase the quantity of bread,
and where was the use then of giving money?
It was merely taking bread from those who had
earned it, to give it to those who had not.â

âJust so; but these magistrates did not happen
to view the matter as you do; and we have
great cause to rue their short-sightedness.âMark
how the system has worked!âAll labourers
are given to understand that they ought to have
a gallon loaf of wheaten bread weekly for each
member of their families, and one over; that is,
three loaves for two people, and eleven for ten.
John comes and says that his wife and four
children and himself must have seven loaves,
costing twelve shillings; but that he can earn
only nine shillings. As a matter of course, three
shillings are given him from the parish.âNext
comes Will. He has a wife and six children,
and must have nine loaves, or fourteen shillings
and eightpence. He earns ten shillings, and
receives the rest from the parish. Hal is a vagabond
whom no capitalist will admit within his
gates. Work is out of the question; but his
family must be fed, and want eight loaves: so

52
the parish pays him thirteen shillings and eightpence.â

âSo that in fact,â observed Louisa, âeleven
loaves are earned by these three families, and the
twelve still deficient are taken from other earners.
How very unjust! How very ruinous! But
does this kind of management still go on?â

âUniversally in the agricultural counties, with
such slight variations as are introduced by local
circumstances.âGreat allowance must be made
for the pressure of difficulties at the time when
this system was adopted; but the system itself is
execrable, however well-meaning its authors. The
industry of the lower classes has been half ruined
by it, and their sense of independence almost
annihilated. The public burdens have become
well nigh overwhelming; and the proportion of
supply and demand in all the departments of
industry is so deranged that there is no saying
when it can be rectified.â

âIt is rather hard upon the poor,â observed
Louisa, âthat we should complain of their improvidence
when we bribe them to it by promising
subsistence at all events. Paupers will spend and
marry faster than their betters as long as this
system lasts.â

âIt makes one indignant to see it,â replied
her brother. âI am now attending an industrious
young man, a shopkeeper, who has been attached
for years, but will not marry till his circumstances
justify it. He has paid more to the
rates every year; and half a dozen vagabond

53
paupers have married in his parish during the
time that he has been waiting.â

âAll these things, brother, bring us round to
the question, what are we to do?â

âYou must enlighten the children in your
school, and all the poor you have any influence
over, Louisa. As for me,âit is unnecessary to
open my lips upon it to my country patients,
for I seldom enter a farmhouse without hearing
complaints of the system. But our towns are too
quiet about the matter. General, calm, enlightened
deliberation is required, and that without
loss of time.âI am prepared with testimony
respecting the increase of sickness and mortality
which accompanies the augmentation of the
poor-rate. Most happy should I be to have the
opportunity of delivering it.â

âOur wise men,â said Louisa, âmust start
afresh the old question, and the nation must
gather round them to be taught anew, â
What is
Charity?
ââ

Chapter IV.

PAUPER LIFE.

No one could pass the gates of the workhouse
on pay-day without seeing how much misery
existed among the claimants of out-door relief;

54
but few could guess, without following these applicants
to their homes, how much guilt attended,
not only their poverty, but the advancement of
their claims;âguilt which would never have
been dreamed of unless suggested and encouraged
by a system which destroys the natural connexion
between labour and its rewards.

Mrs. Bellâs husband was now out of work,
after having earned and regularly spent twenty-five
shillings a week for many months. His
third child had died after a long illness, and one
which had proved expensive to the parish, from
whence this family now derived four and sixpence
a week. Mrs. Bell, who always went herself to
receive the weekly allowance, lest her husband,
through his dislike of the business, should not
âmanage it cleverly,â took credit to herself for
having given notice that the doctor need not
take any more trouble about her poor boy, as he
was past hope and nothing more could be done
for him; but she omitted to state the reason of
his being past hope, (viz., that he was dead,)
because it would have been inconvenient to give
up the allowance received on his account. So
no doctor came to ask awkward questions, and
the money was a great comfort indeed. Mrs.
Bell had truly managed the whole matter very
âcleverly.â She got another blanket, even out
of due season, because the boy was apt to be cold
at night. The Sick Poor Society allowed her a
certain sum weekly as long as the child lived;
and two or three kind neighbours gave her leave
to call at their houses when they had a wholesome

55
joint for dinner, to carry away a slice and vegetables
for the patient; and if all these desired
her to call on the same day, she managed to
borrow a couple of basins and obey directions;
for though the patient could not eat three dinners
at a time, nor perhaps even one, there were
others in the house who liked savoury meat, and
it was only returning their thanks for the ânourishing
cordialâ in poor Bobâs name. Then
came the lamentations over the impossibility of
burying him decently, and the thanksgivings for
a half-crown here and there for the purpose;
and then hints about any old rag of black, and
the pain to maternal feelings of having no
mourning for so dear a child; and the tears at
sight of the black stuff gown, and the black silk
bonnet, and the black cotton shawl,âall so much
too good for her before they were put into her
hands, but pronounced rusty, rotten old rubbish
when surveyed at home. Then came the commands
to the children to say nothing about Bob
unless they were asked, and the jealousy of that
prying, malicious old widow Pine, who peeped
through her lattice a full hour before she should
properly have awaked, and just in time to see the
coffin carried out of the yard. Lastly came the
subtraction of poor Bobâs parish allowance from
the rest before the money was delivered into her
husbandâs hand. The early waking of widow
Pine, and the use she might make of what she
saw, no mortal could prevent; but all that
devolved upon herself, Mrs. Bell flattered herself
that she had âmanaged very cleverly.â

56
One day when she was going to the workhouse
for her allowance, her husband accompanied her
part of the way. Widow Pine was before them
in the street, stepping feebly along, supported
by a stick in one hand and by the wall on the
other side.

âSheâll trip over the tatters of her gown,â
exclaimed Bell. âPoor old soul! she is not fit
to walk the streets,âbent double, and ready to
be knocked down by the first push. She will
not trouble the parish long.â

âShe will die in the streets,â replied his wife,
âand with bad words in her mouth. She is for
ever prying about peopleâs affairs, and saying
malicious things of her neighbours. The old
hypocrite! she sits see-sawing herself, and drawling
hymns while she combs her grey hair that
never was cut, and all the while pricking up her
ears for scandal.â

âYou and she never had much love to lose,â
replied Bell, obeying his wifeâs motion to cross
the street to avoid passing at the widowâs elbow.
She saw them, however, and sent her well-known
piping after them, striking the pavement with
her stick, to attract the notice of the passers by.

âI wish you joy of your blue gown, Mrs.
Bell! âTis no great thing to lose a child that
comes to life again every parish pay-day!â

âNever mind the old wretch,â said Bell.
âBy the by, I have observed you put off your
black sometimes. What is it for?â

âThe officers are so quick-sighted about a
new gown. They might take off some pay if

57
they knew I had a friend that would give me a
gown; and it really is a rag not worth disputing
about.â

The husband was satisfied, but much annoyed
with the abuse that came from over the way.

âIâll crush you, yet!â railed the old woman.
âI can, and I will, such a pack of knaves and
liars as you are! Youâll soon hear from the
parish, I warrant you! Youâll soon be posted
for cheats!â

âI say, goody, hold your foul tongue, or Iâll
correct you as you little think for,â said Bell.

âYou! what harm can you do me, I wonder?âyou
that are lost, and I a holy person.â

âA holy person! How do you mean holy?â
asked Bell, laughing.

âHow do you mean holy! Why, sure of
heaven, to be sure. Iâm sure of heaven, I tell
you, and you are lost! God has given me nothing
else, for a miserable life Iâve had of it; but he
has given me grace, and is not that enough?â

âYou must keep it close locked up somewhere,
for never a one found out you had it,â
said Mrs. Bell. âI doubt the Talbots that have
been so kind to you have never seen much of
your grace.â

âKind to me! The proud, mean, slandering
folks! You little know the Talbots if you think
they can be generous to anybody. Theyâll meet
you hereafter when I shall be in a better
place!â

âThat is pretty well,â said Bell, âwhen you
have had bed and board, clothes and comfort,

58
from that family from your youth up. Suppose
I tell them what you say, neighbour.â

âAs you please. It is only what I have told
them myself. I shall look to hear you curse
them soon, Mrs. Bell, for they have been told
how you take parish money for your dead child.
So you got a blanket to keep the boy warm?
He is in a hot place now,âa little unregenerate
devil as he was! If he was not to be saved, you
are well off to be rid of him so soon.â

The husband and wife quickened their pace
till they got out of hearing, the one full of disgust,
the other of the fear of detection. She
was anxious to receive her money before the
widow should arrive; but there was already such
a crowd about the gates that she saw she must
wait long for her turn.

Two of the paupers had secured a seat on the
door-step of an opposite house: the one, a well-known
beggar, whose occupation had never been
effectually interfered with by the police; the
other, a young man, who was jeered at as a
stranger by some who weekly resorted to this
place. One gave him joy of his admission to
the pauper brotherhood; another asked how he
liked waiting on the great; a third observed that
he could not judge till he had waited two hours
in the snow of a winterâs noon.

âNever fret yourself for their gibes, Hunt,â
said Childe, the beggar. âYou are more in the
way to do well than you have been this many a
day. You may make what you will of the great,
if you do but know how to set about it.â

59
âIâm glad to hear it,â said Hunt, fidgeting
about in a state of great agitation. âIâm sure the
rich know well enough what to make of us. Not
a word do we ever hear from them about our
right to be kept from starvation; and they expect
us to be wonderfully grateful for a parish dole,
while they cut off a pound of meat a week from
every poor soulâs allowance within yonder walls,
and advise us to mix rye with our wheaten
bread.ââTis true, as Iâm alive! A man told me
so just now as he came out of yonder gate.â

âWell; let us get the pound of meat for our
share, if we can. Iâll bet you a wager, Hunt,
Iâll get a shilling a week more out of them for
this very prank of theirs.â

âDone!â cried Hunt. âI bet you a penny
roll they will be too sharp for you.â

âA penny roll!â exclaimed Childe. âA
pint of wine is the lowest bet I ever lay, man.
A pint of red port to be paid to-night. Come!â

âYou might as well ask me to bet a diamond,â
said Hunt, laughing bitterly. âHow am I to
get port wine?â

âIâll show you when our business here is
done,â said Childe. âYour father was my friend,
or I should not open my confidence so easily.
But just stand a minute at that fat womanâs elbow,
will you? Just to screen me a bit. There;
that will do. Donât look round till I bid you.â

When Hunt had permission to look round, he
scarcely knew his companion. Childe had slipped
off his worsted stocking and bound it over his
forehead and chin, so as to look very sickly.

60
He sprinkled a few grains from his snuff-box
into his eyes, so as to look blear-eyed, and forthwith
set himself to tremble all over, except his
right arm which appeared stiff.

âI have had a slight stroke of palsy this
week, you see,â said he. âI can just get abroad
to show that I must have another shilling a
week.âHang it, Hunt, it is not worth the
trouble for such a trifle, if it was not for the bet!â

Hunt thought a shilling a week no trifle, and
wondered how Childe came by such mighty
notions.

âBecause Iâve an
e
at the end of my name,
man, thatâs all. That little letter makes a great
man of me. It is worth house and board and
tobacco and clothes to me for the whole of my
old age. You think I am mad, I see; but,
harkâee! did you never hear of Childeâs hospital?â

âYes; near London. Is not it?â

âYes; and I have the next turn there, and a
merry life I make of it till I get in, fearing that
the confinement may be rather too close for my
liking. However, it is not a thing to be sneezed
at. The money gathers so fast that âtis thought
we Childes shall have silver spoons by the time
I enter the brotherhood. I like gentility, and I
would give up a little roving for the sake of it.â

âBut how had you the luck to get on the
list?â inquired Hunt. âWho befriended you?â

âLord bless you, how little you know about
such things! âTwas I befriended the trustees,
not they me. They are beholden to me for

61
saving them the trouble of searching further for
a Child with an
e
at the end of his name. None
others will do by the terms of the bequest, which
is for the support of thirteen aged men of the
same name with the pious founder.âA deal of
pride in his piety, I doubt, Hunt.âWell: the
funds have grown and grown, and the trustees
canât use them up any how, though their
dinners and plate and knick-knackeries are the
finest of the fine, Iâm told; and the thirteen aged
men have all they ask for. You should see what
a figure I cut on the list of candidates,âalone
in my glory, as they say;ââhonest industryâââundeserved
povertyâââinfirmities of advancing
years,â and so forth. I wonder they did not
make a soldier or a sailor of me at once,ââto
justify their choice,â as they finish by saying.
Why, man, you look downright envious!â

âI wish any great man of the name of Hunt
had endowed an hospital,â sighed Hunt; âbut
I am afraid there would be too many claimants
to give me a chance.â

âTo be sure. Thereâs not one in ten thousand
meets with such luck as mine. Bless you!
there would be a string of Hunts a mile long, in
such a case.â

And the beggar threw himself back, laughing
heartily; but suddenly stopped, saying,

âMercy! how nearly I had lost my bet!
People in the palsy do not laugh, do they?â

âWhen do you expect to get into this hospital?â
inquired Hunt, who could think of nothing

62
else; âand how do you keep yourself so sleek
meanwhile?â

âI shall depart to that better place when any
one of the old pensioners departs to a better
still,â replied the beggar; âmeanwhile, I grow
fat in the way I will show you presently. Now
for it. It is our turn. Do you keep just behind
me and see how I manage.â

The method was worth watching. Childe won
his way slowly among the groups, preserving his
paralytic appearance wonderfully, and exciting
the compassion of all who took notice of him.

âAnd who may you be, friend?â inquired
the officer, as Childe approached the counter
where the pay was being distributed. âBless
me! Childe! My poor fellow, how you are
altered! You have had a stroke, I am afraid?â

âIf itâs ordained that the grasshopper must
become a burden,â said Childe, mumbling in his
speech, âwe must submit, and be thankful to
have lived so long. But you will not refuse me
another shilling, sir.â

The officer was about to comply, when an
assistant who stood by him remarked that the
applicant looked wonderfully ruddy for a paralytic
man, and that his eyes were as bright as
ever. Hunt, who stood behind, jogged his arm,
from which the stick immediately fell. Childe
appeared to make several ineffectual efforts to pick
it up, and looked imploringly towards the people
behind him, as if complaining that they pressed
upon him. The officer spoke sharply to Hunt,â

63
âPick up the manâs stick, you brute! You
knocked it out of his hand, and you stand staring
as if you liked to see how helpless he is.âYou
observe, John, his right arm is quite useless.
Give him another shilling.â

Hunt wished he had abstained from his practical
hint. Before he could state his case, a
woman got the officerâs ear.âSarah Simpson,
spinster, by name and title. She was a clean,
tight little body, poorly dressed, and sickly in
appearance. She appeared excessively nervous,
her eyes rolling and her head twitching incessantly.
She pleaded for more pay, saying that
she had a note from one of the guardians respecting
it: but for this note her trembling
hands searched in vain, while she was pushed
about by the people who still continued to fill the
room.

âMake haste, good woman,â said the officer.
âWe canât wait on you all day.â

At this moment, the poor creature turned
round and swore a tremendous oath at a man
who had taken upon him to hurry her.

âUpon my word, that is pretty well for a
spinster!â observed the officer. âIf you are not
satisfied with your pay, madam, I would recommend
your going into the workhouse. You
have nobody dependent on you, I believe, and I
should think the workhouse a very proper place
for you.â

âShe has been there already,â said the assistant.
âHer tongue put me in mind of that.

64
The master tells me such oaths were never heard
within the walls as this womanâs.â

âMercy, gentlemen, what did I say?â asked
the poor creature, whose eyes now rolled frightfully.
âI am not myself at times, gentlemen,
when Iâm hurried, gentlemen. I have such aâsuch
aâsuch a strife and strangling here,â
she continued fretfully, tearing open her gown,
and shaking herself like a passionate child.

âWell, well, thatâs enough of your symptoms;
we are not your doctors,â said the
assistant; âtake your money and make way.â

In a hurried manner she closed her gown and
drew back, forgetting her money, which however
Hunt put into her hand.

âOnly two shillings!â exclaimed the poor
creature, returning timidly to the counter. âAânât
I to have what the gentleman recommended,
then, sir?â

âYou are to have no more money, so let us
have no more words,â said the officer. âYou
have your full share already.â

Mrs. Bell, whose period of waiting seemed
coming to an end, advanced to say that Sarah
Simpson was subject to flights at times, when
she did not know what words came out of her
mouth; but that she was a humble, pious Christian
as could be.

âI am afraid your recommendation is not
worth much,â observed the officer. âLet us
see.âYour husband, yourself, and how many
children?â

65
Mrs. Bell, suspecting herself suspected, hesitated
whether to say four or five. She shaped
her answer dubiously,â

âFour and sixpence a week is what we have
had, sir.â

âHow many children?â thundered the
officer.

âFour,â admitted the terrified Mrs. Bell, who
was glad to get away with three and sixpence,
and a rating from the men in authority, accompanied
by sneers and jests from the hearers.
On her way home, she laid the entire blame on
the ill-nature of her neighbours, especially on the
spite of old widow Pine.

Hunt obtained a small allowance, and left the
place, grumbling at its amount and at the prospect
of having to spend it all in wine to pay his
wager. Childe, however, gave him his first
lesson in the mysteries of begging. Under the
pretence of sport, he practised the art for the
first time in a street on the outskirts of the city,
through which many gentlemen passed in their
way home to dinner from their counting-houses.
Hunt was astonished at his own success, and
began to calculate how much alms might be
given away in a year in this single street, if he
and Childe had the begging department all to
themselves. It might be enough, he thought, to
enable them to set up a shop.âWhen the parish
clock struck eight, Childe came to him and said
it was near supper-time. Hunt was glad of it,
for he was very hungry, having had nothing since
morning. Childe begged pardon for the freedom

66
of calling him a fool, but could not conceive
why he had not taken a chop in the middle of the
day, as it was his custom to do: it was sticking
rather too close to the main chance to sit without
food from morning till evening for fear of missing
a monied passenger.

Hunt followed his tutor to a public-house in
the heart of the city, called the Cow and Snuffers.
Hunt had supposed this house too respectable
to be the resort of beggars; but was informed
that the fraternity thought nothing too
good for them when their dayâs business was at
an end, and the time of refreshment was come;
not as it comes to poor artizans in their sordid
homes, but rather to convivial men of wealth.

âStay!â said Childe, as they were about to
enter the house. âHow much can you afford
to spend? Five shillings, I suppose, at the
least.âNever start at such a trifle as that, man!
You will make it up between four and five to-morrow
afternoon.â

Hunt had not intended to beg any more; but
he deferred the consideration of the matter for
the present, and followed Childe to a small room
upstairs, furnished with washing apparatus, and
with a wardrobe well stocked with respectable
clothing. Three or four persons were already
in this room dressing, their beggar apparel
being thrown into a corner, and looking-glass,
brushes, and towels, being all in requisition.
Hunt was declared, after a brushing, to be presentable
without a change of apparel, especially
as he was a stranger. Childe was about to open

67
a door on the same floor, when a waiter stopped
his hand and intimated that they must mount
higher, as the room in question was occupied by
the monthly meeting of the Benefit Club. The
cloth was laid upstairs, and it was hoped the
apartment might be found quite as comfortable.

On the question being put to the vote among
the beggars already assembled, it was pronounced
an intolerable nuisance to be turned out of their
apartment regularly once a month by these
shabby fellows, who were always thinking how
they should save money instead of spending it.
The landlord was rung for, and requested to intimate
to the workpeople that a large convivial
party desired to change rooms with them. The
landlord objected that the apartment had been
positively engaged from the beginning by the
club, and he could not think of turning them
out. Being assailed, however, by various questions,âhow
he could bring the two companies
into comparison?âwhether he could honestly declare
that the custom of the club was worth
more than a few shillings in the year?âand,
lastly, how he would like to lose the patronage
of the beggarsâ company?âhe consented to carry
a messageâthe answer to which was a civil refusal
to budge. Message after message was
sent in vain. The club, having ascertained that
there were unoccupied rooms in the house which
would suit the purpose of the other party as well,
very properly chose to keep the landlord to his
engagement.

âItâs monstrous, upon my soul!â cried a lady

68
beggar, making her entrÃ©e with a curtsey, which
she had first practised on the boards of a barn,
when personating Juliet,ââit is really monstrous
to be poked into an attic in this way;âand
to miss the view of the cathedral, too, which
is so attractive to strangers!â

The appearance of this lady suggested a last
appeal.

âTell them,â said Childe, âthat thereâs a
lady in the case,âa lady who is partial to the
view of the cathedral.â

The club sent their compliments, and would
be happy to accommodate the lady with a seat
among them, whence she might view the cathedral
at leisure, while they settled their accounts.

The club were pronounced ill-mannered
wretches, and the representations of the landlord
about the probable overroasting of the geese,
were listened to. Supper was ordered. Roast
goose top and bottom;âan informality for
which apology was made to Hunt, on the ground
that the company liked nothing so well as goose
in the prime of the pea-season;âabundance of
pease; delicate lamb chops and asparagus, and
so forth. Hunt had never before beheld such a
feast.

âIt will be long enough,â observed a junior
member, âbefore those shabby fellows below
treat themselves with such a set-out as this. I
never liked their doings when I was an operative:
I was one of the other sort.â

âWhat other sort?â

69
âOne of the good livers, and not one of the
frugal. I and some friends of mine used to sup
something in this fashion when we earned near
three guineas a week. We used to get our fowls
from London.â

âBravo! and what made you leave off trade?â

âI was turned off in bad times, and I shall
tell you no more; for I hate to think of that
winter of cold and water-gruel. My nose was
positively frost-bitten, and my stomach like a
wet bladder most part of the twenty-four hours.
Pah! it was horrid.â

âYou would have exchanged conditions with
one of the frugal at that time, probably.â

âWhy, I did envy one his bit of fire, and
another his mess of broth; and the next winter
I may envy them again, for I hear the magistrates
have got scent of me; but no more of that
now.âMiss Molly, your very good health!
May I ask what you have done with your seven
small children?â

âLeft some of them on the bridge, and the
rest in the Butcherâs-row, with directions where
to find me when the halfpence grow too heavy
for them. I hope it is going to rain so that
they will get little; for I donât want to be bored
with the brats any more to-night.â

âThey must be quite too much for you sometimes.â

âHang it! they are. It is all I can do to
remember their parentage, in case of its being
convenient to return them. Two of them are
getting to a troublesome age now,âso impertinent!

70
I must really get rid of them, and borrow
another baby or two.â

âGentlemen,â said Childe, when the cloth
was drawn and the door closed behind the waiter,
âwe have long wanted a general-officer in our
company, and I flatter myself I have found one
who will fill the department excellently, if he can
be induced to join us. Hunt, what say you?
Will you be one of us?â

Hunt wished to know what would be expected
of him.

âThe fact is,â said Childe, âI took a hint
during my travels last year, which is too good
to be let drop. General Yââ, whom, as a boy,
I used to see reviewing the troops, gamed and
drank himself down into pauperism, and I met him
last year walking the streets, not begging, but
taking a vast deal of money; for it was whispered
who he was, and everybody gave him
something. âTis a case of the first water, you
see, and it is a pity not to profit by it. You will
find your part very easy. You have only to let
your beard grow a little, and walk barefoot and
bareheaded, buttoning your coat up to your chin
in the way of military men, and as if to hide the
want of a shirt. You must look straight before
you as if you saw nobody, and keep your left
hand in your bosom and your right by your side.
You will find many a shilling put into it, I expect,
and very little copper.âIf you think it as
well to vary the story, we can make you an admiral,
with some resemblance to a pig-tail; but

71
you are hardly round-shouldered enough for a
seaman, and there is something in the upright
military walk that catches the eye better.â

Hunt had some scruples of conscience, which
were discovered and combated with wonderful
address by his tutor. The argument which
proved finally successful was, that if he believed
he had a right to comfortable support, and could
not obtain it either by work, or by allowance
from the public fund, he must get it in any way
he could.âNobody inquired whether this permission
was to extend to thieving, in case the
gentry should take it into their heads to leave
off giving alms; nor did any one trouble himself
to consider where, short of murder, the line
was to be drawn in the prosecution of this supposed
right. Hunt had some confused notion that
the act of
begging
is inconsistent with a claim
of
right
: if he changed his petition into a demand,
the act became one of highway robbery;
between which and petty larceny and burglary,
there are only degrees of the same guilt: there
must be some flaw in this reasoning, since the
gallows stood at the end of it. It might have
been proved to him that, if he had the supposed
right to support, he was now about to urge it in
the wrong quarter; and that, therefore, no species
of begging is defensible on this very common
plea. It might also have been proved that the
right itself is purely imaginary; but he was now
in a company whence it was most convenient to
banish all questions of right except those involved

72
in the settlement of bets, and of precedence
in taking the chair.

There was much laughter at the sober folks
below; the murmur of whose business-like voices
rose occasionally during a pause, and who were
heard descending the stairs before the clock
struck ten. The waiter just then came up with
a fresh supply of gin, Miss Molly having an inclination
for another glass.

âHow much do those people spend each
time, pray?â

âTwopence a-piece, and a shilling over.â

In reply to the mirth which followed, Childe
pointed out that the very object of their meeting
was the promotion of frugality; and that his
only wonder therefore was, that they did not
meet somewhere where they need spend nothing
at all.

The waiter, who had looked grave during the
laugh, now observed that the members of the
club drank so little because they had something
better to do. They read the newspapers, and
took an important part in elections, and had the
satisfaction of helping one another in many
ways. He could speak to the satisfaction of
being a member of one of these clubs, and the
pride he felt in it. There was no occasion to
fear any magistrate or constable living, or to
have anything to do with the parish; and they
were, moreover, prepared so as to be at no manâs
mercy in times of trouble and sickness; and
when they were past work, there was a fund to

73
go to, over which they held a right; and this, in
his opinion, was worth more than jollity with
want in prospect. The man was ordered away,
and threatened with being thrown out of the
window for his impertinence, and a riotous
chorus was struck up on his disappearance; but
there were, possibly, others besides Hunt, who
sighed at his words, before they began to sing
in praise of gin and revelry.

Chapter V.

COUSIN MARSHALLâS CHARITIES.

Marshall was a member of the benefit club
which met at the Cow and Snuffers. He had
followed his fatherâs advice and example by enrolling
his name in it while yet a very young
man; and he was now every day farther from
repenting that he had thus invested the earnings
of his youth. His companions, who knew him
to be what is commonly called âa poor creature,â
smiled, and said that his club served him instead
of a set of wits. He was not a man whose
talents could have kept him afloat in bad times,
and his club served admirably for a cork-jacket.
His wife, who never seemed to have found out
how much cleverer she was than her husband,
put the matter in a somewhat different light.

74
She attributed to her husband all the respectability
they were enabled to maintain, and which
concealed from the knowledge of many that
Marshall earned but moderate wages from being
a slow and dull, though steady workman. She
gave him the credit, not only of the regularity of
their little household, (which was, indeed, much
promoted by the sobriety of his habits,) but of
the many kindnesses which they rendered to their
neighbours,âfrom sending in a fresh egg
to an invalid next door, to taking home two
orphans to be maintained. If it had not been
for her husbandâs way of storing his earnings,
as cousin Marshall truly observed, these offices
of goodwill would have been out of the question;
and this observation, made now and then at the
close of a hard dayâs work, when Sally was trying
to knit beside him, dropping, unperceived,
as many stitches, poor girl! as she knitted, and
when little Ann was at play among his own
children before the door, made the slow smile
break over his grave face, and constituted him a
happy man.

Sallyâs eyes grew daily worse. Mrs. Marshall
had long suspected, but could never make sure
of the fact, that she injured them much by crying.
As often as Sally had reason to suppose she was
watched, she was ready with the complaint âmy
eyes always water so;â and how many of these
tears came from disease, and how many from
grief, it was difficult to make out. She was
seldom merry, now and then a little fretful, but
generally quiet and grave. Her great pleasures

75
were to sit beside cousin Marshall, on the rare
occasions when she could turn out all the little
ones to play, and mend clothes of an afternoon;
or to forget how old she was growing, and be
taken on John Marshallâs knee, and rest her
aching forehead on his shoulder when he had an
evening hour to spare. From the one she heard
many stories of her mother as a girl no bigger
than herself; and from the other, tidings of Ned
and Jane, when, as often happened, John had
been to see them. Mrs. Marshall now began to
intersperse frequent notices of the Blind Asylum
in her talk, trying to excite poor Sallyâs interest
in the customs, employments, and advantages of
the place; and she gave her husband a private
hint to do the same, in order to familiarise the
girl with the thought of the place she must
shortly go to. John obeyed the hint; but he
did it awkwardly. Whatever was the subject
now started in his presence, it always ended in
praises of the Blind Asylum, and declarations
how much he should like to go there if it should
please the Almighty to take away his eyesight.
Sally was not long in fathoming the intention
of this. At first she pressed down her forehead
closer when John said âa-hemâ on approaching
the subject; but soon she slid from his knee, and
went away at the first sign.

âI think, John,â said his wife, one evening
when this happened, âpoor Sally has heard
enough for the present about this Asylum. It
pains her sadly, I am afraid; but the time must
be at hand, for she is very nearly blind now;

76
and as to a vacancy, some of the people are very
old.â

âI was going to say, wife, one of them is
dead, and Sally can be got in on Saturday, as
Mr. Burke bids me tell you. I met him to-day,
and that was his message.â

Cousin Marshallâs thoughts were at once painfully
divided, between satisfaction at having Sally
thus comfortably provided for, and the sorrow of
parting with her; between the doubt how her
clothes were to be got ready, and the dread of
telling the girl what was to come to pass. She
decided on sending her to bed in the first place,
in order to hold a consultation in peace; so she
went in search of her, led her up herself to the
little nook which had been partitioned off for her
as an invalid, helped her to bed, instead of letting
Ann do it, swallowed her tears while hearing the
simple prayer she had taught her, kissed her,
and bade her good night.

âCousin Marshall,â said the little girl, after
listening a minute, âwhat are you doing at the
window?â

âHanging up an apron, my dear, to keep the
morning sun off your face.â

âO, donât do that! I donât see much of the
light now, and I like to feel the sun and know
when it shines in.â

âJust as you like. But what are you folding
your clothes under your head for? You shall
have a pillow. O yes; I have a pillowâIâll
bring it.â

Sally nestled her head down upon it as if for

77
comfortable repose, while her cousin went down
to meditate on her concerns. It was settled between
the husband and wife, that either Ned or
Jane should be immediately taken home in
Sallyâs place, and that circumstances at the
workhouse should determine which it should be.

Mrs. Marshall was wont to sleep as soundly
as her toil and wholesome state of mind and conscience
deserved; but this night she was disturbed
by thoughts of the disclosure she must
make in the morning. She scarcely closed her
eyes while it was dark, and after it began to
dawn, lay broad awake, watching the pink clouds
that sailed past her little lattice, and planning how
the washing, ironing, and preparing of Sallyâs few
clothes was to be done, in addition to the dayâs
business. Presently she thought she heard the
noise of somebody stirring behind the little partition.
She sat up and looked about her, thinking
it might be one of the many children in
the room; but they were all sound asleep in
their wonted and divers postures. After repeated
listenings, she softly rose to go and see
what could ail Sally. She found her at the window;
not, alas! watching the sunriseâfor no
sunrise should Sally ever more seeâbut drying
her pillow in its first rays. The moment she
perceived she was observed, she tossed the pillow
into bed again, and scrambled after it; but
it was too late to avoid explanation.

âIt grieves me to chide you, my dear,â said
cousin Marshall; âbut how should your eyes
get better, if you take no more care of them?

78
Here is your pillow wet through, wetter than it
could have been if you had not been crying all
night, and you are looking up at the flaring sky,
instead of shutting your poor eyes in sleep.â

âIf I sleep ever so sound, cousin, I always
wake when the sun rises, and I try sometimes
how much I can see of him. It was scarce a
blink to-day; so you need not fear its making
my eyes ache any more. They never will be
tried with bright light again! It is little more
than a month since I could see yon tiled roof
glistening at sunrise, and now I canât.â

âThat is no rule, my dear; the sun has
moved somewhat, so that we canât see it strike
straight upon it. That tiled roof looks blue to
me now, and dull.â

âDoes it indeed?â cried Sally, starting up.
âHowever, that is no matter, cousin; for my
eyes are certainly very bad, and soon I shall
not be able to do anything.â

âO, but I hope you will soon be able to do
more than ever I have been able to teach you.
If you have not me beside you to take up stitches
in your knitting, you will learn not to let them
drop; and that is far better. And you will make
sashline, and the more delicate sort of baskets;
and you are better off than most at their first
going into the Asylum, in having learned to wash
a floor neatly, and to join your squares by the
feel, almost as well as we that can see. Miss
Burke could scarcely believe you were Sally, the
first day she came, you were washing the floor
so nicely.â

79
Sally would have smiled at the compliment, but
that she was too full of panic about the Asylum.

âBut, cousin,â she said, âit will be all so strange!
I donât know any of the people, and I shall have
no one to talk to. And that brown stuff dress,
and little black bonnet, and the white handkerchiefs,
all alike! I donât like to wear a charity
dress. I rememberâââ

Before Sally could relate what it was that she
remembered, her cousin stopped her with a gentle
rebuke. She did not mind what Sally said
about the place and the people being strange;
it was natural, and it was an evil soon cured, and
she hoped there would be less to teaze the girl
in the Asylum, than among the rough children at
home; but she could not see what reason there
was for so much pride as should disdain to wear
a charity dress. Sally explained that it was not
pride exactly; but she remembered how she and
her sisters used to stare at the pupils of the Blind
Asylum, as they met them going to church, and
how she got out of the way in a great hurry, and
followed them to see how they would manage to
turn in at the gate; and sometimes when the
master was not observing, she would look quite
under their bonnets, without their finding it out,
to see what their countenances were like. She
should not like now to have anybody do the same
to her. It was in vain that her cousin reasoned,
that if she did not know it, it would not signify.
The bare idea made her cry again as if she could
not be comforted.

âYou did not think at those times, Sally, of

80
doing as you would be done by. If anybody
had told you then that you would be one of
those pupils, you would have left off following
them. But it seems to me that blind people remember
as soon as anybody to do as they would
be done by; and so I hope you will find. I
have often been in that Asylum, and it cheers one
to see how cheerful the people are. âIt is Godâs
will,â they say, when one asks them about their
blindness. They are always ready with the
word, âIt is Godâs will.â And it is not the word
only, for they make the best of His will. If they
make any little mistake, or do any little mischief
unawares, they are thankful to be set right, and
seem to forget it directly. But I hope you need
not go there, Sally, to learn to say, cheerfully,
âIt is Godâs will.ââ

Sally tried to stop her tears.

âAnd as for doing as you would be done by,â
continued cousin Marshall, ânow is your time.
You have always found my husband tender to
you, have not you?âand little Ann ready to
guide and help you? Well, you donât know the
concern John would feel, if he saw you leave us
unwillingly, and I am afraid we could scarcely
pacify Ann; but if you go with a steady heart
and a cheerful face, they will see at once what a
fine thing it is for you to be got into such a place.
Just think now, if it was Ann instead of you,
how would it make you most easy to see her?â

âO, cousin Marshall, I will try. Manyâs the
time I have been glad it was not Ann. But
whenâwhen?â

81
Her cousin told her directly, that she was to
go in the next day but one, so that she would
soon be settled now, and find her lot come easy
to her. After talking a while longer with her
so as to leave her quite composed, and bidding
her go to sleep, as it was far too early to get up
yet, she left her, and set quietly about her business,
keeping on the watch to prevent husband
and children making any noise in dressing, that
Sally might sleep, if possible, into the middle of
the day. One object in beginning her toil so
early, was to have time to go to the workhouse,
in the afternoon, with the news of the release of
one of the children there.

On entering the workhouse, she heard more
news than she came to tell. A service had
been obtained for Jane at farmer Daleâs, a little
way in the country, whither she was to be removed
next market-day. Immediately on the
announcement of the plan, Ned had disappeared,
and had not been heard of since.

Jane seemed to regard this event but little, so
occupied was she with making up her mind
whether on the whole she liked the change or not.
It was a fine thing, she supposed, to be out of
the workhouse; but there would be an end of
workhouse frolics, and perhaps harder toil than
she had been accustomed to. On cousin Marshallâs
inquiry, whether she had not earned a
little money to carry away in her pocket, she replied
that she had been obliged to spend it as fast
as earned. How? Chiefly in buying a dinner
every Monday when she could; for she could

82
never abide milk-broth; and the rest went for a
better bonnet for Sundays, the one she brought
with her being too shabby to wear at church and
the gardens.

âChurch and the gardens!â exclaimed cousin
Marshall, very sternly. âIt is mostly vain and
dainty girls like you, Jane, that come to learn
how welcome milk is to an empty stomach, and
that are kept away from church, to say nothing
of the gardens, for want of decent covering. It
is a great misfortune, Jane, to be a parish girl,
but it is a far greater to forget that you are one.â

There was much matter of concern for John
when he returned from work this night, in speculating
upon where poor Ned could be, and upon
what would become of Jane, with her very handsome
face, her bold manner, and her vain and
giddy mind. The good couple hoped she was
going to a hard service, where she would be out
of the way of temptation.

Chapter VI.

PARISH CHARITIES.

John Marshall ran no great risk in offering to
take his oath that poor Ned was after no harm.
He was the last person in the world likely to
plan mischief, or to wish to be idle with impunity.
The fact was that he had long been uneasy on

83
Janeâs account, seeing that she was not steady
enough to take care of herself; and the idea of
being separated from her, added to the disgust of
his pauper situation, which he had been bred up to
detest, was too much for him. He had absconded
with the intention of finding work, if
possible, in or near Titford, the village where
farmer Dale lived. For the sake of leaving his
pauper dress behind him, he chose Sunday for
the day of departure, and stole away from church
in the afternoon. He had but threepence in his
pocket, one penny of which went for bread that
night, when he had walked two-thirds of the distance,
and found a place of rest under a stack.
Another penny was spent in like manner at the
bakerâs shop at Titford, on his arrival there at
ten on the Monday morning. He found a
stream at which to refresh himself; and then,
trying how stout-hearted he could make himself,
inquired the way to farmer Daleâs, peeped through
the farm-yard gate, and seeing a woman feeding
the fowls, went in, and asked for work.

âWe have nothing to spare for strangers,â
said she. âWe must give more than we can
afford to our own people.â

âI ask no charity,â said Ned. âI ask for
work.â

âWhere do you come from?â

âFrom a distance. No matter where.â

The woman, who proved to be Mrs. Dale,
was afraid he had run away from his parents and
was a naughty boy. Ned explained that he was
an orphan, and only desired that it should be

84
proved whether he was naughty or not, by
setting him to work, and trying whether he did
not labour hard and honestly. Had he any
money? He produced his penny. How did he
get it? He earned it. Why not earn more in
the same way? It was impossible. What could
he do? He thought he could do whatever boys
of his age could generally do. How would he
manage if he could not get work here? He
would walk on till he found some. Begging by
the way, Mrs. Dale supposed. No, he never
begged. Where did he sleep last night? Under
a stack. Further back than this it was
impossible to gather any information of his proceedings.
Mrs. Dale went in search of her husband,
to plead for the boy,âa thing which she
would not have done, unless she had been particularly
interested in the lad; for farmer Dale had
grown sadly harsh of late about beggars and idle
people. He proved so on this occasion; for
instead of hearing what Ned had to say, he made
signs to him over the fence to be gone, and when
the poor lad lingered, shook his fist at him in a
way so threatening, as to show that there was no
hope.

Ned went to two more places with no better
success. One large establishment remained to
be tried; and, disheartened as he was, Ned
determined to apply; though it was hardly to be
expected that the master of such a place would take
up with such a labourer as he. He resolved to
make his application to no one but the master
himself, and sat down to wait patiently for a

85
good opportunity, which occurred when the gentleman
came home to dinner, and his wife met
him at the gate of the flower-garden. Ned followed,
and respectfully urged his petition. Long
and close was the examination he underwent,
before the gentleman, equally struck with his
reserve on some points and his openness on
others, resolved to give him a trial. Ned was
well satisfied with the offer of twopence that
night, and of fourpence a day afterwards, as
long as he should pick up stones and do inferior
work of other kinds to the satisfaction of his
employers. Mr. Effingham, for that was the
gentlemanâs name, would not allow him to spend
his third penny for his dinner; but ordered him
a slice of bread and meat from the kitchen;
after eating which, Ned set to work with a
grave face and a lightened heart.

On receiving his twopence, he was asked
where he meant to lodge. He did not know;
but if there was any empty barn or shed where
he might lay down a little straw, he would take
it as a favour to be allowed to sleep there till he
should have saved a few pence to pay for a
lodging. He was taken at his word, and for a
month slept soundly in the corner of an old barn,
his only disturbance being the rats, three or four
of which were frequently staring him full in the
face when he woke in the morning.

After a few days, he began to linger about
farmer Daleâs premises, at leisure times, in hopes
of ascertaining whether Jane had arrived, but

86
could see nothing of her, and did not choose to
inquire, knowing that after once having met her
they could frequently exchange a few words
without incurring the danger to himself in which
he might be placed by asking for her. He was
beginning to fear that the plan might be changed,
and that Jane was not coming at all, when he
heard tidings of her in a way that he little expected.

He was working in the field one day, when the
bailiff approached, accompanied by farmer Dale.
They were discussing the very common subject
among farmers of the inconveniences of pauper
labour.

âDonât you find these parish children a
terrible plague?â inquired Dale. âThey are
the idlest, most impudent people I ever had to
do with.â

âIt is just the same with us,â replied the
bailiff, âthe men being quite as bad as the boys,
or worse. How should it be otherwise when
they do not work for themselves? One may see
the difference by comparing this boy here with
his neighbours. Ned is a hard-working lad as
can be, and gives no trouble.â

Ned turned round on hearing this and made
his bow. He smiled when the bailiff went on
to say,

âHe is not a parish boy, but was taken on
against my wish because he wanted a living, and
work, work, was all his cry. It was very well
he came, for we find it does not always follow

87
that a great many labourers do a great deal of
work. This lad does nearly as much as two
parish boys, as I told them the other day; and
I am sorry I did, as I fear it has made them
plague him instead of mending themselves.â

âI cannot see,â said Dale, âwhat is to become
of us farmers if these infernal rates are to
go on swallowing up our substance, and putting
us at the mercy of our own labourers. There is
a piece of land of mine up yonder that I might
make a pretty thing of; and I cannot touch it,
because the tithe and the poor-rate together
would just swallow up the whole profit.â

âWhat a waste it is,â rejoined the bailiff,
âwhen a subsistence is wanted for so many!â

âAnd then I donât know that we gain anything
by employing paupers and paying their
wages out of the rates; for they just please
themselves about working, and when they are
paid, say to my face, âNo thanks: for you must
pay us for doing nothing, if you did not for
doing something.â I had words like that thrown
in my teeth this very morning by a parish girl
we have taken, and who seems to have learned
her lesson wonderfully for the time she has been
with us. Says she to my wife, âWhat care I
whether I stay or go? The parish is bound to
find me.â It will be something more of a punishment
soon, perhaps, to be sent away, for she
seems to like keeping company with the farm-servants
very well;âa flirting jade! with a face
that is like to be the ruin of her.â

Ned felt too sure that this must be Jane.

88
âI would pack her off before worse came of
it,â said the bailiff.

âI shall try her a little longer,â said Dale:
âthere is no knowing whether one would change
for the better. In my fatherâs time, or at least
in my grandfatherâs, a man might have his
choice among independent labourers that had
some regard to character, and looked to what
they earned; but now the case is quite changed,
except in the neighbourhood of flourishing large
farms where the poor-rate is a very trifling concern.
One may look round in vain for the
cottagers one used to meet at every turn: they
have mostly flocked to the towns, and are sent out
to us again as pauper-labourers. There are
more labourers than ever; more by far than we
want; but they are labourers of a different and a
much lower class.â

âAnd the reason is evident enough,â replied
the bailiff. âProprietors have suffered so much
from the burden that is brought upon the land
by cottagersâ families, that they let no cottages
be built that are not absolutely necessary. In
towns, the burden is a very different thing, as
land is divided into such small portions, and the
houses built upon it let so high that the increase
of the rate does not balance the advantage; to
say nothing of its being divided among so many.
The consequence is that the overflow from the
villages goes into the towns, and the people
come out into the country for work. If it were
not for the poor-rate, we should see in every
parish many a rood tilled that now lies waste,

89
and many a row of cottages tenanted by those
who now help to breed corruption in towns.â

âAnd then,â said Dale, âwe might be free
from the promises and cheats of overseers. God
keep me from being uncharitable! but, upon my
soul, I am sick of having to do with overseers.
One undertakes to farm the poor; and then it
would make any heart ache to see how they are
treated, while he pockets every penny that can
be saved out of their accommodation. Another
begins making himself popular with pretending
to reduce the rate; and then, the most respectable
of the paupers pine at home without relief,
while we are beset with beggars at every turn.
The worst of all is such a man as our present
overseer, who comes to taunt one with every increase
of the rate, and to give hints how little
scruple he should have in distraining for it. And
this is the pass we shall all come to soon, unless
I am much mistaken.â

âAs for beggars,â replied the bailiff, âone
would wonder where they come from. They
swarm from all quarters like flies on the first
summer day.â

âOne may see what brings them,â said Dale,
with a bitter laugh. âThe flies come in swarms
when there is a honey-pot near; and the
beggars are brought by your masterâs charity
purse. I reckon, from what I have seen here,
that every blanket given away brings two naked
people, and every bushel of coals a family that
wants to be warmed.â

The bailiff, instead of defending his master,

90
laughed significantly, and led the way onwards,
leaving Ned to meditate with a heavy heart on
as much as he understood of what they had been
saying.

Chapter VII.

WHAT COMES OF PARISH CHARITIES.

It was not long before Ned accomplished an
interview with his giddy sister, and bitterly was
he disappointed at her appearing not altogether
glad to see him. Each time that they conversed,
she seemed more constrained, and insisted further
on the danger of his being discovered and incurring
the displeasure of the superiors of the workhouse.
Ned would listen to no hints about
going up the country or back into the town: he
chose to remain where he could keep an eye on
Jane, and where moreover his own labour supplied
him with necessaries, and enabled him to
lay by a few pence now and then. The first of
these reasons for keeping his place was soon
removed, to the dismay and grief of all connected
with Jane.

After having tried in vain for a fortnight to
catch a sight of her, and afflicted himself perpetually
with the thought of her depression of
spirits the last time they met, Ned took the

91
resolution of walking up to farmer Daleâs door
and asking to speak to Jane Bridgeman. The
farmer happened to be within hearing, and came
forward to give the answer.

âBless me, is it you? After the character
your master gave me of you, I should not have
thought of finding you asking after Jane Bridgeman.
But you are all alike, paupers or no
paupers, as long as there are paupers among us
to spread corruption. Off with you, if you want
to find the person you ask for! She is not here,
thank God! and never shall she enter these doors
again. It was a great folly ever to take her in,
only that another might have been as bad.âWhere
is she!âNay; that is no concern of
mine. I suppose she will lie in in the workhouse
she came from; but whether she went straight
there, or where she went, I neither know nor
care. Off with you from my premises, if you
please!â

And the farmer shut the door in Nedâs face.
His wife had more compassion. She saw Ned
turn red and pale and look very wretched, and
she knew him for the same lad who had many
months before asked work in a tone that pleased
her. She now went out at the back gate, and
met him in the farm-yard. Ned at once owned,
in answer to her enquiries, that Jane was his
sister, and by this means learned much of her
history. She had never settled well to her business
from the day of her arrival, and had seemed
far more bent on being admired than on discharging
her duty. Her mistress was pleased

92
to observe, however, after a time, that she grew
graver in her deportment, though she became
more careless than ever about her work. It was
true, she forgot everything that was said to her,
and gave much trouble by her slovenliness; but
she no longer smiled at compliments from the
farm-servants, or acted the coquette in her necessary
intercourse with them. Mrs. Dale thought
her patience with the girl strangely rewarded
when Jane came one day to give her warning
that she wished to leave her present service at
the earliest term. She would neither give a
reason nor say where she meant to go. When
the day arrived, she waited till her master went
out, and then appeared, to bid her mistress farewell.
In answer to repeated questions about
where she was going, she at length sank down
on a chair, sobbed convulsively, and owned that
she had neither protection nor home in prospect;
that she had been cruelly deceived, and that she
meant to find some hiding-place where she might
lie down and her shame die with her. It was
some time before she would give any hint who it
was that had deceived and who seduced her, and
she never revealed his name; but Mrs. Dale
believed it to be a pauper labourer who had disappeared
a few days before, probably to avoid
being obliged to marry Jane when their guilt
should be discovered. On ascertaining that the
girl had relations, Mrs. Dale recommended that
she should go to her cousin Marshall, open her
whole heart to her, and follow her advice as to
what should next be done; but Janeâs sobs became

93
more violent than ever at this suggestion.
âThey will tear me to pieces!â she cried. âThey
will never put up with disgrace; and I am the
first that has disgraced them. I can never look
cousin Marshall in the face again!ââNeither
would she go to the workhouse. She loathed
the idea of Mrs. Wilkes as much as she dreaded
that of cousin Marshall; and Mrs. Dale was
much perplexed, not daring to keep her another
day, and not choosing to turn her out wholly
destitute. After a long conversation, which
served to soften the poor girlâs heart and win
her confidence, Mrs. Dale proposed a plan which
was adopted,âthat she should write a letter to
cousin Marshall, urging that what was done
could not be undone, and that the most likely
way to make Janeâs penitence real and lasting
was to look to her present safety instead of
driving her to desperation. Mrs. Dale expressed
in very strong terms her concern that the respectability
of the family should have been thus
stained; and took the liberty of declaring her
admiration of the parental kindness with which
the poor orphans had been treated, and her
earnest wishes that it might be better rewarded
in the instance of the others than in that of poor
Jane. With this letter in her hand, Jane was
put into the carrierâs cart, leaving as a last
request to Ned that he would not follow her or
give up his place on her account; and, partly
for his sake, she promised that no persuasion
should prevent her going straight to her cousin
Marshallâs, and following the advice of her

94
friends in every particular. Mrs. Dale had
since ascertained that she was received at her
cousinâs; and had remained in their house up to
the last market-day, when the inquiry was made:
but the farmerâs wife did not know what sad
circumstances the family were in when Jane
arrived to add to their sorrow.

John Marshall had died after a few daysâ
illness; and it was on the very night of his
funeral that Jane alighted at his widowâs door.
Her first feeling on hearing of the event was joy
that one person the less,âand he one whom she
much respected,âwould know of her disgrace.
The next moment she felt what a wretch she
must be,âwhat a state she must be reduced to,âto
rejoice in the death of one who had been
like a parent in tenderness, where no parental
duty enjoined the acts of kindness he had done.
She hastily bade Ann not tell her cousin of her
arrival, and said she would beg a shelter for the
night at her aunt Bellâs: but she was told that
aunt Bell was in great distress too, and could
not possibly receive her; so there was no escape,
and Jane was led in, trembling like a criminal
under sentence, and pulling her cloak about her,
to meet the kind-hearted cousin who had never
frowned upon her. Her agitation was naturally
misunderstood at first; but, after some time, her
refusal even to look up, and the force with which
she prevented their relieving her of her cloak
made her cousin suspect the fact, and dismiss the
young people, in order to arrive at an explanation.âShe
could not read the letter, and

95
Jane would not hear of Ann being called in
to do it, but made an effort to get through it
herself. Cousin Marshall said nothing for some
time; not even the thought which was uppermost
in her mind,âhow glad she was that the
fact never reached her husbandâs ear! At last,
she merely assured Jane that she should be taken
care of, and advised her to go to bed, and leave
everything to be settled when there had been
more time for thought.

âI cannot go,â said Jane. âI will not leave
you while you look so cold upon me, cousin.â

âI will go with you, then,â said Mrs. Marshall
calmly. âWe must have the same bed,
and I am ready.â

âYou said you forgave me,â cried the weeping
Jane; âand I am sure this is not forgiving
me. I never saw you look so upon anybody!â

âI never had reason, Jane; nobody belonging
to me ever had to make such a confession
as yours to-night. I pity you enough, God
knows! for you must be very miserable; but I
cannot look upon you as I do upon your innocent
sisters; how should I?âPoor Sally! I remember
her great comfort about being blind was
that it was not Ann; and if you have any comfort
at all, I suppose it must be that.â

âIndeed, indeed, I had rather be anybody
than what I am. I had rather be drowning this
minute, or even on the gallows: I had rather
die any how than be as I am. I hope I shall die
when my time comes.â

Cousin Marshall quietly represented the sinfulness

96
of this thought, and Jane tempted her to
say more and more, being able to bear anything
better than the silence of displeasure. What,
her cousin asked, could bring her to this pass?
What madness could make her plunge herself
into this abyss of distress after all the warning
and watching, all theââBut it was foolish to
say more, Mrs. Marshall continued, when she
might be led to say what would do no good and
would be therefore unkind.

Jane would not let it drop. She laid much of
the blame on the workhouse, where it was a
common boast among the women how early they
had got married, being so far better off than
honester people that they need not trouble themselves
about what became of themselves and
their children, since the parish was bound to find
them. It was considered a kind of enterprise
among the paupers to cheat their superiors, and
to get the girls early married by rendering marriage
desirable on the score of decency, and of
the chance of the man being able to support his
children hereafter. Janeâs leading idea was the
glory of getting married at sixteen; and the last
thing she thought of was the possibility of being
deceived; and now that her intended husband
was gone nobody knew whither, she was as much
astonished and terrified at her own position as
any of her friends could be. This explanation
caused some inward relentings towards her; but
cousin Marshall thought it too early yet to show
them; and to avoid the danger of doing so, insisted
on both going to bed, where neither of

97
them slept a wink or exchanged a word during
the whole night.

Before morning, Mrs. Marshall had arranged
her plan. Janeâs arrival was on no account to
be mentioned, and she was to be kept entirely
out of sight for the three months which were to
pass before her confinement. By these means,
the persecution of parish officers might be
avoided, and an opportunity afforded for observing
whether the shock had really so sobered
Jane as to render her more fit to take care of
herself than she was before. If she appeared
truly penitent, Mrs. Marshall would try to obtain
a service for her at some distance, where her disgrace
would not follow her, and would also take
charge of the infant, with such help as Jane could
spare out of her wages; and then the parish need
never know anything about the matter. Jane
was most happy to agree to these terms, and
settled herself in this bedroom for three long
months, intending to work diligently for her
infant, and to take all the needle-work of the
family off her cousinâs hands, with as much of
the charge of the children as was possible within
so confined a space. What more she wanted of
exercise was to be taken with Mrs. Marshall
very early in these spring mornings, before their
neighbours should be stirring. The young people
were so trained to obedience, that there was no
fear of their telling anything that they were
desired to keep to themselves.

Things went on as quietly as could be looked
for in such unhappy circumstances. No difficulties

98
arose for some time, and Jane had only to
struggle with her inward shame, her grief at
witnessing Annâs sorrow, her terror at the risks
which must be daily run, and her inability to get
rest of body or mind. She could scarcely be
persuaded to come down in the evening when
the door was shut and the window curtain
drawn: she started at every noise, and could not
get rid of a vague expectation that her lover
would find her out and come to comfort her;âan
expectation which made her turn pale whenever
she heard a manâs voice under the window,
or a tap at the door below. Besides these fears,
circumstances happened now and then to try her
to the utmost.

Early one morning, before Jane was up, and
while Mrs. Marshall and her young people were
dressing, a step was heard slowly ascending the
stairs, the door opened, and Sally appeared with
a smiling countenance and the question,

âAre you awake yet, cousin Marshall, and all
of you?â

Mrs. Marshall made a sign to the children by
putting her finger on her lip, and pointing to Jane.
She had no intention that Sally should be made unhappy
by knowing the truth at present, and was besides
afraid to trust her with such a secret among her
companions at the Asylum, who were all accustomed
to have no concealments from one another.

âWhy donât you answer?â said Sally, groping
for the bed. âI do believe you are all asleep,
though I thought I heard you moving, and the
door was on the latch below.â

99
âWe are all awake, my dear, and one or two
gone out; but we are surprised to see you so
early. What brings you at such a time, and
who came with you?â

Sally explained that the ward of the Asylum in
which she worked was to be whitewashed this
day; and she and a few others whose friends
lived near had leave to enjoy a long holiday.
Three of them had taken care of one another,
the streets being clear at this hour; and she had
found her way easily for the short distance she
had to come alone. While she spoke, Jane was
gazing at her, tearful, and longing to throw
herself on her sisterâs neck. The temptation
became almost irresistible when Sally, feeling
for a place on which to sit down, moved herself
within reach.

âTake care where you sit, my dear,â said
Mrs. Marshall. âHere, I will give you a seat
on my chest.â

This chest was directly opposite the bed, so
that Jane could see the face under the black
bonnet, and convince herself that the old womanish
little figure in brown stuff gown and
white kerchief was really the sister Sally she had
last seen in blue frock and pinafore. During the
whole day, Jane sat on the stairs behind the
half-shut door, listening to Sallyâs cheerful tales
about the doings at the Asylum, and to her frequent
inquiries about both her sisters, and trembling
when any of the little ones spoke, lest they
should reveal her presence. Many perplexing
and dangerous questions too were asked.

100
âWhich of you sighs so? I should not ask if
it could be you, cousin; but it comes from the
other side.â

Again, when Janeâs dinner was being carried
to her.

âAh, we are not allowed to move at dinnertime,
happen what will: and you used not to let
us either; and now Ann has gone upstairs twice
since we sat down.â Again,

âI have leave to knit what I please on
Saturdays; so I am knitting a pair of mittens
for Jane, against she comes to see me, which I
hope she will one day; but be sure you none of
you tell her about the mittens. I spoiled two
pair in trying, and she would be so sorry to
know how I wasted my time and the cotton.â

âPoor dear!â said Mrs. Marshall at night,
when Sally was gone; âit seems wicked to take
advantage of her infirmity to deceive her; but it
is all for her good, placed where she is by her
blindness. It would be far more cruel to tell
her all, when it may be that she need never know
it.â

Jane took all this upon herself; but, while she
blamed herself for having caused this new practice
of concealment, she was far more grieved at
it in John Marshallâs case. She did not strictly
owe any confidence to Sally, but she did to John
Marshall; and the idea that he had left her the
same blessing with the rest of her family when
he died, gave her far more pain than any tears
or reproaches from Sally could ever do.

One Sunday, when cousin Marshall had gone

101
to church in the morning with her family, and
left her house apparently shut up, as usual; and
when, moreover, it was so fine a day as to have
taken almost all the neighbours from their homes,
Jane came down to prepare the dinner, feeling
quite secure from interruption. She was standing
kneading the dumplings, when a noise was
heard outside, and she had but a momentâs time
to escape upstairs before her aunt Bell lifted the
latch and entered. Seeing the dough on the
board and nobody there to knead it, she naturally
proceeded to the bedroom, where she found
Jane on the bed with coverings thrown over her.
Questions and explanations followed.âHow long
had Jane been unwell, and did she expect to go
back to her place when recovered? Why did
she not let her aunt know of her arrival? though,
to be sure, there was no use in expecting help
from her, distressed as she was. Jane was really
glad to turn the conversation away from her own
troubles to those of Mrs. Bell, who was, as she
herself said, as good as a widow, her husband
having absconded. Dear! had not Jane heard
of it? He had been advertised by the overseers
in the newspapers, and a great fuss had been
made about it; but, for her part, she was convinced
it was the best thing he could do for her
and the children, to go and find a settlement in
a distant parish, leaving his family to be provided
for by his own. Where had he gone?âWhy,
supposing she knew, was it likely she
should tell before the year was out? However,
he had made all safe by not giving a hint in

102
which direction he should travel. Jane asked
what was the necessity of keeping the secret for
a year? He would surely be out of reach before
the year was over, if at all. Mrs. Bell laughed
and said she saw Jane did not know how to get
a settlement; and explained to her that her husbandâs
aim was to obtain a claim on a distant
and prosperous parish, which must be done either
by living forty days on an estate of his own,
worth thirty pounds, or in a rented tenement of
the yearly value of ten pounds, or by serving an
apprenticeship, or by going through a yearâs
service on a yearly hiring as an unmarried man.
This last was, of course, the only means within
his power; and to make sure of it, it was his
part to keep to himself whence he had come,
and that he had a wife and family; and herâs to
remain ignorant whither he had gone, and not to
inquire for her husband for a year at least.

âDo you call this a cheat, my dear?â she
went on. âLord! what a tender conscience
you have! It is no worse than what is done
every day. Would you think it such a very
wicked thing now,âsuppose a young creature like
you should have happened to have a misfortune,
and should wish her infant to have a settlement in
a particular parish,âwould you think it such a
very wicked thing to hide yourself and keep
your condition a secret from the officers till your
child was born?â And Mrs. Bell looked inquisitively
in her nieceâs face.

âThat would be telling no lie,â replied Jane,
her face making the confession which she kept
her tongue from uttering.

103
âWell; and whose fault is it, my dear, that
lies are told about the matter? If the laws put
such difficulty in the way of getting relief, we
are driven to tell fibs; for relief we must have.â

Mrs. Marshall, who had overheard some of the
conversation, and now came to Janeâs assistance,
observed that the fault seemed to her to be in
the laws giving relief at all. Mischiefs out of
number came of it, and no good that she saw.
The more relief the law gave, the more it might
give, to judge by the swarms of paupers; and
all this made it the more difficult for honest and
independent folks to get their bread. She
thought her own experience, and Mrs. Bellâs
together, might be enough to show how bad the
system was.

âMine, I grant you,â cried Mrs. Bell; âbut
what have you had to do with it? You, that
pride yourself on never having touched a penny
of parish money.â

âThanks, under God, to my husband, cousin
Bell, we have been beholden to nobody but ourselves
for our living. We have never had to
bear the scornful glance from the rate-payers,
nor the caprice of the overseer, nor any of the
uncertainty of depending on what might fail us,
nor the shame of calling our children paupers.âI
say these things freely, cousin Bell, because I
know you have been too long used to them
to mind them.âWe have never crossed the
threshold of the workhouse on our own account;
nor ever been driven to expose our want when
it was the greatest; or tempted to fib by word

104
or act to get more than our share of other peopleâs
money. Yet, the worst things we have
suffered have risen out of these poor-laws; and
the worst thing about them is, that those suffer
by them who desire to have nothing to do with
them. They prevent people going where their
labour is wanted, and would be well paid, and
keep them in a place where there are far more
hands than there is work for. Honest, hard-working
men, like my husband, have always felt
the hardship of either being obliged to stay
where wages were low from the number of labourers,
or to give up their settlements for the
chance of work in some other place.â

âHe had better have run off by himself, and
left his settlement to you and the children,â observed
Mrs. Bell.

âJohn Marshall was not the man to do that,
cousin. But, as I was saying, many a time
when we were brought very low, so much so
that my husband had not had his pint, nor the
children anything but bread for a week, and less
of that than they could have eaten,âat many
such times we have been told of this parish and
that parish where there was plenty of work and
good wages, and have had half a mind to go
and try our fortune; but we always remembered
that so many more needy people would be likely
to do the same, that it would soon cease to be a
good parish, and we might have left a place
where we were known and respected, for what
would prove to be no good. I have heard that
these favourite parishes are seldom long prosperous

105
under the best management, for paupers
contrive, by all sorts of tricks, to get a settlement
in them.â

âWell; that makes an end, however, of your
complaint of there not being labour where labour
is wanted.â

âIndeed it does not, cousin Bell; for they
are mostly idle men and cheats that wander about
making experiments on such places. Sober,
good labourers, would be much more ready to go
where they are wanted, if it were not for the fear
of losing their settlements. Such end, as my
husband did, by staying in their own parish to
have their labour poorly paid, and to see rogues
and vagabonds consuming what would have
added to their wages, if labour had been left to
earn its due reward.â

Mrs. Bell did not care about all this; all she
knew was that people must live, and that she and
her family could not have lived without the
parish, and a deal of help besides.

âThe very thing I complain of most, cousin
Bell, is, that those who have the relief are those
that know and care the least about the matter.
It is they that are above taking the relief that
have good reason to know, and much cause to
care, that their labour cannot be properly paid,
and that their children cannot have a fair chance
in the world, while the money that should pay
their wages is spent without bringing any more
gain than if it was thrown into the sea. It is
because such as you, cousin Bell, care about
nothing but getting relief, that such husbands as

106
mine lose their natural rest through anxiety, and
pinch themselves and work themselves into their
graves, and die, not knowing but their families
may come to be paupers after all.âI am warm,
cousin, but youâll excuse me; nothing chafes me
so easily as thinking of this; the more from remembering
nearly the last words my husband
spoke. âI hope,â says he,âbut I thought there
was little hope in his tone, or in his face,ââI
hope you and yours will be able to keep free of the
parish. Get the boys into my club, if they live
to be old enough; and then they will keep their
mother and sisters free of the parish.ââI thank
God! we can get on at present; but I sometimes
think some of us will end our days in the
workhouse, if idle and needy people go on to increase
as they do, and to eat up the substance
they never helped, as we have done, to make.â

âIt will be some time yet, cousin Marshall,
before your boys can belong to the club.â

âYes; but in the meanwhile there is the
Savings Bank, where the girls can put their little
savings as well as the boys. Not that they
have done anything in that way yet, except my
eldest and Ann. But the others are earning
their own clothes.â

Mrs. Bell asked Jane whether it was not a
nice thing for her sister Ann to have a little
money in the bank ready for such occasions as
Janeâs present illness? She supposed Jane was
now using it up; and to be sure it was a charming
thing to have such help at hand. Mrs. Marshall,
who knew that one of Janeâs griefs was

107
depriving Ann of her little store, saved her the
pain of replying by inviting Mrs. Bell down to
dinner.

At the close of the meal, Mrs. Bell cast a
longing eye on the few fragments she had left.
Her children had only a crust of bread to eat
this day; and she complained much of the hardships
they were reduced to, showing how her
only gown was wearing out, and relating that it
was ruinous work to do as she was doing now,
pawning her blanket in the morning to release
her gown, and the gown in the evening to release
the blanket. Cousin Marshall was grieved for
the children, but, charitable as she was known to
be, she offered no help. She had nothing to
spare, and had done her utmost in giving a
hearty dinner; and, if she had had the means,
she would have bestowed them where they might
have afforded real relief, which no charity ever
did to Mrs. Bell.

This woman seldom visited her neighbours
without leaving them cause to wish that she had
staid away. This was the case in the present
instance. She whispered her suspicions of Janeâs
situation, either to the parish officers, or to some
one who carried it round to them; and the consequence
was that the poor girl was hunted up,
taken before a magistrate to be sworn, and removed
to the workhouse to abide her confinement.
In return to her bitter reproaches the
next time they met, Mrs. Bell laughed, and said
she thought she had done them all a great
kindness.âCousin Marshall ought to be very

108
glad to be relieved of the charge, and Jane
would be sure of a husband if her lover could be
found up. Janeâs views had, however, been
altered by her intercourse with Mrs. Marshall.
She would much rather have gone to service and
tried to atone for what was done, than remain
to be the pauper-wife of a man who had cruelly
deceived her,âwho would not marry unless he
could be caught,âand who, being an unwilling,
would be probably an unkind, husband. Her
good cousin feared something worse for her than
the misery of her lot: she feared that this misery
might drive her to habitual vice; and that her
re-entrance into the workhouse might prove the
date from which she would become a castaway
from her family for ever.

Chapter VIII.

WHAT IS CHARITY?

Ned heard of Janeâs return to the workhouse,
and of her confinement, from Mr. Burke, who
attended Mr. Effinghamâs family, and who recognized,
to his great surprise, Ned Bridgeman
in the boy who one day opened the gate for him,
and followed to hold his horse. Whenever he
came, from that time forward, he inquired for Ned,
and was ready to make the wished-for reply to
the customary petition, not to tell the officers or

109
anybody belonging to them, where he was, but
just to inform cousin Marshall and his sisters
that he was well and likely to go on earning a
living. It was in vain to reason with him, that
the parish could desire nothing more than that
he should maintain himself, and that the officers
would be glad to leave him unmolested. He
had eloped, and was possessed with the idea
that he should be carried back whence he came;
and had, moreover, such a horror of the place
and people connected with his short period of
pauperism, that he longed above all things to
keep out of sight of the one, and be forgotten
by the other. The pauper labourers who worked
with him in the field, discovered something of
this, and amused themselves by alarming him
with dark hints, from time to time, that some
danger impended. They were not over-fond of
him, harmless and good-natured as he was. The
bailiff was apt to hold him up as an example to
them in an injudicious way, and Nedâs horror of
pauperism,âhis pride, as his companions called
it,âwas not exactly the quality to secure their
good fellowship. They teazed the boy sadly,
and Mr. Burke thought he looked more and
more grave every time he saw him. The gentleman
was not, therefore, much surprised when
he was told one day that Ned was missing, nor
did he give much heed to the remarks on the
unsteadiness of the boy who had twice absconded.
On finding that, so far from having done anything
dishonest, Ned had left nearly half-a-crown
of his savings in Mr. Effinghamâs hands, Mr.

110
Burke made inquiry into the circumstances, and
found that, as he suspected, Ned had been assured
that the officers were after him, and so cruelly
taunted with his sisterâs shame, that it was no
wonder he had gone farther up the country,
where he might work in peace, if work was to be
found. Nothing could be done but to take
charge of his money, and invest it where it
might increase till the owner should be forthcoming
to claim it. So Mr. Burke pocketed the
two shillings and fourpence half-penny as carefully
as if it had been a hundred pounds, and
saw that it was placed in the Savings Bank with
Annâs, and made as light as he could to the
family of the fact that he no longer knew where
the lad was; adding that Ned was a boy whom
he would trust all over the world by himself, and
prophesying that he would re-appear some day
to be a credit and a help to his orphan sisters.

On one occasion when Mr. Burke was entering
the village of Titford, he overtook Mr. Effingham
walking slowly with his head bent down,
and his hands in his pockets. He looked up
when greeted by his friend, who accosted him
withâ

âI am afraid you are to be one of my patients
to-day, to judge by your gait and countenance.
What can be the matter? No misfortune at
home, I hope?â

âNo; but I have just heard something that
has shocked me very much. There is an execution
at Daleâs.â

âHow hard that poor man has struggled!â

111
observed Mr. Burke. âAnd has it even come
to this at last?â

âEven so; and through no fault of his own
that I can see. They are distraining for the
rate.â

âAye, that is the way, Effingham. Thus is
our pauper list swelled, year by year. It grows
at both ends. Paupers multiply their own numbers
as fast as they can, and rate-payers sink
down into rate-receivers. This will probably be
Daleâs fate, as it has been that of many little
farmers before him. And if it is, he will only
anticipate by a few years the fate of others besides
small farmers, of shopkeepers, manufacturers,
merchants, and agriculturists of every
class; always providing that some radical amendment
of the system does not take place.â

âGod help us!â cried Effingham. âIf so,
our security is gone, as a nation, and as individuals.â

âAt present, Effingham, the security of property
is to the pauper, and not to the proprietor,
however rich he may be. The proprietor is
compelled, as in the case before us, to pay more
and more to the rate till his profits are absorbed,
and he is obliged to relinquish his undertakings
one after another; field after field goes out of
cultivation, his capital is gradually transferred to
his wages-fund, which is paid away without
bringing an adequate return; and when all but
his fixed capital is gone, that becomes liable to
seizure, and the ruin is complete. There is no
more security of property, under such a system,

112
than there is security of life to a poor wretch in
a quicksand, who feels himself swallowed up inch
by inch. The paupers meanwhile are sure of
their relief as long as the law subsists. They
are to be provided for at all events, let what will
become of other people. While Dale has been
fretting by day, and tossing by night under the
burden of his cares, his pauper labourers have
been supporting a very different kind of burden,âthe
burden of the pauper song,

âHang sorrow and cast away care,

The parish is bound to find us!ââ

âThis very security of property which is the
most precious of an independent manâs rights,â
said Effingham, âseems to be the most pernicious
thing in the world to the indigent. One
may fairly call it so in relation to them, for they
seem to consider the produce of the rate as their
property.â

âIt is really so,â replied Burke. âThey know
it to be the lawful property of the pauper body,
and that the only question is how it is to be distributed?
As long as they know this, they will
go on multiplying the claims upon it till nothing
is left with which to satisfy them.â

âIt is very odd,â said Effingham, âthat none
of the checks that have ever been tried have
done any good; they seem rather to have made
the matter worse.â

âI do not think it strange, Effingham. None
of the remedies have struck at the root of the
evil, and none could therefore effect lasting good.
The test is just this: do they tend to lessen the

113
number of the indigent? Unless they do this,
they may afford relief to a generation, or shift
a burden from one district to another, or from
one class of producers upon another; but they
will not improve the system. Look at the experiments
tried! First, paupers were to wear
a badge, a mark of infamy. Of course, the profligate
and hardened were the readiest to put it on,
and those who had modesty and humble pride refused
it, and obtained help only through the compassion
of overseers, who evaded the regulation
so perpetually, that it was abolished as useless.
While it lasted, profligate pauperism increased
very rapidly. Next came the expedient of
workhouses, in which the poor were expected to
do more work, and be fed less expensively than in
their own houses. But here again the rogue and
vagabond class reaped the advantage, the houses
being detested by the sober and quiet; and the
choice of the latter to pine at home, rather than
be shut up in a workhouse, occasioned a
diminution of the rate for some time; but that
time has long been over, and now the maintenance
of a pauper costs three or four times as
much in a workhouse as out of it, there being no
inducement to the paupers to work, and but
little to their managers to economise. And this
is just what any one might have foretold from the
beginning, if he had seen what experience has
plainly taught us, that indigence must spread
while numbers increase, and while the subsistence-fund,
on which they are to be supported,
is consumed unproductively.â

114
âBut why unproductively?â said Effingham.
âI cannot help thinking that there must be some
mode of management, by which manufactures
might be carried on by paupers with pretty good
success.â

âSuppose it to be so, according to what I
imagine you to mean by success,âsuppose a
certain quantity of produce to be achieved and disposed
of,âthis is in itself a great evil. Capital
raised by forcible means, arbitrarily applied, and
made to bring a return from an artificial market,
can never be so productive as if it found a natural
channel; and its employment in this artificial
manner is a serious injury to individual
capitalists. In the neighbourhood of a workhouse
where work is really done, a manufacturer,
while paying to the rate, bitterly feels that he
is subscribing the means by which his trade is to
be stolen from him. It is adding insult to injury
to set up in the faces of rate-payers workhouse
manufactures, which are to have a preference
in the market to their own. In all these cases,
however, the object fails. To all remedies yet
tried, the same fundamental objection applies:
they all encourage the increase of population,
while they sink capital. What we want is the
very reverse of this,âwe want a reproduction of
capital with increase, and a limitation of numbers

within
within
a due proportion to this fund.â

âWhat do you think, then, of the methods
proposed for the amelioration of the system?â

âWhich? There are so many.â

âThe cottage system, for one.â

115
âIt will not bear the test. Under no system
does population increase more rapidly;âwitness
Ireland; and in addition to the worst evils that
afflict Ireland, we should have that of a legal
claim to support, which effectually prevents the
due improvement of capital. Cottages would
prove no better than workhouses, depend upon
it.â

âWell, then, what do you think of assessing
new kinds of property?â

âWorse and worse! This would be only
casting more of our substance into the gulf before
its time. It would be helping to increase the
number of paupers; it would be encouraging the
unproductive consumption of capital; it would
beâââ

âLike pouring water into one of your dropsical
patients,â said Effingham, smiling.

âJust so, Effingham; and it needs no great
skill to foresee the result in both cases.â

âThen there are Benefit Clubs,â replied Effingham.
âSome think that if they were made obligatory
by law, they might soon supersede the
poor-rate. What do you think of them?â

âNo man approves such societies more than I,
as long as they are voluntary; but fellowship of
this kind would lose its virtue, I doubt, by being
made compulsory. There are no means that I
know of, of compelling a man who will not earn
to store his earnings; and the frugal and industrious
will do it without compulsion, as soon as
they understand the matter: so that in fact the
worst classes of society would be left as free to

116
roam, and beg, and steal, as if the institution
did not exist.â

âBut Friendly Societies and Benefit Clubs will
bear your test. They tend to the increase of
capital, and, by encouraging prudence, to the
limitation of numbers.â

âTrue; and therefore I wish they were in
universal operation among the working classes;
but this must be by voluntary association. It
will be a work of time to convince our whole
population of their advantages; and even then the
less industrious part will rather depend on the
poor-rate, if it still subsists. We must have
recourse to some speedier method of lessening
our burdens, giving all possible encouragement
to Friendly Societies in the mean time.â

âWhat method? It seems to me that relief
is already given in every possible way.â

âAye; there is the mistake, Effingham.
People think they give relief in giving money.â

âI seldom give money,â replied Effingham.

âNo; but you give what money will buy,
which is, begging your pardon, worse than ineffectual.
Now, if you have no objection, I
should like to know how much you spent on
coals and blankets the first Christmas you settled
here, and how much last year?â

âI began with devoting five pounds a-year to
this purpose; but it increased sadly. I stopped
short two years ago at twenty pounds; but it
grieved me to the heart to do so, for more
objects remain now unsupplied than I supplied
at first.â

117
âProbably; and are these new applicants
strangers from other parishes brought round
you by your bounty, or are more of your near
neighbours in a condition for receiving charity?â

âDale reproaches me with having brought an
inundation of paupers from a distance; but really
our own population has increased wonderfully.â

âAnd the more support you offer them, friend,
the more surprisingly they will increase, if there
can be anything surprising in the case. Surely you
do not mean to go on giving coals and blankets?â

âWhat can I do? You would call me cruel
to withdraw the gift, if you could see the destitution
of the poor creatures. I am completely at
a loss how to proceed. If I go on, poverty increases;
if I stop, the people will freeze and pine
before my eyes. What a dilemma!â

âMuch like that of government about its
pauper subjects. I should recommend the same
method to both.â

âTo fix a maximum, I suppose; to declare
the amount beyond which relief shall not be
given? I have tried that, and it does not succeed.
Twenty pounds a-year is my maximum, and is
known to be so; but every one hopes to have a
portion of it, and reckons upon his share nearly
as confidently as if all were sure of it.â

âOf course; and there is the additional evil of
admitting the principle of a claim to support,
which is at the bottom of the mischief.âNo; to
fix a maximum is to unite the evils of the
maintenance and the abolition of the pauper
system; and both are bad enough singly. If I

118
were you, and if I were the government, I would
immediately disavow the principle in question,
and take measures for ceasing to act upon it. If
I were you, I would explain to my neighbours
that, finding this mode of charity create more
misery than it relieves, I should discontinue it
in the way which appears to inflict the least
hardship. I would give notice that, after the
next Christmas donation, no more coals and
blankets shall be given except to those aged and
sickly people who at present look for them; and
that no new applicants whatever shall be placed
on the list, the object being to have the charity
die out as soon as possible.â

âBut I shall be railed at wherever I turn my
face. I should not wonder if they pull my house
about my ears. They will rob my poultry-yard,
and burn my ricks. They willâââ

âVery like the situation of government!â
exclaimed Mr. Burke. âThe very same difficulties
on a smaller scale. Friend, you must
bear the railing for a time, since it comes as a
natural consequence of what you have already
done. I am sure so benevolent a man as you
would rather endure this personal inconvenience
than add to the misery around you. You are
capable of heroism in retrieving a mistake,
Effingham. As for your house and other property,
you must take measures to protect it.
You must firmly and gently repress tendencies
to violence which arise, as you now perceive,
from an error of your own.â

âI will consider, resolve, and act; and that

119
without delay, for the evil is pressing,â said
Effingham.

âI wish government would do the same,â
replied Mr. Burke. âWe hear much of consideration,
but the resolve is yet to be made; and
how long the act may be in following, it is impossible
to guess. Meanwhile, we are going
headlong to ruin as fast as you would do if you
answered all the petitions for charity which
would be brought upon you by unbounded readiness
to give. Your private fortune would be
gone in a twinkling, and so will vanish our
national resources.â

âWhat period would you fix for abolishing
the rate?â

âThe best plan, in my opinion, yet proposed,
is this:âto enact that no child born from any
marriage taking place within a year from the
date of the law, and no illegitimate child born
within two years from the same date, shall ever
be entitled to parish assistance. This regulation
should be made known, and its purpose explained
universally; and this, if properly done, might, I
think, prevent violence, and save a vast amount
of future distress. The people should be called
together, either in their places of worship or
elsewhere, in such a manner as to attract the
whole population to listen, and the case should be
explained to them by their pastors or others. It
is so plain a case, and so capable of illustration,
that I see no great difficulty in making the most
ignorant comprehend it.â

âAnd yet the details are vast.â

120
âVast, but not complicated; so the whole
might be conveyed in a parable which any child
can understand. I think I dare undertake to
prove to any rational being that national distress

cannot
be relieved by money, and that consequently
individual distress cannot be so relieved
without inflicting the same portion of distress
elsewhere. A child can see that if there is so
much bread in a country and no more, and if
the rich give some of the poor two shillings a
day that they may eat more bread, the price of
bread will rise, and some who could buy before
must go without now. Since no more bread is
created by this charity, the only thing done is to
take some of it out of the reach of purchasers to
give it to paupers.â

âTrue: the only real charity is to create more
bread; and, till this can be done, to teach men
to be frugal of what they have.âI happen to
know a case which illustrates your doctrine.
Owen, who lives in this village, earned ten shillings
a week before the last scarcity. He
bought eight shillingsâ worth of flour for his
family, and had two to spare for other necessaries.
During the scarcity, he received fourteen
shillings a week from his parish, in addition
to the ten he earned; but the price of corn had
risen so much that he now gave twenty-two shillings
out of his twenty-four for the same quantity
of flour; so that he had still two shillings left
for other necessaries; and thus, was no richer
with twenty-four shillings than he had been
with ten.â

121
âIf there had been many such cases,â observed
Mr. Burke, âthe price of corn would have been
even higher than it was. The best charity to the
public as well as to this man would have been to
teach him that he had better look after other
kinds of food, and not insist on such an abundance
of flour. Do not you think he could have
understood this? and if he could, why should not
his brethren understand the state of the pauper
system, and be brought to acquiesce in the
measures now necessary to be taken?âIf the
regulation I have described had been made when
first proposed, there would have been much less
difficulty than now. If not done now, there is
no saying how soon it may be out of our power
to do anything. We are now borne down, we
shall soon be crushed, by the weight of our
burdens.â

âWe must hasten to give our testimony,â
said Effingham: âI, by withdrawing my donations,
and declaring why; you, byââbut you
have given yours, I suspect. I see now the
reasons of your resigning your offices at both the
charitable institutions where I and others took
so much pains to get you in. I was more than
half angry at it when I thought of our canvass,
and all the disagreeablenesses belonging to it;âand
all done and endured for nothing. But I
see now how it is. I can only hope that your
going out of office may do more good than your
going in; and what more can I say?â

âNothing more gratifying to my self-complacency,
I am sure,â said Mr. Burke,
smiling.
smiling.

122
âI have had my recompense already in finding
that many more than I expected attend to my
reasons, and take them into consideration as a
matter of real importance. My hopes sometimes
mount so high as to flatter me that all Great
Britain may soon be effectually employed upon
the problemâ
How to reduce the number of
the indigent.
â

Chapter IX.

COUSIN MARSHALLâS END.

It was some years before any tidings came of
Ned that could be depended upon. At length a
countryman called on the widow Marshall one
market-day, saying that he had had a world of
trouble in finding her out in the small place she
had got into outside the city, but was determined
not to meet Ned Bridgeman again without
having seen her and delivered Nedâs packet into
her own hand. Mrs. Marshall had nobody living
with her now but her youngest daughter, who
happened not to be at home at this hour; and
as Mrs. Marshall could not read, she was obliged
to wait till evening to know what was in the
letter, and what the guinea was for which the
packet contained. She obtained great satisfaction
from the countryman concerning Ned,
sent him her love and blessing, and the promise

123
of an answer to his letter when there should be
an opportunity of sending one, which might
happen by means of the present messenger within
six months. Many times before the evening
did cousin Marshall open the letter, and examine
it, and admire as much of it as was apparent to
her; viz. the evenness of the lines and the
absence of blots. The guinea, too, was a very
good sign. The letter proved that his workhouse
schooling had not been lost upon him; and the
money, that her methods of education had taken
effect. Her answer, written down by her daughter,
was as follows:â

âDear Ned,

âYour letter was very welcome to us, since
you could not come yourself. I do not wonder
you met with hardships and difficulty in settling.
Such is the way with many people in these days
who wish to be beholden to nobody; but such
generally meet with their deserts at last, as I am
glad to hear you have. We have put your
guinea into the Savings Bank for you, my dear
boy, as, thank God! we none of us want it at
present, and there was half-a-guinea of yours
there before. Now I dare say you are wondering
how it came there? It is the half-crown of
wages you left behind you at Titford that Mr.
Burke took care of, and it has grown into half-a-guinea
by not being touched, which I hope
will be good news to you. I quite approve your
wish about the Friendly Society, knowing how
my husband did the wisest thing in belonging to

124
one, and at times could have got through in no
other way. There is nothing about your sisters
that should give you any scruple. Sally, poor
thing, is very contented in the Asylum; and, as
the people there are fond of her, has fewer
troubles than many that have their eyesight.
I have not seen so many tears from her since
she went in as when my Susan read your letter
to her, and she sends you her love. Ann is
pretty well off in service, having nothing to complain
of but her mistressâs temper, with which
she will contrive to bear, I hope, for she has a
sweet one of her own. She will write to you
herself, and tell you as much as we know about
Jane, which is but little, and that little very sad.
She is quite lost, I fear; but you may depend
on my keeping my eye upon her. I thank you,
my dear boy, for your questions about me and
mine. My children have all left me but the one
that holds the pen, and she is going to marry too.
I hope she will have an easier life than her
sisters, who are much put to it with their large
families. I begin to feel myself growing old
when I see so many grandchildren about me;
and perhaps it is owing to that that I feel far
more troubled about how their parents are to get
through than I ever did for John Marshall and
myself, when we had another little family added,
as it were, to our own eight. But God preserve
me from failing in my trust!âtrusting as I wish
to do, not to other peopleâs charity, but to oneâs
own labour and thrift, which has His blessing
sooner than the other. Many a merciful lesson

125
has been given me about trusting,âone since I
had your letter. On Saturday, my eldest grandson
and daughter were both out of work. To-day
is Monday, and they have each got a place.
Indeed God Almighty is very good to us. But
Susan is tired, not having kept up her schooling,
I am afraid, so well as you. However, it looks
a long letter, though I have many more things
to say to you if you were here. Old as I call
myself, I may see you on this side the grave, or
will try to think so till you say not. Till then,
I send you my love and blessing, which I hope
you know you have had all this long while.â

The close of cousin Marshallâs very long life
was not altogether so serene as the character of
its days of vigour might seem to deserve. Her
children were so burdened with families of their
own that they could offer no further assistance
than that she should lodge with them by turns.
She was positive, however, in her determination
to live alone; and a small room in a poor place
on the outskirts of the city was her dwelling.
In one way or another she earned a little
matter, and lived upon it, to the astonishment of
some who received twice as much from the parish
and could not make it do. Her adopted children
found the utmost difficulty in making her accept
any assistance, clearly as it was her due from
those to whom she had been a mother in their
orphan state. It grieved Ned to the heart to see
her using her dim sight to patch her cloak for
the twentieth time, when he had placed at her

126
disposal the guinea and half, with all that had
accumulated upon it, in the Savings Bank.

âNot yet. When I want it. I can do for
myself still,â were always her answers; and
though, without consulting her, he laid in coals
and bought clothes for her during the two only
visits that he was able to make to that neighbourhood,
and though these presents were, after
some scruples, accepted, he never could prevail
upon her to use the little fund during his absence
for her daily comforts. She was somewhat unpopular
among her neighbours, who did not
relish her occasional observations on the multiplication
of alehouses, or her reports of what a
comely, robust man her John Marshall was, for
all he had seldom a pint and pipe to refresh himself
with when his dayâs work was done. Nobody
was more openhearted and sociable; but he
could not afford both ale and independence,âto
say nothing of charity; and everybody knew he
was a father to the orphan.âThe neighbours
observed that he was certainly very kind to the
parish; but that, for their parts, they could not
afford to give charity to the parish. It was more
natural for the parish to give to them. Such
degeneracy as this roused cousin Marshall to
prophesy evil. She was rather too ready with
her forebodings that those who thus spoke would
die in the workhouse, and with her horror at the
warning seeming to create no alarm. But what
roused her indignation above everything was the
frequent question how, after all her toils and
savings, she was better off than her cousin, Mrs.

127
Bell? Mrs. Bell had never more heard of her
husband, and had at length been taken into
the workhouse with her family; of whom one
daughter had followed Janeâs example, and gained
her point of a pauper marriage; one son was an
ill-doing pauper labourer; and another, having
been transported for theft, was flourishing at
Sydney, and likely to get more money than all
cousin Marshallâs honest children put together.
Mrs. Bell was proud of this sonâs prosperity,
and would not have been sorry to hear any day
of the other getting transported in like manner.âNow
and then it occurred to cousin Marshall
that there was little use in answering those who
could ask such a question as wherein she was
better off than Mrs. Bell; but it oftener happened
that her replies were given in a style of eloquence
that did not increase her popularity.âDeath
came at last, in time to save her from the dependence
she dreaded, though not from the apprehension
of it. In crossing her threshold, one
winterâs day, with her apron full of sticks, she
tripped and fell. She seemed to sustain no injury
but the jar; but that was fatal. She survived
just long enough to see the daughter who lived
in the neighbourhood, and make a bequest of
her Bible to one child, her bed to another, her
few poor clothes to a third, pointing out the
corner of her chest where was deposited the little
hoard she had saved for her burial.

âGod has been very good to me and mine,â
she said. âThey tell me I have not always
said so; but I meant no mistrust. I may have

128
been too much in a hurry to go where âthe
wicked cease from troubling and the weary are
at rest:â but it is all right now that I am really
going at last. Thank God! I can say to the
last that He has been very good to me.â

She left her blessing for every one by name,
and died.

Mr. Burke met the funeral train coming out
of the churchyard, and immediately knew Ned,
long as it was since they had met.

âYour cousin Marshallâs funeral!â he exclaimed.
âMy wife and Louisa and I inquired
for her in vain, a long while ago, and supposed
she had been dead some time. She must have
been a great age.â

âEighty-one, sir.â

In answer to Mr. Burkeâs inquiries how she had
passed her latter days, and in opposition to Nedâs
affectionate report of her, a neighbour observed,
with a shake of the head, that she was awfully
forsaken at times.

âIt was but the day before she died, sir, that
she complained that the Almighty had forgotten
her, and that she was tired of looking to be
released.â

Ned brushed his hand across his eyes as he
observed that her neighbours were not capable
of judging of such a woman as cousin Marshall,
and not worthy to find fault with what she let
fall in her dark moments.

âMy wife said at the time, however,â replied
the man, âthat it would be well if a judgment
did not come upon her for such words; and,

129
sure enough, by the same hour the next day she
was dead; and not in a natural way either.â

Mr. Burke smiled at Ned, who gravely observed
that his cousin had lived too late to be
done justice to. By what he had heard her tell,
he judged that a hundred years ago she would
have been honoured and tended in her old age,
and saved all she had suffered from fear of
the parish, and have had it told on her tombstone
how many children she had bred up by her
industry. It would not be difficult, for that
matter, to put up a tombstone now; but where
would be the use of it, unless it was honoured?
The want lay there.

âI hope,â said Mr. Burke, âthat we may as
reasonably say that your cousin lived too early
as that she lived too late. The time will come,
trust me, when there will be end of the system
under which she has suffered. It cannot always
be that the law will snatch the bread from the
industrious to give it to the idle, and turn labour
from its natural channel, and defraud it of its due
reward, and authorise the selfish and dissolute to
mock at those who prize independence, and who
bind themselves to self-denial that they may practise
charity. The time will come, depend upon
it, when the nation will effectually take to heart
such injustice as this. There is much to undo,
much to rectify, before the labours of the poor,
in their prime, shall secure to them a serene old
age; but the time will come, though by that day
yonder grave may be level with the turf beside
it, and there may be none to remember or speak
of Cousin Marshall.â

130
Summary of Principles illustrated in this
Volume.

In a society composed of a natural gradation of
ranks, some must be poor;
i.e.
have nothing
more than the means of present subsistence.

Any suspension of these means of subsistence,
whether through disaster, sickness, or decrepitude,
converts the poor into the indigent.

Since indigence occasions misery, and disposes
to vice, the welfare of society requires the greatest
possible reduction of the number of the indigent.

Charity, public and private, or an arbitrary
distribution of the subsistence-fund, has hitherto
failed to effect this object; the proportion of the
indigent to the rest of the population having increased
from age to age.

This is not surprising, since an arbitrary distribution
of the subsistence-fund, besides rendering
consumption unproductive, and encouraging a
multiplication of consumers, does not meet the
difficulty arising from a disproportion of numbers
to the means of subsistence.

The small unproductive consumption occasioned
by the relief of sudden accidents and rare
infirmities is necessary, and may be justifiably
provided for by charity, since such charity does
not tend to the increase of numbers; but, with
this exception, all arbitrary distribution of the
necessaries of life is injurious to society, whether
in the form of private almsgiving, public charitable
institutions, or a legal pauper-system.

The tendency of all such modes of distribution

131
having been found to be to encourage improvidence
with all its attendant evils,âto injure the
good while relieving the bad,âto extinguish the
spirit of independence on one side,âand of charity
on the other,âto encourage peculation,
tyranny, and fraud,âand to increase perpetually
the evil they are meant to remedy,âbut one plea
is now commonly urged in favour of a legal provision
for the indigent.

This plea is that every individual born into a
state has a right to subsistence from the state.

This plea, in its general application, is grounded
on a false analogy between a state and its members,
and a parent and his family.

A parent has a considerable influence over
the subsistence-fund of his family, and an absolute
control over the numbers to be supported by
that fund; whereas the rulers of a state, from
whom a legal provision emanates, have little influence
over its subsistence-fund, and no control
whatever over the number of its members.

If the plea of right to subsistence be grounded
on the faults of national institutions, the right
ought rather to be superseded by the rectification
of those institutions, than admitted at the cost of
perpetuating an institution more hurtful than all
the others combined.

What, then, must be done to lessen the number
of the indigent, now so frightfully increasing?

The subsistence-fund must be employed productively,
and capital and labour be allowed to

132
take their natural course;
i.e.
the pauper system
must, by some means or other, be extinguished.

The number of consumers must be proportioned
to the subsistence-fund. To this end, all encouragements
to the increase of population should
be withdrawn, and every sanction given to the
preventive check;
i.e.
charity must be directed
to the enlightenment of the mind, instead of to
the relief of bodily wants.

If not adopted speedily, all measures will be
too late to prevent the universal prevalence of
poverty in this kingdom, the legal provision for
the indigent now operating the extinction of our
national resources at a perpetually increasing
rate.

Ireland

PREFACE.

Though it is my business to treat of the permanent
rather than of the transient causes of the
distress of Ireland,âof her economy rather than
her politics,âI have been perplexed by some of
the difficulties which at present beset all who
would communicate with the public on her behalf.
It is impossible to foresee while writing what
may have happened, before our thoughts are
printed, to change the aspect of affairs, and
modify the counsel we would offer. No pains
have been spared to ascertain the correctness of
the data on which my story is constructed; yet
I have felt through the whole course of it that
I might finally resolve to keep it back as useless,
there being a strong probability that it might, a
few weeks hence, appear antiquated in comparison
with the treatises which may then be wanted.
I cannot but trust, however, that leisure will soon
be spared from the consideration of emergencies
for an investigation into the long subsisting
causes of Irish distress; that the painful labour
of punishing crime may give place to the more
hopeful task of superseding it; and that the

ii
government may ere long turn from enforcing
obnoxious laws to fostering the resources of the
country.

Many will think with me that the title of this
story is too grand for its contents; and more
may be disappointed on finding how few are my
personages, and how little I have dealt with the
horrors of the time.âThe purpose of my title is
to direct the work into the hands of those whom it
most concerns; and my personages are few because
it is my object to show, in a confined space,
how long a series of evils may befall individuals in
a society conducted like that of Ireland, and by
what a repetition of grievances its members are
driven into disaffection and violence. As for the
incidents of the tale, my choice was influenced
by the consideration, not of what would best
suit the purposes of fiction, but of what would
most serve the cause of the Irish poor. A much
more thrilling and moving story might have
been made of conspiracy, rebellion, and slaughter
by weapon and by gibbet; but these scenes
want no further development than may be found
in our daily newspapers; while the silent miseries
of the cottier, the unpitied grievances of the
spirit-broken labourer cannot have been sufficiently
made known, since they still subsist. These
miseries, protracted from generation to generation,
are the origin of the more lively horrors of
which everybody hears. Let them be superseded,
and there will be an end of the rebellion
and slaughter which spring from them.

Now that it is the fashion with a certain portion

iii
of society to denounce every exposition of
state impolicy as inflammatory, I may be exposed
to the common charge of attempting to excite
the disaffection, some of whose causes I have
attempted to expose. Since it is no longer a
secret, however, that Ireland has been and is
misgoverned, and since the readiest method of
winning back the discontented to their allegiance
is to allow those things to be grievances
which are felt to be so, and to show a disposition
to afford redress, I cannot but hold the part of
true loyalty to be to expose abuses fearlessly and
temperately, and to stimulate the government to
the reparation of past errors and the improvement
of its principles of policy. Such should be
my loyalty if I had access to the councils of the
state; and such it is now that I can speak only
as a wellwisher to Ireland, and an indignant
witness of her wrongs.

Chapter I.
Â
IRISH ECONOMY.

The Glen of the Echoes,âa title which conveys
more to an English ear than its Irish counterpart,
is one of the most obscure districts of a
remote county of the Green Island, of which
little is heard on this side the Channel except
during the periodical returns of famine, when the
sole dependence of its miserable population is on
public benevolence. This glen probably owes its
name to its vicinity to the sea, whose boisterous
waves, keeping up a perpetual assault, have
worn the coast into deep bays from the North
Cape to Mizen-head, and whose hoarse music is
chaunted day and night, summer and winter,
from steep to steep along the shore. It is a
rare thing for a traveller in the western counties
of Ireland to behold a calm sea. Whatever the
features of the land may be,âwhether he passes
through meadows and oat-fields, with villages and
towns in the distance, or over black mountains
and across shaking bogs, where a mud cabin
here and there is the only vestige of human

2
habitation,âthe Atlantic is still swelling and
lashing the cliffs, as if bringing its mighty force
to a perpetual war against the everlasting hills.
Such a traveller would have pronounced that the
Glen of the Echoes was designed for no other
purpose than to give perpetual tidings of this
warfare; for no place could be more wild in
aspect, or less apparently improved by being
inhabited. It was a tract lying between the
cliffs and the mountains, consisting partly of
bog, and partly of cultivated patches of land,
divided one from another by ditches, and here
and there by a turf bank, which was the best
kind of fence used within many miles, except
on the grounds belonging to one or two mansions
within sight and reach. Scarce a tree or a
shrub was to be seen within the bounds of the
glen, though tradition related that a vast forest
had once extended along the sides of the mountains;
which tradition was confirmed by the circumstance
that trees were easily found in the
bog as often as the inhabitants were at a loss
how to pass a ditch or drain, and there happened
to be hands enough near to make a half-buried
trunk into a temporary bridge, for the advantage
of a short cut to any given spot. A resident
proprietor, Mr. Rosso, had surrounded his house
with young plantations; but as these were intercepted
from view by the shoulder of the mountain,
they did not relieve the bleakness of the
glen itself. The woods of another proprietor,
Mr. Tracey, who had been for some years on the
continent with his family, had been so effectually

3
thinned by his agent, that little of them remained,
and, in consequence, his mansion, Woodland
Lodge, might now have better borne the
name of a lodge in the wilderness. Woodland
Lodge was about half a mile distant from Mr.
Rossoâs dwelling, and the contrast between the
two was remarkable. The riding, driving, shooting,
and fishing parties, in which the young
Rossos were perpetually engaged, gave an appearance
of bustle to the neighbourhood of their
residence; and the fine growth of the plantations,
the entireness of the stone fences, and the
verdant crops of the surrounding fields, betokened
good management: whereas the shutters of the
Lodge were for ever closed; grass flourished
on the door-steps, and moss on the window-sills;
lean cattle were seen lying about in the woods,
or rubbing themselves against the bark-bound
trees; and goats, the most inveterate of destroyers,
browsed among the ruins, which alone
remained to mark the boundaries between corn-land
and pasture, plantation and bog. The travellerâs
greatest perplexity was as to where the
people dwelt whom he saw scattered in the fields
or lying about on the only visible track by which
he could traverse the glen, or assembled around
the Lodge chapel, if it chanced to be a holiday.
It was only by close observation that he could
perceive any other erections than the little school-house,
built by Mr. Rosso, and the farm-house,
where a tenant of the better sort lived, and where
the priest boarded. To the accustomed eye,
however, a number of huts were visible on the

4
mountain side, which were more like tufts of
black turf than human dwellings. An occasional
wreath of smoke, the neighbourhood of goats,
pigs, or a starved cow, marked them as the abodes
of the tenantry of the glen,âa tenantry neither
better nor worse off than that of many a district
in the island.

The school-house just mentioned had been
built by Mr. Rosso, who, though himself a Protestant,
wished his poor neighbours to have such
an education as they were willing to receive,
though it was mixed with much that appeared to
him very baneful superstition. To the astonishment,
first, of the objects of his bounty, and,
next, of his Protestant visitors, he appointed a
Catholic teacher to this school, and interfered no
further in its management than to see that the
teacher was diligent, and that the school was
kept open to as many children as chose to
attend. The reasons he gave were, that there
were none but Catholics within five miles, out of
his own house, and that as his neighbours would
at all events be Catholics, he saw no harm in
giving them reading, writing, and arithmetic, in
addition to that instruction, of a different kind,
which their zealous priest, Father Glenny, took
care that they should not be without. These
reasons, whether sound or not, had no weight
with his Protestant friends, who might, as they
said, have forgiven him, if he had had the good
of a tenantry of his own in view, but who began
to doubt the goodness of his religion, morals,
and politics, when they considered that he had

5
no tenantry but a farmerâs family or two, who
did not need his assistance; and that he was,
therefore, gratuitously offering support to the
most damnable faith in religion, and the most
iniquitous creed in politics, that had ever deserved
the wrath of God in heaven and of man upon
earth. Mr. Rosso very quietly went on, holding
an occasional conference with Father Glenny on
the state of the school, and stepping in sometimes
as he passed, to hear how the spelling
improved, and whether the children could be
induced to give attention to something besides
arithmetic, which is, almost universally, the
favourite accomplishment of the Irish who have
had the advantage of any schooling at all.
Father Glenny, and the young schoolmaster
whom he had trained, always appeared glad to
see Mr. Rosso, and even asked him occasionally
to address the children, which he always took
care to do so as to convey to them some useful
information, or moral impression, which Protestant
and Catholic would equally allow to be
good. Thus, as the parties concerned wrought
their benevolent work without jostling or jarring,
it mattered little what any one else had to say
about it. When importuned upon the subject,
Mr. Rosso endeavoured to appease the inquirer
by an acknowledgment that he might have
found some difficulty if Protestant children had
been brought to learn with Catholics, within so
small a space, and with so few resources in the
way of instruction; but he never could admit

6
the doubt of its being right to supply a Catholic
education to a purely Catholic population.

It was a much easier matter to the neighbouring
cottiers to spare their children to the school,
than it would have been if they had enjoyed a
more prosperous condition. An English labourer
employs his boys and girls as soon as they are
strong enough for work; or, at least, has the
excuse that he may do so: but an Irish cottier
finds his business finished when he has dug and
planted his potato-field, and lounges about till
harvest; or, if he hires himself out to labour,
does not find out that there is anything for his
girl to do but to milk the cow and boil the pot;
or for his boy but to feed the pig. This leisure,
joined with the eagerness for learning which
subsists among the Irish poor, kept Mr. Rossoâs
school always full, and might, under good management,
have wrought a material improvement
upon the rising generation: but it is too much
the way with Irish âscholardsâ to be always
reading, never learning; to be listening to
legends, when they should be gaining knowledge;
and invoking the holy blood of Abel,
instead of improving the powers which God has
given to each of them for a far more natural and
effectual dependence. The real advancement of
the young folks of the glen was, therefore, much
less than it ought to have been, in return for the
time bestowed; and though some came out
ready readers, and most fluent story-tellers, there
was but little knowledge even among the oldest
of them.

7
Dora Sullivan was one of the most promising
of the troop, and the master praised the prudence
of her parents, and her own docility, for
coming to the school as regularly as ever when
she was past sixteen. It was feared that she
would disappear when her only brother departed
for England, in hopes of making a little money
to bring back to his father; but Doraâs parents
were proud of her, and anxious that the most
should be made of her, and, therefore, spared
her from home for the greater part of every day,
though she was now like an only child to them.
There was another reason for their not grudging
her absence, which was, that Dan Mahony, who
lived in the next cabin, and had frequent access
to Doraâs society, from being the son of her
fatherâs partner in his lease, had been long in
love with Dora, and would have married her out
of hand, if he had had so much as half an acre
of ground to marry upon. All parties approved
of the match; but would not hear of its taking
place till Dan had a roof of his own to lodge a
wife under, and did what they could to separate
the young folks, by keeping Dora at school, and
encouraging Dan to go and seek his fortune at
a distance for a while; which the young man,
after much murmuring, consented to do, upon a
promise from both fathers that they would abstain
from quarrelling about their partnership, or
anything else, during his absence: a promise
which they afterwards declared it was rash to
have given, and next to impossible to observe.
They contrived, however, to keep within the

8
terms of their vow, by venting their wrath, in
all difficulties, upon the third partner in their
lease, Tim Blayney, who made an opportunity
to elope before rent-day came round, leaving
nothing but an empty cabin and a patch of
exhausted soil for his creditors to wreak their
vengeance on.

These partnership tenancies were almost universal
in the district. In one or two cases there
were as many as fourteen or sixteen tenants
associated in one lease: in which case the disputes
respecting the division of their little meadows,
or the payment of dues, became so virulent,
that the agent could get no rest from squabbles
and complaints in his occasional visits; and the
middlemen, to whom the rent was paid, adopted
the practice of getting it as they could, without
waiting for the decision of opposing claims, or
regarding the protests of those whose property
they seized. Sullivan might think himself fortunate
in having no more than two partners,
since he could not be made to pay more than
three times his share of rent; and being under
vow not to quarrel with one partner, and the
other being beyond the reach of his ears and
tongue, he was in an enviable situation compared
with many of his neighbours. As to the middlemen
who were over them, indeed, there was
little to choose among them. All pleaded alike
that they had their rents to pay to other middlemen,
or to the landlord; all were too busy to
hearken to excuses,âtoo determined to be
diverted from seizures,âtoo much accustomed to

9
their business to regard appeals to their justice
or their compassion. They were not all, or on
all occasions, equally pressing as to time. Their
urgency about their dues depended somewhat
upon their own resources, and much on those of
the people under them. If they could afford to
wait, and their debtors were likely not to be
totally destitute sometime hence, the middlemen
mercifully consented to wait, for certain considerations,
and with the prospect of extorting
rich interest upon the payment thus delayed.
The middleman, Teale, to whom Sullivan, Mahony,
and Blayney paid their rents, was one of
this merciful class.

When Dora came home from the school one
fine afternoon, she perceived from a distance,
that Mr. Tealeâs horse was standing within the
inclosure, and grazing the roof of her fatherâs
cabin. Her approach was seen by Teale from
the door, for there was never a window in the
place. His humour being propitiatory this day,
he assailed Sullivanâs weak side:â

âHere she comes,âthe pretty creature she is,
that Dora of yours.â

âSheâs good, let alone her being pretty; and
âtis she will write the note and sign it all the
same as me. Here, Dora, my darling, hold the
pen and write as youâre bid, and show what a
scholard Father Glenny has made of you.â

Dora, who was remarkably quiet and thoughtful
for her years, and suited her deportment to
the gravity of her mind, did not quicken her
movements, but prepared to obey her fatherâs

10
request. She slipped down the petticoat tail
which she had worn as a hood, gave the pig a
gentle rebuke with her bare foot, which sent him
out at the door, and room being thus found to
turn about in, she made a table of her motherâs
low stool, took the paper Mr. Teale offered,
dipped her pen in his inkhorn, and waited for
directions.

âYou have only to sign, you see,â said Mr.
Teale, ââDora Sullivan, for John Sullivan,â
thatâs all.â

âHold your whisht,â cried the father: âyou
have had your time to write promises for me,
Mr. Teale; but Iâve a scholard now of my own
kin, and no occasion to be taken in with a scrap,
when I donât know whatâs in it. So let Dora
write after your words, Mr. Teale.â

âPho, pho, Sullivan;âfor what and for why
do you misdoubt me this day? Miss Dora will
be more politeâand I so pressed for time.â

Doraâs politeness, however, disposed her to do
as her father desired, and did not prevent her
doing more. She wrote to Tealeâs dictation;
and, before signing, looked up at her father, and
asked if it was meant that he should promise to
pay, both for himself and partners, all that should
be in arrears, as well as all presently due (including
the interest of the arrears), immediately
after harvest, under penalty of seizure.

âIâm not clear of the meaning of it all, but
Iâm thinking it is much to pay, and more than
we have to pay with, father; thatâs all.â

âBe easy, Miss Dora, since it comes out of

11
your own mouth that the meaning is not clear.
Only sign, my jewel; thatâs what is still to be
done.â

âBut, fatherâââ

âQuiet, my darling of the world, quiet! for
what should I do? Hereâs Blayney, the scatterbrain!
gone, the devil knows where, and left
not a rag behind him; and Mahony has left the
whole to me, entirely, the ruffian. And you
wouldnât have the beasts driven away, Dora, and
we left without a sup to sleep uponâyou
wouldnât, Dora?â

âCome, sign, my jewel,â said Teale, âand up
with your pail to be milking the creatures, Dora,
and thatâs better than seeing them lifted to the
pound.â

Dora still balanced the pen, vainly wishing
that Dan was at hand to fulfil his fatherâs part of
the contract. Sullivan urged her to finish. She
begged to read it over once more aloud, and at
the end asked if there was no way of making
such an agreement as many made, that certain
kinds of produce should constitute the rent,
while the family lived as they could upon the
rest, and so have nothing to do with coin, which
she simply supposed was the cause of all the
misery in the world. Some middlemen, she
knew, took butter and pigs for the rent, and oats
where there were any, and then there was no
trouble about money.

âWith your leave, Miss Dora, weâll hear
what the priest has to say about that another
time; for I suppose what you say is all one as

12
listening to him; and very natural: but I must
be going, my jewel; so give me my scrap, and
no more words.â

As there was no help for it, Dora signed, and
then saw the pen put into her fatherâs hand, that
he might make his mark, without which Mr.
Teale would not allow the business to be finished.
She did not smile, as her mother did, at Sullivanâs
joke about a raking fellow, like him, sitting
down with a pen, like a priest or one of the
priestâs scholards. When the middleman was
gone, and her father laughed at the easiness of
putting a man off with a scrap of paper instead
of the rent, she took up her pail to go and milk
her lean kine.

âOff with you, honey, and leave your sighs
behind you,â said her mother. âIf I had begun
as early as you, sighing and sighing, there would
have been little breath left in my body by this.
To-morrow or next day will do for care, honey.
Go to your milking to-day, anyhow.â

âBy dad, honey, your mother known more
trouble and sorrow by your time nor you, by
reason she was my wife, and had babbies to lose
in the fever. I would have dried up her tears in
a hurry if she had had no more to bestow them
on nor you; and so will Dan, by dad, if youâve
no better a welcome for him.â

Dora smiled, and went about her dairy affairs,
her father following to help, in case the kine
wanted lifting; that is, in case they should be
too weak from starvation to rise up at bidding
to be milked. The poor animals being fairly

13
set upon their legs, without much fear of falling,
Sullivan directed his steps towards the last bush
which was left in his field, and cut it down for
fuel, not having turf enough dried to boil the pot
this evening.

Sullivan was not very fond of looking about
him on his little farm, or of observing the portions
of his partners. It was hard to say which
was in the worst condition, or which might have
been in the best if properly cultivated. Their
nearness to the coast put them in the way of
manure; such part of the soil as was dry might
have been made into fine grazing land by the
frequent rains which fell in that district, or have
answered for the growth of various crops in
rotation; and such as was wet might have been
improved, to almost any extent, by the limestone
from the neighbourhood, or by fine sand from
the beach. Instead of laying plans with prudence
for their common advantage, however, and
prosecuting them in harmony, the three partners
made choice each of what his land should produce,
and neither varied his crop from first to
last. Their only agreement was to divide their
portions by ditches, pronouncing a stone fence
a trouble not to be thought of, turf banks a
botheration, and a ditch the most âasy and nate
to the hand.â This done, Mahony sowed barley
every year, and every year less and less came
up; and that which did make a shift to grow
yielded less and less meal, till he began to wonder
what ailed the crop that it had come down
from being food for man, to be nothing better

14
than pigâs meat. Blayney tried his hand at oat
culture with no better success than his neighbour,
the produce being such as many a horse
on the London road would look upon with disdain.
Sullivan grew potatoes, as we have seen.
While the land was in good heart, that is, for a
season or two from the commencement of his
lease, he had grown apple potatoes; but when
the soil became exhausted, he could raise only
an inferior kind, which is far more fit for cattle
than for men, and on which he and his family
could not have subsisted, if it were not for the
milk with which they varied their meals. Sullivanâs
acre and half did not yield now more than
eleven hundred stone; and as the consumption
amounted to more than four stone a-day, at
fourteen pounds to the stone,âa very moderate
allowance for three hearty people,âthere was
no chance of paying the rent out of the crop,
even if Sullivan had been answerable for nobodyâs
dues but his own. He depended upon
his live stock to clear him with the middlemen;
or, rather, he depended upon nothing, but made
a shift, when the time came near, to sell and
raise the money somehow; and when that could
not be done, he deferred the evil day, by giving
his note of hand, as we have seen. Half these
difficulties might have been avoided, if no one
had stood between Sullivan and his landlord;
and the other half, if he had known how to
make the best of his own resources. In the
first place, Mr. Tracey would never have thought
of asking such a rent as eight pounds per acre

15
for such land; and, in the next place, he would
have been so far considerate as to encourage
Sullivan to improve the land; whereas the middleman
under whom Mr. Teale held the place,
paid the landlord a moderate rent, and made his
profit out of the higher rent he asked of Mr.
Teale, who, in his turn, did the same by Sullivan
and his partners: so that the poorest tenant paid
the most, and the landlord got the least; or, to
put the matter in another light, the little farm
was expected to support three families of tenants,
and to pay rent to three landlords. Again: two
of these landlords, having only a temporary interest
in the place, cared only for getting as
much out of it as they could while connected
with it, and had no view to its improvement, or
regard for its permanent value. This ruinous
system has received a check by the operation of
the Subletting Act; but not before it has inflicted
severe injuries on the proprietors of the soil, and
never-to-be-forgotten hardships on their tenantry.

Chapter II.

IRISH LIABILITIES.

Dan Mahony being fairly out of the way, Doraâs
parents agreed to her earnest request, countenanced
by Father Glenny, that she might leave
school, and try to earn somewhat wherewith to

16
help the rent. Dora now sat at her spinning-wheel
almost the whole day; and her mother
doing the same, a respectable addition was made
by them to the few shillings Sullivan had been
able to muster. The next was a fine potato
season moreover, and Sullivan reasonably reckoned
on being able to sell a considerable portion
of the produce of his land, and thus preventing
any addition to the arrears already due, even if
he could not discharge some part of them. The
gentle Dora now smiled, instead of sighing,
when her father asked where was the good of
âtroubling the brain at all at all about what was
to come, when the good and the bad was hid
entirely;â and answered only by a kiss, when
he inquired for any good that had come out of
the hitherto grave looks of his âdarlinâ oâ the
world.â

The rent for the year was made up just in
time by the sale of only one pig; and Mr. Teale
was surprised, and looked as if he did not know
whether or not to be pleased, when the sum was
forthcoming. He congratulated Sullivan on
having got a solvent partner in Blayneyâs place,
and on Dan Mahony having sent his father the
means of paying his share; so that Sullivan was
free from all encumbrance but that for which he
had given his note of hand. Doraâs heart leaped
within her, while she listened to the facts, and to
her fatherâs fervent blessing on her lover, whose
heart was evidently still at home, wherever his
feet might be wandering. She did not know,âfor
her father had actually forgotten to tell her,âthat

17
the tithe was not yet paid, nor had been
for two years; the tithe-proctor having accommodated
him by taking his note-of-hand for the
amount, and for various incidental charges.
Bitterly did Dora afterwards grieve that she had
been for a while spared this additional anxiety.

The next time she returned from confession,
it was with a light heart and a tripping step approaching
to a dance. Father Glenny had readily
absolved her from the sins of mistrusting
heaven in regard of her fatherâs rent, and mistrusting
a holy and solemn oath in regard of
Dan Mahony, having, in dark hours, been
tempted to doubt his remembering the Glen of
the Echoes, and all that was in it; which was a
great sin, inasmuch as Dan had vowed a solemn
vow, which heaven would guard, to look upon
himself as a banished wanderer, till she should,
face to face, release him from the oath. Father
Glenny not only gave her absolution, and taught
her how to keep the tempter at a distance next
time, by repeating the oath, and recalling the
circumstances under which it was made, but
spoke well of Dan, and seemed to think the
sooner all doubts were laid, by their being made
man and wife, the better.

Dora immediately began to obey his directions
by recalling, during her walk home, the
minutest circumstances connected with the vow.
She could just discern, at the highest point of the
rugged mountain-road, the big stone under which
they knelt when she was obliged to leave him to
pursue his way alone: she could mark the very

18
spot where she had given him the âPoesy of
prayers,â and where they had exchanged their
crucifixes, and called six very choice saints to
witness the vow. While gazing in this direction,
shading her eyes from the setting sun, she
perceived men driving two cows up this very
road, sometimes pulling the poor creatures by a
noose over the obstructions in their way, and
sometimes lifting them up as fast as they fell.
Doraâs lightness of heart was gone in a moment.
From the circumstance of there being several
men to take charge of two cows, she was convinced
that the cattle had been distrained from
some tenant in the Glen; and she had a misgiving
that they might be her own fatherâs.

When she came within sight of home, she did
not know what to make of the appearance of
things. The cows were not visible; but they
were apt to disappear among the ditches, or
behind the cabin. Her father gave tokens of
merriment; but with rather more activity than
was natural to him. He was throwing stones
and bits of turf at the pigs in the ditches, so as
to make them run hither and thither, and singing,
to drown their squeaking, in the following
strain:â

âYouâre welcome to the beasts for sale;

For the devil take me if I go to gaol.

My wife and they riz a mournful lowing,

And they looked jist in my eyes so knowing.

So now keep away, if you plase, thatâs all;

And the curse oâ Jasus light on ye all!â

This song, as soon as the words were distinguishable,

19
told a pretty plain story, and the
occupation of Doraâs mother told a yet plainer.
She was breaking up the milk-pails to feed the
fire; and, in answer to the girlâs remonstrance,
demanded what was the use of vexing their sight
with what would be tempting them to thirst, and
putting them in mind to curse the âscruff of the
earthâ that had robbed them of their kine? But
could not the cattle be got back again?âLord
save her! when did she ever know Mr. Teale
give up anything he had clutched? Mr. Teale!
he who had just been paid? Even so. He was
behind-hand with his dues, like the people he
scorned beneath his feet; and instead of seizing
his car, horses, or the luxuries of his house, the
man who was over him distrained upon the poor
tenants, who had already paid their rents; while
Teale looked on, amused to see the Sullivans
and others compelled to pay rent twice over,
while he escaped. The people having, in former
cases, discovered that this monstrous grievance
is not known in England, had, for some time,
come to the conclusion that England is favoured
by Government, while there is no justice to be
had in Ireland; not being aware that the law is
the same in both countries, and that the exemption
from this fatal liability which English cultivators
enjoy, is owing to the rarity of the practice
of subletting in their island.

It soon appeared that Teale was disappointed
in the amount of the levy upon his tenants, since
the same men returned early in the morning to
take what else they could get, by virtue of the

20
note-of-hand. The crop, just ready for gathering
in, was dug up and carted away, a small
provision only being left for the immediate wants
of the family. The fowls and pigs disappeared
at the same time; and to all the hubbub which
disturbed the morning hours, the deep curses of
Sullivan, the angry screams of his wife, the
cackling of the alarmed poultry, the squealing
of the pigs, and the creaking of the crazy cars,
there succeeded a hush, which was only interrupted
by the whirring of Doraâs wheel. She
had taken to her spinning, partly to conceal her
tears, partly to drown thoughts which would
otherwise have almost distracted her.

The ominous quiet of the cabin did not last
long. Sullivan was sitting, so as to block up
the doorway, with his back against the mud-wall;
he was chewing a straw, and looking out
vacantly upon his trampled field, when his wife
started up from her seat beside the fire-place,
where the pot of cold potatoes was hanging over
an extinguished fire. She greeted him with a
tremendous kick.

âGet out oâ that, you cratur!â cried she.
âIâm thinking thereâs room and a plenty beyond
there, let alone the styes with not a soul of a pig
in them. Get out with ye!â

âGive over, honey, or it will be the worse
for ye,â said Sullivan. âItâs my own place
where Iâm lying entirely, and the prospect beyond
is not so pleasing to the eye as it was,
honey: thatâs all.â

âThe moreâs the reason you should be bestirring

21
yourself, like me, to hide whatâs left us in
the bog.â

âWhat do you mean, if your soul is not gone
astray?â inquired the husband.

âWork, work! if youâd save a gun, or a bed,
or a bottle of spirits from the proctor. Into the
bog with âem, if you wouldnât have him down
upon you, hearing, as he will, how little is left
to pay the tithe. Leave off, I tell you,â she
shouted to poor Dora; âwhisht, and give over
with your whirring and whirring, that wearies
the ears of me. Leave off, or by this and that,
Iâll make you sorry.â

Dora did her best to understand the evil to be
apprehended, and to guard against it. She
roused her father from his posture of affected
ease, sought out a hiding-place among the
rushes in a waste tract, where they might stow
their household goods, and helped to strip the
dwelling as actively as if they had been about
to remove to a better abode. While her father
and she were laden with the chest which contained
her motherâs bridal provision of bed-linen,
which had thus far been preserved from forfeiture,
a clapping of hands behind them made them
turn and observe a sign that enemies were at
hand.

âBy the powers, here they come,â cried her
father. âWork, work, for the bare life, my jewel.
In with it, and its back weâd be going with as innocent
faces as if weâd been gathering rushes.
Here, pull your lap full.â

22
Dora could not at first tell whether their
movements had been observed.

âGod save you, kindly, Mr. Shehan,â said
Sullivan to the proctor. â
Itâs
Itâs
just in time youâd
be come to see the new way of thatching we have
got, and these gentlemen to take a lesson, may
be. Dora, my jewel, throw down the rushes and
get some more out of hand.â

âOne of my gentlemen shall go with her,â
said Shehan. âThere are things among the
rushes sometimes, Sullivan, that fill a house as
well as thatch it.â

Dora invited any of the gentlemen to help her,
and led the way to a rush bank, in an opposite
direction; but, declining to follow her lead, they
entered the house, and laughed, when they found
it completely empty.

âYouâre grown mightily afraid of the sky,
Sullivan,â observed Shehan, âsince youâd be after
mending your thatch, sooner than getting a bed
to lie on, to say nothing of a bit and sup, which
I donât see you have to be boasting of.â

All Sullivanâs good reasons why he should
suddenly mend his thatch with rushes that lay
âconvaynientâ went for nothing with the proctor,
who had caught a glimpse of the stratagem.
The claim for tithes, arrears, and fees was urged,
certain ominous-looking papers produced, and no
money being forthcoming, the goods were found
and carried off, even down to Doraâs wheel, with
the flax upon it. The proctor gave no heed to the
despair of the destitute tenants, but rather congratulated

23
himself on having heard of the former
seizures in time to appropriate what remained.

Of those whom he had left behind, the father
lay down once more in the doorway, declaring
himself nigh hand brokenhearted, and melancholy
entirely; his wife went about to interest the
neighbours in their wrongs; and Dora kneeled
at her prayers in the darkest corner of the cabin.
After a time, when the twilight began to thicken,
her father started up in great agitation, and dared
somebody outside to come in and see what he could
find for rent, or tithes, or tolls, or tax of any kind.
His creditors might come swarming as thick as
boys going to a fair, but they would find nothing,
thanks to the proctor: unless they carried him
off bodily, they might go as they came, and he
would try whose head was the hardest before it
came to that. Dora perceived that her father
was in too great a passion to listen to one who
seemed not to be a creditor; and she went to the
door to interpose. More quick-sighted than her
father, she instantly saw, through the dim light,
that it was Dan; and not even waiting for the
assurance of his voice, threw herself on his neck,
while he almost stifled her with caresses.

âDan, are you come back true? Just speak
that word.â

âTrue as the saints to the blessed, darling of
my heart.â

âThen God is merciful to send you now, for
we want true friends to raise us up, stricken as
we are to the bare ground.â

âBare ground, indeed,â cried Dan, entering

24
and looking for a resting-place, on which to
deposit the sobbing and clinging Dora. âThey
have used you basely, my heartâs life, but trust
to me to make it up in your own way to each of
you. You trust me, Dora, donât you, as the priest
gave leave?â

Dora silently intimated her trust in her loverâs
faith, which it had never entered her head to
doubtâlove having thus far been entirely unconnected
in her mind with thoughts of the worldâs
gear. She wept on his shoulder, leaving it to
her father to tell the story of their troubles, and
only looked up when she heard her motherâs
voice approaching, to ask, with great simplicity,
what they were to do next?

âTo be married in the morning, if father Glenny
was at hand, and consenting,â her lover replied.
He had two guineas in his pocket for the fees;
and then they would be all on a footing, (as he
had no more money,) and must help one another
to justice and prosperity as well as they could.
Sullivan interposed a few prudent objections,
but soon gave up when he found his little Dora
was against him. The fact was, that her filial
duty, religion, and love, all plied her at once
in favour of an immediate marriage. She had
always had a firm faith that Dan could achieve
anything he pleased; a faith which was much
confirmed by his having paid his fatherâs rent,
and saved, moreover, enough for his marriage
fees. It appeared to her that Providence had
sent this able helper in the time of her parentsâ
need, and that it was not for her to prevent his

25
lifting them out of poverty as speedily as might
be.

Dan told them that there was to be a letting of
land in the neighbourhood, the next day; and
that if he was made sure in time of having Dora
for his cabin-keeper, he would bid for an acre or
two, and did not doubt to do as well in the world
as his father before him. Of all this, Doraâs
mother, on her return, seemed to have no more
doubt than the rest of the party; and she immediately
dismissed all her cares, except the regret
that she could not walk so far as to see her
daughter married. Dan was now requested to
name his hour for departure in the morning, and
to go home to his father, who had had but a hasty
glimpse of him on his return. He busied himself
in obtaining some clean dry straw and a rush
candle for his poverty-stricken friends, overwhelmed
Dora with caresses, and ran home.

Dora had little imagined, two hours before,
with what a light heart she should lie, this night,
on the cold floor of their bare cabin. To have
Dan to lean upon was everything. She could
not admit any further fear for the future. They
had only to begin the world again, that was all;
and with the advantage, too, of Danâs experience
and skill in getting money; which it did not
occur to her, might be of no avail, where no
money could be got, or where it passed immediately
into the hands of one tyrannical claimant or
another. This ease from apprehension formed the
substratum of her happy thoughts of this night;
and it was her filial piety, only, which made the

26
matter of so much importance to her. For herself,
it was enough that Dan was her own.
She had not a wish beyond what would be bestowed
by the priestâs office and blessing, which
she hoped so soon to have obtained.

Father Glenny, though at first surprised at
being called on to perform the marriage ceremony
so early in the morning, and before so few
witnesses, and mortified on behalf of the young
folks, that the customary revelry and sanction
of numbers must be dispensed with in their case,
had nothing to say against the proceeding.
Having ascertained that the friends of both parties
approved, he went on to exhort the young couple
to remember that they were now in the act of
fulfilling a divine command, and to trust for the
blessing of God on their union accordingly. He
then performed the ceremony and dismissed them;
the bridegroom having taken care, as a point of
honour, that the priest should not lose much in
respect of fees, the amount being tendered by
the parties instead of collected from an assemblage
of guests. Father Glenny did not refuse the
offering. He was unwilling to wound the feelings
of the offerers: he was not aware of the extent
of their poverty; and, moreover, considered the
fees his due, even more than a Protestant clergyman
would have done in a similar instance,âthe
remuneration of the Catholic clergy in Ireland
being principally derived from marriage fees.

The pressure of the times obliged the proceedings
of the whole party to be more businesslike
than is at all usual on the day of an Irish

27
wedding. The bridegroom stayed but to give his
Dora into her motherâs arms, and then set off,
accompanied by Sullivan, for the place where two
or three lots of ground were to be let by auction,
or, as the phrase goes, by cant.

They were just in time to take a survey of the
lots before bidding. There was small choice of
advantages; for the preceding tenants, knowing
that they need not hope for a renewal, and that
the mode of letting by cant would, in all probability,
turn them out of the place, had exhausted
the land to the utmost for the last two or three
years. This measure not only gave them as
much as they could obtain for the time, but
afforded a chance of getting the lot back again
on cheaper terms. The excessive competition
which is usual on such occasions, however, made
this last hope a very doubtful one. The only
thing that was certain beforehand was, that the
affair would prove a very bad bargain to all
parties:âto the landlord, because his land was
nearly ruined, and little rent would, therefore, be
paid, however much was promised; to the successful
bidder, because he would be unable to
fulfil his absurd promises about the rent, and be
therefore liable to driving, distraint, or ejectment;
and to the unsuccessful bidders, because they had
come a great way, full of hopes and visions of
being able to settle on the land, and must return
destitute as they came, and disappointed.

A crowd surrounded the man of power, as soon
as he appeared on the ground. Many an offering
had he had that morning of dutiful service, of

28
overstrained civility, or of something more substantial,
from those who could afford it, with the
hope of inclining him to favour their particular bid.
The most diversified claims to a preference were
whispered into his ear, or exhibited before his eyes,
wherever he went. One had picked up the landlordâs
heir, when thrown by his pony into a bog
in childhood; another had had the honour of
lodging the agent, one stormy night, among the
mountains. One limped ostentatiously before
Mr. Flanagan, to remind him that the lameness
happened from one of the landlordâs fences having
fallen upon him, while dozing beneath its shelter;
another, a feeble old man, pleaded a yet unfulfilled
promise of a Mr. Tracey who had been in his
grave nearly thirty years.

Mr. Flanagan took no further notice of all this
than to bid the people get out of his way. From
many a clutch did he disengage his skirts; on
many a petition, savoured with a scent of potheen,
did he turn his back; many a venerable blue topcoat,
and gray cloak, did he elbow from his side,
before he could proceed to business. When once
begun, it required an eye as practised, and an
ear as inured, as his, to distinguish that any
business was proceeding, amidst the hubbub of
voices, the shoving, jostling, and scrambling,
which took place while the bidding went on.
The confusion fairly baffled some lookers on, who
stopped their horses on the outskirts of the crowd
to observe the scene. Mr. Alexander Rosso, just
from college, his brother Henry, and a foreign
gentleman, a college friend of the former, were

29
taking their morning ride, surrounded by their
dogs, when it occurred to Alexander, that this was
the occasion on which to exhibit to his friend the
resemblance between the Irish and his countrymen.
He was scarcely aware that the occasion
on which the people were assembled was similar
to that which often collects the Italian peasantry
in groups, to contend with equal vehemence for
slips of land, which they hold on the same terms.
The Irish cottier is of the same class with the
metayer of Italy; and middlemen are, with few
exceptions, alike all the world over: they are
what it is natural to expect men to be under
circumstances of strong temptation to oppression
and of absolute impunity.

The Italian gentleman, after gazing with fixed
attention, and an amused expression of countenance,
for some minutes, used an expressive
gesture, to intimate that he could make nothing
of it.

âThe first lot is disposed of, Henry, is it not?â
asked Alexander. âThat half-naked, capering
fellow bid highest, I think.â

âYes,â replied Henry; âand he looks as if he
had just had the mines of Peru given him.â

âHe!â exclaimed the foreigner, in astonishment.
âAnd how will he pay?â

âNo one will pay all,â replied Henry, laughing.
âThe agent can only weigh probabilities;
and if he happens to know that that poor fellow
has a little coin hidden somewhere, to help him
on for a year or two, he will stop at his bidding
as the highest.â

30
âBut why stop? Is it not the peopleâs part to
stop?â

âWe might wait long enough for that,â replied
Alexander. âThey will bid against each
other till midnight. They will offer a hundred
per annum per acre rather than lose their chance
of getting the land. Our people are very rich in
promises.â

âAnd how much has the ragged man promised?â

âFlanagan!â shouted Henry, above the din,
which sank to silence in a moment, âhow much
has your first lot brought you?â

âNine pounds per acre, Sir, and yonder stands
the tenant.â

The successful bidder, came forward, smiling
and scraping, not a whit ashamed of the bare
knees which had burst through what had once
been breeches, or of the tatters which were bound
about his person, in various directions, by hay-ropes,
there being no other way of keeping them
together.

âAsk him,â urged the eager foreigner, âask
him where his pounds are to come from, and
why he wishes to be a farmer.â

âThere is most likely a lady in the case,â
observed Henry; and then turning to the man,
he inquired whether he had not done a very
daring thing in engaging to pay so high a yearly
sum?

âGod save your honour kindly, the mother is
turned out of her own, beyond there; and
itâs
itâs
a

31
cabin Iâm wishing to give her, old creature as
she is, and a bite and sup with me.â

âAnd is there nobody else, friend, likely to be
your cabin-keeper?â

The manâs countenance fell, and he replied
that there was to have been one last Shrovetide,
but that she was forcibly carried off, and married
to another man, before he could overtake her.
Henry turned the subject hastily, shocked at his
own curiosity, which had led to such a disclosure.
He asked the man whether he could honestly say
that he had a weekâs provision beforehand for
his mother and himself? The tenant laughed and
pointed to his new ground, saying that they might
glean potatoes enough among the ridges, after
the digging, to keep them for a few days till they
could look about them a bit. His mother moreover
had a cow, and a slip of a pig. He ended
by bewitchingly asking for the âblissenâ on his
enterprise. The foreigner was amused to observe
that in Ireland a blessing comes out of the pocket
instead of the mouth; not that the verbal blessing
is absolutely worthless; but it is considered
merely as an accessory to something more substantial.

The process of giving the blessing quickened
the bidding, as it was feared the gentlemen
might leave the ground before the next successful
candidate was ready to pay his smiling service.
The lot was awarded to Dan, who, after tossing
up his hat, advanced towards the horsemen, followed
by his father-in-law. They observed to
one another that he looked better qualified than

32
his predecessor to pay rent, his dress being
decent, and his manner betokening more forethought
and experience.

âHave you an old mother to find a shelter
for, too?â inquired Alexander.

âThereâs the mother and the father too thatâs
to the fore,â replied Dan, turning to introduce
Sullivan.

âAnd the darling too thatâs been his wife
almost since the sun rose,â added Sullivan. âDan
has had the priestâs blessing this morn, and sure
your honoursâ wonât be long in following?â

âI would have married in the evening, Dan,
if I had been you,â said Henry. âThe land
first, and then the girl, is the prudent way, you
know. How would you have managed, if you
had had the girl without the land?â

Dan could not pretend to guess what Providenceâs
other way of providing for him and
Dora would have been; the actual case was as
much as any man had to do with. This reasoning
put him in the actual case of receiving a large
blessing from the foreigner, who then rode off
with his companions, notwithstanding the vehement
prayers of the crowd that they would stay
till the third and last lot was disposed of. They
had neither time nor further blessing to spare
this day. They did not, however, escape by
turning their backs. The third new tenant was
posted in the middle of their road homewards,
and on their approach, extended his arms, as if
to embrace the three horses with their riders,
praying for an infinity of blessings on their

33
merciful and tender and bountiful hearts, and
expressing his expectation that he should begin
the world with a trifle from their honours, like
Pat and Dan.

âSee what you have done, Henry,â said his
brother. âWe shall be expected to pay tribute,
henceforward, to every new tenant, as often as a
cant takes place within twenty miles.â

Henry set himself seriously to explain that
their bounty of this day was purely accidental,
and that none of the party meant to give again
on a similar occasion. He would not dismiss
the present applicant without a gift, since his
companions had had one; but he gave him less
than the others, in order to enforce what he had
said. The man followed for some way, keeping
close in their rear in hope of their relenting, and
then retired to the road side, grumbling as if
defrauded of a right.

âIt is the most difficult thing in the world,â
observed Henry, âto deal with these people;
they have such strange notions of
right
. Every
favour is immediately considered as a precedent
to be for ever acted upon: every change in our
methods of doing kindness is looked upon as
caprice, and every suspension of a gratuity as
an injury.â

âThe same is the case in all regions,â observed
the foreigner, âwhere the people have other
dependence than on themselves. If it is remarkable
in Ireland and in Italy, it is because the
people of these unhappy countries have been
long educated by political injury to servile dependence.

34
It is for you to rectify their notions
of
right
.â

âHow must we do so?â

âYou must make their little possessions secure,
and also fortify their labours with the moral certainty
of a due reward. While this is being
done,âand it will be long in the doing,âyou
must vary your modes of charity perpetually, in
testimony of its being optional: and O, above all
things, save your poor from the blight of a legal
charity! Save them from the delusion that they
have a right, which, among a reckless people,
would presently absorb all other rights, making
cottiers of your middlemen, and beggars of your
landlords, and converting this fertile region into
a wilderness, which shall but echo the wild cry
of famine.â

Chapter III.

IRISH ADVENTURE.

The accidental bounty of the Mr. Rossos enabled
Dan to furnish himself with the few tools
he needed to begin his tillage, and his wife with
a wheel and a small stock of flax. As for
clothes, they were obliged to wear, day and
night, those they had on, having neither a
change for the day, nor a bed which might

35
supersede the use of them at night. This was
thought no great hardship by any of the family,
for it was a very common one. Many of their
neighbours never attempted to undress after
their garments had passed a certain point of
wear. The most tidy, who really did patch their
clothes very patiently while the patches would
hold together, were for the most part content,
after that time, to tie them on till they dropped
away in fragments. Their reason for not undressing
was one which their reproving superiors
could not gainsay;âthat, once off, no power on
earth could get the garments on again. This
was nearly the condition now of Sullivanâs clothing
and that of his wife; but they could scarcely
trouble themselves to think of such a trifle in the
midst of the affairs they were undertaking. New
life and spirit had been given them by the
timely support yielded by their connexion with
Dan; and they all, under his direction, gave full
play to the spirit of enterprise which ever distinguishes
the Irish when in prospect of an equitable
recompense of their exertions. Sullivan
might now be seen toiling as a labourer under
his son-in-law, thatching the cabin-roof (now
in earnest) with rushes from the sandbanks, or
bringing sand from the beach to work into the
boggy soil of the potato-field, or cutting turf
for fuel, or even carrying loads of it on his back
for sale. The first money thus gained went to
hire a pack-horse from one of Mr. Rossoâs
tenants, for the carrying out a further supply of
turf; and this answered so well, that Dan

36
finished by selling their own store, and making
fuel for home consumption, after the manner of
the Irish peasantry, when the turf in the neighbourhood
is exhausted; that is, by scraping up
what is left in the state of mire, and baking and
shaping it with the hand till it becomes dry enough
to be combustible. Their food was but poor as to
quantity and quality, till Dan thought himself
justified in adding a quarter of a cow to his
establishment; from which time, potatoes and
milk, milk and potatoes, were thought as good a
provision as they had a right to look for.

When that which is usually the idle season
came round, namely, the weeks which succeed the
potato-sowing, when nothing more is to be done
to the crop, Dan proposed a grand scheme to his
father-in-law,ânothing less than to enlarge their
cabin by adding a room at the end. Sullivan
smacked his lips, and stretched himself, somewhat
mortified to have his expected period of rest
broken in upon by new toils: but, remembering
that the summer nights were, indeed, somewhat
oppressive to four people sleeping within a space
of twelve feet by eight, with no air-hole but the
door; and looking forward, moreover, to the inconveniences
of Doraâs confinement in such a
place, he gave a groaning assent to the undertaking,
and went through his part of it with a
tolerable grace. He cursed, for his own sake,
however proud for his daughterâs, the grand
notions which Dan seemed to have about a cabin,
making the new apartment half as long again as
the old one, and leaving space in the mud wall

37
for a window. When finished, however, all was
right in his eyes, and he did not sigh, as did
the young folks, for yet more comforts; if
indeed, they were not rather necessaries. Dora
wished for a bed for her mother, who was growing
more and more weakly, and got little rest on her
bundle of straw. Dan wished for the same
comfort for Dora, but was obliged at present to
content himself with looking forward to the time
when they might increase their stock of fowls,
and obtain feathers enough from them, to sew
up in a sack, and make a bed of. He had a little
money by him, and was often tempted to spend it
in Doraâs behalf; but they both agreed that the
first necessity was, to keep out of the clutches of
the agent and the tithe proctor. Of paying the
whole rent, there was but little chance; but as
they had no partners, and as nobody near was
likely to pay better than themselves, they hoped
to satisfy the agent with such a proportion as
might fairly average what he was in the habit of
receiving in lieu of the nominal rent. On the
whole, they considered themselves going on âfair
and easy, and prosperous entirely.â

They had been nearly a year in their abode, the
rent-day was coming round, and many jokes were
continually suggested by that fruitful topic, when
Father Glenny looked in upon them, in the course
of his customary circuit among his people. Dora
came curtseying to the door to invite him to
repose himself on the turf seat within; her mother
rose feebly to pay her reverence as he entered,
and hoped he would be pleased to remain till

38
her husband and Dan returned; the one being at
work some way off, and the other having business
to settle with the agent. The priest, who looked
remarkably grave, assured her he was in no hurry,
and examined their countenances as if to discover
whether they had any thing particular to communicate.
As they waited, âmannerlyâ for him to
introduce his own topics, he began by remarking
on the improvements in the place, and enquiring
into the worldly condition of its inhabitants.
His countenance brightened as he listened to
their cheerful reports of their prospects, but he
still seemed uneasy till he had put one question.
Had Dan taken care to secure the lease? he
asked; adding that this was a point on which
many tenants were unaccountably and disastrously
careless. They would put off signing and
securing for months, if not years, after taking
possession, and many were the cases in which he
had known them rue their procrastination. Dora
replied with a smile, that she hoped she might, by
this time, say that the lease was in her husbandâs
pocket; it had been drawn up, almost ever since
they settled in this place, but, for some reason or
another, never signed till now, such being her
husbandâs business with the agent this morning,
and also to pay the first yearâs rent. At this
moment, Sullivan burst in, exclaiming, âLord save
us! your reverence, what can have fallen out now?
Hereâs Dan coming up the glen, raving like mad,
and my own eyes seen him hold up his fist at the
agent; and they, as quiet as lambs together till
now.â

39
Dora was flying out to meet her husband, when
the priest laid his hand on her arm.

âStop, my daughter, and listen to me,â he
said. âI know it all. For your husbandâs sake
hear it from me, that you may not add to his
passion. Remember your vow of trust, daughter,
and renew it now, in your time of need.â

Dora sat down trembling, beseeching, by her
looks, that she might hear the truth at once.
Father Glenny related that Mr. Tracey had written
to his agent to say, that it was evident to him that
his property had been much injured, and the condition
of his tenantry no less so, by the subdivision
of land having been encouraged to too great an
extent: that it was his pleasure that the reverse
process of consolidation should immediately begin;
and that for this purpose, no new leases of
small portions of land should be given, and no
partnership tenancies allowed henceforward; his
intention being, that instead of a small plot of
ground supporting many holders, one substantial
holder should unite several small plots of ground
into a respectably-sized farm. The zealous agent,
Father Glenny went on to say, had looked round
him to see how many tenants he could eject, and
had put Dan and his family down in his list;
the unfortunate delay in signing the lease having
put their little possession into his power. When
Dora had made sure that this was all, she turned
to her father who was standing against the wall,
tattooing with his brogues upon the threshold.
She might have thought that he did not hear the
news, but that he was humming in an under voice

40
the tune to which he had sung, on a somewhat
similar occasion, the burdenâ

âThe curse oâ Jasus light on ye all!â

His old wife not daring to give vent to her anger
in the presence of the priest, had hooded her head
with her petticoat tail, and ceased her spinning.
Father Glenny was beginning a strain of consolation
when Sullivan cried,

âO murther, Dora, my darling, what a sight it
is to see Dan raging like the sea itself! King
of Glory! he is mad entirely.â

The priest placed himself by the threshold, so
as to be the first to meet the unhappy man. At
the sight of the black coat, the oaths and threats
were silenced; and presently the knit brow relaxed,
the fierce eye was tamed before Father Glennyâs
mild, serious gaze. Before any words were exchanged,
Dora drew her husband in with a smile,
and asked him how they were worse off now than
on their wedding morning, and where was the
wonder of young and poor people like themselves
having to go forth again to seek a home? She
did not doubt they should again find one, and
have a warm corner moreover for her father
when he should be past his work.

Her husband impatiently stopped her, saying
that there were no more homes to be had for poor
tenants, and that if she wanted a warm corner, she
must seek it among the beggarâs haunts in the
towns,âwarm enough, with seven families in a
cellar; a comfortable place truly, for her babe to
be born in, and her parents to end their days in:

41
and disregarding the priestâs presence, he prayed
for confusion on every motherâs son of the Traceys
from the first that had gone before, to the last
that should come after. This brought Father
Glenny to interpose.

âPeace, my son!â he said. âIt is blasphemy
to curse man for the judgments of heaven.â

He was going on, but Dan interrupted him to
say that he was not thinking of heaven at all in
the matter. What he cursed was the clearing of
the estate, and the cruelty of those who would
turn so many out of house and home.âFather
Glenny still insisted that this was heavenâs work,
since the Traceys were no Protestants, no strangers
in the land, but members of the true church,
ancient possessors of the soil, only kept at a distance
by being deprived of their political rights,
and as anxious as gentry should be, for the prosperity
of their people. He mentioned that Mr.
Tracey, while giving the fatal order, had mentioned
the good of the tenantry as one of the
motives thereto. It was clear to him that good
would arise out of this measure, since poverty
had increased in proportion to the subdivision
of the land; and the distress which must prevail
in the mean time, should be patiently borne as
the judgment of heaven on the sins of the poor,
and on the slowness of the rich to divide their
substance with the needy.âDora, who was accustomed
to receive with reverence whatever her
priest let fall, enquired humbly whether he would
have them go and ask assistance from Mr. Rosso,

42
he being the only person in their neighbourhood
who had substance to divide with the needy.
Father Glenny shook his head, sighed, and advised
them to remain where they were, till he
should have considered their case and that of
some of their neighbours, who were suffering
under similar calamity. On inquiring whether
they had any savings, Dora joyfully mentioned
the rent, naturally supposing that Dan would
not part with it when he found how matters
stood; but her countenance fell when she extracted
from her now moody husband the fact
that the agent had received him with a smiling
countenance, requested him to count down the
money while he prepared his pen and ink, signed
to his assistant to sweep off the gold, silver, and
copper into a drawer and turn the key, and
then, and not before, explained the necessity he
was under, of refusing to fulfil his engagement,
scoring the lease from corner to corner with
his newly-mended pen as he spoke, and bidding
the insulted Dan move aside to make way for
his betters, who were fortunate enough not to
have put off signing and sealing.

âThen we have nothing left,â said Dora
calmly.

âMurther!â cried her father, âand we might
have had an elegant bed to have carried away on
the shoulders of us, instead of a coat that has
nothing left but the sleeves, by reason of their
having never been used. And much besides is
it we might have had if you had let us be comfortable,

43
Dan, and leave the rent to take care of
itself in peace. By dad, we may very well pass
for beggars without any pretending.â

His son-in-law looked fiercely at him, and the
priest interposed to show that it was all right.
All were to have their dues, and Mr. Tracey
should, therefore, receive his rent; for paying
which honestly, Dan might fully trust he should
never suffer. After more words of exhortation
and comfort, the priest gave Dora a small present
of money, and expressed his hope of seeing
them all at mass in the morning, after which he
would converse further with them on their affairs.

Dan stood watching him from the door, after
receiving his blessing with a dubious expression
of countenance. Dora had sunk down at her
motherâs feet, hiding her face in her lap, when
she heard her husband say, âPraise to the
powers, heâs out of sight! Up with you, you
women, and all ready for nightfall.â

To the question of all three, what he meant to
do? Dan replied, by giving orders, in a tone
which none dared disobey. He made Sullivan
take a spade and dig up, with all his might,
potatoes which were not yet fit for cropping.
Dora found up sacks and turf-panniers, and Dan
proceeded, as soon as twilight came on, to
impress into his temporary service a horse which
grazed in the neighbourhood. On this animal
he packed the panniers, so as to afford a seat
between them, and then commanded the trembling
Dora to mount by his assistance. She
clasped her hands, crying,

44
âO, Dan! where will you be for taking us in
the dark night? You are over full of haste,
Iâm thinking, Dan.â

His only reply was to lift her upon the horse.

âMy mother!â cried Dora, weeping. âYou
will not leave her alone; and if my father stays
without us, depend on it he will call in the neighbours.â

Dan lifted her down again, went for the old
woman (who had seemed stupified ever since the
news came), placed her between the panniers,
gruffly desired Dora to remain behind till her
turn came, and began to lead the horse up the
hill which stretched towards the sea-shore. Dora
followed, however, at some distance, determined
to see whither her mother was to be conducted.
The horse was a grey one, which enabled her
to keep within sight, and out of hearing, amidst
the increasing darkness. It was a dreary walk,
over four or five miles of boggy ground; and
many times would she have called out for her
husbandâs help, if she had not feared his present
mood more than the stormy sky above and the
treacherous soil beneath. Gusts of wind blew
from the sea, piercing her with cold through her
scanty raiment. Drenching showers were dashed
in her face, blinding her so effectually for many
minutes together, that she would have lost the
track and have sunk yet deeper than she did in
the bog, if the same cause had not obliged those
whom she followed to stop also, and turn their
backs for awhile to the storm. The fitful gale
brought to her the feeble wailings of the old

45
woman, and the growlings of her impatient
husband, who cursed heaven, earth, and hell, at
every impediment to their progress. During one
of their pauses on a ridge, over which the roaring
of the sea rose more distinctly to their ears,
Dora came closer upon them than she intended.
The horse started, and his snort seemed to be
answered from a distance by a cry. The old
woman saw something waving near her, and
screamed, and Dan himself shook with superstitious
terror at the very moment that he swore
another oath at those who were scared when the
echoes were up and awake on a stormy night.

âThe echoes
are
up and awake,â said Dora,
venturing round to her husbandâs side. âTake
care, Dan, that they repeat nothing you would
not have heaven hear.â

As she expected, his anger was now turned
on her, for risking her own life and her childâs
by so perilous a walk. She made no reply, but
held by his arm till they arrived at their destination,
thankful that he had slackened his pace and
moderated his wrath somewhat, as if in consideration
for her. They stopped on the extreme
verge of the cliff when Dan desired his wife to
hold the horse while he carried her mother
home. She was not left for many minutes to
conjecture what this home could be. Her husband
led her down to a doorless and half-unroofed
cabin, placed just so far below the
verge of the cliff as to be unseen from the land.
Having lodged both the women under shelter,
Dan tried to strike a light with a flint and steel

46
he had brought with him; but as fast as the little
rush candle was lit, it blew out again, there
being no corner of the hovel free from draughts.
There was nothing for it but to abide in wet,
cold, and darkness, till dawn. The horse being
unloaded, Dan mounted, and bidding the women
expect Sullivan and himself before morning, set
off again across the bog. Three hours afterwards
they appeared with another horse, and a
heavier load; and, to Doraâs disappointment,
her husband again left her, not saying this time
when he should return. Sullivan expressed his
belief that Danâs purpose was to spoil the place
as much as possible before morning, and then
to hide himself for a time in some such convenient
sort of place as he hinted he had thoughts
of betaking himself to the next day. No inquiries
could get out of him what sort of place
that was.

Dora spent the rest of the night in mounting
from the hut to the cliff, and descending from the
cliff to the hut, trying to comfort her mother
meanwhile, who lay moaning and peevishly complaining
of manifold evils that it was impossible
to remedy. Towards morning, it startled Dora
on her watch to perceive a bright light burning
in the direction of their late abode. She called
Sullivan to look at it, who forthwith began to
wave his hat, crying,

âHilloo, hilloo! Dan is the boy in the world
to deal with Flanagan. Hilloo! Dan, my
darling, youâve finished the job out of hand!
âTwill be as good as a yearâs rent to see the

47
agent overlook the place, let alone the tenant.
Itâs burningâthe cabin is, my jewel, and the
turf-stack beside it; and it warms my heart at
this distance!â

âAnd Danâwhere is Dan, father?â

âO, the cratur, heâd just stop up the drain,
and cut the pigâs throat, and throw him into the
bog, and see that everything that he couldnât
bring with him is put in the way of the fire;
and then he would set it alight, and creep off
some roundabout way to us here.â

This was exactly what took place: and the
device was so much to the taste of most of the
ejected tenants, that the example was followed
to a great extent before a sufficient force could
be summoned to check this destruction of property.
For the next three nights, fires were
visible here and there in the dark and dreary
glen. As fast as the agent and his body-guard
galloped from one point of watch to another, a
blaze arose in their rear; and as soon as they
arrived at the scene of destruction, the perpetrators
had vanished, and it was too late to do any
good. A mocking laugh came, from time to
time, out of the darkness which surrounded the
horsemen, in the intervals of the conflagrations;
but this always happened on spots where the
ground on either side the road was not of a kind
to be attempted on horseback. In the morning,
slain pigs, not in condition to be made food of,
were found scattered on the road; houghed
horses lay groaning about the fields; and many
a poor cow was burned in its shed. The agent

48
was driven half frantic by these insults and injuries.
He sent messenger after messenger for
soldiers, called on Mr. Rosso, his sons, and
tenants for assistance; and besides taking these
necessary measures of defence, pointed out every
cottier already ejected, or about to be so, as a
criminal; exasperated every man he met by his
insults; and rode against the women and overthrew
the children as often as he passed a party
of homeless wanderers, going they cared not
whither, and to be kept alive they knew not
how. It appeared so clear to the young Rossos
that Flanagan was endangering his own life, and
aggravating the evils of the time, by awakening
the revengeful passions of the people, that one
or other of them kept continually beside him,
in order, by their presence, to impose a restraint
upon him, and, by their mediation, to
sooth the wounds he inflicted. They well knew
that, by thus associating themselves with so
obnoxious a person, they ran the risk of being
hated by the people; but this risk they had courage
to brave for a time in a good cause.

Alexander had taken his turn one day, when
he rode up to join his father and brother, who
had compassed a circuit of observation in a
different direction, and were now returning home
to refresh themselves before beginning their
evening watch.

âFather,â said Alexander, âdo you mean to
forbid your tenants to receive any of these
ejected cottagers?â

âCertainly not: it is no affair of mine.â

49
âSo I thought; but Flanagan has not only
been routing out some poor creatures from a barn
of one of Traceyâs tenants, but has taken upon him
to declare that they must remove themselves out
of the district, as they would be harboured neither
by you nor any of the proprietors in it.â

âWhat business has the fellow to answer for
anybody but himself?â said Mr. Rosso. âHowever,
the poor people know more of the matter
than he does. They know that I am harbouring
many,âas many, alas! as I can afford to
relieve. Would this were all over, boys! Every
case I hear of seems a harder one than the last;
and it breaks oneâs heart to leave them to take
their chance. See, from this very point, what
melancholy groups of them:âaged parents, or
helpless children, or weakly women in each, to
be a burden upon the spirit-broken cottager!â

âWhere will they go? What will become of
them, father?â

âThe greater part will crowd into the towns,
and herd by hundreds under the same roof, till
the fever sweeps half of them away. Others will
stroll the country as beggars; and others will
live by plunder. The most fortunate of them will
be those who will beg enough in crossing the
island to pay their way over the sea in search of
English wages. The noblest in their natures,
the brave and high-spirited, will become whiteboys,
and die amidst acts of outrage, or on the
gibbet. So much for that policy of landlords,
by which they first increase the numbers of their
tenantry, in order, by force of competition, to

50
let their land high; and then, finding that they
have gone too far, take a fit of consolidation,
and make no provision for the crowd they called
up around them, and now deprive of the means
of subsistence. What think you of such policy,
Henry?â

âI was just thinking, Sir, that it is rather
surprising to me that you lift up your voice, on
all occasions, against establishing poor-laws in
Ireland, while you have such scenes as these
before your eyes.â

âWhile that question is pending, Sir,â said
Alexander,ââand it is a question which will
not be speedily settled, and which, if settled in
the affirmative, will bring tedious arrangements
after it,âin the meanwhile, is not Tracey bound,
by every merciful consideration, to give his
ejected tenants dwellings elsewhere? Ought not
each one of them now to have a slip of land on
yonder mountain-side, and wherewith to build
himself a cabin?â

âThat would afford no present relief,â observed
Henry. âBesides having to build their
cabins, the people must drain and manure their
ground by a process of many months, before it
will yield them the food they are this day in
want of.â

âEven supposing these new lots to be prepared
before the ejectment was served,â said
Mr. Rosso, âthe plan would be a bad one. It
would secure a future repetition of precisely the
same evils we are deploring to-day. Bad cultivation
and over-population, through the too

51
extensive subdivision of land, are our grievances;
and to remedy them, Alexander, you
would begin afresh to divide and subdivide,
and encourage the increase of numbers as before.
This seems to me scarcely reasonable.â

âBut the poor-laws we were talking of, Sir,â
interrupted Henry; âdo tell me how you can
resist pleading for them. Tell me, if you please,
that these poor people have been idle and improvidentâtell
me that they have brought families
into the world without a prospect of maintaining
them; but tell me whether such destitution as
theirs is not a dreadful punishment for what are,
after all, more faults than crimes. Look, too,
at the number of innocent persons that suffer:
the old, who lie down to die by the wayside after
a life of toil; the infants, who expire of hunger
on their mothersâ breasts; the sickly, who, instead
of being tended by careful hands, are
shrinking and shivering in the wet and cold;âlook
at these wretches, in contrast with Tracey,
living in luxury abroad, on funds wrung from
the misery of his tenantry....â

âTracey is a benevolent man,â interrupted
Alexander; âhe may be mistaken in the way in
which he sets about improving the condition of
his tenantry, and he may have chosen his agent
badly; but he is far from being a hard-hearted
man.â

âTrue,â replied Henry, âand all this makes
for my argument. Levy a rate upon him, and he
will no longer be insensible to what passes at
home; the burden of relieving distress will no

52
longer fall wholly upon the charitable,âupon
you, father, and your kindhearted tenants, who
are giving up their barns for lodging, and rood
after rood of their potato-grounds, for food for
the destitute. O, father, when I see these things,âthe
calamity of the oppressed, the insensibility
of the oppressor, the liabilities of the charitable,
the exemption of the selfish and the avaricious,
I cannot but cry out for the interposition of the
strong arm of the law to rectify these monstrous
abuses, by making charity compulsory.â

âIf the law could rectify these abuses, Henry,
I would cry out with as loud a voice as you. It
is because I am convinced that a legal charity
would only aggravate them, that I advocate other
methods of rectification. We all know that a
permanent state of comfort depends on character.
Do we not?â

âCertainly: we might give and give for ever
to a set of depraved paupers, without any better
result than impoverishing ourselves.â

âTrue. Well; the mistake seems to me to
lie in supposing that, as character and comfort
are connected, we must produce character by
giving comfort; whereas this is beginning at the
wrong end; and the results have always been
the direct reverse of what was expected. We
must begin at the other end....â

âBut, my dear father, how long it must be
before education can work....â

âRemember, Henry, there is another kind of
education always going forwards, besides that of
our reading and writing schoolsâthe education

53
of circumstances. By our present institutions,
we educate our peasantry to indolence and improvidence;
and by calling in poor-laws, we
should only be appointing an additional teacher
to enforce the same bad lessons. Instead of this,
I would fain have institutions which should stimulate,
instead of superseding industry,âwhich
should cherish, instead of extinguishing true
charity,âand ensure its due reward to prudence,
instead of offering a premium to improvidence.â

âI know the evils you speak of have grown
out of the English pauper system; but must they,
therefore, be inherent in every system of legal
charity?â

âThey must; because the supposition of a

right
to assistance is involved in the very notion
of a legal provision; and herein lies the mischief.
You will never improve character (which
is the same as improving the external condition),
while you separate character and its consequences,âwhile
a right to support is accorded
to any man, whether his conduct be wise or
foolish, correct or profligate. Lay hold of a
child, teach him effectually that industry and
prudence are the means of comfort, and you put
comfort within his reach. Take the profligate,
or the reckless man, in his middle age, give him
the means of comfort, and you will not give him
character; he will presently be as poor as ever,
and the more reckless for having received arbitrary
assistance.â

âThe more arbitrary charity there is, the less
natural will there be,â said Alexander. âIn

54
England, our peasantry are held in respect for
their filial duty and neighbourly kindness;âtoo
little known there, alas! except in the remote
districts where the poor-laws have not yet shed
their blight over the growth of kindly sympathies.
Give us poor-laws, and here, too, the
aged will be committed to the cold care of
strangers, orphans will be without a home, and
the maladies of the body will involve the soul-sickness
of pauperism.â

âSuch is the fate of the helpless in England,â
said Mr. Rosso; âand their calamities
are aggravated in precise proportion to the
amount of legal relief provided. The most
deplorable misery prevails in the southern counties,
where the poor-rate is highest: the condition
of the poor improves to the northward, where a
dislike of this species of relief has been longer
kept alive. There is still less distress in Scotland,
where assessments for the poor are rare;
and least of all where their condition is confided
to voluntary charity. That the misery is as
much the consequence as the cause of legal
relief, is proved by the result of an experiment
of abolishing a stated mode of relief. Pauperism
was on the perpetual increase in a populous
district under a system of assessment; the assessment
was discontinued, and pauperism vanished.
It was swept away by the current of human
affections, as soon as they were restored to their
natural channels.â

âIt seems rather absurd, to be sure,â observed
Alexander, âfirst to complain that the

55
misery about us arises from the obstructions
imposed on human powers, and then to seek to
remedy it by obstructing the current of human
affections.â

âBut what after all,â inquired Henry, âhave
these human affections done? Whence comes
all this misery, if they have been left free?â

âThey have been rendered impotent by the
force of bad institutions,â replied his father;
âthey live and act, but are baulked of their
natural rewards by the injustice of our economy,
and the impolicy of our government. While
industry is overloaded and foresight baffled, as
at present, children may honour their parents,
and the poor have compassion to one another,
but they can yield little mutual support against
indigence.â

âIt seems rather an injury to Ireland, brother,â
said Alexander, âto ask what its benevolent sympathies
have done. Our public provision for lunacy
and sickness, is greater than in England;
and innumerable plans have been tried, at a
great expense of capital and trouble, to lessen the
amount of pauperism. That all have failed, betokens
not a want of charity, but an overpowering
counteraction from other quarters. If we
look only at the Mendicity Associations, what
vast sums have been raised by them as often as
the increase of pauperism suggested to some the
idea of a compulsory rate! All this voluntary
charity would cease, as it has ceased elsewhere,
upon the establishment of a poor rate.â

âBut, father, we ought to give more every

56
year as our resources increase; and they certainly
are increasing on the whole.â

âThey are; and this is another reason for
deprecating an institution which would swallow
up all we have gained, and effectually prevent
the further progress to improvement. The vast
and increasing unproductive consumption which
takes place wherever there is a poor-rate, would
presently absorb our now growing capital, and
repress the spirit of improvement which is
beginning to stir among us. Let our capital be
allowed to spread itself naturally; let more and
more of the lower classes be encouraged to clothe
themselves decently, to add a room to their cabin,
to exchange a portion of their potato diet for
oatmeal or bread; and far more will be done for
the lowest class of all, than if the earnings of the
industrious were directly applied to the maintenance
of paupers. I see bakersâ shops beginning
to appear in many of our villages; and I
regard them as an indication of growing prosperity.
If, in their place, I were to see workhouses,
or any part of the apparatus of a legal
charity, I should regard it as an indication that
a final and overwhelming curse had lighted upon
the land.â

âBut, father, every poor-rate need not have
the abuses of the English system. It is not an
inherent necessity in a poor-rate, that it should
grow in one century from five hundred thousand
pounds to eight millions.â

âNo; but the principle of growth is inherent
in the system, whether that growth be rapid or

57
slow; and the destruction of the country in which
it is established becomes merely a question of
time. The only way to get the better of it is, to
annihilate it in time; and this being the case, it
is mere folly to call it in for the relief of temporary
evils.â

âIt seems to me,â said Alexander, âthat
such a system would aggravate the very evils we
want to remedy. It is for want of capital that
the land is subdivided too far. If revenue is
so far absorbed by a poor-rate as to check its
conversion into capital, this subdivision will go
on.â

âUndoubtedly such would be the effect in our
agricultural districts; and in the manufacturing
towns the case would be as bad. Our linen-weavers
would be a burden upon the rates in
slack times, and their masters must encroach
upon their wages-fund to support them; and
thus the masters would be brought lower and
lower, to the permanent injury of their men.â

âI do not believe,â observed Alexander, âthat
the thing could ever be done here. We have not
the requisites. All have a nearly equal horror of
an assessment; and I could name many parishes
where there are none to manage the business,
and many more where no one would undertake
it.â

âThere would soon be an end of that difficulty,â
replied Mr. Rosso; âthere are people
enough ready to administer the fund for the sake
of living upon it. We should have a new class
of unproductive consumers introduced; and for

58
every one of them we should lose a hardy labourer,
who would commit to them his aged parents and
helpless little ones, and go to seek good wages
in England. A poor exchange truly!â

âDo you complain of numbers, father, and
yet object to the emigration of our poor?â

âTo that of productive consumers who leave
all the helpless members of their families upon
our hands; and of this kind of emigration there
would be a vast increase upon the establishment
of a pauper system. The same influence which
would supersede domestic charities, would dissolve
domestic ties: and would not a legal relief be an
irresistible temptation to a man to throw his burdens
upon the public, and go to seek his fortune
elsewhere? If it is done already while no legal
provision exists, it would be done more extensively
upon the establishment of such a provision.â

âWell, then, Sir, what would you do? Something,
I suppose.â

âBy all means. I would do much, and without
loss of time, lest there should be many lives to
answer for.âTill education can be made universal
in Ireland, so that the interests of the
people can be safely committed to their own
guardianship, we must weather the evils which
surround us, opposing peculiar methods of relief
to their peculiar stress. We must consolidate
our small farms....â

âO, father, look about you and see the consequences!â

âHear me out, Henry. We must gradually

59
consolidate our farms, removing our ejected
population, not to other small holdings in the
neighbourhood, but to regions where population
is the one thing deficient. The people are already
making efforts to do this for themselves, at a
tremendous expense of hardship and danger.
It should be done for them on a better plan by
those who eject them, on the understanding that
it is a temporary measure, caused by the new
arrangement of landed property. The tenants
who remain should be freed from the burden of
supporting two religious establishments, from all
interference between themselves and their landlords,
from all impediments to the free exercise
of their industry, and to the gradual accumulation
of capital.â

âMight not emigration remedy the worst evils
of the poor-laws, father?â

âWe cannot afford, Henry, to be for ever
doing and undoing in any such way. To increase
numbers by poor-laws and lessen them by emigration,
would cost endless toil and expense, and
leave our grievances untouched: but as a temporary
measure, as a specific remedy for a specific
grievance, nothing can be wiser, or, in our case,
more necessary. Tracey meant to do a patriotic
thing when he ordered the consolidation of this
estate: the deed would have answered to the will,
if he had done it more gradually, carefully providing
a settlement in Canada or Australia for
every family that he displaced.â

âAnd why not on some of our waste tracts at
home?â

60
âBecause much capital is required to bring
them into a productive state; while, in the case of
emigration, the only cost incurred is that of
transportation to a place where capital superabounds
and labour is the one thing wanted.â

âAnd this then, you think, opens a fair prospect
of improvement.â

âI do. If this plan be pursued in conjunction
with the removal of the most galling of our political
fetters, we may see Ireland the flourishing
region nature intended her to be. If a pauper
system be introduced instead, our case is hopeless.
To use the words of one who well understands
our maladies and their causes, âits probable effect
appears to me to be to fill Ireland with a population
multiplying without forethought; impelled
to labour principally by the fear of punishment;
drawing allowance for their children, and throwing
their parents on the parish; considering
wages not a matter of contract but of right;
attributing every evil to the injustice of their
superiors; and, when their own idleness or improvidence
has occasioned a fall of wages,
avenging it by firing the dwellings, maiming the
cattle, or murdering the persons of the landlords
and overseers; combining, in short, the insubordination
of the freeman with the sloth and recklessness
of the slave.ââ

Chapter IV.

IRISH CRIME.

The Sullivans and Mahonys were not immediately
pursued. Dora watched by day and
listened by night, in vain, for tokens of the
approach of enemies, till she began to believe,
as she was told, that the place of their
retreat was not known; or, if known, was
supposed to be so surrounded by a disaffected
and desperate peasantry, as to render any attack
too perilous to be attempted. That this last supposition
was true she had some reason to believe,
though she knew little more than Mr. Flanagan
himself what was passing around her. Her
father disappeared the day after their arrival on
the coast; but he had since looked in on them,
twice at night and once early in the morning,
which seemed to prove that his abode was not
very distant from theirs. He brought with him
each time a supply of whiskey for his sick wife,
who was failing fast, and able to enjoy little
besides a drop of spirits to warm her. These gifts,
coupled with what Sullivan had let fall about
what went on in the bog, led Dora to think that
he had connected himself with an illicit distillery
in the neighbourhood; but no confession could
she get from him but eloquent gestures and significant
snatches of song. Dan was yet more
mysterious. His tenderness to his wife in great
measure returned after the night of the flitting, but
there was no confidence with it. He went and

62
came at all hours, never saying where he had been,
or how long he should be absent; but always
desiring her not to be uneasy, and showing
that he thought of home during his excursions
by bringing little comforts for her mother and
herself, which she wondered how he could procure.
Once he threw over her shoulders a cloak
which was much less rent and tattered than her
own; another time he produced a packet of tea
for his mother-in-law; and with it a handsome
teapot and cups nicely secured in straw: lastly
appeared a piece of fine linen for the use of the
expected baby. Dan expected very warm thanks
for this, as he knew that Doraâs great anxiety
was on account of nothing being provided for
her little one, who would too probably scarcely
outlive its birth in circumstances of destitution:
but Dora looked at her husband with anguish in
her countenance, saying,

âO, husband, you would not doom your child
before it is born! You will not wrap it about
with crime as soon as it sees the light! This is
not earned, Dan. It cannot be yours; and my
child shall not be touched with that which is
stolen.â

Dan, far from being angry, coolly observed
that when there was an end of justice, there was
an end of law. If he was cut off from earning
what he wanted, he must take it where he could
get it; and to take it thus was a less crime than to
let his family die of hunger, and his child of cold,
while food and clothing were within reach. In
answer to his wifeâs timid questions what this

63
would avail him when the law was urged against
him, and soldiers were dogging his heels, he
laughed, and said that if the gentry brought the
matter to that pass, he and others must fight for
it. They had driven him out, and must not
wonder if he did not come in again at their beck
and call. If the orderlies chose to try their
strength against the desperates, there should be
a fair battle. He was ready to fight bravely or
to swing merrily, according as the powers decreed
the one party or the other to prevail.

Dan could not succeed in any degree in imparting
his spirit of recklessness to his wife. She
became more thoughtful as he grew less so: a
deeper and deeper melancholy shaded her countenance.
Her form wasted, her spirits were
hurried, and she seemed unable to control her
temper by other means than perfect silence. Instead
of soothing her motherâs complaints, and
patiently answering her incessant questions, as
formerly, she heard the former in silence, and
escaped as often as possible from the latter.
Her practice was to set within the old womanâs
reach whatever she was likely to want, and then
wander out, sometimes sitting on a perilous projection
of the cliff to watch the swell of the sea,
and sometimes hiding herself in a cave immediately
below the cabin; whence she would come
forth occasionally, climb the cliff laboriously,
peep in at the door stealthily, to see if she was
wanted within, and creep down again to her place
of idleness and solitude. Yet it would seem as
if, even in this place, she heard her husbandâs step

64
from a distance, so invariably did she appear as
he approached. At other times she came forth
when it was not Dan moving over the bog, but
some less welcome visitor; and then she turned
back quickly and tried to evade observation.
One woman, and another and another, came to
visit her, she knew not whence nor why; but
they were of a more companionable nature than
herself, and gave broad hints that as their husbands
or fathers or sons were united in enterprise,
the women should be so in confidence; and would
have told many a horrible tale of what was
nightly done and daily suffered by the band they
professed to belong to. Dora always stopped
such communications at the outset; professing
that Dan and she belonged to nobody and
nobody to them, and that all she wished for was,
to live alone and be left quiet. She did not so
much as know where her visitors came from, she
said. They pointed, some to the bog, some to
the rocks, and others to little mounds of turf,
from which a thin blue smoke was seen at times
to curl up. Some hinted at an intention of building
cabins on the cliff, near hers; to which she
gave no encouragement. This kind of reception
did not tempt them to repeat their visits very
often, and after a short time, Dora flattered
herself she had got rid of all intruders. She was
not deceived. In a little while she was solitary
enough.

It was a December night, wrapt in that kind
of gloom which is as a stifling pall descending
to shroud the world, when a vessel came ashore

65
almost directly below Danâs dwelling. How the
accident happened, those on board were wholly
ignorant. They had believed themselves acquainted
with the coast, and felt themselves
secure while the beacon glimmered south-east of
them. It did, indeed, only glimmer; but the
fog lay so thick, that the wonder was how the
beacon could be seen at all. What wind there
was blew directly on shore; so that it was too
late, when the vessel was once among the
breakers, to preserve her. She struck; and with
the first cry uttered by her crew, the supposed
beacon vanished. The shouts of the mariners
rose at intervals amidst the hoarse music of the
waves, which renewed their dirge with every
human life that they swept away. All might
have been saved if there had been a ray of light
to guide their efforts; but, murky as it was, they
struggled in vain, while wave upon wave, without
a momentâs pause, found them full of desperate
effort, and left them less able to encounter
its successor. The first man that gained a footing
on the beach found himself unable to yield
the slightest assistance to his companions, and
looked about for signs of human habitation. The
only token was a feeble gleam from Danâs cabin,
towards which he directed his steps, not perfectly
satisfied at first whether it was light from a
dwelling on an eminence, or a star seen through
an opening in the gloom. Tripping, stumbling,
now climbing, now falling, but still shouting all
the time, he pursued his way in a direct line to
the light, fearing every moment that it would

66
vanish, like the supposed beacon, and leave him
no choice but to sit down and wait on the spot
for day. When he had drawn near enough to
feel pretty secure of his object, his shout was
suddenly answered by many voices, in immediate
succession and from different distances; and
moving lights at once appeared along the whole
face of the cliff. A man started out from the
darkness on either hand of the astonished sailor,
and told him he was going the wrong way for
assistance, there being none but women above.
The sailor, on whom, being a foreigner, this
information was lost, swore his deepest oaths at
them for their delay, and for the artifice by which
he suspected the vessel had been purposely
brought on shore. His wrath, vented in unintelligible
threats, was only laughed at.

âBe easy, now,â said one. âSure it takes a
man a long time to wake with such a lullaby
going on all the while.â

âSure a darker curtain was never about a
sleeping manâs head than this fog,â observed
another.

âThe beacon!â exclaimed a third; âitâs just
the drop made you see double, thatâs all. The
beacon is far away south, and yon cabinâs the
only light.â

Their explanations were as much wasted as
the foreignerâs wrath; and after a prodigious
expense of eloquence on both sides, recourse
was had to action, the purport of which was
presently intelligible enough. A shrill whistle
set all the wandering lights converging towards

67
the beach: the sailorâs two guides, whose outer
garment was a shirt, bound round the waist with
a hayband, in which pistols and knives were
stuck, slung their lanterns to their belts, seized
each an arm of the stranger, and led him rapidly
down the cliff. Instead of permitting him to
proceed towards the wreck, they ordered him
into the cave whither Dora often resorted, and
set a guard of two men over him. One after
another, five of his companions were brought to
join him, the guard being strengthened in proportion.
When no more live men could be
found about the wreck, a small supply of food
and spirits, and materials for making a fire, were
sent into the cave, as an intimation that all the
business was over in which the crew was to have
any share. The poor wretches, soaked, battered,
exhausted in body, and harassed in mind with
grief and panic, were not interfered with by their
guards, except when their lamentations became
dangerously audible.

The work of violence on the beach meanwhile
went on rapidly: all that the vessel contained
was seized, and put out of sight, and
great part of the wreck broken up and carried
away before morning. The aim of some of the
people employed was the very amusing joke of
persuading the foreigners, on bringing them out
into the daylight, that their vessel had been conjured
away bodily to a distant point, whither they
were to be sent to seek it. These people were
scarcely aware how some of their noisy operations
were heard by the crew, and how well they

68
understood the knocking, heaving, and crashing,
and especially the shouts which followed every
grand achievement in the process of destruction.

Dan was among the plunderers. He was not
at liberty to decline any enterprise proposed by
the captain of the gang with which he had associated
himself; and on his return from a distant
expedition, which had detained him from his
home for some days, he found himself called
upon, in fulfilment of his oath, to take part in a
scene of plunder, of a kind which he abhorred,
in sight of his own dwelling. While he was
ordered to rob middlemen, terrify agents, and
half-murder tithe-proctors, he discharged his
mission with hearty goodwill, under the notion of
avenging his own wrongs: but it was quite a
different thing to delude foreigners, put them in
peril of their lives, and strip them of everything;
and he said so. In reply, he was reminded of
his oath (an oath too solemn to be slighted),
and immediately commanded, as a test of obedience,
to take up a bale of goods from the
wreck, and carry it up to find houseroom in his
cabin. He did so with a heavy heart, dreading
thus to meet Dora, after a separation of some
days. She had never yet seen him equipped as
a whiteboy, or been expressly told what occupation
he followed.

He paused outside, leaning against the doorless
entrance to watch what was passing within.
All was so strange and fearful, that a deadly
horror came over him, lest the one whom he saw
moving about should not be the real Dora, but

69
some spirit in her likeness. She was employed
about her motherâs corpse, which lay on the bare
ground. Her motions were so rapid as to
appear almost convulsive. Now she kneeled
beside the body, straightening the limbs, and
striving in vain to cover it completely with a
piece of linen which was too small for the purpose;
now she fixed her one rush-light in a
lump of clay, and placed it at the head; now
she muttered from beneath the hair which fell
over her face as she stooped; and then, leaning
back, uttered the shrill funeral cry with a vehemence
which brought some colour back to her
ashy pale countenance.

âWhisht, whisht!â muttered she impatiently
to herself. âI have given the cry, and nobody
comes. Father Glenny forgot me long ago, and
my own father has forgot us, and DanââI
donât know what has been done to Dan, and he
tells nobody. He wonât forget me long, however.â

âForget you, Dora!â said Dan, gently, as
he laid hold of her cloak. âDid I keep my oath
so long when you lived in your fatherâs cabin in
the glen, and shall I forget you now?â

She folded her arms in her cloak with a look
of indifference, as she glanced at the bale he
carried.

âO, you have brought a sheet, as I was wanting,â
said she; âbut where are the candles? I
have but this one; and nothing in the way of a
shutter or a door, you see; and thereâs no company

70
come yet; so you will have time. Make
haste, Dan.â

âShall I bid the neighbours to the
wake?â
wake?â

inquired Dan, who thought the best way of gaining
her attention was to help her to fulfil first
the duties to the dead, which rank so high among
social obligations in Ireland.

At a sign from her he threw down his load
and hastened to the beach, whence he brought a
plank, on which to lay the body, candles wherewith
to illuminate the bier, and spirits with
which to exercise hospitality. He gave notice,
at the same time, to his captain and comrades,
that when a blaze should be seen on the cliff,
and the funeral lament heard, all would be ready
for their reception at the wake:âthe burning of
the bed of the deceased before the door, and the
utterance of the death cry, being the customary
mode of invitation to the wakes of the Irish poor.

Dan was yet more struck with the deathlike
paleness of his wifeâs face when he again joined
her. He inquired whether any neighbours had
helped her to nurse her mother, and whether her
rest had been much broken: but she scarcely
attended to his questions. She clapped her
hands, as if in glee, at sight of what he brought,
and seemed altogether so much more like a
wilful child, than like his thoughtful and devoted
Dora, that the fancy again crossed him that
some mocking fiend had taken possession of her
form. He asked her, with much internal trembling,
whether she had duly prayed this night?

71
She started, and said she had strangely forgotten
herself; and forthwith went through her customary
devotions in a way which, though hurried,
was very unlike any which a fiend would dare to
attempt; and Dan was so far satisfied.

âBring out the bed,â said she, pointing to the
straw on which her mother had been wont to lie.
âWhile it is burning, I will raise the cry once
more, and see if any one will come.â

Dan moved a bundle which lay on the straw,
but let it go again in a pang of horror when the
feeble cry of an infant proceeded from it. In an
instant he understood all. He took up the child,
and placed it on Doraâs bosom without saying a
word.

âO, my child: aye, I forgot it when I forgot
my prayers; but it cannot have been hungry
long, Iâm thinking. Hold him while I strip off
my cloak that keeps me as hot as if I had a fire
burning within me.â And she carelessly slipped
the babe into her husbandâs arms.

âO Dora!â cried he in a choking voice, âis
this the way you give a child of ours into my arms
for the first time?â

She looked at him with perplexity in her countenance,
said she knew nothing at all about it,
and before he could prevent her, set fire to the
straw, and gave the other appointed signal. Up
came the company of whiteboys, crowding round
the cabin, rushing to the bier, and exciting Dora
more and more every moment by their looks and
their proceedings. She now, for the first time,
perceived the peculiarity of her husbandâs dress.

72
She went from one to another, observing upon
the arms they carried, and stopped at last before
Dan, who was in earnest conversation with his
captain.

âSo you have enrolled yourself, Dan! So you
have plighted and pledged yourself to your band
since you swore you would wed me only. Much
may they do for you that I could not do! but O,
may they never do you the evil that I would not
do! They may give you clothes these winter
nights, when I have nothing warmer at home for
you than my own heart. They may find you
whiskey and lights for the wake, and other things
as you want them; but they will make you pay
more than you ever paid to me, Dan. They will
take you among snares in the night: they will
set you on other menâs beasts to go over bogs
where you will sink, and under rocks that will
crush you: they will set you where bullets are
flying round you; they will put a knife in your
hand and make you dip your soul in blood. If
you refuse, they will burn you and me together
within four walls; and if you agree, they will
lead you on to something worse than bogs or
rocks, or a soldierâs shot: they will send you to
be set before the judge, and refused mercy, and
then....â

âFor Christâs sake stop her!â exclaimed Dan.
He seized her hands to prevent her stripping his
white-boy uniform from his shoulders, as soon as
he had given his baby in charge to a compassionate
by-stander.

âMove the corpse,â ordered the captain. âKeep

73
the wake down below, and bring the first woman
you can meet with, to tend this poor creature.
Clear the cabin instantly.â

âGive the word, captain,â cried one, âand
weâll catch a doctor,âthe same that we brought
blindfold when OâLeary was murthered almost.
Weâll whip up horses, and have him here and
home by noon.â

âNo, no; not till we see what the women
say. Hilloo, boys! bring out the bier, fair and
easy, and decent.â

Doraâs struggles to follow were fierce, and her
cries at being kept from this duty heart-rending.
No one could effectually quiet her till she had
been some hours committed to the care of a
matron, who was brought from some invisible
place to nurse her.

Slowly and sadly she recovered. Some said
she was never again the same Dora; but others
saw no further change than the melancholy
which was likely to become fixed in her by such
an experience as herâs. She could never recall
any circumstances connected with the death of
her mother and the birth of her child. She
could only suppose, as her husband did, that the
old womanâs exertions had sufficed for her daughter,
and been fatal to herself.

Sullivan made his appearance ere long from
underground, where he had been engaged in
breaking the laws after his own method. He
was duly grieved at having been absent from the
burial of his wife; but hoped to atone for the involuntary
neglect, by devoting his gains at the
still to the purchase of masses for her soul.

Chapter V.

IRISH RETRIBUTION.

It was not possible that the acts of outrage, of
which the whiteboys from Traceyâs estate and
others were guilty, should remain long unnoticed
by the officers of the law. The foreigners, who
had been deprived of their wrecked vessel, had
been, the next morning, tied two and two, and
conducted into the neighbourhood of a road, by
which they might reach a town, and relate their
hardships. Three of their number were missing,
and they did not fail to attribute their disappearance
to those who had done all the other mischief.
As they went along the road, and through
small villages, they met with little sympathy in
any of their complaints against whiteboys; but
the townspeople were of a different temper, and
Ballina and Killala soon rang with the tidings
of the horrible outrage which had been committed
on the coast. The alarm spread through
the whole district. There was, daily, news of
intended attacks, which never took place; exaggerated
reports of the numbers of the disaffected,
and of their deeds, got abroad; and
many a dweller in a lone house, many an oppressor
with an unquiet conscience,âall who
had wealth in their houses, and all who suspected
that they had enemies abroad,âtrembled, as
often as the long winter nights settled down,
whether in starless gloom, or upon tracts of

75
moon-lit snow. The rovers did not fail to make
use of the panic, while it lasted, to punish their
enemies, and beat up for recruits among their
friends. Opposition gave way before them in
every direction; and many and various were the
tokens of welcome they met wherever the population
had tasted of oppression, or were struggling
with hardship. The immediate occasion
of the first check they encountered was an insult
offered to an obnoxious landed proprietor,âan
insult which roused him from fireside declamation
to military action. His finest trees, some of
which had ornamented the lawn of his mansion
for an untold length of time, had been cut down
in one night. He had looked westward the
preceding evening, and seen the red sun tinge
the tufts of snow that rested on their branchy
heads; he looked again in the morning, and
they lay like so many monuments of the grandeur
that had been. He galloped off after
breakfast in search of brother magistrates, soldiers,
informers, guides, and all that was necessary
for dislodging the enemy from their entrenchments.
He would not wait till his usual body-guard had
assembled, but ventured out with
only a groom behind him. He had long suspected
that some of his enemies were no further
entrenched than in their own discretion, and that
they were living and moving on all sides of him.
He was now sure of it, from the ambiguous
greeting which met him on all sides. He never
remembered so many inquiries as to how all
went on at the Hall, and such tender concern

76
about his honourâs rest oânights, and so many
remarks upon the marvellous darkness of the
preceding night. He perceived signals pass
across the road, before and behind him,âthought
he detected hidings behind the fences,âwas sure
that an ominous whoop travelled over the bog
westward,âand that more than one gossoon
only waited till the horses were past, to begin
an expedition in the same direction.

It was indeed the case, as usual, that instant
tidings were conveyed of the motions of those
who had been recently injured. Mr. Connorâs
departure from home, his application to this
magistrate, and consultation with that, and the
grand letter which his groom was seen to put
into his bosom and to ride off with in the midst
of an escort, and the other letter carried to the
post-office, which looked just like it, were all
faithfully reported of to Danâs captain, in time
to have the express turned back without his
dispatch, and the next mail stopped, in order to
rifle the letter-bag. These expedients, however,
could not long avail. Soldiers were at length
known to be on the way, and suitable preparations
were made for their reception. In one of
the most important of these, Dora bore a principal
part.

Her husband, whose absences had been
shorter and less frequent, until he saw that she
was perfectly recovered and able to occupy herself
with her infant, but were now again lengthening,
came to her one night, and, gently waking
her, told her that her services were wanted by

77
himself, and three or four companions who were
waiting outside.

âTroth, then, my jewel,â said he, âthereâs
no need to be trembling and staring as if we
were about carrying you off. You are not
going out of this; and the whole matter is
nothing in life but writing a slip of a letter, my
darling, because itâs you that will be doing it
neat and pretty.â

One of the party brought paper, pen, and ink,
and as soon as Dora could steady her hand sufficiently,
she wrote to her husbandâs dictation,
subject to the suggestions of his companions:â

âMajor Greaves,

âCome no farther nor the big elms in
Rossoâs demesne, or it will be the worse for
yourself and them you bring. What you come
to ask us for is a trifle that gentlemen should not
be thinking of asking of poor men, even if the
ship was a ship still, which it is not, never having
been more than an awkward boat, and that now
burnt and gone entirely, so as not to be given
up, except the arms, which will be offered in a
different way from that you expect, if a man of
you sets foot beyond the elms. Take heed to
the ground, sir, which is mostly such as would
bog a snipe, and you without a guide that may
be trusted; for thereâs not a boy in the glen that
would do your honour the ill turn to bring you
here. There are eels in the bog, sir, that slide
easy out of the hand when you would take them;
and your honour will find we take after the eels,

78
except that you will be much the worse of not
taking us,âbeing taken yourselves. One word
more out of kindness.âNo enemy ever sets foot
out of this place more, barring he takes us as his
prisoners, which not a man of us will ever be:
so, unless you come to pick and choose a grave
for every man of you, stir not a step farther than
the big elms, near which one will meet you with
this.â

Having amused themselves with inventing
gibberish for the signature, and making rude
drawings below of guns, pikes, and gibbets, ornamented
with shamrock, the letter was folded,
neat and pretty, and confided to one of the party,
to be forwarded. Dan wondered that Dora
made no remonstrance against being involved in
such a proceeding; and, for a moment, suspected
her of the weakness of being flattered, by the
compliments paid to her writing, into a disregard
of what it was that she had written: but Doraâs
passiveness arose from a sense of the uselessness
of opposition, as far as the letter was concerned,
and of its injurious influence on her domestic
state. She would give Dan no shadow of a
reason for leaving his home as he did. Her
groan, when he kissed her and bade her farewell,
on the letter being finished, went to his heart.
He told her that it was for her sake, as well as
for duty, that he must leave her, the boys being
now on the look out to keep the enemy at a distance.
He came back to whisper that, in case
of real difficulty, she might be easy about himself

79
and her father, as each man had a hiding
place in the bog, theirs being below a certain
stunted alder-bush, which she well knew.

From this hour, the sole employment of Dora,
when not engaged within with her infant, was to
sit with her eyes fixed upon this alder bush. No
news came to her of the proceedings either of
her people or of the enemy; but as long as she
saw no sign from the appointed place, she knew
that matters were not desperate. In frost or
in fog, in sunshine and in rain, Dora sat abroad
or paced along the ridge above her cabin, bending
her gaze till she grew dizzy upon the black
turf around the alder bush. There was not a
tuft of moss, nor a twig, nor a rush, that was
not presently as familiar to her as if she had
planted them all. Every evening, as it became
dusk, she drew nearer and nearer to the place,
and, when it was quite dark, sat on the very spot
as long as her child could spare her. Every
morning, she devised some apparent reason, in
case of curious eyes looking on, for making a
circuit of the alder bush; and returned with a
somewhat lightened heart, when she found no
indication of any one being there.

This painful watching could not go on for ever,
though Dora began to think it would. Some
one at last appeared to be moving in that direction
through the dusk of a foggy morning, now
ducking and vanishing, now crawling among the
uneven ground, now cautiously raising himself
and looking about him. After vanishing near

80
the alder, he appeared no more. Dora proceeded
thither, and found her father.

âWhere is Dan?â was her first question.
Somewhere near, her father told her, but too busy
to seek a hiding at present. It was only the old
and helpless who were thus allowed to get out of
the way; all who could fight, were out against
the soldiers. Dan meant to come to her by the
coast way this day, if possible, just to tell her
what he was about.

Sullivan had provided himself with a supply of
his own manufacture; but he had no food. Dora
hastened to bring him some while it was still
dusk, and she promised more at night, in case of
his being unable to leave his hiding place before
that time. Sullivan joked on the chances of an
old manâs keeping soul and body together in such
a place for twelve hours, and promised to thank
her heartily for food and warmth at night, barring
he was dead. He bade her not be scared at the
soldiers if they should cross-examine her this day;
she was not his own daughter, he declared, if
she could not delude the ruffians, and save her
own kith and kin at their expense. Dora retired
home to watch more nervously than ever, since
she was listening for her husbandâs footstep from
below; and to meditate on the entanglements of
these her kith and kin. Her father had broken
the law in the matter of the distillery, and her
husband was under ban for burning his late
dwelling, for his share in the robbery of the
wreck, and probably for many more feats of

81
whiteboyism, of which she had yet heard nothing.
Her own liabilities she did not for a moment
remember; yet the act of writing a threatening
letter was uniformly punished very severely,
whenever the perpetrators could be discovered.
She stood in nearly as much jeopardy as her
husband; and he knew it; and the purpose of
his intended visit of this day was to convey
her to a hiding. Her father was not aware of
what she had done, and therefore thought no
more than herself of her being in any danger.

How often since being involved in these troubles
had she sighed for an opportunity of confession!
It was long since she had eased her
conscience; and she felt it among the greatest
of the sins the family had committed, that they
had cut themselves off from the services of devotion,
and what she thought the means of repentance.
Again and again, in her solitude, she had
meditated a night expedition to Father Glennyâs
dwelling; but it was a step she dared not take
without Danâs approbation; and he always put
her off without an express permission. At this
crisis she was more than ever distressed at her
own spiritual state, and said to herself that her
mind was so perplexed by her long solitude, and
her conscience so burdened with an accumulation
of sins, that she was not equal to what she might
have to go through. Her ingenuity and presence
of mind were gone, and she felt that, at the first
question, she should betray either her conscience
or her cause; that is, that she should either tell
a direct lie or the plain truth, instead of being

82
able to baffle and mislead, as she had been taught
it was meritorious to do, on such an occasion.
She had not much time to ponder her case.

As soon as the fogs began to disperse before
the risen sun, she saw a glancing and gleaming
on the extreme point of the track which led from
the glen into this district. It was the glittering
of the arms of a strong party of soldiers, who
were accompanied by several horsemen in plain
clothes, probably some of the neighbouring gentry
who had offered their services as guides; none
of the country people having being found trustworthy
in the office. Doraâs heart beat thicker
and thicker as she traced them among the windings
of the bog road. Presently they stopped at
a cross track, and separated into three parties, as
if more for purposes of search than battle. One
of these parties, the smallest, seemed to receive
directions from the gentry as to the course they
should pursue, and then turned directly towards
the alder-bush. Folding her arms forcibly on
her bosom, to keep down her agitation, she stood
conspicuous on the ridge of the cliff, hoping to
draw their attention to herself. They looked
about them at every step; but not more keenly
when alongside the alder-bush than before.
They passed it, and one pang was over. They
came rapidly towards her, and she turned to
enter the cabin. They shouted; she stopped,
and awaited them with every appearance of
willingness, gazing at the officer and his six
soldiers as a child gazes at a show.

83
âWhere do you live, my good woman?â inquired
the officer. She pointed to the cabin.

âWho lives with you?â

âMy child. My mother did live here too, but
she died many weeks ago.â

âAnd your father?â

âI had a father too, your honour: but he is
in the ground. Soft may the rain fall, and warm
may the sun shine on the turf that hides him!â

âIs not your name Dora Mahony? I was
told your father was alive, and engaged in some
unlawful doings hereabouts.â

âHe told me nothing of the nature of his
doings, and it is not from strangers that I wish
to learn them, when he is not here to speak for
himself. Keep what you have to say against
him till the judgment day.â

âHow long has your father been dead? We
know he left the glen with you.â

âHe was hid from the light of day before my
mother shut her eyes upon it for ever. One of my
griefs was, that he was not here to wake her.
O, it went to my heart to lay her out with my own
hands, and none to help: and I raised the cry
many times, and no one came. How should they
in such a lonesome place?â

âWhere was your husband, Dora? It was
not being a good husband to leave you at such a
time.â

âIt was before that, that he left me, and he
knew nothing of my state. Far, far away
he was before my mother breathed her last
blessing on him; if a blessing she had for him,

84
which is just what, with many other things, I
have no memory of, your honour. I was crazed
with grief, I suppose, for my husband having left
me; and all is lost and gone belonging to that
time, but the crying and crying on the cliff, and
nobody coming.â

She was next questioned about the shipwreck;
and here she was safe. She knew nothing of
the matter but by hearsay, and could not answer
a single question. Then came inquiries whither
her husband had gone. She did not know; from
place to place, she supposed, as he did before he
married. It was a sore temptation to a man to
leave a wife when he was turned out of his
tenantcy into a pesert like this, while he knew
that there were work and wages to be got elsewhere.âWhen
did she expect her husband back,
and how was she living in the mean time?âAs
for the living, it had been off the provision of
potatoes they brought with them; but it was
nearly gone, and she did not know what to look to
next. She had thought many a night and day
of seeking out Father Glenny and some of her
old neighbours; but the fear lest her husband
should come back and miss her, weighed with her
to stay where she was. As to when that return
would be, many was the morn when she said to
herself, as she did this morn, that he would come
before the sun went down; but the sun staid for
none, and solitary it ever left her, as solitary it
found her. They might as well ask her child
about it as her,âthe child that was now crying
for her in the cabin, and she must go to it.

85
As she turned, she found herself intercepted
by two soldiers, who barred her entrance. A
third went in and brought her baby to her. She
smiled, and said she did not object to being kept
out of her own cabin as long as the sky was fair
overhead.

âWill you take a solemn oath,â asked the
officer, âthat your husband is not concealed
within, or in the neighbourhood? and will you
deliver up arms and whatever else may belong
to him that is in your keeping?â

Dora declared that she feared an oath too
much to swear that her husband was not in any
place near, when she did not know where on the
face of Godâs earth he was. She would swear that
he was not in the cabin, nor any arms or other
things of his, unless it might be any article of
clothing left behind. She would swear that she
did not know whether he was north, south, east,
or west at that moment. This was thought
satisfactory, and she took the oath deliberately,
looking the officer full in the face as she spoke.
This done, the soldiers were ordered to search
the cabin, and Dora sat down on the ridge to
hush her baby to sleep, and catch opportunities
of throwing hasty glances down to the beach.âBefore
many minutes were over, the searchers
re-appeared, bringing with them a dozen pikes, a
blunderbuss, and three brace of pistols.

âYou brought them in yourselves,â said Dora
calmly. âThere were none there before, to my
knowledge.â

âCome, come, mistress,â said the officer;

86
âno more speeches. A false oath is enough for
one morningâs work, and more than you will be
able easily to answer for. You must come with
us and take your trial for perjury.â

Dora declared with such an appearance of
innocence that she neither knew of these arms
nor could imagine how they came there, and
inquired so naturally whereabouts they were
found, that the officer appeared to be moved. He
asked whether she would furnish him with a
written promise to appear when called upon, to
give her account of the matter to a magistrate, to
save the trouble of carrying her with them this
day. The simple Dora, delighted with so easy a
way of escape, and suspecting no artifice, wrote
the required promise in the officerâs pocket-book.
As soon as she had done, he took out a letter
and compared the hands. âSeize her,â said he
to a soldier beside her: âshe is our prisoner.â

âPrisoner!â repeated Dora, falteringly.

âOn two charges,â continued the officer;
âone of perjury, on account of the oath you took
just now; and the other of writing a threatening
letter to Major Greaves.â

Perceiving that some whispering was going
on among his men, the officer observed that the
crime of perjury was so much on the increase in
Ireland, as to make it necessary to prosecute it
with the utmost severity. The convictions for
perjury in Ireland were double the number in
England, and very many more who had been
undoubtedly guilty had hitherto escaped. In
the present state of the country, justice could
not
not

87
have its course while the people were apt to swear
falsely; and every instance of such swearing
must therefore be punished.

âWhat is it that drives the people to swear
falsely?â cried Dora. âYou first teach them to
take the holy name in vain by offering oaths that
they understand no more than this babe of mine.
There are oaths to the guager, and oaths at the
fair and the market, and oaths at elections, that
have no meaning at all to those that take them;
and the blessed book is tossed about as if there
was no more in it than old ballads. But when
you have driven us from our homes, and taken
from us all the bread but that which comes by
crime,âwhen you have dug a pit under our feet,
and thrown a halter over our necks, and made
our hearts sick, and our spirits weary, and our
consciences careless of what is gone and what is
to come,âwhen you hunt our husbands and fathers
and brothers till there is but one resting-place
for the sole of their feet,âthen you expect us of
a sudden to fear an oath, and to point out the
one hiding-place, and to deliver them up to be
hanged in the midst of a gaping crowd. This is
the way you make it a crime to love one another
as God made our hearts to love. This is the way
you breed hatred to the law, and then murder us
for hating it. This is the way you mock Godâs
truth, and then pretend to be jealous for it. This
is what you call the course of justice. It is such
a crooked course, that you will surely lose yourselves
in it one day.â

âIf you threaten me, Dora, by words, as you

88
threatened Major Greaves by letter, there will be
another charge against you.â

âAnd what are my threats?â replied she,
smiling bitterly. âYou may take me and murder
me by law or otherwise, and there will be none
that can call you to account, unless it be Father
Glenny. You will outlive yonder sun if your life
waits on my threats.â

The officer was not so sure of this when he saw
how earnestly she glanced from time to time
towards some particular spot in an opposite
direction from the alder bush. It was an artifice;
for Dora now began to be cunning, and to wish
an end to this visit, lest her husband should appear
from the beach. To various inquiries respecting
tracks in the direction in which she was looking,
she replied by asking, had they not better go
back the way they came, since they knew that
to be safe? By equivocating, hesitating, and
giving ambiguous answers, she effected her purpose
of determining the party to cross the most
perilous part of the bog, where, if not lost, they
would be disabled for further active service this
day. A soldier was left to guard her till their
return. As he ordered her into the cabin, and
the rest rode away, her heart smote her as if
she had their blood to answer for. She rushed
out to call them back, but was only ridiculed for
what was supposed to be her last device.

âI did not speak the word; I did not point
the way,â muttered she to herself. âThey can
witness against the devil himself that I called
them back, and they would not come. But, O!

89
when shall I see Father Glenny? If he was
here, he would tell me how much I may venture
as a woman, because I am a wife and a daughter.â

Still she felt as if murder was on her soul, and
her trouble of spirit showed itself in the hurry
of what she did. She picked a hole in the mud
wall of her cabin, since her guard would not
allow her to watch from without the proceedings
of the party. While thus engaged, she argued
within herself (like thousands of her countrymen
before her) the necessity of doing evil that good
might come; the expediency of betraying the
agents of the law, to avoid treachery to the
nearest and dearest; the duty of sacrificing enemies
in order to preserve those on whom the
heartâs love rests. Alas! for those who have
taught any thus to reason!

When she had made a chink large enough for
her purpose, she saw that the party had separated
a little in order to traverse more safely the boggy
tract before them. Each, however, appeared
shortly to be sinking, sinking;âand from a distance
came their faint shouts to one another;âand
the efforts to rein up and direct the struggling
horses were seen. The conviction that her
scheme was succeeding,âor, as she afterwards
said, the devil in actual presence,âgave her
courage to look on and act. Presently she stole
to the doorway to reconnoitre her guard. He
was standing with his back to the sea, watching
his party, and as if spasm-struck at their manifest
danger. Dora sprang at him like a tiger-cat

90
upon her prey. She hoped to throw him
down the cliff. At the first moment, she had
nearly succeeded; but he recovered his hold of her
while tottering on the verge, grappled strongly
with her for a few moments, and then mastered
her failing strength. He was in a tremendous
passion at her for her momentary advantage
over him, and showing it in other ways besides
oaths and foul names. He tied her hands painfully
behind her, and kicked her into the hut
again. The utmost mercy she could obtain
after a time, was having her bonds transferred to
her feet, for her infantâs sake. When this was
done, her guard told her to look through the
chink, and see what was coming. She thanked
heaven aloud when she saw the party returning,
bemired and exhausted, but undiminished in
number.

âWhy there, now,â said her guard; âthereâs
your Irish hypocrisy again! You thank God
that they are out of the bog, when you know
you would have them all sunk to the bottom of
it this minute, if you could. And you are the
people that call yourselves generous enemies!â

âI, for one, was not given to enmity till I
was driven to it,â said Dora.

When the discomfited party arrived, the prisoner,
with her infant in her arms, was mounted
behind a soldier, and carried off to jail. While
passing the alder-bush, she was in an agony lest
her father should leap out in her defence. She
carefully avoided looking that way and speaking,
while they were within hearing of the place.

91
Sullivan saw her pass; but aware of the hopelessness
of resistance, adopted the wiser course
of remaining where he was to inform Dan of
her fate; thus sparing the husband the misery,âalas!
too well known to some of his companions,âof
finding his house empty, and no intimation
why or whither his family had departed.

During her somewhat long and very toilsome
journey, Dora had no other consolatory thought
than that Dan had not come home this dreadful
morning.

Chapter VI.
Â
IRISH RESPONSIBILITY.

Mr. Tracey and his family returned from France
about this time, in consequence of the passing of
the Relief Bill. He had found, like many other
gentlemen of station and fortune, that the disabilities
under which he laboured on account of
his religious belief, were too galling to be borne
in the presence of those who were ready on all
occasions to taunt him with his incapacity; and,
like many other gentlemen, he returned, as soon
as established in his civil rights, to discharge the
offices which he had committed to others during
his absence, or from which he had hitherto been
excluded.

He was shocked and terrified at the aspect of

92
his estate and of the neighbouring country.
When he gave orders for the consolidation of the
small farms, he imagined that he had done all
that was necessary to secure the prosperity of
his tenantry; and as Mr. Flanagan had not
troubled him with any complaints from the
ejected, he supposed all had gone right as far as
he was concerned, and that the troubles in the
neighbourhood, of which report spoke, had an
origin for which he was in no way responsible.
When he found that the disaffected were those
from whose hands he had wrenched the means of
subsistence, and that his remaining tenantry
dared not for their lives enter upon the new
farms,âwhen he heard of the acts of malice and
depredation which had been committed, of the
lives lost, of the prisoners taken, of the utter
destruction of confidence between the upper class
and the lower in his neighbourhood, and remembered
how large a share he had had in doing all
this mischief,âhis first impulse was to go abroad
again, and get out of sight of his own work: but
his friend, Mr. Rosso, roused him to a better
course.

The first thing to be done was to find subsistence
for those who had been ejected. To settle
them as before would have been mending the
case but little. The great evil of over-population
was to be guarded against, at all events. Mr.
Tracey could not afford to give these people the
means of emigrating with advantage; but it
appeared to himself and his friend that if he
afforded them the opportunity of earning these

93
means, without taking work out of the hands of
any already employed, he would be making the
best atonement now possible for the errors of
his management. This might be done by beginning
some work which would improve the estate;
and there was little difficulty in deciding
what this work should be. A certain fishing
village lay at a short distance from the southern
extremity of Mr. Traceyâs estate; but from the
state of an intervening piece of land, little or no
communication was held between this village
and any of the places which lay to the north or
east of it. This piece of ground was level, and
almost perpetually overflowed, at some seasons
by the tide, and at others by land springs.
During a hot summer, the health of those who
lived within a certain distance was affected by
the taint the marsh gave to the atmosphere; and
by reason of the manifold evils which might be
referred to this slip of land, it had obtained the
name of the Devilâs Garden. It had long been
settled that a sea wall of small extent, and a road
and ditch would put an end to the fever, would
establish an advantageous communication with
the village, and probably convert this desert tract
into good land: but the consent of a neighbour
or two had not yet been obtained, because not
asked in earnest.

Mr. Tracey now asked in earnest and obtained.
In a short time his purpose was made known, and
candidates for emigration (to whom the offer of
employment was confined) dropped in from all
quarters, and established their claim as old

94
tenants or labourers on Mr. Traceyâs estate. No
questions were asked as to their mode of subsistence
during their disappearance. The object
was to win as many as possible from a life of
violence to one of hopeful industry, and this
object was gradually attained. Less was heard
of crime and punishment, week by week; and at
length Mr. Tracey had the satisfaction of knowing
that several individuals among these labourers
had resisted various inducements both of promises
and threats to become whiteboys.

âWhat is the meaning of their tickets?â inquired
Mr. Rosso, one evening, when the people
went to the paymaster on leaving work, and
Mr. Tracey and his friend stood by to observe the
proceeding.

âThese tickets are certificates of a dayâs work
being done. The men carry them to the clerk
yonder, who pays them what they absolutely
want for present subsistence, and places the rest
to their account in the emigration list. They are
getting on in the world, I assure you, by this
plan; and seem in a fair way to emigrate in
a better condition than our poor countrymen
usually do.â

âWhat, while earning only tenpence a day?â

âYes; you must remember that if these
wages are less than half what would be earned
in England at the same employment, the people
may live for as much less in proportion. A man
who earns six shillings a week here is as well off,
in his own opinion, as one who gains fifteen
shillings a week in England. An English

95
labourer would find it impossible to leave any
part of his daily tenpence in his landlordâs hands;
but a friend of mine, who gave no more, was paid
4000
l.
of arrears by his tenants, when he set them
to work on improvements of great magnitude
on his estate. My project of enabling these
people to emigrate, seems nothing in comparison
to his.â

âWhat a pity it seems, Tracey, that our people
should emigrate when there is so much to be
done at home,âso many bogs to be drained,âso
much fertile land to be tilled! But so it must
be. We want capital; and though our capital
is growing, we must limit the demands upon it
before we can materially improve the condition
of the people.â

âTrue,â replied Mr. Tracey; âsome of
them will do better abroad till we have learned
to manage our resources more wisely. We may
talk as we please about the fertility of our waste
lands, and the facilities for draining our bogs;
these cannot be made productive without capital;
and we have not capital to spare for such purposes,
while the present enormous demands are
made upon the subsistence fund by our overgrown
population.â

âIf the deficiency be of capital, Tracey, what
think you of those who carry Irish capital abroad?
What think you of the patriotism of absentees?
if one who has till now been an absentee will
tolerate such a question.â

âI think that an Irishman who loves his
country will do all he can to promote the increase

96
and judicious application of capital in it: but this
has nothing to do with the common question of
absenteeism. Our absentees do not usually apply
capital, but spend revenue in other countries;
which alters the question entirely; it being perfectly
immaterial in point of wealth to Ireland
whether her landlords are supported by Irish
produce abroad or at home.â

âAye; I have heard that this was your plea
for living abroad so long.â

âIt was an opinion which satisfied my conscience
in remaining abroad when I was driven
there by evils which are now remedied. If I had
not been satisfied that it is an error to suppose
that a country is impoverished in proportion to
the absence of its landlords, I would have borne
my exclusion from all offices but that of sub-sheriff,
and the obloquy with which our Protestant
gentry are apt to treat us true Irish, rather than
budge a step to the injury of the people. I am
speaking now of a landlordâs economical, not his
moral influence, you are aware.â

âCertainly. The moral effect of a landlordâs
residence depends much on the man and his way
of life. If he is a profligate, or brings down
profligates in his service into the country, he
may do a world of harm; and the contrary, if he
and his household bear an opposite character. A
really good agent, too, may exert as favourable a
moral influence as a good landlord; and as for
what a bad one can do, we need but look round
and see what are the results of Flanaganâs administration.
But, in an economical point of

97
view, do you suppose that the entire difference
between doing harm and no harm by absenteeism
consists in applying capital and spending
revenue?â

âI do, as regards the whole of Ireland. See
now. My agent collects my rents: shall we
say in raw produce, or in money?â

âBoth: raw produce first.â

âVery well. He sends me over to Paris five
hundred head of cattle, which I exchange for
French produce to be consumed within the year.
Now, how does it matter to Ireland whether I
exchange these cattle for something of the same
value to be consumed there, or whether I consume
the cattle at Paris?â

âIt cannot matter at all. If Ireland kept the
cattle, she would have the same amount less of
something else.â

âTo be sure. I am still living on Irish produce,
whether at Paris or in this glen. With a money-rent
the case would be precisely the same. If I
remained at home, Ireland would have more
money and less of the moneyâs worth.â

âThat is clear enough. But how would it be
if you fixed your revenue, instead of immediately
consuming it?â

âIf I consumed only a part of my revenue and
employed the rest in setting up a manufactory,
Ireland would remain in the same state as if I
consumed the whole; and in a worse state than
if I set up my manufactory within her borders.
If I withdrew any of my capital from her to support
my manufactory abroad, I should inflict on

98
her a positive injury. But absentees never do
this. When Irishmen invest capital abroad, it is
as emigrants, not as absentees.â

âSuppose, instead of setting up a manufactory,
you built a mansion in France, how would the
case stand then?â

âThe mansion would be Irish property;
erected with Irish funds, consumed (as long as it
deteriorated) by an Irishman, and the remaining
value to revert to Ireland at my death or at its
sale.â

âBut supposing it to be let to French tenants
for ever.â

âThen it would be an investment of capital,
and cease to bear any relation to the question of
absenteeism.â

âTrue, true. But it seems to me that there
must be a vast difference between using your
resources to put in motion Irish and French
industry. Have not the French been gainers all
this time, and the Irish losers, by your having
employed French workmen? Might not the
profits of Irish work-people in your service have
become substantial capital by this time, if you had
staid at home?â

âIreland has been as busy working for me all
this time, Rosso, as if I had staid at home: not
these my near neighbours, perhaps, but labourers
of one kind or another. My revenue must first
be spent here before my agent can get it for me
to spend anywhere else. The only difference is
that I myself might spend it in Irish bread, fish,
milk, linen, &c., while he lays out exactly its

99
equivalent in purchasing that which is to enable
me to buy French bread, milk, fish, and linens;
whether that which he purchases be labour and
raw material united in a manufacture, or raw
material which is the result of labour.â

âBut the plain question is, after all, Tracey,
whether you would have employed French labour
if you had lived at home?â

âI should not, except in as far as I live on
French wines; of which you know I am very
fond; but at the same time, I supersede a portion
of French labour by the produce of Irish labour
which I introduce into France. Neither should
I have employed more Irish labour at home than
when abroad. The amount of Irish commodities
which I should have consumed at home is exchanged
against French commodities; that is all.
It seems to me, Rosso, that since you feel perplexed
about this, you must have the idea that this
exchange is not an exchange of equivalents. Is
not that what you are thinking of? You should
remember that an exchange which is advantageous
to individuals on account of convenience,
&c. is a mere exchange of equivalents as regards
the country at large. The baker gains by exchanging
some of his loaves for broad-cloth; but
the same amount of wealth remains in the country
as before. In like manner, it is a convenience to
me to have my rents in money rather than cattle;
but it is the same thing to Ireland whether I
receive my revenue in the one form or the
other.â

âTrue: give me a case. Show me the effect

100
of sending your revenue to Paris through England.â

âVery well. Suppose the state of the exchange,
or anything else, renders it undesirable to
send me money; my agent sends cattle into
England to be exchanged for something more
convenient to me. Well; Ireland is minus my
yearâs consumption, just as if I had been there
during the year. The cattle is exchanged for
Sheffield and Manchester goods, which are to be
sent to France. Thus England is in the same
state as if I had remained in London, using
nothing but hardware and cottons. France gains
nothing by me, for I consume precisely as much
food, clothing and habitation as I give of knives
and ginghams. And the case would be the same
if my rents travelled round the world.â

âIs the outcry against absentees, then, so very
senseless?â

âAs far as regards the total wealth of a
country, I certainly conceive it to be so, much
as the residence of any one landlord may affect
the locality where his capital resides. I may
create a good deal of bustle about me by settling
down here; but some other class of producers
will have less to do than when I was abroad.
Ireland is neither richer nor poorer for my
return.â

âYet it is a common remark that bare fields
and broken fences on the one hand, or thriving
estates on the other, show at a glance whether
the proprietor is an absentee or a resident.â

âAye: but we forget that the industry of the

101
resident proprietorâs tenantry may be called into
action by the wants of the absentee. Their produce
finds its way to him through the market in
the shape of bills of exchange which represent
his revenue.â

âNothing can be clearer. I see it all now.
The coin which the tenants pay purchases produce
which is sent to the foreign country; and the bills
of exchange drawn by the exporter, and made
payable for the Irish produce exported, are the
form in which the absentee receives his rent: so
that Ireland sells one kind of produce to the
foreign market instead of an equal value of other
kinds to the absentee.â

âExactly so. Now, how can it signify to
Ireland where he eats his beef, as long as he
derives it from his own country?â

âIt cannot signify to the country at large, certainly.
You have confirmed me in the opinion I
have long held of the injustice of an absentee tax,
for which so many are clamouring.â

âTo be applied for the benefit of the poor, I
suppose. It seems to me the last thing in the
world likely to do any real good. You see the
whole revenue of an absentee is first spent at
home. Any part withdrawn as a tax would be
so much diverted from its natural course, for the
sake of being arbitrarily applied. It would only
affect the distribution of capital, not its amount;
and we all know that a natural distribution is more
favourable to the welfare of a country than an
arbitrary one.âAs a stigma upon absentees, it
would be unjust in a high degree; and as throwing

102
an unequal burden upon them, intolerably oppressive.â

âOne pretence is that absentees contribute nothing
to our domestic taxes: but the objectors
forget what taxes he is liable to as a proprietor of
land and houses, and what he pays on the
materials of manufactures.â

âAnd if he ought to be still further liable,
Rosso, let it be done in any way but that which
assumes to repair an injury done to his country
by his leaving her. There are many ways of
levying a tax on income or property which would
affect him; and thus let him pay, if his own
government is jealous of his assisting to support
that of France or of Italy; and if, moreover, it
overlooks the stimulus given by the absentee to
exchanges and manufactures. Suppose an absentee
should ere long be honoured as a benefactor
to his country.â

âIn Scotland the estates of absentees are
considered in a better condition on the whole
than those of residents; and the reverse is not
always the case here, Tracey.â

âWell: we will not decide the question any
further than to agree that the prosperity of an
estate depends mainly on the qualities of the
manager, be he landlord or be he agent. As for
the prevailing prejudice respecting absenteeism, it
may be trusted to go straight forward into the
gulf of oblivion, if we all help to point out its way
thither. Pity it is too late to atone to a host of
absentees for the undeserved censure which has
been cast upon them.â

103
âIf undeserved: but, Tracey, do you suppose
they have most of them thought much about their
countryâs good before they left her?â

âGod forbid that we should judge their
motives!â said Tracey. âI answer for none
but myself. I did thoroughly convince myself
before I set out that I should not injure my
country by going. Many, I doubt not, have been
driven away by political wrongs, either directly
inflicted on themselves, or inciting the peasantry
to hostility against their landlords; and many
more, probably, have hastened abroad to get out
of sight of misery which they could not relieve.
If I were to venture on judging my neighbour at
all in these instances, it should not be the absentee,
but the government; whose evil policy
prompted to absenteeism.â

âWell: instead of judging, let us anticipate,
since the past cannot be helped, and the future
may be bettered.â

âThat is what I try to comfort myself with
saying,â replied Tracey, looking round with a
sigh on his half-ruined estate and ragged corps
of labourers. âLet others try, like me, to remember
the past only as a warning; and let
government do with the country as I am doing
with my little corner of it. Let capital be well
secured and well husbanded, in order that it
may circulate with more confidence and become
more abundant. Let the people be more wisely
distributed over the surface, and let their surplus
be carried where labour is wanted. Let all
usurpers of unjust authority, all who make the

104
law odious, and justice a mockery, be displaced
from office as I have, displaced Flanagan. Above
all, let education be abundantly given, so as to
afford us hope that the people may in time understand
that their interests are cared for; and
that men who differ in religion and politics may
find it possible to live in fellowship, like ourselves,
friend Rosso.â

âLike ourselves, friend Tracey,â replied Rosso;
âand then farewell to all Catholic oaths to wade
knee-deep in Orange blood, and to all Protestant
likenings of the pope and his flock to the devil
and his crew.â

Chapter VIII.
Â
IRISH IMPOLICY.

The friendship between these gentlemen proved
of no little advantage to their neighbours when
an occasion presently arose for their co-operation
for the good of their parish.

News reached Mr. Rossoâs ears one day that a
strange gentleman was on a visit at the house of
a Protestant in the next parish, who had a field or
two in the glen, just advertised for sale. It was
immediately conjectured that the gentleman
came as a purchaser of this land; but it was not
till it had been repeatedly surveyed and measured
that any gossip could ascertain what he meant
to do with it. In due time, however, it transpired

105
that the stranger was a builder, and that
he was making his estimates for erecting a
church.

Mr. Rossoâs measures were immediately taken.
He sent to the proper quarters memorials of the
facts that he and his household, consisting of
fifteen persons, were the only Protestants in the
parish; that they stood in no need of a church,
that of the neighbouring parish being nearer
their dwelling than the field on which the new
one was proposed to be erected; and that ecclesiastical
burdens already weighed so heavily
on a miserably poor population, that it would be
absolute ruin to many to tax them further.
Moreover, Mr. Rosso sent a pressing invitation
to Mr. Orme, the incumbent, to take up his
abode with him for a week. Mr. Orme had not
appeared in his parish for some years; and there
was hope that what he might now see would
influence him to avert the dreadful infliction of a
church where there were no church-goers. Mr.
Tracey prepared Father Glenny for friendly intercourse
with his heretic brother pastor; and
all parties agreed that, if Mr. Orme should prove
the reasonable and kind-hearted man he was
reported to be, a further appeal should be made
to him on the subject of his tithes.

Mr. Orme came, and, before he went to rest the
first night, was convinced by ocular demonstration
that his hostâs dining-room could conveniently
contain the entire Protestant population of the
parish. The next morning, he was seen standing
with the priest on the ridge which overlooked

106
the glen, and heard to sigh over its aspect of
desolation.

âWhereabouts would you have your church
erected?â quietly asked Father Glenny.

âIndeed, I know little more than you,â replied
the clergyman. âI have not been consulted
upon the matter in regular form, and had no idea
it had gone so far. I fear it is a job, sir.â

âThe architect happens to have his hands
empty of contracts at present, perhaps,â observed
the priest: âand the owner of the field may hope
to gain a higher price for his land through the
agency of your church than direct from our poor
neighbours. But look round you, and find out,
if you can, where the parish is to obtain means
to answer such a call upon its resources.â

âIt is indeed a different place from what I
once remember it, though it had never much
wealth to boast of. When I occasionally lodged
here, it was in farmhouses where there was good
food and sufficient clothing, and sometimes a
pretty dower for the daughters on their marriage
day. I see no such places now. These hovels
are but the ruins of them.â

âToo true; and we preserve but the ruins of
some of our former practices. Dowries are rare
among the brides of this parish. Our old folks
are less hopeful, our young ones less patient than
formerly; and marriages are therefore rashly
entered into without a provision of any kind.â

âI am sorry, very sorry for it, sir. There is
more benefit than is at once apparent in the long
preparation of the marriage provision. I have

107
heard much ridicule of the old Scotch practice of
accumulating a stock of linen for bed and board,
which could scarcely be consumed in a lifetime;
but there was much good in it. Besides the
benefit to the parties concerned,âthe industry
and forethought it obliged them to exercise, and
the resources it put in their power,âthe custom
proved an important check upon population.
Young people had to wait two or three years
before they married; and where this was universally
the case, it was thought no hardship.
Those who thus began their married life were
never known to become paupers. But, sir, from
the aspect of this place, I should imagine your
entire flock to be paupers, except a tenant or two
yonder.â

âThe land is exhausted, Mr. Orme, and the
people are therefore poverty-stricken and reckless.
There is little encouragement to prudence
while there are superiors to keep a rapacious
hand in every manâs pocket, and appropriate
whatever he may chance to gain beyond that
which will support life. We know such to be
the results in Turkey, Mr. Orme, and in other
seats of despotic government, and why not
here?â

âWhom do you point at as these superiors?â
inquired Mr. Orme. âNot either of the landlords,
surely. And you are free, moreover, from
the locust-like devastation of the poor-law system.â

âTrue: but what pauperism leaves, the middlemen
consume; and what the middlemen leave,

108
the tithe-proctor consumes. Yonder field, sir,
has been let out of tillage because the tithe
devoured the profits. That row of hovels is
deserted because your proctor seized all that
rendered them habitable. Their inmates are
gone where they they live by plunder, since the
law of this district is to plunder or be plundered.â

âPlundered!â exclaimed Mr. Orme. âThat
is a somewhat harsh term, sir.â

âIs it an unjust one, Mr. Orme?âthat is the
question. What do these poor people gain in
return for the portion of their earnings wrenched
from them in the form of tithes? What does
the Protestant church do for these Catholic tithe-payers?â

Mr. Orme could only reply that the Protestant
church was established for the good of the people
at large; and that it was the peopleâs own fault
if they would not take advantage of the ministrations
of its clergy. He was ready, for one,
to do duty as soon as his flock would listen to
him; and, in the meanwhile, he conceived that
he was causing no wrong to any man by receiving
the means of subsistence decreed him by
law. He would not defend the mode of payment
by tithe in any country, or under any circumstances.
He saw its evils as an impediment to
improvements in agriculture, and as an unequal
tax, falling the most heavily on the most industrious
cultivator; but while payment by tithe
was the method appointed by law, he could not
allow that its exaction deserved the name of

plunder.
plunder.

109
âWith or without law,â observed Father
Glenny, âit appears to me plunder to force payment
for offered services, which are not only
declined but regarded with dislike or contempt:
in which light we know the services of the Protestant
clergy are justly or unjustly regarded by
our Catholic population. If you, sir, were a
pastor in the Vaudois, and your flock under the
dominion of some Catholic power, could you see
one deprived of his only blanket, and another of
his last loaf of bread, and a third of his sole
portion of his field-crop, for the maintenance of
a clergy whom they never saw, and not call it
plunder, let the law stand as it might? And
could you acknowledge your people to be justly
charged with disaffection if they looked with an
unfriendly eye on the priestly agent of this
robbery, and muttered deep curses against his
employer?â

No answer being returned, the priest invited
his companion into certain of the dwellings near.

âTo be looked on with an unfriendly eye?â
asked Mr. Orme, smiling bitterly. âTo be
greeted with deep curses?â

âBy no means, sir. I question whether an
individual whom we shall meet will know the
pastor of his parish. If you keep your own
counsel, you may see things as they are. If you
have courage, you may hear by what means
your 400
l.
a year has been levied.â

âI will; on condition that you will allow me
to speak as plainly to you on your relation to

110
the people as you have spoken on mine. Will
you bear with my rebukes in your turn?â

âI will,â replied the priest, âwhen I have
finished my say. Do you conceive it just and
merciful to Ireland that she should support four
archbishoprics, and eighteen bishoprics, the total
number of her Protestants being smaller than in
certain single dioceses in England?â

âCertainly not. I have long advocated a
reduction of our establishment. I would go so
far as to make the four archbishoprics maintain the
whole, which would strike off at once 100,000
l.

a-year from the revenues of the church. I
would go farther, sir; and this will, I hope,
prove to you that I am not one of the locust-tribe
to which you would assign me. I would
commute the tithes for lands, in order to avoid
the individual oppression of which the people
complain.â

Father Glenny observed that he did not wonder
the plan of commutation was rising into
favour now that it was found impossible to collect
tithes in the old method: but the nation might
be found as impracticable respecting one mode
of paying tithes as another; and he wished to
know what was to be done in case of its declining
the commutation proposed.

âThe plan must be enforced,â replied Mr.
Orme; âand, moreover, the arrears must be
recovered by the strong arm of the law.â

âWhence can they be obtained?â asked
Father Glenny. âHow are you to compel the

111
cottier who consumes his scanty crop, season by
season, to pay the collected tithe-dues of several?
I say nothing of the danger to yourselves
and your families,âdanger to life and property,âof
enforcing your claim. I say nothing now
of the violence which must attend upon such an
effort. I merely ask whence the arrears are to
be obtained in an impoverished country?â

âThey must be converted into a government
debt. By this means, the nation will learn the
real disposition of the government towards its
own ecclesiastical servants and those who refuse
them their lawful rights. By this means, the
consent of my brethren at large to a commutation
of tithes will be most easily obtained. Yes; the
arrears of tithe must be converted into a government
debt.â

âBy this means,â replied the priest, âthe
burden will be imposed where it is not due. Our
cottiers cannot pay; and you would therefore
have their richer neighbours discharge their arrears:âa
vicarious obligation of a new kind!âNo!
this will scarcely be tolerated, believe me.
You will carry neither of your points;âneither
the payment of arrears nor commutation; the
people having discovered a method of evading
the payment entirely. Better waive your claim
altogether, Mr. Orme, while there is yet time to
do it with a good grace, or you will have the
same trouble about tithe cattle that multitudes of
your brethren have. You will pound them in
vain; attempt in vain to sell them; carry them

112
over the sea in vain; and find too late that all
you have gained is the name of oppressor.â

Mr. Orme muttered that it was a very hard
case.

âWho can help it?â inquired the priest. âIf
the subsistence-fund was not ample enough to
afford tithes when due, in a poor district like this,
how should it discharge an accumulation of debt?
Here we have many more people, very little more
capital, less industry, less forethought than when
the debt was contracted. All the constituents of
the subsistence-fund have become more or less
debased, and yet you would tax it more heavily
than ever. You must fail in your object, sir.â

âI will learn the truth for myself, instead of
taking the assertion of any man whatever,â replied
Mr. Orme, moving onwards towards a cluster of
dwellings, into which he was introduced as a
friend by the priest, and not therefore suspected of
being the clergyman of the parish. All that he
heard told the same tale; all that he saw confirmed
it. The new church was spoken of in
terms of execration, in which the parson and the
proctor largely shared. One woman told how
the wealthy churchman was living far away from
his cure, subsisting his dogs on the food snatched
from her childrenâs mouths; and another showed
where her son lay buried, having been smitten
with fever in consequence of his useless over-toil
to satisfy the demands of the rapacious agents of
the law. Others pointed with moody mirth to
their desolated dwellings, as affording a sign that

113
the legal spoilers were not far off. Others observed
that there would be few conversions to the
Protestant faith in the parish, while the clergy
snatched the loaves and fishes from the multitude
instead of bestowing them. Yet more exhibited
their uncomplaining poverty in their looks and
dress rather than by words; and only gazed
round their little tenements in perplexity at the
mention of the dues that must be paid.

Mr. Orme had hitherto been a prejudiced man
on the subject of his own rights; but he was open
to conviction, and at length roused to ascertain
the truth of his own case. He spent the whole
of this day and the next in rendering himself
acquainted with the condition of the people, and
used no reserve with Father Glenny respecting
the impression made upon his mind. Towards
the conclusion of his investigation, he stopped
short, and ended a long pause by exclaiming,

âI do not see how it is to be done! Setting
aside all considerations of law and justice, I do
not see the possibility of obtaining my dues from
these poor people.â

âNor I, Mr. Orme. What follows this conviction
in your mind?â

âI scarcely know yet, further than that I shall
give up my claim altogether, if, after a little
consideration, I view the matter as I do now.â

âThen you will prove, as I expected, a faithful
servant of your church; more heedful to her
honour and usefulness than to your own peculiar
gain.â

âReserve your praise, I advise you, sir, till

114
you have heard me out. By giving up my claim
altogether, I mean only while the people are in
their present state. When the subsistence-fund
improves, when industry and forethought thrive,
the people will be again in a condition to pay
tithe, and will perhaps,â he added, smiling, âbe
my own flock, in allegiance as well as by destination,
if Mr. Rosso and you continue your care
of the school.â

âI will try the venture with you,â replied the
priest, smiling also. âLet our respective faiths
be tried by the increasing light of the people. If
this is also your wish, you will dispossess my flock
of the prejudices they entertain against your
church on account of her oppressions.â

âThis reminds me,â said Mr. Orme, âof what
I have to say against your relations with your
flock. How do you defend your own emoluments
while you complain of mine?â

Father Glenny, astonished, began to explain
that he derived from his flock little more than
would barely supply his wants. A hard couch, a
frugal board, homely clothing, left him but a
pittance with which to relieve the most pressing
distress he encountered.

âOf all this I am aware,â replied Mr. Orme.
âIn these respects your lot resembles that of too
many faithful servants of our church, who give
their most strenuous exertions for a very poor
worldly return. What I now complain of is not
the amount of your recompense, but the mode in
which it is levied. How can you in one hour
lament those evils of the peopleâs state which

115
arise from the disproportion of their numbers to
their means of subsistence, and in the next, consent
to receive your emoluments in a way which
exposes you to the charge of encouraging an
increase of numbers?â

âThe charge is false,â replied the priest. âMy
brethren and I do not make marriages, though
we celebrate them with a view to the glory of God
and the fulfilment of his holy commandment.
We are supposed to know nothing of an intended
marriage till requested to solemnize it; and to
refuse to discharge our office, with all the customs
appertaining to it, would be to encourage sin.â

âI lay no charge to the door of any one man
among you,â replied Mr. Orme. âI only observe
that by receiving your emoluments chiefly in the
shape of marriage fees, you expose yourselves to
the suspicion of encouraging marriage; a suspicion
which is much strengthened by your emphatic
approbation of such connexions as often
as you solemnize them, and by your known tremendous
power over the minds of your flocks,
obtained through the practice of confession. Hear
me out, my good sir. I am not about to enter
upon any controversy respecting the diversities
in our discharge of the clerical office. I would
only recommend to you, if you wish to place
yourselves above the suspicion I have alluded to,
to separate your worldly interest altogether from
this particular rite. Appoint any other way
you may choose of receiving your dues; but if
you really believe your people to be prone to
form imprudent marriages, if you are actually

116
convinced that over-population is a principal
cause of their distresses, remove from yourselves
all temptation to connive at imprudent marriages
and to sanction over-population: remove from
the minds of your people all idea that they are
gratifying and rewarding you by asking you to
marry them; cancel every relation between the
wedding propensities of the young and the welfare
of their priestâs purse.â

âI agree with you,â replied the priest, âthat
there is much that is objectionable in the modes
in which we each receive our emoluments. You
condemn tithes, and I condemn marriage fees,
given as they are given now by the guests as
well as the parties. The fee thus exposes us to
the temptation and suspicion you speak of, without
having the beneficial effect of obliging the young
couple to save before they marry, like the Scotch
ancient custom respecting house linen. It is for
the state to remedy this evil by providing otherwise
for us.â

Mr. Orme thought this was jumping to a conclusion
in a terrible hurry. Why should not the
same amount be given in a more judicious manner
by the flock, instead of involving government at
all in the matter? This point was argued till
both gentlemen decided that the only method by
which the permanent prosperity of the people
could be secured was the general diffusion of
such knowledge as would make them judges of
their own condition and controllers of their own
destinies. The Protestant and Catholic perfectly
agreed that to further the grand object of education,

117
it was worth while to concede certain
points which elsewhere each would have strenuously
insisted on; and that, should an impartial
plan of general education be framed by government,
it would be the duty, and would probably
appear to be the disposition of all but a small
minority of the factious and bigoted, to render
hearty thanks for the boon, and all possible
assistance towards the efficient working of the
scheme.

âIf this should be done speedily,â observed
the Protestant, âI may live to be called hither to
receive my dues in recompense of the services
which I would fain render now, if the people
would but receive them.â

âIf this be done speedily,â observed the Catholic,
âmy brethren and I may live to see ourselves
and our flocks no longer looked down upon
by our scornful neighbours of your church as
constituting a degraded caste. The law has at
length emancipated us from our civil disabilities:
it remains for education to lift us out of that
worse and equally undeserved degradation whence
the law cannot raise us up.â

The result of Mr. Ormeâs survey of his parish,âmade
known after long deliberation on his
part, much consultation with Mr. Rosso, and
intimate intercourse with the people,âwas, that
he relinquished altogether his claim for tithes for
the present, on the ground that it was impossible
for the people to pay them.

All the endeavours of Father Glenny and his
enlightened neighbours to make the people grateful

118
for this concession were in vain. When they
heard of the changes made by Mr. Ormeâs family
in their way of living, of the luxuries they surrendered,
and the frugality they were obliged to
exercise, the only remark was that these things
had been fraudulently enjoyed thus long, as the
nominal reward of services which had never been
rendered. When reminded that the remission
was an act of free grace on Mr. Ormeâs part,
they replied âThank him for nothing. He would
never have got another pound of tithe in this
parish, as he probably knows. He gives up only
what he could not touch.â

When he rode away, ready to bestow kind
looks on every side, he only met dubious smiles
from those who gazed after him from field and
cabin, and who observed to one another that it
was a great blessing to have one priest for a guide,
but rather too much to have another and a strange
one on their backs. To wish him well away was
the utmost extent of their courtesy.

From another quarter, however, Mr. Orme
had thanks. The three gentlemen whom he
left behind considered themselves beholden to
him for the absence of the tumultuous excitement
which elsewhere attended the useless endeavour
to exact tithes. This parish was saved all opposition
of forces between the âloyalâ and the
âdisaffected;â that is, between the oppressors
and the oppressed. There was no need to cry
out for the Insurrection Act on the one hand, or
to threaten or perpetrate mischief on the other.
The architect was seen no more. The field

119
which he had surveyed bore oats instead of a
church,âa happy circumstance; since the people
were much in want of food for the body, while
they had enough of that for the spirit, and of
the kind which they preferred, in Mr. Traceyâs
chapel.

Chapter VII.

IRISH FATALITY.

Dora was long in gaol before she could form an
idea what was to become of her. The place was
crowded, in consequence of the late disorders in
her native district; and her child pined for want
of the bracing air to which it had been accustomed
from its birth. Night after night when
she was kept awake by its wailing, day after day
when she marked how its little limbs wasted, did
the mother sigh to be one of those whose lot she
had till now thought very wretched. She would
fain have been among such as were driven from
the glen to seek a subsistence in the towns, begging
by day, and nestling wherever they could
find a hole by night. When she was brought
into the town, she met several of these, whose
faces she well knew, changed as they were from
the cheerful or thoughtful countenances of dwellers
in a home to the listless or bold expression which
characterises vagrants. She now envied them
their freedom, however mournful their condition

120
in other respects. They might carry their babes
abroad into the free air, and if too much crowded
in their noisome abodes, sleep under the open
sky. They might meet their proscribed connexions,
if such they had, without other restraints
than their own prudence imposed: while she
must see her infant languish for want of that
which nature designed for all; and live on from
day to day without hope of beholding husband or
father, or of knowing what had become of them.

The first relief she found was in forming a
desperate resolution respecting her infant. She
had passed a long, wakeful night in such a state
of distress as even she had seldom known. The
heat was stifling, from many sleepers being
collected within a small space. Her child would
not lie still on her bosom one moment. Sometimes
screaming, sometimes wailing, its signs of
suffering wrung its motherâs heart. She was
first irritated and then terrified by the complaints
of all who were disturbed like herself, and who
seemed to think it her fault that the child would
not rest. Hour after hour was she kept on the
stretch, watching for tokens of fatigue from the
child, or of mercy from her neighbours; but the
heat increased, fresh cries wore her nerves, and
new threats of getting rid of the nuisance made
her feel as if every pulse in her body would burst.
She threw herself down on her pallet, on the side
of which she had been sitting, and closed her eyes
and ears, mutteringâ

âGod help me! and take me and my child
where we may sleep in peace and no waking!

121
My mind is just going as it did one night before;
and let it go, if my child was but safe with its
father. Little would it matter then what became
of me; for Dan and I shall never meet more.
O! hush, my child! hush! I could part with
you for ever if I could only ease you from wailing,
and from this sore strife. There is a curse upon
me, and upon you while you live on my bosom.
You never caress me, my child; you struggle out
of my grasp! Other babes clasp their mothers,
but you push me away. Well you may! God
gave you free and strong limbs and an easy
breath; and âtis I that have laid a withering curse
on your flesh, and a heavy load on your little
breast. âTis I that have dropped poison in your
veins. You shall go, my child. I will bear to
be haunted all my days with your screams and
your throes; I will bear to lie down without you,
and wake, feeling for you in vain; I will bear to
fold my empty arms when I see babes laughing
in the sunshine, and wonder whether you are
playing on the sod or lying beneath it,âif I can
free you from my curse, and trust your little life
to those who can nourish it better than I. O
hush! my child. Bear with me this last night!
If I could but see you but once more quiet, if you
would only once lay your little hand on my lips,
if you would but look at me!âAgain, again,
again! your life will be spent, my child; you
will die before I can save you!âO, neighbours!
do ye think itâs my will that my child should
suffer this way? Do you think its cries do not
pierce my ears more than yours? Is it worse

122
for you to lose a nightâs sleep than for me to be
parting with my child for ever?â

The softened grumblers inquired the meaning
of her words, and praised her for intending to
send the babe out of the gaol immediately, only
complaining that it had not been done long before.
All were ready to help her with suggestions
how to dispose of it; none of which suggestions,
however, satisfied her.

All difficulty on this head was removed the
next day by the appearance of Father Glenny,
who came, as he had done once or twice before,
to administer to the religious wants of several of
his flock who had found their way hither. He
was shocked at the change in Dora since he last
saw her, and thought the child dying. He engaged
at once to have it carried out of the prison
and conveyed into safe hands. Whose hands
these were, he could not disclose, as Sullivanâs
retreat was made known to him under the seal
of confession, and the circumstances must not be
revealed even to the old manâs only child. Of
Dan the priest had heard nothing. No one had
seen or heard of him since some days previous
to Doraâs capture.

The only thing which struck the priest as remarkable
in Doraâs state of mind was her utter
indifference respecting her approaching trial. It
seemed never to occur to her; and when she was
reminded of it, it appeared to be regarded as a
slight and necessary form preliminary to her
going away for ever. She never took in the idea
of acquittal, or remembered that she had a part

123
to perform, and that she was one of two contending
parties, with either of whom success might
rest. She made no complaints of being a passive
instrument in the hand of power, or of any hardship
in the treatment she had experienced or was
still to bear. She made no preparation of her
thoughts for defence or for endurance. She was
utterly unmindful of what was coming, taking for
granted that she should never more see her husband,
and beyond this, having no thought where
she was to spend her days, or how she was to end
them. This state appeared so unnatural, that the
priest, after enlarging in vain on her accusation
and means of defence, ventured to rouse her by
mentioning a report he had heard that an attempt
was to be made to rescue her and her companions
by breaking the gaol before the trials, or by
attacking the guard which should conduct some
to the gibbet and others to the coast, when their
doom was to be enforced. For a moment a gleam
of hope kindled in her eyes; but she immediately
observed that if the report was abroad, the magistrates
were no doubt on their guard, and the whiteboys
would ascertain the attempt to be vain
before they committed themselves. After this,
however, it was observed that she could recollect
nothing. She had nothing to confess, nothing
to ask for, no messages to leave, no desires to
express. With a dull, drowsy expression of
countenance, she looked at the priest when he
rose to leave her, and seemed to ask why he
stood waiting.

124
âYour child, my daughter,â said he, extending
his arms to receive the babe.

With a start and a flushed cheek, she hastened
to wrap it in the only garment of her own which
she could spare to add to its scanty clothing.
After a cold kiss, she placed it in the arms of its
new guardian, saying with a stiff smile,

âI wonder whether there are any more such
mothers as I am! I forget all about my childâs
coming to me, and I donât think I care much
about its going from me. Iâm past caring about
any thing at times.â

âAnd at other times, daughterâ--â

âHush, hush, hush! donât speak of them now.
Well; there have been widowed wives and childless
mothers; and I am only one more; and
what is to come is dark to us all, except that
there is death for everybody.âNo blessing, father,
to-day! It has never done me any good, and I
cannot bear it. Try it upon that little one, if
you like.â

As soon as the priest was gone, muttering
amidst his tears the blessing to which she would
not listen, Dora threw herself down on her pallet
and instantly slept. She scarcely woke again till
called up, eight and forty hours after, to prepare
for trial.

Sleep had restored her to perfect sanity, and
a full and deep consciousness of her misery. A
demeanour of more settled sorrow, a countenance
more intensely expressive of anguish, were never
seen in that or any other court. She was silent

125
from first to last, except when called upon for
the few necessary words which her counsel could
not say for her. Though deeply attentive to the
proceedings, she appeared to sustain no conflict
of hope and fear. In her mind it was evident
that the whole matter was settled from the beginning.

She had all that law and justice, the justice of
a law court, could give her. Her countrymen
must still wait for the more enlightened law, the
more effectual justice whose office is rather to
obviate than to punish crime: but all that pertains
to law and justice, after the perpetration of
crime, Dora had, both in the way of defence and
infliction. She had good counsel, an impartial
jury, a patient and compassionate judge. She
was accordingly fairly tried and condemned to
transportation for life, on the first charge; the
second was waived as unnecessary, the issue of
the first being a conviction.

As the condemned was leaving the court, she
heard (for on this day nothing escaped her) the
lamentations of one who had known her from
her infancy, over her having had an education.
âIf she had never been taught to write,â urged
her sage neighbour, âthis murtherous letter
could never have been brought against her.â
To which some one replied that she would still
have been convicted of perjury.

âIs there no language to threaten in,â asked
Dora, speaking rapidly as she passed, âbut that
which is spelled by letters? Overthrow every
school in the country, empty all your ink into the

126
sea, make a great fire of all your paper, and you
will still find threats inscribed wherever there is
oppression. There will be pictures traced in the
sands of the sea-shore; there will be pikes stuck
up on each side the doors; there will be mock
gibbets for signals, and a multitude of scowling
brows for warnings. Let those who are above
us look within themselves, and as sure as they
find these traces of tyrannical desires, will they
see round about them marks of revengeful plots,
though the people under them may be as brutish
in their ignorance as slaves in their bondage.
When do prosperous men plot, or contented men
threaten, or those who are secure perjure themselves,
or the well-governed think of treachery?
Who believes that conspiracy was born in our
schools instead of on our cold hearths, or that
violence is natural to any hands but those from
which their occupation and their subsistence are
wrenched together? The school in which my
husband and I learned rebellion was the bleak
rock, where famine came to be our teacher. A
grim set of scholars she hadâââ

âWhat is the prisoner talking about?â cried
a potential voice from behind. âRemove her,
officer!â

127

Chapter IX.

IRISH DISAFFECTION.

The rumour of the intention of the whiteboys
to break the gaol, or otherwise rescue the prisoners,
was unfounded. Since the new works
were begun on Mr. Traceyâs estate, the numbers
of the disaffected in the district had lessened considerably,
and those who remained were for the
most part employed on distant expeditions. Dan
had been out of his own neighbourhood so long
that he heard of Doraâs capture only a few days
before her trial, his father-in-law having failed in
his attempt to give him immediate intelligence of
the event. The exasperated husband vowed, as
soon as he learned her sentence, to move heaven
and earth to rescue her; and all that one man
could do to this end he did: but he was not
heartily seconded by his companions; they considering
the attempt too hazardous for their present
force, and not seeing that this case required
their interference more than many which were
presented to their observation every day. If their
attempt had been agreed upon and planned ever
so wisely, it would have been baffled by the fears
of the magistrates, who, alarmed by the rumours
afloat, determined to send the convicts round by
sea to the port where the convict-ship awaited
them, instead of having them traverse the
island. A small vessel was secretly engaged to
wait off the coast at the nearest point, to receive

128
the convicts, before it should be known that they
had left the gaol.

Father Glenny, who was aware of the scheme,
and therefore prepared to make his parting visit
at the right time to the unhappy outcasts from
his flock, repaired to Mr. Traceyâs when his painful
duty was done, dispirited, and eager for some
relief from the harrowing thoughts which the
various interviews had left behind. Mr. Tracey
invited him to inspect the works, and see what
had been done thereby for the estate and for the
people. They rode to the shore just as the
labourers were leaving work, and at the proper
time for conversing with some of them respecting
their prospects, and the hopes and views with
which they were about to begin life in another
land. An ardent desire to emigrate was found to
prevail: a desire arising out of hatred to middlemen
and tithe-proctors, discontent with as much
as they knew of the law, and despair of permanently
improving their condition at home. They
acknowledged their landlordâs justice in enabling
them to remove advantageously, smiled at the victory
over Mr. Orme, on which they prided themselves
as a grand parting achievement, and spoke
with gratitude of the kindness of Mr. Rossoâs
family during their time of sore distress; but the
only person among their superiors in whom they
seemed to place implicit confidence was Father
Glenny. To him they said little of the barrier
which they believed to separate the rich and the
poor in Ireland: on him no man among them
looked with an evil eye; against him were directed

129
no remarks that there was one sort of justice for
the powerful and another for the helpless. Their
affection being strong in proportion as it was
concentrated, they almost adored their priest,
and swore that when their wives and children
should have followed them abroad, Father Glenny
would be the only tie to their native district
which they would be unwilling to break.

âHow different an embarkation will theirs
be!â he observed to his companion, when he had
given his blessing and passed on along the ridge
of the cliff. âHow different a departure from that
of their brethren who are sent away as criminals!
Here, the husband goes in hope of soon welcoming
his family to a home of better promise than
they leave; there a wife is carried away alone,
in disgrace, severed for ever from her husband
and her child. It makes one thoughtful to consider
that the least painful of these departures
might possibly have been rendered unnecessary
by a wiser social management; but, as for the
the other, we ought to kneel in the dust, crying
for mercy, till Heaven shall please to remove
from us the scourge of crime, and the heart-withering
despair which follows it. If you had
seen and heard what I have seen and heard this
day, you would tremble at the retribution which
is sent upon the people and their rulers. Let us
pray day and night to avert it!â

âAnd in the intervals of our prayers, father,
let us exert ourselves to avert it by removing the
abuses from which it springs. Instead of applying
palliatives, let us go to the root of the evil.

130
Instead of providing a legal relief for our poor,
which must in time become a greater burden than
we now labour under, we must remove the
weights which oppress their industry, guard
against the petty tyranny under which they suffer,
and all the while, persevere in educating, and
still educating, till they shall be able to assist our
reforms; to understand the law beneath which
they live; instead of defying it, to respect the government
(by that time more efficient to secure
the objects at which it aims); and to act upon
the belief that men of various creeds and ranks
and offices may dwell together without enmity.
May not all this come of education, coupled with
political reforms, and sanctioned by the blessing
we pray for?â

âHeaven grant it may!â exclaimed the priest,
who was now attentively observing some one who
was sitting on the sunny side of a fence which
ran to the very verge of the rock. It was an old
man, with a babe on his knee, to whom he was
alternately talking and singing in a feeble,
cracked voice. His song was of the sea, to
which he looked perpetually, and over which the
setting sun was trailing a long line of glistering
gold, to the great delight of the infant as well as
its guardian.

âIt is Sullivan!â exclaimed the priest, âand
it is poor Doraâs child that he holds on his knee.
True it is that God feeds the young ravens that
cry. Yonder babe has thriven in this desert as
if its nightly rest were on its motherâs bosom.
The old man, too, looks cheerily. You will not

131
take advantage, my son, of his having ventured
above ground in a still hour like this. You will
not bid the law take its course on one whose
gray hairs came before his crimes began?â

âNot for the world,â said Tracey. âShall
we alight and speak to him, or would it alarm
him too much?â

They drew near while still unobserved by the
old man, whose noisy sport hindered his hearing
their footsteps. At this moment, a small vessel
appeared from behind a projecting rock, her sails
filled with a fresh north wind, and appearing of
a snowy whiteness as they caught the sunlight.
When she shot across the golden track, the babe
sprang and crowed in the old manâs arms.

âThe saintsâ blessing on ye, my jewel!â cried
he, in almost equal glee. âItâs there you would
be, dancing on the blue waves, instead of in my
old arms, that will scarcely hold you in more
than an unbroken colt, my pretty one! There
she goes, my darling,

Full of boys so frisky

With the sweet-smelling whiskey,

Flying over seas and far away;

Good luck go with âemâââ

âSullivan!â cried the priest, who could no
longer endure this ill-timed mirth.

The old man scrambled up in a moment, and
made his obeisance before the mournful gravity
of his pastor.

âSullivan!â continued Father Glenny, âDo
you know that vessel? You cannot be aware
what freight it bears! Youâââ

132
âI know now all about it,â replied the old
man, pettishly. âHow could your reverence
expect my old eyes to see so far off what ship
Dora was on board of? And what makes your
reverence bring his honour to be a spy on an old
manâs disgrace, unless he comes to catch me, and
send me after Dora? âTis near the hour when
foxes and justices come out after their prey.
You may have me for the catching, your honour;
and much good may it do you to have got me.â

He would not listen to a word Mr. Tracey
had to say, but went on addressing the child, as
if no one had been present, his glee being, however,
all turned to bitterness.

âAgh, my jewel! and you knew more nor I,
while you sprung as a lamb does when the ewe
bleats. Stretch your arms, my darling, for your
mother is there; and fain would I bid ye begone
to her, though it would leave me alone in the
wide world, where thereâs not a thing my eyes
love but you, babby dear!â

And so he went on, sitting doggedly down
with his back to the gentlemen, who retreated,
intending to come again the next day, when he
might be in a more communicative mood. At
some distance they looked once more behind
them, and saw that another man had joined
Sullivan, and was standing over him, pointing
to the receding vessel.

âIt is Dan!â cried the priest, quickly turning
his horse and riding back. Before he could
reach the spot, Dan had snatched a hasty kiss of
his infant, and disappeared. The old manâs

133
countenance was now fallen, and his tone subdued.

âYou will never see Dan more,â said he,
âthough you may hear much of him. The just
and merciful will never see his face again, and
he has forsworn his priest. Where he will show
himself from this time, it will be in the dead of
the night, with a crape on his face and a pike in
his hand. They that have made him mad must
put up with a madmanâs deeds.â

âMad!â cried Tracey.

âHe means exasperated,â replied the priest.
âDan hoped to the last to rescue his wife, and
the failure has made him desperate.â

âIâm alone now in the world entirely,â muttered
Sullivan, rocking the now wearied infant to
sleep. âBarring this orphanâs, I shall see little
of the face of man. It was the face of a devil
that bent over us just now. Long may it be before
it scares us again.â

Sullivan said truly, that Dan would henceforth
be heard of and not seen by any but the victims
of his violence. He who was once the pride is
now the scourge of the Glen of the Echoes.

Summary of Principles illustrated in this Volume.

Whatever affects the security of property, or
intercepts the due reward of labour, impairs the
subsistence-fund by discouraging industry and
forethought.

Partnership tenantcies affect the security of property
by rendering one tenant answerable for the
obligations of all his partners, while he has no
control over the management of their portions.

A gradation of landlords on one estate has the
same effect, by rendering one tenant liable to the
claims of more than one landlord.

The levying of fines on a whole district for an
illegal practice going on in one part of it, has the
same effect, by rendering the honest man liable
for the malpractices of the knave.

The imposition of a church establishment on
those who already support another church, intercepts
the due reward of labour, by taking from
the labourer a portion of his earnings for an object
from which he derives no benefit.

The practice of letting land to the highest
bidder, without regard to former service or to the
merits of the applicants, intercepts the due reward
of the labourer, by decreeing his gains to expire
with his lease.

All these practices having prevailed in Ireland,
her subsistence-fund is proportionably impaired,

135
though the reduction is somewhat more than
compensated by the natural growth of capital.

While capital has been growing much more
slowly than it ought, population has been increasing
much more rapidly than the circumstances of
the country have warranted: the consequences of
which are, extensive and appalling indigence, and
a wide spread of the moral evils which attend it.

An immediate palliation of this indigence would
be the result of introducing a legal pauper-system
into Ireland; but it would be at the expense of
an incalculable permanent increase of the evil.

To levy a poor-rate on the country at large
would be impolitic, since it would only increase
the primary grievance of an insufficiency of capital,
by causing a further unproductive consumption
of it.

To throw the burden of a pauper system on
absentees would be especially unjust, since they
bear precisely the same relation to the wealth of
their country as its resident capitalists.

In the case of Ireland, as in all analogous
cases, permanent relief can be effected only by
adjusting the proportions of capital and population:
and this must be attempted by means
suited to her peculiar circumstances.

The growth of capital should be aided by improvements
in agricultural and domestic economy,
and by the removal of political grievances; from
which would follow a union in place of an opposition
of interests.

136
Population should be reduced within due limits,

In the present emergency, by well-conducted
schemes of emigration; and

Permanently, by educating the people till they
shall have become qualified for the guardianship
of their own interests.

midline are retained regardless of other unhyphenated occurences
(whiteboys/white-boys, goodwill/good-will, farmhouse/farm-house,
halfpenny/half-penny, almsgiving/alms-giving).

Other errors deemed most likely to be the printerâs have been corrected, and

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

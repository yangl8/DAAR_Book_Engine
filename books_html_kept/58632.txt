Introduction.

Almost four years have elapsed since the surrender of
General Lee at Appomattox Court House, and as yet
nothing has been presented to the world to show the
prominent part taken in the Great Rebellion by the sons
of Maryland. It is a glorious and important page in
her honored history, and future generations seem likely to look
in vain for a record of the patient suffering and heroic achievements
of their forefathers when struggling for their rights against
Yankee tyranny and oppression, and which was not surpassed
by their sires of the Revolution of â76.

Thus believing, the author has yielded to the importunities of
many of the officers and men of the several commands that composed
the young âMaryland Line,â and presents to the public a
little book describing briefly its operations during those four
eventful years, and to which they can refer, and by which future
historians may be in a measure guided. That it is written by a
feeble pen, and by one unaccustomed to such work, will be seen
at a glance, and he therefore craves the indulgence of a generous
people.

It is much to be regretted that the young men who went South
did not organize themselves into
one
command; but the proper
steps were not taken in time, and consequently batteries and
companies of infantry and cavalry were assigned to other commands
whose States were accredited with their services. Nevertheless

6
Maryland had one representative, at least, in this little
organization, and for which she has no reason to blush.

The books at the War Department contained the names of over
twenty thousand Marylanders in the service, and still at no time
could the âMaryland Lineâ be increased to the proportions of a
brigade, much less a division.

One great reason for this was the fact that they were required
to officer companies, regiments, and brigades of troops from other
States, for, as a general thing, the young men from Maryland
were of a superior order intellectually, who were actuated by
patriotism alone, and not driven into the service by the conscript
officer, or influenced by mercenary motives.

Thinking to contribute to the interest of this little book, the
author has added a few incidents of a personal character, which,
with the âMaryland Line,â he hopes will be favorably received
by the Southern people, and by that portion of the people of the
North from whom we received a sympathizing tear during our
struggle for independence.

THE
FIRST MARYLAND INFANTRY.

CHAPTER I.

It was towards the close of April, 1861, that several
members of the Baltimore City Guard Battalion
(which organization had been under arms
since the memorable 19th) were sitting around the
dinner table in their armory, discussing the probability
of Baltimore soon being in the possession of
the troops under the command of the subsequently
infamous Benjamin F. Butler. Various were the
opinions expressed; but it was pretty generally
conceded that, to use Hawk-Eyeâs expression, the
city âwas circumvented,â and the Maryland Militia
had no longer any terrors for the doughty Butler
and his legions. I had long before determined upon
going South, when I could no longer serve my
native State; and such was also the determination
of most of those around me.

âThe thing is up, boys,â said Dr. Harry Scott,

8
Surgeon of the Guards, âand we now begin to
see who is who. All seemed mighty anxious for
a fight last Sunday; but, Lord, what a change has
come over the spirit of their dreams! of glory
and of conquest, now that the city is about to fall
into the hands of the enemy. And how hard
those who were most violent at first, are now
striving to prove themselves the most loyal men in
Baltimore. Then all were disloyal; now look at
the loyal! and it pains me to see many of this
very organization appear here in citizenâs dress,
as though they were frightened at what they had
done. Thereâs Fulton, of the
American
, out this
morning in an article denouncing the outrage
upon the American flag in opposing the passage
of troops through the city; and it is well
known to all that he was among the first and
most earnest advocates of the measure. For my
part, I am going South to join the Confederate
army.â

âAnd I, and I, and I,â came from a dozen
present.

âAnd
I
,â exclaimed Jim Sellman, springing to
his feet and assuming an attitude that only Jim
Sellman could assume. â
I
tell you, gentlemen,
the Federal Union must not and
shall
not be preserved,
old Hickory to the contrary, notwithstanding.
Such an outrage as this coercion has never
before been perpetrated upon a free people; no, not
since Noah drove into the ark his monkeys, dromedaries,

9
rhinoceroses, kangaroos, etc., etc. But
then the Lord told Noah to coerce the dumb brute
for the benefit of future generations; and it is the
devil who tells this government to drive us back
into the Union, for the benefit of Yankee cotton and
boot and shoe manufacturers. I tell you it shanât
be âdid;â and I say again, in the language of the
immortal Andrew Jackson, âThe Federal Union
must not and shall not be preserved at the expense
of Southern independence,â and I for one shall help
to bust her. Follow me. Iâll be your Beauregard.
Iâll lead you on to victory or to death. Keep in my
foot-prints, thatâs all.â

Twenty men volunteered upon the spot, whereupon
the inimitable Beauregard, (for so Sellman
was ever after called,) placing his dexter finger in
his mouth, and imitating the popping of a champagne
cork, circulated the ice-water freely, declaring
vehemently it was his âtreat.â

It was about the 7th of May that the party, now
increased to forty men, left Baltimore by the several
routes to Richmond. Upon reaching that city
we met quite a number of Marylanders who had
preceded us. Two companies of infantry were
quickly formed, and placed under the command of
Captains Edward R. Dorsey and J. Lyle Clark. A
third was also started, which, upon being completed,
was commanded by the gallant Capt. Wm.
H. Murray.

I will not tire the reader with a description of

10
our life at the camp of instruction, to which place
we were ordered after being mustered in; nor of
our quarters in the pig-pens, but lately occupied by
the four-legged recruits of the fair grounds; of the
countless millions of fleas that took up their quarters
in closer proximity to our flesh than was agreeable;
of the
sweats
around the race track at the
double quick; no, suffice it to say, that through the
exertions of our officers, in a very short time our
drill and discipline rivalled that of the famous Lexington
cadets, who were upon the ground, and vast
were the crowds attracted by our afternoon drills
and dress parades.

The 25th of June found the companies of Captains
Dorsey and Murray in Winchester, to complete
the organization of the First Maryland. Capt.
Clark, for some reason, preferred attaching his company
to the Twenty-First Virginia Regiment, a step
he ever after regretted, for the regiment was sent to
the wilds of West Virginia, where they saw but
little service, and were compelled to endure dreadful
sufferings and privations.

The companies of the regiment we met at Winchester
had been organized at Harperâs Ferry, where
they were for several weeks engaged in picketing
Maryland Heights and other points, and through
their exertions, in the evacuation of the place and
destruction of the rifle works, government property
of much value to us was saved that would have
been otherwise destroyed by the excited and

11
thoughtless troops, for we were yet young in the
art of war.
[1]

1
. The property referred to as having been saved by them from the
flames which were enveloping the buildings that contained it, and fired
by other troops, was seventeen thousand gun stocks, which they received
permission to send to North Carolina as a testimonial of gratitude
for all she had done for them.

For their services upon this occasion, General
Joseph E. Johnston issued the following complimentary
order:

Headquarters Winchester
, }

June 22d, 1861.       }

Special Order.

The Commanding General thanks Lt. Col. Steuart and
the Maryland Regiment for the faithful and exact manner in
which they carried out his orders of the 19th inst. at Harperâs
Ferry. He is glad to learn that, owing to their discipline, no private
property was injured and no unoffending citizen disturbed.
The soldierly qualities of the Maryland Regiment will not be forgotten
in the day of action.

By order of
Gen. Jos. E. Johnston
.

W. M. Whiting
,
Inspector General
.

The First Maryland was organized and officered
as follows: Colonel, Arnold Elzey; Lieutenant-Colonel,
George H. Steuart; Major, Bradley T.
Johnson; Acting Adjutant, Frank X. Ward.

Lieutenants, H. H. Bean, Hugh Mitchell and Eugene
Diggs.

. There were many changes in the regiment afterwards.

The regiment numbered over seven hundred men,
and was second to none in the Confederate army.
But two companies were uniformed at the time of
its organization, (those from Richmond), but soon
after, through the exertions of Mrs. Bradley T.

13
Johnson, the whole command was dressed in neat,
well-fitting gray uniforms.

With the exception of two companies, the regiment
was armed with the deadly Mississippi rifle,
which was also procured by Mrs. Johnson, through
her influence with the Governor of North Carolina,
of which State she was a native.

The organization had scarcely been effected when,
in the afternoon of the first day of July, orders
were received to cook two dayâs rations and prepare
to move at a momentâs notice. Our destination
was for some time unknown; but it was soon whispered
around that Patterson had crossed the Potomac
at Williamsport with a large army, and,
although vigorously attacked by a brigade under
General Jackson, was driving that General before
him, and advancing rapidly in the direction of
Winchester. At four oâclock, we commenced the
march to meet the enemy, every man full of confidence
and enthusiasm. As we passed the then beautiful
residence of the Hon. James M. Mason, that
venerable gentleman, with his lovely family, stood
in the gateway and bid us God speed. Alas, Yankee
vandals have been there since; and, when last
I visited the place, I found nothing but a mass of
rubbish to mark the spot where once stood the
stately mansion of one of Virginiaâs wisest and
purest statesmen.

That night the army went into camp near Bunker
Hill, some ten miles from Winchester. The

14
march was resumed early next morning, and by
twelve oâclock our line of battle was formed a short
distance beyond the little village of Darksville, and
about five miles from the advance of Pattersonâs
army. To the First Maryland was assigned the
post of honor, the extreme right; and, had there
been occasion, most stubbornly would they have
contested every inch of the ground they occupied.

The army, under the command of General Joseph
E. Johnston, numbered eleven thousand men of
all arms, indifferently armed and equipped, and
totally unacquainted with the drill and discipline
so essential to the soldier; and yet these were the
very troops that a few days later hurled back the
legions of McDowell from the plains of Manassas,
and who now threw down the gage of battle to Patterson
and his twenty-five thousand trained volunteers
from the cities of the North. The material
was there, and time was only required to make
them the invincible troops they afterwards proved
themselves on more than one hard fought battle
field.

Four days we awaited the coming of the Federal
army, although General Johnston wished to avoid
an engagement if possible. The odds were fearful,
two to one, but the troops were sanguine of success
should the enemy attack us upon ground of our
own choosing. But the enemy did not advance;
and, fearing he was too far from Manassas, where
Beauregard was daily expecting an attack from

15
McDowell, the Confederate commander determined
to fall back to Winchester, and from that place
watch the movements of Patterson.

A few days after, that General advanced his army
to Bunker Hill, and went into camp.

No change took place in the relative positions of
the two armies until the 18th day of July, when
Patterson broke camp and moved around in the
direction of Charlestown.

General Johnston was quickly informed of this
change of position by the ever vigilant Colonel J. E.
B. Stuart, in command of the cavalry; and almost at
the same hour he received a despatch from General
Beauregard announcing that the enemy had attacked
him at Bull Run in heavy force, and that he
required assistance. Orders to march were immediately
issued, and by four oâclock the last of the
troops filed through the streets of Winchester. It
was a silent march indeed. There were no bright
smiles to greet us from the fair daughters of the
town; no waving of handkerchiefs, no expression
of joy; for all believed that the Confederate army
was retreating from the superior forces of Patterson,
and that they were soon to experience the
horrors of a military despotism. And the troops
partook of the same feeling, for, as yet, our destination
had not been divulged to them. But few cheers
were heard as they moved sullenly along the quiet
streets.

We took the Millwood road, and, after marching

16
about three miles. Col. Elzey halted the regiment
and read the order to march to the assistance of
Beauregard.

âYou are, therefore,â he continued, âon the
march to meet the enemy; and, in the hour of battle,
you will remember that you are Marylanders.
Every eye from across the waters of the Potomac
which separates you from your homes is upon you,
and all those who are dear to us are watching with
anxious, beating hearts the fleshing of your maiden
sword. And they shall not be disappointed, for he
had better never been born who proves himself a
craven when we grapple with the foeman.â

A cheer that might have been heard for miles
went up from that little band of patriots; and,
with flushed cheek and flashing eyes, they asked to
be led against the enemy.

All that night we pressed forward, halting at intervals
for a few minutesâ rest; and an hour before
day we reached the Shenandoah at Berryâs Ferry,
where it was determined to halt for breakfast. At
seven oâclock we resumed our march, and, fording
the river, crossed the mountain at Ashbyâs Gap,
and took the road to Piedmont, on the line of the
Manassas Gap railroad, where we expected to find
transportation to the scene of strife. The dayâs
march was a distressing one, as the heat was intolerable;
but the gallant troops pressed rapidly forward,
stimulated by occasional reports from the
battle field.

17
During the day, General Johnston organized his
army into brigades, which, it is strange to say, had
been deferred until the very eve of battle. It was
our good fortune to be placed under the command of
General Kirby Smith, whose brigade was composed
of the First Maryland, Colonel Elzey; Thirteenth
Virginia, Col. A. P. Hill (afterwards the famous
corps commander); Tenth Virginia, Colonel Gibbons,
and Third Tennessee, Colonel Vaughn.

Piedmont was reached late that night by the rear
of the army in the midst of a terrific thunderstorm,
and, despite the pelting rain, the exhausted
troops threw themselves upon the soaking ground
and slept soundly until morning.

CHAPTER II.

The sun rose next day bright and beautiful, and,
the scene that presented itself as we responded
to reveille was animated indeed. The troops were
eagerly crowding into the cars prepared to convey
them to the battle field, and, from the boisterous
mirth to be heard on all sides, one would have supposed
them on their way to participate in some
grand holiday parade instead of scenes of death
and carnage.

Several regiments had been forwarded, and all
were impatiently awaiting their turn, when we met

18
with a disaster that threw a damper over all, and
well nigh lost us the first battle of Manassas. The
engineers of two of the trains were Yankees, who
had been in the employ of the company for a long
time. These men, true to their natural instincts
and training, treacherously concocted a plan to collide
their trains and thereby delay the troops of
Johnston so much needed by Beauregard; and totally
regardless of the consequences that might
ensue to the hundreds of brave men placed at their
mercy, consummated their wicked designs. Fortunately
but few were hurt, and none killed; but an
engine and train were destroyed, and the road so
blockaded and injured that the utmost efforts of the
large force immediately set to work failed to put it
in running order before next morning.

The loss of this train was a severe blow to us, as
we now had but two trains left. However, on the
morning of the 21st of July these two resumed
their trips, and each had made a successful run
when, in making the second, the engine of the
hindmost trainâupon which was Kirby Smithâs
brigadeâbroke down, and we were consequently
delayed until the return of the first engine, some
two hours and a half. The battle had been raging
since morning, and the whole of the army should
have reached Beauregard the evening before, whereas
barely two-thirds had joined him at the close of
the fight.

It was nearly one oâclock when we disembarked

19
at Manassas, where we found an officer of Johnstonâs
staff awaiting with an order for us to push forward
with all possible dispatch.

Hastily throwing off their knapsacks, the troops
struck across the country in the direction of the
smoke of battle and the sound of artillery, which
could now be plainly seen and heard. Not a breath
of air was stirring, and the heat and dust were almost
suffocating; but on, on we went, sometimes
slacking our pace to a walk to recover breath, but
never halting until we had made four miles and
were within a mile of the battle-field. Here we
stopped but for a minute to allow the men to fill
their canteens out of a muddy little stream, when
the march was resumed at the same rapid gait, the
gallant Smith at our head, encouraging us to
âpush on.â

As we neared the field, we knew by the rapid
discharges of artillery and the incessant rattle of
musketry, that the fight was being stubbornly contested.
We presently began to meet the wounded,
one of whom to our inquiry as to how the fight was
going, answered, âGo on, boys, go on; but Iâm
afeared youâll be too late, for Iâm thinkinâ theyâre
licken of us. But go on; thereâs no tellin.â

All told us the same, but encouraged us to press
forward, as we âmight get there in time yet.â As
we drew nearer the field, the enemy were made
aware of our approach by the clouds of dust we
raised, and several pieces of artillery were trained

20
upon us. The scene that presented itself as we
emerged from a strip of pines was frightful indeed,
and in no way calculated to encourage us to advance
farther. Wagons in great numbers were
coming to the rear at headlong speed, and demoralized
fugitives by hundreds from the battle-field were
rushing frantically by, crying out, âAll is lost, all
is lost; go back, or youâll be cut to pieces; the
army is in full retreat,â etc. And indeed so it
seemed; for presently we met a whole regiment
coming off, and, upon making inquiry for the cause,
we were coolly told that âThey had got somewhat

tangled
in the fight; and as we were whipped and
retreating, they didnât think it worth while to stay
any longer.â

But amid prospects so discouraging, the command
from our gallant general was ever âForward,
forward, my brave men! pay no attention to those
miserable cowards and skulkers.â

The First Maryland had the right of the line, at
the head of which was riding General Kirby Smith.
We were still marching by the flank, when, just
as the column entered a strip of woods, it was fired
upon by about a dozen of the 14th Brooklyn
Zouaves; and the general fell from his horse shot
through the neck, and it was feared at the time
fatally wounded. Corporal John Berryman, of
Company C, First Maryland, fell at the fire also,
with a dreadful wound through the groin. The
regiment, as did the brigade, formed line of battle

21
instinctively, and, not knowing what might be the
enemyâs force, prepared for an attack.

The command now devolved upon Colonel Elzey,
the senior officer, who, after waiting some minutes,
and the enemy not appearing, moved the brigade
obliquely through the woods to the left and front,
and as we approached its edge the Federal line of
battle appeared in view, which, as they perceived
us, poured into our ranks a terrific volley of musketry,
that took effect upon several of the men of
the brigade. Private John Swisher, of Company
A, First Maryland, fell from a musket ball in the
head, and died soon after, being the first man from
Maryland killed in actual battle.

Colonel Elzey immediately prepared to attack.
Holding the Thirteenth Virginia in reserve, he
formed the First Maryland, Tenth Virginia, and
Third Tennessee, and under cover of a hot fire from
the Newtown battery of light artillery, ordered a
âcharge!â

The enemy held a strong position on a ridge difficult
of ascent, and immediately in front of a dense
pine thicket. At least three hundred yards separated
us, and the charge was to be across a wheatfield,
and of course without shelter of any description.
It was a desperate undertaking; but upon
that charge rested the fate of the Confederate army.
At the command, with one wild, deafening-yell, the
Confederates emerged from the woods, and, amidst
a perfect storm of bullets, the gallant fellows rushed

22
across the field. But they never wavered nor hesitated,
and, dashing up the acclivity, drove the
enemy pell-mell from their strong position into the
thicket in their rear.

Halting the column for a minute to reform, Elzey
pressed on in pursuit; and, when we came once
more into the open country, we saw before us, and
for a mile down to our right, no organized force,
but one dense mass of fugitives. With the successful
charge of Elzey upon their right flank, the
whole of the Federal army had given way, and was
rushing madly in the direction of Washington.
Nothing that I ever saw afterwards could compare
with that panic; and, as we pressed on in pursuit,
men surrendered themselves by hundreds.

It was whilst thus pursuing the enemy that President
Davis and Generals Johnston and Beauregard
rode up to Colonel Elzey, amid the joyful shouts of
the men, and the former, with countenance beaming
with excitement and enthusiasm, seizing him by
the hand, and giving it a hearty shake, exclaimed:
â
General
Elzey, you are the Blucher of the day.â

Inclining to the right, the command halted for a
few minutes near the Henry House, and close by
the famous Rickettâs battery, which had been captured
by the Eighth Georgia infantry, after a most
desperate struggle. The ground was thickly strewn
with the dead and wounded of the Seventy-Ninth
New York Highlanders, which gallant regiment
had supported the battery. The wounded were suffering

23
terribly for water; and our men spent every
moment in attending to their wants.

A little incident occurred here which I shall relate.
Among the fatally wounded was an officer
who, from his uniform, we knew to be a captain.
The poor fellow had been shot through the head,
and was about to breathe his last. Thinking to
relieve him, Captain (afterwards Colonel) Herbert
unbuttoned his coat, when he discovered a pocket-book
and a package of letters in one of the pockets.
Taking possession of them, he attended the wounded
officer until he died. Upon examining the pocket-book,
he found it contained some sixty-five or
seventy dollars in gold; the letters were from his
wife, and proved his name to be Brown. Two years
after Captain Herbert was wounded and taken prisoner
upon the field of Gettysburg. He had never
parted with the gold nor the letters, and when sufficiently
recovered from his wounds, he caused to
be inserted in the New York
Herald
an advertisement
calling upon the widow of the deceased officer
to come forward and claim the property. In due
time she made her appearance, a charming Scotch
woman, not, as she said for the sake of claiming
the money, but to hear from his own lips all about
the last moments of her husband. She had received
an imperfect account of his being shot from some of
his men, but wished to learn of his death. Never
shall I forget the look of gratitude she gave the
Captain when he finished his story, (for the author

24
was present at the interview,) and seizing his feeble
hand, while great tears stole down her beautiful
cheeks, she heaped upon him a thousand blessings.

She was our constant attendant for a week afterwards,
and when she left us, seemed much affected.
We subsequently learned from her that a valuable
and highly-prized watch that her husband had on
his person when shot, had been recovered with
much difficulty, one of his own men having appropriated
it after his Captainâs fall.

Resuming our march, the column crossed the
Stone Bridge, and took the turnpike leading to
Alexandria, confident that we were to pursue the
enemy to the very gates of his capital. But we
were doomed to a bitter disappointment; for, after
marching a mile or two, we came to a right-about,
and silently retraced our steps to Manassas. Tired,
hungry and dispirited, we reached our camping
ground long after nightfall, and, despite a drenching
rain that set in about 12 oâclock, enjoyed a
refreshing sleep.

CHAPTER III.

The morning after the battle of Manassas all
seemed chaos, or confusion worse confounded.
The cold, disagreeable rain that had set in during
the night still continued, and the troops were provided

25
with no means to shelter themselves from the
pitiless storm which raged; and to add to this discomfort,
the commissary wagons could not be found,
and the men were almost entirely without provisions.
Staff officers were galloping in every direction,
looking for regiments that had been lost on
the march of the night before, and it seemed for a
while as though the utmost efforts of the general
officers and their assistants would never be able to
restore order out of all this muddle.

All day long this state of affairs continued. We
had gained a great battle, it was true, and had we
continued the pursuit, the command would have
remained intact to a great degree; but the demoralizing
effects of countermarching an army in the
moment of victory were here strongly evidenced.
The impression had gained ground that an opportunity
had been let slip to deal the enemy a fatal blow,
and therefore dissatisfaction was expressed on every
side, and more than once I heard it said that âif
we had not intended following up what successes
we might meet with, there was but little gained in
fighting the battle.â

Towards evening something like order seemed
restored, and we waited in momentary expectation
of hearing the command âForward.â But night
came on, and we were still idly facing the pelting
rain. Shivering, shaking, and wretched, the troops
threw themselves upon the wet ground to await the
morrow.

26
At midnight we were aroused by the rattle of the
kettle-drum calling us to arms, and never did men
more readily respond to the summons. An order
had been received for the First Maryland and the
Third Tennessee to accompany Colonel J. E. B.
Stuart, with cavalry and artillery, to Fairfax Court
House.

The night was intensely dark, and our progress
was, therefore, necessarily slow. For hours we
toiled through the deep mud, stumbling and falling
over rocks, stumps and logs, and mistaking our way
every mile, when at daylight we struck the turnpike
leading to Alexandria, and but six miles from where
we had started.

The rain had now ceased, the clouds grew lighter
and lighter, and presently the wind springing up,
they were sent fleeting, and dancing, and skipping
across heavenâs blue face, to be seen no more, we
trusted, for many days to come. Never before had
the glorious sun been more heartily welcomed by
suffering humanity than it was that morning as it
rose with silent majesty in the eastern sky. Never
before had it appeared so lovely, never risen with
such stately grandeur; and, as we gazed in its full,
bright face, and began to feel its warm breath envelop
us, we forgot all the sufferings and privations
of the past thirty-six hours, and were made as happy
as we had just before been miserable.

Evidences of the enemyâs rapid retreat now appeared
on every side. The first thing which we

27
encountered was an abandoned wagon, ladened with
army bread. Nothing could have been more acceptable,
and the troops were bountifully supplied. A
little farther a large camp was found, filled with
everything conceivable that could contribute to the
comfort and efficiency of an army. As we progressed,
wagons in great numbers presented themselves,
containing army stores, ammunition, arms,
etc., while camp kettles, muskets, cartridge boxes,
belts, breast-plates, etc., lined the road for miles.
Broken-down buggies that had, no doubt, been
abandoned by the valiant Yankee members of Congress
who had started with the army, bound for
Richmond, put in an occasional appearance. At one
place a human arm was found that had, no doubt,
been amputated in the ambulance which was conveying
the sufferer to the rear in the general flight.
It evidently had belonged to an officer, for it was
of delicate mould and fair as womanâs, and on the
little finger was an exquisitely-wrought ring, containing
a brilliant and valuable diamond set.

We reached Fairfax Court House by 12 oâclock,
where we also found an immense quantity of stores,
especially of clothing, which at that time was much
needed by the Confederate Government. Nothing
could exceed the joy of the inhabitants at once
more beholding the gray they loved so well; but
more than once they expressed their regret that we
had not arrived some hours earlier; âfor,â said
one of them, âfour thousand Yankees left here but

28
this morning, who would have surrendered to a
corporalâs guard, and those in advance of them
were, if possible, in a worse plight, utterly demoralized,
and without the semblance of organization.â

A half mile beyond the village the command
went into camp in a woods by the side of the turnpike,
there to await orders from General Johnston,
whom we supposed moving with the whole army
upon Washington, and but a short distance in our
rear.

Reclining upon a bundle of straw, resting my
tired, aching limbs, I was joined by my first Lieutenant,
Shellman, who, with face radiant with joy,
informed me that he had just heard the Colonel
commanding express his belief that we would surely
be in front of Washington before thirty-six hours.
With all my heart did I hope it might prove true;
but I had my doubts. I did not like the confusion
we had witnessed, and feared it would require some
days to reorganize the army, and place it in a condition
to assume the offensive. That it was possible
to yet retrieve the great error committed on the
21st and 22d, I was inclined to believe; but that it
would be done was another question; and an observation
from a private soldier suggested itself to me
more than once. It was made while we were retracing
our steps to Manassas after the battle, when all
were out of humor. âA President and two Generals,â
said he, âare too many to command one
army.â And subsequent events proved how correct
it was.

29
As day after day passed by, and there appeared
no indications of offensive operations being resumed,
our hopes of a speedy peace vanished, and
we saw nothing before us but a protracted and
bloody struggle.

Rapidly the enemy reorganized and reinforced
his broken and discomfited army; and in an incredibly
short time the genius of McClellan had
placed around Washington an army and fortifications
that it would have been madness for the Confederate
Generals to attack.

It was determined, however, to present to them a
bold front to conceal as much as possible our own
numerical inferiority, and, therefore, the Confederates
were advanced until they held possession of
Masonâs Hill, but five miles from Alexandria.
Munsonâs Hill was soon after taken also, after a
slight resistance; and the Southern army was
thereby placed still nearer to the National Capital.

The infantry, under the command of Colonel J. E.
B. Stuart, remained some weeks at Fairfax, when it
was ordered to Fairfax Station, on the line of the
Orange and Alexandria railroad, there to reunite
with the balance of the brigade, now commanded
by General Elzey. Here we set ourselves down for
a long stay, as everything indicated that hostilities
would not be renewed until spring, for both governments
seemed to have set to work preparing their
respective armies for the desperate fighting to be
then begun.

30
Strict and rigid discipline was sought to be enforced
throughout the Confederate army; and it
was then we saw the incompetency of many of our
officers, and had forebodings of the disastrous
results likely to accrue from the wretched system
adopted by the government of electing officers to
companies instead of their being appointed by the
Executive after a searching examination by an experienced
and competent soldier.

In a measure, the First Maryland Regiment was
free from this evil, which was owing principally to
the determined steps taken by Colonel Geo. H.
Steuart, who had succeeded Colonel Elzey in its
command. An old and experienced soldier himself,
he soon saw who was competent and who was
not. Some of the latter he disposed of in a summary
manner, and with others he thought to bide
his time. He enforced discipline to the strictest
letter of the old army regulations, which, though
at first very objectionable to both officers and men
of his command, afterwards became popular as the
good resulting therefrom developed itself.

Drill by companies was had in the morning of
every favorable day, and drill in the afternoon by
battalion, with dress parade in the evening. Both
officers and men were required to pay the strictest
attention to their clothing and person, and the
slightest neglect of either would draw from him a
rebuke or punishment. The most rigid sanitary
regulations were adopted for the camp; and when

31
the neat appearance and healthy condition of the
men were contrasted with that of other regiments
around us, the most indifferent were stimulated to
exert themselves to their utmost in sustaining the
commandant in his efforts to promote the health
and comfort of those placed under his charge; and,
therefore, from its being at first one of the most
obnoxious duties which the soldier had to perform,
it became one of the most pleasant.

That Colonel Steuart was popular with the regiment
upon assuming command, I cannot say. In
fact, I believe he was much disliked; but in less
than two months he had won the love and affection
of all. Where was there such a camp as that of
the First Maryland? Where such drill and discipline;
such healthy, rugged looking troops; such
neat and soldierly fellows? Where was the regiment
that could follow them on a long, weary
march with that rapid, elastic step for which they
were so famous? Nowhere in the Confederacy.
Ever vigilant, ever watchful, ever cheerful in the
discharge of their duties, they were the pride and
boast of the army.

With his officers, Colonel Steuart was strict and
exacting, but always kind and courteous. He established
a school for their instruction in tactics, and
daily they were assembled at his headquarters for
recitation; and not for his commission would one
of them have appeared before him unable to recite
the lessons he had been instructed to get. As a

32
body, they were as intelligent a set of men as could
be found in the army. I am compelled to say, however,
that there were one or two disgraceful exceptions
in the number.

One of these, in particular, was a Captain Edelin,

alias
Lum Cooper, who had by some means been
elected to the command of a fine company, composed
principally of young men from Baltimore. Without
even the rudiments of a common school education,
holding the truth in utter contempt, and a low swaggerer,
he had nothing to recommend him but his
having lighted the lamps in the streets of Washington
for years, and beat a drum in the war with Mexico.
His conduct everywhere in the army was disgraceful
in the extreme, and reflected discredit, not
only upon the regiment to which he belonged, but
upon the State, of which he was neither a native nor
a resident. Finally, despised and avoided by all
who, without knowing the man, had associated with
him in the regiment, he ran the blockade, took the
oath of allegiance to the Federal Government, and
turned informer upon the Government of which he
had been a sworn servant.

CHAPTER IV.

The fall of 1861 will ever be remembered by the
survivors of the regiment, as the most pleasant
experienced by them during the whole war. We

33
had an abundance of clothing and wholesome food,
whilst there was no scarcity of money with which
to indulge in even some of the luxuries of life.
And then the monotony of the camp was often
changed to the excitement of picketing in front of
the enemy on Masonâs and Munsonâs Hills, in the
capture of both of which the First Maryland bore
a conspicuous part. In the engagement at the latter
place, we lost a private of Company I killed,
and Lieutenant Mitchell, of the same company,
badly wounded. During these picket reliefs, we
had daily encounters with the enemy, in which we
invariably got the better of him. The first that
occurred I will relate, as Mr. Captain Edelin then
and there gave us a specimen of military skill acquired
on the head of a kettle-drum in Mexico.

It was on the morning after the capture of Masonâs
Hill, that Colonel Smith, the officer in command,
wishing to advance his pickets as far as
Clampittâs house, a mile in front of the main body,
detailed Edelin for the duty. He moved his company
forward through a thicket, and in a few
minutes we were startled by the rapid discharges of
musketry, which led Colonel Smith to believe he
had encountered a heavy force of the enemy. Captain
James R. Herbertâs company and my own were
immediately sent to his support. Coming up with
Edelin, he informed us that he had met a regiment
of infantry, but, after a stubborn fight, the enemy
had retreated, carrying his dead and wounded
along.

34
âBut,â said he, âthey are in the woods before
us, and I must have artillery to drive them out;â
and, turning to an orderly, he directed him to post
off to Colonel Smith and request that officer to send
him a battery forthwith.

I saw an expression of ineffable contempt and
disgust spread over the face of Lieutenant Costello,
of his company, who, calling me aside, informed
me that the sight of but one picket had occasioned
all the firing, and that by the Captainâs orders.

The courier dispatched to the commandant soon
returned with the not very polite reply that âCaptain
Edelin was a dâd fool, and he wanted no
more such crazy requests.â

âPuss in Boots,â as he was usually called, dropped
his feathers instanter, but was heard to mutter
something about âchallenge,â âduel.â Being the
senior officer, he had command of the three companiesâsomething
which neither Herbert nor myself
relished in the least; and we, therefore, requested
to be returned, as there was not the least likelihood
of the enemy appearing in any force. Herbertâs
request was granted; but I was ordered to remain
where I was.

A short time after two Yankee soldiers accidentally
wandered into our lines and were captured.
Here was a chance for our hero to win back the
good opinion of the Colonel; so, mounting a great
tall horse, (he was a very little man) he, in a
pompous and important manner, marched the poor,

35
half-frightened wretches into the presence of Col.
Smith, to whom he told a wonderful story of the
skill and strategy he had displayed in their capture.

Being in command during his absence, and not
feeling altogether satisfied with the position we
held, I concluded to make a reconnoissance. Lieutenants
Shearer and Costello were therefore detailed,
and, with a squad of men, directed to move
forward until they encountered the enemyâs pickets.
In a few minutes the crack of several rifles told
me they had found them. Fearing the party had
perhaps fallen in with a superior force, I advanced
with a few men to render assistance if required.
Upon reaching them, however, I found it was but a
single picket they had stumbled upon, who was
shot and killed in attempting to escape.

Edelin had heard the firing, and came down the
road at full speed, but, halting his horse at a safe
distance, bawled out:

âCome back, come back; youâll all git killed.â

Withdrawing my men, I rejoined the main body,
where I was saluted with,

âCapting, how dare you do anythink of this kind
without my orders?â

I explained to him that my purpose was to find
a safer place in which to post the men, and suggested
that we should move the whole command
back to where I had just left.

âI shall do no sich thing,â he answered. âYou

36
never fit in Mexico, and, therefore, what in the
devil do you know about
plannin a military battle
.â

Late in the fall the enemy in our front grew
restless; and Generals Johnston and Beauregard
thought it expedient to withdraw from Munsonâs
and Masonâs, and concentrate the whole army on
the heights of Centreville, as everything indicated
an advance of the immense army assembled around
Washington. Therefore leaving at Munsonâs a
small party, with an old stove pipe mounted on
cart wheels, to annoy the Federal advance, we took
a last look into the streets of Alexandria, and at
the detested Federal Capitol, and marched to our
new quarters at Centreville.

It was with regret we left our old camp at Fairfax
Station, around which lingered so many pleasant
associations of the past; and our last reveille
seemed to make sad the hearts of all; and the summons
to fall in was not as promptly responded to as
on former occasions. Never again were the hearty,
joyous shouts of the Maryland boys to be heard
through its now deserted streets, nor the heavy
tramp and the sharp command, as the battalion
performed, to astonished, gaping thousands, those
intricate evolutions inimitable. No, nor the unhappy
sentinel to be frightened to death by the
fearful shriek of âIndians got you! Indians got
you!â when it turned out only to be our good
Colonel making his
periodical
grand rounds. And
never more was the gallant Elzey to display his

37
superb horsemanship to the fair daughters of Baltimore
on a visit to the camp, but which performance,
much to their disappointment and regret, was
brought to an abrupt termination by the breaking
of a stirrup strap. No, never, never! all is past
and gone forever! Even the old guard house and
the Colonelâs pen, that had ever and for so long
extended to the refractory ones a hearty welcome
and tender, affectionate embrace, were bid a sad, sad
farewell.

Centreville, when we reached it, presented a scene
of bustle and confusion. Troops were arriving in
large numbers, and were striving to reach the
grounds selected for the respective regiments and
brigades all over the same road. At last, tired and
hungry, the brigade of Elzey halted upon the very
summit of one of the highest hills around the
place.

The sight that presented itself from this point
that night was one of the grandest I ever witnessed.
Before us, as far as the eye could reach, flashed
thousands upon thousands of camp fires; and spell-bound
we gazed upon this grand pyrotechnic display
for hours. And then the next day, and for
days after, the evolutions of forty thousand troops
of all arms in the plain below us, was a scene indescribably
grand.

38

CHAPTER V.

The intelligence we received from Washington
now grew every day more threatening. That
McClellan, with his immense and splendidly appointed
army, intended to advance upon Centreville
there seemed no doubt; but whether Johnston
intended to fight was by us much questioned. We
were in no way prepared to meet the enemy. The
army was not organized, and but imperfectly equipped.
Sickness prevailed in our camp to an alarming
extent; and the utmost efforts of our able commander
had failed to increase his force a single
man. Time must, therefore, be gained. But how?
Johnston was the man for the emergency. We
must present a bold and defiant front to the
enemy.

Heavy details from the various regiments were,
therefore, at once made to erect fortifications.
Steadily the work progressed, and in a short time
the heights of Centreville were crowned with what
seemed at a distance most formidable works. Of
siege guns we did not have one; but immense
blackened logs answered the same purpose, and
frowned most threateningly from many an embrasure.
None but those immediately in charge were
allowed to approach them; for it was well known
our camp was swarming with spies. These preparations
had the desired effect; and McClellan, believing

39
the position to be impregnable, quietly settled
himself down to await the coming of spring.

I will not tire the reader with details of the same
every-day dull and monotonous camp-life at Centreville,
but shall, as rapidly as possible, hasten on to
the more exciting and interesting scenes and incidents
in which the regiment participated. Suffice
it to say, we remained there until late in November,
when the brigade was ordered back to Manassas,
there to prepare their winter quarters.

The spot selected by the Colonel on which to build
our cabins was in the midst of a dense pine woods,
and much sheltered from the cold blasts of winter,
and where was also wood and water in abundance.
By the last of December, in this heretofore lonely
and deserted forest, had been reared a neat and
substantial village, in which we hoped to remain
undisturbed until the spring should have set in,
and from whence we would once more go forth to
measure our strength with the hosts that had just
threatened us with annihilation.

During the months of December and January,
with the exception of a little disagreeable picket
duty along the line of the Orange and Alexandria
railroad, and the surprise of a picket post at Sangsterâs
Station, nothing occurred to disturb the quiet
of our winter quarters. The picket alluded to was
commanded by Lieut. Richard Hough, of Company
F, and in the fight which ensued, Sergeant Sheehan
was badly wounded, and Lieut. Joseph Stewart and

40
ten or twelve men captured. The Federal loss was
a lieutenant killed.

The term of enlistment of the twelve monthsâ men
was now rapidly drawing to a close, and to have an
efficient army in the field when the spring campaign
should open, it became necessary for the Confederate
Government to take some steps to that end. An
order was therefore issued some time in January,
granting to all twelve monthsâ men who would re-enlist
for the war, furloughs of from thirty to sixty
days. The majority did so, and for the first time
since entering the army, went home to see their
families and friends.

The unwise policy of the government in having
enlisted men for a less time than the war here proved
itself, and for a long while after occasioned much
trouble and caused much demoralization in the
army of General Johnston, for bitterly did those
who were compelled to remain in camp by reason
of their having enlisted for the war, complain of the
injustice they believed had been done them. Particularly
was this the case in the First Maryland,
which contained several twelve monthsâ companies,
two of which, Companies A and B, had re-enlisted
almost to a man, and gone off on furlough; the
others, Companies C, H and I, preferring to remain
in the field until their time was up, when many of
them proposed to go into the cavalry and artillery,
they having a dislike for the infantry arm of the
service. However, the war men became reconciled

41
in a measure, and it was hoped nothing more would
be heard of the matter; but in this we were mistaken,
as will be seen hereafter.

The Confederate army was now, owing to the depletion
of regiments and brigades by furloughs,
reduced to about twenty thousand men, whilst not
an organized brigade could be found in the whole
command. Of this condition of things the Federal
authorities were soon apprised, and therefore, in the
early part of March, 1862, an advance upon Manassas
by the whole army under McClellan was
determined upon. Having no facilities for the
transportation of the immense quantities of stores
gathered there, and unable to resist the overwhelming
force of McClellan, there was no alternative left
Johnston but to destroy his supplies and withdraw
the army to the south bank of the Rappahannock.
It was a sad necessity, and as the troops were guided
on their way for many weary miles by the lurid
flames from their burning buildings that seemed to
lick the very heavens, all felt that the first battle
of the war had proved more disastrous as a victory
than would have been a defeat. There was no pretension
to organization, and what had been but a
few months before an organized and victorious
army, now presented the appearance of an ungovernable
mob, and entirely at the mercy of the
enemy, should he have the enterprise and energy to
pursue it.

Fortunately, however, McClellan contented himself

42
with occupying our deserted quarters at Manassas,
thereby enabling us to reassemble and
reorganize in a manner our demoralized and straggling
troops upon the Rappahannock. Therefore,
when soon after that General retraced his steps and
prepared to move around to Yorktown, from whence
he had determined to advance upon Richmond,
Johnston had under his command quite a respectable
army with which to reinforce the little band of
heroes under Magruder, showing so bold a front to
the hosts of the Federal General. But it was also
necessary to leave troops behind to watch the movements
of McDowell, who still remained at Manassas
with a large army, and to this duty the division of
Ewell was assigned. It was, perhaps at that time,
the finest and best organized division in the army,
and was comprised of Elzeyâs, Trimbleâs and Dick
Taylorâs brigades, with artillery and cavalry.

From the opposite banks of the river the two
commands narrowly watched each other, and exchanged
an occasional shot until the evening of the
19th of April, when orders to âpack upâ were
given, and in the midst of a drenching rain, we
took up our line of march for Gordonsville along
the Orange and Alexandria railroad.âFor three
days the cold, chilly rain continued, and for three
days the troops, destitute of provisions, toiled over
the uneven surface of the railroadâs bed before the
command reached its destination, cold, hungry and
dispirited.

43
We were allowed to remain here several days to
rest and recruit, when one bright, beautiful day,
orders were received by General Ewell for his command
to cross the Blue Ridge and join Jackson,
who was then encamped at Swift Run Gap. Nothing
could have exceeded the joy of the troops at
this unexpected order, for we had supposed ourselves
destined to reinforce the army of Johnston in
the swamps of the Chickahominy. To be with
Jackson, then, the great and glorious Jackson, in
the beautiful Valley of Virginia, was a pleasure
unexpected, and it was, therefore, with light hearts
and elastic step that we left our camp at Gordonsville.
The march was made by easy stages, and in
a few days, about nine oâclock in the evening, from
the mountainâs summit, his camp-fires were descried
away down in the plain below us. No more stupid
hours in camp, if you please. We now belong to
Jacksonâs army, and if laurels were to be won, we
felt that they would surely be ours. Already
visions of shattered and beaten armies, of prisoners
innumerable, of captured camps filled with the
good things with which we had been for so long unacquainted,
flitted before us, and thus thinking, and
thus trusting, we descended the mountain sides and
threaded our way through the camps of the heroes
of Kearnstown, and went into
bivouac
a short distance
beyond, at Conradâs store.

At the first sound of the reveille next morning,
every man sprang nimbly to his feet. They wanted

44
to see Jackson, to talk with his troops over the
great battle they had so recently fought, and more
than all, to discuss the prospects before us, and, if
possible, ascertain our destination; but, to our
utter amazement, when we turned our faces to where
we had passed his army the evening previous, nothing
met our gaze but the smouldering embers of his
deserted camp-fires. We rubbed our eyes and looked
again and again, loth to believe our sense of vision.
But gone he was, and whither and for what no one
could tell. Quietly, in the dead of night, he had
arisen from his blanket, and calling his troops
around him, with them had disappeared.

For more than two weeks his whereabouts remained
a mystery, and various were the conjectures
as to what had become of him, when one day there
came the news of Milroyâs defeat at McDowell,
more than one hundred miles away. Swiftly he
had traversed the steep ranges of mountains that
separated him from his prey, and with irresistible
fury had hurled his legions upon the astonished
foe in his mountain fastness and routed him with
heavy loss, and was even now on his return, and
within two daysâ march of us. General Ewell was
ordered to join him at once near Luray, and on the
16th of May we encamped at Columbia Bridge on
our way thither.

It was the next day that the term of enlistment
of Company C, First Maryland, expired, and the
men clamored for an immediate discharge, which,

45
under the circumstances, was reluctantly given by
Colonel Bradley T. Johnson, who had succeeded to
the command by the promotion of Colonel Steuart
to the rank of brigadier general, and ordered to organize
the Maryland Line. And here again the
discontent that had prevailed at Manassas among
the men enlisted for the war broke out afresh.
They declared they had enlisted for twelve months
only, and that if the muster rolls had it otherwise
they had been grossly deceived by their officers.
The dissatisfaction grew more apparent every hour,
and when, on the 18th day of May, we marched to
join General Jackson, the men were almost in a
state of mutiny.

It was on the banks of the Shenandoah, the 21st
of May, that we first caught sight of the glorious
soldier as he dashed along the lines with hat off,
and bowing right and left in acknowledgment of
the vociferous cheers that went up from his enthusiastic
army.

Our camp that night was within a mile of Luray,
and here we were destined to part with the gallant
Elzey, who had so long commanded us, and who
had led us to our first victory. As I have said,
Colonel Steuart had been promoted and ordered to
organize and command the Maryland Line, of which
the First Maryland and Baltimore Light Artillery
were to form the nucleus. For the present, however,
Colonel Johnson was in command, as General
Steuart had been temporarily assigned to a

46
brigade of cavalry. Never shall I forget General
Elzeyâs emotion as he drew the regiment up in
line for the last time, and with tears rolling down
his war-worn cheeks, thanked them for the honor
they had helped to confer upon him at Manassas.

CHAPTER VI.

On the evening of the 22d, the army, about twelve
thousand strong, went into camp within an easy
dayâs march of Front Royal, where, rumor had it,
was stationed a considerable force of the enemy.
Here the dissatisfaction that had so long existed in
the First Maryland broke out into open mutiny,
and the majority of the men in the war companies
threw down their arms and demanded an immediate
discharge. It was in vain that General Steuart and
Colonel Johnson expostulated with them upon their
disgraceful conduct, but they declared they had
served out their term of enlistment, and would
serve no longer, and when next morning we resumed
our march, nearly one-half the regiment was
disarmed and under guard. The affair was kept
concealed from General Jackson, as it was still
hoped the men would return to reason, for it was
not calculated to impress him very favorably with
the troops from whom he expected so much.

Brig. Gen. GEO. H. STEUART.

47
A halt was made about five miles from Front
Royal, and whilst resting ourselves by the wayside,
an aid-de-camp was observed to dash up to Colonel
Johnson and hand him a dispatch. It took him
but an instant to acquaint himself with its contents,
when, turning to his command, in a voice tremulous
with suppressed anger and with a face flushed
with mortification and shame, called it to âattention.â

âI have just received an order from General
Jackson that very nearly concerns yourselves,â he
said, âand I will read it to you:â

âColonel Johnson will move the First Maryland to the front
with all dispatch, and in conjunction with Wheatâs battalion attack
the enemy at Front Royal. The army will halt until you
pass.

Jackson.
â

âYou have heard the order, and I must confess
are in a pretty condition to obey it. I will have to
return it with the endorsement upon the back that
âthe First Maryland refuses to meet the enemy,
though ordered by General Jackson.â Before this
day I was proud to call myself a Marylander, but
now, God knows, I would rather be known as anything
else. Shame on you to bring this stigma
upon the fair fame of your native Stateâto cause
the finger of scorn to be pointed at those who confided
to your keeping their most sacred trustâtheir
honor and that of the glorious old State. Marylanders
you call yourselves. Profane not that hallowed

48
name again, for it is not yours. What Marylander
ever before threw down his arms and deserted
his colors in the presence of the enemy, and those
arms, and those colors, too, placed in your hands
by a woman? Never before has one single blot defaced
her honored history. Could it be possible to
conceive a crime more atrocious, an outrage more
damnable? Go home and publish to the world
your infamy. Boast of it when you meet your
fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and sweethearts.
Tell them it was you who, when brought
face to face with the enemy, proved yourselves recreants,
and acknowledged yourselves to be cowards.
Tell them this, and see if you are not spurned from
their presence like some loathsome leper, and despised,
detested, nay, abhorred by those whose confidence
you have so shamefully betrayed; you will
wander over the face of the earth with the brand of
âcoward,â âtraitor,â indelibly imprinted upon your
foreheads, and in the end sink into a dishonored
grave, unwept for, uncared for, leaving behind as a
heritage to your posterity the scorn and contempt of
every honest man and virtuous woman in the land.â

The Colonelâs address, of which I have given the
reader but a faint idea, was delivered with much
feeling and listened to with close attention, and
scarcely had he concluded when a wild yell broke
the painful stillness that had prevailed, and a
simultaneous rush was made for the ordnance wagon
by those to whom he had just administered so

49
scathing a rebuke. Never before, perhaps, had they
seized their arms with such avidity, or buckled on
their equipments with greater rapidity.

âNow, sir,â they cried out, âlead us against the
enemy, and we will prove to you that we are not
cowards, and that neither have we forgotten these
arms were placed in our hands by a woman.â

âForward!â was the command, and at the
double-quick the regiment passed along the whole
army amid the most deafening cheers. âWe are
going to have some work cut out now, boys, for the
Marylanders are going to the front,â could be heard
on all sides as we moved along, and every man inwardly
determined that work
should
be cut out if
material could be found.

On the right of the army we joined Wheat with
his battalion of Louisianians, and with them moved
swiftly upon the doomed Federals holding Front
Royal. We approached within a mile of the town,
but saw no signs of the enemy. âAnother disappointment,â
ran down the line, but the next moment
two or three frightened soldiers in blue broke
cover from a picket post, and fled in the direction
of the village. They were pursued by several
mounted men, and speedily overtaken and brought
back. Upon being questioned, they told us that
they belonged to the First Maryland, and that the
force in town consisted of that regiment, two companies
of Pennsylvanians, two pieces of artillery,
and a squadron of cavalry, the latter having joined

50
them that very day, all under the command of Colonel
John R. Kenly, who did not dream that Jackson
was within fifty miles of him. So at last we had
met the much boasted Yankee First Maryland, and
although greatly outnumbered, we were ready to
take up the gage of battle so defiantly thrown down
to us some time before. First Maryland against
First Maryland! It was, indeed, a singular coincidence.

We approached the town rapidly, and entered the
main street before the enemy were aware of our approach.
For a minute they resisted our advance,
and a sharp exchange of musketry shots ensued.
They were quickly driven out, however, with the
loss of several in killed, wounded and prisoners.

The whole command had now taken the alarm,
and assembled behind their artillery, which was
posted on a hill that commanded the town and its
approaches. Dashing through the streets, we were
soon in the open country, when the companies commanded
by Captains Nicholas, Herbert and Goldsborough
were deployed as skirmishers, with Wheat
on the left, the whole being under the command of
Lieutenant Colonel E. R. Dorsey (who had reached
that rank by reason of seniority upon the promotion
of Elzey and Steuart), whilst Colonel Johnson commanded
the reserves.

The enemy now opened his artillery with great
precision, and his shell began to tell in our ranks.
Nothing daunted, however, the gallant fellows

51
moved steadily forward, and reached the very foot
of the hill upon which he was posted. From there
the fight was stubbornly waged for at least two
hours, with no apparent advantage on either side.
In the meantime the troops of Jackson were moving
to the right and left to envelop the enemy and cut
off his retreat. Kenly saw the movement, and determined
to withdraw his forces and cross the river
(immediately in his rear) if possible. On his right
was the turnpike bridge, and on his left, in our
front, was the long and high trestle-work of the
Manassas Gap Railroad. Dorsey divined his purpose,
and, as the enemy commenced to fall back,
immediately ordered a charge along the whole line.
With a yell the men responded to the command,
and the long line of skirmishers pressed forward in
pursuit. The fight would have terminated then
and there had not the Louisiana battalion stumbled
upon the enemyâs camp, and bent on plunder, the
threats and entreaties of their officers were for some
time in vain, and when they were at length prevailed
upon to move forward, it was found the enemy in
their front, with artillery and cavalry, had escaped
over the bridge. Not so in front of the Maryland
command. The enemy were closely pressed to the
riverâs bank, where, finding it impossible to escape
across the trestle-work, they threw down their arms
in a body. By this time a heavy force of cavalry
had forded the river some distance below, and charging
the remainder of Kenlyâs command, which was

52
rapidly retreating up the turnpike, captured it
almost to a man, not, however, without meeting
with a desperate resistance, in which many were
killed and wounded on both sides.

Thus ended the battle of Front Royal, if it can
be so termed, and in which Marylander met Marylander
for the first time in the war. It has been
said Kenlyâs command had fought a vastly superior
force of the Confederates, whereas it was a
much inferior one, which, however did not compel
him to withdraw from the position he had taken
in front of the town, but the flank movement by
heavy bodies of our troops did, and it was then
we pressed our advantage. The actual number of
assailants prior to his recrossing the river with what
remained of his command, did not exceed four hundred
men. And it has been more than once asserted,
also, that Colonel Kenly did not offer the
spirited resistance to the Confederate advance expected
of him, and that there was no reason why he
should have lost his command. This is doing him
injustice. He fought his troops like the brave man
that he is, and Commissary Banks can thank him
for being instrumental in saving the little he did
from the wreck of his army at Strasburg and Winchester.
He committed one great, inexcusable
error, however, in not having his cavalry scouts and
pickets out, but it is said they reached him but an
hour or two before our attack, although he had
called for them several days before. If this be true,

53
he deserves no blame or censure for his misfortune
at Front Royal.

The morning after the fight, when the prisoners
were drawn up in line, it was truly amusing to see
the men of the two Maryland regiments greet each
other. âWhy, if there ainât my brother Bill;â
âAnd thereâs my cousin Jim,â could be heard,
whilst nearly all recognized old friends and acquaintances,
whom they greeted cordially, and divided
with them the rations which had just changed hands.

The kindest attention was shown the wounded
officers and men, the former being paroled, and
allowed to accept the invitation of the citizens to
accompany them to their homes, where they were
provided with all they required. And whilst we
were thus treating our enemies in the field, the cowardly
ruffians in Baltimore, who had remained at
home, were brutally assaulting every citizen there
suspected of sympathizing with the people of the
South in their struggle for independence, because
some poltroon, who had deserted his companions at
the first fire, reported they had been murdered in
cold blood to a man after having surrendered themselves.

The officers of the First Maryland Confederate
called upon those of the First Maryland Federal,
and offered them any assistance in their power, and
in some instances it was thankfully accepted. Colonel
Kenly was quite badly wounded, by either a
pistol ball or a sabre cut, in the head, and at the

54
time that I saw him appeared to be suffering much
mental depression, caused by his misfortune. His
wound he seemed to care but little for; but, as he
paced the floor, would, from time to time, bend over
his adjutant, Tarr, who was desperately wounded,
and gaze anxiously in his face.

CHAPTER VII.

On the morning of the 24th Ewell took up the
line of march for Winchester, Jackson having
moved on Strasburg the evening before. That night
we encamped on the banks of the Opequon, six
miles from our destination. Here we were ordered
to cook some rations, and be ready to move at midnight
upon Banks, whom we intended to attack at
daylight.

Long before the sun had risen on the morning of
the 25th, the commands of Jackson and Ewell were
in line of battle about two miles from the town, the
former to the left of the Valley turnpike, the latter
joining him on the right. Skirmishers were thrown
out, and cautiously, at early dawn, through the
dense fog that prevailed, the Confederate line advanced.

In front of a portion of Ewellâs line the First
Maryland was deployed, which, after proceeding a
short distance, encountered the enemyâs skirmishers,

55
who fell back at our approach. About the same
time was heard the spattering of musketry in the
direction of Jackson, which told us he, too, had
them in his front.

The fog had now become so dense as to make it
impossible to see twenty steps in any direction; and
Colonel Johnson therefore thought it advisable to
assemble his skirmish line, as we had entirely lost
sight of our line of battle, and did not know but
we might be enveloped by the enemy. Quietly the
men were drawn in, and the regiment lay down in
an orchard and concealed itself behind a board fence,
to await the lifting of the fog.

For an hour everything was still as death, when,
the fog rising somewhat, a column of the enemy
was revealed lying behind a stone wall about three
hundred yards in our front, with his right flank
resting toward us, and totally unconscious of our
close proximity. They were apparently intent on
watching something before them; and presently, to
our horror, there emerged from the fog the Twenty-First
North Carolina regiment, marching directly
upon the stone wall, and altogether ignorant of the
ambuscade there awaiting. Scarcely two hundred
yards separated them, and in a minute the poor fellows
would be in the fatal trap. Like ourselves, they
had become separated from the main body and lost
their way; but, unlike ourselves, had failed to exercise
the precaution to ascertain where they were
before advancing.

56
There was nothing on earth we could do to warn
them of their danger. Oh! it was a sad, sickening
sight, to see them thus unconsciously marching
straight into the jaws of death. On, on they go,
and nearer and nearer they approach the treacherous
fence, behind which they expect to shelter themselves.
They are but forty yards from it.

âCan nothing be done for them?â I heard from
more than one around me.

No; too late; too late; and the next instant the
long line of blue rise from their cover; there is an
instantâs pause, and then comes a deafening volley
of musketry, and the deadly minnie by hundreds
are sent tearing and crashing through the Confederate
columns. The slaughter was appalling, and
the survivors fled to the rear in the utmost confusion.

But they were avenged; for just then the gallant
Griffin, of the Baltimore Light Artillery, espied
them, and training the guns of his splendid battery
upon the fence, he raked it from one end to the
other, sending the enemy flying to a safer position
nearer the town.

On the left Jackson was now hotly engaged,
whilst, with the exception of his artillery, Ewell is
unaccountably idle. Why could he not swing the
right of his division around in the rear of the town,
thereby enveloping the enemy and cutting off his
retreat, whilst he at the same time attacked those
who appeared only in front of his left, for there was
no enemy on our right, and Jackson was more than

57
a match for those with whom he was contending?
No, he is awaiting orders from Jackson, as he afterwards
did from Lee at Gettysburg, and the opportunity
is lost.

The fog had now entirely disappeared, and on the
hillâs side to the left of us were the contending
forces of Jackson and Banks engaged in a desperate
struggle. For an hour the fight raged, of which
we were silent but unwilling spectators. At length
Jacksonâs reserves reached him, a little late, but in
time, taking into consideration their long march
from Strasburg that night, and he immediately prepared
for a charge. The enemy was also hurrying
forward reinforcements to resist the onset he knew
was coming.

Dick Taylorâs and three Virginia brigades were
thrown into position to make the charge; and it
was a grand sight as, with a yell, they moved forward
at the double quick.

âI shall wait for orders no longer, but will join
in that charge if I live!â exclaimed Colonel Johnson,
quickly swinging himself into the saddle.
âForward, double quick,â was the command, and
the next instant we were dashing across the country
in the direction of the enemy.

Jacksonâs right was not more than four hundred
yards to the left of us, and therefore Johnson thought
by moving diagonally and at a rapid pace we would
join him almost at the instant he should strike the
enemy.

58
Steadily, in the face of a deadly fire, the Confederate
column advances, leaving in its wake scores of
dead and wounded; but never halting, never hesitating,
it hurls itself upon the enemy with irresistible
fury, rending, tearing, and grinding them to
pieces. Closely pursued the survivors fled towards
Winchester, and pursued and pursuers entered the
town simultaneously. The First Maryland passed
down Loudoun street, and, pressing on, capturing
prisoners at every step, did not halt until it reached
the Taylor Hotel, opposite which we found two large
storehouses on fire, filled with medical stores. Colonel
Johnson quickly detached a portion of the regiment
to suppress the flames, while he at the same
time ordered a company to surround and search
the hotel for the notorious Dave Strother, or âPorte
Crayon,â who a citizen informed us was there. The
flames were speedily extinguished, but fortunately
for Strother he had been gone about five minutes, or
I am inclined to think much of his âPersonal Recollectionsâ
would have treated of Libby and Belle Isle.

In obedience to the orders of Banks the town had
been set on fire in several places, and men and women
were rushing frantically through the streets
appealing to the troops to save them from the dreadful
calamity that seemed so imminent. Their appeals
were not in vain; and in a short time the
flames were everywhere extinguished, except near
the depot, where several large warehouses had
been fired, and which were totally consumed with

59
their contents. Had the troops of Jackson been one
half hour later this ancient and once thriving town
would have been only a mass of smouldering ruins.

The defeat of the enemy was complete; but owing
to the apathy of Ewell and the wretched disposition
of our cavalry very many of them effected their
escape, carrying with them most of their artillery
and a large wagon train. As it was, however, we
captured an immense amount of stores of every
description, and about four thousand prisoners.

The joy of the citizens of Winchester at once more
having the protection of the Confederate troops,
knew no bounds, and as we filed through the streets
in pursuit of the enemy, provisions and delicacies in
abundance were lavished upon us, while more than
one of our young fellows came in for an earnest embrace
from the matron of some well-grown household.
Indeed, Colonel Johnson himself received
one of these favors. Now, the Colonel was regarded
one of the handsomest men in the First Maryland,
and having dismounted from his horse in an unguarded
moment, was espied and singled out by
an old lady of Amazonian proportions, just from
the wash tub, who, wiping her hands and mouth on
her apron as she approached, seized him around the
neck with the hug of a bruin, and bestowed upon
him half a dozen kisses that were heard by nearly
every man in the command; and when at length
she relaxed her hold the Colonel looked as though
he had just come out of a vapor bath.

60
âHow do you like that, Colonel?â I heard Captain
Willie Nicholas ask, who, convulsed with laughter,
had been watching the performance.

Drawing forth his handkerchief and wiping from
his face the profuse perspiration that covered it, the
Colonel replied:

âI shouldnât have cared; but, dââ it, she
smells so strong of rosin soap, and I never could
bear the stuff.â

That night the First Maryland went into camp
close by the Winchester and Martinsburg turnpike,
and about four miles from the former town. Upon
the call of the roll but one man was found missing,
Lieutenant Colonel Dorsey, who had been severely
wounded through the right shoulder after entering
the town.

On the morning of the 26th orders were received
to move to Martinsburg, and there collect the large
amount of stores abandoned by the enemy. Two
or three days were consumed in this duty, after
which we rejoined the main body of the army, encamped
near Charlestown.

General Jacksonâs movements since the battle of
Winchester had much puzzled his troops, and entirely
confounded the enemy.

âSurely,â we reasoned, âhe is not going to cross
over into Maryland with the handful of men under
his command, for McDowell would quickly compel
him to return, and then it would be too late to escape
Fremont, who will certainly come down from

61
West Virginia with his army of twenty-five thousand
men.â

Our situation seemed a critical one; but then
Jackson was with us, and with him nothing seemed
impossible.

The day after our arrival at Charlestown General
George H. Steuart was ordered to take the First
Maryland and two batteries of artillery and attack
the enemyâs camp on Bolivar Heights, while a small
force was also directed to make a demonstration from
the Shenandoah Heights upon Harperâs Ferry.

It now became apparent to all that the whole
movement of Jackson from Winchester was a feint,
but for what purpose we were entirely at a loss to
conjecture. Little did we then dream of the splendid
combinations General Lee had formed for the
relief of Richmond, the principal moves in which
had been intrusted to Jackson, the first of which
he was executing.

Our batteries opened upon the enemy posted on
Bolivar Heights about ten oâclock in the morning,
and continued the fire without intermission until
late in the afternoon, when his guns were silenced,
and it became evident he had abandoned the heights.
The infantry then crossed over and took possession
of his camp, which was found entirely deserted. As
soon as we were perceived the batteries upon the
Maryland Heights and at Barberâs house opened
their fire, without effect, however, and our object
having been accomplished, after helping ourselves

62
to the bountiful meal we found on the fire, we retired,
and went into camp near Halltown.

The next day found us retracing our steps to Winchester,
everything betokening haste, but no confusion.
It soon became known to us that Fremont
was rapidly approaching Strasburg from Franklin,
and that a force under Shields was moving to the
same point to intercept Jackson should he attempt
to escape down the Valley. It seemed almost impossible
for us to get away, encumbered as we were
with four thousand prisoners and over two thousand
wagons, most of which were ladened with the spoils
captured from Banks; but Jackson had calculated
it all, and he knew what his troops could do.

All day long we toiled on, and at dusk the rear
of the army (of which we were part) passed through
Winchester; but with what different feelings and
with what a different reception from that of a week
before. Then it was amid the exultant shouts of the
overjoyed citizens; now it was in sorrow and silence,
for it was well known that the victorious army of
yesterday was in full retreat to-day. Without a
word the troops moved through the almost deserted
streets, and all felt a relief when we once more
reached the open country.

On, on, we pushed, through a drenching rain;
and when at last, away in the night, exhausted,
and unable to go farther, the men threw themselves
down to rest upon the damp ground, it was found we
had made thirty-six miles since morning.

63

CHAPTER VIII.

Hungry and but little refreshed, we resumed
the march at daylight next morning. When
six miles from Strasburg the sound of artillery in
our front told us how narrow had been our escape.
It was the gallant General Charlie Winder contesting
a mountain pass with Fremont until the
army, with its long train, should pass. We now
felt comparatively safe, our greatest fear having
been that Fremont would pass the defile before we
could throw troops into it. Of Shields we had no
fear, as our rapid marching had thrown him far in
our rear, and he could not possibly overtake us.
Fisherâs Hill was reached late that evening, and
all danger being past, the men were allowed some
time to rest.

Six miles more to make that night, and then we
should be compelled to go supperless to bed: for the
commissary wagon had stuck in the creek at Newtown,
and we had but little doubt it had fallen into
the hands of the enemy. It was all the fault of
Commissary Captain John Howard, who would insist
upon placing in it a barrel of whisky and three
barrels of molasses, besides the regimentâs regular
rations.

Tired and broken down from the excessive marching
of the past few days, the men were but little
disposed to go farther, and when the command to

64
âfall inâ was given it was but indifferently obeyed.
The delay thereby occasioned was, however, productive
of good results, for presently the sound of
a wagon was heard approaching from the direction
we had just come, and in a moment more the missing
commissary wagon came in sight, in charge of
private George Bush, of Company A. Colonel Johnsonâs
countenance underwent a wonderful change,
as did that of every man in the regiment. Looking
stern, however, he demanded to know of Bush âwhy
he had been straggling?â

âWhy you see, Colonel,â he replied, âmy feet
were kind oâ sore, and I couldnât cotch up; so I
seed this here wagon stuck in the mud, and knowd
it belonged to us; and you see I knowd as you know
what was in it, and so I says to myself, âThem ar
Yanks shanât have her;â and so I confisticated that
are team; but it couldnât pull it nary inch. So you
see, Colonel, as the crackers and meat wasnât very
heavy, but the whisky and merlasses wor, so you
see, Colonel, there was no alternation but ter empty
her out.â

âEmpty her out, sir,â interrupted the Colonel,
in a voice of thunder, and with a countenance black
as midnight; âempty her out, you rascal? Why
didnât you save a
part
of the contents, at least?â

âAnd so I did, sir. The meat and crackers wor
ondispensable; but you see, Colonel, them ere people
about Newtown are mighty poor, and you know,
sir, I always wor kind oâ good-hearted, and then

65
them merlasses and the barrel of whisky wor so tarnal
heavyââ

âAnd you gave them the whisky and the molasses?â
roared the Colonel.

âNow, Colonel,â said Bush, âyou must really
excuse me this time if I gave them allââ

âAll?â interrupted the Colonel.

âYes, sir; all the
superfluity but the barrel of
whisky
.â

âBush, you are a bad soldier,â said the Colonel,
âand shall have a weekâs extra guard duty for wasting
âthem merlasses,â as you call it, though, under
the circumstances, I might have done the same.
But it wonât do to encourage such extravagance
in a well-disciplined command. Captain Howard,
knock the bung out of that barrel and give each of
the men a stiff drink, while you will take care and
reserve an extra one for the officers.â

It is needless to say the order was obeyed with
alacrity, and the six miles were made in quick time
to the song of âOh, let us be joyful!â

Our camp that night was about midway between
Strasburg and Woodstock. At midnight we were
awakened from our sound slumbers by the rattle of
small arms in the direction of the former place, and
shortly after a broken and disordered mass of cavalry
came dashing into our camp, riding everything
down that came in their way, and yelling at the top
of their voices that the enemy was upon us.

Convinced that we were in more danger of bodily

66
harm from the cowardly cavalrymen than from the
enemy, we turned out
en masse
and drove them from
the ground, and the last we saw of them they were
making their way at the top of their horsesâ speed
towards Woodstock. It afterwards turned out that
they had encountered a number of the broken down
men, and mistaking each other for enemies, in the
dark, a fight had ensued, in which the cavalrymen
were routed.

Early next morning we resumed our march, the
First Maryland being in the rear of the infantry,
with orders to support the cavalry and artillery
under Generals George H. Steuart and Turner
Ashby, who were keeping the enemyâs advance in
check.

When within a mile or two of Woodstock, Fremontâs
cavalry, under Colonel Percy Wyndham,
dashed upon the cavalry under Stewart and scattered
it in every direction. It was in vain that gallant
officer endeavored to rally the frightened troopers;
but the harder he swore the faster they rode, until
they came upon the First Maryland in the streets of
Woodstock.

âGet out of the way! get out of the way! the
enemy are upon you!â they called out at the top of
their voices, as they dashed madly through the town.

But Colonel Johnson, not understanding such
tactics, coolly wheeled his regiment across the street,
and, charging them with the bayonet, drove them
back in the direction from whence they came. Some

67
were rallied by the General, who had by this time
come up; but the majority took to the fields, and
made good their escape from both friends and foes.

In this disgraceful affair we came near losing two
pieces of the Baltimore Light Artillery. Entirely
deserted by the cavalry supporting them, they were
at the mercy of the enemy; but the brave Griffin,
although surrounded, drove his guns through their
ranks, and bore his pieces off in triumph.

These skirmishes were of daily occurrence as the
Confederate army marched leisurely in the direction
of Staunton. By burning bridges along our
route we were enabled to retard the enemyâs advance,
and by easy marches to rest and refresh
our men and keep the wagon train and prisoners
well up.

Finally, in the afternoon of the 5th of June, the
army reached Harrisonburg, where we received intelligence
that made the stoutest of us tremble.
The turnpike bridge across the Shenandoah had
been destroyed, and having no pontoons it was impossible
to cross as the stream was very high and
rapid.

Any other man but Jackson would have given up
in despair, and we should have been lost. Not so
with him. There was still another bridge that
spanned the river at Port Republic, and thither he
determined to march, over roads indescribable. Diverging
to the left, therefore, about a mile from
Harrisonburg, he took the road to Port Republic,

68
and, after marching a mile or two, went into camp
for the night, the enemy occupying Harrisonburg.

The next morning, the 6th day of June,âa day
that will ever be remembered by usâthe enemyâs
videttes were within rifle-shot upon the hills behind
us. He was following us closely; and it was evident
we would be compelled to fight before reaching
the river. Slowly we retired, the enemy as slowly
following.

In this way we marched about four miles, when
Ashby, in command of the rear guard, determined
to give his persistent foe a little turn up. Placing
his men in the woods by the side of the road he quietly
awaited the attack. Catching sight of the man
he had for days been endeavoring to âbag,â the
dashing Wyndham charged at the head of his New
Jersey troops; but, alas! he had reckoned without
his host, for a counter charge ordered by the brave
Ashby, and made with irresistible impetuosity, overthrew
Wyndham, and scattered his Jersey Blues to
the four winds. The pursuit was continued until
Ashby was nearly up with their advanced infantry,
the Pennsylvania Bucktails, who were encamped
about two miles from Harrisonburg. Gathering up
his prisoners, among whom was Wyndham himself,
he fell back to the infantry, determined upon attacking
this body, for he deemed their capture an easy
matter. Alas! it was a sad, sad mistake, and cost
many valuable lives, and among them the incomparable
Ashby himself.

69
Contrary to his own judgment, General Ewell
yielded to General Ashbyâs earnest solicitations, and
furnished him with three regiments of infantry with
which to attack and surprise the enemyâs advance.
The regiments selected for the work were the First
Maryland and Fifty-Eighth and Forty-Fourth Virginia.
So fearful was General Ewell that some disaster
would befall the expedition that he accompanied
it himself. The troops moved with the
utmost caution through the dense woods for about
three miles, when they were halted, and the companies
of Captains Herbert and Nicholas thrown
forward as skirmishers. These were under the
command of Ashby, closely followed by the main
body under command of Ewell. In a few minutes
the rattle of musketry in our front told us that the
enemy had been found, and the Fifty-Eighth was
immediately sent in, when the fight became very
severe, the contending forces not being over fifty
yards apart. For about fifteen minutes the conflict
continued, when the Fifty-Eighth broke and came
to the rear in great confusion. The Forty-Fourth
was then sent forward, and appeared to be faring
but little better, when General Ewell, who had
been in the thickest of the fight and exposed to
much danger, dashed up to Colonel Johnson and
called out, âCharge, Colonel, charge, and end this
matter!â For some minutes we had been suffering
from the enemyâs fire, and the order was therefore
gladly obeyed. Steadily the regiment moved

70
through the woods to the attack, guided by the
firing, for not one of the foemen could be seen. At
length, feeling that he was within striking distance,
Johnson gave the command, âForward, double
quick,â and with a yell our fellows dashed up the
hill which shielded the enemy from our view; but,
as we gained its crest, a terrible volley was poured
into our very faces, and the regiment reeled and
staggered, for Johnson was down struggling to disengage
himself from his dying horse, and some
twenty of the officers and men had fallen. The
pause was but momentary, however, for collecting
themselves the brave fellows rushed furiously upon
the enemy, and, reserving their fire until they were
within twenty paces of them, poured into their
ranks so destructive a volley that the survivors
broke and attempted to reach their main body. In
this but few succeeded, as they were compelled to
recross an open field, about four hundred yards
wide, and all the while subjected to our fire, which
was delivered with the utmost coolness and precision.

Our loss in this unfortunate fight was severe, for
besides the many brave officers and men in the three
little regiments, we had to mourn the death of the
chivalrous Ashby, the idol of the army. Early in
the conflict, while urging his men forward, and exposing
himself most recklessly, a ball passed through
his body, and he fell dead.

Brig. Gen. BRADLEY T. JOHNSON.

71
When the news of the death of this Christian
gentleman and glorious soldier became known to
the army, a universal wail went up, and strong men
wept like children, for truly they had lost one they
dearly loved. Never more was his clarion voice to be
heard as he led his fierce legions in the headlong
charge. Never more the piercing gray eye to sparkle
as he dashed with lightning speed through the ranks
of the foemen, dealing death blows at every stride,
avenging his peopleâs wrongs and the death of a
basely-murdered brother.

The First Maryland had many of its noblest
spirits to mourn for, and among them the gallant
Captain N. S. Robertson, Lieutenant Nicholas Snowden,
and privates Beatty, Schleigh, Harris, and
others whose names I do not remember. The loss of
the enemy was very severe. Their commander, Lieutenant-Colonel
Kane, with several of his officers and
many of the men were wounded and prisoners in
our hands, and, to use Kaneâs own words, âhardly
a dozen of the command escaped.â

Sadly, as the dusk of evening came on, we gathered
together our dead, and the wounded of both
sides who could bear removal, and mournfully retraced
our steps, and near midnight lay down to
rest beside our cold, inanimate companions.

As we lay there we could not but think how many
of us would in a few hours be with them, sleeping
our last sleep; and the next morning, as we listened
to the reveille, we thought it might be our last, for
our dead comrades had heard it but yesterday. Such
is the uncertainty of a soldierâs life.

72
In a little churchyard attached to Union Church,
near Cross Keys, we dug the one grave that was to
contain all that was left of them, and in their uniforms,
wrapt in their blankets, we lay them down
to rest. Theirs was the burial they would have
most wishedâa soldierâs burial.

CHAPTER IX.

Sullenly, as the foe advanced, we fell back in
the direction of Port Republic, determined, when
attacked by Fremontâs overwhelming army, to fight
to the last man. At length we halted at Cross
Keys, and made preparations to pass our wagons
and prisoners over the crazy old bridge, which afforded
us the only means of escaping the destruction
which threatened us. Therefore, forming his army
in line of battle on the morning of the 8th of June,
to keep Fremont in check, Jackson moved his prisoners
upon the bridge, but scarcely had the first of
them crossed when they were surprised by a squadron
of Shieldsâ cavalry, that dashed into the town
of Port Republic, and who speedily captured the
guard and released the prisoners. Indeed, General
Jackson himself narrowly escaped. Hastening
back, however, he brought forward a body of cavalry,
and charging them in turn recaptured not
only all he had lost, but many of the enemy beside.

73
From the prisoners he learned that Shields was rapidly
approaching with a large force from McDowellâs
army, and they expressed themselves confident that
we would be crushed between him and Fremont.

Things looked gloomy enough, it was true, but
such was the confidence of the troops in Jackson
that our situation caused little or no uneasiness.
Quickly detaching his own division from the line of
battle he had formed in front of Fremont, he placed
it in position to hold Shields in check, and at the
same time cover the passage of the bridge, whilst
Ewell, with his little division of five thousand men,
was to fight Fremontâs twenty-five thousand. Thus
when the battle commenced the Confederate lines
presented the singular spectacle of two armies
standing back to back, facing a foe in front and
rear, and but three miles apart.

About ten oâclock the enemy moved to the attack
upon Ewell in beautiful order, and first struck his
left, which was barely a skirmish line of the First
Maryland supporting Griffinâs Baltimore Battery.
On came the enemy until they had arrived within a
hundred yards of us, when the deadly fire from our
Mississippi rifles and the grape and canister from
Griffin drove them back in confusion. Again they
advanced and took position about three hundred
yards distant, when they opened upon us a most
terrible fire from the Belgium gun. Fortunately
we were posted in a skirt of woods, and were well
protected from their fire. For hours this desperate

74
conflict continued, the enemy making repeated attempts
to penetrate our line, but every assault was
repelled with heavy loss to the assailants. And
during those precious hours Jackson was accomplishing
his purpose of passing his trains and provisions
over the old bridge.

All day long Ewell fought on with the same
troops and held the same line of battle, for there
were none to relieve those first put in, and these
the enemy were unable to drive one foot. The odds
were fearful indeedâfive to one; but we were desperate
men, fighting for our lives and liberties. At
length relief came to us in the declining day; and
how anxiously, we watched the sun go down that
evening, for we were well nigh worn out from seven
hourâs incessant fighting. At dark the firing almost
entirely ceased, and we still held the ground
we did in the morning, and Jacksonâs trains were
safely over the river.

The loss of the First Maryland in this engagement
was severe, although we fought mostly under
cover of the woods, but so terrible was the enemyâs
fire that it was almost impossible to expose for an
instant any part of the body without being struck.
It is strange to say not a single man was killed outright,
though we had more than thirty wounded out
of one hundred and seventy-five men; several of
whom, however, afterwards died. In this fight
General George H. Steuart, who was in command
of the Maryland line, was desperately wounded in

75
the breast by a grape shot, and General Elzey, who
commanded the left, was wounded in the leg.

Late that night, leaving our fires brightly burning
to deceive the enemy, we stealthily moved from
before them and commenced to cross the bridge, and
by daylight the last man had reached the longed-for
shore, and Jackson was safe. As the last foot
left it, the bridge was fired in many places, and
having been filled with combustible material, was
almost instantly enveloped in flames. Great indeed
must have been the surprise and chagrin of the
âgreat explorer,â as at daylight he beheld the
lurid flames and dense black smoke that ascended
high up to heaven, and heralded to him the escape
of the wily foe he had believed inextricably within
his toils.

But our work was not yet done; for six thousand
men and a battery of artillery of Shieldsâ command,
under General Tyler, held a strong position
right in our path, and must be disposed of. They
had been silent spectators of the passage of the
bridge, never offering to molest us in the least, and
Jackson had refrained from attacking them until he
had escaped from his more powerful antagonist.
But now they must be got rid of, and for that purpose
General Dick Taylor and his Louisiana and
two Virginia brigades were moved down the river
side, and a vigorous attack made upon the enemyâs
position. They were repulsed, however, with heavy
loss, but a second attempt proved more successful,

76
and the enemy was driven from his position with terrible
slaughter, and the battery captured. In this
engagement, which was of but two hoursâ duration,
the enemy lost over two thousand in killed and
wounded, besides nearly a thousand prisoners.

During the latter part of the battle of Port Republic
Fremontâs army remained drawn up on the
opposite bank of the river, unable to render any
assistance to the unfortunate Tyler, and to whose
destruction they were silent spectators. The battle
over though, and whilst the Confederates were
burying the dead and succoring the wounded of
both sides, the brutal Fremont, wild with disappointment,
opened his batteries upon the ambulance
and burial parties, which fire killed many of his
own wounded people, and compelled us to leave
the balance on the field uncared for, and his dead
unburied.

The battle of Port Republic closed Jacksonâs
Valley Campaign, for Fremont finding it useless to
attempt to cope with his wily antagonist in his
mountain fastness, retired in the direction of Winchester.

Never in his previous or subsequent campaigns
did Jacksonâs military genius and daring show to
greater advantage than in this of the Valley of
Virginia. In less than six weeks he had beaten the
army of Milroy, destroyed that of Banks, baffled
that of Fremont, and annihilated that of Tyler,
and all with less than twelve thousand men; besides

77
capturing from the enemy millions worth of
stores, &c.

From General Ewellâs official report of the Valley
Campaign we take the following highly complimentary
extract:

âThe history of the Maryland regiment, gallantly
commanded by Colonel Bradley T. Johnson during
the campaign of the Valley, would be the history of
every action from Front Royal to Cross Keys. On
the 6th, near Harrisonburg, the Fifty-Eighth Virginia
Regiment was engaged with the Pennsylvania
âBucktails,â the fighting being close and bloody.
Colonel Johnson came up with his regiment in the
hottest period, and by a dashing charge in flank
drove the enemy off with heavy loss, capturing
Lieutenant-Colonel Kane, commanding. In commemoration
of this gallant conduct I ordered one
of the captured âBucktailsâ to be appended as a
trophy to their flag. The action is worthy of acknowledgment
from a higher source, more particularly
as they avenged the death of the gallant
General Ashby who fell at the same time. Four
color bearers were shot down in succession, but each
time the colors were caught before reaching the
ground, and were finally borne by Corporal Daniel
Shanks to the close of the action.

âOn the 8th instant at Cross Keys they were opposed
to three of the enemyâs regiments in succession.â

78
General Jackson, also, in his official report of the
Valley Campaign, thus speaks of the First Marylandâs
participation in the battle of Harrisonburg:

âApprehending that the Federals would make a
more serious attack, Ashby called for an infantry
support. The brigade of General George H. Steuart
was accordingly ordered forward. In a short
time the Fifty-Eighth Virginia Regiment became
engaged with a Pennsylvania Regiment called the
Bucktails, when Colonel Johnson of the First Maryland
Regiment coming up in the hottest period of
the fire, charged gallantly into its flank, and drove
the enemy with heavy loss from the field, capturing
Lieutenant-Colonel Kane, commanding. In this
skirmish our infantry loss was seventeen killed, fifty
wounded and three missing. In this affair General
Turner Ashby was killed. An official report is not
an appropriate place for more than a passing notice
of the distinguished dead; but the close relation
which General Ashby bore to my command for most
of the past twelve months will justify me in saying
that as a partisan officer I never knew his superior.
His daring was proverbial; his power of endurance
almost incredible; his tone of character heroic, and
his sagacity almost intuitive in divining the purpose
and movement of the enemy.â

79

CHAPTER X.

On the afternoon and evening of the 9th, Jackson
leisurely moved his almost exhausted troops up
the mountain until he reached its summit, where he
went into camp to afford rest to his men after their
arduous campaign.

But there was work yet to be done, though the
nature of which we were then totally ignorant.
Jackson could not long remain idle, and three days
after the battle of Port Republic found us moving
down the mountainâs side in the direction of Weirâs
Cave, where we again went into camp, and were
given to understand that our stay would be a long
one. But the veterans of Jacksonâs division, who
knew him best, shook their heads, and were heard
to say, âwith Jackson a long stay means a short
one, with plenty of marching and fighting ahead,
now mark it.â And so it proved in this instance,
as will be seen.

The day after our arrival at Weirâs Cave, the
First Maryland was ordered to Staunton to muster
out companies H and I, whose terms of service had
expired, and also to muster in a new company just
arrived from Richmond under command of Captain
Barry.

Before our departure General Ewell issued the
following General Order complimenting the command
upon their gallant bearing at Harrisonburg,

80
and directing that one of the buckâs tail captured
by them in that battle, should be appended to their
colors:

Headquarters Third Division.

General Orders, No. 30.

In commemoration of the gallant conduct of the First
Maryland Regiment on the 6th of June, when led by Colonel
Bradley T. Johnson they drove back with loss the âPennsylvania
Bucktail Riflesâ in the engagement near Harrisonburg, Rockingham
County, Virginia, authority is given to have one of the captured
âbucktailsâ (the insignia of the Federal Regiment,) appended
to the color-staff of the First Maryland Regiment.

By order of
Maj. Gen. Ewell.

James Barbur
, A. A. G.

The farewell at Staunton with our comrades of
companies H and I was a most affecting one. For
more than a year we had shared the privations of
the camp and the march, had stood shoulder to
shoulder on more than one bloody field, and had
learned to love each other as only a soldier can love
his companion.

Our new company was composed principally of
young men from the lower counties of Maryland,
and was a fine body, although totally inexperienced.
Captain Barry himself was an old soldier, having
served in Mexico with considerable distinction.

From what we saw at Staunton, we were led to
believe our stay would be a short one, for large
bodies of troops were arriving from Richmond, and
we did not doubt for a moment but we were destined
up the valley after Fremont, and perhaps for

81
the invasion of Maryland. How great our mistake,
and the transportation of these very troops was intended
to convey that same impression to the enemy,
and thereby keep McDowell from uniting with
McClellan, while Lee carried out his great plan of
raising the siege of Richmond with Jacksonâs
assistance.

And it succeeded; for the authorities at Washington
were quickly apprised of the fact, and instead
of sending McClellan the reinforcements he so
earnestly plead for, they withheld them to repel the
audacious Jackson, should he dare to cross the
Potomac, which they did not doubt was his intention.

Suddenly, however, about the 22d of June, the
whole army was put in motion, and marching to
Staunton, took the immense trains that had been for
some time quietly assembling there. Of our destination
at first we had not the slightest conception, but
that we were moving in the
direction
of Richmond
was evident. Could anything have befallen General
Lee? suggested itself, for everything indicated
haste. By the time we had reached Frederickshall,
however, it was generally understood we were destined
to reinforce Lee, who, rumor had it, intended
to surprise McClellan if possible in his fortifications.
This was the terminus of the trip by rail, and disembarking
we took the road by way of Ashland.

On the afternoon of the 26th, whilst marching
rapidly, some four or five miles to the left of

82
Mechanicsville, we were startled by heavy volleys
of musketry and the roar of artillery coming from
that direction. It was then I heard General Ewell,
who was riding close by, exclaim, âthatâs the programme!
thatâs the programme! I think we have
them now!â It was but a few minutes after that
the first Maryland, in the advance, encountered the
enemy, and a sharp fight ensued. We drove them
before us, however, for some distance, when we unexpectedly
found ourselves in the presence of a
heavy column, and were obliged to halt until our
main body came up. During this time the utmost
confusion seemed to prevail within the enemyâs
lines, and shortly after we had discovered them they
commenced to move precipitately to the rear.

That McClellan was surprised and utterly confounded,
was now apparent, and that the next day
would initiate a bloody fight no one doubted. As
night was upon us, we determined to go into camp,
not however until we had taken every precaution to
guard against a surprise. The fighting at Mechanicsville
still continued, and away in the night we
could hear the rattle of musketry and see the
explosion of shells.

The morning of the 27th June broke bright and
beautiful, and long before the sun had risen the
troops were on the march to attack the enemy.
The men were in high spirits, and the rivalry was
intense between those who had served with Jackson
in the Valley and the reinforcements which had

83
reached us at Staunton, among which was Hoodâs
Texans, who were that day to win a name that will
live forever.

We had marched but a few miles when a large
body of troops were observed in motion to our right,
and as General Jackson had received no notice that
any Confederates would move in that direction, he
very naturally supposed them to be the enemy, and
immediately prepared to receive them, for they were
coming directly towards us. Still fearful there
might be some mistake, he withheld his artillery
fire, but threw an occasional shell in their midst to
discover if possible who they were. At the first
shot they deployed their skirmishers with the most
beautiful precision, and advanced across the open
field with great regularity, whilst the heavy columns
of infantry moved upon us, closed
en masse
under
cover of a wood. A fearful tragedy was now about
to be enacted, and was only averted by the daring
of Lieutenant George Booth, acting Adjutant of the
First Maryland. From the first he had maintained
they were our troops, whilst most of the officers,
including General Jackson, were of the opinion
they were not. The uniforms of the skirmishers
were darker than we had ever before seen, and most
of them wore white gaiters, something entirely unknown
in the army of Jackson. Nearer and nearer
they approached, and in a minute more we knew
the mass of infantry must debouche into the plain,
when the hand of friend would unwittingly be

84
raised against friend. At this moment Lieutenant
Booth, unable longer to restrain himself, without
orders, dashed spurs into his horse, and at the risk
of being shot to pieces, rode at full speed in
the direction of the advancing skirmishers. We
watched him with breathless anxiety until he
reached the line, where halting a moment in conference
with one of the officers, he wheeled his
horse and galloped back to inform us it was Branchâs
division of North Carolinians, which had lost its
way. It was a great relief, and we congratulated
each other when we met upon the timely discovery.

This affair, however, delayed us at least an hour,
and we had no time to spare. Onward, then, we
pressed, our advance occasionally skirmishing with
the enemy, until we reached a dense pine forest, and
here our troubles commenced. The guides were, or
seemed to be, ignorant of the roads, and more than
once we had to retrace our steps. Jackson was
furious, and for the first time I saw him out of
humor. Long before this he should have begun the
fight, and here he was some distance from the field.
Finally, however, we extricated ourselves, and soon
after, about three oâclock in the afternoon, heavy
skirmishing, and the occasional roar of artillery in
our front, told us we were up with the enemy and
developing his position.

As we neared the field the artillery and infantry
fire increased in volume, and it was evident that the
advanced troops of Jackson were hotly engaged, as

85
were those of Hill on our right. Steadily the rattle
of musketry swelled as Jackson forwarded reinforcements,
until it became almost deafening. But as
hour after hour passed, and that awful fire did not
recede, he began to show symptoms of uneasiness.
Upon his success on the left depended everything.
Should he fail the splendidly conceived plans of
General Lee would fail also, and Richmond would
be at the mercy of the invader. Was it a wonder,
then, that he rode nervously to and fro, and appeared
for the first time to fear that the gods of
battle had forsaken him? Every eye was upon the
great chieftain as he galloped along the lines of the
troops held in reserve, and the anxious expression
upon that heretofore immovable countenance was
observable to all.

âGeneral Elzey,â said he, riding up to that gallant
officer, âmove your brigade forward; this officer
will show you to where you are most needed,â
at the same time pointing to a member of his staff
who, all covered with dust and the smoke of battle,
had just ridden up.

âGood bye, Captain,â exclaimed the brave Captain
William Shearer, of the Winchester Boomerangs
in the Thirteenth Virginia, and a dear friend.
âI hope to see you soon again;â and as his command
filed by the poor fellow pressed my hand for
the last time; for, alas, in a few minutes the brigade
was cut to pieces, and he was carried from the field
with a fatal wound in the head. And here, too, fell

86
its heroic commander, Elzey, with a fearful wound
through the face; and the dashing McDonald, of
his staff, shot dead while performing prodigies of
valor.

As these disasters came thick and fast, and the
enemy seemed to defy his utmost efforts, the right
hand of Jackson was more frequently extended
towards heaven, as though invoking the aid of the
great invisible Being there, and his horse moved
more rapidly as he impatiently spurred through the
ranks awaiting intelligence from the front.

âThere goes Hoodâs Texans!â exclaimed Colonel
Johnson, as that splendid command, the last of our
reserves, commenced to move. âIf they fail, God
help us;â and we all felt the truth of the observation.

The little First Maryland was now left all alone,
for having been detached from Scottâs Virginia brigade
after the battle of Port Republic, and to which
we had been attached temporarily; we were not expected
to take much part in the heavy fighting, but
were reserved principally for skirmish duty.

âColonel Johnson will remain where he is, and
arrest all stragglers from the field,â was the order
of General Jackson, as he put spurs to his horse
and rode towards the front.

âI will until after you get out of sight, Mr. Jackson,
but no longer,â the Colonel muttered.

âAnd neither would I, Johnson,â exclaimed a
gentleman in citizenâs clothes, who at that moment

87
threw himself from a much jaded horse and advanced
to his side. âI came here for my first fight,
and it has got to be with the Maryland boys.â

Turning around what was my surprise to recognize
in the person of our visitor Mr. George Kyle,
(afterwards Major Kyle,) who had ridden from Richmond
to be one of its defenders.

âHere, boys,â he continued, âI have some letters
for you from home, just arrived by blockade-runner,
and as they may be the last you will ever receive, I
would advise you to lose no time in reading them;â
and he commenced distributing to the eager troops
the large package of letters in his possession. As
he did so the musketry fire redoubled in intensity,
and from the yell which followed we knew the
Texans had grappled with the foe.

âGreat God!â exclaimed Kyle, stopping midway
in the distribution of the letters, âis it possible that
men can cheer in the face of such a fire as that?â

âAttention, battalion,â was now the sharp command
from our Colonel, and moving rapidly by the
right flank we were on our wayâwe knew not
whither. Our route lay through dense woods for
some distance, and from whence we suddenly came
into a broad plain, and away to our left burst upon
the view the two armies desperately contending.
As we then moved by the left flank into line of
battle the splendid brigade of Georgians under
Lawton came up on the run, and moving in front
of us led the way towards the scene of strife. Swiftly

88
the two columns moved forward in the face of a terrible
fire of musketry and artillery. Finding the
fire too hot, Lawton soon ordered a halt, and his
men lay down to shelter themselves from the flying
bullets. But âForward!â was the command of our
Colonel, and onward through that storm of bullets
moved the little First Maryland, which, as they
passed over the prostrate bodies of the Georgians,
were enthusiastically cheered. On, on, they moved
through that vale of fire and death with the same
precision as on battalion drill. Immediately in our
front was a battery that had proved terribly destructive
to our troops from the commencement of the
battle. Again and again had it been charged, but
without success. That battery Johnson was determined
to assail, but our chances of success were slim,
indeed.

Regiments broken and shattered were now met
coming to the rear, and many of the men attached
themselves to our command. One gallant fellow,
the color bearer of Wrightâs Legion, carried back
some distance by the rush of his panic-stricken comrades,
declared his flag should go no farther, and
planting himself upon our left, rallied many of his
companions. The First Maryland had thus been
augmented to about four hundred men, and with
these Johnson intended to charge the battery and
its infantry supports.

Taking advantage of a rise in the ground, he
halted the men under its shelter, and ordered them

89
to rest preparatory to making the desperate assault.
Scarcely had the command been given when Captain
McHenry Howard, of General Charles Winderâs
staff, galloped up with orders to remain where we
were until that General could overtake us with the
Stonewall Brigade. âThe General has observed
your movements, sir, and thinks the place too strong
for you; we will, therefore, charge together.â In
a few moments Jacksonâs favorite brigade was with
us, and, at the command of General Winder, we
moved forward with irresistible impulse, and scrambling
over the enemyâs breastwork of knapsacks, we
swept everything before us.

The last charge had been made, and the last battery
captured at Gainesâ Mills, and the right of
McClellanâs army was seeking safety in flight.

Night was upon us, and completely exhausted,
we threw ourselves upon the ground in the midst
of the dead, wounded and dying, and despite the
shrieks and cries and groans of anguish from hundreds
around us, were soon wrapped in sleep.

The field next morning presented a ghastly spectacle,
and the thousands of maimed and dismembered
bodies attested the severity of the fight. Litter-bearers
were moving in all directions, gathering
the wounded, while burial parties were busily engaged
with pick and spade digging the trenches in
which were to rest those beyond all worldly cares
and suffering. The camp-follower was also plying
his avocation, and as he moved from one to another

90
of his victims an expression of satisfaction or disappointment
would escape him as he counted the yield
of each. Some of the men, however, were in search
of boots and shoes, which they so much needed, as
thousands of Jacksonâs command were barefooted,
and had been for weeks.

As I walked over the field I observed one of them,
a North Carolinian, with his foot upon the stomach
of a dead man, tugging vigorously at a boot, which
after a little while he succeeded in getting off. I
stopped to see how he would get the other one, for
the leg had been shattered to pieces just above the
knee by a cannon ball, and hung but by a few
shreds. A desperate effort separated the leg from
the body, and the fellow was in a quandary. Looking
around he espied me, when approaching, he extended
the ghastly stump, and said, âMister, will
you please hold onter this tarnel thing ontil I git
the boot off?â The assistance he asked for I declined
to render, when shouldering his prize he
started off muttering, âIf you wonât, some of the
boys will, thatâs all.â

91

CHAPTER XI.

About ten oâclock on the morning of the 28th,
Ewellâs division was ordered to move on the
York River Railroad, and destroy it at Dispatch
Station. As we advanced the enemy set fire to his
stores to prevent them falling into our hands.
Vast quantities were captured, however, and for
many days we lived on desiccated vegetables, and
indulged in an occasional cup of coffee. But little
resistance was offered our advance, under General
J. E. B. Stuart, and without the loss of a man we
reached our destination about three oâclock in the
afternoon. Working parties were at once detailed
from the various regiments, and set to work tearing
up the track.

Whilst thus engaged, General Ewell and staff
went out to reconnoitre, but presently returned at
full speed. Riding up to Colonel Johnson, he
directed that officer to send some men to âdrive
those fellows off who had given him chase.â I was
ordered to take a dozen men of my company, and
the Colonel prepared to accompany me. After
crossing a ravine by a narrow path I came into a
large open space, when to my surprise, not over a
hundred yards in front of me, I observed a mounted
officer and two attendants. Commanding my men
in a low voice to make no demonstration, we walked
quietly towards them. Not to be caught in this

92
way, however, they wheeled their horses and slowly
rode off. Being in advance of my men, and seeing
they were about to escape me, I levelled my Mississippi,
which I invariably carried on such occasions,
and fired. The shot was hastily aimed, and instead
of taking effect upon the officer, for whom it was
intended, it struck the man behind him, who,
raising himself convulsively in his saddle, fell forward
on his horseâs neck, and would have rolled to
the ground had he not been caught and held by one
of his companions. My men then fired, but without
effect. At this instant Colonel Johnson, who
had not yet overtaken us, dashed through the
woods, exclaiming as he approached: âLook to
your left, Captain, look to your left!â I did so,
and what was my surprise to behold a heavy column
of cavalry drawn up but a short way off, and apparently
deliberating whether to charge or retire.
I was in a bad scrape. A half mile from the main
body, with a dozen men, and they, too, with unloaded
guns. For a moment I thought I was gone;
but Colonel Johnson, whose presence of mind never
forsook him in the midst of the most trying difficulties,
wheeled his horse towards the woods and cried
at the top of his voice: âCome on, my brave men,
here we have a whole regiment of them!â This
had the desired effect, and the gallant troopers went
off like the wind, nor did they stop until they had
ridden a mile, when again halting they drew up in
line.

93
General Ewell, hearing the firing, soon after
joined us, when Griffin was ordered up with a section
of the Baltimore Light Artillery. Scarcely
had he fired the first shot, however, when there
issued from the woods in the rear of the cavalry
three or four puffs of smoke, and as many shells
came shrieking over and around us, and almost at
the same time a battery on our right opened an enfilading
fire that made the position untenable.

âSome things can be done as well as some
others!â exclaimed the General. âCaptain Griffin,
you will limber up and go to the rear.â

By twelve oâclock the next day, Sunday, the 29th
of June, the railroad had been destroyed for a considerable
distance, and we suspended our labors.

During the afternoon I took a stroll through the
enemyâs deserted camps, and feeling fatigued, I laid
down on the railroad bank and commenced to read
a chapter from a little Testament I had picked up
in my rambles. I had been thus engaged perhaps
half an hour, when on raising my head I was astonished
to behold, about two miles up the road on
the other side of the Chickahominy, a locomotive
and train of cars standing upon the track. Returning
immediately to camp I reported the fact to Colonel
Johnson, who informed General Ewell, and he, with
General Trimble and several others, repaired to the
spot. Glasses were brought into requisition, but
to save us we could not make out what they were
doing. During my absence a tree had been cut

94
down and rolled in front of the engine to conceal
their movements. For half an hour we were lost in
conjecture, when suddenly the tree was removed
from the track, and the train, all enveloped in
flames and smoke, came rushing with fearful speed
directly towards us.

That it was an infernal machine of some sort
instantly suggested itself, and a general stampede
ensued, we forgetting at the moment that the end
of the bridge towards the enemy had been burned
the evening before, and therefore the impossibility
of the train reaching us. On the fiery mass rushed,
every moment increasing its speed, until it reached
the bridge, when it plunged headlong into the shallow
stream, and a vast pillar of white smoke sprang
upwards into the sky, which rose higher and higher,
and continually unfolded itself from within in waves
of snowy vapor, until the sun was hidden from our
view. The sound of the explosion instantly followed,
and the earth shook and trembled as though riven
by an earthquake. It was a spectacle of inexpressible
grandeur, and one never to be forgotten by the
few who witnessed it. For a moment we were held
spell-bound; when General Ewell, who was the first
to recover his presence of mind, exclaimed âThat
was an ordnance train. Have the troops formed
immediately, for the enemy is retreating, and we
will be of no further use on this side of the Chickahominy.â
And his conclusion seemed correct, for
now in every direction could be seen the smoke from
burning stores.

95
In the midst of a drenching rain which set in soon
after, the troops retraced their steps until midnight,
when we went into bivouac. Early next day our
march was resumed, and soon after we crossed the
Chickahominy near where McClellan had had his
headquarters.

Now at every step something left by the enemy
was encountered to attract our attention. Pontoon
trains, wagons, cooking utensils, barrels of beef,
and boxes of crackers; a balloon with apparatus
complete for manufacturing the gas; towers, lookouts,
&c., &c. Upon the Charles City road we found
a great many of his dead, still unburied, killed the
day before in an encounter with Magruder. That
McClellan was retreating towards Harrisonâs Landing
by way of Malvern Hill was well known to our
General-in-Chief, and in that direction we were
ordered to direct our steps.

CHAPTER XII.

On the afternoon of the 1st of July the troops of
Jackson passed by Frazierâs farm, and the dead
that lay on every side gave evidence of the terrible
conflict that Longstreet had had there the day before.

About four oâclock the rattle of musketry and the
roar of artillery began in our front, and rapidly
increased as we advanced. Passing the Willis

96
church we halted in the woods to await orders. The
battle had now fully begun, and raged with great
fury. It was evident from the very first that the
enemy had greatly the advantage in position, and
that on our part the battle would have to be fought
almost exclusively with infantry. Several times
Jackson sent in his artillery, but they were quickly
compelled to return torn and disabled. Never before
had I listened to such an infernal din, and it was
every moment increasing. The woods in which we
lay was swept by the artillery, and immense trees
were cut down by the huge shells from the gunboats
as though they had been straws. In the midst of
all this dreadful fire Jackson sat calmly upon his
horse, surrounded by his staff, who in vain urged
him to seek some safer position. At last, after a
shell had exploded in their very midst, killing a
staff officer and several horses, he was persuaded to
leave, and it was with a feeling of relief that we
saw him retire.

As the battle progressed we seemed to be faring
badly, for our best troops were constantly coming
to the rear beaten, and in the utmost confusion.
For four hours did this fire continue, and for four
hours was the First Maryland compelled to lay
under it without being able to return a shot.

At last with gladness we responded to the order
to advance, although it seemed as though we were
marching into the very jaws of death. The scene
as we cleared the woods and approached the field

97
was grand beyond description. For miles the moonless
sky was lit up by the incessant flashes of artillery
and musketry and exploding shells, and it
seemed as though we were stalking forth into a very
sea of fire and flame. But nothing mortal could
withstand that artillery, and again we were compelled
to seek shelter from its fury. For half an
hour longer it continued, when it perceptibly slackened,
and soon ceased altogether.

Completely unnerved and prostrated by the fire we
had been compelled to endure so long, we threw ourselves
upon the ground in the midst of the dead and
dying, not to sleep, but to lay awake and watch the
enemyâs lanterns flitting over the field, where they
were busily engaged removing the wounded, and to listen
to the cries of our own poor fellows who lay mangled
and dying upon that field of awful carnage.

At length I fell into a broken sleep, from which
I was awakened before day by Colonel Johnson, and
ordered to hold myself in readiness to advance my
company, along with Captains Herbert and Edelin,
at the first appearance of daylight. As it dawned
we moved forward over heaps of dead and wounded,
and in a short time after encountered a small force
of the enemy, which retired after exchanging a
volley with us, and it now became evident that
McClellan had withdrawn during the night.

Soon after day the rain commenced to fall in torrents,
and drenched to the skin and miserable, we
set to work to remove our wounded and bury our

98
dead, of which there seemed no end. The majority
of the wounds were of the most dreadful description,
being inflicted principally by fragments of
shell, whilst most of the killed were horribly mangled.
Very many had fallen in the woods, and as
the rain accumulated in the dense foliage, huge
limbs that had been shattered the day before by
artillery, would give way and come to the ground,
crushing the poor wretches who had dragged their
already maimed bodies under them for protection
from the pitiless storm. Altogether, Malvern Hill
was the most dreadful field I ever beheld, and I
hope never to witness such another.

By night of the 2d our melancholy task was done,
and next morning we moved upon the enemy at
Harrisonâs Landing. After slight skirmishing
here for several days, General Lee thought it best
to withdraw, as McClellanâs position was a strong one,
and the army therefore sought the more healthy
country around Richmond wherein to encamp.

The First Maryland was stationed on the Central
Railroad, about three miles from the city, from
whence in a few days it was ordered to Charlottesville
to recruit, and where it arrived about the 15th
of July. Recruiting went on slowly, however, and
after remaining at Charlottesville until the 4th of
August, the command was ordered to Gordonsville,
on its way, we supposed, to join Jackson, who was
then near Cedar Mountain, and daily expecting to
encounter his old adversary Banks, in command of
the advance of Popeâs army.

99
The reader may judge then the surprise of all,
when a few days after our arrival an order came for
the disbanding of the regiment. Nothing could
have surprised us more, and we were not sparing of
anathemas upon the government that had shown so
little gratitude to the brave men who had been so
long battling in its behalf. To disband us within
the very sound of the enemyâs cannon. Could anything
be more humiliating? And then to assign
no reason for it. Had we disgraced our colors, or
had we ever turned our backs upon the foeman?
What could all this mean?

But murder will out, and it was not long before
we discovered that it had been brought about by
two or three politicians from Maryland, who were
aspirants for military fame, but which fame they
were to acquire by being at once foisted into high
positions. Now, as Mr. Davis could not be made to
appreciate their talents as these men would have
him, and give them what they asked for in the
army, they sought through the Secretary of War to
have the First Maryland disbanded, hoping that
what remained might form a nucleus for a regiment
which they were to raise and command. In the
first they succeededâin the last they failed.

It was the 17th of August, if I mistake not, that
Colonel Johnson drew the little remnant of heroes
up in line for the last time, and after a few appropriate
and touching remarks, read the order disbanding
them. Not a man but felt his humiliation,

100
for even as the order was being read the troops of
Longstreet were filing by on their way to new fields
of glory and of conquest. âCome on, Marylanders,
we canât get along without you!â they exclaimed
in their ignorance of what was then transpiring,
and not dreaming that they had seen us on the field
as a body for the last time. And then when the
little State flag presented us before the first Manassas
by the ladies of Maryland, and which we loved
so well, was furled never again to flaunt defiantly
in the face of the foe, a look of affection beamed
upon it from every eye in the command, and strong
men, unable to control their emotions, turned sadly
away. Never had it seemed so dear to us before,
and although now all tattered and torn it looked
more beautiful than when it came from the fair
fingers that worked it. To the donors we then
pledged ourselves to defend it with our heartâs best
blood, and that promise had been sacredly kept.
Brave hearts and strong arms had carried it through
the blood and carnage of many an ensanguined field,
and where the fight raged thickest there it was ever
to be found. Heroic men had fallen beneath its
folds, and as the eye grew dim they sought a last
glance at the colors they had loved so well in health
and strength, but which seemed still dearer to them
in death. Farewell, dear little emblem of womanâs
devotion; upon thy folds rests no dishonor. There,
fold it gently, for it is precious, and will ever serve
to remind us of the First Maryland Regiment of Infantry,
C. S. A.

Lt. Col. JAMES R. HERBERT.

THE
SECOND MARYLAND INFANTRY.

CHAPTER I.

It was towards the close of October, 1862, that the
author made his way to Richmond, scarcely convalescent
from severe injuries received in the second
battle of Manassas. I reached that city in anything
but a comfortable frame of mind, for I was out of
the army owing to the disbanding of the First Maryland,
and my finances had run down to the last five
dollars. However, hoping something would turn
up, I registered my name at the Linwood, and determined
to quietly await the course of events.

The city was filled with officers in gay uniforms,
some just from the front, some who had never been
there, and never intended to go, others convalescing
from sickness or wounds, &c., &c. Altogether Richmond
presented a gay scene, and I thought I could
spend a few days there as pleasantly as elsewhere.
But I had no alternative, for it was out of the question

102
for me to yet think of carrying a musket in the
field.

A few days after my arrival, while walking up
Main street with a friend, I was approached by an
officer in a handsome uniform and handed a large
sealed envelope stamped âofficial business.â Judge
my surprise when upon opening it I found a commission
as First Lieutenant of infantry in the Provisional
Army of the Confederate States, with orders
to report to Colonel Shields at the Camp of Instruction.
This was a windfall, indeed, and with all my
heart I thanked the kind friend who had taken so
much interest in my behalf.

Some funds were now to be raised on the strength
of the commission to pay board bills, etc., and I
therefore directed my steps to the office of dear,
good old Major John Ambler, paymaster, upon
whom I had more than once before called when in
troubleâand what Marylander had not. They were
his especial favorites, and he would rather pay them
at the beginning than at the end of every month.

This little necessary piece of business attended to,
I proceeded to rub up my uniform preparatory to
paying my respects to Colonel Shields, at Camp Lee.
I found the Colonel a very pleasant gentleman, who
received me most cordially, and upon presenting my
papers I was assigned to my quarters with orders to
report next morning, when I would receive instructions.

In the morning I was on time. With a bland

103
smile the Colonel informed me that my duties would
be confined to superintending guard-mounting, instructing
the sentinels in their duties, and to organizing
into squads, to drill as many as possible of
the several thousand conscripts in camp.

I must confess this was putting it upon a sick man
pretty heavy, but I determined to do the best I could
for the present. Upon inquiring if I had any assistants,
I was told, âyes, Captain, Frank Schaffer,
but he isnât here much.â

I had never met Schaffer, but knew who he was,
so I started out to hunt him up. I soon found him,
and reported my orders. He laughed, and told me
not to trouble myself much about the conscripts,
âunless,â said he, âyou want to be driven as crazy
as a March hare.â

I soon found that he was right, for of all the
mean, filthy, ignorant, God-forsaken people it had
ever been my lot to encounter, these conscripts exceeded
all. You might drill them for hours without
making the least impression, and when at last exhausted
patience would draw forth language rather
strong and unmilitary, you were sure to hear something
like âI donât know nuthin âbout soldiern,
nor darned ef I keer âbout larnen, and jist say I
might go home, mister, anâ Iâm off.â

I soon found it utterly impossible to do anything
with them, and took the responsibility of directing
my attention to the lighter duty of mounting guard,
for I knew the commandant would never be the

104
wiser, as he seldom came out of his office except to
go home. As to looking after the camp it was
something he never thought of; indeed, never having
had any experience as a soldier, he scarcely
knew one end of a musket from the other.

My guard was composed of this conscript material
too, and a pretty guard it was. They thought nothing
of smoking their pipes when on duty, or halloaing
to their companions at a distance; they would
carry their muskets in all sorts of fashions, but generally
dragging it by the bayonet, and as to keeping
them on post when they felt hungry, that was out
of the question, although I punished many of them
severely for this breach of discipline.

One day I was making one of my usual rounds,
when I espied a sentinel in front of the officer of the
dayâs tent resting his arm and chin upon the muzzle
of his gun. When I approached he never moved,
but began to whistle a lively tune. I stopped directly
in front of him and asked âwhat he was
doing there?â

âWall, not much of anything,â he replied,
âlooking after that ar fellerâs things back thar, I
believe,â at the same time kicking back towards the
officerâs tent, and still in the same attitude.

âCome,â said I, âstraighten yourself up; have
you never been taught to salute your officers when
they approach?â

âNo I havenât, and I donât keer much about
larnin,â was his reply; âsay, mister, what did
that thar rig cost youâve got on?â

105
This was unbearable, and after using no gentle
force to straighten the fellow and make him shoulder
his musket, I set to work to instruct him
in the duties of a sentinel. After half an hourâs
hard work I left him thinking I had succeeded
pretty well. A short time after I had occasion to
return the same way in company with Captain
Schaffer, the officer of the day, to whom I related
what had occurred in front of his tent. He
laughed, and offered to lay a wager that he had
forgotten every word I had told him, which I readily
accepted. As we approached what was my chagrin
to find the fellow in exactly the same position I had
at first found him, nor did he move when we got
directly opposite to him. Again I asked him âwhat
he had been put there for?â As before, he answered
âto look after that thar fellerâs things back
thar,â accompanied with the old kick.

âHave you not been taught the duties of a sentinel,
sir?â I demanded in an angry tone.

âWall,â said he, without moving an inch, âthar
was a feller âround here a bit ago, who wor a tellin
of me somethinâ,
but I kinder believe he didnât know
any more about it than I do
.â

I troubled myself no more about that sentinel, the
reader can rest assured.

After having remained at Camp Lee some three
weeks, I determined to resign my commission, and
endeavor, if possible, to raise a company for the
field, for I had discovered that a good many young

106
men were coming over from Maryland about that
time to go into the army. I found it the most difficult
task I had ever undertaken, as most of them
preferred the cavalry or artillery to the infantry.
However, by great perseverance, and the aid of
Captain Richard Winder, about the 20th of December
I mustered into the service a company of eighty-five
as fine men as ever trod a battle-field. They
were principally from the lower counties, and well
behaved and intelligent men.

With the assistance and influence of Generals
Elzey and Winder, I was enabled to arm and equip
them well, which I could not have done otherwise,
for clothing and the improved arm were at that time
in much demand.

Having received my orders, on Sunday, the 30th
day of December, 1862, with Volandtâs band at the
head, I marched my company through the streets of
Richmond to the Virginia Central depot, where I
took the cars
en route
for the Valley of Virginia, to
join the First Maryland Battalion of Infantry, or as
it was afterwards called, to distinguish it from the
First Regiment, the Second Infantry.

I found it at New Market at daylight on the
morning of the 2d of January, upon the eve of
marching to Moorefield, on an expedition against
the enemy, along with the rest of Jonesâ command,
to which they were temporarily attached.

My men being wearied, I was directed to remain
behind and do provost duty until the return of the

107
expedition. It proved a fruitless one, and they returned
after a week of great suffering, having been
compelled on their march to break the ice and ford
the many rapid mountain streams between the two
places.

For the first time in a good many months I had
the pleasure of taking by the hand my old friend
and former companion in arms, Major James R.
Herbert. I also, to my great delight, found many
of the officers and men of the old First in the Battalion,
now numbering seven companies, and among
the former Captain Wm. H. Murray, Captain John
E. Howard, and Lieutenants George Thomas, Clapham
Murray, and Zollinger.

CHAPTER II.

The Second Maryland Infantry, which was destined
to take such a brilliant and conspicuous
part in the great rebellion, was formed and partially
organized in Richmond during the autumn of 1862.

To the exertions of Major Herbert, Captains William
H. Murray, Ferdinand Duvall, and other officers,
the Confederacy was mainly indebted for this
splendid command. As I have said, they but partially
organized in Richmond, and then proceeded to
Winchester, where the organization was perfected
and Captain Herbert elected Major.

108
Shortly after my company joined them, an order
was issued by General Jones directing that the officers
of the command should go into an election for
a Lieutenant-Colonel, it having more than the
requisite number of companies. Major Herbert was
chosen Lieutenant-Colonel. A short time after
Captain W. W. Goldsborough was promoted to the
Majority, when the organization stood as follows:

Lieutenant-Colonel, James R. Herbert; Major,
W. W. Goldsborough; Acting Adjutant, Lieutenant
George Thomas; Quartermaster, Major James
Hardin; Commissary, Captain John E. Howard;
Surgeon, Dewilton Snowden.

Company A.âCaptain, William H. Murray;
Lieutenants, George Thomas, Clapham Murray,
William B. Zollinger.

Company B.âCaptain, J. Perrin Crane; Lieutenants,
John H. Stone, Charles B. Wise, James
H. Wilson.

Company C.âCaptain, F. C. Duvall; Lieutenants,
Charles W. Hodges, Joseph W. Barber, Thomas H.
Tolson.

Company D.âCaptain, Joseph L. McAleer; Lieutenants,
James S. Franklin, J. T. Bussey, S. T.
McCullough.

Company E.âCaptain, John W. Torsch; Lieutenants,
William Broadfoot, W. R. Byus, James
P. Quinn.

Company F.âCaptain, A. J. Gwynn; Lieutenants,
Polk, John Hyland, and Forrest.

Maj. W. W. GOLDSBOROUGH.

109
Company G.âCaptain, Thomas R. Stewart;
Lieutenants, James Davis, W. H. Wrightson, G.
G. Guillette.

After the Moorefield trip the Second Maryland
spent the remainder of the winter in camp at
various points in the Valley of Virginia, first at
New Market, then near Edinburg, Lacyâs Springs,
Harrisonburg, and at Woodstock.

Nothing of importance occurred during that time
to disturb the monotony of camp life, except an
occasional alarm, or expedition after pig iron to the
furnaces in the vicinity of Edinburg. These expeditions
were facetiously called âJonesâ pig iron
raidsâ by the men, and which they, as well as the
officers, heartily detested, for it seemed as though
General Jones invariably selected a blinding snow
storm in which to make them.

It was in March, whilst encamped near Woodstock,
that one day a cavalry picket dashed into
camp and informed Colonel Herbert that a large
body of the enemyâs cavalry were advancing rapidly,
down the valley turnpike, and were within
three or four miles of us. The long roll was instantly
sounded, and although the men were all
engaged at one thing or another around the camp,
and the summons was totally unexpected, yet within
less than three minutes the column was formed and
on the move. Such was the state of efficiency our
able commander had brought his battalion to.

We marched rapidly up the turnpike until we had

110
passed Woodstock, three miles from our encampment,
and were within two miles of the enemy
before we were overtaken by the cavalry, under
command of Jones in person. He ordered us to
halt and form line of battle, whilst he pressed forward
to ascertain the number and character of the
Federal forces. In a short time we were startled by
a volley of small arms and the wild yell which we
knew too well came from our men in the charge. It
was not long before prisoners began to come to the
rear in large numbers, and we were assured that
it had been successful. The General had encountered
the Twelfth and Thirteenth Pennsylvania cavalry,
and at one charge, with an inferior force, scattered
them to the four winds, capturing, killing,
and wounding over three hundred of them.

Although the troops were without shelter the
whole winter, except such as they could erect out of
brush and leaves, there was scarcely any sickness,
and a hardier set of men I never saw. It was
demonstrated to our entire satisfaction that tents
were not fit for troops in winter, as the winter
before we had tried them for a while in the First
Maryland, and much more sickness prevailed.

It was some time in April, 1863, that General
Jones determined to make a raid upon the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad in the neighborhood of New
Creek and Cheat River. The Second Maryland was
to accompany the expedition as far as Moorefield,
between sixty and seventy miles distant, to bring

111
back the wagon train, which could accompany them
no further, and to gather up stores of every kind to
be found in that rich and fertile valley.

It was a lovely morning that we left our camp,
and although the roads were bad we made good
progress the first two days. On the third day, however,
the rain commenced to pour down in torrents.
It was a cold, sleety rain, and about as disagreeable
a one as it had ever been my misfortune to encounter.
On we pressed, though, fording rapid streams
waist deep and climbing immense ranges of mountains.
By three or four oâclock of the third day
we had reached the summit of the last range, at
the foot of which lay the beautiful town of Moorefield.
Suddenly the wind sprung up, the clouds and
mist disappeared, and away off in the distance lay
this magnificent valley, one of the most enchanting
spots in West Virginia. I was perfectly charmed,
and for a long while gazed upon the scene before me
in silent admiration.

That night we went into camp within two miles
of the town, and next morning moved a portion of
the command into the place, whilst the remainder
encamped upon its suburbs.

General Jones finding it impossible to cross the
river at Moorefield, moved up to Petersburg with
his cavalry, where a crossing was effected.

We were now left to ourselves, with instructions
to rest the men and horses, and then return to the
Valley of Virginia in the vicinity of Harrisonburg.

112
We had but little to fear from the enemy, who were
at Winchester, some seventy miles off. We therefore
took our own time about leaving, for we found
Moorefield a most delightful place, and the people
kind and hospitable. However, after a stay of three
days, we retraced our steps by the way of Franklin
to Harrisonburg, taking with us about one hundred
and fifty prisoners that General Jones had captured
after a sharp fight at Greenland Church, and also
some of our wounded, among whom was the gallant
Colonel Richard Dulaney, of the Seventh Virginia
Cavalry.

We reached Harrisonburg without an incident
worthy of note, and went into camp to await the
return of the expedition, which we did not expect
for at least a month.

CHAPTER III.

As we felt satisfied our stay at Harrisonburg would
be a prolonged one, and the weather being fine,
Col. Herbert set to work to make the Battalion as
efficient in drill and discipline as possible. He had
taken advantage of the winter, when the men could
not drill, to teach his officers their duties, and as
most of them were totally inexperienced they required
a great deal of instruction. By spring they
were familiar with Hardee, and that, with the little

113
training they had had in the fall, made them perfectly
competent to handle their respective companies
in company and battalion drill.

âTo equal the First Maryland in drill and discipline,â
I have heard Col. Herbert say, âis my
greatest ambition.â And he was gratified, and
more than gratified, for I think without
any
exception
the Second Maryland was the most perfect command
that was or had ever been in the Confederate
army. One great reason for it was that they had
been properly mustered in, and no misunderstanding
therefore existed as to the length of time they
were to serve, as had been the case in the First
Maryland.

Still another reason was that the officers, with
scarcely a single exception, were a remarkably
intelligent set of men, and took the greatest pride
in the battalion. With all the love and fond remembrance
I still cherish for the old First, I am compelled
to admit, in all candor, that the Second
was a superior command, and for the reasons I have
stated.

On the 22d of May General Jones returned from
his trip to West Virginia, which, taking everything
into consideration, proved a failure. It is true he
had destroyed a part of the railroad, but the damages
had been as quickly repaired. He had captured
horses, cattle and sheep in large numbers, and also
some prisoners; but then he had sacrificed some
valuable lives, and so completely broken down his

114
men and horses as to require a long season of rest
before again ready for the field.

A short time after his return the Second Maryland
and the Baltimore Light Artillery and First
Maryland Cavalry were ordered to Fisherâs Hill, to
relieve the gallant Major Sam Myers, who was stationed
there with a small force of cavalry. Soon
after our arrival we were joined by the lamented
General Albert G. Jenkins, with a splendid brigade
of Virginia cavalry.

Whilst at Fisherâs Hill it was determined by the
officers of the Maryland Line to select a commander,
it being then temporarily under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel James R. Herbert. By their
unanimous voice Colonel Bradley T. Johnson was
chosen, and Lieutenant Bussey dispatched to Richmond
to notify that officer of the fact. Colonel
Johnson was then a member of a military court,
much against his will, with the rank of Colonel of
cavalry, and he at once accepted the command, and
started for it next day, but did not reach it until
after the battle of Gettysburg (though he was in
the latter part of that engagement, acting as aid-de-camp
to General Ewell,) and upon looking into the
matter, and finding the battalion of infantry cut to
pieces, advised that the consolidation should be
postponed for the present, whilst he himself was
assigned to the temporary command of the Third
Virginia Brigade, the same he commanded with so
much distinction at the second battle of Manassas,

115
and first invasion of Maryland, and to which General
Jackson, before his death, had so long tried in
vain to have him permanently appointed.

During our short stay here nothing of moment
occurred with the exception of a slight skirmish in
the streets of Strasburg, in which Captain John W.
Torsch with three companies was engaged with a
regiment of the Federal cavalry. The enemy was
driven off with loss, and pursued beyond Middletown
by a portion of the First Maryland cavalry,
who were, however, unable to come up with them,
so precipitate was their flight.

On the 10th of June the whole command moved
down and went into temporary camp at Cedar
Creek. Whilst here a company of the First Maryland
cavalry, with a few of Jenkinsâ men, all under
the command of Captain W. I. Raisin, had the
misfortune to run into a Federal ambuscade, in
which he sustained a loss of four men killed, and
thirty wounded and captured, the gallant Raisin
being of the number, with a desperate wound in
the head.

On the afternoon of the 12th a dispatch arrived
announcing that General Ewell was at Front Royal
with his whole corps. Great was our surprise, for
we had little dreamed he was nearer than Fredericksburg.
What it meant we could not conjecture,
but that a movement was to be made on Winchester
was apparent to all.

Late that night a second dispatch arrived directing

116
Colonel Herbert with his infantry and the
Baltimore Light Artillery, (General Jenkins with
the cavalry had left that afternoon to join General
Ewell,) to move in the direction of Middletown
immediately and protect Ewellâs wagon train, which
had been ordered to that point.

The next morning, by order of General Ewell,
we moved up the Valley turnpike, somewhere along
which we were to await the arrival of General Early,
who was to strike the turnpike near Newtown. We
halted about two miles from Kearnstown, where
shortly after a second order arrived directing us to
halt at Newtown and there await Earlyâs approach.
It was too late, however, for we had passed that
place, and fearing the effects a retrograde movement
would have upon his raw troops, Col. Herbert determined
to take the responsibility of waiting for Early
where he was. In an hour or two that General
joined us with his division of infantry.

Our approach had by this time been discovered by
the enemy, for a regiment of cavalry was descried
in the road less than a mile in our front. A piece
of Griffinâs battery was now run up and masked by
a small party of horsemen, and a shell thrown into
the midst of the surprised cavalrymen, who scattered
in every direction. In a few minutes a battery
made its appearance upon a neighboring hill,
when a lively exchange of compliments took place
between it and the Baltimore Light Artillery.

Meanwhile Early was engaged getting his troops

117
into position. Three companies of the Second
Maryland, under the command of Major W. W.
Goldsborough, were thrown forward as skirmishers,
with orders to advance until the enemy were developed
in force. Griffinâs opponent had now retired,
and the whole command moved forward in line of
battle. In a little orchard, near Kearnstown, which
was flanked on the right by a strip of woods, the
skirmishers first encountered them, and a sharp
fight ensued. Steadily the Marylanders pressed
forward, and although subjected to a severe artillery
fire from a battery on a hill a short ways off, drove
the enemy before them.

General Early had in the meanwhile formed his
troops for a charge, and in a few minutes a yell on
our left announced it. It was Gordon with his
splendid brigade of Georgians. In beautiful order
they dashed forward and drove the enemy pell-mell
into Winchester.

That night (one never to be forgotten, for the rain
poured in torrents until morning) we held a position
at Hollingsworthâs Mills, but half a mile from Winchester.

At early dawn the rain ceased and the troops
were all on the alert. Shortly after sunrise the skirmish
line along the whole front got in motion and
approached to within two or three hundred yards of
the suburbs of the town. Here they halted for a
few minutes exchanging shots with the enemy,
when the Marylanders charged into the town, and

118
a lively skirmish ensued in the streets of Winchester.
Although opposed by a greatly superior force
they held their ground for some time until ordered
back by General Gordon.

Reluctantly they withdrew, the enemy following,
until they reached a stone fence about two hundred
yards from the town, when the fight was renewed,
and continued several hours, the enemy holding a
position in cemetery lot. This the Marylanders
finally drove them from with loss.

We afterwards ascertained that it was the Fifth
Maryland we had encountered, nearly the whole of
which was captured next day.

While this little affair was transpiring, Early was
placing his artillery in position and moving a column
of infantry (Haysâ Louisianians) in the rear of
the town to storm a strong fortification, the key to
the enemyâs works. About four oâclock the artillery
opened, and under cover of it the Louisianians
charged on the run, and in the time I am relating
it, had possession of the place; and when had they
ever failed in the assault?

Holding these relative positions, darkness came
upon the combatants, and we felt confident unless
Milroy retired during the night he would be
assaulted in the morning.

Having command of the skirmish line I was instructed
by General Ewell, who had come up that
morning with the main body of his corps, to keep a
watchful eye upon the enemy, and if I saw any

119
signs of his withdrawing from his works to report
the facts to him immediately. I therefore kept my
scouts in the town all night, who constantly reported
that everything indicated such a move, which
intelligence was communicated to the commanding
general, who hastened several brigades by a circuitous
route around to the rear of the town, and about
three miles distant, to intercept them should they
attempt to escape by way of the Martinsburg road.

Thus the night wore away, and at the first peep
of day, agreeable to orders, I put my skirmishers
in motion and entered the town. All was still as
death. Not an enemy was to be seen as I cautiously
moved along the deserted streets. Presently I met
a citizen, who in reply to my interrogatories told
me he thought Milroy had retired during the night.
To make sure he was not mistaken I ascended with
him to the upper story of his house, from whence I
could see into the main fort, and although the flag
seemed defiantly flying from the flag-staff I could
see it was deserted. I had scarcely regained the
street when the roar of artillery and the crash of
small arms some two or three miles up the Martinsburg
road confirmed my belief.

Pushing rapidly down the main street, I did not
halt until I reached the Taylor Hotel, where I encountered
a half dozen unarmed Federal soldiers,
who informed me their companions were all gone,
and they had been left behind to attend the sick and
wounded at the hotel, which had long before been

120
converted into a hospital. I immediately moved up
and took possession of the Star fort, where I found
about two hundred of the enemy who had preferred
to remain behind rather than follow the fortunes of
Milroy.

On looking around the fort I discovered twelve
splendid rifled pieces, which were but indifferently
spiked; the ammunition had been destroyed by
throwing it into a well.

The sound of battle had in the meanwhile ceased
up the road, and in a short time a long line of prisoners,
numbering over two thousand, made their
appearance, who had only surrendered after a desperate
fight.

During the whole day prisoners continued to
come in, until the number was much augmented,
and we had the satisfaction of knowing that the
miserable hordes under the brutal Milroy were
pretty much all in our hands, but to our chagrin
we found that the wretch we had so long wished to
lay our hands upon had escaped.

Such was the battle of Winchester, or rather one
of the battles of Winchester, and a complete surprise
it was, for not until the day after our first
attack at Kearnstown was Milroy induced to believe
it was a force of any magnitude that was in his
front.

We found the town full of stores of every description,
and our captures amounted to considerable, for
besides twenty pieces of artillery we captured several

121
hundred horses, an immense train of wagons, ambulances,
several thousand stand of small arms, &c.

The loss of the Second Maryland in this affair was
as follows:

Company A, Captain William H. Murray.âKilled,
none; wounded, Sergeant E. S. Dorsey, severely;
privates, Sommerville, Sollers, slightly;
John Wilson, slightly.

Company B, Captain J. P. Crane.âKilled, none;
wounded, privates J. E. Joy, mortally; H. Corry,
slightly; William Herbert, slightly.

Company C, Captain Ferdinand Duvall.âKilled,
none; wounded, Captain F. Duvall, severely.

Company D, Captain Joseph L. McAleer.âKilled,
none; wounded, private John Devres, mortally.

Company E, Captain John W. Torsch.âKilled,
none; wounded, Lieutenant W. K. Byus, slightly;
captured, Lieutenant Joseph P. Quinn.

Total, 9 wounded and 1 captured.

CHAPTER IV.

The morning after the battle of Winchester the
command was temporarily attached to the brigade
of General George H. Steuart (composed of
Virginians and North Carolinians,) of Edward
Johnsonâs division, and shortly after the whole of

122
Ewellâs corps took up its line of March in the direction
of Smithfield, where we arrived about dark, and
went into camp for the night.

The next morning we resumed the march, our
course shaped towards the Potomac, which there
seemed but little doubt we were destined to cross,
but with what object in view we had not the slightest
conception. We crossed the Baltimore and
Ohio railroad at Kearneysville, and then took
the road leading to Shepherdstown. The day
was intensely hot and the troops marched leisurely.
By midday we went into camp about three miles from
the river that separated us from our own beloved
Maryland, and which we cherished a fond hope of
crossing on the morrow.

It was whilst we lay here that I took advantage
of the time afforded to pay a visit to the estimable
family of the Hon. Alexander H. Boteler, whose
beautiful residence was but a mile from our camp.
I found Mrs. Boteler at home with her two accomplished
and attractive daughters, and they vied with
each other in their endeavors to make my visit an
agreeable one.

Mrs. Boteler informed me that they had been subjected
to all sorts of annoyances from the Yankee
soldiery, and taking me to her chamber pointed out
a bullet hole through a pane of glass in the window
which had been fired by a thing in uniform whilst
she was looking out into the yard, the ball passing
through her hair and lodging in the ceiling.

123
It was late in the evening, and with many regrets,
that I left this lovely family and their little paradise,
and wended my way back to camp. Alas, all
that is now left of that once sweet, happy home is
a mass of ruins, for the brutal and relentless Hunter
visited it soon afterwards and burnt it to the
ground.

On the afternoon of the 18th of June we broke
camp and moved up the road leading to Shepherdstown,
through which village we passed amid the
joyous shouts of the inhabitants, and were in a few
minutes upon the banks of the Potomac, into which
the men plunged waist deep, and began make their
way to the longed-for shore. I wished I possessed
the pencil of the artist to paint that scene, for it
was one that will never be forgotten by those who
witnessed it.

Upon reaching the Maryland shore the joy of her
exiled sons baffled description. They shouted and
screamed, and rolled upon the ground in the delirium
of their joy, and to one not acquainted with the cause
it would have seemed as though bedlam had been let
loose, and in this Pandemonium I must confess our
gallant brigade and battalion commanders played a
conspicuous part, leaving out others of minor rank.

That night we encamped upon the banks of the
river, and next morning passed through the town
of Sharpsburg and halted upon the famous battle
field.

After remaining in camp here three or four days,

124
we moved on towards Hagerstown, which place we
passed through, and encamped a short distance
beyond.

By many of the citizens of Hagerstown we were
heartily received; others again scowled fiercely upon
us, and no doubt wished every rebel son of us to the
devil.

On the morning of the 23d of June we left our
camp near Hagerstown, and crossed the Pennsylvania
line, and passed through Greencastle, where
Steuartâs brigade was detached from the division
and ordered to proceed to Chambersburg by way of
Mercersburg, McConnelsburg, &c., and we arrived
on the evening of the 26th without an incident
worth mentioning.

After crossing the Pennsylvania line, the most
prejudiced observer could not help being struck with
the perfect discipline that pervaded the entire army.
There was not a single straggler to be seen upon the
road, for under no circumstances was a man suffered
to leave the ranks, except when at a halt, which was
ten minutes in every hour, and then he was limited to
one hundred yards from his command. There was
no running about the country pillaging and robbing
and burning; no defenceless women insulted and
outraged, as had been the case hundreds of times in
our own country when invaded by the hireling
hordes of Yankeedom. Oh, no, the army of Gen.
Lee was composed of different material and was
commanded by a Christian soldier, who held such

125
hellish acts, and the instigators of them, in abhorrence.

On the morning of the 27th we passed through
Chambersburg and took the turnpike to Carlisle,
and on the afternoon of the 28th of June the worn
and wearied division went into camp a short distance
to the right of the road, and about three miles
distant from that town. The day had been excessively
warm, and our march a long and tedious one,
but stimulated with the hope of soon having in our
possession the capitol of the great Keystone State,
and proud to know we were invading the enemyâs
country, not a complaint was heard nor a straggler
to be found.

The order to âbreak ranksâ had been obeyed
with alacrity; and as the dusk of evening came on
hundreds of fires could be seen throughout the
woods at which the hungry troops were busily
engaged cooking their meat and boiling their coffee.
A night of refreshing sleep followed the repast, and
at reveille every man was promptly at his post, and
prepared, nay impatient, to resume the march to
Harrisburg, which town we cherished the fond hope
of reaching that day.

But hour after hour sped by and no order to
âpack upâ was given. What could it mean?
For days we had taken up the line of march at sunrise.
Twelve oâclock, and no order. One, two, three
oâclock, and an aid was observed to dash up to brigade
headquarters, and in a few minutes the welcome

126
command to âfall inâ was heard throughout the
vast encampment.

All was bustle and excitement, and many were
the speculations indulged in by both officers and
men, as the companies formed, as to the cause of
our delay and our probable destination that day.

âIt is my impression,â observed one, âwe will
go no farther than Carlisle, where Rhodes is encamped,
join him, and make the attack upon
Crouchâs forces about midday to-morrow.â

âThere is where you are mistaken,â was the
reply of a comrade. âYou see the different corps
and divisions have been marching on converging
roads. Well, we are almost up with Rhodes, and
our delay of a day was evidently occasioned by
Ewellâs being ahead of time. Now mark me, we
will make a forced march to-night and begin the
attack at daybreak in the morning. General Lee
can spare no more time, in my humble opinion.
Already he has lost too much, and the next thing
we know, Hooker will be at our heels, and between
him and Crouch we will have a devil of a hot time
of it.â

Entertaining such opinions pretty generally,
great was the surprise of all to observe the head of
the column, upon reaching the turnpike, file abruptly
to the left instead of the right, and we found
ourselves retracing the steps of the day before.

Disappointment and chagrin was depicted in
every countenance as we silently wended our weary

127
way. The boisterous, merry shout of the past few
days was no longer to be heard; and the troops did
not move with that elasticity of step in the retreat
(as we termed it) which had characterized their advance,
for officers and men had alike become
impressed with the belief that some disaster had
befallen us, and we were a second time to recross
the Potomac.

After a march of twelve miles the command went
into
bivouac
near the village of Springfield. The
eveningâs meal was moodily discussed, and all went
sulkily to sleep.

The reveille of the following morning was not as
cheerfully responded to as before; and shortly after
taking up our line of march the barefooted (and
there were hundreds of them) who, with cracked
and bleeding feet had borne the advance march so
cheerfully, now began to murmur and complain.

During the dayâs march we met about two
hundred paroled Federal soldiers who had been
captured a day or two before by General J. E. B.
Stuartâs cavalry, and ordered to proceed to Carlisle.
They were hundred days men, called out by the
Governor of Pennsylvania, to repel the invaders of
their sacred soil, and had been but a few days in
the field. As they passed our bronzed and weather-beaten
gray jackets the contrast was striking indeed.
The one clothed in new and well-fitting
uniforms, the other in rags, and shoeless. Many
were the wistful glances directed at their well-cased

128
feet by Steuartâs men, but they passed us without
molestation. Not so, however, with the Stonewall
Brigade, which was immediately in our wake. The
temptation was too great for their commander,
General Walker, to resist, and halting the young
heroes of a single skirmish, he addressed them
pretty much as follows:

âI would judge from your appearance, young
gentlemen, you have not been long in the service,
and while we have been blistering our feet on your
devilish turnpikes, you have been enjoying the
pleasures and comforts of home. Your term of
service has now expired; return there and remain,
for I tell you soldiering is both a disagreeable and a
precarious occupation. But before you goâand
you have but a short distance ere you meet your
friends, and we, God knows, how far without meeting
oneâI think it but fair we should make an
exchange in the way of boots. What say you?â

A hearty burst of laughter was the response at,
to them, so novel an idea, and in an instant every
pair of shoes was âshedâ in army parlance, and
tendered to our barefooted soldiers.

It was quite amusing to see the poor fellows move
off, picking their way daintily over the rough and
uneven turnpike; and from the gait we left them
âadvancing on Carlisle,â I much question whether
they reached their destination inside of several
days.

Another incident similar in its character occurred

129
an hour or two after in the Second Maryland. A
gallant young non-commissioned officer of Captain
William H. Murrayâs company, came to me and
presented for my inspection what
had
been a pair of
shoes, but were now minus the soles. His feet were
in a shocking condition, and he expressed a fear that
he would be unable to proceed much farther, unless
I could supply him, or grant him permission to
âforageâ for a pair. Being curious to see how he
would proceed about it, âI spreck nottings mit
mine mouf, but I spreck like ter tivel mit mine
looks,â as the Dutchman would say; and going
upon the old adage that âsilence gives consent,â
the Sergeant quietly resumed his place in the ranks.
But a little while elapsed, however, before I observed
him gradually fall to the rear of the column; and
as he neared me, he pointed significantly to a fat
old farmer who was lazily leaning on a gate-post,
intently watching the passage of the troops. I aver
I did not wink at the Sergeant, but he afterwards
persistently maintained that I did. Be that as it
may he stepped up to the old fellow, and bantered
him for a trade. Now the Dutchman could scarcely
speak a word of English, and the Sergeant not a
word of Dutch and after vainly endeavoring to make
him understand his Saxon, had no alternative but
to trade
sans ceremoni
. So, throwing off his âuppers,â
he in the most artistic manner stooped down
raised one foot, and in an instant the Teuton stood
âone boot off and one boot on.â The fellow followed,

130
the Pennsylvanian never moving a muscle
or budging an inch, but watching the strange proceeding
in utter amazement. After admiring the
âfitâ for a moment, the audacious rebel politely
bid the old gentleman âgood day,â and rejoined
his command, congratulating himself no doubt upon
the excellent exchange he had made. As we passed
out of sight I turned in my saddle and cast a look
behind. There he still stood, gazing after us, as if
transfixed to the spot, and no doubt soliloquizing,
âVen tat tam fellow prings mine poots pack.â

CHAPTER V.

The afternoon of the 30th of June found the
advance at the little town of Greenvillage, six
miles from Chambersburg, where we filed to the left
and took a country road, as we supposed, in search
of suitable ground on which to encamp for the
night. At length we halted in a beautiful field,
close by which there was wood and water in abundance.

An hour or two after our arrival, Lieut. Col. Herbert
and myself visited brigade headquarters for the
purpose of learning, if possible, the reason for the
retrograde movement, and the probabilities of our
returning to Virginia without a fight.

131
We found the General agreeable and affable as
usual, and with him the gallant Colonels Warren,
Walton, and Parsley, of the brigade. They were
discussing the very subjects upon which we wished
so much to gain some information, and we listened
attentively.

Walton seemed much annoyed, and in his blunt
and earnest manner expressed great disappointment
at the result so far of the second invasion of the
enemyâs country.

âI am as much in the dark as any of you, gentlemen,â
said the General; âbut I do not agree
with you in the supposition that we are to recross
the Potomac without a great battle. The result of
that battle will determine our future movements.
We will pursue this road on the morrow, most
assuredly, but where this road will lead us to is a
question I cannot solve. Hill and Longstreet are
in advance of us; Rhodes is, or was, at Carlisle;
Early is supposed to be in the neighborhood of York;
and that we are converging toward some given point
is very evident, but of the whereabouts of that point
I am totally ignorant.â

In my youth I had more than once travelled
almost every road in York, Adams, and Franklin
counties, and was therefore familiar with them all.
From the Generalâs remarks it instantly flashed
across my mind that we were about to move on
Baltimore and Washington. That I had discovered
the designs of General Lee I did not doubt for a

132
moment, and looking wondrous wise during the rest
of the conference, I determined to keep my own counsel
until the next morning, when I would surprise
my brother officers by unfolding to them what I was
confident must be the reason for this countermarch.
How near I was to the truth the reader will see.

The dawn of the first day of July broke bright
and beautiful; and, as I watched the glorious sun
rise majestically in the cloudless sky, I little thought
its decline would inaugurate one of the most dreadful
battles of the century, and usher into eternity
the souls of hundreds of my fellow-men, who die
engaged in deadly strife.

At seven oâclock the march was resumed; and
when it became apparent we were not yet to seek
Virginiaâs sod, a spirit of enthusiasm diffused itself
throughout the command which could hardly be controlled.
Poor fellows, little did they then think a few
hours more would see thousands of them stretched
stark and stiff, and wounded and dying upon the
gory field of Gettysburg.

âCaptain Murray, I will lay you a wager,â was
my exclamation as I rode to the side of that gallant
young officer. âI will wager you my last ten in
Confederate currency that we will see Washingtonâs
Monument in Baltimore in so many days. Come, do
you take the bet?â

Raising his eyes, he looked at me with an expression
which seemed to say as plain as he could speak,
âAre you jesting, or are you a fool?â and then
broke out into a hearty laugh.

133
âIf I did not know you and the Colonel were at
headquarters last evening, I would be inclined to
believe you had partaken of some of the proceeds of
Commissary John Howardâs successful raid of yesterday,â
he replied.

âBut I do not know anything of Captain Howardâs
raid or what he captured,â I somewhat petulantly
rejoined, for I did not like the idea of my
great secret being treated with such indifference;
âand I moreover assure you I am altogether in
earnest. Now listen, and I will convince you I am
right: You know that Longstreet and Hill are in
advance of us, and I will inform you that Rhodes
has left Carlisle, and Early is at York. Well, from
York there is a turnpike to Baltimore, as you are
aware. Early will take that road and operate upon
the line of the Northern Central Railroad. There
are two fine turnpikes also from Gettysburg (whither
we are going, as this road can lead us nowhere else,)
to Baltimore, the one passing through Littlestown,
Westminster, &c., the other by the way of Hanover
and Manchester to Reisterstown, sixteen miles from
the city, where the two meet. Rhodes will join us
at Gettysburg, and the whole army, with the exception
of Early, will take these parallel turnpikes and
reach Reisterstown simultaneously, for the distance
is the same. Rest assured all this marching and
countermarching was for the purpose of misleading
Hooker; and now that General Lee has him out of
the way, he intends to slip into Baltimore and Washington
before he can discover his error.â

134
I believe my reasoning made some impression;
but not being of so sanguine a temperament as
myself, he was far from being fully convinced.
How far right and how far wrong I was in my conjectures
the sequel proved. It was not my first
attempt to penetrate the designs of my commander-in-chief,
but I determined it should be my last.

After a rapid march of a few hours the column
reached the town of Fayetteville, through which
we passed without a halt. Shortly after, the troops
of Longstreetâs corps were encountered, quietly
cooking their rations in a wood close by the roadside.
These veteransâscarcely a man of whom did
not carry the scars of some hard fought fieldâsuspended
their labors and closely scrutinized us as we
passed by. How it made my heart thrill with pleasurable
emotions as I heard the compliments they
bestowed with no sparing hand upon the splendid
command to which I had the honor of belonging.
By the tap of the drum they moved like machinery,
and with that quick, nervous step and precision for
which they were so justly celebrated throughout the
entire army.

âLook out for your laurels, Fourth Texas,â I
heard an officer exclaim in that regiment of imperishable
renown, âfor if I mistake not there goes a
little battalion that will give you a tug for your
next wreath.â And similar remarks were heard
on every side.

On we pressed, and rapidly neared the town of

135
Gettysburg. But eight miles more, and we will
encamp for the night upon its outskirts.

But what means this commotion ahead? Something
is out, most assuredly.  The order passes
along the line to âMove up, men, move up.â

âDr. Snowden,â I remarked to the surgeon of
the battalion, who was riding by my side, âI have
imagined for some minutes that I heard the sound
of artillery ahead, and from the confusion among
the staff officers I am half convinced I did.â

âI was about to remark the same,â the Doctor
replied. âThere it is again, and there, and there,â
he continued, as so many sounds of artillery were
distinctly heard. âBut here comes the Colonel,
perhaps he can enlighten us.â

As Colonel Herbert approached I could see from
his manner that something was wrong. Addressing
me, he said:

âYou will keep your men well up, sir; no straggling
under any circumstances. There is serious
work going on ahead, and it is likely we will be
into it in less than three hours. The orders are to
press forward with all dispatch.â

The words were overheard by some of the men,
and the news ran through the battalion like wild
fire. One prolonged yell announced it to the other
regiments and brigades, and for a minute the welkin
fairly rung with their joyous shouts. More distinct
at every step became the roar of artillery, and we
knew from the incessant discharges that the fight
was a fierce one.

136
I must confess I was puzzled, completely nonplussed.
Who had dreamed of the enemy being in
that quarter? I will venture to say not an officer
of the army outside the corps commanders, and perhaps
their respective staffs. And I do not believe
they, or even General Lee himself, expected forty-eight
hours previous to encounter him there. A
dreadful blunder somewhere, but where I will leave
it for the historian to tell.

âHow about that nice little trip to Baltimore and
Washington, and those parallel turnpikes, now,â
said Captain Murray addressing me. âAh, that
was a beautifully arranged affair, I must confess;
but there seems to be obstacles in the way of its
fulfillment.â

âAnd the ten dollars,â chimed in Torsch. âIt
will buy a pint of Monegahaly, as the people hereabouts
call it. Yes, weâll take that ten when we
reach Gettysburg. We will, wonât we, Cap?â

I acknowledged my plans had miscarried, which
was all owing to the enemyâs getting betwixt us
and Washingtonâs monument; but that I was still
somewhat inclined to believe it was only a small
force of the enemy who had stumbled upon our advance.
And this belief seemed to be strengthened
as we neared the battle-field, for the discharges of
artillery were not now near so rapid as they had
been an hour or two before.

About two miles from Gettysburg we passed a
farm house by the roadside, which had been converted

137
into a hospital and filled with our wounded,
as was also the yard. A little farther on a great
many ambulances were encountered, well freighted
with torn and bleeding men, and directly a long
line of the more slightly wounded, all making their
way to the rear in search of surgical aid. From
these we learned the fight had been a desperate one,
and the casualties numerous on both sides; but
that we had been successful at every point. A little
farther and we filed to the left to avoid attracting
the fire of the enemyâs artillery, which was still
being served, but slowly.

Passing a large field, in which were several
thousand Federal prisoners, we were directly upon
the battle ground. The evidences here gave most
unmistakable testimony of a stubbornly-contested
battle, as the ground was covered with the deadâblue
and gray side by side. In and around the
railroad cut dug by Thad. Stevens many years since,
the slaughter of the Federal troops was appalling.
They literally lay in heaps, whilst our loss at this
point appeared comparatively small.

We here learned that portions of Ewellâs and
Hillâs corps had encountered a heavy force under
General Reynolds, and that he himself was among
the killed. Our own loss had been by no means
slight. Besides a large number in killed and
wounded, General James Archer and almost his
entire brigade had been made prisoners.

It was nearly dark when we entered the town;

138
and, halting in one of the streets to await orders,
the troops stretched themselves upon the ground to
rest their weary limbs. Having some acquaintances
in the place, and feeling rather hungered, I suggested
to Colonel Herbert that we should go up to
Willâs hotel, where I thought we could procure
some refreshments; but upon reaching the place
we found it closed and apparently deserted. Returning,
I met a gentleman whom I had known in former
yearsâMr. Henry Stahle, editor and proprietor
of a Democratic paper thereâand we entered into
conversation upon topics entirely foreign to the
war. A crowd of gaping citizens soon surrounded
us, and imagining Mr. Stahle was hatching treason,
forthwith reported him to the authorities. Now, as
Mr. Stahle had been suspected of being a copperhead
for some time, owing to the manly and independent
tone of his paper, his being seen in company with a
rebel officer was proof positive, and when our forces
fell back he was handed over to the tender mercies
of General Morris, of Fort McHenry notoriety. I
trust the reader will excuse this little digression, but
I thought the incident worth mentioning.

About nine oâclock we received orders to âforward,â
and, passing through the town, struck the
York turnpike, which was pursued for a mile, when
we filed to the right and marched across the open
country until we neared the Hanover road, when
the command âon right by file into lineâ was
given, (for we had been marching right in front,)

139
and the Second Maryland Infantry took its place in
the line of battle, where so many of the noble spirits
who composed it were to bleed and die in the dreadful
conflict about to ensue.

CHAPTER VI.

That night the troops slept upon their arms,
prepared to resume hostilities or repel an attack
at a momentâs notice. Colonel Herbert and myself
selected a spot somewhat retired from the main body,
and, after picketing the horses, laid ourselves down
to sleep. To sleep, did I say? To rest I should
have said, for it was many hours ere I closed my
eyes in sleep. A thousand recollections of the past
presented themselves. I thought of home and the
loved ones there; of many incidents attending the
two eventful years of carnage and bloodshed through
which I had been spared where so many died. Truly
God had been merciful, and I offered up a silent
prayer that I might survive the fight of the coming
morrow. And then I thought of the hundreds around
me who were taking their last sleep save that which
knows no waking; of those in dream, dreaming
of their once happy homes, of wives and children,
of fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and sweethearts,
but to awake in the morning only to the
dread reality.

140
At early dawn I arose from my blanket hungry
and unrefreshed. The Colonel appeared in the
same condition, for after rubbing his eyes and looking
around him for a minute he broke forth with:

âWhy in the devil didnât you think of making
old man Sheeley give you some of the cooked provisions
out of the mess chest? Now the wagons
are the Lord knows where, and here we are sucking
our thumbs to appease hunger. I can go twenty-four
hours without eating, but darned if I like it
to be an hour over that time.â

âAnd pray, sir, why didnât
you
ask Mr. Sheeley
for some of the provisions in the mess chest?â I
inquired.

âBecause I didnât think of it.â

âAnd neither did I; but if you will promise to
say nothing more about Sheeley and the mess chest
I will introduce you to a little private arrangement
of my own.â

The Colonel looked up inquiringly for a moment,
and although he said nothing, I could plainly read
in his countenance âOh do.â

At the battle of Winchester, some weeks previous,
I secured a number of large sized boxes of sardines,
all of which I had given away, save one. This I
had in my saddle pocket, along with a small flask
of brandy that I procured as we passed through
Greenvillage. I had kept it a secret, for on the
march you have plenty of visitors if you are known
to possess a flask of liquor. Here was an emergency,

141
however, and it was for an emergency I had
saved it. The flask and sardines were speedily produced,
and for the first time in twenty-four hours I
saw the Colonel smile. And then he took the cork out
of the flask, threw back his head and
smiled
again,
and, as he lowered the uplifted arm, I discovered
considerable daylight through the bottle he had
smiled at. Ahem, like master like man, and I followed
his example. Then the sardines were discussed,
and we grew amiably disposed, and we talked
and talked aboutâeverybody and everything but
Sheeley and his mess chest.

The morning wore away and there were no evidences
of a renewal of hostilities. About ten
oâclock, General Johnson requested me to make a
reconnoissance from a hill about three-quarters of a
mile in our front. Being perfectly familiar with
the country, having hunted over almost every foot
of it in my youth, I put spurs to my gallant sorrel,
and, making a detour to the right, I after a few
minutes rapid riding reached its summit. Here
screened from the enemyâs view by an undergrowth
of cherry trees, I witnessed a sight I shall ever
remember. In front of me, distant about half a
mile, was the long ridge leading to cemetery
heights, and then cemetery heights themselves.
This ridge and the heights were crowned with innumerable
batteries of artillery, and immediately in
rear of them a long dark mass of infantry, their
bayonets glittering in the sun. I was on the ridge

142
which separated the contending armies, and never
before upon the eve of battle was I so struck with
the advantages one army had over the other in point
of position, save at Fredericksburg. In fact the
thing was about reversed except in the numbers of
assailants. It was almost impossible for us to find
position for a single battery on our left or in our
centre. The spot upon which I stood was the only
one in front of Johnson, and a battery could hardly
live here an hour, as was demonstrated that day.
For at least twenty minutes I gazed upon the opposite
heights, where all seemed life and animation,
and then turned my horseâs head and galloped back
to where I had left the General, and to whom I
made my report. As the coast was clear, in company
with Major Latimer, his chief of artillery, he
proceeded to the hill, and shortly after ordered
up two batteries of artillery, one the Chesapeake
artillery, under command of the lamented Captain
Brown, of Baltimore.

During the afternoon Colonel Herbert proposed
we should visit General Walker, of the Stonewall
Brigade, which was in position a short distance to
our left, and if possible procure something to eat,
as we were suffering very much from hunger, having
partaken of no food except the sardines since
the morning of the day before. We found the
General in pretty much the same predicament, but
his Adjutant-General very kindly furnished us with
two biscuits apiece, which were thankfully accepted.

143
In the course of the conversation which ensued,
mutual surprise was expressed that the attack had
not been renewed.

âHowever,â said Walker, âit is not too late;
and I think it possible it will yet be made before
nightfall.â

Now these late-in-the-evening fights are the most
disagreeable things imaginable, as will readily be
conceded by all who have participated in them, and
I sincerely hoped the Generalâs prediction would not
be verified. In the first place, you are as liable to
shoot and be shot by friend as by foe. Moreover,
the inextricable confusion inevitable is unpleasant,
for you are more likely to get into the enemyâs lines
than keep in your own, and I saw many instances
of it that night.

While we were conversing, some of the pickets
brought in a prisoner, an ill-favored, brutal looking
Dutchman, who had been pounced upon while out
foraging. The fellow appeared relieved at the idea
of escaping the fight, for drawing a long breath he
said:

âIch been feel mooch besser; I like not mooch
fight.â

Upon our inquiring why Hooker had been superceded
by Meade, he replied:

âVat for he let der Lee in Pennsylvany coom?â

The prisoner could not or would not give us any
information upon many points we questioned him.
He only knew that he belonged to a âPennsylvanyâ

144
regiment in the âOonanâ army. So much
and no more could his intelligent mind comprehend.

âIt is too bad,â exclaimed âWalker, rather excitedly,
âto think that such men as we have around
us should be butchered by the miserable mercenary
devils of which this is a fair specimen. Sometimes
I am half inclined to show the wretches no quarter.
Take the creature to the rear.â

Expressing a mutual wish that fortune would
favor us in the coming fight, we separated, not to
meet again for many months.

Soon after reaching the battalion Capt. W. H. Murray,
of whom I have before spoken in this narrative
and of whom I have yet to speak, joined us. He was
one of my dearest friends, and his was a friendship
I was proud to boast. With Colonel Herbert we
had started out early in â61 as privates in the First
Maryland; arose to the rank of Captain almost
simultaneously; first saw fighting at the battle of
Manassas; and had together participated in most
of the battles fought by the Army of Northern
Virginia from that time to this. A thorough disciplinarian,
brave as a lion, calm and collected amid
the roar of artillery, the rattle of musketry, and the
carnage of battle, I regarded him as one of the very
best officers I ever saw. By his men he was almost
idolized, whilst by the battalion he was universally
beloved. The companies he commanded in the
First and Second Infantry were model ones, and I
question whether throughout the whole Confederate

145
Army two such could have been found. As an evidence
of their discipline and fighting qualities, and
the tenacity and desperation with which they stood
to their work at Gettysburg, I would state that out
of ninety-eight men that he took into the fight, but
thirty-one reported after the battle.

âAnything to be done to-day?â was his inquiry
as he took a seat by our side.

âGeneral Walker seems to think so,â was Col.
Herbertâs response; âbut his opinion is based upon
no positive information. This long silence betokens
a dreadful battle when it does commence, and I am
getting tired of the suspense. By-the-by, Captain,
now you know perfectly well that I am not at all
superstitious, but Iâll be hanged if I havnât a presentment
that I am to be hit in this affair. You
and myself have escaped so far without a scratch,
but we wonât this time, mark my words. With G.
there it has become so common a thing that nothing
else is to be expected.â

âAnd for that very reason I shall escape,â said I.
âYou know the old saying that âit is a long lane
that has no turning;â well I think I am around the
bend, whilst you two have not yet commenced
the trip.â

âThere it comes,â exclaimed Murray, suddenly
springing to his feet as the sound of a single piece
of artillery was wafted to us on the eveningâs breeze
from away down to our right. âAnd there, and

146
there, and there!â as three more distinct discharges
were heard.

For a moment all was still as death. Not a sound
to break the same quiet that had preceded the four
explosions. It was but a moment, however, for
these were Leeâs signal guns to commence the battle,
and the thunder of two hundred pieces of artillery
burst forth from our lines. The enemy replied
with as many more, and the earth shook and trembled
as though riven by an earthquake. The air
was filled with exploding, crashing, screaming
shells. âLay down!â is the command, and every
man was flat on his face.

Perhaps nothing in battle is so trying to an infantrymanâs
nerves and patience as the preliminary
artillery fire that precedes it; and the same effect
is produced upon the artilleryman by the whistle
of the minnie ball; although the destruction of
human life by musketry is at least five hundred
per cent. greater than by artillery; and an old
soldier will contend a battle has not fairly begun
until he hears the rattle of small arms, when he
will exclaim to the recruit: âNow somebody is getting
hurt; all this thunder was only for its effects.â

The brigade on our right being in a more direct
line with the shots fired at the batteries of Latimer on
the hill in front, begin to suffer severely, and the litter
bearers are busily engaged carrying off the wounded.
Latimer is working his guns savagely, but is being
terribly handled, for three times his number of guns

147
are concentrated upon the two little batteries, rending
and tearing him to pieces. Caisson after caisson
shoot high up in the air as they are exploded by the
enemyâs shells.

âHe canât stand that pounding much longer,â
remarked the Colonel; âand for all the execution
he is doing I wish General Johnson would order
him away. Here comes a litter from that direction
with a wounded man. Let us see who it is.â

Approaching the sufferer we were shocked to
behold the familiar features of the chivalrous Captain
Wm. Brown, of the Chesapeake Artillery.
His face was pale as death, and although both legs
had been horribly shattered by a cannon ball, he
smiled as he recognized us. Turning to Captain
Torsch, he said in a weak voice:

âCaptain, if you should get home, tell my poor
old father I died endeavoring to do my duty.â

âWe are making out badly up there,â said one
of the litter bearers. âMajor Latimer has been
carried from the field mortally wounded; and if
kept on that hill much longer more of us will be
likely to follow him!â

For at least two hours this awful fire continued
without a momentâs cessation, when aids were seen
dashing furiously down the long line of infantry on
our right, who spring to their feet as they pass, and
were at once in motion.

âMount your horse quickly,â said the Colonel,
âfor we are going in;â and the next instant, in a

148
clear, distinct voice, heard even above the din of
battle, he gave the command, âForward, guide
centre!â and the gallant sons of Maryland commenced
their march to defeat and death.

Preceded by a cloud of skirmishers, steadily the
long line in grey advanced across the Hanover road,
and entered the woods before them. We found the
ground here very uneven, and covered with immense
rocks, which necessitated the dismounting of field
and staff officers, and the horses were sent to the rear.
We passed over more than a mile of this country
before our skirmishers encountered those of the
enemy upon the banks of Rock creek. A sharp
fight ensued, but our gallant fellows dashed across
the creek, which was waist deep, and put them to
flight. The order was then given by some one for
the skirmishers to join the main body. The disastrous
consequences that followed this order will be
presently seen.

We were rapidly approaching Culpâs Hill through
one of the densest woods I ever passed. Darkness
was upon us, and nothing could be seen save the
flash of an occasional musket in our front. More
and more difficult became the ascent, but over every
obstacle pressed the devoted division. Not a shot
was now heard, and the woods seemed inhabited
but by ourselves. What has become of the enemy?
In an instant the question is answered, as the
heavens are lighted up by the flash of thousands of
muskets, and the deadly Minnie tear and rend our

149
ranks fearfully. The column reeled and staggered
like a drunken man. To add to the horrors of the
situation, a fire was also opened upon us in rear by
a body of our own troops, who receiving some of
the bullets that escaped us mistook us for the
enemy. Men fell like autumn leaves; but the
brave fellows disdained to retreat. The enemyâs
fire was returned, though with little effect, as they
were protected by their breastworks. No command
could be heard above the infernal din. What was
to be done? To stand there was certain death, and
therefore, why not sell our lives dearly as possible?
At this moment the heroic Walton approached me
and asked âwhat on earth shall we do?â

âAs I am not in command of the battalion, I can
do nothing,â was my reply.

âWell, I shanât wait for orders any longer, but
will charge the works if I lose every man in my
regiment. Take the responsibility and charge with
your left at the same time.â

âIâll do it,â was my response, and hastily
detaching the companies of Captains Torsch, Stewart
and Crane, with Walton, dashed at the breastworks,
cleared them in a moment, with the loss of
but three men, and instantly wheeling to the right
opened a destructive, enfilading fire upon the enemy
who still remained in the breastworks, which
compelled them to fall back to Culpâs Hill.

On our right Nichollâs brigade of Louisianians
had not been so successful, and there the fight still

150
raged. The enemy here held a stronger position,
and could not be dislodged.

As the firing in our front had ceased temporarily,
I took advantage of it to go in search of Colonel
Herbert, from whom I wanted further orders, and
to whom I wished to report my situation. Upon
reaching the right of the battalion, however, I was
grieved to learn, through Lieutenant George
Thomas, that the gallant Colonel had been pierced
at the first fire by no less than three balls, and
carried from the field in a supposed dying condition.

Sending for the commanders of companies, with
the view to ascertain their respective losses, I was
shocked at the reports made by them. Nearly one
hundred men had fallen in the Second Maryland
alone, and at least three hundred in the brigade,
during those few dreadful minutes.

As Captain Murray had the right of the battalion
by seniority, I directed him, for the present, to take
command of that wing whilst I looked after the
important position I had taken at right angles with
him after we had carried the enemyâs breastworks,
and to inform General Steuart, if he should see him,
where I was, and how I was situated. I had scarcely
returned, when the enemy opened again with increased
fury, but as the brigade was now sheltered
behind the log breastworks and immense rocks that
covered the hill, their fire did but little execution.
The men were directed to fire at the flash from their

151
muskets, and from the shouts of âstop that firing,
you are shooting your own men,â I was convinced
it was with effect. They must have been new
troops, ordered from another point, as they did not
seem to be aware of the change that had taken
place in their front. Many came into our lines
to remonstrate with us, and found themselves
prisoners.

An incident of this kind occurred here, which,
under different circumstances, would have afforded
some amusement. Captain Torsch, of Company E,
whose gallantry had been conspicuous during the
evening, whilst urging his men to fire as rapidly as
possible, was approached by a Federal officer and
peremptorily ordered to cease. The Captain had
received no instructions to obey officers in blue uniforms,
and he therefore declared âheâd be dâd if
he would,â and seizing the astonished âlover of
the Unionâ by the throat, dragged him into my
presence, and demanded in an excited manner that
I should âgive him the devil for coming inside our
lines and interfering with him in the discharge of
his duties.â The fellow was dreadfully scared, and
begged piteously to be sent to the rear, as he âdid
not wish to be shot by his own men.â

Another, somewhat similar, occurred shortly after,
in which the author was a party. Whilst directing
the firing, I was approached by an officer on horseback,
and asked how âthe fight was going?â I
saw his mistake directly, and telling him I did not

152
know, walked towards his horseâs head to take him
by the bridle. As I did so his suspicions must have
been aroused, for he inquired âWhat corps is this?â
âA Rebel corps, sir, and you are my prisoner!â I
exclaimed, presenting a pistol to his breast. With
perfect self-possession he dismounted, and unbuckling
his belt handed it to me with sword and pistol
attached, playfully remarking as he did so, âTake
them, sir, they are yours, and fairly won.â He
proved to be Lieutenant Egbert, a staff officer, who
in carrying a dispatch had become lost in the
darkness.

By ten oâclock the firing had ceased, and the men
rested upon their arms, prepared to repel an attack
at an instantâs warning. The officers were required
to remain awake during the night, and a vigilant
line of pickets kept a watchful eye in the direction
of the enemy, who were but fifty yards distant.
They were also on the alert, as we were assured by
an occasional volley of musketry.

During the whole night artillery and wagons
could be heard rumbling along the Gettysburg turnpike,
and as the sound seemed to recede we thought
the enemy might be retreating. Generals Johnson
and Steuart were attentive listeners, and I heard
Johnson express such a belief. I sincerely hoped it
might prove true, for I was sickened at the prospects
before us.

153

CHAPTER VII.

The long wished for day at length began to
appear, and at early dawn the troops were
awakened from their slumbers to renew if necessary
the dreadful struggle. In vain I peered through
the misty light for a glimpse of the enemy, but
none could be seen. They had certainly retreated
under cover of night, and we were right in our conjectures;
and now for a pursuit in the direction of
Baltimore. But even as I thus anticipated the
pleasures in store for us, of the prospect of once
more seeing home and loved ones there, I was startled
by a terrible volley of musketry in our front,
whilst simultaneously several pieces of artillery
opened upon the flank of the three companies I had
thrown across the breastworks the previous evening,
and I was compelled to hastily withdraw them and
seek the cover of this our only protection. The fire
was awful, and the whole hillside seemed enveloped
in a blaze, although it was but occasionally we
could catch sight of an enemy. The trees were
riddled, and the balls could be heard to strike the
breastworks like hailstones upon the roof tops. The
fire was returned as best we could, but it was almost
certain death to expose any vital part of the body;
and many were killed and wounded by reckless
exposure of person.

The right of the battalion, where were stationed

154
companies A and C, under the command of Captain
Murray and Lieutenant Charles Hodges respectively,
were exposed to the severest part of the fire, and
suffered in greater proportion than the others.
Until nearly eight oâclock this dreadful storm of
bullets continued to sweep over and around us without
the slightest abatement. All along our line
wounded men were lying bleeding to death, as it
was impossible to remove them to the surgeonâs
quarters after they were struck. Feeling anxious
to know how the right fared, I cautiously made my
way there, and sheltered myself behind a rock where
were Colonel Parseley and Captain Murray. I
inquired of Parseley if he had suffered much.

âVery much indeed. I have but thirteen men
left. And now I have but twelve!â he exclaimed
in the same breath, as one of his men fell over dead
in Captain Murrayâs lap, shot through the head.

I heard the words but imperfectly, for the same
ball struck me full in the forehead and knocked me
almost senseless; but its force was spent, and an
ugly bump was the only result.

âTake care there, Sergeant Blackistone, you are
exposing yourself too much,â I shortly after remarked
to the orderly of Company A, and even as
I spoke a ball passed through his arm, lacerating it
badly. Poor fellow, it was his first and last
wound, for he died shortly after in the hospital at
Frederick, where he was held a prisoner.

âMy men are out of ammunition, sir,â said

155
Captain Murray; âand with your permission, I will
withdraw them to the cover of those rocks on the
left for half an hourâor a less time should you
need meâand get some water and replenish their
cartridge boxes. I have suffered fearfully, sir, and
the men are somewhat dispirited.â

I suggested it would be a dangerous undertaking,
but with great caution the point might be made.

Gradually they worked their way down the line,
and reached the shelter in safety, and another company
was ordered to take their place.

As I returned, the commanders of companies
informed me that their ammunition was also exhausted.
The difficulty was to get it, as none was
within half a mile, and it was almost certain death
to leave the shelter of the breastworks. I reported
the matter, however, to General Steuart, whom I
found sitting with his staff behind an immense
rock, and he told me I had better call for volunteers.

âGeneral, do not ask one of your officers or privates
to volunteer to perform this duty whilst you
have a staff officer left. I will bring the ammunition,
if I live!â

Words that should be written in letters of gold,
and they fell from the lips of Lieutenant Randolph
McKim, one of the Generalâs aids. The noble
fellow made the venture, and succeeded in his
mission.

It was about half an hour after the above, that

156
Captain George Williamson (Adjutant-General of
the brigade, and one of the bravest men that ever
trod a battle-field,) directed me to move my command
by the left flank, file to the right at a given
point, and form line of battle under cover of a
woods, and as close as possible to its edge, without
attracting the attention of the enemy, and that the
rest of the brigade would form on my right and
left.

I divined the object of the move instantly, and told
the Captain âI considered it murder, and therefore
would take my men in under protest.â

âThe General has expressed the same opinion,
sir; but the order comes from one higher than he,
and is peremptory,â was his reply.

Sending for Captain Murray to join the command,
the devoted little brigadeâalready reduced to about
nine hundred menâmade their way slowly, sometimes
crawling, to the spot where they were to be
senselessly slaughtered. Nine hundred brave men
to storm a mountain, and upon whose sides bristled
the bayonets of ten thousand foemen, and artillery
innumerable. Some oneâs hands are stained with
the blood of these gallant men, and God will mete
out fearful retribution in the world to come.

We were now within less than two hundred yards
of the enemy, with an open field in front, over
which we were to charge.

âCaptain Murray, you will take command of the
right,â were my last words to one of the noblest of
men.

157
Slowly I moved down the column, with feelings
I had never before experienced on the battle-field,
for I felt I had but a minute more to live; and as I
gazed into the faces of both officers and men, I could
see the same feeling expressed, for all were alike
aware of their danger. But no cowardâs glance met
mine. There was no craven in those ranks.
They

had sneaked to the rear the day before. But the
compressed lip, the stern brow, the glittering eye,
told that those before me would fight to the last.
Reaching my post, I looked up the line, and there
stood the brave Steuart, calmly waiting for the
troops to get in position.

âFix bayonets,â was the command, quietly
given; and the last act in this bloody drama was
about to be enacted. It was a dreadful moment.
But one brief second of life yet left! The sword
of the General is raised on high! âForward,
double-quick!â rings out in clarion tones, and the
race to meet death commenced. The fated brigade
emerged from the woods into the open plain, and
hereâoh God! what a fire greeted us, and the
death-shriek rends the air on every side! But on
the gallant survivors pressed, closing up the dreadful
gaps as fast as they were made. At this
moment I felt a violent shock, and found myself
instantly stretched upon the ground. I had experienced
the feeling before, and knew what it meant,
but to save me I could not tell where I was struck.
In the excitement I felt not the pain; and resting

158
upon my elbow, anxiously watched that struggling
column. Column, did I say? A column no longer,
but the torn and shattered fragments of one. But
flesh and blood could not live in such a fire; and a
handful of survivors of what had been a little more
than twelve hours before the pride and boast of
the army, sought to reach the cover of the woods.

But that merciless storm of bullets pursued them,
and many more were stricken down. Among those
who escaped, with a slight wound, was Adjutant
Winder Laird, who, as he passed where I lay, caught
me up and carried me to the shelter of the woods.

Faint and sick from the loss of blood, I fell into
a stupor, from which I was aroused by the voice of
Lieutenant Thomas Tolson.

âCan I do anything for you sir?â he kindly
inquired.

âTell Captain Murray to take command of what
remains of the battalion,â I directed.

âAlas, sir, Captain Murray has fought his last
fight; he fell dead, close to my side, late in the
charge,â he answered.

Colonel Herbertâs prophecy was fulfilled.

The command of the battalion now devolved upon
Captain Crane, who, with little difficulty, rallied
the survivors, and from the breastworks we had
occupied, still maintained the fight. Borne back
at length, by overwhelming numbers, this little
band of heroes sullenly retired, stubbornly contesting
every foot of ground until they reached Rock
creek, where they took a stand, from which the
utmost efforts of the enemy failed to dislodge them.

Capt. WM. H. MURRAY.

159
Darkness put an end to the conflict, and the
exhausted troops threw themselves upon the ground
to snatch a few momentsâ sleep. But human endurance
was yet to be taxed to a greater degree before
allowed to seek that rest and repose it so much
needed, for that night General Lee had determined
to retire from Gettysburg, and recross the Potomac.

Such was the part taken by the Second Maryland
in the great and bloody battle of Gettysburg, and
although it brought mourning and sorrow into
many families in that glorious old State, still it had
better a thousand times been that than the blush
of shame for a sonâs recreancy.

The casualties were frightful indeed; and it
became necessary to leave the severely wounded in
the hands of the enemy, among the number Colonel
Herbert, Major Goldsborough, Lieutenant Joseph
Barber, (who died a few days after) and Lieutenant
Wilson. Captains Stewart and Gwynn, and Lieutenants
Thomas, Tolson and Broadfoot, although
severely wounded, succeeded in getting away, the
latter, however, died at Martinsburg soon after

CHAPTER VIII.

During the latter part of the night of the 3d,
and all day of the 4th, the weary and dispirited
troops of Lee retraced their steps. There was no
confusion, no disorganization, for, except the
depleted ranks, the army was as intact as when it
marched over the same road but a few hours before,
on their way, as they believed, to certain victory.
But how different must have been the feelings of all
as they looked around and missed the familiar forms
and features of their comrades now still in death or
prisoners in the hands of the enemy, thousands of
them wounded and dying. To add to their wretchedness
the rain commenced to fall in torrents shortly
after they began their retrograde movement, and
continued the whole of the next day, making the
marching very fatiguing and the roads almost
impassible for the wagon trains.

Steadily they retired, followed by the army of
Meade at a respectful distance. In fact it was a
mere show of following that was demanded by the
people of the North after what they believed to have
been a great victory.

âDo not let the army of Lee escape you,â was
more than once telegraphed to the Federal General.
But that officer knew better than all others the
shattered and disorganized condition of his own
army, and the certain destruction that awaited him

165
should he venture an attack. To follow, then, to
quiet the clamorings of the people and the officials
at Washington, was all he pretended to do. Had
this not been the case he would have gladly taken
up the gage of battle so defiantly thrown down to
him by General Lee at Hagerstown, and where he
suffered him to remain until the Confederate Commander,
tired of waiting, again resumed his march
by the same slow stages towards the Potomac.

On the 14th of July, Steuartâs brigade recrossed
the river at Williamsport, and took up the line of
march in the direction of Martinsburg, after an
absence from Virginiaâs soil of just twenty-six days,
of which eleven were spent in Pennsylvania and
fifteen in Maryland.

Passing through Martinsburg, destroying the
railroad at and near that place, the command went
into camp near Darksville, where it was determined
to rest and recruit the tired troops for a few days.

On the 22d Johnsonâs division broke camp near
Darksville and proceeded to Winchester, where it
arrived that evening after a fatiguing dayâs march.

Next morning rumors prevailed that the enemy
were crossing at Snickerâs Gap, and the troops
were hurried forward to check, and if possible drive
them back. They were found in no force, however,
and after a little artillery practice they retired.

Passing through Front Royal and Luray, and
crossing the mountains at Thompsonâs Gap, on the
28th of July they took the road leading to Madison

166
Court House, and passing through that once beautiful
village, marched for Orange Court House, via
Gordonsville, crossing the Rapidan at Liberty Mills,
and arriving at their place of destination on the even
of August 1st.

The division was destined to remain here some
time, and the incidents attending its stay, and many
of the subsequent movements of the Second Maryland,
I will give the reader in the form of a diary.

Friday, September 6th.âUp to this date but little
of interest has transpired since our arrival, August
1st. The troops have greatly recovered their spirits
since the disastrous invasion of Pennsylvania, and
are eager to again meet the enemy. We are now
thoroughly organized, and although our regiments
and brigades do not number as many men as they
did three months ago, still we have a large and
efficient army. To-day, at five oâclock, P. M., we
were called upon to witness a sad, sad scene, in the
execution of ten men in the Third North Carolina,
of our Brigade. Their crime was desertion, and that
under peculiar circumstances. They were men of
families, and intelligence had reached them that
their wives and little ones were in want. Unable
to resist the appeal, these poor fellows started off
without leave to succor them if possible. But,
unfortunately, they took their arms with them.
An officer of their regiment (Adjutant Mallett) was
sent to bring them back, and was killed. They
were apprehended, tried by court-martial, and sentenced

167
to death. All that it was possible to do was
done by their friends to save them, but in vain; and
these brave men, who had proved their devotion to
the cause in which they had embarked on many a
bloody field, were at last to die by the hands of
their comrades. The execution took place upon the
brigade drill ground, and was witnessed by the
whole division, which was drawn up so as to form
three sides of a square. The doomed men evinced
the greatest firmness when pinioned to the stakes,
and died like the brave men they were. At the
first fire all fell dead but one, and it was necessary
to discharge three shots into his body before life
was extinct. It was indeed a sad, sickening sight.

September 11th.âTo-day we had a grand review
of Ewellâs Second Army Corps, by General Lee,
who expressed himself highly pleased.

September 19th.âThis morning the whole of
Johnsonâs division moved in the direction of Fredericksburg,
and halted, after a march of twenty
miles, at Mitchellâs Ford, on the Rapidan, where
we formed line of battle, in anticipation of an
attack from the enemy, as several small parties of
Federal troops could be seen in the distance. The
command remained here until the 8th of October,
inviting an attack, without being gratified, when
the division returned to within five miles of Orange
Court House.

October 9th.âThis is a cold, frosty morning, and
at daylight we moved towards Madison Court

168
House, and encamped within four miles of the
place.

October 10th.âWe were awakened at five oâclock,
and moved at six, passing to the right of Madison
Court House, and shortly after forded Robinsonâs
River, where our cavalry had a skirmish, capturing
about one hundred of the enemy. After crossing
the river, we moved in the direction of Culpepper
Court House, and encamped within eight miles of
it. During the evening heavy cannonading was
heard in our front, and it seemed as though a fight
was imminent, as it was well known Meade, with his
whole army, were not far off.

October 11th.âThe column moved at early dawn,
and, marching slowly, went into camp in the
vicinity of Culpepper Court House. During our
march we saw evidences, on every side, of Yankee
vandalism. Whole fields of corn had been wantonly
destroyed, and the citizens complained bitterly
of the treatment they had received.

October 12th.âWe were aroused at two oâclock
in the morning, but did not move until half-past
six, when we continued the road to Culpepper, passing
a great many deserted camps, which gave every
evidence that the enemy had abandoned them in
haste. Leaving Culpepper to the right, the command
soon after forded Hazel River, and struck the
Warrenton turnpike at Jeffersontown.

From this place to the Rappahannock, a distance
of three miles, a sharp skirmish ensued, the enemy

169
retiring. In this affair quite a number of prisoners
were captured. At dark we crossed the river, and
took up our quarters in a deserted camp.

October 13th.âThe column moved at sunrise,
taking the Warrenton pike, and passed through
what was once the beautiful Warrenton Springs,
though now nothing but a mass of ruins. From
thence our route lay through the village of Warrenton,
six miles distant, and near which we encamped
for the night. It is now pretty generally believed
a fight will not take place this side of Manassas,
twenty-two miles distant, as the enemy are rapidly
falling back.

October 14th.âWe moved at sunrise, taking the
road to Manassas. The cannonading was heavy
during the entire day. After marching sixteen
miles the division went into camp about five miles
from the old battle-field.

October 16th.âEarly in the morning the brigade
moved to the front and formed line of battle at
Bristowâs Station. A sharp artillery fight soon
after commenced which was very destructive to the
horses, though fortunately the men escaped with a
few slight wounds.

We remained in this vicinity two days, busily
engaged destroying the railroad, when we turned
our faces towards the Rappahannock, marching
parallel with the road, and crossed over a temporary
bridge on the 19th.

October 26th.âThe division moved at 7 A. M.

170
and recrossed the Rappahannock and advanced to
Bealton Station, where it formed line of battle.

October 27th.âAll quiet save a little skirmishing
between the cavalry and artillery. To-day at
dress parade the long-looked for order was read
detaching the battalion from the brigade, and transferring
it to the command of Colonel Bradley T.
Johnson, who had been ordered by General Lee to
assemble the Maryland Line, and picket the line on
his flank from the White House to New Kent Court
House, and protect his communications with Richmond,
with his Headquarters at Hanover Junction,
where the North and South Anna rivers were of
vital importance to him.

On the 2d of November the battalion took the
cars at Brandy Station and arrived at the Junction
next day.

Although the men had endured such great privations
in the long and arduous campaign of the summer,
they left the front with regret; but they were
still anxious to see the Maryland Line assembled
once more, and to be with their old friends and companions.
In the Line every man felt a deep interest
and took a just pride, and it was hoped that
should they be again united they would never be
separated. It was not from any feelings of dislike
to General Steuart that they openly expressed this
preference, but that the General could not be induced
to believe, and for sometime before their departure he
had been exceedingly arbitrary in his treatment of

171
them, which did engender a dislike, and therefore
the order to leave was hailed with delight.

The author has forgotten to mention, and will
here give it but a passing notice, that whilst
encamped at Orange Court House, the battalion was
augmented by an eighth company, from Richmond,
under the command of one Captain C. C. Callan.
They were not Marylanders, but a set of worthless
men, with a few exceptions, who had been taken
out of the military prisons there. It was contrary
to the wishes of the officers and men of the Second
Maryland that they were assigned to that command,
and the matter, for a time, excited no little feeling.
However, they were not long troubled with Captain
Callan, who was dismissed the service, whereupon
most of the men deserted. The few who remained
were still designated a company, and by their choice
Lieutenant Bussey, of Company D, became their
Captain.

CHAPTER IX.

In a short time after the arrival of the infantry,
Colonel Johnson had assembled the whole of the
Maryland Line at the Junction, and immediately
proceeded to establish his lines and erect winter
quarters.

172
The beautiful situation selected was soon cleared,
trees were felled, and in a little while villages were
reared that would have done credit to more experienced
builders.

After having done everything possible to contribute
to their bodily comfort for the winter, they
turned their attention to something of a spiritual
nature, and soon, under the direction of their
âfighting parson,â the Reverend Mr. Cameron, a
neat and substantial little chapel graced the
grounds.

The winter, and away into spring, was passed here
most pleasantly, and was one ever to be remembered.
Scarcely a week went by but the camp was
enlivened by the appearance of throngs of lady
acquaintances from Richmond and the surrounding
country, and by the management of that most estimable
of women, Mrs. Bradley Johnson, parties,
concerts, and balls were frequently gotten up.
These were largely attended, and for the time the
cares and privations of the field were forgotten.
And then on the Sabbath day it was truly an interesting
sight to see the gallant fellows escorting the
fair damsels of the neighborhood to their little
church to listen to the word of God.

But things cannot always be as we would wish,
for about the first of March, 1864, the peace and
quiet of their camp was invaded by a rumor that
the Yankee cavalry under Kilpatrick was coming
down upon them. Instant preparations were made

173
to give them a reception. The infantry was not
brought into requisition, but taking the cavalry
and two pieces of artillery Colonels Johnson and
Brown harrassed them for days, a detailed account
of which will be found in the operations of the
cavalry.

After the raid of Kilpatrick everything went on
as before, and weeks glided by in this delightful
place almost imperceptibly.

About the 10th of May, by General Order No.
38, A. I. G. Office, General Arnold Elzey was
ordered to Staunton to recruit and receive transferred
Marylanders from other commands, and it
was for a time hoped that the Maryland Line would
be much increased in numbers, and in the future kept
intact. But in this they were disappointed, for the
men, now accustomed to their officers, and having
made their associations where they were, preferred
to remain. But few were, therefore, added to the
little command. This failure to increase the numbers
of the Line necessitated the distribution of the
several commands to other bodies, and never after
did they operate together. Colonel Johnson was
ordered to the command of a cavalry brigade in
Earlyâs army in the Valley, and took the cavalry
with him. The artillery was also ordered to report
to Early soon after the battle of Cold Harbor, whilst
the infantry was assigned to Breckinridge, as will
be seen.

On the 27th of April winter quarters were broken

174
up, and the troops left the little village in which
they had spent so many happy hours with regret.

The campaign of the year was now about to be
inaugurated, and they were to change the quiet and
(in this instance) pleasures of the camp for the
perils and privations of the field.

After a short march the battalion went into temporary
quarters a little distance southwest from the
Junction, on the old telegraph road.

After remaining here until the 23d of May, most
of the time engaged in guarding the various railroad
bridges in the vicinity, the Second Maryland
was ordered to Hanover Court House, there to await
orders from General Breckinridge.

On the 26th, by order of that General, it joined
his division, when the whole moved down the telegraph
road and halted within ten miles of Richmond.

On the 28th the march was resumed as far as
Atlas Station, where next morning slight skirmishing
ensued, in which the enemy were repulsed.

On the morning of the 30th they opened a heavy
artillery fire upon Breckinridgeâs command, which
was as vigorously responded to, and kept up until
the evening of the 31st, the battalion sustaining a
loss of but one man wounded.

June 2d.âIn the early part of to-night the division
moved in the direction of Gainesâ Mills by way of
Mechanicsville, passing on the road many destitute
families fleeing from the neighborhood. There were

175
a large number of children among them who were
suffering terribly from hunger, and their appeals to
the rough soldiers for a mouthful of food was distressing
indeed. These shared their dayâs rations
with them, and they eagerly devoured the coarse
bacon raw.

In the afternoon the division of Breckinridge
reached the farm of Dr. Gaines, and took its position
in line of battle, which was upon the same ground
held by the Federals in the memorable engagement
of the 27th of June, 1862. The Second Maryland
was here held in reserve, to support Echolsâ brigade
of Virginians, and formed line about one hundred
yards in rear of the main body.

The skirmishing was very heavy during the afternoon
and evening, and the enemy made repeated
attempts to charge the Confederate lines, but the
utmost efforts of their officers failed to induce the
troops to leave the shelter of the woods in which
they were posted.

During the night the lines were strengthened by
the arrival of Wilcoxâs and Finneganâs brigades,
which also formed in reserve.

June 3d.âTo-day is memorable in the history of
the glorious little Second Maryland, for they this
day won honors of which every Marylander may be
justly proud, and wrung from the great Lee, in his
official report, a compliment which will live forever
on the pages of history.

At the break of day the command was hastily

176
aroused from its slumbers by the loud peals of
cannon and the rattle of small arms. Springing to
their feet, what was their surprise to behold that
part of the line of battle in their immediate front
precipitately retreating, and abandoning their works,
and the artillery there stationed, to the enemy, who
were swarming over the breastworks. But an
instant was, however, left for reflection. Another
moment and their own artillery, double shotted with
canister, would be turned upon them, and their
destruction was inevitable, and, perhaps, the destruction
of the whole division. And then and there
they did what few troops had ever done before.
Almost spontaneously (for in the confusion and
noise no command could be heard) they rushed upon
the overwhelming masses of the Federal infantry
with the bayonet, and wrested the guns from their
hands just as they were about to belch forth death
and destruction to all who stood in their way. A
most desperate and sanguinary hand-to-hand struggle
then ensued, in which the bayonet and the short
swords of the officers were used with dreadful
effect, and it can be said to be one of the few
instances of the kind in the history of battles. The
enemy did not long withstand this mad attack, but
fled over the breastworks and sought the cover of
the line of works from which they had just emerged,
falling by hundreds at every step, from the fire of
the recaptured artillery and the deadly minnie that
relentlessly pursued them. Again and again they

177
advanced, but right upon the heels of the Maryland
boys had followed Finnegan, with his Floridians,
and the utmost efforts of the heavy Federal columns
failed to make the least impression, and the
result was, that the whole ground in front was strewn
with the dead and wounded of the enemy, and at
the close of the sanguinary battle of Cold Harbor
Breckinridge remained master of his position, with
several hundred prisoners in his possession, captured
in the headlong charge of the Marylanders.

The fight was not yet ended when the glorious
Breckinridge, who had witnessed it all, dashed up,
and, with tears of gratitude streaming down his
classic face, extolled their conduct and thanked them
for what they had done; and even as he did so he
came near falling a victim to his own generous
impulses, for a cannon shot struck his noble charger
full in the breast, and horse and rider fell heavily
to the ground. Except a few bruises, however, the
General escaped unhurt.

Here is what âa Virginianâ says, in the Richmond

Sentinel
, of the part taken by the Marylanders
in this great battle:

Near Richmond
, June 6th, 1864.

Mr. Editor
âThe public have already been informed, through
the columns of the public journals, of the general results of the
late engagements between the forces of General Lee and General
Grant. But they have not yet learned the particulars, which are
always most interesting, and in some instances, owing to the confusion
which generally attends large battles, they have been misinformed
on some points. It is now known by the public that
the enemy were momentarily successful in one of their assaults

178
on the lines held by Major General Breckinridgeâs division, which
might have resulted in disaster to our cause.

It will be interesting to all to know what turned disaster into
victory, and converted a triumphant column into a flying rabble.
The successful assault of the enemy was made under cover of
darkness, before the morning star had been hid by the light of the
sun. They came gallantly forward in spite of a severe fire from
General Echolsâ brigade, and in spite of the loss of many of
their men, who fell like autumn leaves, until the ground was
almost blue and red with their uniforms and their blood. They
rushed in heavy mass over our breastworks. Our men, confused
by the suddenness of the charge, and borne down by the rush of the
enemy, retreated, and all now seemed to be lost. At this juncture
the Second Maryland Infantry, of Colonel Bradley T. Johnsonâs
command, now in charge of Captain J. P. Crane, were roused
from their sleep. Springing to their arms they formed in a
moment, and rushing gallantry forward, poured a deadly fire into
the enemy and then charged bayonet. The enemy were, in turn,
surprised at the suddenness and vim of this assault. They gave
backâthey became confused; and General Finneganâs forces coming
up, they took to flight; but not until nearly a hundred men
were stretched on the plain, from the fire of the Second Maryland
Infantry, and many others captured. Lieutenant Charles B.
Wise, of Company B, now took possession of the guns, which had
been abandoned by our forces, and with the assistance of some of
his own men and some of General Finneganâs command, poured a
deadly fire into the retreating column of the enemy.

Thus was the tide of battle turned, and this disaster converted
into a success. I am informed that the whole force of the enemy
which came within our lines would have been captured, had it
not been for the mistake of an officer who took the enemy for our
own men, and thus checked for a few moments the charge of the
Second Maryland Infantry. I take pleasure in narrating these
deeds of our Maryland brethren, and doubt not you will join in
the feeling.

A Virginian.

In this affair the battalion suffered a loss of
between thirty and forty men killed and wounded,
as follows:

Not long after the battle of Cold Harbor, much
to their regret the Second Maryland was transferred
temporarily to Walkerâs brigade, I say much to
their regret, for General Breckinridge had won the
heart of every man of the command.

Their stay with Walker was short, and they
were assigned to Archerâs brigade of Hethâs division.
[3]

With this command they were destined to see
much heavy fighting around Petersburg, where the
Confederate army entrenched itself soon after the
bloody battle of the 3d of June.

. General Archer was soon after taken sick and died, when
General McComb assumed command.

On the 13th of June a severe fight occurred at
White Oak Swamp, in which the Confederates
gained a signal success. The loss of the Second
Maryland in this affair was as follows:

Company A.âKilled, private John G. Wagner.

Company C.âKilled, private Lewis H. Viet.

Company G.âKilled, private William H. Calhoun.

181
After the fight at White Oak Swamp the command
was set to work, along with the rest of the
army, building breastworks and entrenching themselves
in their position. In this they were much
annoyed by the enemyâs sharpshooters and artillery,
and many casualties occurred. Up to the 25th of
August the loss of the Second Maryland was as
follows:

Company H.âWounded, Captain John J. Ward,
severely, June 26th; private John Parker, slightly,
August 9th.

Company G.âWounded, privates Thomas Brannock,
slightly, June 26th; James Abbott, severely,
August 12th; George Langford, severely, August
25th.

Company C.âWounded, private Richard T.
Anderson, severely, August 12th.

CHAPTER X.

On the 18th of August the Confederates in heavy
force, under Mahone, made a desperate attempt
to dislodge the Federals from a strong position at
Reamâs Station, on the Weldon railroad. The
battle was a terrific one, and the Confederate General
gained a complete victory, driving the Federals
before him with heavy loss in killed, wounded, and
prisoners.

182
He was attacked in turn next day by a large force,
and after making a brave and determined stand,
was compelled to fall back, leaving the enemy in
possession of the road.

The loss on both sides was dreadful; and here
again the Second Maryland proved of what material
it was made. Disdaining to retreat without the command,
when all others were seeking safety in flight,
they stood to their post to the last. Again and
again were they assaulted, but again and again
they drove their assailants back with heavy loss.
At length in overwhelming numbers the enemy
came upon them and reached the breastworks. But
there that little band remained for a time as firm as
the rocks of Gibraltar. But the enemy crossed the
breastworks, and the struggle was hand to hand.
Desperately the bayonet was thrust, and the butts of
muskets crushed through human skulls. But this
unequal struggle could not be of long duration,
and surrounded and overwhelmed, the survivors
sought to fight their way out. Many succeeded, but
one-third of that gallant band lay dead and wounded,
or were prisoners in the hands of the foe.

Many were the noble spirits who fell, and among
the number the brave and chivalrous Adjutant J.
Winder Laird. The author had served with him
in the First, and then in the Second Maryland, in
both of which, by his kind and affable disposition,
he had won the love of his companions; and but a

183
short time before his death he had been promoted to
the rank of Adjutant, as an evidence of their esteem.
Gentle as a woman in his daily intercourse with men,
upon the battle-field his whole nature underwent a
change. Ever foremost in the fight, his splendid
figure towering above his companions, with eyes
flashing, nostrils dilated, and his features all animating,
he became as fierce as an unchained lion, and by
his reckless exposure of person and daring courage
made himself the target for many a bullet. Here
at Reamâs Station, in the full tide of victory, and
whilst cheering his men on in the pursuit, he was
struck in the forehead and fell dead without a groan.
Alas, the fatal bullet that pierced the brain of Winder
Laird went straight to the heart of a fond,
doting mother, who did not long survive the death
of her darling, and they now rest side by side in
the little churchyard at Cambridge, Md.

The following is the loss sustained by the battalion

CHAPTER XI.

On the 30th of September Hethâs division again
encountered the enemy at Pegramâs farm. It
was a desperate engagement, in which the Confederate
arms gained a decided victory. As in every
preceding battle, the Second Maryland took a conspicuous
part and covered itself with glory, but
losing fearfully in killed and wounded. Out of one
hundred and forty-nine men that went into the fight
forty-three were killed and wounded, as follows:

Battle of Pegramâs Farm, Captain Ferdinand
Duvall commanding.âWounded, Captain Ferdinand

Corporal Patrick Heenan; wounded,
private Edward Welch, severely.

On the next day, October 1st, 1864, they again
encountered the enemy on the Squirrel Level Road,
and repulsed them after a sharp engagement. The
loss of the Marylanders in this affair was as follows:

Battle of Squirrel Level Road, Captain John W.
Torsch commanding.

188
Company A, Sergeant Charles E. Maguire, commanding.âWounded,
private William T. Bailey,
severely.

Company B, Second Lieutenant Charles B. Wise,
commanding.âWounded, private Wm. Herbert,
mortally.

Company C, Corporal C. M. Clayton commanding.âWounded,
privates John W. Blumendeur,
severely; Charles Hammond, severely; Frank
Wheatley, mortally.

Company D, Sergeant Isaac Sherwood, commanding.âWounded,
Sergeant Isaac Sherwood, severely.

Company E, Sergeant Samuel Kirk commanding.âWounded,
privates John Brown, severely; Wm.
Gwynn, slightly.

Company F, Sergeant John W. Polk commanding.âWounded,
Charles A. Hoge, mortally.

Company H.âWounded, private James Powers,
slightly.

For a long while after the battle of Squirrel
Level Road, the Second Maryland remained in the
trenches, or were engaged in picketing along their
front. It had been reduced to about one hundred
men, and still these men were compelled to do the
duty of a battalion. So numerous were the desertions
in the brigade to which they belonged that it
at last became necessary to keep the Marylanders
almost constantly on picket, for as sure as this duty
was entrusted to other troops just so sure were they
to find deserted posts in the morning.

189
And still these brave men never complained of
what was imposed upon them. Throughout that
dreary fall and the long, cold winter, nearly naked
and half fed, they silently did their duty, whilst
thousands were proving recreant to the cause.
Elegant and refined gentlemen, who at home never
knew what it was to want for a single comfort,
were in rags and tatters, sleeping in mud and filth,
and when the bleak winds of December pierced
many a rent in their wretched garments they only
drew their sorry blanket the closer around their
gaunt and shivering limbs, and cheerfully responded
to the call for any duty. Was it a wonder, then,
that after the battle of Cold Harbor General Breckinridge
should have exclaimed, âWhat could not
be done with a hundred thousand such men.â

I shall again resort to a diary in my possession:

December 19th.âTo-day to the great surprise
and joy of all, Colonel James E. Herbert, who was
left in a supposed dying condition upon the field of
Gettysburg, appeared in camp and was enthusiastically
received. The Colonel had endured a long
imprisonment at Johnsonâs Island, and looked anything
but well.

January 8th, 1865.âJust as had been expected,
to-day Colonel Herbert, much to the regret of all,
was compelled to relinquish the command of the
battalion and go to the hospital. His loss was
deeply felt, for the command was sadly in need of
his valuable services.

190
February 5th.âAbout 10 oâclock to-day the
brigade received marching orders, and moving to
the right was joined by heavy bodies of troops,
when the whole crossed the breastworks and
marched quietly along between the two picket lines
some distance, when the Federal skirmishers were
attacked and driven in, and an assault made upon
their works, and although maintained with great
vigor, it was repulsed with heavy loss. Two other
charges by fresh troops met with no better success,
when the Confederates retired, leaving most of their
dead and wounded on the field.

In this severe fight the Second Maryland took a
conspicuous part, and, as usual, suffered severely.
Among the killed was Lieutenant Charles Hodges,
of Company C. The noble fellow, in the midst of
the storm of bullets, halted for an instant to
unbuckle the belt of one of his command who had
fallen wounded, when he was struck in the head
and fell dead.

In his death the command lost one of its most
valuable officers, and the cause an ardent supporter.
His was a character not found in every-day life, but
when encountered, like a pearl, was to be prized
and treasured by all who loved that which is pure
and unblemished. A gallant soldier, a devout
Christian, he was beloved by all who knew his
worth.

February 24th.âAt this time the number of
desertions from the brigade and division to which
the battalion belongs are very numerous, the men

191
leaving their posts on picket in great numbers.
Much dissatisfaction exists, and truly not without
cause. For months they have been in the trenches
with scarcely a sufficiency of food to sustain life,
and almost in a state of nudity, whilst the weather
has been intensely cold. To the honor of the Second
Maryland, however, be it said that as yet but one
desertion has taken place, that of Porter of Company
A. Nor is it likely there will be another, for
the men seem determined to bear their sufferings
uncomplainingly whilst life lasts.

March 27.âFighting has been going on for the
past two days along our front south of Petersburg,
and it is evident the crisis is fast approaching. In
the series of engagements the enemy have been successful,
attacking our thin line with heavy columns,
and all our rifle pits between Hatcherâs Run and the
Weldon Railroad are in his possession. They are
now within seventy-five yards of the position this
division occupies, and an attack is hourly expected.

March 29th.âThe line was changed last night,
but an attack is momentarily expected. Heavy
firing on the right.

April 3d.âLast night about dark Captain Torsch
received the following order from General McComb:

Headquarters McCombâs Brigade
,
April 2d, 1865
.

Captain
:

You will report with your Battalion,
under arms, at once
, at
the
Chapel
of
Gen. Cookâs
brigade.

By command of
Brig. Gen. Wm. McComb
.

John Allen
, A. A. A. G.

Captain
John W. Torsch
, Comdâg Maryland Battalion.

192
The battalion promptly repaired to the point designated,
where it found three battalions in readiness
to assault the trenches lost a few evenings before.
The troops then moved to the attack in gallant
Style, but the Second Maryland alone performed the
work assigned them, the troops on the right and
left having given way, which leaves the battalion in a
precarious situation. Although the enemy are in
their works in force, and but twenty yards in our
front, they do not venture to attack. Capt. Torsch
(who has been in command of the battalion for some
months) declared it as his intention to fight them
to the last, in which resolve he is most heartily
seconded by the little command.

April 5th.âBefore daylight on the morning of
the 4th we succeeded, after twenty-four hours of
intense anxiety, in extricating ourselves from the
perilous position we had gotten into the preceding
night. Captain Torsch then threw out skirmishers
in front, under Captain Duvall, and the remainder
of the battalion he formed behind a line of works
at intervals of thirty paces.

At daylight the enemy made two spirited attacks
about a mile on our left, both of which were
repulsed, but a third proved successful. Moving
then to the right and left they carried everything
before them. Captain Torsch, finding his left flank
attacked, formed his men perpendicularly to the rear,
and taking position behind some logs, repulsed and
drove back two attacking columns in succession.

193
McComb meanwhile endeavored to reinforce Torsch
on the right. At this instant the enemy attacked
on what had been Torschâs front, but now his
right flank, when McComb, finding himself almost
surrounded, gave orders for the whole brigade to
fall back to Hatcherâs Run, though contesting every
foot of ground, but losing heavily in prisoners.

Captain Ferd. Duvall, in command of the skirmish
line, finding himself hard pressed, and his
further retreat cut off, with a handful of men threw
himself into a small interior work, resolved upon
making a last determined stand. Again and again
did the enemy attempt to dislodge this devoted
little band, but they were as often hurled back with
heavy loss. At length by hundreds they swarmed
over the breastworks and gained the interior of the
works, and then, and not until then, did they surrender.

The officers taken here were as follows:

Captain Ferd. Duvall, Lieutenants Zollinger,
Tolson, Polk, Byus and Wise.

Captain Torsch, with the remnant of the battalion,
had in the meantime fallen back to Hatcherâs
Run, where finding the Boydton plank road
bridge in the hands of the enemy, they plunged
into the stream and swam to the opposite bank, and
joined the forces on that side.

The rest is soon told. In the retreat of the army
which followed, the handful of men left of the
battalion assisted in bringing up the rear. The

194
privations endured until the army reached Appomattox
Court House are too well known to repeat,
and by none were they borne more uncomplainingly
than by Captain Torsch and his men; and when,
on the 9th of April, 1865, they laid down their
arms in obedience to the last command they were
ever to receive from their beloved Lee, it was with
feelings not easily imagined. As an organization
the Second Maryland Infantry here ceased to exist,
but it has left a heritage to its posterity and to its State
of which they may be justly proud.

Captain Torsch, on whom the unpleasant duty
devolved, surrendered upon this occasion the following
officers and men, who can point to the record
and proudly say, âWe were of the first, and were
the last.â

List of officers and men of the Second Maryland
Infantry surrendered at Appomattox Court House,
April 9th, 1865:

John W. Torsch, Captain commanding; William
R. McCullough, Adjutant; Dewilton Snowden,

The following General Order from General Lee,
issued the succeeding day, and distributed to the
commanders of corps, divisions, brigades, regiments
and battalions, explains itself:

Headquarters Army Northern Virginia
, }

Appomattox C. H., April 10, 1865.    }

General Orders No. 9.

After four years of arduous service, marked by unsurpassed
courage and fortitude, the Army of Northern Virginia has been
compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources.

196
I need not tell the brave survivors of so many hard fought
battles, who have remained steadfast to the last, that I have
consented to this result from no distrust of them, but feeling that
valor and devotion could accomplish nothing that would compensate
for the loss that must have attended a continuance of the
contest, I determined to avoid the useless sacrifice of those whose
past services have endeared them to their countrymen.

By the terms of the agreement, officers and men can return to
their homes and remain until exchanged. You will take with
you the satisfaction that proceeds from the consciousness of duty
faithfully performed, and I earnestly pray that a merciful God
will extend to you His blessing and protection.

With an unceasing admiration of your constancy and devotion
to your country, and a grateful remembrance of your kind and
generous consideration for myself, I bid you all an affectionate
farewell.

THE
FIRST MARYLAND
BATTALION OF CAVALRY.

CHAPTER I.

On the 15th day of May, 1862, there was assembled
in a quiet room in the city of Richmond a
little band of Marylanders, numbering eighteen
men, who had just been transferred from Captain
Gaitherâs company, of the First Virginia Cavalry,
and ordered to the âMaryland Line,â then organizing
in the Valley of Virginia. The subject of
their conversation was the formation of a company
as a nucleus for a battalion of Maryland cavalry.

âI have withdrawn,â said one, âfrom the First
Virginia, to fight with the people of my native
State, and if we do not form a company, I shall
go into a Maryland command and shoulder a musket,
if I cannot carry a sabre. It is a duty we owe
her, and there are Marylanders enough here to

198
represent her handsomely, if the proper steps are
taken to assemble them.â

âI entirely agree with Lieutenant Brown,â said
a second speaker, (Frank A. Bond,) âand shall
follow his example, though I see no reason why we
should not now, in this very room, organize, and
set to work recruiting, for I feel confident that in
a short time we can gather from among those here
and the many coming over, men enough to muster
in.â

Those present readily concurred, and before
leaving the room it was agreed that Company A
should be officered as follows: Captain, Ridgely
Brown, of Montgomery; First Lieutenant, Frank
A. Bond, of Anne Arundel; Second Lieutenant,
Thomas Griffith, of Montgomery; Third Lieutenant,
James A. V. Pue, of Howard.

And thus was formed the nucleus of the First
Maryland Battalion of Cavalry, a command that
was destined to become an honor to the State, and
the pride of the cavalry arm of the service.

Company A rapidly recruited, and was in a very
short time mustered in, and ordered to the
Valley of Virginia. Here it did good serviceâparticipating
in Jacksonâs memorable campaign
against Banks, and the subsequent retreat from
the superior forces of Fremont. In the cavalry
engagement near Harrisonburg, between the commands
of Ashby and Percy Wyndham, the gallantry
of Company A was so conspicuous as to

199
attract the attention of General Ewell, who paid
it a handsome compliment.

Thence they proceeded, with Jacksonâs army, to
Richmond, and participated in the seven daysâ
fights. It was with the army of General Lee in
Maryland, and after that campaign returned to the
Valley of Virginia, to be joined by three companies
which had been formed by Captains George W.
Emack, Robert C. Smith and Warner E. Welsh.

At Winchester, on the 25th of November, 1862,
the battalion was organized as follows:

Major, Ridgely Brown; Adjutant, George W.
Booth; Quartermaster, Ignatius Dorsey; Surgeon,
Wilner McKnew.

Company A.âCaptain, Frank A. Bond; First
Lieutenant, Thomas Griffith; Second Lieutenant,
J. A. V. Pue; Third Lieutenant, Edward Beatty.

Company B.âCaptain, George W. Emack; First
Lieutenant, M. E. McKnew; Second Lieutenant,
Adolphus Cook; Third Lieutenant, Henry Blackiston.

Company C.âCaptain, Robert C. Smith; First
Lieutenant, George Howard; Second Lieutenant,
T. Jeff Smith; Third Lieutenant, W. S. Turnbull.

Company D.âCaptain, Warner E. Welsh; First
Lieutenant, W. H. Dorsey; Second Lieutenant,
Stephen D. Laurence; Third Lieutenant, Milton
Welsh.

Subsequently the battalion was joined by the following
additional companies:

200
Company E.âCaptain, W. I. Raisin; First Lieutenant,
John B. Burroughs; Second Lieutenant,
Nathaniel Chapman; Third Lieutenant, Joseph K.
Roberts.

Company F.âCaptain, Augustus F. Schwartz;
First Lieutenant, C. Irving Ditty; Second Lieutenant,
Fielder C. Slingluff; Third Lieutenant, Samâl
G. Bonn.

Company H.âCaptain, Gustavus W. Dorsey;
First Lieutenant, N. C. Hobbs; Second Lieutenant,
Edward Pugh.

The company of Captain Dorsey joined the battalion
in July, 1864, having served with distinction
up to that time in the First Virginia regiment, of
which Generals J. E. B. Stuart, W. E. Jones, and
Fitzhugh Lee had successively been Colonels. It
will be seen there is a vacancy, occasioned by the
death of Third Lieutenant Rodolphus Cecil, who was
killed whilst the company was serving in the First
Virginia.

After the formation of the battalion, it was ordered
to New Market, to join the infantry and artillery
of the Maryland Line there encamped.

The winter was passed at various points in the
Valley, with its usual routine of picket duty, and but
little to vary the monotony of camp life. During
that time an expedition was made to Moorefield, by
General Jones, but it was attended with no incident
worthy of note.

The author cannot say, though, that it was by any

201
means an unpleasant winter. We did suffer many hardships
and privations, it is true, and were compelled
more than once to sleep in the snow; but
then we had our enjoyments in social intercourse.
The cavalry visited the infantry and artillery, and
the infantry and artillery visited the cavalry; and
especially was this the case when it was known a
committee from either had returned from a trip to
the âFort.â And when, on rainy days, we were
compelled to seek the shelter of our shebangs, we
could listen to Lieutenant Bill Dorsey narrate the
particulars of his famous duel. Pshaw! Don Quixote
and his windmill were nowhere.

The reader may wonder what is meant by this
mysterious âFort.â In a word, it was a secluded
spot in the mountains where persimmon whiskey
was distilled, the road to which was known to Tom
Griffithâs big stone jug full well.

The author paid a visit to this famous âFortâ on
one occasion. He would not have gone had he not
been ordered by Colonel Herbert. Oh, no, for he
had been for a long while thinking of signing the
temperance pledge. But then he had been taught
to always obey orders. Colonel Herbert had invited
Colonel Funston and Colonel Massey to dine
next day, and it seemed so unsociable not to have
something stronger than water on the table, if only
for appearance sake. And then chickens and turkeys
were to be bought, etc. He went, and with
him Captain Ferd. Duvall, mounted on Emackâs

202
race horse. In due time we arrived, and found
things cheap, very cheap.

Captain Duvall was a prodigal man with his
money, and bought one gallon and a half of persimmon
juice, which was poured into sundry three pint
canteens. The day was damp and raw, and it was
necessary to try the whiskey to test its quality.

âI donât think itâs good,â I remarked, after
tasting it.

âYou are mistaken,â said the Captain; âitâs
capital. Try it again.â

And we had another pull.

âBetter than I thought,â said I, taking the canteen
from my lips.

âYou were right at first,â said Ferd., almost
strangled; ânot good at allânot good at all.â

âYou are mistaken,â I insisted, âas you will be
convinced if you try it again.â

And we did try again, and found it capital.

And then poultry was to be bought; and here
again the Captain was prodigal. Three turkeys,
six chickens, one goose, two ducks and a guinea
fowl was the extent of his purchase, which we
strapped behind our saddles.

âOne more pull, Major,â said he, âand then ho
for camp.â

The pull was taken, and we started, chatting
merrily along the road. But persimmon soon began
to tell, and âAnne Arundelâ became sentimental.

âSweet Evelina, dear Evelina, sweet Evelina,

203
dear Evelina. Say, Major, thatâs what Colonel
Herbert sings when heâs thinking of his sweetheart
at home. Thatâs all he knows of it, and thatâs all
I know. Look here, if you donât tell anybody, Iâll
confide a secret. Iâm feeling desperate to-day;
havnât you observed it? Iâll tell you why. I
had

a sweetheart at home, too, but donât you think sheâs
gone back on me. Yes, done gone and fell in love
with another feller. Sweet Evelina, dear Evelina,
Dââ Evelina. Come, letâs have a horse race; I
want to see what Emack can do.â

The chickens and turkeys had long been forgotten,
and off we started at full speed, Baltimore city
against Anne Arundel county, and after an even
race of two miles we brought up in front of Colonel
Herbertâs tent.

The Colonel came out and wanted to know what in
the devil we were riding like fools for. âNo poultry,
I see.â

âLots of it, lots of it,â said I âJust look
behind our saddles, will you!â

âNothing there that I can see.â

Sure enough, chickens, ducks, turkeys and goose
were all âdone gone.â

A courier was immediately dispatched back over
the road we had raced, and he found them strewed
along for a mile and a half.

But our misfortunes did not end here, for next
day our camp was visited by an unusual number of
the officers of the Maryland Cavalry and Baltimore

204
Light Artillery, and before dinner, to our surprise,
every drop of whiskey had disappeared. Here was
a dilemma, for Colonel Herbert didnât know a
breath of it; and when the cloth was spread, and
no black bottle made its appearance, he looked blue,
and Funston looked blue, and Massey looked blue,
and Ferd. and myself looked bluest. But it was
âdone gone,â and couldnât be helped, so we had a
temperance dinner that day.

In March, 1863, a small party from companies A
and D, under the command of Captain Bond and
Lieutenant Dorsey, whilst picketing on the back
road, below Fisherâs Hill, made a dash upon the
enemyâs pickets in the vicinity of Kearnstown,
killing and capturing a number of them. They were
attacked in turn by a large body of cavalry, and
compelled to retire precipitately, with the loss of
two or three men. This daring act caused a general
alarm in Winchester, and Milroy immediately
dispatched the 12th and 13th Pennsylvania up the
turnpike, running parallel with the back road, to
cut the party off. The movement was, however,
observed, and information of their approach communicated
to General Jones, who, with a part of his
command, moved forward to meet them. The
enemy were encountered at the little village of Maurytown.
The surprise was complete, and the rout
that ensued was perhaps unparalleled in the history
of the war. At one charge the enemy were scattered
in every direction, and pursued to the very

205
gates of Winchester, losing nearly three hundred
men in killed, wounded, and captured.

In this affair the First Maryland bore itself with
conspicuous gallantry, although but few of the men
had ever before been under fire.

CHAPTER II.

For some time prior to the 21st of April extensive
preparations had been going on in the command
of General Jones for a move in some direction.
These preparations were anxiously watched by the
officers and men, for all were heartily sick of the
camp, and were ready for any undertaking. Orders
were at length given to cook two daysâ rations,
which made it evident that the long anticipated
movement was at hand. On that day the forces of
Jones (numbering three thousand five hundred men)
were marshaled, and soon on the road to Moorefield.
The roads were in a shocking condition, and the
troops moved slowly, and after marching fifteen
miles the command went into camp.

Next day the object of the expedition was made
known. As had been surmised, it was intended to
operate upon the line of the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, and to secure supplies from the rich and
fertile valleys of West Virginia.

206
The Maryland Line accompanied the expeditionâthe
infantry and artillery as far as Moorefield, and
the cavalry the whole way.

On the third day, the command reached the
vicinity of Moorefield, in the midst of a drenching
rain, which continued throughout the night and the
next day. In the morning, the several mountain
streams in the vicinity of that place were found so
swollen as to be almost impassable. By running
great risk, however, the command reached the
banks of the Potomac, which they found impossible
to cross at that point. There was, therefore, no alternative
but to move down to Petersburg, thirteen
miles distant, and try another ford. The point
was reached on the afternoon of the 24th, but even
here it was found the attempt would be extremely
hazardous. But General Jones was determined to
proceed at every risk, and the men were ordered to
plunge into the rapid stream.

A fearful scene then presented itself, and for some
time baffled description. Hundreds of frightened
steeds, and their no less frightened riders, were
struggling in the dark, rapid waters; and, alas!
more than one poor soldier and his gallant horse,
that had borne him so faithfully, were swept away,
and no more to be seen until the turbulent waters
should have subsided and surrendered up their lifeless
bodies.

The crossing was at length effected, and the command
moved up the stream and went into camp

207
within three miles of where it had started that morning,
after having traveled a distance of twenty-six
miles. The start was a bad one, but all hoped the
end would prove more propitious.

Unincumbered with artillery, wagons, and infantry,
the command started off at a rapid gait, but
after marching a few miles, the 7th Virginia, which
was in advance, suddenly came upon the enemyâs
pickets. It was soon ascertained that the main
body (numbering about one hundred and fifty men)
was posted in a log school house, which completely
commanded the road through Greenland Gap, over
which Jones must necessarily pass. A flag of truce
was sent forward, and a demand made for the surrender
of the place, which was refused. An assault
was then ordered, but as the troops could only move
over the narrow road two abreast, it was repulsed
with loss, Colonel Richard Dulaney, of the 7th Virginia,
being among the wounded.

In a second assault, on foot, about nightfall, the
men succeeded in reaching the school house, though
not without severe loss, and demanded its surrender.
The reply was a volley of musketry, through the
loopholes, and not until the place was fired did the
miserable creatures surrender, and beg piteously for
the worthless lives they had forfeited by all the rules
of war; and they were spared.

The Confederate loss was heavy, and the First
Maryland suffered severely in officers and men.
Among the wounded of the former were Major

208
Brown, Captain R. C. Smith, Adjutant Booth, and
Lieutenants Pue and Beatty.

This obstacle overcome, and the prisoners sent to
the rear, the column pushed rapidly forward, and,
after proceeding some ten miles, the First Maryland
was ordered to move towards Oakland, whilst the
main body took another direction.

Riding all day and night, at one oâclock on the
26th the First Maryland charged into Oakland, Md.,
capturing fifty prisoners.

Leaving that place, the column moved upon
Kingwood. Arriving within a short distance of
the town, a halt was ordered, and Captain Bondâs
company directed to charge the place. By fours
the company moved forward at the trot, and as
they approached, were surprised that they were not
fired upon. âGallop-march, charge!â shouted the
gallant Bond; and, yelling like furies, Company
A dashed through the village, slashing right and
left with their sabres at the imaginary foe. But,
alas, they had left two weeks before, and nobody
was hurt. A disappointment, Captain; but perhaps
you will be better rewarded next time.

There was but an hourâs halt here, when the
column moved in the direction of Morgantown, which
place was reached at 1 P. M. The citizens had
assembled in considerable force, prepared to dispute
Brownâs advance, but upon a demand being made
for the surrender of the place, they quietly submitted,
no doubt thinking discretion the better part

209
of valor. That night the battalion went into camp
at Independence, and next morning made connection
with the main body.

Returning to Morgantown, the command crossed
the river, and, after a short halt, commenced a night
march in the direction of Fairmont, at which place
they arrived about 8 oâclock next morning. A body
of four hundred infantry was posted here to dispute
their passage. They were drawn up in an open
field, surrounded by high fences. The First Maryland
was ordered to charge. It was a most desperate
undertaking, but at the command of the gallant
Brown they dashed forward. Upon reaching the
fence, and within fifty yards of the enemy, they were
received with a terrific fire, which, strange to say,
killed sixty horses and but one manâyoung Myers,
of Frederick. In an instant the fence was thrown
down, and Brown was upon them, when they called
for quarter.

Thence Jones moved upon Clarksburg, but finding
the enemy in strong force, the place was flanked by
way of Bridgeport. This town was also charged by
the First Maryland, resulting in the capture of sixty
men. In this affair Robert Whitely, of Baltimore,
was killed.

On the 2d of May, the column reached a place
called Buchanan, after many days of rapid riding,
which was only performed by continually changing
the broken-down horses for fresh ones found in the
country. At Buchanan Major Brownâs wound became

210
so painful as to necessitate his going to the
rear; and, although not the senior officer, owing to
his experience and acknowledged judgment and discretion,
Captain Frank Bond was called upon to
command the little battalion.

An early start was made on the morning of the
6th, in the direction of Parkersburg, and marching
all night, at daylight on the 7th the column struck
the railroad at Cairo, where, at the summons of
Captain Bond, a body of fifty Federal infantry surrendered.
After destroying the bridge at this point,
the command moved on several miles farther, where
it encamped for the night, having made a march of
eighty miles without removing saddles.

On the 8th, but twenty miles were made, and the
troops went into camp at Webbâs Mills, tired and
hungry. Provisions for men and forage for horses
must be had, but there seemed a scarcity of both.
The farmer upon whose place the First Maryland
encamped declared he had neither. The smokehouse
was searched, and nothing but two or three
pieces of bacon was revealed, which the man insisted
was all he had in the world. Poor fellow! he had
the sympathies of the whole command. But he was
a Union Yankee, and what Yankee wonât lie, even
for a piece of bacon? for while all hands were sympathizing
with him in his extreme destitution, some
of the men inadvertently kicked over a few armsfull
of rotten hay where had been an old haystack,
when, behold! before their astonished vision lay an

211
immense pile of bacon buried in the ground, and
thus covered. The poor old wretch was wild with
fright, but when assured only enough would be
taken to feed the few men of the command, he could
scarcely credit his senses. We wonder whether had
it been a Yankee command in a Rebel country the
owner would have escaped with his bacon? No;
had he saved the house over his head he would have
been fortunate.

Bright and early, on the morning of the 8th of
May, the troopers were called from their sound slumbers
by the loud blasts of the bugle, and after a
scanty feed given to their horses, and a slice of the
old manâs bacon partaken of by themselves, the
âmountâ was sounded and the march resumed.
They were that day to witness an unusual sight, as
all were aware, should nothing interfere, for the
command was on its way to Oil City, to destroy the
immense quantity of oil known to be there. The
roads were in a most wretched condition, but the
twenty miles that separated them from their prey
was soon traversed.

As expected, a large amount of oil was on hand,
calculated at 300,000 barrels, which was principally
in large boats, into which it had been
pumped, to be conveyed off and barreled. The
coming of the audacious Rebels was altogether unexpected,
or much of it could have been removed to
a place of safety. But this time the fates decreed
against the Yankees, and many thousands of dollars

212
worth of Northern capital was to fall a prey to an
outraged peopleâs avenging torch.

Preparations were immediately made for a grand
illumination. The works were first touched off, and
next the barges, and perhaps such a sight as followed
it had never before been the province of man
to witness. Immense volumes of dense black smoke
arose, and with the lurid flame mounted high in the
air. The burning boats were cast off from their
moorings, and floated down with the current, enveloped
in smoke and flame, and as the oil ran out
and covered the surface of the water, it appeared as
though before them lay a sea of liquid fire. For
hours the raiders watched the vast conflagration,
which seemed a lamp of magnificent proportions,
lighted to illuminate the whole world.

It served as a beacon to the enemy, though, and
the troopers were admonished to be up and away.

On the 10th, the march was resumed, and by the
next day the column passed through De Kalb and
Glenville, and encamped within six miles of Duttonville.

For several days the march was continued at a
rapid gait, without an incident worth mentioning.
Horses, beeves and sheep were gathered in great
numbers, and started for the Valley, to mount and
feed the troops of the Confederate army. Save these,
all other property was respected.

Through Dutton, across Elk river, on they went,
passing âImbodenâs Life Insurance Commandâ at

213
Somerville; thence across the almost perpendicular
Flat Top mountains; and on the 16th encamped
within four miles of Lewisburgâmen and horses
completely broken down.

A rest was here absolutely necessary to refresh
man and beast. But a day was allowed, however,
and on the 18th they were once more on the wing,
and from day to day the march continued homeward,
until the battalion reached its old camp, near
New Market, on the 30th of May, after an absence of
thirty-nine days, on one of the most remarkable
raids of the war.

But the expedition was by no means a success.
General Jonesâ original purpose was to destroy the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad at various important
points, but, as he might have expected, these points
were guarded by large bodies of troops, which compelled
him to forego that intention. He started
without accurate information, and only learned it
when in the enemyâs country. He then turned his
attention to gathering the stock along his route,
much of which, however, never reached the Valley.
It is true he did destroy an immense amount of property
and a few unimportant bridges, but it had no
practical results. One of the valuable lives lost,
then, was worth more than all the good accomplished.
And, moreover, his command returned to
the Valley in a completely broken down and unserviceable
condition.

214

CHAPTER III.

In a day or two after the return of the First Maryland
to the Valley, it was ordered to join the remainder
of the âLine,â then encamped at Fisherâs
Hill. A short time after, this force was augmented
by the arrival of General Albert G. Jenkins, with a
fine brigade of Virginia cavalry, and he assumed
command of the whole.

Here, for several days, the battalion was quietly
employed in doing picket duty, and recruiting man
and horse for the campaign that seemed about to be
inaugurated. Not an incident of moment occurred,
and in a weekâs time the command was again ready
for the field.

On the 12th of June information was received
that the enemy were advancing towards our camp,
which had been moved up to Cedar Creek. The infantry
and artillery were marched to the vicinity
of Middletown, and placed in position, whilst General
Jenkins held his cavalry in readiness. After
waiting some time, and there being no signs of our
pickets (which had just been relieved, and those relieved
not yet returned,) falling back, it was naturally
concluded the force of the enemy had been
greatly exaggerated. Having arrived at this conclusion,
General Jenkins was about to order his
troops back to camp, when he was startled by the
rattle of small arms and the discharge of artillery,

215
some four miles up the road. It was not long before
we were made aware of the cause, which I will give
the reader as told me by several of the officers and
men engaged.

The company from the First Maryland relieved
was that of Captain Wm. I. Raisin, which, along
with a company from Jenkinsâ cavalry, that had
also just been relieved, was about to return to camp,
when a body of the enemyâs cavalry were observed
coming down the turnpike towards them. Information
of the fact was immediately sent by Captain
Raisin to General Jenkins, who disposed of his
troops as before stated. In the meantime, Colonel
Harry Gilmor, (who had been sick in bed for several
days at Middletown,) hearing of their approach, got
up and joined Raisin. For some time that officer
manÅuvered with the enemy, who fell back as he
slowly advanced. Finally, the men, who had become
impatient, commenced to move forward at a
rapid trot, which the next instant became a gallop,
and then a headlong charge, which Raisinâs utmost
efforts failed to arrest before the whole command was
in the midst of a large body of infantry, in ambuscade,
which opened upon them with deadly effect, as
did two pieces of artillery. In the greatest confusion
the survivors wheeled about, leaving four of
their comrades killed and about thirty wounded
and prisoners in the hands of the enemy. Among
the latter was Captain Raisin, who, whilst bleeding
and senseless under his dying horse, was most inhumanly

216
beaten by the wretches into whose hands he
had fallen.

I have thus gone into the particulars of this affair
for the reason that Colonel Gilmor, in his âFour
Years in the Saddle,â asserts that Captain Raisin
gave the command to charge, contrary to his (Gilmorâs)
judgment, which I believe is doing him injustice,
and reflects upon his reputation as an officer.
More than one who was close by assure me that he
did not, and that it occurred as above stated.

A reason I have for thinking Colonel Gilmor is
mistaken in this matter, is the fact that not one
week before, whilst in command at Fisherâs Hill,
during the absence of Colonel Herbert, and before
the arrival of General Jenkins, I had taken Captain
Raisin, with his company, and two companies of infantry
to lay in ambush, on precisely such an expedition,
though unsuccessful, by reason of the enemy
not making their appearance, and upon which occasion
I cautioned him not to allow them to catch
him in a similar trap. Now, it is not likely that
an intelligent man like Captain Raisin would so
soon have forgotten the expedition and caution of
but a week before.

An incident that I am reminded of would lead
me to believe that if an order to charge was given,
it was given by Harry himself. A few minutes
after the affair, I met one of Jenkinsâ men by the
roadside, lamenting the wounding of a valuable
horse, which he was leading. âThis is a pretty bad
piece of business,â I remarked.

217
âY-a-s,â he drawled out, âand may I be darned
ef Iâm goinâ to foller that thar feller with the spang
new yaller clothes any more.â

Harry had just donned a new uniform, mounted
with a superabundance of yellow lace.

On the evening of the 12th, the battalion (with
the exception of Bondâs company, which was detailed
to remain with Colonel Herbert,) was ordered
to join General Ewell, who, much to their surprise,
was at Front Royal, moving on Winchester. In
the skirmishing which ensued around that place,
they took an active part.

After the capture of Milroyâs forces, at Winchester,
General Jenkins with his command was ordered
to precede the army of General Lee into Pennsylvania,
and to his command the First Maryland was
temporarily assigned. With him the battalion
operated for some time, skirmishing with the enemy
at various points, and participating in the battle of
Gettysburg.

On the retreat from Gettysburg the little battalion
was called upon to show of what metal it
was composed.

Here, along with other cavalry, in covering the
retreat and protecting the immense wagon trains,
they were continually engaged with the overwhelming
forces of the enemy. Many and terrific were
the encounters; but, hand to hand and sabre to
sabre, they contested every foot of ground, losing
many men in killed, wounded and prisoners. Upon

218
this memorable retreat every officer and every man
proved himself a hero. It seems invidious to particularize
where so many were truly brave; but still,
I will say, that among that heroic band, none shone
more conspicuously than Captains George W.
Emack and Warner E. Welsh. Fighting desperately,
their deeds of daring at times amounted
almost to madness.

At length Hagerstown was reached. Upon the
very heels of the First Maryland, and Tenth Virginia
commanded by Colonel Lucius Davis, pressed
the would-be incendiary and assassin, Ulric Dahlgren.
Furiously he charged the Confederate column
in the very streets of the town. The Tenth
Virginia, in the rear, was thrown into confusion,
and fell back and passed the command of Captain
Bond. But that little band of heroes were not to
be affected by the unmanly panic, but moved at the
same dogged, determined pace. Bond was but
waiting for the Virginians to get by. The enemy
were within a hundred yards of him, and an
unguarded Confederate wagon train was at their
mercy. That wagon train must be saved, for it
contained much of General Ewellâs supply of
ammunition. âFours, right-about wheel, march!
Charge!â rung out the command; and in an
instant the gallant fellows had obeyed the order.
Bond, mounted upon his fiery mare, Bertha Rives,
was too quick for his followers, and darting
like lightning, amid a shower of bullets, he found

219
himself within twenty yards of the astonished
enemy before he was able to check her. Here, for
an instant, that brave man confronted almost certain
death, as the muzzle of his pistol swept from
right to left, in search of a victim. He was found,
a quick, ringing report is heard, a spasmodic motion
of the leg, and Ulric Dahlgren was a cripple for
the brief remainder of his wicked life.

All this, reader, did not occupy half the time
I have taken to relate it, for in an instant Captain
Bondâs men were at his side, and closed with the
enemy. A desperate hand-to-hand conflict ensued,
but they were driven back in confusion, pursued by
the relentless Marylanders, who cut them down at
every step. The wagon train was saved, and the
command received the congratulations of General
Ewell.

Alas! it was but a little while after that the
chivalrous Bond was himself wounded and a prisoner.
Having passed Hagerstown, whilst riding too
far back to the rear, he was struck in the leg by a
piece of shell from a Confederate battery which was
firing over him, and terribly injured. He was
taken back to Hagerstown, where everything was
done by the noble women of the place to relieve his
sufferings. He eventually recovered, and is now a
thriving farmer at his home in Anne Arundel
county.

220

CHAPTER IV.

But little of moment occurred after the engagement
at Hagerstown; and crossing the Potomac
with the army, the First Maryland repaired to
Winchester to recruit. It was here that the company
under the command of the noble Schwartz
joined it.

After a stay of ten days at Winchester, the battalion
was ordered to join the brigade of General
Fitzhugh Lee, then encamped near Leetown. Soon
after, on the promotion of that General to the command
of a division, it was assigned to the brigade
of General Lomax.

From this time to the 11th of October the battalion
was occupied with picket duty, enlivened by
an occasional skirmish with the enemy.

A few days prior to this date, General Leeâs
movement to gain the rear of Meadeâs army, then
confronting along the line of the Rappahannock,
had commenced.

On the 9th the cavalry division of Fitzhugh Lee
broke camp, and sent the baggage to the rear, but
bivouacked on the same ground until three oâclock
on the morning of the 11th, at which time they
moved out towards the Rappahannock, Lomaxâs
brigade marching upon Mortonâs Ford, while
Wickhamâs brigade marched to Raccoon Ford.

General J. E. B. Stuart personally superintended

221
the movement of the whole cavalry column higher
up the river, advancing by way of Culpepper Court
House. These dispositions were designed to cover
General Leeâs movements, by interposing the cavalry
between his line of march and the enemy.

Before Lomaxâs brigade reached Mortonâs Ford,
reports from pickets represented the enemy as
advancing in force, and upon reaching the river a
heavy column was found occupying both sides.
The collision between the hostile forces was abrupt
and sudden, for to both it was unexpected. In a
very few minutes the First Maryland was formed,
and engaged heavily. The fight soon became general,
and continued for more than three hours, the
enemy using artillery freely, whilst Lomax was
without a single piece. At length, by a sweeping
charge of the whole line over the plain lying
between the contending forces, the struggle was
ended at that point, the enemy retiring slowly
towards the river, followed by the victorious Confederates.
About half way down to the riverâs
side the rear of their cavalry turned and covered
the retreat of the main body by making a gallant
charge, that struck the Maryland Battalion, which
held the extreme left of the line, but it was handsomely
repulsed, the brave officer who led it falling
mortally wounded in their midst.

The main body retreated across the river, rapidly
pursued by Lomax, who came up with them within
a few miles, when a running fight ensued to

222
Brandy Station, often before the scene of heavy
cavalry fighting. Before reaching Brandy Station,
the brigades of Lomax and Wickham united, as
had also the two columns of the enemy, for Wickham
had been heavily engaged at Raccoon Ford.
Here the enemyâs cavalry met the infantry sent to
support them, when they turned upon their pursuers,
and the fight was renewed with redoubled
fury, and charges and counter charges were made,
until both sides paused from sheer exhaustion.

The left of the Confederate line then crossed the
road leading from Culpepper C. H. to Brandy Station,
and the battle was resumed. Whilst it was
raging fiercely, a short time before dark, a heavy
dust arose in the direction of Culpepper. This was
soon ascertained to be the enemyâs cavalry, rapidly
advancing from that town. Fearing an attack in
the rear from this new enemy, General Fitz Lee
immediately drew back his left, which was then in
danger, and reformed parallel to the road by which
they approached. Down he came in splendid style,
his sabres drawn and flashing in the rays of the declining
sun, and to an inexperienced observer it
would have seemed as though everything would
have been swept from before it. Not so the gallant
men who stood in his way awaiting the attack.
But the enemy was evidently not seeking a fight,
for suddenly he moved to the left, upon discovering
the Confederates in his path, and sought to pass
without a collision. But this did not suit General

223
Lee, who immediately ordered a charge, and Yankee
and Confederate were soon dashing along in
most admirable confusion, until the infantry was
reached, when General Lee was compelled to retire
out of range.

A short time after, General J. E. B. Stuart, with
Hamptonâs division, came down the Culpepper road,
and then was ascertained the reason why the Yankees
had wished to pass so rapidly. That General
had defeated them at Culpepper, and was then in
hot pursuit.

This was the first cavalry fight in which the
Spencer repeating carbine was used by the enemy,
but notwithstanding this advantage over the old
muzzle loading gun, they were badly beaten, having
been driven upon their infantry, and engaged from
early dawn until night put an end to the conflict.

The loss of the First Maryland was severe, as they
were engaged almost continually during the fight,
both mounted and on foot.

The enemy acknowledged a loss of one thousand
men in killed and wounded.

On the day after the fight at Mortonâs Ford, the
cavalry corps crossed the Rappahannock at Warrenton
Springs, and moved down the Warrenton and
Alexandria pike, and breaking into several columns,
marched by different but nearly parallel
roads in the direction of Centreville. Fitz Leeâs
division moved towards Catlettâs Station, on the
Orange and Alexandria railroad. At a small place

224
on Cedar creek, called Aubren, Lomaxâs brigade
(the reader will bear in mind that the First Maryland
was attached to this brigade) made a dash at
the enemyâs wagon train then passing, but finding
it protected by a corps of his infantry, Lomax withdrew.
This affair, though brief and unsatisfactory,
gave occasion for a complimentary order from General
Lomax to the First Maryland, which was well
deserved, for by their gallant bearing, they materially
assisted in extricating that General from a
most perilous position.

By this time Meade had divined the object of
General Leeâs movement, and his whole army was
in retreat towards Washington, in order to prevent
that General from gaining his rear. During this
retreat, the cavalry made several attacks upon his
flank, in all of which the Maryland cavalry were actively
engaged. But little was effected, however,
owing to the careful and compact order in which the
enemy retired.

Finding his prey had escaped him, General Lee
fell back to the line of the Rapidan, leaving the
cavalry to guard his rear, which also fell back
slowlyâHampton by the Warrenton pike, and Fitz
Lee by the Orange and Alexandria railroad, the two
running parallel.

The enemyâs cavalry, under Kilpatrick, thinking
retreat meant defeat, pressed after Hampton, and
his advance and Hamptonâs rear soon became engaged.
Hampton continued his retreat until he

225
reached within two miles of Warrenton, when the
trap he had prepared for Kilpatrick was sprung.
So eager was that officer to immortalize himself, and
so confident was he of success, that he never stopped
to think of the danger that might be lurking behind
the range of hills on his left. Fitz Lee was there,
and when he thought to crush Hampton at a blow,
and drive him into the Rappahannock, the sound of
a few cannon shots on his rear and left suddenly put
a new phase on affairs. With the sound of these
guns, Hampton ceased his retreat, and turned and
charged, while at the same moment Fitz Lee struck
him in flank at Buckland. The fight which ensued
was short, bloody, and decisive, and Kilpatrickâs
exultant pursuit was converted into a precipitate
rout, and his troopers scattered over the country in
all directions.

During this fight, the First Maryland fought on
foot, but when the rout commenced, they mounted
and pursued to near Gainsville, where the enemy
met his infantry. It was now dark, and Colonel
Brown could not see what was in his front; but
halting a moment to rectify his line, he gave the
command to charge, when both cavalry and infantry
broke and fled in the utmost confusion. Many were
killed, wounded, and captured; and Brown, now
aware that he was in the presence of Meadeâs army,
withdrew to Buckland, where was assembled the
commands of Hampton and Lee, and where they
congratulated each other on the signal victory they

226
had achieved over the bully and blackguard leader
of the âBuckland racers.â

After this affair, Mr. Kilpatrickâs thirst for glory
perceptibly subsided, and the Confederate army
marched peacefully and uninterruptedly to the vicinity
of its old line on the Rappahannock.

Nothing of moment occurred here beyond the
usual picket duty, until the First Maryland was ordered
to join Colonel Bradley T. Johnson at Hanover
Junction, where that officer had been ordered
to assemble the Maryland Line, and picket along
Leeâs line of communication with Richmond.

Before the separation, division and brigade orders
were issued and read at the head of the regiment,
highly complimentary to the gallant little command;
and I will here state, that it was the fate of the
First Maryland to serve, at different times during
the war, with many of the divisions and brigades of
the cavalry corps, and the fact can be referred to
with pride, that no General with whom it served
suffered it to pass to another command without publicly
complimenting them in general orders.

227

CHAPTER V.

The battalion reached Hanover Junction the last
of November, when Colonel Johnson established
his picket lines, and prepared to go into winter
quarters.

The winter was spent most delightfully, and
nothing occurred to disturb its pleasures save an
attempted raid made by Butler to Bottomâs bridge,
whereupon the cavalry and artillery were promptly
moved upon his flank to Tunstallâs station, when he
retired.

About the first of March, 1864, Colonel Johnson
received a telegram from General Lee, saying that
a large body of cavalry had passed his flank, and
was moving in the direction of the Junction. That
officer immediately sent out his scouts to the north
and west, and soon discovered that it was a heavy
column, indeed, and moving southwest. It crossed
the Virginia Central railroad at Frederickâs Hall,
on Johnsonâs left, and took the road which led direct
to Richmond.

Of course he at once saw that the object of
the enemy was an attack upon that city, believing
that there were but few troops to oppose him. Colonel
Johnson immediately ordered his pickets to destroy
the boats on the Pamunky, to cut off his
retreat in that direction, and with sixty men of the
First Maryland cavalry, and two guns from the Baltimore

228
Light Artilleryâthe only disposable force he
had left after sending out his scouts to watch the
enemyâs movementsâhe followed in pursuit. Just
outside of Taylorsville, the enemyâs pickets were
encountered and driven in, and pursued to Ashland.
Here a large force was met on its way to destroy the
railroad and buildings there, and, after a sharp encounter,
the enemy retired.

Moving as rapidly as possible along the Telegraph
road, Colonel Johnson threw himself upon the
enemyâs flank at Yellow Tavern, and posting his
men, commenced to capture small parties that came
along. Among his captures was a sergeant, with
five men, who proved to be a bearer of dispatches
from Colonel Dahlgren to General Kilpatrick.
Kilpatrickâs guns were then thundering away at
the outer defences of Richmond, and Dahlgrenâs
dispatch informed him that he would attack at
dusk that evening on his road, and he looked for
Kilpatrick to attack with vigor on his (Kilpatrickâs)
side of the city.

Seeing at once that he had destroyed the communication
between the co-operating forces, Colonel
Johnson prepared to attack and harrass Kilpatrickâs
rear. Taking care not to expose the number of his
force, he attacked a picket in the rear of the centre
of the line of battle drawn up in front of Richmond,
and drove it in. This bold act conveyed the impression
to Kilpatrick that he was cut off, and seriously
in danger in his rear. Hastily mounting his troops,

229
he moved at the trot down the Peninsula towards
the Pamunky, and crossing the Chickahominy, before
dark, at Meadow bridge, he went into camp.
Colonel Johnson encamped on the opposite side.
During the night, Hampton came upon the enemy,
with the First and Second North Carolina, and
broke up his camp, capturing several hundred
prisoners and horses.

At daylight in the morning, Colonel Johnson
crossed his small force over the river, and came up
with Kilpatrickâs rear guard, near Old Church,
which was immediately attacked, and several prisoners
captured. Still taking every precaution not
to expose to the enemy the smallness of his force, he
continued to harrass him, and drove his rear guard
through Old Church in confusion. Here, thinking
himself seriously menaced, Kilpatrick formed line of
battle. It seemed really ridiculousâthree thousand
men and four pieces of artillery in battle array to
fight sixty men. Moving a regiment to the rear,
he compelled Colonel Johnson to fall back half a
mile, but as soon as this returned to the main body,
he again renewed his attacks upon the unhappy rear
guard.

In this way they moved down the Peninsula some
distance, when a scout informed Colonel Johnson
that a column of the enemy was moving down the
road, immediately in his rear. He was thus between
two forces. Dismounting his men as rapidly
as possible, and deploying them in the woods, on

230
each side of the road, he awaited their approach.
Upon perceiving him, they made a charge, and went
through his line, not, however, without losing forty-five
men and horses.

This proved to be a remnant of Dahlgrenâs marauders,
four hundred strong, ladened with plunder.
Among the many articles of value recaptured from
them was a silver dish cover, belonging to Mrs.
Morson, of Goochland.

From their statement, it appeared that Dahlgren,
not receiving an answer to the dispatch sent to Kilpatrick,
and which was fortunately intercepted by
Colonel Johnson, as already seen, started with a
hundred men to find him, but failed to get across
the Pamunky at Dabneyâs ferry, owing to the destruction
of the boats, as has been stated, and in his
endeavors to escape through King and Queen county,
was ambuscaded in the night, and he himself killed
by a mere boy, and his whole command captured by
the home guard.

Kilpatrick finding the expedition a failure, and
believing himself pressed by a superior force,
although but sixty sabres were at his heels, made for
the lower ferries of the Pamunky, but failed to
cross, for the same reason Dahlgren had, and finally
reached Tunstallâs Station, and joined the forces
under Butler, having been followed the whole way
by the Maryland Battalion.

For this gallant exploit, General Elzey, in command
of the defences of Richmond, issued a general

231
order complimenting the command, and General
Wade Hampton, in his report to General Lee, distinctly
gave the credit of saving Richmond to the
little battalion; for, by destroying the combination
between Dahlgren and Kilpatrick, they prevented
the joint attack on the city, and by the
vigorous and incessant harrassing of the latterâs
rear, conveyed the impression that he was attacked
in force, at once changing his movements into a
retreat, (deserting his subordinate Dahlgren,) and
converting the attacks of Johnson into a pursuit.

Thus the devilish scheme originated by the
wretched Dahlgren to get possession of the Confederate
Capital, was frustrated. I say devilish,
for upon his inanimate body was found papers that
will cover his name forever with infamy. Although
not the senior officer, he had command of the expedition,
and these papers prove that it was his purpose
to murder President Davis and the members
of his cabinet, destroy the city, and give its women
up to the lusts of his brutal soldiers. But, to
thwart his hellish designs, God interposed a little
band of brave men, and the city was not only
saved, but the hirelings of Yankeedom scattered
to the four winds, and its leaderâs career brought
to an ignominious end, by a bullet from the gun of
a mere boy. It is indeed hard to conceive how a
heart so young should have been so steeped in wickedness;
but his own history, written by his own hand
just before the wrath of an offended God overtook
him, cannot be denied.

232
It is a little singular that this man should have
lost his leg, in the streets of Hagerstown, at the
hands of one of the officers of the very command
that baulked him in his wholesale attempt at murder,
arson and outrage.

For the services rendered upon this occasion
Colonel Johnson won his rank as Brigadier General,
which had been so long denied him by the
Confederate Congress, although urged upon them
months before by General Jackson, who had kept
a vacancy in the Third Brigade open for him, and
had refused to assign the command to any one else.
This body of wise men contended that Maryland
had its share of general officers, and could have no
more, no matter how great the merit or ability the
applicant might present for their august consideration.
No, these important positions must be parcelled
out as a fisherwoman does her stock in trade,
and old and superannuated political hulks who
aspired to a command were to be served first. So
it was with the gallant Colonel Edwin Willis, of
Georgia, who was killed at Cold Harbor. This
young man, with a thorough military education,
and one of the most brilliant and comprehensive
minds in the South, and whose promotion had been
more than once urged, was compelled to act in a
subordinate capacity because Toombs and Cobb and
other useless political generals stood in his way.

233

CHAPTER VI.

On the 9th of May, 1864, Sheridan began his raid
around Richmond. Colonel Johnson, had gone
on a scout towards Yorktown, and left Colonel
Brown in camp in command of parts of four companies.
On the afternoon of that day Colonel
Brown received information that a portion of the
enemyâs cavalry were raiding in the rear of Leeâs
army, and had cut the railroad and destroyed the
cars and provisions accumulated at some point above
Hanover Court House. He immediately assembled
his little command of one hundred and fifty sabres,
and set out to ascertain the truth of the report.
Shortly after passing Hanover Junction the gleam
of camp fires in the distance, (it was just after
dark,) along the line of railway in his front, seemed
to confirm the rumor. The battalion pushed on
at a trot, taking the usual precaution to throw out
an advance guard and flankers, and about 11
oâclock, P. M., arrived at a point about a mile from
Beaver Dam, when it became evident that they
were in close proximity to a large force that was
taking no pains to conceal their presence. The
battalion was halted, and Colonel Brown himself
dismounted and went ahead on foot to reconnoitre.
He found the enemy in great glee, laughing and
shouting at the top of their voices, whilst at the
same time they were busily engaged in burning

234
railroad ties, and generally seemed to feel the existence
of an enemy to be an absurdity. So close
did Colonel Brown get to them, that he came near
surprising a party in a cut, and from where he
could see, by the light of the burning cross-ties,
for a mile or two along the road, whilst he was
invisible to the enemy. After having taken a good
view, he quietly returned to his command, which
had been silently awaiting him, and dismounting
all the men that could be spared, amounting to some
eighty or ninety, he advanced on the railroad.
Silently the little band crept on, carbine advanced,
and ready to begin the work of death at an instantâs
warning. Not a word was spoken; and the men
held their breaths in anxious expectation, until
right upon the bank of the railroad, when a whispered
exclamation announced that the enemy had
gone. Not far, though; for they could be plainly
heard a short distance up the road. The skirmish
party was then formed in column, and moved by the
left towards the county road, not a hundred yards
distant, with the intention to again deploy and
advance until the enemy was found. Not half the
column had crossed the fence which bounded the
road, when there was a challenge and shot, almost
simultaneous, followed by a volley from both sides.
In the darkness, blinded by the fires the enemy had
lighted, the head of the column had come suddenly
upon a Yankee picket, at a point which Colonel
Brown, not an half hour before, had found entirely

235
unguarded; but during his absence they had finished
their work and gone to bed, posting pickets,
in the meantime, from habit more than anything
else, as the picket was only a few yards from the
main body, which appeared to be resting in a continuous
line along and on both sides of the road.

Colonel Brown deployed at once, and advanced
rapidly, the whole line keeping up a vigorous fire,
which was made more effectual, because, while
being in the shadow themselves, the confused enemy
was distinctly visible by the light of the fires they
had built. This could be plainly seen, as in driving
the Yankees back they passed over the ground
which had been held by them, and found many dead
and wounded men and horses. Still pressing the
enemy back, Brown came to a skirt of woods, about
half a mile from the point where he first met them,
when a cavalry charge was made upon his thin line,
which, however, was handsomely repulsed, and the
enemy driven back in confusion. Passing through
this woods, he found them posted in great strength
on both sides of the road, in open fields, awaiting
his attack. Upon observing this, Colonel Brown
slowly withdrew his command unmolested.

He now ascertained, from evidence before him,
and from prisoners taken, that instead of fighting,
as he supposed, a small raiding party, he had
engaged the advance of Sheridanâs army of thirteen
thousand men. Mounting his men, he held his
ground until daylight, when a dispatch was

236
received from General J. E. B. Stuart, directing
Colonel Brown to harrass and delay the enemy as
long as possible, as he was in pursuit. Accordingly,
he at once advanced upon the enemyâs pickets and
drove them back, when they were reinforced, but
again driven back several times in succession, until
Sheridan pushed forward heavy reinforcements,
when Colonel Brown deemed it advisable to retire
a short distance, the enemy manifesting no disposition
to pursue. Thus for some time the opposing
forces watched each other in silence, when Brown
moved his men some distance to the rear to feed the
horses, but leaving a force of twenty men, under
command of Lieutenant C. Irving Ditty, to observe
their movements.

But a few moments elapsed before the enemy
became restive, and could be seen forming a strong
column in the road, with heavy masses on each side
of it, and clouds of mounted and dismounted skirmishers
taking position in front. The fact was at
once communicated to Colonel Brown. A bugle
sound now announced the enemyâs approach, and
the heavy columns moved forward in imposing
array upon Dittyâs little force of twenty men. At
this instant Brown came up at a gallop, and a spirited
fight ensued. A dozen times did the column
of mounted men attack, but a dozen times they
were foiled and driven back in confusion, until the
dismounted men moved through the woods on
Brownâs flank, and compelled him to retire; and at

237
last, about midday, they forced him back beyond
the woods into the clear country, where Sheridan
could see the insignificant force that had for so
many precious hours kept his army in check. Then,
and not until then, could his cavalry be brought to
a charge, which the First Maryland, from its better
knowledge of the country, easily avoided, not,
however, without a parting volley, which emptied
several saddles, two riderless horses running into
their ranks.

The battalion then hurried on rapidly to Hanover
Junction, whither it was supposed Sheridan was
moving, where they united with the Second Maryland
Infantry and Baltimore Light Artillery, when
all prepared to give a good account of themselves
should the enemy make his appearance.

It was but a little band of brave men opposing
an immense army, and their destruction seemed
inevitable, for General Lee had dispatched them
to hold the point to the last, and that he had no
reinforcements to give them. Quietly, as they stood
in line of battle, they discussed the matter, and
determined that the Maryland Line of â64 should
reflect no disgrace upon their hereditary name. But
they were saved the sacrifice, for Sheridan, passing
six or eight miles in their rear, marched directly
upon Richmond.

In this affair at Beaver Dam, Captain A. H.
Schwartz, of Company F, and Lieutenant J. A. V.
Pue, of Company A, were painfully but not dangerously

238
wounded, almost by the first fire. During
the lull of hostilities, and before daylight, they were
removed to the house of Mr. Redd, a kind Virginia
gentleman, living about five miles from the scene
of conflict. Here they were kindly cared for and
rapidly improved, when General Lee fell back in
the direction of Richmond, and they were left in
the enemyâs lines, who immediately sent a force of
two hundred cavalry to capture them. Upon an
examination of their condition by the surgeon with
the party, he declared it his belief that they would
die if removed; but the officer in command, who
seemed really ashamed of his brutal mission, said
those were his orders, and he must obey them.
However, he at last yielded to the entreaties of the
ladies of the family, and reported the facts to General
Gibbons, who, like the brute he is, gave
imperative

orders for their removal. This was done, and
the two poor, suffering men were placed in an ambulance
and started off, the guard stealing the
covering thrown over them by the ladies of Mr.
Reddâs family, before they had gone five miles.
Being taken across the country to Fredericksburg,
they were there placed on board a transport and
conveyed to a Washington hospital, where, soon
after their arrival, the gallant, whole-souled Captain
Schwartz died, in great agony, and Lieutenant Pue
suffered months of excruciating pain.

This is but another instance of the many thousands
of Yankee brutality to Confederate prisoners, and

239
yet these people prate continually about Confederate
cruelty to prisoners of war.

On the day after the fight at Beaver Dam, General
J. E. B. Stuart came up, and ordered Colonel
Johnson to watch General Leeâs flank with the First
Maryland cavalry, whilst he with twenty-five hundred
horse threw himself between Sheridan and
Richmond.

Stuart met the enemy at Yellow Tavern, and
after one of the most dreadful cavalry combats of the
war, he saved the capital, but lost his life.

In the latter part of May, Leeâs army fell back
before Grant, and made Hanover Junction a point
of defence. Sending for Colonel Johnson, he directed
him to take Brownâs battalion and pass
around Grant and see what he was doing, and especially
his base of supplies. The little Command
crossed the North Anna, below Leeâs right, and
pursued its way around to Penola Station, on the
Fredericksburg railroad, where Johnson discovered
a heavy column moving down from Bowling Green,
and at the same time ascertained that the enemy
drew his supplies from Tappahannock. Turning to
retrace his steps, he found the whole of Sheridanâs
cavalry moving up through King William, in his
rear, and all the fords on the lower Anna in his
possession. This compelled him to cross higher up,
which was effected by throwing the horses into the
stream from a high bank, whilst the men crossed on
a raft hastily constructed. He finally reached the

240
main body in safety, having captured several couriers,
from whom it was ascertained that Sheridan
was coming up and Burnside moving down from
Bowling Green.

On the 27th of May, Colonel Johnson was ordered
to report with his cavalry to General Fitzhugh Lee,
who was then at Hanover Court House. A short
time after his arrival, the enemy crossed at Dabneyâs
Ferry, when by order of General Lomax he was directed
to go down and drive them back. Upon his
arrival, he found Colonel Baker, of the Fifth North
Carolina, in command of Gordonâs old brigade, skirmishing
with a force not far from the Ferry. Believing
it to be a small body, it was arranged that
Baker should hold them where they were, whilst
Johnson passed around to their flank, by which
movement it was hoped they would capture the
whole of them. Taking a side road, he had not
gone more than a mile before he encountered Bakerâs
pickets retiring in good order, followed by the
enemy. Before he could deploy his men on some
open ground on the side of the road, they were upon
him in overwhelming force. The greater part of the
battalion had unfortunately just passed through a
gate into a field when the enemy attacked. A
dreadful hand to hand fight ensued, and before the
gate could be reopened for them to retreat, many
were killed and wounded, among the latter the
brave Brown, by several sabre cuts over the head.
Being at length extricated from this dilemma, the

241
command was drawn up on more favorable ground,
and a determined stand made for thirty minutes.
But it was soon perceived that the enemy were
wrapping around the little battalion and threatening
it with destruction, and the order was given to
retreat. This was conducted for a time in an orderly
manner, but the enemy pressing them hard, a
rout ensued, in which every man was expected to
look out for himself.

The battalion lost in this unfortunate affair between
fifty and sixty men in killed, wounded, and
prisoners. Colonel Johnson and Lieutenant Colonel
Brown made narrow escapes, the former having his
horse killed and his sabre shot away, whilst the
latter received several severe cuts over the head. If
unfortunate for the Maryland battalion, however, it
was fortunate for Baker, whose brigade of North
Carolinians would most assuredly have been cut to
pieces had the enemy not been held in check for a
full half hour, thereby enabling them to escape.
The force encountered turned out to be Custerâs brigade
of four thousand men, supported by the rest of
Merrittâs division of cavalry.

Among the officers captured at the fight at Pollardâs
Farm, as it is called, was First Lieutenant
George Howard, of company C, the particulars of
which are too good to be lost, although it does seem
near akin to profanity to laugh when so many were
made to weep.

It appears that the Lieutenant, who could never

242
be induced to don a uniform or ride a fast horse,
finding himself hard pressed in the general rout,
quietly dropped off unperceived, and concealed himself
in a strip of woods that skirted the roadside.
The pursuers passed by without observing him, and
he began to congratulate himself upon his narrow
escape, when unfortunately two or three straggling
troopers stumbled upon his place of concealment.
It was instantly suggested to him to pass himself
off as a farmer of the neighborhood, and his appearance
and dress indicated as much. To an inquiry
of one of the Yankee soldiers as to âwhat he was
doing there?â he replied that âa fight had taken
place on his farm between their fellows and some
Rebs, and he had sought the woods for safety.â

The party believed it, and in company they rode
down to the scene of conflict, when the first object
that met his gaze was one of his own men sitting in
a fence corner, severely wounded. Forgetting himself,
and the enemy with him, and yielding to the
impulses of his generous nature, he threw himself
from his horse, and advancing to the side of the suffering
man called him by name, and inquired if he
was much hurt.

âPretty badly,
Lieutenant
,â was the reply, and the
next minute he found himself seized, and a prisoner
in the hands of his late companions.

âLieutenant, ah!â exclaimed one of them, in
utter amazement, and glancing first at rider and
then at horse, â
well, I must say that some of you
Reb officers do beat the devil on a make-up
!â

243

CHAPTER VII.

For the next few days the battalion was engaged
in skirmishing about Hanover Court House, the
enemy occupying them there whilst his columns were
crossing at Dabneyâs Ferry, and pressing on towards
Richmond.

On the 1st of June, the enemy moved on the South
Anna bridges, Johnsonâs small command of one
hundred and fifty sabres and Griffithâs battery contesting
every foot of ground, in a fight from daylight
until two oâclock in the afternoon, when they
were driven back by a brigade of the enemyâs
cavalry.

It now becomes my painful duty to record the
death of one of the best and purest of men, Lieutenant
Colonel Ridgely Brown, who in the dayâs fight
was struck in the head by a stray ball and instantly
killed. The death of this good and generous man
was a sad blow to his little command, by whom he
was almost idolized, and Johnson lost an officer who
had been invaluable to him, for to his sound judgment
and advice he was much indebted for his success
in the affair with Kilpatrick.

In a General Order issued on the 6th of June,
Colonel Johnson thus speaks of his death:

244
Headquarters Maryland Line
, }

June 6, 1864.               }

General Order No. 26.

Lieutenant Colonel Ridgely Brown, commanding First Maryland
cavalry, fell in battle on the 1st instant, near the South Anna.
He died, as a soldier prefers to die, leading his men in a victorious
charge. As an officer, kind and careful; as a soldier, brave and
true; as a gentleman, chivalrous; as a Christian, gentle and
modest; no one in the Confederate army surpassed him in the
hold he had on the hearts of his men, and the place in the esteem
of his superiors. Of the rich blood that Maryland has lavished on
every battle field, none is more precious than this, and that of our
other brave comrades in arms who fell during the four days previous
on the hill sides of Hanover. His command has lost a friend
most steadfast, but his commanding officer is deprived of an assistant
invaluable. To the first he was ever as careful as a father;
to the latter as true as a brother.

In token of respect to his memory, the colors of the different
regiments of this command will be draped, and the officers wear
the usual badge of military mourning for thirty days.

By order of      Colonel Bradley T. Johnson.

GEO. W. BOOTH, A. A. G.

A correspondent in the Richmond
Sentinel
, who
signs himself âA Virginian,â pays the following
handsome tribute to his memory:

Of the many brave and noble men who have fought the invaders
of Southern soil, and have died in defence of Southern homes
and Southern rights, none deserve a higher tribute of praise, or a
larger measure of thanks from the Southern people than Colonel
Brown. A native of Montgomery county, Maryland, and a citizen
of that State, at the commencement of the present war, it
would have been but natural for him to have taken the passive
attitude which was assumed by his State, where he would now in
all probability be gladdening by his presence a large circle of relatives
and friends, instead of throwing dark shadows around their
hearts from his lowly grave in Virginia. But like many other

245
noble sons of Maryland, he left his quiet and secure home to give
his services to the Southern Confederacy, threatened with subjugation,
and even extermination. He labored day and night in its
service, and has poured out his lifeâs blood upon its altar.

He came to Virginia on the first day of June, 1861, and was
mortally wounded on the first day of June, 1864, just three years
after. He entered the army in the capacity of a private. In less
than a year he was raised to the position of a lieutenant; he soon
reached the rank of captain, and was then promoted to a lieutenant
colonelcy. To each of those positions he was lifted by merit
alone, and would probably have soon reached much higher rank,
had not envious death closed his career.

Never was there an officer more beloved by his command, and
never was there one who more deserved it. As brave as a lion in
time of danger, he was as careful of his men as a mother of her
children. His men say that when thrown upon his own responsibility
he never led them into a position of peril without first examining
it himself; nor ordered them to go where he was not
ready to lead; and they felt perfectly secure under his leadership.
After his promotion to the command of a regiment of cavalry, it
was remarked that he was much more silent than before. A
friend asked him the reason. He replied that so many lives committed
to his charge involved a responsibility which pressed
heavily upon him.

He was a Christian man, and death has been his gain. The
loss is all to those who remain behindâto his parents, who have
lost a devoted son; to his acquaintances, who have lost one of
friendshipâs greatest treasures; to the Confederacy, which has lost
one of its most valuable defenders. But more than thisâmorality
has lost one of its best examplars, and chivalry one of her noblest
sons. His influence for good in his command, who can supply?

Many soldiers and many citizens will mingle their tears on his
grave, to water the flowers which friendship and affection will
plant there; and when flowers shall wither, his memory will continue
to bloom in many hearts.

A VIRGINIAN.

Hampton having been assigned to the command
of the cavalry, in the place of Stuart, he on the 12th
of June, with four thousand five hundred sabres,
met Sheridan at Trevillianâs Station with thirteen
thousand. The First Maryland was posted on

246
Hamptonâs extreme left to support General Rosser.
The first charge of the enemy was made by the
dashing Custer, at the head of his brigade, and he
went through Hamptonâs centre, creating terrible
confusion among the led horses and ordnance
wagons; but the daring and intrepid Rosser was in
his way, and charging him in turn with his brigade
and the First Maryland, he cut him in two, and
pursued him to his very wagon train, capturing his
private papers, and effectually breaking up his brigade.
This charge of Rosserâs is pronounced one of
the most brilliant of the many made during the
war.

The battle of Trevillianâs lasted two days, and
was the hardest cavalry fight of the war, and
although Hampton fought great odds, Sheridan suffered
a terrible defeat. During these two days, the
Maryland battalion was in the thickest of the fight,
and fought as though to avenge their comrades who
had fallen at Pollardâs Farm. And they were
avenged, for in that bloody struggle many a Federal
soldier felt the weight of their sabres or fell at
the crack of their unerring revolvers, and two hundred
prisoners and horses fell into their hands.

During the winter of â63â4, Colonel Johnson
originated a plan for capturing President Lincoln,
which he suggested to General Hampton, who, after
several conversations with Johnson upon the subject,
gave it his approval, and entered heartily into
the undertaking.

247
The Confederate spies in Washington had kept
General Lee thoroughly posted as to the disposition
and force of every command of the enemy in and
around his capital. To carry out this daring enterprise
then, Colonel Johnson was to take the Maryland
battalion, numbering two hundred and fifty
sabres, and cross the Potomac above Georgetown,
make a dash at a battalion of cavalry known to be
stationed there, and push on to the Soldierâs Home,
where it was well known Lincoln lived, and after
capturing him send him across the river in charge
of a body of picked men, whilst the main body was
to cut the wires and roads between Washington and
Baltimore, and then move back through Western
Maryland to the Valley of Virginia; or if that
means of retreat was cut off, Johnson was to go up
into Pennsylvania, and on west to West Virginia
beyond Grafton. It seemed, indeed, a most desperate
undertaking, but everything promised its
successful accomplishment. Indeed, so sanguine
was Hampton that the plan of Johnson would succeed,
that he wanted to undertake it himself at the
head of four thousand horse, and was only prevented
by Sheridanâs advance upon the Confederate capital.

After the fight at Trevillianâs, then, he gave
Johnson orders to prepare for the trip. The best
horses in the cavalry command were selected, and
the best men in the battalion picked out, but whilst
shoeing his horses and recruiting his men in Goochland
county, he was prevented from carrying out

248
his much cherished plans by an order from General
Early to join him at once with his battalion in the
Valley, and cover his rear whilst that General went
after Hunter, who had marched upon Lynchburg.

In a week Early returned to Staunton, and it was
then that Colonel Johnson received his long delayed
commission as Brigadier General of cavalry, and was
at once assigned to the command of the brigade formerly
commanded by W. E. Jones, who had been
killed at the battle fought near New Hope.

Much to his gratification he was given permission,
on the 3d day of July, to attach the First Maryland
to his brigade, and then ordered to take the advance
of Earlyâs army, moving on Martinsburg. At
Leetown the brigade encountered Mulliganâs advance,
and after a severe fight the enemy was driven
back with loss. In this affair the First Maryland
fought with its accustomed vim.

On the 5th of July General Johnson crossed the
Potomac at Sharpsburg, where he met a small force
of the enemyâs cavalry, which Lieutenant George
M. E. Shearer, with a detachment of the First
Maryland, pursued into Hagerstown, where coming
suddenly upon a superior force he was compelled to
retreat upon the main body.

In the pursuit which ensued Shearer was taken
prisoner, along with several of his men.

General Johnson now shaped his course in the
direction of Frederick, in the vicinity of which he
awaited the arrival of Early, who overtook him on
the 8th.

249
On the 9th, General Early dispatched General
Johnson on a secret service by special order from
General Lee. In this order he was directed to destroy
communication between Baltimore and the
North, threaten Baltimore, and break the railroad
and cut the telegraph wires between Baltimore and
Washington, and thence move on Point Lookout so
as to attack on the morning of the 12th, when an
attack was also to be made on the sea side. After releasing
the prisoners, some fifteen thousand, he was
to take command of them and rejoin Early at Bladensburg,
whilst that General was in the meantime
to attack Washington and carry it by assault.

Johnson moved his whole force to Cockeysville,
and after destroying the bridges there he detached
the First Maryland and Gilmorâs battalion, the two
having been temporarily consolidated, and all under
Colonel Gilmorâs command, and directed that officer
to burn the railroad bridges over the Bush and
Gunpowder rivers, which he did. Johnson then
moved rapidly around Baltimore, and at Beltsville
found a force of about one thousand of the
enemyâs cavalry, which he charged and drove into
Bladensburg, after which he started for Point Lookout,
but had not gone many miles when he received
an order from General Early to join him at once.

At Cockeysville Johnson had learned that the
19th corps of the enemy was landing at Locust
Point, of which fact he at once advised Early, and
it was this information which compelled the Confederate

250
General to forego the intended raid on
Point Lookout, and which had reached him just as
he was about to assault Washington with his whole
army.

In obedience to this order, General Johnson retraced
his steps, and joined Early next morning at
Blairâs house.

Early now turned his back on the Yankee capital,
and directed his steps towards the Potomac, and
crossed near Poolsville. In the retreat from Maryland,
General Johnson was ordered to protect his
rear. At Rockville he charged the enemyâs cavalry,
and beat him, capturing eighty prisoners and horses.
At Poolsville he was vigorously attacked in force,
but drove his assailants back, and kept them in
check until the whole army had recrossed the river.

It will thus be seen that General Johnsonâs brigade
constituted the advance guard in the invasion of
Maryland, and the rear guard in the retreat. The
Maryland troops were placed at the head of the
column in the first and the rear in the latter; thus,
from the 5th of July, the day of crossing, to the
14th, the day of recrossing the Potomac, they were
almost constantly engaged, and always closest to
the enemy.

251

CHAPTER VIII.

Soon after the return of the army under Early
from Maryland, that General determined to send
McCausland on an expedition into Pennsylvania,
with his own and General Johnsonâs brigades, for
what purpose will be seen by the following extract
from his âMemoirs of the Last Year of the War for
Independence:â

âOn the 26th of July, we moved to Martinsburg, the cavalry
going to the Potomac. The 27th and 28th were employed in destroying
the railroad, it having been repaired since we passed over
it at the beginning of the month. While at Martinsburg it was
ascertained, beyond all doubt, that Hunter had been again indulging
in his favorite mode of warfare, and that, after his return
to the Valley, while we were near Washington, among other outrages,
the private residences of Mr. Andrew Hunter, a member of
the Virginia Senate, Mr. Alexander R. Boteler, an ex-member of
the Confederate Congress, as well as of the United States Congress,
and Edmund I. Lee, a distant relative of General Lee, all in Jefferson
county, with their contents, had been burned by his orders,
only time enough being given for the ladies to get out of the
houses. A number of towns in the South, as well as private
country houses, had been burned by the Federal troops, and the
accounts had been heralded forth in some of the Northern papers
in terms of exultation, and gloated over by their readers, while
they were received with apathy by others.

âI now came to the conclusion that we had stood this mode of
warfare long enough, and that it was time to open the eyes of the
people of the North to its enormity, by an example in the way of
retaliation. I did not select the cases mentioned, as having more
merit or greater claims for retaliation than others, but because

252
they had occurred within the limits of the country covered by my
command, and were brought more immediately to my attention.

âThe town of Chambersburg, in Pennsylvania, was selected as
the one on which retaliation should be made, and McCausland
was ordered to proceed with his brigade and that of Johnson, and
a battery of artillery, to that place, and demand of the municipal
authorities the sum of $100,000 in gold, or $500,000 in United
States currency, as a compensation for the destruction of the
houses named and their contents, and, in default of payment,
to lay the town in ashes, in retaliation for the burning of those
houses and others in Virginia, as well as for the towns which had
been burned in other Southern States. A written demand to that
effect was sent to the municipal authorities, and they were informed
what would be the result of a failure or refusal to comply
with it. I desired to give the people of Chambersburg an opportunity
of saving their town, by making compensation for part of
the injury done, and hoped that the payment of such a sum would
have the desired effect, and open the eyes of the people of other
towns at the North, to the necessity of urging upon their government
the adoption of a different policy. McCausland was also
directed to proceed from Chambersburg towards Cumberland,
Md., and levy contributions in money upon that and other towns
able to bear them, and if possible destroy the machinery at the
coal pits near Cumberland, and the machine shops, depots, and
bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, as far as practicable.

âOn the 29th, McCausland crossed the Potomac, near Clear
Spring, above Williamsport, and I moved with Rhodesâ and Ramseurâs
divisions and Vaughanâs cavalry to the latter place, while
Imboden demonstrated with his and Jacksonâs cavalry towards
Harperâs Ferry, in order to withdraw attention from McCausland.
Breckinridge remained at Martinsburg, and continued the destruction
of the railroad. Vaughan drove a force of cavalry from
Williamsport, and went into Hagerstown, where he captured and
destroyed a train of cars loaded with supplies. One of Rhodesâ
brigades was crossed over at Williamsport, and subsequently
withdrawn.

253
âOn the 30th, McCausland being well underway, I moved
back to Martinsburg; and on the 31st, the whole infantry force
was moved to Bunker Hill, where we remained on the 1st, 2d, and
3d of August.

âOn the 4th, in order to enable McCausland to retire from
Pennsylvania and Maryland, and to keep Hunter, who had been
reinforced by the 6th and 19th corps, and had been oscillating between
Harperâs Ferry and Monocacy Junction, in a state of uncertainty,
I again moved to the Potomac, with the infantry and
Vaughanâs and Jacksonâs cavalry, while Imboden demonstrated
towards Harperâs Ferry.

âOn the 5th, Rhodesâ and Ramseurâs divisions crossed at Williamsport,
and took position near St. Jamesâ College, and Vaughanâs
cavalry went into Hagerstown. Breckinridge, with his command
and Jacksonâs cavalry, crossed at Shepherdstown, and took position
at Sharpsburg. This position is in full view from Maryland
Heights, and a cavalry force was sent out by the enemy to reconnoitre,
which after skirmishing with Jacksonâs cavalry, was driven
off by the sharpshooters of Gordonâs division.

âOn the 6th, the whole force recrossed the Potomac at Williamsport,
and moved towards Martinsburg; and on the 7th, we
returned to Bunker Hill.

âOn the 30th of July, McCausland reached Chambersburg, and
made the demand as directed, reading to such of the authorities
as presented themselves the paper sent by me. The demand was
not complied with, the people stating that they were not afraid of
having their town burned, and that a Federal force was approaching.
The policy pursued by our army on former occasions had
been so lenient, that they did not suppose the threat was in
earnest this time, and they hoped for speedy relief. McCausland,
however, proceeded to carry out his orders, and the greater part
of the town was laid in ashes.

âFor this act I alone am responsible, as the officers engaged in
it were simply executing my orders, and had no discretion left
them. Notwithstanding the lapse of time which has occurred,

254
and the result of the war, I am perfectly satisfied with my conduct
on this occasion, and see no reason to regret it.

âMcCausland then moved in the direction of Cumberland, but
on approaching that town, he found it defended by a force under
Kelly, too strong for him to attack, and he withdrew towards
Hampshire county, in Virginia, and crossed the Potomac near the
mouth of the South Branch, capturing the garrison at that place,
and partially destroying the railroad bridge. He then invested
the post on the railroad at New Creek, but finding it too strongly
fortified to take by assault, he moved to Moorefield, in Hardy
county, near which place he halted to rest and recruit his men
and horses, as the command was now considered safe from pursuit.
Averill, however, had been pursuing from Chambersburg
with a body of cavalry, and Johnsonâs brigade was surprised in
camp, before day, on the morning of the 7th of August, and
routed by Averillâs force. This resulted also in the rout of
McCauslandâs brigade, and the loss of the artillery, (four pieces,)
and about three hundred prisoners from the whole command.
The balance of the command made its way to Mount Jackson in
great disorder, and much weakened. This affair had a very damaging
effect upon my cavalry for the rest of the campaign.â

McCausland had not the manliness to take the
responsibility of this surprise, which was brought
about by his own neglect and incaution, but sought
to throw the blame upon Johnson, who demanded a
court of inquiry, but it was not allowed. McCausland
was the commanding officer, and Johnson his
subordinate. He had selected the camp and posted
his pickets, and was of course bound to keep himself
advised of the position and propinquity of the enemy,
and to advise his subordinate of danger. He never
did keep himself so informed; the only intimation

255
he ever gave was a mere verbal one by a courier, at
two oâclock at night, that Averill was at Romney,
thirty miles off, the evening before, and to be ready
and saddle up by daylight. The order conveyed no
intimation of danger, and General McCausland had
no such idea, for he slept three miles away from his
camp, and was absent when his command was
attacked.

Soon after the Moorefield affair Earlyâs army moved
to Fisherâs Hill, when Gilmor (with whom the First
Maryland was still serving) was ordered to scout in
his front. Shortly after Sheridan retreated to Winchester,
beyond which place Early pursued him. A
series of severe encounters ensued with the enemyâs
cavalry in the vicinity of Winchester, Martinsburg,
Bunker Hill, Leetown and Charlestown, in which
the First Maryland took a prominent part, losing
heavily.

One of the heaviest of these fights I will here
speak of at length, as it has been most strangely
misrepresented by Colonel Gilmor in his âFour
Years in the Saddle.â The fight at Bunker Hill
is the one alluded to, where Colonel Gilmor says
the First Maryland ârefused to charge when ordered
by him.â The facts are these:

On the morning of the 13th of August, 1864, a
brigade of Lomaxâs command (to which was attached
the First Maryland and Gilmorâs cavalry,
all under command of Gilmor,) had advanced and
driven in the enemyâs pickets, and pushed back his

256
cavalry several miles below Bunker Hill, where
they halted for a while and then turned to retrace
their steps. The enemy in the meanwhile had been
heavily reinforced, and pressed hard upon the
retreating column, of which the First Maryland
formed the rear. The enemy became more and
more pressing as they advanced, until a charge was
ordered by Colonel Gilmor, which had the effect of
checking them, and his vastly superior force only
saved him from rout. These charges had to be repeated
again and again, the First Maryland retiring
excellent order at a walk. When the stream which
crosses the pike at Bunker Hill was reached, Gilmor,
who had been much delayed, of course, in
making these charges, found himself entirely unsupported,
all the other regiments of the brigade
having retired to the shelter of the infantry, which
was formed in line about a mile distant. At this
juncture the head of the enemyâs column, immediately
in the rear of the battalion, had entered the
stream before the rear of the First Maryland had
reached the opposite bank, two other of his columns
meanwhile moving unopposed parallel to the pike,
and were at least a mile in the rear of the little
band battling with ten times their number. At
this most critical period, right in the midst of the
stream, the battalion wheeled and again charged,
meeting the enemy midway, when a most desperate
hand to hand fight ensued, the blood of both intermingling
with its current. For some minutes they

257
held the enemy in check, expecting reinforcements,
but none were available, and under the desperate
nature of the circumstances General Lomax ordered
a battery, near the line of battle which the infantry
was forming, to open on the struggling mass. The
artillery officer remonstrated, as he was satisfied he
would damage friend as well foe; but the order was
repeated. The first few shots fell in the ranks of
the enemy, and rendered material aid to the handful
of heroes in such imminent peril, but unfortunately
a shell at last struck right in their midst, when, of
course, the battalion broke. The fire of a foe in front
and a friend in rear was more than human nature
could withstand; but even then they did not leave
the field, but retired, stubbornly contesting every
foot of ground, until they reached a house standing
in a field near the pike, and midway between Bunker
Hill and the infantry line, where some of the
command formed on both sides, which they were
obliged to do to confront the now rapidly advancing
enemy. Here a stand was made, and the fight
continued for sometime. On the side of the house
next the pike was the color bearer of the battalion,
Colonel Gilmor, Captain Ditty, Captain Raisin and
some fifteen or twenty officers and men, and it becoming
evident that they could no longer hold the
enemy at bay, Colonel Gilmor turned to this handful
and exclaimed, âWeâll go at them again,â but
had not moved five steps, the battalion at his heels,
before he dropped his pistol and wheeled around,

258
the blood streaming from his neck, and galloped
off, saying as he did so, âIâm killed.â Seeing the
folly of remaining longer, the command retired
upon the infantry, which easily repulsed the enemyâs
cavalry. This was the last order to charge given
that day, and most faithfully was it obeyed, even
by twenty against a thousand.

This is a correct statement of the matter, and it
is much to be regretted that Colonel Gilmor
should be the only man who ever preferred such a
charge or cast a reflection upon the fair fame of the
First Maryland, every man of which was a hero of
an hundred battles, and would follow where any
man dared to lead.

In this desperate fight I have to record the death
of the gallant Lieutenant Henry Blackiston, of
company B, who fell while performing prodigies of
valor. Poor fellow, he was universally beloved, and
his death deeply regretted by his companions.

After this affair, great dissatisfaction was produced
in the First Maryland by an order of General
Earlyâs consolidating the command, then very much
reduced, with Gilmorâs irregular cavalry, and placing
the whole under that officer. The entire battalion
remonstrated against what they conceived to be the
injustice done them, and all the officers tendered their
resignations except one, and that one acted upon
the conviction that resignation was not the proper
remedy of the wrong, which he condemned as fully
as any one. None of the resignations were accepted,

259
when the objection to the consolidation was urged
at the Department in Richmond so earnestly that
the order was revoked, and the command severed
from the connection with Gilmor, and returned to its
original status.

Soon after Captain G. W. Dorsey was assigned to
the command of the battalion, with the rank of
Lieutenant Colonel, to fill the vacancy occasioned
by the death of the lamented Ridgely Brown.
Major R. C. Smith, who had been permanently disabled
in the fight at Greenland Gap, was retired,
and the vacancy thus occasioned not afterwards
filled.

After Colonel Dorseyâs accession to the command,
the campaign was constantly active, and the enemy
being nearly as strong in cavalry alone as General
Early was in troops of all arms, his cavalry was
compelled to contend with great odds. Fights and
skirmishes of a greater or less magnitude were of
daily and almost hourly occurrence, and with the
picket duty to be performed, men and horses were,
employed to the utmost limit of endurance. In
most of these engagements the Confederates were
successful, but in one of them, at Fisherâs Hill,
on the 22d of September, the enemy gained considerable
advantage by suddenly throwing a heavy
force, consisting of two or three divisions, which he
had moved up under cover of the North Mountains
on Earlyâs left, upon the line of dismounted cavalry,
which was all that General could spare to cover that

260
point. Here, after they had broken the Confederate
line, Colonel Dorsey ordered the First Maryland to
charge, with the view to check the enemy, if possible,
and gain time to bring up reinforcements, but
it only availed to release some prisoners and to get
the horses of the dismounted men out of the way.
In the face of such odds, Dorsey was forced back
with some loss, and although severely wounded himself,
extricated his command, and made an orderly
retreat.

CHAPTER IX.

The campaign of â64 in the Valley of Virginia
was marked by acts of barbarism and savage
cruelty on the part of the enemy, such as history
scarcely parallels; but certainly not in the annals
of any nation making the least pretense to civilization.
In years past, the American heart was wont
to burn with righteous indignation at the recital of
the wrongs of Poland and Hungary; but then Russia
and Austria were but in their rudiments. It
was reserved for the âbest government the world
ever sawâ to reduce barbarity to a science, to substitute
the torch for the sword, murder for honorable
warfare, and to elevate the incendiaryâs crime to the
dignity of national policy. Having failed to subdue

261
the men of the Southern Confederacy in the field,
the soldiers of the Federal army, with such vast
odds in their favor, of numbers and resources, with
the whole world open to them, and contributing
immensely both of men and meansâthe Federal
soldiers, with all these advantages, descended to
make mean war upon women and children and
dumb brutes, seeking in the sufferings of these helpless
victims the victory elsewhere denied them, and
thus to strike their foe whom they dared not meet in
fair conflict.

An official, high in rank in that army, and at
this writing high in position under that Government,
wrote that the Valley should be so devastated
âthat a crow flying over would be obliged to take its
rations.â And faithful and vigorous were the efforts
made to carry out that policy. The Vandals, whose
name has become a synonym for ferocious cruelty,
were accustomed to spare the ungarnered crops not
required for their own maintenance; but by official
orders from army headquarters, Sheridanâs army in
the Valley of Virginia obscured the light of day, and
illuminated the darkness of night, with the smoke
and flames of the conflagration that devoured alike
the dwelling and the stable, the barn and the mill,
stored with hay and grain, and the yet ungathered
crop standing on the ground. Whole fields of corn
were wantonly fired in the shock, and in many instances
horses and cattle in their stalls, and swine in
their pens, were heartlessly burned alive. For two

262
weeks and more did their fires fiercely burn, while
the brave officers commanding this corps of murderers
and incendiaries made report of their noble
achievements, and the Yankee nation applauded.
It was rebels, rebels against this most beneficent
Government, who suffered, and in their pangs was
offered a sacrifice holy and acceptable on the altar of

Freedom
. Truly
Vandalism
should be expunged
from our vocabulary, and
Yankeeism
written instead.

General Hunter, whose chief monument was the
smoke from the Virginia Military Institute, and the
private dwellings burned by his order, had the honor
of inaugurating this system of warfare in the Valley,
which was afterwards so fully adopted and elaborately
carried out by the Yankee Government.

All these brutal wrongs the First Maryland cavalry
witnessed, and where powerless to prevent,
they did not forget to avenge where opportunity
offered.

Other wrongs they had to remember and avenge,
such as their whole prior experience had never
before knownâthe cold-blooded murder of their
comrades.

In October, 1864, Churchill Crittenden and John
Hartigan, privates of company C, were detailed to
procure provisions for their company, which could
only be obtained from the neighboring farm houses.
The regiment was lying then in Page county, and
as the country between the two armies had not been
foraged so closely of its supplies, because of its being

263
a middle ground, these two men, so detailed, sought
the required rations between the two lines. Whilst
getting their supplies at a farm house, a large
scouting party of the enemy came suddenly upon
them. They attempted to escape, and a running
fight ensued, which resulted in the death of two or
three of the enemy and the wounding of Crittenden
severely, and the capture of both himself and
Hartigan.

The prisoners were taken back two or three miles,
and there by order of General Powell, then commanding
Averillâs old brigade, shot in cold blood,
denying them the poor privilege of writing to their
friends, though Hartigan, particularly, who had a
young and lovely wife, earnestly entreated with his
last breath to be allowed to send her a message.

These facts were all carefully traced out, and verified
by the statement of the citizen at whose house
the two men were first attacked, and near which
they fought and were captured; by the statement of
the citizen, some two miles to the rear, near whose
house they were buried, not by the assassins, but by
the pitying farmer; and by the evidence rendered
by the opened graves of the poor murdered men.

From that time, General Powellâs name was
familiar to the ears and memories of the First Maryland
cavalry, and many were the vows there uttered
over the dead bodies of their comrades to avenge
their deathâand they were fearfully avenged,
though the chief assassin escaped.

264
In November, 1864, the battalion, now in General
Davidsonâs brigade of Lomaxâs division, crossed the
mountain and camped near Washington, in Rappahannock
county, in order to obtain supplies, which
were now exceedingly scarce. For days at a time
the only food was apples and bread made of corn
meal of such miserable quality as to be utterly
inedible except under pressure of the direst necessity.
Coffee and sugar had long before disappearedâso
long that it was a real effort of memory
to recall their flavorâand the taste of meat was
now a matter of rare occurrence, and then often obtained
by the capture of a bewildered squirrel or
rabbit, or the
accidental falling of a tree
on some
luckless hog, which happened oftener than people
would suppose or believe who are unacquainted with
the pertinacity with which that animal will haunt
a cavalry camp to steal from the horses, and at
which they have often been known to be killed by a

kick
. Apples were, however, in abundance, and
excellent, and assisted greatly in keeping up the
commissariat.

Supplies of all kinds, however, were exhausted
in two or three weeks, and the battalion moved
back to the neighborhood of Madison Court House.
Here it remained until December, when General
Davidson was relieved by General Jackson, the
former General having been only temporarily in
command during the absence, while wounded, of
the latter, the proper commander of the brigade.

265
At this time the enemy made a simultaneous advance
upon Madison Court House, Staunton and
Charlottesville, at which latter place Custerâs division
of cavalry was fought by Brethodâs battery of
horse artillery, composed mainly of Maryland soldiers,
without support of any kind; and so bold
and vigorous was their defence that Custer retired
with loss, under the impression that a large force
confronted him. The column advancing upon
Madison Court House, consisting of two divisions,
was engaged and held in check nearly a day by
Jacksonâs brigade, the fight having begun in the
morning and lasted until 9 P. M. The battle was
closed by a charge of the First Maryland upon the
left flank of the enemy, which was most advanced.
The charge was made less effective by reason of the
leading squadrons stumbling into a deep and wide
ditch, which, owing to the darkness, could not be
seen until too late to prevent the horses from falling.
But although not damaging the enemy to
the extent hoped for, it had the effect to break and
scatter his line in confusion, and keep him quiet for
the balance of the night.

After waiting for some time for further demonstrations
from the enemy, and there being none,
General Jackson quietly withdrew his brigade a few
miles, and the men lay down in the snow, which
covered the ground to the depth of ten inches, to
get a little rest. In the meantime General Lomax,
who had been notified in the beginning of the

266
enemyâs advance, was assembling at Liberty Mills
his different brigades, which had necessarily been
scattered in order to subsist. By daylight General
Jackson was moving to that point, where, after
partaking of some food, the troops were directed to
throw up rude breastworks, which was done by
piling fence rails along the banks of the stream.
This had scarcely been accomplished when the
enemy made his appearance and deployed most
beautifully on the opposite hills, when a brisk skirmish
began, which continued all day and until
night, when the exhausted troops were ordered to
unsaddle and seek some rest, but they had barely
dismounted when a courier dashed up and reported
that the enemy had crossed the stream, and that
they were to be charged at once. In an instant the
gallant troopers sprang to their horses, and Jacksonâs
brigade dashed at the enemyâs advance. For
some time the ground was stubbornly contested,
when Jacksonâs column to the right and left of the
First Maryland broke, which compelled the whole
to fall back. They were quickly rallied, however,
when a desperate charge was made, and the enemy in
turn compelled to retire. Lomax then withdrew his
division to Gordonsville, where it rested that night,
and at daylight it was again drawn up in line of
battle to meet the enemy, who had made his appearance.
A sharp but brief conflict ensued, in which
the enemy was repulsed, when he withdrew, and
finally retired by the road he came to Winchester.

267

CHAPTER X.

After this affair the brigade of Jackson retired
to within twelve or fifteen miles of Orange
Court House, where it remained until about the first
of March, when Sheridan moved down the Valley in
heavy force, and captured the little that remained
of Earlyâs command near Waynesboroâ. The First
Maryland was ordered to hang upon his flank,
which it did with great tenacity, first striking him
on James river, beyond Charlottesville, and following
him to the White House, on York river. So
small a force could accomplish nothing by a direct
attack, and it therefore confined its operations to
cutting off scouting and marauding parties, which
amounted in the aggregate to more than their own
number three times over.

The battalion rested for some days near Richmond
after it had returned from following Sheridan, when
it was ordered to join Lomax in West Virginia. It
accordingly marched to join that officer, and when
about two days advanced on the journey, was ordered
back with all speed to report to General Fitz.
Lee at Stony creek, twenty miles from Petersburg.

Reaching Richmond on the evening of April 2d,
1865, it went into camp on its suburbs. Early next
morning (Sunday) the battalion moved through the
city, and had the pleasure of greeting many of their
comrades, prisoners on parole, awaiting exchange.

268
The day had nothing of Sabbath quiet, churches
were unattended, and the streets filled with anxious
crowds of soldiers and citizens eagerly seeking and
discussing the army news. Already many painful
rumors were rife betokening disaster, but resolutely
refusing to doubt the success of the cause in which
their very souls were embarked, the little band of
Marylandersânow reduced to less than one hundred
in the saddleâpushed on, followed by the regrets
and blessings of their paroled brothers, whose obligations
forbade them, as yet, to take part in the
stirring events then occurring. As the lines at
Petersburg were approached, it was inexpressibly
cheering to see everything calm, and the army apparently
as confident and defiant as ever.

It was well known that the odds against General
Lee were immense, but all Confederate victories had
been won against such advantages, and an abiding
faith in the justice of their cause, and genius of
their great chief, kept up the spirits of Colonel
Dorseyâs command in spite of all drawbacks.
When, therefore, bodies of troops of greater or less
force were seen in motion, on or near the Petersburg
road, in perfect order, and advancing towards
the sound of the firing, which had all day been
heard in their front, the Maryland soldiers took
these facts as perfect confirmation of their pre-entertained
opinion that all the news which had given
rise to such distressing rumors were, instead of a
retreat of the Army of Northern Virginia, only a

269
strategic device on the part of General Lee to bring
Grant out from behind his breastworks in order to
attack and destroy him. Nor was this idea weakened
at all when, after reaching Petersburg about
dark, they found everything prepared for motion,
and heard that General Leeâs lines had been broken.
The heavy batteries in front were in full action, and
it naturally seemed that so much firing must indicate
stout resistance.

Failing to find any order from General Fitz. Lee
at this point, who had before this left Stony creek
for some point to him unknown, Colonel Dorsey
availed himself of such shelter as the ground
afforded to rest and feed man and horse, and to
await information or orders. Here there was abundance
of food and forage, for which there was not
transportation, and orders had been issued for its
destruction. Colonel Dorsey was therefore permitted
to take as much of both for his command as
could be carried, which was not much, as the horses
were too weak, on account of long marches and insufficient
food, to bear any considerable increase of
burden. Horses and men, however, had one full
meal, and it being the soldierâs philosophy to let
each day take care of itself, all were soon stretched
upon the ground to catch such repose as might be
vouchsafed them.

The enemyâs fire seemed to increase in violence, and
shot and shell soon began to pass over the encampment,
and far in its rear, but did no damage, as the

270
intervening hill gave full protection. In this situation,
heedless of all the noises, exhausted nature
demanded rest, and the First Maryland slept.

A couple of hours passed, when the command was
aroused, saddled up, and prepared to move, Colonel
Dorsey having at last received orders to follow in
the rear of Mahoneâs division, which formed the
rear of the Confederate army. This division had not
yet come up, and while awaiting its appearance, the
command looked on and grieved over the destruction
of ordnance and quartermasterâs stores, which were
now being fired in every direction to prevent their
falling into the hands of the enemy. These fires
had evidently aroused the enemy into increased
action, and his batteries were now in a constant
blaze, while the explosion of his shells and the Confederate
ammunition wagons made the night hideous
with warâs most infernal din. Fortunately the
enemy directed his guns at the fires, and as everybody
kept away from them, no damage was done.

The battalion was drawn up along the roadside
waiting to march, and coaxing their horses to eat
as much oats as possible. Near by was a train of
cars loaded with ammunition, and word was passed
to look out, as it was about to be set on fire. For
a while every man stood to horse, but the explosion
not ensuing as soon as expected, attention was called
off, and the caution forgotten. Bridles were let go,
and some of the men walked towards the quartermasterâs
stores, near the ammunition train, to make

271
further selections. Suddenly a tremendous shock
was felt, which threw many to the ground, whilst
the horses reared and plunged and broke from their
riders, and for a time all was the wildest confusion.
When matters had become a little calm, two men
belonging to the quartermasterâs department were
found dead, and twenty horses of the First Maryland
had run off at full speed towards Richmond,
though fortunately none of the men were hurt beyond
a few bruises. The runaway horses must
have been terribly frightened, for in their poor condition
they ran twenty miles without halting, and
only thirteen of the twenty were recovered; thus
the battalion lost the services of seven men, who
being dismounted, had to remain with the wagons.
The explosion took place two hundred yards distant,
but the force was great enough to knock down
those nearest to it, and greatly shock the others.

Soon after this occurrence, Mahoneâs division came
up at the quickstep, and in fine order and spirits,
which cheered the hearts of the little cavalry
band beyond expression. Day had dawned before
the rear passed, and just at that time, in the grey
light of morning, was seen a brilliant flash, and
for a few moments the earth trembled under foot,
and a tremendous explosion plainly told that the
fortifications at Druryâs Bluff were no more. In ten
minutes another flash, shock and explosion ensued,
and the Confederate gunboats on the James had
shared the fate of the batteries on shore. Other

272
similar explosions followed as smaller magazines
were destroyed, filling the whole atmosphere with
sulphurous smoke, while the flames licked the sky
from many a conflagration, and it was with sad
hearts that the little battalion turned and followed
in the footsteps of the infantry. Thus commenced
the retreat that ended in the surrender of the army
of Northern Virginia.

The roads were muddy and wretchedly cut up by
the passage of the artillery and heavy wagons, and
the army, though in constant motion, made slow
progress. By the next afternoon, Monday 3d of
April, Amelia Court House was reached, where
the enemy made a slight demonstration, but did not
seriously attack. Early on the morning of the 4th
Colonel Dorsey ascertaining the whereabouts of
General Fitz. Lee, joined his division, in pursuance
of his original order, and was assigned to Payneâs
brigade.

Before this the small supply of provisions and
forage which were brought from Petersburg had
been exhausted, and as none had been issued, men
and horses were almost starving.

The enemyâs cavalry now became exceedingly
active, and Payneâs brigade was daily engaged from
daylight to dark, and often the struggle lasted all
night. Grantâs immense cavalry force enabled him
to make simultaneous attacks at several points, and
thus he succeeded in destroying a large portion of
General Leeâs wagon train, as it was impossible for
the small force of Confederate cavalry to guard all

273
points. The only thing to be done was to attack
the enemy wherever he struck the train, and most
vigorously was this plan followed.

In all these affairs, without exception, the Confederate
cavalry was successful; and in one, when
General Robert E. Lee was personally present and
observing, repulsed a sudden and determined charge
of Greggâs division with great loss, and captured
Gregg himself.

Fate seemed to have determined that the Confederate
sun should set in halo worthy of its noonday
splendor, and gave a series of unbroken successes to
the cavalry, and crowned all by the magnificent
charge of Gordonâs corps of infantry on the very
morning of the surrender, when that gallant General
swept away the enemyâs lines and captured his batteries
in a style that showed that nothing of his old
vigor was lost. There was a serious embarrassment,
however, attending the cavalry victories, viz: The
capture of so many prisoners, which towards the
last became nearly as numerous as General Leeâs
whole army, and presented a difficult question both
as to feeding and guarding. No rations having
been issued, men and horses had been subsisting
from the 4th of April on a scanty supply of hard
corn, which the troops had not even time to parch,
and ate raw from the cob as they marched. On one
occasion someone of the battalion got hold of a raw
ham, and generously divided it as far as it would
go. Raw ham, and raw corn from the cob may not

274
be very palatable to one unfasted, but to Colonel
Dorsey and his men it seemed a luxury.

At Amelia Springs there was a severe fight, in
which the enemy was defeated and pursued some
miles. Here a small portion of flour was issued to
each man, but which there was no time to cook, and
the flour was tied up in bags, handkerchiefs, stockings,
or anything else at hand that might serve the
purpose; and so it remained for two days before
opportunity to cook it offered, the battalion being
in the meantime constantly engaged.

At last it was impossible for human nature to hold
out longer, and the second night after the fight at
Amelia Springs, it was determined to cook the
flour. As soon, therefore, as night came onâwhich
rendered the enemyâs fire less accurate, and
induced his cavalry to become less aggressiveâthe
brigade, leaving a strong picket force still actively
skirmishing, withdrew behind a neighboring hill
and prepared to cook. There were no cooking
utensils nor any convenience to make, but soldiers
who had gone through a four yearâs war had many
devices at hand to meet exigencies. A detail with
canteens was sent to the stream near by for water,
and oil cloths were substituted for kneading trays.
In this way the flour was hastily moistened into a
paste, and as hastily parched in the embers of the
very spare fires which proximity to the enemy
reduced to the smallest possible dimension that
could be dignified with the name of fire. The

275
skirmishers were then relieved by some who had
eaten, to make similar provisions for their wants.

From this time until Lynchburg was reached, on
the night of the 9th of April, when General Lee
surrendered at Appomattox Court House, the First
Maryland subsisted on corn and some rations taken
from the captured enemy. It was hard to take food
from prisoners, perhaps, but necessity knows no
law, and between starving men the weakest must
yield.

Every dayâs history was much the same, a constant
night and day struggle with the enemyâs
cavalry, who would scarcely be repulsed at one point
before they had to be met at another, perhaps five
or ten miles distant.

When the army reached the vicinity of High
Bridge it was ascertained that a force of the enemy
was directly in front, having by a forced march,
and being unencumbered, passed around General
Leeâs left and thrown themselves directly in his
path. The brigade (which I have forgotten to state,
was now commanded by Brigadier General Thomas
T. Munford, he having succeeded General Payne
after the fight at Amelia Springs, the latter officer
being disabled by wounds) was at once ordered to
attack them, which it did with much gallantry, all
being dismounted except the First Maryland, which
was sent to the left to cut off the enemyâs retreat.
The enemy, which proved to be a brigade of infantry
and about two hundred cavalry, behaved very gallantly,

276
and at once met General Munford vigorously.
His cavalry charged several times, but were repulsed
with heavy loss, while the enemyâs infantry and
Munfordâs dismounted cavalry kept up a heavy fire,
both sides suffering severely, without material advantage
to either. At length Deeringâs brigade
came up and dismounted, and joining Munford, a
general charge was made by the dismounted men in
front, and the First Maryland mounted in the rear
and right flank of the enemy, which resulted in the
defeat and capture of his entire force.

Nearly all the field officers on both sides were
killed or badly wounded.

It will be remembered, in this connection, that
although the Confederates had two brigades engaged
here against the one of the enemyâs infantry and
the force of two hundred cavalry, yet he had greatly
the advantage in numbers as well as of a deliberately
selected position. Confederate brigades at
this period of the war frequently did not number
five hundred men, and on this occasion General
Munford took into action (including Deeringâs men)
a smaller force, considerably, than was captured.

For a short time Munford rested his command,
when, after turning over his prisoners, he again
sought the enemy towards the rear of General Leeâs
army. He here found Fitz. Lee closely pressed, and
joined his forces to impede as much as possible their
advance. A narrow and deep stream crossed the
road over which the retreat was being conducted,

277
and at the crossing place the mud was much worked
up by the passage of the army. As this stream
was neared the enemy, from the crest of the range
of hills about a mile distant, had a clear view of the
retreating forces. He hurried up his batteries and
opened furiously, while his cavalry pressed hard
upon the rear. Crossing the stream, a portion of the
division, including Munfordâs brigade, was deployed
along its banks to dispute the passage. A slight
and hastily constructed breastwork of fence rails,
thrown up under the fire of the opposing artillery,
was all that Munford had to aid him against the
immense force advancing. The whole face of the
country beyond the stream now seemed a mass of
troops. Artillery crowned every available point,
while cavalry and infantry in column advanced
rapidly upon the handful of men that stood in their
path. It was necessary that a stand should be
made to give time for the wagon and ordnance
trains to pass a small bridge near Farmville. The
enemyâs skirmishers soon lined the banks of the
little stream, and poured in a rapid fire upon
Munford, which was vigorously returned. In a few
minutes a heavy column of cavalry charged at the
ford, when they were received with a murderous
fire at a range of not over forty yards. The ford
was narrow, deep and marshy; the dead and dying
men and horses encumbered their advance, and the
enemy were forced to fall back defeated after many
of them had actually crossed the stream. Several

278
batteries were then opened upon Munford, but the
firing was too wild, and everything having been
accomplished that was desired, and the train safely
over the bridge, the Confederate cavalry retired
rapidly, but in excellent order, towards Farmville,
moving in several different columns in order to
present smaller marks to the artillery, which was
firing with much increased accuracy, owing to the
clear view which the open fields afforded.

The enemy then crossed the stream where he had
been repulsed, and also at several other points lower
down, and followed in rapid pursuit, and were soon
charging Munfordâs rear furiously through Farmville.
One column charged a piece of woods in
which lay a force of infantry in ambuscade, and
was literally cut to pieces.

The streams about Farmville were much swollen,
and in order to save time, General Fitz. Leeâs division,
still in several different columns, crossed at as
many different points, in most cases swimming their
horses. At nightfall the fighting ceased, but was
resumed in the morning with increased fury.

All this time a large force of the enemy, both
infantry and cavalry, had marched rapidly by
parallel roads, and had gotten between General
Lee and Lynchburg, then his only depot of supplies,
had captured all the trains with provisions sent out
from that city to meet his army, then on the verge
of starvation, and on the morning of April 8th,
near Appomattox Court House, suddenly attacked

279
his ordnance train, which in advance of the whole
army was pressing on towards Lynchburg, guarded
only by one small brigade of cavalry. But notwithstanding
the great disparity of forces, a severe fight
was kept up nearly an hour, the artillery particularly
being well and effectually served, and drove
back the enemy in front. The infantry and dismounted
cavalry, however, now completely surrounded
and drove the men from their guns, and
captured all the artillery and wagons, which left
General Lee almost destitute of both. Some few
artillerists escaped on their horses, and fled down
the road towards the infantry, followed by a column
of cavalry. But the infantry was prepared for
their approach, and permitting the flying artillerists
to pass, they poured in a most deadly volley, which
scattered the pursuers in all directions.

For the balance of the night all remained quiet,
and the two armies anxiously awaited the coming of
the morrow, which must decide the fate of the army
of Northern Virginia. Further retreat was impossible
as the enemy held the roads on all sides, and
without rations, cannon or ammunition to supply
even the wants of twelve thousand men now left
General Lee, he, on the morning of the 9th of April,
confronted Grantâs mighty host. All the difficulties
of the position were well known and appreciated by
the Confederate army, but the men who formed that
army then, who had followed their flag through all
the gloom and trials of the retreatâa retreat which

280
needs only the pen of a Xenophon to make as famous
as that of the âTen Thousandââthose men,
though not of numbers, but of country, in the dawn
of that April morning advanced to meet their persistent
foe with all the calm and lofty courage that
would have made Appomattox Court House a
ThermopylÃ¦. Those men, had their leader so
willed it, would have laid down their arms and lives
together. They were men indeed, and worthy to
close the record of the army of Northern Virginia.

As soon as the day gave sufficient light, the battle
opened fiercely, and all thought an engagement had
commenced which was to prove the most desperate
and terrible of the war.

General Fitz. Leeâs division of cavalry, now under
command of Brigadier General Munford, (General
Fitz. Lee being at the headquarters of the army)
moved through Appomattox Court House, and
formed in line of battle on the right of the road
about half a mile beyond that place. The halt was
brief, and it moved in column obliquely to the right
and entered a heavy wood, where it soon came in
contact with the enemy.

Throwing out skirmishers to engage them,
General Munford moved again to the right oblique
until they were again struck, when more skirmishers
were thrown out, the first having fallen in the rear,
and these movements were continued until he found
a weaker place in the enemyâs line, and made good
his passage to the Lynchburg road.

281
Nothing was known positively. The sounds of a
severe fight were plainly heard, and those movements
of the cavalry excited much surprise and
comment among the men and officers composing the
division.

At first it was thought that the intention was to
get in the enemyâs rear and charge him while
engaged in front by the infantry, which opinion
was much strengthened by a near approach to a
battery of the enemyâs in full action against General
Leeâs infantry, but another detour proved its fallacy,
and all were lost in conjecture until the Lynchburg
road was reached, when it became evident that the
immediate object of the movement was to reach that
road, as the division at once halted and formed on
each side. From this point the masses of Grantâs
army were plainly visible, standing as if on dress
parade.

The firing had now ceased, and surprise at what
seemed unaccountable movements gave place to
alarm. Surrender of the army was whispered, but
was heard with indignation by many who would
not acknowledge their own fears to themselves, and
all comment was unheeded, and by general consent
it was determined to await events in silence. We
could see, indeed, on the bronzed countenances of
those veterans an anxiety too deep for words.

The First Maryland happened to be nearest
to the road and to the enemy, the men dismounted,
but standing to horseâthe usual precaution of

282
skirmishers in front having been, of course, observed.

Everything was still. Not a sound betrayed the
presence of the hosts of armed men in the vicinity,
and but for the long lines of blue in sight upon the
hills in front, all might have been taken for a hideous
dream.

Suddenly a heavy column of cavalry, moving
rapidly along Munfordâs front, and parallel to his
line, was seen, about half a mile distant, marching
towards the road, which was presently reached, and
a part of the force, still in column, advanced by the
road, and the remainder in line through the fields
to right of the road, and drove back the skirmishers.

As soon as the design of the enemy was perceived,
Colonel Dorsey mounted his men and moved in
column to the road, which was separated from him
by a fence, in which gaps had been made. Through
one of these gaps the First Maryland was passing
as rapidly as was consistent with good order, but
the first section had hardly cleared the fence when
the enemy, now in full charge, was seen coming at
them not over one hundred yards distant. Captain
Raisin, who rode with Colonel Dorsey at the head,
remarked, âColonel, we must charge them; it is
the only chance;â and scarcely had the words left
his lips when Dorsey, who had already seen the
necessity, gave the command, âDraw sabre, gallop,
charge!â and the little band of Marylanders hurled
themselves against the heavy columns of the enemy,

283
and drove him back. Again he advanced, and
again the First Maryland charged and forced him
back.

In this last chargeâthe last blow struck by the
army of Virginiaâwhile still pushing the enemy
vigorously, the battalion was met by an officer
carrying a flag of truce, who suddenly made his
appearance from the right of the road. The fight
instantly ceased, and the officer was asked his business.
He replied that General Lee was about to
surrender, that articles of capitulation were being
prepared, that hostilities had ceased, and ended by
demanding that the cavalry in his front should come
in and lay down their arms, as being part of
General Leeâs army, and included in the terms.

General Munford called a council of war of all
his officers, and after discussing matters and taking
a vote, it was determined not to surrender, being
clearly not subject to the treaty between Lee and
Grant, as the division had broken through the
enemyâs lines before a surrender had been discussed
by the leaders of the two armies, and more especially
because the enemy had attacked the division
during the truce, and had only spoken of it after
having been thrice repulsed.

In the last charge, immediately before the appearance
of the white flag, young Price, of Company
E, Captain Raisin, was killed, thus yielding his life
in the very last blow struck by the army of Northern
Virginia.

284
In accordance with the unanimous opinion of the
council of war, General Munford threw out a heavy
skirmish line, and retired towards Lynchburg unmolested
by the enemy, who contented himself
with looking on.

Arriving at Lynchburg about night, General
Munfordâs first care was to obtain food and forage
for his command, which was done without much
difficulty, as large supplies had been gathered at
this point with a view of meeting the necessities of
General Leeâs army, a portion of which supplies, as
before said, having been sent out to meet the army,
and captured by the enemy near Appomattox Court
House on the 8th.

After feeding, another council was held, and the
chances and best means of reaching Johnsonâs army
discussed. Without coming to any definite conclusion,
it was determined to move to the north side
of the James river and seek supplies until some
news from Johnson could be obtained.

Colonel Dorsey marched to the neighborhood of
Waynesboroâ, where the kindness of the people to
the soldiers had been before experienced, and there
awaited orders. In about ten days he received a dispatch
from General Munford to move up the Valley,
by way of Lexington, towards Salem, on which route
all the cavalry were to march, and to make their
way to Johnsonâs army.

The First Maryland was immediately on the
march, and arrived at Cloverdale, in Botetourt

285
county, on the 28th day of April, where Colonel
Dorsey, learning that General Munford was confined
to his bed by sickness, rode to the house at
which the General was lying, and received from
him the following letter, which he had prepared to
be read to the First Maryland, and which speaks
for itself, the General expressing his regret that his
sickness prevented him from saying farewell to the
battalion in person:

Cloverdale, Botetourt County, Va.
, }

April 28th, 1865.   }

Lieutenant Colonel Dorsey
,

Commanding First Maryland Cavalry
.

I have just learned from Captain Emack that your gallant band
was moving up the Valley in response to my call. I am deeply
pained to say that our army cannot be reached, as I have learned
that it has capitulated. It is sad, indeed, to think that our
countryâs future is all shrouded in gloom. But for you and your
command there is the consolation of having faithfully done your
duty.

Three years ago the chivalric Brown joined my old regiment
with twenty-three Maryland volunteers with light hearts and full
of fight. I soon learned to admire, respect and love them for all
those qualities which endear soldiers to their officers. They
recruited rapidly, and as they increased in numbers, so did their
reputation and friends increase, and they were soon able to form
a command and take a position of their own. Need I say when
I see that position so high and almost alone among soldiers, that
my heart swells with pride to think that a record so bright and
glorious is in some part linked with mine? Would that I could
see the mothers and sisters of every member of your battalion
that I might tell them how nobly you have represented your
State and maintained our cause. But you will not be forgotten.

286
The fame you have won will be guarded by Virginia with all the
pride she feels in her own true sons, and the ties which have
linked us together memory will preserve. You who struck the
first blow in Baltimore, and
the last in Virginia
, have done all
that could be asked of you, and had the rest of our officers and
men adhered to our cause with the same devotion, to-day we
would have been free from Yankee thraldom. I have ordered the
brigade to return to their homes, and it behooves us now to
separate. With my warmest wishes for your welfare, and a
hearty God bless you, I bid you farewell.

THOMAS T. MUNFORD,

Brigadier General Commanding Division
.

The scene which followed this announcement and
letter can only be conceived by those who have had
every energy and sentiment of soul and heart
wrapped up in the attainment of some end a thousand
fold dearer than life, only to find after years of
the bitterest struggles and dearest sacrifices, that all
vain, and themselves bankrupt of all that would
make life supportable. This little band of Maryland
soldiers, despairing and broken hearted, were
hundreds of miles from home, but separated still
farther by a wanton exercise of power forbidding
them to return to Maryland, which exercise of
power was due to the petty malice of some of the
civil authorities of Marylandâs cowardly jackals,
tearing at the dead body of the lion, which living,
they dared not face.

With this letter of General Munford, announcing
the surrender of General Joseph E. Johnstonâs
army, perished the last hope of the Southern Confederacy,

287
and the few surviving members of the
First Maryland cavalry prepared to bid each other
adieu. That was a sad and solemn parting indeed,
and stout hearts melted, and tears from eyes unused
to weeping were profusely shed, when hand clasping
hand, farewell was spoken.

The old flag which had so often moved in victory
was saluted for the last time, and reverently taken
from its staff and folded away. The last weeping
word was spoken, and with breaking hearts the old
battalion disbanded forever, some riding slowly
away, others at full speed as if to fly from grief.

In their wanderings the exiled soldiers depended
entirely upon the kindness and hospitality of the
Virginia people. They had no money or means to
supply their wantsânothing but their destitution
and soldiers life to plead. But Virginia people did
not forget their services, and hastened eagerly to
relieve their necessities. At the end, as in the
beginning, and through the progress of the war, the
warm-hearted kindness and genuine hospitality of
the Virginians adorned them with a lustre equal to
their valor in battle. The soldiers of the First
Maryland cavalry must cease to have hearts or
memories when they forget the Virginia people and
their devoted attentions.

THE
BALTIMORE LIGHT ARTILLERY.

CHAPTER I.

It was towards the close of a pleasant day in
October, 1861, that the First Maryland Infantry
dragged its weary length into camp near Centreville,
after a long and fruitless expedition to Pohick
Church in search of the enemy. Things seemed
much changed, indeed, since their departure, for in
their absence a battery of artillery had invaded the
sacred confines of their camp, and a scowl was
observed upon more than one face, for we were
jealous of our rights and dared maintain them.
Judge then our surprise when informed it was a
battery manned by brother Marylanders, and called
the âBaltimore Light Artillery.â They had just
been organized at Richmond, and forwarded to the
army at Centreville during our absence. They were
welcomed, most heartily welcomed, and it was not
long ere we discovered old friends and acquaintances
among them.

Before many hours had elapsed we paid our
respects to the officers of the battery, and found
them to be the true type of the Maryland and Virginia
gentlemen. But here they are:

Capt. W. HUNTER GRIFFIN.

293
Captain J. B. Brockenborough was a Virginian,
a graduate of the Military Institute at Lexington,
and a son of Judge Brockenborough, whose name
is so well known to the people of the South. He
was a young man, not long from college, but in
that intellectual face you read more than the ordinary
man, and the honor and glory with which he
subsequently enveloped his fine command is a
matter of history.

His First Lieutenant, W. Hunter Griffin, was
also a Virginian, but had been engaged in business
in Baltimore for many years. Brave, noble-hearted
Griffin; how little I thought, as for the first time I
took his hand, we should pass together through so
many stirring scenes in the field and prison, for
with the mention of his name appears before me all
the horrors of the retaliatory dens and dungeons of
Morris Island and Fort Pulaski. There we shared
between us the wretched pittance given to sustain a
bare existence, and there we more than once divided
our last dollar.

Second Lieutenant, W. B. Bean, was a Marylander,
and a fine officer and brave soldier.

Third Lieutenant, George Wilhelm, was also a
Marylander, and during the little while he was
with the battery proved himself an efficient officer.
On his resigning the dashing McNulty was
appointed to fill the vacancy.

The
personnel
of the men was unsurpassed in the
army, and was it a wonder, then, that with such

294
officers, and such men, the Baltimore Light Artillery
should soon become a household-word in the
army of Northern Virginia.

During the winter of 1861 and 1862 the battery
remained quietly in camp at Manassas, and when
the army of General Joseph E. Johnston fell back
from that place in March, they were ordered to
remain with General Ewell upon the banks of the
Rappahannock.

Here about the 1st of April the enemy for the
first time heard the bellowing of their loud-mouthed
Blakeleys, which were destined to carry death and
destruction into their ranks upon more than one
bloody field.

It was a lovely afternoon, and fresh in my
memory, that the enemy were observed advancing
in force towards the river. Their approach had
been long expected, and preparations made to
receive them. The Baltimore Light Artillery was
posted on the extreme right of General Elzeyâs
brigade, and supported by the First Maryland
Infantry. As the dense masses of the enemy came
within range, Brockenborough opened with such
accuracy of aim as to attract the attention of Elzey,
who upon the spot predicted for them a glorious
future. For an hour or two the fight was sharp and
severe, and most of the enemyâs artillery fire concentrated
upon the Maryland battery; but they
stood their ground and fought their pieces like
veterans of an hundred battles. Late in the evening
the enemy retired, and left us masters of the field.

295
Once or twice after, they advanced in small force
towards the river, but Brockenborough was ever
ready to receive them, and a shell or two sufficed to
drive them back.

On the 19th of April, 1862, the division of
General Ewell broke camp, and began the wretched
march to Gordonsville, and of which I have spoken
in the First Maryland. For three days the rain
poured in torrents, making the roads almost impassable,
and for three days the officers and men of
the Baltimore battery toiled through the mud, into
which the wheels sank to the hubs, and at length
reached Gordonsville.

After a halt here of three or four days, the division
of General Ewell marched to join Jackson at
Swift Run Gap.

After the return of that General from McDowell,
the whole array advanced upon Kenlyâs forces at
Front Royal, and in the sharp fight which ensued
the battery took a prominent part.

Early on the 25th of May, Jacksonâs army stood
in battle array before Winchester, and the engagement
soon began. The Baltimore Light Artillery
was stationed on the right, and throughout the fight
played with much effect upon the enemyâs columns.

A few days after, at Bolivar Heights, they were
engaged for some hours, and finally drove the
Federal infantry and artillery from their strong
position.

In Jacksonâs memorable retreat down the Valley

296
from the overwhelming forces of Fremont and
Shields, the battery was detailed to support the
cavalry under Ashby and Steuart, which was bringing
up the rear of the army. Here it was daily
engaged with the enemy. At Fisherâs Hill a section
under Griffin was entirely surrounded and cut
off owing to the bad behavior of Steuartâs cavalry,
which was supporting it, but the gallant fellow
drove his pieces through the ranks of the enemy,
and reached the main body in safety.

At the battle of Harrisonburg it supported Ashby
in his fight with the Pennsylvania Bucktails, and
did good service.

On the 8th of June the division of Ewell was
drawn up in line of battle at Cross Keys to dispute
the enemyâs advance, whilst Jackson crossed his
prisoners and wagon trains over the Shenandoah at
Port Republic. The ground for the battle had been
selected by General Elzey, by order of General
Ewell, and a most judicious selection it was, as the
result of the fight proved, and for which General
Elzey received the thanks of Ewell in an official
order, which the author regrets he is unable to give
the reader.

The Baltimore Light Artillery held the extreme
left supported by the First Maryland Infantry.
Theirs was a most exposed position, and upon which
was concentrated the fire of several of the enemyâs
batteries. All day long the battle lasted, and all
day long the little battery continued to hurl its shot

297
and shell into the ranks of the enemy. It was a
most unequal contest, but stubbornly they held
their ground. Generals Elzey and Steuart, who
had remained by and watched the battery with
painful interest, were both borne wounded from the
field. Upon the behavior of that battery perhaps
hung the fate of the day, for we were but a handful
holding at bay a mighty army. But calmly the
officers and men stood to their guns, and although
the enemy essayed more than once to drive them
from the position, there they remained until night
closed upon the combatants, and Jacksonâs army
was saved from the destruction that seemed so imminent.

As a reward for the gallantry displayed in this
fight, General Dick Taylor presented the battery
with two of the splendid brass Napoleons, which
his brigade captured next day at Port Republic.
âI want you to have them,â he said, âfor from
what I saw of you yesterday, I know they will be in
good hands.â

After the battle of Port Republic, which closed
Jacksonâs great Valley campaign, the army moved
up the mountain, where, upon its summit, it
remained two or three days, when it returned and
went into camp near Weirâs Cave, about five miles
from Port Republic. Here the Baltimore Light
Artillery was supplied with new harness and fresh
horses, and was in a splendid condition for the
dreadful fighting about to commence around Richmond,

298
but of which we had not then the slightest
conception.

On the 19th of June, 1862, Jackson put his
troops in motion for Richmond, and on the afternoon
of the 26th the First Maryland Infantry,
which had the advance, encountered the enemy in
force about ten miles from Gainesâ Mills, and a
sharp fight ensued, which lasted some time, when
Brockenborough was ordered to open fire, which he
did with effect, and the enemy retired.

At daylight on the morning of the 28th, Jackson
resumed his march, but owing to the incompetency
of his guides it was late in the afternoon before he
neared the point of attack assigned him. But at
length everything indicated a rise of the curtain in
the fearful drama about to commence. Columns
were marching and countermarching, staff officers
dashed hither and thither, while the crash of small
arms, and the sullen boom of artillery on the right
told full well that the work of death had begun.

About 4 oâclock Jackson threw out his skirmishers
and moved forward in line of battle, and in a few
minutes the enemy were developed in heavy force,
and strongly posted, when the fighting became terrific.
The artillery was directed to take position in
an open field on the left, and were soon heavily
engaged. The battle here was very unequal, for
the enemy had greatly the advantage in artillery
and position, and soon succeeded in disabling a
number of Jacksonâs pieces. In a short time the

299
Jeff Davis Mississippi battery was torn to pieces
and the Baltimore Light Artillery ordered to take
its place, immediately under the eye of Jackson
himself. Gallantly the Marylanders responded to
the order, and dashing at a full run across the field,
unlimbered and opened fire.

The author was standing close beside General
Jackson when the battery went forward, and he
shall long remember the look of anxiety with which
he watched it, and well he might, for upon the success
of that battery much depended. For a while
the air was filled with exploding, crashing shells,
and the horses and men fell rapidly before that
withering fire, which was directed with almost the
precision of a rifle shot. Away went a limber chest
high in the air, scattering death and destruction
around. âWe are not close enough,â said the
brave Brockenborough. âLimber to the front, forward,
gallop!â rung out his sharp command, and
in an instant the battery was in position at point
blank range. Fiercely those guns were then worked
despite the iron hail that ploughed up the ground
around them, and in a few minutes Brockenborough
had the satisfaction of seeing the enemy retire precipitately,
leaving the ground covered with dead and
dying men and horses, and shattered carriages and
dismounted guns. It was Frenchâs famous battery
they had encountered, but Frenchâs no longer, save
in name.

On the morning of the 29th, the battery accompanied

300
Ewellâs division to Dispatch Station, on the
York River railroad, where a few shots were exchanged
with the enemy, when Ewell retraced his
steps, and moved towards Malvern Hill.

In the afternoon of the 1st of July the battle of
Malvern Hill began, and soon raged fiercely.
Through the tardiness of General Huger the enemy
had been enabled to reach the heights of Malvern,
where he posted sixty guns, which swept every foot
of ground around. In vain did the heavy masses
of infantry rush with desperate valor upon these
guns, but it was only to be driven back, leaving the
ground covered with heaps of dead and mangled
men. In this unequal contest artillery was not
available, for not a position was to be had. Two or
three times the Baltimore Light Artillery tried it,
but was as often compelled to hastily withdraw, and
when night ended the conflict, Malvern Hill was not
yet won.

Before morning McClellan withdrew to Harrisonâs
landing on the James, where he was safe, and
General Lee had the mortification of knowing that
the foe so completely within his toils had escaped
him through the incapacity of a General of division.

301

CHAPTER II.

The long spring campaign in the Valley and the
operations around Richmond had made sad
havoc in the ranks of the Maryland Line, and it
became necessary for them to recruit and reorganize
before again ready for the field. For this purpose
the First Maryland Infantry and Baltimore Light
Artillery were ordered to Charlottesville, where they
remained a month, when they were once more
ordered to join Jackson, who was about to make his
great movement to the rear of Popeâs army at
Manassas. Alas, the two commands did not journey
together far, for at Gordonsville an order overtook
Colonel Johnson requiring him to at once disband
the First Maryland, and the order was reluctantly
obeyed.

The separation was affecting to the greatest
degree, and the little battery pursued its way with
sad and lonely hearts. It was like severing the ties
that bind brother to brother, for in the series of
battles in which they had participated side by side,
the conduct of each had inspired the other with
confidence and respect. âWith the First Maryland
in support,â I heard Captain Brockenborough say,
âI know I am always safe.â And so it was, for
one would never desert the other while life lasted.

On the morning of the 19th of August the battery
reached Orange Court House, where, much to
the joy of all, it was attached to Starkeâs Louisiana

302
brigade. An affinity had long existed between the
Maryland and Louisiana troops, and they commanded
each othersâ fullest confidence. In fact
they seemed nearer akin, for in both there was that
sprightliness, dash and vim not so noticeable in
troops from other States.

With three daysâ rations in haversacks, Brockenborough,
on the 21st, moved towards the Rappahannock,
where he found the enemy occupying the
north bank in force. A severe artillery fight immediately
began, and was maintained for some
hours. The battery pitted against Brockenborough
was Company M, United States regulars, which,
towards nightfall, he succeeded in silencing and
driving back with the loss of many men and an
exploded caisson.

On the morning of the 22d, the artillery was
thrown across the river, but soon after encountered
the enemy in heavy force, and were compelled to
recross after a desperate struggle. In this affair the
Baltimore Light Artillery suffered a loss of four
men killedâIrvin, Cox, Bradley and Reynoldsâand
several severely wounded.

Brockenborough finding it impossible to cross at
that point, moved up to Hansonâs Ford, where a
crossing was effected, and he then pursued his way
through Orleans, Salem and Thoroughfare Gap,
and reached Manassas on the 26th, having marched
fifty miles in two days, with nothing for his men or
horses to eat save the green corn gathered along the

303
road. Here at Manassas, though, was found in the
captured trains and sutlersâ stores all they could
have desired, and for hours they revelled in the
good things their new commissary had so bountifully
supplied, and over Rhine wine and lobsters
forgot for the time the privations of the past few
days.

From Manassas, Jackson moved on Centreville,
but finding the enemy there in force, he retraced
his steps to Manassas, closely pursued, and formed
his line of battle, about sunset on the 28th, upon the
ground occupied by the enemy in the battle of July,
1861.

The engagement immediately commenced, and
raged with great fury for some time, but the enemy
was repulsed in every assault, and driven back with
heavy loss. General Stephen D. Lee, who commanded
the whole of Jacksonâs artillery, then put
the several batteries in position along the crest of
a commanding hill, and there awaited the attack
sure to be renewed next day.

About two oâclock on the 29th heavy columns
emerged from the woods in Jacksonâs front, and
advanced boldly to the attack, but the storm of grape
and canister which tore through their ranks was
more than flesh and blood could withstand, and
they were driven back with dreadful slaughter.
But again and again did those devoted columns
reform and return to the attack with undiminished
ardor, but the same terrible fire greeted them, and
strewed the ground with dead and dying.

304
But nevertheless Jacksonâs situation was a most
critical one. With but a handful of worn and
wearied troops he was battling with ten times his
numbers, which must necessarily soon wear him out
and exhaust his ammunition; but as the hearts of his
men were sinking within them, they were cheered
by the clouds of dust that arose in the distance and
heralded the approach of their great chieftain, Lee,
with the veterans of Longstreetâs corps. At night
the battle ceased, and the wearied troops threw
themselves upon the ground to seek a little repose
before the work of death and destruction should
be resumed on the morrow.

At the break of day on the morning of the 30th
of August, the troops were aroused from their slumbers
and ordered to prepare for the great and
decisive battle at hand. But hour after hour passed
by, and except an occasional picket shot, all else
was still. It was, though, but the calm which precedes
the storm, for suddenly dense masses of the
enemy emerged from the woods, and moved at the
double-quick upon Jacksonâs lines. It was a grand
sight to see those three lines rush forward in the
most beautiful order. For a minute a deathlike
silence prevailed, when the very earth was made
to tremble by the roar of Stephen D. Leeâs thirty-six
pieces of artillery, fired at point blank range.
The slaughter was appalling, and whole ranks
melted away in an instant, but the brave survivors
closed up their decimated columns, and despite that

305
awful fire pressed on until they encountered the
infantry posted in the railroad cut in front, where
for a time the fight was waged hand to hand. At
length they began to break and to retreat, and the
batteries, which had been silent for some time
owing to the proximity of the struggling columns
of infantry, again belched forth into the fleeing
mass their deadly discharges of grape, which was
continued until the fugitives reached the shelter of
the woods from which they had emerged.

Of the several batteries under General Lee that
day, not one was worked more fiercely than the
Baltimore Light Artillery, and none contributed
more to the defeat and destruction of the enemy.

Long before nightfall the victory was won, and the
braggart Pope, with the remnant of his army, was
seeking safety in the defences around Washington.

In the invasion of Maryland, which followed this
signal victory, the battery was placed in the advance,
and crossed the river at Whiteâs Ford.

On the 6th of September the battery passed
through Frederick city, and encamped on the
suburbs. Many were the congratulations the brave
fellows received from the citizens, and during the
three days they remained, their wants were abundantly
supplied.

Leaving Frederick city, the battery passed through
Boonsboro, Middletown, and Williamsport, where
they recrossed the Potomac, and on the 12th entered
Martinsburg.  From thence it moved towards

306
Harperâs Ferry, when upon arriving at Loudoun
Heights Brockenborough was assigned a position
from which, at early dawn of the 15th, he opened,
along with other batteries, a terrific fire upon the
enemyâs entrenched position on Bolivar Heights.
The batteries were worked furiously for an hour,
when just as the Confederate infantry were put in
motion to storm the works, a white flag fluttered in
the breeze, and Harperâs Ferry surrendered with its
twelve thousand troops, and artillery and supplies
in abundance.

But there was heavy work yet to be done, for
General Lee with a portion of his army was confronting
the overwhelming masses of McClellan at
Sharpsburg, and no time was to be lost in reaching
him. The surrender had therefore scarcely been
effected when the troops were dispatched to his aid.
By a forced night march Jacksonâs artillery reached
Sharpsburg on the 16th, and was immediately
assigned a position on a range of hills rather northwest
of the town.

The morning of the 17th of September found the
two armies in position, and ready to begin the work
of destruction. For the Confederates the prospects
of success seemed gloomy enough, for General Lee
had barely forty thousand men with which to meet
the mighty army of McClellan, numbering over
one hundred and twenty thousand troops. But the
vast odds were made almost proportionate by the
superior genius of the Confederate Generals. With
Lee, Jackson and Longstreet in command nothing

307
seemed impossible to their troops, and therefore it
was with no feelings of fear for the result that
they surveyed the long and glittering lines before
them.

Soon after sunrise slight artillery skirmishing
commenced along the lines, which increased in
volume until the air seemed filled with exploding
shells. Upon the position held by the batteries of
Brockenborough, Carpenter, Poague, Moody, Rain
and Caskie, was opened a terrific fire, which was
promptly returned, and the enemyâs batteries
several times compelled to change position. This
continued for two hours, when it became evident
that the infantry was massing for a charge. The
position was of the most vital importance, for should
the enemy succeed in gaining possession of this
point, and turning Leeâs left flank, he would be
irretrievably lost. His orders to General Jackson
were therefore to âhold the range of hills to the
last.â

McClellanâs advance upon this point was gallantly
met by Jacksonâs veteran infantry, and for some
time the fighting was of the most determined character;
but at length the immense superiority of
numbers prevailed, and Jacksonâs troops gradually
fell back across the turnpike, past the Dunkard
Church and through the woods, and appeared upon
the plain beyond. Most beautifully did the heavy
columns emerge from the woods and move forward
upon the batteries quietly awaiting their nearer

308
approach. âDo not pull a lanyard,â said Brockenborough,
who was temporarily in command of the
whole, âuntil you get the command.â Nearer and
nearer those solid columns approached, and amid
loud huzzas rushed forward at the double-quick.
It was a moment of dreadful suspense. On, on,
they came. âWill Brockenborough never give the
command?â Yes; he now has them at the muzzles
of his guns, and the next instant the command
âFire!â was heard above the exultant cheers of the
advancing columns, and twenty-four pieces of artillery,
double shotted with canister, belched forth
their deadly contents into the very faces of the
assailants.

The scene that was presented as the smoke lifted
beggars description. The ground was literally
covered, nay piled, with the slain and maimed of
the enemy, and the survivors were in full retreat.
They were soon reformed, however, and again moved
boldly to the attack, but only to be again mercilessly
slaughtered and driven back. A third time
they essayed, but with the same result, when, a
disordered mass of fugitives, the survivors sought
the shelter of the woods from which they had but a
few minutes before emerged, confident of success.

How anxiously the great chieftain, Leeâwho was
close byâmust have watched the dreadful struggle
which was to decide the fate of his army, and perhaps
of the cause for which he was battling; and how
great must have been the relief as he saw the enemy

309
in retreat and Jacksonâs shattered columns once
more reformed.

Night put an end to the dreadful conflict, and
Lee still held his ground, despite the herculean
efforts of his adversary to drive him from it, but the
dayâs struggle had cost him thousands of his
bravest and best.

The brave Brockenborough that day won his
Majorâs star, and, with his battery, received special
mention in General Leeâs official report.

The morning of the 18th broke clear and beautiful,
and General Lee was in readiness to renew the
fight, which it was not doubted would begin at an
early hour. But McClellanâs beaten and shattered
army required time and rest and reinforcements
before again prepared for aggressive operations;
and finding this to be the case, Lee proceeded to
bury his dead, and that night, unmolested, recrossed
the river at a point near Shepherdstown.

CHAPTER III.

Soon after the battle of Sharpsburg, the Baltimore
Light Artillery, now under command of Captain
W. H. Griffin, was ordered to join the cavalry and
infantry of the Maryland Line, then encamped near
New Market, in the Valley of Virginia. Here they
passed the fall and winter months quietly in camp,

310
and in early spring were again prepared, with
recruited ranks and renewed equipments, to enter
the field.

On the 13th of June the infantry and artillery of
the Maryland Line, with one company of its cavalry,
all under command of Lieutenant-Colonel James
R. Herbert, moved towards Winchester, near which
place they were to unite with the division of General
Early, which was moving across from Front Royal.
Near Kearnstown a body of Milroyâs cavalry was
encountered, but a shot from the battery scattered
them in all directions. A short time after, Early
came up and proceeded to form line of battle. The
enemy soon made his appearance in force, and
opened a severe fire upon Griffin from his batteries,
which was vigorously responded to, and in a little
while the enemy were driven beyond Kearnstown.
Early, as soon as he had formed his line of
battle, moved forward, and by a spirited charge of
Gordonâs brigade, drove him into his strong works
to the left of Winchester.

The next afternoon Haysâ Louisiana brigade was
moved around to the enemyâs right with orders to
charge a strong line of works whilst the artillery
opened upon him in front. Griffin was posted
on a commanding hill a little to the left of the pike,
and threw his first shell into the very centre of the
Star fort. Finding he had the exact range, he commenced
a furious fire, which threw the enemy for a
moment into the greatest confusion, and greatly

311
assisted Hays in his movement upon their right.
The fire was soon spiritedly returned by a Federal
Maryland battery, and continued until night, when
Milroy evacuated his fortifications and attempted
to escape with his army, but in this he was unsuccessful,
although he himself succeeded in reaching
Harperâs Ferry with a few of his troops.

The precision and effect with which the guns of
the Baltimore Light Artillery were served upon this
occasion elicited the highest praise from General
Gordon, to whose brigade it was temporarily attached,
and as a mark of the high esteem in which he held
the battery, he procured them permission from General
Ewell next morning to select from among the
captured guns the best pieces, to take the place of
their own, which were greatly inferior.

The day after the battle of Winchester, the corps
of General Ewell took up its line of march towards
the Potomac. The Baltimore Light Artillery was
directed by some subordinate officers to report to
General Nelson of the
reserve
artillery. The order
occasioned the greatest surprise and indignation
throughout the command, for always before they
had led the advance and covered the retreat. Such
an indignity, as they considered it, could not be
tamely submitted to, and a protest was immediately
drawn up and forwarded to General Ewell, who at
once ordered the battery to join Albert G. Jenkinsâ
brigade of cavalry, which was the van of the army
in the invasion of Pennsylvania.

The battery crossed the Potomac on the 18th of

312
June, and that day joined Jenkins, when the whole
command moved rapidly forward in the greatest
good humor. Many were the jokes they practiced,
and many the quaint sayings, peculiar only to the
soldier. âTake them mice out of your mouth,â
one would bawl out as an officer with well waxed
moustache rode by; âtake âem out, no use to say
they ainât thar, for I see their tails stickin out.â
And as another came along, but a short time in the
service, and wearing a âboiled shirt,â and white
collar, his ears were sure to be assailed with âsay
mister how long did you have to soldier âafore one
of them things growdâ round your neck?â And
the staff officer, with handsome cavalry boots, would
be requested by a dozen voices to âcome out of them
thar boots, for itâs too soon to go into winter
quarters.â

En parenthÃ¨se
, soldiers are queer beings, and will
have their joke, even in the face of almost certain
death. At the battle of Malvern Hill, whilst the
First Maryland regiment was awaiting its turn to
âgo in,â and the men were closely hugging the
earth to avoid the terrible fire of grape and canister
which swept over and around them, I heard an
officer of the regiment remark to another at his side,
whose face was pressed close to the ground, âsay,
Captain, youâll get a scrape down your
back
directly,
and you know itâs something we donât allow here,â
and the officer addressed coolly turned over on his
back, remarking, âwell, if it will please you better,
Iâll take it in front.â

313
The command of Jenkins pursued its march
rapidly through Maryland, and struck the Pennsylvania
line near Greencastle. Thence their way lay
up the Cumberland Valley to Shippensburg, where
a halt was made for a short time to allow the tired
troops to partake of the delicious apple-butter, ham,
bread, &c., furnished them in abundance by the
startled inhabitants. Whilst thus enjoying themselves
to their heartsâ content, the cry of âYanksâ
was raised, and in an instant the scene changed.
Cavalrymen sprang to their horses, and artillerymen
to their guns, but the wary enemy could not be
induced to come within range of Griffinâs Parrottâs,
but retired towards Carlisle, followed leisurely by
Jenkins.

Upon arriving within sight of that town, the
Yankee flag was found defiantly flying from the
public buildings, when Jenkins, supposing the
enemy to be there in force, prepared to attack.
Placing two pieces of artillery in a position to rake
the main street, and disposing of his other troops
in the most available manner, he demanded the
surrender of the town. It was not long before a
deputation of the âsolidâ citizens made their
appearance, and surrendered the place, which
General Jenkins at once took possession of.

After remaining at Carlisle one day, during which
time they were bountifully supplied with provisions
and forage by the citizens, the command moved in
the direction of Harrisburg. At Mechanicstown a

314
small body of cavalry were encountered, but a
shot from Griffin caused them to heat a hasty retreat.
Upon reaching the Susquehanna, the Confederate
commander found the opposite side of the river
strongly fortified, but he at once opened fire from
his batteries, which was promptly responded to.
This continued until late in the afternoon, when
the enemyâs infantry advanced in force, and a severe
skirmish ensued, which lasted until after night.
General Rhodes (I have forgotten to mention the
fact that Jenkins and Rhodes united their forces at
Carlisle) having accomplished his purpose, that
night withdrew in the direction of Gettysburg.

Upon arriving at Gettysburg the battery was
ordered to report to Major Latimer, who assigned
it a position a short distance to the left of the Cashtown
pike. In the terrible battle that ensued, the
Baltimore Light Artillery played its part, and when
the retreat commenced it was kept in the rear to
assist in covering the passage of the army and
wagon trains through the mountain passes.

At a point near Mount Zion the enemy had so
stationed his guns as to completely command the
road through the gap over which a column of
infantry must pass. There was but little time to
spare, for the enemy were pressing them hard.
Captain Griffin was ordered to place his guns in
position, and if possible silence the battery. It
seemed a desperate undertaking, but there was no
alternative. Quickly the brave fellows ran their guns

315
to within point blank range, and opened a deadly
fire. It was promptly returned, and a heavy artillery
duel continued for some time, when the enemyâs
battery was driven from its position, and the infantry
and wagon train passed in safety. I have heard it
asserted by old soldiers that this was one of the
most desperate artillery fights they ever witnessed.
And the Marylanders had every reason to be proud
of their victory, for it was their old antagonist, battery
M, of the regular artillery, that they had again
measured strength with.

At Hagerstown the battery participated in a
severe cavalry fight, in which the Confederates were
entirely successful.

After the army of General Lee recrossed the Potomac,
the battery was ordered to Fredericksburg,
where it remained for a few days, and then rejoined
the main army at Culpepper Court House, and was
assigned to the battalion commanded by Major
Beckham.

For two weeks everything remained quiet, and
well it was, for human endurance had been taxed to
the utmost limit in the severe campaign of the summer,
and required rest and repose.

On the 10th of September Meade became restive,
and General Lee moved forward to give him battle
if he desired it. Beckham was ordered to advance
and take position with his artillery near Muddy
Creek. In a short time the enemy appeared in
force, and a sharp artillery fight ensued. The

316
enemy then threw forward his infantry, and compelled
Beckham and his supports to fall back to the
vicinity of Culpepper Court House. The artillery
was here ordered to take a position and âhold it.â
The fighting soon became fierce, and the Baltimore
Light Artillery was exposed to the severest part of
it, but they gallantly held their ground for some
time, despite the fire of six pieces that were playing
upon their three. But this could not last long, for
all support had been withdrawn, and the enemyâs
dismounted men were advancing in heavy force. It
seemed scarcely possible to save the battery, but the
brave fellows had been in such scrapes before, and
they determined to hold on to their pieces as long as
there was a hope. Retiring through the town, they
had nearly accomplished their purpose of escaping,
when a body of the enemy charged up a cross street
and captured the rear gun, with Lieutenant John
McNulty and nine men attached to it. The remaining
guns were safely taken off the field.

The next morning the enemy made their appearance
in considerable force, and the battery was
enabled to repay them for the rough treatment
received the day preceding, for as a body of cavalry
were engaged in drill, entirely ignorant of the close
proximity of the Baltimore battery, it opened upon
them with deadly effect at very close range.

After the affair at Mine Run, which soon followed
that at Culpepper Court House, the battery was
detached from the main army, and temporarily

317
assigned to duty with General Youngâs brigade of
cavalry. On the 9th of October that General crossed
the Rapidan, and advanced by way of Madison
Court House. His progress was slow, as the march
was by circuitous and concealed side roads in order
to avoid the observations of the enemy. On the 10th
Young met the advance of the enemy at James City,
without an intimation of his approach, and their
bands were regaling the citizens with patriotic airs,
when a shot from Sergeant Harry Marstonâs gun,
of the Baltimore Light Artillery, plunged into their
midst, and abruptly terminated the musical entertainment
for that evening at least. In a short time
a battery was brought up, and a severe artillery
fight ensued. Soon another made its appearance
and opened an enfilading fire upon Griffin, but notwithstanding,
he stubbornly held his position.
Whilst this was going on a large force of the
enemyâs skirmishers attacked the Confederate flank,
and threw the cavalry into some confusion by their
unexpected onset from this quarter. Griffin at the
instant wheeled his pieces, and opened with grape
and canister upon this new enemy. This checked
them until the supports came up, when the enemy
were compelled to retreat precipitately.

On the 12th a sharp engagement took place near
Brandy Station, where the enemy were driven across
the Rappahannock, and pursued to the vicinity of
Cub Run.

After this affair the army retraced its steps to

318
Culpepper Court House, when the Baltimore Light
Artillery was ordered to proceed to Hanover Junction,
and report to Colonel Bradley T. Johnson,
who had been directed to assemble the Maryland
Line at that point, and keep open General Leeâs
communication with Richmond.

The battery spent the winter and part of the
spring here most delightfully, and by the 1st of
May was ready for the field with recruited ranks,
for Lieutenant John McNulty and many of the men
captured in the battles of the preceding year had
returned from Yankee prisons, and were once more
ready for the fray.

CHAPTER IV.

On the 10th of May, 1864, whilst encamped at
Wickhamâs Park, the battery was ordered by
General J. E. B. Stuart, to move up along the
Rivanna, and join the forces there awaiting to intercept
Sheridan, who was advancing towards Richmond.
Reluctantly Colonel Johnson suffered it to
go, for during the winter and spring he had reorganized
and equipped it with much care; but the
exigency of the occasion compelled him to acquiesce,
General Stuart assuring him he would âborrowâ
it for but a few days, and âreturn it in good condition.â

On the 11th the battery took position at Yellow
Tavern, and noon after the enemy made his appearance

319
in force. A heavy encounter ensued, when the
battery was retired about half a mile. For a time
there was a lull in the fighting; but upon the
arrival of General Stuart it was again ordered forward
supported by the cavalry, and took position to
the left of the Brook turnpike, directly in Sheridanâs
front.  The battle was then renewed with great
fury. Sheridan brought three batteries to bear on
Griffin at a range of not over eight hundred yards,
and the rain of shot and shrapnel became terrific,
but the brave fellows never flinched, and served
their guns with great effect.  Hour after hour
this savage fight was waged, but no man faltered
at his post, though the groans of the wounded
and dying, and the shrieks of maimed and
disemboweled horses, were enough to appall the
stoutest heart.  But General Stuart was there,
watching with an anxious eye that little command,
upon which so much depended, and they
fought on, undismayed, despite the frightful scenes
around them. At length the enemy massed a heavy
body of cavalry, determined, at any sacrifice, to
capture the guns that were making such dreadful
havoc in their ranks. A charge was made upon him,
when Griffin resorted to grape and canister. At
every discharge whole companies melted away, and
the enemy fell back in confusion. But again they
advanced, and the Confederate cavalry giving away
at the instant, the battery was left at the mercy of
the enemy, who dashed upon it; but there the brave

320
men continued to stay, determined to remain at
their post to the last, for all knew the vital importance
of the position; and as the enemy pressed on
they were met with that never ceasing hail of canister,
until they reached the guns and rode over the
men, and sabred and captured them at their pieces.
Stuart had witnessed it all whilst rallying his broken
cavalry, when seizing the colors of the First
Virginia, he rode forward, exclaiming, âCharge,
Virginians, and save those brave Marylanders!â
Alas, it was his last command on the field of battle,
for at the instant he received a pistol shot, and
was conveyed mortally wounded from the field,
when his men precipitately retreated.

Nevertheless, in the confusion and excitement of
the moment, Lieutenant McNulty, with some of the
gallant fellows, actually drove two pieces off in triumph,
despite the efforts of the enemy to prevent
them.

In this desperate battle at Yellow Tavern, the
battery suffered the loss of many men and horses,
and two guns, and its brave commander was a
prisoner in the enemyâs hands.

Many were the acts of individual heroism displayed
whilst the battle lasted, one of which I will
narrate:

During the hottest of the fight private John
Hayden was struck by a piece of shell, and dreadfully
mangled, and would have bled to death in a
few minutes had not the Surgeon of the battery,

321
Dr. Wortham, carried him on his back into the
woods and staunched the hemorrhage. In a short
time the enemy had possession of the field, but
carefully concealing himself and his charge until
they had passed on, he that night carried Hayden to
a place of safety, where he eventually recovered.

With the two guns saved from the wreck of the
battery, Lieutenant McNulty crossed the Chickahominy,
closely pursued, and took position on the
right of the road, commanding the bridge, where,
by a vigorous fire, he checked the enemyâs advance
and covered the retreat. McNulty then pushed on
to Old Church and joined the main body, which had
been there reassembled.

On the 13th he was ordered to Hanover Junction,
where he joined the army of General Lee, with which
he remained until after the battle of Cold Harbor,
when he was ordered to Earlyâs command in the
Valley of Virginia.

After a march of six days, the battery reached
Waynesboroâ, where four days after it joined Early,

en route
for the Lower Valley. Here the battery
(now under the command of Lieutenant W. B.
Bean, who had been for some time absent) was
attached to General Bradley T. Johnsonâs brigade
of cavalry, which had the advance.

On the morning of the 4th of July, Johnson
approached Martinsburg, when he was charged by
about six hundred of the enemyâs cavalry, which
for a moment created some confusion in his ranks;

322
but a few well directed discharges of spherical-case
from Bean caused them to beat a precipitate retreat.

The command then pushed on and entered Martinsburg,
when they came suddenly upon a battalion
of women, dressed in their holiday attire, drawn up
on the sidewalks, as though bent on preventing
Johnson from taking possession of the town, or at
least their wagon train, ladened with ice cream,
confectionery, &c.; for the fair and unfair dames,
damsels and sweethearts of the troopers were about
to celebrate their great national holiday by a picnic,
when surprised by the naughty rebel Johnson,
upon whom they at once opened such a fusillade of
invectives in bad and not very choice English as to
compel him and his command to retire in disgust,
leaving them masters of the field.

From Martinsburg Johnson moved to Shepherdstown,
and crossed the Potomac into Maryland, and
took position on Catoctin Mountain, where he
encountered a force of the enemy with artillery, but
Bean soon drove them off, when they retired to
Frederick city, closely pursued by Johnsonâs cavalry.
Here, being reinforced, they made a stand within
the confines of the city, and opened fire from their
battery, protected by the houses. The fire was not
returned for some time, as Johnson was loth to open
his guns upon defenceless women and children, but
finally forbearance ceasing to be a virtue, he opened
his battery, and a sharp artillery fight continued
until night, when Johnson retired to the mountain
to await Earlyâs arrival.

323
Early having at length come up, Johnson with
his cavalry, and a section of the artillery under
command of Lieutenant J. McNulty, proceeded to
destroy the railroad bridges at Cockeysville, and this
accomplished, he made a rapid move around Baltimore,
and struck the Washington branch of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Beltsville, where a
large body of the enemyâs cavalry was met, which,
after a few shots from the battery and a charge from
the cavalry, broke and fled towards Washington in
the utmost confusion.

The battery, with Johnsonâs cavalry, covered
Earlyâs retreat from Washington, though it was but
seldom brought into requisition until the army
reached Poolsville, where the enemy made a vigorous
attack, but were kept in check by Johnsonâs
cavalry and artillery until the whole army had
crossed in safety.

On the 29th of July General Johnson was ordered
by General Early to accompany McCausland into
Pennsylvania and exact a stipulated sum of money
from the citizens of Chambersburg, or in case of
their not complying with that demand to burn the
town. The Baltimore Light Artillery was attached
to the brigade, and the whole crossed at McCoyâs
Ferry and proceeded on their way. Before day on
the morning of the 30th the advance approached
Chambersburg, and after feeling the place with a
few shells, and finding no enemy, the town was
entered and burned.

324
Retracing his steps to Virginia by way of Cumberland,
McCausland arrived at that place late in the
afternoon of the next day, and found his situation a
critical one. Kelly with a large force was in his
front, strongly posted behind breastworks, and
Averill was rapidly coming up in rear, and to avoid
the former he was compelled to move to the left and
take a different road from the one he had intended;
but as there was not a man in his command who
knew the country, this was not to be easily accomplished.
After some delay, Col. Harry Gilmor settled
the question by seizing a Union man who was
familiar with the different roads and fords, and with
a cocked revolver at his head compelled him to pilot
the way. In the night, four miles from Cumberland,
McCauslandâs advance encountered the enemy,
who were, after a brisk skirmish, driven back, when
McCausland determined to await the morning to
ascertain his position.

At the dawn of day the enemy was discovered in
line behind the crest of a range of hills between the
canal and river, when McNulty was ordered to post
his guns, and open the fight, whilst the cavalry dismounted
and crossed the canal on a bridge hastily
constructed by Captain Welsh of the First Maryland
Cavalry, when the enemy retired. But a more
formidable obstacle then presented itself in the shape
of an iron-clad battery mounted on an engine upon the
railroad, whilst the cars to which it was attached
were loop-holed for musketry, and the banks of the

325
railroad, which formed an excellent breastwork, was
lined with infantry. A very strong block house
that commanded every approach to the ford, was
also found strongly garrisoned.

Colonel Harry Gilmor was at once ordered to
carry the ford, which he attempted in most gallant
style, but was unable to reach the opposite bank
owing to the dreadful enfilading fire opened upon
him.

Lieutenant McNulty was then directed to take
position with his pieces, and open on the iron-clad.
Quickly moving his guns to an open field, and but
two hundred yards from the enemy, he unlimbered
at this much exposed point, and called upon his best
gunner, Geo. McElwee, to bring his piece to bear
upon the formidable looking mass of iron before
him. The brave fellow despite the shower of bullets
to which he was exposed, coolly sighted his
piece and fired, and when the smoke cleared away
McNulty had the satisfaction of seeing the huge
monster enveloped in steam, for the shot directed
by the unerring aim of McElwee had pierced the
boiler, and it lay a helpless wreck upon the track.
His next shot was as effective, and entered one of
the portholes, dismounting the guns and scattering
death and destruction around, when the enemy along
the bank broke and fled.

But there was yet the block house to dispose of
before the command could resume its retreat, and
minutes were becoming precious. An hour was

326
consumed in discussing the matter before anything
definite was determined upon, when General Johnson
suggested that an attempt be made to get a piece
of the artillery across the river. The suggestion
was instantly adopted, and under cover of the bank,
though subjected to a severe fire, the piece was
started over in a full run, and unlimbered in the
river, and taken to its bank by hand, when, at the
instant, a demand for the surrender of the block
house was complied with, and McCausland was safe.

At Moorefield, soon after, McCausland was surprised
in camp by Averill, when thirteen men of
the Baltimore Light Artillery were sabred and captured
at their guns in endeavoring to load them,
and two pieces were lost.

After this affair the remnant of the battery was
ordered to the vicinity of New Market, in the Valley
of Virginia, to be reorganized and equipped. Here
the number of the battery was considerably
increased by the transfer of Marylanders who had
served three years in Fort Sumter, and also by men
from Major Brethodâs old battery. Horses and guns
were furnished from the reserve artillery, and in a
short time Lieutenant McNulty (who had succeeded
to the command) found himself in a condition to
take the field.

Sheridan was about this time rapidly advancing
towards Staunton, and Early, with a small force,
had fallen back to Brownâs Gap, in the Blue Ridge.
McNulty was at once ordered to join him at Port
Republic, which he was enabled to do, by making a

327
detour, on the 27th of September. From Port
Republic Early moved towards Waynesboroâ, where
the head of his column met that of Sheridan, and
after a desperate fight drove him back up the Valley,
Early pursuing.

The scenes which these brave men were compelled
to witness as they pressed on after the brutal Sheridan
and his band of incendiaries were appalling,
indeed. Hundreds of poor, helpless women and
children were encountered on the road, fleeing to
a place of refuge, but knew not where to find it, for
other homes as well as their own had been plied
with the incendiariesâ torch. Pitiously they plead
for protection and a morsel of food from the rough
soldiers, but, alas, it was not within their power to
afford them either. Night after night the heavens
were illumined by the light of burning farmhouses,
barns, mills, &c., and day after day was made dark
by the dense smoke that filled the heavens. Surely,
Grant and his minion Sheridan will be long remembered
by the people of the Valley of Virginia, and
their names associated by them and their posterity
with all that is bad, brutal and vindictive.

Slight skirmishing ensued between the pursued
and pursuers until the former reached Fisherâs Hill,
where they met their infantry, when Lomax, in
command of the cavalry, retired to the vicinity of
Woodstock. At daylight next morning, the 8th of
October, Lomax and Rosser moved to attack the
enemy who had advanced to Maurytown. Rosser

328
was ordered to attack on the left, and Lomax took
the right, forming his troops on both sides of the
Valley pike. The Baltimore Light Artillery, under
Lieutenant McNulty, was stationed on an eminence
north of the town. The fight soon began with great
fury, Lomax and Rosser attacking simultaneously,
and the enemy were driven back some distance.
Heavy reinforcements coming to the support of the
enemy, he reformed his broken columns, and the
fight was waged with redoubled fury. Towards
noon Rosser, on the left, was overwhelmed, and
soon after the heavy columns massed in front of
Lomax, attacked furiously, and drove that General
back in the utmost confusion.

During this time the gallant McNulty and his
brave command were hurling death and destruction
into the ranks of the enemy, but to no avail. With
the retreat of the cavalry under Lomax, McNulty
limbered up and sullenly fell back, unlimbering at
every available point, and opening his fire upon the
pursuing foe, thus enabling the cavalry to escape.
In this manner the village of Woodstock was
reached. Still through its streets he continued to
pour into the faces of the advancing enemy destructive
discharges of grape and canister. But the gallant
little battery is doomed, for the enemy press
upon them in overwhelming numbers, and still they
disdain to abandon their pieces. Beyond the town
they make one more effort to stay the dense masses
now almost enveloping them, but even as the gunners

329
are ramming home the last double charge of
canister, they are captured and cut down in the act.

Twenty-three men and the four guns fell into
the hands of the enemy. Lieutenant McNulty who
had had his horse killed under him, with the balance
of his men fought their way through, and
escaped.

For his gallantry upon this occasion, McNulty
was placed in command of a battalion of artillery,
and the command of the Baltimore Light Artillery
devolved upon Lieutenant John W. Goodman,
Junior Second Lieutenant.

Soon after the disastrous fight at Maurytown,
Goodman was ordered to Fishersville, where the
little left of Earlyâs artillery were preparing their
winter quarters. Whilst here every effort was
made to procure guns, horses, &c, for the battery,
to replace those lost in their last fight, but without
success, for the Confederate Government had none
to spare. But the brave fellows were ready for any
duty that might be assigned them, and when
Sheridan, in March, threatened Lynchburg, they
gladly obeyed the summons to repair to that place
and assist in its defence in any capacity. But their
services were not required, and they were in a few
days after ordered to Petersburg, to help man the
fortifications there.

When the great crash came, and the little army
under General Lee was forced to retreat before
Grantâs overwhelming masses, along with the rest

330
was to be found the remnant of the Baltimore Light
Artilleryâone day fighting as infantry, and the
next as cavalry, or assisting some battery in trouble.
Noble fellows, like their comrades of the
Maryland Line, they were true to the cause they
had espoused to the last, and, like the Infantry and
Cavalry, were determined to fight on whilst a ray
of hope remained. Alas! that last ray disappeared
with Leeâs surrender at Appomattox Court House,
and when told they were disarmed, and no more to
be led against the enemy, these veterans, who had
unhesitatingly faced death in all its dreadful shapes
on so many bloody fields, wept like children.
Surely Maryland should be proud of her âYoung
Lineâ in the Confederate States Army, as she was
of her âOldâ in the days of the Revolution.

END OF THE âMARYLAND LINE.â

331

ATKINSâ BRIGADE

AT

SECOND MANASSAS.

The campaign before Richmond had ended, and
McClellanâs shattered and beaten army was
reorganizing upon the banks of the James. Our
loss had also been severe, for the enemyâs artillery
had played with fearful effect upon our dense
masses at Malvern Hill; and we, too, had much to
do before again prepared for the field. But the
untiring and indomitable Jackson was soon once
more at the head of his legions, and marching
rapidly in search of Pope, whose advance, under
Banks, was reported in the vicinity of Cedar
Mountain.

The First Maryland Regiment of Infantry, under
the command of Colonel Bradley T. Johnson, (and
to which I belonged,) having suffered severely in
the many desperate battles of the summer, had been
ordered to Gordonsville to recruit, directly after
the battles around Richmond, and it was whilst

332
there the thunder of Jacksonâs cannon announced
that he had once more encountered the âCommissary
of the Valley,â and we did not for a moment doubt
the result.

It was on the evening of the 17th of August, if
I mistake not, that a long line of prisoners arrived
from the battle-field, who were turned over to Colonel
Johnson, to be forwarded at once to Richmond.
My company was the fortunate one detailed for the
service, and taking a train about 10 oâclock that
night, we reached our destination shortly after daylight
next morning.

After having marched my charge to Libby, and
seen them properly cared for, I strolled up the street
in hopes of meeting an acquaintance or two; but
failing in this, and feeling an unpleasant gnawing
at my stomach, I dropped in at Zetelleâs for breakfast.
Whilst waiting for my beefsteak and coffee,
and indulging in a glass of Marco Bruner, I was
awakened from a reverie by a heavy footfall upon
the stairway, and to my inexpressible delight the
familiar form of Captain Atkins appeared as the
door opened.

âAnd how the divil are you, Captain; glad to
see yez. Arrah! its a mane thrick theâve been
afther playing us, begorrah!â he exclaimed, as he
took a seat at the table. âDid yez see the morningâs
papers? If yez havnât, it will be worth your
while to get them. Donât you think the hathens
have disbanded your regiment and my battalion;
bad luck to them.â

333
I was astounded at the intelligence, and could not
credit it for a moment; but when the papers were
produced, there was the order, sure enough, over
the signature of George W. Randolph, Secretary of
War.

âWell, whatâs to be done, Atkins? I am just
from the front, and feel convinced the army is on
its way into Maryland; and, under the circumstances,
donât like to leave the field. Come, as my
senior, suggest something.â

âAnd bless your soul, I will. And now for a
little private council of war betwane ourselves,â he
continued, in his usual rollicking way. âSuppose
we form a brigade of our own? Iâm sure thereâs
Grinnell, of my battalion; Shellman, of your regiment,
and whom I have just met; you and meself;
and a better brigade I wouldnât wish to command,
be me soul I wouldnât; and, if it plases yourself,
we will call it Atkinsâ Brigade.â

âIts a bargain; and now, Mr. Brigadier, issue
your first order.â

âAnd here it is: The officers under my command,
to be known as âAtkinsâ Brigade,â will muster their
forces, preparatory to laving for the scane of action,
one week from to-day. How will that do?â

âVery wellâall but the forces.â

âArrah! there you go again. Why in the divil
canât we be officers and privates too? I am sure
thereâs many brigades in the sarvice that canât muster
more an a liftenant.â

334
âVery well; hereâs my hand on it;â and we emptied
the bottle of Rheinish to the success of the new
brigade.

But a word of my companions: Atkins was an
Irish gentleman of fortune, but passionately fond
of military adventure. He first saw service in Garibaldiâs
Italian war, where he made the acquaintance
of the lamented Major Bob Wheat, and a
strong attachment was the result. At the breaking
out of the rebellion, Atkins came to this country,
and hunting up his old companion-in-arms, whom
he found encamped at Manassas, in command of a
Louisiana battalion, he entered the ranks as a private,
and at the First Manassas won his captainâs
stripes. He continued to serve in the command
with distinction up to the death of Wheat, and the
disbanding of the battalion as just stated.

Grinnell (a son of Henry Grinnell, one of the
merchant princes of New York) also came from
Europe at the breaking out of the war, sacrificing
a lucrative business, and joined the command of
Wheat also, as a first lieutenant. In the fight with
Kenlyâs forces at Front Royal, he had the misfortune
to lose a portion of his right hand by a piece
of shell, and had just been declared convalescent,
and was ready for the field, but found himself without
a command.

Shellman had practiced law in Frederick, Maryland,
and served with great credit as first lieutenant
of my company from its organization.

335
Never having kept a diary, reader, you will
excuse little discrepancies in dates, but I think it
was about the 22d of August that Atkins marshalled
his forces and marched them aboard a James River
canal boat,
en route
for the anticipated scene of
actionâI mean to say
we
were, and not the canal
boat. We were compelled to take this route owing
to the Central Road being taxed to its utmost capacity
in the transportation of troops to reinforce Leeâs
army, and therefore our only alternative was to go
by the way of Scottsville, Charlottesville, to Gordonsville,
etc.

Arriving at the former place, we hired a rickety
wagon, to which was attached a wretched specimen
of the mule kind, and after a long and tedious ride
made our
entre
into the ancient village of Charlotte,
not with the âpomp, pride and circumstance of
glorious war,â but amid the curses of an irate driver,
and such expressions as âmay the divil take
the ass and his master for hathans,â from our illustrious
brigadier.

A day of rest at the excellent hotel
de Farish
so
refreshed us that when we resumed our trip we felt
as though our brigade had assumed the proportions
of a division, and every one of us an officer. Rapidan
Station, the terminus of our trip by rail from
Charlottesville, was reached late in the afternoon,
and distributing our traps equally, we set out on foot
to overtake Longstreetâs corps, the rear of General
Leeâs army. Jackson had the advance, and was

336
making a forced march to get in the rear of Popeâs
army, at Manassas. Our march lay along the
Orange and Alexandria Railroad, through Culpepper,
where we diverged to the left and took the road
to Salem and the Plains. Shortly after leaving
Culpepper we overtook the stragglers and broken
down men of the armyâto be counted by thousands.
The majority of the poor fellowsâbarefooted
and with bleeding feetâwere struggling
manfully to reach their respective commands, whilst
others were quietly building shelters and laying in
a supply of green corn, to await, as they coolly
informed us, âthe return of the army.â

Marching rapidly, on the 28th day of the month
we came upon the rear of Longstreetâs corps in

bivouac
a mile or two from Thoroughfare Gap.
Heavy cannonading was going on in front, and upon
inquiring the reason for it, we were informed the
enemy in strong force were disputing the pass, but
that heavy columns of infantry had been sent over
the mountain to flank them, and it was not doubted
for a moment but the movement would succeed.

A council of war was now called by our commandant,
and the brigade unanimously resolved to
go into camp for the night, as Atkins declared,
âDivil the bit could he fight on an impty stomach,
at all, at all.â Selecting a little strip of woods
somewhat retired from the main body of the army,
the brigade went supperless to rest.

The sun was at least an hour high when we

337
awoke from our slumber, to find the corps of Longstreet
gone, and already several miles on its way to
relieve Jackson, who, rumor said, had been closely
pressed for two days by overwhelming numbers, and
with difficulty held his own. We arose feeling
gloomy enough. The roar of artillery had ceased,
as had the rattle of musketry of the previous
evening, and everything was still as death. Poor,
hapless little brigade, retiring supperless and arising
breakfastless. Shellman was the first to complain,
though having the least to sustain. âWho
ever heard of a command without a commissary?â
he muttered.

âArrah, Mr. Shellman, you see I am economizing,
for what in the divil is the use of having a commissary
when thereâs nothing to commissary, and the
Confideracy is poor enough, God knows, except in
shinplasters. Bad luck to ye.â

The argument was unanswerable, and Shellman
subsided, âAs we have no commissary to plase the
gintlemanâand Iâm blasted if I am much plased
meselfâI would suggest we went skrimmigen.â

The command responded aye unanimously, and,
rolling up our blankets, we prepared to move.
Resuming our march, we soon came to a neat, substantial
looking farm house, where it was determined
an effort should be made to procure breakfast
at any price in Confederate currency. We crossed
the fence and approached the house. Our commander
was to be the spokesman, but just as he

338
was about to apply his knuckles to the stout oaken
door, the clatter of horses feet was heard, and to
our no little surprise General Lee and staff galloped
up.

âThe brigade will retrate and rally on me, being
itâs in the presence of superior numbers, for by Saint
Patrick, for all the Confideracy, I wouldnât have
Gineral Lee see me besage a lone counthry house
without his orthers,â was the command of our brigadier.

The âretrateâ was conducted in good âorther,â
and the forces assembled upon the commandant some
two hundred yards distant. Here, after a short
consultation, we concluded to make another essay
upon a house close at hand. As we neared the
premises the prospect of success seemed discouraging
enough, for some twenty cavalry horses were
tied to the pailings, and experience had taught us
their riders were close by. Judge then of my surprise,
when upon inquiring for the proprietress of
the house I was confronted by an old and dear
acquaintance, Mrs. Hamilton, of Loudon county,
and now, at this writing, residing at Chantilly, on
the Little River turnpike. âTis needless to say the
party were made welcome, and in a few minutes we
were seated around a bountifully supplied table,
laughing and chatting merrily, the vexation of
our former disappointment forgotten. A quiet smoke
followed, when we prepared to part with this most
estimable family with unfeigned regret. The dear

339
old lady of the house, with tears in her eyes, bid us
farewell, and her last words were, âShould anything
happen to yourself or comrades, donât forget
my house.â I little thought but forty-eight hours
would elapse ere I was once more her guest, but
under vastly different circumstances. But of that
anon.

As we passed through Thoroughfare Gap there
were evidences on all sides of a stubborn fight, and
I could not help being struck with the vital importance
of possessing the place. It seemed almost a
ThermopylÃ¦, and it astonished me that it was not
defended by a larger force of the enemy. Had
General Lee been delayed here forty-eight hours we
would have lost Jackson and his command, and the
remainder of the army would have been compelled
to recross the Rappahannock. How imminent the
peril! But the masterly generalship of the peerless
Lee averted it, and the flanking columns across
the mountains soon removed every obstacle. But
no time was to be lost, for already we had been
delayed too long; and the incessant peals of artillery
in our front plainly told us Jackson was sorely
pressed, and needed our assistance.

How little the General whose âheadquarters
were in the saddle,â knew his advantage; for he
had it within his power to have annihilated the
Confederate army. But if we are to believe his own
report, and the account of his âMan Friday,â
(âPersonal recollection,â in that vilest of periodicalsâ
Harper
,)

340
the illustrious Pope had too many
generals in the field, and too many masters in
Washington. The âlamentedâ would telegraph
âdo this;â Halleck would say âdo that;â Fitz
John Porter would do nothing; McClellan sent the
commissary wagons to Washington, and it was but
natural the hungry troops should seek their rations
thereâall of which, combined âunsaddledâ poor
Pope, and placed McClellan in his stead.

More than once that night, as General Lee paced
his room, he was heard to mutter: âThe Gap must
be forced at any sacrifice. On the success of this
movement depends everything. General Jackson
must be hard pressed; but he
will
hold out, or I do
not know my man. Twenty-four hours behind my
promise to him; forty-eight hours would result in
his destruction.â

Friday, the 29th day of August, 1862, was a hot,
sultry day, and the corps of Longstreet, already
wearied and broken down by excessive marching,
dragged itself along with difficulty. Had it not
been for the stimulus afforded by the roar of Jacksonâs
artillery the ten long miles from Thoroughfare
Gap would have consumed much more time, and
there would have been many more stragglers. But
steadily those veterans pressed on, and before noon
the head of the column reached Haymarket, but a
short distance from the scene of conflict. We here
received the most encouraging accounts from Jackson.
He was not only holding his ground, but had

341
driven the enemy some distance before him. But
nevertheless an expression of relief must have
passed over that usually stern and placid face when
he observed the clouds of dust that heralded the
approach of the iron Longstreet.

Rapidly the different brigades and divisions were
thrown into position, and by three oâclock the line
of battle was complete. Longstreet held the right,
joining Jackson near the Groveton turnpike, and
about a mile from that village, where was stationed
Hood with his Texans, Virginians and Mississippians.
Being personally acquainted with the
General, I suggested to Atkins that he proffer the
services of the âbrigadeâ to him, which was readily
acceded to. That gallant, glorious, but subsequently
unfortunate officer, received us most cordially, but
regretted that for the present he could assign us
to no other duty than that of firing a musket.
Enfields were soon procured, and we took our place
in the ranks of the Fourth Texas, a regiment that
at the battle of Gaineâs Mills had won imperishable
laurels.

In the woods to the left Jackson was hotly
engaged. The musketry fire was terrific, and it
seemed neither to advance nor recede. A curtain of
smoke that hung over the tree-tops told us where
the fighting was going on, but not a soul could be
seen. For more than two hours this desperate
struggle continued, when a soldier or two in blue
emerged from the woods into the open plain, rushing

342
frantically in the direction of the Federal reserves.
Another and another followed, and presently a
heavily column, torn and shattered, broke forth
from the woods in wild confusion. A moment after,
in close pursuit, a column in grey appeared, moving
at the double-quick with the most beautiful
precision, though subjected to the fire of a battery of
artillery, which opened on them as soon as they
appeared. But the glorious column never wavered.
On, on, they pressed. The enemy was seeking protection
behind the battery. It mattered not, they
would take battery and infantry too; all the better.
Oh! how it made my heart ache as I saw the great
gaps rent by grape and canister as they pressed on
in this desperate charge. But âforwardâ was the
command, and âforwardâ they went. The battery
is neared; no hesitation there; and in an instant
it is enveloped by our grey jackets. A yell, a
wild Confederate yell, announced the success of the
charge, and in a moment we saw them retire with
hundreds of prisoners and the captured battery.

âGlorious, glorious,â exclaimed the heroic Hood,
at whose side I was standing, and who was most
anxiously watching the charge. âWho can it be?â

An aid-de-camp presently appeared riding at full
speed in the direction of General Leeâs headquarters.
Hood hailed him with, âWho made that
splendid charge?â

âBradley Johnson, in command of the Third
Virginia brigade,â was the response.

343
How my heart thrilled with pride and pleasure as
I heard the announcement; for it was my late
Colonel, fighting like the members of Atkinsâ
brigade, without a commission.

But what means this demonstration in our immediate
front? Cheer after cheer, huzza upon huzza,
and presently a long line of skirmishers appear over
the intervening hill. An attack beyond question.
They are met unhesitatingly by our skirmishers,
and a fierce fight ensues. But the dense, dark
column that now comes in view compels our advance
to fall back. But Hood, with his Texans, Virginians
and Mississippians, are in waiting. Rapidly
they approach, and musket balls are whistling in
every direction.

âLet them come a little closer,â I heard him
remark to a staff officer, âthey shall have a reception.â

Just then a voice behind us was heard to command,
âCharge, General, charge!â

Judge my feelings as I turned my head and saw
our beloved Lee sitting calmly upon his iron-grey,
with but a single aid, and exposed to this severe
fire.

But we had little time for reflection, for the clarion
voice of Hood was heard the next instant to âfix
bayonets,â and then came the command âforward,
double-quick,â and the long line of glittering steel
rushed madly down the hill.

The collision was awful, and the enemy was

344
unable to resist its force, though he stood to his
work manfully. Gallant men fell by hundreds on
both sides. The Federal troops gave way; and the
field was covered with thousands of fugitives. The
column in grey pressed on until it neared the village
of Groveton. What is this dark mass seen in the
twilight thundering down upon us, making the
very earth tremble? The column halts. On come
the gallant troopers. The sight is grand beyond
description. Nearer and nearer they approach.
They are almost upon us! âFire,â is the command,
and the heavens are lit up by the flash that
leaps along the line; and when the smoke lifts, hundreds
of riderless steeds are seen flying frantically
across the plain, whilst the ground in front of us
is covered with dead and wounded men and horses.

In the excitement of the fight I had lost sight of
my companions, and it was not until I heard a voice
with the Celtic twang exclaiming, âCatch a harse,
catch a harse,â that I was aware of the presence of
Atkins. âCatch a harse, catch a harse,â I heard
again, as a dozen riderless steeds dashed up the
turnpike, âfor Iâm blasted if my command shall be
infantry any longer.â Turning my head I saw him
making frantic efforts to secure one of the frightened
horses and his efforts were successful. I was
not so fortunate. Seizing a bridle, I was leading
my capture in triumph across the road, when giving
a sudden plunge, he wrenched the rein from my
hand and was off like the wind.

345
Leaving my companion in ecstacies over his prize,
I started after something to eat. But where was I
to get it? The wagons were far in the rear, and
being tired, I could not think of hunting them up.
A happy thought suggested itself. The Federal
soldiers generally carried a day or twoâs rations. I
will secure what some dead man has left. The idea
may shock the sensibilities of the reader with a
well-filled stomach, but a tired and hungry soldier
is not much troubled with such wares. Crossing
the Groveton road I threaded my way among the
dead and wounded with a melancholy interest. A
few minutes before the air had resounded with the
shouts of infuriated men, the roar of artillery, and
the rattle of small arms; but now all was still,
save an occasional picket shot, and the groans and
cries of those who had fallen wounded in the bloody
strife.

More than one dead manâs haversack did I examine
that night; but alas, some one as hungry as
myself had anticipated me. I had given the search
up in despair, and was returning to my companion,
when I stumbled over the body of a Federal soldier
that I did not see, owing to the darkness. A suppressed
groan escaped the poor wretch, and shocked
at my carelessness, I knelt at his side and asked if
I could do anything for him.

âWater, water, for Godâs sake water!â he plead.
Placing my canteen to his lips he drained it to the
last drop.

346
âNow turn me on my back that I may look once
more at the beautiful sky, and watch the bright
stars. Stranger, I see from your dress you are an
enemy, but in my dying moments I like you none
the less. Your turn may come next; and perhaps
you, too, will ask the same favor I have asked of
you.  God grant that you may receive it.â

His mind here wandered for some minutes, when
recovering, he continued: âOh it is hard to die
thus, away from home and friends; but it is a comfort
to have the presence of even one with whom I
have just been engaged in deadly strife, and for
aught I know inflicted this death wound. My poor
wife, my precious child. Stranger, perhaps you, too,
have a wife and child far away whom you love
dearly? Away up in Pennsylvania I had a happy
home, with a fond and loving wife. We were
blessed with one dear little babe, a boy. In an
evil hour I went to the war to fight for my countryâs
honor; how much better had I remained at home,
for there are plenty without me who have nothing to
leave behind.â

Again his mind wandered, and I heard him murmur:
âHow beautiful the heavens are to-night,
Emma, and how bright the stars. Come, Eddie, get
upon papaâs knee.â A pause, a convulsive shudder,
and with âMy wife, my child,â upon his lips, the
poor soldierâs spirit took its flight from earth.

And still, reader, this was but one incident of the
thousands that could have been gathered upon that
dreadful field.

347
Disengaging his well-filled haversack, I made my
way back to where I had left my companion. To
my surprise he had heard nothing of either Shellman
or Grinnell; and we began to fear they had
fallen in the fight. However, they may be at the
rendezvous appointed, and thither we directed our
steps.

We found them there, and unhurt, but engaged
in a violent dispute as to which had killed the most
Yankees in the fight.

âWhy, Grinnell,â said Shellman, âdidnât you
see that officer fall when I fired?â

âI saw an officer fall,â replied Grinnell, âbut I
tell you your gun didnât go off. And I will tell
you whatâs more, you didnât fire a shot during the
fight, but you did a devil of a sight of loading.â

âAnâ be me soul, Liftinent Shellman, anâ I
belave Grinnell is right,â put in Atkins, âfor
divil the wonst did I see the thing go off, anâ Iâll
prove it by the crather itself, I will.â

The Enfield was produced, and to the âLiftinentâsâ
chagrin the barrel was found to contain at
least half a dozen cartridges.

âAnâ itâs a pretty command I have, to be sure.
What would Gineral Lee think if I told him one of
my âbrigadeâ put his cartridges in his gun upside
down? Anâ thin the sarious consequinces that
might ensue. Faith, anâ it might cost the Confideracy
its independence.â

âI donât think you have much the advantage of

348
me, Mr. Atkins, for you did nothing but run after
loose horses,â retorted Shellman.

âDid you ever hear the like oâ that? To spake
in that way to his commander. Anâ thin he called
me
Misther Atkins
, too; bad luck to yez.â

I put an end to the controversy by announcing
the contents of the dead soldierâs haversack.

âFourteen crackers, a pound of salt horse, a
well-filled bag of coffee, and several little articles
that I will examine to-morrow.â

A fire was soon kindled, and we proceeded to
boil the coffee. As I untied the string around
the little bag, I could not but think of the hand,
now cold and stiff in death, that had so carefully
tied it that morning; and during the repast, at
every mouthful, âMy wife, my child,â was ringing
in my ears.

Considerably refreshed, I wrapped my blanket
around me and lay down to rest, and was soon in
a sound sleep, from which I was awakened in the
morning by Atkins soliloquizing:

âAnâ it was a sin anâ a shame to trate the poor
dumb baste so, anâ so it was. Laving out that
bullet hole in the nose, anâ the one in the left fore
leg, anâ the one in the hind quarther, anâ the divil
knows how many more, for I havnât been on the
other side of him, heâs as beautiful a crather as I
ever saw. Be me soul heâs the very picture of an
Irish hunter, he is.â

Rising from my blanket I approached the disconsolate

349
Atkins, who was engaged in taking a survey
of his capture of the previous evening, and upon
inquiring the reason for his lamentations, he pointed
to a dreadful wound in the horseâs left fore leg, but
which had escaped our notice in the darkness of the
evening, and said:

âLook what those hathens of Hoodâs have done
to this poor dumb baste, the very picture of a
staple-chaser. Anâ there, too, anâ there, anâ there,â
pointing to as many wounds, âbe me soul, if the
rider got as many heâs as dead as Paddyâs pig.â

âWhat disposition are you going to make of
him?â I ventured to inquire.

âTake him along wid us, to be sure. Canât he
carry our traps. Iâm astonished that you should
ax such a question. If you had been wid Whate
and meself in Italyââ

Not caring to be bored for an hour with this his
favorite subject, I interrupted him by inquiring the
name he intended to give his steed?

Scratching his head for a moment, he replied,
âPegassus; anâ what do you think of that for a
name?â

âA devil of a Pegassus,â remarked Shellman,
who had joined us.

âAnâ who axed you for your say, misther six-shooter,
who canât appraciate an Irishmanâs joke?â

âAnd why Pegassus?â inquired Shellman.

âWhy donât you see the crather has been
winged
,
but divil the bit do I belave thereâs much
fly
in
him.â

350
After partaking of a cup of coffee and a cracker
or two, the remains of the poor dead soldierâs
rations, I shouldered my Enfield, and bidding my
companions remain until I returned, started off
in search of Colonel (afterwards General) Bradley T.
Johnson, whose command we had determined to
join.

Moving rapidly across the field, subjected to a
sharp fire from the enemyâs sharpshooters, I reached
the cover of a friendly woods in safety. Meeting a
horseman, I inquired the Colonelâs whereabouts, and
was informed it was but a short distance ahead.

âI am going that way myself,â said he, âand
will with pleasure pilot you. I perceive from your
uniform that you are a Captain, and presume you
belong to his command.â

I informed him of the circumstances that had
placed me with the army, and told him I thought
it most likely âAtkinsâ Brigadeâ could render
more efficient service as officers in some of the
depleted regiments, than as privates as we were.

âI assure you,â said the stranger, âit would
gratify me much should you accept a command in
my brigade, for I have suffered fearfully in officers
during the past three days.â

âWhat brigade do you command,â I inquired.

âThe Second Louisiana. My name is Starke,
sir, General Starke, and I am immediately on the
left of Johnson. Should he have no place to assign
you to, call upon me.â

351
After pointing out Johnsonâs command, the General
put spurs to his horse and disappeared. Poor
fellow, I never saw him after, for he rendered up his
precious life in battling for his beloved South upon
the bloody field of Sharpsburg.

I found Colonel Johnson with his brigade drawn
up in line of battle close by the edge of a woods,
and in momentary expectation of an attack.

âHow do you do, Captain?â he greeted me, âthe
very man I wished most to see. Here I am in command
of a brigade without officers. The Forty-eighth
Virginia has but two Lieutenants left. Come,
let me introduce you to Dabney. He is at present
in command of the regiment, and I know will not
hesitate to surrender it to you at my suggestion.â

I found Lieutenant Dabney a most agreeable
young gentleman, and he cheerfully tendered me
the command of his regiment.

I then informed the Colonel of the obligation I
was under to return to my companions, but he would
not listen to it for a moment.

Johnson then explained to me the situation.
Immediately in our front, and distant some two
hundred yards, was a railroad cut. This was considered
the key to the position, and was to be fought
for to the last extremity. âYou will therefore take
fifty of your men and place them under cover of that
thicket to the right, in close proximity to the excavation,
and keep me advised of all you see and hear.â

I detailed my fifty men, and after taking a careful

352
survey of the ground I was to traverse, made a run
for it across the field amidst a shower of bullets
from the enemyâs sharpshooters, but which fortunately
did no execution. Shortly after reaching the
designated point I had the misfortune to lose the
services of Lieutenant Dabney by the accidental
explosion of his pistol, and I had, therefore, but
one officer left.

We had been there perhaps an hour when I
became convinced from hearing the command âforward,
guide centre,â repeatedly given in the woods
some four hundred yards distant in our immediate
front, that the enemy was massing for an attack.
Finding my men reluctant to take the risk of
recrossing the field with a message to the Colonel,
I was compelled to go myself. Placing them under
the command of a Sergeant, I made the attempt
and reached the brigade in safety. I reported to
Johnson what I had heard; and at his suggestion
we walked to the brow of the hill before us, and to
our astonishment beheld three lines of battle emerging
from the woods, and moving rapidly upon the
railroad excavation.

It was out of the question for me to return to my
fifty men, and I should not have gone if I could,
for the greater portion of my command was with
the brigade. Rushing back therefore with him, the
command âforward, double-quick,â was instantly
given, and then commenced a wild race as to which
should reach the much coveted point first. As we

353
emerged from the woods, and became exposed to the
view of the enemyâs artillery, he opened a terrible
fire, which was returned with interest upon his
advancing columns by thirty pieces of our artillery
on a plateau to the right of us.

We reached the opposite banks of the cut simultaneously,
and then began one of the most desperate
and bloody conflicts of the war. Muzzle to muzzle,
each delivered their fire into the very bosoms of
their foe. Dead and wounded men fell by hundreds,
and many on both sides rolled down the
embankment and intermingled at the bottom. The
importance of the place was known to each, and
each was determined to possess it. The appearance
of Colonel Johnson upon that field I shall never forget.
But few men had ever before had so important
a trust imposed in them, and there he intended to
win or die. Never have I seen such sublime courage
displayed upon the field of battle. In his shirt
sleeves, his eye flashing, his lips compressed, he was
everywhere encouraging his men. Three different
times he ran along his line, the target for many a
bullet, and how he escaped unscathed that awful fire,
God only knows.

But the enemy are too strong for us, and our
right begins to swing back, contesting every inch
of ground. And the enemyâs left cross the cut.
At this moment a man fell at my side. Picking up
his musket, I leveled it and fired, and when in the
act of lowering the piece, I felt a sharp pain in the

354
fore part of my left arm, and glancing at it, discovered
I was hit. Even as I did so, I received a tremendous
blow in my left side, and was knocked off
my feet, and fell heavily to the ground. Our troops
giving way left me midway between the contending
forces, and never did a poor devil more heartily
wish himself away from a warm place than I did
from this, for the bullets were knocking up the dust
all about me; but I knew to move even a limb
would draw the fire of the enemy, and I contented
myself with laying still, and watching the progress
of the fight. The combatants surged backwards
and forwards as each gained or lost some temporary
advantage; but the tide of battle was evidently fast
going against Johnson. The enemy were too
strong for him; still he fought on. Everything
seemed lost, and Jacksonâs corps will surely be cut
in two. Why do not the reserves come up?

Hark! What means that wild yell, and that
cracking and crashing in the woods behind us?
Hurrah! it is Starke with his Louisianians. It was
a grand sight as those grim veterans emerged from
the woods on the run. Nothing on earth could
withstand the impetuosity of their charge, and the
foemen were swept back across the cut like chaff, and
the position was ours.

Fearing I should be struck by some of the many
flying bullets, I determined to get under the friendly
cover of the position won, and after many efforts
succeeded in getting on my hands and knees, and

355
dragging myself to the bank, quietly rolled down.
It was well I did so, for the enemy were not
going to give it up without another effort. Fresh
troops advanced, and the conflict was renewed with
redoubled fury. Steadily the column in blue moved
forward in the face of the terrible fire of the Confederates,
and reached the very edge of the embankment.
Our ammunition was giving out. No
matter, stones lay around in abundance, and were
hurled with desperate energy.

âBad luck to yez, there goes my last cartridge,â
I heard an Irishman exclaim at my side. Remembering
I had two packages in my jacket pocket that
I had found in the haversack of the previous evening,
I requested him to take them out. As he did so he
uttered an exultant shout, and with a âCome on yez
dâd Yankees, its Louisianians yer fitin now,â
resumed his firing.

For at least fifteen minutes this desperate hand to
hand conflict continued, when the enemy began
to give way and scatter in every direction to avoid
our fire. But the artillery to the right, which for
some time had been silent owing to the proximity of
the contending forces, now opened upon the dense
mass with grape and canister at point blank range,
and the slaughter was horrible until the fugitives
reached the cover of the woods.

On the right, in Longstreetâs front, the battle
still raged, but long before nightfall it ceased; the
second battle of Manassas was won, and our army
in close pursuit.

356
The excitement of the fight over, I began to
think seriously of my own condition. I had lost a
great deal of blood, and was almost in a state of
collapse. The dying words of the poor soldier who
expired in my arms the evening before, more than
once occurred to me: âYour turn may come next.â
And had it come? And then: âOh, âtis hard to
die thus, away from home and friends; but it
is a comfort to have the presence of even one
with whom I have just been engaged in deadly
strife.â But no ministering hand was there. I
was alone with those still in death, and others like
myself writhing in mortal agony. No one near me
to take a last message to my home, or to tell how I
died. But I am burning up with thirst.

âWater, water, for Godâs sake water!â rang
in my ears, and I envied the poor wretch the few
drops I had given him the previous evening.
Gradually I grew more faint; I felt as though
I was being whirled round and round with fearful
rapidity. Round and round, faster and faster, and
I lost all consciousness.

I must have remained in this swoon some time,
and when I recovered I found Dr. Richard Johnson
and the noble Irishman, Atkins, at my side.

âAh, this is a divil of a pretty mess,â was the
first words I heard. âThis is what you get for disobeying
orthers. Had ye remained wid your legitimate
command this wouldnât have happened.
Hereâs Grinnell, Shellman and meself as sound as

357
a new quarther. Oh, the hathens, to trate one of
âAtkins Brigadeâ so mane a thrick.â

All night I lay on the field, attended by Dr.
Johnson and my good ex-commander, and next
morning, was placed in an ambulance and conveyed
to Mrs. Hamiltonâs, where I was received as a
brother and a son by the family. For weeks I languished
upon a bed of sickness, nursed with the
care and tenderness of an infant by every member
of the family, when I was declared convalescent, and
made my way to Richmond.

I here met my late companions, who had returned
from the campaign in Maryland in safety, and we
more than once talked over incidents that attended
âAtkinsâ Brigade at the Second Manassas.â

THE END.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

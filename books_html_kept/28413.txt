PREFACE

The object of this book is to give in a convenient form
all the facts of importance relating to the lives and works
of the principal Latin Authors, with full quotation of original
authorities on all the chief points. It appears to us that
these facts are not at present readily accessible; for the
ordinary histories of literature are compelled to sacrifice
much exact information to the demand for a critical appreciation
of the authors. The latter aspect does not enter
into the plan of this book, which may therefore, with
advantage, be used side by side with any work of the kind
indicated, the two supplementing one another. The authors
have been, as far as possible, illustrated from their own
works. Special attention has been paid to the great writers,
as the book is meant for use in the upper forms of
schools and by students at the Universities. We had collected
a considerable amount of matter upon the minor
authors, most of which it was thought advisable to omit,
so as not to extend the book unduly. An attempt, however,
has been made to retain the most important facts
about these, whenever they illustrated one of the great
authors, or whenever it was thought that they ought
to be in the hands of a student. We have attempted no
treatment of early Latin as seen in inscriptions and the
like, but have started with the first literary author, Livius
Andronicus, and have gone down to Tacitus and the
younger Pliny, dealing with each author by himself. A
section has been added on Suetonius. A sketch of the
chief ancient authorities on Roman writers is given at
the end of the book, as well as a selected list of editions,
which, without being exhaustive, will, we hope, be of service
to the average student.

Apart from our own study of the authors, our principal
authority has, of course, been the
History of Roman Literature

by Teuffel and Schwabe (translated by Prof. G. C. W.
Warr), and we have made an extensive use of editions
and monographs both English and foreign, which are
mentioned where necessary. Ennius has been quoted from
Vahlen’s edition, Plautus from the new edition of Ritschl,
the fragments of the tragedians and comedians from Ribbeck,
of Lucilius from L. MÃ¼ller, and of the minor poets from
BÃ¤hrens, the minor historians from Peter’s
Fragmenta
, and
Suetonius’ fragmentary works from Reifferscheid.

Some of our materials were originally prepared for the
Humanity classes in Aberdeen University, and the Latin
Literary Club in connexion with the Honours class. We
have to thank some of our pupils for help and criticism,
particularly Mr. A. Souter, of Gonville and Caius College,
Cambridge, and Mr. A. G. Wright, of St. John’s College,
Cambridge, the latter of whom prepared the materials for
the article on Tibullus, and gave us some useful suggestions.
We are specially indebted to Professor W. M.
Ramsay, without whom the book would not have been
written. Professor Ramsay has read nearly the whole of
the work as it has passed through the press, and has
all along given us invaluable assistance and advice. For
any errors in the following pages we are, of course, solely
responsible.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The authors ask me to write a word of introduction to
their book; but an introduction is not needed when the
book supplies a want and is trustworthy in what it says. As
to the second point, the text will speak for itself. On the
first, a word may be permitted about my own experience in
lecturing. The young student of Latin Literature requires
help in two ways. In the first place, he needs guidance in
learning to recognize and appreciate the literary merit of
the authors. Mr. Cruttwell’s, and, still better, Mr. Mackail’s
book, will serve his purpose well. They are interesting to
read, and they tempt him on to study for himself. Mr.
Mackail’s book, especially, shows delicate literary feeling,
and a remarkably catholic and true sense of literary merit.
But, secondly, the student wants a clear statement of the
facts, certain or probable, about the life of each author, the
chronology of his works, and their relation to the circumstances
and personages of the time. Neither of the books
which I have named is satisfactory in this respect. Both
of them omit a large number of facts and theories which the
student ought to have before him: Mr. Cruttwell occasionally
even sinks to inaccuracy.

About three years ago I suggested to Mr. Middleton that
he should try to fill up this gap with a book, in which he
should bring together all the information that a student
should have ready to his hand in reading the more familiar
classical authors, that he should keep down the size of his
book by omitting all that the student does not want, and
that he should set before his readers the evidence on which
each fact rests, so that they might be led to form opinions
and judgments of their own. Teuffel-Schwabe’s great work
contains a vast deal that the ordinary student does not
want; and it does not contain a certain amount which will,
I believe, be found in the present book, the materials for
which have been gathered from a wide range of reading.

I am convinced that much can be done to stimulate and
invigorate the young student’s feeling for Latin literature by
helping him to feel for himself how each author’s words
spring from his life, and conversely how facts and circumstances
of his life can be elicited from his words. There
will always remain doubts as to the facts and dates,
e.g.
, in
Horace’s or in Catullus’ life; but any reasoned theory has
its interest, and is better for the pupil than no theory. The
present book will, as I hope, be found useful as an aid to
that method of teaching and of study, provided that both
teacher and pupil bear in mind that it is a companion to
other books—not a book complete in itself.

COMPANION TO LATIN AUTHORS

CHAPTER I.

EARLY POETS AND PROSE WRITERS.

LIVIUS ANDRONICUS.

(1) LIFE.

L. Livius Andronicus, according to the poet Accius, was
taken prisoner at the capture of Tarentum by Q. Fabius
Maximus in
B.C.
209, and exhibited his first play in
B.C.
197.

Cic.
Brut.
72-3, ‘Accius a Q. Maximo quintum consule
captum Tarenti scripsit Livium annis xxx. postquam eum
fabulam docuisse et Atticus scribit et nos in antiquis
commentariis invenimus: docuisse autem fabulam annis
post xi., C. Cornelio Q. Minucio coss. ludis Iuventatis,
quos Salinator Senensi proelio voverat.’

But ancient evidence is unanimous that he was the
first literary writer of Rome, and this is confirmed by his
archaic language. Hence the statement of Cicero
ibid.
,
that Livius produced his first play in
B.C.
240, must be
accepted.

‘Atque hic Livius, qui primus fabulam, C. Claudio
Caeci filio et M. Tuditano coss., docuit anno ipso antequam
natus est Ennius; post Romam conditam autem
quarto decimo et quingentesimo ... In quo tantus error
Acci fuit, ut his consulibus xl. annos natus Ennius fuerit:
cui si aequalis fuerit Livius, minor fuit aliquanto is, qui
primus fabulam dedit, quam ei, qui multas docuerant ante
hos consules, et Plautus et Naevius.’

Cf. Cic.
Tusc.
i. 3, and Gell. xvii. 21, 42.

Probably Accius, finding in his authorities that Livius
was taken prisoner at the capture of Tarentum (
i.e.
in

B.C.
272), wrongly thought of the second capture by Fabius.
In spite of Cicero’s correction, the error of Accius was,
we may infer, reproduced by Suetonius, and thus penetrated
into Jerome, who says, yr. Abr. 1830 =
B.C.
187,
‘T. [an error] Livius tragoediarum scriptor clarus habetur,
qui ob ingenii meritum a Livio Salinatore, cuius liberos
erudiebat, libertate donatus est.’

It is probable that Livius was the slave of C. Livius
Salinator, the father of the victor of Sena (M. Livius
Salinator), and taught the latter; for he must have been
set free before
B.C.
240, and the victor of Sena could
hardly have been born earlier than
B.C.
258. This connexion
made M. Livius Salinator when consul,
B.C.
207,
select Livius Andronicus to prepare a hymn of expiation
to the Aventine Juno, and, probably in the same year,
to compose a hymn of thanksgiving for the success of
Rome in the Hannibalic War. For his services the privileges
of a guild were assigned to writers and actors.

Livy xxvii. 37, ‘Decrevere pontifices ut virgines ter
novenae per urbem euntes carmen canerent ... conditum
ab Livio poeta ... Carmen in Iunonem reginam canentes
ibant illa tempestate forsitan laudabile rudibus ingeniis,
nunc abhorrens et inconditum, si referatur.’

Fest. p. 333, ‘Cum Livius Andronicus bello Punico secundo
scripsisset carmen quod a virginibus est cantatum, quia
prosperius res publica populi Romani geri coepta est, publice
attributa est ei in Aventino aedis Minervae, in qua
liceret scribis histrionibusque consistere ac dona ponere,
in honorem Livi, quia is et scribebat fabulas et agebat.’

Livius had a twofold reason for writing, (
a
) To assist
him in his profession as a schoolmaster he published a
translation of the
Odyssey
; (
b
) as an actor, he wrote the
plays he acted, and afterwards published them.

Sueton.
Gramm.
1, ‘Livium et Ennium ... quos utraque
lingua domi forisque docuisse adnotatum est.’

Livy vii. 2, 8, ‘Livius ... qui ab saturis ausus est primus
argumento fabulam serere, idem scilicet, id quod omnes
tum erant, suorum carminum actor.’

(2) WORKS.

1.
Tragedies.
—From the scanty fragments extant and
from the titles (
Achilles
,
Aegisthus
, and six others are
known) we see that these were close imitations of Greek
plays. Thus l. 38 (Ribbeck),

‘Quem ego nefrendem alui lacteam immulgens opem,’

is, according to Conington, a rendering of Aesch.

NAEVIUS.

(1) LIFE.

Cn. Naevius’ dates can only be given approximately as

B.C.
269-199. As he served in the First Punic War,
he cannot in any case have been born later than
B.C.
257.
He was a Campanian by birth.

Gell. i. 24, 2, ‘Epigramma Naevi plenum superbiae
Campanae, quod testimonium esse iustum potuisset, nisi
ab ipso dictum esset,

“Inmortales mortales si foret fas flere,

flerent divae Camenae Naevium poetam.

Itaque postquam est Orci traditus thesauro,

obliti sunt Romae loquier lingua Latina.”’

Naevius’ first play was produced
B.C.
235; the fact that
he served as a soldier shows that he was not an actor.

Gell. xvii. 21, 45, ‘Eodem anno (
A.U.C.

D
xix.) Cn. Naevius
poeta fabulas apud populum dedit, quem M. Varro in
libris de poetis primo stipendia fecisse ait bello Poenico
primo, idque ipsum Naevium dicere in eo carmine, quod
de eodem bello scripsit.’

In his plays he attacked the senatorial party, particularly
the Metelli, and was imprisoned, but afterwards released.

Gell. iii. 3, 15, ‘Sicuti de Naevio quoque accepimus,
fabulas eum in carcere duas scripsisse, Hariolum et
Leontem, cum ob assiduam maledicentiam et probra in
principes civitatis de Graecorum poetarum more dicta in
vincula Romae a triumviris coniectus esset. Unde post a
tribunis plebis exemptus est, cum in his, quas supra dixi,
fabulis delicta sua et petulantias dictorum, quibus multos
ante laeserat, diluisset.’

Pseud.-Asconius on Cic.
in Verr. act. prior
, 29. ‘Dictum
facete et contumeliose in Metellos antiquum Naevii est,
“Fato Metelli Romai fiunt consules,” cui tunc Metellus
consul (
B.C.
206) iratus versu responderat ..., “Dabunt
malum Metelli Naevio poetae.”’

Cf. the contemporary reference in Plaut.
Mil.
212,

‘Nam os columnatum poetae esse indaudivi barbaro,
[2]

quoi bini custodes semper totis horis occubant.’

For Naevius’ freedom of speech cf. his comedies, l. 113
(Ribbeck),

‘Libera lingua loquemur ludis Liberalibus’;

l. 108 (on Scipio),

‘Etiam qui res magnas manu saepe gessit gloriose,

cuius facta viva nunc vigent, qui apud gentes solus praestat,

eum suus pater cum palliod unod ab amica abduxit.’

Naevius was banished and went to Utica, where he
died, probably about
B.C.
199. It must have been after
peace was concluded (
B.C.
202), as otherwise he could have
reached Utica only by deserting to the enemy.
[3]
Jerome
gives
B.C.
201, Cicero
B.C.
204, although he says Varro
put the date later. The verses on Scipio quoted above
could hardly have been written before the battle of Zama.

Jerome yr. Abr. 1816 =
B.C.
201, ‘Naevius comicus Uticae
moritur, pulsus Roma factione nobilium, ac praecipue
Metelli.’

Cic.
Brut.
60, ‘His consulibus (
B.C.
204), ut in veteribus
commentariis scriptum est, Naevius est mortuus; quamquam
Varro noster, diligentissimus investigator antiquitatis,
putat in hoc erratum vitamque Naevi producit longius.’

(2) WORKS.

1.
Tragedies
.—There are extant seven titles and a very
few fragments.

2.
Comedies
.—There are titles of about thirty-four

palliatae
,
[4]
and upwards of one hundred and thirty lines extant.

Naevius seems to have adopted
contaminatio
[5]
in his
plays. Ter.
Andr.
prol. 15,

‘Id isti vituperant factum atque in eo disputant

contaminari non decere fabulas ...

qui quom hunc accusant, Naevium Plautum Ennium

accusant.’

3.
Praetextae
.—Tragedies on Roman subjects, ‘Clastidium’
and ‘Romulus.’ The
praetexta
was invented by
Naevius.

4.
Bellum Punicum
, an epic poem in Saturnians, divided
later into seven Books. About seventy-four lines are
extant.

Sueton.
Gramm.
2, ‘C. Octavius Lampadio Naevii Punicum
bellum, uno volumine et continenti scriptura expositum,
divisit in septem libros.’

Books i. and ii. contained the mythical origin of Rome
and Carthage, Aeneas’ flight from Troy and his sojourn at
the court of Dido in Carthage. In Book iii. the history
of the First Punic War commenced. The work was imitated
by Ennius and Virgil, sometimes closely by the latter. Cf.
Servius on
Aen.
i. 198-207, ‘O socii,’ etc. ‘Et totus hic
locus de Naevio belli Punici libro translatus est.’
Ibid.

i. 273, ‘Naevius et Ennius Aeneae ex filia nepotem Romulum
conditorem urbis tradunt.’

Macrob.
Saturn.
vi. 2, 31, ‘In principio Aeneidos tempestas
describitur et Venus apud Iovem queritur.... Hic
locus totus sumptus a Naevio est ex primo libro belli
Punici.’

PLAUTUS

(1) LIFE.

Plautus’ full name, T. Maccius Plautus, was discovered
by Ritschl in the Ambrosian (Milan) palimpsest, which
gives,
e.g.
after the two plays named: ‘T. Macci Plauti
Casina explicit’: ‘Macci Plauti Epidicus explicit.’ In
Plaut.
Merc.
l. 6, the
MS.
reading
Mactici
was emended by
Ritschl to
Macci Titi
; and in
Asin.
prol. l. 11,
Maccius
is
the right reading. The
MSS.
read
Maccus
, which BÃ¼cheler
(
Rhein. Mus.
41, 12) takes to mean ‘buffoon,’ or ‘writer
of comedies,’ from which Plautus took his family name,
Maccius, on becoming a Roman citizen. ‘M. Accius,’
formerly supposed to be the name, is found in no
MS.
,
but ‘Accius’ is found in
Epitome Festi
, p. 239, which gives
us the poet’s birthplace, Sarsina in Umbria, and suggests
another derivation for his name: ‘Ploti appellantur, qui
sunt planis pedibus, unde et poeta Accius, quia Umber
Sarsinas erat, a pedum planitie initio Plotus, postea
Plautus est dictus.’

In the corresponding passage of Festus, we have only
‘...us poeta, quia Umber,’ etc. The name of the poet
is lost, and the epitomizer has doubtless made a mistake.

Sarsina is mentioned once by Plautus,
Mostell.
770,

‘Quid? Sarsinatis ecquast, si Umbram non habes?’

The year of his birth can only be conjectured; he
died
B.C.
184.

Cic.
Brut.
60, ‘Plautus P. Claudio L. Porcio coss.
mortuus est.’

Jerome erroneously assigns Plautus’ death to yr. Abr.
1817 =
B.C.
200, ‘Plautus ex Umbria Sarsinas Romae
moritur, qui propter annonae difficultatem ad molas manuarias
pistori se locaverat; ibi quotiens ab opere vacaret,
scribere fabulas et vendere sollicitius consueverat.’

From this notice, and from the passage of Gellius below,
we learn that Plautus lost in foreign trade the money he
had made as an assistant to scenic artists, and had to
work for his living in a flour mill at Rome, during
which time he wrote plays, and continued to do so
afterwards.

Gell. iii. 3, 14, ‘Saturionem et Addictum et tertiam
quamdam, cuius nunc mihi nomen non subpetit, in pistrino
eum scripsisse, Varro et plerique alii memoriae tradiderunt
cum, pecunia omni, quam in operis artificum scaenicorum
pepererat, in mercatibus perdita inops Romam redisset et
ob quaerendum victum ad circumagendas molas, quae
“trusatiles” appellantur, operam pistori locasset.’

We conclude from these varied employments that
Plautus can hardly have been less than thirty years old
when he began to write plays. His intimacy with the
Scipios (Cic.
de Rep.
iv., apud Augustin.
Civ. D.
ii. 9), who
fell in Spain
B.C.
212, leads to the conclusion that he must
have been well established as an author by that date,
though none of his plays can be proved to have been
written so early. If we suppose that his career as a
playwright commenced at thirty, and that his acquaintance
with the Scipios lasted ten years, the year of his birth
must have been about
B.C.
254. This view is supported
(1) by the notice in Cic.
Brut.
73, that Plautus had
produced many plays by
B.C.
197; (2) by Cic.
Cato maior
,
50, ‘quam gaudebat ... Truculento Plautus, quam Pseudolo,’
where Plautus is said to have written these plays as
senex
.
Now the
Pseudolus
was written
B.C.
191; and therefore, as
a man could not be called
senex
till he was at least sixty,
his birth must have been not later than
B.C.
251.

Plautus is said to have written his own epitaph.

Gell. i. 24, 3, ‘Epigramma Plauti, quod dubitassemus
an Plauti foret, nisi a M. Varrone positum esset in libro
de poetis primo:

“Postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, Comoedia luget,

Scaena est deserta, ac dein Risus, Ludus Iocusque,

et Numeri innumeri simul omnes conlacrimarunt.”’

(2) WORKS.

Plautus’ plays were early criticized as to their genuineness.
Gell. iii. 3, 1-3, after mentioning the canons of Aelius Stilo,
Sedigitus, etc., says that Varro admitted twenty-one plays
which were given by all the canons, and added some more.
‘Nam praeter illas unam et viginti, quae Varronianae
vocantur, quas idcirco a ceteris segregavit, quoniam dubiosae
non erant, set consensu omnium Plauti esse censebantur,
quasdam item alias probavit adductus filo atque facetia
sermonis Plauto congruentis easque iam nominibus aliorum
occupatas Plauto vindicavit.’

About one hundred and thirty plays were current under
the name of Plautus; the theory of Varro (Gell. iii. 3, 10)
that these were written by a certain Plautius is improbable.

Gell. iii. 3, 11, ‘Feruntur sub Plauti nomine comoediae
circiter centum atque triginta.’

There is little doubt that the ‘fabulae Varronianae’ are
those which have come down to us with the addition of
the
Vidularia
, which was lost between the sixth and the
eleventh centuries. The number of Varro’s second class,
consisting of those pieces that stood in most of the indices
and exhibited Plautine features, Ritschl has fixed at nineteen,
from citations in Varro
de lingua Latina
. Besides
the genuine plays the names of thirty-two others are known.

The extant plays
[6]
are as follows:

1.
Amphitruo
, a
tragicomoedia
, the only play of Plautus
of the kind. Prol. 59,

‘Faciam ut conmixta sit haec tragicomoedia.’

The original and the date are unknown. The play shows
the features of the Sicilian
Rhinthonica
.
[7]
About three
hundred lines have been lost after Act. iv., Scene 2.
The scene is Thebes, which, with Roman carelessness or
ignorance, is made a harbour; cf. ll. 629
sqq.

2.
Asinaria
(sc.
fabula
), from the
á¾½ÎÎ½Î±Î³ÏÏ
of Demophilus,
supposed to have been a writer of the New Comedy.
Prol. 10-12,

‘Huic nomen Graece Onagost fabulae;

Demophilus scripsit, Maccius vortit barbare.

Asinariam volt esse, si per vos licet.’

Authorities assign the play to about
B.C.
194. The scene
is Athens.

3.
Aulularia
(from
aulula
, ‘a little pot.’)—Neither the
original nor the exact time of composition is known. From
Megadorus’ tirade against the luxury of women, ll. 478

sqq.
, it has been inferred that the play was written after the
repeal of the Oppian Law in
B.C.
195. The end of the
play is lost. The scene is Athens.

4.
Captivi
, a piece without active interest (
stataria
),
without female characters, and claiming a moral purpose;
l. 1029,

‘Spectatores, ad pudicos mores facta haec fabulast.’

Some authorities think that the parasite (Ergasilus) is an
addition to the original play, which may have belonged to
the New Comedy. The scene is in Aetolia.

5.
Curculio
, so called from the name of the parasite.
The Greek original is unknown; but ll. 462-86 contain a
speech from the Choragus, in the style of the
ÏÎ±Ïá½±Î²Î±ÏÎ¹Ï

of the Old Comedy. In l. 509,

‘Rogitationes plurumas propter vos populus scivit

quas vos rogatas rumpitis,’

there is probably an allusion to the Lex Sempronia de
pecunia credita,
B.C.
193. The scene is Epidaurus.

6.
Casina
, so called from a slave-girl introduced. The
original was the
ÎÎ»Î·ÏÎ¿á½»Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¹
of Diphilus. Prol. 31,

‘Clerumenoe vocatur haec comoedia

Graece, Latine Sortientes. Deiphilus

hanc Graece scripsit.’

The inference from l. 979, ‘Nam ecastor nunc Bacchae
nullae ludunt,’ that the play was written after the S.C. de
Bacchanalibus in
B.C.
186, is improbable; the words rather
show, as Mommsen
[8]
believes, an anterior date, when it
was not yet dangerous to speak of the Bacchanalia. Some
authorities find support for the latter date in the words
of the prologue, ll. 9-20 (written after the poet’s death).
The text of the play has suffered greatly. The scene is
Athens.

7.
Cistellaria
.—This play contains a reference to the
war against Hannibal then going on; ll. 197
sqq.
,

‘Bene valete, et vincite

virtute vera, quod fecistis antidhac, ...

ut vobis victi Poeni poenas sufferant.’

According to Ritschl, about 600 verses have been lost.
The scene is Sicyon.

8.
Epidicus
.—This play is referred to in the
Bacchides
,
ll. 213-5 (spoken by Chrysalus), where the unpopularity of
the play is attributed to the acting of Pellio.

‘Non res, sed actor mihi cor odio sauciat.

Etiam Epidicum, quam ego fabulam aeque ac me ipsum amo,

nullam aeque invitus specto, si agit Pellio.’

Epid.
222,

‘Sed vestita, aurata, ornata ut lepide! ut concinne! ut nove!’ etc.,

shows that the piece was written after the repeal of the
Lex Oppia Sumptuaria,
B.C.
195. The plot is complicated,
and
contaminatio
is assumed by some authorities. The
play contains only seven hundred and thirty-three lines,
and some believe it to be a stage edition. The scene is
Athens.

9.
Bacchides
.—The first part of this play, along with the
last part of the
Aulularia
,
[9]
has been lost, as also the prefaces
of the grammarians, so that we do not know what was in
the first part. The original was probably Menander’s
Îá½¶Ï á¼Î¾Î±ÏÎ±Ïá¿¶Î½
.
Plautus appears to refer to this twice, l. 1090,

‘Perii: pudet. Hocine me aetatis
ludos bis factum
esse indigne’;

l. 1128,

‘Pol hodie altera iam
bis detonsa
certost.’

The line,
á½Î½ Î¿á¼± Î¸ÎµÎ¿á½¶ ÏÎ¹Î»Î¿á¿¦ÏÎ¹Î½, á¼ÏÎ¿Î¸Î½á¿ÏÎºÎµÎ¹ Î½á½³Î¿Ï
, which belongs
to the same play (Stobaeus,
Serm
. 120, 8) is translated in
ll. 816-7,

‘quem di diligunt

adulescens moritur.’

The date is pretty well fixed by l. 1073,

‘Quod non triumpho: pervolgatumst, nil moror.’

Now, triumphs were not frequent till after the Second Punic
War, and were especially frequent from
B.C.
197 to 187.
The play probably refers to the four triumphs of
B.C.
189,
and may have been brought out in that or the following
year. The scene is Athens.

10.
Mostellaria
(sc.
fabula
, ‘a play dealing with a ghost,’
from
mostellum
, dim. of
monstrum
).—The play is quoted by
Festus, p. 166, as ‘Mostellaria’; pp. 162 and 305, as
‘Phasma.’ According to Ritschl, the
Î¦á½±ÏÎ¼Î±
of Philemon
was Plautus’ model. The reference to
unguenta exotica

(l. 42) points to a late date, when Asiatic luxury was
growing common. The play is imitated in Ben Jonson’s

Alchemist
. The scene is Athens.

11.
Menaechmi
.—If ll. 409
sqq.
, ‘Syracusis ... ubi rex ...
nunc Hierost,’ were written independently by Plautus, the
date must be before
B.C.
215; but the reference may only
mean that the Greek original was composed between 275
and 215
B.C.
It has been conjectured that a comedy by
Posidippus (possibly called
Îá½·Î´Ï
Î¼Î¿Î¹
) was the original, from
Athenaeus, xiv. p. 658,
Î¿á½Î´á½² Î³á½°Ï á¼Î½ Îµá½ÏÎ¿Î¹ ÏÎ¹Ï á½Î¼á¿¶Î½ Î´Î¿á¿¦Î»á½¹Î½ ÏÎ¹Î½Î±
Î¼á½±Î³ÎµÎ¹ÏÎ¿Î½ á¼Î½ ÎºÏÎ¼á¿³Î´á½·á¾³ ÏÎ»á½´Î½ ÏÎ±Ïá½° Î Î¿ÏÎµÎ¹Î´á½·ÏÏá¿³ Î¼á½¹Î½á¿³
. Now, the

Menaechmi
is the only play of Plautus where a cook is a
house-slave, Cylindrus being the slave of Erotium; in his
other plays cooks are hired from the Forum. The scene
is Epidamnus.

12.
Miles Gloriosus
.—In ll. 211-2 (the only personal
allusion in Plautus),

‘Nam os columnatum poetae esse indaudivi barbaro,

quoi bini custodes semper totis horis occubant,’

we have a reference to the imprisonment of Naevius, which
shows that the play was written before his banishment,
probably
B.C.
206-5 (
see under ‘Naevius’
). Line 1016,
‘Cedo signum, si harum Baccharum es,’ shows that the
play is anterior to
B.C.
186.

The original is the
á¼Î»Î±Î¶á½½Î½
of some Greek poet. Cf.
ll. 86-7,

‘Alazon Graece huic nomen est comoediae:

id nos Latine gloriosum dicimus.’

The play, however, exhibits
contaminatio
. Two distinct
actions, the cheating of Sceledrus (Act i.) and the cheating
of the Miles (Acts ii. and iii.), are united rather loosely;
and it has been conjectured that Menander’s
Îá½¹Î»Î±Î¾
, or
(according to Ritschl) Diphilus’
Îá¼±ÏÎ·ÏÎ¹ÏÎµá½·ÏÎ·Ï
, was the play
used. Ritschl’s view is perhaps supported by the word

urbicape
in l. 1055. The play is the longest
palliata
preserved.
The scene is Ephesus.

13.
Mercator
.—The original is Philemon’s
á¼Î¼ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¿Ï
;
ll. 5-6,

‘Graece haec vocatur Emporos Philemonis;

eadem Latine Mercator Macci Titi.’

Some light is thrown on the date by ll. 524-6.

‘
L.
Ovem tibi eccillam dabo, natam annos sexaginta,

peculiarem.
P.
Mei senex, tam vetulam?
L.
Generis Graeci est.

Eam sei curabeis, perbonast; tondetur nimium scite.’

This could not have been written before
B.C.
196, the date
of the settlement of Greece. The play shows traces of
two distinct editions. The scene is Athens.

14.
Pseudolus
.—The Greek original is unknown. The
date of production (
B.C.
191) is got from the didascalia,
as restored by Ritschl, ‘M. Iunio M. fil. pr. urb. acta
Megalesiis.’ The Megalesian games were held in that
year in honour of the dedication of the temple which
had been vowed to Cybele,
B.C.
204 (Livy, xxxvi. 36).
‘Pseudolus’ =
Î¨ÎµÏ
Î´á½»Î»Î¿Ï
, but is connected by popular etymology
with
dolus
. Cf. the puns in l. 1205,

‘Edepol hominem verberonem Pseudolum, ut docte dolum

commentust’;

l. 1244,

‘Superavit dolum Troianum atque Ulixem Pseudolus.’

Several references to the play are found in Cicero:
Cato
Maior
, 50 (quoted
p. 9
);
Phil.
ii. 15;
pro Rosc. Com.

20. The scene is Athens.

15.
Poenulus
.—The original was a Greek play,
ÎÎ±ÏÏÎ·Î´á½¹Î½Î¹Î¿Ï
,
the author of which is unknown, as the fragments of Menander’s

ÎÎ±ÏÏÎ·Î´á½¹Î½Î¹Î¿Ï
do not fit in with Plautus’ play. The
play was called by Plautus ‘Patruus,’ but posterity went
back to the older name ‘Poenulus.’ Prol. 53,

‘Carchedonius vocatur haec comoedia

Graece, Latine Patruus Pultiphagonidae.’
[10]

Authorities assign the play to
B.C.
189. The play is considerably
interpolated, one ending being at l. 1371, another
at l. 1422, whence some authorities have considered ll. 1372-1422 as spurious. Ritschl thinks that the two endings are
about the same age, and compares the double ending of
the
Andria
of Terence. The play is noted for the two
Carthaginian renderings of the soliloquy of Hanno, ll. 930-9,
and ll. 940-9. The scene is Calydon in Aetolia.

16.
Persa
.—This play, the original of which is unknown,
has been variously assigned to 197 and 186
B.C.
The play
shows traces of two distinct editions. The scene is Athens.

17.
Rudens
.—This play has been assigned to about

B.C.
192. The original is by Diphilus; and the scene is
Cyrene. Prol., 1. 32,

‘Primumdum huic esse nomen urbi Diphilus

Cyrenas voluit.’

18.
Stichus
, performed
B.C.
200
ludis plebeis
, as we learn
from the didascalia, ‘Graeca Adelphoe Menandru acta
ludis plebeis Cn. Baebio C. Terentio aed. pl. ... C. Sulpicio
C. Aurelio coss.’ This cannot be the
Adelphi
imitated by
Terence, the fragments of which do not bear the least
resemblance to the
Stichus
. It may be a second
Adelphi

by Menander. Others read ‘Philadelphoe’ in the above
didascalia. Part of the play has been lost, and it shows
traces of two distinct editions. The scene is Athens.

19.
Trinummus
.—The original was Philemon’s
ÎÎ·ÏÎ±Ï
Ïá½¹Ï
,
as seen from the didascalia, ‘Graeca Thensaurus Philemonis
acta ludis Megalensibus.’ Some indication of the date is
got from l. 990,

‘Vapulabis meo arbitratud et novorum aedilium.’

The only festival that would suit the term
novi aediles
is
the
ludi Megalenses
[11]
as from
B.C.
266 to 153 the new
magistrates entered on office on the Ides of March. This
festival was not of a scenic character till
B.C.
194, consequently
the
Trinummus
must be after that date. The
mention of Syrian slaves in l. 542 also makes it probable
that this is one of the latest works of Plautus. The scene
is Athens.

20.
Truculentus
.—The original is unknown. The play
was written in Plautus’ old age, probably about

B.C.
189. The text has suffered greatly. The scene is
Athens.

21.
Vidularia
.—Only fragments are extant. It is thought
to have been modelled on a play called
Î£ÏÎµÎ´á½·Î±
by Menander.

Argumenta.
—These are in
senarii
, and give a summary
of each play. Two sets are found. The first set are
acrostic, and are extant for all the plays except the
Vidularia

and the
Bacchides
. The second series was probably
written by Sulpicius Apollinaris in the second century
A.D.

There are only five of them extant in the
MSS.
, and
fragments of other two.

Prologues.
—These (which were usual in the Old and the
New Comedy) gave the name of the piece and the author,
the original and its author, the scene of the play, and a
partial list of characters. In the Prologue also the poet
often asked the favour of the audience. Prologues to
fourteen plays are extant. The part of the prologue Plautus
(like the New Comedy) assigned either to a god, as in
the
Rudens
to Arcturus, or to one of the characters, as
in the
Mercator
to a youth (cf.
Mil.
and
Amph.
), or to
an actor addressing the audience in the name of the poet,
as in the
Truculentus
. All the prologues have suffered
from interpolation, but those of
Amph.
,
Merc.
,
Rud.
, and

Trin.
, and the second parts of those of
Mil.
and
Aul.
,
are founded on what Plautus wrote. The prologues in

Cas.
,
Poen.
, and
Capt.
, are due to later hands. That the
prologues are interpolated is shown by their diction; the
wit is often poor, and the language un-Plautine, or imitated
closely from Plautus’ genuine works. The prologues in
their present form probably date from a period shortly
after that in which Terence flourished, when there was a
want of new plays, and people went back to Plautus.
This is shown by the references to fixed seats for the
spectators (
Poen.
15,
Amph.
65, and
Capt.
11), which were
forbidden by a S.C. passed in
B.C.
154, when Cassius
Longinus began to build a theatre of stone—a law that
was not repealed till some years later. Cf.
Capt.
11,

‘Negat hercle ille ultimis accensus. Cedito:

si non ubi sedeas locus est, est ubi ambules.’

The Acts.
—The plays of Plautus probably went on with
few breaks, during which the audience were entertained
with music. Cf.
Pseud.
573,

‘Tibicen vos interea hic delectaverit.’

Diverbium and Canticum.
—There was no chorus in
Roman comedy, but part of the play was set to music and
sung to the flute. Some
MSS.
denote this by C (Canticum);
while DV (usually placed only over iambic senarii) denotes
dialogue or soliloquy (Diverbium). Iambic senarii were
spoken; other metres were sung; but the scenes in septenarii
stood midway between the dialogue and the
canticum
.
Only about a fourth of Plautus’ verses are in iambic
senarii, while in Terence, who followed Menander in this
respect, about half of the verses are in this form.

The Characters.
—These, with the occasional exception of
slaves, are un-Roman, and exhibit Greek traits belonging
to Athens of the time of the New Comedy. Plautus,
unlike Terence, usually alters the names used in the
original Greek plays, and substitutes ‘tell-tale names’; so
Parmeno (
ÏÎ±ÏÎ±Î¼á½³Î½ÏÎ½
), ‘the faithful slave’; Polemo, ‘the
soldier’; Misargyrides, playfully for the
tarpessita
(banker).
The names are often of Latin derivation; thus Saturio, in

Pers.
; Peniculus, in
Menaech.
; Curculio, in
Curc.

The Language of Plautus
, in spite of the Greek dress
his plays assume, represents essentially the conversational
language of his time. Many Greek features in language
are, however, retained. For words kept in the original
Greek cf.
ÏÎ±á¿¦ÏÎ±Î¹
,
Î¿á¼´ÏÎµÏÎ±Î¹
,
Îµá½Î³Îµ
,
Ïá½±Î»Î¹Î½
,
á¼ÏÎ¹Î¸á½µÎºÎ·Î½
(all in the

Trin.
); for Greek words Latinized cf.
gynaeceum
,
parasitus
,

opsonium
,
dapsilis
(=
Î´Î±ÏÎ¹Î»á½µÏ
); for hybrid new formations
based on Greek cf.
thensaurarius
,
plagipatidae
,
opsonari
,

pultiphagus
.

References to manners and customs.
—(
a
) Many references
to Greek life are retained from the original, especially in
matters relating to dress, art, and money (Plautus has no
reference to Roman money). Such are
chlamys
,
petasus
,

pallium
,
cyathus
,
cantharus
,
thermopolium
,
cerussa
,
melinum

(
pigmentum
),
gynaeceum
,
balineae
,
ambulacrum
,
porticus
,

fores Samiae
(
Menaech.
178),
nummus
(= drachma or
didrachma),
nummi Philippei
,
mina
,
tarpessita
,
symbolus
,

epistula
. Cf. also
Pseud.
146-7,

‘Ut ne peristromata quidem aeque picta sint Campanica,

neque Alexandrina beluata tonsilia tappetia.’

(
b
) There are, however, innumerable references to Roman
public life and manners and customs, even in passages
manifestly close to the original, although references to
public events are rare.

1.
Military expressions.
—These, many of which are
used metaphorically, were well adapted for an audience
most of whom had seen service. The following are from
the
Miles
:
legiones
,
imperator
,
peditastelli
,
rogare
,
latrocinari
,

stipendium
,
conscribere
,
contubernales
,
eques
,
pedes
,
machinas
parare
. Cf. also
Pseud.
148,

‘Dederamque suas provincias’;

Pseud.
572,

‘Dum concenturio in corde sycophantias’;

Bacch.
709,

‘De ducentis nummis primum intendam ballistam in senem:

ea ballista si pervortam turrim et propugnacula,

recta porta invadam extemplo in oppidum antiquom et vetus.’

All references, however, to the enrolment of mercenaries
(
latrones
) are probably Greek and belong to the original
play.

2.
Political expressions.
—(
a
) Names of officials, etc.
So
tresviri
,
quaestor
,
aedilis
,
praetor
,
senatus
. Cf.
Trin.
879,

‘Census quom sum iuratori recte rationem dedi’;

Pseud.
1232,

‘Centuriata habuit capitis comitia.’

(
b
) Law. So
advocatus
(
Mil.
663),
festuca
(
Mil.
961),

lege agito
(
Mil.
453). Cf.
Menaech.
571-95 (on patrons
and clients);
Trin.
500-4, where Roman terms of
stipulatio

are used.

3.
Festivals and localities.
—References to these are rarer.
Examples are:
Mil.
691,

‘Da, mi vir, Calendis meam qui matrem moenerem’;

Trin.
545,

‘Campans genus’;

Trin.
609,

‘Tam modo, inquit Praenestinus.’

Mil.
359,

‘Credo ego istoc exemplo tibi esse pereundum extra portam’;

a reference to the Esquiline gate, outside which slaves
were executed.

4.
Private life.
—These references are mostly to the
lower classes, especially slaves, with whom Plautus was
very familiar. Hence words referring to household duties,
as
promus
,
suppromus
,
cella
,
cellarius
,
verna
,
pulmentum

(from
Mil.
) To their patois also belong phrases for
cheating, like
emungere
,
intervortere
,
sarcinam imponere
,

ducere
,
ductare
,
circumducere
, and the very large number of
words relating to punishment, as:
furcifer
,
verbero
,
supplicium
virgarum
,
varius virgis
,
talos frangere
,
crux
,
verberea
statua
(
Pseud.
911);
gymnasium flagri
(
Asin.
297). Cf. also

Epid.
17,

‘Quid ais? perpetuen valuisti?—Varie.’

From slave life come also terms of abuse like
volturius
,

scelus
,
odium populi
,
mers mala
,
lapis
,
saxum
. Note that
cruelty in the treatment of slaves is peculiarly Roman;
but their familiarity with their masters and their general
situation are from Greek life.

Prosody.
[12]
—Plautine prosody, which reflected the variation
of quantity found in the popular speech, was not properly
understood even in Cicero’s time.

Cf. Cic.
Or.
184, ‘Comicorum senarii propter similitudinem
sermonis sic saepe sunt abiecti ut non numquam
vix in eis numerus et versus intellegi possit.’

The chief points are as follows:

1. Final -s is often lost.
Rud.
103,

‘PatÃ©r, salveto, ambÃ³que adeo. Et tu sÃ¡lvÅs sis’;

Most.
1124,

‘QuÃ³que modo dominum Ã¡dvenientem sÃ©rvos ludificÃ¡tÅ­s sit.’

2. A mute followed by a liquid does not make the preceding
vowel long. Thus
agris
,
libros
,
duplex
, are iambi.

3. Iambic words may become pyrrhics, on account of
the stress accent on the first syllable. So
dÅmÄ«
and
cÄvÄ

have the last syllable short.
[13]

Trin.
868,

‘FÃ³rÄ­s pultabo. Ad nÃ³stras aedis hÃ­c quidem habet rectÃ¡m viam’;

Stich.
99,

‘BÃ³nÄs ut aequomst fÃ¡cere facitis, quÃ³m tamen absentÃ­s viros.’

4. The stress accent sometimes causes final syllables to
be dropped, and so to have no effect on quantity, as in

enim
,
apud
,
quidem
,
parum
,
soror
,
caput
,
amant
,
habent
,
etc.
Trin.
77,

‘Qui in mÃ©ntem venÄ­t tibi Ã­staec dicta dÃ­cere?’

Stich.
18 (anapaestic),

‘Haec rÃ©s vitae me, sÃ³rÅr, saturant.’

No shortening, however, takes place when the accent goes
back to the antepenult (cf.
continÄ
), nor in words like
aetas
,

mores
, where the first syllable is long, nor even in
abi
,
tene
,

tace
, and the like, when the chief accent is weakened,
i.e., where these words are pronounced slowly and emphatically
(especially before a pause).
Asin.
543,

‘Intro abÄ«: nam tÃ© quidem edepol nÃ­hil est inpudÃ©ntius.’

5. This influence of the chief accent affects also combinations
of two monosyllabic words which make an iambus,
and combinations like
ego illi
,
age ergo
, in which the second
syllable of the second word is elided.
Trin.
354,

‘Is Äst inmunis, quoÃ­ nihil est qui mÃºnus fungatÃºr suom’;

Trin.
133,

‘Non Ã©go Ä­lli argentum rÃ©dderem? Non rÃ©dderes’;

Stich.
237,

‘AdÃ­bo ad hominem. QuÃ­s haÄc est quae advorsÃºm venit?’

6. The chief accent could also affect a preceding syllable.
In polysyllables or polysyllabic combinations, when the
chief accent was on the third syllable, the second syllable,
if long, could be shortened, provided the first syllable were
short.
Trin.
456,

‘FerÄntÃ¡rium esse amÃ­cum inventum intÃ©llego’;

Stich.
59,

‘NÃ©c volÅ­ntate id fÃ¡cere meminit,’ etc.;

Stich.
179,

‘Per ÄnnÃ³nam caram dÃ­xit me natÃºm pater.’

7. The following common words have to be separately
considered,
ille
,
iste
,
unde
,
inde
,
nempe
. In the last three
the liquid was practically dropped;
iste
was pronounced
as
ste
; and in
ille
only one
l
was heard, cf.
ellum
,
ellam

(
en-illum
=
en-ilum
=
en-lum
=
ellum
).
Frustra
is a trochee,

The hiatus is commonest in monosyllabic words, or words
ending in a short syllable followed by

Views on Plautus.
—For Cicero’s high opinion of Plautus
cf.
de Off.
i. 104, ‘Duplex omnino est iocandi genus: unum
inliberale petulans, flagitiosum obscaenum, alterum elegans
urbanum, ingeniosum facetum. Quo genere non modo
Plautus noster et Atticorum antiqua comoedia, sed etiam
philosophorum Socraticorum libri referti sunt.’

Horace’s unfavourable judgment is well known.

Ep.
ii, 1, 170,

‘Adspice Plautus

quo pacto partis tutetur amantis ephebi,

ut patris attenti, lenonis ut insidiosi,

quantus sit Dossenus edacibus in parasitis,

quam non adstricto percurrat pulpita socco.

Gestit enim nummum in loculos demittere, post hoc

securus cadat an recto stet fabula talo.’

Cf.
A.P.
270-4. Cf. also Quint. x. 1, 99, ‘In comoedia
maxime claudicamus, licet Varro Musas, Aelii Stilonis
sententia, Plautino dicat sermone locuturas fuisse, si Latine
loqui vellent.’

ENNIUS.
[14]

(1) LIFE.

Q. Ennius was born
B.C.
239 at Rudiae in Calabria
(about nineteen miles south of Brundisium).

Gell. xvii. 21, 43, ‘Consoles secuntur Q. Valerius et
C. Mamilius, quibus natum esse Q. Ennium poetam M.
Varro in primo de poetis libro scripsit eumque, cum septimum
et sexagesimum annum haberet, duodecimum annalem
scripsisse, idque ipsum Ennium in eodem libro dicere.’
(Cf. Cic.
Tusc.
i. 3.) Enn.
Ann.
l. 440,

‘Nos sumus Romani qui fuimus ante Rudini.’

Servius,
in Aen.
vii. 691, ‘(At Messapus equom domitor):
Ab hoc Ennius dicit se originem ducere.’ (Enn.
Ann.
xviii.
fr. 6.)

Ennius knew Greek, Latin, and Oscan. Latin he may
have known as a boy, since the colony of Brundisium was
founded
B.C.
244; the use of Greek had been widely spread
in South Italy through the influence of the Greek colonies.
[15]

Gell. xvii. 17, 1, ‘Q. Ennius tria corda habere sese dicebat,
quod loqui Graece et Osce et Latine sciret.’

Ennius came to Sardinia during the Second Punic War,
probably with other Calabrian auxiliaries, but in what year
is doubtful. Silius Italicus xii. 387
sqq.
, says he was
centurion
B.C.
215, and distinguished himself greatly; but
his account is quite untrustworthy. In Sardinia he made
the acquaintance of M. Porcius Cato, then quaestor, who
induced him to come to Rome
B.C.
204.

Nep.
Cato
, i. 4, ‘Praetor (
B.C.
198) provinciam obtinuit
Sardiniam, ex qua, quaestor superiore tempore ex Africa
decedens, Q. Ennium poetam deduxerat.’

The poet’s Graecizing influence seems to have led afterwards
to hostility between him and his patron, but in spite
of this, Ennius appears to have cherished warm feelings
towards Cato, and praised his exploits in the
Annals
.

Cic.
Tusc.
i. 3, ‘Oratio Catonis, in qua obiecit ut probrum
M. Nobiliori quod is in provinciam poetas duxisset. Duxerat
autem consul ille in Aetoliam, ut scimus, Ennium.’

Cic.
pro Arch.
22, ‘In caelum huius proavus Cato
tollitur: magnus honos populi Romani rebus adiungitur.’

So far as is known, Ennius was at Rome
B.C.
204-189.
He lived plainly, and supported himself by teaching Latin
and Greek.

Jerome yr. Abr. 1777 =
B.C.
240, ‘Q. Ennius poeta Tarenti
[an error] nascitur, qui a Catone quaestore Romam translatus
habitavit in monte Aventino, parco admodum sumptu
contentus, et unius ancillae ministerio.’

Sueton.
Gramm.
1, ‘Livium et Ennium, quos utraque
lingua domi forisque docuisse adnotatum est.’

At Rome he was on familiar terms with the elder Scipio
Africanus and his brother Cornelius Nasica, and their
circle.

Cic.
pro Arch.
22, ‘Carus fuit Africano superiori noster
Ennius; itaque etiam in sepulchro Scipionum putatur is
esse constitutus ex marmore.’

A pleasant story of his relations with Nasica is given
by Cic.
de Or.
ii. 276. Two epigrams on Scipio (Nos. 2
and 3) are extant.

In
B.C.
189 Ennius accepted an invitation from M.
Fulvius Nobilior to accompany him in his campaign
against the Aetolians, and be a witness of his exploits.
Fulvius’ victory gave the poet materials for the praetexta

Ambracia
, and Book xv. of the
Annals
.

Cic.
pro Arch.
27, ‘Ille qui cum Aetolis Ennio comite
bellavit Fulvius.’ Cf. Cic.
Tusc.
i. 3 (above).

In
B.C.
184 the poet received the Roman citizenship
through the son of Fulvius, Q. Nobilior. Hence ‘nos
sumus Romani, qui fuimus ante Rudini’ (above). He
also received a grant of land at Potentia or Pisaurum
from Fulvius, who was then
triumvir coloniae deducendae
.

Cic.
Brut.
79, ‘Q. Nobiliorem M. f. ..., qui etiam Q.
Ennium, qui cum patre eius in Aetolia militaverat, civitate
donavit, cum triumvir coloniam deduxisset.’

Ennius probably spent the greater part of his days, after
returning from the Aetolian war, at Rome; and during this
period he was on intimate terms with the comic poet
Caecilius Statius (see
p. 37
). He was often in indifferent
circumstances, in spite of the grant of land he had received.
Ennius died of gout
B.C.
169.

Cic.
Cato Maior
, 14, ‘Annos septuaginta natus—tot enim
vixit Ennius—ita ferebat duo quae maxima putantur onera,
paupertatem et senectutem, ut eis paene delectari videretur.’

Cic.
Brut.
78, ‘Hoc [C. Sulpicio Gallo] praetore ludos
Apollini faciente, cum Thyesten fabulam docuisset, Q.
Marcio Cn. Servilio coss. (
B.C.
169) mortem obiit Ennius.’

Jerome yr. Abr. 1849 =
B.C.
168, ‘Ennius poeta septuagenario
maior articulari morbo periit, sepultusque est in
Scipionis monumento via Appia intra primum ab urbe
miliarium. Quidam ossa eius Rudiam ex Ianiculo translata
affirmant.’

For his gout cf. Enn.
Sat.
1. 8,

‘Numquam poetor nisi si podager’;

Hor.
Ep.
i. 19, 7,

‘Ennius ipse pater numquam nisi potus ad arma

prosiluit dicenda.’

‘Ennius “equi fortis et victoris senectuti comparat
suam”’ (Cic.
Cato Maior
, 14).

The lines are
Ann.
xviii. fr. 7,

‘Sic ut fortis
equus
, spatio qui saepe supremo

vicit Olimpia, nunc senio confectus quiescit.’

His epitaph (
Epigr.
i) is quoted by Cic.
Tusc.
i. 34 and
117,

‘Aspicite, o cives, senis Enni imaginis formam!

hic vestrum panxit maxima facta patrum;

Nemo me dacrumis decoret nec funera fletu

faxit. Cur? Volito vivus per ora virum.’

According to Aelius Stilo, Ennius has depicted his own
character in
Ann.
vii. fr. 10, wherein he portrays Servilius
Geminus, the trusty companion of a man of position
(Gell. xii. 4). For Ennius’ self-appreciation cf. also his
epitaph (if by himself) quoted above, and
Ann.
i. fr. 4,

‘Latos per populos terrasque poemata nostra

clara cluebunt.’

In philosophy Ennius was an eclectic. Cf.
Trag.
1. 417,

‘Philosophari est mihi necesse, at paucis: nam omnino haut placet.

Degustandum ex ea, non in eam ingurgitandum censeo.’

His rationalism is seen in
Telamo
, fr. 1,

‘Ego deum genus esse semper dixi et dicam caelitum,

sed eos non curare opinor, quid agat humanum genus:

nam si curent, bene bonis sit, male malis, quod nunc abest’;

ibid.
, fr. 2,

‘Sed superstitiosi vates inpudentesque arioli,

aut inertes aut insani aut quibus egestas imperat,

qui sibi semitam non sapiunt, alteri monstrant viam,

quibus divitias pollicentur, ab eis drachumam ipsi petunt.’

Traces of Epicureanism are seen in
Ann.
i. fr. 13,

‘Terraque corpus

quae dedit ipsa capit neque dispendi facit hilum.’

Ennius also believed in the Pythagorean theory of
metempsychosis, and considered that his soul had animated
the body of a peacock.
Ann.
i. fr. 14,

‘Memini me fiere pavom.’

Persius 6, 10,

‘Cor iubet hoc Enni postquam destertuit esse

Maeonides Quintus pavone e Pythagoreo.’

Cf. also Lucr. i. 120-6.

(2) WORKS.

1.
Tragedies.
—Of those founded on mythology we have
fragments of twenty-two, eight at least of which were
borrowed from Euripides. The
Auct. ad Herenn.
ii. 34,
quotes nine lines which are a literal translation of the
beginning of the
Medea
. The date of the
Thyestes
,

B.C.
169, is the only one known (Cic.
Brut.
78, quoted

p. 28
). Besides these, Ennius probably wrote a praetexta
on ‘the Rape of the Sabines’; and his
Ambracia
is probably
a praetexta on the capture of the town by M. Fulvius
Nobilior in
B.C.
189 (L. MÃ¼ller includes it in the
Saturae
).

2.
Comedies.
—There are very slight fragments of the

Cupuncula
and the
Pancratiastes
.

3.
Saturae.
—A miscellaneous collection of poems.

Porphyr. ad Hor.
Sat.
i. 10, 47, ‘Ennius quattuor libros
saturarum reliquit.’

The reference in Hor.
Sat.
i. 10, 66,

‘Quam rudis et Graecis intacti carminis auctor,’

is not to Ennius, as some have supposed, but to the
inventor of
satura
, whoever he may have been.

The
Saturae
include (
a
)
Scipio
, probably a short epic.
It was mostly written in trochaic septenarii. (
b
)
Epicharmus

(in trochaic tetrameters), dealing with Pythagoreanism in
the department of physics. (
c
)
Euhemerus
or
Sacra Historia
,
modelled on Euhemerus’
á¼±ÎµÏá½° á¼Î½Î±Î³ÏÎ±Ïá½µ
,
[16]
the doctrines of
which were applied to the religion of Rome.

Cic.
N.D.
i. 119, ‘Euhemerus, quem noster et interpretatus
et secutus est praeter ceteros Ennius.’

(
d
)
Protreptica
or
Praecepta
, containing moral maxims.
(
e
)
Hedyphagetica
, ‘On Gastronomy,’ modelled on a hexameter
poem by Archestratus (about
B.C.
310). (
f
)
Sota
,
so called from
Î£ÏÏá½±Î´Î·Ï
, after whom the Sotadean metre
has been named. The book was probably of a lascivious
nature. (
g
) Epigrams; the chief of which are mentioned
above.

4. The
Annales
, an epic poem in hexameters, which
dealt with the history of Rome down to the beginning
of the Third Macedonian War. It contained eighteen
Books; there are about six hundred lines extant. The
following is a sketch of the contents:

Book i., from Aeneas to the death of Romulus; ii., reigns
of Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Martius;
iii., the last three kings; iv.-v., the republic down to the
war with Pyrrhus; vi., the war with Pyrrhus; vii., First
Punic War, etc.; viii.-ix., Second Punic War; x.-xii.,
Second Macedonian War, Cato’s consulship; xiii.-xv., War
with Antiochus, subjugation of the Aetolians; xvi.-xviii.,
from Istrian War to beginning of Third Macedonian War.

Ennius’ services
to Latin literature lay partly in
introducing the use of the hexameter and other metres from
Greek in place of the old Saturnian metre. His versification
is, of course, rough in comparison with that of
later writers, the principal points being

(1) Harsh elisions.
Ann.
l. 199,

‘Hos et ego in pugna vici victusque sum ab isdem.’

(2) Quadrisyllable endings; l. 23,

‘Est locus Hesperiam quam mortales perhibebant.’

(3) Absence of caesura, or abrupt break, l. 188,

‘Bellipotentes sunt magis quam sapientipotentes’;

l. 511,

‘Cui par imber et ignis, spiritus et gravis terra.’

(4) Omission of
-s
in scansion, as in the last two
examples.

(5) Short vowels sometimes lengthened; l. 86,

‘Omnibus cura viris uter esset induperator.’

(6) Prosaic lines (often spondaic); l. 34,

‘Olli respondit rex Albai longai’;

l. 174,

‘Cives Romani tunc facti sunt Campani.’

(7) Harsh instances of tmesis; l. 586,

‘Saxo cere comminuit brum’:

l. 605,

‘Massili portabant iuvenes ad litora tanas.’

(8) Apocope; l. 451

‘replet te laetificum
gau
’;

l. 561,

‘divom domus altisonum
cael
’;

l. 563,

‘endo suam
do
’ (= in suam domum).

(9) Alliteration used freely; l. 113,

‘O Tite tute Tati tibi tanta tiranne tulisti’;

l. 452,

‘At tuba terribili sonitu taratantara dixit.’

(10) Non-elision; l. 275,

‘Miscent inter sese inimicitiam agitantes.’

Influence of Ennius.
—This is seen in Lucretius, and to
a very great extent in Virgil. For Lucretius’ appreciation
of Ennius see Lucr. i. 117-9. Cf. also
Ann.
l. 150,

‘Postquam lumina sis oculis bonus Ancus reliquit,’

and Lucr. iii. 1025,

‘Lumina sis oculis etiam bonus Ancus reliquit.’

Servius on Verg.
Aen.
viii. 630-4, says ‘Sane totus hic
locus Ennianus est.’ Cf. Servius also on
Aen.
i. 20;
xi. 608, etc. A large number of imitations are quoted
by Macrobius, especially in
Saturn.
Book vi. Virgil
modified and refined many of Ennius’ rough expressions. Thus

Ann.
l. 452 (above quoted), becomes, in Verg.
Aen.
ix. 503,

‘At tuba terribilem sonitum procul aere sonoro

increpuit’;

Ann.
l. 464,

‘irarumque effunde quadrigas’

becomes in Verg.
Aen.
xii. 499,

‘irarumque omnes effundit habenas.’

Views on Ennius.
—A very few of these may be quoted.
Lucr. i. 117-9,

‘Ennius ut noster cecinit qui primus amoeno

detulit ex Helicone perenni fronde coronam,

per gentes Italas hominum quae clara
clueret.’

Cic.
Opt. Gen. Or.
2, ‘Licet dicere Ennium summum epicum
poetam, si cui ita videtur.’ Hor.
Ep.
ii. 1, 50,

‘Ennius et sapiens et fortis et alter Homerus,

ut critici dicunt, leviter curare videtur

quo promissa cadant et somnia Pythagorea.’

Propert. v. 1, 61,

‘Ennius hirsuta cingat sua dicta corona.’

Quint. x. 1, 88, ‘Ennium sicut sacros vetustate lucos
adoremus, in quibus grandia et antiqua robora iam non
tantam habent speciem quantam religionem.’

PACUVIUS.

(1) LIFE.

M. Pacuvius, the son (not grandson as Jerome states) of
Ennius’ sister, was born at Brundisium,
B.C.
220, spent
most of his life at Rome, and died at Tarentum shortly
before
B.C.
130. He was a painter as well as a poet.

Jerome yr. Abr. 1863 =
B.C.
154, ‘Pacuvius Brundusinus
tragoediarum scriptor clarus habetur, Ennii poetae ex filia
nepos, vixitque Romae quoad picturam exercuit ac fabulas
venditavit, deinde Tarentum transgressus prope nonagenarius
diem obiit.’

Pliny,
N.H.
xxxv. 19, ‘Celebrata est in foro boario, aede
Herculis, Pacuvii poetae pictura. Ennii sorore genitus hic
fuit, clarioremque eam artem Romae fecit gloria scaenae.’

Cic.
Brut.
229, ‘Accius isdem aedilibus ait se et Pacuvium
docuisse fabulam, cum ille octoginta, ipse triginta annos
natus esset.’

As Accius was born
B.C.
170, Cicero’s words imply that
Pacuvius was born
B.C.
220, and produced plays as late
as
B.C.
140, while from Jerome we may conclude that he
died shortly before
B.C.
130. That Pacuvius was taught by
his uncle Ennius is shown by Varro,
Sat. Menipp.
356
(BÃ¼cheler),

‘Pacvi
[17]
discipulus dicor, porro is fuit Enni,

Ennius Musarum: Pompilius clueor.’

He was a member of the literary circle of Laelius. Cf.
Laelius’ words in Cic.
Lael.
24, ‘In hospitis et amici mei
M. Pacuvi nova fabula.’ In his last years he was intimate
with Accius: cf. Gell. xiii. 2, ‘Cum Pacuvius, inquiunt,
grandi iam aetate et morbo corporis diutino adfectus,
Tarentum ex urbe Roma concessisset, Accius tunc, haut parvo
iunior, proficiscens in Asiam, cum in oppidum venisset,
devertit ad Pacuvium comiterque invitatus plusculisque ab
eo diebus retentus, tragoediam suam, cui Atreus nomen
est, desideranti legit.’

Gell. i. 24, 4, gives Pacuvius’ epitaph, as written by
himself, ‘Epigramma Pacuvii verecundissimum et purissimum,
dignumque eius elegantissima gravitate:

“Adulescens, tam etsi properas, te hoc saxum rogat,

ut sese aspicias, deinde quod scriptum est legas.

Hic sunt poetae Pacuvi Marci sita

ossa. Hoc volebam nescius ne esses. Vale.”’

(2) WORKS.

1.
Tragedies.
—Titles of twelve are known, and over
four hundred lines of fragments are extant. The
Antiopa
,
which is the best known, was from Euripides.

Cic.
de Fin.
i. 4, ‘Quis enim tam inimicus paene nomini
Romano est, qui Enni Medeam aut Antiopam Pacuvi
spernat aut reiciat quod se eisdem Euripidis fabulis delectari
dicat?’

The
Niptra
is from Sophocles. Cic.
T.D.
ii. 49,
speaking of ll. 256-8 (Ribbeck), says, ‘Pacuvius melius
quam Sophocles.’

Pacuvius also wrote one praetexta,
Paulus
, doubtless on
L. Aemilius Paulus, the victor of Pydna.

2.
Saturae
(lost).

Sueton. p. 20
R.
, ‘Carmen quod ex variis poematibus
constabat satura vocabatur, quale scripserunt Pacuvius et
Ennius.’

Pacuvius, like Ennius, shows interest in philosophy, and
attacks superstition; l. 93,

‘Mater est terra: ea parit corpus, animam aeter adiugat’;

ll. 366-75; cf. l. 372,

‘Sunt autem alii philosophi, qui contra fortunam negant

esse ullam, sed temeritate res regi omnis autumant’;

ll. 83-5,

‘Nam isti qui linguam avium intellegunt

plusque ex alieno iecore sapiunt quam ex suo,

magis audiendum quam auscultandum censeo.’

For Pacuvius’ stilted expressions, cf. Quint. i. 5, 67,
‘Ceterum etiam ex praepositione et duobus vocabulis dure
videtur struxisse Pacuvius

“Nerei repandirostrum, incurvicervicum pecus”’ (l. 408);

Paulus
, l. 5

‘Qua vix caprigeno generi gradilis gressio est.’

Some views on Pacuvius may be referred to:

Cic.
de Opt. Gen. Or.
1, ‘Itaque licet dicere et Ennium
summum epicum poetam et Pacuvium tragicum et Caecilium
fortasse comicum.’

Hor.
Ep.
ii. 1, 55,

‘Ambigitur quotiens uter utro sit prior, aufert

Pacuvius docti
[18]
famam senis, Accius alti’;

Mart. xi. 90, 5,

‘Attonitusque legis “terrai frugiferai,”

Accius et quidquid Pacuviusque vomunt.’

Cf. also Gell. vi. 14, 6; Cic.
Brut.
258;
Or.
36; Quint.
x. 1, 97; Persius, 1. 76-8; Tac.
Dial.
20.

CAECILIUS STATIUS.

(1) LIFE.

Jerome yr. Abr. 1838 =
B.C.
179, ‘Statius Caecilius
comoediarum scriptor clarus habetur, natione Insuber
Gallus et Ennii primum contubernalis. Quidam Mediolanensem
ferunt. Mortuus est anno post mortem Ennii
[iii.] et iuxta eum in Ianiculo sepultus.’

iii. is an addition by Ritschl, as we know Caecilius to
have been alive in
B.C.
166, when Terence’s
Andria
was
performed. Some read iv. The date of his death will
then be
B.C.
166 or 165. Caecilius probably came to Rome
among the Insubrian prisoners of war at some time between

B.C.
200 and 194. The year of his birth is unknown; he
is never mentioned, like other old writers, such as Plautus
and Ennius, as having lived to a great age. If he died

B.C.
166, we might suppose that he was born about
B.C.

219, as that would make him of military age when the
Insubrian war began in
B.C.
200. His name as a slave
was Statius. His patron is unknown.

Gell. iv. 20, 13, ‘Statius servile nomen fuit ... Caecilius
quoque ille comoediarum poeta inclutus servus fuit; et
propterea nomen habuit “Statius.” Sed postea versum
est quasi in cognomentum: appellatusque est Caecilius
Statius.’

Elsewhere he is sometimes called merely Caecilius (as
Cic.
de Or.
ii. 40), but never Statius alone.

(2) WORKS.

Caecilius’ works were at first unsuccessful; cf. the actor
Ambivius’ words in Ter.
Hec.
prol. ii. 6-7,

‘In eis quas primum Caecili didici novas,

partim sum earum exactus, partim vix steti.’

Later he examined plays before they were acted, as,
e.g.

Terence’s
Andria
in
B.C.
166 (see under ‘Terence,’
p. 42
).
This implies that he occupied a responsible and leading
position in the guild of poets.

We have two hundred and ninety lines of fragments, and
titles of forty-two comedies, sixteen of which correspond
with those of plays by Menander. For Caecilius’
imitation of Menander see Gell. ii. 23. Cf.,
e.g.
,
‘Caecilii Plocium legebamus; hautquaquam mihi et
qui aderant displicebat... Sed enim postquam in manus
Menander venit, a principio statim, di boni, quantum
stupere atque frigere quantumque mutare a Menandro
Caecilius visus est!’

Among the views on Caecilius are:

Cic.
ad Att.
vii. 3, 10, ‘(Caecilius) malus auctor
Latinitatis est’ (probably because he was an Insubrian).

Cic.
de Opt. Gen. Or.
1, ‘fortasse summus comicus.’
Sedigitus ap. Gell. xv. 24,

‘Caecilio palmam Statio do mimico.’

Hor.
Ep.
ii. 1, 59,

‘(dicitur) vincere Caecilius gravitate.’

The contemporaries of Caecilius include
Trabea
,
Atilius

(‘poeta durissimus,’ Cic.
ad Att.
xiv. 20, 3),
Aquilius

(possibly the author of the
Boeotia
, attributed by Varro to
Plautus, Gell. iii. 3, 4),
Licinius Imbrex
,
Luscius Lanuvinus
,
all writers of
palliatae
. Our chief information about
Luscius Lanuvinus is got from the prologues to Terence’s
plays (in all of which, except that of the
Hecyra
, he is
attacked), and from Donatus’ commentary on these passages.
From Ter.
Eun.
prol. 9-13, we see that he did
not tone down his originals to suit a Roman audience,

‘Idem Menandri Phasma nuper perdidit

atque in Thensauro scripsit, causam dicere

prius unde petitur, aurum qua re sit suom,

quam illic qui petit, unde is sit thensaurus sibi

aut unde in patrium monumentum pervenerit.’

Donatus
ad loc.
, ‘Arguit Terentius quod Luscius contra
consuetudinem litigantium defensionem ante accusationem
induxerit.’

TERENCE.

(1) LIFE.

Our chief source of information is Suetonius’ life of
Terence, preserved by Donatus, who also makes a slight
addition of his own. Jerome’s notice is also based on
Suetonius.

P. Terentius Afer was born in Africa, and was brought in
early life to Rome, where he was a slave of P. Terentius
Lucanus, by whom he was educated and subsequently
manumitted.

Sueton.
vit. Ter.
p. 26
R.
, ‘P. Terentius Afer, Karthagine
natus, serviit Romae Terentio Lucano senatori, a quo ob
ingenium et formam non institutus modo liberaliter, sed
et mature manu missus est. Quidam captum esse existumant:
quod fieri nullo modo potuisse Fenestella docet,
cum inter finem secundi Punici belli et initium tertii et
natus sit et mortuus.’

Terence’s cognomen probably shows that he belonged to
one of the African peoples subdued by Carthage. It may
be taken as certain that he was not of Punic birth, and that
he was brought to Rome in the ordinary course of the
slave trade.

The date of Terence’s birth is not accurately known.
Sueton.
ibid.
p. 32, ‘Nondum quintum atque vicesimum
ingressus annum ... egressus urbe est neque amplius rediit,’
which refers to his voyage to Greece in
B.C.
160, would
make the year of his birth to be
B.C.
185. This, however,
is an improbable assumption, which rests on the fact that
Roman scholars attributed to him the age of his intimate
friend, P. Scipio Africanus the younger. Thus Sueton.

ibid.
p. 27 (of Terence, Scipio, Laelius), says, ‘quamvis et
Nepos aequales omnes fuisse tradat’; with which contrast

ibid.
‘Fenestella ... contendens utroque maiorem natu
fuisse.’ Terence must have been some years older, as
his first piece, the
Andria
, was produced
B.C.
166. A
successful piece like it makes it probable that he had
then passed his boyhood, and it is likely that he was
born about
B.C.
190. The reproach of his adversary in

Heaut. Tim.
prol. 23,

‘
repente
ad studium hunc se adplicasse
musicum
,’

means only that he had not made himself prominent by
previous exercises in play-writing. Further in
H.T.
prol.
51-2, he describes his opponents as
adulescentuli
,

‘Exemplum statuite in me, ut adulescentuli

vobis placere studeant potius quam sibi.’

Terence was on intimate terms with P. Scipio Africanus
and C. Laelius, who were supposed to have helped him
in the composition of his plays.

Sueton.
ibid.
p. 30, ‘Non obscura fama est adiutum
Terentium in scriptis a Laelio et Scipione: eamque ipse
auxit, numquam nisi leviter se tutari conatus, ut in prologo
Adelphorum (ll. 15-21),

“Nam quod isti dicunt malivoli, homines nobiles

hunc adiutare adsidueque una scribere,

quod illi maledictum vehemens esse existumant:

eam laudem hic ducit maxumam, quom illis placet

qui vobis univorsis et populo placent,

quorum opera in bello, in otio, in negotio

suo quisque tempore usust sine superbia.”

... Sciebat Laelio et Scipioni non ingratam esse hanc
opinionem, quae tum magis et usque ad posteriora tempora valuit.’

Sueton. p. 31, also repeats a story that C. Laelius was
the author of the lines
H.T.
723
sqq.

Cf. also Cic.
ad Att.
vii. 3, 10, ‘Terentium, cuius fabellae
propter elegantiam sermonis putabantur a C. Laelio scribi.’

Quint. x. 1, 99, ‘Licet Terentii scripta ad Scipionem
Africanum referantur.’

The remark that ll. 20-1 of the above extract from the

Adelph.
could not refer to young men like Scipio and
Laelius was made even in antiquity.

Sueton.
ibid.
p. 31, ‘Santra (a grammarian of the time
of Augustus) Terentium existimat, si modo in scribendo
adiutoribus indiguerit, non tam Scipione et Laelio uti
potuisse, qui tunc adulescentuli fuerint, quam C. Sulpicio
Gallo, homine docto, quo console Megalensibus ludis
initium fabularum dandarum fecerit, vel Q. Fabio Labeone
et M. Popillio, consulari utroque ac poeta. Ideo ipsum
non iuvenes designare qui se adiuvare dicantur, sed viros
quorum operam et in bello et in otio et in negotio populus
sit expertus.’

In K. Dziatzko’s opinion (second edition of
Phormio
,
p. 10, Leipzig, 1885), the expression ‘homines nobiles’
points to the literary circle of Terence, including old as
well as young men, while in what follows he touches upon
the general reputation of those noble families among the
Roman people. There is nothing to show that Terence
got more than general support and advice from his friends.
That his diction reflects the conversational language of
the better classes is recognized.

In
B.C.
166, Terence submitted to Caecilius Statius, the
examiner of plays, his first work, the
Andria
, which was
accepted, and performed in that year.

Sueton.
ibid.
pp. 28-9, ‘Scripsit comoedias sex. Ex
quibus primam Andriam cum aedilibus daret, iussus ante
Caecilio recitare ad cenantem cum venisset, dicitur initium
quidem fabulae, quod erat contemptiore vestitu, in subsellio
iuxta lectulum residens legisse, post paucos vero
versus invitatus ut accumberet cenasse una, dein cetera
percucurrisse non sine magna Caecilii admiratione.’

From the fact of Caecilius’ not recognizing him we may
conclude that Terence had as yet no connexion with the
guild of poets. This fits in with
H.T.
prol. 23-4,

‘Repente ad studium hunc se adplicasse musicum,

amicum ingenio fretum, haud natura sua.’

Hence probably arose the hatred of other writers, referred
to as
isti
(
Andr.
15; 21);
iniqui
(
H.T.
27); cf. also
Hec.

prol. ii. 38,

‘Nolite sinere per vos artem musicam

recidere ad paucos.’

As to further connexion between Caecilius and Terence,
note (1) that they had a common actor Ambivius; (2) that
Terence sometimes imitates Caecilius. Thus, according to
Donatus,
Andr.
805,

‘ut quimus, aiunt, quando ut volumus non licet’

is from Caecilius (l. 177 R.),

‘vivas ut possis quando nec quis ut velis.’

Cf. also
Adelph.
985,

‘Quod prolubium? quae istaec subitast largitas?’

and Caecilius (l. 91 R.),

‘Quod prolubium, quae voluptas, quae te lactat largitas?’

Terence died
B.C.
159, on his way home from Greece,
where he had probably gone the year before. The place
of his death is uncertain. Whatever plays he may have
written while in Greece are lost.

Sueton.
ibid.
p. 32, ‘Post editas comoedias, nondum
quintum atque vicesimum ingressus annum, causa vitandae
opinionis qua videbatur aliena pro suis edere, seu percipiendi
Graecorum instituta moresque quos non perinde
exprimeret in scriptis, egressus urbe est neque amplius
rediit.... Q. Cosconius redeuntem e Graecia perisse in
mari dicit cum fabulis conversis a Menandro: ceteri mortuum
esse in Arcadia sive Leucadiae tradunt, Cn. Cornelio
Dolabella M. Fulvio Nobiliore coss., morbo implicatum
ex dolore ac taedio amissarum sarcinarum quas in nave
praemiserat, ac simul fabularum quas novas fecerat.’

Terence’s personal appearance is mentioned by Sueton.
p. 33, who also states that he had property, and left
a daughter who afterwards married a Roman knight.
‘Fuisse dicitur mediocri statura, gracili corpore, colore
fusco. Reliquit filiam, quae post equiti Romano nupsit:
item hortulos xx. iugerum via Appia ad Martis.’

(2) WORKS.

1.
Andria
.—The particulars of its production are given
above. Of its success, Donatus in his commentary says,
‘Successu adspecta prospero hortamento poetae fuit ad
alias conscribendas.’ The didascalia to the
Andria
is
lost, but we can restore it as follows from Donatus’ information,
‘Incipit Andria Terenti. Acta ludis Megalensib.
M. Fulvio M’ Glabrione aedil. curul. Egit L. Ambivius
Turpio.
[19]
Modos fecit Flaccus Claudi. Tibis paribus tota.
Graeca Menandru. Facta i. M. Marcello C. Sulpicio cos.’

The meaning of the didascalia is as follows: The piece
was produced at the Megalesian games (held at the beginning
of April) under the curule aediles mentioned;
L. Ambivius Turpio undertook the representation; the
music was composed (as in all Terence’s comedies) by
Flaccus, slave of Claudius, and given throughout
tibiis
paribus
.
[20]
The Greek original was by Menander; it was
the first work of Terence, and the year of production
was
B.C.
166.

The play is adapted from Menander’s
á¼Î½Î´Ïá½·Î±
with
additions from his
Î ÎµÏÎ¹Î½Î¸á½·Î±
.
Andr.
prol. 13,

‘Quae convenere in Andriam ex Perinthia

fatetur transtulisse atque usum pro suis.’

The prologue dates from the first performance, though
Wagner and Ribbeck have inferred from l. 5,

‘Nam in prologis scribundis operam abutitur,’

that it was written for a second representation, possibly
in
B.C.
164. There are two endings to the play; the
shorter one is genuine, the longer spurious, and omitted
in the best
MSS.

2.
Heauton Timorumenos
is from Menander’s
á¼©Î±Ï
Ïá½¸Î½ ÏÎ¹Î¼ÏÏÎ¿á½»Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï
,
‘self tormentor.’ The title is referred to in
l. 146,

‘hic me exerceo,’

l. 81,

‘An quoiquamst usus homini, se ut cruciet?’

and prol. 5,

‘Ex integra Graeca integram comoediam

hodie sum acturus Heauton timorumenon.’

The play was produced at the Ludi Megalenses in
B.C.

163, as is seen from the didascalia, ‘Incipit Heauton
Timorumenos Terenti. Acta ludis Megalensib. L. Cornelio
Lentulo L. Valerio Flacco aedilib. curulib. Egit Ambivius
Turpio. Modos fecit Flaccus Claudi. Acta primum
tibis inparib., deinde duabus dextris. Graeca Menandru.
Facta ii. M’ Iuventio Ti. Sempronio cos.’

The play is called ‘stataria’ in prol. 36,

‘Date potestatem mihi

statariam agere ut liceat per silentium.’

3.
Eunuchus
, ‘contaminated’ from Menander’s
Îá½Î½Î¿á¿¦ÏÎ¿Ï

and his
Îá½¹Î»Î±Î¾
.
Eun.
prol. 19,

‘Nunc acturi sumus

Menandri Eunuchum’;

ibid.
30,

‘Colax Menandrist: in east parasitus colax

et miles gloriosus: eas se non negat

personas transtulisse in Eunuchum suam

ex Graeca: sed eas ab aliis factas prius

Latinas scisse sese, id vero pernegat.’

The didascalia shows that the piece was produced at the
Ludi Megalenses in
B.C.
161, and from the
MSS.
we may
conclude that it was also acted in
B.C.
146. The didascalia
is, ‘Incipit Eunuchus Terenti. Acta ludis Megalensib.
L. Postumio Albino L. Cornelio Merula aedilib. curulib.
Egit Ambivius Turpio. Modos fecit Flaccus Claudi. Tibis

Sueton.
vit. Ter.
p. 29, speaks of the success of the
play, ‘Eunuchus quidem his deinceps acta est meruitque
pretium quantum nulla antea cuiusquam comoedia, octo
milia nummum.’

4.
Phormio
, the fifth comedy Terence composed, and
the fourth completely represented. It was first performed
at the Ludi Romani,
B.C.
161. The Greek original was
the
á¼ÏÎ¹Î´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¶á½¹Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï
of Apollodorus of Carystus.
Phorm.

prol. 24,

‘Adporto novam

Epidicazomenon quam vocant comoediam

Graeci, Latini Phormionem nominant,

quia primas partis qui aget, is erit Phormio

parasitus, per quem res geretur maxume,’

The didascalia is, ‘Incipit Terenti Phormio. Acta ludis
Romanis. L. Postumio Albino L. Cornelio Merula aedilib.
curulib. Egit L. Ambivius Turpio. Modos fecit Flaccus
Claudi. Tibis imparib. tota. Graeca Apollodoru Epidicazomenos.
Facta iiii. C. Fannio M. Valerio cos.

From notices in the
MSS.
it is probable that a second
representation took place in
B.C.
141 at the Megalesian
games.

5.
Hecyra
is founded on a play by Apollodorus of
Carystus, doubtless called
á¼©ÎºÏ
Ïá½±
; cf. Donatus’ preface,
‘fabula Apollodori dicitur esse Graeca.’ The first attempted
representation was in
B.C.
165, at the Ludi Megalenses.

Hec.
prol. i. 1,

‘Hecyra quom datast

nova, ei novom intervenit vitium et calamitas,

ut neque spectari neque cognosci potuerit:

ita populus studio stupidus in funambulo

animum occuparat.’

The second (unsuccessful) representation was at the ludi
funerales of Aemilius Paulus in
B.C.
160.
Hec.
prol. ii. 38,

‘Refero denuo.

Primo actu placeo. Quom interea rumor venit

datum iri gladiatores, populus convolat,

tumultuantur clamant pugnant de loco:

ego interea meum non potui tutari locum.’

Cf.
Phorm.
prol. 31,

‘Ne simili utamur fortuna, atque usi sumus

quom per tumultum noster grex motus locost.’

The first prologue was written for the second performance;
the second (spoken by the actor Ambivius) for the third
performance, also in
B.C.
160. The didascalia is, ‘Incipit
Terenti Hecyra. Acta ludis Megalensib. S. Iulio Caesare
Cn. Cornelio Dolabella aedilib. curulib. Egit L. Ambivius
Turpio. Modos fecit Flaccus Claudi. Tibis paribus tota.

. Facta v. Cn. Octavio T. Manlio cos.
Relata est L. Aemelio Paulo ludis funeralib. Non est
placita. Tertio relata est Q. Fulvio L. Marcio aedilib.
curulib.’

6.
Adelphoe
is founded on Menander’s
á¼Î´ÎµÎ»ÏÎ¿á½·
with a
scene added from Diphilus’
Î£Ï
Î½Î±ÏÎ¿Î¸Î½á¿ÏÎºÎ¿Î½ÏÎµÏ
.
Adelph.

prol. 6,

Synapothnescontes Diphili comoediast;

eam Commorientis Plautus fecit fabulam.

In Graeca adulescens est, qui lenoni eripit

meretricem in prima fabula: eum Plautus locum

reliquit integrum; eum hic locum sumpsit sibi

in Adelphos, verbum de verbo expressum extulit.’

That this was the first performance is shown by
novam
in
l. 12. The part from Diphilus is Act ii., Scene 1. The
play was produced in
B.C.
160 at the ludi funerales of L.
Aemilius Paulus, as shown by the didascalia, ‘Incipit
Terenti Adelphoe. Acta ludis funeralib. L. Aemelio
Paulo. Fecere Q. Fabius Maxumus P. Cornelius Africanus.
Egit L. Ambivius Turpio. Modos fecit Flaccus Claudi.
Tibis Sarranis tota. Graeca Menandru. Facta vi. M.
Cornelio Cethego L. Anicio Gallo cos.’

The order given above agrees essentially with the numbers
denoting the order of production, as given in the
didascaliae. We must, however, assume that the first
representation of the
Hecyra
remained unnoticed, and must
give the second place (instead of the third) to the
H.T.
,
with a section of the
MSS.
, and the third place to the

Eun.
with Donatus against the
MSS.

Prologues.
—Terence uses these as weapons against his
enemies, the chief of whom was Luscius Lanuvinus (
see
under his name
), who attacked Terence for ‘contaminatio’
and for want of spirit in his plays. Cf.
H.T.
prol. 17,

‘Multas contaminasse Graecas, dum facit

paucas Latinas’;

Phorm.
prol. 5,

‘tenui esse oratione et scriptura levi.’

Terence justifies repeatedly his use of ‘contaminatio.’

H.T.
prol. 16,

‘Nam quod rumores distulerunt malivoli,

multas contaminasse Graecas, dum facit

paucas Latinas: id esse factum hic non negat,

neque se pigere et deinde facturum autumat.

Habet bonorum exemplum, quo exemplo sibi

licere id facere quod illi fecerunt putat.’

Cf.
Andria
, prol. 15-21;
Adelph.
prol. 1-14;
Eun.
prol.
31-3. Luscius also attacked him for not adhering more
closely to his Greek originals, in spite of the fact that,
generally speaking, Terence translated closely from these.
Cf.
Adelph.
prol. 10-11, quoted above. A piece was
considered to be new if it had not previously been presented
to a Roman audience. So Terence justifies his
originality in
Adelph.
prol. 6-14, or excuses himself on
the ground that he did not know that a piece had been
previously used:
Eun.
prol. 19-34.

Representation of the plays.
—Ambivius was the chief
actor in all the plays. He is the speaker of the prologue
of
H.T.
and of the second prologue of
Hec.
He calls
himself
senex
, cf.
H.T.
prol. 1. For his popularity cf.

Hec.
prol. ii. 55,

‘Mea causa causam accipite et date silentium.’

The music was provided by Flaccus, slave of Claudius.
The composer himself was probably the instrumentalist.
Four kinds of flutes are mentioned as used by him:

tibiae pares
,
impares
,
sarranae
, and
duae dextrae
(see
note
p. 45
). The scene of all the plays is at Athens. There
is no chorus. The form of the plays is modelled closely
on Greek. More than half of the verses are iambic
senarii, the next commonest being troch. septen. and
iamb. octon. These are used in dialogue. Trochaic
octonarii are used in lyrical parts, other lyrical metres
being rare, and the anapaestic metre not being used.
Short lines are also found in the middle of lyrical pieces,
or at the end of pieces of dialogue.
Andr.
605,

‘Sed eccum video ipsum: occidi.’

Single words sometimes stand at the head of a lyrical
piece, as
Phorm.
485 ‘Dorio,’ which makes a line.

The different kinds of scenes are under the same conditions
as in Plautus. We have (1) scenes provided
with music, probably represented in
MSS.
by C (Canticum).
(2) Scenes sung as recitative, with musical accompaniment,
in
MSS.
denoted by M.M.C. (perhaps for
‘Modi Mutati Cantici’). (3) Scenes in senarii, without
music, in
MSS.
denoted by DV (Diverbium). The division
into scenes is very ancient; but the division into
acts, though existing in the time of Terence (cf.
Hec.

prol. 39, ‘primo actu placeo,’), is not marked in the

MSS.

Names of characters.
—Terence uses only Greek names,
which often suit the characters of the persons, and many
of which are repeated in the different plays. Cf. Pamphilus
and Glycerium, of the lovers in the
Andr.
; Chremes
(
ÏÏá½³Î¼ÏÏÎ¿Î¼Î±Î¹
, ‘cough’), for an old man, in
Andr.
,

H.T.
,

Phorm.
; Crito (
ÎºÏÎ½á½·Ï
, ‘judge’), for an old man,
in
Andr.
,

Phorm.
; Sosia (
Ïá¿´Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½
), for a freedman, in

Andr.
,
Hec.

So names of slaves as Davus (
Îá¾¶Î¿Ï
, ‘Dacian’), Dromo,
Geta, Syrus, all in several plays.

The arguments
, consisting of twelve senarii each, were
composed by C. Sulpicius Apollinaris in the second
century
A.D.

Prosody.
—For the variations from later usage,
see under
‘Plautus.’
Terence is, of course, more regular in this
respect than Plautus.

Views on Terence.
—To those given above the following
may be added:

Gell. vi. 14, 6, ‘Exempla in Latina lingua M. Varro
esse dicit ubertatis Pacuvium, gracilitatis Lucilium, mediocritatis
Terentium.’
[21]

Sueton.
vit. Ter.
p. 34, ‘Cicero in Limone hactenus
laudat,

“Tu quoque, qui solus lecto sermone, Terenti,

conversum expressumque Latina voce Menandrum

in medium nobis sedatis motibus effers,

quiddam come loquens atque omnia dulcia miscens”;

item C. Caesar,

“Tu quoque, tu in summis, o dimidiate Menander,

poneris, et merito, puri sermonis amator.

Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adiuncta foret vis,

comica ut aequato virtus polleret honore

cum Graecis, neve hac despectus parte iaceres.

Unum hoc maceror ac doleo tibi desse, Terenti.”’

EARLY MINOR AUTHORS.

(
a
) POETS:

The poetical contemporaries of Terence were:

1.
Titinius
, the first writer of
togatae
; fifteen titles and
about one hundred and eighty lines of fragments are
extant. He probably began to write after Terence’s death.

2.
Sextus Turpilius.
—We have titles of thirteen of his

palliatae
, six of which are probably from Menander. He
died
B.C.
103, probably about eighty.

Jerome yr. Abr. 1914 =
B.C.
103, ‘Turpilius comicus senex
admodum Sinuessae moritur.’

3.
Iuventius
,
Valerius
, and
Vatronius
wrote
palliatae
;

P. Licinius Tegula
a hymn to Juno,
B.C.
200 (Livy xxxi.
12);
Q. Fabius Labeo
(cos.
B.C.
183) and
M. Popillius
Laenas
(cos. 173) were poets.

(
b
) PROSE WRITERS:

Fabius Pictor
was the earliest Roman historian: Liv.
i. 44, 2, ‘scriptorum antiquissimus Fabius Pictor.’ A
relative of Q. Fabius Maximus Cunctator (Plut.
Fab. Max.

18), he took part in the war with the Cisalpine Gauls,

B.C.
225 (Eutropius, iii. 5), and after the battle of Cannae
was sent by the Senate on a mission to the oracle of
Delphi (Liv. xxii. 57, 5).

Fabius wrote in Greek an account of the Second Punic
War, prefixed to which was a sketch of the history of Rome
from its foundation: Liv. xxii. 7, 4, ‘Fabium aequalem
temporibus huiusce belli potissimum auctorem habui.’
There was also a Latin version, made either by Fabius
Pictor or by a namesake (Gell. v. 4, 3).

The same subject was treated by
L. Cincius Alimentus
,
who was praetor
B.C.
210 (Liv. xxvi. 23, i), and took an
active part in the war in Sicily during the next two years
(Liv. xxvii. 7, 12, and throughout that Book). He was
taken prisoner by Hannibal, and conversed with him:
Liv. xxi. 38, 3, ‘L. Cincius Alimentus, qui captum se ab
Hannibale scribit, maxime auctor moveret ...’

Both Fabius and Cincius wrote in Greek, and both
gave a cursory view of the earlier history: Dion. Hal. i. 6,

CATO.

M. Porcius Cato, the Censor (
B.C.
234-149), born at
Tusculum, of a yeoman stock, was one of the most prominent
figures of his time. For the best account of his
military and political career, including his advancement to
the Consulship (
B.C.
195) and Censorship (
B.C.
184), and
his economic and social reforms, the reader may be referred
to Mommsen,
R.H.
, vol. ii.
passim
.

Cato was the founder of Latin prose, and the chief
opponent of the exaggerated Hellenism that was finding
its way into Roman life and literature (cf. his own words
quoted by Pliny,
N.H.
xxix. 14, ‘Quandoque ista gens
suas litteras dabit, omnia corrumpet’); but even he shows
traces of Greek influence. Cato is represented now only
by (1) his treatise
De Agri Cultura
, the earliest extant
work in Latin prose, which, besides giving instruction for
the husbandman, deals with housekeeping, cookery, and
medicine.

(2) His great work was the
Origines
, the earliest history
in Latin prose, the contents of which are enumerated by
Nepos,
Cato
, 3, 3, ‘Senex historias scribere instituit. Earum
sunt libri vii. Primus continet res gestas regum populi
Romani, secundus et tertius unde quaeque civitas orta sit
Italica (ob quam rem omnes Origines videtur appellasse);
in quarto autem bellum Poenicum est primum, in quinto
secundum. Atque haec omnia capitulatim sunt dicta.
Reliqua quoque bella pari modo persecutus est usque ad
praeturam Ser. Galbae, qui diripuit Lusitanos (
B.C.
151).
Atque horum bellorum duces non nominavit, sed sine
nominibus res notavit.
[22]
In eisdem exposuit quae in Italia
Hispaniisque aut fierent aut viderentur admiranda: in
quibus multa industria et diligentia comparet, nulla doctrina.’

An attempt has been made by A. Bormann (
M. Porcii
Catonis Originum Libri vii.
, Brandenburg 1858, p. 38) to
prove that the principle of division was geographical, and
that history only came in incidentally in connexion with
the reduction of provinces; but as Nepos was writing to
an eminent authority on antiquities, his account is likely
to be right. The period between the kings and the Punic
Wars was probably omitted by Cato through want of
authorities.

The title
Origines
fails to indicate the scope of the work,
which was chiefly occupied with general history; it was
probably taken, as Nepos suggests, from the contents of
Books ii. and iii., which seem to have been the most
novel and valuable part of the undertaking. (Jordan, however,
takes ‘Origines’ as equivalent, not to the Greek
ÎºÏá½·ÏÎµÎ¹Ï
,
but to ‘res Romanae ab origine repetitae.’)

(3)
Praecepta ad Filium
was the general title of a didactic
work containing rules for medicine, husbandry, and rhetoric
(
e.g.
‘Rem tene, verba sequentur’). Cf. Quint. iii. 1, 19,
‘Romanorum primus, quantum ego quidem sciam, condidit
aliqua in hanc materiam (rhetoric) M. Cato ille Censorius.’

(4)
Speeches.
—Fragments of eighty speeches, out of about
two hundred and thirty, are collected by Jordan. They are
almost equally divided between forensic and deliberative
speeches: none is known of earlier date than
B.C.
195.
Cato incorporated some of them in the
Origines
,
e.g.
For
the Rhodians (Gell. vi. 3, 7), and Against Galba (Cic.

Brut.
89).

Works on civil law are attributed to Cato, and we hear
also of
á¼ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¸á½³Î³Î¼Î±ÏÎ±
(Cic.
de Off.
i. 104),
Liber de re militari

(Gell. vi. 4, 5), and
Carmen de moribus
(Gell. xi. 2, 2).

ACCIUS.

(1) LIFE.

The forms Accius and Attius are both found on inscriptions,

e.g.
from Pisaurum; but in the
MSS.
of Nonius
Marcellus, who often quotes Accius, and who is careful
about his forms, ‘Accius’ is always found, and generally
in
MSS.
of other authors.

L. Accius was born
B.C.
170 at Pisaurum (of. Pliny,
N.H.

vii. 128, ‘Attio Pisaurense’).

Jerome yr. Abr. 1878 =
B.C.
139, ‘L. Accius tragoediarum
scriptor clarus habetur, natus Mancino et Serrano
coss. (
B.C.
170) parentibus libertinis et seni iam Pacuvio
Tarenti sua scripta recitavit. A quo et fundus Accianus
iuxta Pisaurum dicitur, quia illuc inter colonos fuerat ex
urbe deductus.’

This last statement must refer to Accius’ father, as the
colony of Pisaurum was founded
B.C.
184. Jerome’s
chronology is corroborated by

Cic.
Brut.
229, ‘Accius isdem aedilibus (
B.C.
140) ait
se et Pacuvium docuisse fabulam, cum ille lxxx., ipse xxx.
annos natus esset.’

Accius’ friendship and influence with leading men is
shown by Cic.
pro Arch.
27, ‘D. Brutus, summus vir et
imperator (cons.
B.C.
138) Acci amicissimi sui carminibus
templorum ac monumentorum aditus exornavit suorum.’

Auct. ad Herenn.
i. 24, ‘Mimus quidam nominatim
Accium poetam compellavit in scaena. Cum eo Accius
iniuriarum egit’; ii. 19, ‘P. Mucius eum qui L. Accium
poetam nominaverat condemnavit.’

The above shows his self-consciousness; cf. also Pliny

N.H.
xxxiv. 19, ‘Notatum ab auctoribus et L. Accium
poetam in Camenarum aede maxima forma statuam sibi
posuisse, cum brevis admodum fuisset.’

For Accius’ friendship with Pacuvius, see
p. 35
. Accius
must have lived to about
B.C.
86, as Cicero (born
B.C.
106)
talked with him on literary subjects.

Cic.
Brut.
107, ‘D. Brutus M. filius, ut ex familiari eius
L. Accio poeta sum audire solitus.’

His
Tereus
was produced in
B.C.
104, as is seen from

Cic.
Phil.
i. 36 (
B.C.
44), ‘Nisi forte Accio tum plaudi
et sexagesimo post anno palmam dari, non Bruto, putabatis.’

(2) WORKS.

1.
Tragedies.
—Titles of about forty-five plays, and about
seven hundred lines of fragments are extant. The fragments
show imitation of Aeschylus as well as of Sophocles and
Euripides.

2.
Praetextae.
—
Aeneadae
or
Decius
, and
Brutus
.
Decius

treated of the self-sacrifice of P. Decius Mus at Sentinum,

B.C.
295. Cf. l. 15, ‘Patrio exemplo et me dicabo atque
animam devoro (= devovero) hostibus.’
Brutus
treated
of the overthrow of Tarquinius Superbus and the establishment
of the consulship.

3.
Didascalica
, in at least nine books, a history of Greek
and Latin poetry, with special attention to the drama. The
few fragments are mostly in Sotadean metre. Cf. Gell. vi.
9, 16, ‘L. Accius in Sotadicorum libro I.’

4.
Pragmaticon libri
(in trochaic tetrameters) on literary
subjects.

5.
Praxidica
, on agriculture. Two lines on ploughing
are quoted from ‘liber parergon,’ i., but it is not certain
whether this is an independent work.

6.
Annales
, in hexameters.

7. A work in Saturnians.

Accius gave attention to points of language. Cf. Quint.
i. 7, 14, ‘Semivocales geminare diu non fuit usitatissimi
moris, atque e contrario usque ad Accium et ultra porrectas
syllabas geminis, ut dixi, vocalibus scripserunt.’

Accius, like Ennius and Pacuvius, attacks superstition.
Cf. ll. 169-70,

‘Nil credo auguribus, qui auris verbis divitant

alienas, suas ut auro locupletent domos.’

That Virgil imitated Accius is mentioned by Macrob.
vi. 1, 58, who compares,
e.g.
, l. 156,

‘Virtuti sis par, dispar fortunis patris,’

and
Aen.
xii. 435-6,

‘Disce, puer, virtutem ex me verumque laborem,

fortunam ex aliis.’

Views on Accius.
—A few of these may be referred to.
Cic.
pro Sest.
120, ‘Summi poetae ingenium.’
Ovid.
Am.
i. 15, 19,

‘Animosi Accius oris.’

Cf. also Quint. x. 1, 97; Tac.
Dial.
20; and Hor.
Ep.
ii.
1, 55 (see ‘Pacuvius,’
p. 37
).

Of the prose writers contemporary with Accius, the most
important were the annalists
L. Cassius Hemina
and
L.
Calpurnius Piso Frugi
; the orators
Ti.
and
C. Graccus
,
and their opponent
C. Fannius
, and
M. Aemilius Scaurus
,
the
princeps senatus
, who also wrote an autobiography (Cic.

Brut.
112).
L. Coelius Antipater
wrote a history of the
Second Punic War in seven Books, making use of Silenus,
whose account was favourable to the Carthaginians (Cic.

de Div.
i. 49). His strength lay in style (Cic.
de Or.
ii. 53);
though painstaking, he was apt to exaggerate (Liv. xxvii.
27, 12; xxix, 25, 3).

LUCILIUS.

(1) LIFE.

C. Lucilius’ dates are given by Jerome as
B.C.
148-103.

yr. Abr. 1869 =
B.C.
148, ‘Lucilius poeta nascitur.’

yr. Abr. 1914 =
B.C.
103, ‘C. Lucilius satirarum scriptor
Neapoli moritur, ac publico funere effertur anno aetatis xlvi.’

If Jerome’s notice were correct, Lucilius would have been
only thirteen years old at the time of the Numantine War
(
B.C.
134) in which he served.

Velleius ii. 9, 4, ‘Celebre et Lucili nomen fuit qui sub
P. Africano Numantino bello eques militaverat.’

It is probable that Jerome has confused the consuls of

B.C.
180, A. Postumius Albinus and C. Calpurnius Piso,
with those of
B.C.
148, Sp. Postumius Albinus and L.
Calpurnius Piso, and that Lucilius was born
B.C.
180. No
reference is found in Lucilius to any event after
B.C.
103,
so that Jerome may be right in giving that as the year of
his death. In Hor.
Sat.
ii. 1, 34, Lucilius is called
senex
,
which shows that he lived a long life.

Lucilius was born at Suessa in Campania. He was an

eques
, and was the great-uncle of Pompey. Juv. 1, 19,

‘Cur tamen hoc potius libeat decurrere campo,

per quem magnus equos Auruncae flexit alumnus,

si vacat ac placidi rationem admittitis, edam.’

Porphyr. ad Hor.
Sat.
ii. 1, 75, ‘“infra Lucili censum”:
Constat enim Lucilium avonculum maiorem Pompei fuisse:
etenim avia Pompei Lucilii soror fuerat.’

Velleius ii. 29, 2, ‘Fuit [Cn. Pompeius] genitus matre
Lucilia, stirpis senatoriae.’ This Lucilia was Lucilius’ niece,
and her father, Lucilius’ brother, was a senator.

Lucilius was very intimate with Africanus the younger
and Laelius, and celebrated them in his works. Hor.
Sat.

ii. 1, 71,

‘Quin ubi se a volgo et scaena in secreta remorant

virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli,

nugari cum illo et discincti ludere, donec

decoqueretur olus, soliti.’

Schol. Cruq.
ad loc.
, ‘Scipio Africanus et Laelius feruntur
tam fuisse familiares et amici Lucilio, ut quodam tempore
Laelio circum lectos triclinii fugienti Lucilius superveniens
eum obtorta mappa quasi feriturus sequeretur.’

Hor.
Sat.
ii. 1, 16,

‘Attamen et iustum poteras et scribere fortem,

Scipiadam ut sapiens Lucilius.’

Lucil.
Sat.
xxx. 5 (of Scipio),

‘Sicubi ad auris

fama tuam pugnam clarans adlata dicasset.’

Such intimate association could not have existed if
Lucilius had been, as Jerome implies, only nineteen at
Scipio’s death in
B.C.
129.

There are many references to Lucilius’ attacks on public
men. Cf. Hor.
Sat.
ii. 1, 62,

‘Quid? cum est Lucilius ausus

primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem,

detrahere et pellem, nitidus qua quisque per ora

cederet, introrsum turpis, num Laelius et qui

duxit ab oppressa meritum Carthagine nomen

ingenio offensi aut laeso doluere Metello

famosisque Lupo cooperto versibus? atqui

primores populi arripuit populumque tributim,

scilicet uni aequus virtuti atque eius amicis.’

Lucil. lib. incert., ll. 63-4, quoted by Cic.
N.D.
i. 64,

‘“Tubulus si Lucius umquam,

si Lupus aut Carbo, Neptuni filius,”

ut ait Lucilius, putasset esse deos, tam periurus aut tam
impurus fuisset?’

Pers. 1, 114,

‘Secuit Lucilius urbem,

te Lupe, te Muci, et genuinum fregit in illis.’

Juv. 1, 165,

‘Ense velut stricto quotiens Lucilius ardens

infremuit, rubet auditor cui frigida mens est

criminibus, tacita sudant praecordia culpa.’

The Saturae.
—There were thirty Books altogether, by
whom arranged is unknown. Fragments are extant from
all the Books, except xxi. and xxiv. (and possibly xxiii. and
xxv.). Books i.-xx. and xxx. were in hexameters; xxii. in
elegiacs; xxvi.-xxvii. in trochaic septenarii; and the next
two in trochaic septenarii, iambic senarii, and hexameters.
Books xxvi.-xxix. were published first, then Book xxx. In
Book xxvi. Lucilius states his views of life, his poetic
principles, what led him to write satire, etc. Cf. l. 3,

‘Nunc itidem populum aucupamur istis cum scriptoribus.’

Lines 7-20 contain a conversation between Lucilius and a
friend who wishes him to engage in public life. Cf. ll. 16-7,

‘Publicanu’ vero ut Asiae fiam scripturarius

pro Lucilio, id ego nolo, et uno hoc non muto omnia.’

Two divisions of the work may be recognized—(i) Books
i.-xxi. (to which xxii.-xxv. may be an addition) in hexameters;
these Books are referred to as one collection by Varro,
L.L.

v. 17. (2) Books xxvi.-xxx. in various metres.

Dates of Composition.
—Hor.
Sat.
ii. 1, 62-70 (quoted
above), shows that Lucilius attacked Lupus and Metellus
while Scipio and Laelius were still alive,
i.e.
not after

B.C.
129; xxvi., ll. 88-9, in which Lucilius sneers at marriage,

‘Homines ipsi hanc sibi molestiam ultro atque aerumnam offerunt.

Ducunt uxores, producunt, quibus haec faveant, liberos,’

may have special reference to the attempts of Metellus in
his censorship (
B.C.
131) to encourage it. If this is so, Books
xxvi.-xxx. were composed about
B.C.
131-129. Book i. was
composed after the death of Carneades in
B.C.
129 (cf. l. 12,
‘nec si Carneaden ipsum Orcu’ remittat’), and probably soon
after the death of Lupus, on whom the gods are represented
as sitting in judgment.

Serv. ad
Aen.
x. 104, ‘Totus hic locus de primo Lucili
translatus est libro; ubi inducuntur di habere concilium et
agere primo de interitu Lupi cuiusdam ducis in re publica,
postea sententias dicere.’

In
B.C.
126 Lucilius was probably, along with other

peregrini
, banished under the law of M. Iunius Pennus,
trib. pl. in that year. He probably returned in
B.C.
124,
when the law was repealed by C. Graccus. Bk. xi. was
composed after the condemnation of L. Opimius in
B.C.

110. Cf. ll. 19-21,

‘Quintus Opimius ille, Iugurtini pater huius,

et formosus homo fuit et famosus, utrumque

primo adulescens, posterius dat rectiu’ sese.’

Subjects of the Satires.
—These were very varied. Besides
personal satire, we have (1) ethical criticism, as ridicule
of philosophers and attacks on luxury.

Lib. incert. ll. 134-5 (imitated by Hor.
Sat.
i. 3, 132

sqq.
;
Ep.
i. 1, 106-8),

‘Nondum etiam, qui haec omnia habebit,

formonsus, dives, liber, rex solu’ feretur?’

iv. 4-6 (cf. Hor.
Sat.
ii. 2, 46-8),

‘O Publi, o gurges, Galloni: es homo miser, inquit,

cenasti in vita numquam bene, cum omnia in ista

consumis squilla atque acupensere cum in decimano.’

(2) Travels, as the account of the journey to the Sicilian
Strait, imitated by Hor.
Sat.
i. 5.

(3) Literary criticism. Lucilius jeers at Ennius’ line,

‘Sparsis hastis longis campus splendet et horret,’

according to Servius ad
Aen.
xi. 601, ‘Est versus Ennianus
vituperatus a Lucilio dicente per irrisionem eum debuisse
dicere “horret et alget.”’ Euripides is criticised in xxix.,
frag. 9. Points of orthography and the like are also treated
of, cf. ix. 11,

‘Iam puerei venere. E postremum facito atque i,

ut pueri plures fiant. I si faci’ solum,

pupilli, pueri, Lucili hoc uniu’ fiet.’
[23]

Some other points may be noted:

(1) He addresses a large circle of readers, xxix. 99,

‘Persium non curo legere: Laelium Decumum volo.’

Cf. Cic.
de Or.
ii. 25, ‘Hic [Persius] fuit enim, ut noramus,

omnium fere nostrorum hominum doctissimus: “Laelium

Decimum volo,” quem cognovimus virum bonum et non

inlitteratum sed nihil ad Persium.’

(2) For his self-esteem of. xxvi. 16, (quoted above).
So xxx. 1,

‘Quoi sua conmittunt mortali claustra Camenae.’

(3) He often mixes Greek words with Latin. Cf. v. 12,

‘Hoc nolueris et debueris te

si minu’ delectat, quod
ÏÎµÏÎ½á½·Î¿Î½
Eisocratiumst

Î»Î·Ïá¿¶Î´ÎµÏ
que totum ac
ÏÏ
Î¼Î¼ÎµÎ¹ÏÎ±ÎºÎ¹á¿¶Î´ÎµÏ
,

non operam perdo.’

(4) For his carelessness as to style of. Hor.
Sat.
i. 4, 9,

‘In hora saepe ducentos,

ut magnum, versus dictabat, stans pede in uno:

cum flueret lutulentus, erat quod tollere velles;

garrulus atque piger scribendi ferre laborem,

scribendi recte; nam ut multum, nil moror.’

For Lucilius’ influence on other poets, see above; also
under ‘Persius,’
p. 262
. For Horace’s views on Lucilius, see
above; also
Sat.
i. 4; i. 10; ii. 1.

Cf. Quint. x. 1, 93, ‘Satira quidem tota nostra est, in
qua primus insignem laudem adeptus Lucilius quosdam ita
deditos sibi adhuc habet amatores, ut eum non eiusdem
modo operis auctoribus sed omnibus poetis praeferre non
dubitent. Ego quantum ab illis tantum ab Horatio dissentio,
qui Lucilium “fluere lutulentum” et “esse aliquid,
quod tollere possis” putat. Nam eruditio in eo mira et
libertas atque inde acerbitas et abundantia salis.’

ATTA AND AFRANIUS.

Writers of
togatae
were Atta and Afranius.

Sueton. p. 15
R.
, ‘Togatas tabernarias in scaenam dataverunt
praecipue duo, L. Afranius et T. Quintius.’

T. Quintius Atta died
B.C.
77, according to Jerome yr.
Abr. 1940, ‘T. Quintius Atta, scriptor togatarum, Romae
moritur.’

Eleven titles and about twenty lines of fragments are
extant. Horace refers to Atta in
Ep.
ii. 1, 79
sqq.
,

‘Recte necne crocum floresque perambulet Attae

fabula si dubitem, clament periisse pudorem

cuncti paene patres, ea cum reprendere coner

quae gravis Aesopus, quae doctus Roscius egit.’

L. Afranius was probably born between
B.C.
154 and 144.
He was the chief writer of
togatae
(Quint. x. 1, 100, ‘Togatis
excellit Afranius’), and also an orator.

Cic.
Brut.
167, ‘L. Afranius poeta, homo perargutus, in
fabulis quidem etiam ut scitis disertus.’

There are extant forty-two titles (with Latin names) and
more than four hundred lines of fragments. The plays
exhibit Roman surroundings, and describe low life, especially
of the provincial towns. Cf. the title
Brundusinae
,
also l. 136,

‘Ubi hice Moschis, quaeso, habet, meretrix Neapolitis?’

Afranius imitated Menander, and probably Terence.

Hor.
Ep.
ii. 1, 57,

‘Dicitur Afrani toga convenisse Menandro.’

Macrob.
Saturn.
vi. 1, 4, ‘Afranius togatarum scriptor in
ea togata, quae Compitalia inscribitur, non inverecunde
respondens arguentibus, quod plura sumpsisset a Menandro,

“Fateor” inquit “sumpsi non ab illo modo,

sed ut quisque habuit conveniret quod mihi,

quod me non posse melius facere credidi

etiam a Latino”’ (ll. 25-8).

Sueton.
vit. Ter.
p. 33
R.
, ‘Terentium Afranius omnibus
comicis praefert.’

MINOR POETS:

(
a
) The poets immediately after Afranius include

(1) Hostius.—He was perhaps the grandfather of Cynthia
(Hostia), Propertius’ mistress. Prop. iv. 20, 7,

‘Est tibi forma potens; sunt castae Palladis artes,

splendidaque a docto fama refulget avo.’

There are nine lines extant from his epic poem
Bellum
Histricum
, which was probably on the war of
B.C.
125.
Frag. 5 (BÃ¤hrens),

‘Non si mihi linguae

centum atque ora sient totidem vocesque liquatae,’

is from
Il.
ii. 489, and is imitated by Verg.
Aen.
vi. 625
(as noticed by Macrob.
Saturn.
vi. 3, 6).

(2) Writers of epigrams—Pompilius, Valerius Aedituus,
Porcius Licinus, and Q. Lutatius Catulus (cons.
B.C.
102).

(3) Q. Valerius Soranus wrote verse on philology and
archaeology.

(4) Volcacius Sedigitus wrote verse on literary history
up to the time of the
fabula palliata
. He wrote
indices

of Plautus (Gell. iii. 3, 1), and a work
De Poetis
, which
included his canon on the comic poets (Gell. xv. 24).

‘Caecilio palmam Statio do mimico.

Plautus secundus facile exuperat ceteros.

Dein Naevius, qui fervet, pretio in tertiost.

Si erit, quod quarto detur, dabitur Licinio.

Post insequi Licinium facio Atilium.

In sexto consequetur hos Terentius,

Turpilius septimum, Trabea octavum optinet,

nono loco esse facile facio Luscium.

Decimum addo causa antiquitatis Ennium.’

(
b
) The following poets wrote during Cicero’s youth,
B.C.

106-84:

(1) Cn. Matius, author of
Mimiambi
, and a translation
of the
Iliad
. An example of the last is Frag. I (BÃ¤hrens) =

Il.
i. 56,

‘Corpora Graiorum maerebat mandier igni.’

(2) Laevius, author of
Erotopaegnia
, of a lyrical character.
Porphyr. ad Hor.
Od.
iii. 1, 2, ‘Romanis utique
non prius audita, quamvis Laevius lyrica ante Horatium
scripserit; sed videntur illa non Graecorum lege ad lyricum
characterem exacta.’

About sixty lines are extant. Gell. xix. 7 speaks of
Laevius’ curious vocabulary, and instances
oblittera
for

oblitterata
;
trisaeclisenex
,
dulciorelocus
, etc.

(3) A. Furius of Antium. Only six lines are extant.

(4) C. Iulius Caesar Strabo, a tragic writer and orator.

(5) Sueius. His works are (
a
)
Moretum
, an idyll; (
b
)

Pulli
, on the breeding of fowls; (
c
)
Nidus
; (
d
) an epic
poem,
Annales
.

(6) Writers of
fabula Atellana
;
[24]
Novius and L. Pomponius
(Bononiensis). Fronto p. 62 (ed. Naber), ‘Elegantis
Novium et Pomponium et id genus in verbis rusticanis et
iocularibus ac ridiculariis.’

Of Novius forty-three titles and over one hundred lines
are preserved, and of Pomponius about seventy titles and
two hundred lines. The well-known characters of the
fabula
Atellana
are retained, as is seen from the titles. Cf.
Duo
Dosseni
,
Maccus Copa
of Novius;
Bucco Adoptatus
,
Maccus
Miles
,
Maccus Sequester
,
Maccus Virgo
of Pomponius.

PROSE WRITERS OF THE SAME PERIOD:

L. Cornelius Sisenna
(praetor
B.C.
78), author of
Historiae

of the Social and Civil Wars (Vell. Pat. ii. 9). Cicero
thought him superior to his predecessors, but childish
(
Brut.
228,
De Leg.
i. 7), and Sallust remarks his want
of frankness in speaking of Sulla’s career (
Iug.
95). He
avoided a piecemeal and desultory treatment of events;
cf. his own words quoted by Gell. xii. 15, 2, ‘Nos una
aestate in Asia et Graecia gesta litteris idcirco continentia
mandavimus, ne vellicatim aut saltuatim scribendo lectorum
animos impediremus.’ His translation of the
ÎÎ¹Î»Î·ÏÎ¹Î±ÎºÎ¬

of Aristides is mentioned by Ovid,
Tr.
ii. 443.

Contemporary with Sisenna were
Q. Claudius Quadrigarius
,
and
Valerius Antias
, whose narrative was coloured
by partiality for the Valerii and for Scipio Africanus (
see
under ‘Livy’
).

C. Licinius Macer
, father of the poet Calvus, was one
of Livy’s sources for the early history. Dion. Hal. (vi. 11
and vii. 1) complains of his carelessness and the weakness
of his chronology. He claimed that he used original
authorities,
e.g.
the
libri lintei
, lists of magistrates written
on linen. He was a strong democrat, and is looked upon
by Mommsen (
R.H.
iv., p. 602) as manufacturing authorities
in support of his political views.

Sulla
wrote memoirs of his own life (Plut.
Lucull.
1),
and
Lucullus
composed in Greek a history of the Marsian
War (
ibid.
).

CHAPTER II

THE CICERONIAN AGE.

CICERO.

(1) LIFE.

M. Tullius Cicero, the son of a Roman knight, was born
at Arpinum on 3rd January,
B.C.
106. Jerome yr. Abr.
1911, ‘M. Tullius Cicero Arpini nascitur matre Helvia,
patre equestris ordinis ex regio Volscorum genere.’ Cic.

ad Att.
xiii. 42, 3, ‘Diem meum scis esse iii. Non. Ian.’

He gives an account of his education in
Brut.
306
sqq.

In civil law he was a pupil, in
B.C.
89, of Q. Scaevola
the Augur, and afterwards of the pontifex of the same
name (
de Am.
1). In
B.C.
88 he studied philosophy under
Philo the Academic, and rhetoric under Molo of Rhodes.
Dialectic he practised with the Stoic Diodotus, who lived
and died in Cicero’s house (
B.C.
87-5). Other teachers of
Cicero were the poet Archias (
pro Arch.
1), the orator
Antonius (
de Or.
ii. 3), the actors Roscius and Aesopus
(Plut.
Cic.
5), the rhetorician M. Antonius Gnipho (Sueton.

Gramm.
7), and the philosophers Phaedrus and Zeno.

After establishing a reputation at the bar by his defence
of Quinctius and of Roscius of Ameria, he visited Asia
to recruit his health and improve his oratorical style.
On his way to the East he stayed six months at Athens,
where he renewed his philosophical studies under Antiochus
the Academic. In Asia he attended the leading rhetoricians,
especially his old teacher Molo at Rhodes, who
endeavoured to chasten the exuberance of his manner.
At Rhodes he also made the acquaintance of the famous
Stoic Posidonius (
de Fin.
i. 6). After an absence of two
years he returned to Rome
B.C.
77, and shortly afterwards
married Terentia.

Cicero, who had served in the Social War,
B.C.
89
(
Phil.
xii. 27), began his official career in 75 as quaestor
of the district of Lilybaeum in Sicily, where he won
golden opinions from all classes (
pro Planc.
64). He
headed the poll at the election of aediles for 69, and of
praetors for 66 (
in Pis.
2); as praetor he presided over
the court for the trial of cases of
repetundae
(
pro Clu.
147).
His canvass for the consulship of 63 began as
early as July 65 (
ad Att.
i. 1, 1); he was returned with
C. Antonius as his colleague (
in Pis.
3). His services to
the State in 63 in the crushing of the Catilinarian conspiracy
need not be dwelt on here: his activity as an
orator in that year was great, and he passed a law against
undue influence by candidates, ‘Lex Tullia de ambitu’
(
in Vat.
37). He waived his right to a province, allowing
Metellus Celer to take Gaul.

In 58 the hostility of P. Clodius effected Cicero’s banishment,
on the ground that he had put the Catilinarian
conspirators to death without trial. Retiring at first
to Vibo, in Lucania, he moved successively to Sicily,
Thurii, Tarentum, Brundisium, Dyrrhachium, Thessalonica,
and Athens. At Dyrrhachium he resided from November
58 to August 57, when, after several unsuccessful efforts
by his friends, a law was passed for his recall.

In 53 he was chosen augur in succession to the younger
Crassus (Plut.
Cic.
36), and two years later was appointed
proconsul of Cilicia, under the new arrangement providing
for an interval of five years between office in Rome and
the government of a province. There he carried on a
petty warfare with the mountaineers, and captured the fort
of Pindenissus (a success for which the Senate decreed
a
supplicatio
), occupying the winter with judicial business
in the towns. His absence from the centre of affairs,
though it lasted only a year, was most distasteful to him;
cf.
ad Att.
v. 11, 1, ‘Ne provincia nobis prorogetur, per
fortunas! dum ades, quidquid provideri potest, provide:
non dici potest quam flagrem desiderio urbis, quam vix
harum rerum insulsitatem feram.’ For his just dealing
with the provincials, cf.
ad Att.
v. 21, 5.

In November, 50, Cicero returned to Italy, to find a
crisis imminent, and finally cast in his lot with the senatorial
party. He left Rome with the consuls and the
leading
optimates
, and for some time had charge of the
district of Capua (
ad Fam.
xvi. 11, 3, ‘nos Capuam
sumpsimus’). On 7th June,
B.C.
49, he embarked to
join Pompey in Epirus, though far from enthusiastic for
his leadership (
ad Fam.
vii. 3, 2, ‘mei facti poenituit...
Nihil boni praeter causam.’) The chiefs of the party
looked upon him with suspicion, and he was not present
at the battle of Pharsalus. After Pompey’s overthrow he
returned to Brundisium, and in 47 was allowed by Caesar
to return to Rome (
ad Fam.
xiv. 23). His mode of life
at this time he thus describes (
ad Fam.
ix. 20, 3), ‘Ubi
salutatio defluxit, litteris me involvo, aut scribo aut lego.
Veniunt etiam qui me audiant quasi doctum hominem,
quia paullo sum quam ipsi doctior.’

In 46 he divorced his wife Terentia, of whose neglect
he complains,
ad Fam.
iv. 14, 3; and married Publilia,
with whom he parted in the following year. In 45 he
lost his only daughter Tullia, who had been thrice married;
he tried to drown his grief by close application to literary
work, moving about from villa to villa, and it is to this
period that most of his philosophical works belong. In
44 he appeared once more in Rome, and took a prominent
part in the proceedings which followed upon Caesar’s death.
April to July he spent at his various villas (
ad Att.
xiv.

passim
), and then decided to visit Athens, where his son
(born
B.C.
65) was studying. On 1st August he reached
Syracuse, but hearing at Leucopetra that his presence was
required at Rome, he gave up his plan of travel and
returned to the city. With the series of
Philippics
against
Antony (44-3) Cicero’s career closes. In the proscription
agreed on by the triumvirs he was marked out as one
of the chief victims. A fragment of Livy, quoted by
Seneca,
Suas.
6, 17, states that he fled first to Tusculum,
then to Formiae, and took ship from Caieta, but returned
to land, exclaiming, ‘Moriar in patria saepe servata.’ On
his way from the shore to his villa he was slain by a
party of Antony’s soldiers, and his head was carried to
Rome and exposed on the Rostra. The date of the
assassination was 7th December,
B.C.
43 (Tiro quoted by
Tac.
Dial.
17).

(2) WORKS.

(a) Speeches.

1. The earliest extant speech is that
Pro Quinctio
,
delivered
B.C.
81 (Gell. xv. 28, 3) in an action before a
iudex for restitution of property. This was not Cicero’s
first appearance as an advocate: Â§ 4, ‘quod mihi consuevit
in ceteris causis esse adiumento.’

2. Next year (cf. Gell.
ibid.
) Cicero made his first speech
in a criminal case, defending Sex. Roscius of Ameria on a
charge of parricide. By so doing he incurred the risk of
Sulla’s enmity, but at the same time established his own
position.
De Off.
ii. 51, ‘contra L. Sullae dominantis opes
pro S. Roscio Amerino’;
Brut.
312, ‘prima causa publica,
pro Sex. Roscio dicta, tantum commendationis habuit, ut
non ulla esset quae non digna nostro patrocinio videretur.’
In later years he criticized the ‘iuvenilis redundantia’ of
this speech (
Orat.
108).

3. The speech
Pro Roscio Comoedo
, usually assigned to

B.C.
76, was a defence of the famous actor in a civil case.

4. The year 70
B.C.
is memorable for the group of
speeches (‘accusationis vii. libri,’
Orat.
103), against Verres,
accused of
repetundae
by the Sicilians, at whose urgent
entreaty Cicero undertook the prosecution. The preliminary
question, who should conduct the prosecution, is
argued in the
Divinatio in Caecilium
. Q. Caecilius Niger,
Verres’ quaestor, claimed the right to prosecute, but this
manoeuvre failed. Of the six speeches
in Verrem
only
one, the
Actio Prima
, was delivered: Cicero, seeing that
the other side were anxious to carry the trial over into
the next year, confined himself to this short introductory
speech (on 5th August, cf. Â§ 31), after which he called his
witnesses. Their evidence was so damaging that Hortensius
[25]

threw up the defence, and Verres was sentenced
to banishment and his property confiscated. The five
Books of the
Actio Secunda
were published afterwards
in order that the facts might be thoroughly known.

5.
Pro M. Fonteio
(incomplete), for Fonteius, propraetor
of Gallia Narbonensis
B.C.
75-3, on a charge of
repetundae
.
This trial perhaps took place
B.C.
69, certainly after the
equites had been placed on the
iudicia
by the Lex Aurelia
of 70 (cf. Â§ 26).

6. To the same year probably belongs the speech
Pro
Caecina
in a civil case.

7. In
B.C.
66 Cicero made his first political speech,

Pro Lege Manilia
, or
De Imperio Cn. Pompei
, in support
of the bill of the tribune Manilius for conferring on Pompey
the command against Mithradates.

8. In the same year he defended Cluentius, charged
with murder, in the speech
Pro A. Cluentio Habito
. The
date is fixed as the year of Cicero’s praetorship by Â§ 147,
‘mea quaestio de pecuniis repetundis.’

9. The three speeches
De Lege Agraria
are concerned
with the bill of P. Servilius Rullus for the appointment of

decemviri
with full power to buy and sell land and to
establish colonies. The first speech (incomplete) was made
in the Senate on 1st January, the second and third before

contiones
.

10. The speech
Pro C. Rabirio perduellionis reo
was
delivered on behalf of Rabirius, charged before the
comitia

with the murder of the tribune Saturninus in
B.C.
100. The
prosecution had been instituted by the democratic party
to vindicate the old right of
provocatio ad populum
, and to
establish the inviolability of the tribunes.

11. Of the four speeches
In Catilinam
, i. was delivered
in the Senate on 8th November, and followed by Catiline’s
flight from Rome; ii. to the people on 9th November;
iii. to the people on 3rd December, when the Allobroges
gave their evidence about the conspiracy; iv. in the Senate,
on 5th December, calling for the capital punishment of the
conspirators.
[26]

12. In this crisis Cicero made one of his most graceful
and witty speeches, the
Pro Murena
. The defendant was
charged with bribery in his candidature for the consulship,
and among the prosecutors was Cato.

13-14. In
B.C.
62 Cicero defended P. Sulla, who was
accused of complicity with Catiline (
Pro Sulla
), and
delivered the speech
Pro Archia
in support of his friend’s
title to the Roman citizenship.

15. In
B.C.
59 L. Flaccus was accused of
repetundae
as
propraetor of Asia 62-60, and defended by Cicero in the
speech
Pro Flacco
.

16-19. After Cicero’s return from exile he returned thanks
to the Senate in the speech
Cum Senatui gratias egit
, 5th September

B.C.
57 (
ad Att.
iv. 1, 5), delivered from manuscript
(‘propter rei magnitudinem dicta de scripto,’
Pro Planc.

74). The genuineness of the corresponding speech to
the people,
Cum populo gratias egit
, is suspected; it is
mentioned by Dio. xxxix. 9, 1, but not by Cicero himself.
On 30th September (
ad Att.
iv. 2, 2) the speech
De Domo
Sua
was delivered before the
pontifices
, who decided that
the site of Cicero’s house, which Clodius had consecrated,
should be restored to its owner. Connected with this is
the speech
De Haruspicum Responsis
, of the year 56, rebutting
the argument of Clodius that the declaration of the

haruspices
, ‘loca sacra et religiosa profana haberi’ (Â§ 9)
referred to the restitution of Cicero’s house.

20. The speech
Pro Sestio
is in defence of one of Cicero’s
friends who, as tribune, had worked energetically for his
recall from exile, and was now accused
de vi
at the instigation
of Clodius. Sestius was acquitted in March,
B.C.

56 (
ad Q.F.
ii. 4, 1).

21. The
Interrogatio in P. Vatinium testem
was a successful
attack on the credibility of Vatinius, who had been one
of the chief witnesses against Sestius.

22.
Pro M. Caelio
.—The prosecution of Caelius on a
charge of poisoning was instigated by his former mistress,
Clodia; it took place in
B.C.
56, for Cn. Domitius, who
tried the case (Â§ 32), was praetor in that year (
ad Q.F.
ii. 3, 6).

23. The speech
De Provinciis Consularibus
,
B.C.
56, argues
that Caesar should be allowed to continue as proconsul
of Gaul, and that Syria and Macedonia should be taken
away from Gabinius and Piso. Mommsen
[27]
regards it as
the
ÏÎ±Î»Î¹Î½á¿³Î´á½·Î±
of
ad Att.
iv. 5, 1, and contrasts Cicero’s
tone to Caesar in this speech with his attitude in the
Pro
Sestio
,
In Vatinium
, and
De Haruspicum Responsis
.

24. The speech
Pro Balbo
deals with a case similar to
that of Archias. L. Cornelius Balbus, a native of Gades,
and the trusted friend of Caesar, had received the
civitas

from Pompey, and this speech is in defence of his right
thereto (
B.C.
56).

25.
In Pisonem
, an attack on Cicero’s enemy (consul

B.C.
58), delivered in the Senate
B.C.
55.

26.
Pro Plancio
,
B.C.
54, on behalf of Cn. Plancius,
accused of organizing clubs to secure by bribery his election
to the aedileship.

27.
Pro Rabirio Postumo
,
B.C.
54. Rabirius was charged
with extortion in Egypt.

28.
Pro Milone
.—At the trial of Milo
de vi
in
B.C.
52
Cicero was so intimidated by the uproar of the rabble
that his speech was a failure, and Milo was condemned.
The speech now extant was written by Cicero at his leisure.
Both were known to Asconius,
[28]
who supplies a valuable
introduction.

29. For six years we have no speech; but in 46 Cicero
broke his rule of silence (‘in perpetuum tacere,’
ad Fam.

iv. 4, 4), and in the speech
Pro Marcello
thanked Caesar
for allowing Marcellus, the consul of
B.C.
51, to return to
Rome.

30. On 26th November
B.C.
46 he pleaded before Caesar
the cause of Q. Ligarius (
Pro Ligario
).

31. In the latter part of
B.C.
45 he delivered in Caesar’s
house the speech
Pro Rege Deiotaro
on behalf of his
‘hospes vetus et amicus,’ the tetrarch of Galatia, accused
of treachery to Caesar.

32. Cicero’s oratorical career closes with the fourteen
speeches against Antony, called
Philippics
, after the
speeches of Demosthenes. This title was suggested by
the author himself; cf. the letter of Brutus (
ad Brut.
ii. 5, 4),
‘iam concedo ut vel Philippicae vocentur, quod tu quadam
epistula iocans scripsisti.’ It was the usual title in
antiquity, though Gellius (xiii. 1, 1) uses the alternative

Antonianae
. The
Philippics
cover the period from 2nd
September 44 to 22nd April 43. They were all delivered
in the Senate, except iv. and vi., which are
contiones
, and
ii., which was never spoken, but published as a political
pamphlet after Antony had left Rome: for its fame cf.
Juv. 10, 125,

‘Te conspicuae, divina Philippica, famae,

volveris a prima quae proxima.’

There are fragments of about twenty speeches, and the
titles of thirty others are known. The invective
in Sallustium
,
and the speech
Pridie quam in exilium iret
, are
undoubtedly spurious.

Many of the speeches were to a large extent extempore,
the heads only being committed to writing. These notes
were afterwards collected by Tiro (Quint. x. 7, 30-1). In
publishing, Cicero occasionally omitted some passages of
the spoken oration,
e.g.
in
Pro Mur.
57 only the headings
appear, ‘De Postumi criminibus.’ ‘De Servi adulescentis’:
cf. Plin.
Ep.
i. 20, 7, ‘ex his apparet illum permulta dixisse,
cum ederet omisisse.’ For the practice of reporting his
speeches in shorthand cf. Ascon.
in Mil.
‘manet illa quoque
excepta eius oratio’ (his speech at Milo’s trial). The only
case in which Cicero appeared for the prosecution was that
of Verres: the part of an accuser was generally distasteful
to him; cf.
De Off.
ii. 50, ‘duri hominis vel potius vix
hominis videtur, periculum capitis inferre multis.’

(b) Philosophical Works.

1.
De Re Publica
, a discussion of the ideal state and the
ideal citizen, was published before
B.C.
51, for Caelius
writes to Cicero in Cilicia, ‘tui politici libri omnibus vigent’
(
ad Fam.
viii. 1, 4). In this treatise Cicero made use of
Plato, and of Aristotle, Theophrastus, and other Peripatetics
(
de Div.
ii. 3). There were six Books; but until 1822 the

Somnium Scipionis
, extracted by Macrobius from Book vi.,
was the only portion of the work known to exist, with the
exception of a few fragments. In that year Mai published
at Rome, from a Vatican palimpsest, remains which make
up about one-third of the whole.

2. The
De Legibus
succeeded the
De Re Publica
, as
Plato’s
Laws
came after the
Republic
. The speakers in
this dialogue are Atticus, Cicero, and his brother Quintus.
Book i. expounds the Stoic position that the laws of the
ideal state are made by the wise man in accordance with
the mind of God; this position is worked out in Book ii.
in the regulations for religion, and in iii. on the duties of
magistrates. The treatise was never completed, and was
perhaps a posthumous publication: it is not mentioned in
the list in
De Divinatione
ii. 1-3, and there is no preface,
though Cicero says (
ad Att.
iv. 16, 2) ‘in singulis libris
utor prooemiis.’ Certainly it had not appeared in
B.C.
46,
the year of the
Brutus
(
Brut.
19). It was composed after
the murder of Clodius in January,
B.C.
52 (ii. 42), and in
Pompey’s lifetime (iii. 22): probably in 52, as the government
of Cilicia and the civil war left Cicero no time for
literature during the years 51-48.

3. In the spring of 46 was written the short tract

Paradoxa
, a discussion of six Stoic paradoxes (
e.g.
that
the wise man alone is free). It was addressed to Brutus,
and was later than the dialogue which bears his name;
cf. the preface, ‘accipies hoc parvum opusculum, lucubratum
his iam contractioribus noctibus, quoniam illud
maiorum vigiliarum munus in tuo nomine apparuit.’

4. The death of Tullia in February, 45, led Cicero to
write, at Astura, a
Consolatio
, of which only fragments
survive. Plin.
N.H.
praef. 22, quotes Cicero as saying
that he here followed the Greek philosopher, Crantor,
ÏÎµÏá½¶ ÏÎ­Î½Î¸Î¿Ï
Ï
.
It contained notices of the deaths of great men,

De Div.
ii. 22, ‘clarissimorum hominum nostrae civitatis
gravissimos exitus in Consolatione collegimus.’

5. In the
Hortensius
Cicero appeared as the champion
of philosophy:
De Fin.
i. 2, ‘philosophiae vituperatoribus
satis responsum est eo libro, quo a nobis philosophia defensa
et collaudata est, cum esset accusata et vituperata
ab Hortensio.’ It cannot be traced beyond the seventh
century, and is now represented by a few fragments. In
the Middle Ages it was confounded with the
Prior
Academics
, the speakers in both dialogues being the same.
The
Hortensius
seems to have been written before Cicero
went to Astura in March,
B.C.
45: there is no allusion to
it in his letters.

6. The treatise
De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum
discusses
various theories of the
summum bonum
—the Epicurean
in Books i.-ii., the Stoic in iii.-iv., the Peripatetic
in v. The scene of the dialogue changes from Cumae to
Tusculum and then to the Academy at Athens. The work
was dedicated to Brutus in June, 45 (
ad Att.
xiii. 12, 3).

7. The
Academics
appeared in two editions. Of the
original edition Book ii., entitled
Lucullus
, has survived;
the speakers in it are Lucullus, Catulus, Hortensius, and
Cicero, and the scene, Hortensius’ villa. Cicero was not
satisfied with this arrangement (
ad Att.
xiii. 12, 3, ‘homines
nobiles illi quidem, sed nullo modo philologi, nimis acute
locuntur’), and after provisionally transferring the parts
of Lucullus, Catulus, and Hortensius, to Cato and Brutus,
he finally adopted the suggestion of Atticus to gratify
Varro by giving him a share in the dialogue together
with Atticus and himself (
ad Att.
xiii. 13, 1, ‘commotus
tuis litteris, quod ad me de Varrone scripseras, totam
Academiam ab hominibus nobilissimis abstuli transtulique
ad nostrum sodalem et ex duobus libris contuli
in quattuor’). Of this second edition in four Books we
possess only Book i. (incomplete), and fragments of the
others; the scene is at Cumae. The dedicatory epistle
to Varro is still preserved (
ad Fam.
ix. 8).

8. In the five Books of
Tusculanae Disputationes
, conversations
between Cicero and a friend at his Tusculan
villa, the subject is the chief essentials for happiness.
Book i. inculcates the proper attitude towards death, ii. to
grief, iii. to pain, iv. to other trials, v. asserts the sufficiency of virtue for happiness. The treatise is dedicated
to Brutus, and was finished by
B.C.
44, in which year
(
ad Att.
xv. 2, 4) the first Book is known to Atticus.

9.
De Natura Deorum
, in three Books, is also addressed
to Brutus. The Epicurean, Stoic, and Peripatetic doctrines
are represented by C. Velleius, Q. Lucilius Balbus, and
C. Aurelius Cotta, respectively. This treatise was written
after the
Tusculans
(
de Div.
ii. 3): in July 45 (
ad Att.

xiii. 39, 2) Atticus is asked for the loan of
Î¦Î±Î¯Î´ÏÎ¿Ï
ÏÎµÏá½¶ Î¸Îµá¿¶Î½
and
ÏÎµÏá½¶ Î Î±Î»Î»Î¬Î´Î¿Ï
.

10. The essay
De Senectute
, called also
Cato Maior
after
the principal speaker in the dialogue, was addressed to
Atticus at the end of 45 or early in 44 (
de Div.
ii. 3;

ad Att.
xiv. 21, 3).

11. To a later date in the same year belongs the
Laelius
,
or
De Amicitia
(
de Am.
4 mentions the
de Sen.
), in which
Laelius discourses on friendship. In this book, according
to Gell. i. 3, 10-11, Cicero was under obligations to
Theophrastus
ÏÎµÏá½¶ ÏÎ¹Î»Î¯Î±Ï
.

12.
De Divinatione
, in two Books, forms a supplement
to the
De Natura Deorum
. Cicero and his brother discuss,
at Tusculum, the nature and validity of ‘divinatio,’
which is defined (i. 9) as ‘earum rerum quae fortuitae
putantur praedictio atque praesensio.’ The date is 44.

13. The incomplete essay
De Fato
was written in 44,
after Caesar’s death (cf. Â§ 2). The conversation takes place
at Puteoli, between Cicero and the consul-designate Hirtius.

14. On 11th July of the same year Cicero sent to
Atticus his treatise
De Gloria
, in two Books, now lost
(
ad Att.
xvi. 2, 6;
de Off.
ii. 31).

15. The latest of the extant philosophical works is the

De Officiis
, written for the instruction of the author’s son.
Cicero had completed two Books by November,
B.C.
44
(xvi. 11, 4), following the treatment of Panaetius, and
discussing in Book i. the issue between vice and virtue,
in Book ii. the expediency of a given action. In Book iii.
he was indebted to Posidonius, for the discussion of
apparent conflict between virtue and expediency.

There are traces of two other treatises,
De Virtutibus

and
De Auguriis
; and we possess fragments of a translation
of Plato’s
Protagoras
and
Timaeus
, which cannot
be earlier than
B.C.
45 (
de Fin.
i. 7).

Cicero propounds no original scheme of philosophy,
claiming only that he renders the conclusions of Greek
thinkers accessible to his own countrymen. This sort of
work cost him little trouble:
ad Att.
xii. 52, 3, ‘
á¼ÏÏÎ³ÏÎ±ÏÎ±

sunt; minore labore fiunt: verba tantum affero, quibus
abundo.’ At the same time he is not a mere translator:

de Fin.
i. 6, ‘nos non interpretum fungimur munere, sed
tuemur ea quae dicta sunt ab eis quos probamus, eisque
nostrum iudicium et nostrum scribendi ordinem adiungimus.’
His motives for entering upon this task are explained
in
De Nat. Deor.
i. 7-9: (1) he desired to do a
service to his country: ‘ipsius rei publicae causa philosophiam nostris hominibus explicandam putavi’; (2) he
sought relief for his own mind: ‘hortata etiam est ut me
ad haec conferrem animi aegritudo, fortunae magna et
gravi conmota iniuria.’ Cicero is an eclectic, with a
leaning to the New Academy:
Tusc.
iv. 7, ‘nullis unius
disciplinae legibus adstricti, quibus in philosophia necessario
pareamus.’ Probability is all that he expects to reach:

ibid.
, ‘quid sit in quaque re maxime probabile semper
requiremus.’ The philosophy most attractive to him is
that which best called forth the oratorical faculty:
Tusc.

ii. 9, ‘mihi semper Peripateticorum Academiaeque consuetudo
de omnibus rebus in contrarias partes differendi
... placuit ... quod esset ea maxima dicendi exercitatio.’
[29]

(c) Rhetorical Treatises.

I. The earliest of these is
De Inventione
, or
Rhetorica
,
in two Books, written probably for the author’s own use
during Sulla’s absence in Asia
B.C.
87-83. In his mature
years Cicero looked back with contempt on this youthful
effort:
de Or.
i. 5, ‘quae pueris aut adulescentulis nobis ex
commentariolis nostris incohata ac rudia exciderunt.’ He
borrows much from the
Rhet. ad Herenn.
, and frequently
mentions and criticises the views of Hermagoras; but all
the best writers on rhetoric were laid under contribution:
ii. 4, ‘omnibus unum in locum coactis scriptoribus,
quod quisque commodissime praecipere videbatur, excerpsimus.’

2. The three Books
De Oratore
were finished in 55:

ad Att.
iv. 13, 2, ‘de libris oratoriis factum est a me
diligenter: diu multumque in manibus fuerunt: describas
licet.’ They were written at a time when Cicero’s voice
was seldom heard:
ad Fam.
i. 9, 23, ‘ab orationibus
diiungo me fere referoque ad mansuetiores Musas.’ The
dialogue takes place in
B.C.
91, at the Tusculan villa of
L. Licinius Crassus; he and the rival orator, M. Antonius,
are the chief speakers.

3. The dialogue
Brutus
, or
De Claris Oratoribus
, after
a brief survey of Greek oratory, criticises the Roman
orators from L. Brutus to Cicero’s own time. In spite of
his intention to omit living persons (Â§ 231), he discusses
Caesar, M. Marcellus, and himself. The speakers are
Brutus, Atticus, and Cicero; and the date is probably 46,
for the
Brutus
is earlier than the
Orator
, which refers
to it (Â§ 23).

4. The
Orator
or
De Optimo Genere Dicendi
is a sequel
to the
De Oratore
and the
Brutus
, adding practical rules
to the exposition of theory (
de Div.
ii. 4). It was written
at the request of Brutus, to whom it is addressed, in the
year 46 (
ad Fam.
xii. 17, 2).

5.
Partitiones Oratoriae
is a catechism on rhetoric, in
which the questions are put to Cicero by his son.

6. The
Topica
was written in response to repeated requests
from Trebatius for explanation of Aristotle’s
Topics
.
It was done by Cicero, without the aid of books, on his
voyage from Velia to Rhegium in July, 44 (
Top.
5;
ad
Fam.
vii. 19).

7. The short treatise
De Optimo Genere Oratorum
was
introductory to a version of the speeches of Demosthenes
and Aeschines ‘on the Crown,’ designed to show the
Romans what the best Attic oratory was like.

(d) Letters.

Cicero’s correspondence begins
B.C.
68 with
ad Att.
i. 5,
and ends 28th July,
B.C.
43. Besides seven hundred and
seventy-four letters written by Cicero, we have ninety addressed
to him by friends. The collection was made by
friends like Tiro and Atticus: cf.
ad Att.
xvi. 5, 5 (
B.C.
44),
‘Mearum epistularum nulla est
ÏÏ
Î½Î±Î³ÏÎ³Î®
, sed habet Tiro
instar septuaginta, et quidem sunt a te quaedam sumendae:
eas ego oportet perspiciam, corrigam; tum denique edentur.’

The letters now extant fall into four groups.

i.
Epistulae ad Atticum
, in sixteen Books, belonging to
the years
B.C.
68-43, and valuable for their thorough frankness
(
ad Att.
viii. 14, 2, ‘ego tecum tamquam mecum
loquor’). Nepos appreciates their supreme importance
for the history of Cicero’s time, although he dates the
commencement of the correspondence wrongly:
Att.
16,
‘xvi. volumina epistularum ab consulatu eius usque ad extremum
tempus ad Atticum missarum; quae qui legat, non
multum desideret historiam contextam eorum temporum.’
Atticus’ own letters were not published, though Cicero
preserved them:
ad Att.
ix. 10, 4, ‘Evolvi volumen epistularum,
quod ego sub signo habeo servoque
diligentissime.’

2.
Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem
, in three Books, of
the years
B.C.
60-54.

3.
Epistulae ad Brutum
, originally in nine Books, of
which only two remain. The present Book i. was really
Book ix., and Book ii., which contains letters earlier than
those in Book i., may have formed part of the original
Book viii.

4.
Epistulae ad Familiares
, in sixteen Books, letters to
and from friends, written
B.C.
62-43. This title is not found
in any
MS.
Late
MSS.
and old editions have ‘Epistulae
Familiares’: for the title ‘Ad Diversos’ there is no
authority. In the best
MSS.
the Books are titled separately
by the name of the person to whom the first letter in each
is written,
e.g.
‘M. Tulli Ciceronis epistularum ad P. Lentulum
liber i.’

For the colloquial style of the letters cf.
ad Fam.
ix. 21, 1
(to Paetus), ‘Quid tibi ego in epistulis videor? nonne
plebeio sermone agere tecum? nec enim semper eodem
modo: quid enim simile habet epistula aut iudicio aut
contioni? ... epistulas vero cottidianis verbis texere solemus.’

The following works are now lost: (

Miscellaneous
prose writings.
—1. Panegyrics on Porcia (
ad Att.
xiii. 37, 3)
and Cato,
B.C.
45; and funeral orations written for other
people to deliver (
ad Q.F.
iii. 8, 5, ‘laudavit pater scripto
meo’).

2. Memoirs of Cicero’s consulship, written
B.C.
60, in
both Greek and Latin (
ad. Att.
i. 19, 10). He took great
pains with this book, and was anxious that it should be
well circulated (
ad Att.
ii. 1, 1).

3. A secret history,
Anekdota
, mentioned in letters of

B.C.
59 and 44 (
ad Att.
ii. 6, 2; xiv. 17, 6).

4.
Admiranda
, a collection of wonders (Pliny,
N.H.

xxxi. 51).

5.
Chorographia
, a book on geography, mentioned by
Priscian. The letters to Atticus show that Cicero was
studying the subject in
B.C.
59.

6. A work on law,
De iure civili in artem redigendo

(Gell. i. 22, 7).

7. A translation of Xenophon’s
Oeconomicus
, made when
Cicero was about the age of twenty (
de Off.
ii. 87).

Poems.
—1. Cicero’s earliest effort in verse was a poem
in tetrameters, entitled
Pontius Glaucus
: Plut.
Cic.
2,

ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÏÎ¹ ÏÎ¿Î¹Î·Î¼Î¬ÏÎ¹Î¿Î½ á¼ÏÎ¹ ÏÎ±Î¹Î´á½¸Ï Î±á½ÏÎ¿á¿¦ Î´Î¹Î±Ïá¿´Î¶ÎµÏÎ±Î¹ Î ÏÎ½ÏÎ¹Î¿Ï ÎÎ»Î±á¿¦ÎºÎ¿Ï á¼Î½ ÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î¼Î­ÏÏá¿³
ÏÎµÏÎ¿Î¹Î·Î¼Î­Î½Î¿Î½
.

2. In
B.C.
60 he made a verse translation of the astronomical
poems of Aratus,
ad Att.
ii. 1, 2, ‘Prognostica
mea ... propediem exspecta.’ Quotations are given in
De
Nat. Deor.
ii. 104
sqq.

3. In the same year he wrote a poem
De Suo Consulatu
,
in three Books:
ad Att.
i. 19, 10, ‘poema exspectato, ne
quod genus a me ipso laudis meae praetermittatur.’ A
long passage from Book ii., spoken by the Muse Urania,
is recited by Q. Cicero in
De Div.
i. 17
sqq.

4. Another poem in three Books,
De Temporibus Suis
,
belonged probably to the year 55. Cicero writes to Lentulus
in 54 (
ad Fam.
i. 9, 23), ‘scripsi versibus tres libros
de temporibus meis, quos iam pridem ad te misissem, si
esse edendos putassem.’

5. In the letters to Quintus from June to December,
54, there is frequent mention of a poem
Ad Caesarem
.
Quintus is consulted for information about Britain:
ad
Q.F.
ii. 15, 2, ‘mihi date Britanniam, quam pingam
coloribus tuis, penicillo meo.’

6. A poem on Cicero’s great townsman Marius is quoted,

De Div.
i. 106.

Among others quoted are
Limon
, in which Terence was
praised (see
p. 51
), and
iocularis libellus
(Quint. viii. 6,
73). Translations from Greek poets occur in the philosophical
works, e.g.
de Fin.
v. 49, from Homer,
Odys.
xii.
184-191;
Tusc.
ii. 23, from various parts of Aeschylus,

Prom. Vinct.

The ancient criticisms on Cicero’s poetry are all unfavourable:

De Off.
i. 77, ‘Illud optimum est, in quo invadi solere ab
improbis et invidis audio:

“Cedant arma togae, concedat laurea laudi.”’

Juv. 10, 122,

‘“O fortunatam natam me consule Romam!”

Antoni gladios potuit contemnere, si sic

omnia dixisset.’

Tac.
Dial.
21 (quoted
p. 111
).

Quint. xi. 1, 24, ‘In carminibus utinam pepercisset, quae
non desierunt carpere maligni.’

Rhetorica ad Herennium
.—This treatise on rhetoric in
four Books, addressed to the author’s relative C. Herennius,
is usually printed among Cicero’s works, and is attributed
to him by the
MSS.
and by Jerome and Priscian. But it
is clearly not by Cicero, for (
a
) it does not agree with his
own description of his early rhetorical writings as ‘incohata
ac rudia’; (
b
) the author’s position, as described by himself,
is not Cicero’s. It is generally held that one Cornificius
was the author; Quintilian (
e.g.
v. 10, 2) attributes to a person
of that name several expressions found in the
ad Herennium
.
He may have been the Q. Cornificius who opposed
Cicero for the consulship in
B.C.
64. The date of the
treatise is probably
B.C.
86-84.

QUINTUS CICERO.

Q. Tullius Cicero, the brother of the orator, was born
probably
B.C.
102. He was aedile in 65 (
ad Att.
i. 4, 1);
praetor in 62, when he tried the case of Archias; propraetor
of Asia 61-58 (
ad Q.F.
i. 1, 2). He acted as

legatus
of Pompey in Sardinia
B.C.
56 (
pro Scauro
, 39); of
Caesar in Gaul, taking part in the second invasion of
Britain (Caes.
B.G.
v.); and of his brother in Cilicia
(
ad Fam.
xv. 4, 8). At the outbreak of the civil war he
was with Marcus at Formiae and Capua; but after the
death of Pompey there was a breach between them. Being
proscribed by the triumvirs he took flight, but was betrayed
by his slaves and put to death,
B.C.
43 (Plut.
Cic.
47).
His wife was Pomponia, the sister of Atticus.

For the benefit of M. Cicero in his candidature for the
consulship,
B.C.
64, Quintus wrote the
Commentariolum
Petitionis
(the title in Â§ 58) or
De Petitione Consulatus
. It
is in the form of a letter, and is headed in the best
MSS.

‘Q. M. Fratri S. D.’ Quintus writes with special reference
to his brother’s circumstances, but most of the rules which
he lays down are of general application. The authenticity
of this treatise has been called in question by Eussner,
who ascribes it to a clever imitator, partly on the ground
of coincidences of expression with Cicero’s speech
in Toga
Candida
; but his arguments are refuted by Prof. Tyrrell
(
Cicero’s Correspondence
, i. pp. 110-121).

There are also extant three letters to Tiro and one to M.
Cicero. Quintus’ poetry is now represented only by twenty
hexameters on the signs of the zodiac; but he wrote an
epic poem,
Annales
(
ad Att.
ii. 16, 4 [Quintus] ‘ita remittit
ut me roget ut annales suos emendem et edam’), and
composed tragedies with great rapidity (
ad Q.F.
iii. 6, 7,
‘quattuor tragoedias xvi. diebus absolvisse cum scribas,
tu quidquam ab alio mutuaris?’). His admiration for
Sophocles and Euripides appears in
De Fin.
v. 3;

ad Fam.
xvi. 8, 2.

TIRO.

M. Tullius Tiro, the freedman of Cicero, who had a
high opinion of his worth and ability (
ad Fam.
xvi. 4, 3;

ad Att.
vii. 5, 2), wrote (1) a biography of his patron:
Ascon. p. 49, ‘ut legimus apud Tironem libertum Ciceronis
in libro iiii. de vita eius.’

(2) Editions of Cicero’s speeches and letters: Gell. i. 7, 1,
‘in oratione Ciceronis v. in Verrem, libro spectatae fidei,
Tironiana cura atque disciplina facto.’ (See also
p. 85
.)

(3) A collection of Cicero’s witticisms: Quint. vi. 3, 5,
‘utinam libertus eius Tiro aut alius, quisquis fuit, qui
iii. hac de re libros edidit, parcius dictorum numero indulsissent.’

(4) Grammatical works, as
ÏÎ±Î½Î´Î­ÎºÏÎ±Î¹
, mentioned by
Gell. xiii. 9, 2.

For his system of shorthand, cf. Sueton. p. 136
R.
,
‘Romae primus Tullius Tiro, Ciceronis libertus, commentatus
est notas, sed tantum praepositionum.’

T. POMPONIUS ATTICUS (
B.C.
109-32).

Author of (1)
Annalis
, a chronological table of the chief
events in Roman and foreign history, accompanied by
genealogies (Nepos,
Att.
18, 1). As it was Cicero’s
De Re
Publica
that suggested its composition (Cic.
Brut.
19), its
date cannot be earlier than
B.C.
54. (2) Family histories,

e.g.
of the Iunii (Nepos,
Att.
18, 3), published separately.
(3)
De Imaginibus
, a collection of inscriptions in verse
for the busts of celebrated men (Nepos,
Att.
18, 5). (4)
De
Consulatu Ciceronis
, in Greek (Nepos,
Att.
18, 6), written

B.C.
60 (Cic.
ad Att.
ii. 1, 1).

Atticus is an interesting figure on account of the large
publishing business which he conducted (Nepos,
Att.
13, 3);
and the great care with which he sought out good
MSS.

to reproduce in his establishment makes him important
in the history of the preservation of ancient literature.

M. TERENTIUS VARRO.

(1) LIFE.

M. Terentius Varro was born
B.C.
116 at Reate in the
Sabine country.

Jerome yr. Abr. 1901, ‘M. Terentius Varro philosophus et
poeta nascitur.’ Symmachus,
Ep.
i. 2, calls him ‘Terentius
Reatinus’; and he owned property in that district:
R.R.
ii.
praef. 6, ‘ipse pecuarias habui grandes, in Apulia oviarias,
et in Reatino equarias.’

Of his family nothing is known except that he had an
uncle belonging to the equestrian order (Plin.
N.H.
vii. 176).
His philosophical education was received at Athens, where
he was a disciple of Antiochus of Ascalon: Cic.
Ac. Post.

12, ‘Aristum Athenis [Brutus] audivit aliquamdiu, cuius tu
[Varro] fratrem Antiochum.’

He took part in the war with Sertorius in Spain,
B.C.
76
(Sall.
Hist.
ii. fr. 69). In the war with the pirates,
B.C.
67,
he was one of Pompeius’ lieutenants, and received a
corona
navalis
for his services. Varro
R.R.
ii. praef. 7, ‘cum
piratico bello inter Delum et Ciliciam Graeciae classibus
praeessem.’ Plin.
N.H.
vii. 115, ‘[Varroni] Magnus Pompeius piratico ex bello navalem [coronam] dedit.’ Probably
he was also with Pompeius in the war with Mithradates
(Plin.
N.H.
xxxiii. 136, xxxvii. 11; knowledge of the Caspian,
vi. 38). To the coalition of Pompeius, Caesar, and Crassus
he was originally hostile, going so far as to write one of his
satires,
Î¤ÏÎ¹Îºá½±ÏÎ±Î½Î¿Ï
, against them (Appian
B.C.
ii. 9); but
in 59 he was a member of the commission appointed to
establish Caesar’s veterans in Campania: Plin.
N.H.
vii. 176,
‘Varro auctor est xx. viro se agros dividente Capuae,’ etc.
He also held the office of tribune (Gell. xiii. 12, 6), and
was aedile with Murena (Plin. xxxv. 173).

When the civil war broke out he was one of Pompeius’
lieutenants in Farther Spain, and resisted Caesar without
success (Caes.
B.C.
ii. 17-20). From Spain he withdrew to
Epirus, where he was coldly received by the Pompeians
(Cic.
ad Fam.
ix. 6, 3, ‘crudeliter otiosis minabantur, eratque
eis et tua invisa voluntas et mea oratio’). We hear of
him at Corcyra (
R.R.
i. 4), and at Dyrrhachium a few
days before the battle of Pharsalus (Cic.
de Div.
i. 68).
After Caesar’s victory he lived quietly at his Tusculan villa
(Cic.
ad Fam.
ix. 6, 4, ‘his tempestatibus es prope solus in
portu ... equidem hos tuos Tusculanenses dies instar esse
vitae puto’). He was more easily reconciled than Cicero
to the new government, and was made librarian by Caesar:
Sueton.
Iul.
44, ‘Destinabat bibliothecas Graecas Latinasque
quas maximas posset publicare, data M. Varroni cura comparandarum
ac digerendarum.’ This, however, did not
prevent him writing a funeral oration on Cato’s sister Porcia
(Cic.
ad Att.
xiii. 48, 2).

After Caesar’s death Varro was exposed to the persecution
of Antonius, whose raid on his villa at Casinum is vividly
described by Cicero (
Phil.
ii. 103
sqq.
). He was proscribed,
but the devotion of his friends secured his escape (Appian

B.C.
iv. 47).

His old age was spent in peace, the literary activity for
which his whole life was remarkable being maintained to the
end. At the age of eighty-three he was still writing: Plin.

N.H.
xxix. 65, ‘Cunctarer in proferendo ex his remedio,
ni M. Varro lxxxiii vitae anno prodidisset,’ etc.

Varro’s death took place in
B.C.
27, in his ninetieth year.
Jerome yr. Abr. 1990, ‘M. Terentius Varro philosophus
prope nonagenarius moritur.’

(2) WORKS.

Cicero (
ad Att.
xiii. 18) calls Varro ‘homo
ÏÎ¿Î»Ï
Î³ÏÎ±Ïá½½ÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Ï
,’
and Varro himself said that he had written four
hundred and ninety Books by the end of his seventy-seventh
year: Gell. iii. 10, 17, ‘Addit se quoque iam duodecimam
annorum hebdomadam ingressum esse et ad eum diem
septuaginta hebdomadas librorum conscripsisse.’ A letter
of Jerome
[30]
gives a list of thirty-nine works in four hundred
and ninety Books, admitting at the same time that these
were only half of the total number (‘vix medium descripsi
indicem’). The titles of twenty-one other works are known
from various sources.

1.
Agriculture.
—Of this enormous number only one has
survived in a complete form, the treatise
De Re Rustica
in
three Books, in the form of a dialogue. Book i. treats of
agriculture; ii. of stock-raising; iii. of poultry, game, and
fish. It was written
B.C.
37-6:
R.R.
i. 1, 1, ‘Annus
octogesimus admonet me ut sarcinas colligam ante quam
proficiscar e vita.’

2.
Grammar.
—Of the twenty-five books
De Lingua
Latina
, only v.-x. have been preserved, but the scope of
the whole is known from Varro’s own words. Book i. was
introductory; ii.-vii. dealt with etymology; viii.-xiii. with
inflexions; xiv.-xxv. with syntax. Varro’s derivations are
ridiculed by Quintilian i. 6, 37, ‘Sed cui non post Varronem
sit venia, qui
agrum
quia in eo
agatur
aliquid, et
graculos

quia
gregatim
volent dictos voluit persuadere Ciceroni?’
From Book v. onwards the work was dedicated to Cicero,
in return for his
Academics
; it is announced in Cic.
Ac.

i. 2, where Varro says, ‘Habeo opus magnum in manibus,
idque iam pridem: ad hunc enim ipsum (me autem dicebat)
quaedam institui, quae et sunt magna sane et limantur a
me politius.’ The date of publication was probably
B.C.

45-3.

Of the minor works on grammar, some at least were prior
to the
De Lingua Latina
: Cic.
Ac.
i. 9, ‘Plurimum poetis
nostris omninoque Latinis et litteris luminis et verbis attulisti.’
The titles known are,
De sermone Latino

De origine
linguae Latinae
,
De similitudine verborum

De utilitate sermonis

De antiquitate litterarum

3.
Roman History and Antiquities.
Varro’s great work
in this department was the
Antiquitates rerum divinarum
humanarumque
, in forty-one Books. The arrangement,
according to Augustine
De Civ. Dei
, vi. 3, was as follows:
(
a
) i.-xxv.
res humanae
; i. introductory, ii.-vii. history of
Rome down to its capture by the Gauls, viii.-xiii. geography
of Italy, xiv.-xix. Roman Calendar, with dates of the chief
historical events, xx.-xxv. Roman institutions, (
b
) xxvi.-xli.

res divinae
; the persons who sacrifice, the places, the times,
the rites, and the gods were discussed in three Books each,
xxvi. being introductory. The second part, at least, was
addressed to Caesar as
pontifex maximus
. As it is mentioned by Cic.
Ac.
i. 9, it must have been published before

B.C.
45.

Minor works under this head were
Annales
,
Res urbanae
,

De gente populi Romani
,
De vita populi Romani
,
De familiis
Troianis
,
Tribuum Liber
;
Aetia
(

Varro gave short accounts in prose and verse of seven
hundred famous Greeks and Romans, with their portraits
(Plin.
N.H.
xxxv. 11), the title being derived from the
arrangement in groups of seven. Aristotle’s
Î á½³ÏÎ»Î¿Ï
had
dealt similarly with the heroes of the Trojan War, and
the ‘
Î ÎµÏÎ»Î¿Î³ÏÎ±Ïá½·Î±
Varronis’ of Cic.
ad Att.
xvi. 11, 3 is
usually identified with the
Hebdomades
.

11.
ÎÎ¿Î³Î¹ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¿á½·
, in seventy-six Books, were probably not
a mixture of fable and history, but essays enlivened by
historical examples. The titles were double, the chief
speaker being named as well as the subject of the essay,

e.g.

Catus de liberis educandis
. To this work Cicero probably
refers,
Ac.
i. 9, ‘Philosophiam multis locis incohasti,
ad impellendum satis, ad edocendum parum.’

12. Varro’s poetical works are now represented only by
fragments of the
Saturae Menippeae
, a medley of prose
and verse in one hundred and fifty books (Cic.
Ac.
i. 9,
‘Varium et elegans omni fere numero poema fecisti’).
They were so called by Varro himself (Gell. ii. 18, 7, ‘In
satiris quas alii Cynicas, ipse appellat Menippeas’), being
founded on the dialogues of Menippus, the Cynic of Gadara,
of the third century
B.C.
Their object was to present philosophy
in a popular dress: Cic.
Ac.
i. 8, ‘Quae cum facilius
minus docti intellegerent, iucunditate quadam ad legendum
invitati.’ From the way in which they are spoken of in the
same passage (‘in illis veteribus nostris’), most of them
must have been among Varro’s earliest writings. The titles
are extremely curious,
e.g.
‘
Îá½¶Ï ÏÎ±á¿Î´ÎµÏ Î¿á¼± Î³á½³ÏÎ¿Î½ÏÎµÏ
,’ ‘Longe
fugit qui suos fugit.’ Quintilian considers Varro as the
founder of a type of satire distinct from that of Lucilius,
Horace, and Persius: x. 1, 95, ‘Alterum illud etiam prius
satirae genus sed non sola carminum varietate mixtum
condidit Terentius Varro, vir Romanorum eruditissimus.’
His other poetical works were ten books of
Poemata
, four
of
Satires
, and six of
Pseudotragoediae
(tragi-comedy).

13.
Oratory.
—Varro left twenty-two Books of
Orationes

and three of
Suasiones
, but he had no fame as an orator:
Quint. x. 1, 95, ‘Plus scientiae collaturus quam eloquentiae.’

14.
Letters.
—Of these there seem to have been two
collections: (
a
)
Epistulae Latinae
, real letters to acquaintances;
(
b
)
Epistolicae Quaestiones
, discussing in epistolary
form points of history, grammar, etc.

The collection of maxims which passes under the name

Sententiae Varronis
is of uncertain authenticity.

LABERIUS.

The date of D. Laberius’ birth is got from Sueton.
Iul.

39, ‘Ludis D. Laberius eques Romanus mimum suum
egit.’ This event took place in
B.C.
45, and in the prologue
to the piece (quoted below), l. 109, Laberius says he is
sixty years old; hence he was born about
B.C.
105. He
died in January,
B.C.
43.

Jerome yr. Abr. 1974 =
B.C.
43, ‘Laberius mimorum
scriptor decimo mense post C. Caesaris interitum Puteolis
moritur.’

In
B.C.
45 Laberius, although an
eques
, was, as a punishment
for his political opinions, compelled by Caesar to
perform in one of his own mimes, and was beaten by
Publilius Syrus.

Macrob.
Saturn.
ii. 7, 2
sqq.
, ‘Laberium asperae libertatis
equitem Romanum Caesar quingentis milibus invitavit, ut
prodiret in scaenam et ipse ageret mimos, quos scriptitabat.
Sed potestas non solum si invitet sed etiam si supplicet
cogit, unde se et Laberius a Caesare coactum in prologo
testatur his versibus:

“Necessitas, cuius cursus transversi impetum

voluerunt multi effugere, pauci potuerunt,

quo me detrusit paene extremis sensibus!

Quem nulla ambitio, nulla umquam largitio,

nullus timor, vis nulla, nulla auctoritas

movere potuit in iuventa de statu:

ecce in senecta ut facile labefecit loco

viri excellentis mente clemente edita

summissa placide blandiloquens oratio!

Etenim ipsi di negare cui nil potuerunt,

hominem me denegare quis posset pati?

Ego bis tricenis annis actis sine nota

eques Romanus e Lare egressus meo

domum revertar mimus,” etc.

In ipsa quoque actione subinde se, qua poterat, ulciscebatur
inducto habitu Syri, qui velut flagris caesus praeripientique
similis exclamabat

“Porro Quirites libertatem perdimus”

et paulo post adiecit

“Necesse est multos timeat quem multi timent.”

Quo dicto universitas populi ad solum Caesarem oculos
et ora convertit, notantes inpotentiam eius hac dicacitate
lapidatam. Ob haec in Publilium vertit favorem ... [Publilius
Syrus] cum mimos componeret ingentique adsensu
in Italiae oppidis agere coepisset, productus Romae per
Caesaris ludos, omnes qui tunc scripta et operas suas in
scaenam locaverant provocavit ut singuli secum posita in
vicem materia pro tempore contenderent. Nec ullo recusante
superavit omnes, in quis et Laberium. Unde Caesar
adridens hoc modo pronuntiavit

“Favente tibi me victus es, Laberi, a Syro”

statimque Publilio palmam et Laberio anulum aureum cum
quingentis sestertiis dedit.’

We have forty-three titles of mimes by Laberius, and
about one hundred and fifty lines of fragments. From
the above we see that Laberius criticized contemporary
society with great vigour. Other features are

(
a
) His invention of words.

Gell. xvi. 7, 1, ‘Laberius in mimis, quos scriptitavit,
oppido quam verba finxit praelicenter.’ Examples are

manuatus est
for
furatus est
;
abluvium
for
diluvium
.

(
b
) His use of plebeian expressions.

Gell. xix. 13, 3, ‘quae a Laberio ignobilia nimis et sordentia
in usum linguae Latinae intromissa sunt.’

(
c
) His references to philosophy.

Cf. l. 17,

‘nec Pythagoream dogmam doctus’;

l. 72,

‘Democritus Abderites physicus philosophus,’ etc.

For views on Laberius cf. Hor.
Sat.
i, 10, 5,

‘Nam sic
et Laberi mimos ut pulchra poemata mirer.’

Cic.
ad Fam.
xii. 18, 2 (written
B.C.
46), ‘Equidem sic
iam obdurui ut ludis Caesaris nostri animo aequissimo
viderem T. Plancum, audirem Laberi et Publili poemata.’

Contemporaries of Laberius were the satirist Abuccius,
and Egnatius, who wrote a didactic poem
de rerum natura
.

M. FURIUS BIBACULUS.

According to Jerome, Bibaculus was born
B.C.
103, but,
as he laughs at the old age of the grammarian Orbilius
(114-c. 17
B.C.
), authorities put the date twenty years later.

Jerome yr. Abr. 1914, ‘M. Furius poeta cognomento
Bibaculus Cremonae nascitur.’

Sueton.
Gramm.
9, ‘[Orbilius] vixit prope ad centesimum
aetatis annum, amissa iam pridem memoria, ut versus
Bibaculi docet,

“Orbilius ubinam est, litterarum oblivio?”’

Bibaculus wrote poems against the monarchical party;
these are referred to as
iambi
by Quintilian, x. 1, 96.

Tac.
Ann.
iv. 34, ‘Carmina Bibaculi et Catulli referta
contumeliis Caesarum leguntur: sed ipse divus Iulius, ipse
divus Augustus et tulere ista et reliquere.’

Two epics,
Aethiopis
and
Bellum Gallicum
(on Iulius
Caesar’s exploits), are probably referred to by Hor.
Sat.
i.
10, 36,

‘Turgidus Alpinus iugulat dum Memnona, dumque

diffingit Rheni luteum caput.’

Acron
ad loc.
, ‘Bibaculum quemdam poetam Gallum
tangit.’

Cf. Hor.
Sat.
ii. 5, 40,

‘Seu pingui tentus omaso

Furius hibernas cana nive conspuet Alpes.’

Acron
ad loc.
, ‘Furius Bibaculus in pragmatia belli
Gallici: Iuppiter hibernas,’ etc.

It is probably from this epic that Macrob.
Saturn.
vi. 1,
31-4, quotes passages imitated by Virgil. So, ‘Furius in
primo annali “Interea Oceani linquens Aurora cubile.”’
(Cf. Virg.
Aen.
iv. 585.)

Bibaculus also wrote a prose work
Lucubrationes
. (Pliny

N.H.
xxiv. praef.)

CAESAR.

(1) LIFE.

The main facts of C. Iulius Caesar’s life are found in a
compendious form in the Life by Suetonius. The ancient
authorities, who are unanimous in stating that at the time of
his death (15th March,
B.C.
44) Caesar was in his fifty-sixth
year (Sueton.
Iul.
88, Appian
B.C.
ii. 149, Plut.
Caes.
69),
must have placed his birth in
B.C.
100. But if this date
were correct Caesar must have held the various magistracies
two years before the legal time—a fact nowhere mentioned,
and in itself improbable; it is therefore natural to hold
that he was born in
B.C.
102 (Mommsen,
R.H.
iv., p. 15,
note). His birthday was 12th July (Macrob.
Saturn.
i,
12, 34).

His father, C. Iulius Caesar, was praetor in
B.C.
84,
and died in the same year; Aurelia, his mother, took
great interest in his education (Tac.
Dial.
28).
From the first Caesar was connected with the leaders
of the democratic party in the State. Marius, who had
married his father’s sister Julia, conferred on him the office
of
flamen Dialis
before he was sixteen years of age; and
his first wife was Cornelia, daughter of Cinna. His refusal
to divorce her at the bidding of Sulla drew down upon
him the enmity of the dictator; and he fled in disguise
to the Sabine mountains, where he remained until Sulla
reluctantly consented to spare his life.

Caesar obtained his first experience of military service
as a member of the staff of M. Thermus, propraetor of
Asia, who conferred on him the
civica corona
for saving
the life of a fellow-soldier at the siege of Mytilene. After
serving for a short time under Servilius Isauricus against
the pirates in Cilicia, he returned to Rome on the news
of Sulla’s death in 78, and in the following year commenced
his career as an orator with the prosecution of Cn. Cornelius
Dolabella, proconsul of Macedonia, for extortion.

Towards the end of that year Caesar left Rome for
Rhodes—on his way thither being captured by pirates near
Miletus—and studied for a year under the famous rhetorician
Molo, taking part also in some operations on the mainland
against one of the officials of Mithradates. Having been
elected one of the
pontifices
in the room of his uncle, C.
Aurelius Cotta, he returned to Rome in 74, and soon
became a
tribunus militum
. In the agitation for the restoration
of the powers of the tribunes of the
plebs
, Caesar
took a prominent part; he also supported the
Lex Aurelia

of 70, which gave the
equites
a share in the
iudicia
, and
the
Lex Plautia
, granting an amnesty to the adherents of
Lepidus and Sertorius.

The year 68 he spent as quaestor in Farther Spain, and
on his return to Rome strenuously advocated the claims
of the Transpadane Gauls to the Roman franchise. His
first wife having died, he married Pompeia, daughter of
Q. Pompeius Rufus, and granddaughter of Sulla, whom
he divorced five years later on account of her alleged
adultery with P. Clodius. In 67 and 66 the bills of
Gabinius and Manilius, conferring extensive military powers
upon Pompey, were supported by Caesar and the other
leading democrats.

Whether Caesar was concerned in the abortive attempt
of Catiline at revolution in 65, is a moot point. He was
now aedile, and acquired great popularity by the splendid
shows which he gave to the people, and by his restoration of
the statue and trophies of Marius. In 64, as president of the

quaestio de sicariis
, he condemned some of the most active
agents in Sulla’s proscriptions. In 63 he supported the

lex agraria
of P. Servilius Rullus, and brought about the
prosecution of C. Rabirius for the murder of the tribune
Saturninus. On the re-enactment of the
Lex Domitia de
sacerdotiis
, Caesar was elected
pontifex maximus
. He was
again suspected, probably with good ground, of complicity
with Catiline’s designs; he certainly proposed in the Senate
that the conspirators should be punished with imprisonment
instead of death. Praetor in 62, he worked in Pompey’s
cause by proposing that the charge of rebuilding the
Capitoline temple should be transferred to him from the
aristocratic champion Catulus, and by supporting the bill
of the tribune Metellus Nepos for electing Pompey consul
in absence. Next year Caesar was propraetor of Farther
Spain, where he conquered the Lusitanians and Gallaecians,
and amassed considerable wealth. His coalition
with Pompey and Crassus procured for him the consulship
of 59, rendered notable by the
Leges Iuliae
; and before
he went out of office his position was secured by the

Lex Vatinia
, conferring on him the government of Cisalpine
Gaul and Illyricum for five years, with the command of
three legions; Transalpine Gaul and another legion were
added by the Senate. The following nine years (58-50)
were occupied with the subjugation of Gaul and the two
invasions of Britain (55 and 54). At the conference at
Luca, in the winter of 57-56, it was agreed that Caesar
should be continued in office for a second period of five
years, and be allowed to increase the number of his legions
to ten. In 50, realizing the danger of his position if he
returned to Rome as a private person, he was anxious
to be a candidate for the consulship
in absentia
; but
Pompey thwarted his plan. Caesar refused to disband
his army at the bidding of the Senate, and crossed the
Rubicon early in 49. Italy soon submitted; he defeated
the Pompeians in Spain, captured Massilia, and secured
Sicily and Sardinia. Landing in Epirus in 48, he was
defeated at Dyrrhachium, and retreated to Thessaly, where
he overthrew Pompey at Pharsalus. Then followed his
victories over the king of Egypt in the Alexandrian war
(48), Pharnaces in Asia Minor (47), the Pompeians and
Juba at Thapsus (46), and C. and Sex. Pompeius at
Munda (45).

He had been created dictator in 49 and 48, with the
tribunician power in perpetuity; and on his return to
Rome in 45 he was made consul for ten years, dictator,
and
praefectus morum
, with the title of
imperator
for life.
In the intervals between his campaigns he carried out
numerous reforms, including the rectification of the calendar,

B.C.
46 (see
p. 110
). His assassination by Brutus and
Cassius and the other conspirators took place on 15th
March,
B.C.
44.

(2) WORKS.

1.
De Bello Gallico
, in seven Books. The title used
by Caesar himself was probably
Commentarii rerum suarum

(as in Cic.
Brut.
262, and Sueton.
Iul.
56; cf. Strabo,
iv. 1, 1
á½ÏÎ¿Î¼Î½Î®Î¼Î±ÏÎ±
), although this does not appear in the
best
MSS.
, which give variously
libri
,
historiae
, or
ephemeris
rerum gestarum belli Gallici
.

The work describes Caesar’s operations in Gaul, Germany,
and Britain during the years
B.C.
58-52, the events
of each year occupying a separate Book. It was written
and published as a whole, not in parts at the end of each
year’s campaign. Otherwise it is difficult to see why Cicero
should not have heard of it from his brother Quintus or
his friend Trebatius, both of whom were with Caesar; or
why Hirtius should have spoken of the rapidity with which
the work was composed (
B.G.
viii. praef. 6, ‘Ceteri quam
bene atque emendate, nos etiam quam facile atque celeriter
eos perfecerit, scimus’). This view is corroborated by the
statement of Asinius Pollio, that there were mistakes in
the work due to defective memory (Sueton.
Iul.
56, ‘quae ...
memoria lapsus perperam ediderit’); and by some expressions
in the earlier Books pointing forward to events mentioned
later (i. 28 compared with vii. 9, and iv. 21 with
vii. 76).

The time of composition was probably the winter after
the last campaign narrated in the Book (
B.C.
52-51). It
was certainly published before
B.C.
46, the date of Cicero’s

Brutus
, and probably before the rupture with Pompey, of
whom Caesar speaks with approbation (vii. 6, ‘Cum iam
ille urbanas res virtute Cn. Pompei commodiorem in
statum pervenisse intellegeret’).

The aim of the book was twofold: (1) to provide
material for professed historians: Hirt.
B.G.
viii. praef. 5,
‘qui sunt editi, ne scientia tantarum rerum scriptoribus
deesset’; (2) to furnish a defence of the author’s own conduct—an object carefully kept in the background. It has
been proved that Caesar suppressed facts which would have
told against him at Rome (
e.g.
his rapacity, Sueton.
Iul.
54),
and the plausible motives which he assigns for some of
his actions cannot be accepted as genuine. Cf. the criticism
of Asinius Pollio, Sueton.
Iul.
56, ‘Pollio Asinius
parum diligenter parumque integra veritate compositos
putat, cum Caesar pleraque et quae per alios erant gesta
temere crediderit, et quae per se vel consulto vel etiam
memoria lapsus perperam ediderit, existimatque rescripturum
et correcturum fuisse.’ The style is remarkable
for its brevity, directness, and the absence of ornament
and emotion (Cic.
Brut.
262, ‘Nudi sunt, recti et venusti,
omni ornatu orationis, tamquam veste, detracto’).

Among the materials used by Caesar in writing the

Commentarii
were his own despatches to the Senate (ii. 35,
iv. 38, vii. 90) and the reports of his
legati
. Late writers
speak of his
á¼ÏÎ·Î¼ÎµÏá½·Î´ÎµÏ
(
e.g.
Plut.
Caes.
22), but there is
no ground for supposing that he kept a regular diary.
He depended to a great extent on his own memory (cf.
Pollio’s criticism, above).

2.
De Bello Civili
, in three Books, similar in plan to
the
Bell. Gall.
Book iii. ends abruptly with an event
of no great importance, and, as the death of Pompey
would have formed a natural ending, we must suppose
that Caesar had intended to continue the narrative with
the Alexandrian, Spanish, and African wars, but was prevented
from carrying out his plan. The work was published
after his death, without undergoing revision (Sueton.

Iul.
56, ‘Pollio existimat rescripturum et correcturum
fuisse’).

Other works in the Corpus Caesarianum
.—Sueton.
Iul.

56 says, ‘Alexandrini Africique et Hispaniensis [belli]
incertus auctor est. Alii Oppium putant, alii Hirtium,
qui etiam Gallici belli novissimum imperfectumque librum
suppleverit.’

Suetonius evidently believed that Hirtius was the author
of
B.G.
viii., for he introduces a quotation from the preface
to that Book with the words, ‘Hirtius ita praedicat’ (
ibid.
).
Hirtius is also mentioned in the
MSS.
as the author of

B.G.
viii., and there is no reason to doubt that this is
the case. That he is the author of any of the others is
rendered doubtful by the fact that his bad health (which
lasted to November,
B.C.
44) and his position as consul
would leave him little time for literature between the death
of Caesar (15th March,
B.C.
44) and his own death at
Mutina (27th April,
B.C.
43). Hirtius was thus able to
carry out only the first part of the plan sketched in
B.G.

viii. praef. 2, ‘Caesaris nostri commentarios rerum gestarum,
non cohaerentibus superioribus atque insequentibus
eius scriptis, contexui, novissimumque imperfectum ab
rebus gestis Alexandriae confeci usque ad exitum non
quidem civilis dissensionis, cuius finem nullum videmus,
sed vitae Caesaris.’

G. Landgraf,
Untersuchungen zu Caesar und seinen
Fortsetzern
(Erlangen, 1888), arrives at the following conclusions:

1. In the
Bellum Africum
we possess the notes of
Asinius Pollio, who took part in the war. That the
work partook of the nature of a journal is shown by the
style;
e.g.

interim
is used about eighty times as a connecting
link, and dates and hours of the day are given
carefully. Landgraf supports his position by instancing
similarities of expression in the
Bell. Afr.
and in three
letters from Pollio to Cicero (
ad Fam.
x. 31; 32; 33).

2. Ch. 48-64 of the
Bell. Alex.
on events in Spain in

B.C.
48-7 were sent to Hirtius by Pollio, who was governor
of Hispania Ulterior in
B.C.
45, and as such was best
acquainted with these incidents.

3. On the death of Hirtius, Pollio, on searching for
his own papers (which he had lent Hirtius to help him
in his work), found Hirtius’
Bell. Gall.
viii., and made
some additions.

4. The
Bell. Civ.
was in Hirtius’ possession unedited
at his death. Hirtius evidently intended to publish it
along with
B.G.
viii. The third Book had been left
unfinished by Caesar, whose notes, some of which were
very brief, Hirtius had extended, and filled up the gaps
in the narrative. There were also some notes on the

Bell. Alex.
The
Bell. Alex.
in the narrower sense (cc.
1-33) Hirtius began with, and in the early chapters contented
himself with making small additions. In the later
parts are found considerable additions both by Hirtius
and by Pollio. Landgraf attempts to distinguish the work
of the two: cc. 34-41, on the Bellum Ponticum, being
mostly by Pollio, and cc. 65-76, on the wars in Illyria
and against Pharnaces, mostly by Hirtius.

5. The authorship of the
Bellum Hispaniense
, which in
style is far below the
Bellum Africum
, Landgraf leaves
an open question.

E. WÃ¶lfflin (
Sitzungsberichte der k. b. Akad. der Wissenschaften zu MÃ¼nchen
, 1889, pp. 323
sqq.
, and ed. of the

Bell. Afr.
, 1889) holds the same views as Landgraf, and
gives many instances of difference in diction between
Bell.
Afr.
on the one hand, and
Gall.
viii. and
Alex.
on the
other;
e.g.

Bell. Afr.     Bell. Gall.
viii.;
Bell. Alex.

suppetiae
,      -   7 times    -   never.

convallis
,      -   5   "      -
vallis
, 10 times.

convulnero
,     -   9   "      -
vulnero
(as in Caesar).

contendo
+ infin., 20   "      -   never.

adorior
,        -  14   "      -   only in
Gall.
viii. 34.

adgredior
,      -  never       -   14 times.

grandis
,        -   7 times    -
magnus
.

subito
,         -  22   "      -   never.

repente
,        -  never       -   16 times.

postquam
,       -  34   "      -   not in
Gall.
viii.
hist. infin.,   -  24   "      -   never.

On the other hand, Widmann,
Philologus
, L. (1891),
p. 565, proves that the author of the note-book worked
up in the
Bell. Afr.
was an officer of the 5th legion,
that Pollio was not connected with the 5th legion, and
probably did not go through the whole African war, as
the author clearly must have done. This, of course, also
proves that Hirtius cannot have been the author.

On the whole, we think it proved that the
Bell. Afr.

was not written by the author of
B. Gall.
viii. and
B. Alex.
,
and that the author was not in any case Pollio. The

B. Alex.
is probably worked up from note-books written
by several hands. The attempt to distinguish the work
of Hirtius and another hand in
B. Gall.
viii. is against
the evidence of Suetonius; and though several hands have
co-operated in
B. Alex.
, it is hardly possible to distinguish
them precisely.

The
Bell. Hisp.
is evidently the work of an eye-witness,
cf. c. 29, ‘nostri ad dimicandum procedunt, id quod
adversarios existimabamus esse facturos.’ He is apt to
be bombastic (c. 5, ‘hic alternis non solum morti mortem
exaggerabant, sed tumulos tumulis exaequabant’), and
makes a ridiculous show of learning (quoting the combat
of Achilles and Memnon, c. 25, and Ennius, c. 23,
‘nostri cessere parumper’; c. 31, ‘pes pede premitur,
armis teruntur arma.’)

(3) CAESAR’S LOST WORKS.

1.
De Analogia
, a treatise on grammar in two Books,
dedicated to Cicero (Cic.
Brut.
253) and composed in
the interval between two of the campaigns in Gaul.
Sueton.
Iul.
56, ‘Reliquit et de Analogia duos libros ...
In transitu Alpium, cum ex citeriore Gallia conventibus
peractis ad exercitum rediret ... fecit.’ It supported the
view that
analogia
, not
anomalia
, should be the governing
principle in grammar,
i.e.
that order should be introduced
into the chaos of varying usages. Gellius i. 10, 4 has a
notable quotation from the first Book, ‘Habe semper in
memoria atque in pectore, ut tamquam scopulum sic fugias
inauditum atque insolens verbum.’

2.
De Astris
, a book on astronomy, written apparently
in connexion with the rectification of the calendar,
B.C.
46,
perhaps in Greek. Suetonius says nothing about it, but
it was known to Macrobius,
Saturn.
, i. 16, 39, ‘Iulius
Caesar ... siderum motus, de quibus non indoctos libros
reliquit, ab Aegyptiis disciplinis hausit.’ The
liber de computatione

and
liber fastorum
, attributed to Caesar by the
Scholiast on Lucan, x. 185, 187, may have formed part
of the
De Astris
.

3.
Anticatones
, written
B.C.
45, in reply to Cicero’s panegyric
on Cato, with flattering references to Cicero himself.
Sueton.
Iul.
56, ‘Reliquit et de Analogia duos libros et
Anticatones totidem. ... Sub tempus Mundensis proelii
fecit.’ Cicero expresses himself as highly pleased with
the book,
ad Att.
xiii. 51, ‘bene existimo de illis libris,
ut tibi coram’; but his tone is different in
Topica
, 94,
‘quibus omnibus generibus usus est nimis impudenter
Caesar contra Catonem meum.’

4.
Apophthegmata
, a collection of notable sayings, probably
growing out of the
Dicta Collectanea
of Sueton.

Iul.
56, and completed
B.C.
46-5. Cic.
ad Fam.
ix. 16, 4,
‘audio Caesarem, cum volumina iam confecerit
á¼ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¸ÎµÎ³Î¼Î¬ÏÏÎ½
,
si quod afferatur ad eum pro meo, quod meum non
sit, reicere solere.’

5.
Letters.
—In the time of Suetonius, Caesar’s official
despatches to the Senate were extant, and also private
letters to Cicero and other friends,
e.g.
his confidants
Balbus and Oppius. In these a cypher was, where
necessary, employed. Cf. Sueton.
Iul.
56, and Gell.
xvii. 9, 1.

6.
Speeches.
—About a dozen titles of speeches are known,
but only a few detached words and phrases survive. As
an orator, Caesar stood in the front rank (Sueton.
Iul.
55).
For encomiums on his style see Cic.
Brut.
252, and
Quintilian, x. 1, 114, who considered him second only to
Cicero, and remarkable for
vis
,
acumen
,
concitatio
, and

elegantia
. The language of Tac.
Dial.
21 is less complimentary,
‘Nisi forte quisquam aut Caesaris pro Decio
Samnite aut Bruti pro Deiotaro rege ceterosque eiusdem
lentitudinis ac teporis libros legit, nisi qui et carmina
eorumdem miratur.’

7.
Poems.
—Caesar in his youth composed a poem in
praise of Hercules, and a tragedy,
Oedipus
. Plutarch
(
Caes.
2) speaks of him as reciting poems of his own
composition to the pirates who took him prisoner. On
his journey from Rome to Spain,
B.C.
46, he wrote a
descriptive poem with the title of
Iter
.

Sueton.
Iul.
56, ‘Reliquit ... poema quod inscribitur
Iter ... [fecit] dum ab urbe in Hispaniam ulteriorem quarto
et vicensimo die pervenit ... Feruntur et a puero et ab
adulescentulo quaedam scripta, ut Laudes Herculis, tragoedia
Oedipus, item Dicta Collectanea: quos omnes
libellos vetuit Augustus publicari, in epistula quam brevem
admodum ac simplicem ad Pompeium Macrum, cui ordinandas
bibliothecas delegaverat, misit.’

Pliny the younger mentions Caesar as a love poet (
Ep.

v. 3, 5). His poetry is spoken of by Tacitus in no
flattering terms,
Dial.
21, ‘fecerunt enim [Caesar et Brutus]
et carmina et in bibliothecas rettulerunt, non melius quam
Cicero, sed felicius, quia illos fecisse pauciores sciunt.’

The only extant lines are those on Terence (
q.v.
).

C. ASINIUS POLLIO.

C. Asinius Pollio (
B.C.
76-
A.D.
5), governor of Farther
Spain
B.C.
44, consul
B.C.
40, retired from public life after his
Dalmatian triumph,
B.C.
39. He was famous as an orator,
and was the author of (1) A history of the civil wars from

B.C.
60 (Hor.
Od.
ii. 1, 1
sqq.
). (2) Tragedies (Verg.

Ecl.
8, 10; Hor.
Sat.
i. 10, 42;
Od.
ii. 1, 9
sqq.
) and
love poems (Plin.
Ep.
v. 3, 5). (3) A work in which
the style of Sallust was criticized (Sueton.
Gramm.
10).
His remarks on Caesar, Cicero, and Livy may be from
the same book (Sueton.
Iul.
56; Quint. xii. 1, 22; i. 5, 56).

For Pollio’s style, cf. Quint. x. 1, 113, ‘A nitore et iucunditate
Ciceronis ita longe abest ut videri possit saeculo
prior.’ Pollio founded the first public library at Rome, in
the
Atrium Libertatis
,
B.C.
38 (Plin.
N.H.
xxxv. 10), For
his intimacy with the poet Cinna, who wrote the
Propempticon
Pollionis
in his honour, see
p. 142
; and for his
patronage of Virgil and Horace, see Verg.
Ecl.
3, 84;
8, 6-13; Hor.
Sat.
i. 10, 42. Pollio, of course, belongs
to the Augustan Age, but is mentioned here because of
his connexion with the
Corpus Caesarianum
.

CORNELIUS NEPOS.

(1) LIFE.

The praenomen of Cornelius Nepos is unknown. In
Pliny,
N.H.
iii. 127, he is called ‘Padi adcola,’ and in
Pliny,
Ep.
iv. 28, 1 (to Vibius Severus), he is mentioned as
a townsman of T. Catius, ‘Imagines municipum tuorum,
Cornelii Nepotis et T. Cati.’ Now T. Catius was an Insubrian
(Cic.
ad Fam.
xv. 16, 1), and as the only Insubrian
town on the Padus was Ticinum, Nepos was probably born
there.

There is no direct evidence as to the date of his birth
but we may infer from the following facts that he was
born not long before
B.C.
100.

1. Jerome puts his literary activity under
B.C.
40 = yr.
Abr. 1977, ‘Cornelius Nepos scriptor historicus clarus
habetur.’

2. A son of his died
B.C.
44 while a boy, and unknown
to Cicero.

Cic.
ad Att.
xvi. 14, 4, ‘Male narras de Nepotis filio:
valde mehercule moveor et moleste fero; nescieram omnino
esse istum puerum.’

3. The respect with which he looks up to Atticus, who
was born
B.C.
109.

4. A fragment of his
Exempla
quoted by Pliny,
N.H.

ix. 136, regarding the changes of fashion in purple robes:
‘Nepos Cornelius, qui divi Augusti principatu obiit, “Me,”
inquit, “iuvene violacea purpura vigebat, ... nec multo
post rubra Tarentina. Huic successit dibapha Tyria... Hac
P. Lentulus Spinther aedilis curulis (
B.C.
63) primus in
praetexta usus improbabatur. Qua purpura quis non iam,”
inquit, “triclinaria facit?”’

Nepos held no public office, but confined himself to
literature, in which he was associated with Atticus. Their
intimacy must have begun after
B.C.
65, when Atticus
returned to Rome from Athens, where he had lived more
than twenty years.

Pliny,
Ep.
v. 3, 6, ‘P. Vergilius, Cornelius Nepos ... Non
quidem hi senatores.’

Nep.
Att.
13, 7, ‘Atque hoc non auditum, sed cognitum
praedicamus: saepe enim propter familiaritatem domesticis
rebus interfuimus.’

Nepos knew Cicero, doubtless, through Atticus, but there
is no evidence that they were intimate, except Gell. xv. 28, 1,
who is probably mistaken, ‘Cornelius Nepos ... M. Ciceronis
ut qui maxime amicus familiaris fuit.’ A fragment
of a letter from Cicero to Nepos is quoted by Sueton.

Iul.
55; from Nepos to Cicero by Lactant.
inst. div.

iii. 15, 10; and Fronto (p. 20, ed. Naber) speaks of a
collection of Cicero’s works revised by Nepos and Atticus.

Nepos was on intimate terms with Catullus, whom, as
coming from Verona, he may have known in early life.
Catullus, who is mentioned by Nepos (
Att.
12, 4), dedicated
a collection of poems to him (Catull. 1). Nepos was alive
in
B.C.
29, in which, or the following year, he completed the
life of Atticus.

As regards Nepos’ character and views, Pliny,
Ep.
v. 3, 6,
attributes to him
sanctitas morum
. The words of Cicero,

ad Att.
xvi. 5, 5, imply only a playful compliment, ‘Et
ais, “
Î¼ÎµÏ’ á¼Î¼ÏÎ¼Î¿Î½Î±
.” Tu vero
á¼Î¼ÏÎ¼ÏÎ½
, ille [Nepos] quidem

á¼Î¼Î²ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¿Ï
.’

Nepos’ slight regard for philosophy is shown by a letter
to Cicero quoted by Lactant.
inst. div.
iii. 15, 10, ‘Tantum
abest, ut ego magistram esse putem vitae philosophiam
beataeque vitae perfectricem, ut nullis magis existimem
opus esse magistris vivendi quam plerisque, qui in ea
disputanda versantur.’

Cf. also Cic.
ad Att.
xvi. 5, 5, ‘Nepotis epistulam
exspecto. Cupidus ille meorum? qui ea, quibus maxime

Î³Î±Ï
ÏÎ¹á¿¶
, legenda non putet.’

Philosophy, according to Nepos, ought to be practical.

Nep.
Att.
17, 3, ‘Nam principum philosophorum ita
percepta habuit praecepta, ut his ad vitam agendam, non
ad ostentationem uteretur.’

Nepos, as is shown by his works, supported government
by the Senate.

(2) WORKS.

1. Erotic poems; mentioned by Pliny,
Ep.
v. 3, 6.

2.
Chronica
, in three books, embracing universal history.
Catull. 1,

‘Quoi dono lepidum novom libellum

arida modo pumice expolitum?

Corneli, tibi; namque tu solebas

meas esse aliquid putare nugas

iam tum, cum ausus es unus Italorum

omne aevom tribus explicare chartis,

doctis, Iuppiter, et laboriosis.’

It is clear, from the above, that Nepos had mentioned
Catullus in the work. That the mythical period was treated
of is shown by Ausonius,
Ep.
16, ‘Apologos Titiani et
Nepotis chronica quasi alios apologos (nam et ipsa instar
sunt fabularum) ... misi ... ad institutionem tuorum.’

From Catullus we may possibly infer that the
Chronica

were written before
B.C.
63
[31]
;
unus Italorum
would imply
that they were written before the similar works of Varro
and Atticus.

3.
Exempla
, in at least five Books, treating of the history
of Roman manners.

Gell. vi. 18, 11, ‘Cornelius Nepos in libro exemplorum
quinto.’

4.
Life of the elder Cato.

Nep.
Cat.
3, 5, ‘Huius de vita et moribus plura in eo
libro persecuti sumus, quem separatim de eo fecimus rogatu
T. Pomponii Attici. Quare studiosos Catonis ad illud
volumen delegamus.’

5.
Life of Cicero
, written after his death (
B.C.
43).
Gell. xv. 28, 2, ‘in primo librorum, quos de vita illius
composuit.’

6.
A geographical work
, referred to by Pliny,
N.H.
v. 4,
etc. All the above works are lost.

7.
De Viris Illustribus
, his last work, was dedicated to
Atticus (praef. i); an addition to the life of Atticus was
made after his death.

Att.
19, 1, ‘Hactenus Attico vivo edita a nobis sunt.
Nunc, quoniam fortuna nos superstites ei esse voluit,
reliqua persequemur.’

From
Att.
12, 1-2, we may conclude that the publication
took place between
B.C.
35 and 33. The addition to the
life of Atticus was written at some time between
B.C.
31
and 27, as in
Att.
19, 2, Octavian is called
imperator
,
but not
Augustus
, a title which he received in the last-mentioned
year.

The work contained at least sixteen Books: cf. Charis.

G.L.
i. 141 (ed. Keil), ‘Cornelius Nepos illustrium virorum
libro xvi.’; and was divided into sections of two Books each,
the first on distinguished foreigners, the second on distinguished
Romans of the same class. We possess the book

de excellentibus ducibus exterarum gentium
; from
de historicis
Latinis
the lives of Cato the Censor and Atticus, and fragments
of the letters of Cornelia, mother of the Gracci.
There are also mentioned the books
de regibus
(Nep.
de reg.

1, 1; 3, 5);
de excellentibus ducibus Romanorum
(Nep.
Hann.

13, 4);
de historicis Graecis
(Nep.
Dion,
3, 2);
de poetis

(Sueton. p. 31
R.
);
de grammaticis
(Sueton. p. 103
R.
). The
work probably dealt also with
iurisconsulti
,
oratores
, and

philosophi
. The book is biographical rather than historical,
and is designed to compare foreigners with Romans, and to
please, as well as instruct, those ignorant of Greek culture.

Pel.
1, 1, ‘Vereor ... ne non vitam eius enarrare, sed
historiam videar scribere.’

Hann.
13, 4, ‘Tempus est ... Romanorum explicare imperatores,
quo facilius collatis utrorumque factis, qui viri
praeferendi sint, possit iudicari.’

Pel.
1, 1, ‘Medebor cum satietati tum ignorantiae lectorum.’

Praef.
2, ‘Hi erunt fere, qui expertes litterarum Graecarum,’
etc.

Besides tradition and his own recollection, Nepos mentions
the following sources: Thucydides (
Them.
1, 4, etc.);
Xenophon (
Ag.
1, 1); Plato’s
Symposium
(
Alc.
2, 2);
Theopompus (
Alc.
11, 1); Dinon (
Con.
5, 4); Timaeus
(
Alc.
11, 1); Silenus, Sosilus, Polybius, Sulpicius Blitho,
Atticus (
Hann.
13, 1 and 3); the writings of Hannibal
(
Hann.
13, 2); Speeches and
Origines
of Cato (
Cat.
3, 2);
Cicero’s works, especially
Epp. ad Att.
(
Att.
16, 3). The
book contains lives of twenty Greek generals from the
Persian wars to the time of Alexander’s successors; a short
article on Persian and Macedonian kings who were also
generals; and the lives of Hamilcar and Hannibal, Cato
and Atticus. The work possesses little independent value,
and the following are the chief faults:

1. There are many mistakes in history and geography.

2. The biographies, and the events recorded in them,
are badly arranged; eulogy is employed indiscriminately,
and petty anecdotes are too frequent.

3. Important names, as Cimon and Lysander, are dismissed
too briefly; others, as Atticus and Datames, are
treated too fully. Many are left out altogether, as some
of the leaders in the Peloponnesian war.

4. Important authorities are not used: so Herodotus,
for Miltiades, Themistocles, and Pausanias. No use is
made of the
Hellenica
of Xenophon.

For views on Nepos, cf. Gell. xv. 28, 1, ‘Cornelius
Nepos rerum memoriae non indiligens.’

Pliny,
N.H.
v. 4, ‘Portentosa Graeciae mendacia ... quaeque alia Cornelius Nepos avidissime credidit.’

Nepos is not mentioned by Quintilian in his list of
Roman historians.

In the
MSS.
only the
Atticus
and the
Cato
are ascribed to
Nepos, the rest being entitled
Liber Aemilii Probi de
excellentibus ducibus exterarum gentium
. It has been suggested
that this arose from a misapprehension of
em
(
endavi
)

Probus
. There is an epigram by this Probus in the
MSS.
,
referring to poems of his and standing after the Life of
Hannibal, which informs us that he was a contemporary
of Theodosius (probably Theodosius I.,
A.D.
379-395).
That the work cannot be by him is shown by the political
references, which suit only the beginning of the empire,
by the mention of Atticus in the preface, and by the
correspondence in style between the book and the lives
of Atticus and Cato, admittedly the work of Nepos; also
by the fact that L. Ampelius, who probably wrote before
the time of Diocletian, used the work in his
Liber Memorialis
.

LUCRETIUS.

Our information about Lucretius’ life is very scanty.
Jerome yr. Abr. 1922 =
B.C.
95, ‘T. Lucretius poeta
nascitur, qui postea amatorio poculo in furorem versus,
cum aliquot libros per intervalla insaniae conscripsisset,
quos postea Cicero emendavit, propria se manu interfecit
anno aetatis xliiii.’ (
B.C.
52 or 51).

Donatus,
vit. Verg.
2, ‘Initia aetatis Cremonae egit
[Vergilius] usque ad virilem togam, quam xv. anno natali
suo accepit isdem illis consulibus iterum duobus quibus
erat natus, evenitque ut eo ipso die Lucretius poeta
decederet’ (October 15).

Teuffel thinks xliiii. is wrong, and would read xlii., thus
giving the dates as
B.C.
96-55, as he thinks that Jerome
has fixed the date of birth one year too late. Munro (vol.
ii. p. 1) accepts xliiii., but thinks that Jerome (as elsewhere)
is a few years wrong in the date of Lucretius’
birth, and gives the dates as
B.C.
99-55. It is impossible
to decide as to the date of birth, but most authorities agree
on
B.C.
55 as the date of death, a view which is supported
by the only contemporary reference to the poet: Cic.
ad
Q.F.
ii. 11, 4 (written in February,
B.C.
54), ‘Lucreti
poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt: multis luminibus ingeni,
multae tamen artis; sed cum veneris. Virum te putabo,
si Sallusti Empedoclea legeris, hominem non putabo.’

The above extract is given in the reading of the
MSS.

Some editors read
non
before
multis
, others
non
before

multae
, but it is best to follow the
MSS.
(with Tyrrell),
translating “But when you come (we shall talk about it).
I shall consider you a hero, if you read Sallust’s
Empedoclea
;
I shall not consider you a human being.”

As regards Lucretius’ madness, there is no absolute
impossibility in the story. Munro (vol. ii. pp. 2, 3)
accepts Jerome’s account of Cicero’s editorship; others,
less probably, believe that Q. Cicero was editor. The first
view is rendered probable by the high opinion Lucretius
had of Cicero, as seen from the frequency with which he
imitates his
Aratea
(Munro on Lucr. v. 619), and from
the knowledge Cicero shows of Lucretius’ work, as in

Tusc.
i. 48.

The poet’s full name is given in the
MSS.
as T. Lucretius
Carus.

This is all the direct evidence regarding Lucretius’
life.
[32]
The
de rerum natura
is addressed to C. Memmius.
[33]

From Cic.
ad Fam.
xiii. 1 (where Cicero tells us he
employed his good offices with Memmius on behalf of
Patro for the preservation of the gardens of Epicurus), it
appears that he was not an Epicurean. Memmius is the
only contemporary mentioned by Lucretius; i. 24,

‘Te sociam studeo scribendis versibus esse

quos ego de rerum natura pangere conor

Memmiadae nostro, quem tu, dea, tempore in omni

omnibus ornatum voluisti excellere rebus.’

Many, arguing from the fact that Carus is not known
elsewhere as a cognomen of the gens Lucretia, think that
the poet was a freedman or a freedman’s son, but from
the tone of equality in which he addresses Memmius, it
is more probable that he was a patrician; cf. i. 140,

‘Sed tua me virtus tamen et sperata voluptas

suavis amicitiae quemvis sufferre laborem

suadet.’

Several personal characteristics may be inferred from the
poem:

1. His earnestness and sincerity; iii. 28,

‘His ibi me rebus quaedam divina voluptas

percipit atque horror,’ etc.

Cf. the importance he attaches to his subject, i. 926,

‘Avia Pieridum peragro loca nullius ante

trita solo.’

2. His admiration for the great men of the past. Cf.
iii. 1024-52, where Ancus, the Scipios, Homer, Democritus,
and Epicurus are praised; the introductions to Books i.,
iii., v., vi., on Epicurus; i. 716-33 on Empedocles; i. 117-9
on Ennius.

3. His powers of observation and love of nature. Cf.
i. 716-25; ii. 29
sqq.
, 40
sqq.
; 323-32; iv. 572
sqq.

4. His experience of women. Book iv. 1037-the end.

5. His wide reading. The poem shows knowledge of
Epicurus, Empedocles, Democritus, Anaxagoras, Heraclitus,
Plato, the Stoic writers, Thucydides, Hippocrates, Homer,
Euripides. Among Latin writers Ennius, Naevius, Pacuvius,
Lucilius, and Accius are all imitated.

There is a reference to contemporary history in i. 41-3,

‘Nam neque nos agere hoc patriai tempore iniquo

possumus aequo animo nec Memmi clara propago

talibus in rebus communi desse saluti.’

Munro thinks that these lines were written
B.C.
59, when
Memmius was
praetor designatus
, in fierce opposition to
Caesar, and on the side of the Senate. If this is so, the
poem was probably written between
B.C.
60 and 55. The
lines on ambition and its attendant evils (as iii. 931
sqq.
,
v. 1117-35, etc.) may have been written with a special
view to the facts of Memmius’ life. Lucretius may refer
to his recollection of the civil wars in v. 999,

‘At non multa virum sub signis milia ducta

una dies dabat exitio.’

In ii. 40
sqq.
there is perhaps a reference to Caesar’s
army in the Campus Martius at the beginning of
B.C.
58.

The
de rerum natura
is an exposition of Epicureanism,
especially on its physical side; i. 54,

‘Nam tibi de summa caeli ratione deumque

disserere incipiam et rerum primordia pandam,’ etc.

The title is taken from Epicurus’
ÏÎµÏá½¶ ÏÏÏÎµÏÏ
, which
Lucretius followed closely, as is evident from the account
of the Epicurean philosophy in Diogenes Laertius, x., and
from the fragments of Epicurean writers discovered at
Herculaneum in 1752. He probably used as his model
Empedocles’ poem
ÏÎµÏá½¶ ÏÏÏÎµÏÏ
.

The object of the poem is to deliver men from the fear
of death and of the gods; iii. 37,

‘Et metus ille foras praeceps Acheruntis agendus’;

i. 62-101; cf. l. 101,

‘Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.’

Note that the invocation to Venus at the beginning of
the poem is not inconsistent, but is an address to the
universal principle of generation; cf. i. 21,

‘Quae quoniam rerum naturam sola gubernas.’

The scope of the Books is as follows: Books i. and ii.
state the physical theories of Democritus and Epicurus.
Book i. states the Atomic Theory of Democritus, held
by Epicurus, that the world consists of atoms and void.
The theories of Heraclitus, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, etc.
are refuted; i. 740,

‘Principiis tamen in rerum fecere ruinas

et graviter magni magno cecidere ibi casu.’

Book ii. treats of the combinations of atoms, and the
principle of the swerve introduced to explain free-will. The
varieties of atoms are shown to be limited. In Book iii.
the nature of the mind and life is shown to be material.

Religio
and the fear of death (cf. ll. 978
sqq.
) are attacked
principally in this Book; iii. 830,

‘Nil igitur mors est ad nos neque pertinet hilum,

quandoquidem natura animi mortalis habetur.’

Book iv. treats of the theory of
simulacra
or images, of
the senses, and particularly of love. Book v. treats of the
formation of the earth and the heavenly bodies, the origin
of life, and the progress of civilization. It is shown that
nothing has been created, and that everything must perish.
Book vi. treats of abnormal phenomena, such as thunder
and lightning, tempests, volcanoes, earthquakes, etc. The
plague at Athens is described (from Thucydides). Books
v. and vi. are unfinished.

Ethical views are given only by the way, the poem being
primarily on physics. Pleasure is the end of action: ii.
172, ‘dux vitae dia voluptas.’ This pleasure is the absence
of disturbance (
á¼ÏÎ±ÏÎ±Î¾Î¯Î±
), hence all passion (as of love,
iv. 1121-40) is deprecated; ii. 14,

‘O miseras hominum mentes, o pectora caeca!

qualibus in tenebris vitae quantisque periclis

degitur hoc aevi quodcumque est! nonne videre

nil aliud sibi naturam latrare, nisi utqui

corpore seiunctus dolor absit, mente fruatur

iucundo sensu cura semota metuque?’

Lucretius, as Epicurus, is often weak in physics. Cf.
v. 564
sqq.
, of the sun’s size,

‘Nec nimio solis maior rota nec minor ardor

esse potest, nostris quam sensibus esse videtur.’

In i. 1052
sqq.
he states well the theory of the antipodes
but his dependence on Epicurus will not allow him to
accept it. Reasons are sometimes given for a thing that
never existed, as in iv. 710-21 for the fear that a lion has
for a cock. Some passages come near the results of modern
science, cf. v. 837
sqq.
on extinct species; v. 855
sqq.
on
the struggle for existence; v. 610-3, on the invisible rays
of the sun.

The references to Lucretius by name are few.

Nep.
Att.
12, 4, ‘L. Iulium Calidum, quem post Lucreti
Catullique mortem multo elegantissimum poetam nostram
tulisse aetatem vere videor posse contendere.’

Ovid,
Am.
i. 15, 23,

in sua quisque materia, sed alter humilis alter difficilis.’

Cf. Tac.
Dial.
23.

His influence on Virgil is seen
passim
. Cf. Gell. i. 21, 7,
‘Non verba sola sed versus prope totos et locos quoque
Lucreti plurimos sectatum esse Vergilium videmus.’

= Lucr. v. 82

Most of the poets after him,
particularly Manilius, came under his influence.

SALLUST.

(1) LIFE.

C. Sallustius Crispus was born
B.C.
86 at Amiternum,
in the country of the Sabines, and died
B.C.
35.

Jerome yr. Abr. 1931 =
B.C.
86, ‘Sallustius Crispus,
scriptor historicus, in Sabinis Amiterni nascitur.’
Ibid.

1982 =
B.C.
35, ‘Sallustius diem obiit, quadriennio ante
Actiacum bellum.’

Sallust was of plebeian family, as is seen from the fact
that he was afterwards
tribunus plebis
. According to the
Pseud.-Cic.
in Sallustium declamatio
, 13-14, he led an
evil life in youth, and brought his father with sorrow to
the grave.

Cf. Â§ 14, ‘Cuiquam dubium potest esse, quin mori
coegerit eum [patrem]?’

There is a story that Milo punished him for an amour
with his wife.

Gell. xvii. 18, ‘M. Varro ... in libro quem scripsit “Pius
aut de pace,” C. Sallustium scriptorem seriae illius et
severae orationis, in cuius historia notiones censorias fieri
atque exerceri videmus, in adulterio deprehensum ab Annio
Milone loris bene caesum dicit et, cum dedisset pecuniam,
dimissum.’

The story is corroborated by Pseud.-Cic.
in Sall.
15;
by Macrob. iii. 13, 9, ‘
alienae
luxuriae obiurgator et
censor,’ and others; and Sallust himself appears to admit
that there was something wrong;
Cat.
4, ‘a quo incepto
studioque me ambitio mala detinuerat.’
[34]

Sallust speaks of the political offices he filled, and of
the class of men who were unsuccessful candidates about
the same time—a supposed reference to M. Cato’s candidature
for the praetorship,
B.C.
55.

Iug.
4, ‘Qui si reputaverint, et quibus ego temporibus
magistratus adeptus sim et quales viri idem adsequi
nequiverint,’ etc.

After being quaestor (Pseud.-Cic.
in Sall.
15), he was,
in
B.C.
52,
tribunus plebis
, when he and other two tribunes
opposed Cicero in his defence of Milo.

Ascon.
in Cic. pro Mil.
p. 33 (Kiessl. and SchÃ¶ll), ‘C.
Sallustius et T. Munatius Plancus tr. pleb. inimicissimas
contiones de Milone habebant.’

In
B.C.
50, Sallust was
legatus pro quaestore
to Bibulus
in Syria, according to Mommsen (
Hermes
, i. 171), who
thinks that the Sallust to whom Cicero writes
ad Fam.
ii. 17
is the historian. In the same year he was expelled from
the Senate by the censors, Appius Claudius and L. Piso.

Pseud.-Cic.
in Sall.
16, ‘neque post illum delectum
senatus vidimus te.’

In
B.C.
49, Caesar reappointed him quaestor, and he
resumed his place in the Senate.

Pseud.-Cic.
in Sall.
17, ‘in senatum post quaesturam est
reductus.’

In
B.C.
48, he commanded a legion in Illyria without
distinction (Orosius vi, 15, 8), and next year he was
Caesar’s agent with the insurgent legions in Campania
(Appian,
B.C.
ii. 92). In
B.C.
46 he was praetor, and as
such commanded successfully an expedition to seize the
enemy’s stores in Cercina.

Bell. Afr.
8, ‘Item C. Sallustium Crispum praetorem ad
Cercinam insulam versus, quam adversarii tenebant, cum
parte navium ire iubet.’ (See also c. 34.)

At the end of the year he was appointed proconsul of
Numidia.

Ibid.
97, ‘Ibi Sallustio pro consule cum imperio relicto
ipse Zama egressus Uticam se recepit.’

As proconsul, he plundered the province, and bought,
probably with the spoils, the
horti Sallustiani
, which afterwards
belonged to the Roman emperors (see Tac.
Ann.

xiii. 47;
Hist.
iii. 82).

Pseud.-Cic.
in Sall.
19, ‘Nonne ita provinciam vastavit,
ut nihil neque passi sint neque exspectaverint gravius in
bello socii nostri, quam experti sint in pace hoc Africam
interiorem obtinente?’

Sallust is said to have married Terentia, whom Cicero
had divorced (Jerome
adv. Iov.
1). Probably he had no
son, as he adopted a grandson of his sister.

Tac.
Ann.
iii. 30, ‘Crispum equestri ortum loco C.
Sallustius, rerum Romanarum florentissimus auctor, sororis
nepotem in nomen adscivit.’

After Caesar’s death, Sallust retired from public life,
and, having no taste for sport or agriculture, spent his
leisure in writing history.

Cat.
4, ‘Ubi ... mihi reliquam aetatem a re publica procul
habendam decrevi, non fuit consilium socordia atque
desidia bonum otium conterere, neque vero agrum colundo
aut venando servilibus officiis intentum aetatem agere;
sed ... statui res gestas populi Romani carptim, ut quaeque
memoria digna videbantur, perscribere.’

Sallust, as above stated, died
B.C.
35.

(2) WORKS.

1.
De Catilinae Coniuratione
(so
Cat.
4). The book is
called
bellum Catilinae
by Quint. iii. 8, 9, and in some

MSS.
; in
MSS.
also
bellum Catilinarium
. The work was
written after Caesar’s death (
Cat.
53-4). It is, as Mommsen
(
R.H.
iv. 184, note) states, a political pamphlet in the
interests of the democratic party (on which the monarchy
was based), and tries to clear Caesar from the charge of
being implicated in the Catilinarian conspiracy, and collaterally
performing the same service for C. Antonius, the
uncle of the triumvir.

Cf.
Cat.
49, ‘Sed isdem temporibus Q. Catulus et C.
Piso neque pretio neque gratia Ciceronem inpellere potuere,
uti per Allobroges aut alium indicem C. Caesar falso
nominaretur. Nam uterque cum illo gravis inimicitias
exercebant ... Sed ubi consulem ad tantum facinus inpellere
nequeunt,’ etc. (Cf. also Caesar’s speech in

Cat.
51.)

Cat.
59, ‘At ex altera parte C. Antonius pedibus aeger,
quod proelio adesse nequibat, M. Petreio legato exercitum
permittit.’ Dion Cassius, xxxvii. 39, on the other hand,
says that this was a pretence, Antonius being unwilling
to fight against his old confederate.

2.
Bellum Iugurthinum
. (So in
MSS.
and Quint. iii. 8, 9.)

Iug.
5, ‘Bellum scripturus sum, quod populus Romanus
cum Iugurtha rege Numidarum gessit, primum quia
magnum et atrox variaque victoria fuit, dehinc quia tunc
primum superbiae nobilitatis obviam itum est.’

The object of the book is to give a picture of the low
state of the oligarchical government (cf.
Iug.
8, ‘Romae
omnia venalia esse’), and to glorify Marius, the chief of
the democratic party.

Of his sources, Sallust mentions Sisenna (
Iug.
95) for
information about Sulla, and native authorities for African
ethnography.

Iug.
17, ‘Sed qui mortales initio Africam habuerint,
quique postea adcesserint, aut quo modo inter se permixti
sint ... uti ex libris Punicis, qui regis Hiempsalis dicebantur,
interpretatum nobis est ... dicam.’

Sallust probably also used the memoirs of Scaurus, Sulla,
and Catulus.

3.
Historiae
.—This work dealt with the events from

B.C.
78 to 67. Cf. Ausonius, p. 264 (ed. Peiper),

‘Ab Lepido et Catulo iam res et tempora Romae

orsus his senos seriem conecto per annos.’

There is no reference in the fragments to any event
after
B.C.
67. The book took up the history where Sisenna
had left off,
B.C.
78. Cf. i.
frag.
1 (ed. Maurenbrecher),
‘Res populi Romani M. Lepido Q. Catulo coss. ac deinde
militiae et domi gestas composui.’

Four speeches and two letters from the
Histories
have
been preserved in a collection of Sallustian speeches and
letters made for rhetorical purposes, probably in the second
century
A.D.
Besides these there are considerable fragments,
chiefly from Books ii. and iii. We may conclude
from
Iug.
95, ‘neque enim alio loco de Sullae rebus
dicturi sumus,’ that the career of Sulla was not treated
of in the
Histories
. He is, however, repeatedly mentioned.

Two works are falsely attributed to Sallust:

1.
Oratio invectiva in Tullium
, composed, along with
an
Oratio invectiva in Sallustium
falsely ascribed to Cicero,
by the same ancient rhetorician. The
Or. in Tull.
is
quoted by Quintilian, if the
MSS.
are right,
e.g.
iv. 1, 68.

2. An oration and an epistle
ad Caesarem senem de re
publica
, both probably belonging to the imperial period.

Sallust as a historian.
—1. He departed from the
annalistic arrangement, and took a broader view of his
subject, endeavouring to connect events together, and to
trace the motives of actions.

2. He shows a want of precision in his facts. Instead
of giving dates, he often says vaguely
interea
;
isdem
temporibus
;
dum haec aguntur
. One year in the Jugurthine
war is left unaccounted for, and Marius is represented as
consul in
B.C.
105. So in geography and ethnography (as in
the
Iugurtha
) he is not to be trusted. In
Iug.
21 he
forgets that Cirta is fifty miles from the sea, and that
city is besieged in the usual way, though surrounded on
three sides by gorges.

He prides himself on his impartiality.

Cat.
4, ‘Mihi a spe, metu, partibus rei publicae animus
liber erat.’ So
Hist.
i. fr. 6.

His leaning to the popular party, however, has been
shown above.

3. His speeches do not always suit the speaker or his
audience, and are not historical. Thus the speech of Catiline
(
Cat.
20) does not suit his audience and is not authentic,
and that of Marius (
Iug.
85) is too learned for the speaker.

4. His prefaces have little to do with what follows. Cf.
Quint. iii. 8, 9, ‘C. Sallustius in bello Iugurthino et Catilinae
nihil ad historiam pertinentibus principiis orsus est.’

5. He is too fond of hackneyed moral maxims and trite
sayings. Thus:

Cat.
i, ‘Sed nostra omnis vis in animo et corpore sita
est,’ etc.

Iug.
2, ‘Nam uti genus hominum compositum ex corpore
et anima est, ita res cunctae studiaque omnia nostra corporis
alia, alia animi naturam secuntur.’

His tone is that of a severe moralist.

Cat.
3, ‘Sed ego adulescentulus initio sicuti plerique
studio ad rem publicam latus sum, ibique mihi multa advorsa
fuere. Nam pro pudore, pro abstinentia, pro virtute audacia,
largitio, avaritia vigebant,’ etc.

As this moralizing did not fit in with the facts of his life
he was censured for it, as shown above.

Sallust’s authorities and models.
—Besides the authorities
mentioned above, he used a
breviarium rerum omnium
Romanarum
prepared for him by the grammarian Ateius
(Sueton.
Gramm.
10). He is said to have borrowed phrases
from Cato.

Quint. viii. 3, 29, ‘Nec minus noto Sallustius epigrammate
incessitur:

“Et verba antiqui multum furate Catonis,

Crispe, Iugurthinae conditor historiae.”’

The similarity of Sallust’s style to that of Thucydides, whom
he tried to emulate, was remarked by the ancients.

Quint. ix. 3, 17, ‘Ex Graeco vero translata vel Sallustii
plurima, quale est “volgus amat fieri”’ [
Iug.
34, a poor
instance, and wrongly quoted]. Cf.
Cat.
6, ‘magisque
dandis quam accipiundis beneficiis amicitias parabant,’ and
Thuc. ii. 40, 4,
Î¿á½ Î³á½°Ï Ïá½±ÏÏÎ¿Î½ÏÎµÏ Îµá½ á¼Î»Î»á½° Î´Ïá¿¶Î½ÏÎµÏ ÎºÏá½½Î¼ÎµÎ¸Î± ÏÎ¿á½ºÏ Ïá½·Î»Î¿Ï

:

Iug.
73, ‘in maius celebrare,’ and Thuc.
i. 10, 3,
á¼Ïá½¶ Ïá½¸ Î¼Îµá¿Î¶Î¿Î½ ÎºÎ¿ÏÎ¼á¿ÏÎ±Î¹
.

Sallust’s popularity is shown by the numerous references
to him, particularly in Quintilian. Cf. Quint. x. 1, 101,
‘At non historia cesserit Graecis, nec opponere Thucydidi
Sallustium verear’; Â§ 102, ‘immortalem illam Sallustii velocitatem.’
Cf. also Martial, xiv. 191, ‘primus Romana Crispus
in historia.’ Tacitus is the most important writer influenced
by Sallust. For imitations cf. Tac.
Agr.
37, where part of
the description of a battle is modelled on
Iug.
101. Cf.
also
Cat.
43, ‘facto non consulto in tali periculo opus esse,’
and Tac.
Hist.
i. 62, ‘ubi facto magis quam consulto opus
esset.’

CATULLUS.

The poet’s full name, C.
[35]
Valerius Catullus, is got from
Jerome and other authorities quoted below, as also his
birthplace, Verona, to which Catullus himself refers
(c. 67, 34, ‘Veronae meae’; 68, 27; 100, 2). The dates
of his birth and death are uncertain. Jerome gives them
as
B.C.
87-58.

Yr. Abr. 1930 =
B.C.
87, ‘Gaius Valerius Catullus scriptor
lyricus Veronae nascitur.’

Yr. Abr. 1959 =
B.C.
58, ‘Catullus xxx. aetatis anno
Romae moritur.’ His early death is referred to by Ovid,

Am.
iii. 9, 61,

‘Obvius huic [Tibullo] venias hedera iuvenilia cinctus

tempora, cum Calvo, docte Catulle, tuo’;

but it is quite certain that the year of his death given by
Jerome as
B.C.
58 is wrong. In c. 113, 2, the second consulship
of Pompeius in
B.C.
55 is referred to, and cc. 11
and 29 were written after Caesar’s expedition to Britain
in
B.C.
55. C. 52 used to be taken as referring to
B.C.
47,
from l. 3, ‘per consulatum perierat Vatinius,’ but, as shown
below, was written in
B.C.
55 or 54. As no clear reference
is found to any event after
B.C.
54 (a highly important time,
which would have been likely to produce some sarcastic
poetry from Catullus), it is best to accept the view that
Catullus lived from 87 to 54 or 53
B.C.
B. Schmidt (ed.
mai. 1887, prolegomena), on the other hand, fixes the dates
as 82-52
B.C.
(accepting Jerome’s account of Catullus’ age),
and attributes c. 38 (to Cornificius) to the latter year.

Catullus’ family was wealthy and of good position, as is
seen from his having estates at Sirmio (c. 31) and Tibur
(c. 44), and from the fact that his father was a friend of
Julius Caesar.

Sueton.
Iul.
73, ‘Hospitioque patris eius [Catulli], sicut
consueverat, uti perseveravit.’

Catullus went to Rome early, and there, as Schmidt
thinks, was taught by the grammarian Valerius Cato, to
whom c. 56 is probably addressed. From c. 68, 34-5, we
see that he was settled at Rome.

‘Romae vivimus: illa domus,

illa mihi sedes, illic mea carpitur aetas.’

Catullus wrote love-poetry soon after taking the
toga
virilis
; c. 68, 15,

‘Tempore quo primum vestis mihi tradita purast,

iucundum cum aetas florida ver ageret,

multa satis lusi.’

Catullus’ love for Lesbia is the outstanding fact of his life.
Her real name was Clodia, the sister of P. Clodius, nicknamed
for her immorality ‘quadrantaria.’

Apuleius,
Apol.
10, ‘Accusent C. Catullum quod Lesbiam
pro Clodia nominarit.’

Ovid,
Trist.
ii. 427,

‘Sic sua lascivo cantata est saepe Catullo

femina, cui falsum Lesbia nomen erat.’

The name Lesbia (which scans like Clodia) may be got
from Sappho, the Lesbian poetess, on whom c. 51 (probably
the first addressed to Clodia) is modelled. The facts known
about Clodia all fit in with what Catullus tells us of Lesbia.
For Lesbia’s beauty, cf. cc. 43 and 86; Clodia was called

Î²Î¿á¿¶ÏÎ¹Ï
from her large and lustrous eyes (Cic.
ad Att.

ii. 9, 1; 12, 2, etc.). For her relations with her husband,
cf. Cic.
ad Att.
ii. 1, 5 (written
B.C.
60), ‘Est enim seditiosa:
cum viro bellum gerit.’ A hint of the real name is got from
c. 79, where the Lesbius mentioned is Clodius, just as
Lesbia is Clodia,

‘Lesbius est pulcer: quid ni? quem Lesbia malit

quam te cum tota gente, Catulle, tua.’

It is probable that the acquaintance began in
B.C.
61.
In
B.C.
62 Clodia was the wife of Q. Caecilius Metellus
Celer (Cic.
ad Fam.
v. 2, 6), and in that year Metellus was
governor of Gallia Cisalpina. Now from c. 83 it is evident
that Lesbia’s husband was in Rome when she began to be
annoyed by Catullus’ attentions. We may conclude from
c. 30 that P. Alfenus Varus introduced Catullus to Lesbia.
In that poem Catullus blames Varus for leading him on
and then leaving him in the lurch. M’. Allius is next mentioned
(c. 68) as a friend in whose house Catullus met
Lesbia; and cc. 2, 3, 5, and 7 probably belong to this
fortunate period of the poet’s love. C. 8 speaks of Lesbia’s
leaving him (cf. c. 92), probably on account of her husband’s
suspicions. Cf. c. 5, 1,

‘Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus,

rumoresque senum severiorum

omnes unius aestimemus assis.’

C. 107 speaks of an unexpected reconciliation (celebrated
in c. 36). C. 107, 5,

‘Restituis cupido atque insperanti, ipsa refers te

nobis. O lucem candidiore nota!’

When Catullus, on account of his brother’s death, left
Rome for Verona, he already knew that Lesbia had other
lovers (c. 68, ll. 27
sqq.
, 135
sqq.
). There are many poems
against his rivals: c. 82, against Quintius; c. 40, against
Ravidus; cc. 74, 80, 88-91, 116, against Gellius; c. 77,
against Rufus, who is attacked also in cc. 59 and 69 (this is
M. Caelius Rufus, the orator, who intrigued with Clodia:
Cic.
pro Cael.
17, etc.); c. 79, against Lesbius (see above).
After Catullus returned to Rome, he found that he had lost
Lesbia’s affections. C. 70 was then written,

‘Nulli se dicit mulier mea nubere malle

quam mihi, non si se Iuppiter ipse petat.

Dicit: sed mulier cupido quod dicit amanti,

in vento et rapida scribere oportet aqua.’

The words of this poem show that it must have been
written after the death of Clodia’s husband Metellus, which
took place in
B.C.
59, and it was probably written soon after
that event, when Catullus had returned to Rome from
Verona.

Nos. 72, 85, and especially 58, show increasing bitterness,
and must, with the possible exception of 58, be assigned
to the years
B.C.
59 or 58. In c. 76 he prays for power
to give Lesbia up; cf. ll. 23-6,

‘Non iam illud quaero, contra ut me diligat illa,

aut, quod non potis est, esse pudica velit:

ipse valere opto et taetrum hunc deponere morbum.

O di, reddite mi hoc pro pietate mea.’

It is probable that the separation between the lovers
occurred not later than
B.C.
58; otherwise Catullus would not
have left for Bithynia in the next year. In c. 11, the last
poem that refers to Lesbia, which, from the reference to
Britain in l. 12, cannot have been written before
B.C.
55,
we see that Catullus is cured of his passion; cf. ll. 21-4,

‘Nec meum respectet, ut ante, amorem,

qui illius culpa cecidit velut prati

ultimi flos, praetereunte postquam

tactus aratro est.’

In the spring of
B.C.
57 Catullus went to Bithynia on the
staff of the propraetor C. Memmius (cc. 10 and 28). From
c. 10, 29, ‘meus sodalis Cinna est Gaius,’ we see that C.
Helvius Cinna accompanied him. In c. 46, 9 he speaks
of the pleasant meetings of the staff, ‘O dulces comitum
valete coetus.’ C. 46 shows that Catullus left Bithynia in
the spring of the following year: ll. 1-4,

‘Iam ver egelidos refert tepores ...

Linquantur Phrygii, Catulle, campi.’

The dirge in c. 101 shows that Catullus, on his way to
Italy, visited his brother’s tomb in the Troad, and paid
the last rites to it. C. 4, written soon after his return to
Sirmio, tells us how he made his way home again. About
the same time was composed the address to Sirmio in c.
31; c. 10 proves that he soon went back to Rome.

The poems against Caesar’s party belong to the years

B.C.
55 and 54. In cc. 41 and 43 Catullus calls a Transpadane
girl ‘decoctoris amica Formiani,’ the reference being
to Mamurra, ‘the bankrupt from Formiae,’ who had been
Caesar’s
praefectus fabrum
in Gaul, and who may have been
a successful rival of Catullus in love. C. 29, written probably
in
B.C.
54, attacked Mamurra, and also his patrons,
Caesar and Pompey. From l. 24, ‘socer generque, perdidistis
omnia,’ it is clear that the poem was written before
Julia’s death in September,
B.C.
54; and from ll. 11-12,

‘eone nomine, imperator unice,

fuisti in ultima occidentis insula,’

that it was written after Caesar’s first expedition to Britain
in
B.C.
55. The poem is referred to by Sueton.
Iul.
73,
‘Valerium Catullum, a quo sibi versiculis de Mamurra
perpetua stigmata imposita non dissimulaverat, satis facientem
eadem die adhibuit cenae hospitioque patris eius sicut
consueverat uti perseveravit.’

C. 52 (against Vatinius) was written
B.C.
55 or 54. It
used to be assigned to
B.C.
47, when Vatinius was consul,
but l. 3, ‘per consulatum perierat Vatinius’ means ‘Vatinius
perjures himself by his hope of the consulship’ (his name
stood on the list agreed on at Luca, which is mentioned by
Cic.
ad Att.
iv. 8
b
, 2); and l. 2, ‘Sella in curuli struma
Nonius sedet,’ cannot refer to
B.C.
47, as the only ordinary
curule magistrates in that year were P. Vatinius and Q. Fufius
Calenus. Among other poems against personal enemies are
c. 98, against Vettius, and c. 108, against Cominius, both
of them informers; and c. 84, against Arrius, who aspirated
his words wrongly, and who, from l. 7, ‘hoc misso in Syriam,’
is supposed to have gone out to Syria as
legatus
to Crassus
in
B.C.
55. C. 49 is an attack on Cicero:

‘Disertissime Romuli nepotum,

quot sunt quotque fuere, Marce Tulli,

quotque post aliis erunt in annis,

gratias tibi maximas Catullus

agit, pessimus omnium poeta,

tanto pessimus omnium poeta

quanto tu optimus omnium patronus.’

The sting lies in the
double entendre
in the last two lines,
which really mean ‘so much the worst poet of all poets,
as you are the best advocate of all clients, good and bad.’
So Cicero is called in a good sense
omnium patronus
by
Caecina in Cic.
ad Fam.
vi. 7, 4. The poem has special
reference to
B.C.
54, when Cicero defended Vatinius (whom
he had reviled two years before in the speech
Pro Sestio
), when
prosecuted by Catullus’ friend, Calvus (cf. c. 14, 1-3); and
thanks Cicero ironically for some criticism he had passed
on his poems. Catullus attacks several contemporary poets;
so in c. 22, Suffenus, who in c. 14 is coupled with Caesius
and Aquinus; Volusius in cc. 36 and 95; cf. 36, 1, ‘Annales
Volusi, cacata charta.’
[36]

Among Catullus’ friends were Veranius and Fabullus
(cc. 9, 28, etc.); P. Alfenus Varus of Cremona (cc. 10, 22,
30), consul
B.C.
39, and a famous
iurisconsultus
. C. 61
celebrates the marriage of L. Manlius Torquatus (who was
praetor
B.C.
49) and Vinia Aurunculeia. Several poems are
addressed to brother poets; c. 35 is to Caecilius of Novum
Comum; c. 38 to Cornificius, a writer of slight love poems
(Ovid,
Trist.
ii. 436) who died
B.C.
41; c. 95 is on Cinna’s

Zmyrna
; cc. 14, 50, and 96 are addressed to C. Licinius
Calvus; c. 56 to Valerius Cato (see above); c. 65 to
Hortensius Ortalus, who asked Catullus to translate
Callimachus; c. 1, and possibly c. 102, to Cornelius
Nepos.

Catullus’ longer poems.
—These, unlike the shorter personal
poems, are mostly due to Alexandrian influence, to which
Catullus may have been introduced by his teacher, Valerius
Cato. To these poems Catullus owes his title
doctus
(Tibull.
iii. 6, 41; Martial, i. 62, 1, etc.). They include: c. 66,
‘coma Berenices,’ from Callimachus; cf. c. 65, ll. 15-6,

‘Sed tamen in tantis maeroribus, Ortale, mitto

haec expressa tibi carmina Battiadae’;

c. 68 to Allius, also Alexandrian; c. 64, the ‘Nuptials of
Peleus and Thetis,’ l. 30 of which,

‘Oceanusque, mari totum qui amplectitur orbem,’

is from Euphorion, fr. 158 (Meineke),
á½¨ÎºÎµÎ±Î½á½¸Ï, Ïá¿· Ïá¾¶ÏÎ± ÏÎµÏá½·ÏÏÏ
ÏÎ¿Ï
á¼Î½Î´á½³Î´ÎµÏÎ±Î¹ ÏÎ¸á½½Î½
; c. 63, the ‘Attis’ in Galliambic
metre; c. 62, a translation of a Sapphic epithalamium.
C. 51, and possibly some parts of c. 61, are from Sappho.
Catullus was the first Roman to use the Sapphic measure
(in cc. 11 and 51).

Publication of the Poems.
—From the arrangement of the
poems, which accords neither with chronology nor with
subjects, and from the large number of lines extant (2286),
which does not suit
libellus
(c. i. 1), it is highly probable
that they were not left by Catullus as we find them. C. 2,
beginning ‘Passer, deliciae meae puellae,’ was the first of
a series of short poems. Cf. Martial, iv. 14, 13,

‘Sic forsan tener ausus est Catullus

magno mittere passerem Maroni’;
[37]

the book being named from its first word, like
Arma virumque

of the
Aeneid
. C. 1 (to Cornelius Nepos) is the
first of another series of short pieces (cf. the epithet
nugae

in l. 4). Catullus doubtless published his larger pieces
together. The traditional arrangement, due to a later hand,
is as follows: (1) The lyric poems in various metres; (2)
the larger poems and the elegies; (3) the shorter poems
written in elegiacs. Catullus began to be popular as soon
as his works were published; cf. Nep.
Att.
12, 4 (quoted

p. 124
). He is imitated in the
Priapea
, in Ovid, in
Ausonius, in the
Ciris
, in Martial, etc. C. 4 is closely
parodied in Verg.
Catal.

CONTEMPORARY POETS:

(
a
)
Ticidas
wrote the Hymenaeus and love-poems on
Perilla. For the latter cf. Ovid,
Trist.
ii. 433-4 and 437-8
(read by Riese immediately after),

‘Quid referam Ticidae, quid Memmi carmen, apud quos

rebus adest nomen nominibusque pudor,

et quorum libris modo dissimulata Perillae

nomine nunc legitur dicta, Metelle, tuo?’

(

)
C. Helvius Cinna
was intimate with Catullus, who
refers to him in c. 10 as being along with him in Bithynia
in
B.C.
57. See
p. 136
. From the reference to Gallia
Cisalpina in Cinna, frag. I (BÃ¤hrens), we might conclude
that he was a countryman of Catullus,

‘At nunc me Cenumana per salicta

bigis raeda rapit citata nanis.’

In Sueton.
Iul.
52, Cinna is spoken of as a partisan of
Caesar: ‘Helvius Cinna tribunus plebis,’ etc.; and he is
probably identical with the person mentioned
ibid.
85,
as put to death in mistake for a man of the same name
shortly after the murder of Caesar: ‘Plebs statim a funere
ad domum Bruti et Cassii cum facibus tetendit, atque aegre
repulsa, obvium sibi Helvium Cinnam per errorem nominis,
quasi Cornelius is esset, quem graviter pridie contionatum
de Caesare requirebat, occidit caputque eius praefixum
hastae circumtulit.’

Cf. especially Plutarch,
Brut.

, etc.
[38]

Weichert (
Poet. Lat. Rell.
p. 157) thinks that Plutarch
has confused the tr. pleb. with the poet, and that Virgil’s
words (below) imply that Helvius Cinna was alive when
the
Eclogue
was written (
B.C.
41-39). The latest authorities,
however, identify the two persons. Verg.
Ecl.
9, 35,

‘Nam neque adhuc Vario videor nec dicere Cinna

digna, sed argutos inter strepere anser
[39]
olores.’

Cinna’s works were:

1.
Zmyrna
, on the incestuous love of Myrrha for Cinyras.
Cinna spent nine years on this poem, which was very
obscure. Catull. 95,

‘Zmyrna mei Cinnae nonam post denique messem

quam coeptast nonamque edita post hiemem.’

Philargyrius ad Verg.
Ecl.
9, 35, ‘Fuit autem liber obscurus
adeo ut et nonnulli eius aetatis grammatici in eum
scripserint magnamque ex eius enarratione sint gloriam
consecuti.’

2.
Propempticon Pollionis
, written on the occasion of
Asinius Pollio’s visit to Greece.

3.
Epigrams and Love Poems.
—For the latter cf. Ovid,

Trist.
ii. 435 (on the erotic poets),

‘Cinna quoque his comes est, Cinnaque procacior Anser,

et leve Cornifici parque Catonis opus.’

(

C. Licinius Macer Calvus
was the son of the annalist
C. Licinius Macer, and was born 28th May,
B.C.
82.

Cic.
ad Q.F.
ii. 4, 1, ‘Macer Licinius.’

Valer. Max. ix. 12, 7, ‘C. Licinius Macer, Calvi pater.’

Pliny,
N.H.
vii. 165, ‘C. Mario Cn. Carbone iii. coss.
a. d. v. Kal. Iun. M. Caelius Rufus et C. Licinius Calvus
eadem die geniti sunt.’

Calvus probably died
B.C.
47. Cf. Cic.
ad Fam.
xv.
21, 4, written to C. Trebonius towards the end of that
year. The letter refers to correspondence with Calvus,
and criticizes his oratory.

See also Cic.
Brut.
279 and 283-4; and, for his relations
with Cicero, Tac.
Dial.
18. Calvus vied with Cicero for
the first place in the forum. His best known speeches
were
in Vatinium
, whom he prosecuted at least three times
(
B.C.
58-54).

Seneca,
Controv.
vii. 4, 6-8, ‘Calvus, qui diu cum Cicerone
iniquissimam litem de principatu eloquentiae habuit, usque
eo violentus actor et concitatus fuit, ut in media eius actione
surgeret Vatinius reus et exclamaret: Rogo vos, iudices, num
si iste disertus est, ideo me damnari oportet? Idem postea
cum videret a clientibus Catonis, rei sui, Pollionem Asinium
circumventum in foro caedi, imponi se supra cippum iussit;
erat enim parvolus statura, propter quod etiam Catullus in
hendecasyllabis (c. 53) vocat illum “salaputtium disertum.”
... Solebat praeterea excedere subsellia sua et impetu
latus usque in adversariorum partem transcurrere. Et
carmina quoque eius, quamvis iocosa sint, plena sunt
ingentis animi ... Compositio quoque eius in actionibus ad
exemplum Demosthenis riget: nihil in illa placidum, nihil
lene est, omnia excitata et fluctuantia.’

Catullus also refers to Calvus in c. 14, and in c. 96,
where he speaks of the ‘mors immatura Quintiliae,’ probably
Calvus’ wife.

Of the poems about nineteen lines are extant. They
included: (1)
ludicra
(in hendecasyllables); (2)
epithalamia
;
(3)
Io
; (4)
ad uxorem
; (5)
epigrammata
. For the last cf.
Sueton.
Iul.
73, ‘C. Calvo post famosa epigrammata de
reconciliatione per amicos agenti ultro ac prior scripsit.’
(6) ‘Calvi de aquae frigidae usu,’ which forms the title of
Martial xiv. 196, may have been a didactic poem. Other
references to Calvus’ poetry are: Ovid,
Trist.
ii. 431,

‘Par fuit exigui similisque licentia Calvi,

detexit variis qui sua furta modis’;

Propert. iii. 34, 89,

‘Haec etiam docti confessast pagina Calvi

cum caneret miserae funera Quintiliae’;

Hor.
Sat.
i. 10, 16,

‘Illi, scripta quibus comoedia prisca viris est,

hoc stabant, hoc sunt imitandi: quos neque pulcher

Hermogenes umquam legit, neque simius iste

nil praeter Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum.’

P. Terentius Varro Atacinus
was born
B.C.
82 in
Gallia Narbonensis near Atax (a river, not a town, as
Jerome states).

Jerome yr. Abr. 1935 =
B.C.
82, ‘P. Terentius Varro vico
Atace in provincia Narbonensi nascitur; qui postea xxxv.
annum agens Graecas litteras cum summo studio didicit.’

Porphyr. ad Hor.
Sat.
i. 10, 46, ‘Terentius Varro Narbonensis,
qui Atacinus ab Atace fluvio dictus est.’

Varro must have died before
B.C.
35, when Horace,
speaking of satire, wrote,
Sat.
i. 10, 46,

‘Hoc erat, experto frustra Varrone Atacino

atque quibusdam aliis melius quod scribere possem.’

Varro’s works were:

1.
Bellum Sequanicum
, probably an epic on Caesar’s
war with Ariovistus in
B.C.
58.

2.
Saturae
, mentioned only in the above passage of
Horace.

3.
Argonautae
, a translation from Apollonius Rhodius
in four Books. Probus ad Verg.

qui quattuor libros de Argonautis edidit.’

Cf. Sen.

vii. 1, 27, ‘Illos optimos versus Varronis
(= Apoll. iii. 749-50),

“Desierant latrare canes urbesque silebant;

Publilius Syrus
was a manumitted slave, a native of
Syria, probably of Antioch.

Jerome yr. Abr. 1974 =
B.C.
43, ‘Publilius mimographus
natione Syrus Romae scaenam tenet.’

Pliny,
N.H.
xxxv. 199, ‘Est et vilissima [creta] qua

MSS.
lochium) mimicae

An account of Publilius’ manumission, and his contest
with Laberius in
B.C.
45, is given by Macrob.
Saturn.
ii.
7, 4-8, and is quoted under ‘Laberius,’
p. 97
.

Publilius’ works were:

1.
Mimi.
—Two titles are quoted.

2.
Sententiae.
—Six hundred and ninety-seven lines from
his mimes (unconnected and alphabetically arranged) are
preserved from different sources. Most are iambic senarii,
some trochaic septenarii.

Macrob.
Saturn.
ii. 7, 10, ‘Publili sententiae feruntur
lepidae et ad communem usum adcommodatissimae.’

Cicero heard his and Laberius’ plays in
B.C.
46. See

ad Fam.

p. 99
.

“Cuivis potest accidere quod cuiquam potest.”’

The lines are, like the above, proverbs of worldly wisdom,
and seem to have been used in schools.

“Aegre reprendas quod sinas consuescere.”’

CHAPTER III

THE AUGUSTAN AGE.

VIRGIL.

(1) LIFE.

Our chief authority for the life of Virgil, apart from his
own writings and those of his contemporaries, is Donatus,
whose work is probably based on Suetonius’
De Poetis
.
Donatus’ work, though not free from romance, is much
more valuable than the Life by Probus
[41]
or the metrical
account given by Phocas.
[42]
Some important details are
given in the Life wrongly attributed to Servius, and in an
account preserved in a Berne
MS.
of the tenth century.

The poet’s name is correctly given as P. Vergilius Maro
in all the Lives. The balance of authority is decidedly
in favour of the spelling ‘Vergilius’; it is always so written
in the early
MSS.
and in inscriptions of the Republic and
of the early centuries
A.D.
The traditional form in modern
literature, ‘Virgil,’ is here retained.

Virgil was born 15th October,
B.C.
70, at Andes (identified
traditionally with Pietole)
[43]
near Mantua. Donatus,

vit. Verg.
, ‘Natus est Cn. Pompeio Magno et M. Licinio
Crasso primum coss. iduum Octobrium die, in pago qui
Andes dicitur et abest a Mantua non procul.’

He was of humble extraction, his father being originally
either a potter or a day-labourer.

Probus,
vit. Verg.
, ‘Matre Magia Polla, patre rustico.’

Donatus, ‘Parentibus modicis fuit ac praecipue patre,
quem quidam opificem figulum, plures Magi cuiusdam
viatoris initio mercennarium mox ob industriam generum
tradiderunt egregieque substantiae silvis coemendis et
apibus curandis auxisse reculam.’ (Cf. Virgil’s treatment
of bees in
Georgic
iv.)

His early years were spent at Cremona, whence in

B.C.
55 he went to Mediolanum and then to Rome for
his higher education. He studied philosophy, medicine,
mathematics, and rhetoric; but his shyness prevented his
being a success at the bar, where, we are told, he appeared
only once.

Donatus, ‘Initia aetatis Cremonae egit usque ad virilem
togam, quam xv. anno natali suo accepit isdem illis consulibus
iterum duobus quibus erat natus, evenitque ut eo
ipso die Lucretius poeta decederet. De Cremona Mediolanum
et inde paulo post transiit in urbem ... Inter cetera
studia medicinae quoque ac maxime mathematicae
[44]
operam
dedit. Egit et causam apud iudices unam omnino nec
amplius quam semel; nam et in sermone tardissimum
ac paene indocto similem fuisse Melissus [a freedman of
Maecenas] tradidit.’

The Berne
MS.
above referred to says: ‘Ut primum se
contulit Romam, studuit apud Epidium oratorem cum
Caesare Augusto.’
[45]
For his studies under the Epicurean
Siron cf.
Catal.
7, 8,

‘Nos ad beatos vela mittimus portus,

magni petentes docta dicta Sironis,

vitamque ab omni vindicabimus cura.’

Cf. also
Ecl.
6, 31-40, where a brief sketch is given of
the Epicurean theory of creation.

For a few years we hear nothing of his life, but we may
suppose that he continued his studies in literature and
philosophy, probably at his farm, if we can draw any inference
from the language of
Ecl.
1, especially l. 19
sqq.

So far as is known, he took no part in the civil wars. In

B.C.
41, when lands were assigned to the troops of Antonius,
Virgil was dispossessed of his property. On the recommendation
of Asinius Pollio, who was
legatus
of Gallia
Transpadana, he went to Rome and obtained from Octavian
the restitution of his land. The poet expresses his gratitude
in
Ecl.
1, 42,

‘Hic illum vidi iuvenem, Meliboee, quotannis

bis senos cui nostra dies altaria fumant.

Hic mihi responsum primus dedit ille petenti:

“Pascite ut ante boves, pueri, submittite tauros.”’

Cf. also ll. 70-3.

Donatus, ‘Ad bucolica transiit maxime ut Asinium
Pollionem, Alphenum Varum, et Cornelium Gallum celebraret,
quia in distributione agrorum qui post Philippensem
victoriam
[46]
veteranis triumvirorum iussu trans Padum dividebantur,
indemnem se praestitissent.’

Virgil was evicted a second time in the following year,
after the Bellum Perusinum, by the troops of Octavian.
Conflicting accounts are given by the Lives regarding the
persons who seized his land.
[47]

Servius,
vit. Verg.
, ‘Postea ortis bellis civilibus inter
Antonium et Augustum, Augustus victor Cremonensium
agros, quia pro Antonio senserant, dedit militibus suis.
Qui cum non sufficerent, his addidit agros Mantuanos,
sublatos non propter civium culpam, sed propter vicinitatem
Cremonensium: unde ipse in Bucolicis (9, 28),
“Mantua vae miserae nimium vicina Cremonae.”’

Virgil and his household found refuge on an estate which
had once belonged to his old master Siron:
Catal.
10,

‘Villula, quae Sironis eras, et pauper agelle ...

Tu nunc eris illi [patri]

Mantua quod fuerat quodque Cremona prius.’

Whether he recovered his old farm is uncertain: at all
events he spent most of his time in the south of Italy.
Besides a house in Rome, he seems to have had a country
house near Nola, and we know that the
Georgics
(cf. iv. 563)
were written at Naples.

Donatus, ‘Habuit domum Romae Esquiliis iuxta hortos
Maecenatis, quamquam secessu Campaniae Siciliaeque
plurimum uteretur.’

Gell. vi. 20, 1, ‘Scriptum in quodam commentario
repperi ... Vergilium petivisse a Nolanis, aquam uti duceret
in propinquum rus.’

He lived a retired life, seldom visiting Rome, and devoting
most of his time to poetical composition, in which
he was regular and painstaking.

Tac.
Dial.
13, ‘Securum et quietum Vergilii secessum,
in quo tamen neque apud divum Augustum gratia
caruit neque apud populum Romanum notitia: testes
Augusti epistulae, testis ipse populus, qui auditis in
theatro Vergilii versibus surrexit universus et forte praesentem
spectantemque Vergilium veneratus est sic quasi
Augustum.’

Quint. x. 3, 8, ‘Vergilium paucissimos die composuisse
versus auctor est Varius.’

Cf. his own expression, quoted by Gell. xvii. 10, 2,
‘parere se versus more atque ritu ursino’ (alluding
to the notion that the bear licked its young into
shape).

He was already an influential member of Maecenas’
literary circle, to which, in
B.C.
39, he introduced Horace.
Cf. Hor.
Sat.
i. 6, 54,

‘optimus olim

Vergilius, post hunc Varius dixere quid essem.’

By Maecenas he was introduced to Augustus,
[48]
who treated
him with liberality. Cf. Hor.
Ep.
ii. 1, 246,

‘Munera quae multa dantis cum laude tulerunt

dilecti tibi Vergilius Variusque poetae.’

He was on intimate terms with Horace, who addresses

Od.
i. 3 to him on the occasion of a proposed visit to
Greece. Cf. ll. 5-8,

‘Navis, quae tibi creditum

debes Vergilium, finibus Atticis

reddas incolumem, precor,

et serves animae dimidium meae.’

In
B.C.
37 he formed one of the party who travelled
with Horace to Brundisium: Hor.
Sat.
i. 5, 40 (see under
‘Horace,’
p. 167
).

For the rest of his life we hear little of Virgil in any
public connexion. In
B.C.
19 he started on a voyage to
Greece and Asia, intending to spend three years on the
revision of the
Aeneid
, but returned from Athens in
bad health, and died at Brundisium on 21st September.
His remains were buried near Naples. The epitaph
quoted by Donatus is obviously not by Virgil: ‘Anno
aetatis lii. impositurus Aeneidi summam manum, statuit
in Graeciam et in Asiam secedere triennioque continuo
nihil amplius quam emendare, ut reliqua vita tantum
philosophiae vacaret: sed cum ingressus iter Athenis occurrisset Augusto ab oriente Romam revertenti destinaretque
non absistere atque etiam una redire, dum Megara vicinum
oppidum ferventissimo sole cognoscit, languorem nactus
est eumque non intermissa navigatione auxit, ita ut gravior
aliquanto Brundisium appelleret, ubi diebus paucis obiit xi.
Kal. Octobr. Cn. Sentio Q. Lucretio coss. (21st September,

B.C.
19). Ossa eius Neapolim translata sunt tumuloque
condita ... in quo distichon fecit tale:

“Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc

Parthenope: cecini pascua, rura, duces.”’

His personal appearance and character are thus described
by Donatus: ‘Corpore et statura fuit grandis, aquilo colore,
facie rusticana, valetudine varia: nam plerumque a
stomacho et a faucibus ac dolore capitis laborabat, sanguinem
etiam saepe reiecit.’ (Cf. Hor.
Sat.
i. 5, 48,

‘Lusum it Maecenas, dormitum ego Vergiliusque;

namque pila lippis inimicum et ludere crudis.’)

‘Cibi vinique minimi, libidinis pronior ... cetera sane
vita et ore et animo tam probum constat, ut Neapoli
Parthenias volgo appellatus sit, ac si quando Romae, quo
rarissime commeabat, viseretur in publico, sectantes demonstrantesque
se suffugeret in proximum tectum.’

(2) WORKS.

Minor Poems
.—According to Donatus, these were: ‘In
Balistam ... deinde Catalecton et Priapia et Epigrammata
et Diras, item Cirim et Culicem, cum esset annorum xvi.’
Servius omits the boyish production ‘in Balistam,’ and
adds the ‘Copa.’ The ‘Aetna,’ mentioned with doubt by
Donatus, is, of course, not by Virgil. (1)
Catalecta
.-This
seems better than
Catalecton
; either would mean “a collection
of poems.” Some give
Catalepton
(= “trifles,” like
Aratus’ work
Ïá½° ÎºÎ±Ïá½° Î»ÎµÏÏÏÎ½
). Ribbeck thinks
Catalecta

originally included the
Priapea
,
Epigrammata
, and
Dirae
,
but came to be restricted to the fourteen short pieces
given in our
MSS.
under that title. Some of these,
e.g.

No. 5, are spurious. Quint. viii. 3, 28 vouches for No. 2.
Virgil’s friends, Tucca and Varius, are addressed in 1 and
9, and 10 (on Siron’s villa) refers to an event in Virgil’s
life. In the vein of Catullus are 3, 4, and 8, the last being
an extremely close parody of Catullus, c. 4. (2)
Priapea
,
three in number. (3)
Dirae
, spurious. (4)
Ciris
. The
writer’s reference to himself in l. 2, ‘Irritaque expertum
fallacis praemia volgi,’ shows that Virgil is not the author.
(5)
Culex
. That Virgil wrote a poem with this title is
attested by Suetonius, Statius, and Martial;
e.g.
Mart. viii.
56, 19,

‘Protinus Italiam concepit et arma virumque

qui modo vix Culicem fleverat ore rudi.’

The poem in its present form is accepted by Ribbeck, but
it does not correspond exactly to the account given by
Donatus of the contents. (6) The
Copa
Ribbeck accepts
as genuine, but other critics find in it characteristics rather
of Ovid or of Propertius. (7) The
Moretum
, though found
in
MSS.
, is not mentioned by Donatus or Servius, a strong
argument against its being genuine.

Bucolica
.—These ten poems are called in the
MSS.

Eclogae
(“selected pieces”), and were composed
B.C.
43-39.
Probus, ‘Scripsit Bucolica annos natus xxviii., Theocritum
secutus.’

Servius, ‘Tunc ei proposuit Pollio ut carmen bucolicum
scriberet, quod eum constat triennio
[49]
scripsisse et emendasse.’

They were doubtless published separately as they were
written, and afterwards collected into a volume with
Ecl.

(Tityrus) coming first. Cf.
Georg.
iv. 565,

‘Carmina qui lusi pastorum, audaxque iuventa,

Tityre, te patulae cecini sub tegmine fagi.’

The present order is certainly not the chronological order.

Ecl.
1 was written
B.C.
41 as a thanksgiving to Augustus
(see
p. 150
).

Ecl.
2 cannot be earlier than the end of 43 when Pollio
was made governor of Gallia Transpadana, and possibly
should not be put earlier than the summer of 42. The
poem is written on his favourite slave Alexis (see Serv.

ad loc.
).

Ecl.
3 was probably written soon afterwards. Virgil
refers in l. 84 to his intimacy with Pollio,

‘Pollio amat nostram, quamvis est rustica, Musam.’

Ecl.
2 and 3 are earlier than 5. Cf. 5, 86-7,

‘Haec nos “Formosum Corydon ardebat Alexim,”

haec eadem docuit “Cuium pecus? an Meliboei?”’

Ecl.
4. The date is clear from l. 3,

‘Si canimus silvas, silvae sint
consule
dignae.’

It must have been written in 40, when Pollio was consul.
This eclogue, which in the Middle Age was believed to be
a prophecy of the Messiah’s coming, cannot be satisfactorily
explained as referring to Pollio’s son Saloninus, or to the
expected child of Augustus, Julia.

Ecl.
5. Spohn’s view is highly probable, that it was
written for the first celebration of Caesar’s birthday in
July, 42.

Ecl.
6, to Varus, probably written
B.C.
40 from Siron’s villa.

Ecl.
7 contains no allusion to contemporary events: the
tone is purely pastoral.

Ecl.
8 was written while Pollio was on his way back to
Rome from his victory over the Parthini in Illyricum, for
his triumph in
B.C.
39. Cf. ll. 6 and 12.

In
Ecl.
9, written
B.C.
40 at Siron’s villa, the poet
expresses his grief at the second expulsion from his farm.

Ecl.
10 entitled ‘Gallus’ was written
B.C.
39. For details
see under ‘Gallus,’
p. 182
.
[50]

Sources of the Eclogues.
—Several of the Eclogues are
modelled on Theocritus (cf. ‘Sicelides Musae’ 4, 1; ‘Syracosius
versus’ 6, 1),
e.g.

Ecl.
8 on Theocr. 2 and 3;
and close imitations are found throughout. The poet
Euphorion of Chalcis (of third century
B.C.
) is alluded to in

Ecl.
10, 50 in connection with Gallus. The names of the
shepherds are mostly from Theocritus, as Tityrus, Mopsus,
Damoetas. They are ‘Arcades’ (7, 4, etc.), but, like the
scenery, exhibit traits both of Sicily and of North Italy.
Thus the scenery never gives an accurate picture of any
one locality:
e.g.

Ecl.
9, ll. 1-10, 26-7, 36, 59-60, present
features of the district around Mantua, while in ll. 39-43
a Sicilian scene is introduced from Theocritus. The lofty
mountains,
e.g.
1, 84, are Sicilian, and so are many of the
trees, as chestnut and pine, which are said not to be found
near Mantua. For Mantuan scenery cf.
e.g.
7, 12,

‘Hic virides tenera praetexit harundine ripas

Mincius.’

The
Georgics
were written from
B.C.
37 to 30 at the
suggestion of Maecenas. Cf. i. 1.

Serv.
vit. Verg.
‘Item proposuit Maecenas Georgica,
quae scripsit emendavitque septem annis.’

The poem was finished by
B.C.
29. Cf. Donatus,
‘Georgica reverso post Actiacam victoriam Augusto atque
Atellae ... commoranti per continuum quadriduum legit.’
It was written at Naples. Cf. iv. 559,

‘Haec super arvorum cultu pecorumque canebam ...

Illo Vergilium me tempore dulcis alebat

Parthenope, studiis florentem ignobilis oti.’

The concluding part of Book iv., originally a dirge on
Cornelius Gallus, was afterwards altered for the myth of
Aristaeus, to please Augustus.

Serv.
ad Ecl.
10, 1, ‘Fuit Cornelius Gallus amicus
Vergilii, adeo ut quartus Georgicorum a medio usque ad
finem eius laudes teneret, quas postea iubente Augusto
in Aristaei fabulam commutavit.’

Sources of the Georgics.
—Besides his own observation,
Virgil used the following authorities:

1. Hesiod—mostly in Book i.,
e.g.
ll. 276-286 (lucky
and unlucky days). Cf. ii. 176,

‘Ascraeumque cano Romana per oppida carmen.’

2. Books of the priests;
e.g.
i. 269
sqq.
(what is lawful
on holy days), i. 338
sqq.
(Ambarvalia).

3. For agriculture and natural history—Greek writers
like Aristotle, Theophrastus, Democritus, and Xenophon;
and Latin writers like Cato and Varro.

4. Alexandrian writers for science and mythology;
e.g.

Eratosthenes for i. 233, ‘quinque tenent caelum zonae,’ etc.;
i. 351-465, signs of weather, from the
ÎÎ¹Î¿ÏÎ·Î¼Îµá¿Î±
of Aratus;
iii. 425
sqq.
, the Calabrian serpent, from the
ÎÎ·ÏÎ¹Î±ÎºÎ¬
of
Nicander, whose writings were also used for the subject
of bees in Book iv.

5. Lucretius, to whom Virgil is chiefly indebted, ii. 475

sqq.
, especially 490
sqq.
, ‘felix qui potuit,’ etc., refers to
Lucretius. The idea of Lucretius, cf. v. 206-217, that
man has a perpetual struggle with nature, is reflected in
Virgil, but modified by his acceptance of the argument
from design. Cf. i. 99,

‘
Exercet
que frequens tellurem atque
imperat
arvis,’

and the whole passage i. 118-159. Lucretian science is
borrowed in passages like i. 89,

‘Seu pluris calor ille vias et caeca relaxat

spiramenta, novas veniat qua sucus in herbas’;

l. 415-423 (of the habits of birds); iii. 242
sqq.
(on the
passion of love). Notice also, with Munro, Lucretian
phrases like
principio
,
quod superest
,
his animadversis
,
nunc
age
,
praeterea
,
nonne vides
,
contemplator
,
genitalia semina
.

Political purpose of the Georgics.
—The political purpose
of the Georgics is to help the policy of Augustus, which
aimed at checking the depopulation of the country districts.
Cf. i. 498-514, and especially ll. 506-7,

‘Non ullus aratro

dignus honos: squalent abductis arva colonis.’

The Emperor is introduced throughout as the object of
veneration. Cf. i. 24-42.

Natural scenery.
—Virgil dwells on Nature in her softer
aspects. Cf. phrases like ii. 470, ‘mollesque sub arbore
somni,’ and the passage ii. 458-540 in praise of a country
life. For the praise of Italy see the beautiful passage
ii. 136-176, where special districts are mentioned.

Aeneid
.—Even before the
Eclogues
were written, Virgil
had meditated the composition of an epic, perhaps, as
Servius suggests, on the kings of Alba. Cf.
Ecl.
6, 3,

‘Cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem

vellit et admonuit: “pastorem, Tityre, pingues

pascere oportet oves, deductum dicere carmen.”’

The idea of a poem in honour of Augustus was present
to his mind when he wrote
Georg.
iii. 46,

‘Mox tamen ardentes accingar dicere pugnas

Caesaris.’

The
Aeneid
was commenced
B.C.
29, and remained
unfinished at Virgil’s death.

Servius,
vit. Verg.
, ‘postea ab Augusto Aeneidem propositam
scripsit annis undecim, sed nec emendavit nec
edidit.’

His method of working at the poem is thus described
by Donatus, ‘Aeneida prosa prius oratione formatam digestamque
in xii. libros particulatim componere instituit, prout
liberet quidque et nihil in ordinem arripiens. Ut ne quid
impetum moraretur, quaedam imperfecta transmisit, alia
levissimis verbis veluti fulsit, quae per iocum pro tibicinibus
interponi aiebat ad sustinendum opus donec solidae columnae
advenirent.’

In what order the Books were written it is impossible to
decide; but Book vi. was not read to Augustus till after
the death of the young Marcellus,
B.C.
23.

Donatus, ‘Cui [Augusto] multo post perfectaque demum
materia tres omnino libros recitavit, secundum quartum
sextum, sed hunc notabili Octaviae adfectione, quae cum
recitationi interesset ad illos de filio suo versus, “Tu Marcellus
eris,” defecisse fertur atque aegre focillata est.’

Virgil, writing to the emperor, insists on the magnitude
of the task he had rashly undertaken.

Macrob.
Saturn.
i. 24, 11, ‘Tanta incohata res est, ut
paene vitio mentis tantum opus ingressus mihi videar, cum
praesertim, ut scis, alia quoque studia ad id opus multoque
potiora impertiar.’

Although in his will Virgil left instructions to Varius (and
Tucca) to destroy all his unpublished manuscripts, Varius
was expressly desired by Augustus to revise and publish
the
Aeneid
.

Donatus, ‘Egerat cum Vario, priusquam Italia decederet,
ut si quid sibi accidisset Aeneida combureret; sed is
facturum se pernegarat ... Edidit autem auctore Augusto
Varius, sed summatim emendata, ut qui versus etiam imperfectos
sicut erant reliquerit.’

This account is corroborated by Pliny the elder,
N.H.

vii. 114, Gellius, and Macrobius.

The rules laid down to the editors by the Emperor were,
according to Servius, ‘ut superflua demerent, nihil adderent
tamen.’

It seems probable that the
Aeneid
was published
B.C.
17,
for it is in the
Carmen Saeculare
of that year that Horace
first alludes to the story of Aeneas (cf. l. 50, ‘clarus Anchisae
Venerisque sanguis’), and in the fourth Book of the
Odes

(four years later) it is more than once introduced.

The
choice of the subject
was influenced (1) by the personal
desire of the Emperor; (2) by the connexion of the
Caesarian house with Venus, through Iulus;
[51]
cf. the
invention of Atys (
Aen.
v. 568) by Virgil to please Augustus,
whose mother was Atia; (3) by Virgil’s design to write
an epic on the greatness of Rome, in the manner of
Homer.

The Aeneas Legend.
—Stesichorus of Himera, among
other writers, made Aeneas, a Homeric hero (cf.
Il.
xx.
307-8), settle in Italy; and Naevius is said to have adopted
the legend in the form given by Timaeus, the Sicilian
historian of the third century
B.C.
The legend probably
arose from the worship of Aphrodite on the coasts of Italy,
and was disseminated by the Greeks of Cumae to please
the Romans. The connexion of Rome with Troy had
been officially recognized for two hundred years (cf. Sueton.

Claud.
25), and, though not a popular belief, had been
accepted in literature from the time of Naevius.

Sources of the Aeneid.
—1. Earlier Roman poets as Naevius,
Ennius, Pacuvius, Accius, Lucilius, Hostius, Varro Atacinus,
Lucretius. For details see under these names.

2. Cato’s
Origines
and Varro’s
Antiquitates
, for Italian
legends and peoples.

3.
Ius pontificium
and
ius augurale
, as found in the books
of sacred colleges (Macrob. i. 24, 16). Cf. the ritual
meaning of
porricio
(v. 776),
porrigo
(viii. 274), the habit
of praying with veiled head (iii. 405), prayer to Apollo of
Soracte (xi. 785).

4. Greek sources: (
a
) particularly the
Iliad
and
Odyssey
,
but also the Homeric Hymns and Cyclic Poems. Thus
the games in Book v. = the games in honour of Patroclus
in
Il.
xxiii.; the shield of Aeneas (viii. 626-731) = the shield
of Achilles in
Il.
xviii.; (
b
) Apollonius Rhodius, for the
passion of Dido = that of Medea; (
c
) Greek tragedies,
e.g.

the lost
Laocoon
of Sophocles for ii. 40
sqq.

Religion in the
Aeneid.
—1. The mythology is mainly from
Homer. From Latin myths come Faunus, Saturnus, Janus,
Picus. Euhemerism is shown by the last three being represented
as originally kings of Rome.

2. The power of the gods is denoted by
fatum
or
fata
;
cf. x. 112-3,

‘rex Iuppiter omnibus idem:

fata viam invenient.’

3. The description of the lower world in Book vi. is
from the descent into Hades in
Od.
xi., but is modified
by Pythagorean ideas (vi. 748-751, metempsychosis), Stoic
ideas (vi. 724
sqq.
, pantheism, cf.
Georg.
iv. 219-227)
and Platonic myths (
e.g.
in the
Gorgias
,
Phaedo
, and

Republic
), and rendered more definite by the introduction
of heroes of the Republic. Note that Virgil emphasizes
its mythical nature by dismissing Aeneas through the ivory
gate (of false dreams).

4. Other beliefs: (
a
) The golden bough (vi. 203-9)
compared to the mistletoe, the symbol of the lower world
with many Indo-European peoples; (
b
) Divinities attached
to special places,
e.g.
viii. 349-354 of the
religio
attaching
to the Capitol, ii. 351-2 guardian deities: cf. Carmentis,
pater Tiberinus, etc.; (
c
) Worship of the dead, and belief
in their continued influence on human affairs, iii. 66-8,
301-5.

Political significance.
—1. The pre-eminence of the Julian
race and of Augustus himself. Cf. i. 286,

‘Nascetur pulchra Troianus origine Caesar,

imperium Oceano, famam qui terminet astris,

Iulius, a magno demissum nomen Iulo.’

So vi. 789
sqq.

2. The idea of empire: cf. i. 33,

‘Tantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem’;

and of Rome as the conqueror and civilizer of the world:
vi. 851,

‘Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento:

hae tibi erunt artes, pacisque imponere morem,

parcere subiectis et debellare superbos.’

3. The unity of Italy with Rome is seen in Aeneas
and Turnus, representing respectively the
pietas
and the
martial courage of a past age. This is brought out also
by the introduction of local names. Cf. vii. 682-5, 710-7,
797-802.

4. Virgil shows here and there contempt for pure democracy:
vi. 815,

‘iactantior Ancus

nunc quoque iam nimium gaudens popularibus auris.’

Cf. also i. 148-9.

Authors influenced by Virgil.
—Livy, Tacitus, Ovid,
Tibullus, Propertius, Manilius, Lucan, Silius Italicus,
Statius, Valerius Flaccus, Martial, Juvenal, the author of

Aetna
. See under each.

HORACE.

(1) LIFE.

Our chief source of information about Horace is his
own works, and some important details are added in a
life of him by Suetonius.

Horace’s full name is Quintus (
Sat.
ii. 6, 37) Horatius
(
Od.
iv. 6, 44) Flaccus (
Sat.
ii. 1, 18). He was born
8th December,
B.C.
65, at Venusia in Apulia, on the frontier
of Lucania.

Sueton.
vit. Hor.
, ‘Natus est vi. Id. Decembr. L. Cotta
et L. Torquato coss.’

Ep.
i. 20, 26-8,

‘Forte meum siquis te percontabitur aevum,

me quater undenos sciat inplevisse Decembris

collegam Lepidum quo duxit Lollius anno.’

Sat.
i. 1, 34,

‘Lucanus an Appulus anceps:

nam Venusinus arat finem sub utrumque colonus.’

There are a great many references to Apulia in Horace.
So
Od.
iii. 4, 9
sqq.
,

‘Me fabulosae Volture in Appulo

nutricis extra limina Pulliae’ (his nurse’s name), etc.

All Roman virtues are attributed to the Apulians, as in

Od.
i. 22, 13; iii. 5, 9;
Epod.
ii. 39-42.

Horace, though free-born (
Sat.
i. 6, 7) was the son of
a freedman, who was by profession a collector of debts,
or, according to others, a fishmonger. To this last
story Horace probably refers with proud humility in

Ep.
ii. 2, 60,

‘Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigro.’

Sueton.
vit. Hor.
, ‘Patre, ut ipse tradit, libertino et
auctionum coactore, ut vero creditum est, salsamentario.’

Sat.
i. 6, 6,

‘Ut me libertino patre natum’;

ibid.
85,

‘Nec timuit, sibi ne vitio quis verteret olim,

si praeco parvas aut, ut fuit ipse, coactor

mercedes sequerer.’

Stories of his childhood are given,
Od.
iii. 4, 9
sqq.
;

Sat.
i. 9, 29
sqq.
;
Sat.
ii. 2, 112
sqq.

Horace speaks highly of his father, who took him from
the village school to Rome for his education. After
speaking of his own freedom from vice he says (
Sat.

i. 6, 71
sqq.
),

‘Causa fuit pater his, qui macro pauper agello

noluit in Flavi ludum me mittere, ...

sed puerum est ausus Romam portare docendum

artis quas doceat quivis eques atque senator

semet prognatos. Vestem servosque sequentis,

in magno ut populo, si qui vidisset, avita

ex re praeberi sumptus mihi crederet illos.

Ipse mihi custos incorruptissimus omnis

circum doctores aderat.’

He received instruction, both in Latin and Greek, from
Orbilius,
[52]
a teacher of conservative tendencies.
Ep.

ii. 1, 69,

‘Non equidem insector delendave carmina Livi

esse reor, memini quae plagosum mihi parvo

Orbilium dictare.’

Ep.
ii. 2, 41,

‘Romae nutriri mihi contigit atque doceri

iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles.’

His education was continued at Athens.
Ep.
ii. 2, 43,

‘Adiecere bonae paulo plus artis Athenae,

scilicet ut vellem curvo dignoscere rectum

atque inter silvas Academi quaerere verum.’

His studies were interrupted by the civil war; he joined
Brutus (who came to Athens in August,
B.C.
44), was by
him appointed
tribunus militum
, and took part in the
battle of Philippi,
B.C.
42.
Ep.
ii. 2, 46,

‘Dura sed emovere loco me tempora grato

civilisque rudem belli tulit aestus in arma

Caesaris Augusti non responsura lacertis.’

Od.
ii. 7, 9,

‘Philippos et celerem fugam

sensi, relicta non bene parmula.’

In
Sat.
i. 7 Horace relates a scene at Clazomenae before
Brutus and his staff; and in
Ep.
i. 11 he speaks, as if with
personal knowledge, of places in Asia Minor and the
islands of the Aegean, which he probably visited then.
He refers to the hardships of war in
Od.
ii. 6, 7; ii. 7, 1;
iii. 4, 26.

After the civil war his paternal property was confiscated,
probably in
B.C.
41, and his poverty compelled him to
seek the post of a clerk in the quaestor’s office, and, as
he says, to write verses. (Some satires and epodes were
then written.)

Sueton.
vit. Hor.
, ‘Victis partibus, venia inpetrata,
scriptum quaestorium comparavit.’

Sat.
ii. 6, 36,

‘De re communi scribae magna atque nova te

orabant hodie meminisses, Quinte, reverti.’

Ep.
ii. 2, 49,

‘Unde simul primum me dimisere Philippi,

decisis humilem pennis inopemque paterni

et laris et fundi paupertas inpulit, audax

ut versus facerem.’

In the spring of
B.C.
38 Horace was introduced to
Maecenas
[53]
by Varius and Virgil, and became intimate
with him in the winter of
B.C.
38-7.

Sueton.
vit. Hor.
, ‘Primo Maecenati, mox Augusto insinuatus
non mediocrem in amborum amicitia locum tenuit.
Maecenas quanto opere eum dilexerit satis testatur illo
epigrammate:

“Ni te visceribus meis, Horati,

plus iam diligo, tu tuum sodalem

Ninnio videas strigosiorem”:

sed multo magis extremis iudiciis tali ad Augustum elogio:
“Horati Flacci ut mei esto memor!”’

Sat.
i. 6, 54,

‘Optimus olim

Vergilius, post hunc Varius dixere quid essem ...

Abeo, et revocas nono post mense iubesque       (l. 61)

esse in amicorum numero.’

In
Sat.
ii. 6, 40-58 Horace describes how intimate he
was socially with Maecenas, who, however, did not make
him a confidant in political matters. The most noteworthy
event of this period is described in
Sat.
i. 5, viz. Horace’s
journey to Brundisium in the train of Maecenas and
Cocceius, who went to arrange some matters between
Augustus and Antony. His companions were Virgil,
Varius, Plotius, and the Greek rhetorician, Heliodorus.
Plotius, Virgil, and Varius are thus referred to (
Sat.
i.
5, 41):

‘Animae quales neque candidiores

terra tulit neque quis me sit devinctior alter.’
[54]

In
B.C.
34 Maecenas gave Horace an estate in the
country of the Sabines. The question of its position was
settled last century by the abbÃ© Capmartin de Chaupy.
The only place that suits Horace’s description is east of
Tivoli, and in the neighbourhood of Vicovaro, which is
the same as the Varia of Horace (
Ep.
i. 14, 3), the market-town
of his tenants. Near it is the stream Licenza, the
Digentia of Horace, on which stands Bardela (the Mandela
of Hor.).
Ep.
i. 18, 104,

‘Me quotiens reficit gelidus Digentia rivus,

quem Mandela bibit, rugosus frigore pagus.’

The site of his villa may be pretty closely determined
from
Ep.
i. 10, 49,

‘Haec tibi dictabam post fanum putre Vacunae.’

Vacuna is a Sabine goddess, identified with Victoria: near
the village an inscription has been found which was erected
by Vespasian, ‘Aedem Victoriae vetustate dilapsam sua
impensa restituit,’ and the natural inference is that this is
the temple mentioned by Horace.
[55]
Horace stayed a great
deal at his country-house, and his works contain many
references to it.

Sueton.
vit. Hor.
, ‘Vixit plurimum in secessu ruris sui
Sabini aut Tiburtini, domusque eius ostenditur circa
Tiburni luculum.’

Sat.
ii. 6, 16,

‘Ubi me in mentis et in arcem ex urbe removi.’

Other references are
Ep.
i. 16, 1-14;
Od.
ii. 18, 14.

Augustus having tried unsuccessfully to induce Horace to
become his secretary, was not offended at the poet’s refusal,
but continued to bestow his favour upon him.

Sueton.
vit. Hor.
, ‘Augustus epistularum quoque ei
officium obtulit, ut hoc ad Maecenatem scripto significat:
“Ante ipse sufficiebam scribendis epistulis amicorum, nunc
occupatissimus et infirmus Horatium nostrum a te cupio
abducere. Veniet ergo ab ista parasitica mensa ad hanc
regiam et nos in epistulis scribendis adiuvabit.” Ac ne
recusanti quidem aut succensuit quicquam aut amicitiam
suam ingerere desiit ... unaque et altera liberalitate locupletavit.’

Horace composed for Augustus the
Carmen Saeculare
;

Od.
iv. 4; iv. 14, celebrating the victories of Augustus’
step-sons over the Rhaetians and the Vindelici; also

Ep.
ii. 1.

Sueton.
vit. Hor.
, ‘Scripta quidem eius usque adeo
probavit mansuraque perpetuo opinatus est, ut non modo
Saeculare carmen componendum iniunxerit sed et Vindelicam
victoriam Tiberii Drusique privignorum suorum eumque
coegerit propter hoc tribus carminum libris ex longo intervallo
quartum addere; post sermones vero quosdam lectos
nullam sui mentionem habitam ita sit questus: “Irasci me
tibi scito, quod non in plerisque eius modi scriptis mecum
potissimum loquaris; an vereris ne apud posteros infame
tibi sit, quod videaris familiaris nobis esse?” expresseritque
eclogam ad se, cuius initium est:

“Cum tot sustineas et tanta negotia solus,”’ etc. (
Ep.
ii. 1).

Horace died 27th November,
B.C.
8, and was buried near
Maecenas. He appointed Augustus his heir.

Sueton.
vit. Hor.
, ‘Decessit v. Kal. Decembris C. Marcio
Censorino et C. Asinio Gallo coss. lvii. aetatis anno, herede
Augusto palam nuncupato; ... et conditus est extremis
Esquiliis iuxta Maecenatis tumulum.’

In personal appearance Horace was ‘brevis atque obesus,’
according to Suetonius, who quotes a joke of Augustus on
the subject: ‘Vereri autem mihi videris ne maiores libelli
tui sint, quam ipse es; sed tibi statura deest, corpusculum
non deest.’ Cf. Hor.
Ep.
i. 20, 24,

‘Corporis exigui, praecanum, solibus aptum,

irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis essem’;

Ep.
i. 4, 15,

‘Me pinguem et nitidum bene curata cute vises,

cum ridere voles, Epicuri de grege porcum.’

Cf. also
Ep.
i. 7, 25;
Od.
iii. 14, 25.

(2) WORKS.

Chronology of the Works.
—(1)
Satirae
, in two Books
(called
Sermones
in all the
MSS.
).

Book i. It is clear from
Sat.
ii. 6, 40 that Horace was
introduced to Maecenas in the spring of
B.C.
38. Now all
the references to Maecenas, with the exception of the prologue
in
Sat.
1 (written last), are in the second half of the
book, there being no mention of him in
Sat.
2; 3; and 4.
It is therefore probable that these three Satires were written
when Horace knew Varius and Virgil, but not Maecenas,

i.e.

B.C.
40-38.
Sat.
2 is probably the oldest we have, as
is shown by other considerations, and by the number of
archaisms it contains.
Sat.
5 (on the journey to Brundisium)
was written shortly after the spring of
B.C.
37, when
the events recorded took place. The date of the publication
of the book cannot be exactly fixed, the only clue we have
being the reference in
Sat.
i. 10, 86, to Bibulus, the political
agent of Antony, whose presence in Rome
B.C.
35
may be referred to. It cannot be proved that
Sat.
i. 1,
114
sqq.
, is imitated from Verg.
Georg.
i. 512
sqq.
, published

B.C.
35.

Book ii. and the
Epodes
were published in
B.C.
30 about
the same time. We have references to Actium (
B.C.
31),
as in
Sat.
ii. 5, 63; and
Sat.
ii. 1 (written last) speaks
of Augustus (ll. 11-15) as the hero in war, not yet the
bringer of peace, and was probably therefore composed
before the temple of Janus was shut in the beginning of

B.C.
29.

(2)
Epodon liber
,
B.C.
30, as above.
Epod.
9 was written
shortly after the battle of Actium, 2nd September,
B.C.
31,
before it was known whither Antony had fled.

(3)
Carmina
(Odes) Books i.-iii., published
B.C.
23. In

Od.
i. 12, 45,

‘Crescit occulto velut arbor aevo

fama Marcellis,’

we have a reference to the marriage in
B.C.
25 of Augustus’
daughter, Julia, to his nephew, Marcellus. Marcellus died
in the autumn of
B.C.
23, and the lines must have been
written before his death.
Od.
ii. 10 and iii. 19 contain
references to Licinius Murena, brother of Terentia, Maecenas’
wife. Murena was executed for his share in the
conspiracy of Fannius Caepio in the end of
B.C.
23, and
it is improbable that Horace could have made these
references after that event.
[56]

(4)
Epistles
, Book i., published
B.C.
20. The date is
fixed by
Ep.
i. 20, 26-8, already quoted,
p. 164
.

The year referred to is
B.C.
21, and the book was therefore
composed in
B.C.
20, before December of that year.

(5)
Carmen Saeculare
, composed for the
Ludi Saeculares

of
B.C.
17 (see Sueton.
quoted above
). An inscription
commemorating these games was discovered in 1890 on
the left bank of the Tiber, and in it Horace is mentioned:
‘Sacrificioque perfecto pueri xxvi. quibus denuntiatum erat
patrimi et matrimi et puellae totidem carmen cecinerunt
eodemque modo in Capitolio. Carmen composuit Q.
Horatius Flaccus.’
[57]

(6)
Odes
, Book iv., published
B.C.
13.
Od.
4 and 14
celebrate the campaign of Drusus and Tiberius in Rhaetia
and Vindelicia
B.C.
15.
Od.
2 and 5 were written just
before Augustus’ return,
B.C.
13, from Gaul, where he had
been since
B.C.
16.

(7)
Epistles
, Book ii.
Ep.
ii. 1, to Augustus, was written

B.C.
14 in response (see the quotation from Suetonius above)
to the emperor’s request for a poem addressed to himself,
after seeing that no mention was made of him in
Ep.
ii. 2
and the
Epistula ad Pisones
. These are the
sermones
quidam
(both, like
Ep.
ii. 1, on literary criticism) referred
to by Suetonius, and not Book i. of the Epistles, where
Augustus is frequently mentioned. The date is fixed by
l. 15, ‘praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores,’ etc., referring
to the worship of the
numen Augusti
, which was legalized

B.C.
14, and by the reference in ll. 252
sqq.
to the victories
of Drusus and Tiberius, and their celebration in
Od.
iv.
4; iv. 14.
Ep.
ii. 2 (to Iulius Florus) was written
B.C.
18.
Horace hints (l. 25, ll. 84-6) that he has not yet returned
to lyric poetry; the epistle was therefore written before

B.C.
17. The
Epistula ad Pisones
or
De Arte Poetica
was
probably written
B.C.
17 or 16 after the
Carmen Saeculare
,
but before Horace had entered on the composition of the
fourth Book of the Odes.

The
Satires
are called
Sermones
in all the
MSS.
, but as
Horace gave this name both to his Satires (
Sat.
i. 4, 42)
and to his Epistles (
Ep.
ii. 1, 4; 250) it is convenient to
call them
Satirae
, the name which Horace also gives them
(
Sat.
ii. 1, 1; 6, 17), and which represent their intended
scope. Horace’s chief model is Lucilius, whom he wished
to adapt to the Augustan age.
Sat.
i. 4, 56,

‘his, ego quae nunc,

olim quae scripsit Lucilius.’

So
Sat.
ii. 1, 28 and 74. Lucilius’ influence is seen most
in
Sat.
i. 2; 5; 7; 8; ii. 2; 3; 4; 8. Horace, after the
reception
Sat.
i. 2 met with, did not, like Lucilius, attack
individuals; nor did his position as a dependent (
Sat.
ii. 1,
60-79) allow him to do so. We find, therefore, no political
satire in Horace, who confines himself to social and literary
topics. He does not attack his contemporaries by name,
but (
a
) takes some names from Lucilius, as Albucius (
Sat.

ii. 1, 48), Opimius (
Sat.
ii. 3, 142); (
b
) invents ‘tell-tale-names,’
as Pantolabus (
Sat.
i. 8, 11), Novius (
Sat.
i. 3, 21).
In
Sat.
i. 4 and ii. 1 he defines the moral and social aim
of his satire. In
Sat.
i. 4, 1-13 he criticizes Lucilius’ style;
this seems to have given offence, and in
Sat.
i. 10 he gives
reasons for his former criticism. Horace’s Epicureanism
is more pronounced in Book i. than in Book ii. In
Sat.
i.
1 and i. 3 (cf. ll. 99-124) the influence of Lucretius is seen.
In i. 3 he takes up an antagonistic position to Stoicism
(cf. ll. 124-142). In ii. 3 he shows less hostility to Stoicism
though he still criticizes it.
[58]
In
Sat.
ii. 7, where the slave
Davus enunciates the Stoic doctrine,
á½
ÏÎ¹ Î¼ÏÎ½Î¿Ï á½ ÏÎ¿Ïá½¸Ï á¼Î»ÎµÏÎ¸ÎµÏÎ¿Ï
,
Davus’ arguments from l. 75 onwards have been
taken by Horace from Cic.
Parad.
5.

Horace does not pretend that his Satires (or Epistles)
are poetry, and makes several statements to that effect.

Sat.
ii. 6, 17,

‘Quid prius inlustrem satiris musaque pedestri?’

Ep.
ii. 1, 250,

‘Sermones ... repentes per humum.’

So
Sat.
i. 4, 39-44.

The
Epodes
are called
Epodi
in the
MSS.

á¼Ïá¿³Î´ÏÏ
was
the name given to a piece composed of couplets, the first
line of which is longer than the second. Horace calls
them
iambi
(
Epod.
14, 7;
Od.
i. 16, 3). Their style is an
imitation of that of Archilochus of Paros.
Ep.
i. 19, 23-5,

‘Parios ego primus iambos

ostendi Latio, numeros animosque secutus

Archilochi, non res et agentia verba Lycamben.’

This is seen in the personal attacks made in many of
them, as well as in the
Î±á¼°ÏÏÏÎ¿Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±
employed, and also in
the versification. The dates of several can be fixed.
Epod.

16 was written
B.C.
41, and refers to the Perusian war.
Horace takes no part with either side, but advises his
countrymen to leave Rome, like the Phocaeans of old.

Epod.
7 was written
B.C.
39; and
Epod.
1, 9, and 14,
about
B.C.
31. The order is strictly metrical. Epodes
1-10 are simple iambics (trimeter and dimeter alternately);
11-16 more complicated forms; 17, the last, in iambic trimeters.

The
Odes
Horace himself calls
carmina
. The metres
are nearly all taken from Sappho and Alcaeus, the two
poets whose works Horace wished to present to his countrymen
in a Roman dress. Cf.
Od.
iii. 30, 13-4,

‘Princeps Aeolium carmen ad Italos

deduxisse modos.’

The metrical differences between himself and his originals
are due to the difference in the genius of the two languages
and to the fact that he adopted the views on metre
current in his time. Catullus’ metre, on the other hand,
was closely modelled on that of the Alexandrian poets.
The odes are largely founded on the best Greek lyric
poetry, with which Horace was thoroughly familiar; cf.
his first intention to write in Greek (
Sat.
i. 10, 31-5).
Alexandrian influence is little seen, and his mythological
allusions are seldom obscure. Examples of imitation
(which is commonest in Book i.) are:
Od.
i. 9, the
beginning of which is from Alcaeus (so i. 10; 11; 18);
i. 12 (beginning) is from Pindar; i. 27 from Anacreon.
Bacchylides is imitated,
e.g.
in ii. 18.

Subjects of the Odes.
—1. Love and wine form the themes
of many.
Od.
i. 6, 17,

‘Nos convivia, nos proelia virginum

sectis in iuvenes unguibus acrium

cantamus.’

Cf.
Od.
ii. 1, 37-40; iii. 3, 69-72.

The love-poems show no trace of personal passion, and
the names of the women whose charms are sung are taken
from Greek; thus Pyrrha (a well-known name from Attic
comedy) i. 5; Lydia, i. 13, etc.; Lalage, i. 22; ii. 5.
Cinara (iv. 1; iv. 13) is probably the only one that
represents a real person. Wine is celebrated,
e.g.
in i. 9;
18; 27; ii. 7; iii. 21. A tone of moderation is observed
throughout the drinking-songs. It is highly probable
[59]
that
in
Od.
i. 27, 1-4 the unrestrained bacchanalian spirit of
Catullus (cf. c. 27) is reproved,

‘Natis in usum laetitiae scyphis

pugnare Thracum est. Tollite barbarum

morem verecundumque Bacchum

sanguineis prohibete rixis.’

2. In
Od.
i. 24 we have the beautiful dirge on the
death of Quintilius Varus.

3.
On political subjects.
—The chief of these are as
follows: i. 2 (towards the end of
B.C.
28); i. 12; i. 14;
i. 35 (in
B.C.
26); i. 37 (in
B.C.
30); ii. 1. The most
important, however, are
Od.
iii. 1-6, which form one whole,
and are written on the new name of Augustus, and the
ideas therewith connected. They were all written about

B.C.
27.
[60]

In iii. 1, which is general, the rising generation is
addressed by the prophet of the empire; ll. 3, 4,

‘Musarum sacerdos

virginibus puerisque canto.’

The lesson of the ode is ‘A moderate life is the best.
Lucky is the man who is spared the trouble of managing
the State.’

iii. 2 praises courage and honesty, but with special
reference to two institutions of Augustus: (1) the professional
soldier as opposed to the citizen-soldier of the
republic. The officers were taken from the two privileged
classes, and there was no promotion from the ranks. This
is the explanation of ll. 1-4,

‘Angustam amice pauperiem pati

robustus acri militia puer

condiscat et Parthos ferocis

vexet eques,’

lines which also refer to the resuscitation by Augustus
of the citizen-cavalry. The soldier is not to trouble
about politics (ll. 17-20), and must not fear death (l. 13).
(2) The new imperial administrative officers, employed
not only in collecting taxes, but in administrative business
of every kind. Speaking of them, Horace pays a tribute to
loyal silence, and emphasizes the curse that clings to breach
of faith; l. 25,

‘Est et fideli tuta silentio

merces’;

l. 31,

‘Raro antecedentem scelestum

deseruit pede Poena claudo.’

iii. 3 touches intimately the political questions of the
day. Pointed reference is made to Cleopatra; she is the

mulier peregrina
(l. 20), the
Lacaena adultera
(l. 25), who
brought Troy low, and would bring Rome low, if she
and her
famosus hospes
(l. 26) could raise Troy again.
The reference here is to a report current about Antony,
that he intended to make Troy the capital. It is certain
that he intended to restore to Cleopatra her kingdom with
extended frontiers, and to make himself ruler of the Eastern
empire. This, which would have meant the subjection of
Rome to the Greeks and half-Greeks, was prevented by
the ‘iustum et tenacem propositi virum’ (l. i), who for his
services is honoured as one of the gods; ll. 11-12,

‘Quos inter Augustus recumbens

purpureo bibit ore nectar.’

In iii. 4 the poet’s personality comes out strongest. He
describes his protection by the Muses in his early years,
and this leads him to speak of one of the monarch’s chief
works of peace, his encouragement of literature; ll. 37-40,

‘Vos Caesarem altum, militia simul

fessas cohortes abdidit oppidis,

finire quaerentem labores

Pierio recreatis antro.’

iii. 5 is a defence of Augustus’ foreign policy. Publicly
he kept up Caesar’s war policy, hence ll. 2-5,

‘Praesens divus habebitur

Augustus adiectis Britannis

imperio gravibusque Persis’;

but that this concealed his real policy of non-intervention
is shown by his action regarding Parthia. Hence Horace,
by a speech put into the mouth of Regulus (l. 18
sqq.
)
warns the Romans against trying to rescue the survivors
of Crassus’ army, who, by becoming captives, had ceased
to be citizens. That some of the Senate wished to interfere
in this matter is probably shown by ll. 45-6,

‘Donec labantis consilio patres

firmaret auctor numquam alias dato.’

iii. 6 refers (ll. 1-8) to Augustus’ policy in restoring the
ancient religion, as is seen by the fact that he rebuilt
82 temples. Lines 21-32 refer to a law of Augustus on
adultery, the date of which is unknown.

In Book iv., Odes 2, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, are political. They
show traces of adulation, and sing the praises rather of
the imperial family than of the nation. Cf. iv. 2, 37
(of Augustus),

‘Quo nihil maius meliusve terris

fata donavere bonique divi,’ etc.

The
Epistles
.—
Sermones
is the name given them by
Horace; they are also called
Epistulae
in the
MSS.
Social,
ethical, and literary questions are treated of, and the style
is much more careful than that of the Satires. The motto,
one might say, of the book is
Ep.
i. 1, 10.

‘Nunc itaque et versus et cetera ludicra pono:

quid verum atque decens, curo et rogo et omnis in hoc sum.’

The dates of
Ep.
ii. 1, 2, have already been mentioned.
Both treat of literary criticism, and the first deals particularly
with that of the drama. Iulius Florus, to whom

Ep.
ii. 2 is addressed, was the representative of the younger
literary school at Rome. The
Epistula ad Pisones
or

De Arte Poetica
is an essay in verse on literary criticism,
specially pointing out how necessary art is to composition.
In it, according to Porphyrion, Horace ‘congessit praecepta
Neoptolemi
ÏÎ¿á¿¦ Î Î±ÏÎ¹Î±Î½Î¿á¿¦
[61]
de arte poetica, non
quidem omnia, sed eminentissima.’ Horace probably was
also indebted to Aristotle’s
Poetics
. Porphyrion says that
Horace wrote the
Ars Poetica
‘ad L. Pisonem qui postea
urbis custos fuit eiusque liberos.’ This does not fit in
with the probable date,
B.C.
17 or 16, as L. Piso was born

B.C.
49, and his sons could not have been old enough for
the letter to be addressed to them. It is probable that
Porphyrion is wrong, and that the
A.P.
was addressed to
Cn. Piso, who served with Horace under Brutus, and his
two sons.

Horace and nature.
—Besides references to his Sabine
villa, Horace refers to natural scenery in many passages.
Such are
Epod.
2;
Od.
i. 7, 10; ii. 6, 13; iii. 13, 9;
Sat.
ii.
6, 1
sqq.
;
Ep.
i. 10, 6
sqq.
, i. 16, 1
sqq.
[62]
Horace is fond
of comparing dangers to the plague of floods,
[63]
a plague
from which Italy has always suffered. Cf.
Od.
i. 31, 7,

‘rura quae Liris quieta

mordet aqua taciturnus amnis.’

So
Od.
iii. 29, 32
sqq.
, and many other passages.

Popularity of Horace.
—Horace’s prediction that his works
would become school-books,
Ep.
i. 20, 17,

‘Hoc quoque te manet, ut pueros elementa docentem

occupet extremis in vicis balba senectus,’

was early fulfilled. Cf. Iuv. 7, 226,

‘Quot stabant pueri, cum totus decolor esset

Flaccus et haereret nigro fuligo Maroni.’

CONTEMPORARY POETS:

The following writers were friends of Horace:

(
a
)
C. Valgius Rufus
, consul suffectus
B.C.
12, belonged
to the circle of Maecenas (Hor.
Sat.
i. 10, 82).

Valgius’ works, of which only a few lines are extant,
included (1) Elegiae. Cf. Hor.
Od.
ii. 9, 9-12,

‘Tu semper urges flebilibus modis

Mysten ademptum, nec tibi Vespero

surgente decedunt amores

nec rapidum fugiente solem.’

(2) Epigrammata, (3) Miscellanies, (4) A translation of
Apollodorus’
ÏÎ­ÏÎ½Î·
. (See Quint. iii. 1, 18.) (5) A book
on herbs. (Pliny,
N.H.
xxv. 4.) An epic was also expected
of him, but whether written is unknown. Tibull. iv. 1, 179,

‘Est tibi, qui possit magnis se adcingere rebus,

Valgius; aeterno propior non alter Homero.’

(
b
)
M. Aristius Fuscus
, a poet and grammarian (Porphyr.
ad
Sat.
i. 9, 60);
Od.
i. 22, and
Ep.
i. 10, are addressed to him.

(
c
) The
Visci
. Comm. Cruq.
ad Sat.
i. 10, 83, ‘Visci
duo fratres fuerunt optimi poetae et iudices critici.’

(
d
)
C. Fundanius
, wrote comedies (Porphyr.
ad Sat.
i.
10, 40).

(
e
)
Servius Sulpicius
, a love poet (Ovid,
Trist.
ii. 441;
Hor.
Sat.
i. 10, 86).

(
f
)
Iulius Florus
was ‘saturarum scriptor’ (Porphyr.
ad
Hor. Ep.
i. 3, 1). Hor.
Ep.
i. 3 and ii. 2, are addressed
to him.

(
g
)
Titius
wrote Pindaric odes, and tragedies, Hor.
Ep.

i. 3, 9-14.

(
h
)
Albinovanus Celsus
. See Hor.
Ep.
i. 3, 15-7.

(
i
)
C. Iullus Antonius
,
B.C.
44-
B.C.
2, was a son of the
triumvir M. Antonius. The Schol. on Hor.
Od.
iv. 2, 2,
says of him, “Heroico metro Diomedeam scripsit et nonnulla
alia soluta oratione.”

(
k
)
Furnius
, an orator; died
B.C.
37. He is mentioned
by Hor.
Sat.
i. 10, 86.

Other poets contemporary with Virgil and Horace are:

(
a
)
L. Varius Rufus
(cf. Verg.
Ecl.
9, 35). His works
were:

(1) Epics (
a
) on the death of Julius Caesar (Macrob.

Saturn.
vi. 1, 39), (
b
) in praise of Augustus. Hor.
Ep.

i. 16, 27-29 is a quotation from this poem (Acron
ad loc.
),
and it is probably referred to in
Od.
i. 6, 1 (to Agrippa),

‘Scriberis Vario fortis et hostium

victor Maeonii carminis aliti,

quam rem cumque ferox navibus aut equis

miles te duce gesserit.’

(2) A tragedy,
Thyestes
, praised by Quint. x. 1, 98,
‘iam Varii Thyestes cuilibet Graecarum comparari potest.’

(3) Elegies: Porphyr. ad Hor.
Od.
i. 6, 1, ‘fuit L. Varius
et ipse carminis et tragoediarum et elegiorum auctor.’

(
b
)
Aemilius Macer
was a native of Verona, and died

B.C.
16: Jerome yr. Abr. 2001, ‘Aemilius Macer Veronensis
poeta in Asia moritur.’ He was a friend of Virgil, and
was the ‘Mopsus’ of
Ecl.
5, according to Serv.
ad loc.

Ovid in his youth enjoyed his acquaintance; cf.
Tr.
iv. 10,
43, where three didactic poems are referred to: (1)
Ornithogonia
,
on birds; (2)
Theriaca
, on venomous serpents;
(3)
De Herbis
, on plants.

For his obligations to Nicander, see under ‘Virgil,’
p. 158
.
Quintilian calls him ‘humilis’ (x. 1, 87).

(
c
)
C. Cornelius Gallus
was born at Forum Iulii
B.C.
70,
and died by his own hand
B.C.
27. Jerome yr. Abr. 1990,
‘Cornelius Gallus Foroiuliensis poeta ... xliii. aetatis suae
anno propria se manu interficit.’ Having commanded a
division in the war against Antony, he was appointed by
Octavian the first prefect of Egypt,
B.C.
30, but incurred
his anger and was banished from Caesar’s house and
provinces (Sueton.
Aug.
66). The cause of his downfall
was indiscreet language about Augustus, according to
Ovid,
Tr.
ii. 445,

‘Non fuit opprobrio celebrasse Lycorida Gallo,

sed linguam nimio non tenuisse mero’;

and
Am.
iii. 9, 63,

‘Tu quoque, si falsum est temerati crimen amici,

sanguinis atque animae prodige, Galle, tuae.’

The tenth eclogue of Virgil is a testimony to his friendship
for Gallus, l. 2,

‘Pauca meo Gallo, sed quae legat ipsa Lycoris,

carmina sunt dicenda; neget quis carmina Gallo?’

Lines 44-49 are said by Servius,
ad loc.
, to be quoted from
Gallus (‘de ipsius translati carminibus’). For the tribute
to Gallus in the original draft of
Georgic
iv. see under
‘Virgil,’
p. 157
.

He wrote four Books of love-poems to Cytheris, the
liberta

who afterwards deserted him for Antony: Serv.
ad Ecl.
x. 1,
‘amorum suorum de Cytheride scripsit libros iv.’ According
to Servius he also translated the poems of Euphorion of
Chalcis. Cf. Verg.
Ecl.
x. 50,

‘Ibo et Chalcidico quae sunt mihi condita versu

carmina pastoris Siculi modulabor avena.’

Compared with Tibullus and Propertius, he was ‘durior’
(Quint. x. 1, 93).

(
d
)
Codrus
, mentioned by Virgil,
Ecl.
7, 22 and 26; 5, 11,
was a contemporary poet (Serv.
ad Ecl.
7), and was praised
by Valgius (Schol. Veron.
ad loc.
), but nothing is known
of his writings. The name is not Roman, and is probably
a disguised form of Cordus. He is sometimes identified
with the Iarbitas of Hor.
Ep.
i. 19, 15.

(
e
)
Bavius
and
Mevius
were enemies of Virgil and
Horace. Verg.
Ecl.
3, 90,

‘Qui Bavium non odit, amet tua carmina, Mevi.’

Horace,
Epod.
10, prays for the shipwreck of Mevius. He
wrote about the prodigal son of the actor Aesopus (Porphyr.
ad Hor.
Sat.
ii. 3, 239). Bavius died
B.C.
35, according
to Jerome.

(
f
)
Anser
wrote a poem in praise of Antony, and was
rewarded with a grant of land (Serv.
ad Ecl.
9, 36; Cic.

Phil.
xiii. 11). He is mentioned by Ovid,
Tr.
ii. 435,

‘Cinna quoque his comes est, Cinnaque procacior Anser.’

Servius sees an allusion to him in
Ecl.
9, 36,

‘Argutos inter strepere anser olores.’

TIBULLUS.

(1) LIFE.

Albius Tibullus (his praenomen was perhaps Aulus,
which, from the abbreviation A. being followed by Albius,
was lost in the
MSS.
) seems to have been born near Pedum
in Latium. (1) Horace, in
Ep.
i. 4, 2, addressed to
Tibullus, asks, ‘Quid nunc te dicam facere in regione
Pedana?’ apparently referring to the ‘sedes avitae’ of
Tibullus (Tibull. ii. 4, 53). (2) The Life contained in the
best
MSS.
, and probably to be attributed to Suetonius, calls
him ‘Albius Tibullus, eques Romanus’ (codd. Paris. and
Lips. ‘regulis’). BÃ¤hrens (
Tibullische BlÃ¤tter
) holds that

Romanus
is an erroneous correction of
regulis
, for which
he proposes to read
R.
(= Romanus)
e Gabis
(= Gabiis).
Gabii was within a short distance of Pedum.

The date of his birth can be fixed only by indirect
evidence.

(1) The Life says ‘obiit adulescens,’ and the epigram of
Domitius Marsus, found in the best
MSS.
, calls Tibullus
‘iuvenis’ at the time of his death, which must have occurred
about the same time as Virgil’s, in
B.C.
19,

‘Te quoque Vergilio comitem non aequa, Tibulle,

mors iuvenem campos misit ad Elysios,

ne foret aut elegis molles qui fleret amores

aut caneret forti regia bella pede.’

(2) Ovid (
Tr.
iv. 10, 53) says of Tibullus,

‘Successor fuit hic tibi, Galle, Propertius illi.’

Since Gallus was born
B.C.
70, and Propertius about
B.C.
49,
the birth of Tibullus must have fallen between those years.

(3) Tibullus accompanied Messalla when he left for
Aquitania,
B.C.
30 or 29, according to the Life: ‘Ante
alios Corvinum Messallam oratorem dilexit, cuius etiam
contubernalis Aquitanico bello militaribus donis donatus
est.’ Cf. Tibull. i. 7, 9,

‘Non sine me est tibi partus honos; Tarbella Pyrene

testis et Oceani litora Santonici.’

Putting together these references we may place the date
of Tibullus’ birth in
B.C.
54. (The statement of the Life
in the Codex Guelferbytanus, ‘Natus est Hyrtio et Pansa
coss.’ is clearly wrong).

He was of equestrian rank, and at one time possessed
considerable wealth, apparently inherited from a long line
of ancestors; i. 1, 41,

‘Non ego divitias patrum fructusque requiro

quos tulit antiquo condita messis avo.’

Cf. ii. 1, 1; ii. 4, 53; Hor.
Ep.
i. 4, 7,

‘Di tibi divitias dederunt.’

His family property, however, had been greatly diminished;
i. 1, 19,

‘Vos quoque, felicis quondam nunc pauperis agri

custodes, fertis munera vestra, lares:

tunc vitula innumeros lustrabat caesa iuvencos;

nunc agna exigui est hostia parva soli.’

Cf. i. 1, 5 and 37.

It has been supposed that Tibullus suffered these losses
in the agrarian disturbances of
B.C.
41, and that his lands,
like those of Virgil and Propertius, were confiscated. No
town in Latium, however, is mentioned by Appian as
having its territory thus assigned. Tibullus’ property may
possibly have been restored to him through the influence
of Messalla.
[65]
Cf. Hor.
Ep.
i. 4, 11,

‘Et mundus victus non deficiente crumena’;

also Tibull. i. 1, 77,

‘Ego composito securus acervo

despiciam dites despiciamque famem.’

Of Messalla Tibullus always speaks with the greatest affection.
He refused at first to accompany him to the East after
the battle of Actium, but afterwards followed him, and was
forced through illness to remain at Corcyra: i. 1, 53,

‘Te bellare decet terra, Messalla, marique,

ut domus hostiles praeferat exuvias:

me retinent vinctum formosae vincla puellae’;

i, 3, 3,

‘Me tenet ignotis aegrum Phaeacia terris.’

In the Aquitanian campaign he was Messalla’s
contubernalis
,
and had military distinctions conferred on him (see

p. 186
).

No further particulars of Tibullus are known, save his
love for his mistresses Delia and Nemesis, and the fact
mentioned by Ovid, in a poem on his death, that his mother
and sister survived him;
Amor.
iii. 9, 50,

‘Mater et in cineres ultima dona tulit.

Hinc soror in partem misera cum matre doloris

venit inornatas dilaniata comas.’

Delia’s real name was Plania (
Î´á¿Î»Î¿Ï
=
planus
): cf.
Apuleius,
Apol.
10, ‘eadem igitur opera accusent ...
Tibullum quod ei sit Plania in animo Delia in versu.’ She
was a
libertina
, for the name is not known as a
nomen
gentilicium
, and she had had a husband (i. 2, 41, ‘coniunx
tuus’), who appears to have been serving with the army
in Cilicia: i. 2, 65,

‘Ferreus ille fuit, qui te cum posset habere,

maluerit praedas stultus et arma sequi.

Ille licet Cilicum victas agat ante catervas,’ etc.

A divorce had probably taken place, as she was not entitled
to wear the distinctive dress of the Roman matron; i. 6, 67,

‘Sit modo casta, doce, quamvis non vitta ligatos

impediat crines nec stola longa pedes.’

Nemesis was a
meretrix
; ii. 4, 14,

‘Illa cava pretium flagitat usque manu.’

She appears to be the ‘immitis Glycera’ of Hor.
Od.
i. 33, 2,
addressed to Albius (so Kiessling
ad loc.
). Both Delia
and Nemesis are represented by Ovid as present at the
funeral of Tibullus.
Amor.
iii. 9, 53,

‘Cumque tuis sua iunxerunt Nemesisque priorque

oscula nec solos destituere rogos.’

Tibullus was on friendly terms with Horace, who
addressed to him
Od.
i. 33 and
Ep.
i. 4. Horace was
doubtless attracted by the frank nature of Tibullus (
Ep.

i. 4, 1, ‘Albi, nostrorum sermonum candide iudex’), and
by the community of taste which led them both to imitate
the classical Ionic rather than the Alexandrian elegy.
Horace corroborates the statement of Life i. (‘insignis
forma cultuque corporis observabilis’) that Tibullus had a
fine presence;
ibid.
1. 6,

‘Non tu corpus eras sine pectore: di tibi formam,

di tibi divitias dederunt artemque fruendi.’

Ovid had met and admired him, and has numerous
imitations of him in his poems; but the difference of age
and the early death of Tibullus prevented any long
acquaintance; Ovid,
Tr.
iv. 10, 51,

‘Nec amara Tibullo

tempus amicitiae fata dedere meae.’

Of friendship between Propertius and Tibullus there is no
evidence: they never mention one another.

(2) WORKS.

Four Books of elegiac poems are attributed to Tibullus,
who ranks first among Roman elegists in the view of Quintilian,
x. 1, 93, ‘Elegia quoque Graecos provocamus, cuius
mihi tersus atque elegans maxime videtur auctor Tibullus.’

Book i., on the poet’s love for Delia and Marathus
(
El.
7 is to Messalla), was published by himself, and was
apparently composed in the years
B.C.
31-27. This agrees
with Ovid,
Tr.
ii. 463,

‘Legiturque Tibullus

et placet, et iam te principe notus erat,’

if we assume that ‘principe’ refers to the title of
Augustus.

Book ii., the chief subject of which is Nemesis,
appears to have been written several years later. It is
unfinished, not having received the author’s final revision,
and was probably published soon after his death,
certainly several years before Ovid’s
Ars Amatoria
(cf.

A.A.
535
sqq.
).

Book iii. (six Elegies) is professedly the work of Lygdamus.
No poet of that name is mentioned in ancient
literature, and it has been suggested that the author may
have been a young relative of Tibullus who used a Greek
adaptation of the gentile name Albius (
Î»ÏÎ³Î´Î¿Ï
= white
marble). He speaks as a man of good social position
(iii. 2, 22). From the fact that he belonged to the circle
of Messalla, his poems came to be added to those of
Tibullus, whom he constantly imitates. There are also
many reminiscences of Horace, Ovid, and Propertius. The
six Elegies are addressed to Neaera, who was probably
the poet’s cousin and was married or betrothed to him
(iii. 1, 23; 2, 12). Lygdamus was born in the same year
as Ovid,
B.C.
43; iii. 5, 17,

‘Natalem primo nostrum videre parentes,

cum cecidit fato consul uterque pari.’

The remarkable coincidence between iii. 5, 15-20, and
Ovid,
A.A.
ii. 669-70,
Tr.
iv. 10, 6,
Amor.
ii. 14, 23-4, is
best explained by Hiller (
Hermes
, xviii. 360-1), who suggests
that Lygdamus may have composed the poem in his earlier
years merely to amuse Neaera, without publishing it, and
that after Ovid’s works had appeared he may, to oblige a
friend or patron (
e.g.
Messalinus), have published his collection
of elegies, adding in the process of revision the
lines copied from Ovid.

The remaining poems belong to Book iii. in the
MSS.
,
but in most editions are printed as a separate Book iv.
iv. 1, in hexameters, is the
Panegyricus Messallae
, written
in honour of Messalla’s consulship,
B.C.
31. Its rhetorical
exaggeration and want of taste forbid its being attributed
to Tibullus, written, as it was, so shortly before he reached
the summit of his powers. Its date puts Lygdamus out of
question: doubtless it is by some young member of
Messalla’s circle.

The rest of the Book has for its theme the love of
Sulpicia, the daughter of Servius Sulpicius and Valeria,
the sister of Messalla, for a young Greek named Cerinthus.

El.
2-6 are apparently by Tibullus himself, who may
have amused himself by turning into verse the letters of
the young lovers.
El.
7 is of disputed authorship; but
it resembles the work of Sulpicia rather than that of
Tibullus.
El.
8-12 are by Sulpicia to Cerinthus.
El.
13
purports to be by Tibullus.
El.
14 is an epigram, of
doubtful authorship.

Two
Priapea
are found in
MSS.
of Tibullus, but probably
neither of them is by him.

PROPERTIUS.

(1) LIFE.

The name by which the poet designates himself is Propertius
simply; the praenomen Sextus rests on the authority
of Donatus. The additions in some
MSS.
, ‘Aurelius’ and
‘Nauta,’ are clearly erroneous.

He was certainly a native of the district of Umbria, and
probably of the town of Asisium (the modern Assisi). Cf.
iv. 1, 121,

‘Umbria te notis antiqua penatibus edit,

(mentior? an patriae tangitur ora tuae?)

qua nebulosa cavo rorat Mevania campo,

et lacus aestivis intepet Umber aquis,

scandentisque Asisi consurgit vertice murus,

murus ab ingenio notior ille tuo.’

‘Asisi’ in l. 125 is Lachmann’s emendation for ‘Asis’ of
the
MSS.
, and is rendered almost certain by the topography
of the district. Asisium agrees better than Hispellum (the
modern Spello) with the description in the passage quoted;
with iv. 1, 65,

‘Scandentes quisquis cernet de vallibus arces,

ingenio muros aestimet ille meo’;

and with the epithet ‘proxima’ in i. 22, 9, as Asisium is
nearer than Hispellum to Perusia. Cf. i. 22, 3-10,

‘Si Perusina tibi patriae sunt nota sepulcra,

Italiae duris funera temporibus, ...

proxima supposito contingens Umbria campo

me genuit terris fertilis uberibus.’

At Assisi, moreover, have been found several inscriptions
of the Propertii, one of which, C. PASSENNO | C. F. SERG. |,
PAULLO | PROPERTIO | BLAESO,
[66]
probably refers to the Passennus
Paullus mentioned by Pliny,
Ep.
vi. 15, as ‘municeps
Propertii.’

Propertius was younger than Tibullus, and older than
Ovid. His birth, therefore, took place between
B.C.
54
and 43 (Hertzberg gives 46, Postgate prefers 50). Cf. Ovid,

Tr.
iv. 10, 53,

‘Successor fuit hic [Tibullus] tibi, Galle; Propertius illi;

quartus ab his serie temporis ipse fui.’

He came of a family well known in the neighbourhood
(cf. iv. 1, 121, ‘notis penatibus,’ already quoted), but not
‘noble’ in the technical sense; ii. 34, 55,

‘Aspice me, cui parva domi fortuna relictast,

nullus et antiquo Marte triumphus avi.’

His childhood was clouded by the early death of his
father, and by the confiscation of his estate in
B.C.
41;
iv. 1, 127,

‘Ossaque legisti non illa aetate legenda

patris; et in tenues cogeris ipse lares,

nam tua cum multi versarent rura iuvenci,

abstulit excultas pertica tristis opes.’

His mother then took him to Rome, where he studied law
for a short time after assuming the
toga virilis
, but abandoned
it in favour of poetry; iv. 1, 131,

‘Mox ubi bulla rudi demissast aurea collo,

matris et ante deos libera sumpta toga,

tum tibi pauca suo de carmine dictat Apollo

et vetat insano verba tonare foro.’

Meanwhile he was engaged in his first love affair with
Lycinna, who is otherwise unknown (iii. 15, 3
sqq.
). In

B.C.
29 or 28 his acquaintance with Cynthia began. Her
real name was Hostia (Apuleius,
Apol.
10, ‘Accusent ...
Propertium, qui Cynthiam dicat, Hostiam dissimulet’), and
she was possibly a grand-daughter of the poet Hostius
(
p. 65
). Cf. iii. 20, 8,

‘Splendidaque a docto fama refulget avo.’

A courtesan of the higher class, she is represented by
Propertius as possessed of great personal charms and varied
accomplishments (i. 2, 30, ‘Omnia quaeque Venus quaeque
Minerva probat’), combined with many faults of temper
and character. She had a house at Rome in the Subura,
and we hear of her also at Tibur, where she was buried
(iv. 7, 15; 85). She was considerably older than Propertius;
ii. 18, 19,

‘At tu etiam iuvenem odisti me, perfida, cum sis

ipsa anus haud longa curva futura die.’

At the end of two years the unfaithfulness of Propertius
led to twelve months of estrangement; iii. 16, 9,

‘Peccaram semel, et totum sum pulsus in annum.’

Cynthia was reconciled to him about the beginning of

B.C.
25; but the passion on both sides gradually cooled
until, in 23, Propertius harshly cast her off (iii. 24 and 25).
Possibly there was a second reconciliation before her death
(iv. 7). The five years of bondage (iii. 25, 3, ‘Quinque
tibi potui servire fideliter annos,’) will thus be
B.C.
28, 27,
25-23.

Propertius lived chiefly at Rome; but i. 18 was written
near the Clitumnus, and in ii. 19 he promises to join
Cynthia in that region. In iii. 21 he contemplates a voyage
to Athens; l. 1,

‘Magnum iter ad doctas proficisci cogor Athenas,

ut me longa gravi solvat amore via.’

A few years earlier he had refused to accompany his friend
Tullus to Athens and Asia (i. 6).

Nothing is known of the subsequent life of Propertius,
but from two passages in the younger Pliny it is natural
to infer that he married, in obedience to the
Lex Iulia
of

B.C.
18, and had issue. Pliny,
Ep.
vi. 15, ‘Passennus
Paullus ... inter maiores suos Propertium numerat’; ix. 22,
‘Propertium ... a quo genus ducit.’

We cannot tell even when he died. He must have been
alive in
B.C.
16, because iv. 6 was written for the
ludi
quinquennales
, which were held for the first time in that
year; and iv. 11. 65, is an allusion to the consulship of
P. Cornelius Scipio, also in
B.C.
16.

In personal appearance Propertius was pale and thin,
and rather fond of dress; i. 5, 21,

‘Nec iam pallorem totiens mirabere nostrum,

aut cur sim toto corpore nullus ego’;

ii. 4, 5,

‘Nequiquam perfusa meis unguenta capillis,

ibat et expenso planta morata gradu.’

He had been introduced to Maecenas after the publication
of his first Book, but naturally was not on such
intimate terms with him as older men like Virgil and
Horace were. ii. 1 and iii. 9 are addressed to Maecenas.
In the first of these poems Propertius declares that he is
unequal to the composition of an epic, which his patron
had urged upon him, but adds (l. 17)

‘Quod mihi si tantum, Maecenas, fata dedissent

ut possem heroas ducere in arma manus, ...

bellaque resque tui memorarem Caesaris, et tu

Caesare sub magno cura secunda fores.’

For poems referring to Augustus cf. ii. 10, iv. 6 (on
Actium), iii. 18 (on the death of Marcellus).

Horace and Propertius do not mention each other by
name. Chronology forbids the identification of the bore
in Hor.
Sat.
i. 9 with Propertius, who, on the same ground,
cannot be meant in
Sat.
i. 10, 18,

‘Neque simius iste,

nil praeter Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum.’

But Hor.
Ep.
ii. 2, 87-101, is undoubtedly aimed at Propertius.
Cf. especially l. 99,

‘Discedo Alcaeus puncto illius; ille meo quis?

quis nisi Callimachus? Si plus adposcere visus,

fit Mimnermus et optivo cognomine crescit.’

Though both poets belonged to the same literary circle,
they differed widely in temperament as well as in age.
With Tibullus, who was a member of Messalla’s circle,
Propertius may have had no personal acquaintance; at all
events, neither alludes to the other.

For Virgil Propertius expresses warm admiration in ii. 34,
written during the composition of the
Aeneid
. Ovid, who
calls him ‘blandus’ (
Tr.
ii. 465) and ‘tener’ (
A.A.

iii. 333), was an intimate friend of his; cf.
Tr.
iv. 10, 45
(quoted
p. 206
). The minor poets to whom he writes
are Ponticus (i. 7 and 9), Bassus (i. 4), and a tragic poet,
Lynceus (a pseudonym, ii. 34, 25).

(2) WORKS.

The extant Elegies, divided in the
MSS.
into four Books,
are probably all that Propertius ever wrote. On account
of the disproportionate length of Book ii., and the number
‘tres’ (which, however, may be said in anticipation) in
ii. 13, 25,

‘Sat mea sat magna est si tres sint pompa libelli,

quos ego Persephonae maxima dona feram,’

some editors make Book ii. consist only of
El.
1-9, and
assign the remainder (10-34) to a new Book iii. Books iii.
and iv. of the
MSS.
then become iv. and v. respectively.
In the most recent editions, however, the
MSS.
arrangement
is retained, and it is here followed.

Book
i.—All the Elegies in Book i., except the last two,
are amatory.
El.
2-10 belong to the first months of the
poet’s love, when Cynthia was gracious, though capricious.
She had refused to accompany a rival of his, who was going
to Illyricum as praetor (
El.
8); but afterwards she left Rome
for Baiae, and the rest of the Book is full of complaints
of her harshness.
El.
1, written after the year of separation,
introduces the whole Book in a melancholy strain.

The clearest indication of date in Book i. is 8, 21, ‘Nam
me non ullae poterunt corrumpere taedae,’ where Propertius
protests that he will never marry, in spite of the
Lex Iulia

of
B.C.
27. (He could not legally marry a woman of
Cynthia’s class.) The Book was published probably in

B.C.
25, under the title of ‘Cynthia.’ Cf. ii. 24, 1,

‘Cum sis iam noto fabula libro

et tua sit toto Cynthia lecta foro.’

Her name was a recommendation for the Book, and it was
probably her satisfaction at the fame which it brought her
that caused her to relent towards Propertius. Cf. Mart.
xiv. 189,

‘Cynthia, facundi carmen iuvenile Properti,

accepit famam, nec minus ipsa dedit.’

At all events, a few months afterwards we find the old
relations re-established; ii. 3, 3,

‘Vix unum potes, infelix, requiescere mensem,

et turpis de te iam liber alter erit.’

Book
ii.—Cynthia is the theme of nearly all the thirty-four
poems of Book ii., which give lively expression to her
lover’s varying moods. Only three Elegies (1, 10, and 31)
are given to other subjects.

Of the few poems to which dates can be assigned, the
earliest is
El.
31 (on the dedication of the temple of the
Palatine Apollo,
B.C.
28), and the latest is
El.
10, to
Augustus (written shortly before the invasion of Arabia
by Aelius Gallus in
B.C.
24. Cf. l. 16, ‘et domus intactae
te tremit Arabiae’). The Book was therefore published

B.C.
24 at the earliest.

Book
iii.—In this Book the poems on Cynthia form a
far smaller proportion; 7, 12, and 22 show the warmth
of the poet’s friendship; events of national interest are
treated in 4, 11, and 18. In 5, 23-47, Propertius looks
forward to spending his later years in the study of natural
science (‘naturae perdiscere mores,’ l. 25).

There are few hints of the date of any of the poems
in iii.
El.
20 is apparently as early as
B.C.
28; 18 certainly
belongs to
B.C.
23; 4 perhaps refers to the expedition
against the Parthians planned in
B.C.
22. The last-mentioned
year is the earliest possible date of publication.

Book
iv., in which there is no principle of arrangement,
probably appeared after the author’s death. His archaeological
tastes come out in four Elegies written, in imitation
of the
Îá¼´ÏÎ¹Î±
of Callimachus, on Roman antiquities—
El.
2
on Vertumnus, 4 on Tarpeia, 9 on Cacus, 10 on Jupiter
Feretrius. In this way Propertius fulfilled his promise to
Maecenas, iii. 9, 49,

‘Celsaque Romanis decerpta Palatia tauris

ordiar et caeso moenia firma Remo,

eductosque pares silvestri ex ubere reges,

crescet et ingenium sub tua iussa meum.’

El.
7 and 8 relate to Cynthia; in 7 her ghost appears
to the poet.
El.
3, a letter from Arethusa to Lycotas,
possibly suggested to Ovid the plan of his
Heroides
, just
as the antiquarian poems already mentioned may have
suggested the
Fasti
. The Book ends with a lament for
Cornelia, daughter of Scribonia, Augustus’ first wife
(
El.
11).

The date of 6 and 11 is certainly not earlier than

B.C.
16, while 8 seems to have been written before the
rupture with Cynthia. The antiquarian poems are considered
by some to have been among Propertius’ earliest
efforts.

Propertius was familiar with the whole range of Greek
poetry—Homer (iii. 1, 25-34), Mimnermus (i. 9, 11),
Pindar (iii. 17, 40), the dramatists, Theocritus, and Apollonius
Rhodius. As his models he names especially the
Alexandrians Callimachus and Philetas, whom he claims
to follow more closely than any of his predecessors;
iii. 1, 1,

‘Callimachi Manes et Coi sacra Philetae,

in vestrum, quaeso, me sinite ire nemus.

Primus ego ingredior puro de fonte sacerdos

Itala per Graios orgia ferre choros.’

Cf. iv. 1, 64,

‘Umbria Romani patria Callimachi.’

In wealth of mythological illustration Propertius is
peculiarly Alexandrian. He is continually drawing parallels
and contrasts from Greek legend;
e.g.
i. 15, Cynthia how
unlike Calypso! iii. 12, Aelia Galla a modern Penelope.
Of Roman poets, he names as his predecessors in amatory
verse Virgil, Varro Atacinus, Catullus, Calvus, and Cornelius
Gallus (ii 34, 61-92). Once he dreams of writing an
epic on the Alban kings in the vein of Ennius; iii. 3, 5,

‘Parvaque tam magnis admoram fontibus ora,

unde pater sitiens Ennius ante bibit.’

In Propertius love of social pleasures appears side by
side with a strain of deep melancholy
e.g.
in. 5, 21,

Me iuvat et multo mentem vincire Lyaeo

et caput in verna semper habere rosa,

contrasted with the numerous passages where he is thinking
of the grave,
e.g.
ii. 1, 71,

‘Quandocumque igitur vitam mea fata reposcent,

et breve in exiguo marmore nomen ero.’

There is no greater patriot than Propertius. Cf. the
denunciation of Cleopatra (iii. 11) and the frequency of
the epithet ‘Romanus.’

OVID.

(1) LIFE.

Ovid’s own writings (especially
Tr.
iv. 10) supply nearly
all the information we possess regarding his life. The
biographies in the
MSS.
are valueless.

P. Ovidius Naso was his full name, in which the
MSS.

agree. He speaks of himself as Naso simply, and Statius
and Martial refer to him by that name; Tacitus and the
two Senecas use the
nomen
Ovidius.

He was born in Sulmo, one of the three divisions of
the Paelignian country,
B.C.
43—the year in which Hirtius
and Pansa fell at Mutina.
Tr.
iv. 10, 3,

‘Sulmo mihi patria est, gelidis uberrimus undis,

milia qui novies distat ab urbe decem.

Editus hic ego sum; nec non ut tempora noris,

cum cecidit fato consul uterque pari.’

His birthday was 20th March—the second day of the
festival of the Quinquatria (cf.
Fast.
iii. 809-814), l. 13,

‘Haec est armiferae festis de quinque Minervae,

quae fieri pugna prima cruenta solet.’

He belonged to an equestrian family, and he frequently
contrasts himself with those who had reached that dignity
by military service or by possessing the requisite fortune;

ibid.
l. 7,

‘Si quid id est, usque a proavis vetus ordinis heres,

non sum fortunae munere factus eques.’

Cf.
Am.
i. 3, 7; iii. 8, 9; iii. 15, 5;
Pont.
iv. 8, 17.

Along with his elder brother, he received a careful
education at Rome, and studied also at Athens. He
practised rhetoric under Arellius Fuscus and Porcius Latro.

Tr.
iv. 10, 15,

‘Protinus excolimur teneri, curaque parentis

imus ad insignes urbis ab arte viros.’

Tr.
i. 2, 77,

‘Non peto quas quondam petii studiosus Athenas.’

Sen.
Contr.
ii. 10, 8, ‘Hanc controversiam memini ab
Ovidio Nasone declamari apud rhetorem Arellium Fuscum,
cuius auditor fuit, nam Latronis admirator erat, cum diversum
sequeretur dicendi genus.’ Seneca says that
Met.
xiii.
121, and
Am.
i. 2, 11, were borrowed from Latro.

But, in spite of his father’s remonstrances, Ovid preferred
poetry to public life.
Tr.
iv. 10, 19,

‘At mihi iam parvo caelestia sacra placebant,

inque suum furtim Musa trahebat opus.

Saepe pater dixit, “studium quid inutile temptas?

Maeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes.”

Motus eram dictis totoque Helicone relicto

scribere conabar verba soluta modis:

sponte sua carmen numeros veniebat ad aptos;

quicquid temptabam dicere, versus erat.’

In due time he assumed the
toga virilis
, and with it the
broad purple stripe worn by prospective senators. He also
held two of the minor offices of the
vigintiviratus
, the
preliminary to a senatorial career, being (1) triumvir capitalis
or else triumvir monetalis, (2) decemvir stlitibus
iudicandis.
Tr.
iv. 10, 28,

‘Liberior fratri sumpta mihique toga est,

induiturque umeris cum lato purpura clavo’;

l. 33,

‘Cepimus et tenerae primos aetatis honores,

deque viris quondam pars tribus una fui.’

Fast.
iv. 384,

‘Inter bis quinos usus honore viros.’

In virtue of this second office he sat in the centumviral
court;
[67]
and he also acted as an arbitrator.
Tr.
ii. 93,

‘Nec male commissa est nobis fortuna reorum

lisque decem deciens inspicienda viris.

Res quoque privatas statui sine crimine iudex.’

He sought no higher office, having neither strength nor
inclination for the Senate; he assumed the narrow stripe
of the
eques
, and devoted himself to poetry and pleasure.

Tr.
iv. 10, 35,

‘Curia restabat: clavi mensura coacta est:

maius erat nostris viribus illud onus.

Nec patiens corpus, nec mens fuit apta labori,

sollicitaeque fugax ambitionis eram.

Et petere Aoniae suadebant tuta sorores

otia, iudicio semper amata meo.’

He made a tour in Asia (including Troy) and Sicily in
the company of the poet Pompeius Macer: the date of
this journey is unknown, but he was almost a year in
Sicily.
Pont.
ii. 10, 21-29 (to Macer),

‘Te duce magnificas Asiae perspeximus urbes,

Trinacris est oculis te duce nota meis, ...

Hic mihi labentis pars anni magna peracta est.’

Fast.
vi. 423,

‘Cura videre fuit: vidi templumque locumque,’

(of the temple of Pallas at Troy).

Towards the end of
A.D.
8, Ovid was banished by
imperial edict to Tomi, on the Black Sea, near the mouth
of the Danube, the cause alleged being the publication
of the
Ars Amatoria
. Ovid mentions this edict, but also
hints at another reason, connected with the imperial family.

Tr.
ii. 207,

‘Perdiderint cum me duo crimina, carmen et error,

alterius facti culpa silenda mihi;

nam non sum tanti renovem ut tua vulnera, Caesar,

quem nimio plus est indoluisse semel.

Altera pars superest, qua turpi carmine factus

arguor obscaeni doctor adulterii.’

He was guilty of no crime of his own, but was banished for
witnessing the crime of another. Cf.
Tr.
iii. 5, 49,

‘Inscia quod crimen viderunt lumina, plector,

peccatumque oculos est habuisse meum.’

It is probable that the real reason
[68]
of Ovid’s banishment
was that he was privy to a guilty intrigue between
D. Silanus and Julia, the grand-daughter of Augustus.
Julia was banished in
A.D.
9, and Tacitus (
Ann.
iii. 24)
tells us of the intrigue, for which Silanus (like Ovid) suffered

relegatio
. His knowledge of the offence was betrayed by
friends and domestics. Cf.
Tr.
iv. 10, 101,

‘Quid referam comitumque nefas famulosque nocentes?’

The date of his banishment is given
Tr.
iv. 10, 95,

‘Postque meos ortus Pisaea vinctus oliva

abstulerat decies praemia victor equus,

cum maris Euxini positos ad laeva Tomitas

quaerere me laesi principis ira iubet.’

[Here an Olympiad is reckoned as five years.] His punishment was

relegatio
, involving banishment to a fixed spot,
but not confiscation of property;
Tr.
ii. 135,

‘Adde quod edictum, quamvis immite minaxque,

attamen in poenae nomine lene fuit;

quippe relegatus, non exul, dicor in illo,

privaque fortunae sunt ibi verba meae.’

In Tomi he spent the remaining years of his life, far
from friends and books;
Tr.
v. 12, 53,

‘Non liber hic ullus, non qui mihi commodet aurem,

verbaque significent quid mea norit, adest’;

suffering from illness (
Tr.
iii. 3) and the climate, and
fighting against the barbarians;
Tr.
iv. 1, 71,

‘Aspera militiae iuvenis certamina fugi,

nec nisi lusura movimus arma manu:

nunc senior gladioque latus scutoque sinistram,

canitiem galeae subicioque meam.’

On the other hand he learned the language of the people,
and actually wrote poems in it;
Tr.
v. 12, 57,

‘Ipse mihi videor iam dedidicisse Latine:

nam didici Getice Sarmaticeque loqui.’

Pont.
iv. 13, 19,

‘A! pudet, et Getico scripsi sermone libellum,

structaque sunt nostris barbara verba modis,

et placui—gratare mihi—coepique poetae

inter inhumanos nomen habere Getas!

materiam quaeris? laudes de Caesare dixi.’

For his popularity with the natives cf.
Pont.
iv. 14, 53,

‘Solus adhuc ego sum vestris immunis in oris,

exceptis si qui munera legis habent.

Tempora sacrata mea sunt velata corona,

publicus invito quam favor imposuit’;

also
Pont.
iv. 9, 101.

Ovid’s death took place in
A.D.
18: Jerome yr. Abr.
2033, ‘Ovidius poeta in exilio diem obiit et iuxta oppidum
Tomos sepelitur.’ He was thrice married;
Tr.
iv.
10, 69,

‘Paene mihi puero nec digna nec utilis uxor

est data, quae tempus per breve nupta fuit;

illi successit quamvis sine crimine coniunx,

non tamen in nostro firma futura toro;

ultima, quae mecum seros permansit in annos,

sustinuit coniunx exulis esse viri.’

His third wife belonged to the
gens Fabia
. Cf.
Pont.
i. 2,
138 (to Fabius Maximus),

‘Ille ego, de vestra cui data nupta domo est.’

The
filia
mentioned
Tr.
iv. 10, 75, may have been either
a daughter or step-daughter of Ovid’s. Some think that
she is the Perilla of
Tr.
iii. 7.

Ovid’s social position was of the highest, as may be inferred
from his relations with the palace. He was intimate
with Messalla, the patron of Tibullus, and wrote an elegy
on him (now lost). Cf.
Pont.
i. 7, 27 (to Messalinus),

‘Nec tuus est genitor nos infitiatus amicos,

hortator studii causaque faxque mei:

cui nos et lacrimas, supremum in funere munus,

et dedimus medio scripta canenda foro.’

Among the friends to whom the
Epp. ex Ponto
are written
may be mentioned Albinovanus, Carus, Rufus, Severus,
Fabius Maximus Cotta, Tuticanus, the younger Macer, all
poets; and other literary men of distinction,
e.g.
Graecinus,
Atticus, Brutus, Sex. Pompeius, Gallio. For his intimacy
with the learned Hyginus cf. Sueton.
Gramm.
20, ‘fuit
familiarissimus Ovidio poetae.’

He was old enough to have seen Virgil, and hear Aemilius
Macer and Horace recite; with Propertius, Tibullus, Ponticus,
and Bassus he was on terms of close intimacy (
Am.
iii.
9 is a lament for Tibullus),
Tr.
iv. 10, 41-52,

‘Temporis illius colui fovique poetas,

quotque aderant vates, rebar adesse deos.

Saepe suas volucres legit mihi grandior aevo,

quaeque necet serpens, quae iuvet herba, Macer.

Saepe suos solitus recitare Propertius ignes,

iure sodalicii qui mihi iunctus erat.

Ponticus heroo, Bassus quoque clarus iambis

dulcia convictus membra fuere mei.

Detinuit nostras numerosus Horatius aures,

dum ferit Ausonia carmina culta lyra.

Vergilium vidi tantum; nec amara Tibullo

tempus amicitiae fata dedere meae.’

Besides the
rura paterna
at Sulmo, Ovid possessed an
estate on the
via Clodia
, near Rome;
Pont.
i. 8, 41,

‘Non meus amissos animus desiderat agros

ruraque Paeligno conspicienda solo,

nec quos piniferis positos in collibus hortos

spectat Flaminiae Clodia iuncta viae.’

He cannot have been poor, in spite of his complaints,
e.g.

Pont.
iv. 8, 32,

‘Carpsit opes illa ruina meas.’

(2) WORKS.

1.
Amores
, at first in five Books, but in a second
edition reduced to three; cf. the motto prefixed to the
Book,

‘Qui modo Nasonis fueramus quinque libelli,

Tres sumus.’

The poems are nearly all on Corinna, a name which
probably does not stand for any real person, but merely
for an abstraction around which Ovid groups his own
fancies. To suppose, as Sidonius Apollinaris did (23,
157)
[69]
that Augustus’ daughter Julia was meant, is absurd,
for Corinna is a
meretrix
. The identity of Corinna was
unknown;
Am.
ii. 17, 28,

‘Et multae per me nomen habere volunt.

Novi aliquam, quae se circumferat esse Corinnam’;

and twenty years afterwards Ovid could write (
A.A.
iii. 538),

‘Et multi, quae sit nostra Corinna, rogant.’

The
Amores
, in their original form, constituted Ovid’s
earliest work, written in his youth. The extant poems are
not all that he wrote on Corinna;
Tr.
iv. 10, 57,

‘Carmina cum primum populo iuvenilia legi,

barba resecta mihi bisve semelve fuit.

Moverat ingenium totam cantata per urbem

nomine non vero dicta Corinna mihi.

Multa quidem scripsi; sed quae vitiosa putavi,

emendaturis ignibus ipse dedi.’

The lament for Tibullus (iii. 9) must have been written
in Ovid’s twenty-fourth year.

2.
Heroides
.—Some of these at least were written before
the second edition of the
Amores
, for in
Am.
ii. 18, 21-6
nine of them are mentioned by name. The title
Heroides

is due to the grammarian Priscian; in the
MSS.
they are
called
Epistulae
, and so Ovid himself refers to them,

A.A.
iii. 345,

‘Vel tibi composita cantetur epistula voce:

ignotum hoc aliis ille novavit opus.’

Of the twenty letters in our collection 1-14 are letters
from heroines to their lovers; 15-20 are in pairs,
e.g.
Paris
to Helen and Helen to Paris. The authenticity of these
last six is doubted, partly because the title
Heroides
cannot
apply to half of them, and also because of their inferiority
in style. In the use of the epistolary form in love poetry
Ovid had no predecessor, and he himself calls attention
to the novelty (
A.A.
above). The style shows the influence
of Ovid’s rhetorical training: the Epistles are
suasoriae
in
verse, and of
suasoriae
we know that he was particularly
fond (Sen.
Contr.
ii. 10, 12, ‘Declamabat Naso raro
controversias et non nisi ethicas: libentius dicebat suasorias.
Molesta illi erat omnis argumentatio.’). His matter he
would naturally draw from Homer, the
Cypria
, Apollonius
Rhodius, and the Greek tragedians.

3. Between the two editions of the
Amores
he wrote the
lost tragedy
Medea
. It was later than
Am.
iii. 1, where
he pictures the Muses of Elegy and Tragedy as contending
for his homage, and he finally decides (ll. 67-8),

‘Exiguum vati concede, Tragoedia, tempus:

tu labor aeternus; quod petit illa breve est.’

On the other hand, it was earlier than
Am.
ii. 18, 13,

‘Sceptra tamen sumpsi, curaque tragoedia nostra

crevit, et huic operi quamlibet aptus eram.’

The drama enjoyed a high reputation in antiquity. Cf.
Quint. x. 1, 98, ‘Ovidii Medea videtur mihi ostendere,
quantum ille vir praestare potuerit, si ingenio suo imperare
quam indulgere maluisset.’

4.
Medicamina Faciei Femineae
, an incomplete poem of
100 lines, giving directions for the toilet. Cf.
A.A.
iii. 205,

‘Est mihi, quo dixi vestrae medicamina formae,

parvus, sed cura grande, libellus, opus.’

5.
Ars Amatoria
, a didactic poem in three Books, on
the art of love-intrigue. The title given by the
MSS.
is
doubtless correct: Ovid himself speaks of ‘ars amandi,’ or
simply ‘ars’ or ‘artes.’ It was written about
B.C.
2, from
the allusion, i. 171, to the ‘naumachia’ in that year,

‘Quid, modo cum belli navalis imagine Caesar

Persidas induxit Cecropiasque rates?’

The
Ars
must have been in view when he wrote
Am.
ii.
18, 19,

‘Quod licet, aut artes teneri profitemur amoris—

ei mihi, praeceptis urgeor ipse meis!’

6.
Remedia Amoris
, written next, while professing to be
a recantation of the last-named work, exhibits, if possible,
a more immoral tone. Cf. l. 487,

‘Quaeris, ubi invenias? artes, i, perlege nostras.’

7. Ovid now produced a work of greater compass, the

Metamorphoses
, in fifteen Books of heroic verse. When
it was composed is not known, but he had the idea of it
in his mind when he wrote
Am.
iii. 12, 21-40. At the
time of his banishment the poem had been written, but
not revised. He committed his
MS.
to the flames, but
copies were in the hands of friends;
Tr.
i. 7, 13-16,

‘Carmina mutatas hominum dicentia formas,

infelix domini quod fuga rupit opus.

Haec ego discedens, sicut bene multa meorum,

ipse mea posui maestus in igne manu.

Quae quoniam non sunt penitus sublata, sed extant,      (l. 23)

pluribus exemplis scripta fuisse reor.

Ablatum mediis opus est incudibus illud,      (l. 29)

defuit et scriptis ultima lima meis.’

The poem consists of a collection of stories of the transformation
of human beings into animals. Cf. i. 1,

‘In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas

corpora.’

The idea, title, and much of the subject-matter was
borrowed from the Alexandrians,
e.g.
the
ÎÎµÏÎ±Î¼Î¿ÏÏÏÏÎµÎ¹Ï

of Parthenius, the
á¼ÏÎµÏÎ¿Î¹Î¿ÏÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î±
of Nicander.

8. In the
Fasti
, in six Books, Ovid furnishes a poetical
calendar of the Roman year. Each month has a Book
allotted to it, and he speaks of having written twelve
Books;
Tr.
ii. 549,

‘Sex ego Fastorum scripsi totidemque libellos,

cumque suo finem mense volumen habet.

Idque tuo nuper scriptum sub nomine, Caesar,

et tibi sacratum sors mea rupit opus.’

Probably the second six Books were never completed;
but there are references to portions of them,
e.g.
iii. 57,

‘Vester honos veniet, cum Larentalia dicam;

acceptus Geniis illa December habet.’

The
Fasti
had been written side by side with the
Metam.

and interrupted at the sixth Book by Ovid’s banishment.
During his exile he added some passages, but found that
his Muse was fit only for melancholy themes; iv. 81,

‘Sulmonis gelidi—patriae, Germanice, nostrae—

me miserum, Scythico quam procul illa solo est!’

i. 540,

‘Felix, exilium cui locus ille fuit!’

The design is stated at the outset, i. 1-8,

‘Tempora cum causis Latium digesta per annum

lapsaque sub terras ortaque signa canam ...

Sacra recognosces annalibus eruta priscis,

et quo sit merito quaeque notata dies.’

The work is thus a medley of religion, history, and astrology,
and in its explanations of customs may be compared to
the
Îá¼´ÏÎ¹Î±
of Callimachus. For information about religious
rites, and for derivations of names (
e.g.

Agnalia
, i. 317-332),
he would have recourse to Varro; for history, to Livy
(cf. ii. 193-242, the story of the Fabii, from Livy, ii. 49,
and vi. 587, etc., the story of Tullia, from Livy, i. 48);
for astronomy, to Clodius Tuscus.

It was begun some time after Augustus regulated the
Julian calendar in
B.C.
8, and was originally addressed to
Augustus, as Ovid himself says (
Tr.
ii. 552 above);
‘Caesar’ is addressed ii. 15, vi. 763, and elsewhere.
After the death of Augustus, Ovid began to remodel it
and dedicate it to Germanicus. Cf. i. 3,

‘Excipe pacato, Caesar Germanice, voltu

hoc opus et timidae dirige navis iter.’

But the task was stopped by his death; and while Book i.
has the remodelled form, Books ii.-vi. remain as first
written.

Poems written in exile.
—9.
Tristia
, five Books of letters
to Augustus, to Ovid’s wife and friends (who, however, are
not named), praying for pardon or for a place of exile
nearer Rome. Book i. was written on the journey to
Tomi, the other books not after
A.D.
11 or 12, Cf. v. 10, 1,

‘Ut sumus in Ponto, ter frigore constitit Hister.’

10. The
Ibis
was written at the beginning of his exile.
Cf. l. 1,

‘Tempus ad hoc, lustris bis iam mihi quinque peractis.’

The title was taken from the poem in which Callimachus
attacked Apollonius Rhodius under the name of Ibis.
Cf. l. 55,

‘Nunc, quo Battiades inimicum devovet Ibin,

hoc ego devoveo teque tuosque modo.’

Ovid studiously conceals the identity of the enemy whom
he attacks; l. 61,

‘Et quoniam, qui sis, nondum quaerentibus edo,

Ibidis interea tu quoque nomen habe.’

He had once been a friend of the poet, but had proved
false to him, doubtless in connexion with the circumstances
which caused his banishment; cf. l. 85, ‘capiti male fido,’
l. 130, ‘perfide.’ He persecuted Ovid’s wife, and tried to
get possession of his property.

The conjectures that the unknown was Messalla Corvinus
or the poet Manilius may be dismissed at once. Many
hold that Hyginus is meant; Prof. Ellis suggests the
delator

Cassius Severus (Tac.
Ann.
iv. 21), or T. Labienus (Sen.

Contr.
x. praef. 4), or the astrologer Thrasyllus (Tac.

Ann.
vi. 20). To the same person probably are addressed

Tr.
iii. 11, iv. 9, v. 8;
Pont.
iv. 3.

11. The
Epistulae ex Ponto
, in four Books, were written

A.D.
12-16. In tone they resemble the
Tristia
, but the
composition is more careless, and the friends to whom he
writes are mentioned by name.

12.
Halieuticon
, a poem on fish, in hexameters, in a
fragmentary condition. Ovid wrote this towards the end
of his life.

Pliny,
N.H.
xxxii. 152, ‘His adiciemus ab Ovidio posita
nomina quae apud neminem alium reperiuntur, sed fortassis
in Ponto nascentium, ubi id volumen supremis suis
temporibus incohavit.’

MANILIUS.

Manilius is not mentioned by any other writer, and his
own poem gives no particulars of his life. There is uncertainty
even as to the true form of his name, the
MSS.

giving variously M. Mallius, Manlius, or Manilius, with
the addition in one case of EQOM (probably = equitis
Romani). In some
MSS.
the poem is wrongly attributed
to Aratus or Boetius, both of whom wrote on the same
subject as Manilius.

Bentley conjectured that Manilius was an Asiatic Greek,
but the poet speaks of Latin as ‘nostra lingua’ (ii. 889),
while Greek is ‘externa lingua’ (iii. 40), and he uses no
Greek constructions.

His poem, the
Astronomica
, in its present form, consists
of five Books of hexameter verse: probably a sixth Book
has been lost. It may have been wholly composed in the
reign of Tiberius, or begun under Augustus. Book v. was
written under Tiberius, if the burning of Pompey’s theatre
in
A.D.
22 is alluded to in ll. 513-515. The earlier Books
contain nothing which might not have been written after
the death of Augustus—the allusions to the disaster of
Varus in
A.D.
9 (i. 899), and to the sojourn of Tiberius
at Rhodes (iv. 764). Either Augustus or Tiberius may be
the ‘Caesar’ of i. 7 and i. 386. On the other hand,
if Ovid is referring to Manilius (as Prof. Ellis suggests) in

Tr.
ii. 485,

‘Ecce canit formas alius iactusque pilarum,

hic artem nandi praecipit, ille trochi,’

it would follow that the whole poem had been published
before the death of Augustus, for the descriptions of
ball-play and swimming occur in v. 165-171 and
420-431.

Astronomy is treated only in Book i.; the rest of the
poem is devoted to astrology. This is in accordance with
the author’s statement of his theme (i. 1-3), which he was
the first Roman to treat in verse (i. 4, 113, ii. 57). As
his object is to convey instruction rather than to give
pleasure (iii. 36-39), he does not scruple to use Greek
technical terms (ii. 693, 829, 897, iii. 40). The subject
does not lend itself readily to verse (i. 20, iii. 31), and
the poem is intolerably dry, except the introductions to
each Book, which reveal considerable poetical power. The
chief peculiarities of Manilius’ language are his strange use
of prepositions and his fondness for alliteration; imitations
of Virgil are found throughout.

Manilius is a fatalist (iv. 14 and 22): still fate does not
abolish the moral quality of actions (iv. 108-118). The
universe is directed by a ‘vis animae divina’ or ‘divinum
numen’ (i. 250, 491).

LIVY.

There is no ancient biography of Livy, and very little
light is thrown on his life by his own writings or by
allusions in other authors.

Titus Livius was born at Patavium (the modern Padua)

B.C.
59: Jerome yr. Abr. 1958, ‘T. Livius Patavinus
scriptor historicus nascitur.’ (The Armenian version gives

Ol.
180, 4 =
B.C.
57.) Near Patavium there was a famous
sulphur spring known as Aponus or Aponi fons, whence
Martial calls the district Apona tellus (i. 61, 3, ‘Censetur
Apona Livio suo tellus’). There is no reason to suppose
from this that Livy’s birthplace was not Patavium itself,
but a village Aponus, which is nowhere mentioned. Statius
(
Silv.
iv. 7, 55) calls him ‘Timavi alumnus.’ For Livy’s
acquaintance with Patavium cf. x. 2, 14 and 15.

From his tone we may infer that he came of a good
family, and he must have possessed a fair income. The
charge against his style of
Patavinitas
implies that he
spent a considerable part of his life in his native town,
but he probably settled at Rome about
B.C.
30. That he
took no part in public life is clear from his own words:
i. praef. 5, ‘Hoc laboris praemium petam, ut me a conspectu malorum, quae nostra tot per annos vidit aetas,
tantisper certe, dum prisca illa tota mente repeto, avertam,
omnis expers curae, quae scribentis animum etsi non
flectere a vero, sollicitum tamen efficere posset.’

He enjoyed the intimacy of Augustus, whom he himself mentions, iv. 20, 7, ‘hoc ego cum Augustum Caesarem ... se
ipsum ... legisse audissem.’ Tac.
Ann.
iv. 34, ‘T.
Livius, eloquentiae ac fidei praeclarus in primis, Cn. Pompeium
tantis laudibus tulit, ut Pompeianum eum Augustus
appellaret; neque id amicitiae eorum offecit.’ It was at
Livy’s suggestion that the future emperor, Claudius, started
to compose a history: Sueton.
Claud.
41, ‘historiam in
adulescentia, hortante T. Livio, Sulpicio vero Flavo etiam
adiuvante, scribere adgressus est.’ On the other hand,
Caligula would have liked to remove Livy’s writings and
his bust from all the libraries, calling him ‘verbosum in
historia neglegentemque’ (Sueton.
Calig.
34).

Nothing more is known of his life, except that he visited
Campania, xxxviii. 56, 3, ‘Nam et Literni monumentum
monumentoque statua superimposita fuit, quam tempestate
disiectam nuper vidimus ipsi.’

He died at his native town,
A.D.
17: Jerome yr. Abr.
2033, ‘Livius historicus Patavii moritur.’

He had at least one son (Quint. x. 1, 39, ‘apud Livium
in epistula ad filium scripta’), and one daughter (Sen.

Contr.
x. praef. 2, ‘L. Magius gener T. Livi’).

Livy wrote philosophical works, probably popular
treatises like Cicero’s, some of them in the form of
dialogues.

Sen.
Ep.
100, 9, ‘Nomina adhuc T. Livium. Scripsit
enim et dialogos, quos non magis philosophiae adnumerare
possis quam historiae, et ex professo philosophiam continentis
libros.’

A book on rhetoric was known to Quintilian and Seneca
the elder, apparently in the form of a letter addressed to
the author’s son (Quint. x. 1, 39, above).

Quint. ii. 5, 20, ‘quemadmodum Livius praecipit’ (on
models of style); Sen.
Contr.
ix. 2, 26, ‘Livius de
oratoribus ... aiebat’ (on obscurity of expression); Sen.

Contr.
ix. 1, 14, ‘T. Livius tam iniquus Sallustio fuit ut
hanc ipsam sententiam ... obiceret Sallustio.’

These minor works have perished, and of his great
history only a portion survives.

Its title, according to the oldest
MSS.
, the summaries
of the lost Books, and the grammarians, was
Ab urbe
condita libri
; and this is corroborated by Livy’s own
language: i. praef. 1, ‘si a primordio urbis res populi
Romani perscripserim’; and by Pliny,
N.H.
praef. 16,
‘T. Livium ... in historiarum suarum, quas repetit ab
origine urbis, quodam volumine.’ Livy refers to it loosely
as
meos annales
(xliii. 13, 2). Separate parts may have
had special titles: thus Books cix-cxvi. were known as

Civilis belli libri
viii. (Codex Nazarenus of the Periochae).

The number of Books now extant is thirty-five, viz.,
i.-x., which carry the history down to
B.C.
293, and xxi.-xlv.,
covering the period
B.C.
218-167. Of these xli. and xliii.
are incomplete. But we possess summaries (
Periochae
or

Argumenta
) of Books i.-cxlii., except cxxxvi. and cxxxvii.,
which show that the narrative was continued to the death
of Drusus in
B.C.
9. There is no evidence that it actually
went further; but as the death of Drusus is hardly an
event of sufficient importance to form the conclusion of
so great a work, it has been thought that Livy may
have intended to finish with the death of Augustus—the
point from which Tacitus starts. The total number of
Books would then have been probably one hundred and
fifty.

The division into Books (
libri
or
volumina
) is due to
the author: vi. 1, 1, ‘quae ab condita urbe Romani
gessere quinque libris exposui.’ The division into decades
(
i.e.
sets of ten Books) is first mentioned towards the end
of the fifth century; it is merely a conventional arrangement,
the subject-matter falling naturally into sets of fifteen
Books, which again sometimes embrace three sub-divisions
each a half-decade, or two, a half-decade and a decade.

An epitome was known to Martial, xiv. 190,

‘Pellibus exiguis artatur Livius ingens,

quem mea non totum bibliotheca
capit.’

The evidence of the date of composition is as follows:

(
a
) i. 19, 3, ‘Bis deinde post Numae regnum [Ianus]
clausus fuit, semel T. Manlio consule post Punicum primum
perfectum bellum, iterum, quod nostrae aetati dei dederunt
ut videremus, post bellum Actiacum ab imperatore Caesare
Augusto pace terra marique parta.’ Now, as the first closing
of the temple of Janus by Augustus was in
B.C.
29,
and as Livy is silent as to the second closing after the
Cantabrian war in 25, it follows that this passage was
written
B.C.
29-25. The use of the title Augustus, conferred
on Octavian in 27, puts the earliest possible date
two years later. The history therefore was not begun
before
B.C.
27.

(
b
) ix. 36, 1, ‘Silva erat Ciminia magis tum invia atque
horrenda quam nuper fuere Germanici saltus.’ In this
Niebuhr found an allusion to the campaigns of Drusus,

B.C.
12-9, and accordingly assumed that the first decade
was not published till
B.C.
9. But the passage may equally
well refer to earlier campaigns,
e.g.
of Julius Caesar. Nor
can it be shown that the history of Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
published
B.C.
7, was used by Livy for Books
viii.-x. Book ix. must have been written before
B.C.
20,
or Livy would have mentioned the recovery of the standards
from the Parthians in ix. 18, 9.

(
c
) xxviii. 12, 12, ‘Hispania prima Romanis inita provinciarum,
quae quidem continentis sint, postrema omnium
nostra demum aetate ductu auspicioque Augusti Caesaris
perdomita.’ This was written not earlier than
B.C.
19, if it
refers to Agrippa’s victory over the Cantabrians.

(
d
) Book lix. mentioned the
lex de maritandis ordinibus
,
and consequently cannot have been earlier than
B.C.
18.

(
e
) The books in which Pompeius figured were composed
in the lifetime of Augustus (Tac.
Ann.
iv. 34, above).

(
f
) Book cxxi., according to the oldest
MS.
of the
Periochae, was published after the death of Augustus; so
doubtless were the remaining Books (
A.D.
14-17).

A work of such compass, and occupying so many years
of the author’s life, would naturally be published in sections.
This
a priori
view is corroborated by several considerations:
(
a
) There are separate prefaces to various sections (vi. 1;
xxi. 1; xxxi. 1); (
b
) Livy’s style was censured
[70]
by Asinius
Pollio, who died
A.D.
5; (
c
) Augustus was acquainted with
Livy’s sympathetic treatment of Pompeius (see above); (
d
)
Livy had great fame in his lifetime: Pliny,
Ep.
ii. 3, 8,
‘Numquamne legisti Gaditanum quemdam T. Livi nomine
gloriaque commotum ad visendum eum ab ultimo terrarum
orbe venisse statimque ut viderat abisse?’

The historians from whom Livy derived his materials,
and whom he himself mentions are:
Fabius Pictor
(i. 44, 2,
etc.). Livy refers to him six times, but it may be questioned
whether he used him at first-hand. More probably he took
his opinions on the authority of later annalists like Macer,
Antias, and Tubero.
Cincius Alimentus
(xxi. 38, 3): the
Cincius quoted in vii. 3, 7, may be the same, or an antiquarian
of the Ciceronian or Augustan age;
Cato
(xxxiv.
15, 9);
Calpurnius Piso
(xxv. 39, 15);
Coelius Antipater

(xxix. 25, 3);
Claudius Quadrigarius
(vi. 42, 5, etc.);

Valerius Antias
, quoted thirty-five times—far more frequently
than any other authority;
Licinius Macer
;
Aelius
Tubero
(iv. 23, 1);
Clodius Licinus
(xxix. 22, 10);
Rutilius

(xxxix. 52, 1);
Polybius
;
Silenus
(xxvi. 49, 3), a Greek,
whose account of the Second Punic War was favourable
to the Carthaginians.

A criticism of Livy’s use of these sources is impossible,
except in the case of Polybius, all the others having
perished. His tone in alluding to the Greek historian is
remarkable for its coldness: xxx. 45, 5, ‘Polybius haudquaquam
spernendus auctor’; cf. xxxiii. 10, 8. Although
Polybius is not mentioned till Book xxx., he was undoubtedly
used throughout the third decade, as well as in
the fourth and fifth. Livy follows him very closely. Where
Livy differs from Polybius he is probably following the
account of Coelius Antipater, who is his leading authority
for the Second Punic War.

Livy is not careful to reconcile his sources, and so
frequently contradicts himself. His way of explaining a
discrepancy between his authorities is by striking an average
(xxvi. 49, 6, ‘si aliquis adsentiri necesse est, media simillima
veris sunt’). His irresolution was noted by Quintilian,
ii. 4, 19, ‘saepe quaeri solet de tempore, de loco, quo
gesta res dicitur, nonnumquam de persona quoque, sicut
Livius frequentissime dubitat.’ This of course has its good
side: it saves him from dogmatizing on uncertain points,
and he has a hearty appreciation of the confusion in his
authorities: xxxvii. 34, 5, ‘is ubi et quando et quo casu
captus sit, sicut pleraque alia, parum inter auctores constat.’
He recognizes the value of contemporary evidence: xxii. 7, 4,
‘Fabium aequalem temporibus huiusce belli potissimum
auctorem habui’; xxi. 38, 3, ‘L. Cincius Alimentus, qui
captum se ab Hannibale scribit, maxime auctor moveret.’
Criticism of his authorities is most conspicuous in the
case of Valerius Antias, whom at first he followed in good
faith; he condemns him again and again for exaggeration
and credulity,
e.g.
xxxiii. 10, 8, ‘si Valerio qui credat,
omnium rerum immodice numerum augenti’; xxxix. 43, 1,
‘Valerius Antias, ut qui nec orationem Catonis legisset et
fabulae tantum sine auctore editae credidisset.’ He also
recognizes the bias of Licinius Macer: vii. 9, 5, ‘quaesita
ea propriae familiae laus leviorem auctorem Licinium facit.’
For the untrustworthiness of family records, cf. viii. 40, 4,
‘vitiatam memoriam funebribus laudibus reor falsisque
imaginum titulis, dum familiae ad se quaeque famam rerum
gestarum honorumque fallenti mendacio trahunt.’

Livy often refers to authorities whom he does not name:
‘invenio apud quosdam,’ ‘satis constat’; and to tradition:
‘fama est,’ ‘dicitur,’ ‘fertur,’ ‘traditur.’ Tradition was the
sole source for events prior to the sack of Rome by the
Gauls, cf. vi. 12, 2
sqq.

There is no trace in Livy of any use of original documents.

He constantly resists the temptation to digress from
his proper theme:
e.g.
xxxix. 48, 6, ‘cuius belli et causas
et ordinem si expromere velim, immemor sim propositi,
quo statui non ultra attingere externa, nisi qua Romanis
cohaererent rebus.’

In spite of his love of truth (xxii. 7, 4, ‘nihil haustum
ex vano velim, quo nimis inclinant ferme scribentium animi’:
cf. Tac.
Ann.
iv. 34, ‘fidei praeclarus’), partiality blinds
him to the faults of his own countrymen, and he fails to
do justice to opponents like the Samnites and Carthaginians.

In dealing with the legendary period he admits that
his narrative has no trustworthy foundation, and gives it
merely for what it is worth: Praef. 6, ‘Quae ante conditam
condendamve urbem poeticis magis decora fabulis quam
incorruptis rerum gestarum monumentis traduntur, ea nec
adfirmare nec refellere in animo est. Datur haec venia
antiquitati, ut miscendo humana divinis primordia urbium
augustiora faciat.’

The numerous speeches exemplify Livy’s rhetorical tendency,
representing what he thought the speaker would
have said under the given circumstances: iii. 67, 1, ‘ibi
in hanc sententiam locutum accipio.’

His power of describing character is noted by Seneca,

Suas.
vi. 21, ‘Quoties magni alicuius viri mors ab historicis
narrata est, toties fere consummatio totius vitae et quasi
funebris laudatio redditur. Hoc ... T. Livius benignius
omnibus magnis viris praestitit.’

Religion and morality.
—Livy believes in the influence
of the gods on human affairs: ix. 1, 11, ‘cum rerum
humanarum maximum momentum sit, quam propitiis rem,
quam adversis agant dis.’ Superior to the gods is
necessitas

(ix. 4, 16), and
fortuna
is also powerful (ix. 17, 3; v. 37, 1).
He condemns the irreligion of his own day (x. 40, 10,
‘iuvenis ante doctrinam deos spernentem natus’), cf. iii. 20, 5;
viii. 11, 1. He retains the old belief in prodigies and
portents, every war being introduced by a list of them,
but recognizes that many reported instances were fictitious:
xxi. 62, 1, ‘Multa ea hieme prodigia facta, aut, quod
evenire solet motis semel in religionem animis, multa
nuntiata et temere credita sunt.’

He condemns the vices of his own age, and lauds the
old Romans: Praef. 12, ‘Nuper divitiae avaritiam et
abundantes voluptates desiderium per luxum atque libidinem
pereundi perdendique omnia invexere.’

Politics.
—Livy is an aristocrat, with a poor opinion of
the lower orders:
e.g.
xxiv. 25, 8, ‘Ea natura multitudinis
est: aut servit humiliter aut superbe dominatur; libertatem,
quae media est, nec cupere modice nec habere sciunt.’
His political attitude is influenced to a great extent by the
earlier historians, who had mostly been on the aristocratic
side. Yet he is not a defender of the aristocratic party
through thick and thin; and though he admired the
character of some leading republicans, there can be no
question of his loyalty to the Empire. Cf. Tac.
Ann.
iv. 34,
‘Scipionem, Afranium, hunc ipsum Cassium, hunc Brutum
nusquam latrones et parricidas, quae nunc vocabula imponuntur,
saepe ut insignes viros nominat.’

Livy’s view of Caesar is quoted by Seneca,
N.Q.
v. 18, 4,
‘in incerto esse utrum illum nasci magis rei publicae
profuerit, an non nasci?’

Contemporaries of Livy.
—1.
Pompeius Trogus
, whose
history is known to us only through the abridgment
made by M. Iunianus Iustinus, probably in the time of
the Antonines. Trogus was of Gallic descent. His grandfather
had received the Roman
civitas
from Pompey; his
father was one of Caesar’s officers, and is possibly to be
identified with the Cn. Pompeius of Caes.
B.G.
v. 36
(Iustin. xliii. 5, 11). His chief work,
Historiae Philippicae
,
in forty-four Books, was concerned chiefly with the history
of Macedonia and the Diadochi; but it embraced also the
empires of the East and the history of Greece down to the
time of Philip, as well as Parthia, Spain, Carthage, and the
early history of Rome.

2.
Fenestella
, who died, according to Jerome, in
A.D.
19
at the age of seventy. Nothing is known of his life, or of
the poems which Jerome attributes to him; but he certainly
wrote
Annales
(Nonius, p. 154). He is also quoted
as an authority on miscellaneous antiquarian and constitutional
points.

3.
M. Verrius Flaccus
, tutor to the grandsons of Augustus
(Sueton.
Gramm.
17), was the author of
Fasti
, fragments of
which have been discovered near Praeneste, and which were
used by Ovid for his poem of that name. Of Verrius’
grammatical works, the greatest was that entitled
De verborum
significatu
(Gell. v. 17, 1), arranged alphabetically.
It is lost, but we possess part of an abridgment (nine out of
sixteen Books) made by
Sex. Pompeius Festus
before the
third century
A.D.
The abridgment of Festus was in turn
epitomized by
Paulus Diaconus
in the time of Charlemagne,
and his work is extant in a complete form.

4.
C. Iulius Hyginus
, a freedman of Augustus and librarian
of the Palatine library (Sueton.
Gramm.
20), wrote

De vita rebusque illustrium virorum
(Gell. i. 14, 1);

Exempla
(Gell. x. 18, 7);
De situ urbium Italicarum

(Serv.
ad Verg. Aen.
iii. 553);
De familiis Troianis
(ibid.
v. 389); theological works,
e.g.

De dis Penatibus
(Macrob.

Saturn.
iii. 4, 13); commentaries on Virgil and Helvius
Cinna; and
De Agricultura
, a treatise to which Virgil was
indebted (Colum. i. 1, 13). The Hyginus who wrote

Fabulae
and
De Astrologia
probably lived in the second
century
A.D.

VITRUVIUS.

Vitruvius Pollio (the cognomen appears only in the
abridgment of his book) served under Caesar in Africa

B.C.
46; viii. 3, 25, ‘C. Iulius Masinissae filius ... cum
patre Caesari militavit. Is hospitio meo est usus. Ita
cottidiano convictu necesse fuerat de philologia disputare ...’

Under Augustus he was an officer of engineers, and was
enabled to spend the rest of his life in comfort through the
liberality of that prince and his sister Octavia: i. praef. 2,
‘Cum M. Aurelio et P. Minidio et Cn. Cornelio ad
apparationem ballistarum et scorpionum reliquorumque
tormentorum refectionem fui praesto et cum eis commoda
accepi. Quae cum primo mihi tribuisti, recognitionem per
sororis commendationem servasti. Cum ergo eo beneficio
essem obligatus, ut ad exitum vitae non haberem inopiae
timorem ...’

He wrote the treatise
De Architectura
, in ten Books,
when he was no longer young (ii. praef. 4, ‘faciem deformavit
aetas’), between the years
B.C.
16 and 13. The
temple of Quirinus, mentioned iii. 2, 7, was built in the
former year; and he speaks of only one stone theatre in
Rome (iii. 2, 2), whereas in
B.C.
13 there were three.

The arrangement of the subject-matter is as follows:
Book i., sciences on which architecture is based, chief
divisions of the subject, choice of site, and method of
laying out a town; ii., building materials; iii., temples—Ionic order; iv., Doric and Corinthian orders; v., public
buildings,
e.g.
, forum, theatre; vi., private houses—construction;
vii., decoration; viii., water-supply; ix., methods
of measuring time,
e.g.
, sun-dials; x., engines and machines
used in war and in the arts.

The work is dedicated to Augustus, who is addressed
throughout, and is meant to be of practical use to him in
his building operations.

The body of the work is severely technical; the introductions
to the Books are in a more ambitious style.
Vitruvius writes as a professional man, not as a scholar:
i. 1, 17, ‘Non uti summus philosophus nec rhetor disertus
nec grammaticus summis rationibus artis exercitatus, sed
ut architectus his litteris imbutus haec nisus sum scribere.’
He freely confesses his obligations to Greek authors, whom
he enumerates vii. praef. 10-14. Diagrams were appended
to the text: i. 6, 12, ‘Quoniam haec a nobis sunt breviter
exposita, ut facilius intellegantur visum est mihi in extremo
volumine formas, sive uti Graeci
ÏÏÎ®Î¼Î±ÏÎ±
dicunt duo explicare.’

SENECA THE ELDER.

(1) LIFE.

Annaeus Seneca (for the praenomen Marcus, usually
given, there is no authority: in the best
MSS.
it is Lucius,
possibly through confusion with his son) was a native of
Corduba: Mart. i. 62, 7,

‘Duosque Senecas unicumque Lucanum

facunda loquitur Corduba.’

The date of his birth is probably about
B.C.
55, for he
was old enough to have heard Cicero if the civil wars
had not prevented him leaving his native town:
Contr.
i.
praef. 11, ‘Omnes magni in eloquentia nominis excepto
Cicerone videor audisse: ne Ciceronem quidem aetas
mihi eripuerat, sed bellorum civilium furor, qui tunc
orbem totum pervagabatur, intra coloniam meam me continuit.’

He was of equestrian rank; cf. the speech of Seneca
the younger, Tac.
Ann.
xiv. 53, ‘Egone, equestri et provinciali
loco ortus, proceribus civitatis adnumeror?’

Most of his life appears to have been spent in Rome,
where alone he could have acquired his vast knowledge
of contemporary rhetoric. Together with his countryman
Porcius Latro, he attended the lectures of the rhetorician
Marullus:
Contr.
i. praef. 22, ‘Hoc Latro meus faciebat,
ut sententias amaret. Cum condiscipuli essemus apud
Marullum rhetorem ...’ Asinius Pollio he had heard at
two different periods:
Contr.
iv. praef. 3, ‘audivi illum et
viridem et postea iam senem.’

Seneca’s wife was Helvia, whose noble character is described
by her son (
ad Helv.
14, 3; 16, 3): by her he had
three sons, M. Annaeus Novatus, L. Annaeus Seneca, and
M. Annaeus Mela.

He survived Tiberius; for (1) he alludes to events which
happened after his reign, (2) Sueton.
Tib.
73, quotes
from ‘Seneca’ an account of the death of Tiberius, and
we know that the elder Seneca wrote history: that his son
did likewise there is nothing to show. Hence he was
alive after
A.D.
37. On the other hand, he was dead
before his son’s exile in
A.D.
43, for Sen.
ad Helv.
2, 5,
after enumerating the calamities which had befallen his
mother—among them his father’s death—concludes with
the words ‘raptum me audisti: hoc adhuc defuerat tibi,
lugere vivos.’

Seneca was a man of stern character: for his old-world
views and dislike of innovation cf. his son’s words (
ad
Helv.
17, 3), ‘Patris mei antiquus rigor.... Virorum
optimus, pater meus, maiorum consuetudini deditus.’ He
disapproved of the higher education of women, ‘propter
istas quae litteris non ad sapientiam utuntur, sed ad luxuriam
instruuntur.’

(2) WORKS.

The only extant works of Seneca are
Oratorum et
Rhetorum Sententiae, Divisiones, Colores Controversiarum
et Suasoriarum
.

1. The
Controversiae
were written at the request of his
three sons, but were intended for a wider circle of readers:
i. praef. 10, ‘Quaecumque a celeberrimis viris facunde
dicta teneo, ne ad quemquam privatim pertineant, populo
dedicabo.’ Seneca here gives a criticism of the rhetoricians
of his time, with specimens of the style of each: i. praef. 1,
‘Exigitis rem magis iucundam mihi quam facilem; iubetis
enim quid de his declamatoribus sentiam qui in aetatem
meam inciderunt indicare, et si qua memoriae meae nondum
elapsa sunt ab illis dicta colligere, ut quamvis notitiae
vestrae subducti sint, tamen non credatis tantum de illis,
sed et iudicetis.’ The specimens are given from memory,
and the arrangement is not systematic: i. praef. 4, ‘Illud
necesse est impetrem, ne me quasi certum aliquem ordinem
velitis sequi in contrahendis quae mihi occurrent.’ Seneca
treats only of those rhetoricians whom his sons had not
themselves heard: i. praef. 4, ‘Neque de his me interrogatis
quos ipsi audistis, sed de his qui ad vos usque non
pervenerunt.’ His hero is Cicero, since whose time oratory
has steadily degenerated: i. praef. 11, ‘Illud ingenium
quod solum populus Romanus par imperio suo habuit’;

ibid.
7, ‘Omnia ingenia quae lucem studiis nostris attulerunt
tunc nata sunt: in deterius deinde cottidie data res est.’

Of the ten Books of
Controversiae
only five have come
down to us, viz., i., ii., vii., ix., and x. The deficiency is to
some extent supplied by an abridgment (
Excerpta
) made
in the fourth or fifth century
A.D.
, which adds thirty-nine
themes to the thirty-five contained in the surviving part
of the original work. Each Book had a separate preface.
Those to v., vi., and viii. are entirely wanting; for the prefaces
to ii., iii., and iv. we are indebted to the abridgment.

The
Controversiae
were written when Seneca was an
old man, and when his two elder sons were preparing for
public life, probably about
A.D.
20: x. praef. 1, ‘Sinite me
ab istis iuvenilibus studiis ad senectutem meam reverti’;
ii. praef. 4 (to Mela), ‘Fratribus tuis ambitiosa curae sunt
foroque se et honoribus parant.’

As to the date of publication, it has been argued
[71]
that
they appeared after the fall of Seianus and before the death
of Mamercus Scaurus,
i.e.
, between
A.D.
31 and 34. Probably,
however, the publication did not take place till after
the death of Tiberius,
A.D.
37; the protest against the
burning of books (x. praef. 6-7) would have been as
offensive to him as to Seianus.

2. There is only one book of
Suasoriae
, and the beginning
of it is lost. It gives specimens of the treatment
of seven themes,
e.g.
, 3, ‘Deliberat Agamemnon an Iphigeniam
immolet negante Calchante aliter navigari fas esse.’
It is certainly later than the
Controversiae
:
Contr.
ii. 4, 8,
‘Quae dixerit suo loco reddam, cum ad suasorias venero.’
One passage cannot have been written before
A.D.
34:
2, 22, ‘Scaurum Mamercum, in quo Scaurorum familia
exstincta est.’ It was not published in the lifetime of
Tiberius, for Seneca calls the accuser of Scaurus ‘homo
quam improbi animi tam infelicis ingenii’ (2, 22), and
quotes Cremutius Cordus (6, 19) whose books had been
burned in Tiberius’ time.

3. Seneca wrote also on Roman history from the commencement
of the civil wars to his own time, but left
the work of publication to his son.

L. Seneca
de vita patris
(Haase, vol. iii. p. 436), ‘Si
quaecumque composuit pater meus et edi voluit iam in
manus populi emisissem, ad claritatem nominis sui satis
sibi ipsi prospexerat ... Quisquis legisset eius historias ab
initio bellorum civilium, unde primum veritas retro abiit,
paene usque ad mortis suae diem,’ etc.

CHAPTER IV.

POST-AUGUSTAN WRITERS.

VELLEIUS PATERCULUS.

C.
[72]
Velleius Paterculus was born at latest
B.C.
19, as
he was quaestor-elect
A.D.
6. He was descended from a
distinguished family in Campania (Vell. ii. 16, 2; Liv. xxiii.

sqq.
). His father was a
praefectus equitum
(ii. 104, 3).
After some military experience in Thrace and Macedonia,
Velleius accompanied C. Caesar, the grandson of Augustus,
on his mission to the East,
A.D.
1. His rank at this
time was
tribunus militum
.

ii. 101, 2 (of the meeting of C. Caesar and the Parthian
king), ‘Sub initia stipendiorum meorum tribuno militum
mihi visere contigit: quem militiae gradum ante sub patre
tuo, M. Vinici, et P. Silio auspicatus in Thracia Macedoniaque,
mox Achaia Asiaque et omnibus ad Orientem
visis provinciis et ore atque utroque maris Pontici latere,
haud iniucunda tot rerum, locorum, gentium, urbium recordatione
fruor.’

In
A.D.
4, as
praefectus equitum
, he accompanied Tiberius
to Germany: ii. 104, 3, ‘Hoc tempus me, functum ante
tribunatu, castrorum Ti. Caesaris militem fecit; quippe
protinus ab adoptione missus cum eo praefectus equitum
in Germaniam, successor officii patris mei, caelestissimorum
eius operum per annos continuos viii. praefectus aut legatus
spectator et pro captu mediocritatis meae adiutor fui.’

In
A.D.
6, when quaestor-elect, he commanded reinforcements
sent from Rome to Tiberius in Pannonia, and at
the expiration of his term of office as quaestor in Rome,
he returned to Tiberius as a
legatus
: ii. 111, 3, ‘Habuit
in hoc quoque bello mediocritas nostra speciosi ministerii
locum. Finita equestri militia designatus quaestor necdum
senator aequatus senatoribus, etiam designatis tribunis
plebei, partem exercitus ab urbe traditi ab Augusto perduxi
ad filium eius. In quaestura deinde remissa sorte
provinciae legatus eiusdem ad eumdem missus sum.’

In
A.D.
9 Velleius served in Dalmatia (ii. 115, 5), afterwards
spending two years in Germany (ii. 104, 3 above).
In the winter of
A.D.
12-13 he took part in the triumph
of Tiberius: ii. 121, 2, ‘Ex Pannoniis Delmatisque egit
triumphum ... quem mihi fratrique meo inter praecipuos
praecipuisque donis adornatos viros comitari contigit.’

Velleius was praetor-elect in
A.D.
14: ii. 124, 4, ‘Quo
tempore mihi fratrique meo, candidatis Caesaris, proxime
a nobilissimis ac sacerdotalibus viris destinari praetoribus
contigit, consecutis ut neque post nos quemquam divus
Augustus neque ante nos Caesar commendaret Tiberius.’

The publication of his history, sixteen years later, is
the only circumstance recorded of Velleius after this date.

The
Historia Romana
, in two Books, was published

A.D.
30, in the consulship of M. Vinicius, to whom the
book is addressed (i. 8, 1, and often). The beginning of
Book i. is lost; the first eight chapters in our text are
occupied with a rapid survey of the history of Greece
since the Trojan war, the Phoenician settlements in the
Mediterranean, and the chief events in the history of the
world before the foundation of Rome. C. 8 breaks off at
the rape of the Sabine women, and there is a great lacuna
before we reach, in c. 9, the defeat of Perseus at Pydna
in
B.C.
168. Ch. 9-13 carry the narrative down to the
destruction of Carthage and Corinth. Book ii. commences
at that point, and ends with the death of Livia,
A.D.
29
(ii. 130, 5, ‘cuius temporis aegritudinem auxit amissa
mater’).

Velleius is constantly calling attention to the brevity and
compression of his treatment, in such phrases as ‘omnia
transcursu dicenda’ (ii. 55), ‘artatum opus’ (ii. 86), ‘recisum
opus’ (ii. 89). Much that the plan of his book compels
him to omit, he promises to publish later in a larger work,

e.g.
ii. 99, 3, ‘iusto servemus operi,’ ii. 114, 4, ‘iustis
voluminibus ordine narrabimus.’ Even as it is, he occasionally
pauses to describe a great character (ii. 41, Caesar),
or to express his personal opinion (ii. 66, 3, denunciation
of Antony for Cicero’s murder). Specially noticeable are
the digressions on the Roman colonies (i. 14-15) and provinces
(ii. 38-39), on the prominence of different types of
genius at certain epochs (i. 16-18), and on literary history
(ii. 9, the chief writers of the time of the Gracci; ii. 36,
of the Ciceronian and Augustan ages; i. 5, praise of
Homer; i. 7, of Hesiod). As is natural in so short a
book, Velleius names very few authorities.

The motive of the history is evidently the glorification
of the author’s old general, Tiberius, whose actual reign,
however, he dismisses in eight chapters. Probably he felt
the subject too risky, and devoted his strength to the
earlier life of Tiberius, which occupies the greater part
even of the chapters nominally devoted to the reign of
Augustus (ii. 59-123). Tiberius is spoken of throughout
in terms of unqualified praise, and no hint is given of
the darker side of his character. Seianus also is extolled
(ii. 127-8), as he was in high favour at the time when
Velleius wrote.

VALERIUS MAXIMUS.

Nothing is known of the life of Valerius Maximus beyond
the fact that he visited Asia in company with Sex. Pompeius,
the friend of Ovid and of Germanicus. Pompeius
was consul
A.D.
14, and between
A.D.
27 and 30 became proconsul
of Asia.

Val. Max. ii. 6, 8, ‘Consuetudinem ... illam etiam in insula
Cea servari animadverti, quo tempore Asiam cum Sex.
Pompeio petens Iulidem oppidum intravi.’

Valerius dwells on his obligations to Pompeius in his
chapter on friendship (iv. 7,
ext.
2).

His sole work,
Facta et Dicta Memorabilia
, in nine
books, is a collection of notable incidents and sayings,
classified under appropriate headings, for the convenience
of speakers seeking illustrations for their subject-matter.
Cf. the preface, ‘Urbis Romae exterarumque gentium facta
simul ac dicta memoratu digna, quae apud alios latius
diffusa sunt quam ut breviter cognosci possint, ab illustribus
electa auctoribus digerere constitui, ut documenta
sumere volentibus longae inquisitionis labor absit.’

The
illustres auctores
from whom he draws most of his
material are Livy, Cicero (each mentioned only once),
Sallust, and Trogus; but thirteen Latin and twenty Greek
authors are mentioned by name. He frequently misrepresents
his authorities.

Each book is divided into chapters on separate topics
(
e.g.

De Pudicitia
), under each of which he gives (1) illustrations
from Roman history, (2) those from the history of
other nations. The latter of course are few in comparison.

Although Iulius Paris, the epitomizer of Valerius, speaks
of ten books, only nine are extant, and it may be doubted
whether there ever was a tenth. Book i. is mutilated.

There are only two passages which throw any light on
the date of composition—viii. 11,
ext.
4, a denunciation of
Seianus, obviously written after his fall in
A.D.
31; and
vi. 1 praef., before the death of Livia,
A.D.
29. The work
was published at latest in
A.D.
37, for it is dedicated to
Tiberius, who is the object of the most servile flattery
(
e.g.
ii. 9, 6); similar language is used of Iulius Caesar
(iv. 5, 6), and Augustus (i. 7, 1), while Brutus and Cassius
are denounced as parricides (i. 5, 7; i. 8, 8).

Two abridgments of Valerius Maximus are extant.

CELSUS.

Of the life of Celsus nothing is known; but he was an
older contemporary of Columella. Colum. iii. 17, 4, ‘Iulius
Atticus et Cornelius Celsus, aetatis nostrae celeberrimi
auctores, patrem atque filium Sasernam secuti.’

He wrote an encyclopaedic work on agriculture, medicine,
war, rhetoric, and philosophy, but only the section
on medicine is extant.

Quint. xi. 12, 24, ‘Cum etiam Cornelius Celsus, mediocri
vir ingenio, non solum de his omnibus conscripserit
artibus sed amplius rei militaris et rusticae et medicinae
praecepta reliquerit.’

The first part consisted of five books on agriculture: cf.
Colum. i. 1, 14, ‘Cornelius totum corpus disciplinae
quinque libris complexus est.’ This section of the work
was probably written in the reign of Tiberius, for it was
known to Iulius Graecinus, whose execution took place
under Caligula. Plin.
N.H.
xiv. 33, ‘Graecinus, qui alioqui
Cornelium Celsum transcripsit.’

There are eight books
De Re Medica
. The only indication
of their date is in iv. 7, where Celsus mentions a prescription
as not found ‘in monumentis medicorum.’ As
this prescription is given by Scribonius Largus, who wrote
about
A.D.
47, Celsus must have written before that year.

The section on war was used by Vegetius (
De Re
Mil.
i. 8).

Rhetoric was also treated in the encyclopaedia. Quintilian,
who mentions him as one of the more careful writers
on that subject (iii. 1, 21, ‘accuratius scripsit Celsus’),
frequently combats his opinions and speaks of him rather
contemptuously:
e.g.
ix. 1, 18, ‘Cornelius Celsus nimia
profecto novitatis cupidine ductus. Nam quis ignorasse
eruditum alioqui virum credat,’ etc. He may be the Celsus
of Juv. 6, 245, who (according to the Scholiast) wrote a
manual of rhetoric in seven books.

There were also six books on the history of philosophy.
Augustine
de haeres. prol.
, ‘Opiniones omnium philosophorum
qui sectas varias condiderunt usque ad tempora sua vi.
non parvis voluminibus quidam Celsus absolvit; nec
redarguit aliquem, sed tantum quid sentirent aperuit. Cum
ferme centum philosophos nominasset,’ etc.

Celsus also wrote separate treatises (1) on philosophy,
Quint. x. 1, 24, ‘Scripsit non parum multa Cornelius
Celsus, Sextios secutus, non sine cultu ac nitore’; (2) on
strategy (Lydus
de mag.
i. 47).

PHAEDRUS.

The title of Phaedrus’ work, ‘Phaedri Augusti liberti
fabularum Aesopiarum libri,’ probably means that he was
a freedman of Augustus. Tiberius is called ‘Caesar
Tiberius’ in ii. 6, 7; contrast the reference to Augustus,
iii. 10, 39, ‘a divo Augusto.’ Phaedrus was born in Thrace,
possibly in the district of Pieria; but the date is unknown;
iii. prol. 17,

‘Ego, quem Pierio mater enixa est iugo,

in quo tonanti sancta Mnemosyne Iovi

fecunda novies artium peperit chorum’;

ibid.
54,

‘Ego, litteratae qui sum propior Graeciae,

cur somno inerti deseram patriae decus?

Threissa cum gens numeret auctores suos,

Linoque Apollo sit parens, Musa Orpheo.’

Some wrongly take these allusions to mean that he belongs
to the realm of poesy. That he came to Rome early is
shown by the knowledge of Latin literature he acquired in
his boyhood. Cf. iii. epil. 33, where he quotes Ennius,

‘Ego, quondam legi quam puer sententiam,

“Palam mutire plebeio piaculum est,”

dum sanitas constabit, pulchre meminero.’

After publishing two books of fables, Phaedrus was
persecuted by Seianus, in some way unknown; iii. prol. 38,

‘Ego porro illius [Aesopi] semita feci viam,

et cogitavi plura quam reliquerat,

in calamitatem deligens quaedam meam.

Quod si accusator alius Seiano foret,

si testis alius, index alius denique,

dignum faterer esse me tantis malis.’

This persecution may have arisen from references in his
fables, such as i. 1 (Lupus et agnus), l. 14,

‘Haec propter illos scripta est homines fabula,

qui fictis causis innocentes opprimunt’;

i. 6 (Ranae ad solem), which Nisard
[73]
thinks refers to
the ambitious marriage which Seianus projected with Livia,
daughter of Germanicus, ‘The sun dries up the ponds;
what will happen if the sun marries and has children?’ l. 9,

‘Quidnam futurum est, si crearit liberos?’

Phaedrus survived the attacks made on him, and Book v.
was written in his old age (see below).

Several personal points are clear from his writings:

(1) He had to meet the attacks of critics; ii. epil. 10,

‘Si livor obtrectare curam voluerit,

non tamen eripiet laudis conscientiam.’

(2) His desire for fame and his self-consciousness; iii.
prol. 60,

‘Ergo hinc abesto livor, ne frustra gemas,

quoniam sollemnis mihi debetur gloria.’

(3) His contempt for money; iii. prol. 21,

‘Curamque habendi penitus corde eraserim’;

v. 4, 7,

‘Huius respectu fabulae deterritus

periculosum semper vitavi lucrum.’

Phaedrus wrote five Books of fables. Many have certainly
been lost. Cf. his reference to tree-fables, none of
which we have; i. prol. 6,

‘quod arbores loquantur, non tantum ferae.’

There are, besides the five Books, thirty fables usually
printed as an appendix, and probably composed by
Phaedrus. The fables are all in ‘impure’ iambic senarii,
like those of Terence and Publius Syrus. Phaedrus followed
Aesop, but, as he affirms, not slavishly; i. prol. 1,

‘Aesopus auctor quam materiam repperit,

hanc ego polivi versibus senariis’;

iv. prol. 10,

‘fabulis

quas Aesopias, non Aesopi, nomino.’

We have the Greek originals for about a third of the
fables; but Phaedrus speaks of his additions to Aesop;
ii. prol. 8,

‘Equidem omni cura morem servabo senis;

sed si libuerit aliquid interponere,

dictorum sensus ut delectet varietas,

bonas in partes, lector, accipias velim.’

Stories from contemporary or recent history are given
in ii. 6, 7; iii. 10; v. 7.

Books i. and ii. were published under Tiberius; Book iii.
was published after Tiberius’ death (cf. iii. prol. 33), and
is dedicated to Eutychus, who has been identified with a
favourite slave of Caligula. Book iv. followed, addressed
to Particulo (iv. prol. 10). Book v., addressed to Philetes,
was written in the poet’s old age; v. 10, 7,

‘Cui senex contra Lacon:

“Non te destituit animus, sed vires meae.

Quod fuimus, lauda, si iam damnas, quod sumus.”

Hoc cur, Philete, scripserim, pulchre vides.’

Martial is the only classical writer who refers to Phaedrus;
iii. 20, 5,

‘An aemulatur improbi iocos Phaedri?’

SENECA THE YOUNGER.

(1) LIFE.

L. Annaeus Seneca, the son of Annaeus Seneca, the
rhetor, was born at Corduba in Spain. For information
about his family see under ‘Seneca the elder,’
pp. 226-7
.
He was probably born about the beginning of our era, as he
seems to have remembered Asinius Pollio, who died
A.D.
5,
and had passed his boyhood in
A.D.
19, when the Jewish
and Egyptian rites were expelled from Rome.

Sen.
de tranquill. animi
, 17, 7, ‘Qualem Pollionem Asinium
meminimus, quem nulla res ultra decimam [horam] retinuit.’

Ep.
108, 22, ‘In Tiberii Caesaris principatum iuventae
tempus inciderat: alienigena tum sacra movebantur.’

At an early age Seneca was brought to Rome by his
mother’s sister, who was probably the wife of Vitrasius
Pollio, prefect of Egypt for sixteen years.

Ad Helv.
19, 2, ‘Illius manibus in urbem perlatus sum.’

Seneca’s mother took a great interest in his education,
which was conducted under Fabianus Papirius (cf.
Ep.
100,
9, etc.) and Sotion the Pythagorean, of Alexandria, pupils
of Sextius (for Seneca’s study of whom see
Ep.
64).

Ad Helv.
15, 1, ‘Vera vis materni doloris oritur ... “ubi
studia, quibus libentius quam femina, familiarius quam
mater intereram?”’

Ep.
108, 17, ‘Dicebat [Sotion] quare ille animalibus
abstinuisset, quare postea Sextius ... Â§ 22. His ego instinctus
abstinere animalibus coepi et anno peracto non tantum
facilis erat mihi consuetudo, sed dulcis.’

The elder Seneca put an end to this abstinence, which was
associated in the popular view with foreign superstitions (see

Ep.
108, 17-23). This must have happened about
A.D.
19.
The influence of Sotion is seen in passages imitated from
his book
de ira cohibenda
by Seneca. Seneca also studied
under Attalus, a Greek Stoic, possibly about
A.D.
20.

Ep.
108, 13-15, ‘Ego certe cum Attalum audirem in
vitia, in errores, in mala vitae perorantem, saepe misertus
sum generis humani et illum sublimem altioremque humano
fastigio credidi ... Inde mihi quaedam permansere, Lucili.
Magno enim in omnia inceptu veneram. Deinde ad
civitatis vitam reductus ex bene coeptis pauca servavi:
inde ostreis boletisque in omnem vitam renuntiatum est.’

Seneca speaks of his change of studies and occupations
in
Ep.
49, 2, ‘Modo apud Sotionem philosophum puer
sedi. Modo causas agere coepi. Modo desii velle agere,
modo desii posse.’

In
A.D.
31 Seneca was probably still at Rome; cf.

N.Q.
i. 1, 3, ‘Vidimus [prodigium] eo tempore, quo de
Seiano actum est.’ Lipsius’ inference
[74]
that Seneca made a
voyage to Egypt about this time is probable, though Seneca
himself gives no direct information about it. According
to this theory his host was Vitrasius Pollio, prefect of Egypt.
While in Egypt, Seneca was attacked by illness, and escaped
death by his aunt’s care. Cf.
ad Helv.
19, 2, ‘Illius pio
maternoque nutricio per longum tempus aeger convalui.’
Seneca accompanied Vitrasius when he resigned his office
and returned with his wife to Italy
A.D.
32 (Dio, lviii. 19, 6).
They suffered shipwreck, and Vitrasius perished.

Ad Helv.
19, 4, ‘Sed si prudentiam perfectissimae feminae
novi, non patietur te nihil profuturo maerore consumi et
exemplum tibi suum, cuius ego etiam spectator fui, narrabit.
Carissimum virum amiserat, avunculum nostrum, cui virgo
nupserat, in ipsa quidem navigatione: tulit tamen eodem
tempore et luctum et metum evictisque tempestatibus
corpus eius naufraga evexit.’

This theory is supported by the fact that Seneca wrote
a work ‘de ritu (al., situ) et sacris Aegyptiorum’ (Serv.
ad
Aen.
vi. 154).

Through his aunt’s influence Seneca obtained the quaestorship.

Ad Helv.
19, 2, ‘Illa pro quaestura mea gratiam suam
extendit, et quae ne sermonis quidem aut clarae salutationis
sustinuit audaciam, pro me vicit indulgentia verecundiam.’

Seneca’s quaestorship must have been after the death
of his aunt’s husband, in
A.D.
32, as the above passage
shows, and before the death of Tiberius in
A.D.
37, as it was
with Tiberius that his aunt’s influence lay, on account of
her husband’s services. After his quaestorship Seneca
appears to have married (cf.
de ira
, iii. 36, 3, etc.). His
wife must have died before
A.D.
57, as in that year Seneca
married Pompeia Paulina; cf. Dio, lxi. 10, 3,
Î³Î¬Î¼Î¿Î½ á¼ÏÎ¹ÏÎ±Î½Î­ÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Î½ á¼Î³Î·Î¼Îµ
.
By his first wife he had three sons
(
ad Helv.
2, 5).

While senator, Seneca incurred the jealousy of Caligula,
and in
A.D.
39 narrowly escaped death.

suae telum” minabatur; lenius comtiusque scribendi
genus adeo contemnens, ut Senecam, tum maxime placentem,
“commissiones meras” componere, et “harenam esse sine
calce” diceret.’

In
A.D.
41 Seneca was banished to Corsica, through the
agency of Messalina, on the charge of adultery with Iulia
Livilla, sister of Caligula, but really because he was suspected
of belonging to the faction of Agrippina.

Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 42, ‘Nec Suillius questu aut exprobratione
abstinebat ... et Senecam increpans infensum amicis Claudii,
sub quo iustissimum exilium pertulisset ... Se quaestorem
Germanici, illum domus eius adulterum fuisse.’

Seneca was tried before the Senate, and Claudius prevented
his execution.

Ad Polyb.
13, 2, ‘Deprecatus est pro me senatum, et
vitam mihi non tantum dedit, sed etiam petiit.’

While in Corsica he devoted himself to literature and
science. Cf.
ad Helv.
20, 1 (written in exile), ‘Animus
omnis occupationis expers operibus suis vacat et modo se
levioribus studiis oblectat, modo ad considerandam suam
universique naturam veri avidus insurgit: terras primum
situmque earum quaerit.’

The
Consolatio ad Polybium
, written during this time,
is full of flattery of Claudius.

Seneca was recalled at the beginning of
A.D.
49, became
Nero’s tutor (although he wished to visit Athens), and
obtained the praetorship through the influence of Agrippina,
with whom his name was coupled by popular rumour.

Tac.
Ann.
xii. 8, ‘At Agrippina, ne malis tantum
facinoribus notesceret, veniam exilii pro Annaeo Seneca,
simul praeturam inpetrat, laetum in publicum rata ob claritudinem
studiorum eius, utque Domitii pueritia tali magistro

disciplinas omnes fere puer attigit. Sed a philosophia eum
mater avertit, monens imperaturo contrariam esse: a cognitione
veterum oratorum Seneca praeceptor, quo diutius
in admiratione sui detineret.’

It is probable that Seneca was, like Nero, privy to the
murder of Claudius in
A.D.
54. Cf. his sarcasms against
Claudius in his
Apocolocyntosis
.

Sueton.
Nero
33 (of Nero), ‘Cuius [Claudi] necis etsi
non auctor, at conscius fuit: neque dissimulanter, ut qui
boletos, in quo cibi genere venenum is acceperat, quasi
deorum cibum, posthac proverbio Graeco conlaudare sit
solitus.’

Seneca wrote for Nero a speech which he delivered on
the occasion of Claudius’ death.

Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 3, ‘Die funeris laudationem eius princeps
exorsus est; dum antiquitatem generis, consulatus ac
triumphos maiorum enumerabat, intentus ipse et ceteri;
liberalium quoque artium commemoratio, et nihil regente
eo triste rei publicae ab externis accidisse, pronis animis
audita. Postquam ad providentiam sapientiamque flexit,
nemo risui temperare, quamquam oratio a Seneca composita
multum cultus praeferret, ut fuit illi viro ingenium
amoenum et temporis eius auribus accommodatum.’

He acted as a check on Nero (Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 6; 11),
and baffled Agrippina’s vengeance and ambition.

Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 2, ‘Ibaturque in caedes, nisi Afranius
Burrus et Annaeus Seneca obviam issent. (Ch. 5) Quin
et legatis Armeniorum causam gentis apud Neronem
orantibus escendere suggestum imperatoris et praesidere
simul parabat, nisi ceteris pavore defixis Seneca admonuisset,
venienti matri occurreret.’

Seneca interfered to shelter Nero in his amour with
Acte,
A.D.
55, and used the occasion to stir up feud
between Agrippina and Nero (Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 13). Hence
followed an attack by Agrippina on Seneca.

Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 14, ‘Audiretur hinc Germanici filia, inde
debilis rursus Burrus et exsul Seneca, trunca scilicet manu
et professoria lingua generis humani regimen expostulantes.’

It is unlikely that Seneca opposed the murder of Britannicus
(Feb.
A.D.
55). Cf. Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 17, ‘Facinus cui
plerique iam hominum ignoscebant, antiquas fratrum
discordias et insociabile regnum aestimantes.’
[75]

Seneca took part shortly afterwards in the trial in which
Agrippina was found not guilty (Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 20-21).
There are many references to Seneca’s great power and
wealth at this time.

62),
‘Quartus decimus annus est, Caesar, ex quo spei tuae
admotus sum, octavus, ut imperium obtines: medio
temporis tantum honorum atque opum in me cumulasti,
ut nihil felicitati meae desit nisi moderatio eius... At tu
gratiam immensam, innumeram pecuniam circumdedisti,
adeo ut plerumque intra me ipse volvam, “Egone, equestri
et provinciali loco ortus, proceribus civitatis adnumeror? ...
Talis hortos extruit, et per haec suburbana incedit, et

Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 42 (speech of Suillius,
A.D.
58), ‘Qua
sapientia, quibus philosophorum praeceptis, intra quadriennium
regiae amicitiae ter miliens sestertium paravisset?’
(Dio, lxi. 10, 2, gives his wealth as 75,000,000 denarii).

Seneca had many estates both in Italy (
Ep.
123, 1, etc.)
and abroad, and lent money abroad, even in Britain. His
attraction to finance is seen in the number of metaphors
he draws from that subject.

His attack on usury (
de ben.
vii. 10, 3) is a piece of
theoretic philosophy.

In
A.D.
57 Seneca was consul suffectus (Ulpian,
Dig.

xxxvi. 1). In
A.D.
58 he brought about the downfall of
the former delator, P. Suillius. Cf. Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 42,
‘Variis deinde casibus iactatus et multorum odia meritus
reus, haud tamen sine invidia Senecae damnatur. Is fuit
P. Suillius.’ Seneca is thought to have been implicated in
Agrippina’s murder in
A.D.
59. He wrote to the Senate
for Nero an account of her death.

Tac.
Ann.
xiv. 7 (Nero says after the fruitless attempt of
Anicetus to kill Agrippina), ‘Quod contra subsidium sibi
nisi quid Burrus et Seneca expedirent? Quos statim
acciverat, incertum an aperiens, et ante ignaros. Igitur
longum utriusque silentium, ne inriti dissuaderent; an eo
descensum credebant, ut, nisi praeveniretur Agrippina,
pereundum Neroni esset? Post Seneca, hactenus promptius,
ut respiceret Burrum, ac sciscitaretur an militi imperanda
caedes esset. (Ch. 11) Ergo non iam Nero, cuius
immanitas omnium questus anteibat, sed Seneca adverso
rumore erat, quod oratione tali confessionem scripsisset.’

The death of Burrus in
A.D.
62 weakened the power of
Seneca, who resolved to retire. His request, however, was
not granted by Nero (Tac.
Ann.
xiv. 55-6), but he reduced
his establishment, and lived in semi-privacy.

Tac.
Ann.
xiv. 52, ‘Mors Burri infregit Senecae potentiam,
quia nec bonis artibus idem virium erat altero velut
duce amoto, et Nero ad deteriores inclinabat. Hi variis
criminationibus Senecam adoriuntur ... Certe finitam
Neronis pueritiam, et robur iuventae adesse. Exueret
magistrum, satis amplis doctoribus instructus maioribus
suis. (Ch. 56) Instituta prioris potentiae commutat, prohibet
coetus salutantium, vitat comitantis, rarus per urbem, quasi
valetudine infensa aut sapientiae studiis domi attineretur.’

Later in
A.D.
62, came an unsuccessful attempt to ruin
Seneca. Tac.
Ann.
xiv. 65, ‘Romanus secretis criminationibus
incusaverat Senecam ut Gai Pisonis socium;
sed validius a Seneca eodem crimine perculsus est.’

In
A.D.
64, on the occasion of the burning of Rome by
Nero, Seneca wished to retire. He is said to have offered
money to repair the disasters of the fire.

Tac.
Ann.
xv. 45, ‘Ferebatur Seneca, quo invidiam
sacrilegii a semet averteret, longinqui ruris secessum oravisse,
et postquam non concedebatur, ficta valetudine, quasi
aeger nervis, cubiculum non egressus.’

The story given in Tac.
Ann.
xv. 45 of the attempt to
poison Seneca probably arose from his abstemious habits.

‘Tradidere quidam venenum ei per libertum ipsius cui
nomen Cleonicus paratum iussu Neronis, vitatumque a
Seneca proditione liberti seu propria formidine, dum persimplici
victu et agrestibus pomis, ac si sitis admoneret,
profluente aqua vitam tolerat.’

In
A.D.
65 Seneca was implicated in the conspiracy of
Piso, and was forced to commit suicide. His wife wished
to die with him, but was prevented by Nero’s orders.

Tac.
Ann.
xv. 60, ‘Sequitur caedes Annaei Senecae,
laetissima principi, non quia coniurationis manifestum
compererat, sed ut ferro grassaretur, quando veneno non
processerat ... (Ch. 63) Post quae eodem ictu brachia
ferro exsolvunt. Seneca, quoniam senile corpus et parco
victu tenuatum lenta effugia sanguini praebebat, crurum
quoque et poplitum venas abrumpit. Saevisque cruciatibus
defessus, ne dolore suo animum uxoris infringeret atque
ipse visendo eius tormenta ad impatientiam delaberetur,
suadet in aliud cubiculum abscedere. Et novissimo quoque
momento suppeditante eloquentia advocatis scriptoribus
pleraque tradidit ... (Ch. 64) At Nero nullo in Paulinam
proprio odio, ac ne glisceret invidia crudelitatis, inhibere
mortem. ... Seneca interim, durante tractu et lentitudine
mortis, Statium Annaeum, diu sibi amicitiae fide et arte
medicinae probatum, orat, provisum pridem venenum, quo
damnati publico Atheniensium iudicio exstinguerentur, promeret;
adlatumque hausit frustra, frigidus iam artus, et
cluso corpore adversum vim veneni. Postremo stagnum
calidae aquae introiit, respergens proximos servorum, addita
voce, libare se liquorem illum Iovi liberatori. Exin balneo
inlatus, et vapore eius exanimatus, sine ullo funeris sollemni
crematur.’

There was a rumour that some of the conspirators intended
to make Seneca emperor.

Tac.
Ann.
xv. 65, ‘Fama fuit Subrium Flavum cum
centurionibus occulto consilio, neque tamen ignorante
Seneca, destinavisse, ut post occisum opera Pisonis Neronem
Piso quoque interficeretur, tradereturque imperium
Senecae, quasi insontibus claritudine virtutum ad summum
fastigium delecto.’

(2) WORKS.

The following prose works are extant:

1.
Dialogorum libri
xii.

(1)
ad Lucilium: quare aliqua incommoda bonis viris
accidant cum providentia sit; sive de providentia
. This
was probably a late work.

(2)
ad Serenum: nec iniuriam nec contumeliam accipere
sapientem; sive de constantia sapientis
: written in the first
years of Nero’s reign.

(3-5)
ad Novatum de ira libri
iii., probably written in
the first year of Claudius’ reign.

(6)
ad Marciam de consolatione
: written to console Marcia,
the daughter of Cremutius Cordus, for the death of her son
Metilius. The work may have been written in
A.D.
41, as
Caligula’s name is studiously avoided.

(7)
ad Gallionem de vita beata
. This book, addressed
to Seneca’s brother Gallio (Novatus), was probably written
shortly after
A.D.
58, and justifies his having wealth though a
philosopher.

(8)
ad Serenum de otio
. This work, like the next, was
addressed to Annaeus Serenus, and was written probably
about
A.D.
62. Only a part of it is extant. The book
discusses whether a wise man should engage in state affairs.

(9)
ad Serenum de tranquillitate animi
, probably written
soon after Seneca’s recall.

(10)
ad Paulinum de brevitate vitae
. For the date cf.
13, 8, ‘Sullam ultimum Romanorum protulisse pomoerium.’
Now, Claudius extended the pomoerium in
A.D.
50, so
this must have been written in
A.D.
49, as the book was
brought out after Seneca’s return from exile.

(11)
ad Polybium de consolatione
. This book was addressed
in
A.D.
43 or 44 to Polybius, a favourite of Claudius, on the
occasion of his brother’s death. The date is fixed by the
reference to Claudius’ expedition to Britain in 12, 2-3.
Cf. Â§ 3, ‘Non desinam totiens tibi offerre Caesarem. Illo
moderante terras et ostendente, quanto melius beneficiis
imperium custodiatur quam armis, illo rebus humanis
praeside non est periculum, ne quid perdidisse te sentias.’
For similar flattery of Claudius, cf. 7,4; 12,5.

(12)
ad Helviam matrem de consolatione
, written during
his banishment.

2.
ad Neronem Caesarem de clementia
, in three Books,
two of which are extant. The work was written in
A.D.

55-6, doubtless to show the public what sort of instruction
Seneca had given Nero, and what sort of emperor they
had to expect (cf. i, 1, 1). The date is settled by i. 9, 1,
‘[divus Augustus] cum hoc aetatis esset quod tu nunc es,
duodevicesimum egressus annum,’ Nero having been born
15th December,
A.D.
37. The flattery contained in ii. 1,
1-2, and elsewhere, can be justified to some extent by
Nero’s conduct at that time. Cf. Sueton.
Nero
, 10, ‘Neque
liberalitatis, neque clementiae, ne comitatis quidem exhibendae
ullam occasionem omisit.’

3.
De Beneficiis
in seven Books, addressed to Aebutius
Liberalis of Lugdunum. It is probable that Books i.-iv.
were published first, shortly after the death of Claudius
(who is sneered at in i. 15, 6). Books v.-vii. are probably
a later addition. Cf. v. 1, 1, ‘In prioribus libris videbar consummasse
propositum ... Quidquid ultra moror, non servio
materiae, sed indulgeo ... Verum quia ita vis, perseveremus
peractis.’ The eulogy of Demetrius the Cynic in vii. 8-12,
makes it probable that Book vii. at least was written in
Seneca’s last years.

4.
Apocolocyntosis
, a political satire on Claudius, written
shortly after his death in
A.D.
54. The explanation of
the title is given by Dio, lx. 35, 2,

. The work does not bear this
title in the
MSS.
, and there is no hint of the witticism in
the book itself; the St. Gall
MS.
, however, has ‘Divi
Claudii
ÎÎ ÎÎÎÎÎ£ÎÎ£
Annei Senecae per Saturam,’ which
may be a corruption of the proper title. The title is
derived from
ÎºÎ¿Î»Î¿ÎºÏÎ½ÏÎ·
, ‘a gourd,’ which was used to
denote a fool. Seneca (
Apocol.
6) takes the official view
that Claudius died of a fever. The work may have been
published at the Saturnalia, and written shortly before, as
Narcissus is represented as having just arrived in Orcus.
The personal animosity of Seneca against Caligula and
Claudius is everywhere apparent.

5.
Naturales Quaestiones
in seven Books, addressed to
Lucilius. Book ii. was written after
A.D.
57, as in ii. 9, 2 an
amphitheatre is mentioned which was built by Nero in that
year. The work was finished before the end of
A.D.
64, for
in Book vii. there is no mention among other prodigies of
the comet which appeared again at the end of that year.

6.
Epistulae morales ad Lucilium
. These were addressed
to Lucilius Iunior, the author of ‘Aetna’ (see
p. 277
).
There are extant one hundred and twenty four letters, in
twenty Books, but some Books have been lost, as Gell. xii.
2, 3 quotes from Book xxii. Books i.-iii. were probably
published by Seneca, the rest after his death, generally in
chronological order.

The following poetical works are extant:

1.
Epigrams.
—Nine on his exile are given in the
editions; probably only Nos. 1, 2, and 7 are genuine.

2.
Tragedies.
—Some of these may have been composed
during Seneca’s exile in Corsica. See
ad Helv.
20 (quoted

p. 243
). The metrical treatment is strict, especially in the
senarii. Anapaestic, glyconic, sapphic lines, etc., are used
in the choral odes. There are only three actors, except
in the spurious
Octavia
. The plays are: (1)
Hercules
Furens
and (2)
Troades
or
Hecuba
, founded on Euripides.
(3)
Phoenissae
or
Thebais
. The two parts do not
correspond. In ll. 1-362, Oedipus and Antigone are on
their way to Cithaeron; from l. 363 to the end we find
Iocasta and Antigone in Thebes while it is besieged by
the Seven. (4)
Medea
, founded on Euripides. Ovid has also
been imitated; so ll. 56
sqq.
from Ovid,
Heroides
, 12, 137.
(5)
Phaedra
or
Hippolytus
. (6)
Oedipus
, after Sophocles.
(7)
Agamemnon
, after Aeschylus. (8)
Thyestes
. (9)
Hercules
Oetaeus
, of which the second part, at least, is spurious.
(10)
Octavia
, a praetexta, describing the death of Octavia,
Nero’s wife (
A.D.
62). Seneca himself appears in it. It
cannot be by Seneca, as Nero’s downfall (
A.D.
68) is
mentioned in ll. 628-36.

The following works are lost or exist only in fragments:

i. Poems of a light nature (Pliny,
Ep.
v. 3). 2.
De
motu terrarum
, afterwards incorporated in
N.Q.
vi. (see

N.Q.
vi. 4, 2). 3.
De lapidum natura
. 4.
De piscium
natura
. 5.
De ritu et sacris Aegyptiorum
(see
p. 242
).
6.
De situ Indiae
. 7.
De forma mundi
. 8.
Exhortationes
.
9.
De officiis
. 10.
De immatura morte
. 11.
De superstitione
dialogus
. 12.
De matrimonio
. 13.
De amicitia
.
14.
De vita patris
, along with an edition of his works.
15. Speeches by himself or by Nero. 16.
Epistulae
(a)
ad
Novatum
, probably written from Corsica, (b)
ad Caesonium
Maximum
. 17. A book in praise of Messalina, afterwards
withdrawn (see
p. 243
). 18.
Moralis philosophiae libri
(see

Ep.
106, 2). 19.
De remediis fortuitorum
, addressed to
Gallio. A synopsis with additions is extant. 20.
De
paupertate
. 21.
De formula honestae vitae
, probably founded
on one of Seneca’s works. 22.
Notae
(see Sueton. pp.
135-6
R.
).

The following are spurious works:

1. ‘Epistulae Senecae, Neronis imperatoris magistri, ad
Paulum Apostolum et Pauli Apostoli ad Senecam.’ These
letters, fourteen in all, are accepted as genuine by Jerome,

de vir. illustr.
12. ‘Seneca ... quem non ponerem in
catalogo sanctorum, nisi me epistulae illae provocarent,
quae leguntur a plurimis, Pauli ad Senecam et Senecae
ad Paulum.’

2. A work extant under the title of
Sententiae Rufi
has
been wrongly thought to correspond to Seneca’s dying
words mentioned in Tac.
Ann.
xv. 63.

3. The book
De moribus
or
Monita
contains maxims
by Christian writers.

Views and Character.
—For Seneca’s training in Stoic
doctrines see
Ep.
108, 13 (quoted
p. 241
). With these
views he generally associates himself (cf.
Ep.
113, 1;
117, 1), but does not bind himself to one school.

Cf.
Ep.
45, 4, ‘Non enim me cuiquam emancipavi,
nullius nomen fero. Multum magnorum virorum iudicio
credo, aliquid et meo vindico.’

Especially towards the end of his life, he came under
the influence of Demetrius the Cynic.

Ep.
62, 3, ‘Demetrium, virorum optimum, mecum circumfero
et relictis conchyliatis cum illo seminudo loquor,
ilium admiror. Quidni admirer? vidi nihil ei deesse.’

In
de provid.
5, 7, after quoting Demetrius’ fatalistic
views, Seneca adds, ‘Fata nos ducunt, et quantum cuique
temporis restat, prima nascentium hora disposuit.’

Seneca was one of the few Romans who condemned
the butcheries practised in the arena, and his views doubtless
influenced Nero’s conduct in
A.D.
58.

Ep.
95, 33, ‘Homo, sacra res homini, iam per lusum
ac iocum occiditur et quem erudiri ad inferenda accipiendaque
volnera nefas erat, is iam nudus inermisque producitur
satisque spectaculi ex homine mors est.’

Tac.
Ann.
xiii. 31, ‘Edixit Caesar ne quis magistratus
aut procurator, qui provinciam obtineret, spectaculum
gladiatorum aut ferarum aut quod aliud ludicrum ederet.’

For Seneca’s love of wealth see
p. 246
. For his estimate
of riches cf.
De vita beata
, 22, 5. ‘Apud me divitiae aliquem
locum habent, apud te summum ac postremum. Divitiae
meae sunt, tu divitiarum es.’

His simplicity of life has been already dealt with.

Dio, lxi. 10, 2, gives a most unjust account of Seneca’s
character:

.

Seneca followed no traditional style. Cf.
Ep.
100, 6,
‘De compositione non constat’;
Ep.
114, 13, ‘Oratio
certam regulam non habet.’ Quintilian, x. 1, 125-131, attacks
his style, though admitting his great powers.

CURTIUS RUFUS.

The full name is Q. Curtius Rufus, given in the
MSS.

of his work, ‘Historiarum Alexandri Magni Macedonis
Libri x.’, the first two Books of which are lost. Curtius
is not referred to by name by any ancient writer, but is
probably identical with the Q. Curtius Rufus mentioned in
the list prefixed to Sueton.
de claris oratoribus
between
M. Porcius Latro and L. Valerius Primanus. This order
favours the view that he belonged to the reign of Claudius,
a view supported by the two contemporary references in
Curtius:

iv. 4, 21 (of Tyre), ‘nunc tandem longa pace cuncta
refovente sub tutela Romanae mansuetudinis adquiescit.’

x. 9, 3-6, ‘Quod imperium sub uno stare potuisset,
dum a pluribus sustinetur, ruit. Proinde iure meritoque
populus Romanus salutem se principi suo debere profitetur,
qui noctis, quam paene supremam habuimus, novum sidus
inluxit. Huius hercule, non solis ortus lucem caliganti
reddidit mundo, cum sine suo capite discordia membra
trepidarent,’ etc.

This passage probably refers to the tumultuous scene
on the night between 24th and 25th Jan.,
A.D.
41, before
Claudius’ accession, after the murder of Caligula (cf. the
pun in
caliganti
), when rival claimants to the throne were
put forward, and the Senate wished to restore the republic
(cf.
discordia membra trepidarent
). Sen.
ad Polyb.
13, 1,
uses similar language of Claudius, ‘Sidus hoc, quod praecipitato
in profundum et demerso in tenebras orbi refulsit,
semper luceat.’

As Curtius says nothing but good about the reign of
Claudius, he probably wrote shortly after his accession.
The passage in iv. 4, 21 (above) also fits in with this view,
as there was little fighting in the Roman world from 17 to
43
A.D.
His bold tone with regard to rulers would also
suit this time, while it would have been dangerous under
Caligula, or from 43 to 54
A.D.

Cf. viii. 5, 6, ‘Non deerat talia concupiscenti perniciosa
adulatio, perpetuum malum regum, quorum opes saepius
adsentatio quam hostis evertit.’

This tone also renders it impossible to identify him with
Curtius Rufus, mentioned in Tac.
Ann.
xi. 21, as governor
of Africa, and as ‘adversus superiores tristi adulatione,
adrogans minoribus, inter pares difficilis.’

Seneca is supposed to have quoted his contemporary
Curtius once or twice. Cf. Sen.
Ep.
56, 9, ‘Nihil tam
certum est quam otii vitia negotio discuti’; and Curt.
vii. 1, 4, ‘Satis prudens, otii vitia negotio discuti.’ Cf.
also viii. 10, 29 with Sen.
Ep.
59, 12.

Curtius claims to transcribe his authorities carefully.
Cf. ix. 1, 34, ‘Equidem plura transscribo quam credo:
nam nec adfirmare sustineo, de quibus dubito, nec subducere
quae accepi.’

Curtius’ statements are usually parallel to those of one
or other of the historians of Alexander, but he appeals
only twice to other authorities by name.

ix. 8, 15, ‘Clitarchus (c. 300
B.C.
) est auctor.’

ix. 5, 21, ‘Ptolemaeum (c. 300
B.C.
), qui postea regnavit,
huic pugnae adfuisse auctor est Clitarchus et Timagenes
(c. 55
B.C.
). Sed ipse ... afuisse se missum in expeditionem
memoriae tradidit.’

The rhetorical tone of the work is seen in the speeches
and letters. For the latter cf. iv. 1, 10-74. Curtius has
little technical knowledge of war or politics. Thus Alexander’s
assumption of oriental pomp to conciliate the
Asiatics is looked on as
á½Î²ÏÎ¹Ï
. Cf. iii. 12, 18. Like Livy,
he attempts to depreciate Alexander’s abilities by unduly
accentuating his good fortune.

Cf. viii. 3, 1, ‘Sed hanc quoque expeditionem, ut pleraque
alia, fortuna indulgendo ei numquam fatigata pro absente
transegit.’

COLUMELLA.

L. Iunius Moderatus Columella was a native of Gades:
x. 185, ‘mea [lactuca] quam generant Tartessi littore
Gades.’ On an inscription he is styled ‘trib. mil. leg. vi.
ferratae’ (
C.I.L.
ix. 325), and it was probably in the course
of his military service that he visited Cilicia and Syria:
ii. 10, 18, ‘hoc semen Ciliciae Syriaeque regionibus ipse
vidi.’

His uncle, M. Columella, was a leading man in the
province of Baetica (v. 5, 15); and he himself possessed land
in Italy: iii. 9, 2, ‘cum et in Ardeatino agro, quem multis
temporibus ipsi ante possedimus, et in Carseolano itemque
in Albano generis Aminei vites huius modi notae habuerimus.’

He was a contemporary of the younger Seneca, who is
spoken of as alive (iii. 3, 3).

His chief work is
De Re Rustica
in twelve Books, dedicated
to P. Silvinus—a practical treatise on husbandry for
‘negotiosi agricolae’ (ix. 2, 5). Book x., on gardening,
is in hexameter verse, and was written at the suggestion
of Silvinus and another friend, to fill the gap which Virgil
had left in the Georgics (iv. 147-8); cf. the preface, ‘Cultus
hortorum ... sicut institueram, prosa oratione prioribus
subnecteretur exordiis, nisi propositum expugnasset frequens
postulatio tua, quae pervicit, ut poeticis numeris explerem
Georgici carminis omissas partes, quas tamen et ipse
Vergilius significaverat, posteris se memorandas relinquere.’

The last two Books were added as an afterthought;
xi. 1, 2, ‘numerum quem iam quasi consummaveram
voluminum excessi.’

Columella wrote before

A.D.
65 (see above); later than
Celsus, but earlier than the elder Pliny.

There is also extant a book
De Arboribus
, which formed
Book ii. of an earlier treatise on agriculture: cf. i. 1, ‘Quoniam
de cultu agrorum abunde primo volumine praecepisse
videmur, non intempestiva erit arborum virgultorumque
cura.’ It covers the same ground as
De R.R.
iii.-v.

Columella also wrote ‘adversus astrologos’ (xi. 1, 31),
and projected a treatise on the religious rites connected
with agriculture (ii. 22, 5, ‘lustrationum ceterorumque sacrificiorum,
quae pro frugibus fiunt, morem priscis
usurpatum’).

POMPONIUS MELA.

The geographer Pomponius Mela was a native of Tingentera in Spain (ii.
96). His date can be inferred from iii. 49; the ‘principum maximus’
mentioned there as triumphing over Britain might be either

Caligula

(in
A.D.
40) or

Claudius

(in 44); but the earlier date is favoured by Mela’s division of Africa
according to the system abolished by

Claudius

in 42 (i. 25-30). The title of his work is
De Chorographia
, in
three Books: the dryness of its details (i. 1, ‘opus impeditum et
facundiae minime capax’) is relieved by word-painting,
e.g.
the
description of Britain, iii. 49. The only authors to whom he
acknowledges obligations are Nepos (iii. 45) and Hanno (iii. 90).

PERSIUS.

(1) LIFE.

We possess a very full account of the life of Persius,
which, according to the
MSS.
, is taken from Probus’ commentary
on the poet, and may therefore be looked upon
as trustworthy. According to Probus (from whom are
taken the quotations throughout), he lived from 34 to
62
A.D.
: ‘Aulus Persius Flaccus natus est pridie Non.
Decembr. Fabio Persico L. Vitellio coss., decessit viii.
Kal. Decembr. Rubrio Mario Asinio Gallo coss.’ These
dates are confirmed by Jerome.

He was born at Volaterrae in Etruria, and was the son of
a Roman knight who died when Persius was quite young:

‘Natus in Etruria Volaterris, eques Romanus, sanguine
et affinitate primi ordinis viris coniunctus. Pater eum
Flaccus pupillum reliquit moriens annorum fere sex.’

‘Fulvia Sisennia (his mother) nupsit postea Fuscio
equiti Romano.’

After the completion of his early education (for which
see
Sat.
3, 44-51) he studied at Rome, where he came
under the influence of the Stoic Annaeus Cornutus:

‘Studuit Flaccus usque ad annum xii. aetatis suae
Volaterris, inde Romae apud grammaticum Remmium
Palaemonem et apud rhetorem Verginium Flavum. Cum
esset annorum xvi., amicitia coepit uti Annaei Cornuti, ita
ut nusquam ab eo discederet; inductus aliquatenus in
philosophiam est.’

In
Sat.
5, 21-24 and 30-51, he speaks in the highest
terms of Cornutus as his guide in life and close friend:
cf. esp. ll. 36-7,

‘teneros tu suspicis annos,

Socratico, Cornute, sinu.’

Among his other friends were Caesius Bassus (to whom

Sat.
6 is addressed), Lucan, Seneca, and his own relative,
Paetus Thrasea:

‘Cognovit per Cornutum etiam Annaeum Lucanum,
aequaevum auditorem Cornuti. Lucanus adeo mirabatur
scripta Flacci ut vix retineret se recitante eo cum clamore
quin illa esse vera poemata diceret, sua ipse ludos faceret.
Sero cognovit et Senecam, sed non ut caperetur eius
ingenio ... Idem decem fere annis summe dilectus a Paeto
Thrasea est, ita ut peregrinaretur quoque cum eo aliquando,
cognatam eius Arriam uxorem habente.’

Persius was a man of considerable means, as is shown
by his will and his landed property:

‘Reliquit circa HS vicies matri et sorori; scriptis
tamen ad matrem codicillis Cornuto rogavit ut daret sestertia
ut quidam centum, ut alii volunt ..., et argenti facti
pondo viginti, et libros circa septingentos sive bibliothecam
suam omnem. Verum a Cornuto sublatis libris, pecuniam
sororibus, quas heredes frater fecerat, reliquit.’

‘Decessit ad octavum miliarium via Appia in praediis
suis ... vitio stomachi anno aetatis xxviii.’

His character was lofty and disinterested:

‘Fuit morum lenissimorum, verecundiae virginalis, formae
pulchrae, pietatis erga matrem et sororem et amitam exemplo
sufficientis. Fuit frugi, pudicus.’

(2) WORKS.

1. His early works, which Cornutus caused to be
destroyed at his death, were:

(
a
) A praetexta, called
Vescia
(?).

(
b
) One Book of
á½Î´Î¿Î¹ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¬
, no doubt referring to his
travels with Thrasea.

(
c
) Some verses on Arria, the wife of Paetus.

‘Scripserat in pueritia Flaccus etiam praetextam Vesciam,
et
á½Î´Î¿Î¹ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¹Îºá¿¶Î½
librum unum, et paucos in socrum Thraseae
in Arriam matrem versus ... Omnia ea auctor fuit
Cornutus matri eius ut aboleret.’

2.
Satires.
There are six of these (in hexameters), with
a prologue (in scazons). Persius wrote slowly, and the
Book was left unfinished:

‘Et raro et tarde scripsit. Hunc ipsum librum imperfectum
reliquit. Versus aliqui dempti sunt ultimo libro,
ut quasi finitus esset. Leviter retractavit Cornutus, et
Caesio Basso petenti, ut ipsi cederet, tradidit edendum.’

The prologue, and the first satire (on literary criticism)—the only real satire he wrote—are said to be imitated
from Lucilius. The other five are largely Stoic dissertations
in verse, and show throughout the influence of Cornutus
and Persius’ other Stoic friends. Probus says he attacked
Nero’s poetry in
Sat.
1.

‘Lecto Lucilii libro x. vehementer satiras componere
instituit, cuius libri principium imitatus est ... cum tanta
recentium poetarum et oratorum insectatione, ut etiam
Neronem ... culpaverit, cuius versus in Neronem cum ita
se haberet:

‘Auriculas asini Mida rex habet,’

in eum modum a Cornuto, ipso iam tum mortuo, est
emendatus:

‘Auriculas asini quis non habet?’ [1, 121]

ne hoc Nero in se dictum arbitraretur.’

Sat.
1, 99-102 is said to be a travesty of Nero’s poetry.

Very few passages, however, are quoted by the Scholiasts
as modelled on Lucilius.

Persius refers to Lucilius and Horace in 1, 114-8:

‘Secuit Lucilius urbem,

te, Lupe, te, Muci, et genuinum fregit in illis;

omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico

tangit, et admissus circum praecordia ludit,

callidus excusso populum suspendere naso.’

His obligations to Horace are paramount, imitations—often unintentional burlesques—occurring everywhere. Examples
are: 1, 42,

‘cedro digna locutus,

linquere nec scombros metuentia carmina nec tus.’

from Hor.
A.P.
331,

‘carmina ... linenda cedro’;

and Hor.
Ep.
ii. 1, 269,

‘Deferar in vicum vendentem tus et odores

et piper et quidquid chartis amicitur

ineptis.’

Again, 5, 103,

‘exclamet Melicerta perisse

frontem de rebus’;

from Hor.
Ep.
ii. 1, 80,

‘clament periise pudorem

cuncti paene patres.’

He even borrows Horace’s names: Pedius (1, 85), Natta
(3, 31), Nerius (2, 14), Craterus (3, 65), Bestius (6, 37).

The statement of Joannes Lydus (i. 41) that Persius
imitated the mimic writer, Sophron, has little to support it.

Probus says the work became immediately popular:
‘Editum librum continuo mirari homines et diripere
coeperunt.’

Cf. also Quint. x. 1, 94, ‘multum et verae gloriae quamvis
uno libro Persius meruit’; Mart. iv. 29, 7,

‘Saepius in libro memoratur Persius uno

quam levis in tota Marsus Amazonide.’

LUCAN.

(1) LIFE.

Besides references to Lucan in other writers, especially
Statius, Martial, and Tacitus, we have three biographies of
him: (1) a short and defective life, probably by Suetonius,
and showing his well-known hatred of the Annaei; (2) one
by Vacca, a commentator on Lucan, who lived probably
in the sixth century, complete and favourable; (3) one in
Codex Vossianus ii. The last two are in part derived
from the first.

M. Annaeus Lucanus was born at Corduba in Hispania
Baetica, and was the son of M. Annaeus Mela, a Roman
knight, and nephew of M. Annaeus Novatus (the Gallio
of Acts 18, 12-17) and L. Annaeus Seneca the philosopher.

Vacca,
vit. Luc.
, ‘M. Annaeus Lucanus patrem habuit
M. Annaeum Melam ex provincia Baetica Hispaniae interioris
Cordubensem equitem Romanum, illustrem inter suos,
notum Romae et propter Senecam fratrem, clarum per
omnes virtutes virum, et propter studium vitae quietioris ...
Matrem habuit et regionis eiusdem et urbis Aciliam
nomine, Acilii Lucani filiam ... cuius cognomen huic
inditum apparet.’

Tac.
Ann.
xvi. 17, ‘Mela, quibus Gallio et Seneca,
parentibus natus ... Idem Annaeum Lucanum genuerat,
grande adiumentum claritudinis.’

Lucan was born Nov. 3,
A.D.
39, and was removed to
Rome when eight months old.

Vacca,
ibid.
, ‘Natus est iii. Non. Novembr. C. Caesare
Germanico ii. L. Apronio Caesiano coss. Octavum mensem
agens Romam translatus est.’

He had a successful school and college career. One of
his teachers was Cornutus, through whom he knew Persius
(see
p. 261
).

Vacca,
ibid.
, ‘A praeceptoribus tunc eminentissimis est
eruditus eosque intra breve temporis spatium ingenio
adaequavit ... Declamavit et graece et latine cum magna
admiratione audientium.’

His first literary success was the
laudes Neronis
in
A.D.

60; this led to his political advancement.

Sueton.
vit. Luc.
, ‘Prima ingenii experimenta in Neronis
laudibus dedit quinquennali certamine.’

Vacca,
ibid.
, ‘Ob quod puerili mutato in senatorium
cultum et in notitiam Caesaris Neronis facile pervenit et
honore vixdum aetati debito dignus iudicatus est. Gessit
autem quaesturam, in qua cum collegis more tunc usitato
munus gladiatorium edidit secundo populi favore; sacerdotium
etiam accepit auguratus.’

Similarly Suetonius, who also tells us that Lucan had
been in Athens.

Sueton.
ibid.
, ‘Revocatus Athenis a Nerone cohortique
amicorum additus atque etiam quaestura honoratus, non
tamen permansit in gratia.’

The reason of the strained relations between Lucan and
the emperor was, according to Suetonius, that Lucan had
behaved rudely when reciting in public. Vacca says the
reason lay in the jealousy felt by Nero, who forbade Lucan
to write poetry or to plead causes.

Vacca,
ibid.
, ‘Quippe et certamine pentaeterico acto in
Pompei theatro laudibus recitatis in Neronem fuerat coronatus
et ex tempore Orphea scriptum in experimentum
adversum conplures ediderat poetas et tres libros, quales
videmus. Quare inimicum sibi fecerat imperatorem. Quo
ambitiosa vanitate, non hominum tantum, sed et artium
sibi principatum vindicante interdictum est ei poetica,
interdictum est etiam causarum actionibus.’

Cf. Tac.
Ann.
xv. 49, ‘Famam carminum eius premebat
Nero prohibueratque ostentare, vanus adsimulatione.’

Lucan replied by a poem satirizing Nero and his court.

Sueton.
ibid.
, ‘Sed et famoso carmine cum ipsum tum
potentissimos amicorum gravissime proscidit.’

Lucan joined the conspiracy of Piso which was started

A.D.
62, but was discovered, and compelled to commit
suicide, 30th April,
A.D.
65.

Sueton.
ibid.
, ‘Paene signifer Pisonianae coniurationis
extitit.’

Vacca,
ibid.
, ‘A coniuratis in caedem Neronis socius
adsumptus est, sed parum fauste. Deceptus est a Pisone ...
Sua sponte coactus vita excedere venas sibi praecidit
periitque pridie Kal. Maias Attico Vestino et Nerva Siliano
coss., xxvi. aetatis annum agens.’

Tac.
Ann.
xv. 70, ‘Exin Annaei Lucani caedem imperat.
Is, profluente sanguine, ubi frigescere pedes manusque et
paulatim ab extremis cedere spiritum fervido adhuc et
compote mentis pectore intellegit, recordatus carmen a se
compositum, quo volneratum militem per eius modi mortis
imaginem obisse tradiderat, versus ipsos rettulit, eaque illi
suprema vox fuit.’

Suetonius (corroborated by Tac.
Ann.
xv. 56) says that
Lucan named his mother as a fellow-conspirator.

‘Verum detecta coniuratione nequaquam parem animi
constantiam praestitit. Facile enim confessus et ad humillimas
devolutus preces matrem quoque innoxiam inter
socios nominavit, sperans impietatem sibi apud parricidam
principem profuturam.... Epulatus largiter brachia ad
secandas venas praebuit medico.’

Lucan married Polla Argentaria. Statius and Martial
were her friends, and seem to have kept up an observance
of Lucan’s birthday.

Cf. especially Statius,
Silvae
, ii. 7, on which the author,
in his preface to the book, says, ‘Cludit volumen genethliacon
Lucani, quod Polla Argentaria, clarissima uxorum,
cum hunc diem forte consecraremus, imputari sibi
voluit.’

Martial vii. 21, 22, and 23 are written on the subject of
Lucan’s birthday.

(2) WORKS.

1. The only extant work of Lucan is
De Bello Civili.

This is the title in the
MSS.
, and in Petron. 118. The
usual title comes from ix. 985, ‘Pharsalia nostra vivet,’
words which come after a list of places in Greece and Asia
immortalized by the poets, and which mean ‘My story of
Pharsalus shall live.’ There is no evidence that Lucan
gave the poem this title.

2.
Lost works.
Vacca mentions the following:

(
a
) In verse: Orpheus; Iliacon; Saturnalia; Catachthonion;
Silvarum x.; tragoedia Medea (imperfecta):
Salticae Fabulae, xiv.; epigrammata.

(
b
) In prose: Oratio in Octavium Sagittam et pro eo;
de incendio urbis; epistulae ex Campania.

Suetonius also mentions ‘Neronis laudes; famosum
carmen in Neronem.’ Stat.
Silv.
ii. 7, 62, mentions another
work—‘allocutio ad Pollam’ (his wife).

Lucan’s works became immediately popular.

Sueton.
ibid.
, ‘Poemata eius etiam praelegi memini,
confici vero ac proponi, non tantum operose et diligenter,
sed et inepte quoque.’

Mart. xiv. 194,

‘Sunt quidam qui me dicunt non esse poetam:

sed qui me vendit bibliopola putat.’

The epic poem
De Bello Civili
in ten Books (the last
incomplete) carries the story of the Civil War down to the
point where Caesar is besieged in Alexandria. Vacca informs
us that Lucan did not live to correct the last seven
Books.

‘Ediderat ... tres libros quales videmus ... Reliqui vii.
belli civilis libri locum calumniantibus tamquam mendosi
non darent, qui tametsi sub vero crimine non egent patrocinio:
in isdem dici, quod in Ovidii libris praescribitur,
potest: “emendaturus, si licuisset, erat.”’

Lucan’s political views.
—The first three Books were
published when Lucan was still on good terms with Nero
(cf. the gross flattery in i. 33-66), but practically the same
view of the empire is taken throughout the poem; only Lucan
expresses his views with greater vigour in the last seven
Books; and, while in Books i.-iii. the question is one
between Caesar and Pompey, afterwards it is one between
Caesar and liberty. Even in Books i.-iii. Caesar is the
villain of the piece; Pompey embodies all that is good;
Cato and Brutus are highly spoken of; the former stands as
the ideal Stoic. The Senate, except in Book v.
ad init.
,
appears in a rather unfavourable light, and so does the
plebs. Lucan did not want the re-establishment of the
republican oligarchy, but acquiesced in the empire as being
ordained by fate. This is borne out by what we know of
the Pisonian conspiracy, the object of which was not to
re-establish the republic, but to put some leading man like
Seneca on the throne. A few quotations will exemplify
these points:

(1) The empire; iv. 691,

‘Libyamque auferre tyranno

dum regnum te, Roma, facit’;

vii. 432,

‘Quod fugiens civile nefas redituraque nunquam

libertas ultra Tigrim Rhenumque recessit’;

vii. 442,

‘Felices Arabes Medique eoaque tellus,

quam sub perpetuis tenuerunt fata tyrannis.

Ex populis qui regna ferunt, sors ultima nostra est,

quos servire pudet.’

(2) Pompeius; ii. 732-6,

‘Non quia te superi patrio privare sepulchro

maluerint, Phariae busto damnantur harenae:

parcitur Hesperiae; procul hoc et in orbe remoto

abscondat fortuna nefas, Romanaque tellus

inmaculata sui servetur sanguine Magni.’

Cf. ix. 601-4 (where apotheosis is assigned him).

(3) Cato (the hero of Book ix.) and Brutus; ii. 234,

‘At non magnanimi percussit pectora Bruti

terror’;

ix. 554,

‘Nam cui crediderim superos arcana daturos

dicturosque magis quam sancto vera Catoni?’

Cf. ix. 186-9.

(4) Caesar; ii. 439,

‘Caesar in arma furens nullas nisi sanguine fuso

gaudet habere vias’;

v. 242,

‘perdere successus scelerum’;

vii. 593,

‘nondum attigit arcem

iuris et humanum columen, quo cuncta premuntur,

egressus meruit fatis tam nobile letum.

Vivat et, ut Bruti procumbat victima, regnet.’

Caesar’s acts are sometimes unfairly represented, as in
vii. 798
sqq.
, ix. 1035
sqq.
(on viewing Pompeius’ corpse);
ll. 1038-9,

‘lacrimas non sponte cadentis

effudit gemitusque expressit pectore laeto.’

Lucan’s philosophical and religious views.
—His Stoicism
comes out strongly in the poem, ix. 566-84 (speech of Cato),
especially 578-80,

‘Estque dei sedes, nisi terra et pontus et aÃ«r

et caelum et virtus? Superos quid quaerimus ultra?

Iuppiter est, quodcumque vides, quodcumque moveris?’

vii. 814,

‘Communis mundo superest rogus ossibus astra

mixturus.’

Note especially the very frequent references to fate; i. 263-4,

‘cunctasque pudoris

rumpunt fata moras.’

The gods are not introduced as chief agents; cf. the
censure of Petronius quoted below. Lucan prides himself
on despising the gods, and substitutes for them his favourite
divinity, Fortuna; i. 128,

‘Victrix causa deis placuit, sed victa Catoni’;

vii. 445,

‘Sunt nobis nulla profecto

numina; cum caeco rapiantur saecula casu,

mentimur regnare Iovem.’

Rhetorical treatment
is seen in (1) the vast amount of
hyperbole employed; cf. the account of the siege of
Massilia, iii. 538-762; (2) the geographical and mythological
learning introduced. This is sometimes inaccurate;
the best known instance is his confusion of Pharsalus and
Philippi; cf. i. 1 and 688.

Lucan’s models.
—(1) For diction, chiefly Virgil.
[77]
Horace
and Ovid are also imitated.

(2) For history Lucan is supposed to have used Livy
mostly. How far he used other authorities is unknown.
His history is sometimes inexact. In ii. 478
sqq.
the
character of L. Domitius Ahenobarbus is falsely portrayed.
So the journey of Cato to the shrine of Hammon, ix. 511
sqq.

(3) Seneca is one of his authorities for science and philosophy.
Thus in describing the Nile, x. 194-331, Lucan
has used Seneca,
Nat. Quaest.
iv. 1-2. The biographer of
the
Codex Vossianus
ii. attributes (probably wrongly) the
first seven verses of Book i. to Seneca.

‘Seneca, qui fuit avonculus eius, quia ex abrupto incohabat,
hos vii. versus addidit: “Bella per Emathios” usque “et
pila minantia pilis.”’

Criticisms of Lucan.
—Petronius, in introducing his parody
of Lucan, says, Â§ 118, ‘Ecce belli civilis ingens opus quisquis
attigerit, nisi plenus litteris, sub onere labetur. Non
enim res gestae versibus comprehendendae sunt, quod longe
melius historici faciunt, sed per ambages deorumque ministeria
et fabulosum sententiarum tormentum praecipitandus
est liber spiritus.’ See
p. 275
.

Quint. x. 1, 90, ‘Lucanus ardens et concitatus et sententiis
clarissimus et, ut dicam quod sentio, magis oratoribus quam
poetis imitandus.’

PETRONIUS.

The
Satirae
of Petronius are attributed in the
MSS.
to
Petronius Arbiter. It is practically certain that the author
was C. Petronius, once proconsul of Bithynia and afterwards
consul, who was long a member of Nero’s inner
circle, and who, in
A.D.
66, when accused by Tigellinus,
anticipated execution by suicide.

Tac.
Ann.
xvi. 18, ‘Proconsul Bithyniae, et mox consul,
vigentem se ac parem negotiis ostendit. Dein revolutus
ad vitia, seu vitiorum imitatione, inter paucos familiarium
Neroni adsumptus est, elegantiae arbiter, dum nihil
amoenum et molle adfluentia putat, nisi quod ei Petronius
adprobavisset. Unde invidia Tigellini ... (Ch. 19) Forte ...
Campaniam petiverat Caesar, et Cumas usque progressus
Petronius illic attinebatur. Nec tulit ultra timoris aut spei
moras. Neque tamen praeceps vitam expulit, sed incisas
venas, ut libitum, obligatas aperire rursum, et adloqui
amicos, non per seria aut quibus gloriam constantiae
peteret ... Flagitia principis sub nominibus exoletorum
feminarumque et novitatem cuiusque stupri perscripsit,
atque obsignata misit Neroni.’

The document mentioned above as sent to Nero has
nothing to do with the extant
Satirae
. That C. Petronius
is the author of the work is rendered even more certain
from the fact that it was obviously written in Nero’s time by
a man of high culture and knowledge of the world.

The novel contains an account of the adventures of a
certain Encolpius, as told by himself. Encolpius comes in
contact with Priapus in Massilia, Cumae, and Croton; and
probably the wrath of Priapus (a parody of the wrath of
Poseidon in the Odyssey) is the leading motive that binds
the disjointed parts. Cf. ch. 139,

‘Me quoque per terras, per cani Nereos aequor

Hellespontiaci sequitur gravis ira Priapi.’

The work, the extant parts of which are from Books xv.
and xvi., is in form a Satira Menippea,
[78]
alternately prose
and verse. The longer episodes, as the supper of Trimalchio
and the story of the matron of Ephesus, are exclusively
prose. In the
Cena Trimalchionis
, where Encolpius and his
company are entertained by a rich freedman, Petronius has
given us a correct account of provincial life in South Italy.
Mommsen (
Hermes
, xiii. 106) has shown that Cumae was
the town where Trimalchio lived. It is a ‘Graeca urbs’
(ch. 81), and a Roman colony (ch. 44, etc.), so that it
cannot be Naples. The chief magistrates are called

praetores
(ch. 65), which suits Cumae alone of the towns
of this district. The only objection to Cumae being the
place is the passage in ch. 48, where an event at Cumae
is given as something wonderful and unusual:

‘Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi
in ampulla pendere, et cum illi pueri dicerent:
Î£Î¯Î²Ï
Î»Î»Î±,
ÏÎ¯ Î¸Î­Î»ÎµÎ¹Ï;
respondebat illa:
á¼ÏÎ¿Î¸Î±Î½Îµá¿Î½ Î¸Î­Î»Ï
.’

This, however, may simply be given for comic effect.
FriedlÃ¤nder thinks
Cumis
is a wrong reading. The date
of Encolpius’ adventures cannot be under Tiberius, for the
emperor is called ‘pater patriae’ (ch. 60), a title which
Tiberius refused. Mommsen thinks the dramatic date is
under Augustus; FriedlÃ¤nder,
[79]
towards the end of Claudius’
or the beginning of Nero’s reign. The cognomen of Trimalchio,
Maecenatianus (ch. 71), means that he was a freedman
of the well-known Maecenas. Trimalchio, therefore, came
to Rome as a boy (ch. 29; 75) before Maecenas’ death
(
B.C.
8), and was probably born about
B.C.
18. He is
represented as ‘senex’ (ch. 27),
i.e.
at least sixty, but may
have been over seventy.
A.D.
57 is probably the later limit
of date. Mommsen thinks that the words (ch. 57), ‘puer
capillatus in hanc coloniam veni: adhuc basilica non erat
facta,’ mean that when Trimalchio came to Cumae it was
not a Roman colony. Now, Cumae became a colony
between 43 and 27
B.C.
, and, on this supposition, the
supper of Trimalchio would have to be placed between

A.D.
7 and
A.D.
23, as it is about fifty years since Trimalchio
came to Cumae. FriedlÃ¤nder, however, thinks that the
basilica would not have been put up immediately the town
became a colony.

The language of the narrative is that of the educated
classes of the time, and is in close agreement with the style
of Seneca the younger. The diction of Trimalchio and his
fellow-freedman is the South Italian popular speech of the
time, filled with grammatical mistakes and provincialisms,
and rich in proverbial expressions. The longest poems in
the work are: (1)
Troiae halosis
(ch. 89), 65 senarii,
supposed to be a parody of Nero’s poem of the same name;
(2)
De bello civili
(ch. 119-124), 295 hexameters, in which
Lucan’s style is imitated and sometimes parodied. Cf.
ll. 26-7,

‘Et laxi crines et tot nova nomina vestis,

quaeque virum quaerunt,’

with Lucan, i. 164-5,

‘Cultus gestare decoros

vix nuribus rapuere mares’;

and ll. 51-2,

‘Praeterea gemino deprensam gurgite plebem

faenoris illuvies ususque exederat aeris,’

with Lucan, i. 181,

‘Hinc usura vorax, avidumque in tempora faenus.’

CALPURNIUS SICULUS.

Eleven eclogues used to be attributed to T. Calpurnius
Siculus, but only the first seven are his work, the last four
being written by M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus in the
second half of the 3rd century
A.D.
A
MS.
now lost gave
before
Ecl.
1, ‘Titi Calphurnii Siculi bucolicum carmen ...
incipit’; and before
Ecl.
8, ‘Aurelii Nemesiani poetae
Carthaginiensis ecloga prima incipit.’

Some information about Calpurnius’ life is got from his
works. In 4, 17-8, he (as Corydon) mentions a brother;
in 4, 155-6, he speaks of his poverty; and in 4, 29
sqq.
, of
Meliboeus as having come to his assistance when about to
leave for Spain; cf.
Ecl.
4, 36-42,

Ecce nihil querulum per te, Meliboee, sonamus;

per te secura saturi recubamus in umbra,

et fruimur silvis Amaryllidos, ultima nuper

litora terrarum, nisi tu, Meliboee, fuisses,

ultima visuri, trucibusque obnoxia Mauris
pascua Geryonis.

The old theory was that Calpurnius lived in the time of
Carus and his sons (in the second half of the 3rd century

A.D.
), but the facts fit in best with the view that he lived at
the beginning of Nero’s reign. (1) Meliboeus in
Ecl.
4
probably stands for Seneca (others suppose Calpurnius
Piso to be meant); 4, 53-7,

Nam tibi non tantum venturos discere nimbos

agricolis qualemque ferat sol aureus ortum,

attribuere dei, sed dulcia carmina saepe

concinis.

These lines agree with the fact of Seneca’s being the author
of
Naturales Quaestiones
and of tragedies. (2)
Ecl.
i. 77-83
refers to the comet which appeared at the beginning of
Nero’s reign. (3) References to Nero’s youth and beauty,
poetical gifts, the games he gave, and the new era of peace
he introduced; 1, 42-5,

Aurea secura cum pace renascitur aetas,

et redit ad terras tandem squalore situque

alma Themis posito, iuvenemque beata secuntur

saecula, maternis causam qui vicit in ulnis

7, 6,

quae patula iuvenis deus edit harena.

Cf. also 1, 84-8; 4, 84-9; 7, 83-4.
Ecl.
7 used to be taken
as referring to the Colosseum, which was not commenced
till about
A.D.
77; but the games may be those mentioned
in Sueton.
Nero
, 11, and the wooden amphitheatre in 7,
23-4, may be that mentioned by Sueton.
Nero
, 12, and Tac.

Ann.
xiii. 31.

The difference of authorship of
Ecl.
1-7 and of
Ecl.
8-11
is shown by the following: (1) Final
Å

shows classical usage
in 1-7, but in 8-11 we have
expectÅ
(9, 26),
coniungÅ
(10, 14),

ambÅ
(9, 17), and the like; (2) 1-7 show only eight elisions,
7-11 show thirty-nine; (3) no ending like
montivagus Pan

(10, 17) is found in 1-7; (4)
fateor
and
memini
used parenthetically
are common in 1-7, and not found in 8-11; (5)
there are no allusions to the emperor in 8-11; (6)
Ecl.
9
shows imitations of
Ecl.
2 and 3; (7) 8-11 agree in many
points with Nemesianus’
Cynegetica
.

The
Eclogues
are modelled chiefly on Virgil and Theocritus,

e.g.

Ecl.
3 on Verg.
Ecl.
7 and Theocr. 3, 14,
and 23.

The poem
de laude Pisonis
is now generally attributed to
Calpurnius Siculus. One point of similarity with Calpurnius’
other poems is the rareness of elision, there being only two
instances (ll. 24, 259). The description of Piso’s liberality
and eloquence (ll. 32, 88, 97
sqq.
) and of his skill in
draughts (ll. 178-96) corresponds with the information
given by Tac.
Ann.
xv. 48 and the Schol. on Iuv. 5, 109,
about Calpurnius Piso, who flourished under Claudius.

AETNA.

This poem, in 645 hexameter lines, is attributed to
Virgil in the
MSS.
, but is probably by Lucilius Iunior,
to whom Seneca addresses his
Epistulae Morales
,
De
Providentia
, and
Quaestiones Naturales
. Lucilius was
younger than Seneca (Sen.
Ep.
26, 7, ‘iuvenior es’), and
was born at Naples or Pompeii.

Sen.
Ep.
49, 1, ‘Ecce Campania et maxime Neapolis
ad Pompeiorum tuorum conspectum incredibile est quam
recens desiderium tui fecerint.’

Lucilius had held procuratorial offices in Alpes Graiae
et Poeninae, Epirus, Creta et Cyrene, and Sicily.

Ibid.
44, 2, ‘Eques Romanus es et ad hunc ordinem
tua te perduxit industria.’
Ibid.
31, 9, ‘Quo modo,
inquis, isto pervenitur? Non per Poeninum Graiumve
montem, nec per deserta Candaviae, nec Syrtes tibi nec
Scylla aut Charybdis adeundae sunt, quae tamen omnia
transisti procuratiunculae pretio.’
[80]

Sen.
N.Q.
iv. praef. 1, ‘Delectat te, Lucili, Sicilia et
officium procurationis otiosae.’

For his life cf. also the words put into his mouth by
Sen.
N.Q.
iv. praef. 15-17, which show his loyalty to his
friends, ‘Non mihi in amicitia Gaetulici (died
A.D.
39) vel
Gaius fidem eripuit, non in aliorum persona infeliciter
amatorum Messalla et Narcissus ... propositum meum
avertere potuerunt.... videbam apud Gaium tormenta, videbam
ignes.’
[81]

Seneca speaks of him as a pupil in philosophy in
Ep.

34, 2, ‘Adsero te mihi: meum opus es.’

A literary work of his is spoken of by Seneca, also a
poem in which he mentions Alpheus and Arethusa:

Ep.
46, 1, ‘Librum tuum, quem mihi promiseras, accepi.
Levis mihi visus est, cum esset nec mei nec tui corporis,
sed qui primo adspectu aut T. Livi aut Epicuri posset
videri.... Non tantum delectatus, sed gavisus sum.’

N.Q.
iii. 26, 6, ‘Hoc et a te traditum est ut in
poemate, Lucili carissime, et a Vergilio, qui adloquitur
Arethusam.’

A poem on Aetna is referred to in
Ep.
79, 5-7, ‘Donec
pudor obstet, ne Aetnam describas in tuo carmine et hunc
sollemnem omnibus poetis locum adtingas; quem quo
minus Ovidius tractaret, nihil obstitit, quod iam Vergilius
impleverat ... Aut ego te non novi aut Aetna tibi salivam
movet: iam cupis grande aliquid et par prioribus scribere.’

Some authorities think that Lucilius had meant to
incorporate this description in a larger poem, but changed
his mind, and wrote a poem on Aetna alone.

As regards the date of the poem: (1) It was written
at a time when imitation of Ovid was common. Cf. Sen.

N.Q.
iv. 2, 2, ‘Quare non cum poeta meo iocor et illi
Ovidium suum impingo?’ (2) There is no mention of
Vesuvius in the list of volcanoes in 1. 425
sqq.
The
poem must therefore have been written before
A.D.
79.

The following are the arguments for Lucilius having
been the author:

(1) The poem was written by one who knew Aetna
and the vicinity. Now Lucilius was long procurator of
Sicily.

(2) Military metaphors, as ll. 464-74, would fit in
with his having been a soldier.

(3) The author speaks as if he knew the neighbourhood
of Naples well.

(4) However, the argument that the writer shows
Epicurean views, and that Lucilius was an Epicurean,
has little weight. (
a
) There are Stoical doctrines in the
poem. Cf. ll. 33-5, 68-70, on the divinity of the stars;
ll. 173-4, which maintain that the world would come
back to its former state; ll. 536-9, where Heraclitus’
doctrine of fire is recommended. (
b
) The
Epistulae
Morales
only show that Lucilius had a leaning to
Epicureanism, not that he was an Epicurean.
Cf.
Ep.
23, 9, ‘Vocem tibi Epicuri tui reddere,’
and other playful references.

(5) The views on natural science given in the poem
are sometimes the same as those in Sen.
N.Q.
This
would fix the date of the poem between 65 and 79
A.D.

Cf.
Aetna
, 123,

‘Flumina quin etiam latis currentia rivis

occasus habuere suos: aut illa vorago

derepta in praeceps fatali condidit ore

aut occulta fluunt tectis adoperta cavernis

atque inopinatos referunt procul edita cursus’;

and Sen.
N.Q.
iii. 26, 3, ‘Quaedam flumina palam in
aliquem specum decidunt et sic ex oculis auferuntur,
quaedam consumuntur paulatim et intercidunt. Eadem
ex intervallo revertuntur recipiuntque et nomen et cursum.’
Cf. also
Aetna
, 96,

‘Defit namque omnis hiatu,

secta est omnis humus penitusque cavata latebris

exiles suspensa vias agit’;

and Sen.
N.Q.
v. 14, 1, ‘Non tota solido contextu terra
in imum usque fundatur, sed multis partibus cava et
caecis suspensa latebris.’ So the story of the Catanian
brothers (ll. 624-45) is told by Sen.
De Benef.
iii. 37, 2-3.

Imitations of Lucretius abound. Cf. ll. 219
sqq.
,

‘Nunc quoniam in promptu est operis natura solique,

unde ipsi venti, quae res incendia pascit,’ etc.

For the author’s attacks on superstition, cf. ll. 91-3,

‘Debita carminibus libertas ista; sed omnis

in vero mihi cura: canam quo fervida motu

aestuet Aetna novosque rapax sibi congerat ignes.’

A version of the
Phaenomena
of Aratus is extant, the
author of which is called in the
MSS.
‘Claudius Caesar,’
or ‘Germanicus.’ He is generally identified with
Germanicus, the adopted son of Tiberius (so Jerome and
Lactantius), though in modern times the poem has been
ascribed to Domitian, who had the title of ‘Germanicus’
from
A.D.
84. There are also fragments of
Prognostica
,
which are independent of Aratus.

PLINY THE ELDER.

(1) LIFE.

There is a very brief life of Pliny by Suetonius, but most
of our information about him is derived from his own writings
and the letters of his nephew (Plin.
Ep.
iii. 5;
v. 8; vi. 16; vi. 20).

C. Plinius Secundus was born
A.D.
23 or 24, for at the
time of his death in
A.D.
79 he was in his fifty-sixth year
(Plin.
Ep.
iii. 5, 7, ‘decessisse anno sexto et
quinquagesimo’). His birthplace was Comum in Cisalpine Gaul,
according to Sueton.
vit. Plin.
In an anonymous Life
he is styled ‘Veronensis,’ probably on account of the phrase
in
N.H.
praef. 1, ‘Catullum conterraneum meum,’ where,
however,
terra
means Gallia, the province, not the city.

Pliny was the son of an
eques
, and had a sister
married to L. Caecilius of Novum Comum (see
p. 139
).
He came to Rome not later than
A.D.
35 (
N.H.

xxxvii. 81, ‘Servilii Noniani quem consulem vidimus’),
and was trained in poetry and literature, probably by
P. Pomponius Secundus
[82]
; his instructors in rhetoric
are not known, but he mentions as rhetoricians Remmius
Palaemon (xiv. 49) and Arellius Fuscus (xxxiii. 152). In
botany he learned much from Antonius Castor (xxv. 9).

At the beginning of the reign of Claudius, Pliny was an
eye-witness of the building operations at the harbour of
Ostia,
A.D.
42 (ix. 14): in 44 he practised in the law
courts. Having decided on a military career, he would
begin, according to the regulation of Claudius (Sueton.

Claud.
25), with the command of a cohort of infantry.
He was next
praefectus alae
(Plin.
Ep.
iii. 5, 3) under
Corbulo, who was
legatus
of Germania Inferior,
A.D.
47,
in his campaign against the Chauci: cf.
N.H.
xvi. 2, ‘Sunt
vero in septemtrione visae nobis Chaucorum [gentes]’;
and in
A.D.
50 fought under Pomponius against the Chatti.
His ‘castrense contubernium’ with Titus (born
A.D.
41)
was probably in 55 or 56, when he was in the army of
Pompeius Paulinus: cf. xxxiii. 143, ‘Pompeium Paulinum
XII pondo argenti habuisse apud exercitum ferocissimis
gentibus oppositum scimus.’ Personal knowledge of Germany
appears in several passages of the
N.H.
, e.g. xii. 98,
‘extremo in margine imperii, qua Rhenus adluit, vidi’;
xxii. 8, ‘quem morem etiam nunc durare apud Germanos
scio.’

Pliny was present at the festivities at Lake Fucinus in

A.D.
52 (xxxiii. 63). During Nero’s reign he spent some
time in Campania (ii. 180) and Cisalpine Gaul (xxxv. 20),
was a spectator at the Vatican games in
A.D.
59, and saw
the building of Nero’s golden house after the fire of
A.D.
64
(xxxvi. iii).

Under Vespasian Pliny was procurator in Italy, and in
several of the provinces: Sueton.
vit.
, ‘Procurationes
splendidissimas et continuas summa integritate administravit.’
(
a
) Hispania Tarraconensis: Plin.
Ep.
iii. 5, 17,
‘cum procuraret in Hispania’; (
b
) Gallia Narbonensis:

N.H.
ii. 150, ‘ego vidi in Vocontiorum agro’; (
c
) Gallia
Belgica: xviii. 183, ‘nec recens subtrahemus exemplum in
Treverico agro tertio ante hoc anno compertum’; (
d
)
Africa: vii. 36, ‘ipse in Africa vidi.’ For his intimacy
with Vespasian cf. Plin.
Ep.
iii. 5, 9, ‘ante lucem ibat ad
Vespasianum imperatorem ... inde ad delegatum sibi
officium.’

In
A.D.
79 Pliny was in command of the fleet at
Misenum, when his scientific interest in the eruption of
Vesuvius led him to approach too near the volcano, with
the result that he was suffocated by the ashes (24th
August). For a detailed account of his death, see Plin.

Ep.
vi. 16 (to Tacitus). Cf. Sueton.
vit.
, ‘Periit clade
Campaniae. Cum enim Misenensi classi praeesset, et
flagrante Vesuvio ad explorandas propius causas liburnica
pertendisset, neque adversantibus ventis remeare posset, vi
pulveris ac favillae oppressus est, vel, ut quidam existimant,
a servo suo occisus, quem aestu deficiens ut necem sibi
maturaret oraverit.’

(2) WORKS.

A chronological list of Pliny’s writings is given by his
nephew (
Ep.
iii. 5).

1.
De iaculatione equestri
.—‘Hunc, cum praefectus alae
militaret, pari ingenio curaque composuit.’ This manual
on the javelin as a cavalry weapon is mentioned by Pliny
himself,
N.H.
viii. 162, ‘Nos diximus in libro de iaculatione
equestri condito.’

2.
De vita Pomponii Secundi
, in two Books, a tribute to
the memory of a valued friend, the tragic poet Pomponius.
Cf.
N.H.
xiv. 56, ‘referentes vitam Pomponii Secundi vatis.’

3.
Bella Germaniae
, in twenty Books, a narrative of the
Roman wars in Germany; begun by Pliny when serving
in that country, the apparition of Drusus having besought
him to rescue his name from oblivion (so Pliny the
younger). Cf. Tac.
Ann.
i. 69, ‘Tradit C. Plinius, Germanicorum
bellorum scriptor.’

4.
Studiosus
, in three Books or six parts, a treatise on
rhetoric from the very rudiments. Quintilian, though surprised
at some of Pliny’s views (xi. 3, 143; 148), numbers
him among the more careful exponents of the subject (iii. 1,
21, ‘accuratius scripsit’). The book contained models of
good style: Gell. ix. 16, 1, ‘refert plerasque sententias
quas in declamandis controversiis lepide arguteque dictas
putat.’

5.
Dubius Sermo
, in eight Books, published
A.D.
67,
towards the end of Nero’s reign, when purely technical
subjects alone could be treated without danger to an
author. Cf.
N.H.
praef. 28, ‘libellos quos de grammatica
edidi.’

6.
A fine Aufidii Bassi
, in thirty-one Books. At what
point Bassus’ history ended and Pliny’s began is not known:
but the latter certainly dealt with the closing years of Nero’s
reign (
N.H.
ii. 199, ‘anno Neronis principis supremo, sicut
in rebus eius exposuimus’), as well as with the times of
Vespasian and Titus (
N.H.
praef. 20, ‘Vos omnes, patrem
te fratremque diximus opere iusto, temporum nostrorum
historiam orsi a fine Aufidii Bassi’). The work was completed
in
A.D.
77, but not published till after the author’s
death. His nephew says he wrote with scrupulous care:

Ep.
v. 8, 5, ‘historias et quidem religiosissime scripsit.’
The book was used by Tacitus (
Ann.
xiii. 20; xv. 53;

Hist.
iii. 28).

7.
Naturae Historiae
, in thirty-seven Books, is Pliny’s
only extant work. As he speaks of Titus as ‘sexies consul,’
the date of its presentation to him was
A.D.
77. Book i.
consists of a dedicatory epistle to Titus and a table of
contents. The body of the work is arranged as follows:
Book ii., the universe and the elements; iii.-vi., geography
of Europe, Asia, and Africa; vii., anthropology and human
physiology; viii.-xi., zoology; xii.-xix., botany; xx.-xxvii.,
the use of vegetable substances in medicine; xxviii.-xxxii.,
the use of animal substances in medicine; xxxiii.-xxxvii.,
mineralogy applied to medicine and the fine arts.

This work, which was meant not for continuous perusal,
but for consultation as a book of reference, contained twenty
thousand facts; and its preparation involved the reading
of about two thousand volumes by one hundred authors
(see
N.H.
praef. 17). The extracts he had made from
these sources Pliny bequeathed to his nephew in one
hundred and sixty volumes. He makes a point of acknowledging
his obligations to other writers (praef. 21, ‘in his
voluminibus auctorum nomina praetexui, est enim benignum ... et
plenum ingenui pudoris fateri per quos profeceris’);
cf. the lists of authorities, Roman and foreign, prefixed to
the work. Such devotion to natural science was unusual
in men of Pliny’s class, and not generally appreciated; cf.
xxii. 15, ‘Plerisque ultro etiam irrisui sumus ista commentantes
atque frivoli operis arguimur.’ As a scientific
writer Pliny fails because he is not an original investigator,
and because he lacks the critical faculty. For his method
of working see Plin.
Ep.
iii. 5.

Politically, Pliny recognizes the necessity of the empire,
but his heroes are old Romans such as Cincinnatus and
Cato. His Roman and Italian feeling is intense: cf. xxxvii.
201, ‘In toto orbe ... pulcherrima omnium est in rebusque
merito principatum naturae obtinet Italia, rectrix parensque
mundi altera.’

His view of life is gloomy (
N.H.
ii. 25, ‘nec quidquam
miserius homine’), and through the
Naturae Historiae
there
runs a monotonous strain of condemnation of the immorality
of his day. He is uncertain as to divine providence, but
considers the belief in it salutary, and he accepts portents
(ii. 92). His tendency is, in the main, Stoic; he was probably
acquainted with Paetus Thrasea, who corresponded
with Pomponius.

VALERIUS FLACCUS.

His full name is given in the Vatican
MS.
as C. Valerius
Flaccus Setinus Balbus. It is doubtful (even if the last
two names really belong to the poet) whether
Setinus

means from Setia in Italy or from Setia in Spain. The
poet’s Latinity gives no evidence on the point. Quintilian
is the only Roman writer who refers to him; x. 1, 90,
‘Multum in Valerio Flacco nuper amisimus’; which shows
that he must have died about
A.D.
90. In the beginning
of the first Book of the
Argonautica
(written shortly after

A.D.
70), Valerius addresses Vespasian, referring to his
exploits in Britain, and to the capture of Jerusalem by
Titus; i. 7
sqq.
,

‘Tuque o, pelagi cui maior aperti

fama, Caledonius postquam tua carbasa vexit

oceanus Phrygios prius indignatus Iulos,

eripe me populis et habenti nubila terrae,

sancte pater, veterumque fave veneranda canenti

facta virum. Versam proles tua pandet Idumen

(namque potest), Solymo nigrantem pulvere fratrem

spargentemque faces et in omni turre furentem.’

i. 5
sqq.
probably shows that Valerius was a quindecimvir
sacris faciundis,

‘Phoebe, mone, si Cymaeae mihi conscia vatis

stat casta cortina domo, si laurea digna

fronte viret.’

Cf. the allusion in viii. 239
sqq.
to Cybele’s bath, which
was under the management of the xv.viri; and to the
rites of lustration, iii. 417
sqq.

There are several allusions to the eruption of Mt.
Vesuvius in
A.D.
79,
e.g.
iv. 507.

The
Argonautica
is in eight Books, the last being incomplete, and the story breaking off shortly before the death
of Medea’s brother, Absyrtus. Valerius probably meant to
write twelve Books, but it is not known how much farther
he actually proceeded in his work. There is evidence to
show that the last Books would have differed considerably
from the story as given by Apollonius Rhodius;
e.g.
the
visit to Phaeacia was probably omitted, as Jason was
married at Peuce (Book viii.).

Apollonius is followed very closely, many passages being
translated from him; thus iv. 236 = Apoll. ii. 38; vii.
404 = Apoll. in. 966. Valerius, however, amplifies where
Apollonius is brief, and vice versa. Thus Apoll. ii. 948

sqq.
is dismissed by Valerius v. 110
sqq.
in a few words.
The character painting of Valerius is superior to that of
the original, cf. the character of Jason and of Aeetes.
So for his artistic work; thus his portraiture of the gradual
progress of Medea’s love is superior to Apollonius’ description,
and to Virgil’s of Dido.

The obligations to Virgil are paramount.

(1) Verbal; as i. 55,

‘Tu, cui iam curaeque vigent animique viriles,’

from
Aen.
ix. 311,

‘Ante annos animumque gerens curamque virilem.’

Cf. ‘horrentem iaculis, nec credere quivi, heu quid agat,
libans carchesia, summa dies, miscere polum, rumpere
questus,’ in Book i.
[83]

(2) In matter. The description of Fame, ii. 116
sqq.
,
is from
Aen.
iv. The character of Styrus, the betrothed
of Medea, is modelled on that of Turnus.

After Virgil, Homer (esp. in Book vi.), Ovid, and
Seneca’s tragedies are chiefly imitated. Statius is full of
imitations of Valerius.

Valerius often tries to connect his subject with Rome.
[84]

Cf. ii. 304,

‘Iam nemus Egeriae, iam te ciet altus ab Alba

Iuppiter et soli non mitis Aricia regi’;

ii 573,

‘genus Aeneadum et Troiae melioris honores.’

SILIUS ITALICUS.

The full name of Silius is got from an inscription
(
C.I.L.
vi. 1984), and is Ti. Catius Silius Italicus. Our
chief information about his life is found in Pliny,
Epist.

iii. 7, where his recent death is mentioned. It was
probably written
A.D.
101, and as it states that Silius was
then 75 years old, the year of his birth was
A.D.
25.
His birthplace is unknown, but was not Italica in Spain,
otherwise Martial would have claimed him as a countryman.
Pliny tells us that Silius had risen by acting as
a
delator
under Nero, who made him consul
A.D.
68.
He had taken the side of Vitellius in the war of the
succession
A.D.
69
[85]
and had afterwards, as proconsul,
governed Asia with success (under Vespasian). After this
he possessed great social influence. Towards the end of
his life, he retired to Campania, and gave himself up to
study. The account of his learned retirement,
[86]
his
reverence for Virgil,
[87]
the consulship of his son,
[88]
the
death of his younger son,
[89]
and other details, are corroborated
by his contemporary Martial.

The passage of Pliny is as follows:

‘Modo nuntiatus est Silius Italicus in Neapolitano suo
inedia finisse vitam. Causa mortis valetudo. Erat illi
natus insanabilis clavus, cuius taedio ad mortem inrevocabili
constantia decucurrit, usque ad supremum diem
beatus et felix, nisi quod minorem ex liberis duobus
amisit, sed maiorem melioremque florentem atque etiam
consularem reliquit. Laeserat famam suam sub Nerone,
credebatur sponte accusasse: sed in Vitelli amicitia
sapienter se et comiter gesserat, ex proconsulatu Asiae
gloriam reportaverat, maculam veteris industriae laudabili
otio abluerat. Fuit inter principes civitatis sine potentia,
sine invidia: salutabatur, colebatur, multumque in lectulo
iacens cubiculo semper non ex fortuna frequenti doctissimis
sermonibus dies transigebat, cum a scribendo vacaret.
Scribebat carmina maiore cura quam ingenio, non numquam
iudicia hominum recitationibus experiebatur. Novissime
ita suadentibus annis ab urbe secessit, seque in
Campania tenuit, ac ne adventu quidem novi principis
inde commotus est ... Erat
ÏÎ¹Î»ÏÎºÎ±Î»Î¿Ï
usque ad emacitatis
reprehensionem. Plures isdem in locis villas possidebat
adamatisque novis priores neglegebat. Multum ubique
librorum, multum statuarum, multum imaginum, quas non
habebat modo verum etiam venerabatur, Vergilii ante
omnes, cuius natalem religiosius quam suum celebrabat,
Neapoli maxime, ubi monimentum eius adire ut templum
solebat. In hac tranquillitate annum quintum et septuagensimum excessit, delicato magis corpore quam infirmo;
utque novissimus a Nerone factus est consul, ita postremus
ex omnibus quos Nero consules fecerat decessit.’

Silius’ career as an orator is mentioned by Martial
vii. 63, 5-8,

‘Sacra cothurnati non attigit ante Maronis,

implevit magni quam Ciceronis opus.

Hunc miratur adhuc centum gravis hasta virorum,

hunc loquitur grato plurimus ore cliens.’

The
Punica
is an Epic in seventeen Books on the
Second Punic War, and treats of events down to the
battle of Zama,
B.C.
202. The historical treatment is
founded mainly on Livy, and in point of style Silius has
followed Homer and Virgil, imitations of whom are found
on every page. For Silius’ reverence for Virgil, see
above, and cf. viii. 593,

‘Mantua Musarum domus, atque ad sidera cantu

evecta Aonio, et Smyrnaeis aemula plectris.’

Silius also follows Homer and Virgil in their mythology,
bringing in supernatural motives in a way unsuitable to
a historical subject,
e.g.
in xv. 20, where Scipio has, like
Hercules, to choose between Voluptas and Virtus.

The example of Hannibal’s dream, iii. 163-182, will show
these different points. The story of the dream is got
from Livy xxi. 22, but, for
iuvenis divina specie
, Silius,
like Virg.
Aen.
iv. 222
sqq.
and 259
sqq.
substitutes Mercury.
Individual imitations in the passage are: l. 172, ‘Turpe
duci totam somno consumere noctem,’ from
Il.
ii. 24,

Î¿á½ ÏÏá½´ ÏÎ±Î½Î½ÏÏÎ¹Î¿Î½ Îµá½Î´ÎµÎ¹Î½ Î²Î¿Ï
Î»Î·ÏÏÏÎ¿Î½ á¼Î½Î´ÏÎ±
; l. 168, ‘umentem
noctis umbram’ is from
Aen.
iv. 7, ‘umentemque
Aurora polo dimoverat umbram’; l. 174, ‘iam maria
effusas cernes turbare carinas,’ from
Aen.
iv. 566, ‘iam
mare turbari trabibus ... videbis’; l. 182, ‘altae moenia
Romae’ is from
Aen.
i. 7; l. 181, ‘respexisse veto’ from

Ecl.
8, 102, ‘nec respexeris.’

The Epitome of the Iliad (in 1075 hexameters), which
passes under the name of
Homerus Latinus
, has been
attributed to Silius. It is a close adaptation from the
original.

STATIUS.

(1) LIFE.

P. Papinius Statius was born at Naples (
Silv.
i. 2, 260,
‘mea Parthenope’), probably about
A.D.
60, for he speaks
of himself as on the threshold of life at the time of his
father’s death, about
A.D.
80 (‘limine primo fatorum,’
Silv.

v. 3, 72). The apparent discrepancy in
Silv.
iv. 4, 69
(written
A.D.
94-5), ‘Nos facta aliena canendo vergimur
in senium,’ may be explained by observing that ‘senium’
is very often used for premature age induced by study
(cf. ‘insenuit,’ Hor.
Ep.
ii. 2, 82).

The father of Statius came of a distinguished but not
wealthy family:
Silv.
v. 3, 116,

‘Non tibi deformes obscuri sanguinis ortus

nec sine luce genus, quamquam fortuna parentum

artior expensis.’

He taught first at Naples (
ibid.
l. 146) and then at Rome
(l. 176); and died at the age of sixty-five (l. 252) soon after
the eruption of Vesuvius, which he had intended to
make the subject of a poem (l. 205). It was from his
learned father (‘genitor perdocte,’ l. 3) that Statius derived
his first impulse towards poetry, and to his training he
acknowledges deep obligations (ll. 209-214).

Statius won two prizes for poetry, at the
Augustalia
in
Naples and at Alba; but was unsuccessful at the Capitoline competition, probably in
A.D.
94 (
ibid.
225-232). In
that year he seems to have removed from Rome to
Naples, and spent there the remainder of his days:

Silv.
iii. 5, 12,

‘Anne quod Euboicos fessus remeare penates

auguror et patria senium componere terra?’

The date of his death is unknown. The latest event
mentioned in his poems is the seventeenth consulship
of Domitian,
A.D.
95 (
Silv.
iv. 1).

Statius was married to a widow named Claudia (
Silv.

iii. 5, 51
sqq.
), but had no children (v. 5, 79).

He enjoyed the favour of Domitian (‘indulgentissimus
imperator,’
Silv.
i. praef.) who granted him a supply of
water for his country house at Alba, and occasionally
invited him to his table:
Silv.
iii. 1, 61,

‘Ast ego, Dardaniae quamvis sub collibus Albae

rus proprium magnique ducis mihi munere currens

unda domi curas mulcere aestusque levare

sufficerent.’

Silv.
iv. praef., ‘Sacratissimis eius epulis honoratus.’

He more than once promises to write an epic on
Domitian’s career (e.g.
Theb.
i. 32). The emperor’s freedman
Earinus (
Silv.
iii. 4) was one of Statius’ patrons.

His regard for the poet Lucan produced
Silv.
ii. 7,
which is a poem on Lucan’s birthday, addressed to his
widow (see
p. 267
). But his chief admiration was
reserved for the memory of Virgil: Naples and Alba
were endeared to him by their associations with the
‘great master’ and the story of Aeneas:
Silv.
iv. 4, 53,

‘Tenues ignavo pollice chordas

pulso, Maroneique sedens in margine templi

sumo animum et magni tumulis adcanto magistri.’

For Alba cf.
Silv.
v. 3, 37. The
Thebais
must recognize its
inferiority to the
Aeneid
:
Theb.
xii. 816,

‘Vive, precor; nec tu divinam Aeneida tempta,

sed longe sequere et vestigia semper adora.’

(2) WORKS.

1. The
Thebais
, an epic poem in twelve Books, occupied
Statius for twelve years: xii. 811,

‘O mihi bis senos multum vigilata per annos

Thebai.’

Cf.
Silv.
iv. 7, 26,

‘Thebais multa cruciata lima.’

The twelve years were probably 79-91 or 80-92
A.D.

Silv.
i. praef. (written 91 or 92), ‘Adhuc pro Thebaide mea,
quamvis me reliquerit, timeo.’ The publication apparently
did not take place till
A.D.
95 (cf.
Silv.
iv. 4, 87
sqq.

written in that year).

The subject of the poem is the strife between the
brothers Eteocles and Polynices, and the subsequent
history of Thebes to the death of Creon. The dedication
is to Domitian. For the popularity of the
Thebais
cf.
Juv.
Sat.
7, 82,

‘Curritur ad vocem iucundam et carmen amicae

Thebaidos, laetam cum fecit Statius urbem

promisitque diem. Tanta dulcedine captos

afficit ille animos tantaque libidine volgi

auditur; sed, cum fregit subsellia versu,

esurit, intactam Paridi nisi vendit Agaven.’

2. The
Achilleis
, also dedicated to Domitian, is an incomplete
epic, consisting of one Book and part of a
second. It was later than the Thebaid, for Statius was
working at it in
A.D.
95:
Silv.
iv. 4, 93,

‘Nunc vacuos crines alio subit infula nexu:

Troia quidem magnusque mihi temptatur Achilles.’

The poem was intended to cover the whole career of
Achilles, including his retreat in Scyros before the Trojan
War, and his exploits after the death of Hector, which
did not enter into the plan of the
Iliad
: cf. l. 3,

‘Quamquam acta viri multum inclita cantu

Maeonio, sed plura vacant: nos ire per omnem

(sic amor est) heroa velis.’

3. The
Silvae
, which represent the poet in his less
serious mood, are occasional poems on miscellaneous
subjects, published in five separate Books. Cf. 1, praef.
‘Diu multumque dubitavi ... an hos libellos, ... cum
singuli de sinu meo prodierint, congregates ipse dimitterem.’
Many of them were thrown off in haste at the command
of the Emperor or the request of friends: cf. such expressions
as ‘stili facilitas’ (ii. praef.), ‘libellorum temeritas,’
‘hanc audaciam stili nostri’ (iii. praef.). Of the
poems in Book i. he says, ‘nullum ex illis biduo longius
tractum, quaedam et in singulis diebus effusa’ (i. praef.).
Each of the Books is introduced by a prose preface.

None of the
Silvae
appeared before
A.D.
92; for
Rutilius Gallicus, for whom i. 4 was written, died in
that year, and the poem was not published till after his
death (i. praef.). Book v. was probably a posthumous
work: there is no proper preface, and the third and fifth
poems are incomplete.

Hexameter verse is employed for all the
Silvae
except
six. Of these, four are in hendecasyllabics, one in the
Alcaic and one in the Sapphic stanza.

4. The only other poem of which there is distinct
evidence is the pantomime
Agave
, written not later than

A.D.
84, the year in which the player Paris was put to
death (Juv.
Sat.
7, 86, quoted above).

MARTIAL.
[90]

(1) LIFE.

M. Valerius Martialis (Coquus is added in the old
glossaries) was born at Bilbilis in Hispania Tarraconensis
on 1st March in one of the years
A.D.
38-41. His tenth
Book, written
A.D.
95-8, contains a poem (x. 24) written
on his fifty-seventh birthday. Cf. ll. 4-5,

‘quinquagesima liba septimamque

vestris addimus hanc focis acerram’;

ix. 52, 3,

‘ut nostras amo Martias Kalendas’;

x. 103, 1,

‘Municipes, Augusta mihi quos Bilbilis acri

monte creat, rapidis quem Salo cingit aquis.’

His parents’ names are given, v. 34, 1, ‘Fronto pater,
genetrix Flaccilla.’ Martial went through the usual education
at Bilbilis or at a neighbouring town; ix. 73, 7,

‘At me litterulas stulti docuere parentes:

quid cum grammaticis rhetoribusque mihi?’

Martial went to Rome
A.D.
64, for in
A.D.
98, when he
left Rome, he gives the length of his stay as thirty-four
years; x. 103, 7,

‘Quattuor accessit tricesima messibus aestas,

ut sine me Cereri rustica liba datis,

moenia dum colimus dominae pulcherrima Romae.’

At Rome Martial became the client of the house of the
Senecas, and was on intimate terms with L. Calpurnius
Piso, Memmius Gemellus, and Vibius Crispus; xii. 36, 8,

‘Pisones Senecasque Memmiosque

et Crispos mihi redde sed priores.’

The failure of Piso’s conspiracy in
A.D.
65 and the consequent
downfall of the Senecas must have affected Martial’s
position. In
A.D.
96 Martial addresses as his patroness
Argentaria Polla, Lucan’s widow, the only surviving member
of the family; x. 64, 1,

‘Contigeris regina meos si Polla libellos,’ etc.

From her he may have got the small vineyard near Nomentum
which he possessed by
A.D.
84 (xiii. 42 and 119).

Little is known of Martial’s life before the reign of
Domitian. He may have practised at the bar; cf. ii. 30, 5,

‘Is mihi “dives eris, si causas egeris” inquit’;

and Quintilian appears to have advised this course
(ii. 90). He probably lived as a client of great houses
to which he was recommended by his early-developed
poetical talents. Cf. i. 113, 1,

‘Quaecumque lusi iuvenis et puer quondam.’

In
A.D.
80 he commemorated the opening by Titus of the
Flavian Amphitheatre by a collection of poems sent to the
emperor. Cf.
Spectac.
32,

‘Da veniam subitis: non displicuisse meretur,

festinat, Caesar, qui placuisse tibi.’

Martial received the ‘ius trium liberorum’ from two of the
emperors. This probably means that Titus bestowed it
and Domitian ratified it. Cf. ix. 97, 5,

‘tribuit quod Caesar uterque

ius mihi natorum.’

Martial became a titular tribune, and consequently an

eques
, an honour probably given him by Titus; iii. 95, 9

‘vidit me Roma tribunum’;

v. 13, 1,

‘Sum, fateor, semperque fui, Callistrate, pauper,

sed non obscurus nec male notus eques.’

Martial is unsparing in his flattery of Domitian and his
freedmen. Cf. ix. 79, iv. 45, of Parthenius, the emperor’s
chamberlain; vii. 99, viii. 48, of Crispinus, the emperor’s
favourite. In
A.D.
86 we find his poems eagerly read by
the emperor. Cf. iv. 27,

‘Saepe meos laudare soles, Auguste, libellos.’

He obtained citizen rights for several applicants; cf. ix.
95. 11,

‘Quot mihi Caesareo facti sunt munere cives’;

and was occasionally invited to the emperor’s table; cf. ix.
91. Domitian, however, refused to assist him pecuniarily
(vi. 10). A description of Martial’s life as a client of great
houses is found,
e.g.
, in v. 20. Among the friends of high
rank whom Martial made after
A.D.
86 were the poet Silius
Italicus (iv. 14), the future emperor Nerva (v. 28), the
author S. Iulius Frontinus (x. 58), the younger Pliny (x. 19).
Martial also mentions Quintilian (ii. 90) and other literary
men from Spain, and Juvenal (vii. 24, etc.). Statius he
never mentions, and was probably at enmity with him;
cf. his sneers at mythological epics (x. 4, etc.), which hint
indirectly at the
Thebais
. Martial also attacks his critics
(i. 3; xi. 20, etc.), plagiarists (
e.g.
xi. 94), and those who
wrote scurrilous verses in his name (
e.g.
x. 3).

Martial received rewards in return for his poetry, and
often begs for gifts, and complains of his poverty and the
unproductiveness of his estate at Nomentum (xii. 57); v. 36,

‘Laudatus nostro quidam, Faustina, libello

dissimulat, quasi nil debeat: imposuit’;

vii. 16,

‘Aera domi non sunt, superest hoc, Regule, solum,

ut tua vendamus munera: numquid emis?’

From 86 to 90
A.D.
Martial lived in lodgings on the Quirinal,
three stairs up; i. 117, 6,

‘Longum est, si velit ad Pirum venire,
et scalis habito tribus, sed altis.’

Later he had a house of his own (ix. 18, 2, etc.), and
mentions his slaves (i. 101; v. 34, etc.). That he was
still poor in
A.D.
98 is evident from Pliny,
Ep.
iii. 21, 2,
‘Prosecutus eram viatico secedentem: dederam hoc
amicitiae, dederam etiam versiculis quos de me composuit.’

Martial was evidently never married (ii. 92). In
A.D.
98
he left Rome and went to Spain, where he had liberal
friends, as Terentius Priscus (xii. 4), and Marcella (xii. 21),
who gave him an estate, described in xii. 18. From xii.
praef. we see his longing for Rome:

‘In hac provinciali solitudine ... bibliothecas, theatra,
convictus ... desideramus quasi destituti. Accedit his municipalium
robigo dentium et iudici loco livor,’ etc.

Martial died, at latest, about
A.D.
104, being from 63
to 66 years old.

Pliny
Ep.
iii. 21 (written not after
A.D.
104), ‘Audio
Valerium Martialem decessisse et moleste fero.’

Martial does not disguise the bad points of his character.
Cf. his flattery of Domitian, and his continual begging
(
passim
), his cynical reasons for giving panegyrics (v. 36,
quoted above); the number of indecent poems he wrote,
for which he apologizes (
e.g.
i. praef.). Among his good
points are his ‘candor,’ mentioned by Pliny,
Ep.
iii. 21;
his love of unadorned nature,
e.g.
iii. 58; his love for
his friends,
e.g.
i. 15.

(2) WORKS.

Publication of the Poems.
â
Liber Spectaculorum
was published
A.D.
80, on the opening of Titus’ Amphitheatre.
The
Xenia
and
Apophoreta
were two collections of inscriptions
for presents at the
Saturnalia
in December 84 or
85
A.D.
The numbering of these as Books xiii. and xiv.
has no ancient authority. Martial furnished the other Books
with numbers (cf. ii. 92, 1, ‘primus liber’). Books i., ii.,
appeared together
A.D.
86. Then came Books iii.-xi. at
intervals of about a year to December, 96
A.D.
Martial
prepared a selection from Books x. and xi. for Nerva’s
use (no longer extant). This was presented along with
xii. 5,

‘Longior undecimi nobis decimique libelli

artatus labor est, et breve rasit opus.

Plura legant vacui, quibus otia tuta dedisti;

haec lege tu Caesar; forsan et illa leges.’

Book xii. appeared at the beginning of
A.D.
102. and shortly
afterwards in an enlarged edition. An edition of all the
Books probably did not appear till after Martial’s death.

For Martial’s immediate popularity, cf. vi. 61,

‘Laudat, amat, cantat nostros mea Roma libellos,

meque sinus omnis, me manus omnis habet’;

xi. 3, 3,

‘Sed meus in Geticis ad Martia signa pruinis

a rigido teritur centurione liber,

dicitur et nostros cantare Britannia versus.’

Pliny
Ep.
iii. 21 (written just after Martial’s death),
‘Erat homo ingeniosus acutus acer, et qui plurimum in
scribendo et salis haberet et fellis nec candoris minus.’

Martial’s Models.
—His manner is very original, but
some of his motives are taken from Greek epigrammatists,
especially from Lucillius, who flourished under Nero.
Thus iv. 53 = Lucill. 30; v. 53 = L. 93; xii. 23 = L. 34.
Many of his pieces are doubtless improvisations, and consequently
contain careless expressions and errors as to
facts. Thus, vii. 61, 2,

‘Inque suo nullum limine limen erat’;

x. 2, 1,

‘Festinata prior decimi mihi cura libelli

elapsum manibus nunc revocavit opus’;

x. 93, 5,

‘Ut rosa delectat, metitur quae pollice primo’

(= the rose which has not yet been plucked).

In iv. 55, 3, Arpi is given as Cicero’s birthplace; in v. 30,
2, etc., Calabria instead of Apulia is given as Horace’s
native district. Catullus is Martial’s chief model for
hendecasyllabics and choliambics. He mentions no other
poet so often. Cf. x. 103, 5,

‘Nec sua plus debet tenui Verona Catullo

meque velit dici non minus illa suum.’

Ovid, of whom he has more than two hundred
reminiscences, is Martial’s chief pattern for elegiacs. After
these Martial’s chief model is Virgil, chiefly the
Priapea
;
then Horace to a less extent; Propertius; and Tibullus.
Domitius Marsus, Gaetulicus, Calvus, etc., are mentioned
frequently, and doubtless imitated.

For Martial’s conception of himself as a painter of
manners, cf. viii. 3, 19 (ad Musam),

‘At tu Romano lepidos sale tinge libellos:

adgnoscat mores vita legatque suos.

Angusta cantare licet videaris avena,

dum tua multorum vincat avena tubas.’

x. 4, 7,

‘Quid te vana iuvant miserae ludibria chartae?

hoc lege, quod possit dicere vita “Meum est.”

Non hic Centauros, non Gorgonas, Harpyiasque

invenies: hominem pagina nostra sapit.’

Martial satirizes people under manufactured or arbitrarily
chosen names.

Cf. i. praef., ‘Spero me secutum in libellis meis tale
temperamentum, ut de illis queri non possit, quisquis de
se bene senserit, cum salva infimarum quoque personarum
reverentia ludant.’

Some are tell-tale names, as Vetustilla, ‘an old woman,’
iii. 93; Dento, ‘a gourmand,’ v. 45; Eulogus, ‘a herald,’
vi. 8; but the same names,
e.g.
Zoilus, are often used to
denote different types.

The chief forms of verse used are the elegiac distich
(most frequent), scazons, and hendecasyllabics. In vi. 65
he apologizes for using the pure hexameter, which is
found only four times. Other metres are extremely rare.

QUINTILIAN.

(1) LIFE.

M. Fabius Quintilianus was born at Calagurris in Spain.
Auson.
prof.
i. 7, ‘Adserat usque licet Fabium Calagurris
alumnum.’ Cf. Jerome yr. Abr. 2104 (quoted below).

Quintilian came at an early age to Rome, where his
father was a rhetorician. Cf. his reminiscences:

x. 1, 86, ‘Utar verbis isdem quae ex Afro Domitio (died

A.D.
59) iuvenis excepi.’

v. 7, 7, ‘a Domitio Afro quem adulescentulus senem
colui.’

vi. 1, 14, ‘Nobis adulescentibus accusator Cossutiani
Capitonis’ (
A.D.
57), etc.

From the above quotations, Quintilian must have been
born somewhere between
A.D.
35 and 40.
A.D.
35 is usually
given as an approximation. For Quintilian’s father cf.
ix. 3, 73, ‘Et cur me prohibeat pudor uti domestico
exemplo? Pater meus contra eum qui,’ etc. He is possibly
the person mentioned by Seneca,
Contr.
x. praef. 2,
‘quo modo ... Quintilianus senex declamaverit.’

For Quintilian’s teachers of rhetoric, cf. Pliny,
Ep.
ii.
14, 10, ‘Narrabat ille [Quintilianus], Adsectabar Domitium
Afrum.’ Others were Iulius Africanus (Quint. x. 1, 118),
Servilius Nonianus (x. 1, 102), Galerius Trachalus (x. 1,
119), Iulius Secundus (x. 1, 120), Vibius Crispus (xii. 10,
11), Remmius Palaemon (Schol. ad Iuv. 6, 452). After
his education Quintilian returned to Calagurris, but was
brought back to Rome by Galba in
A.D.
68.

Jerome yr. Abr. 2084 =
A.D.
68, ‘M. Fabius Quintilianus
Romam a Galba perducitur.’

Quintilian engaged as a pleader at Rome, and makes
some references to his cases. Some of his speeches were
published without his consent.

vii. 2, 24, ‘In causa Naevi Arpiniani ... cuius actionem
et quidem solam in hoc tempus emiseram, quod ipsum
me fecisse ductum iuvenili cupiditate gloriae fateor. Nam
ceterae, quae sub nomine meo feruntur, neglegentia excipientium
in quaestum notariorum corruptae minimam
partem mei habent.’

iv. 1, 19, ‘Ego pro regina Berenice apud ipsam eam
causam dixi.’

Cf. also vii. 2, 5; ix. 2, 73-4.

Quintilian was the first person who received an imperial
grant as teacher of oratory.

Jerome yr. Abr. 2104 =
A.D.
88, ‘Quintilianus ex Hispania
Calagurritanus primus Romae publicam scholam et salarium
e fisco accepit et claruit.’ The date given by Jerome is
much too late, as it is Quintilian that is alluded to by
Sueton.
Vesp.
18, ‘Primus e fisco Latinis Graecisque rhetoribus
annua centena constituit.’ The appointment must
therefore have been made by
A.D.
79. The professorship
is referred to by Mart. ii. 90, 1,

‘Quintiliane, vagae moderator summe iuventae,

gloria Romanae, Quintiliane, togae.’

Cf. Pliny,
Ep.
ii. 14, 10, ‘Ita certe ex Quintiliano, praeceptore
meo, audisse memini.’ Quintilian’s career as a
teacher lasted for twenty years.

i. prooem. 1, ‘Post impetratam studiis meis quietem,
quae per viginti annos erudiendis iuvenibus impenderam.’

Teuffel thinks that the
Institutio
was written
A.D.
89-91,
in which case Quintilian’s career as professor was from

A.D.
68 to 88; Peterson
[91]
thinks that Quintilian dated his
educational work as from
A.D.
70 to 90, and that the

Institutio
was begun
A.D.
92.

Quintilian grew rich by the practice of his profession,
from which he ultimately retired. Iuv. 7, 186,

‘Hos inter sumptus sestertia Quintiliano,

ut multum, duo sufficient; res nulla minoris

constabit patri, quam filius. “Unde igitur tot

Quintilianus habet saltus?”’

Quint. ii. 12, 12, ‘quando et praecipiendi munus iam
pridem deprecati sumus et in foro quoque dicendi, quia
honestissimum finem putamus, desinere dum desideraremur.’

After his retirement Quintilian was appointed tutor of
Domitian’s grandnephews, sons of his niece Flavia Domitilla
and his cousin Flavius Clemens.

Quint. iv. prooem. 2, ‘Cum mihi Domitianus Augustus
sororis suae nepotum delegaverit curam.’

Through the influence of Clemens, he obtained the
consulship.

Auson.
grat. act.
p. 23 (Schenkl), ‘Quintilianus consularia
per Clementem ornamenta sortitus honestamenta potius
videtur quam insignia potestatis habuisse.’

Cf. Iuv. 7, 197,

‘Si Fortuna volet, fies de rhetore consul;

si volet haec eadem, fies de consule rhetor.’

His gratitude led him into fulsome flattery of Domitian.

x. 1, 91, ‘Germanicum Augustum ab institutis studiis
deflexit cura terrarum, parumque dis visum est esse eum
maximum poetarum’ (cf. iv. prooem. 3-5).

Quintilian married late in life. His wife died at the
age of eighteen, his younger son soon afterwards at the
age of five, the elder one subsequently at the age of nine.

vi. prooem. Â§ 2, ‘Illum, de quo summa conceperam et
in quo spem unicam senectutis reponebam, repetito volnere
orbitatis amisi’; Â§ 9, ‘Non flosculos, sicut prior, sed iam
decimum aetatis ingressus annum, certos ac deformatos
fructus ostenderat’; Â§ 4, ‘erepta prius mihi matre eorumdem,
quae nondum expleto aetatis undevicesimo anno
duos enixa filios ...’; Â§ 5, ‘cum omni virtute, quae in
feminas cadit, functa insanabilem adtulit marito dolorem,
tum aetate tam puellari, praesertim meae comparata, potest
et ipsa numerari inter volnera orbitatis’; Â§ 6, ‘Mihi filius
minor quintum egressus annum prior alterum ex duobus
eruit lumen.’

The date of Quintilian’s death is unknown. If he outlived
Domitian it was not for long, as Pliny in the letters
quoted above (the earlier written about
A.D.
100) does
not speak of Quintilian as alive.

(2) WORKS.

Earlier works.
—Quintilian refers to a work
de causis
corruptae eloquentiae
, and to an
ars rhetorica
in two Books.
For speeches of his taken down and published, see vii. 2,
24, quoted
p. 303
.

vi. prooem. 3, ‘eum librum, quem de causis corruptae
eloquentiae emisi.’

i. prooem. 7, ‘Duo iam sub nomine meo libri ferebantur
artis rhetoricae neque editi a me neque in hoc comparati.
Namque alterum, sermone per biduum habito, pueri, quibus
id praestabatur, exceperant; alterum pluribus sane diebus,
quantum notando consequi potuerant, interceptum, boni
iuvenes sed nimium amantes mei, temerario editionis honore
volgaverant.’

The
Institutio Oratoria
.—For the date of publication
see
p. 304
. The circumstances of publication are given
by Quintilian in the preface addressed to his bookseller
Trypho.

‘Efflagitasti cottidiano convicio, ut libros, quos ad Marcellum
meum de Institutione oratoria scripseram, iam
emittere inciperem. Nam ipse eos nondum opinabar satis
maturuisse, quibus componendis, ut scis, paulo plus quam
biennium tot alioqui negotiis districtus impendi ... Sed
si tanto opere efflagitantur quam tu affirmas, permittamus
vela ventis et oram solventibus bene precemur.’

The work is dedicated to Vitorius Marcellus (to whom
Statius’
Silvae
, Book iv., is addressed), and was originally
written in view of the education of his son Geta.

i. prooem. 6, ‘Quod opus, Marcelle Vitori, tibi dicamus
... quod erudiendo Getae tuo ... non inutiles fore libri
videbantur.’

Book iv. prooem. was written when Quintilian had been
appointed tutor to the young princes, who are mentioned
along with Geta and Quintilian’s elder son; Book vi.
prooem. was written not long afterwards, and refers to
his bereavements; in Book xii. prooem. no names are
mentioned.

The work deals with the whole education of the future
orator.

i. prooem. 5, ‘Nec aliter, quam si mihi tradatur educandus
orator, studia eius formare ab infantia incipiam.’

Quintilian himself gives a sketch of the contents:

i. prooem. 21-2, ‘Liber primus ea quae sunt ante
officium rhetoris continebit [including grammar and philology].
Secundo prima apud rhetorem elementa et quae de
ipsa rhetorices substantia quaeruntur tractabimus. Quinque
deinceps (iii.-vii.) inventioni, nam huic et dispositio subiungitur,
quattuor (viii.-xi.) elocutioni, in cuius partem
memoria ac pronuntiatio veniunt, dabuntur. Unus (xii.)
accedet, in quo nobis orator ipse informandus est, ut qui
mores eius, quae in suscipiendis, discendis, agendis causis
ratio, quod eloquentiae genus, quis agendi debeat esse
finis, quae post finem studia ... disseramus.’

The ordinary handbooks of rhetoric are attacked.

i. prooem. 24-5, ‘Nam plerumque nudae illae artes nimia
subtilitatis affectatione frangunt atque concidunt quidquid
est in oratione generosius, et omnem sucum ingeni bibunt
et ossa detegunt, quae ut esse et adstringi nervis suis
debent, sic corpore operienda sunt. Ideoque nos non
particulam illam, sicut plerique, sed quidquid utile ad
instituendum oratorem putabamus, in hos duodecim libros
contulimus breviter omnia demonstraturi.’

Quintilian uses his own experience and the best views
of different authorities.

vi. 2, 25, ‘Quod si tradita mihi sequi praecepta sufficeret,
satisfeceram huic parti, nihil eorum, quae legi vel didici,
quod modo probabile fuit, omittendo; sed eruere in animo
est, quae latent, et penitus ipsa huius loci aperire penetralia,
quae quidem non aliquo tradente sed experimento meo ac
natura ipsa duce accepi.’

Quintilian insists that the orator must be a good man
(cf. the importance he attaches to early education, i. 1, etc.).

xii. 1, 1, ‘Sit ergo nobis orator, quem constituimus, is
qui a M. Catone finitur, vir bonus dicendi peritus; verum,
id quod et ille posuit prius, et ipsa natura potius ac maius
est, utique vir bonus.’

Cf. i. prooem. 9-10; ii. 2 (the whole chapter); ii. 15, 1.

Quintilian’s exposition is founded mainly on Cicero, from
whom he seldom differs. Cf. vii. 3, 8, ‘Quamquam dissentire
vix audeo a Cicerone.’

Quintilian’s illustrations are mainly drawn from classical
writers. Upwards of four hundred and fifty passages of
Cicero and about one hundred and forty of Virgil are
referred to. Quintilian not only attacks the modern style,
but warns his pupils against the early writers.

ii. 5, 21-2, ‘Duo autem genera maxime cavenda pueris
puto: unum, ne quis eos antiquitatis nimius admirator in
Graccorum Catonisque et aliorum similium lectione durescere
velit ... Alterum, quod huic diversum est, ne
recentis huius lasciviae flosculis capti voluptate prava deleniantur,
ut praedulce illud genus et puerilibus ingeniis hoc
gratius, quo propius est, adament.’

For Quintilian’s high appreciation of Cicero see x. 1,
105-112; and for his antagonism to Seneca, x. 1, 125-131,
and to philosophers in general, i. prooem. 10.

For Quintilian’s authorities see iii. 1, ‘Prooemium de
scriptoribus artis rhetoricae.’ They include Dionysius of
Halicarnassus; Caecilius; Chrysippus (for education; cf. i.
1, 16, etc.); Cicero;
Auctor ad Herenn.
; Celsus, cf. iii. 1, 21,
etc.; Rutilius, cf. ix. 3, 89; Remmius Palaemon.

Literary criticism is treated of in Book X. as regards the
Greek and Latin authors useful to the orator. The principal
authority used was the
ÏÎµÏá½¶ Î¼Î¹Î¼Î®ÏÎµÏÏ
of Dionysius
Halicarnassius. Much of Quintilian’s criticism is traditional,
and the lists of great writers came ultimately from the
critics of Alexandria. Roman literary critics referred to
were Cicero (
e.g.
on the Attic orators, x. 1, 76-80) and
Horace (x. 1, 24; 56, etc.).

Spurious works.
—These include two collections of

declamationes
.

1. Nineteen long pieces, ascribed to Quintilian by Jerome
and others, but much later than Quintilian’s time.

2. One hundred and forty-five shorter pieces out of an
original collection of three hundred and eighty-eight, the
first half being lost. Some suppose they are the ‘libri
artis rhetoricae’ (i. prooem. 7, quoted above), but this is
not likely.

FRONTINUS.

(1) LIFE.

Iulius Frontinus (as he is called by Tacitus: inscriptions
and some
MSS.
give the
praenomen
Sextus) was born at
latest
A.D.
41, for he was
praetor urbanus

A.D.
70.

Tac.
Hist.
iv. 39, ‘in senatu quem Iulius Frontinus
praetor urbanus vocaverat ... Mox eiurante Frontino
Caesar Domitianus praeturam cepit.’

He served in Gaul during the revolt of Civilis, and
received the submission of the Lingones (Front.
Strat.
iv.
3, 14
[92]
). Under Vespasian he held the consulship, and
preceded Agricola in the command in Britain, where he
conquered the Silures, probably
A.D.
76-78.

Tac.
Agr.
17, ‘Et Cerealis quidem alterius successoris
curam famamque obruisset: sustinuit molem Iulius Frontinus,
vir magnus, quantum licebat, validamque et pugnacem
Silurum gentem armis subegit, super virtutem hostium
locorum quoque difficultates eluctatus.’

His knowledge of the tactics of Domitian (
Strat.
i. 1, 8;
i. 3, 10; ii. 3, 23; ii. 11, 7) makes it probable that he took
part in the war with the Chatti,
A.D.
83. In 97 he became

curator aquarum
(
Aq.
102), and at the beginning of the
following year was consul for the second time (
C.I.L.
iii.,
p. 862); cf. Martial x. 48, 20, ‘bis Frontino consule.’ In
100 he was once more consul (
C.I.L.
viii. 7066). He also
held the office of augur, in which,
A.D.
103 or 104, he
was succeeded by the younger Pliny; Plin.
Ep.
iv. 8,
‘gratularis mihi quod acceperim auguratum ... Successi
Iulio Frontino, principi viro.’ His death then may be
placed in
A.D.
103.

Frontinus was a friend of Martial, who addresses to him

Epig.
x. 58.

We get a glimpse of his character from Pliny’s words,

Ep.
ix. 19, 6, ‘Vetuit exstrui monumentum: sed quibus
verbis? “Impensa monumenti supervacua est: memoria
nostri durabit si vita meruimus.”’

(2) WORKS.

During the reign of Domitian (
A.D.
81-96) Frontinus
composed two works. One of these, of which only fragments
survive, dealt with the art of land-surveying and the
laws relating to land. The other, written after
A.D.
84,
when Domitian received the title of Germanicus (
Strat.

ii. II, 7, ‘eo bello quo victis hostibus cognomen Germanici
meruit’), is a manual of strategy, in three Books, entitled

Strategemata
. It is a sequel to a previous work (now lost)
on the theory of the art of war, and illustrates its rules
by historical examples derived chiefly from Sallust, Caesar,
and Livy. The purpose of the book did not require the
citation of authorities, and the mention of Livy in ii. 5,
31 and 34, is probably spurious. Frontinus gives either a
paraphrase retaining some of the expressions of the original
(cf.
Strat.
i. 5, 16, with Liv. xxxv. 11, 2-13), or a bald
summary (cf.
Strat.
ii. 5, 1, with Liv. i. 14, 6-11). See
G. Gundermann,
Jahrb. f. class. Philol.
, suppl. xvi., p. 315

sqq.
(1888). Some later hand has added a fourth Book,
which not only presents marked differences in style and
tone from the original three, but deals with an entirely
different subject—the maintenance of discipline, and other
duties of a commander.

Under Nerva and Trajan (
A.D.
97-98) Frontinus wrote
his treatise on the Roman water-supply,
De Aquis Urbis
Romae
. Having been appointed
curator aquarum
, he considered
it his first duty to acquaint himself with the details
of his department, and published the result of his inquiries
in the hope that they might be useful to his successors
(cf. the preface). The book was begun under Nerva (praef.
‘cum ... sit nunc mihi ab Nerva Augusto ... aquarum
iniunctum officium’), but Nerva had been succeeded by
Trajan before it was completed (118, ‘divus Nerva’; 93,
‘Traianum Augustum’).

JUVENAL.

The sources for Juvenal’s life are (1) his works; (2)
an inscription found at Aquinum; (3) thirteen extant

vitae
; (4) information of the scholiasts; (5) references
in Martial and other writers.

The inscription at Aquinum has been much debated;
but it is safe to follow the opinion of Mommsen, whose
experience in identifying people mentioned in inscriptions
with historical characters depends upon a width of knowledge
that no other person possesses. The
vitae
are all
early mediaeval works, probably founded on a brief account
of the poet’s life composed by some unknown ancient
writer, and existing at the early Renaissance. The extant

vitae
contain a very few facts which appear to be derived
from this source, together with a number of inferences
gathered, often incorrectly, from Juvenal’s works. The
most important statement is that regarding Juvenal’s
birth, which is contained in the
vita
in the Codex Barberinus,
8, 18, discovered by J. DÃ¼rr. The date is given
in such precise and accurate terms, and is in itself so
probable as solving so many of the questions connected
with the poet’s works, that to invent it requires an amount
of knowledge with which we cannot credit the writer of
this otherwise very poor account. The statements of the

vitae
must be carefully weighed, and accepted only when
rendered probable by other considerations.
[93]

Juvenal’s name is given in some of the
MSS.
as Decimus
Iunius Iuvenalis. He was born
A.D.
55.

Codex Barberinus
, ‘Iunius Iuvenalis Aquinas Iunio
Iuvenale patre, matre vero Septumuleia ex Aquinati municipio
Claudio Nerone et L. Antistio consulibus natus est.
Sororem habuit Septumuleiam, quae Fuscino nupsit.’

The statement about his sister and mother is very
doubtful; that about Fuscinus is a bad inference from
the fact that
Sat.
14 (on the education of children) is
addressed to him. The name
Septumuleia
may be invented
from 14, 105,
septima lux
. Juvenal’s sister must have
been called Iunia after her father; the naming of a girl
after her mother was a mediaeval idea.

Juvenal was born at Aquinum, a town of the Volscians.
Twelve of the
vitae
agree in this, and they are confirmed
by the poet’s own words supposed to be addressed to
him by his friend Umbricius: 3, 318-21,

‘Quotiens te

Roma tuo refici properantem reddet Aquino,

me quoque ad Helvinam Cererem vestramque Dianam

converte a Cumis.’

Cf. 6, 57,

‘agello cedo paterno.’

This is corroborated by the inscription found at Aquinum
(
C.I.L.
x. 5382), which gives us other information about
the poet:

This inscription appears to have stood near the temple
of Ceres Helvina or Elvina, dedicated by a member of
the gens Elvia, references to which are found on inscriptions
of the district.

The
vitae
say that Juvenal was the son of a freedman.
[94]

Cf.
Vitae
i.
a
, i.
b
, ii.
c
(DÃ¼rr): ‘libertini locupletis incertum
filius an alumnus.’
Vita
v. (DÃ¼rr), ‘ordinis ut fertur
libertinorum.’ This story is due to a misapprehension of
some of Juvenal’s references. 1, 99-102,

‘Iubet a praecone vocari

ipsos Troiugenas (nam vexant limen et ipsi

nobiscum): “da praetori, da deinde tribuno.”

Sed libertinus prior est.’

Libertinus
here is not to be taken to mean that the
entire set are freedmen.

As to 4, 98,

‘unde fit ut malim fraterculus esse gigantis,’

it gives no evidence whatever of Juvenal’s position. If it
meant anything, it would rather imply that Juvenal was
the son of a poor Italian and not of a foreign slave. So
for 11, 145-6. His family was respectable, his means
were fair, and he could afford to look down on upstarts
in virtue both of his birth and of his property, although
it is clear from his own works that he had in Rome the
position of a rather humble dependent, who would be
exposed to insult at the tables of the rich and powerful.
Cf. 3, 318; 6, 57 (above); 12, 89, ‘laribus paternis’; 1, 24,

‘patricios omnes opibus cum provocet unus,

quo tondente gravis iuveni mihi barba sonabat.’

So 10, 225.

In
vita
iv. he is said to have attained equestrian rank.
(Tribunician rank implied equestrian). This, on the whole,
is confirmed by the inscription, and may be founded on
the original
vita
.

Juvenal had a full course of education, first under the

litterator
and the
grammaticus
, then under the
rhetor
.
[95]

Cf. 1, 15,

‘Et nos ergo manum ferulae subduximus, et nos

consilium dedimus Sullae, privatus ut altum

dormiret.’

This would imply a good position, and a certain command
of money. Such
patres libertini
as Horace’s were
very rare.

The inscription above quoted (
divi Vespasiani
shows
that its date is after
A.D.
79, and probably not long after)
informs us that Juvenal was (1) ‘tribunus cohortis I.
Delmatarum’
[96]
; (2) ‘duumvir quinquennalis’
[97]
and ‘flamen
divi Vespasiani’ at Aquinum. The dates when Juvenal
held these posts cannot be determined exactly; but we
can infer certain points.

(1) There was a
certus ordo honorum
in municipal life,
and Juvenal must have held the quaestorship and the
aedileship before the
duumviratus quinquennalis
. The
lower limit of entering on a municipal career was twenty-five,
according to an order of Augustus, and people did
not usually begin it much later; we may therefore conclude
that these municipal posts were held by Juvenal
somewhere between
A.D.
80 and 90. The last year is
approximately fixed by the way in which Martial in two
of his epigrams (vii. 24 and 91) belonging to
A.D.
91
or 92 speaks of Juvenal; the words show that the
latter must have been established in Rome for some
time.

(2) In ordinary course Juvenal would enter the army
after the completion of his seventeenth year. The short
time he took to arrive at the position of tribune, and the
statement of
vita
iv. ‘cum ... ad dignitatem equestris
ordinis pervenire sua virtute meruisset,’ make it probable
that he entered the army as
petitor militiae equestris
,
as a preliminary step towards entering on a political
career.

The cohors Delmatarum I., which Juvenal commanded
as tribune, was in Britain in
A.D.
106, and in
A.D.
124.
[98]

Probably it had been stationed there for a period of
years, and it is likely that Juvenal filled his tribuneship
there. Now, all the
vitae
inform us that Juvenal was
banished under the pretext of a military command. While
the other
vitae
give Egypt as the place of his banishment,

vita
iv. gives Scotland; and it seems highly probable that

vita
iv. has confused Juvenal’s regular military command
in Britain, and his banishment, late in life, to Egypt.
The words are:

‘[Tyrannus] sub honoris praetextu fecit eum praefectum
militis contra Scotos, qui bellum contra Romanos
moverant.’

This is supported by Juvenal’s references to Britain.
Some of these, like his references to Egypt, seem, in
contradistinction to most of his references to foreign parts,
to imply personal knowledge and observation. They are
as follows:

(1) 2, 159-161,

‘Arma quidem ultra

litora Iuvernae promovimus et modo captas

Orcadas ac minima contentos nocte Britannos.’

Here ‘Iuverna’ is the old name of Ireland, which is not
mentioned even in Tacitus’
Agricola
[99]
; for the Orcades
cf. Tac.
Agr.
10; and the excessive shortness of the
summer nights mentioned in the last clause is especially
true of the north of Scotland.

(2) 10, 14,

‘Quanto delphinis balaena Britannica maior.’

This is also particularly applicable to the north of Scotland,
whales being frequently seen off the Orkney and
Shetland Islands.

(3) 4, 141,

‘Rutupinove edita fundo

ostrea.’

(4) 14, 196,

‘Castella Brigantum.’

(5) 15, 111,

‘Gallia causidicos docuit facunda Britannos,

de conducendo loquitur iam rhetore Thule.’

Cf. Tac.
Agr.
21.

(6) 15, 124, ‘Brittones.’ This form is rarely found
except in military inscriptions,
[100]
and could scarcely have
been used except by one familiar with the camp in
Britain.
[101]

That Juvenal came to Rome about
A.D.
90 has been
shown above. This step he may have taken to forward
his promotion in the army and afterwards in the procuratorial
service. His failure in this direction may have
led to his pessimism. His friendship with Martial (whom,
however, he does not mention) is shown by Mart. vii.
24 (cf. vii. 91),

‘Cum Iuvenale meo quae me committere temptas,

quid non audebis, perfida lingua, loqui?’ etc.

That he was still in Rome in
B.C.
101, and had the
entrÃ©e of the atria of rich nobles is shown by Mart. xii.
18, written in that year.

‘Dum tu forsitan inquietus erras

clamosa, Iuvenalis, in Subura

aut collem dominae teris Dianae,

dura per limina te potentiorum

sudatrix toga ventilat vagumque

maior Caelius et minor fatigant,

me multos repetita post Decembres

accepit mea rusticumque fecit

auro Bilbilis et superba ferro.’

From this we see that he lived in the Subura, the plebeian
quarter. Cf. 3, 5,

‘ego vel Prochytam praepono Suburae.’

While in Rome he still possessed his land at Aquinum
and also a property at Tibur; 11, 65,

‘de Tiburtino veniet pinguissimus agro

haedulus.’

The statement of the
vitae
that Juvenal studied rhetoric
till middle life is, as already stated, improbable, as
being inconsistent with his military and municipal career;
‘facundus,’ applied to him by Mart. vii. 91, 1, does not
mean ‘declaiming,’ but ‘poetical’ or ‘oratorical.’

Vitae
i.
a
and
b
(and other seven) say, ‘ad mediam fere
aetatem declamavit animi magis causa quam quod scholae
se aut foro praepararet.’

Juvenal’s literary life.
—In the
MSS.
the satires are divided
into Books, and the division seems ancient. Book i. includes

Sat.
1-5; Book ii. =
Sat.
6; Book iii. =
Sat.
7-9;
Book iv. =
Sat.
10-12; Book v. =
Sat.
13-16.

Book i. was written under Trajan; certainly after
A.D.
100,
the date of the trial of Marius Priscus
[102]
; 1, 49,

‘exul ab octava Marius bibit et fruitur dis

iratis.’

Book ii. not earlier than
A.D.
116. It is highly probable
that 6, 407, ‘instantem regi Armenio Parthoque cometen,’
refers to a comet seen at Rome in November
A.D.
115;
and 6, 411, ‘nutare urbes, subsidere terras,’ to the earthquake
at Antioch, 13th December,
A.D.
115.

Book iii., probably about
A.D.
120, was written under
Hadrian, who is eulogized in 7, 1-35. DÃ¼rr thinks it
probable that 7, 36-243, was written under Trajan, and
that the introduction, in praise of Hadrian, was written
afterwards. This is also FriedlÃ¤nder’s view; cf. l. 1, ‘Et
spes et ratio studiorum in Caesare tantum,’ with Spart.
vit.
Hadr.
14, 8, ‘poematum studiosissimus.’ This also supports
the view that the introduction was written not long after
Hadrian’s accession, when a new era for poets was supposed
to be beginning.

Book iv. was probably written about
A.D.
125.

Book v. A clue to the date is found in 13, 16-7,

‘Stupet haec, qui iam post terga reliquit

sexaginta annos, Fonteio consule natus.’

Fonteius Capito and C. Iulius Rufus were consuls
A.D.
67,
in which year the sexagenarian friend whom Juvenal
addresses was born. The date of writing will therefore
be
A.D.
127.
[103]

Cf. also 15, 27, ‘nuper consule Iunco.’ Iuncus was
consul
A.D.
127, so that this satire could not have been
written before
A.D.
128. So 15, 44,

‘Horrida sane

Aegyptos, sed luxuria, quantum ipse notavi,

barbara famoso non cedit turba Canopo.’

Juvenal must have added these lines to the satire while
he was an exile in Egypt, if he did not write the whole
of it there. This is in accordance with what
vita
v. says,
‘in exilio ampliavit satyras.’ Supposing this passage to be
an addition, we may conclude that Book v. was written
about
A.D.
128, but not before that year.

Juvenal’s banishment.
—As before stated, all the
vitae
but
one give Egypt as the place of Juvenal’s exile. The exact
place, according to the scholiast on 1, 1 and 4, 38, was
the Great Oasis (Hoasa: Hoasis). Three
vitae
(i.
a
,
b
,
iii.
c
) state that he was at that time
octogenarius
. This
would make the date
A.D.
135 or 136. Most of the
vitae

give as the reason of his exile the fact that he wrote the
lines,
[104]
7, 90-2,

‘Quod non dant proceres dabit histrio. Tu Camerinos

et Baream, tu nobilium magna atria curas?

Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos.’

Now these lines, the first he ever wrote (
vita
iii.
c
) were
composed in his youth as an epigram on Paris, Domitian’s
favourite, probably about
A.D.
81-3. The true story then
is that, when Juvenal in
A.D.
135 or 136 published a new
edition of
Sat.
7, he added these lines (
vitae
i.
a
,
b
, ‘ut ea
quoque quae prima fecerat inferciret novis scriptis’).
[105]
Now
it has been inferred from Spart.
vit. Hadr.
23
sqq.
that at
this time an actor had great influence over Hadrian, and
the lines were taken as referring to him. The emperor in
a rage banished Juvenal to Egypt
per honorem militiae
,
writing maliciously on his commission ‘Et te Philomela
promovit’ (
vita
iv.). The banishment is assigned to the
influence of Paris by Iohannes Malalas, p. 262
sqq.

(Dindorf), and by Suidas. Cf. also
Sat.
15, 44
sqq.
,
already quoted, and Sidonius Apollinaris 9, 267
sqq.
,

‘Non qui tempore Caesaris secundi

aeterno incoluit Tomos reatu:

non qui consimili deinde casu

ad volgi tenuem strepentis auram

irati fuit histrionis exul.’

Vita
iii.
b
, ‘Tristitia et angore periit anno aetatis suae
altero et octuagesimo.’

Vita
v., ‘Decessit longo senio confectus exul Antonino
Pio imperatore.’

If this last statement is correct, Juvenal died after
reaching the age of eighty-two, as Antoninus came to the
throne on 10th July,
A.D.
138. It follows from this also
that he must have been born in the second half of
A.D.
55.

The Satires.
—The following are the more important
points regarding these:

(1) Juvenal’s reasons for writing satire are given in
Sat.
1,
ll. 1-14. He is wearied with tragedies and epics on mythological
subjects, ‘Semper ego auditor tantum?’

He is resolved to follow in the footsteps of Lucilius;
ll. 19-21,

‘Cur tamen hoc potius libeat decurrere campo,

per quem magnus equos Auruncae flexit alumnus,

si vacat ac placidi rationem admittitis, edam.’

His satire is due to indignation at the moral decay of the
Roman world.

l. 30, ‘Difficile est satiram non scribere’ (cf. ll. 63,
79).

However, he does not intend to satirize the living, at
least under their own names; and in fact he has in his
mind particularly the times of Domitian, while most of
his names are those of persons living under Claudius or
Nero; l. 170,

‘Experiar quid concedatur in illos,

quorum Flaminia tegitur cinis atque Latina.’

In the first nine Satires Juvenal’s bitterness is directed
mainly against the senatorial class, possibly because they
had given him no support in his office-seeking. Even his
violent attack on women in
Sat.
6 is launched chiefly
against the women of the highest class. Note also the
unjust way in which he speaks of the government of the
provinces (
Sat.
8, 87-139). Juvenal is very bitter against
Greeks and Orientals, most of all against Egyptians (cf.

Sat.
15, and his attacks on the Egyptian Crispinus in 4,
1-33, etc.). Cf. 3, 119-125, for his attacks on foreigners.

(2) He claims a wide scope for his subject; 1, 85,

‘Quidquid agunt homines, votum timor ira voluptas

gaudia discursus nostri farrago libelli est.’

(3) His pessimism is very marked; cf. 1, 147,

‘Nil erit ulterius, quod nostris moribus addat

posteritas; eadem facient cupientque minores,

omne in praecipiti vitium stetit. Utere velis,

totos pande sinus.’

So 12, 48-9. His pessimism leads to extravagant language
like 6, 29
sqq.
He is as hard on trifling foibles as on the
most heinous offences. Cf. 6, 166
sqq.
, 185
sqq.
, 398
sqq.
,
434-56 (on learned ladies).

(4) His rhetorical learning and style (found in all the
Satires, but particularly in the later ones) are shown by

(
a
) His metre and language. Thus we find rhetorical
uses of
ergo
(3, 104; 281, etc.);
nunc
(3, 268; 10, 210);

porro
(3, 126; 11, 9); and of other particles.

(
b
) The way in which he chooses themes for his Satires,
and subdivides them. Several of the Satires, as 5, 8, 10, 14,
are
theses
,
i.e.
problems of a general character worked out
in the manner of the rhetorical schools. Thus
Sat.
5
discusses the question, ‘Is the position of a client worth
having?’
Sat.
8, ‘Has high birth a value in itself?’ He
sometimes uses the commonplaces of the schools, as 8, 56,

‘Animalia muta

quis generosa putet nisi fortia?’

So 8, 215-6. In the manner of a rhetorician he sometimes
gives superabundant details. The best example of this is
10, 190-250, on the troubles of old age.

(
c
) His knowledge of mythology, history, law, and philosophy.
This is found mostly in the later Books. In
the earlier Satires he dealt more with life as he had
known it. In the later Satires he has recourse to republican
times and to foreign history. His historical examples
FriedlÃ¤nder thinks he took mostly from Valerius Maximus.
Juvenal’s knowledge of philosophy was very superficial,
and was probably got from his rhetorical training. Errors
occur; thus in 13, 121-2, Stoics and Cynics are looked
upon as identical.
[106]

(
d
) His high-flown language referred to above.

(
e
) His references to previous literature. Thus Horace
is often referred to (cf. 7, 62 and 227); Virgil with great
frequency (cf. 1, 162; 6, 434
sqq.
; 7, 66 and 227; 7, 233
sqq.
).
Mayor mentions Homer, Herodotus, Plato, Lucilius, Cicero,
Ovid, Manilius, Valerius Maximus, Seneca, Lucan, and
Martial among the authors imitated by Juvenal.

PLINY THE YOUNGER.

Pliny’s full name on the inscriptions of the later period
of his life reads ‘C. Plinius L. f. Ouf. Caecilius Secundus.’
This name he partly got from his mother’s brother C.
Plinius Secundus (Pliny the elder), who adopted him by
will: cf.
Ep.
v. 8, 5, ‘Avunculus meus idemque per
adoptionem pater.’ Pliny’s name before his adoption in

A.D.
79 (see below) was P. Caecilius L. f. Ouf. Secundus.
His birthplace was Comum, and he belonged to the
Oufentina, the tribe of the people of Comum, as well on
the side of his natural as on that of his adoptive father.
In an inscription preserved at Como (
C.I.L.
v. 5279)
Pliny’s father, Cilo, is mentioned, and two men who are
undoubtedly Cilo’s sons, the second mentioned being Pliny
the younger, who had always been called Secundus.

‘L. Caecilius L. f. Cilo iiii.vir a(edilicia) p(otestate),
qui testamento suo (sestertium) n(ummum) xxxx. (milia)
municipibus Comensibus legavit, ex quorum reditu quotannis
per Neptunalia oleum in campo et in thermis et
in balineis omnibus, quae sunt Comi, praeberentur,
t(estamento) f(ieri) iussit et L. Caecilio L. f. Valenti et
P. Caecilio L. f. Secundo et Lutullae Picti f. contubernali.’
[107]

For Cilo’s bequests here mentioned cf. Pliny,
Ep.
i, 8,
5; Comum is referred to as ‘patria mea’ in
Ep.
iv. 30, 1.
The Caecilii were a family of station at Comum even in
Caesar’s time. Cf. Catull. 35,

‘Poetae tenero meo sodali

velim Caecilio, papyre, dicas,

Veronam veniat Novi relinquens

Comi moenia Lariumque litus.’

Pliny inherited landed property there from his father and
mother.

Ep.
vii. 11, 5, ‘Indicavit mihi cupere se aliquid circa
Larium nostrum possidere: ego illi ex praediis meis quod
vellet ... optuli, exceptis maternis paternisque.’

The above inscription shows that Pliny’s father belonged
to the municipal nobility, and possibly had ‘equestris
nobilitas.’

Pliny was in his eighteenth year (
Ep.
vi. 20, 5, ‘agebam
duodevicensimum annum’) on 24th August,
A.D.
79, when
his uncle perished in the eruption of Vesuvius, and he
was therefore born in the second half of 61 or in the
first half of 62
A.D.
Cilo died young, before holding the
chief municipal post, and before Pliny was of age; and
Verginius Rufus became Pliny’s guardian.

Ep.
ii. 1, 8, ‘Ille mihi tutor relictus adfectum parentis
exhibuit.’ Pliny was removed to Rome with his uncle,
probably at the end of
A.D.
72. While at school he
wrote poetry (
Ep.
vii. 4, 2, quoted below), and studied
philosophy and rhetoric.

Ep.
vi. 6, 3, ‘Quos tunc ego frequentabam, Quintilianum,
Niceten Sacerdotem.’ Cf. also ii. 14, 10; i. 20, 4; vii.
4, etc. For literary studies with his uncle cf.
Ep.
vi.
20, 5, ‘Posco librum Titi Livi et quasi per otium lego,
atque etiam, ut coeperam, excerpo.’

His uncle, as above stated, died on 24th August,
A.D.

79, and by his will adopted Pliny, whose name thereafter
was C. Plinius L. f. Ouf. Caecilius Secundus. He therefore
changed his praenomen to that of his adoptive
father, and put his former nomen among his cognomina.
By his contemporaries he is called Plinius (cf. Martial, x.
19), or Secundus, as by Trajan. The name Caecilius
was confined to formal inscriptions.

In
A.D.
80 or 81 Pliny first appeared as an advocate.
Cf.
Ep.
v. 8, 8, ‘Undevicensimo aetatis anno dicere in
foro coepi.’ Before entering the Senate, he held (as
stated in the chief inscription, given below) the decemvirate

litibus iudicandis
, the military tribunate in the third Gallic
legion, and the title of Sevir in the Roman knighthood.
Pliny probably held his military tribunate under Domitian
(
i.e.
, after 13th September,
A.D.
81) in Syria.

Cf.
Ep.
i. 10, 2, ‘Hunc [Euphraten philosophum] ego
in Syria, cum adulescentulus militarem, penitus et domi
inspexi.’

The date of Pliny’s praetorship as
A.D.
93 is settled by

Ep.
iii. 11, 2, the events recorded in which passage are
known from Tac.
Agr.
45 to have taken place shortly
after Agricola’s death in August,
A.D.
93.

‘Fui praetor ... cum ... occisis Senecione Rustico Helvidio,
relegatis Maurico Gratilla Arria Fannia ... mihi quoque
impendere idem exitium certis quibusdam notis augurarer.’

The words in
Ep.
vii. 16 (of Calestrius Tiro), ‘Simul
quaestores Caesaris fuimus: ille me in tribunatu liberorum
iure praecessit, ego illum in praetura sum consecutus,
cum mihi Caesar annum remisisset,’ refer to the fact that
the emperor did not insist on the year of absence from
office between the tribunate and the quaestorship. Pliny
was quaestor from 1st June, 89 to 31st May, 90
A.D.
,
being nominated by the emperor, as shown by the above
passage. He was
trib. pleb.
from 10th December, 90 to 9th
December, 91
A.D.
, and during his year of office undertook
no cases. Cf.
Ep.
i. 23, 2, ‘Ipse cum tribunus
essem ... abstinui causis agendis.’ By special favour he
was allowed to take office as praetor on 1st January,
A.D.

93. In this year he appeared before the Senate for the
people of Baetica against the procurator Baebius Massa.

Ep.
vii. 33, esp. Â§ 4, ‘Dederat me senatus cum Herennio
Senecione advocatum provinciae Baeticae contra Baebium
Massam.’

The inscriptions of Pliny show that he was
praefectus
aerarii militaris
between his praetorship in 93 and his

praefectura aerarii Saturni
(from 98 onwards), and this
office he held either from 94 to 96 or from 95 to 97
A.D.

Pliny tells us that he and Cornutus Tertullus were designated
consuls, when they had held the
praefectura aerarii
Saturni
for less than two years.

Paneg.
91, ‘Nondum biennium compleveramus in
officio laboriosissimo et maximo, cum tu nobis ... consulatum
obtulisti.’

This
designatio
took place on 9th January,
A.D.
100,
whence the
praefectura
must have been entered on shortly
after 9th January,
A.D.
98. Pliny was probably nominated
to it by Nerva and Trajan.

Cf.
ad Trai.
3, ‘Ut primum me, domine, indulgentia

vestra
promovit ad praefecturam aerarii Saturni.’

Mommsen
[108]
believes that this praefectura was held at
the same time as the consulship, and on to December,

A.D.
101, an unusual length of tenure. H. F. Stobbe,
however, makes the trial of Classicus, on which the last
date depends, extend from September 99 to July 100

A.D.
(
Philologus
, xxx. 347
sqq.
).

Paneg.
92, ‘Nobis praefectis aerarii consulatum ante
quam successorem dedisti.’

Pliny, along with Cornutus Tertullus, his colleague in
the
praefectura
, was made consul
A.D.
100. He held the
office in September of that year, and the tenure was
either from July 1 to September 30, or from September
1 to October 31.

Paneg.
92, ‘Ei nos potissimum mensi attribuisti quem
tuus natalis exornat.’

The
Panegyricus
is a speech of thanks to Trajan spoken
on this occasion. In
A.D.
99 Pliny, along with Tacitus,
appeared for the Africans against the proconsul Marius
Priscus (see
Ep.
ii. 11 quoted
p. 338
); and in
A.D.
101,
while still
praefectus aerarii
, he appeared for the people of
Baetica against the proconsul Caecilius Classicus.

Ep.
iii. 4, 2, ‘Legati provinciae Baeticae questuri de proconsulatu
Caecili Classici advocatum me a senatu petierunt.’

Pliny obtained the augurship, probably in 103 or 104,
in succession to Sex. Iulius Frontinus, who probably died
in 102 or 103
A.D.
Cf.
Ep.
iv. 8, 3, ‘Successi Iulio
Frontino.’ In 103 or 104
A.D.
he appeared against the
Bithynians for the proconsul Iulius Bassus (
Ep.
iv. 9 etc.).
He held the
cura alvei Tiberis et riparum et cloacarum
urbis
probably from 105 to 107
A.D.
See Pliny’s chief
inscription (below), and cf.
Ep.
v. 14, 1-2, ‘Mihi nuntiatum
est Cornutum Tertullum accepisse Aemiliae viae curam
... aliquanto magis me delectat mandatum mihi officium,
postquam par Cornuto datum video.’

About
A.D.
106 Pliny appeared against the Bithynians
for the proconsul Varenus Rufus (
Ep.
vi. 29, 11).

From 111-2 or 112-3
A.D.
Pliny was governor of Pontus
and Bithynia, being sent out for a special purpose by
the emperor as
legatus pro praetore consulari potestate
.
Cf. the chief inscription (below) and the words of Trajan.

Trai.
32, ‘Meminerimus idcirco te in istam provinciam
missum, quoniam multa in ea emendanda apparuerint.’

The date of Pliny’s governorship is fixed by the mention
of Calpurnius Macer in the letters (
ad Trai.
42; 61; 62)
as the governor of the nearest province. Mommsen has
identified him with P. Calpurnius Macer Caulius Rufus,
who is shown by an inscription (
C.I.L.
iii. 7 and 17) to
have been governor of Lower Moesia in 112
A.D.
This
is corroborated by the fact that no mention is made of
Bithynia in the chief collection of letters, which was not
completed till
A.D.
108 at least. Therefore the governorship
falls after that time. On the other hand, Pliny
must have been sent out not later than
A.D.
113, as in
the chief inscription
Optimus
does not appear in Trajan’s
name, and this cognomen he assumed in
A.D.
114.
Finally, the fact that Trajan was at Rome during Pliny’s
governorship points to a time between the end of the
second Dacian War in
A.D.
107 and the outbreak of the
Parthian War in
A.D.
113.

Our information about Pliny ends with the close of
his correspondence with Trajan. It is certain that he
held no further office, and it is probable that he died
before
A.D.
114 in his province or shortly after his return
to Rome.

As regards municipal relations, Pliny held the post of

flamen divi Augusti
, according to the inscription which
the corporation of Vercellae erected to him at his own
town (
C.I.L.
v. 5667).

‘C. Plini[o L. f. O]uf. Caec[ilio] Secundo [c]os. augur. cur.
alv. Tib. [et ripa]r. et cloac. urb. [praef. a]er. Sat. praef.
aer. mil. [pr. tr. pl.] imp. sevir. eq. R. tr. m[i]l. leg. iii. Gall.
x. viro stl. iud. fl. divi T. Aug.’

For bequests to his native town see the chief inscription
(below). Besides these are mentioned gifts in his life-time.
Under Domitian Pliny presented his townspeople with a
library (
Ep.
i, 8), apparently worth 1,000,000 sesterces
(v. 7), and endowed it with 100,000 sesterces. He also
gave 500,000 sesterces for the support of freeborn boys
and girls (
Ep.
i, 8); and promised to pay one-third of
the salary of the professor of rhetoric at Comum (
Ep.

iv. 13, 5).

The following is the chief inscription of Pliny (as
restored by Mommsen), which was erected at the
Thermae

which he presented to Comum (
C.I.L.
v. 5262):

Pliny was also patron of Tifernum Tiberinum and of
the Baetici.

Ep.
iv. 1, 4, ‘Oppidum est praediis nostris vicinum,
nomen Tiferni Tiberini, quod me paene adhuc puerum
patronum cooptavit ... In hoc ego ... templum pecunia mea
exstruxi, cuius dedicationem ... differre longius inreligiosum
est.’

Ep.
iii. 4, 4, ‘Legati ... inplorantes fidem meam, quam
essent contra Massam Baebium experti, adlegantes patrocini
foedus.’

Pliny married three times, twice under Domitian. Cf.

ad Trai.
2, ‘Liberos ... habere etiam tristissimo illo saeculo
volui, sicut potes duobus matrimoniis meis credere.’
For his third wife, Calpurnia, who died
A.D.
97, see

Ep.
iv. 19. Pliny had no children, but Trajan conferred
on him the
ius trium liberorum
in
A.D.
98. Cf.
ad Trai.

2, ‘Me dignum putasti iure trium liberorum.’

Pliny as orator and writer.
—Most of Pliny’s cases
were before the
centumviri
, who dealt with inheritances:
cf.
Ep.
vi. 12, 2, ‘in harena mea, hoc est apud centumviros.’
So Mart. x. 19, 14 (written
A.D.
96),

‘Totos dat tetricae dies Minervae

dum centum studet auribus virorum

hoc quod saecula posterique possint

Arpinis quoque comparare chartis.’

For Pliny’s five speeches in criminal trials before
the Senate see above. Cf.
Ep.
vi. 29, 7
sqq.
, ‘Egi
quasdam a senatu iussus ... Adfui Baeticis contra Baebium
Massam ... Adfui rursus isdem querentibus de Caecilio
Classico ... Accusavi Marium Priscum ... Tuitus sum
Iulium Bassum ... Dixi proxime pro Vareno.’

Pliny recited his speeches before delivering them, and
subsequently published them, sometimes with additions.

Ep.
vii. 17, 2, ‘Miror quod scribis fuisse quosdam qui
reprehenderent quod orationes omnino recitarem.’

Ep.
iii. 18, 1 (of the
Panegyricus
), ‘Quod ego in senatu
cum ad rationem et loci et temporis ex more fecissem,
bono civi convenientissimum credidi eadem illa spatiosius
et uberius volumine amplecti.’

Pliny speaks of his early attempts at poetry:

Ep.
vii. 4, 2-3, ‘Numquam a poetice (altius enim
repetam) alienus fui; quin etiam quattuordecim natus
annos Graecam tragoediam scripsi. Qualem? inquis:
nescio: tragoedia vocabatur.’

In Books i.-iii. he appears only as a lover of poetry and
a patron of poets (cf. i. 16; iii. 15). From Book iv.
(published
A.D.
105) onwards he appears as a poet. In

Ep.
vii. 4, 6 are thirteen poor hexameter lines on Cicero;

ibid.
Â§Â§ 7-8, ‘Transii ad elegos: hos quoque non minus
celeriter explicui: addidi iambos, facilitate corruptus ...
Postremo placuit exemplo multorum unum separatim
hendecasyllaborum volumen absolvere, nec paenitet.
Legitur, describitur, cantatur etiam.’ Pliny defends himself
for writing light verses in
Ep.
v. 3, etc. In the later
books he refers to another proposed collection of verses.

Ep.
viii. 21, 3, ‘Liber fuit et opusculis varius et
metris.’

Pliny says he did not observe chronological order in
publishing his letters.

Ep.
i. 1, 1, ‘Collegi non servato temporis ordine
(neque enim historiam componebam), sed ut quaeque in
manus venerat.’

This, however, is not convincing, as it falls in with
Pliny’s wish to give an appearance of negligence to the
work, and besides it may apply only to Book i. Successive
publication of the different Books is shown by many
references; so
Ep.
ix. 19, ‘Significas legisse te in quadam
epistula,’ where
Ep.
vi. 10 is referred to. So also contemporaneous
events are always described in the same
Book or in two Books close together; and when a subject
is continued in another letter, the order of the two letters
fits in with chronology. So iii. 4 and iv. 1 deal with
the building of a temple at Tifernum; iii. 20 and iv. 25
with ballot at elections.

The following are the probable dates of publication:
Book i. in
A.D.
97; Book ii. in
A.D.
100; Book iii. in

A.D.
101 or 102; Book iv. in
A.D.
105; Book v. in
A.D.

106; Book vi. possibly in
A.D.
106; Book vii. in
A.D.

107; Book viii. not before
A.D.
109; Book ix. probably
about the same time.

The correspondence with Trajan is independent of the
nine Books of letters. The epistles are roughly in chronological
order.
Epp.
1-14 range from 98 to 106
A.D.

Epp.
15 to the end were probably all written in Bithynia
during Pliny’s governorship there. Trajan’s reply is subjoined
to most of the letters. The correspondence extant
stretches from September
A.D.
111 over January
A.D.
113.

Pliny had intimate relations with other writers, the
principal being Tacitus; Martial (cf.
Ep.
iii. 21); Silius
Italicus (cf.
Ep.
iii. 7). See
pp. 340
,
298
,
289
. For his
literary reputation see
Ep.
ix. 23, 2, quoted
p. 338
and cf.

Ep.
i. 2, 6, ‘Libelli quos emisimus dicuntur in manibus
esse, quamvis iam gratiam novitatis exuerint; nisi tamen
auribus nostris bibliopolae blandiuntur.’

Pliny’s character.
—Pliny, without being a great man, is
a more favourable specimen of character, feeling, and gentlemanly
tone, than almost any other Roman author. He
avoided censorious writing, and most of the people he
mentions are praised. The chief exception is Regulus
(
Ep.
i. 5, etc.), and possibly also Iavolenus Priscus (vi.
15). When anybody is blamed, his name is omitted unless
he is dead or has been banished.

Ep.
vii. 28, i, ‘Ais quosdam apud te reprehendisse,
tamquam amicos meos ex omni occasione ultra modum
laudem. Agnosco crimen, amplector etiam. Quid enim
honestius culpa benignitatis?’

For his desire of praise cf.
Ep.
ix. 23, 5, ‘An ... ego
celebritate nominis mei gaudere non debeo? Ego vero
et gaudeo et gaudere me dico.’

For his kindness to slaves cf.
Ep.
viii. 16, 1, ‘Permitto
servis quoque quasi testamenta facere eaque ut legitima
custodio’ (and the rest of the letter).

For his grief at the loss of friends cf.
Ep.
v. 21, 6,
‘Sed quid ego indulgeo dolori? cui si frenos remittas,
nulla materia non maxima est. Finem epistulae faciam,
ut facere possim etiam lacrimis quas epistula expressit.’

For his love of nature cf. Ep. i. 9, 6, ‘O mare, o litus,
verum secretumque
Î¼Î¿Ï
ÏÎµá¿Î¿Î½
, quam multa invenitis, quam
multa dictatis!’

Cf. also descriptions of natural scenery, as in
Epp.
ii.
17, 3; v. 6, 13; vi. 31, 15; viii. 8.

TACITUS.

(1) LIFE.

The historian’s full name is uncertain. Other writers,

e.g.
Pliny the younger, call him Cornelius Tacitus, or simply
Tacitus. His praenomen is given as P. in the best Tacitean

MS.
(Mediceus I.), and as C. in later
MSS.
and by Sidonius
Apollinaris (
Ep.
iv. 14; 22).
[109]
His birthplace is unknown.
The tradition that he was born at Interamna in Umbria
arose from the fact that the emperor Tacitus (
A.D.
275-6),
who claimed descent from the historian (Vopisc.
Tac.
10, 3),
was born there.
[110]
The probable date of his birth is got
from a comparison of two passages:

Dial.
1, ‘Disertissimorum ... hominum ... quos eamdem
hanc quaestionem pertractantes iuvenis admodum audivi.’

Pliny,
Ep.
vii. 20, 3, ‘Erit rarum et insigne duos homines
aetate dignitate propemodum aequales ... alterum alterius
studia fovisse. Equidem adulescentulus, cum iam tu fama
gloriaque floreres, te sequi, tibi longo sed proximus intervallo
et esse et haberi concupiscebam.’

The dramatic date of the Dialogue is
A.D.
75 (
Dial.
17),
and at that time Tacitus, as
iuvenis admodum
, must have
been between seventeen and twenty. From a consideration
of the words of Pliny, who was born
A.D.
61 or 62, the
later age seems nearer the mark, and we may conclude
that Tacitus was born
A.D.
55 or 56.

We have no positive information about Tacitus’ family,
but his education, political career, and marriage into a
distinguished house, prove that he belonged to a family
of station. The first person of the name we know of is
mentioned by Pliny the elder as an
eques
, and may have
been Tacitus’ father.

Pliny,
N.H.
vii. 76, ‘Corneli Taciti, equitis Romani,
Belgicae Galliae rationes procurantis.’

Tacitus received the regular rhetorical training under the
best masters.

Dial.
2, ‘M. Aper et Iulius Secundus, celeberrima tum
ingenia fori nostri, quos ego in iudiciis non modo studiose
audiebam, sed domi quoque et in publico adsectabar, mira
studiorum cupiditate et quodam ardore iuvenili, ut fabulas
quoque eorum et disputationes et arcana semotae dictionis
penitus exciperem.’

That Tacitus had a very great reputation as a speaker
is seen from Pliny,
Ep.
ix. 23, 2, ‘Numquam maiorem
cepi voluptatem, quam nuper ex sermone Corneli Taciti.
Narrabat sedisse se cum quodam Circensibus proximis:
hunc post varios eruditosque sermones requisisse “Italicus
es an provincialis?” se respondisse “nosti me, et quidem
ex studiis.” Ad hoc illum “Tacitus es an Plinius?”’

In
A.D.
98 (according to others, 97) Tacitus delivered
the funeral oration over Verginius Rufus, and in
A.D.
100
he and Pliny prosecuted Marius Priscus, proconsul of
Africa, for extortion.

Pliny,
Ep.
ii. 1, 6, ‘Laudatus est [Verginius Rufus] a
consule Cornelio Tacito: nam hic supremus felicitati eius
cumulus accessit, laudator eloquentissimus.’

Ibid.
ii. 11, 2, ‘Ego et Cornelius Tacitus, adesse provincialibus
iussi.’ Â§ 17, ‘Respondit Cornelius Tacitus
eloquentissime, et quod eximium orationi eius inest,
ÏÎµÎ¼Î½á¿¶Ï
.’

In
A.D.
77 Tacitus was betrothed to the daughter of
Agricola, then consul, and in
A.D.
78 he married her.

Agr.
9, ‘Consul egregiae tum spei filiam iuveni mihi
despondit ac post consulatum collocavit, et statim Britanniae
praepositus est.’

Tacitus gives us a clue to his political career in
Hist.

i. 1.

‘Dignitatem nostram a Vespasiano incohatam, a Tito
auctam, a Domitiano longius provectam non abnuerim.’

This probably means that Vespasian granted him the

latus clavus
,
i.e.
a place in the
ordo senatorius
, which was
followed by the
vigintiviratus
given by the Senate, and a
commission in the army as
tribunus militum laticlavius
;
that Titus appointed him quaestor
A.D.
80-1; and that
Domitian made him tribune or aedile (about 84), and in

A.D.
88 praetor. For the last office cf.
Ann.
xi. 11,

‘Is [Domitianus] edidit ludos saeculares, eisque intentius
adfui sacerdotio quindecimvirali praeditus ac tunc praetor.’

That Tacitus was absent from Rome
A.D.
90-93 we may
infer from what he says of Agricola’s death (
A.D.
93).

Agr.
45, ‘Nobis tam longae absentiae condicione ante
quadriennium amissus est.’

He must have returned to Rome soon afterwards, for
he says in the same chapter: ‘Mox nostrae duxere Helvidium
in carcerem manus; nos Maurici Rusticique visus,
nos innocenti sanguine Senecio perfudit.’

Tacitus was appointed consul suffectus under Trajan

A.D.
98 (see Pliny,
Ep.
ii. 1, 6, above quoted).

An inscription found at Mylasa in Caria shows that
Tacitus was proconsul of Asia about 112-116
A.D.
[111]

Tacitus probably died soon after the publication of the

Annals
(
A.D.
115-7), as he did not live to write his contemplated
works on the Augustan age and the reigns of
Nerva and Trajan.

Hist.
i. 1, ‘Quod si vita suppeditet, principatum divi
Nervae et imperium Traiani ... senectuti seposui.’

Ann.
iii. 24, ‘Cetera illius aetatis [Augusti] memorabo,
si effectis in quae tetendi, plures ad curas vitam produxero.’

Tacitus was on intimate terms with Pliny, eleven of
whose letters are addressed to him. From vii. 20 and
viii. 7 we see that they were in the habit of “exchanging
proof-sheets.” To the same circle belonged Fabius Iustus,
to whom the
Dialogus
is dedicated, and Asinius Rufus.

Pliny,
Ep.
iv. 15, 1, ‘Asinium Rufum singulariter
amo. ... Idem Cornelium Tacitum arta familiaritate
complexus est.’

(2) WORKS.

1.
Dialogus de Oratoribus
, an inquiry into the causes
of the decay of eloquence—‘cur nostra potissimum aetas
deserta et laude eloquentiae orbata vix nomen ipsum
oratoris retineat’ (
Dial.
1). Some critics have supposed
that Tacitus meant this work to be an
apologia pro vita
sua
, a justification of his preference for a literary to a
rhetorical career, but this cannot be proved. That Tacitus
is the author is clear from Pliny,
Ep.
ix. 10, 2, ‘Itaque
poemata quiescunt, quae tu inter nemora et lucos commodissime
perfici putas’—a reference to
Dial.
9, ‘poetis ...
in nemora et lucos, id est in solitudinem, secedendum est.’
The dramatic date is given in
Dial.
17 as
A.D.
75; the
statement there and in
Dial.
24 that one hundred and twenty
years have passed since Cicero’s death (which would give

A.D.
77) is made in round numbers. The date of composition
is uncertain. It was not under Domitian, as Tacitus
remained silent during his reign (
Agr.
2). We can hardly
suppose it to have been written under Nerva, as its style is
so different from that of the
Agricola
; but it may have been
written under Domitian, and published after his death.
Some authorities put it as early as
A.D.
81.
[112]

2.
De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae liber
, an account
of the life of Cn. Iulius Agricola, Tacitus’ father-in-law,
and particularly of his career in Britain. It was written
early in the reign of Trajan, and therefore after 27th Jan.,
98
A.D.
, and probably in that year.

Agr.
3, ‘quamquam primo statim beatissimi saeculi ortu
Nerva Caesar res olim dissociabiles miscuerit, principatum
ac libertatem, augeatque cottidie felicitatem temporum
Nerva Traianus.’

3.
Germania
.—The Vatican
MSS.
give the title as
de
origine et situ
(another
MS.
adds
moribus ac populis
) Germanorum.
The date of publication, as seen from
Germ.
37,
was
A.D.
98. The book is not mentioned in
Agr.
3 among
the proposed works of Tacitus; and it has therefore been
supposed that the materials were collected for the
Histories
,
and that the work was published separately on account of
its length, and also the interest felt in Germany at the
time. There is nothing in the theory that the book is a
political pamphlet, or that it contains a moral purpose.
Tacitus is by no means blind to the faults of the Germans
(c. 17
sqq.
, etc.), though he compares them favourably in
many respects with the Romans.

4.
Historiae
.—The title is guaranteed by Tertull.
apol.
16,
‘Cornelius Tacitus in quinta historiarum suarum.’ The
work embraced the time from Galba to Domitian,
i.e.

69-96
A.D.
The first four Books and part of the fifth are
extant, and give the history of 69 and most of 70
A.D.

In
MS.
Mediceus II., the only ancient
MS.
that contains

Ann.
xi.-xvi. and the
Histories
, there is no title, but the
Books are numbered continuously as belonging to the same
work. Cf. Jerome,
Comm. on Zacharias
, iii. 14, ‘Cornelius
Tacitus, qui post Augustum usque ad mortem Domitiani
vitas Caesarum triginta voluminibus exaravit.’ If, therefore,
the
Annals
contained sixteen Books, the
Histories
must
have contained fourteen, supposing Jerome’s statement to
be correct. Some authorities think the numbers were
eighteen and twelve respectively. The work was written
under Trajan (cf.
Hist.
i. 1, ‘principatum divi Nervae et
imperium Traiani’), and was probably brought out in
instalments. Pliny’s letters (vi. 16; 20; vii. 33), written
about
A.D.
106-9, contain contributions to it.

5.
Annales
, or rather
Ab excessu divi Augusti
, the title
given by
MS.
Med. I. Tacitus often calls his work
annales

(as in
Ann.
iv. 32), but uses the word to signify his plan
of recording events by their years. Cf.
Ann.
iv. 71, ‘Ni
mihi destinatum foret suum quaeque in annum referre,
avebat animus antire,’ etc.

He occasionally apologises (as in xii. 40) for departing
from this order for the sake of clearness. The Books,
the division into which was made by Tacitus himself (cf.
vi. 27, ‘in prioribus libris’), usually, however, end with
some important event.

The
Annals
deal with the time from the death of
Augustus to that of Nero,
i.e.
from 14 to 68
A.D.
There
are extant Books i.-iv. and a part of v. and vi., and Books
xi.-xvi., except the beginning of xi. and the end of xvi.
We have thus lost the whole of the reign of Caligula and
the reign of Claudius from 41-47 (part), and Nero’s reign
from the close of 66 to 68. The work was published
between
A.D.
115 and 117. This is settled by
Ann.
ii. 61,
‘Exin ventum Elephantinen ac Syenen, claustra olim
Romani imperii, quod nunc rubrum ad mare patescit.’

The conquest here spoken of was made by Trajan
A.D.

115, and his successor Hadrian, soon after coming to the
throne (August,
A.D.
117), gave up the regions beyond the
Euphrates and Tigris (Spartianus,
Hadri.
5).
[113]

Tacitus’ views on politics, philosophy, and religion.
—

(1) The ideal mixed form of government Tacitus considers
to be impracticable.

Ann.
iv. 33, ‘Cunctas nationes et urbes populus aut
primores aut singuli regunt: delecta ex eis et consociata
rei publicae forma laudari facilius quam evenire, vel si
evenit, haud diuturna esse potest.’

Tacitus is essentially a conservative. Thus he always
uses
antiquus
and
priscus
in a good sense (
H.
ii. 5; 64;

Ann.
vi. 32).

In
Ann.
iii. 60 he speaks with pride of the republic:
‘Magna eius diei species fuit, quo senatus maiorum beneficia,
sociorum pacta, regum etiam, qui ante vim Romanam
valuerant, decreta ipsorumque numinum religiones introspexit,
libero, ut quondam, quid firmaret mutaretve.’

See also the speech of C. Cassius in
Ann.
xiv. 43. As
an aristocrat Tacitus is sometimes unjust to men of low
birth, as in
Ann.
iv. 3, where he sneers at Seianus as
‘municipali adultero,’ and attaches great value to high
birth (cf. vi. 27). He is prejudiced against slaves and
barbarians.

Tacitus theoretically prefers a republic (cf.
Ann.
vi. 42,
‘Populi imperium iuxta libertatem, paucorum dominatio
regiae libidini propior est’), but admits the impossibility of
a restitution of the free state (
H.
ii. 37-8) and the necessity
of empire.
H.
i. 1 (of Augustus), ‘omnem potentiam ad
unum conferri pacis interfuit.’

Cf. also Galba’s speech in
H.
i. 16. The problem is
to reconcile the empire with freedom (see
Agr.
3 quoted

p. 341
). One’s duty is to steer one’s course
inter abruptam
contumaciam et deforme obsequium
(
Ann.
iv. 20). Tacitus
gives only modified approval to patriots like Paetus Thrasea
(
Ann.
xiv. 12; 49) and Helvidius Priscus (
H.
iv. 6), and
on the other hand gives praise for moderation to men like
Agricola (
Agr.
42), M. Lepidus (
Ann.
iv. 20), L. Piso
(
Ann.
vi. 10).

Ann.
xiv. 12, ‘Thrasea Paetus ... sibi causam periculi
fecit, ceteris libertatis initium non praebuit.’

Agr.
42, ‘Non contumacia neque inani iactatione libertatis
famam fatumque provocabat.’

Tacitus blames those who despair of their own times.

Ann.
ii. 88, ‘dum vetera extollimus recentium incuriosi.’ He
thinks that the emperors, from their irresponsible position,
were often gradually led into wickedness, their downward
career being helped by flatterers and satellites, and draws
a moral lesson from the servile Senate and the
delatores
,
who, like the emperors themselves, received punishment
for their conduct (
Ann.
i. 74; iii. 65
sqq.
).

Ann.
vi. 48, ‘Cum Tiberius post tantam rerum experientiam
vi dominationis convulsus et mutatus sit.’

Ann.
iv. 33, ‘Pauci prudentia honesta ab deterioribus
utilia ab noxiis discernunt, plures aliorum eventis docentur.’

Ann.
vi. 6, ‘Adeo facinora atque flagitia sua ipsi quoque
in supplicium verterant ... Quippe Tiberium non fortuna,
non solitudines protegebant, quin tormenta pectoris suasque
ipse poenas fateretur.’

(2) Tacitus attaches himself to no particular school of
philosophy, and deprecates too close an attention to the
subject.

Agr.
4, ‘Memoria teneo solitum ipsum [Agricolam]
narrare se prima in iuventa studium philosophiae acrius,
ultra quam concessum Romano ac senatori, hausisse, ni
prudentia matris incensum ac flagrantem animum coercuisset.’

He cannot make up his mind as to freewill and predestination,
but in spite of this doubt expressly states his
desire to find out the causes of events.

Ann.
vi. 22, ‘Sed mihi haec ac talia audienti in incerto
iudicium est, fatone res mortalium et necessitate immutabili
an forte volvantur’ (and the rest of the chapter, where the
Stoic and Epicurean views are mentioned). On the other
hand,
H.
i. 4, ‘Ut non modo casus eventusque rerum,
qui plerumque fortuiti sunt, sed ratio etiam causaeque
noscantur.’

He expresses his belief in divine agency, particularly in
the
Annals
, but sometimes adopts the pessimistic view
that the gods take little interest in mankind.

Ann.
xiv. 5, ‘Noctem sideribus inlustrem et placido mari
quietam, quasi convincendum ad scelus, di praebuere.’

H.
v. 5, ‘Pessimus quisque spretis religionibus patriis.’

H.
i. 3, ‘Nec enim umquam atrocioribus populi Romani
cladibus magisve iustis indiciis adprobatum est non esse
curae deis securitatem nostram, esse ultionem.’

Ann.
xvi. 33, ‘Aequitate deum erga bona malaque
documenta.’

He believes in the science of divination (see especially

Ann.
iv. 58), but speaks contemptuously of the impostors
found among soothsayers and astrologers.

H.
i. 22, ‘Mathematicis ... genus hominum potentibus
infidum, sperantibus fallax, quod in civitate nostra et vetabitur
semper et retinebitur.’

Prodigies are recognized, but mentioned only in the

Histories
and the last books of the
Annals
(from
A.D.
51
onwards). See especially
H.
ii. 50.

Tacitus as a historian.
—As regards his sources, Tacitus
makes more use of his predecessors than he does of original
documents. Among the latter he mentions
acta diurna

(
Ann.
iii. 3) and
commentarii
or
acta senatus
(
Ann.
xv. 74);
but these he did not make much use of, as they were apt
to be falsified. He also refers to
publica acta
, probably
inscriptions (
Ann.
xii. 24); Tiberius’ speeches (
Ann.
i. 81);
memoirs of Agrippina, Nero’s mother (
Ann.
iv. 53); and
of Domitius Corbulo on his campaigns in Parthia (
Ann.

xv. 16). He also refers by name to several historians,
especially in dealing with the times after Nero, as C.
Plinius (
Ann.
i. 69, quoted
p. 284
), Vipstanus Messalla
(
H.
iii. 25), Fabius Rusticus,
[114]
and Cluvius Rufus
[115]
(
Ann.

xiii. 20).

Other writers are sparingly mentioned, as Sisenna (
H.

iii. 51), Caesar (
Germ.
28). It is certain that Tacitus made
use of other historians, but he generally refers to his sources
without mentioning names (as
Ann.
i. 29, ‘tradunt plerique’).
He sometimes weighs the value of two conflicting accounts,
or mentions a story only to reject it.

Ann.
iv. 11, ‘Haec vulgo iactata, super id quod nullo
auctore certo firmantur, prompte refutaveris.’

Tacitus’ credibility has been attacked, particularly as
regards his representation of the characters of Tiberius and
Nero, but not very successfully. He has, however, made
mistakes, the most striking of which are his view of the
Christians (
Ann.
xv. 44) and his account of the Jews
(
H.
v. 2
sqq.
). The explanation is that he held the view
current in the upper classes, and did not take the trouble
to investigate these matters, as the Jews and Christians
belonged mostly to the lower orders.

Tacitus is not free from superstition (
Ann.
xi. 21;
H.

ii. 50, etc.), but one must not suppose he believes the
fables he relates (as
Ann.
vi. 28;
H.
iv. 83) simply because
he expresses no opinion of them.

Tacitus is free from party spirit (
Ann.
i. 1, ‘sine ira et
studio, quorum causas procul habeo’; cf.
H.
i. 1) and just
in his judgment, except in a few passages in the
Histories
,
where he is rather unfair (i. 42, ii. 95). He is milder in
the
Annals
through advancing years, and from the better
times he lived in. Generally he takes a lenient view of
things, except (1) in offences against the state (cf. the
character of Tiberius); (2) when the religious element
comes in; cf. what he says of Claudius’ marriage with
his brother’s daughter Agrippina:
Ann.
xiv. 2, ‘Agrippina
... exercita ad omne flagitium patrui nuptiis.’

He shows a somewhat lax morality occasionally, as in

Ann.
xiii. 17
sqq.
, when speaking of Nero’s murder of his
brother Britannicus. In
Ann.
xi. 19 he approves of compassing a barbarian’s death by treachery.

For Tacitus’ conception of history as dealing with great
events cf.
Ann.
xiii. 31, ‘pauca memoria digna evenere,
nisi cui libeat laudandis fundamentis et trabibus, quis
molem amphitheatri apud campum Martis Caesar extruxerat,
volumina implere, cum ex dignitate populi Romani
repertum sit res inlustres annalibus, talia diurnis urbis actis
mandare.’

His complaints as to his subject-matter in
Ann.
iv. 32,
‘Nobis in arto et inglorius labor,’ must not be taken too
seriously.

SUETONIUS.

(1) LIFE.

C. Suetonius Tranquillus was the son of Suetonius Laetus,
a tribune of the thirteenth legion, who took part in the
battle of Bedriacum,
A.D.
69 (Sueton.
Otho
, 10). His birth
seems to have taken place soon after that year,
[116]
for he
was ‘adulescens’ twenty years after Nero’s death;
Nero
57,
‘cum post viginti annos, adulescente me, exstitisset condicionis incertae qui se Neronem esse iactaret.’

Suetonius was a friend of the younger Pliny, to whom
he was indebted for a military tribuneship, which he afterwards passed on to a relative (Plin.
Ep.
iii. 8), and for
assistance in the purchase of a small estate (ibid. i. 24).
Pliny encouraged him to publish some of his writings
(v. 10), and obtained for him from Trajan the
ius trium
liberorum
(
ad Trai.
94).

Under Hadrian he was
magister epistularum
, but was
dismissed from office in
A.D.
121. Spartianus,
Hadr.
11, 3,
‘Septicio Claro praefecto praetorio et Suetonio Tranquillo
epistularum magistro multisque aliis, quod apud Sabinam
uxorem in usu eius familiarius se tunc egerant quam reverentia
domus aulicae postulabat, successores dedit.’ The
remainder of his life appears to have been devoted to
literature.

(2) WORKS.

1.
De Vita Caesarum
, in eight Books (Books i.-vi. Iulius-Nero;
vii. Galba, Otho, and Vitellius; viii. Vespasian,
Titus, and Domitian). It was published
A.D.
119-21, as it
was dedicated (according to Joannes Lydus) to C. Septicius
Clarus, praetorian prefect, who held office during those
years. The preface and the beginning of the life of Iulius
are wanting. Suetonius is a conscientious and accurate
writer (cf. his discussion of Caligula’s birthplace,
Calig.
8),
and he makes use of good sources, e.g. the
Monumentum
Ancyranum
,
Acta populi
,
Acta senatus
, autograph documents
of the emperors (
Aug.
87,
Nero
52); but there is in his
work an almost entire absence of dates, and the personal
element is, from the point of view of history, unduly
prominent.

De Viris Illustribus
, including poets, orators (beginning
with Cicero), historians (from Sallust onwards), philosophers,
grammarians, and rhetoricians. The greater part of the
section
De grammaticis et rhetoribus
is extant, as well as
lives of Terence, Horace, and Lucan from the section
de
poetis
, and of Pliny the elder from the section
de historicis
.
Extracts from the rest of the work are preserved by Jerome.
In each section there was (1) a list of the authors discussed,
(2) a general survey of their branch of literature,
(3) brief notices of the authors in chronological order. The
publication took place, according to Roth, 106-113
A.D.

3. Minor works, now lost (mentioned by Suidas), on
Greek games, Roman games, the Roman year, on critical
marks, on Cicero’s
Republic
, on dress, on imprecations
(

), on
Roman laws and customs. Some of these were probably
only sections of the

which also treated of natural science and philology. The
books on Greek games and on imprecations were almost
certainly composed in Greek.

APPENDIX A

ON SOME OF THE CHIEF ANCIENT AUTHORITIES
FOR THE HISTORY OF ROMAN LITERATURE.

1.
Jerome
[117]

(
Hieronymus
) was born about
A.D.
335 at
Stridon, on the frontiers of Dalmatia and Pannonia, and died

A.D.
420 at the monastery of Bethlehem. His contributions
to the history of Roman literature are to be found in his
translation of the Chronicle (
ÏÏÎ¿Î½Î¹ÎºÎ¿á½¶ ÎºÎ±Î½ÏÎ½ÎµÏ
) of Eusebius, in
which the dates are reckoned from the first year of Abraham
(=
B.C.
2016 according to his chronology), the point at which
Eusebius commenced. On the period between the Trojan War
and
A.D.
325 Jerome not merely translated the remarks of
Eusebius, as he had done in the earlier period, but also added
numerous extracts from authorities on Roman history and
literature. The source from which he derived nearly all his
information on literature is universally admitted to have been
the work of Suetonius
De Viris Illustribus
. With the statements
in the surviving sections of that treatise the observations
of Jerome agree, and there can be no reasonable doubt that
he made a similar use of the parts no longer extant. It is a
significant fact that the important authors on whom Jerome
is silent,
e.g.
Tacitus, Juvenal, and the younger Pliny, are
precisely those whom Suetonius, as a contemporary, naturally
could not discuss.

The statements of Jerome, based as they are on the high
authority of Suetonius, may be regarded as in the main trustworthy.
Some of them, however, are doubtful, and others
manifestly wrong.

(
a
) Jerome’s plan obliged him to fix every event to a definite
year; and this, in many cases, can only be guess-work, for
Suetonius, as may be seen from his extant writings, was often
vague in his chronology.

(
b
) Comparison with the remains of Suetonius shows that
Jerome’s claim to have made his extracts with care was not
always well grounded;
e.g.
his statement that Ennius was a
native of Tarentum (see
p. 27
).

(
c
) In reckoning, according to his system of dates, events
dated by one of the many confusing systems of chronology
current in ancient times, many openings for error presented
themselves;
e.g.
he sometimes erred through confusing consuls
of the same or similar names, as in the case of Lucilius
(
p. 59
); or through confusing similar events, as in the case
of Livius Andronicus, although the mistake about the latter
was of long standing (
p. 2
). Once at least he seems to
have confused the date of an author’s
floruit
and that of his
death, making Plautus die in
B.C.
200 instead of
B.C.
184
(
p. 8
).

2.
Aulus Gellius
[118]
was born probably about
A.D.
123, and
studied under the most eminent teachers both at Rome and
at Athens. Of his subsequent life nothing is known except
that he held some judicial post at Rome. His work, the

Noctes Atticae
in twenty Books (of Book viii. only the headings
of chapters are preserved), is a miscellany of information on
philology, philosophy, rhetoric, history, biography, literary
criticism, natural science, and antiquities. The title is due to
the fact that the book was commenced in the winter evenings
during the author’s residence at Athens. The arrangement of
the contents simply follows the haphazard order of the notes
which Gellius made in the course of his reading of Greek and
Roman authors. Those authors, and the conversation of contemporaries,
are Gellius’ professed sources, but in some cases
the author he names is evidently quoted at second-hand, and
many of the conversations are doubtless quite imaginary. Our
obligations to Gellius are twofold.

(
a
) Innumerable extracts from ancient authors are preserved
by him alone. (No quotations are given from post-Augustan
writers—a fact which accords with the affected archaism of
his style.)

(
b
) His remarks on incidents in the lives of the Roman poets
are in the main derived from Varro, whose work
De Poetis

is quoted for the epitaph of Plautus (see
p. 9
); elsewhere
his source is indicated either vaguely or not at all, e.g. iii. 3, 15,
‘accepimus’; xii. 4, 5, ‘ferunt.’ For literary criticism Varro is
quoted: iii. 3, 9,
sqq.
; vi. 14, 6 (see
pp. 10
,
51
).

3.
Nonius Marcellus
,
[119]
a Peripatetic, of Thubursicum in
Numidia, is identified by Mommsen with the Nonius Marcellus
Herculius of
C.I.L.
viii. 4878 (date
A.D.
323); but
nothing is known of his life. His work,
De Compendiosa
Doctrina ad Filium
in twenty Books (of Book xvi. the title
only is known; Book xx. is fragmentary), though modelled on
that of Gellius, is immeasurably inferior in execution. According
to the theory usually received Nonius borrowed largely
from Gellius; but it is possible that both compilers made
independent use of the same authorities, viz., scholars such as
Verrius Flaccus, Valerius Probus, and Suetonius, whose works
they knew either directly or through abridgments. The subjects
with which Nonius deals are grammar, lexicography, and
antiquities; and he is often our sole authority for the titles of
works as well as for brief extracts.

4.
Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius
, doubtless identical
with the Macrobius who held, among other high offices, the
proconsulship of Africa
A.D.
410, was probably, like Nonius,
of African origin. Besides his commentary on the
Somnium
Scipionis
of Cicero, Macrobius wrote a work in seven Books
on Roman literature and antiquities with the title of
Saturnalia
.
The imaginary conversations of which it consists are supposed
to take place during the festival of the Saturnalia at Rome
(hence the title); and the chief subject of discussion is the
poetry of Virgil. A remarkable feature of the book is its
wealth of quotation from Greek and Latin authors. Macrobius,
like Gellius, bases his work on extracts from older authorities;
but, unlike him, arranges his matter systematically.

5.
Aelius Donatus
, a grammarian who flourished at Rome
about
A.D.
350, and was one of Jerome’s teachers, extracted
from the lost work of Suetonius the Lives of Terence and Virgil,
and prefixed them to his own commentaries on Terence and
on the
Georgics
and
Aeneid
. The latter is lost, and the commentary
on Terence contains much that is not from the hand
of Donatus.

6.
Servius
.—There are two versions of the Servian commentary
on Virgil. The shorter is the work of Maurus Servius
Honoratus, who was born about 350
A.D.
, and lived at Rome
(Macrob.
Saturn.
i. 2, 15); his topographical references show
that he composed his commentary there. Servius, whose notes
are chiefly on the language of the poems, gives illustrative
quotations from Roman authors, in some cases from memory
and inaccurately. Donatus is the authority whom he mentions
oftenest, but he undoubtedly made extensive use of Suetonius.

The longer version contains learned additions to the work
of Servius by an anonymous Christian writer, who deals mainly
with the subject-matter of Virgil.

7.
Acro
and
Porphyrio
.—Helenius Acro (probably about
200
A.D.
) was the author of commentaries on Horace and
Terence, now lost. The scholia on Horace extant under
Acro’s name are, with few exceptions, taken from the commentary
of Pomponius Porphyrio, which we possess in a
mutilated form. Porphyrio, who probably belonged to the
4th cent.
A.D.
, names among his sources Acro and Suetonius.

GLASGOW: PRINTED AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS BY ROBERT MACLEHOSE AND CO.

Footnotes

[1]
The scheme of this old national metre, which depends on accent
and not on quantity, may be seen from the two examples given below.
Various forms are found, but one of the commonest types is identical
with the rhythm of the nursery rhyme,

‘The queen was in the parlour, eating bread and honey.’

[2]
‘I have heard that a Roman poet is languishing in prison with
head on hand’—probably a metaphor from a pillar (but the sense is far from certain).

[3]
Utica was besieged by Scipio from 204 to 202
B.C.

[4]
In the
fabula togata
or
tabernaria
the surroundings of the comedy
were Roman, in the
fabula palliata
Greek, as in Plautus’ plays.

Togata
in a wider sense included tragedy as well as comedy.

[5]
This term means the construction of a new play by uniting two
old ones.

[6]
The references are to the revised edition of Ritschl.

[7]
A species of burlesque tragedy, called after its inventor Rhinthon, who flourished
B.C.
300.

[8]

R.H.
ii. p. 431 trans.

[9]
This shows that the ancient (rough alphabetical) order has been
departed from. Some grammarian of the fifth century altered the
position of the play on account of the reference to it in
Epid.
213-5
(quoted above).

[10]
I.e. the ‘Patruus’ written by the old Roman (lit., ‘son of the
porridge-eater’).

[11]
These games were celebrated in April. Plays were exhibited also
at the
Ludi Romani
(September) and the
Ludi Plebei
(November).

[12]
Much of the information on this head is taken from J. Brix’s edition
of the
Trinummus
. Leipzig, 1888.

[13]
This is shown in the universal classical usage of
benÄ
,
malÄ
, etc.

[14]
The references are to Vahlen’s edition.

[15]
Thus the original name of Beneventum was Maleventum, i.e.

ÎÎ±Î»ÏÏÎµÎ½ÏÎ±
, accusative of
ÎÎ±Î»ÏÏÎµÎ¹Ï
; cf. Agrigentum from
á¼ÎºÏÎ¬Î³Î±Ï
,
and Tarentum from
Î¤Î¬ÏÎ±Ï
.

[16]
Euhemerus of Messana, who wrote about the end of the fourth
century
B.C.
, tried in this work to show that the worship of the gods
arose from the worship of deified kings and heroes.

[17]
The Oscan form of
Pacuvi
.

[18]
The term
doctus
refers to his knowledge of the Greek laws of
artistic composition.

[19]
After Ambivius’ name appears in most of the didascaliae ‘L. Hatilius
Praenestinus.’ Probably this person was an actor at some later
productions, and his name has in this way crept into the
MSS.

[20]

Tibiae
were called
pares
or
impares
according as they were or
were not of the same length and key.
Duae dextrae
were two pipes
both playing the treble.
Tibiae Sarranae
, from Sarra, the old Latin
name for Tyre, were a special form of
tibiae pares
.

[21]

Mediocritas
=
Ïá½¸ Î¼Î­ÏÎ¿Î½
, the intermediate style between
Ïá½¸ á¼Î´ÏÏÎ½
,
‘the florid’ (
ubertas
), and
Ïá½¸ á¼°ÏÏÎ½ÏÎ½
, ‘the simple’ (
gracilitas
). See
W. Peterson’s note on Quint. x. 1, 44.

[22]
For the omission of names, cf. iv. 12 (Jordan), ‘dictatorem Karthaginiensium
magister equitum monuit’ (of Hannibal and Maharbal).

[23]
This means that Lucilius would represent the nom. plu. by
-ei
and
the gen. sing, by
-i
.

[24]
The
fabula Atellana
was a species of farce adopted by the Romans
from the Oscan town of Atella in Campania. See Livy, vii. 2, for
this and the early history of the Roman drama.

[25]
Q. Hortensius Hortalus (
B.C.
114-50), Cicero’s rival as an orator,
and author of
Annales
(Vell. ii. 16, 3), a
Rhetoric
(Quint. ii. 1, 11),
and love poems (Ovid
Tr.
ii. 441).

[26]
According to
ad Att.
ii. 1, 3 (if genuine), Cicero intended to publish
speeches 9-11 in a collection of ‘orationes consulares’ (‘Hoc totum

Ïá¿¶Î¼Î±
curabo ut habeas’).

[27]

R.H.
iv. 311 (note).

[28]
Q. Asconius Pedianus (
A.D.
3-88), probably a native of Padua,
author of a commentary on Cicero’s speeches. The extant part is on

Pro Cornelio de maiestate
,
In toga candida
,
In Pisonem
,

Pro Scauro
,
and
Pro Milone
. The commentary on the Verrines and Divinatio,
which deals almost exclusively with the language, is spurious: the
true Asconius confines himself to the subject-matter.

[29]
The Epicurean philosophy was expounded in the writings of C.
Amafinius, Rabirius, and T. Catius, whose opinions and literary style
were alike distasteful to Cicero (
Ac.
i. 5;
ad. Fam.
xv. 19, 2).

[30]
F. Ritschl,
Opuscula
, iii., p. 525.

[31]
L. Schwabe,
Quaest. Catull.
, p. 296. B. Schmidt, however (ed.
of Catullus, p. 57), thinks that the
Chronica
are not referred to here.

[32]
A life of Lucretius has been recently discovered by J. Masson
(
Journal of Philology
, xxiii. 46), which was written by Girolamo
Borgia in 1502. It gives
B.C.
95-51 as the poet’s dates. Several
new points were supposed to lend it a claim to authority, such as
the statement that he was ‘matre natus diu sterili.’ This, however,
has been shown to rest on a wrong reading of Q. Serenus Sammonicus’
Liber Medicinalis
, xxxii., in a passage dealing with the
barrenness of women, ‘hoc poterit magni quartus [liber] monstrare
Lucreti,’ where
partus
, the reading of the oldest edition, was used.
This, and other considerations, show that the
vita
does not rest on
any ancient sources, beyond those which are still extant.

[33]
Memmius wrote love poems (Ovid,
Tr.
ii. 433).

[34]
Some ascribe these stories to Lenaeus, a freedman of Pompey,
Sueton.
Gramm.
15.

[35]
Only inferior
MSS.
give Q., and the reading in c. 67, 12, ‘verum
istud populi, fabula, Quinte, facit,’ is not to be accepted.

[36]
Some critics, without sufficient proof, identify Volusius with the
inferior poet Tanusius Geminus.

[37]
Martial, of course, has here forgotten his dates.

[38]
The incident has been borrowed from Plutarch by Shakespeare,

Julius Caesar
, Act iii. Scene 3.

[39]
See
p. 184
.

[40]
This appears to us to be an indirect proof that the half lines in
Virgil are often complete as they stand.

[41]
M. Valerius Probus of Berytus (Sueton.
Gramm.
24) who flourished,
according to Jerome,
A.D.
56, prepared critical editions of Lucretius,
Virgil, and Horace. A commentary on the
Eclogues
and
Georgics

passes under his name, but most of it is spurious.

[42]
A grammarian of the fifth century
A.D.
, who merely versifies
Donatus.

[43]
On this point Professor W. M. Ramsay writes to us: ‘Virgil’s
farm was certainly not at Pietole (which is two miles south of Mantua,
out in the flat plain): for (1) the farm was a long way from the city
(cf.
Ecl.
9, 59
sqq.
); (2) it was beside hills (
ibid.
7
sqq.
); (3) woods
were on or by it (cf. Donatus “silvis coemendis”), and the flat fertile
valley was certainly not abandoned to forests. After exploring the
country, I felt clear that the farm was on the west bank of the Mincio,
opposite Valeggio, where the northern hills sink to the dead level
of the Po valley.’

[44]
His knowledge of science is reflected in his works. Cf.
Georgics
,
passim, and
Ecl.
3, ll. 40-2.

[45]
The latter part of this statement is worthless: Augustus was only
a child when Virgil came to Rome.

[46]
Probus is manifestly wrong in saying that the distribution of land
took place ‘post
Mutinense
bellum.’

[47]
For details see H. Nettleship,
Ancient Lives of Vergil
, who holds
that there was really only one eviction.

[48]
The writings of Augustus are enumerated by Sueton. Aug. 85—
(1)
Rescripta Bruto de Catone
, a reply to Brutus’ pamphlet on Cato;
(2)
Hortationes ad Philosophiam
; (3)
De Vita Sua
; (4) Life of Drusus
(Sueton.
Claud.
1); (5) Poems: ‘Sicily’ in hexameters, Epigrams
and Fescennine verses; a tragedy, ‘Ajax’ (never finished).

[49]
Servius wrote ‘triennio’ perhaps because he thought only of the
dates of
Ecl.
1 and 10 (H. Nettleship,
ibid.
).

[50]
C. Schaper’s view is that
Ecls.
4, 6, and 10 were not written till

B.C.
27-25 for a second edition. He supposes
Ecl.
6 to allude to the
marriage of Marcellus and Julia in 25 (referring 6, 3 to the
Aeneid
),
and
Ecl.
10 to be a lament for Gallus, who committed suicide

B.C.
27.

[51]
Iulus is properly spelt Iullus (as in inscriptions), and is for Iovillos,
a diminutive from the stem of Iuppiter.

[52]
L. Orbilius Pupillus of Beneventum, who in his
Î ÎµÏÎ¹Î±Î»Î³Î®Ï
complained
of the wrongs of his profession (Sueton.
Gramm.
4 and 9).

[53]
Maecenas wrote, besides smaller prose works, a history of his own
times (Hor.
Od.
ii. 12, 9; Pliny,
N.H.
vii. 148).

[54]
For Horace’s relations to Propertius see
Ep.
ii. 2, 91-101, and under
‘
Propertius
,’
p. 196
.

[55]
See G. Boissier,
Nouvelles Promenades ArchÃ©ologiques: Horace et
Virgile
(Paris, 1886).

[56]
Dr. A. W. Verrall’s argument (
Studies in Horace
, pp. 25
sqq.
) that

Od.
i.-iii. were published
B.C.
19 is not convincing.

[57]
Ed. by Mommsen in
Ephemeris Epigraphica
, 1892, p. 225.

[58]
For Horace’s eclectic position in philosophy, cf.
Ep.
i. 1, 14-15,

‘Nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri,

quo me cumque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes.’

[59]
As suggested to us by Prof. W. M. Ramsay. For Horace’s
opinion of Catullus cf.
Sat.
i. 10, 18-9,

‘Simius iste,

nil praeter Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum.’

Tacitus does not say openly that Seneca was privy to the murder.
On the whole he is favourable to Seneca, either because he followed
the authority of Fabius Rusticus, a friend of Seneca, or because
Seneca perished afterwards through Nero’s agency, or because he
thought Seneca deserved his consideration.

[76]
Seneca’s influence on the Imperial policy, especially in the liberal
view it took regarding religion, is well brought out by Prof. W. M. Ramsay,
in his book,
St. Paul the Traveller and the Roman
Citizen

[92]
A passage probably inserted by the pseudo-Frontinus from memoirs
of the genuine Frontinus to give an air of authenticity to his work.

[93]
J. DÃ¼rr,
Das Leben Juvenals
(Ulm, 1888). L. FriedlÃ¤nder (ed. of
Juvenal: Leipzig, 1895) attaches little importance to this and the other

vitae
, but his arguments do not appear to us to be convincing.

[94]
E. G. Hardy (ed. of Juvenal: London, 1891, introd. p. 8) thinks
that this is supported by Juvenal’s gentile name Iunius. As a representative
of the middle classes he (thinks Hardy) could not have
been related by blood to either of the two
gentes
of that name.
Hardy also states that Decimus is a common
praenomen
of the
plebeian
gens Iunia
, and suggests that Juvenal may have got his

praenomen
from them. There is no reason, however, to think that
every Iunius must be related or associated in some way with one
of these two
gentes
.

[95]
The statement of the
vitae
, ‘ad mediam fere aetatem declamavit,’
may imply no more than that he continued his studies in private;
but it must be observed that the usual meaning of
declamare
is ‘to
attend college classes’; and the statement, in whatever way it is
taken, must be looked upon as improbable.

[96]
If the number I. is right, and this appears most likely. II. is
the only other possible reading, and it must be noted that the second
Dalmatian cohort was in Britain at the beginning of the second century,
and probably had been there for a considerable time.
Trib.
in the
inscription is a conjecture suggested by the
vitae
:
praef.
, which is
epigraphically possible, is preferred by some authorities.

[97]
E. G. Hardy thinks that
A.D.
87 was one of the years when

duumviri quinquennales
(appointed every five years) were elected in
Aquinum, and hypothetically assigns Juvenal’s holding of the post to
that year.

The reference in 4, 126, ‘De temone Britanno excidet Arviragus,’
proves nothing. It is the sort of reference that would be made by
an Italian ignorant of Britain, and is, in fact, put into the mouth of
one.

[102]
The view that
Sat.
i. 33
sqq.
refers to M. Aquilius Regulus, who
died probably
A.D.

H. Nettleship (
Journal of Philology
, xvi., p. 45) points out that
C. Vipstanus Apronianus and C. Fonteius Capito were consuls
A.D.
59,
and suggests that this may be the year meant. This would give
A.D.
119
as the date of composition.

[104]
The scholiast connects with 4, 37-8.

[105]
This story is rejected both by Hardy and by FriedlÃ¤nder.

[106]
Juvenal had a leaning to Stoicism: cf.
Sat.
10
ad fin.
, and his
references to fate,
e.g.
7, 200; 10, 365; 12, 63. He believes in the
gods (13, 247-9), but disbelieves the doctrines of the popular religion
(2, 149
sqq.
).

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

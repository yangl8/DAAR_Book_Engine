STATEMENT OF FACTS.

The statements in the pamphlet published by this Society during
the last year, had reference principally, to the establishment and prosperity
of the Colony at Liberia. It is proposed to exhibit in the following
pages some facts relative to the present condition of the colored
population in the United States, and to offer some remarks on the
different measures recommended for their relief.

The facts to be presented, have all been derived from official documents,
or from special correspondence with intelligent and responsible
gentlemen in various parts of the country, and may be relied upon as
substantially correct.

SLAVES.

The first presentation of facts is designed to show the condition of the

slaves
in the United States, and will have respect to the following topics.
(1.) Their population and increase. (2.) Their civil disabilities.
(3.) Their intellectual and moral condition.

I.
Population and Increase of the Slaves in the United States.

The following table is designed to show the population and increase
of the Slaves in the United States since 1820. The first column gives
the name of the state; the second, the census of 1820; the third, the
census of 1830; the fourth, the increase of the slaves during the intervening
ten years; the fifth, the rate per cent. of slave increase; and
the sixth, the rate per cent. increase of the whites.

The above table was compiled from Nilesâ Register for January 26th,
1822, page 345, and for October 29th, 1831, page 176. The blanks
in the fourth column show that instead of an increase, there was an
actual diminution of slaves during the ten years comprised in the table.
The diminution in Maryland was 4,520, and in the District of Columbia
313. In some others they have nearly disappeared. It appears however
from the table, that in the Southern States, particularly those
south of Virginia, there has been an astonishing increase of slaves.
In some of the States it has surpassed the increase of the whites by
forty, fifty, and even an hundred and fifty per cent. In Arkansas the
increase of the slave population has surpassed the white by 166 per
cent.

The following table shows the relative strength of the white and
black population in the slave holding states, at the close of each successive
10 years, to the end of the present century, supposing the rate of
increase to continue as it has been during the last ten. The table
is taken from calculations made during the year by the Hon. Daniel
Mayes, of Kentucky.

From the above table it appears that in 1900, should nothing take
place to diminish the increase of blacks in the slave-holding states, they
will exceed the whites by 4,741,166—being an amount greater than the
population of all the United States under Washingtonâs administration.

II.
Civil Disabilities of the Slaves.

The following statements have been taken principally from
Stroudâs

Sketch
of the Laws relative to slavery in the United States. They
may be regarded as corollaries from the
general law
concerning the
slaves, and also as matters of express legislation.

1. Slaves have no legal rights of property in things real or personal;
but whatever they may acquire, belongs in
point of law
to their masters.
(The bearing of this on the purchase of freedom is obvious.)

2. The slave, being a
personal chattel
, is at all times liable to be sold
absolutely, or mortgaged or leased at the will of his master.

3. He may also be sold by process of law, for the satisfaction of the
debts of a living, or the bequests of a deceased master, at the suit of
creditors or legatees.

4. A slave cannot be a party, before a judicial tribunal, in any
species of action, against his master, whatever may have been the
injury received from him.

5. Slaves cannot redeem themselves, nor obtain a change of masters.

6. Slaves being objects of
property
if injured by third persons, their
owners may bring suit, and recover damages, for the injury.

7. Slaves can make no contract.

8. Slavery is hereditary and perpetual.

5

It may also be further stated concerning the disabilities of the
slave,

1. That he cannot be a witness against a white person, either in a
civil or criminal cause.

2. He cannot be a party to a civil suit.

3. Submission is required of the slave, not to the will of his master
only, but to that of all other white persons.

4. The penal codes of the slave holding states bear much more
severely upon the slaves than upon the white persons,—taking the
life of the slave, where a slight punishment only is inflicted upon the
whites.

5. Slaves are prosecuted and tried upon criminal accusations, in many
of the states, without a jury.

The condition of the slave, as regards emancipation, is peculiarly distressing.

The state of society in the slave holding states, and legislative enactments,
have rendered it nearly impossible for any master to emancipate
his slave.

In Virginia and Mississippi, an emancipated slave may be taken in
execution to satisfy any debt, contracted by the person emancipating
him, previous to such emancipation.

In Kentucky, the Act which authorises emancipation, contains a
reservation of the rights of creditors.

In Louisiana, any enfranchisement made in
fraud of creditors
, &c.
is null and void.

In South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, it is only by
authority of the Legislature, specially granted, that a valid emancipation
can be made.

In North Carolina it was enacted in 1777, that no negro or mulatto
slave shall be hereafter set free, except for
meritorious service to be adjudged
of and allowed by the County Court
, and license first had and
obtained thereupon.

The laws of Kentucky, Missouri, Virginia and Maryland, afford
greater facility to emancipation than the other slave holding states. In
Virginia, however, there is a provision by which every emancipated
negro, over twenty one years of age, who shall continue within the state
more than twelve months after his right to freedom shall have accrued,
may be again reduced to slavery.

In order to secure the slave holding states in the use and possession
of their property in the persons of slaves, and to prevent all escape of
slaves from their masters, the constitution of the United States provides,
âThat no person held to service or labor in one state, under the
laws thereof,
escaping
into another, shall, in consequence of any law or
regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall
be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor
may be due.â

III.
Intellectual and Moral Condition of the Slaves.

The benefits of education are withheld from the slave.

No provisions are made in any of the slave states for the education of
the slaves, and in many they have absolutely prohibited instruction of
any kind.

6

So long ago as 1740, South Carolina enacted, âThat all, and every
person and persons whatever, who shall hereafter teach, or cause any
slave or slaves to be taught, to write, or shall use or employ any slave as
a scribe in any manner of writing whatsoever hereafter taught, to write,
every such person or persons, shall, for every such offence forfeit the
sum of one hundred pounds current money.â This prohibition has since
been extended to all kinds of knowledge, and enforced by pains and
penalties much more severe. The same is true in Georgia, Alabama
and Louisiana. Virginia and North Carolina, also, have laws which
amount to a prohibition of instruction.

No provision is made for the moral and religious instruction of the
slave. Public sentiment is generally unfavorable, although believed to
be becoming more favorable to the spiritual interests of the slave. Many
regard the slaves as incapable of religious exercises, and therefore consider
all efforts to give them religious instruction unnecessary. Since
they may not be taught to read, they cannot become acquainted with the
Scriptures, except as auditors; their opportunities for hearing are so
few and unfavorable, that they can never be expected to profit by them.
In many of the slave states, they are forbidden to assemble by themselves
for the purpose of religious worship. In Virginia, âAll meetings
of slaves, &c. at any
meeting house
in the night, under any pretext
whatsoever, are declared to be unlawful assemblies. Mississippi has
adopted the law of Virginia in this respect. In Alabama they are not
permitted to assemble by themselves for worship at all, nor to have a
white minister preach to them unless three slave holders are present.
Similar laws exist in several other states.

CONDITION OF THE FREE BLACKS.

The following statements have respect to the present condition of the
free blacks in the United States. They are all derived from authentic
sources, and may be relied upon as substantially correct.

I.
Population and Increase of the Free Blacks.

In the following tabular view, which is taken from the census of 1830,
and that of 1820, the first column gives the name of the State; the second,
the aggregate of the free colored population; and the third, the
increase of the same, during the ten years which intervened between
1820 and 1830.

By this table it appears that the total number of free blacks in 1830,
was 319,599. The number in 1820 was, according to Nilesâs Register,
233,398, yielding an increase during the intervening ten years, of
86,201. This last statement will be found to vary a little from the
sum total of the third column above, owing to discrepancies in the published
documents. Blanks are left in the third column opposite to
New Hampshire and Vermont, as in those states the numbers, instead
of increasing, actually
diminished
. In the latter state they diminished
37, and in the former, 182. Some tables make the diminution in New
Hampshire amount to 321. It is worthy of particular inquiry to ascertain
the causes of this rapid diminution. It will be perceived that the
progress of this population in the middle and some of the southern
states, is very rapid, compared with its increase in New England. This
is to be attributed to the progress of emancipation. For instance, in
New York there were more than 10,000 slaves in 1820, which number
was reduced in 1830 to 75. The increase of free blacks in Maryland,
and Virginia, is to be attributed partly to the same cause. Their
very small increase in the New England States, while the whites are
gaining very rapidly, forcibly illustrates the misery of their condition.

II.
Civil Disabilities.

Under this head are to be comprised all those disabilities which attach
to free colored persons by the laws of the several states.

1. The most extensive and universal disability (by many, however,
considered a privilege) regards the militia. The laws of the
several states relating to the militia, being founded upon the militia
system adopted by the United States, provide for the exemption of colored
persons from that service. With this exception the laws of many of
the states recognise no distinctions of color.

2. The right of suffrage is confined to whites in Rhode Island,
Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, South
Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois,
and Missouri. In these states express provisions of their constitutions
confine the right of suffrage to the whites. In the ten remaining
states no constitutional restrictions of the kind appear to have been imposed
upon free colored persons. Yet, it is believed, that the statute
laws of North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee, impose similar restrictions.
In most of the remaining states, it is probable that the
right of suffrage is rarely, if ever, exercised by this class of citizens, although
no law may exist which disfranchises them. The burdens of
taxation are, so far as known, imposed without the discrimination
which prevails in regard to the right of suffrage. In Philadelphia, and
perhaps in other places in Pennsylvania, no personal tax is imposed, the
payment of such a tax being necessary to qualify for the right of suffrage.

3. In many of the States free colored persons are excluded by law
from the privilege of holding office; and where this is not the case, the
presumption is that in those states where they are not allowed to vote,
they would not be allowed to govern. It is not known that any such
person has ever been elected to office, even in those states where the
right of suffrage is extended to them.

8

4. In a few of the states only, are there any laws expressly forbidding
intermarriage between the blacks and the whites.

5. Free persons of color are, in most of the states, allowed to purchase
and hold property, real and personal, and mixed, and are entitled
to the same protection in its enjoyment, and the same redress for
injuries to it or to their persons, as the white citizens. In some states,
however, the tenure of their property is very insecure without a white
guardian, as they are not allowed to testify against the whites, or in
cases where a white man is party.

6. As to privileges in courts of justice, in Missouri, free colored persons
can testify only in suits between free blacks, and on trials of free blacks
for crime. The laws of Alabama are of similar import. In Delaware
they cannot give evidence against a white person, except in criminal
prosecutions, upon its appearing that no white person, competent to give
testimony, was present at the commission of the act charged, or that
such person, if so present, has since died, or is absent from the state
so that he cannot be produced as a witness. In Maryland, they
may be witnesses only for and against their own color. Such is the
case in Ohio, Georgia, and probably in most of the slave-holding states.
In most of the free states it is presumed that the testimony of blacks is
received on an equal footing with that of the whites.

In many of the states the laws expressly exclude them from being
impanelled as jurors; and, so far as known, they have never served in
that capacity in any of the states.

7. In the New England and Middle States, the blacks enjoy the
same rights of residence, and of emigration from one state to another,
which belong to the whites. In Connecticut a law is in force which
empowers the proper authorities to prevent
foreigners
, (citizens from
other states or of other countries) from residing in that state, but it is
not discriminating in its application to any particular color. The black
is not permitted to settle in Ohio, except he give bonds, to secure the
state against any expense which he may incur by becoming a pauper;
nor is any one permitted to employ such an emigrant without giving
similar bonds. Laws are in force in Maryland forbidding those who
shall leave the state from returning to it. Similar laws exist in South
Carolina. No free blacks are allowed to go into Georgia, and none to
reside in it except those who have long been resident. In Delaware,
none are allowed to enter the state, but the law is very rarely enforced.
They are allowed to reside in Alabama by paying a tax of five dollars.
They are not permitted to go into the state from other states on any
condition; nor, having left the state, can they return. Laws of similar
character are in force in Louisiana, Tennessee, and probably some
other states.

8. In New England and the Middle States, (a late law in Connecticut
excepted) there appears to be no distinction made by law, with
reference to the privileges of education or religious worship, between
the blacks and the whites. In all these states, and in Missouri, Maryland,
Delaware and Ohio, they are allowed by law, not only to send
their children to the public schools, but to establish schools for themselves
exclusively. Many such schools are patronized by the benevolent
friends of the race among the whites. By a late law of Ohio, they
cannot receive any benefit from the public school funds. In Alabama,
they may not attend schools or have instruction among themselves. A

9

prohibitory law, passed in Georgia, about eighteen months since, debars
them from all the privileges of school education in that state. They
may however be taught the catechism, or such moral lessons and portions
of Scripture as they can commit to memory. With respect to
other states no definite information has been received. In Connecticut
a law has recently been passed forbidding the establishment of
schools for the education of colored children from other states.

III.
Intellectual and Moral Condition of the Free Blacks.

It is to be feared that the statements now to be made will meet with an
ungracious reception among a certain portion of the community. As a
powerful means of enlisting public sympathy in behalf of the African
race, the advocates of the Society have sometimes entered into an exposition
of such facts as would most accurately unfold their intellectual
and moral condition. Accordingly, those who oppose the Society have
attempted to show that it is the âdisparager of the free blacks.â

It were, however, wholly impracticable to arouse public sympathy,
either where no suffering or degradation exists, or where their existence
is unknown. All benevolent operations must proceed upon the supposition
that there is want to be alleviated, or ignorance to be enlightened,
or degradation to be pitied; and the vigor with which such operations
are sustained by the benevolent will be proportioned, not so much
to the degree of this want, ignorance and degradation, as to their
thorough and perfect exposure. The Colonization Society is not singular
in its proceedings. In whatsoever sense this society is the âdisparager
of the free blacks,â in the same sense are the Bible and Tract
Societies the âdisparagersâ of those to whom they extend their benevolence.
In the same sense also, and to a higher degree, is the Foreign
Missionary Board the âdisparagerâ of the Heathen. Were that society
to deny or to conceal the deep degradation and licentiousness of the
American Indians, and of the Pagan world generally, it is difficult to
conceive with what arguments they could successfully approach the
sympathies of their patrons.

Thus, in the case under consideration, it is equally true, that all
attempts to provide for the relief of the free black and slave population
of the country, must prove abortive if unattended by facts and statements
relative to their actual condition. It would not be difficult to
show that the same society, from whose advocates the complaint in
question is heard, in its statements and arguments touching the situation
of the slaves, is as truly
their
disparager as is the Colonization Society
the âdisparager of the free blacks.â

The statements which follow are called for by the necessity of the
case. They are not made in a spirit of taunt, or reproach, or boasted
superiority, but with the hope that they may serve to call forth that
commiseration which the cause of the deeply-injured African, when truly
stated, challenges for itself.

1.
Intellectual Condition of the Free Blacks.
Notwithstanding the
privileges of education are nominally extended to them in the New-England,
Middle, and some of the Southern and Western States, yet
the prejudice which exists against their color serves to defeat, to a
lamentable extent, the benevolent provisions of the law. In some cities
and large towns, schools are maintained expressly for them. In Philadelphia,
particularly, there are many distinct schools for colored children,

10

some of which have at different times been taught by colored tutors,
and much to their credit. âIn these schools,â says a gentleman of
that city, âwhere they have been under the superintendence of qualified
instructers, forty yearsâ experience has proved, that they are no
way inferior to the whites in the acquirement of learning.â In the
country towns of the states above referred to, the children of the blacks
are not unfrequently found in common schools with the whites. But
their situation is frequently made so uncomfortable that most of the
benefits of such attendance are lost. Still more unfrequently are they
to be found at Academies or high schools even in New-England—and
still more rarely do they find their way into Colleges. Mr. Russwurm,
now in Liberia, is a graduate of Bowdoin College. Attempts
were made some time since to establish a college exclusively for them
in New-Haven, Conn. The plan, meeting with decided opposition
from the inhabitants of that town, was finally abandoned. An attempt
has been recently made to establish a high school for colored females in
Canterbury, Conn. Vigorous and determined opposition has been
manifested towards it by the inhabitants, so that its success is still doubtful.
In many of the slave states, free blacks are not allowed to attend
school, or to learn to read or write. Many of them, however, enjoy
the benefits of sabbath school instruction, and commit to memory considerable
portions of Scripture, &c. Yet a great majority are no
doubt lamentably and grossly ignorant.

2.
Religious Privileges.
Except in large cities, where they are
found in sufficient numbers to compose congregations by themselves,
they attend public worship with the whites. But the unenviable distinctions
which prevail even there, have a powerful influence in discouraging
their attendance. In some parts of the country they enjoy
the ministrations of preachers of their own color, and large numbers
are said to be in communion with various churches.

3.
Moral Condition.
The following is an extract of a letter from a
gentleman of extensive information and philanthropy in the state of
New York. âThe fact, that out of 40,000 blacks in this state in 1825,
but nine hundred and thirty-one were taxed, and but two hundred and
ninety-eight were qualified to vote; and the further fact, that this population,
according to its amount, furnishes ten-fold more of the inmates
of our prisons and alms-houses, than our white population does, testify
conclusively to the general improvidence, indolence, and abounding
viciousness and misery of this unhappy portion of our fellow-men.â

The following tabular views, taken from the Report of the Prison
Discipline Society, for 1827, exhibit, in regard to several states, the
whole population at that time, the colored population, the whole number
of convicts, the number of colored convicts, proportion of colored people
to the whole population, and proportion of colored convicts.

The report further states, that âthe returns from several prisons
show that the white convicts are remaining nearly the same, or are diminishing,
while the colored convicts are increasing; at the same
time the white population is increasing in the northern states, much
faster than the colored population.â

In the eloquent language of Gerrit Smith, Esq., âhaving these statistics
before us, and seeing that the policy of our laws concurs with
our prejudices to debase this people, to deprive them of indispensable
inducements to well doing, and virtually to close against
them all avenues to honor and respectability,—how unphilosophical and
ungenerous it is, to look away from these sufficient causes of their vile
condition to fanciful and heartless speculations, about the inferiority of
their natural endowments. It will be time enough for white men to
accuse God of having given an inferior moral constitution to the negro,
when they shall have spent as many centuries in enlightening, as they
have in debasing him—when they shall have done as much to make
him a man, as they have done to make him a brute.â

Having now considered, to some extent, the condition of the colored
population in the United States, we come in the next place to inquire
what can be done for them.

The object of the
Colonization Society
, as expressed in its constitution,
is âexclusively to promote and execute a plan of colonizing, (with
their own consent) the free people of color residing in our country, in
Africa, or such other place as Congress shall deem expedient.â It has,
by profession and principle, nothing to do with the rights of slave-holders.
It wishes for no interference with the tenure of slaves. The society
regards these things solely as matters of legislation, and to be affected
only in a legal way. They wish, in their organized capacity, only to
remove the blacks, which are now free, and shall from time to time be
made free by their masters. In doing this, and by other exertions,
they hope, however, so to affect the interests and feelings of the slave-holders,
that they will enlist in the enterprize, and rejoice to free themselves
from all property in human flesh.

That the colonization scheme is tending to this result, and, if properly
managed, is adequate to its accomplishment, is certain from many
considerations. It cannot, indeed, accomplish the object at once. It
would be unreasonable to expect that this, or any other society or system
could, in the space of a few years, remove an evil which has been
increasing for two centuries. But if colonization can do that in less
than one half the time in which the evil has been growing to its present
size, it ought not to be accounted visionary, or unworthy of confidence.

âNow,â says the Rev. John C. Young, President of Centre College,
Kentucky, âthe systematic and efficient operation of this society could
in less than seventy years settle the whole of our colored population in
Africa; and this great work could be accomplished without the necessity
of imposing on any one a single cent of additional tax. The

12

plan of operations by which this could be effected is simple and feasible.
Let the emigration be every year enlarged by one thousand persons,
until the number annually exported amounts to 50,000. Continue the
annual exportation of this number for twenty years longer, and the
whole race will have disappeared from the land. The effect of this
process, (supposing it to be actually entered upon) is not a matter of
guess-work, but of calculation.â [See note in Youngâs Address.] It

can
certainly be done; and if the operations of the society are permitted
to go onward, and increase, as they have done, unobstructed by national
calamities, and the wildness of fanatics, it
will
be done.

But supposing all this cannot be effected through the influence of
the Colonization Society, or that it were not desirable, as many think, to
be done, yet we maintain that so much
can
be done towards meliorating
the condition of the colored population, both slaves and free, as to
merit the hearty co-operation of every Christian and philanthropist.

The present actual tendencies of the colonization scheme, so far as
abolition and the general interests of the blacks are concerned, receive
a favorable character from the following considerations, which are presented
as briefly as possible.

1. The colonization scheme exerts, and has exerted, a happy influence
toward abolition, by directing the minds of people of all classes, including
slave-owners, to the condition of the blacks. Before the plan of
colonization was agitated, nothing, comparatively, had been done to meliorate
the condition of this class, and no interest had been felt in their
behalf. But when the plan which we speak of suggested itself to a
few benevolent minds, an ardent feeling began to be roused in behalf
of the negro. Inquiries were instituted; discussion commenced; and
the public mind was excited to the calm but earnest consideration of
the momentous subject in all its bearings. But for this Institution, the
3,000 free blacks, who are now rejoicing in the land of their fathers,
under a government and laws chiefly of their own, would still be enduring
poverty and wretchedness; and the slaves who have been emancipated
would be still suffering in bondage.

Says the Hon. Gerrit Smith, in a recent letter on this subject, âThe
late demonstrations, in Virginia and Maryland, of patriotic and Christian
interest in our colored population, are commonly ascribed to the Southampton
insurrection. That insurrection may have been, and probably
was, a proximate cause of them; but, in my judgment, Virginia
and Maryland are vastly more indebted for the steps they have taken
in the cause of universal freedom to the moral influence of the American
Colonization Society than to all other causes. And, may not most
of those, who now rail at the Society, be likewise indebted to the same
influence for their fresh and augmented interest in the welfare of the
black man? The tenacious slave-holder at the south lays all the blame
of these things at the door of the Colonization Society, and this too,
notwithstanding some abolitionists charge the Society with playing designedly
into the hands of such slave-holders. And if such (he goes on
to say) be the power of those moral influences now, when Liberia has a
population of 3,000, what will it be when 50,000 of our blacks shall be
gathered into that asylum? Whether or not this shall be the result of
colonization, remains to be seen; but meanwhile it is certain that whatever
of influence is
now
exerted for the ultimate good of the blacks has
been brought into exercise by the operations of our Institution.

13

2. The Colonization Society exerts a happy influence on the interests
of the black population, by weakening the prejudice of the whites against
them. Some of the doctrines and measures advanced and pursued in
different parts of the country are, in our opinion, calculated to strengthen
this prejudice.

That the Colonization Society in its operations has a contrary effect,
appears from the circumstance that before this scheme commenced, little
or no interest was felt for the blacks, except by a few individuals.
Prejudice ground them in the dust; and, had their condition remained
unaltered, would have continued to oppress them to the end of time.
No sympathy was felt for them in their suffering and wretchedness. Indeed,
it did apparently no good to sympathize. It was like weeping for
the souls of the lost. Men will not feel when feeling is without effect.
At any rate, this was true in the case of the blacks. They were despised,
not because they were degraded merely; but because respect could
do them no good. But when the plan of colonizing them presented itself,
the case immediately altered—a way was open by which the black
could be benefited, and the hearts of all who understood the plan
prompted them to action. As soon as people saw that something could
be done to ameliorate the condition of this wretched race, they were
ready and willing to do it; and this feeling has gained strength with
the increase of light, and with the success of the enterprize—and may
we not expect that it will continue to gain strength as the colony on the
coast of Africa increases in magnitude and importance, and as the practicability
of the scheme of benevolence in question is with every successive
day made more and more certain? It must increase. But some may
say, and they have said, that this interest in behalf of the blacks, so far from
being an evidence that the prejudice is diminishing, results directly from
prejudice; and that if men would show respect for the blacks, or any
interest in their behalf, they must treat them as they do themselves.
Now this objection supposes two things. First, that the plan of colonization
is one of positive evil to the blacks, not only in tendency but design.
This assertion requires no argument. Finley, and Mills, and
Ashmun, did not lay down their lives to sustain an Institution, which
they thought would either directly or indirectly prove an injury to the
blacks. Christians do not now pray for the success of this Institution
because they hate the blacks, and wish in this way to do them evil.
Heaven forbid that any one should charge them with such a crime!
What, Christians pray and contribute for the support of the Colonization
Society because they hate the blacks! Charity that endureth all things
alone can endure this.

But again, the objection supposes that for us to respect our fellow,
and do unto him as we would have him do unto us, we should consider
his circumstances in every respect the same as our own. It supposes that
our duty to the blacks requires us, in order to do him the greatest possible
good, to treat him in all particulars, as we ourselves need to be
treated—that we are not to consider age, character, color, constitution,
nor any other circumstance or condition of life as making any difference,
but that we must regard him, without qualification, just as
we

are. Now this could not be true of any two white men in the country,
much less of the whites and blacks, whose condition, in every respect
differs most widely. Nor do the Sacred Scriptures require this. They
suppose that we are to regard the difference of condition between ourselves

14

and others. We are to do to others as we would that they should
do to us in like circumstances, it being remembered that the circumstances
of no two persons in the world are alike. If, therefore, we treat
the negro in a manner which we suppose will promote his highest temporal
and eternal good, we are not to be charged with acting under the
influence of prejudice, because we do not treat a white man in the same
manner. The circumstances of the two are so wide apart, that what
would be a blessing to the one, would be ruinous to the other. We
think it would be better to carry the negro to Africa and colonize him

there
, (with his own free will, of course) under a climate suited to his
constitution, and under laws and institutions calculated to make him
wise and happy, than to keep him here under the withering influences
which are operating against him. Are we therefore under the influence
of prejudice? If we are, it is a prejudice which duty prompts us exercise.
But we have bestowed more attention to this objection than it deserves.
Nothing can be plainer than that the colonization scheme has had a
great influence in weakening this prejudice against the blacks, and creating
an interest in their behalf, which must, in the nature of things, continue
to increase until the whole race shall be restored to an equality
with the whites.

3. Colonization exerts a favorable influence on the interests of the
blacks, by improving their character and elevating their condition, so as
to remove objections from the minds of those who oppose them.

Before the Society commenced operations the character of the negro
was degraded to a level with the brutes. They were even called
brutes, and books were written to show that they were not human.
But since the days of colonization such thoughts and feelings have been
laid aside. Men have begun to recognize the negro as a man, and
treat him as such; and he himself has become conscious of his power.
Says a writer in the Christian Spectator, âNot Hayti has done more to
make the negro character respected by mankind and to afford the means
of making the
negro
conscious of his manhood, than Liberia has already
accomplished. The name of Lott Carey is worth more than
the name of Boyer or Petion. It has done, it is doing more to rescue the
African character from degradation, than could be done by a thousand
volumes against prejudice.â And thus the writer goes on to say, âit
has done, and is doing more to accelerate the abolition of slavery than
could be done by a ship-load of such pamphlets and speeches as some
that we might mention. Elevate the character of the free people of
color—let it be seen that they are men indeed—let the degrading
associations that follow them be broken up by the actual improvement
of their character, as a people, and negro slavery must rapidly wither
and die.

4. Colonization exerts a favorable influence on the general interest of
the blacks, especially by directing the thoughts of slave-holders to the
subject of emancipation, as well as actually securing, in many cases,
the emancipation of slaves. Of this we have abundant evidence. Almost
every week we hear of some slave, or a number of slaves, who
have been emancipated. We hear also of many persons who are willing
to give freedom to their slaves, providing they can be removed
from the soil. There are multitudes of this description in Kentucky;
and in Missouri a large proportion of the slave-holders are willing and
desirous of doing this. A letter from a gentleman in St. Louis, says,

15

âA great change has taken place here within ten years on the subject
of slavery. The advocates of perpetual bondage are very few. The
slaves are, in many instances, an expense to their owners; and the
Colonization Society is looked to as the only hope of ridding the land
of the burden.â The same may be said of numbers in the other slave-holding
states. On this subject, the writer above alluded to remarks,
âThis is not conjecture. The friends of colonization in their arguments
can read off a catalogue of instances in which emancipation has
already resulted from the progress of this work. We know that on the
other hand it is said that the arguments and statements of colonizationists
prevent emancipation. But the proper proof of this assertion would
be to bring forward the particular facts. Tell us of the individuals
who have in fact been effectually hindered from setting their slaves at
large by what they have read in the African Repository, or by what
they have heard from the agents of the Society. We say, then, that
colonization is bringing the power of example to bear on public sentiment
at the south in regard to slavery. Each single instance of emancipation
is indeed a small matter, when compared with the continued
slavery of two millions; but every such instance, occurring in the midst
of a slave-holding community, is a strong appeal to the natural sentiments
of benevolence and justice in all who witness it.â It must be felt,
it
is
felt, by all who hold their fellow-men in bondage.

5. African colonization will exert a most happy influence on the general
interest of the negro, particularly in reference to the abolition of
slaves, by bringing free labor into competition with that of slaves.
Many people in this country begin already to feel that slave labor is unprofitable;
and if their circumstances were such that they could employ
free labor, they would certainly do it. Self-interest alone would
prompt nearly all the slave-holders in Missouri and Kentucky, and multitudes
in Virginia and Maryland, to do this if they could. And not a
few in the more determined slave-states are ready to acknowledge the
comparative worthlessness of slave-labor, (for self-interest must be
brought to bear upon the interest of emancipation) and they will be ready
to release their slaves. Slavery will cease as soon as men shall be persuaded
that it is unprofitable. Now this will be the tendency of colonization.
It will multiply the products of tropical regions, above what
can be done in slave-holding countries, and show to the latter, by actual
demonstration, the unprofitableness of the system. On this subject
the writer in the Spectator says, âWe are confident that the most
rapid and most effectual method to bring free labor into competition
with slave labor, and thus to drive the products of the latter out of
every market, is to establish on the soil of Africa a free and civilized
commonwealth, whose institutions shall all be fashioned after American
models, and whose population shall be pervaded and impelled by
the spirit of American enterprize. This is the work which the American
Colonization Society is prosecuting with all its resources. The
friends of slavery may dream that this work is to secure and perpetuate
that miserable system; but if any of them do thus imagine, they err
as widely in that as they do in supposing that the repeal of the protective
tariff will relieve them of their embarrassments. The free-trade
principles, for which they are now contending, are the principles which
will, by and by, bring all slave-holders to the alternative of universal
emancipation, or universal bankruptcy.â

16

6. The prosecution of this work has a happy influence on the general
interests of the blacks, by introducing into the slave-holding states
inquiry and discussion respecting the evils of slavery, and the possibility
of its abolition. Says the above writer in the Christian Spectator,
âThe great body of the friends of the Colonization Society, at the South
no less than at the North, regard the scheme of that institution as something,
which will ultimately, in some way, deliver the land of the curse
of Slavery. All who oppose the Society there, oppose it on the same
ground. They look upon it as being, in its tendency, and in the hopes
of its supporters, an Anti-Slavery project. Thus, in those very regions,
in which the system of Slavery sheds all its blasting influences, there is
constituted a party, the members of which are recognized by their opposers,
and more or less distinctly themselves, as hostile to Slavery, and
as looking for an opportunity to move for an abolition. In this way it
was, that when an occasion presented itself, a few months ago, the legislature
of Virginia became a scene of earnest and public discussion on
this long interdicted theme, and to the astonishment of the nation it appeared
that the party opposed to slavery was only not a majority. Had
Colonization never been thought of, had the scheme of the American
Colonization Society never been undertaken, who believes that projects
for the abolition of slavery would have been so soon if ever discussed in
the legislature of Virginia? Without that preparation of the public
mind, which the Colonization Society in the calm and peaceful prosecution
of its labors has indirectly accomplished, insurrection and massacre,
with all the fear and horrors which they occasion, would have
led only to cruelties of legislation and of practice. There is no oppression
so unrelenting and desperate as when the oppressor fears his
subjects; and the unanimous feeling of Virginia would have been
(erroneous indeed, but not on that account the less irresistible and inflexible,)
a feeling like that of him who holds a wolf by the ears: it is
dangerous to keep him, but more dangerous to let him loose; and therefore,
the more furious the struggles of the prisoner, the fiercer and closer
will be the despairing grasp that holds him.â

We entertain no doubt that the discussions, thus commenced, will
gradually become more free and thorough: will appeal more directly to
the great law that acknowledges the inalienable and universal rights of
man; and will, at the same time, find its way still farther South, till it
pervades and awakens every state from the Potomac to the Gulf of
Mexico. This is inevitable: the discussion of such a subject, involving
such hopes, and fears, and interests, when once it has been opened, can
never be suppressed. Nor is this all: such a system as slavery cannot
long withstand the power of free and full discussion. The hour in
which the debate on slavery commenced in the capital at Richmond,
may be considered as having sealed the death-warrant of the system, not
only for Virginia, but for the nation. And now it may be said, that
whatever is to be hereafter the success of the Colonization Society, in
the prosecution of its own appropriate enterprize, this great result is ultimately
sure. Not that it has nothing more to do by its indirect influence
in accelerating this result: certainly the greater the success of
the Colonization of Africa, the greater will be the progress of public
opinion towards this consummation. But let the Society be dissolved,
let the pirates of the African seas wreak their cherished wrath on Liberia—let
Montserrado be made again the mart for the slave-trade—let the

17

spot now adorned with Christian churches become again the seat of
devil-worship; let the smiling villages on the St. Paulâs be made desolate,
and the now cultivated soil be overspread with the vegetation of the
wilderness; still it will be true that the indirect influence of the American
Colonization Society has secured the abolition of Slavery.â

7. African Colonization will have a powerful tendency to destroy
the slave trade. Hitherto all efforts to stop the progress of this abominable
traffic have been unavailing. Notwithstanding the laws made
against it by various nations, and especially against the importation of
slaves into their territories, the work still goes on. It is estimated that
50,000 were carried into foreign slavery the last year. And this will
continue to be the fact for years to come, unless more effectual measures
are taken than any that government can adopt. The slave-stealers lie
along the coast of Africa, and glide up and down her rivers, ready to
seize upon every man, woman and child, who come within their reach.
And this they will continue to do in spite of all penal enactments. By
resorting to false flags, and false decks, and false passports, they effectually
elude detection; or, if they are hard pressed and cannot escape
their pursuers, they throw their cargoes overboard, and thus evade the
law which requires that slaves shall be actually found in the ship in order
to justify a capture. When hard pressed they will even head the
negroes up in casks, and cast them into the sea, that they may take
them up again when the chase is over. Now there is no conceivable
way, while the world remains as it is, by which this inhuman traffic
can be suppressed, but by establishing colonies on the coast of Africa.
And this will do it. âThis will draw a cordon around the continent
which the slave-trader cannot penetrate.â All communication with the
natives will be cut off, and if it is not wholly so, the influence which the
colonists will have upon them will remove their disposition to sell their
brethren and sisters into bondage. The colony at Liberia has already
done this to a great extent. Says a recent British publication, when
speaking of the influence of the American Colony at Liberia, âNothing
has tended more to suppress the slave-trade in this quarter, than the
constant intercourse and communication of the natives with these industrious
colonists. Wherever the influence of this colony extends, the
slave-trade has been abandoned.â And we have other evidence to
show that, for hundreds of miles around Liberia, the slave-trade has
ceased. Is it not plain then that African colonization exerts, and if
suffered to proceed will continue to exert, a favorable influence for the
suppression of the slave-trade? Does not Divine Providence seem to
point to this as the only way to bring it to an end? Is not this the way
by which those sighs and groans, and agonies unutterable, which Heaven
annually witnesses on the coast of Africa, and in the middle passage,
will be brought to an end?

8. Colonization will have a favorable influence on the interests of the
negro by affording facilities for the introduction of civilization and
christianity into the continent of Africa. The introduction of religion
and the arts into Africa, as into every other heathen country, is an object
which should be near the heart of every christian and friend of
man. The whole continent is now filled with the habitations of cruelty—the
people are sitting in the region and shadow of death. No gospel
light has ever shone upon them; but ignorance and superstition, and
moral death, everywhere prevail. Now the establishment of colonies on

18

the coast, which are under the influence of christian principle, will
have a tendency to remove this darkness from the natives around. It
has begun to do this already. Many of the natives around Liberia have
desired to place themselves under the protection of its government, and
esteem it no small privilege if they may be permitted to call themselves
Americans. They are anxious to place their children in the schools of
the colonists, and many of them through the instructions which they
have there received have become pious and devoted christians. Throughout
the whole region, bordering on Liberia, the natives appear to be
disarmed of prejudice, and ready to receive the instructions and adopt
the principles of the colonists. Now let this colony be enlarged—let
the means of education and christian knowledge be increased and extended
to the neighboring tribes—and multitudes of them would doubtless
be converted to God. If the colony at Liberia is successful, and receives
the confidence and support of the christian community, a college
may shortly be established there which, by the blessing of Heaven, will
qualify men to act as missionaries over the whole continent. Multitudes
might there be trained up, who, with all their advantages of color and
adaptation to the climate, will be vastly better qualified to preach the
gospel to their countrymen than any who could go from this country.
What encouragement then is there to urge forward the work of colonization!
For the sake of the poor natives alone, let the work go forward—let
colonies be established all along the coast—let churches and
schools be built up—circulate Bibles and tracts, and let the light of
the gospel shine—and the natives will feel its holy influence. One tribe
will receive the truth and communicate it to another, and they again to
another—knowledge will increase and multiply daily. Every gale
which sweeps from the western coast, will waft Messiahâs name farther
and farther into the interior, until that whole continent shall become
vocal with the high praises of our God.

Such are some of the favorable influences of the Colonization Society
on the general interests of the colored population. We might enumerate
many more, and say many things to obviate the objections
which some have urged against the Society, but time will not permit.
We conclude the argument, therefore, by urging all the friends of colonization
diligently to consider the testimony concerning this enterprise,
and to prepare themselves to vindicate it against the attacks of its enemies,
and to commend it to the confidence and support of the community.
The state of feeling at the present time towards the Colonization
Society requires that something should be done. Its enemies, though
feeble, are clamorous, and if nothing is done to check their influence,
may deceive some portion of the people. Let, then, the friends of colonization
awake and prepare themselves for a discussion, from which they
have everything to hope. The enterprise will go forward—the colony at
Liberia will be sustained, and the society will receive, as it deserves,
the universal and cordial gratitude and support of every portion of the
community.

PRESENT STATE OF THE COLONY.

The following letters from a respectable emigrant, will farther show
the present condition of the settlements:

From Liberia.
—We are happy to announce the arrival at Liberia
of the ship Jupiter, Captain Peters, which vessel sailed from Norfolk at
the close of October last, and for whose safety serious apprehensions
were entertained. Capt. Peters called at the Cape de Verds, and at
several places on the African coast, before he touched at Monrovia, at
which port he arrived on the 7th of March. The Rev. Melvin B. Cox,
the gentleman sent out by the Missionary Society of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, was a passenger in this ship, and was in good health
on the 8th of March, the date of our last advices.

Some of our readers will probably recollect that in December last we
noticed the departure from Norfolk of the brig Roanoke, Capt. Hatch,
for Monrovia. In this vessel an interesting colored family, named
Reynolds, from Onondaga county, were passengers. The Onondaga
Standard, of the 20th May, contains two letters from Mr. Reynolds,
which are subjoined. The letters corroborate the favorable accounts
which have been given of Liberia.

Monrovia, Liberia, March 1, 1833.

Mr. Copp
:—
Sir
: Mindful of your request that I should inform you
of my safe arrival, and how I am pleased with the country, I improve
the opportunity presented by return of Roanoke to write a short
letter. We had a pleasant passage of 42 days from land to land, and by
the attention of Capt. Hatch, were rendered quite comfortable. Not
one of my family were sea-sick a day; and by the favor of God our
health still continues, though we do not expect to escape a visit of the
fever-and-ague, which scarcely ever passes by new comers without a
call.

I find, as was represented at home, that religion is flourishing, and
Christians active. There is at present some little excitement among
sinners at Caldwell and Millsburg. We have Baptists, Methodists, and
Presbyterians here, and all seem engaged. At present I remain at
Caldwell, and shall continue to until the fever leaves me. It is very
pleasantly situated on the St. Paulâs, and might, under suitable agricultural
improvement, speedily equal in beauty any of the river towns in
America.

The land about Caldwell is rich and readily subdued; the only source
of evil hitherto, I think, arises from neglect of agricultural improvement.
The fruits are various; the orange and lime are found wild, and only
need the same care to make them abundant, as is bestowed on the
apple in New York. Lemons and papaw, and cassia and plantain, &c.
are also abundant. Pine-apples cover whole fields, growing wild.
The Lima bean and Cotton, when planted, continue to bear, I am informed,
for several years. I have seen coffee, and cotton, and indigo,
wild and abundant—also, pepper of two kinds. Water-melons and cucumbers
and grapes are found in some gardens:—thus you perceive we
have abundance of fruit to reward the laborer. A farmer on the St.
Paulâs river told me that, from one quart of
Indian Corn
, he raised three
barrels in one year. There are many cattle and hogs and fowls here,

20

and when more attention is bestowed on the land, rich pasture lands
will be abundant. I am informed that one hundred miles inland, the
cattle are large and numerous.

With a deep sense of gratitude to yourself and the other friends who
assisted me to come to this land of privileges, I desire to tender you all
my sincere thanks.

Yours, most respectfully,

WILLIAM REYNOLDS.

The following is to a colored friend.

Monrovia, March 1, 1833.

I write a few lines by Roanoke, to urge you to come out to Liberia.
The country exceeds what I anticipated while in America. It is
rich, and abounds in tropical fruits—it yields a large return to the laborer.
The climate is delightful, and the heat not near so oppressive as in
our summers and harvesting. The sea-breeze blows here every day,
and at night I find a blanket adds to my comfort. A man can get a
living and make money here in various ways as in the United States, by
trade or farming, &c. I am intending to try farming. If you come at
all come soon; the earliest settlers, we think, will have the best chance.
My family is all well, and send their respects to you. Remember me
to all inquiring friends.

Yours, &c.

WILLIAM REYNOLDS.

We shall fortify our discussion of the subject matter of the preceding
pages, by the addition of a few authentic documents, which will throw
light on some points of importance. From the Monthly Colonizationist,
we take the following description of the
present state of the Colony
:—

The Colony.

The cause of African colonization never was more prosperous or more
promising than at the present moment. In all its departments this is
the case; it is so abroad, and it is so at home.

In regard to the Colony,—which, after all, is at once the best evidence
of the progress of the Parent Institution, and the surest test of its
principles,—the authentic and indisputable accounts which reach us
from every quarter, must be admitted as sufficient to satisfy all reasonable
and candid minds, not only of the actual prosperity of the present
settlements, but of the practicableness of the colonial scheme on the
larger and nobler scale always anticipated, more or less, by the advocates
of the cause. Instances of mismanagement, as well as misfortune,
doubtless have occurred; it would be indeed a new thing in the history
of colonization, as well as in the conduct of all other systems whose
progress depends on the labor of men, if there had not been such instances.
But, not to mention that these misfortunes were mostly in their
nature such as cannot be repeated, and such as, in all events, only past
experience has been necessary to prevent for the future,—and not to
insist on the credit fairly due to the Society, for frankly acknowledging
the mistakes we allude to, and for always manifesting a readiness to
submit to instruction, and to act vigorously and promptly in the correction
of errors,—who, among the foes of the Institution, will at the worst,

21

undertake to deny that a degree of success has, on the whole, attended
its efforts on the African coast, to which, in the language of Mr. Cresson,
âthe annals of Colonization may be triumphantly challenged for a
parallel?â Since the date of this declaration of our able friend in England,
the population of the Colony has been increased by more than one half,
nearly eight hundred emigrants having been carried out during the year
immediately preceding the first of January last. Other accessions to its
establishments, during the same period, are among the most important
which have taken place. Very satisfactory arrangements have been
effected by the Colonial Agent for the settlement of Grand Bassa, a tract
of country which, in regard to its climate, soil, situation, and productions
of all kinds, is proved to be inferior to no other district on the
whole coast: a valuable territory on the western banks of the St.
Johnâs river, with four large islands within the river, additional to the
immense tract purchased by Mr. Ashmun, have not only been peaceably
obtained of the natives, but the latter have pledged themselves,—such
seems to be their anxiety to trade and associate with the Liberians,—to
erect suitable buildings, at their own expense, for the accommodation
of the first emigrants. At the time we are writing, this promising
settlement is doubtless already commenced.

It farther appears that possession has also been obtained of a large
tract of land at Grand Cape Mount, a point on the coast about as far
north from the main settlement, at Monrovia, as Grand Bassa is south.
The exports of the natives have heretofore been from $60,000 to $70,000
per annum. The fine territory now ceded, is situated at a short distance
from the sea, on the shore of a lake, about twenty miles in length,
navigable for small vessels, and into which flow several rivers, affording
important facilities for commerce with the interior. The chiefs of
the country, who are thought to be more advanced in civilization than
any others south of Sierra Leone, have granted an unquestionable title
to this land, on the sole condition that settlers shall be placed upon it
and that schools shall be established for the benefit of native children.

Some of these chiefs, having obtained the rudiments of an English
education in Liberia, expressed earnest desires that the benefits of instruction
should be afforded to their countrymen; and the young men
declared their purpose of submitting to the laws of the Colony, and
their willingness to make further grants of land, to any extent desired,
whenever the terms of the present negotiations shall have been fulfilled.
The spot selected for a settlement is said to be healthy, and the
soil capable of producing almost every thing of value that grows within
the tropics.

See the Sixteenth Annual Report, 1833.

The agriculture of the Colony was never so thrifty as at the present
time. Heretofore it has been to some extent neglected, as is always the
case with new colonies; but the most vigorous measures have been recently
adopted by the managers for its encouragement and permanent
prosperity, and these efforts are attended with great success. To the
cultivation of coffee, especially—of which the finest quality abounds
spontaneously in this latitude—the attention of several of the most respectable
colonists has been turned; and 20,000 coffee-trees have been
planted by a single individual (a colored gentleman.)
and farms of the recaptured Africans, at their two beautiful little villages
near Caldwell, are in so prosperous a state that âthey not only

22

raise sufficient for their own consumption,â says the Colonial Agent,
âbut a considerable surplus for the market.â At one of these villages
the same gentleman speaks of observing a tract of one hundred acres
planted with cassada, interspersed with patches of Indian corn and
sweet potatoes.â

The commerce of the Colony, in 1831, greatly exceeded that of any
former year; within that period, forty-six vessels visited the port of Monrovia,
and the exports were nearly $90,000. But from the last Report
we learn that, while fifty-nine vessels had visited the port during the
year preceding last May, the exports during the same period, (consisting
chiefly of camwood, ivory, palm-oil, tortoise-shell and gold,) amounted
to $125,549 16—of imports, to $80,000—and the merchandise
and produce on hand on the 1st of January, 1832, to $47,000. New
avenues have been recently opened with the interior tribes. Caravans
from a considerable distance have visited the country. The Dey people,
who number from six to eight thousand, occupying the coast immediately
north of Monrovia, have in treaty agreed to allow a free passage
to the Colony through their territories. There is now a commercial
connexion extending from our settlement even to the borders of
Foota Jallo.

It perhaps sufficiently indicates the moral condition of the Colony,
that three churches have been erected during the past year; and that
there are now six day schools for children, and one evening school for
adults, comprising in all two hundred and twenty-six pupils. Two female
schools, taught by well-qualified teachers, whose salaries are paid
by ladies of Philadelphia, are attended by ninety-nine pupils. Among
the re-captured Africans, also, a school is about to commence, under
the patronage of the same ladies; and a Sunday school already exists.
Towards the foundation of a high school, $2,000 have been
recently given by Mr. Sheldon, of New York, and $400 by the Hon. C.
F. Mercer, of Virginia. The Massachusetts State Society, at its last
annual meeting, voted to appropriate $400 per annum, for the
salary of a competent male instructer at Liberia, and half that sum for
a female. This is well. It is more important to establish thoroughly
the moral and intellectual character of the Colony, and especially of
the rising generation, than even to extend the settlements themselves.
The managers have taken a view of this subject, which merits the
warmest sanction of all the friends of education, the friends of republicanism,
the friends of freedom and truth. Whatever be the
number

of the emigrants, let their
character
be such, or let it be made such,
as may serve fitly for the foundation-stone whereon, in after times, shall
rest the firmest liberties of that continent, and the noblest glory of this.
Slow though the building of the edifice may be,—and so has been the
growth of every empire under heaven,—let it be sure, and let it be
strong. No man will inquire, a century hence, how many colonists
were carried out in any given twelve-mouth. Let it be built for the
use of posterity, and for the praise of history. Let it be raised as the
pyramids were raised, and it shall stand as the pyramids have stood.
The light of orient civilization shall shine again, like the sunrise, upon
its sides; and the last rays of freedomâs western orb, many an age
hence, when our own republic may live but in name, shall still âlinger
and play on its summits.â

Abolition of Slavery.
—The following letter, from an accomplished
and intelligent gentleman in North Carolina to a distinguished gentleman
in the city of Boston, is contained in the Columbian Centinel.
It exhibits a specimen of the sentiments which generally, if not universally,
prevail on this subject throughout the southern states, and may
enable some of our infatuated agitators to perceive the folly and madness
of their course:—

Salisbury, Rowan County, N. C., May
29th, 1833.

Dear Sir,—I shall offer no other apology for troubling you with a
letter at this time, than the importance of its subject matter. I have
chosen to address you as being a distinguished philanthropist; and on
more than one occasion, a great sufferer in the cause of real humanity;
and, from the past history of your life, I feel confident that I was not so
deceived in the high estimate I formed of your character during our too
short acquaintance, that I need fear you have turned a visionary.

It is frequently asserted in many of our southern newspapers, that
there exists in the northern and eastern sections of our country, a disposition
to interfere with slavery. This I have confidently denied on
the strength of conversations I had with distinguished gentlemen when
in your section; and on the authority of Mr. Websterâs gratifying assertion,
that there prevails at the north such a feeling on this subject as
the south would wish. More than two years since, in New England,
I heard Garrison, whom I looked upon as a misguided enthusiast, and
literally, a monomaniac, on the condition of the negroes in America;
and I was happy to find that he was discountenanced by the sober and
really benevolent portion of the community. I begin, however, to
doubt, if I have not been somewhat in error. Something, I know not
well by what class, nor as yet to what extent, surely is agitated among
you. I am not a miscellaneous reader of newspapers, and I receive
none from New England, so that my information is limited to extracts
occasionally made into more southern journals. Among these, I was
greatly struck by the following paragraph taken from the Boston Commercial
Gazette: âAt the last quarterly meeting of the New England
Anti-Slavery Society, the following resolution was adopted unanimously.
Among the gentlemen who advocated the adoption was Mr. Amasa
Walker, the candidate of the Anti-Masons for Congress.

âResolved, That the principles and measures of the New England
Anti-Slavery Society, are consistent with every duty which we owe to
our country, and that benevolence to the masters not less than to the
slaves, requires us to advocate the doctrine of
IMMEDIATE ABOLITION
.ââ

Here is the germ, I fear, (and I tremble while I think on it,) of what
will work the dissolution of our glorious Union. For the moment that
interference with the condition of our slaves is seriously attempted by
any considerable party in the non-slave-holding states, that moment this
Union is at an end. A determination not to suffer the free states to intermeddle
in any manner, with the condition of the slaves, unites in
the most perfect unanimity every political party, every religious sect,
every class of society in the slave-holding states. And I pledge myself
for the accuracy of the opinion, that not even an
attempt
to settle the
question growing out of the agitation of slavery, would be made on the

floor of Congress
.

I love the Union with an unsurpassable affection; language cannot

24

express the strength of it. I derive my being from the early pilgrims
of New England, and I shrink from the idea of that ever becoming to
me a foreign country. You know that I have regarded my rank of an

American Citizen
as a prouder birthright than that of the haughtiest
noble of Europe, whose lineage is lost in the darkness of antiquity. But
sooner than suffer the Abolitionists to carry into execution their plans,
I too would go for a dissolution of this Union. I believe before God!
that justice and humanity to
slave
, as well as to master, would require
of me to do so. This is not a fitting occasion—neither is it necessary
in addressing you, my friend, to dwell on the dangers to be apprehended
from meddlesome ignorance in so delicate a relation as that of master
and slave; nor to expatiate on the unwarrantable interference with
the rights of others, nor on the violation of faith solemnly pledged even
in the constitution of our liberties, as is purposed by the Abolitionists.
In portraying the dreadful consequences to master, and still more to the
slave, with the vices, crimes, bloodshed and horrors, that would follow
immediate abolition, who would fail to be eloquent? But immediate
abolition, is an event quite out of the question; and one of the certain
consequences of any movement, either on the part of the slaves or of the
Abolitionists, is the riveting with tenfold severity of the chains of the
former. This any one may easily perceive, by examining the enactments
on this subject, made since the distribution of Walkerâs pamphlet,
and the Virginia insurrection.

Do not conclude from my earnestness, that I believe the Abolitionists
as yet, form either a numerous or powerful party—but the contrary.—Still,
I wish, as much as lies in my humble self, to warn the good and
intelligent to repress in its birth, by their strong reprobation, a visionary
spirit, which, unchecked, will menace the Union of these United
States, while it consigns to a severer bondage the unfortunate objects of
their crusading folly. Especially do not conclude that I am hostile to
emancipation in every form, and ready to give over the African race to
perpetual, hopeless bondage. No. But in this matter the South must
take the lead; there exists among us on this point, a jealousy—shall I
not add, well grounded?
The Colonization Society is operating a
great change in public opinion here—it is gaining the confidence of the
whole South.

I rejoice that the Abolitionists are running tilt against it; and if not
discredited by the mad zeal of misguided philanthropists, it will lead, I
am sure, to the adoption of judicious measures on a much larger scale
to rescue from servitude and degradation the unfortunate Africans
amongst us.

I greatly desire to learn from you the extent of any disposition that
may exist in your section to attempt directly the abolition of slavery in
the south, and whatever else of interest, you may have to communicate
on this subject. Could you furnish me any information calculated to
remove the suspicions and quiet the apprehensions of the South, (for I
hope and still believe that right feelings concerning slavery prevail at the
North,) its publication in our newspapers here, I feel confident would
be productive of great good.

Hoping to hear from you at your earliest leisure, I am, very truly,
your friend and humble servant.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

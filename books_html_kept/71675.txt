EXPERIMENTS ON RETAINING WALLS AND
PRESSURES ON TUNNELS.

By William Cain, M.Â Am.Â Soc.Â C.Â E.

With Discussion by Messrs. J.Â R. Worcester, J.Â C. Meem,
and William Cain.

The most extended experiments relating to retaining walls are
those pertaining to retaining walls proper and the more elaborate ones
on small rotating retaining boards. The results referring to the
former agree fairly well with a rational theory, especially when the
walls are several feet in height; but with the latter, many discrepancies
occur, for which, hitherto, no explanation has been offered.

It will be the main object of this paper to show that the results of
these experiments on small retaining boards can be harmonized with
theory by including the influence of cohesion, which is neglected in
deducing practical formulas. It will be found that the influence of
cohesion is marked, because of the small size of the boards. This
information should prove of value to future experimenters, for it will
be shown that, as the height of the board or wall increases, the influence
of cohesion becomes less and less, so that (for the usual dry sand
filling) for heights, say, from 5 to 10Â ft., it can be neglected
altogether.

The result of the investigation will then be to give to the practical
constructor more confidence in the theory of the sliding prism, which
serves as the basis of the methods to follow.

As, in the course of this investigation, certain well-known constructions
for ascertaining the pressure of any granular material
against retaining walls will be needed, it is well to group them here.
The various figures are supposed to represent sections at right angles
to the inner faces of the walls with their backings of granular material.
In the surcharged wall,
Fig.Â 1
, produce the inner face of the wall to
meet the surface of the surcharge at
.
It is desired to find the
thrust against the plane,
,
for 1Â lin. ft. of the wall. Draw

through
,
the foot of the wall, making the angle of repose,
,
of the
earth with the horizontal and meeting the upper surface at
.
Since
any possible prism of rupture, as
,
in tending to move downward,
develops friction against both surfaces,
and
,
the earth
thrust on the wall will make an angle,
,
with the normal to
,

where
is the angle of friction of the earth on the wall. As the earth
settles more than the wall, this friction
will always be exerted. Again,
as the wall, from its elasticity and
that of the foundation, will tend to
move over at the top on account of
the earth thrust, the earth, with its
frictional grip on the wall, will tend
to prevent this, so that the friction is
exerted downward in either case, and the direction of the earth thrust,

,
on
is as given in
Fig.Â 1
.

However, if
,
a thin slice of earth will move with the wall,
and the rubbing will be that of earth on earth, so that
in this case
must be replaced by
.
This rule will apply in all cases that follow,
without further remark, wherever
is mentioned.

Now draw
,
making the angle,
,
with

as shown; then
draw
parallel to
,
to the intersection,
,
with
produced.
From
a parallel to

at

Since theory gives the relation:
,
two constructions follow, by geometry,
for locating the point,
.
By the first, a
semicircle is described on
as a diameter; at the point,
,
a perpendicular
is erected to
,
meeting the semicircle in
;
then
is
laid off equal to the chord,
.
By the second construction, a semicircle
is described on
as a diameter, a tangent to it,
,
from
is drawn,
limited by the perpendicular radius, and finally
is laid off
equal to
.

[
405
]
The point,
,
having been thus found by either construction, draw

parallel to
to the intersection,
,
with

is the plane of
rupture. On laying off
,
and dropping the perpendicular,
,

from
on
,
the earth pressure,
,
on
is given by
,

where
is the weight of a cubic unit of the earth; otherwise, the value
of
is given by
times the area of the shaded triangle,
.
If the
dimensions are in feet, and
is in pounds per cubic foot, the thrust,
,

will be given in pounds.

In
Figs.Â 2
and 3, the retaining boards,
,
are vertical, and

is drawn, making the angle,
,
with the vertical,
.
The
upper surface of the earth is
,
and the constructions for locating

and
are the same as for

in all the figures, represents
the plane of rupture.
[Footnote

]

In all cases, the earth thrust found as above
is supposed to make the angle,
(as shown), with the normal to the
inner wall surface.

Fig. 2.

Fig. 3.

In the Rankine theory, pertaining, say, to
Fig.Â 2
, the earth thrust
on a vertical plane,
,
is always taken as acting parallel to the top
slope. This is true for the pressure on a vertical plane in the
interior of a mass of earth of indefinite extent, but it is not true
generally for the pressure against a retaining wall. Thus, when
,

Fig.Â 2
, is horizontal, Rankineâs thrust on
would be taken as horizontal,
which entirely ignores the friction of the earth on the wall.
The two theories agree when
and
slopes at the angle of
repose, in which case, as
is parallel to
,
there is no intersection,

.
It is a limiting case in which, to compute the thrust,
can be
laid off from any point in
,
on drawing
parallel to
,
etc. As

approaches the natural slope, the point,
,
recedes indefinitely to

[
406
]

the right, and it is seen that the plane of rupture,
,
approaches
indefinitely the line,
,
or the natural slope. This limiting case,
on account of the excessive thrust corresponding, will be examined
more carefully in the sequel.

If
the
height of the wall,
,
in feet, and
the
weight of
a cubic foot of earth, in pounds, then when
,
and the surface

,

Fig.Â 2
, slopes at the angle of repose, the earth thrust, in pounds,
is given by the
equation
:

If, however,
is not equal to
,
then
is directed at the angle,

,
to the normal to the wall, and the thrust
is
:

The foregoing constructions, and the corresponding equations, are
all derived from the theory of the sliding prism. The wedge,
,

Figs.Â 2
and 3, is treated as an invariable solid, tending to slide down
the two faces,
and
,
at once, thus developing the full friction
that can be exerted on these faces. In the case of actual rotation of
the board,
,
it is found by experiment that each particle of earth
in the prism,
,
moves parallel to
,
each layer parallel to

moving over the layer just beneathÂ it.

A similar motion is observed if the board,
,
is moved horizontally
to the left. However, in the first case (of rotation) the
particles at
do not move at all, whereas in the second (of sliding
motion) the particles about
move, rubbing over the floor, which thus
resists the motion by friction. A thrust, thus recorded by springs or
other device, in the case where the wall moves horizontally, would
give an undervaluation at the lower part of
and consequently the
computed center of pressure on
would be too high. On that
account, only the experiments on rotating boards will be considered in
this paper.

The theory of the sliding wedge, however, is justified, because no
motion of either kind is actually supposed. The wedge,
,
is supposed
to be just on the point of motion, it being in equilibrium under
the action of its weight, the normal components of the reactions of the
wall, and the plane,
,
and all the friction that can be exerted along

and
.
These forces remain the same, whatever incipient motion

[
407
]

is supposed. The hypothesis of a plane surface of rupture, however, is
not exactly realized, experiment showing that the earth breaks along a
slightly curved surface convex to the moving mass. For the sake of
simplicity, the theory neglects the cohesion acting, not only along

,
but possibly to a small extent along
.
This additional force
will be included in certain investigations to be given later.

These preliminary observations having been disposed of, the results
of certain experiments on retaining walls at the limit of stability will
now be given.

Figs.Â 4, 5, 6, and 7 refer to vertical rectangular walls backed by
sand, except in the case of Fig.Â 5, where the filling was macadam
screenings. The surface of the filling was horizontal in each case.
To give briefly in detail the quantities pertaining to each wall, the
following symbols will be used:

Jr., Assoc. Am.Â Soc. C.Â E., assures the writer that the walls were
probably 6Â in. in height, though certain notes refer to walls varying
from about 4 to 9Â in.

These walls were all at the limit of
stability, and the first two are of appreciable
height, 10Â ft. and 4Â ft., respectively.

The figures show that the theory, including
the whole of the wall friction,
agrees fairly well with experiment, but
that the Rankine theory does not thus
agree. In both theories, the thrust,
,
is
supposed to act at one-third of the height
from the base of the wall to the surface of
the filling; but, in the Rankine theory, this thrust is assumed to act
horizontally, whereas, in the other theory, it is supposed to act in a
direction making the angle,
,
below the normal to the wall.

On combining the thrusts with the weight of the wall, as usual,
the resultant strikes the base produced, at
in the first case (Rankine
theory), but at
in the second case.
Figs.Â 4
to 7 present a striking
object lesson as to the inaccuracy of the Rankine method of treating
experimental retaining walls.

In the next experiments, however, referring to a retaining structure
consisting of two boards, hinged at the top,
Fig.Â 8
, and backed by sand
level at the top, the Rankine theory is applicable when the board,
,

is placed either at or below the plane of rupture, on the left of
.

The thrust on
is then assumed to act horizontally, at
above

,
and is combined with the weight of the sand,
,
to find the

[
409
]

resultant on the board. If the board is at the plane of rupture, this
resultant will make the angle
below the normal to
;
hence, if
one assumes a less thrust on
,
especially if inclined downward, the
new resultant on
will make an angle greater than
with the
normal to
,
which is inconsistent with stability.
[Footnote

]

The same reasoning
applies when
lies below the plane of rupture.
[Footnote
3
]

Fig. 9.

The retaining board, 1Â m. square, was coated with sand, so that

for damp sand. Hence, for a horizontal thrust on
,

the plane of rupture (which bisects the angle between the vertical and
the natural slope) makes an angle of
with the vertical. The
board,
,
was set at this angle to the vertical, sand was filled in level
with the top, and it was found that the structure was at the limit of
stability when

m. In the meantime, however, the sand had
dried out, so that
was
;
hence,
strictly, the construction of
Fig.Â 1
(for
earth level with top of wall) applies; but,
as the results can only differ inappreciably,
the thrust on
,
acting horizontally, was
computed for
and combined
with the weight of sand,
,
and the
weight of structure, both acting through
their centers of gravity, to find the resultant
on the base,

of stability, having

surface of the surcharge being 4.26Â ft. above the top of the wall. The

,

;
and further, that if
acts 1.303Â ft. above the base, the
resultant on the base passes exactly through the outer toe of the wall.

Fig. 10.

As the true position of the center of pressure on a surcharged wall
has never been ascertained, as far as the writer knows, he has made
a number of constructions, after the method illustrated in
Fig.Â 1
, in
order to findÂ it.

In place of making the construction for the special case above, it
was thought that the results would be more generally useful if the
natural slope was taken with a base of 3 and a rise of 2, and
,

therefore
.
The wall,
,

Fig.Â 10
, was taken
vertical and 20Â ft. high. The surcharge sloped from
at the angle

[
411
]

of repose to a point,
,
10Â ft. above
,
from which point the surface
of the earth was horizontal. The face of the wall,
,
was divided
into twenty equal parts, 1Â ft. each; and, by the construction of
Fig.Â 1
,
the thrusts (inclined at the angle,
,
below the normal to the wall)
were found for the successive heights of wall of 1, 2, 3, ... 20,Â ft.,
respectively, taking the weight of 1Â cu.Â ft. of earth equal to unity.
The successive planes of rupture are shown by the dotted lines in

Fig.Â 10
. On the original scale (2Â ft. to 1Â in.), the upper plane of
rupture (for a height of wall = 1Â ft.) was found to pass slightly to
the right
of
.

On subtracting successive thrusts, the thrusts on each foot of wall
were obtained. These were plotted as horizontal ordinates at the
center of each foot division of the wall, and the âpeaksâ were slightly
rounded off, as shown on the figure. Since, with all care, mistakes
amounting to 1% of the total thrusts can easily be made, it was proper
to adjust the results in this manner to give the most probable unit
pressures on the successive divisions of the wall. The centers of
pressure, for heights of the wall varying from 5 to 20Â ft., were easily
obtained by taking moments about some convenient point; the results
are given in
TableÂ 1
.

Call

downward, and

When some other flatter slope is given to

doubtless these
values of
will be altered, but, for the case supposed, they should prove
serviceable in practice.

Although the earth thrusts on successive portions of

really inclined at
below the normal to

they are laid off here
at right angles to it, so that the area,
,
is equal to the total
thrust on

If the unit pressures varied as the ordinates to the
straight line,
,
as for a uniformly sloping earth surface, then, as is
well known,
.
The area to the left of
gives the excess thrust
which causes
to exceed
.

Making use of the results of the table as approximately applicable
in the foregoing example (
Fig.Â 9
), and taking the center of pressure
on
as
above the base, the resultant there is found to
pass 0.02 outside of the base, therefore
.
This experiment
on a surcharged wall, of the kind shown, is particularly valuable as
being the only one of which any account has been given, as far as
the writer knows.

Recurring once more to
Fig.Â 10
, it may be recalled that some
authors have assumed the unit pressures on
to vary as the ordinates
to a trapezoid, so that the unit pressure at
was not zero (as it
should be), but an amount assumed somewhat arbitrarily. In particular,
Scheffler derived in this way
as an upper practical limit,
and used it in making tables for use in practice.

A remark must now be added (relative to all the experimental walls
previously mentioned, except Trautwineâs), that the friction of the
backing on the sides of the box in which the sand was contained has
been uniformly neglected. Where the wall is long, this can have
little influence, but where the length is not much greater than the
height, as in the experiments, this side friction becomes appreciable.

Darwin, as well as Leygue, endeavored to estimate the amount the
full thrust (with no side friction) was reduced, by experimenting
with sand behind a retaining board, or wall, enclosed in a box as
usual, when a partition board was placed perpendicular to the wall
and centrally in the mass, and comparing results with those found
when the partition board was omitted. Leygue thus found, for walls
having a length of twice the height, that the true or full thrust was
diminished about 5% from the side friction, for level-topped earth,
and as much as 15% for the surface sloping at the angle of repose.

[
413
]

If this is true, then the experimental walls just considered would
have to be thicker to withstand the actual thrust; or, to put it
another way, for the given thickness, the theoretical thrust, including
the side friction, would have to be made (as a rough average) about
5% less for the level-topped earth and (roughly) 15% less for the
earth sloping at the angle of repose. From the figures it is seen that
this will modify the results but slightly, not enough to alter the general
conclusion that the theory advocated (including the wall friction) is
practically sustained by the experiments, and that the Rankine theory
is not thus sustained.

Trautwineâs wall consisted of a central portion of uniform height,
from which it tapered to the ends, the upper surface being at the
angle of repose for the tapered ends. In this case no side friction was
developed. The results agree in a general way with the others.

In the many experiments on high grain bins, the enormous influence
of the friction of the grain against the vertical walls or sides of the
bin has been observed. In fact, the greater part of the weight of
grain, even when running out, is sustained by the walls through this
side friction. This furnishes another argument for including wall
friction in retaining-wall design.

In connection with this subject, it may be observed that many
experiments, made to determine the actual lateral pressure of sand or
its internal friction angle, are inconclusive, because an unknown part
of the vertical pressure applied to the sand in the vertical cylinder or
box was sustained by the sides of the cylinder or box. The ratio of
lateral to vertical pressures, or the friction angle, cannot be precisely
found until the proportion of the load sustained by the sides of the
containing vessel has been ascertained experimentally. The writer is
of the opinion that the best experiments to aid in the design of retaining
walls are those relating to the rotation of retaining walls or
boards. The few given herein are the best recorded, though some of
them were on models which were too small. In fact, for the small
models of Leygue and others, the effect of cohesion is so pronounced
that some of the results are very misleading.

As the experiments by Leygue
[Footnote
4
]

were very extensive, and evidently
made with great care, they will be considered carefully in
what follows.

[
414
]
As preliminary to the discussion, however, it is well to give the
essentials of Leygueâs experimental proof that cohesion and friction
exist at the same time. A box without a bottom, about 4Â in. square
in cross-section and 4Â in. high, was made into a little carriage by the
addition of four wheels. The latter ran on the sides of a trough
filled with sand which the bottom of the box nearly touched. The
box was partly filled with sand, and the trough and box were then
inclined at the angle at which motion of the box just began, the
sand in the box resting on the sand in the trough, developing friction
or cohesion or both, just before motion began. Only friction
was exerted after motion began. The solution involves the theory of
the inclined plane, but, to explain the principles of the method,
it will suffice to suppose the trough and the sand in it to be horizontal,
and that the bottomless box filled with sand is just on the
point of moving, due to a horizontal force applied to it. The weight
of the box and a part of the weight of the sand in it held up by
the friction of the sides, is directly supported by the wheels resting
on the sides of the trough; so that only a fraction of the weight,
,

of the sand in the box is supported directly by the sand in the trough.
Call this amount
.
Then, for equilibrium, calling
the horizontal force, less the resistance of the carriage wheels, we have,
[Footnote
5
]

The value of
was found by weighing: For the dry sand it varied
from 0.79 to 0.65, for heights of the sand in the box varying from
1.2 to 3.5Â in. For the damp sand and fresh earth (slightly moistened
and slightly rammed) which can stand with a vertical face for the
height of the box, the filling was loosened by many blows on the box,
and
was taken equal toÂ 1.

Three suppositions were made: (1)Â that both cohesion and friction
acted at the same time before motion; (2)Â that friction alone acted
(
)
; (3)Â that cohesion alone acted (
)
.

[
415
]
The results for various heights of sand in the box are given in

TableÂ 2

The values of
are given in kilogrammes per square meter. It
is seen that suppositions (2) and (3) give discordant results, whereas
(1), for each kind of filling, gave identical values of
and of
for
various heights; hence it may fairly be concluded that, before motion,
cohesion and friction both acted at the same time. As to the high
values found for
,
for the coherent fresh earth, Leygue states that
Collin found, by an independent method, for clayey earth and clay
of little consistency,
and
,
respectively. As a further
verification of the values of
and
given in (1), it is found that,
on using them in the formula for computing the height at which
the wet sand or earth will stand vertically, the results agree with
experiments.

The values of
,
in pounds per square foot, given in Column (1),
with the values of
corresponding to the
given, are as follows:

It is possible that the method used by Leygue may prove of service
to experimenters in obtaining more accurately than hitherto the coefficient
of internal friction. Increasing pressures could be obtained
by adding weights on top of the sand in the box; but, unless the total
weight sustained by friction along the sides of the box is determined
carefully for each weight used, the results can have but little value.
Further, for coherent earths, the method of Leygue is open to
objections.

[
416
]
Admitting the hypothesis that cohesion and friction act at the same
time, a general graphical method
[Footnote
6
]

will now be given to find the thrust
against the inner face,
,
of a retaining wall or board,
Fig.Â 11
,
caused by the earth,
,
tending to slide down some plane of
rupture,
,

,
..., the resistance along this plane being due
both to friction and cohesion.

Fig. 11.

Suppose
to be the plane of rupture, and call the weight of the
prism of rupture,
,
for a thickness of one unit,
.
The weight
of the prism causes the tendency to slide along the planes,
and

.
This tendency is resisted by the reactions of the wall,
,
and
the plane,
.
The reaction of the wall consists of the normal
component,
,
acting to the right, and the friction resistance,

,
acting up. The resultant of these two forces,
,
which is
equal and opposed to the earth thrust on
,
thus makes the angle,
,

[
417
]

with the normal to the wall. Its direction is given by
in
Fig.Â 11
.
The reaction of
is made up of the cohesion,
,
acting up along

,
the normal component,
,
acting up, and the friction,
,

acting up along

The two forces,
and
when combined,
give a resultant,
,
making an angle
with the normal,

,
to

Hence, if the angle,

then
gives the
direction of the
resultant,

The prism,

is thus in equilibrium under its own weight,

A similar investigation pertains to any other supposed prism of
rupture. To find the true one, a number of trial planes of rupture,

,
..., are assumed, and each is treated in turn as a true
one (though there can be only one true one). As seen above, the
resultant of the normal reaction and friction on any trial plane of
rupture must be inclined below the normal to the plane at the angle,
.

To lay off the directions of these resultants, from any convenient

1Â cu. ft. of earth. The prisms are supposed to be 1Â ft. in length
perpendicular to the plane of the paper.

These weights are now laid off to the scale of force, vertically

to points 1, 2, 3, ..., and from these points, lines

The solution represented by

is general, and applies whether

is horizontal or
inclined above or below the horizontal. It can likewise be easily
adapted to the case shown in

[Footnote

The construction of
Fig.Â 11

has been used in evaluating the thrust and determining (approximately)
the plane of rupture in the experiments (recorded below) of Leygue
on retaining boards,
,
that could be rotated about

and thus
placed at any inclination to the vertical. In all the experiments, the
vertical height of
was 0.656Â ft.; the length of the board was 1.3Â ft.
The value of the moment of the earth thrust about
was found by use
of suitable apparatus, corresponding
to dry sand with a natural slope of
3Â base to 2Â rise, or

and

lb. per cu.Â ft. By
use of the partition board mentioned
previously, the side friction of the
sand on the glass sides of the box
containing it was estimated, and the
moments corrected, so as to give the
true moment when there is no side friction. The notation used to
express results is partly given in

By a comparison of the values, it is evident that, if the cohesion
was assumed at a little less than 1Â lb. per sq.Â ft., the theoretical and
experimental values could be made to agree exactly. The case just
examined exhibits the most pronounced difference between the ordinary
theory (corresponding to
)
and experiment, of any shown in

TableÂ 3
. Further, it will be observed, that, for an assumed cohesion
of about 1Â lb. per sq.Â ft., the theoretical and experimental values for all
the cases given by Leygue very nearly agree.

The results in
TableÂ 3
are remarkable, and explain quite satisfactorily
how Leygue, Darwin, and others found, by experiments on
small models, results differing so much from the ordinary theory,
where cohesion is neglected.

It should be remarked that the values of
given in
TableÂ 3
under
âExperiment,â are not exactly those given by Leygue in his tables, but
are the averages obtained from the two sets of drawings given by him
in the plates, and represent the inclinations of the chords of the really
curved surfaces of rupture. His experiments with the spring apparatus

[
422
]

are not considered, as the results are open to doubt, because the prism
of rupture, in descending, could not slide down freely, but as it
advanced would rub over the floor, thus lessening the thrust there
considerably.

From
TableÂ 3
, the results given by experiment are seen to differ
widely from the ordinary theory in which
.

The discrepancies are largely, or almost entirely, due to the very
small models used, as will be evident from the following considerations:
Suppose the height,
,
of the wall,
,
to be 10 times the
height given in
Fig.Â 11
, or 6.56Â ft.; then, as the areas of triangles such
as
,
etc., vary as the squares of the heights, but the lengths of
sides, as
etc., vary only as the first power of the heights, the
weights of the successive trial prisms of rupture will be
or 100
times as great as before, whereas the corresponding cohesive forces,
acting along the planes,
,
etc., will be only 10 times the first values.
Hence, if we use a scale of force
of the former scale, the weights of
the prisms,
,

,
etc., will be represented, as before, by
,

,

etc., but the lines representing the cohesive forces will be only
of
the former lengths. Thus the new
,

Fig.Â 11
, will be laid off from
4 only
of the length shown in the figure.

The relative decrease in the lines representing cohesive forces
will be still more marked for a wall

ft. high, the
weights of prisms being 400 times as great, but the cohesive forces
only 20 times as great as before. It is evident from this reasoning
that, for
,
the cohesive forces are practically negligible for walls,
say, 10Â ft. high, especially if the earth surface is level. In fact, a
little examination of the original drawings showed, for walls about
6Â ft. high, that the earth thrust, neglecting cohesion, was only from
1 to 5% in excess over that for
.
The smaller percentages
referring to
,
or
,
while the larger percentages
referred to
,
for earth surface horizontal or sloping
at the angle of repose.

Such results should be of great service to future experimenters as
proving two things: (1)Â that dry sand, with as small a coefficient of
cohesion as possible, should be used (perhaps grain would be a more
suitable material), and (2)Â that no experimental wall should be less
than from 6 to 10Â ft. high.

Even if the wall is, say, 6Â ft. high, if damp clayey earth is used

[
423
]

as the filling, with a coefficient of adhesion,
,
then all the diagrams
of forces, as in
Fig.Â 11
, will be the same as before, or similar
figures, and the discrepancies noted in
TableÂ 3
, will be as pronounced
as ever. All the experiments on retaining boards, except some of
Curieâs, have been with very small models, and the results have brought
the common theory under suspicion, if not into disrepute.

The writer hopes that the foregoing investigation and results may
be instrumental in establishing more confidence in the theory, and in
showing when cohesive forces may be practically neglected and when
they must be included.

As an illustration, the results for a vertical wall 10Â ft. high are
presented in
TableÂ 4
, taking
and
.
In the first
wall, the surface of the earth was horizontal; in the second wall its
slope was 1Â rise to 2Â base.

In
TableÂ 4
the results for
and
are practically the same,
but
for
is 13% less than for
.
If the value,
,

for fresh earth slightly damp and lightly rammed, given by Leygue
above, is even approximately correct, it is seen that, for such a filling,
the effect of cohesion must be included to get results at all agreeable
with experience or experiment.

Recurring to the experimental retaining walls proper,
Figs.Â 4
to
9
,
it is evident from the foregoing, that cohesion will affect the results
inappreciably, except perhaps in the case of
Figs.Â 6
and 7, where
the height was about 0.6Â ft. Assuming
,
it seems to be probable,
from the results of
TableÂ 4
, that the thrust should be decreased in
the ratio of 93:111. Effecting the construction for the new thrust,
it is found that the point, I, falls within the base, 0.03 of its width for

Fig.Â 6
(Trautwineâs wall), and 0.02 of its width for
Fig.Â 7
(Curieâs
wall).

[
424
]
The theory advocated is thus practically sustained by all the experiments
given above, either on retaining boards or retaining walls proper,
when a coefficient of cohesion of about
for dry sand is used.

The method of evaluating the thrust, given in
Fig.Â 11
, is as valid
when
,
or cohesion is neglected, as in the ordinary theory. The
lines parallel to the thrust are now drawn directly from 1, 2, ...,
to the intersection with
,

,
..., and the greatest one is taken
for the true thrust. Although the writer expressly disclaims any
great accuracy in the values of
in
TableÂ 4
, on account of the small
scale of the drawings, nevertheless, the results by the construction for

and
or Â½, were found to differ from computed
values only 2, 3, 0, and 1% for the different cases, which should give
confidence in the general conclusions, at least.

The diagram,
Fig.Â 11
, with a slight modification, can be utilized to
find the coefficient of cohesion,
,
at which the bank of earth will
stand without a retaining board. Thus, let each line, as
,
representing
the cohesive force acting along its proper plane, be extended to
meet the corresponding
;
any such line measured to the scale of
force and then divided by the length of the plane along which it
acts, will give the cohesive force, in pounds per square foot, corresponding
to no thrust on
,
for the particular plane considered.
The greatest of these values is evidently the value of
for which
the filling will stand without a retaining board. The work can be
much abbreviated by using a well-known principle, that the plane
along which the unit cohesion is greatest (the plane of rupture)
bisects the angle,
,
between the surface,
,
and the line of
natural slope. Suppose
to be this plane, then we have only to
extend
to meet
,
at 0, measure 10 to the scale of force, and
divide by the length of
,
to the scale of distance, to find the
coefficient desired. By either method it was found that a cohesive
force of 7Â lb. per sq.Â ft. was required to sustain a mass of earth with
a vertical face,

ft. high, when
was horizontal.

It was stated, in connection with
EquationsÂ (1)
and
(2)
, referring
to the thrust on a vertical wall of height,
,
with the earth surface sloping
at the angle of repose, that this particular case would be discussed
later. To show the influence of cohesion, the planes of rupture for
such a wall, 2.4Â ft. high, for various values of
(in pounds per square

[
425
]

foot), are given in
Fig.Â 13
. The values of
(for
and
)
are as follows:

Fig. 13.

The first value was found by computation, the others by construction.
As is well known, the theoretical plane of rupture approaches
indefinitely the natural slope as
approaches zero. For appreciable
cohesion (and there is always some cohesion) the plane of rupture lies
above the natural slope, with very materially decreasing normal
components to the thrust as
increases. As the height of wall
increases, the influence of cohesion diminishes. Thus, as shown above,
for a wall 5 times 2.4Â ft., or 12Â ft.
high, the weights of the prisms,

,
etc., are 25 times the former
values, but the cohesive forces,
which vary directly as
,
etc.,
are only 5 times the first values.
Hence, if the former values of
are
multiplied byÂ 5, the new diagram
of forces,
Fig.Â 11
, will be similar
to the old one. Thus, for the wall
12Â ft. high, the plane of rupture
and the value of
,
for
,

correspond to the old values for
,
for
,
to the old values for

.
For fresh earth filling, slightly packed, it is possible that the
values,
,

,
may be reached, with a material reduction
in
from the values given by
EquationsÂ (1)
and
(2)
. As the height
of the wall increases, say to 25 or 50Â ft., the influence of cohesion, in
diminishing the thrust, becomes very small, and it is better to ignore
it altogether. In fact, as we know very little, and that imperfectly,
of the coefficients of cohesion, it is perhaps safer, at present, to use

EquationsÂ (1)
and
(2)
in all cases. It is very evident, though, that
for most cases in practice, the formulas give a very appreciable excess
over the true thrust, and that the true plane of rupture never
coincides with the natural slope.

[
426
]
From all that precedes, it is seen that the results of experiments on
small models in the past have proved to be very misleading, and
that experiments on large models are desirable, and can alone give
confidence. Leygue has made such experiments on retaining boards,
from 1 to 2Â m. (3.28 to 6.56Â ft.) in height, simply to determine the surface
of rupture. This is really the essential thing, for, as soon as the
prism of rupture is known, the thrust is easily found. In a general
way, the results agree with theory when the cohesion is neglected,
though the curved surfaces of rupture were very irregular, particularly
for the stone filling. The first two experiments were made with
both dry and damp sand as a filling; the next six, with stones varying
from 1.5 to 20Â in. in diameter. In another series of five experiments,
sand was used. In all the foregoing experiments, the surface of the
material was horizontal. In three additional experiments, the walls
were surcharged with sand as a filling. In one experiment, the wall
was 6.56Â ft. high and the surcharge was 3.28Â ft.; in another experiment,
the wall was 3.28Â ft. high, and the sand, sloping from its top
at the angle of repose, as in the former case, extended to 3.28Â ft.
above the wall, where the surface was horizontal.

Applying the construction of
Fig.Â 1
, it was found that the plane
of rupture passed, say, 2Â° above that given by experiment in the
first case and about 3Â° below in the second. It will be evident from
the construction of
Fig.Â 11
, omitting cohesion, that trial planes of
rupture differing by 2 or 3Â° from the true one, give nearly the same
thrust. Taking the average, these experiments on large models, tend,
in a general way, to sustain the theory.

In a paper by the late Sir Benjamin Baker, Hon.Â M. Am.Â Soc. C.Â E.,
âThe Actual Lateral Pressure of Earthwork,â
[Footnote
8
]

two experiments by
Lieut. Hope and one by Col. Michon, on counterforted walls, are given.
Although such walls do not admit of precise computation, on account of
the unknown weight of earth carried by the counterforts, through friction
caused by the thrust of the earth in a direction perpendicular to the
counterforts, still the computation was made, as the conclusions are
interesting. Therefore, the first vertical wall of Lieut. Hope was
examined, especially as Mr.Â Baker, using the Rankine theory, found,
for this wall, the greatest divergence between the actual and the
Rankine thrust, of any retaining wall examined.

[
427
]
At the moment of failure, the wall was 12Â ft. 10Â in. high, the
thickness of the panel was 18Â in., and the counterforts were 10Â ft.
from center to center, projecting 27Â in. from the wall, or 3Â ft. 9Â in.
from the face, as inferred from the next example. As it is stated that the
wall had the same volume as the 10-ft. wall previously examined in
this paper (
Fig.Â 4
), the counterforts must have been 2Â ft. thick.
Assuming these dimensions, and using the values given;
,

or
(say
)
,

weight
of a cubic foot
of earth, and

weight
of a cubic foot of masonry, we
first compute

lb., the normal component of the earth
thrust on a length of 1Â ft. of wall. The normal thrust on the panel
is thus
and on the counterfort
.
The friction (acting vertically
downward) caused by this thrust is
on the panel and

on the counterfort. The moment of these forces about
the outer toe of the wall, totals 39 800Â ft‑lb. The resisting moment of
10Â ft. in length of combined panel and counterfort, about the outer
toe, assuming the wall to be vertical, is 29 800Â ft‑lb. If, to the latter,
we add the moment of 17% of the weight of earth between the counterforts,
supposed to be held up by the sides of the latter, the total
moment exactly equals the first. However, at the moment of failure
by overturning, the panels had bulged 4Â½Â in. and the overhang at the
top was 7Â½Â in. Taking the moment of stability of the wall at 26 000Â ft‑lb.
(Mr.Â Bakerâs figure), it is found that, for equilibrium, 24% of
the weight of earth between the counterforts must be carried by them,
When the earth was 8Â ft. high, a heavy rain was recorded, so that,
doubtless, some appreciable cohesion was exerted, though necessarily
omitted in the computation.

The experimental wall of Col. Michon was 40Â ft. high, with very
deep counterforts, only 5Â ft. from center to center. The very heavy
and wet filling between the counterforts, being treated as a part of the
wall, a construction (made on the printed drawing) shows that the
resultant of earth thrust and weight of wall passes through the outer
toe. Doubtless the cohesion factor in this wall was large. In the
paper mentioned, the details as to Gen. Burgoyneâs experimental
walls are given. There were four of these walls, each 20Â ft. long, 20Â ft.
high, and with a mean thickness of 3Â ft. 4Â in. Two of the walls
were perfectly stable, as in fact theory indicates for all four walls
if they were monolithic. The other two walls fell, one bursting out

[
428
]

at 5Â ft. 6Â in. from the base, and the other (a vertical wall), breaking
across, as it were, at about one-fourth of its height. As these walls
consisted of rough granite blocks laid dry, it is highly probable that
the breaks were due to sliding, owing to the imperfect construction;
besides, âthe filling was of loose earth filled in at random without
ramming or other precautions during a very wet winter.â

From a consideration of all the observations and experiments (some
of them unintentional), Mr.Â Baker concludes that the theoretical
thrust is often double the actual lateral pressure. He used the old
theory, which neglects both cohesion and wall friction. If he had
included them, the resulting theory would not have been so deficient
âin the most vital elements existent in factâ as he charges against
the âtextbookâ theory.

However, the writer must be clearly understood as not recommending
that cohesive forces be considered in designing a retaining wall
backed by a granular material, such as fresh earth, sand, gravel, or
ballast. It has been the main object of this paper to show that,
although cohesive forces must be included in interpreting properly
the results on small models and many retaining walls, yet, for walls
more than 6 or 10Â ft. in height, backed with dry fresh material, not
consolidated, the cohesive forces can be practically neglected in design.
Hence, experimenters are strongly advised to leave small models severely
alone and confine their experiments to walls from 6 to 10Â ft. high,
backed by a truly granular material, such as dry sand, coal, grain,
gravel, or ballast, where the cohesive forces will not affect the results
materially. Further, it is evident that walls of brick in wet sand, or
walls of granite blocks, etc., laid dry, are very imperfect walls. The
overhang, just before falling, is large, and the base is often imperfect.
For precise measurements, a light but strong timber wall on a firm
foundation, seems to be best; and the triangular frame of
Fig.Â 8
seems
to meet the required conditions very well, especially if the framing is
an open one, with a retaining board only on one leg. The base thus
becomes wider, and the overhang less, than with any rectangular wall.

When the design of a wall to sustain the pressure of consolidated
earth is in question, even if a perfect mathematical theory existed, it
would still prove of little or no practical value, because the coefficients
of friction and cohesion are unknown. The coefficient of friction at
the surface can be easily found, but it is a difficult matter to find the

[
429
]

coefficient of cohesion, which doubtless varies greatly throughout
the mass.

Mr. W.Â Airy, in his discussion of Mr.Â Bakerâs paper, states that
he found the tensile strength of a block of ordinary brick clay to be
168 and of a certain shaley clay 800Â lb. per sq.Â ft., the coefficients of
friction for the two materials being 1.15 and 0.36, respectively.
Cohesive resistance is more analogous to shear, but such figures indicate
the wide variations to be expected, particularly in
,
the coefficient of
cohesion. If this coefficient is to be guessed at, in order to substitute
it in the supposed perfect formula, then it is plainly better to guess at
the thickness of the wall in the first instance.

As an illustration, consider the well-known equation:
[Footnote
9
]

which gives the height,
,
of vertical trench that will stand without
any sheeting.

In this equation,

Thus, if
,
whence
,
the equation reduces to

As certain trenches with vertical sides have been observed to stand
unsupported for heights of 15 or even 25Â ft., the equation would seem
to indicate that cohesive or shearing resistances of about 200 to
300Â lb. per sq.Â ft. were required to cause equilibrium. If friction is
not supposed to be exerted, then
and
;
and, for the
same unsupported heights, the cohesion would be about doubled.

[
430
]

Evidently, if cohesion, which (to judge from Mr.Â Airyâs experiments) may
vary from one to several hundred pounds per square foot, has to be
guessed at in order to determine
,
it is plainly better to guess at

at once.

The foregoing equation cannot be regarded as giving very accurate
results, mainly because a plane surface of rupture is assumed, whereas,
from both theory and observation, this surface is known to be very
much curved; besides, the cohesion and friction along the ends of the
break have been neglected. However, the hypothesis of a plane surface
of rupture, the ends being supposed to be included, gives a greater
value to
than the true one, whereas, neglecting the influence of the
ends, it tends in the other direction; so that the equation may not
err so greatly.

Fig. 14.

In the discussion of the paper
[Footnote
10
]

by J.Â C. Meem, M.Â Am. Soc. C.Â E.,
E.Â G. Haines, M.Â Am. Soc. C.Â E., states that where breaks occur
in the sides of an unsupported trench, the solid
of rupture often approximates to a quarter sphere,
surmounted by a half-cylinder of the same
height, the radii of the sphere and cylinder
being equal. In
Fig.Â 14
, let
represent the
quarter-sphere,
the half-cylinder, and

the face of the trench. According to
the observations of Mr.Â Haines, when the part,

,
of the side of the trench is supported by
sheeting and bracing, it sometimes happens that a part of the quarter-sphere,

,
breaks out, so that the semi-cylinder above would
descend but for the bracing, the thrust of which, it is supposed,
induces arch action in the earth.

This is possible; but, if so, as the sheeting is not supposed to be
carried to the bottom of the trench, there can be no vertical component
in its reaction, and the thrust,
,
of the braces and sheeting, acting
on
,
must be horizontal; further, the earth cannot act as a
series of independent arches devoid of frictional resistance between
them, but must act as a whole.

Another way of explaining the phenomena is to suppose the horizontal
thrust of the braces,
,
on the exposed face,
,
to cause

[
431
]

friction at the back of the break of sufficient intensity to prevent the
semi-cylinder from descending, just as a book can be held against a
vertical wall by a horizontal push.

To illustrate the principle, it will suffice to replace the semi-cylinder
by the circumscribing parallelopiped,
,
and suppose it to be held up by the friction on the back face, with possibly cohesion
acting on the three interior vertical faces. Thus, let
,

and
;
then the friction on the back face is
,
the cohesion
on the three faces is
,
and the weight of earth,

,
equals
.
Hence, as friction and cohesion always act opposite
to the incipient motion, or vertically upward in this case,

Evidently, the value of
,
derived from this equation, gives an
extreme upper limit, which is doubtless never attained, as there is
nearly always some support from the earth which has not broken out
below the level of
.

Where the sheeting and bracing are of sufficient size, are tightly
keyed up, and extend to the bottom of the trench, or where the bank
is supported by a retaining wall, the earth near the bottom cannot
break out, and the equation is not valid.

However, if, from any cause, such as insufficient sheeting, the
break has taken place over even a part of
,
the mass,
,
above
will tend to tip over at the top, giving the greatest pressure on the top
braces. This appears to explain the phenomena observed by Mr.Â Meem
and others in connection with some trenches.

With regard to tunnel linings, as is well known, the vertical
pressure on the top is generally small, the great mass of earth vertically
over the tunnel being largely held up by the friction of the earth
(caused by the earth thrust) on its vertical sides, exactly as in the case
of tall bins, where most of the weight of the grain is held up by the
sides of the bin, the theory being very similar in the two cases. In
consolidated earth, cohesion assists very materially in this action.

It might be inferred, from the facts of observation, that consolidated
earth acts as a solid, though, of course, it differs from a solid
in this: that its physical constants (cohesion, friction, etc.) vary
enormously with the degree of moisture. It is likely that these
constants alter with the depth, and likewise are subject to changes
from shocks.

[
432
]
It is a question too, whether, as is the case with loosely granular
materials, friction acts (before rupture) at the same time with shear
or cohesion in consolidated earth. From the interesting remarks
[Footnote
11
]

of Mansfield Merriman, M.Â Am. Soc. C.Â E., on internal friction,
it seems probable that friction and shear exist at the same time in
a solid; but, to reach sound conclusions, as he states, âfurther studies
on internal friction and on internal molecular forces are absolutely
necessary.â

From the present state of our knowledge with respect to the theory
and physical constants pertaining to consolidated earth, it would seem
that experience must largely be the guide in dealing with it. The
facts are supremeâthe rational theory may come later.

Similarly, for retaining walls backed by loosely aggregated, granular
materials, the facts are supreme, and, on that account, they have
been presented very fully in this paper; further, a theory has been
found to interpret them properly. It is true that the fresh earth,
from the time that it is deposited behind a retaining wall, begins to
change to a consolidated earth, from the action of rains, the compression
due to gravity, and the influence of those cohesive and chemical
affinities which manufacture solid earths and clays out of loosely
aggregated materials, and even cause the backing sometimes to shrink
away from the wall intended to support it; but it is plain that the
wall should be designed for the greatest thrust that can come on it
at any time, and this, in the great majority of cases, will occur
when the earth has been recently deposited.

The cases which have been observed where the bank has shrunk
away from the wall and afterward ruptured (after saturation, perhaps)
are too few in number to warrant including in a general scheme of
design, even supposing that a rational theory existed for such cases.
A few remarks on the theory pertaining to the design of retaining
walls may not be inappropriate. From the discussion of all the
experiments referred to in this paper, the conclusion may be fairly
drawn that the sliding wedge theory, involving wall friction, is a
practical one for granular materials of any kind subjected to a static
load. In practical design, however, vibration due to a moving load
has to be allowed for; also the effect of heavy rains. Both these
influences tend generally to lower the coefficients of friction and add
to the weight of the filling. Mr.Â Baker says:

[
433
]
âGranite blocks, which will start on nothing flatter than 1.4 to 1,
will continue in motion on an incline of 2.2 to 1,
[Footnote
12
]

and, for similar
reasons, earthwork will assume a flatter slope and exert a greater
lateral pressure under vibration than when at rest.â

Instances of slips in railway cuttings, caused by the vibration set
up by passing trains, have been given by many engineers. The effect
of vibration is most pronounced near the top of a retaining wall,
and is evidently greater for a low wall than for a high one. All the
influences cited can only be included under the factor of safety, and
the writer recommends for walls from 10 to 20Â ft. in height a factor
of 3. This may be increased to 3.5 for walls 6Â ft. high and decreased
to 2.5 for walls 50Â ft. high, or those with very high surcharges. In
the application, the normal component of the earth thrust on the
wall,
,
will alone be multiplied by the factor, the friction,
,

exerted downward along the back of the wall,
being unchanged. This allows very materially
for a decrease in
due to rains and
vibration, as well as for an increase in the
thrust, due to
becoming less.

Fig. 15.

The effect is illustrated in
Fig.Â 15
, where
a retaining wall is supposed to be subjected
to the earth thrust,

to
;
whence
will represent the thrust, which, combined with
the weight of the wall, acting through its center of gravity, must pass
through the outer toe of the wall.

To see what thickness of a vertical rectangular wall corresponds
to this factor of safety, 3, for
,
or a natural slope
of 3Â base to 2Â rise, let it be assumed that the weights per cubic
foot of earth and cut-stone masonry in mortar are in the ratio of 2:3;
then, for level-topped earth, a computation shows that, for the factor,
3, the base of the wall must be
.
If the earth slopes indefinitely
at the angle of repose from the top of the back of the wall, and a
factor 2.5 is used, then the thickness will be
.

[
434
]
For brick masonry in mortar, the specific weight of which is

of that of the filling, the foregoing thickness would be changed
to
and
,
respectively,
being equal to the height of the
wall.

It must be noted especially, however, that if the original earth
thrust, when combined as usual with the weight of wall, gives a
resultant which passes outside of the middle third of the base of
the wall as computed above, then the thickness must be increased,
so that the resultant will at least pass through the outer middle-third
limit. This ensures compression over the whole base and
no opening of part of the joint under normal conditions. With regard
to the thickness above of about one-third of the height, Mr.Â Baker
states that hundreds of brick revetments have been built by the Royal
Engineer officers, with a thickness of only
for a vertical wall.
He advises, as the result of his own extensive experience, that the
thickness be made one-third of the height for level-topped earth of
average character, and that the wall be battered 1Â½Â in. to the foot.
He states, further, that, under no ordinary conditions of surcharge
on heavy backing is it necessary to make the thickness of a retaining
wall on a solid foundation more than one-half the height. The
thicknesses computed above agree fairly well with those recommended
by Mr.Â Baker, and it would seem that a table of thicknesses computed
on the above basis should correspond to safe walls under ordinary
conditions.

It has been noted above that
EquationÂ (1)
, corresponding to a
slope of indefinite extent, probably gives too great a thrust; besides,
there are no embankments with such a slope. An embankment from
100 to 150Â ft. high, supported by a low wall, may approximate the
conditions assumed, but, before it is finished, the earth has consolidated
to such an extent that the actual thrust is doubtless much less
than the computed one. The truth is that, in nearly all back-filling
of ordinary earth, the cohesive and chemical affinities commence their
work very soon after the filling is deposited, and consolidation is
gradually effected; so that, as has been stated, the actual thrust is
often much less than is estimated in the design of the wall, where
cohesive forces are neglected. In many old walls, as has been
observed, the consolidation has gone so far that the backing has
shrunk away from the wall altogether. It would be hazardous, though,

[
435
]

to allow for cohesion, in a wall backed by fresh earth, unless the surcharge
was high and was a long time in building. Finally, it should
be observed that the footing of a retaining wall should be wide,
and should always be tilted at such an angle that sliding is impossible.

A glance at
Figs.Â 4
, 5, and 6, will make it apparent that the
Rankine and other theories differ in their results mainly because of
the assumed difference of inclination of the earth thrust. In the
design of walls, however, the method proposed (
Fig.Â 15
) will approximate
in results those given by the Rankine theory, where, say, the
earth thrust, whether inclined or not, is multiplied by the factor
of safety. The writer
does not advocate the middle-third
limit method
in design, as it gives variable factors of safety for different types
of walls. Besides, if the actual resultant on the base passes one-third
of its width from the outer toe, there is no pressure at the
inner toe, and the unit pressure at the outer toe is double the
average. If vibration or other cause increases the thrust, the joint
at the inner toe opens, and the pressure is concentrated too much
near the outer toe. In the reinforced concrete wall, the earth thrust
on a vertical plane through the inner toe is required. As this plane
lies well within the earth mass, the thrust on it must be taken as
acting parallel to the top slope, and its amount will be the same as
that given by the Rankine theory.

Although it is highly desirable to have more precise experiments
on large models in order to draw sure conclusions, yet, as far as the
experiments goâthose which have been analyzed and discussed in
this paperâthe following conclusions may be stated:

1
.âWhen wall friction and cohesion are included, the sliding-wedge
theory is a reliable one, when the filling is a loosely aggregated
granular material, for any height of wall.

2
.âFor experimental walls, from 6 to 10Â ft. high, and greater,
backed by sand or any granular material possessing little cohesion, the
influence of cohesion can be neglected in the analysis. Hence, further
experiments should be made only on walls at least 6Â ft., and preferably
10Â ft., high.

3
.âThe many experiments that have been made on retaining
boards less than 1Â ft. high, have been analyzed by their authors on
the supposition that cohesion could be neglected. This hypothesis is
so far from the truth that the deductions are very misleading.

[
436
]
4
.âAs it is difficult to ascertain accurately the coefficient of cohesion,
and as it varies with the amount of moisture in the material,
small models should be discarded altogether in future experiments,
and attention should be confined to large ones. Such walls should be
made as light, and with as wide a base, as possible. A triangular
frame of wood on an unyielding foundation seems to meet the conditions
for precise measurements.

5
.âThe sliding-wedge theory, omitting cohesion but including
wall friction, is a good practical one for the design of retaining walls
backed by fresh earth, when a proper factor of safety is used.

As the subject of pressures on the roof and sides of a tunnel
lining has received much attention of late, the writer has concluded
to extend this paper, so as to give a development of a theory, based
on the grain-bin theory of Janssen, but modified to include the cohesive
or shearing resistances of the earth in addition
to the frictional resistances.

Fig. 16.

Fig.Â 16
is a vertical transverse section of a
tunnel,
,
and the earth,
,
extending
over it
feet. If this tunnel has been driven by
the use of a shield or poling boards, the ground
will tend to settle over it, and part of the weight
of
will be sustained by cohesion and friction
(resulting from the lateral thrust) exerted
along the sides, vertically upward. The earth will
probably arch itself, or form a series of domes superposed one upon
the other, but the external forces acting on such domes will be the same
as those acting on a corresponding horizontal lamina, and the theory,
given in full in the Appendix, begins with the considerations pertaining
to the equilibrium of such a lamina.

If there was no settlement of the earth,
,
in relation to

,
then the vertical pressure per square foot on
would be

(
being the weight of a cubic foot of the earth in pounds), but,
as most of the weight of
is carried by the sides, in case of
sufficient settlement, the vertical unit pressure,
,
on
,
will be
much less than
.
Also, the lateral unit pressure,
,
at the level,

,
will be much less where settlement occurs. From the equations
for
and
,
given in the Appendix, the diagrams,
Figs. 17
and 18,
have been constructed.

[
437
]
In both diagrams, the weight of the earth was taken at

lb.
per cu.Â ft., and the cohesion of the earth at

lb. per sq.Â ft. In

Fig.Â 17

and the curves for

of tunnel,

of 15Â ft. and also for 30Â ft. In
Fig.Â 18

and

also for

ft. and 30Â ft. for various

heights,
.

It will be perceived, in both figures, that when certain heights
are attained, both
and
cease to increase perceptibly, so that such
values may be taken as corresponding to
indefinitely large.

Fig. 17.

Fig. 18.

A simple way of deriving these extreme values is given in the
Appendix. The values of
,

and
have been taken here the same
as those used by Mr.Â Meem, in framing his table of pressures,
[Footnote
13
]

which may be supposed to embody, in part, practical experience. The results
found from
Figs.Â 17
and 18 by the writer, for a depth of covering of
several hundred feet, are uniformly much larger than those given by
Mr.Â Meem. Are they too large for safety?
In answering
this question,
it must be remembered that, of the weight of earth directly over
the tunnel, all has been transferred to the sides that it was possible
to transfer, for the coefficients of friction and cohesion given. We
know scarcely anything of the cohesion coefficients, so that the value
assumed,

lb. per sq.Â ft., may not be near the truth. Certainly
it must appear plain from this discussion that the values of
and

must be better known, for all kinds of earth, before reliable results
can be attained. The results are submitted for discussion, in the
hope that engineers will give their experience relative to the pressures

[
438
]

realized in the timbering of tunnels, particularly through sand or
earth not thoroughly consolidated.

The value of
,
in
Figs.Â 17
and 18, is the average vertical unit
pressure at the top of the tunnel. Experiments on grain bins lead
to the inference that the pressure at the middle of the roof is greater
than that at the sides, but no law of variation can be stated.

The lateral unit pressure on the vertical sides of the tunnel lining
at the top is given by the equation for
,
or by the corresponding
diagram. The variation in this lateral pressure over the sides of
the tunnel cannot be easily formulated, as so much of the weight of
the earth, directly over the tunnel, has been transferred by a kind of
arch action to the sides. Experience would better speak here.

TableÂ 5
gives the values of
and
for

ft. The figures
in Columns
are taken from Mr.Â Meemâs table, previously referred
to; those for Columns
are from the diagrams,
Figs.Â 17
andÂ 18.

In quoting Mr.Â Meemâs figures, the writer must not be understood as
endorsing in any way his theory; but the results are of interest as
embodying the conclusions of a practical engineer of large experience.

If the height,
,
of earth covering is 200 or 300Â ft., the values
given by
Figs.Â 17
and 18 are much larger than those given in Columns

,
which presumably represent Mr.Â Meemâs pressures for any height
greater than 40Â ft.

In saturated earth, it has been customary, perhaps, to regard the
earth as if it were gravel composed of solid spheres, like marbles,
so that the water has free access in any direction. Thus, in the
case of a retaining wall backed by such material, the water has full
access practically to every part of the wall, and the wall is subjected
to the full water pressure corresponding to its depth. It is
likewise subjected to a thrust from the earth, corresponding to
and

,
for the saturated material, but with a weight per cubic foot equal
to that of the earth in air less the buoyant effect of the water. Thus,

[
439
]

if a cubic foot of the porous earth, in air weighed 90Â lb., and if the
voids were 40%, then 1Â cu. ft. of earth contains 0.6Â cu. ft. of solids
and the buoyant effect of the water is the weight of an equal volume
of water or

lb. Hence, the weight per cubic foot
of earth in water is

lb.

Similarly, for the pressures,
and
,
at the top of a tunnel,

must be replaced by 52.5, and
and
must be found for the
saturated material and these values substituted in
EquationsÂ (5)
and

(6)
of the Appendix. To these pressures must be added the corresponding
water pressures for the full height of water, supposing it
to have free communication everywhere, as in the case of the gravel
filling. However, with sand, or earth with much fine material, the
pores are more or less clogged up and there is perhaps intimate contact
of a part of the earth with the roof of the tunnel, so that the
water cannot get under it to produce a lifting effect, and if such
intimate contact is found along any horizontal or vertical section,
of the earth on either side of the section, it is plain that the buoyant
effort of the water on a cubic foot of material will be much diminished.

Mr.Â Meem deserves great credit, not only for calling attention
to this, but especially for performing certain experiments to prove
it.
[Footnote
14
]

The experiments were on sand, and only on a small scale,
but the practical conclusion drawn from them is that the water pressure
transmitted through sand having 40% voids is diminished about
40% in intensity. This occurs for a depth of only a few inches
of sand, and presumably the diminution would be greater for sand
several feet in depth. Of course, before definite values can be stated,
experiments on a large scale should be made on every kind of material
usually met; but, as a numerical illustration of the application, for
the diminution mentionedâwhich is assumed to extend through the
massâit is seen that, in the examples of the retaining wall and also
the tunnel, the weight per cubic foot of the earth in water must now
be taken at

lb. per cu.Â ft.

This value replaces the
in
EquationsÂ (5)
and
(6)
from which
the
and
for the top of the tunnel are found. To these values,
add
,
for the water pressure, where the surface of the
water extends a height,
,
above the top of the tunnel. Similarly, in
the case of the retaining wall, add 0.4 of the full water thrust on
the wall to that given by the earth, weighing only 75Â lb. per cu.Â ft.

[
440
]
As a numerical illustration, take

ft.,
,

in air

lb.,

ft.,

ft.; but we must now replace
by the
weight in water, 75Â lb., as found above. The values of
and
are
now found, by
EquationsÂ (5)
and
(6)
(Appendix), to be 1 917 and
246Â lb. per sq.Â ft., respectively, for the saturated earth alone. To these
values add

lb. per sq.Â ft., water pressure,
giving a total of 3 417 and 1 746Â lb. per sq.Â ft., respectively, for the
vertical and horizontal unit pressures at the top of the tunnel lining.

In connection with this subject of underground pressures, it may
not be inappropriate to make some concluding remarks on the maximum
vertical pressures to which culverts may be subjected.

Let
Fig.Â 16
now represent a longitudinal vertical section along
the axis of a road embankment, built over an arch culvert or box-drain,

,
the line,
,
passing through the summit of the arch
or the top of the covering stone of the box-drain, and the lines,

and
,
coinciding in part with the exterior sides of the abutments.

There is a horizontal thrust of the earth on the medial plane,

,
acting at right angles to the plane of the paper, which tends to
distribute the weight of the central portion partly toward the sides;
but, ignoring this, it is seen that, if the earth everywhere settles uniformly,
the maximum pressure per square unit at the top of the
culvert is
,
and the total vertical pressure on the culvert is the
weight of the earth vertically aboveÂ it.

If, however, the earth outside the abutment walls settles more than
the walls (a case which may occur), then part of its weight, and
that of the earth vertically above it, will be transferred, through
friction and cohesion, along the planes,
and
,
to the culvert,
and thus the vertical pressure on the top of the culvert will be greater
than in the first supposed case; but, if the reverse obtains, or if the
culvert settles more than the earth outside the lines,
and
,
or
if the arch or covering stone descends in the middle relatively to the
abutments, then part of the weight of the earth vertically over the
culvert is transferred to the sides. For a comparatively rigid arch,
the settlement is perhaps not enough to warrant us in making the
maximum unit pressure less than
.
Exactly what settlement would
warrant the use of the theory set forth in the Appendix it is impossible
to say. If the unit pressure is taken as
,
we can rest
assured that in most cases the real pressure is materially less.

APPENDI
X.

In the experiments of Jamieson and Pleissner on the pressures
in deep grain bins
[Footnote
15
]

, the ratio,
,
of the lateral unit pressure,
,
on
a vertical plane to the vertical unit pressure,
,
on a horizontal
plane, was found by Pleissner to vary from 0.3 to 0.5 and by Jamieson
to equal 0.6, for wheat in wooden bins of various sizes.

This ratio,
,
increases somewhat with the depth of the
grain, but the increase is slight after a depth of from 2Â½ to 3 times
the width or diameter of the bin is reached.

It is recognized that the proper value of
,
for a particular case,
can only be determined properly by experiment, but it is interesting
to note that, by the theory of earth pressure of an unlimited granular
mass, level at the top, the ratio of the lateral to the vertical unit
pressure, at any point in the mass, is,
,
and that
this varies from 0.361 to 0.271, as
,
the angle of repose, varies
from 28Â° to 35Â°, the values of
for wheat, given in some of the
experiments. Further, by reference to Jamiesonâs experiments on a
model bin of smooth steel, 1Â ft. in diameter,
[Footnote
16

filled with sand, for
which
,

,
we find the experimental
value of
to equal
exactly for a height of sand of 2.5Â ft.,
the value at 6Â ft. and upward being 0.33.

The theory of bin pressure is utterly different from the ordinary
theory of earth pressure in an unlimited granular mass; but it is
seen that the latter may be of some use in furnishing a value of

when experimental values are lacking, as in the case of various
kinds of earth, both granular and more or less consolidated.

and is as

This reduces to the usual formula when

that the horizontal ordinates of the triangle,

Next consider the case of a tunnel of width,
,
and length,
,

which has been driven by shield or by use of timbering, so that an
appreciable settlement of the roof occurs; then the weight of the earth
vertically over the tunnel is partly
carried by the adjacent walls of
earth, by friction and cohesion,
and it would seem that such walls
can be supposed to take the place
of vertical grain bin walls, and
that the theory of bin pressures
corresponding may be made to
apply. The theory that will be
developed, which includes the influence
of cohesion, is simply a
modification of that used in
developing Janssenâs formula, as
given by Mr.Â Ketchum,

and, for
a ready comparison of results, his notation will be used.

An additional note with respect to
EquationÂ (1)
may not be inappropriate.
Scheffler, in deriving this equation, considered the conditions
of equilibrium of an infinitesimal wedge of earth at the depth,

.
It was found that the horizontal pressure at the depth,
,
given
by
EquationÂ (3)
, was zero, and it was assumed by the writer that
there was no pressure on a vertical plane for a less depth. Thus, in

[
447
]

Fig.Â 21
, there is no horizontal pressure on the plane,
,
where
;
consequently, the weight of the wedge,
,
is supported
entirely by the normal reaction of the plane,
,
with the
cohesion and friction acting along it.
[Footnote
20
]

To deduce
,
the total earth
pressure on the vertical plane,
,
it is then admissible to treat the
prism,
,
as the prism of rupture, the surface of rupture consisting
of the plane,
,
making the angle
with the vertical and
the plane,
.
Therefore
,
the weight of the prism,
,
is in
equilibrium with
,

,
and
,
where

of

,
and
the
total cohesion on

On balancing components parallel and perpendicular to the plane,
and then following familiar methods, it can be shown that the true
value of
corresponds to
,
and that this value is,

Fig. 21.

The derivative of this, with respect
to
,
gives the intensity,
,
at the
depth,
,
exactly the same as
EquationÂ (1)
,
and the subsequent deductions
hold. Thus the fundamental

EquationÂ (1)
, according to the interpretation
given, is seen to correspond
to a prism of rupture,
,
which
is a little nearer the true one, having a curved surface of rupture,
than the wedge,
.

The above refers to the pressure on a vertical plane of a mass
of level-topped earth of indefinite extent; but suppose that
is
the back of a retaining wall, and that a slight movement downward of
the prism of rupture is imminent; then, if the earth along the plane,

[
448
]

,
can exert sufficient tension, the mass,
,
in descending,
may drag down the wedge,
,
with it, so that the full friction
and cohesion along
will be added to that along
.
In other
words, the prism of rupture must now be taken as the wedge,
;

hence, the value of
corresponding is given by the equation above, on
making
,
as this introduces, in the first equations for equilibrium,
the fact that the prism of rupture is now the wedge,

It is only one step farther to find the greatest height at which the
vertical face of an open trench will stand for given coefficients,

On making
in the equation for

we find, after reduction,

a value which has been quoted elsewhere in this paper. It is double
the value for

EquationÂ (3)
. The reason for this, though,
is now evident; for the last equation follows as a consequence of
assuming that the full cohesive and frictional resistances along

were exerted; whereas
EquationÂ (1)
ignores them.

It may be well to remark here, that for cohesive earth, it has been proved, both theoretically
and experimentally, that the surface of rupture is curved, and not a plane, as
the theory assumes. However, assuming it to be a plane, and considering successive
wedges of rupture of different heights, the bases of which lie on the same plane, it can be
easily shown that certain of the upper wedges can be sustained by cohesion alone, and that
the coefficient of cohesion required for stability varies from 0 at the surface to its maximum
value at a certain depth,
.
Below this depth, friction in addition to cohesion is
exerted, and stability is assured if we suppose the friction coefficient to increase from 0 at

to its maximum value,
,
at some depth,
.
Below this depth, on the plane
of rupture, the maximum values of both coefficients are exerted. Now, the ordinary wedge
theory assumes, for simplicity, that these coefficients are constant all along the plane of
rupture, which may be true at the instant of rupture, but not for a stable mass. It is
possible, too, that rupture may be progressive, starting at the bottom.

DISCUSSIO
N.

J.Â R. Worcester, M.Â Am. Soc. C.Â E.
(by letter).â In reading Professor
Cainâs admirable paper relating to experiments on retaining
walls, the writer has looked in vain for a word of caution as to
the effect which time plays in modifying the condition of equilibrium
within a mass of earth. The author evidently considers it necessary to
allow (by using a factor of safety) for a possible lessening of the
angle of friction on account of a change in the amount of moisture,
and possible vibrations, but states that in a great majority of cases
the greatest thrust will occur where the earth has been recently
deposited. It would appear that he neglects a possibility, if not a
probability, of a readjustment of the earth particles through the influence
of time, by which the angle of friction is lessened if not wholly
cancelled.

The theory that cohesion in the earth and frictional resistance on
the back of the retaining wall account for the experimental results
seems indisputable, but such experiments must needs be carried through
in a reasonable time, and, in that respect, at least, must needs differ
from actual constructions which are intended to be permanent.

It is well known that unbraced excavations can often be carried
vertically to considerable depths in safety, but that not infrequentlyâ as
many have learned to their sorrowâ such unbraced banks have subsequently
caved in. The slides in the Culebra cut may be mentioned
as a similar illustration. To be sure, the delayed motion of the earth
(or rock) may be attributed to the effect of moisture, but that does
not invalidate the argument, as one always has to reckon with water.

It is also a matter of common knowledge that, in braced excavations,
the pressure on the sheeting and bracing frequently increases
in time to an extent enormously exceeding the original pressure. In
many instances this has caused a failure long delayed.

Another instance of the effect of time is found in many retaining
walls, in which a very slow motion has occurred, though the
walls appeared to be entirely stable when first built.

A frictional or tangential force along the back of the wall may
tend to prevent motion, but it is difficult to conceive of this tangential
force being perpetually present on the back of a stationary wall after
the back-filling has become settled and consolidated. In the interior
of the mass of earth at rest the author admits that the reaction between
particles is not along inclined lines, but rather that the lines
of pressure are vertical and horizontal. The vertical lines of force
are, of course, caused by gravity, and the horizontal lines by the
tendency of particles to wedge in between those below and to spread
them.

[
450
]
If this conception of the forces within a mass of earth is reasonable,
it would seem as if it might also be extended to the pressure
against an immovable vertical wall. One must then consider whether
it is possible for a horizontal pressure to cause the wall to move,
without changing the conditions and introducing the inclined stresses.
It would seem within the bounds of possibility that a very minute
motion might be produced, and that this would be followed by a
readjustment of stresses in the earth by which the forces would gradually
resume the horizontal direction.

The nature of the soil undoubtedly has much to do with this question.
In some kinds of clay there appears to be a sort of viscosity, such
as is frequently seen in pitch and other materials, or a tendency toward
a slow flowing. No amount of pressure would cause a sudden motion,
but time will effect a motion under a slight pressure or even the force
of gravity alone. It appears that this condition is produced by the
very minute particles, each moving individually into a position in
which the surrounding forces balance. If one cuts a vertical face
in such material one cannot force the exposed particles out of their
position by crowding them from behind, but each in its turn will
feel the pressure unbalanced and will slowly move out. This may not
be true to the same extent with granular materials of large diameter,
but a familiar instance is seen in fine wet sand. If a small excavation
is dug in a wet beach sand, the banks will stand vertically at first,
but, by watching closely, one may see the particles, beginning at the
foot of the bank where there is most water, gradually moving out,
overcoming the force of cohesion, and ever tending to seek a condition
with a level surface. It seems quite likely that a similar tendency
would exist in almost all soils, to greater or less degree, though perhaps
it might be safely neglected in a mass of hard, irregularly-shaped
fragments of stone which could interlock.

The point which the writer wishes to make is that a word of caution
should accompany this argument for the frictional and cohesive
forces; that they cannot always be relied on; and that sometimes
the Rankine theory may be better than the wedge theory in designing,
even though it does not seem to fit the experimental results.

Another warning may not be amiss, in considering the safe thickness
to allow for retaining walls, and that is the effect of frost, where
the surface of the ground is level and likely to retain moisture. The
swelling force of freezing, under these circumstances, may be more
than sufficient to overcome the beneficial effects of both cohesion and
friction. Presumably this must be provided for in the âfactor of
safety,â and is in itself a justification for a very appreciable factor.

It may be well to emphasize the fact that a large part of the
authorâs assumed factor of safety seems to be absorbed in keeping
the resultant within the middle third of the base. The proportions

[
451
]

between width of wall and height, determined on
pages 433
and 434,
are such as to keep this resultant just within the base. If, with
these same proportions of wall, the factor were assumed so that the
resultant were within the middle third, it would be found to be nearer
1Â¼ than 3. The authorâs statement on
pageÂ 435
, that he âdoes not
advocate the middle-third limit method in design,â is not wholly clear,
but the implication is that the resultant should be well within this
limit. In this case, it seems as if the factor of safety would be wholly
absorbed in thus locating the resultant, and would leave nothing for
other elements of uncertainty.

J.Â C. MEEM, M.Â Am. Soc. C.Â E.
(by letter).âIn the writerâs judgment
the author has gone a step forward in developing the relation
of cohesion and friction to walls and tunnels, but he has not given
sufficient value to the larger consideration of what may be called
âcohesive frictionâ induced by the lateral pressure of earth against
retaining walls and other faces. This will be noted later in the discussion.

The author states that âfrom all that precedes, it is seen that the
results of experiments on small models in the past have proved to be
very misleading, and that experiments on large models are desirable,
and can alone give confidence.â
[Footnote
21
]

To a certain extent this is fully in
accordance with the writerâs views, as noted in his papers on earth
pressures,
[Footnote
22
]

and he feels justified in once more calling attention to the
fact that, in his judgment, the only experiments which can definitely
establish the value of earth pressures against walls and sheeted faces
should be made on a large scale and against independently laid and
independently braced horizontal sheeting. If these experiments are
made in a homogeneous material, such as dry sand of a known angle
of repose, it is believed that it will be conclusively and definitely shown
that the pressures at a point above the middle plane will be greater
than below it, and, further, that it will be proved that the pressure
near the bottom, for example, of a 20-ft. trench, will not be perceptibly
greater than that against a brace at the same distance from the bottom
of a 40- or a 60-ft. trench.

The writer agrees with the author that the theory of a sliding wedge
is the best practical one for retaining walls, and if the face of the wedge
be keyed tight, as stated by the author, or through the compacting
of the material into a more solid mass, it will be seen that, with no
break, the resultant pressures against the wall or face are virtually
those, not only of a sliding, but of a solid wedge tending to slide on
the plane of repose, the mass being compactly held together by cohesion

[
452
]

induced by lateral pressure. Although the general solidity of this
mass is dependent on the stability of the wall or bracing, the pressures
caused by the tendency of this solid wedge to slide are not affected
materially by slight changes in form due to gradual settlement, which,
in turn, may be caused by the normal yielding of the wall or shrinkage
of the bracing, or by any small losses of material, as long as any
of those or their sum is not sufficient to cause partial or final collapse.
Assuming then that this theory of the solid wedge tending to slide
is the true one, it is difficult to reconcile it with the results of experiments
on revolving boards or revolving walls, except in so far as they
relate to the more accurate determination of the coefficients of friction
and cohesion.

In connection with the experiments of Leygue, the writer wishes
to refer to the dry sand and wheat arching experiments described in
the final discussion of his paper, âThe Bracing of Trenches and Tunnels,
with Practical Formulas for Earth Pressures,â
[Footnote
23
]

and especially
to the experiment made with dry sand in a 2-in. pipe, described in his
paper on âPressure, Resistance, and Stability of Earth.â
[Footnote
24
]

For clearer
reference, the latter experiment is again described:

A 2-in. pipe, 18Â in. long, was filled with dry sand for a depth of
12Â in., and a thin piece of tissue paper was pasted across the bottom.
Then, with a wooden piston bearing on the sand, the latter would
support the blow of a sledge hammer or the weight of a man without
breaking the tissue paper.

All these experiments seem to prove very clearly that pressure
is distributed laterally, at least through perfectly dry material, and,
with certain values known, it should not be difficult to compute the
value of this thrust. For example, if, in the pipe experiment, the
exact coefficient of friction of the granular particles against the inside
of the pipe is determined to be 0.4, then it would take a pressure
equal to the complement of this, or 0.6 of the weight, to hold the
granular particles against the vertical side. Now, if the exact depth
of sand is determined at which no further pressure (by reason of adding
to this depth) is transmitted to the bottom, then, by finding the difference
or loss of pressure at the bottom, it should be a simple matter
to compute the amount of thrust developing sufficient friction over
the given area to sustain the additional weight. This is what the
writer, for want of a better term, has called âcohesive frictionâ induced
by lateral pressure. While such experiments on a small scale give
definite results with very dry sand or wheat, they will not be conclusive
unless made on a very large scale in cases where dampness
adds materially to the normal cohesion of small masses.

As to the experiments on revolving boards or walls referred to by

[
453
]

the author, it would appear that, as noted, they eliminate consideration
of the effect of pressure as increasing the values of the coefficient
of friction and cohesion.

The writer believes that it can be shown by
Fig.Â 22
that the lateral
pressure against sheeted faces or retaining walls is greater toward the
top.
Fig.Â 22
is adapted from Fig.Â 5 in the writerâs paper, âPressure,
Resistance, and Stability of Earth.â

Fig. 22.

It is supposed that a retaining wall has first been built along the
face,
,
and that it has been back-filled with ordinary dry sand to the
curved line
;
this is then covered with a heavy canvass or tarpaulin,
and RodsÂ 1, 2, 3, etc., are run through it in sufficient numbers
to hold it in position when the area,
,
has been back-filled with
dry sand. The tarpaulin is then keyed up tight by the rods bearing
on washers of large area on the top plane,
.
If the sand in the area,

,
be then removed, the observer is asked to note whether, in
his judgment, the resulting pressure is greater at
or at
.
It must
undoubtedly be true that if this
experiment establishes the writerâs
claim in the case of normally dry
sand, it will tend to do so much
more readily in the case of mixed
sands and earths as ordinarily
found in trenches. If this fact of
the greater pressure toward the top
be proved conclusively, as the
writer believes it undoubtedly will
be in time, it may account for some
of the failures of retaining walls.

It seems that in order to accord
our views to the theory of greater
pressure at the bottom, we must assume that any given area of the
face of a wall is borne on by a prism of material reaching to the top
of the bank, and that its pressure is measured by the weight of its
cross-section by some multiple of its length. A few moments spent
in examining the face of a tunnel drift, or sheeted trench in sharp
sand or loam, will convince any one that this cannot be true. In effect,
the face of a sheeted trench resists the pressure of what may be termed
a series of vertical groined arches, the braces being at the various abutments
and the sheeting supporting the more or less loose material
between. In no other way can the fact be explained that individual
sheeting planks may frequently be removed for a short time without
danger, even when the bracing shows evidence of very heavy pressure;
whereas the removal of even a single brace may cause collapse.

A few years ago the writer was called to examine a 44-ft. trench
which had collapsed. While it will probably never be known definitely

[
454
]

how or where the failure first occurred, it may be of interest to note
that within 50Â ft. of the break and under conditions apparently similar
to those which had existed there previously, the writer found intermediate
sheeting planks near the bottom, behind which the pressure
was not sufficient to force them out against the rangers, whereas no
one could for a moment doubt that there was pressure against the
braces or on the sheeting directly behind them. In order, then, that
experiments on retaining walls or sheeted faces may be of value, the
pressures must be measured against areas absolutely independent of
each other; and the writer believes that this can best be done as stated
heretofore.

The author
states
:

âHowever, if, from any cause, such as insufficient sheeting, the
break has taken place over even a part of
,
the mass,
,
above
will tend to tip over at the top, giving the greatest pressure on the
top braces. This appears to explain the phenomena observed by Mr.Â Meem
and others in connection with some trenches.â

The writer thinks it is unfortunate that the author has not had an
opportunity of visiting with him many trenches in which no break
had occurred, and yet in which the bracing had to be strengthened
continually near the top. This was especially true of a horizontally
sheeted and braced shaft of large area. The writer believes that
it is not out of place to express the hope that the author may still
change his viewpoint, and may eventually regard only as phenomena
well-braced trenches which in sand or gravel do not show evidences of
heavier pressure near the top.

Referring now to tunnel pressures, the author
states
:

âIf there was no settlement of the earth,
,
in relation to

,
*Â *Â *  but, as most of the weight of
is carried by
the sides, in case of sufficient settlement, the vertical unit pressure,

,
on
,
will be much less than
.
â

The writer would criticize this view because it brings in the element
of settlement as essential to its conclusions, and, therefore, is
contrary to his belief that all earth is under stable conditions due to the
lateral transmission of thrust due to weight, thereby causing the âcohesive
frictionâ previously noted. This transmission of thrust results
in what may be termed âarching stability,â which is unchanged when
small areas of hard, dry ground are undermined. When normally dry
soft ground is disturbed, however, there is a gradual settlement of
tiers of strata, and as those above are, in turn, left without support,
they settle on what may be termed a new centering and form themselves
into new arches. If these strata are composed of sand and
gravel, with little natural cohesion, the action of this settlement will
be similar to that observed in an hour-glass and will âworkâ to the

[
455
]

surface in a short time. It should be noted, however, that as the
voids below are filled and solidified by the pressure, the lateral thrust
of this pressure causes the arching tendencies to be resumed again in
each successive stratum, relieving the lower strata of the pressure or
shock of fall from those above.

The tables given by the author on
Figs. 17
and 18, show that the
pressure per square foot on the roof of a 15-ft. tunnel at a depth of
150Â ft., for instance, is approximately double that on the same tunnel
at a 50-ft. depth. This assumption is not justified by any facts which
have ever come under the writerâs notice or have been brought to his
attention. The observation of any tunneling operations in soft normally
dry ground, or the examination of existing structures, will convince
any one that, after a depth of approximately twice the greatest diameter
of opening has been reached, it is impossible to tell, by any difference
in the pressure, the depth of the tunnel. While numberless instances
could be cited to illustrate this fact, two which have come under the
writerâs notice may be of interest.

In the case of a 15-ft. tunnel passing the bed of an old underground
stream, a considerable amount of ground was lost through
the influx of sand which came in with the water. For several days
after this the writer examined the surface directly overhead for evidences
of settlement, and after some 4 or 5 days he found a hole
some 12Â ft. in diameter and 8 or 10Â ft. deep, which was at once filled
in. Had the mass of earth of this area and some 20 to 60Â ft. high
come down on the timbering suddenly, without any intervening âarch
cushion,â it would undoubtedly have crushed it; and yet none of the
night men had been conscious of even the slightest shock.

In the other case, a heavy rain had caused a large pond to form
over the heading of a 15-ft. tunnel, and before it could be drained away
it broke through the unprotected face of the heading, virtually filling
the whole tunnel with sand for some distance. This, however, had not
caused the collapse of any of the bracing, and, before work could be
resumed, it was necessary to re-excavate the material. This material
was used to fill in the hole caused by the cave-in, and when operations
were finally resumed, about 10 days later, the sectional shields, which
had remained in position undisturbed, were started with less than
the ordinary pressure, as indicated by the gauge on the hydraulic
pump.

The writer confidently believes that the assumption behind the
reasoning by which the table in
Fig.Â 17
was made is fallacious, and
that the fallacy is found in the following quotations:

â
In answering this question
, it must be remembered that, of the
weight of earth directly over the tunnel, all has been transferred to
the sides that it was possible to transfer, for the coefficients of friction
and cohesion given. We know scarcely anything of the cohesion

[
456
]

coefficients, so that the value assumed,

lb. per sq.Â ft., may not
be near the truth. Certainly it must appear plain from this discussion
that the values of
and
must be better known, for all kinds of
earth, before reliable results can be attained.â

* * * * * * * * *

â
In reality
, an arch or dome of the earth should be considered in
place of the horizontal stratum, but the result is the same, because
the same vertical forces act in either case.â

* * * * * * * * *

â
Referring
to
Fig.Â 20
, it is evident that the maximum limit of

would be realized if the weight of any horizontal lamina is entirely
held up by the friction and cohesion of the sides;Â *Â *Â *â

* * * * * * * * *

â
As seen
, such a state is not exactly realized, but is practically
true for great depths.â

Fig. 23.

Referring to the last quotation,
the writer would go further and say
that if the assumption is true that
the spaces above a tunnel are considered
as a series of horizontal
layers dependent on the natural
coefficient of friction and cohesion
(not added to by pressure) to hold
them up, that it would appear to be
far preferable to calculate always
on full pressure to the top than to
assume that some of these strata
may be sustained by what would
appear to the writer to be largely
chance conditions.

It would appear that the author has considered cohesion and friction
only as normally found in exposed faces, and as they would be
developed between contiguous vertical columns of earth through which
pressures were transmitted laterally; and, in tunnels as against vertical
faces, he does not appear to have given sufficient weight to the
essential factor that cohesion and friction, combined into what the
writer has previously termed âcohesive friction,â are increased by the
pressure in some definite relation toÂ it.

If, for example, on a tunnel section,
,

Fig.Â 23
, a centering
or core of sand,
,
is assumed, and over this a mass,
,

composed of magnetic particles which cause them to adhere
to each other, it is not difficult to conceive that a thickness at the key,

,
would be reached where the core,
,
could be removed. The
same result, approximately, may be reached by assuming that the

[
457
]

mass is sand or earth and is supported by the core,
.
As, however,
in this case the lower part of the arch along
is composed
of loose material, the support of some of it must be provided for in
the area where the blending of the arch and the core is indeterminate.
This supported area is arbitrarily assumed to be
,
or half

,
the point,
,
being determined as far as possible by
experiment to be at the intersection of the vertical,
,
and the line,

,
bisecting the angle between that of repose and the vertical. These
general deductions, exclusive of the exact determination of the location
of the point,
,
appear to be borne out by all the experiments
previously noted and others in the writerâs papers hereinbefore referred
to, and in the authorâs observations on grain bins, as noted in
the following
quotation
from his paper:

âIn the many experiments on high grain bins, the enormous influence
of the friction of the grain against the vertical walls or sides of
the bin has been observed. In fact, the greater part of the weight of
grain, even when running out, is sustained by the walls through this
side friction. This furnishes another argument for including wall
friction in a retaining-wall design.â

Not only is this âan argument for including wall friction,â but it
seems to prove that this friction is increased relatively to the pressure,
and that under stable conditions coherence is also induced by the pressure
and friction.

The writer is much gratified to find that the author concurs in
the view that the area of water pressure is reduced in subaqueous
tunnels and other submerged structures in sand or earth, and he concurs
heartily with the author that experiments on a large scale, to
determine the values of this reduction definitely with relation to the
various materials, will be of the greatest value to the Profession.

William Cain, M.Â Am. Soc. C.Â E.
(by letter).âThe writer is
gratified by Mr.Â Worcesterâs words of commendation. The walls or
boards subjected to earth pressure were of various inclinations, and
the surface slope of the earth was equally varied. A theory which
stands the test of experiments in such variety seems to be pretty
well established. If the various theories that have been proposed from
time to time were subjected to this test, how many would survive?
And yet no theory can claim to be a practical one unless it is found
to agree fairly well with experiments. Mr.Â Worcester seems to think
that the effect of time on retaining walls ought to be included. The
effort was made to do this, by using a factor of safety and by multiplying
only the normal component of the thrust on the wall by this
factor, taken as 3 for ordinary cases; where the effect of frost is decided,
the factor should be increased, and the back of the wall, for
say 3 or 4Â ft. down from the top, should be sloped forward to allow

[
458
]

the earth, in the expansion incident to freezing, to push its way up the
inclined plane corresponding.

If railway trains pass near a retaining wall, their weight should
be replaced by an equal weight of earth, which is regarded as dead
weight in computing the thrust. Vibration probably increases the
thrust, and this increase moves the top of the wall over slightly,
on account of the yielding of the earth foundation about the outer
toe. On account of the imperfect elasticity of earth, this deformation
may remain and increase in time, and thus lead to the
ultimate failure of the wall. This lack of spring, or recovery, in
the earth foundation, is probably the main cause of the increased
leaning of walls with time. The remedy is to build a foundation
course of masonry, projecting in front of the wall, of such width
that the true resultant on its base shall pass through its center.
The base, too, should be inclined, in order to prevent sliding. Of
course, efficient drainage must be secured by the use of weep-holes
and perhaps drains back of the wall.

Mr.Â Worcester is of the opinion that the friction against the
back of the wall is not a permanent feature, and suggests the Rankine
formula as possibly a better one for design. For a surcharge of
sufficient inclination, and especially when it slopes at the angle of
repose, the Rankine thrust involves more friction at the back of
the wall than the method illustrated in
Fig.Â 15
, where only one-third
of the friction is used for ordinary cases; but, even granting,
for the sake of argument, that at some time this friction is null
and that subsequently rains and vibration cause an increased thrust,
then the top of the wall moves over slightly, the earth will again get
its frictional grip on the wall, so that this friction is always exerted
when required for stability.

It is, perhaps, customary to design a wall so that the resultant
on its base shall pass one-third of the width of base from the outer
toe. This procedure gives very different factors of safety, as hitherto
defined, for different types of walls. The writerâs method aims to
give equal security to all ordinary walls, by using a constant factor
of safety.

The writer is gratified that Mr.Â Meem has again recorded some
of his valuable experiences, but regrets that he cannot regard some
of his theories as convincing. With regard to the center of pressure
on a retaining wall backed by fresh earth, Mr.Â Meem maintains that
the intensity of pressure increases from the bottom upward, so that
the center of pressure lies above the horizontal plane drawn at mid-height.
This view has been shown to be untrue by experiment.
Thus:

(1) Leygue, in the experiments referred to on
page 420
, found
the value of the moment of the earth thrust about the inner toe,

[
459
]

and also determined the plane of rupture. Using the corresponding
wedge of rupture, the writer computed the normal component of
the thrust. On dividing the moment by this, the distance of the center
of pressure from the base was found to be, as an average, for all
experiments on sand, 0.34 of the height, and for millet seed, 0.405
of the height.
[Footnote
25
]

(2) The easily made experiment of Mr.Â Gifford
[Footnote
26
]

on the deflection
of a cardboard retaining wall shows that the resultant thrust
lies nearer the base than the top of the wall.

(3) All the experiments discussed on
pages 407
â427 agree with the
latter statement.

(4) The resultant earth thrust on a wall must approach indefinitely
water thrust as
approaches zero. The latter is known to act at
one-third of the height above the base.

(5) If a triangular wedge of rupture is assumed, it follows inevitably
that the unit pressure increases with the depth, and that the
resultant acts at one-third of the height above the base. This follows
because the total pressure then varies with the square of the
height, as in water pressure.

(6) Let the contrary be assumedâthat the pressure increases from
the base upwardâthen, in a great depth of earth, the pressure at
the top would be enormous enough to crush the hand if thrust in
the earth. As everyone knows, the pressure on the hand is very
slight, and this shows the absurdity of the hypothesis.

It may be stated now that the proposed experiment, referring to

Fig.Â 22
, would not prove Mr.Â Meemâs contention. For, if the earth
below
was removed, the thrust on
would have to be sufficient
to prevent the whole mass,
,
from descending, which is far
greater than
,
which balances only the thrust of the wedge of
rupture, the inclined base of which passes
through
.

A conclusive experiment could be made on a high retaining wall,
backed by sand or grain (not in a bin, but unconfined except by the
wall) after Jamiesonâs manner in the case of grain bins, by inserting
the rubber diaphragms, etc., at various points from the top
down, and measuring the pressures.

In respect to the distribution of pressure, the theory of the sheeted
trench differs materially from that of the retaining wall. Much
confusion has arisen from confounding them. On that account, and
to meet many interesting points made by Mr.Â Meem, the writer
will give a thorough discussion of retaining walls and sheeted or
unsheeted trenches, backed by coherent earth.

Fig. 24.

For an unlimited mass of level-topped earth, having both friction
and cohesion, but ignoring the cohesion along the vertical plane,
,

[
460
]

Fig.Â 24
, it was shown in the Appendix that
the horizontal pressure on a vertical plane,

,
is that due to a certain prism,
,

and that its total amount, in pounds,
is
,

where
is the weight in pounds of 1Â cu. ft.
of the earth,
is the cohesion of the earth,
in pounds per square foot,
,

The plane,
,
is found to bisect the angle between the natural
slope and the vertical when
is horizontal, as shown by
Fig.Â 24
.

The value of
is given just below
EquationÂ (4)
in the Appendix.
It acts at
above the base, since the distribution of stress on

is linear.

It follows, because
EquationÂ (7)
is the usual one for the thrust of
non-coherent earth of depth
,
that the total horizontal stress on

of the earth endowed with cohesion, is exactly the same as that due
to the same earth, but devoid of cohesion, having a free horizontal
surface,
,
extended indefinitely in both directions, at a depth
,

as given by
EquationÂ (8)
, below the original free surface. The
theory ignores any possible cohesion acting upward along
,

or any tension in the mass that may possibly drag down part of
the wedge,
,
and thus decrease the
thrust,
.

The formula is thus seen to give a thrust greater than the true
one, or what may be called an upper limit. To realize the hypothesis
more clearly, it may be said that if a vertical crack in the earth
is assumed along
,
the resulting value of
will be the same as
that given by
EquationÂ (7)
. It is a fact of observation that sometimes
earth which has been saturated and then dried out, cracks
along one or more vertical planes. This indicates tension in the
mass, which is overcome, however, at certain points (only) and thus
vertical cracks appear.

In the construction of
Fig.Â 11
, the full friction and cohesion which
can be exerted on the length,
(of
Fig.Â 24
), is supposed to be
exerted. This construction then gives a lower limit to the thrust.
As to which hypothesis will lead to the most probable value, it may
be observed that the broken line of rupture,
,

Fig.Â 24
, is nearer
the true curved line of rupture (which is assigned both by theory
and the facts of observation) than the straight line,
;
hence, the
hypothesis leading to
EquationÂ (7)
seems to be the more probable
one.

[
461
]
In the case of the open trench, suppose
to be a vertical side
of the trench; if
lies below the level of
,
and a crack exists along

,
then, undoubtedly, the mass,
,
will move to the left, because
there is an unbalanced force,
,
to cause the motion.

The vertical height of an unsupported bank, where vertical cracks
occur of depth
,
will then be that given by
EquationÂ (8)
, which is
one-half the value usually given. This is generally an extreme
lower value; for any earth endowed with much cohesion must be
capable of exerting tension. If the tension exerted is sufficient
to drag down
(which can stand unsupported), that is, if the
wedge,
,
acts as a whole, then the free unsupported height will
be double that given by
EquationÂ (8)
. This is evidently an extreme
upper limit, perhaps rarely attained; for vertical cracks have often
been observed to precede a fall of earth into a vertical trench.
For
,

,
and

ft.,
EquationÂ (8)
gives
,

whereas the usual equation gives

lb. per sq.Â ft. The
true value is possibly between these two extremes.

Fig. 25.

Recurring again to earth pressures, the discussion pertaining to

Fig.Â 24
suggests the following modification of the graphical method of

Fig.Â 11
to adapt it to finding the pressures of coherent earth against
retaining walls, for the case supposed above. In
Fig.Â 25
, let
be the

[
462
]

inner face of a retaining board or wall, which is backed by earth with a
horizontal surface
.
The vertical height of the wall is 10Â ft. and
the physical constants are assumed as follows:
,

,
and
.
From
EquationÂ (8)
,

Now lay off, vertically downward from the free surface, a distance,

ft. (to scale) and through
draw a line,
,

parallel to the top surface. By
EquationÂ (7)
, the thrust on any vertical
plane as
,

,
..., is null, and any tension and cohesion
that may actually exist along any of these planes will be ignored.
This is equivalent to supposing vertical cracks along these planes,
which leads to an increase of the thrust and is thus on the side of
safety.

The weights of the successive trial prisms of rupture,
,

,
..., are now laid off to scale, along some vertical, as
.

The successive weights are represented by the vertical lines,
,

,
...,
.
The points
,

,
..., were taken 1Â ft. apart; hence
the area,
the area
,
etc.; so that, after computing
the area
,
the areas
,
etc., can be found by successive
additions. These areas, multiplied by 100, give the weights, in pounds, of
the successive prisms of rupture for 1Â ft. length of wall. As before, two
arcs are drawn with the same radius (
)
, with centers
and

and having laid off the angle,
,
the chords
,

,
...,
are laid off equal to chords
,

,
Â ....
The lines,
,

,
...,
now make angles with the normals to the planes,
,

,
..., respectively,
each equal to
.
Also, lay off the chord,
;
then

gives the direction of the reaction of the wall,
(directly
opposed to the earth thrust), inclined at the angle,
,
to its
normal.

Next, measure, to the scale of distance, the length, in feet, of
any line of rupture, as
.
Multiply this number by
,
to
get the force of cohesion, in pounds, acting up along
,
and lay
it off, to the scale of force, from
,
on a line parallel to
,
to
.

Similarly, lay off the cohesive forces, acting along
,

,
..., at

,

,
..., and from points, such as
,
lines are drawn parallel to
the direction of the thrust,
,
to the intersections with the corresponding
rays,
,

,
.... Suppose
to prove the greatest of these
segments, then
,
to the scale of force, gives the earth thrust
on
,
in pounds. In the present instance, the plane of rupture
lies midway between
and
,
and the corresponding thrust is
1 440Â lb. For purposes of illustration, regard
as the plane of
rupture; then the forces acting on the prism,
,
are represented
by the sides of the closed polygon,

[
463
]

representing its weight,
,
the cohesion acting up along
,

the reaction of the wall, and
the resultant of the normal reaction,

,
of the plane,
,
and the friction,
,
acting along it. As
stated, the actual plane of rupture is found (by drawing one or more
additional trial planes) to lie midway between
and
.

If it should be deemed desirable to include the cohesion acting upward
along the vertical planes,
,
etc., it is very readily done. At each point,
such as
,
draw vertically upward a line of length (to scale of force)

lb., to represent the force of cohesion
acting along the corresponding plane. From the extremities of such
lines, parallels to
are drawn to the intersections with the corresponding
rays, of the type,
.
As before, the greatest of these lines represents
the thrust on
.
Its amount, in this instance, is 1 240Â lb.
It is seen, especially when
is one-half of
or more, that
the change in thrust is quite appreciable.

Lastly, if each plane, as
,
is extended to the surface and considered
to offer full cohesive and frictional resistances throughout
its whole extent, the construction of
Fig.Â 11
applies, and gives a
thrust of 1 220Â lb., practically the previous amount.

As mentioned before, in connection with
Fig.Â 24
, this supposes
sufficient tension in the mass to drag down the triangle,
.
Suppose,
now,
to be the face of a trench which will just stand unsupported
for the height,
,
when the cohesion along
,

,
...,
is included. Then, if, from the drying out of the earth, causing
contraction near the surface and possibly changes in
and
,
cracks
occur along some of these planes, the resistance to motion of the
corresponding prism of rupture is decreased, and the mass will
move down, unless, in the meantime, sufficient bracing has been put
in. This well illustrates what constructors tell us of the importance
of getting in well-keyed-up bracing in time to prevent any crack
from developing, which, as we have seen, largely increases the thrust.
Even when cracks do not appear, a heavy rain, shortly after a trench
is opened, is a frequent cause of falls; evidently because
and possibly

have been very materially decreased.

To compare the results of this very general graphical method with
those given by analysis, as expressed by
EquationsÂ (7)
and
(8)
, let

be taken vertical or coinciding with
,
regard the thrust on

as horizontal, and neglect any cohesion on the vertical planes,

,
etc. Then it is found, for the given constants, that the
graphical method gives exactly the thrust (560Â lb.) obtained from

EquationÂ (7)
. This result was foreseen.

It is likewise interesting to know, if the thrust on
is taken as
parallel to
,
or making the angle,
,
with the normal to
,

that the thrust on
,
as given by the construction, is again found
to be the same (510Â lb.) as that given by a well-known formula for

[
464
]

the thrust on the plane,
,
for earth devoid of cohesion and having
a free surface,
.
The importance of these conclusions lies in this:
that for the wall vertical, the earth surface horizontal, the earth thrust
being horizontal or otherwise, the shorter method is available. If
preferred, the thrust on the wall,
,
for the earth devoid of cohesion,
with the free surface,
,
for either direction of the thrust,
can be evaluated by the graphical methods (
page 404
) hitherto given.

Since this paper was written, RÃ©salâs
âPoussÃ©e des Terres,â
DeuxiÃ¨me Partie
, on Coherent Earths, has appeared.
[Footnote
27
]

In it the
author gives an exhaustive discussion of lines of rupture for a great
number of cases. The equivalent of
EquationÂ (7)
is found for the
case of the horizontal pressure on a vertical plane when the free
surface of earth is horizontal; but it was found to be impracticable
to derive a formula for the earth thrust for the general case of
the earth surface sloping at an angle to the horizontal, the wall
being either inclined or vertical. In fact, for such cases, the intensity
of the earth thrust at any depth is not a linear function of
the depth, as obtains in the case shown by
Fig.Â 24
. Hence RÃ©sal
resorts to the following approximation: Conceive a line drawn parallel
to the surface, at a depth,
(as given by
EquationÂ (8)
), below it,
and regard this line as the free surface of non-coherent earth of the
same specific weight and angle of repose as the given earth; compute
the thrust against the wall for such earth, devoid of cohesion, by methods
pertaining to such earth; the thrust thus found is assumed to be
approximately the true thrust on the wall for the original coherent
earth. It is proper to state that RÃ©sal rejects the sliding-wedge theory
for non-coherent earth, and uses a method of his own, which involves
elaborate tables given in his book. The wedge theory is admittedly
imperfect, mainly because the surface of rupture is a curve, but we
have seen that it agrees with experiments on model walls or retaining
boards, when properly interpreted, and it will be used, as before,
in computing the earth thrusts,
,
below, for earths devoid of cohesion.
The graphical method has already been indicated.
[Footnote
28
]

In
TableÂ 6
comparative results are given for various cases, including
those already examined. Each retaining board was supposed to be
10Â ft. high, the earth to have a natural slope of 1 on 1Â½, and to weigh
100Â lb. per cu.Â ft.

It is seen, by comparing the values of
and
,
in
TableÂ 6
, that,
except for CasesÂ 2 and 3, where the coincidence in the results has been
already noted, the thrusts by the two methods differ very widely, hence
the second method must be rejected, as in some cases undervaluing
the thrust, and in other cases overvaluing it. In CaseÂ 5, where the
surcharge slopes at the angle of repose, the large excess is due principally
to the ordinary theory for computing
,
involving an infinite
plane of rupture, as hitherto noted.

In CaseÂ 6, where the top of the wall leaned toward the earth,

was first assumed equal to 100, but it was found to give no thrust
against the wall; which means that the earth would stand unsupported
at the slope
or with the face making an angle of 18Â°26' with
the vertical, when this face was 10Â ft. high. Hence, a second trial
was made, with
,
with the results shown. It will be noticed
that
was assumed as 18Â°26', so that the thrust was taken horizontal.
In fact, RÃ©sal asserts that the thrust against such a leaning
wall, makes a less angle than
with the normal to the wall.
According to his tables,
,
for this wall cannot exceed 20Â°40'. As
the wall approaches the vertical,

given for a vertical wall. By comparing the thrusts,

and 6, the economy of using the latter type of wall is so apparent
that it is astonishing that constructors do not adopt it oftener.

[

The general conclusion to be drawn from
TableÂ 6
is that, except
for CasesÂ 2 and 3, the general graphical method of
Fig.Â 25
must be
used for accuracy. If applicable to the
case in hand, the cohesion along the vertical
planes,
,
etc., can be included with
very little additional labor. The graphical
treatment given is so general and the theory
involved is so apparent to the eye, that it
seems to commend itself as a practical
treatment of a very complicated problem.

The general method illustrated in

Fig.Â 25
can also be applied to the
surcharged wall of
Fig.Â 26
. Here, the lines,
and
,
are drawn
parallel, respectively, to
and
,
and vertically,

ft.
below them. The trial prisms of rupture are of the type,
.

Their weights are laid off as before, on the line,
,
of
Fig.Â 25
, and
the further construction is exactly as there indicated. It is assumed
here that the slope of
does not exceed the natural slope, for, if it
does, the construction is somewhat altered.

It may be asked whether the construction of
Fig.Â 25
, where the
cohesion on the vertical planes,
,
etc., is omitted, if applied to the
experiments on rotating boards, will appreciably alter the results given
in
TableÂ 3
. The answer is no; for, when
,

,
therefore

ft., or is very small. In fact, as in the experiments, no
cracks were formed, the cohesion on the vertical planes should be included,
which would lead to the results given.

After the thrust, for earth endowed with cohesion, has been computed,
the next question is, at what point on the retaining wall does it
act? This can be answered at once, when the inner face of the wall
is vertical and the earth surface horizontal, for then the earth thrust
acts at
of the height,
,

Figs. 24
and
25
, as hitherto proved. The
case is not so simple when the wall is inclined, either toward or from
the earth. In
Fig.Â 25
, the thrust,
,
on the wall,
,
must be
decomposed into horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal
component is the resultant of the horizontal forces acting from
to

which may be assumed to follow the linear law; hence this component
will act on
at a point, distant
from
,
going from
to
.

The vertical component, similarly, will be regarded as acting on
,

at a distance
from
.
The same approximate rule is suggested
when
lies to the right of the vertical,
.

When the earth surface slopes at the angle of repose, the distribution
of stress is not linear, but more like that shown in
Fig.Â 10
. As the

[
467
]

equation of the corresponding pressure curve cannot be found, an
approximation only can be suggested. When
is (say) less than one
or two tenths, the factor,
,
above, can be used; but as
increases
toward its limit, 1, the factor increases toward some unknown limit.
Probably it does not exceed 0.4 even for
Fig.Â 26
, and, for want of
accurate knowledge on the subject, it may be taken at 0.4 as a rude
approximation.

Finally, when the surface slope is less than the natural slope of
the earth, then as it decreases from
to zero, the factor should.
decrease from the extreme value (say 0.4) to
.
RÃ©sal takes this
factor at
for all cases, which is certainly not on the safe side.

The case of the retaining wall which receives the active thrust of
the earth has been hitherto examined, and next the case of the braced
trench will be discussed. As the trench (having vertical sides) is dug,
the usual sheeting, rangers, and bracing are put in and the bracing is
kept well keyed-up, so as to exert an active pressure on the earth. To
illustrate the theory, in
Fig.Â 25
, let
represent the vertical side of
the trench, the earth extending only to the right of
.
Then from
points such as
,
draw horizontal lines to the intersection with the
corresponding
s;
the longest of these lines, to the scale of force, will
represent the total force that must be exerted by all the braces, per
foot of length of trench, to prevent any motion of the mass. As has
been seen, this force is given by
EquationÂ (7)
. If a still greater force
is exerted by the braces, less than a certain value which would just
cause motion of the earth up some plane of rupture, stability is completely
assured.

As a numerical illustration, assume a trench 40Â ft. deep and 15Â ft.
wide, the constants for the earth being,
,

,

.

Then, by
EquationÂ (8)
,

ft. and

ft.
Hence, by
EquationÂ (7)
, the least force the braces must exert
per linear foot of trench is,

Suppose the braces to be 10Â ft. apart horizontally, and that
there are six braces in the same vertical plane. The least force
that the horizontal braces must exert on 10Â lin. ft. of trench is
188 440Â lb., and if each carries the same stress, the force to be exerted
by one, is

lb. Assuming a unit stress of 800Â lb. per
sq.Â in. for an 8Â by 8-in. wooden brace, 15Â ft. long, it is seen that one

[
468
]

brace can safely exert a force of 51200Â lb., which is greater than the
least amount required, as should be the case to allow for changes in

and
due to heavy rains. To meet such contingencies, 10 by
10-in.

braces are suggested. Of course, very little is now known as to the
coefficient,
,
but, from the observed heights of trenches which have
stood without sheathing, it is probable that values of
from 100 to
300Â lb. per sq.Â ft. can be counted on for most trenching. For the
present, the only safe way is to be guided by experience, such as has
been elicited by Mr.Â Meemâs paper, âThe Bracing of Trenches and
Tunnels, With Practical Formulas for Earth Pressures.â

As to the exact distribution of the stresses, theory cannot speak
definitely, for the conditions are different from those in the case of
the retaining wall, the passive resistance of which opposes the active
earth thrust. For the braced trench, the earth, at first, simply resists
the active pressure exerted by the braces, when first put in and keyed-up
tight, particularly on that upper portion where the active earth
thrust is nothing or very small. As the construction proceeds, the
braces will receive more and more of the active earth thrust, which
necessarily increases with the depth of trench. In fact, the distribution
of stress, indicated by the arrows in
Fig.Â 24
, although true in the
case of a retaining wall, where the earth has been deposited behind
it, is not necessarily or generally true in a sheeted trench, because of
the manner of its construction. Thus, in digging a trench, the bracing
is put in at intervals, but when a brace is inserted near the bottom
of the trench, the digging is continued for several feet without bracing,
until a depth is attained at which it is thought best to insert another
brace. Before the latter is put in, the unprotected face of the trench,
say 6Â ft. in depth, can exert no pressure, as it would in the case of
the retaining wall. The thrust that would be exerted, for this area, on
the supposed wall, does not exist for the unsupported face of the
trench, for the full horizontal thrust of the earth for the whole depth
has been taken up by the braces above the unsupported area. This
state of affairs is characteristic of the work as it proceeds, the lowest
brace that is put in at first carries only the stress due to the keying-up,
but takes more and more stress as the excavation proceeds. It can
thus very well happen that the upper or the middle braces may receive
more stress in the end, than the lower braces. In fact, this was
asserted to be generally true, for well-drained material, by many
engineers in the valuable discussion on Mr.Â Meemâs paper referred to.
Other engineers advised caution in accepting this view, and asserted
that in wet or saturated ground the lower braces were most severely
stressed. If it were possible to force a board of a size equal to the
length and depth of a trench, vertically downward, excavate and brace,
all in a millionth of a second, then one can conceive that the distribution
of stress shown in
Fig.Â 24
might be realized; but, for trenches
as actually constructed, the distribution of stress in the earth mass

[
469
]

is very much altered from this, though it would appear that the total
earth pressure would be given, at least approximately, by the construction
of
Fig.Â 25
, or by the use of
EquationÂ (7)
.

The writer hopes that Mr.Â Meem may agree to the foregoing explanation,
for the subject of trenches was entered into in great detail,
in order to explain, if possible, all the facts, as presented by many
engineers who held very diverse views about the explanation of them.
Mr.Â Meemâs
Fig.Â 22
can illustrate the writerâs view: if bracing only
extends, say, from
to
,
then the braces must exert sufficient horizontal
thrust to prevent the descent of the wedge, say
,
if this
gives the maximum thrust for the coherent earth.

Turning now to pressures on tunnels, the writer is pleased to note
that Mr.Â Meem has recorded some more of his experiences concerning
them. From lack of proper knowledge of the so-called constants,

,

and
,
such experience is an aid in leading to more probable
values.

As the writer proceeds in this investigation, he hopes to make clear
the conception of arch action alluded to, and will derive the limiting
values of
and
in the simple manner outlined briefly in the Appendix.
Before considering these matters, however, it may be well to call
attention to the fact that a vertical prism of earth can be held up by
the cohesion of its sides alone when
is large enough. Take the vertical
prism of depth
and cross-section area
,

Fig.Â 20
, its weight
being
.
In a long tunnel, two sides only can be counted on to
furnish cohesive forces. Call
the perimeter available in any case.
Then the cohesive force is
,
and this alone (without reference to
any friction that may act) will support the prism when,
.

In the long or completed tunnel,
(see notation
of Appendix); but if we take a short section at the heading, say

,
then support can be derived from three sides, and
.

Thus if we assume the horizontal cross-section of the
prism to be 15 by 7.5Â ft.,

lb. per sq.Â ft., where

lb. per cu.Â ft. Thus, such a vertical prism of any height, at
the heading, can be sustained by a cohesion of 338Â lb. per sq.Â ft. acting
on three of its sides. This refers to a tunnel 15Â ft. wide. For the
completed tunnel 15Â ft. wide, the part vertically over the tunnel can
be supported if the two sides can furnish double this unit cohesion.
The term
will appear in an equation mentioned later. It is seen now that when this term is zero, cohesion alone can sustain

[
470
]

the prism, and the pressure reduces to zero. When this term is negative,
it indicates that that too large a value of
has been assumed, for
stability is assured for
.

In reference to
Fig.Â 16
, it was stated that a series of superposed
arches or domes were assumed, but that since the reactions of the
horizontal laminas of
Fig.Â 20
and corresponding arches were the same,
the former were substituted for convenience. If each arch has the
vertical thickness,
,
it will have the same volume and weight,

,
as the horizontal lamina. The reactions marked on
Fig.Â 20

can be assumed to be those of the corresponding arch, and the resultant
of the horizontal and vertical reactions represents the thrust of
the arch at the sides; its direction will be that of the tangent line of
the arch. When
is small, the horizontal reaction is much greater
than the vertical one, and the arches are all very flat. Now, considering
the whole series of arches, it is plain that the greatest or limiting
value of
(call it simply
)
would be realized if the weight of any
arch is entirely held up by the friction on the sides (induced by the
lateral thrust) and the cohesion acting there; for then this same
condition of affairs would exist for all lower arches,
[Footnote
29
]

and thus
is
transmitted vertically downward, unchanged, to the tunnel. Stating
this condition in algebraic form,

This equation strictly holds for large values of
,
but it is practically
true for much smaller values. For such values,
is quite small compared
with
and can be assumed as equal to zero, whence

also be taken equal to zero and the usual bin formula,

written.
[Footnote
30
]

On substituting this value in the equation above, reducing and
placing
,
we
obtain
,

where,
.

In the Appendix, the writer assumed,
,
basing
this value on the results pertaining to a smooth steel bin, 1Â ft. in

[

diameter, filled with sand. From the experiments of Jamieson on
large wooden bins, about 12 by 12Â ft., filled with wheat,
was found
to be 0.60. Janssen determined
experimentally to be 0.67. For
wheat, Jamieson gave

whence

His experimental value was
of this; hence, for lack of definite data,
there will be assumed for earth,

The pressures given in ColumnsÂ 5 and 7 are intended to apply to a
long section of a tunnel, those in ColumnsÂ 4 and 6 refer to a short
section about the heading. The values for
are intended to
apply to what Mr.Â Meem styles âsoft normally dry ground,â and it is
hoped that he may approve the figures, as they are somewhere near his
own. The coefficient,
,
refers to hard consolidated ground.
Here the pressure is 0 at the working faces of the 15-ft. tunnel.

shows the variation in

for some of
the larger values of

as obtained by the revised formula given in the
foot-note. It will be observed that the above demonstration for finding
the limiting value of

is perfectly independent of Janssenâs formula.
In it the relation,
,
is only assumed to be true for this one
value of
,
and
need be determined by experiment only for this
value. The result is thus general, no matter how
varies for other
values of

A glance at all the diagrams,
[Footnote

]

giving the experimental
values of
and
for various depths, will show that
is far from

[
472
]

being a constant for varying depths, though the assumption is found
to lead to practical results, as obtained from Janssenâs formula. The
experiments of Jamieson on 12 by 13Â½ by 67Â½-ft. wheat bins, and of
Bovey on 12 by 14 by 44Â ft. 10-in. bins, both of wood, indicate that
the maximum pressure,
,
is realized, practically, for heights of
about four diameters. Pleissnerâs experiments on a wooden bin, 11.51
by 8.20Â ft., show four and a half diameters, and Luft, for a concrete
bin, 23Â ft. in diameter, gives, say, three diameters, for the height corresponding
to
maximum
.

Fig. 27.

These are wide variations, resulting from variations in
and the
coefficient of friction of the wheat on the walls of the bin. As

increases, this ratio of height to diameter decreases. It would appear
to be a serious objection to the use of
Equations

and
if this
ratio for maximum
was large, but it must be remembered that
,

for earth over tunnels, is not known. It is possibly larger than assumed.
In any case,
EquationsÂ (9)
, which were deduced independently
of the modified Janssen formulas, appear to hold.

The writer has read with much interest the very interesting âdry
sand and wheat arching experiments,â referred to by Mr.Â Meem. It is
seen from the above, that the writer believes in this arching of sand
under certain conditions, for example, after some settlement. He does
not see any reason for any arching in an unlimited mass of sand, level

[
473
]

at the top. The conjugate pressures here are vertical and horizontal;
but, if a tunnel is bored through this mass, it tends to sink over the
tunnel, and, only in consequence of that settlement, is a part of the
weight of the sand directly over the tunnel transferred to the sides
through the friction caused by the lateral thrust and the cohesion.
Neither of these forces, both acting vertically upward, were in action,
before the settlement. Mr.Â Meem gives the following
account
of an
interesting experiment:

âA 2-in. pipe, 18Â in. long, was filled with dry sand for a depth of
12Â in., and a thin piece of tissue paper was pasted across the bottom.
Then, with a wooden piston bearing on the sand, the latter would support
the blow of a sledge hammer or the weight of a man without
breaking the tissue paper.â

Considering the sand in the pipe alone, it affords a pretty illustration
of the bin theory. Here,
.

Take
and

,

;
also

lb. per cu.Â in.
Therefore, making
in the formula for
above, we have

lb. per sq.Â in. Hence the total pressure
on the tissue paper is

lb., or say Â¼Â lb. Perhaps the paper
can stand this. The pressure is reduced to 0.185Â lb. on the paper if
we include cohesion, taking

lb. per sq.Â ft., as deduced from
Leygueâs experiments on dry sand. This pressure would not be
increased if the pipe, supposed to be vertical and filled with sand, was
of great height, the weight of the additional sand being equal to the
weight of the man or to the pressure induced by the blow of the hammer.
It seems natural, then, to infer that the pressures due to the
blow or man, are sustained by the sides of the pipe, as in the case of
the sand, though the conditions are not the same. In fact, in this
case, the pressure on the paper is even less than before; for the blow,
or the weight of the man causes the passive lateral thrust of the earth
to be exerted, and this, for
,
is nine times the active thrust
hitherto used, at least for an unlimited mass of earth. If this ratio
is assumed to hold for the sand in the pipe, the value of
will be
changed to
,
and the total pressure on the paper will be only

It is hoped that experimenters may turn their attention to finding
definite values of the coefficient of cohesion for all kinds of earth.
From observations of unsupported trenches, it has been seen that
values of
of from 100 to possibly 400Â lb. per sq.Â ft., may be

[
474
]

expected. RÃ©sal states
[Footnote
32
]

that MM.Â Jacquinot and Frontard, in July and
August, 1910, made some preliminary experiments on earth taken
from a reservoir dam which was failing, and found for it about

kg. per. sq.Â m., or say 409Â lb. per sq.Â ft.; but
,
corresponding to
.
The latter result is startling. For finding

and
experimentally, RÃ©sal suggests that a thin slice of earth
be placed between two rough metallic plaques, pressed firmly together,
and that the resistance to the relative displacement of the two plaques,
for varying pressures, be recorded. By writing the relation between

,

,
and the forces involved, for each experiment, values of

and
can be found by elimination. In conclusion, the writer
believes that he has offered a satisfactory and comprehensive theory
of earth pressure, for earth endowed with both cohesion and friction.
The results are not on as satisfactory a basis for pressures on tunnels,
but the formulas derived are submitted in the hope that engineers
will subject them to the test of both experience and experiment.

The writer returns sincere thanks to Messrs. Worcester and Meem
for their helpful and stimulating discussion.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢

Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢âs
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundationâs EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

MADAM
,

If in adventuring to lay this little
Piece at your Highnesses Feet, and
humbly beg your Royal Protection
of it, I have presumâd too far, be pleasâd
to impute it to your own, most gracious
Goodness, the knowledge of which
encouragâd me. Our Sex are by Nature
tender of their own Off-spring,
and may be allowâd to have more
fondness for those of the Brain, then
any other; because they are so few,
and meet with so many Enemies at
their first appearance in the World.
I hope therefore to find pardon, if like
an indulgent Parent, I have endeavourâd
to advance my first Born, by
entering it very early into your Highnesses
Service.

I have not presumâd to approach
your Highness out of any Confidence
in the merits of this Essay, but of the
Cause which it pleads, wherein the
Honour of the whole Sex seemâd to
exact of me no less a Patronage than
that of the Best, as well as Greatest
among âem, whom they are all ambitious
to see at their head. I have
only endeavourâd to reduce the Sexes
to a Level, and by Arguments to
raise Ours to an Equallity at most
with the Men: But your Highness
by Illustrious Example daily convinces
the World of our Superiority,
and we see with wonder, Vertues in
you, Madam, greater than your Birth.
In this I am peculiarly happy, that I
am exempted from the common Task
of other Dedicators, who lie under
an Obligation of publishing to the
World those Excellencies of their
Patrons, which perhaps appear no
where but in their Epistles. In me
it were as great folly, to pretend to
make known the Illustrious Quallities
of your Highness, as it wouâd be
to go about to demonstrate by Argument,
that the Sun shinâd, to a
Crowd that are warmâd by the Influence
of it.

I had attempted the Character of
a consummate Woman, could I, thoâ
but faintly have shaddowâd the inimitable
Graces of you Highness; but
the impossibillity of that Task forcâd
me to desist. It were easy here to
lanch into those glorious particulars,
which affirmed of any other than
your Royal Highness, would have
been extravagance of Flattery; but
to you Injustice, and in me the highest
presumption, to attempt with my
feeble Hand those Perfections, which
the ablest must fall infinitely short
of. The lustre of your Royal Vertues,
Madam, like the Sun, gives us
warmth and light, and while at a
modest distance we admire it, improves
our sight, which too bold a
view confounds, yet the meanest and
most ignorant see those Glories,
which the most exquisite Artist can
never express. The World therefore
will rather justify than comdemn my
conduct, if I do not wrong so bright
an Original with a dark obscure Copy.

Madam
, Thoâ the world may condemn
my performance, it must applaud
my choice in this Address, and
own that had I known as well how to
Argue, as to Instance, I must infallibly
have Triumphâd over all Opposition.
It may be easie to evade, or
baffle the force of my Arguments,
but it is impossible without the utmost
Stupidity, and Injustice to deny
the manifest Advantages of those
Illustrious Graces, which raise your
Highness so far above theirs as well
as your own Sex. In this I have imitated
the conduct of prudent Generals,
who, when they doubt the
sufficiency of their strength, retire
to some strong Fort, and rest secure
There is yet another Reason,
Madam
,
which thoâ the least justifiable, was
nevertheless most prevalent with me
to devote this Essay to your Highness.
My Ambition to shew the profound
Respects I have always had for your
Highness, would not suffer me to let
slip any occasion of expressing it, even
tho I blush for the meanes of it.
Thus I find my self reducâd by my
Zeal, to the condition of poor Tenants,
who must expose their Poverty,
to shew their Affection to their
Lord in a worthless Present. I am
sensible of the rashness of my Ambition
in aspiring to the Patronage of
Your Highness, and the need I have
of an Apology; but were I able to
make one as I ought, I should have
taken care to have had less occasion
for it. Yet I doubt not from Your
Goodness that Indulgence, which I
cannot expect from Your Justice,
nor but that you will (like Heaven,
whose more immediate Images Princes
are) accept my unprofitable Service,
for the sincerity with which it
is tenderâd. If my unfeignâd Submission
may procure pardon for my
Presumption, that Your Happiness
may equal Your illustrious Vertues,
and Your Royal Person be as far
out of the reach of Fortune, as your
Fame and Honour of Detraction,
shall ever be the prayers of

Madam,

Your Royal Highnessâs

most Humble, most

Obedient, and most

Devoted Servant

PREFACE.

Prefaces to most Books, are like Prolocutors
to Puppet-Shows, they
come first to tell you what Figures are
to be presented, and what Tricks they
are to play. According therefore to
ancient and laudable Custom, I have
thought fit to let you know by way of Preface,
or Advertisement, (call it which you
please) that here are many fine Figures
within to be seen, as well worth your
curiosity, as any in
Smithfield
at
Bartholomew

Tide. I will not deny, Reader,
but that you may have seen some
of âem there already; to those that have,
I have little more to say, than that if
they have a mind to see them again in
Effigie, they may do it here. What is
it you wouâd have? Here are St.

Georgeâs, Batemans, John Dories,
Punchinelloâs,
and the
Creation of the
World,
or whatâs as good; hereâs the

German Artist
too, or one that can
show more Tricks than he: If all this
will not invite you, yâare grown more
squeamish of late, Gentlemen, than you
usâd to be, and the poor Bookseller will
make but an indifferent Market of you.
Well, let the worst come to the worst,
âtis but shifting the scene to
Smithfield,

and making an Interest in half a dozen
Vizor-Masks to be sure of your Company:
But he, good Man, is desirous to
please you at first hand, and therefore
has put a fine Picture in the front to
invite you in, so like some of you (as
he protests) that you ought never look
in a Glass again, if it offends you. For
my part, I declare, he has acted clear
against my Opinion in this case, and so
he has been told; for many a poor Man
has lost the showing of his Monster, by
gratifying the curiosity of the gaping
Crowd with too exact a picture without
doors. Besides, thereâs an unlucky
Rogue of a left-handed Barber, that
looks like an ill Omen in the beginning.
He was told too, that if he wouâd please
most of you, he ought to take example
by your Glasses and flatter you. Yet
he continued obstinate and unmoveable
to all these weighty Reasons, and is so
fondly bent for his Picture, that he resolvâd
against all advice to have it.
Nay, and he wouâd have Rhimes underneath
it too, which, he says, weigh
more with you, than all the Reason in
the world. I thought fit to let you
know this, that the Bookseller might
not lose the credit of his Fancy, if it
takes with you, as he is perswaded it
will. For you must know, I am a great
lover of strict Justice, and therefore
would by no means Rob, or Defraud
him of the Glory of his Invention, or
by any sinister way sullie, or diminish
the Honour, or Reputation of his Parts
and Ingenuity. For the same Reason
likewise I must acquaint you, that the
Rhimes are none of mine neither; and
now my Hand is in, I donât much care
if I tell you, that I am not very good
at that ingenious Recreation, called

Crambo,
from which some rise to be
very considerable Rhimers. This now
is more then I was obligâd to tell you,
and therefore I hope no body will deny,
but that I deal ingenuously at least
with you.

This one would think were Preface
sufficient; but there are some Men so
impertinently curious, that they must
needs have a Reason for every thing,
that is done in the World, thoâ it were
in their favour (for which perhaps it
were hard to give a good one) when
it were their Interest to be satisfied,
and thankful without further enquiry.
To comply therefore in some measure
with the humour of these People, if any
such think fit to peruse this Book, I
must tell âem very freely, that I was so
far from aiming to oblige, or disoblige
âem by it, that it was never intended
for their View. It was occasionâd by a
private Conversation, between some
Gentlemen and Ladies, and written at
the request, and for the Diversion of
one Lady more particularly, by whom
with my consent it was communicated
to two or three more of both Sexes,
my Friends likewise.

By them I was with abundance of
Complements importunâd to make it
publick; now thoâ I do with good Reason
attribute much more, of what was
said to me upon this Occasion, to their
good Breeding and Friendship, than to
their real Opinions of my Performance;
yet I have so much satisfaction in their
Sincerity, and Friendship as to be confident
they would not suffer, much less
perswade me to expose to the world any
thing, of which they doubted so far,
as to think it would not be tollerably
acceptable. Nor have I less assurance
of their Judgment and Skill in things
of this nature, beside that I have been
informâd by some of âem, that it has
been seen, and favourably receivâd by
some Gentlemen, whom the world thinks
no incompetent Judges. After all this
Encouragement, I suppose, I shall not
be thought vain, if, as I pretend not
to the applause, so I fear not the contempt
of the world: Yet I presume not
so far upon the Merits of what I have
written, as to make my Name publick
with it. I have elsewhere held,
that Vanity was almost the universal
mover of all our Actions, and consequently
of mine, as well as of others;
yet it is not strongenough in me, to induce
me to bring my Name upon the
publick stage of the World.

There are many Reasons, that oblige
me to this cautious, reservâd way
of procedure; thoâ I might otherwise
be very ambitious of appearing in the
defence of my Sex, couâd I perswade
my self, that I was able to write any
thing sutable to the dignity of the
Subject, which I am not vain enough
to think. This indeed is one Reason,
because I am sensible it might have
been much better defended by abler
Pens; such as many among our own Sex
are; though I believe scarce thus much
wouâd have been expected from me, by
those that know me. There is likewise
another Reason, which was yet
more prevalent with me, and with those
few Friends whom I consulted about
it, which is this; There are a sort of
Men, that upon all occasions think
themselves more concernâd, and more
thought of than they are, and that,
like Men that are deaf, or have any
other notorious Defect, can see no body
whisper, or laugh, but they think âtis
at themselves. These Men are apt to
think, that every ridiculous description
they meet with, was intended
more particularly for some one or other
of them; as indeed it is hard to paint
any thing compleat in their several
Kinds, without hitting many of their
particular Features, even without drawing
from them. The knowledge of this,
with the consideration of the tenderness
of Reputation in our Sex, (which
as our delicatest Fruits and finest Flowers
are most obnoxious to the injuries
of Weather, is submitted to every infectious
Blast of malicious Breath) made
me very cautious, how I exposâd mine
to such poisonous Vapours. I was not
ignorant, how liberal some Men are
of their Scandal, whenever provokâd,
especially by a Woman; and how
ready the same Men are to be so,
tho upon never so mistaken Grounds.
This made me resolve to keep âem in
Ignorance of my Name, and if they have
a mind to find me out, let âem catch
me (if they can) as Children at Blindmans
Buff do one another, Hoodwinkt;
and I am of Opinion I have room enough
to put âem out of Breath before they
come near me.

The Event has in Effect provâd my
suspicions
Prophetick; for there are (as
I am informâd) already some, so forward
to interest themselves against me,
that they take Characters upon themselves,
before they see âem; and, for
fear they should want some Body to
throw their Dirt at, with equal Ignorance,
and Injustice Father this Piece
upon the Gentleman, who was so kind as
to take care of the Publication of it,
only to excuse me from appearing. This
made me once resolve to oppose my Innocence
to their Clamour, and perfix
my Name, which I thought I was
bound to do in Justice to him. In this
Resolution I had persisted, had not the
very same Gentleman generously perswaded,
and over-rulâd me to the contrary,
representing how weak a defence
Innocence is against Calumny, how open
the Ears of all the World are, and
how greedily they suck in any thing to
the prejudice of a Woman; and that (to
use his own Expression) the scandal of
such Men, was like Dirt thrown by
Children, and Fools at random, and
without Provocation, it would dawb filthily
at first, though it were easily washt
off again: Adding, that he desirâd me
not to be under any concern for him; for
he valued the Malice of such men, as little,
as their Friendship, the one was as
feeble, as tother false.

I suppose I need make no Apology to
my own Sex for the meaness of this defence;
the bare intention of serving
âem will
I hope be accepted, and of
Men, the Candid and Ingenuous I am
sure will not quarrel with me for any
thing in this little Book; since there is
nothing in it, which was not drawn from
the strictest Reason I was Mistress of,
and the best Observations I was able to
make, except a start or two only concerning
the Salique Law, and the

Amazons,
which, if they divert not
the Reader, canât offend him
.

I shall not trouble the Reader with
any account of the Method I have observâd,
he will easily discover that in
reading the Piece it self. I shall only
take notice to him of one thing, which
with a little attention to what he reads
he will readily find to be true, that is,
that the Characters were not written
out of any Wanton Humour, or Malicious
Design to characterize any Particular
Persons, but to illustrate what I
have said upon the several Heads, under
which they are rangâd, and represent not
single Men, but so many Clans, or Divisions
of Men, that play the Fool seriously
in the World. If any Individual
seem to be more peculiarly markt, it is
because he is perhaps more notorious
to the World, by some one or more Articles
of the General Character here given
I am sure that there is no Man, who is
but moderately Acquainted with the
World, especially this Town, but may
find half a Dozen, or more Originals
for every Picture. After all, if any
Man have so little Wit, as to appropriate
any of these Characters to himself,
He takes a liberty I have hitherto never
given him, but shall do it now in
the Words of a Great Man
, If any
Fool finds the Cap fit him, let him
put it on.

There are some Men, (I hear) who
will not allow this Piece to be written
by a Woman; did I know what Estimate
to make of their Judgments, I might
perhaps have a higher Opinion of this
Triffle, than I ever yet had. For I
little thought while I was writing this,
that any Man (especially an Ingenious
Man) should have the scandal of being
the reputed Author. For he must
think it scandalous to be made to Father
a Womans Productions unlawfully.
But these Gentlemen, I suppose, believe
there is more Wit, than theyâl find in
this Piece, upon the Credit of the
Bookseller, whose Interest it is to flatter
it. But were it as well written as I
could wish it, or as the Subject wouâd
bear, and deserves; I see no reason
why our Sex shouâd be robbâd of the
Honour of it; Since there have been
Women in all Ages, whose Writings
might vie with those of the greatest Men,
as the Present Age as well as past can
testifie. I shall not trouble the Reader
with their names, because I wouâd not
be thought so vain, as to rank my self
among âem; and their names are already
too well known, and celebrated to receive
any additional Lustre from so
weak Encomiums as mine. I pretend
not to imitate, much less to Rival those
Illustrious Ladies, who have done so
much Honour to their Sex, and are
unanswerable Proofs of, what I contend
for. I only wish, that some Ladies now
living among us (whose names I forbear
to mention in regard to their Modesty)
wouâd exert themselves, and give us
more recent Instances, who are both by
Nature and Education sufficiently qualified
to do it, which I pretend not to.
I freely own to the Reader, that I
know no other Tongue besides my Native,
except
French,
in which I am but very
moderately skillâd. I plead not this
to excuse the meaness of my Performance;
because I know, I may reasonably be
askâd, why I was so forward to write;
For that I have already given my reasons
above, if they will not satisfie the
Reader, he must endeavour to please
himself with better, for I am very little
solicitous about the matter. I shall only
add, that for my Good Will I hope
the Favour of my own Sex, which will
satisfie my Ambition.

To the Most Ingenious Mrs. ââ or her Admirable Defence of Her Sex.

Long have we sung the Famâd
Orinda
âs praise,

And ownâd
Astrea
âs Title to the Bays,

We to their Wit have paid the Tribute due,

But shouâd be Bankrupt, before just to you.

Sweet flowing Numbers, and fine Thoughts they writ;

But you Eternal Truths, as well as Wit.

In them the Force of Harmony we find,

In you the Strength, and Vigour of the Mind.

Dark Clouds of Prejudice obscurâd their Verse,

You with Victorious Prose those Clouds disperse:

Those Foggs, which wouâd not to their Flame submit,

Vanish before your Rising Sun of Wit.

Like Stars, they only in Themselves were bright,

The whole Sex shines by your reflected Light.

Our Sex have long throâ Usurpation reignâd,

And by their Tyranny their Rule maintainâd.

Till wanton grown with Arbitrary Sway

Deposâd by you They practice to obey,

Proudly submitting, when such Graces meet,

Beauty by Nature, and by conquest Wit.

For Wit they had on their own Sex entailâd,

Till for your self, and Sex you thus prevailâd.

Thrice happy Sex! Whose Foes such Powâr disarms,

And gives fresh Lustre to your native Charms,

Whose Nervous Sense couchâd in close Method lies,

Clear as her Soul, and piercing as her Eyes.

If any yet so stupid shouâd appear,

As still to doubt, what she has made so clear,

Her Beautieâs Arguments they would allow,

And to Her Eyes their full Conversion owe.

And by Experiment the World convince.

The Force of Reasonâs less, than that of Sense.

Your Sex you with such Charming Grace defend,

While that you vindicate, you Ours amend:

We in your Glass may see each foul defect.

And may not only see, but may correct.

In vain old
Greece
her Sages would compare,

They taught what Men should be, you what they are

With doubtfull Notiones they Mankind perplext,

And with unpracticable Precept vext.

In vain they strove wild Passions to reclaim,

Uncertain what they were, or whence they came.

But you, who have found out their certain Source,

May with a happier Hand divert their Course.

Themselves so little did those Sages know,

That to their Failings We their Learning owe.

Their Vanity first causâd âem to aspire,

And with feirce Wranglings set all
Greece
on Fire:

Thus into sects they split the
Grecian
youth,

Contending more for Victory than Truth.

Your Speculations nobler Ends persue,

They aim not to be Popular, but true.

You with strict Justice in an equal Light,

Expose both Wit and Folly to our Sight,

Yet as the Bee secure on Poyson feeds,

Extracting Honey from the rankest Weeds:

So safely you in Fools Instructours find,

And Wisdom in the Follies of mankind.

With purer Waves henceforth shall Satyr flow,

And we this change to your chast Labours owe;

Satyr before from a Polluted Source

Brought Native Filth, augmented in its course.

No longer muddy shall those Streams appear,

Which you have purgâd, and made so sweet, and clear.

Well may your Wit to us a wonder seem,

So strongâs the Current, yet so clear the stream,

Deep, but not Dull, throâ each transparent Line

We see the Gems, which at the Bottom shine.

To your Correction freely we submit,

Who teach us Modesty, as well as Wit.

Our Sex with Blushes must your Conquest own,

While yours prepare the Garlands you have won.

Your Fame secure long as your Sex shall last,

Nor Time, nor Envy shall your Lawrels blast.

James Drake.

The Reader is desirâd to excuse, and correct all Literal Escapes, and to amend the following thus.

AN
ESSAY

In Defence of the
Female Sex,
&c.

The Conversation we had
âtother day, makes me, Dear

Madam
, but more sensible
of the unreasonableness of
your desire; which obliges me to
inform you further upon a Subject,
wherein I have more need of your
instruction. The strength of Judgment,
sprightly Fancy, and admirable
Address; you shewâd upon that
Occasion, speak you so perfect a
Mistress of that Argument (as I
doubt not but you are of any other
that you please to engage in) that
whoever, would speak or write
well on it, ought first to be your

2
Schollar. Yet to let you see how
absolutely you may command me,
I had rather be your
Eccho
, than
be silent when You bid me speak,
and beg your excuse rather for my
Failures, than want of Complacence.
I know You will not accuse me for
a Plagiary if I return You nothing,
but what I have gleanâd from You,
when You consider, that I pretend
not to make a Present, but to pay
the Interest only of a Debt. Nor
can You tax me with Vanity, since
no Importunity of a Person less
lovâd, or valuâd by me than your
self could have extorted thus much
from me. This Consideration leaves
me no room to doubt but that you
will with your usual Candour pardon
those Defects, and correct those
Errors, which proceed only from
an over forward Zeal to oblige
You, though to my own Disadvantage.

The defence of our Sex against so
many and so great Wits as have so
strongly attackâd it, may justly
seem a Task too difficult for a Woman

3
to attempt. Not that I can,
or ought to yield, that we are by
Nature less enabled for such an Enterpize,
than Men are; which I
hope at least to shew plausible Reasons
for, before I have done: But
because through the Usurpation of
Men, and the Tyranny of Custom
(here in
England
especially) there
are at most but few, who are by
Education, and acquirâd Wit, or
Letters sufficiently quallified for
such an Undertaking. For my own
part I shall readily own, that as
few as there are, there may be
and are abundance, who in their
daily Conversations approve themselves
much more able, and sufficient
Assertors of our Cause, than
my self; and I am sorry that either
their Business, their other Diversions,
or too great Indulgence of
their Ease, hinder them from doing
publick Justice to their Sex. The
Men by Interest or Inclination are
so generally engagâd against us,
that it is not to be expected, that
any one Man of Wit should arise so
generous as to engage in our Quarrel,

4
and be the Champion of our
Sex against the Injuries and Oppressions
of his own. Those Romantick
days are over, and there
is not so much as a
Don Quixot
of
the Quill left to succour the distressed
Damsels. âTis true, a Feint
of something of this Nature was
made three or four Years since by
one; but how much soever his Eugenia
may be obligâd to him, I am
of Opinion the rest of her Sex are
but little beholding to him. For as
you rightly observâd,
Madam
, he
has taken more care to give an
Edge to his Satyr, than force to
his Apology; he has playâd a sham
Prize, and receives more thrusts
than he makes; and like a false Renegade
fights under our Colours
only for a fairer Opportunity of betraying
us. But what could be expected
else from a Beau? An Annimal
that can no more commend in
earnest a Womans Wit, than a
Manâs Person, and that compliments
ours, only to shew his own
good Breeding and Parts. He levels
his Scandal at the whole Sex,

5
and thinks us sufficiently fortified,
if out of the Story of Two Thousand
Years he has been able to
pick up a few Examples of Women
illustrious for their Wit, Learning
or Vertue, and Men infamous for
the contrary; though I think the
most inveterate of our Enemies
would have sparâd him that labour,
by granting that all Ages have producâd
Persons famous or infamous
of both Sexes; or they must throw
up all pretence to Modesty, or
Reason.

I have neither Learning, nor Inclination
to make a Precedent, or
indeed any use of Mr. Wâs. labourâd
Common Place Book; and shall
leave Pedants and School-Boys to
rake and tumble the Rubbish of
Antiquity, and muster all the
Heroes

and
Heroins
they can find to
furnish matter for some wretched
Harangue, or stuff a miserable Declamation
with instead of Sense or
Argument.

Some advantages to be allowâd to the disparity of Education.

6
I shall not enter into any dispute,
whether Men, or Women be generally
more ingenious, or learned;
that Point must be given up to the
advantages Men have over us by
their Education, Freedom of Converse,
and variety of Business and
Company. But when any Comparison
is made between âem, great
allowances must be made for the
disparity of those Circumstances.
Neither shall I contest about the
preheminence of our Virtues; I
know there are too many Vicious,
and I hope there are a great many
Virtuous of both Sexes. Yet this
I may say, that whatever Vices are
found amongst us, have in general
both their source, and encouragement
from them.

The Question I shall at present
handle is, whether the time an ingenious
Gentleman spends in the
Company of Women, may justly
be said to be misemployâd, or not?
I put the question in general terms;
because whoever holds the affirmative
must maintain it so, or the Sex

7
is no way concernâd to oppose him.
On the other side I shall not maintain
the Negative, but with some
Restrictions and Limitations; because
I will not be bound to justifie
those Women, whose Vices and
ill Conduct expose them deservedly
to the Censure of the other Sex,
as well as of their own. The Question
being thus stated, let us consider
the end and purposes, for which
Conversation was at first instituted,
and is yet desirable; and then we
shall see, whether they may not all
be found in the Company of Women.
These Ends, I take it, are
the same with those we aim at in
all our other Actions, in general
only two, Profit or Pleasure. These
are divided into those of the Mind,
and those of the Body. Of the
latter I shall take no further Notice,
as having no Relation to the
present Subject; but shall confine
my self wholly to the Mind, the
Profit of which is the Improvement
of the Understanding, and the
Pleasure is the Diversion, and Relaxation
of its Cares and Passions.

8
Now if either of these Ends be attainable
by the Society of Women,
I have gainâd my Point. However,
I hope to make it appear, that they
are not only both to be met with in
the Conversation of Women, but
one of them more generally, and in
greater measure than in Mens.

Our Company is generally by
our Adversaries represented as unprofitable
and irksome to Men of
Sense, and by some of the more
vehement Sticklers against us, as
Criminal. These Imputations as
they are unjust, especially the latter,
so they savour strongly of the
Malice, Arrogance and Sottishness
of those, that most frequently urge
âem; who are commonly either conceited
Fops, whose success in their
Pretences to the favour of our Sex
has been no greater than their Merit,
and fallen very far short of their
Vanity and Presumption, or a sort
of morose, ill-bred, unthinking
Fellows, who appear to be Men
only by their Habit and Beards,
and are scarce distinguishable from

9
Brutes but by their Figure and Risibility.
But I shall wave these Reflections
at present, however just,
and come closer to our Argument.
If Women are not quallified for the
Conversation of ingenious Men, or,
to go yet further, their friendship,
it must be because they want some
one condition, or more, necessarily
requisite to either. The necessary
Conditions of these are Sense, and
good nature, to which must be added,
for Friendship, Fidelity and
Integrity. Now if any of these
be wanting to our Sex, it must be
either because Nature has not been
so liberal as to bestow âem upon
us; or because due care has not been
taken to cultivate those Gifts to a
competent measure in us.

The first of these Causes is that,
which is most generally urgâd against
us, whether it be in Raillery,
or Spight. I might easily cut
this part of the Controversy short
by an irrefragable Argument, which
is, that the express intent, and reason
for which Woman was created,

10
was to be a Companion, and help
meet to Man; and that consequently
those, that deny âem to be so,
must argue a Mistake in Providence,
and think themselves wiser
than their Creator. But these Gentlemen
are generally such passionate
Admirers of themselves, and have
such a profound value and reverence
for their own Parts, that they
are ready at any time to sacrifice
their Religion to the Reputation of
their Wit, and rather than lose
their point, deny the truth of the
History. There are others, that
though they allow the Story yet
affirm, that the propagation, and
continuance of Mankind, was the
only Reason for which we were
made; as if the Wisdom that first
made Man, couâd not without trouble
have continuâd the Species by
the same or any other Method, had
not this been most conducive to his
happiness, which was the gracious
and only end of his Creation. But
these superficial Gentlemen wear
their Understandings like their
Clothes, always set and formal,

11
and wouâd no more Talk than
Dress out of Fashion; Beauâs that,
rather than any part of their outward
Figure shouâd be damagâd,
wouâd wipe the dirt of their shoes
with their Handkercher, and that
value themselves infinitely more
upon modish Nonsense, than upon
the best Sense against the Fashion.
But since I do not intend to make
this a religious Argument, I shall
leave all further Considerations of
this Nature to the Divines, whose
more immediate Business and Study
it is to assert the Wisdom of
Providence in the Order, and distribution
of this World, against all that
shall oppose it.

No distinction of Sexes in Souls.

To proceed therefore if we be
naturally defective, the Defect must
be either in Soul or Body. In the
Soul it canât be, if what I have
hearâd some learned Men maintain,
be true, that all Souls are equal,
and alike, and that consequently
there is no such distinction, as Male
and Female Souls; that there are
no innate
Ideaâs
, but that all the

12
Notions we have, are derivâd from
our External Senses, either immediately,
or by Reflection. These
Metaphysical Speculations, I must
own Madam, require much more
Learning and a stronger Head, than
I can pretend to be Mistress of, to
be considerâd as they ought: Yet
so bold I may be, as to undertake
the defence of these Opinions, when
any of our jingling Opponents think
fit to refute âem.

No advantage in the Organization of their Bodies.

Neither can it be in the Body,
(if I may credit the Report of learned
Physicians) for there is no difference
in the Organization of those
Parts, which have any relation to,
or influence over the Minds; but
the Brain, and all other Parts (which
I am not Anatomist enough to
name) are contrivâd as well for the
plentiful conveyance of Spirits,
which are held to be the immediate
Instruments of Sensation, in Women,
as Men. I see therefore no
natural Impediment in the structure
of our Bodies; nor does Experience,
or Observation argue any: We use all

13
our Natural Faculties, as well as
Men, nay and our Rational too, deducting
only for the advantages before
mentionâd.

Confirmâd from Experience of Brutes.

Let us appeal yet further to Experience,
and observe those Creatures
that deviate least from simple
Nature, and see if we can find any
difference in Sense, or understanding
between Males and Females.
In these we may see Nature
plainest, who lie under no
constraint of Custom or Laws,
but those of Passion or Appetite,
which are Natures, and know no
difference of Education, nor receive
any Byass by prejudice. We
see great distance in Degrees of
Understanding, Wit, Cunning and
Docility (call them what you
please) between the several Species
of Brutes. An Ape, a Dog, a
Fox, are by daily Observation
found to be more Docile, and
more Subtle than an Ox, a Swine,
or a Sheep. But a She Ape is as
full of, and as ready at Imitation as
a He; a Bitch will learn as many

14
Tricks in as short a time as a Dog,
a Female Fox has as many Wiles
as a Male. A thousand instances of
this kind might be producâd; but I
think these are so plain, that to
instance more were a superfluous labour;
I shall only once more take
notice, that in Brutes and other Animals
there is no difference betwixt
Male and Female in point of
Sagacity, notwithstanding there is
the same distinction of Sexes, that
is between Men and Women. I
have read, that some Philosophers
have held Brutes to be no more
than meer Machines, a sort of Divine
Clock-work, that Act only by
the force of nice unseen Springs
without Sensation, and cry out
without feeling Pain, Eat without
Hunger, Drink without Thirst,
fawn upon their Keepers without
seeing âem, hunt Hares without
Smelling,
&c.
Here Madam is cover
for our Antagonists against the
last Argument so thick, that there
is no beating âem out. For my
part, I shall not envy âem their refuge,
let âem lie like the wild
Irish

15
secure within their Boggs; the field
is at least ours, so long as they
keep to their Fastnesses. But to
quit this Topick, I shall only add,
that if the learnedest He of âem all
can convince me of the truth of
this Opinion, He will very much
stagger my Faith; for hitherto I
have been able to observe no difference
between our Knowledge
and theirs, but a gradual one; and
depend upon Revelation alone,
that our Souls are Immortal, and
theirs not.

Experience of Mankind.

But if an Argument from Brutes
and other Animals shall not be allowâd
as conclusive, (though I canât
see, why such an Inference should
not be valid, since the parity of
Reason is the same on both sides
in this Case.) I shall desire those,
that hold against us to observe
the Country People, I mean the
inferiour sort of them, such as not
having Stocks to follow Husbandry
upon their own Score, subsist
upon their daily Labour. For amongst
these, though not so equal

16
as that of Brutes, yet the Condition
of the two Sexes is more level,
than amongst Gentlemen, City
Traders, or rich Yeomen. Examine
them in their several Businesses,
and their Capacities will appear
equal; but talk to them of
things indifferent, and out of the
Road of their constant Employment,
and the Ballance will fall on our
side, the Women will be found the
more ready and polite. Let us
look a little further, and view our
Sex in a state of more improvement,
amongst our Neighbours the

Dutch
. There we shall find them
managing not only the Domestick
Affairs of the Family, but making,
and receiving all Payments as well
great as small, keeping the Books,
ballancing the Accounts, and doing
all the Business, even the nicest
of Merchants, with as much Dexterity
and Exactness as their, or our
Men can do. And I have often
hearâd some of our considerable
Merchants blame the conduct of our
Country-Men in this point; that
they breed our Women to ignorant

17
of Business; whereas were
they taught Arithmetick, and other
Arts which require not much
bodily strength, they might supply
the places of abundance of lusty
Men now employâd in sedentary
Business; which would be a mighty
profit to the Nation by sending
those Men to Employments, where
hands and Strength are more requirâd,
especially at this time when
we are in such want of People.
Beside that it might prevent the
ruine of many Families, which is
often occasionâd by the Death of
Merchants in full Business, and
leaving their Accounts perplexâd,
and embroilâd to a Widdow and
Orphans, who understanding nothing
of the Husband or Fatherâs
Business occasions the Rending, and
oftentimes the utter Confounding a
fair Estate; which might be prevented,
did the Wife but understand
Merchants Accounts, and
were made acquainted with the
Books.

18
I have yet another Argument
from Nature, which is, that the
very Make and Temper of our Bodies
shew that we were never designâd
for Fatigue; and the Vivacity
of our Wits, and Readiness of
our Invention (which are confessâd
even by our Adversaries) demonstrate
that we were chiefly intended
for Thought and the Exercise of
the Mind. Whereas on the contrary
it is apparent from the strength
and size of their Limbs, the Vigour
and Hardiness of their Constitutions,
that Men were purposely
framâd and contrivâd for Action,
and Labour. And herein the Wisdom
and Contrivance of Providence
is abundantly manifested; for as
the one Sex is fortified with Courage
and Ability to undergo the
necessary Drudgery of providing
Materials for the sustenance of
Life in both; so the other is furnishâd
with Ingenuity and Prudence
for the orderly management and
distribution of it, for the Relief and
Comfort of a Family; and is over
and above enrichâd with a peculiar

19
Tenderness and Care requisite to
the Cherishing their poor helpless
Off-spring. I know our Opposers
usually miscall our quickness of
Thought, Fancy and Flash, and
christen their own heaviness by the
specious Names of Judgment and
Solidity; but it is easie to retort
upon âem the reproachful Ones of
Dullness and Stupidity with more
Justice. I shall pursue this Point
no further, but continue firm in my
Persuasion, that Nature has not
been so Niggardly to us, as our
Adversaries would insinuate, till I
see better cause to the contrary,
then I have hitherto at any time
done. Yet I am ready to yield
to Conviction, whoever offers
it; which I donât suddenly expect.

It remains then for us to enquire,
whether the Bounty of Nature be
wholly neglected, or stifled by us,
or so far as to make us unworthy
the Company of Men? Or whether
our Education (as bad as it is)
be not sufficient to make us a useful,

20
nay a necessary part of Society
for the greatest part of Mankind.
This cause is seldom indeed urgâd
against us by the Men, though it
be the only one, that gives âem any
advantage over us in understanding.
But it does not serve
their Pride, there is no Honour to
be gainâd by it: For a Man ought
no more to value himself upon being
Wiser than a Woman, if he
owe his Advantage to a better Education,
and greater means of Information,
then he ought to boast
of his Courage, for beating a Man,
when his Hands were bound. Nay
it would be so far from Honourable
to contend for preference upon this
Score, that they would thereby at
once argue themselves guilty both
of Tyranny, and of Fear:

|
Women industriously kept in Ignorance.
|

I think
I need not have mentionâd the latter;
for none can be Tyrants but
Cowards. For nothing makes one
Party slavishly depress another, but
their fear that they may at one
time or other become Strong or
Couragious enough to make themselves
equal to, if not superiour to

21
their Masters. This is our Case;
for Men being sensible as well of
the Abilities of Mind in our Sex,
as of the strength of Body in their
own, began to grow Jealous, that
we, who in the Infancy of the
World were their Equals and Partners
in Dominion, might in process
of Time, by Subtlety and Stratagem,
become their Superiours;
and therefore began in good time
to make use of Force (the Origine
of Power) to compell us to a Subjection,
Nature never meant; and
made use of Natures liberality to
them to take the benefit of her
kindness from us. From that time
they have endeavourâd to train us
up altogether to Ease and Ignorance;
as Conquerors use to do to
those, they reduce by Force, that
so they may disarm âem, both of
Courage and Wit; and consequently
make them tamely give up their
Liberty, and abjectly submit their
Necks to a slavish Yoke. As the
World grew more Populous, and
Mens Necessities whetted their Inventions,
so it increasâd their Jealousy,

22
and sharpenâd their Tyranny
over us, till by degrees, it came to
that height of Severity, I may say
Cruelty, it is now at in all the
Eastern parts of the World, where
the Women, like our Negroes in
our Western Plantations, are born
slaves, and live Prisoners all their
Lives. Nay, so far has this barbarous
Humour prevailâd, and spread
it self, that in some parts of
Europe
,
which pretend to be most refinâd
and civilizâd, in spite of Christianity,
and the Zeal for Religion which
they so much affect, our Condition is
not very much better. And even
in
France
, a Country that treats our
Sex with more Respect than most
do,

|
Original of the Salique Law.
|

We are by the
Salique Law
excluded
from Soveraign Power. The

French
are an ingenious People, and
the Contrivers of that Law knew
well enough, that We were no less
capable of Reigning, and Governing
well, than themselves; but they
were suspicious, that if the Regal
Power shouâd fall often into the
hands of Women, they would favour
their own Sex, and might in

23
time restore âem to their Primitive
Liberty and Equality with the Men,
and so break the neck of that unreasonable
Authority they so much
affect over us; and therefore made
this Law to prevent it. The Historians
indeed tell us other Reasons,
but they canât agree among
themselves, and as Men are Parties
against us, and therefore their Evidence
may justly be rejected. To
say the truth Madam, I canât tell
how to prove all this from Ancient
Records; for if any Histories were,
anciently written by Women, Time,
and the Malice of Men have effectually
conspirâd to suppress âem;
and it is not reasonable to think
that Men shouâd transmit, or suffer
to be transmitted to Posterity, any
thing that might shew the weakness
and illegallity of their Title to
a Power they still exercise so arbitrarily,
and are so fond of. But
since daily Experience shews, and
their own Histories tell us, how earnestly
they endeavour, and what
they act, and suffer to put the same
Trick upon one another, âtis natural

24
to suppose they took the same
measures with us at first, which
now they have effected, like the
Rebels in our last Civil Wars, when
they had brought the Royal Party
under, they fall together by the
Ears about the Dividend.

|
Amazons; why they rejected the Society of Men.
|

The Sacred
History takes no notice of any
such Authority they had before
the Flood, and their Own confess
that whole Nations have rejected it
since, and not sufferâd a Man to live
amongst them, which couâd be for
no other Reason, than their Tyranny.
For upon less provocation the
Women wouâd never have been so
foolish, as to deprive themselves of
the benefit of that Ease and Security,
which a good agreement with
their Men might have afforded âem.
âTis true the same Histories tell us,
that there were whole Countries
where were none but Men, which
borderâd upon âem. But this makes
still for us; for it shews that the
Conditions of their Society were
not so easie, as to engage their Women
to stay amongst âem; but as liberty
presented it self, they withdrew

25
and retired to the
Amazons
:
But since our Sex can hardly boast
of so great Privileges, and so easie
a Servitude any where as in
England
,
I cut this ungrateful Digression
short in acknowledgment; thoâ
Fetters of Gold are still Fetters, and
the softest Lining can never make
âem so easy, as Liberty.

You will excuse, I know Madam,
this short, but necessary Digression.
I call it necessary, because it shews
a probable Reason, why We are at
this time in such subjection to them,
without lessening the Opinion of
our Sense, or Natural Capacities either
at present, or for the time
past; beside that it briefly lays open
without any Scandal to our
Sex, why our Improvements are at
present so disproportionâd to those
of Men. I wouâd not have any of
our little, unthinking Adversaries
triumph at my allowing a disproportion
between the Improvements
of our Sex and theirs; and I am
sure those of âem that are ingenious
Men, will see no reason for it from
what I have said.

26
After having granted so great a
disparity as I have already done in
the customary Education, and advantagious
Liberties of the Sexes,
âtwere Nonsense to maintain, that
our Society is generally and upon
all accounts as Beneficial, Improving
and Entertaining, as that of
Men. He must be a very shallow
Fellow, that resorts to, and frequents
us in hopes by our means
to make himself considerable as a
Schollar, a Mathematician, a Philosopher, or a States-man. These
Arts and Sciences are the result only
of much Study and great Experience;
and without one at least of
âem are no more to be acquirâd by
the Company of Men, however
celebrated for any or all of them,
than by ours. But there are other
Quallifications, which are as indispensably necessary to a Gentleman,
or any Man that wouâd appear to
Advantage in the World, which
are attainable only by Company,
and Conversation, and chiefly by
ours. Nor can the greatest part of
Mankind, of what Quallity soever,

27
boast much of the use they make,
or the benefit they reap from these
acknowledgâd Advantages. So that
Schollars only, and some few of
the more thinking Gentlemen, and
Men of Business have any just
claim to âem. And of these the
first generally fall short enough
some other way to make the Ballance
even.

|
Character of a Pedant.
|

For Schollars, though
by their acquaintance with Books,
and conversing much with Old Authors,
they may know perfectly
the Sense of the Learned Dead,
and be perfect Masters of the Wisdom,
be throughly informâd of the
State, and nicely skillâd in the Policies
of Ages long since past, yet
by their retirâd and unactive Life,
their neglect of Business, and constant
Conversation with Antiquity,
they are such Strangers to, and
to ignorant of the Domestick Affairs
and manners of their own
Country and Times, that they appear
like the Ghosts of Old Romans
raisâd by Magick. Talk to
them of the
Assyrian
, or
Perssian

Monarchies, the
Grecians
or
Roman

28
Common-wealths. They answer like
Oracles, they are such finishâd Statemen,
that we shouâd scarce take
âem to have been less than Confifidents
of
Semiramis
, Tutours to

Cyrus
the great, old Cronies of
Solon

and
Lycurgus
, or Privy Councellours
at least to the Twelve
CÃ¦sars

successively; but engage them in
a Discourse that concerns the present
Times, and their Native Country,
and they heardly speak the Language
of it, and know so little of the affairs
of it, that as much might reasonably
be expected from an animated

Egyptian
Mummy. They
are very much disturbed to see a
Fold or a Plait amiss the Picture
of an Old
Roman
Gown, yet take
no notice that their own are thredbare
out at the Elbows, or Ragged,
and suffer more if
Priscians

Head be broken then if it were
their own. They are excellent
Guides, and can direct you to every
Ally, and turning in old
Rome
;
yet lose their way at home in their
own Parish. They are mighty admirers
of the Wit and Eloquence of

29
the Ancients; yet had they livâd
in the time of
Cicero
, and
CÃ¦sar

wouâd have treated them with as
much supercilious Pride, and disrespect
as they do now with Reverence.
They are great hunters of
ancient Manuscripts, and have in
great Veneration any thing, that
has scapâd the Teeth of Time and
Rats, and if Age have obliterated
the Characters, âtis the more valuable
for not being legible. But if
by chance they can pick out one
Word, they rate it higher then the
whole Author in Print, and wouâd
give more for one Proverb of
Solomons

under his own Hand, then
for all his Wisdom. These Superstitious,
bigotted Idolaters of time
past, are Children in their understanding
all their lives; for they
hang so incessantly upon the leading
Strings of Authority, that their
Judgments like the Limbs of some

Indian
Penitents, become altogether
crampt and motionless for want
of use.

30
But as these Men, will hardly be
reckonâd much superiour to us upon
the account of their Learning or
Improvements, so neither will I suppose
another sort diametrically opposite
to these in their Humors and
Opinions:

|
Character of a Country Squire.
|

I mean those whose Ancestors
have been wise and provident,
and raisâd Estates by their Ingenuity
and Industry, and given all their
Posterity after âem Means, and Leisure
to be Fools. These are generally
sent to School in their Minority,
and were they kept there till
they came to Years of Discretion,
might most of âem stay, till they
couâd tuck their Beards into their
Girdles before they left carrying a
Satchel. In conformity to Custom,
and the Fashion, they are sent early
to serve an Apprenticeship to
Letters, and for eight or nine years
are whipt up and down through
two or three Counties from School
to School; when being arrivâd a Sixteen,
or Seventeen Years of Age,
and having made the usual
Tour

of Latin, and Greek Authors, they
are callâd Home to be made Gentlemen.

31
As soon as the young Squire
has got out of the House of Bondage,
shaken off the awe of Birch,
and begins to feel himself at Liberty,
he considers that he is now
Learned enough, (and âtis ten to
one but his Friends are wise enough
to be of his Opinion) and thinks
it high time to shake off the barbarous
Acquaintance he contracted,
with those crabbed, vexatious, obscure
Fellows, that gave him so
much trouble and smart at School,
Companions by no means fit for a
Gentleman, that writ only to torment
and perplex poor Boys, and
exercise the tyranny of Pedants and
School-masters. These prudent resolutions
taken, his Conversation
for some years succeeding is wholly
taken up by his Horses, Dogs
and Hawks (especially if his Residence
be in the Country) and the
more sensless Animals that tend âem.
His Groom, his Huntsman, and his
Falconer are his Tutors, and his
walk is from the Stable to the
Dog-kennel, and the reverse of it. His
diversion is drudgery, and he is in

32
highest satisfaction when he is most
tirâd. He wearies you in the Morning
with his Sport, in the Afternoon
with the noisie Repetition and Drink,
and the whole Day with Fatigue
and Confusion. His Entertainment
is stale Beer, and the History of
his Dogs and Horses, in which he
gives you the Pedigree of every one
with all the exactness of a Herald;
and if you be very much in his
good Graces, âtis odds, but he makes
you the Compliment of a Puppy of
one of his favourite Bitches, which
you must take with abundance of
Acknowledgments of his Civillity,
or else he takes you for a stupid,
as well as an ill bred Fellow. He
is very constant at all Clubs and
Meetings of the Country Gentlemen,
where he will suffer nothing
to be talkâd or hearâd of but his
Jades, his Curs, and his Kites. Upon
these he rings perpetual Changes,
and trespasses as much upon
the patience of the Company in the
Tavern, as upon their Enclosures
in the Field, and is least impertinent,
when most drunk.

33
His grand Business is to make
an Assignation for a Horse Race,
or a Hunting Match, and nothing
discomposes him so much as a Disappointment.
Thus accomplishâd,
and finishâd for a Gentleman, he
enters the Civil Lists, and holds
the Scale of Justice with as much
Blindness as she is said to do. From
hence forward his Worship becomes
as formidable to the Ale-Houses,
as he was before Familiar; he sizes
an Ale Pot, and takes the dimensions
of Bread with great Dexterity
and Sagacity. He is the terrour
of all the Deer, and Poultry
Stealers in the Neighbourhood,
and is so implacable a Persecutor
of Poachers, that he keeps a Register
of all the Dogs and Guns in
the Hundred, and is the Scare-Beggar
of the Parish. Short Pots, and
unjustifiable Dogs and Nets, furnish
him with sufficient matter for
Presentments, to carry him once a
Quarter to the Sessions; where he
says little, Eats and Drinks much,
and after Dinner, Hunts over the
last Chace, and so rides Worshipfully

34
Drunk home again. At home
he Exercises his Authority in granting
his Letters, Pattents to Petitioners
for erecting Shovel Board,
Tables and Ginger Bread Stalls.
If he happen to live near any little
Borough or Corporation that sends
Burgesses to Parliament, he may become
ambitious and sue for the Honour
of being made their Representative.
Henceforward he grows
Popular, bows to, and treats
the Mob all round him; and whether
there be any in his Discourse
or not, there is good Sense in his
Kitchin and his Cellar, which is
more agreeable and edifying. If
he be so happy as to out-tap his
Competitour, and Drink his Neighbours
into an Opinion of his Sobriety,
he is chosen, and up he
comes to that Honourable Assembly,
where he shews his Wisdom
best by his Silence, and serves his
Country most in his absence.

I give you these two Characters,

Madam
, as irreconcileable as Water
and Oyl, to shew that Men

35
may and do often Baffle and Frustrate
the Effects of a liberal Education,
as well by Industry as Negligence.
âTis hard to say, which
of these two is the more Sottish;
the first is such an Admirer of Letters,
that he thinks it a disparagement
to his Learning to talk what
other Men understand, and will
scarce believe that two, and two,
make four, under a Demonstration
from
Euclid
, or a Quotation of
Aristotle
:
The latter has such a fear
of Pedantry always before his Eyes,
that he thinks it a Scandal to his
good Breeding, and Gentility to
talk Sense, or write true
English
;
and has such a contemptible Notion
of his past Education, that he
thinks the
Roman
Poets good for
nothing but to teach Boys to cap
Verses. For my Part I think the
Learned, and Unlearned Blockhead
pretty equal; for âtis all one to
me, whether a Man talk Nonsense,
or Unintelligible Sense, I am diverted
and edified alike by either;
the one enjoys himself less, but suffers
his Friends to do it more; the

36
other enjoys himself and his own
Humour enough, but will let no
body else do it in his Company.
Thus,
Madam
, I have set them before
You, and shall leave you to
determine a Point, which I cannot.

The Education of the Female Sex not so deficient as commonly thought.

There are others that deserve to
be brought into the Company of
these upon like Honourable Reasons;
but I keep them in reserve
for a proper place, where I may
perhaps take the Pains to draw
their Pictures to the Life at full
length. Let us now return to our
Argument, from which we have
had a long breathing while. Let
us look into the manner of our
Education, and see wherein it falls
short of the Mens, and how the
defects of it may be, and are generally
supplyâd. In our tender years
they are the same, for after Children
can Talk, they are promiscuously
taught to Read and Write by
the same Persons, and at the same
time both Boys and Girls. When
these are acquirâd, which is generally

37
about the Age of Six or Seven
Years, they begin to be separated,
and the Boys are sent to the
Grammer
School
, and the Girls to
Boarding
Schools
, or other places, to learn
Needle Work, Dancing, Singing,
Musick, Drawing, Painting, and
other Accomplishments, according
to the Humour and Ability of the
Parents, or Inclination of the Children.
Of all these, Reading and
Writing are the main Instruments
of Conversation; though Musick
and Painting may be allowâd to contribute
something towards it, as
they give us an insight into two
Arts, that makes up a great Part
of the Pleasures and Diversions of
Mankind. Here then lies the main
Defect, that we are taught only
our Mother Tongue, or perhaps

French
, which is now very fashionable,
and almost as Familiar amongst
Women of Quality as Men; whereas
the other Sex by means of a
more extensive Education to the
knowledge of the
Roman
and
Greek

Languages, have a vaster Feild for
their Imaginations to rove in, and

38
their Capacities thereby enlargâd.
To see whether this be strictly true
or not, I mean in what relates to
our debate, I will for once suppose,
that we are instructed only in our
own Tongue, and then enquire
whether the disadvantage be so
great as it is commonly imaginâd.
You know very well,
Madam
, that
for Conversation, it is not requisite
we should be Philologers, Rhetoricians,
Philosophers, Historians or
Poets; but only that we should
think pertinently and express our
thoughts properly, on such matters
as are the proper Subjects for a
mixt Conversation. The
Italians
,
a People as delicate in their Conversation
as any in the World,
have a Maxim that our selves, our
Neighbours, Religion, or Business
ought never to be the Subject.

|
Religion, &c. no proper subjects for mixt Conversation.
|

There are very substantial Reasons,
to be given for these Restrictions
for Men are very apt to be vain,
and impertinent, when they talk of
themselves, besides that others are
very jealous, and apt to suspect,
that all the good things said, are

39
intended as so many arguments of
preference to them. When they
speak of their Neighbours, they are
apt out of a Principle of Emulation
and Envy, natural to all the race of

Adam
to lessen, and tarnish their
Fame, whether by open Scandal,
and Defamatory Stories, and Tales,
or by malicious Insinuations, invidious
Circumstances, sinister and
covert Reflections. This humour
springs from an over fondness of
our selves, and a mistaken conceit
that anothers loss is an addition to
our own Reputation, as if like two
Buckets, one must necessarily rise
as the other goes down. This is
the basest and most ungenerous of
all our natural Failures, and ought
to be corrected as much as possible
eâry where; but more especially in

Italy
, where Resentments are carried
so high, and Revenges prosecuted
with so much Heat, and Animosity.
Religion is likewise very
tender there, as in all other
places, where the Priests have so
much Power and Authority. But
even here, where our differences

40
and Disputes have made it more
tame, and usâd it to rough handling,
it ought carefully to be avoided;
for nothing raises unfriendly
warmths among Company more than
a religious Argument, which therefore
ought to be banisht all Society intended
only for Conversation and Diversion.
Business is too dry and barren
to give any Spirit to Conversation, or
Pleasure to a Company, and is therefore
rather to be reckonâd among
the Encumbrances than Comforts of
Life, however necessary. Besides
these, Points of Learning, abstruse
Speculations, and nice Politicks,
ought, in my opinion, to be excluded;
because being things that require
much Reading and Consideration,
they are not fit to be canvasâd

ex tempore
in mixt Company, of
which âtis probable the greatest part
will have little to say to âem, and
will scarce be content to be silent
Hearers only; besides that they are
not in their nature gay enough to
awaken the good Humour, or raise
the Mirth of the Company. Nor
need any one to fear, that by these

41
limitations Conversation shouâd be
restrainâd to too narrow a compass,
there are subjects enough that are
in themselves neither insipid, nor
offensive; such as Love, Honour,
Gallantry, Morality, News, Raillery,
and a numberless train of other
Things copious and diverting. Now
I canât see the necessity of any other
Tongue beside our own to enable
us to talk plausibly, or judiciously
upon any of these Topicks: Nay, I
am very confident that âtis possible
for an ingenious Person to make a
very considerable progress in most
parts of Learning, by the help of
English only.

|
Great Improvements to be made by the help of English Books only.
|

For the only reason
I can conceive of learning Languages,
is to arrive at the Sense, Wit
or Arts, that have been communicated
to the World in âem. Now
of those that have taken the pains
to make themselves Masters of those
Treasures, many have been so generous
as to impart a share of âem
to the Publick, by Translations for
the use of the Unlearned; and I flatter
my self sometimes, that several
of these were more particularly undertaken

42
by Ingenious, good Naturâd
Men in Kindness and Compassion
to our Sex. But whatever
the Motives were, the obliging
Humour has so far prevailâd, that
scarce any thing either Ancient or
Modern that might be of general
use either for Pleasure, or Instruction
is left untouchâd, and most
of them are made entirely free of
our Tongue. I am no Judge either
of the Accuracy, or Elegance
of such Performances; but if I may
credit the report of Learned and
Ingenious Gentlemen, (whose Judgment
or Sincerity I have no reason
to question) many of those excellent
Authors have lost nothing by
the change of Soil. I can see and
admire the Wit and Fancy of
Ovid

in the Translation of his Epistles,
and Elegies, the softness and Passion
of
Tibullus
, the Impetuosity
and Fire of
Juvenal
, the Gayety,
Spirit and Judgment of
Horace
;
who, though he may appear very
different from himself through the
diversity, and inequality of the
Hands concernâd in making him

43
speak
English
, yet may easily be
guessâd at from the several excellent
Pieces renderâd by the Earl of

Roscommon
, Mr.
Cowley
, Mr.
Dryden
,
Mr.
Congreve
, Mr.
Brown
and
other ingenious Gentlemen, who
have obligâd the Nation with their
excellent Versions of some parts of
him. Nor is it possible to be insensible
of the sweetness and Majesty
of
Virgil
, after having read
those little but Divine Samples
already made Publick in
English

by Mr.
Dryden
, which gives
us so much Impatience to see the
whole Work entire by that admirable
Hand. I have heard some ingenious
Gentlemen say, That
it
was impossible to do Justice in
our Tongue to these two last
Celebrated Roman Poets,
and
I have known others, of whose
Judgments I have as high an Opinion,
affirm the contrary; my ignorance
of Latin disables me from
determining whether we are in the
right, but the Beauty of what I
have already seen by the means of
those Gentlemen, has so far prejudicâd

44
me in favour of the latter; that
might I have âem entire from the
same hands, I think I shouâd scarce
envy those who can tast the pleasure
of the Originals. Nor is it to
the Poets only, that we stand indebted
for the Treasure of Antiquity,
we have no less Engagements to
those, who have successfully labourâd
in Prose, and have mads us
familiar with
Plutarch
,
Seneca
,
Cicero
,
and in general with all the famous
Philosophers, Orators and Historians,
from whom we may at once
learn both the Opinions and Practices
of their Times. Assisted by these
helps, âtis impossible for any Woman
to be ignorant that is but desirous
to be otherwise, though she know
no part of Speech out of her Mother
Tongue. But these are neither
the only, nor the greatest Advantages
we have; all that is excellent
in
France
,
Italy
, or any of our
neighbouring Nations is now become
our own; to one of whom, I
may be bold to say, we are beholding
for more, and greater Improvements
of Conversation, than to all

45
Antiquity, and the learned Languages
together.

|
The name of Learning unjustly restrained to the knowledge of Latin
and Greek
only.
|

Nor can I imagine
for what good Reason a Man skillâd
in Latin and Greek, and versâd in
the Authors of Ancient Times shall
be callâd Learned; yet another who
perfectly understands
Italian
,
French
,

Spanish
,
High Dutch
, and the rest of
the
European
Languages, is acquainted
with the Modern History of all
those Countries, knows their Policies,
has divâd into all the Intrigues
of the several Courts, and can tell
their mutual Dispositions, Obligations
and Ties of Interest one to another,
shall after all this be thought
Unlearned for want of those two
Languages. Nay, though he be never
so well versâd in the Modern
Philosophy, Astronomy, Geometry
and Algebra, he shall notwithstanding
never be allowâd that honourable
Title. I can see but one apparent
Reason for this unfair Procedure;
which is, that when about
an Age and an half ago, all the poor
Remains of Learning then in Being,
were in the hands of the Schoolmen;

46
they wouâd suffer none to
pass Muster, that were not deeply
engagâd in those intricate, vexatious
and unintelligible Trifles, for which
themselves contended with so much
Noise and Heat; or at least were
not acquainted with
Plato
and
Aristotle
,
and their Commentators; from
whence the Sophistry and Subtleties
of the Schools at that time
were drawn. This Usurpation was
maintainâd by their Successors, the
Divines, who to this day pretend
almost to the Monopoly of Learning;
and though some generous Spirits
have in good measure broke
the neck of this Arbitrary, Tyrannical
Authority; yet canât they prevail
to extend the name of Learning
beyond the Studies, in which
the Divines are more particularly
conversant. Thus you shall have
âem allow a Man to be a wise Man,
a good Naturalist, a good Mathematician,
Politician, or Poet, but
not a Scholar, a learned Man, that
is no Philologer. For my part I
think these Gentlemen have just inverted
the use of the Term, and given

47
that to the knowledge of words,
which belongs more properly to
Things. I take Nature to be the
great Book of Universal Learning,
which he that reads best in all or
any of its Parts, is the greatest
Scholar, the most learned Man;
and âtis as ridiculous for a Man to
count himself more learned than
another, if he have no greater extent
of knowledge of things, because
he is more versâd in Languages;
as it would be for an Old
Fellow to tell a Young One, his
Eyes were better than his, because
he Reads with Spectacles, the other
without.

English Books the best helps to Conversation.

Thus,
Madam
, you see we may
come in Time to put in for Learning,
if we have a mind, without
falling under the Correction of
Pedants. But I will let Learning
alone at present, because I have
already banishâd it (though not
out of disrespect) from mixâd Conversation;
to which we will return,
and of which the greatest
Magazines and Supports are still

48
in Reserve. I mean the many excellent
Authors of our own Country,
whose Works it were endless
to recount. Where is Love, Honour
and Bravery more lively represented
than in our Tragedies,
who has given us Nobler, or juster
Pictures of Nature than Mr.

Shakespear
? Where is there a tenderer
Passion, than in the Maids
Tragedy? Whose Grief is more
awful and commanding than Mr.

Otways
? Whose Descriptions more
Beautifull, or Thoughts more Gallant
than Mr.
Drydens
? When I see
any of their Plays acted, my Passions
move by their Direction, my
Indignation, my Compassion,
my
Grief are all at their Beck.
Nor is our Comedy at all inferiour
to our Tragedy; for, not to
mention those already namâd for
the other part of the Stage, who
are all excellent in this too, Sir

George Etherege
and Sir
Charles Sedley

for neat Raillery and Gallantry
are without Rivals, Mr.
Wicherley

for strong Wit, pointed Satyr, sound
and useful Observations is beyond

49
Imitation; Mr.
Congreve
for sprightly,
gentile, easie Wit falls short of
no Man. These are the Masters
of the Stage; but there are others
who though of an inferiour Class,
yet deserve Commendation, were
that at present my Business. Nay,
even the worst of âem afford us
some diversion; for I find a sort of
foolish Pleasure, and can laugh at
Mr.
Dâây
âs Farce, as I do at the
Tricks, and Impertinencies of a
Monkey; and was pleased to see
the humour and delight of the Author
in Mr.
Hâân
âs Eating, and
Drinking Play which I fancyâd was
written in a Victualling House. In
short, were it not for the too great
frequency of loose Expressions, and
wanton Images, I should take our
Theaters for the best Schools in the
World of Wit, Humanity, and
Manners; which they might easily
become by retrenching that too
great Liberty. Neither have the
Poets only, but the Criticks too
Endeavourâd to compleat us; Mr.

Dennis
and Mr.
Rimer
have by their
Ingenious, and judicious labours

50
taught us to admire the Beauties
as we ought, and to know the
faults of the former. Nor are we
less beholding to these for forming
our Judgments, than to those for
raising our Fancies.

These are the Sources from whence
we draw our gayer part of Conversation;
I donât mean in exclusion
to the other parts of Poetry, in
most of which (as I have heard
good Judges say) we equal at least
the Ancients, and far surpass all
the Moderns. I honour the Names,
and admire the Writings of
Denham
,

Suckling
and
Dâavenant
, I am
ravishâd with the Fancy of
Cowley
,
and the Gallantry of
Waller
. I reverence
the
Fairy Queen
, am raisâd,
and elevated with
Paradise Lost
,

Prince Arthur
composes and reduces
me to a State of Yawning indifference,
and Mr.
Wâstlây
âs
Heroicks

lull me to Sleep. Thus all Ranks and
Degrees of Poets have their use, and
may be serviceable to some body
or other from the Prince to the Pastry
Cook, or Past-board Box-maker.

51
I should mention our Satyrists,
but it would be endless
to descend to every particular,
of these Mr.
Oldham
is admirable,
and to go no further, the inimitable
Mr.
Butler
will be an everlasting
Testimony, of the Wit of
his Age, and Nation, and bid eternal
defiance to the Wits of all
Countries, and future Ages to follow
him in a Path before untrackâd.
Our Prose Writers, that are eminent
for a gay Style and Iovial Argument,
are so many, that it would
swell this Letter too much to name
âem, so that I shall only take notice,
that whoever can read without
Pleasure, or Laughter,
The contempt
of the Clergy
, and the following
Letters and Dialogues by
the same Author, or the facetious
Dialogues of Mr.
Brown
must be
more Splenetick than
Heraclitus
, or
more stupid, than the Ass he laughâd
at.

Nor are we less provided for the
serious Part; Morality has generally
been the Province of our

52
Clergy who have treated of all parts
of it very largely with so much
Piety, Solidity, and Eloquence,
that as I think I may venture to
say, they have written more upon it
than the Clergy of all the rest of
the World; so I believe no Body
will deny that they have written
better. Yet I couâd wish, that our
Ingenious Gentlemen wouâd employ
their Pens oftner on these Subjects;
because the severity of the
otherâs Profession obliges âem to
write with an Air, and in a Style
less agreable, and inviting to
Young People, Not that we are
without many excellent Pieces of
Morality, Humanity and Civil Prudence
written by, and like Gentlemen.
But it is the Excellence of
âem, and the ability of our Gentlemen,
which appears in the Spirit,
Wit, and curious Observations in
those Pieces, which make me desire
more of the same Nature, Who can
read the Essays of that Wonderful
Man my Lord
Bacon
, or the no less
to be admirâd Sir
Walter Raleigh
âs,
or Mr.
Osborns
advice to a Son,

53
the
Advice to a Daughter
, Sir
William
Temple
âs, or Sir
George Machenzie
âs
Essays, Sir
Roger LâEstrange
âs
Esop (to which last we are likewise
obligâd for an incomparable
Version of
Seneca
) and abundance
of others, without wishing for more
from the same or the like hands?
Our Neighbours the
French
, have
written a great deal of this kind,
of the best of which we have the
benefit in
English
; but more particularly
the
Sieurs
,
Montagne
,
Rochefaucaut
,
and St.
Evremont
deserve
to be immortal in all Languages.
I need not mention any more,
it is apparent from these that Women
want not the means of being
Wise and Prudent without more
Tongues than one; nay, and Learned
too, if they have any Ambition to
be so.

The numberless Treatises of Antiquities,
Philosophy, Mathematicks,

Natural, and other History
(in which I canât pass silently by,
that learned One of Sir
Walter Raleigh
,
which the World he writ of

54
canât match) written originally in,
or translated to our Tongue are
sufficient to lead us a great way
into any Science our Curiousity shall
prompt us to. The greatest difficulty
we struggled with, was the
want of a good Art of Reasoning,
which we had not, that I know of,
till that defect was supplyâd by the
greatest Master of that Art Mr.

Locke
, whose Essay on Human Understanding
makes large amends for
the want of all others in that
kind.

Thus Madam I have endeavourâd
to obviate all our Adversarieâs
Objections, by touching upon as
great a Variety of things relating
to the Subject as I conveniently
couâd. Yet I hope I have troubled
you with nothing but what was
necessary to make my way clear,
and plain before me; and I am apt
to think I have made it appear, that
nothing but disencouragement or an
Idle Uncurious Humour can hinder
us from Rivalling most Men in the
knowledge of great Variety of

55
things, without the help of more
Tongues than our Own; which the
Men so often reproachfully tell us
is enough. This Idleness is but
too frequently to be found among
us, but âtis a Fault equally common
to both Sexes. Those that
have means to play the Fool all
their lives, seldom care for the
trouble of being made wise. We
are naturally Lovers of our Ease,
and have great apprehensions of the
difficulty of things untryâd; Especially
in matters of Learning, the
common Methods of acquiring
which are so unpleasant, and uneasie.
I doubt not but abundance
of noble Wits are stiffled in both
Sexes, for want but of suspecting
what they were able to do, and
with how much facility. Experience
shews us every day Blockheads,
that arrive at a moderate,
nay sometimes a great Reputation
by their Confidence, and brisk attempts
which they maintain by
their Diligence; while great Numbers
of Men naturally more Ingenious
lye neglected by, for

56
want of Industry to improve,
or Courage to exert themselves.
No Man certainly but wishes he
had the Reputation in, and were
Respected and Esteemâd by the
World as he sees some Men are for
the Fruits of their Pens; but they
are loth to be at the pains of an
Attempt, or doubt their sufficience
to perform; or what I believe is
most general, never to enquire so
far into themselves, and their own
Abilities, as to bring such a thought
into their Heads. This last I fancy
is the true Reason, why our Sex,
who are commonly charged with
talking too much, are Guilty of
Writing so little. I wish they
would shake of this lazy Despondence,
and let the noble examples
of the deservedly celebrated Mrs.

Philips
, and the incomparable Mrs.

Behn
rouse their Courages, and
shew Mankind the great injustice
of their Contempt. I am confident
they would find no such need of
the assistance of Languages as is
generally imaginâd.

|
Ignorance of Latine
&c.
no disadvantage.
|

Those that
have of their own need not graft

57
upon Foreign Stocks. I have often
thought that the not teaching
Women Latin and Greek, was an
advantage to them, if it were rightly
considerâd, and might be improvâd
to a great heigth. For
Girles after they can Read and
Write (if they be of any Fashion)
are taught such things as take not
up their whole time, and not being
sufferâd to run about at liberty
as Boys, are furnishâd among other
toys with Books, such as
Romances
,

Novels
,
Plays
and
Poems
;
which though they read carelessly
only for Diversion, yet unawares
to them, give âem very early a considerable
Command both of Words
and Sense; which are further improvâd
by their making and receiving
Visits with their Mothers,
which gives them betimes the opportunity
of imitating, conversing
with, and knowing the manner,
and address of elder Persons. These
I take to be the true Reasons why
a Girl of Fifteen is reckonâd as ripe
as a Boy of One and Twenty, and
not any natural forwardness of

58
Maturity as some People would
have it. These advantages the Education
of Boys deprives them of,
who drudge away the Vigour of
their Memories at Words, useless
ever after to most of them, and at
Seventeen or Eighteen are to begin
their Alphabet of Sense, and
are but where the Girles were at
Nine or Ten. Yet because they
have learnt Latin and Greek, reject
with Scorn all
English
Books
their best helps, and lay aside their
Latin ones, as if they were already
Masters of all that Learning,
and so hoist Sail for the wide
World without a Compass to Steer
by. Thus I have fairly stated the
difference between us, and can find
no such disparity in Nature or Education
as they contend for; but
we have a sort of ungenerous Adversaries,
that deal more in Scandal
than Argument, and when they
canât hurt us with their Weapons,
endeavour to annoy us with stink
Pots. Let us see therefore,
Madam
,
whether we canât beat them
from their Ammunition, and turn

59
their own Artillery upon them;
for I firmly believe there is nothing,
which they charge upon us, but
may with more Justice be retorted
upon themselves.

They tax us with a long List of
Faults, and Imperfections, and
seem to have taken a Catalogue of
their own Follies and Vices, not
with design to correct them, but
to shift of the Imputation to us.
There is no doubt, but particular
Women may be found upon whom
every charge may be justified; but
our Sex is not answerable for
them, till they prove there are no
such Men, which will not be before
Dooms-day. However, like ill
Neighbours they bring the Dirt
out of their own Homes not out of
Neatness, but out of Envy to their
Neighbours, at whose Doors they
lay it. But let them remove their
Follies as oft as they please, they
are still as constant to them, as the

Needle
to the
North Pole
, they
point them out which way soever
they move. Let us see what these

60
Qualities are, they so liberally bestow
upon us, and after see how they
fit the Donours, and survey âem
in their proper Figures and Colours.
The most familiar of these
are Vanity, Impertinence, Enviousness,
Dissimulation, Inconstancy,

&c.

Vanity.

To begin with Vanity, it is a
Failing the greatest Part of Mankind
are tinctured with, more or
less. For all Men are apt to flatter
themselves with a Fancy, that
they have some one or more good
Quallities, or extraordinary Gifts,
that raise âem above the ordinary
Level of Men; and therefore hug
and cherish, what they think
valuable and singular in âem. It is
never commendable, sometimes pardonable,
when the excellencies
are real, and it is moderate so
much must be allowâd to humane
frailty. It is ridiculous and intollerable
when it is extravagant, misplacâd,
or groundless. It is very
injudicious, and makes men commonly
dote on their Defects, and

61
expose their blemishes by their
Fondness, which makes âem more
remarkable by the care and ornament
bestowâd on âem. It persuades
hard Favourâd and distorted
Fellows to dress, and value their
Persons, Cowards to pretend to
Courage, and provoke Beatings,
Blockheads to set up for Wit, and
make themselves ridiculous in Print,
Upstarts to brag of their Families,
and be reminded of the Garrets they
were born, and the Stalls they
were brought up in. In Women
the object of it is their Beauty,
and is excusable in those that have
it. Those that have it not may
be pardonâd, if they endeavour at
it; because it is the only undisputed
advantage our Sex has over
the other, and what makes âem
respected beyond all other Perfections,
and is alone adorâd. In Men
it has not only this Object, but
all those before mentionâd, and a
hundred other. It is admirably
seen in a Writing, reciting Fop Author,
is in full Lustre in a Beau,
but its most unlucky Prospect is in

62
a Swaggering Coward, who is a
Fool beyond the Conviction of
Smart.

|
Character of a Bully.
|

His Courage is like an
Ague Fit, that leaves him upon a
Fright, and returns when he is
out of the reach of a Cudgel.
He spends much time in the Fencing
School, and Fights briskly
where there is no danger of Wounds
nor Smart. His Hands are instructed,
but his Heels do him all the
Service. He is a nice observer of
Punctilioâs, and takes more Affronts
than are given him. He
draws first, and runs first, and if
ever he makes another Man run,
it is after him. He is a Pebble that
sparkles like a Diamond, but wants
hardness. He talks perpetually of
what he will do, but thinks continually
of what he shall suffer. He
is often in Quarels, yet seldom in
Rencounters, and is glad of a
Challenge, that he may know
whom, and when to avoid. He
brings up the Rear at an Engagement,
and leads the Van in the
Retreat. He is a Man of much
Passion, but the most predominant

63
is his Fear. He offers affronts readily,
but has too much honour to
justifie them, and will submit to any
terms of satisfaction rather than
occasion Blood-shed. He is so full
of Courage, that it boils over when
there is no occasion, and his
Sword

and
Person
are always at Leisure,
and at your Service, till you want
them, and then to his great Trouble,
he is always indispensably engagâd
otherwise. He wears
Red
,
and a long
Sword
openly to shew
his Valour, and
Mail
, privately to
shew his Discretion. He threatens
terribly, but he is like a Witch, if
you draw Blood of him, he has no
power to hurt you. No Man shews
or boasts more of his Scars with
less Reason. He scorns to take a
blow in the Face, and a Back-piece
is as good to him as a whole sute
of Armour. He is at first the Terrour
of all the
Young Bullies
, at
last their Maygame, and they blood
their
Cub Hectors
upon him, as
they do young
Beagles
on a
Hare
.
Good usage makes him insolent,
but he fawns like a
Spaniel
most

64
upon those that beat him. When
he is discoverâd by all the rest of the
World, the Cheat passes still upon
himself, and he is pleasâd with the
terrible Figure he makes in his
Glass, thoâ he is ready to shake at
his own Shaddow.

Character of a Scowrer.

There are men of an humour directly
opposite to this, yet eâry whit as
Mad, Foolish, and Vain; these
are your Men of nice Honour,
that love Fighting for the sake of
Blows, and are never well but when
they are wounded They are severe
Interpreters of Looks, are affronted
at every Face that donât please âem,
and like true Cocks of the Game
have a quarrel to all Mankind at
first sight. They are passionate
Admirers of scarrâd Faces, and dote
on a Wooden Leg. They receive
a Challenge like a
Billet Douce
,
and a home thrust as a Favour.
Their common Adversary is the
Constable, and their usual Lodging
the Counter. Broken heads are a
diversion, and an Arm in a Scarfe
is a high satisfaction. They are frugal

65
in their expences with the Taylor,
for they have their Doublets
pinkt on their Backs, but they
are as good as an Annuity to
the Surgeon, thoâ they need him
not to let âem blood.
Flanders
is
their Mistress, and a Clap from
her carries âem off the Stage. If
they return, an
Hospital
is their
Retreat, or the
Sheriff
their Executour.
These two,
Madam
, are
very different extravagances, and
very strange oneâs, yet they are
real, and such as appear every
day. But, what is most to be wonderâd
at, arise both from the same
Principle, and the same mistaken
Notion, and are only differencâd by
the diversity of Tempers in Men.
The common Motive to both is
Vanity, and they jointly concurr
in this Opinion, that Valour is the
most estimable, and most honourable
Quality, that Man is capable of; they
agree in a desire to be honourâd and
fearâd, but they differ in their methods
in persuing this common End. The
one is naturally active, bold and
daring; and therefore takes the
true course to arrive at it by shewing

66
what he can do, by what he
dare suffer, and his immoderate desire
and indiscretion suffer him to
know no bounds. The other is
mean Spirited and fearful, and seeks
by false Fire to Counterfeit a heat
that may pass for genuine to conceal
the Frost in his Blood, and
like an ill Actor, over-does his Part
for want of understanding it, which
âtis impossible he shouâd. Among
peaceable Men, and those of his
own Temper he comes of with Colours
flying, and those are the Men
he wouâd be valiant amongst only,
couâd he read Menâs hearts. But the
first Rencounter betrays the Ass
throâ the Lions Skin, and he is
Cudgelâd like an Ass in Spite of his
Covering. It is our happiness
Madam
,
that we lie under no manner of
Temptation from these two Vanities,

|
Imitation ridiculous.
|

whereof one is so dangerous,
the other so ridiculous. For all
humours that are forcâd against the
natural bent of our tempers must be
so. Nature is our best guide, and
has fitted evâry Man for somethings
more particularly than others; which

67
if they had the sense to prosecute,
they wouâd at least not be ridiculous,
if they were not extaordinary.
But so prevalent are our
Vanity, and this Apish Humour of
Imitation, that we persuade our
selves, that we may practise with
applause, whatever we see another
succeed in, thoâ as contrary to the
intent of our Nature, as Dancing to
an Elephant; so some Men that talk
well of serious matters, are so
movâd at the applause some merry
Drolls gain, that they forget their
gravity, and aiming to be Wits, turn
Buffoons; There are others, that
are so taken with the actions and
grimace of a good Mimick, that
they fall presently to making awkard
Faces and wry Mouths, and
are all their lives after in a Vizor,
Maskt thoâ bare facâd.

These, and innumerable others
of the like Nature, are the lesser
Follies of Mankind, by which
their Vanity makes âem fit only
to be laughâd at. There are others,
who by more studied and

68
refinâd Follies arrive to be more
considerable, and make a great
Figure and Party among their
Sex.

Character of a Beau.

Of the first rank of these is the

Beau
, who is one that has more
Learning in his Heels than his
Head, which is better coverâd
than fillâd. His Taylor and his
Barber are his Cabinet Councel,
to whom he is more beholding
for what he is, than to his
Maker. He is One that has travellâd
to see Fashions, and brought
over with him the newest cut suit,
and the prettiest Fancyâd Ribbands
for Sword Knots. His best Acquaintance
at
Paris
was his Dancing
Master, whom he calls the Marquiss,
and his chief Visits to the
Operaâs. He has seen the
French

King once, and knows the name
of his cheif Minister, and is by
this suffciently convincâd that there
are no Politicians in any other Part
of the World. His improvements
are a nice Skill in the Mode, and a
high Contempt of his own Country,

69
and of Sense. All the knowledge
he has of the Country, or
Manners of it, is in the keeping of
the Valet that followâd him hither,
and all that he retains of the Language
is a few modish words to lard
his discourse with, and shew his
Breeding, and the names of his
Garniture. He shouâd be a Philosopher,
for he studies nothing but
himself, yet evâry one knows him
better, that thinks him not worth
knowing. His looks and gestures
are his constant Lesson, and his
Glass is the Oracle that resolves
all his mighty doubts and scruples.
He examines and refreshes his Complexion
by it, and is more dejected
at a Pimple, than if it were a Cancer.
When his Eyes are set to a
languishing Air, his Motions all
preparâd according to Art, his Wig
and his Coat abundantly Powderâd,
his Gloves Essencâd, and his Handkercher
perfumâd and all the rest
of his Bravery rightly adjusted, the
greatest part of the day, as well
the business of it at home, is over;
âtis time to launch, and down he

70
comes, scented like a Perfumers
Shop, and looks like a Vessel with
all her rigging under sail without
Ballast. A Chair is brought within
the door, for he apprehends
every Breath of Air as much, as if
it were a Hurricane. His first Vesit
is to the
Chocolate
House, and
after a quarter of an Hours Compliment
to himself in the great Glass,
he faces about and salutes the Company,
and puts in practice his Mornings
Meditations; When he has
made his Cringes round, and playâd
over all his Tricks, out comes the
fine
Snush Box
, and his
Nose
is Regalâd
a while: After this he begins
to open, and starts some learned
Arguments about the newest Fashion,
and hence takes occasion to
commend the next Manâs Fancy in
his Cloths, this ushers in a discourse
of the Appearance last
Birth
Night
, or
Ball
at Court, and so a
Critick upon this
Lord
, or that

Ladies
Masquing Habit. From
hence he adjourns to the
Play-house
,
where he is to be met again in the
side Box, from whence he makes

71
his Court to all the Ladies in general
with his Eyes, and is particular
only with the
Orange-Wench
.
After a while he engages some neighbouring
Vizor, and together they
run over all the Boxes, take to
Pieces every Face, examine every
Feature, pass their Censure upon
every one, and so on to their Dress;
here he very Judiciously gives his
opinion upon every particular, and
determines whose Colours are well
chosen, whose Fancy is neatest, and
whose Cloths fit with most Air;
but in conclusion sees no Body compleat
but himself in the whole
House. After this he looks down
with contempt upon the Pit, and
rallies all the slovenly Fellows,
and awkard Beauâs (as he calls
them) of tâother End of the
Town, is mightily offended at their
ill scented
Snush
, and in spight of all
his
Pulvilio
and
Essences
, is overcome
with the stink of their
Cordovant
Gloves
. To close all,
Madam
, in the
Mask must give him an account of
the Scandal of the Town, which
she does in the History of abundance
of Intrigues real or feignâd; at

72
all which he laughs aloud and often,
not to shew his satisfaction, but his
Teeth. She shews him who is
kept by such a Lord, Who was
lately discarded by such a Knight,
for granting favours too indiscreetly
to such a Gentleman: who has
lately been in the Country for two
or three Months upon extraordinary
Occasions. To all which he gives
great attention, that he may pass for
a Man of Intelligence in another
Place. His next Stage is

Locketâs
, where his Vanity, not his
Stomach, is to be gratified with
something that is
little
and
dear
,

Quails
and
Ortalans
are the meanest
of his Diet, and a Spoonful of
Green
Pease
at
Christmass
, are worth to
him more than the inheritance of
the
Feild
where they grow in
Summer
.
Every thing falls in his Esteem,
as it falls in price, and he
wouâd not so much as tast the

Wine
, if the hard name, and the
high rate did not give it a relish.
After a glass or two, (for a Pint
is his stint) he begins to talk of
his Intrigues, boasts much of the
Favours he has receivâd, and shews

73
counterfeit Tokens, and in Conclusion,
slanders some Lady or other
of unquestionâd Vertue with a particular
fondness for him. His
Amours are all profound Secrets,
yet he makes a Confidence of âem
to every Man he meets with. He
pretends a great reverence for the
Ladies, and a mighty tenderness
of their Reputations; yet he is
like a
Flesh Flye
, whatever he blows
on is tainted. He talks of nothing
under Quality, thoâ he never obtainâd
a Favour, which his Man
might not have for half a Crown.
He and his Footman in this Case are
like
English
and
Dutch
at an Ordinary
in
Holland
, the Fare is the
same, but the Price is vastly different.
Thus the Show goes forward,
till he is beaten for Trespasses he
was never guilty of, and shall be
damnâd for Sins he never Committed.
At last, with his Credit as
low as his Fortune he retires sullenly
to his Cloister, the
Kingâs-Bench
,
or
Fleet
, and passes the rest
of his days in Privacy, and Contemplation.
Here,
Madam
, if you

74
please weeâl give him one
Visit

more, and see the last
Act
of the

Farce
; and you shall find him
(whose Sobriety was before a
Vice
,
as being only the
Pimp
to his
other
Pleasures
, and who fearâd a
lighted
Pipe
as much as if it had
been a great
Gun
levellâd at him)
with his
Nose Flaming
, and his

Breath
stinking of Spirits worse
than a
Dutch Tarpawlinâs
, and smoking
out of a short
Pipe
, that for some
Months has been kept hot as constantly
as a
Glass-House
, and so I
leave him to his Meditation.

You wouâd think it yet more
strange, that any one should be

Slovenly
and
Nasty
out of
Vanity
;
yet such there are I can assure you,

Madam
, and couâd easily give a description
of âem, but that so foul
a Relation must needs be Nauseous
to a Person so Neat as your
Self
;
and wouâd be treating You as the

Country Squire
did his
Court Friend
,
who when he had shewâd him all
the Curiosities of his House and
Gardens, carried him into his Hogsties.

75
But there are more than enow
to justifie what I have said of
the Humour of
Diogenes
, who was
as vain and as proud in his
Tub
,
as
Plato
couâd be in the midst of
his fine
Persian Carpets
, and rich

Furniture
. Vanity is only an Ambition
of being taken notice of,
which shews it self variously according
to the humour of the Persons;
which was more extravagant in the

Anti-Beau
, than in the
Beau Philosopher
.
Vanity is the veriest
Proteus

in the World, it can Ape
Humility
,
and can make Men decry
themselves on purpose to be Flattered;
like some cunning
Preachers

that cry up
Mortification
and
Self-denial

perpetually, and are pamperâd
all the while by the Zeal and at
the Charges of their Followers,
who are affraid the good Man
shouâd starve himself. It is the
Blessing of Fools, and the Folly of
Ingenious Men. For it makes those
contentedly hugg themselves under
all the scorn of the World, and the
Indignities that are offerâd âem, and
these restless and dissatisfied with

76
its applause. Both think the World
envious, and that their merit is
injurâd, and it is impossible to
right either of âem to their Minds;
for those have no title to the pretence
of merit, and these not so
much as they think they have.
Yet it is the Happiness of the first
that they can think themselves capable
of moving
Envy
;

|
Vanity a Blessing to Fools.
|

for though
they commonly mistake the Derision
of Men, for their applause, yet
Men are sometimes so ill Naturâd
as to undeceive âem, and then it is
their Comfort, that these are envious
Men, and misrepresent the
Worlds opinion of âem. Couâd
these Men be convincâd of their
mistake, I see nothing that shouâd
hinder them from being desperate,
and hanging or disposing of themselves
some other such way. For
though a Man may comfort himself
under Afflictions, it is either that
they are undeserved, or if deserved,
that he suffers only for Oversights,
or rash Acts, by which the wisest
Men may be sometimes overtaken;
that he is in the main Discreet and

77
Prudent, and that others believe
him so. But when a Man falls under
his own
Contempt
, and does
not only think himself not wise,
but by
Nature
made absolutely incapable
of ever becoming
Wise
, he
is in a deplorable
State
, and wants
the common
Comfort
, as well of

Fools
, as
Wise Men
, Vanity; which
in such a Case is the only proper

Mediatour
of a
Reconcilement
. No
Quality seems to be more Providentially
distributed to every Man
according to his Necessity; for
those that have least Wit, ought to
have the greatest Opinion of it;
as all other Commodities are rated
highest, where they are scarcest.
By this means the level is better
maintainâd amongst Men, who,
were this imaginary Equality destroyâd,
might be apt to reverence,
and idolize one another too much,
and forgetting the common Fate,
they are all Born to, pay Honours
too near divine to their Fellow
Mortals. But as the humour of
the World now runs, this sort of

Idolatry
is scarce likely to come into

78
Fashion. We have too great
an Opinion of our selves, to believe
too well of any one else, and
we are in nothing more difficult
than in points of Wit and Understanding,
in either of which we very
unwillingly yield the Preference
to any Man. There is nothing of
which we affect to speak with more
humility and indifference than our
own Sense, yet nothing of which
we think with more Partiality, and
Presumption. There have been
some so bold as to assume the Title
of the
Oracles
of
Reason
to themselves,
and their own Writings; and
we meet with others daily, that
think themselves
Oracles
of
Wit
.
These are the most Vexatious Animals
in the World, that think
they have a Priviledge to torment
and plague every Body; but those
most who have the best Reputation
for their Wit of Judgment; as

Fleas
are said to molest those most,
who have the tenderest
Skins
, and
the sweetest
Blood
.

Of these the most voluminous Fool
is the Fop Poet, who is one that

79
has always more Wit in his Pockets
than any where else,

|
Character of a Poetaster.
|

yet seldom or
never any of his own there.
Esop
âs

Daw
was a
Type
of him; For he
makes himself fine with the Plunder
of all Parties. He is a Smuggler
of Wit, and steals
French
Fancies
without paying the customary
Duties. Verse is his
Manufacture
;
For it is more the labour of his
Finger than his brain. He spends
much time in Writing, but ten
times more in Reading what he has
Written. He is loaden constantly
with more Papers, and duller than
a
Clerk
in
Chancery
, and spends
more time in
Hearings
, and
Rehearings
.
He asks your Opinion,
yet for fear you shouâd not jump
with him, tells you his own first.
He desires no Favour, yet is disappointed,
if he be not Flatterâd, and
is offended always at the Truth.
His first Education is generally a

Shop
, or a
Counting-House
, where his
acquaintance commences with the

Bell-man
upon a new Years day.
He puts him upon Intriguing with
the
Muses
, and promises to
Pimp

80
for him. From this time forward
he hates the name of
Mechanick
,
and resolves to sell all his stock, and
purchase a Plantation in
Parnassas
.
He is now a Poetical
Haberdasher

of
Small Wares
, and deals very
much in
Novels
,
Madrigals
,
Riddles
,

Funeral
, and
Love Odes
, and

Elegies
, and other Toyes from
Helicon
,
which he has a Shop so well
furnishâd with, that he can fit you
with all sorts and Sizes upon all
Occasions in the twinkling of an
Eye. He frequents
Apollo
âs
Exchange

in
Covent-Garden
, and picks
up the freshest Intelligence what

Plays
are upon the Stocks, or ready
to be launchâd; who have lately
made a good Voyage, who a saving
one only, and who have sufferâd a
Wreck in
Lincoln
âs-
Inn-Feilds
, or

Drury-Lane
, and which are brought
into the Dock to be Careenâd and
fitted for another Voyage. He
talks much of
Jack Dryden
, and
Will.
Wyckerley
, and the rest of that Set,
and protests he canât help having
some respect for âem, because they
have so much for him, and his

81
Writings; otherwise he couâd shew
âem to be meer Sots and Blockheads
that understand little of Poetry, in
comparison of himself; but he forbears
âem meerly out of Gratitude,
and Compassion. Once a Month
he fits out a small
Poetical Smeck

at the charge of his Bookseller,
which he lades with
French Plunder

new Vampt in
English
, small Ventures
of
Translated Odes
,
Elegies

and
Epigrams
of Young Traders,
and ballasts with heavy
Prose
of his
own; for which returns are to be
made to the several Owners in Testers,
or applause from the Prentices
and Tyre Women that deal for
âem. He is the Oracle of those that
want Wit, and the Plague of those
that have it; for he haunts their
Lodgings, and is more terrible to
âem
, than their Duns. His Pocket
is an unexhaustible Magazine of

Rhime
, and
Nonsense
, and his
Tongue like a repeating Clock with
Chimes, is ready upon every touch
to sound to âem. Men avoid him
for the same Reason, they avoid
the
Pillory
, the security of their

82
Ears
; of which he is as merciless a
Persecutor. He is the Bane of Society,
a Friend to the Stationers,
the Plague of the Press, and the
Ruine of his Bookseller. He is
more profitable to the
Grocers
and

Tabacconists
than the
Paper Manufacture
;
for his Works, which talk
so much of Fire and Flame, commonly
expire in their Shops in
Vapour

and
Smoak
. If he aspire to

Comedy
, he intrigues with some experiencâd

Damsel
of the
Town
, in order
to instruct himself in the humour
of it, and is cullied by her
into
Matrimony
, and so is furnishâd
at once with a Plot, and two good
Characters, himself and his Wife,
and is paid with a Portion for a
Jointure in
Parnassus
, which I leave
him to make his best of.

Vanity Universal.

I shall not trouble you with any
more Instances of the foolish vanities
of Mankind; because I am affraid
I have been too large upon
that Head already. Not that I
think there is any Order or Degree
of Men, which wouâd not afford

83
many and notorious instances for
our Purpose. For as I think
Vanity

almost the Universal mover of all
our Actions, whether good or bad;
so I think there are scarce any Men
so Ingenious, or so Vertuous, but
something of it will shine through the
greatest Part of what they do, let
them cast never so thick a Vail over
it. What makes Men so solicitous
of leaving a Reputation behind
âem in the World, though
they know they canât be affected
with it after Death, but this even
to a degree of Folly? What else
makes great Men involve themselves
in the Fatigues and Hazards of
War, and intricate Intrigues of
State, when they have already
more than they can enjoy, but an
Itch of being talkâd of and remembred,
to which they sacrifice their
present happiness and repose?

But I shall carry these Considerations
no farther; because I have
already singled out some of those
many whose
Vanity
is more extravagant
and ridiculous, than any our

84
Sex is chargeable with, these
slight Touches may serve to let âem
see, that even the greatest, and
Wisest are not wholely exempt, if
they have it not in a higher Degree,
thoâ they exercise it in things
more Popular, and Plausible. I
hope therefore the burthen of this
good Quality will not hereafter be
laid upon us alone, but the Men
will be contented to divide the Load
with us, and be thankful that they
bear less than their Proportion.

Impertinence.

Impertinence
comes next under
Consideration, in which I shall be as
brief, as I conveniently can, in
regard I have been so long upon
the precedeing Head.
Impertinence

is a humour of busying our selves
about things trivial, and of no
Moment in themselves, or unseasonably
in things of no concern to
us, or wherein we are able to do
nothing to any Purpose. Here our
Adversaries insult over us, as if
they had gainâd an intire
Victory
,
and the
Field
were indisputable;
but they shall have no cause for

85
Triumph
, this is no Post of such
mighty advantage as they fondly
persuade themselves. This
Presumption

arises from an Erroneous Conceit,
that all those things in which
they are little concernâd, or consulted,

|
Commonly mistaken.
|

are triffles below their care
or notice, which indeed they are
not by Nature so well able to manage.
Thus, when they hear us
talking to, and advising one another
about the Order, Distribution and
Contrivance of
Houshold Affairs
,
about the
Regulation
of the
Family
,
and
Government
of
Children
and
Servants
,
the provident management of
a
Kitchin
, and the decent ordering
of a
Table
, the suitable
Matching
,
and convenient disposition of
Furniture

and the like, they presently
condemn us for impertinence. Yet
they may be pleased to consider,
that as the affairs of the World are
now divided betwixt us, the
Domestick

are our share, and out of which
we are rarely sufferâd to interpose
our Sense. They may be pleased
to consider likewise, that as light
and inconsiderable as these things

86
seem, they are capable of no Pleasures
of Sense higher or more refinâd
than those of
Brutes
without
our care of âem. For were it not
for that, their Houses wouâd be
meer
Bedlams
, their most luxurious
Treats, but a rude confusion of ill
Digested, ill mixt Scents and Relishes,
and the fine Furniture, they
bestow so much cost on, but an expensive
heap of glittering
Rubbish
.
Thus they are beholding to us for
the comfortable Enjoyment of what
their labour or good Fortune hath
acquirâd or bestowâd, and think
meanly of our care only, because
they understand not the value of it.
But if we shall be thought impertinent
for Discourses of this Nature,
as I deny not but we sometimes
justly may, when they are unseasonable;
what censure must those
Men bear, who are prepetually
talking of
Politicks
,
State Affairs

and
Grievances
to us, in which perhaps
neither they, nor We are much
concernâd, or if we be, are not able
to propose, much less to apply any
Remedy to âem? Surely these are

87
impertinent; not to call the
Beau
,
or
Poetaster
on the
Stage
again,
whose whole Lives are one continued
scene of Folly and Impertinence;
let us make the best of our

News Monger
.

Character of a Coffee-House Politician.

He is one whose Brains having
been once over-heated, retain something
of the Fire in âem ever after.
He mistakes his Passion for Zeal,
and his Noise and Bustling, for
Services. He is always full of
Doubts, Fears, and Jealousies, and
is never without some notable Discovery
of a deep laid Design, or a
dangerous Plot found out in a
Meal
Tub
, or
Petticoat
. He is a mighty
Listner after
Prodigies
, and never
hears of a
Whale
, or a
Comet
, but he
apprehends some sudden
Revolution

in the State, and looks upon a

Groaning-board
, or a
speaking-head
,
as fore-runners of the
Day
of
Judgment
.
He is a great Lover of the
King, but a bitter Enemy to all about
him, and thinks it impossible
for him to have any but
Evil Counsellors
,
and though he be very zealous

88
for the Government, yet he
never finds any thing in it but
Grievances

and
Miscarriages
to declaim
upon. He is a Well-wisher to the

Church
, but he is never to be reconcilâd
to the
Bishops
and
Clergy
, and
rails most inveterately at the
Act
of

Uniformity
. He hates
Persecution

implacably, and contends furiously
for
Moderation
, and can scarce think
well of the
Toleration
, because it is
an Act of the State. He professes
himself of the
Church
of
England
,
pretends to like the Worship of it,
but he goes to Meetings in spight
to the
Parson
of his
Parish
. His
Conscience

is very tender and scrupulous
in Matters of Ceremony, but
it is as steely and tough as Brawn
behind his Counter, and can digest
any Sin of Gain. He lodges
at home, but he lives at the
Coffee-house
.
He converses more with

News Papers
,
Gazettes
and
Votes
,
than with his
Shop Books
, and his
constant Application to the
Publick

takes him off all Care for his
Private
Concern
. He is always settling the

Nation
, yet couâd never manage his

89
own
Family
. He is a mighty Stickler
at all
Elections
, and thoâ he has
no
Vote
, thinks it impossible any
thing shouâd go right unless he be
there to Bawl for it. His business is at

Home
, but his thoughts are in
Flanders
,
and he is earnestly investing
of Towns till the
Sheriffâs Officers
beleaguer
his Doors. He is busie in
forcing of
Counterscarps
, and storming
of
Breaches
, while his
Creditors

take his
Shop
by surprize, and make
Plunder of his
Goods
. Thus by
mending the
State
, He marrs his
own
Fortune
; and never leaves
talking of the
Laws
of the
Land
, till
the Execution of âem silence him.

This sort of Impertinents the

Coffee-houses
are every day full of;
nay, so far has this contagious Impertinence
spread it self, that
Private
Houses
, and
Shops
, nay, the
very
Streets
and
Bulks
are infected
and pesterâd with Politicks and
News. Not a Pot couâd go glibly
down, or a flitch go merrily forward
without
Namur
, a while ago;
âtwas
Spice
to the
Porterâs Ale
, and

90
Wax
to the
Coblerâs Thread
; the
one suspended his Draught, and
the other his Awl to enquire what
was become of the
Rogue
, and were
very glad to hear he was taken,
and expected no doubt he shouâd
come over and make âem a
Holy-day

at his Execution. They were mightily
rejoycâd at the Arresting of the
Mareschal
Boufflers
, and made no
question but they shouâd see him
amongst the rest of the
Beasts
at

Bartholomew Fair
for Two Pence.
This Folly of the
Mob
was in some
measure excusable, because their Ignorance
led âem into an expectation
of seeing what had given the World
so much Trouble. But those that
have better knowledge of things
have no such
Plea
, they ought to
have been wiser, than to have busied
themselves so much and so
earnestly about affairs, which all
their care and Sollicitude could have
no more influence upon, than over
the Weather. âTwas pleasant to see
what Shoals the report of the arrival
of a
Holland
, or
Flanders Mail
,
brought to the
Secretaryâs Office
, the

91
Post Office
, and the
Coffee-Houses
;
every one Crowding to catch the
News first, which as soon as they
had, they posted away like so
many Expresses to disperse it among
their Neighbours at more distance,
that waited with Ears prickt up to
receive âem, or walkâd uneasily
with a Foolish Impatience to and
from the Door, or Window, as if
their looking out so often wouâd
fetch âem the sooner. Most Men in
their News are like
Beau
âs in their
Diet, the worst is welcome while
âtis fresh and scarce, and the best is
not worth a Farthing when it has
been blown upon; and commonly
they fare like
Beau
âs, are fond of it
while âtis young and insipid, and
neglect it when âtis grown up to its
full, and true relish. No sooner is it
rumourâd that a Breach is made in the

Castle Wall
, or the
White Flag
hung
out, but a
Council of War
is callâd
in every
Coffee-house
in Town; the

French
, and
Dutch Prints
, their Intelligencers
are callâd for immediately,
and examinâd, and not a Shot is
mentionâd but they start as if the

92
Ball whizzâd just then by their Ears.
After this follows a serious debate
about a general Assault, and whether
they shall storm immediately, or
not; who shall begin the Attack;
what Conditions shall be granted
on Capitulation. The Castle of

Namur
thus taken, or Surrenderâd,
they proceed to take their Measures,
and settle the next Campaign, and
whatever harm we suffer by those
mischeivous
French
in the Field,
they are sure to take sufficient Revenge,
and pay âem off Swingingly
in the
Coffee-houses
: But as if this
were not enough, Our greatest
Actions must be Buffoonâd in Show,
as well as Talk. Shall
Namur
be taken
and our Heroâs of the City not
show their Prowess upon so great an
Occasion?

|
City Militia.

It must never be said,
that the
Coffee-houses
darâd more than

Moor-Fields
; No, for the honour of

London
, out comes the Foreman of
the
Shop
very Formidable in
Buff

and
Bandileers
, and away he marches
with Feather in Cap, to the general
Rendezvous in the
Artillery Ground
.
There these terrible Mimicks of

93
Mars
are to spend their Fury in

Noise
and
Smoke
, upon a
Namur

erected for that purpose on a
Molehill
,
and by the help of
Guns
and

Drums
out-stink and out-rattle

Smith-field
in all its Bravery, and
wouâd be too hard for the greatest
Man in all
France
, if they had him
but amongst âem. Yet this is but
Skirmishing, the hot Service is in
another Place, when they engage
the
Capons
and
Quart Pots
; never
was Onset more Vigorous, For
they come to Handy-Blows immediately,
and now is the real cutting
and slashing, and Tilting without
Quarter, Were the Towns in

Flanders
all wallâd with
Beef
, and
the
French
as good meat as
Capons
,
and drest the same way, the King
need never beat his Drums for Soldiers;
all these Gallant Fellows
wouâd come in Voluntarily, the
meanest of which wouâd be able to
eat a Mareschal, and whom nothing
couâd oppose in conjunction.

Nothing is more common, and
familiar than this sort of Impertinence;

94
Most Men wouâd have little
to do, did they busie themselves
about nothing, but what they understood,
or were concernâd in. A
Monkey is not liker a Man in his
Figure, than in his humour. How
ready are all Mankind to censure
without Authority, and to give
advice unaskt, and without reason.
They are very much mistaken, that
think this forwardness to thrust
themselves into otherâs affairs, springs
from any Principle of Charity or
Tenderness for âem, or the least Regard
to the Welfare of their Neighbours.
âTis only a Vain Conceit
that they are wiser, and more able
to advise, which puts âem upon engaging
in things they have nothing
to do with,

|
Officious Impertinences.
|

and passing their Judgments
Magisterially on matters they
have no Cognizance of, and generally
little Information, or Skill in.
They are desirous the World shouâd
have as great an Opinion of âem
as they have of themselves, and
therefore impertinently interpose
their own Authority and Sense, thoâ
never so little to the purpose, only

95
to shew how well they couâd manage,
were it their Business; thus they
advise without good intention, or
kindness, and censure without design,
or malice to the Persons counsellâd,
or reflected on, These buzzing
Insects swarm as thick every
where, and are as troublesome as

Muskettoes
in the
West-Indies
.
They are perpetually in a hurry of
Business, yet are forcâd to rack their
Inventions to employ their Leisure.
They are very busie for every Body,
and serve no Body. They are always
in hast, and think themselves
expected every where with Impatience,
yet come sooner alwayes than
they are welcome. They will walk
a Mile, and spend an hour to tell
any one how urgent their Business
is, and what hast they are in to be
gone. Their Expedition is their
greatest Loss, For Time is the only
thing that lies heavy upon their
hands. They are walking
Gazetts
,
that carry News from one Neighbour
to another, and have their
Stages about the Town as regular
and certain, as a
Penny Postman
.

96
Every Man is their acquaintance, but
no Man their Friend. They drudge
for every Body, and are paid by
no
Body, and thoâ their Lives be
worn out in endeavours to oblige
all Mankind, when they die no one
regrets their Loss, or misses their
Service.

There are another sort of Impertinents,

|
Character of a Vertuoso.
|

who, as they mind not
the Business of other Men where it
concerns âem not, neglect it likewise
where it does; and amuse
themselves continually with the
Contemplation of those things,
which the rest of the World slight
as useless, and below their regard.
Of these the most Egregious is the

Virtuoso
, who is one that has sold
an Estate in Land to purchase one in

Scallop
,
Conch
,
Muscle
,
Cockle Shells
,

Periwinkles
,
Sea Shrubs
,
Weeds
,

Mosses
,
Sponges
,
Coralls
,
Corallines
,

Sea Fans
,
Pebbles
,
Marchasites
and

Flint stones
; and has abandonâd the
Acquaintance and Society of Men
for that of
Insects
,
Worms
,
Grubbs
,

Maggots
,
Flies
,
Moths
,
Locusts
,
Beetles
,

97
Spiders
,
Grashoppers
,
Snails
,

Lizards
and
Tortoises
. His study is
like
Noah
âs Ark, the general Rendezvous
of all Creatures in the
Universe
,
and the greatest part of his
Moveables are the remainders of
his Deluge. His Travels are not
designâd as Visits to the Inhabitants
of any Place, but to the Pits, Shores
and Hills; from whence he fetches
not the Treasure, but the Trumpery.
He is ravishâd at finding an
uncommon shell, or an odd shapâd
Stone, and is desperately enamourâd
at first sight of an unusual markt
Butter-flie, which he will hunt a
whole day to be Master of. He
trafficks to all places, and has his
Correspondents in eâry part of the
World; yet his Merchandizes
serve not to promote our Luxury,
nor encrease our Trade, and neither
enrich the Nation, nor himself.
A Box or two of
Pebbles
or

Shells
, and a dozen of
Wasps
,
Spiders

and
Caterpillars
are his Cargoe,
He values a
Camelion
or
Salamanders

Egg, above all the Sugars and
Spices of the
West
and
East-indies
,

98
and wouâd give more for the Shell
of a
Star-fish
, or
Sea Urchin
entire,
than for a whole
Dutch
Herring
Fleet. He visites Mines, Colepits,
and Quarries frequently, but not
for that sordid end that other Men
usually do,
viz.
gain; but for the
sake of the fossile Shells and Teeth
that are sometimes found there.
He is a smatterer at
Botany
, but for
fear of being suspected of any useful
design by it, he employs his
curiosity only about
Mosses
,
Grasses
,

Brakes
,
Thistles
,  &c. that are not
accusâd of any vertue in Medicine,
which he distinguishes and divides
very nicely. He preserves carefully
those
Creatures
, which other Men
industriously destroy, and cultivates
sedulously those Plants, which others
root up as Weeds. He is the
Embalmer of deceasâd Vermin, and
dresses his Mummyes with as much
care, as the Ancient
Egyptians
did
their Kings. His Cash consists
much in old Coins, and he thinks
the Face of
Alexander
in one of âem
worth more than all his Conquests.
His Inventory is a list of the Insects

99
of all Countries, and the Shells
and Pebbles of all Shores, which can
no more be compleat without two
or three of remarkable
Signatures
,
than an
Apothecaries
Shop without
a
Tortoise
and a
Crocodile
, or a Country

Barber
âs without a batterâd

Cittern
. A piece of Ore with a
Shell in it is a greater Present than
if it were fine Gold, and a string of

Wampompeag
is receivâd with more
joy, than a
Rope
of
Orient Pearl
, or

Diamonds
wouâd be. His Collection
of
Garden Snails
,
Cockle Shells

and
Vermine
compleated, (as he
thinks) he sets up for a
Philosopher
,
and nothing less than Universal
Nature will serve for a Subject,
of which he thinks he has an entire
History in his
Lumber Office
.
Hence forward he
struts
and
swells
,
and despises all those little insignificant
Fellows, that can make no
better use of those noble incontestable
Evidences of the Universal
Deluge,
Scallop
and
Oyster Shells
,
than to stew
Oysters
, or melt
Brimstone

for
Matches
. By this time he
thinks it necessary to give the

100
World an
Essay
of his Parts, that it
may think as highly of âem (if possible)
as he does himself; and finding

Moses
hard beset of late, he resolves
to give him a lift, and defend
his Flood, to which he is so
much obligâd for sparing his darling
Toys only. But as great Masters
use, he corrects him sometimes
for not speaking to his Mind, and
gives him the lie now and then in
order to support his Authority. He
shakes the World to Atoms with
ease, which melts before him as
readily as if it were nothing but a
Ball of Salt. He pumps even the
Center, and drains it of imaginary
stores by imaginary Loopholes, as
if punching the Globe full of holes
couâd make his
Hypothesis
hold
Water. He is a Man of
Expedition
,
and does that in a few days,
which cost
Moses
some Months to
compleat. He is a Passionate Admirer
of his own Works without a
Rival, and superciliously contemns
all
Answers
, yet the least
Objection

throws him into the Vapours. He
sets up for a grand
Philosopher
, and

101
palms
Hypotheses
upon the World,
which future Ages may (if they
please) expect to hear his Arguments
for; at present he is in no
humour to give âem any other satisfaction
than his own word, that
he is infallible. Yet those that have
a Faith complacent enough to take
a Gentlemanâs word for his own
great Abilities, may perhaps be admitted
to a sight of his grand Demonstration,
his
Raree Show
; the
particulars of which he repeats to
âem in a whining
Tone
, eâry whit as
formal and merry, though not so
Musical, as the Fellows that used
formerly to carry
theirs at their
Backs
. His ordinary discourse is
of his
Travels under Ground
, in
which he has gone farther (if he
may be believâd) than a whole
Warren of
Conies
. Here he began
his Collection of Furniture for his
Philosophical
Toy Shop
, which he
will conclude with his Fortune,
and then like all Flesh revert to the
place from whence he came, and be
translated only from one Shop to
another.

102
This,
Madam
, is another sort of
Impertience our Sex are not liable
to; one wouâd think that none but

Mad Men
, or highly
Hypochondriacal
,
couâd employ themselves at this
rate. I appeal to you, or indeed
to any Man of Sense, whether acts
like the wiser Animal; the man that
with great care, and pains distinguishes
and divides the many Varieties
of Grass, and finds no other
Fruit of his labour, than the charging
of his Memory with abundance of
superfluous Names; or the Ass that
eats all promiscuously, and without
distinction, to satisfy his
Appetite
and
support
Nature
. To what purpose
is it, that these Gentlemen ransack
all Parts both of
Earth
and
Sea
to
procure these
Triffles
? It is only
that they may give their Names to
some yet unchristenâd Shell or Insect.
I know that the desire of knowledge,
and the discovery of things yet unknown
is the Pretence; But what
Knowledge is it? What Discoveries
do we owe to their Labours? It is
only the Discovery of some few unheeded
Varieties of Plants, Shells,

103
or Insects, unheeded only because
useless; and the Knowledge, they
boast so much of, is no more than
a Register of their Names, and
Marks of Distinction only. It is
enough for them to know that a

Silk Worm
is a sort of
Caterpiller
,
that when it is come to maturity
Weaves a
Web
, is metamorphosâd
to a
Moth-Flye
, lays Eggs, and so
Dies. They leave all further enquiry
to the Unlearned and Mechanicks,
whose business only
they think it to prosecute matters
of Gain and Profit. Let him contrive,
if he can, to make this
Silk

serviceable to
Mankind
; their
Speculations

have another
Scope
, which
is the founding some wild, uncertain,
conjectural
Hypothesis
, which
may be true or false; yet Mankind
neither Gainers nor Losers either
way a little in point of
Wisdom
or
Convenience. These Men are just
the reverse of a
Rattle Snake
, and
carry in their
Heads
, what he does
in his
Tail
, and move Laughter rather
than Regard. What improvements
of
Physick
, or any useful Arts,

104
what noble Remedies, what serviceable
Instruments have these

Mushrome
, and
Cockle shell
Hunters
obligâd the World with? For I am
ready to recant if they can shew so
good a Medâcine as Stewâd
Prunes
,
or so necessary an Instrument as a

Flye Flap
of their own Invention and
Discovery. Yet these are the Men
of exalted Understandings, the Men
of elevated Capacities, and sublime
Speculations, that Dignifie and Distinguish
themselves from the rest of
the World by Specious Names, and
Pompous Titles, and continue notwithstanding
as very
Reptiles
in
Sense, as those they converse so
much with.

I wouâd not have any Body mistake
me so far, as to think I wouâd
in the least reflect upon any sincere,
and intelligent Enquirer into Nature,
of which I as heartily with a better
knowledge, as any
Vertuoso
of âem
all. You can be my Witness,
Madam
,
that I usâd to say, I thought Mr.

Boyle
more honourable for his learned
Labours, than for his Noble

105
Birth; and that the
Royal Society
,
by their great and celebrated Performances,
were an Illustrious Argument
of the Wisdom of the
August

Prince, their Founder of happy
Memory
;
and that they highly merited
the
Esteem
,
Respect
and
Honour

paid âem by the Lovers of Learning
all
Europe
over. But thoâ I have
a very great Veneration for the

Society
in general, I canât but put a
vast difference between the particular
Members that compose it. Were

Supererogation
a Doctrine in Fashion,
âtis probable some of âem
might borrow of their Fellows
merit enough to justifie their Arrogance,
but alas they are come an
Age too late for that trick; They
are fallen into a Faithless, Incredulous
Generation of Men that will
give credit no farther than the
visible Stock will extend: And thoâ
a Vertuoso should swell a Title-Page
even till it burst with large
Promises, and sonorous Titles, the
World is so ill naturâd as not to think
a whit the better of a Book for it.
âTis an ill time to trade with implicite

106
Faith, when so many have
so lately been broken by an overstock
of that
Commodity
; no sooner
now a days can a Man write, or
steal an Hypothesis, and promise
Demonstration for it hereafter in
this or the next World; but out
comes some malicious Answer or
other, with Reasons in hand against
it, overthrows the credit of it, and
puts the poor Author into Fits.
For though a great Philosopher that
has written a Book of three Shillings
may reasonably insult, and despise
a six penny Answer, yet the Indignity
of so low pricâd a Refutation
wouâd make a
Stoick
fret, and
Frisk

like a Cow with a Breeze in her
Tail, or a Man bitten by a
Tarantula
.
Men measure themselves by
their
Vanity
, and are greater or less
in their own Opinions, according to
the proportion they have of it; if
they be well stockâd with it, it may
be easie to confute, but impossible
to convince âem. He therefore that
wouâd set up for a great Man, ought
first to be plentifully provided of
it, and then a Score of
Cockle Shells
,

107
a dozen of
Hodmandods
, or any
Trifle else is a sufficient Foundation
to build a Reputation upon. But
if a Man shall abdicate his lawful
Calling in pure affection to these
things, and has for some years spent
all the Time and Money he was
Master of in prosecution of this
Passion, and shall after all hear his

Caterpillars
affronted, and his
Butter-flies

irreverently spoken of, it
must be more provoking to him,
than âtis to a
Lion
to be pullâd
by the
Beard
. And if, when to
crown all his Labours, he has discoverâd
a Water so near a kin to
the famous one, that couâd be kept
in nothing but the hoof of an Ass,
that it was never found but in the

Scull
of the same
Animal
; a Water
that makes no more of melting a

World
, than a
Dutchman
does of a

Ferkin
of
Butter
; and when he has
written a Book of Discoveries, and
Wonders thereupon, if (I say) the
Impertinent Scriblers of the Age,
will still be demanding
Proofs
and
writing
Answers
, he has reason to
throw down his
Pen
in a rage, and

108
pronounce the world, that couâd
give him such an interruption, unworthy
to be blest with his future
labours, and breath eternal Defiance
to it, as irreconcilable, as the quarrel
of the Sons of
Oedipus
. To
which prudent Resolution, let us
leave him till he can recover his
Temper.

These Instances,
Madam
, will
(I hope) suffice to shew that Men
are themselves altogether as impertinent,
as they maliciously misrepresent
us. It is not for want of
plenty of others that I content my
self with these; but I am not willing
to trouble you with any of an
inferiour Character. These are all
impertinents of
Mark
and
Note
, and
have severally the good fortune to
find crowds of
Fools
of their own
Sex to applaud and admire them.

Impertinence
is a failing, that has
its
Root
in
Nature
; but is not worth
Laughing at, till it has receivâd the
finishing strokes of Art. A Man
through natural defects may do
abundance of incoherent, foolish

109
Actions, yet deserve
Compassion

and
Advice
rather than
Derision
.
But to see Men spending their Fortunes,
as well as Lives, in a course
of
Regular Folly
, and with an industrious,
as well as expensive Idleness
running through tedious

Systems
of impertinence, wouâd have
split the sides of
Heraclitus
, had it
been his fortune to have been a
Spectator. âTis very easie to decide
which of these
Impertinents
is
the most signal; the
Vertuoso
is manifestly
without a Competitour. For
our Follies are not to be measurâd
by the degree of
Ignorance
, that appears
in âem, but by the Study,
Labour and Expence they cost us
to finish and compleat âem. So that
the more Regularity and Artifice
there appears in any of our Extravagancies,
the greater is the folly
of âem. Upon this Score it is, that
the last mentionâd deservedly claim
the preference to all others; they
have improvâd so well their Amusements
into an Art, that the
Credulous

and
Ignorant
are inducâd to believe
there is some secret Vertue,

110
some hidden Mystery in those darling
toys of theirs; when all their
Bustling amounts to no more than a
learned
Impertinence
, (for so they
abuse the Term) and all they teach
Men is, but a specious expensive
method of throwing away both
Time and Money.

I intend not in what remains to
trouble you with any more such instances;
because I am sensible these
have already swellâd this
Letter
to
a
Volumn
, which was not at first my
intent. I shall therefore dispatch
the remaining part of the charge in;
as few Words as possible.

|
Dissimulation became necessary.
|

Amongst
the rest
Dissimulation
is none of the
least
Blemishes
, which they endeavour
to fix upon us. This Quality,
though it canât upon any occasion
deserve the name of a

Vertue
, yet according to the
present Constitution of the World,
is many times absolutely necessary,
and is a main ingredient in the
Composition of Human Prudence.
It is indeed oftentimes criminal,
but it is only accidentally so, as Industry,

111
Wit, and most other good
Qualities may be, according, to the
Ends and Purposes to which they
are misemployâd. Dissimulation is
nothing but the hiding or disguising
our secret thoughts, or Inclinations
under another appearance. I shall
not endeavour to absolve our Sex
wholly from all use of this Quality, or
Art (call it which you please) because
I think it may upon many
occasions be used with Innocence
enough, and upon some canât without
great Imprudence be omitted.
The World is too full of
Craft
,
Malice
,
and
Violence
, for absolute
Simplicity

to live in it. It behoves
therefore our Sex as well as the other
to live with so much Caution,
and Circumspection in regard to their
own Security, that their Thoughts
and Inclinations may not be seen
so naked, as to expose âem to the

Snares
, designs, and practices of

Crafty Knaves
, who wouâd make a
property of âem; or lay âem open to
the wicked
Efforts
, and mischievous
Impressions of
Envy
, or
Malice
,
whose pleasure springs from the hurt

112
of others. Nothing gives our Adversaries
so great an advantage over
us, as the knowledge of our Opinions,
and Affections, with something
agreable to which they will
be sure to bate all their Traps and
Devices. For this reason it is that
it has been Proverbially said of
Old, that,
He that knows not how to
dissemble, knows not how to live
.
The Experience of all Ages since
has confirmâd this Observation,
and ours no less than any of the
Preceding. This premisâd, I suppose
no Wise Man will blame our
Sex for the use of an Art so necessary,
to preserve âem from becoming a

Prey
to every designing Man, an
Art of which himself must make
great use to deserve that Title. Yet
I am afraid, that upon enquiry our
Sex will not be found to have so
much of it as is requisite, at least
not generally; Our sedentary Life,
and the narrow Limits to which our
Acquaintance, and Business are
Circumscribâd, afford us so little Variety,
so regular a Face of things,
that we want the means of obtaining

113
the Mastery of so useful an Art,
which no question but we shouâd as
soon acquire as Men, had we but
equal Opportunities. Hence it is
that
Women
are more apt to show
their
Resentments
upon all
Provocations

than
Men
; and are thought naturally
more
Peevish
and
Captious
,
by those that apprehend not the true
reason; Whereas
Men
are altogether
as
Stomachful
, and take
Offence
as
soon, but they cover and suppress
their Indignation better, not with
a design to forget any Injury receivâd,
but to wreak their
Revenge

more covertly and effectually. This
is another advantage Men derive
from liberty of Conversation and
promiscuous Business, wherein the
Variety of Contingencies they have
to provide against, and the Diversity
of Tempers they deal with,
force âem to turn and wind themselves
into all
Shapes
, and accommodate
themselves to all Humours.
There is indeed yet a higher sort of

Dissimulation
,

|
Dissimulation when criminal.
|

which is always Criminal,
that is when Men not only
cloud their real
Sentiments
and Intentions,

114
but make Profession of
and seem zealously to affect the contrary;
this by a more proper and
restrainâd Name is callâd
Deceipt
,
and is always usâd in an ill Sense.
This Art is most practicâd in Courts
where
Policie
, and
Ambition
reign;
there You may see
Enemies
hugging
and caressing one another with all
outward
Expressions
of
Tenderness

and
Friendship
imaginabe, while
they are secretly contriving each
others ruine. There you may see
Men cringing to those, they wouâd

Spurn
if they durst, and
Flattering

those they despise and rail at behind;
their
Backs
, The Court is a place
where we come very rarely otherwise
than as
Spectators
, not as
Actours
;
as
Ornaments
, not as
Instruments
;
and therefore are seldom
involvâd in the guilty Practices of
it. Nor is it the Court only, but
all Places are infected with this Vice,
where there is any Encouragement
of Profit or Pleasure to be hopâd
from successful Treachery, of which
no Place is so barren as not to afford
some. This Deceipt is so far from

115
being the Vice of our Sex, that they
are the common Object on which it
is daily practicâd: Nothing is more
frequently met with than false Love
in Men,

|
False Love commonly practicâd.
|

which is now grown so
familiar, that a Company of Six of
both Sexes can scarce meet, but a

Sham Passion
commences immediately,
is urgâd, protested, and sworn
to be real with all imaginable Violence.
If these false Arts, mock
sighing, and Dying prevail upon
any foolish, easie, credulous
Woman
,
the
Sham Lover
is blown up with
the Success, he is big and in Labour
till he be deliverâd of the Secret,
which with great satisfaction he
proclaims in all Places where he
comes: âtis his highest Exploit of

Gallantry
, which he will by no
means lose the credit of. Thus he
thinks her ruine a step to Reputation,
and founds his own Honour
upon her Infamy. This
Madam
is
the basest of Treachery; for they
are not satisfied with the Success
of their false Promises, and
Oaths, but they insult over the weakness
of a too fond
Woman
, and
Triumph

116
in her Dishonour. I am sorry
there are any
Women
so foolish and
forward, as to give hopes and encouragement
to such ungenerous
Fellows; yet we may be assurâd
that they are not a quarter so many
as those vain
Boasters
wouâd make
âem. Much more be said on this
head, but that I think it high time
to pass on to the next, which is

Enviousness
, so foul a Blot to a fair
Character, that no Merit can wash
it out, or atone sufficiently for
it.

Envy
is the Parent of
Calumny
,
and the Daughter of
Jealousie
. Men
seldom envy others,

|
Enviousness
|

till they fear
being out stripâd by âem in Fortune
or Reputation. It is the most
criminal, because the most injurious
to Vertue, and worth of all our
natural Failings, against which itâs
Malice is generally bent. This
vice and
Jealousie
seem to be more
particularly hated of
Providence
than
any other; For they carry their
Punishment inseparably along with
âem, The Envious and the Jealous

117
need no other Tormentours than
their own Thoughts. The Envious
Man ruines his own to disturb anothers
Tranquillity, and sacrifices
his own Happiness and Repose to a
perverse Desire of troubling his
Neighbours. He feeds like
Toads

upon the Venome of the Earth, and
sucks in Scandal greedily, that he
may at Pleasure disgorge it to the
greater annoyance of other Men.
His mind has the
Vapours
, a Sweet
Report of any one throws it into
Convulsions, and Agonies, and a
foul one is the Releif and Refreshment
of it. A wholesome Air free
from the Blasts of
Detraction
and

Slander
is as certainly pernicious to
him, as
Ireland
to
Frogs
and
Toads
.
This Vice is generally disclaimâd by
both Sexes, yet generally practicâd
by both. Men love as little to have
their Reputation as their Chimneys
over-topt by their Neighbours; For
they think by that means their names
become dark, as their Houses do smoaky
by the other: Yet throâ a lazy
Malignity had rather pull the otherâs
down to their Level, than build

118
their own up higher. This Humour
prevails indeed, yet not in equal
Measure in both Sexes. For as we
have confessedly less
Ambition
, so
have we apparently less of this Poison
which usually attends it, and
arises from a self Interested Principle,
which makes âem endeavour by
base sinister means to level that
Merit which they think stands in
their way to Preferment, and which
they despair of being able to surmount
by honourable attempts. For
what need any one use base Sleights
to stop the Man, whom by fair
Speed he thought he couâd overtake.
No sooner is any Man raisâd to any
Eminence in the World, but half
the Sex at least join in Confederacy
to raise a Battery of Scandal against
him, to bring him down again.

Honour
is the
Pillory
of great
Desert, whither a Man is no sooner
raisâd, but the vile Rascally inferiour
Croud gather immediately together,
to throw Dirt at him, and make
that which was intended as a Grace,
and Reward, but a more honourable
Punishment. Our Sex seldom arrive

119
to this Pitch of Envy, our
Ambition is more bounded, and our
Desires sooner satisfied. Hence it is
that we are less troublâd at the Prosperity
of others; for not giving our
selves the Liberty of aiming at things
far out of our Power, they are the
sooner compassâd, and we the sooner
at Ease. He, that thinks himself
Happy, is incapable of Envying
anotherâs Felicity, since he sees him
possessâd of nothing which either he
has not or despises not. Yet it must
be confessâd that the lesser Piques,
and Grudgings are daily to be met
with among us, but no less among
Men. What is it that spawns daily
such Fryes of
Satyrists
without Wit,
and
Criticks
without Judgment, but
this humour of carping, and nibbling
at the Reputation of others?
But they are generally abundantly
furnisht with Impudence, a good
Quality that commonly supplies
largely the want of all other.

Character of a City Critick

A
Critick
of this sort is one that
for want of
Wit
sets up for
Judgment
;
yet he has so much Ambition

120
to be thought a
Wit
, that he lets
his
Spleen
prevail against
Nature
, and
turns
Poet
. In this Capacity he
is as just to the World as in the other
Injurious. For as the
Critick

wrongâd evâry Body in his Censure,
and snarlâd, and grinâd at their
Writings, the
Poet
gives âem Opportunity
to do themselves Justice, to
return the Compliment and laugh at
or despise his. He wants nothing
but Wit to fit him for a
Satyrist
, yet
he has
Gall
and
Vanity
enough to dispence
with that Want, and write
without it. His works are
Libells

upon others, but
Satyrs
upon himself,
and while they
Bark
at Men of
Wit
,
call him Fool that writ âem. He
takes his Malice for a Muse, and
thinks himself inspirâd when he is
only
Possessâd
, and blown up with
a Flatus of
Envy
and
Vanity
. His
great helps to Poetry are
Crambo
, and

Arithmetick
, by which he aspires to
Chime, and Numbers, yet mistakes
frequently in the tale of his Fingers.
He has a very great
Antipathy
to
his own Species, and hates to see a
Fool any where but in his Glass.

121
For (as he says) they
Provoke
him

And offend his Eyes
:

|
7th. Satyre of Boileau Eng.
|

He
Follows âem
as a Dog persues his Prey, and barks
whenere
He
smells âem in his way
: He

knows, to say no more
that
Wit is scarce,
to gingle out a Rhime, or tag a Verse:
Or Cobble wretched Prose to numerous
Lines: There if he has a Genius there
it shines
. His Fund of
Criticism
is
a Set of Terms of Art pickt out of
the
French Criticks
, or their Translators;
and his
Poetical
stock is a
Common Place of certain
Forms
and

Manners
of Expression. He writes
better in
Verse
than
Prose
; For in
that there is
Rhime
, in this neither

Rhime
not
Reason
. He talks much of
the
Naivete
of his Thoughts, which
appears sufficiently in the Dullness of
âem; yet nothing but the
Phlegmatick
,
Spiritless
Air
is his own. He
rails at Mr.
Oldham
for want of
Breeding and good Manners without
a grain of either, and steals his
own Wit to bespatter him with,
but like an ill
Chymist
, he lets
the
Spirit
flie of in the drawing
over, and retains only the
Phlegm
.
He censures Mr.
Cowley
for too

122
much
Wit
, and corrects him with
none. The difference between Mr.

Cowley
and him is this; the one
has too much Wit, and too fine for
the Standard; the other not enough
to blanch his base Metal, or cover
the Brass of his Counterfeits. To
compleat himself in the Formalities
of
Parnassus
, he falls in love and
tells the World, it is obligâd to his

Passion
for his
Poetry
; but if his

Mistress
prove no more indulgent
than his
Muse
, his Amour is like to
conclude but unluckily. For if his
Love be no warmer than his Lines,
his
Corinna
may play with his
Flame without danger of Burning.
He pretends to have written only
his sincerest Thoughts; I donât
know how well his Mistress may take
that from the
Lover
, but I dare
swear the World did not expect it
from the Poet. He is happiest at
the Picture of a Rhiming Fool, for he
need only to look in his Glass, and
he may Copy a Country
Wit
from
the City Original. If this Rhiming
Humour lasts, thereâs a good
Sugar-Jobber

spoilâd for an ill
Poet
; yet for his
comfort, Time, Improvement, and two

123
or three Books more may raise him
to Rival
Eâ Sâ
and sing
London
âs
Triumphs, to the Envy of
Tom Jordan

of happy Memory.

You may wonder,
Madam
, why
I shouâd give you the trouble of this
Character, after I had given you
my word to trouble you with no
more of this Nature. I must confess,
I am sorry that so foolish an Occasion
couâd make me forget my self; but
a Book newly publishâd happening
just at this Juncture unluckily to fall
into my Hands, I couâd not without
Indignation see the Scurrility and
Insolence, with which Mr.
Oldham
,
and Mr.
Cowley
are treated; and
couâd not but resent a little the
Wrongs done to the Memory of
Men whom the rest of the World
with Justice admire; and couâd not
help taking Notice upon so fair an
Opportunity, that they are not,
thoâ dead, to be so rudely plaid
with, and made the May-Game of
eâry
Splenetick Boy
. There are
some yet living, whose Wit and
Performances deserve a more respectful
treatment, than they have met
with from him. But they are able

124
to revenge their own Quarrel, if
they think he deserves the honour
to be Scourgâd by âem. Nothing but
Envy and a Vain Conceit of himself
couâd move him to attack the Reputation
of Men, whose Verse will
alwayes command Admiration,
while his own raise nothing but
Scorn and Indignation. If his Bookseller
were but blest with half a dozen
such Authors, he wouâd in a
short time infallibly be
Stationer

general to all the
Grocers
and
Tobacconists

in the Town.

After this Digression,
Madam
, let
us return to our Subject. We stand
yet chargâd with
Levity
, and
Inconstancy
,
two Failings so nearly related
and so generally United, that
it his hard to treat of âem apart;

|
Levity.
|

we
will therefore consider âem briefly together.

Levity
is an unsteddy Humor
that makes men like and dislike, seek,
and reject frequently the same things
upon slender or no Reasons. This is
the Humour of the Infancy of both
Sexes, and proceeds from the strength
of their Appetites, and the weakness

125
of their Judgments. At these
tender Years every thing we see
moves our Curiosities, and because
we think little beyond our Appetites,
desire impatiently whatever
pleases. This wears of in Proportion
to the growth of our Judgments,
when we begin to consider
the Fatigue, Hazard, Disreputation,
and other Inconveniences that attend
unreasonable, or inordinate
Desires. Herein our Sex have a
manifest Advantage over the other;
For it is confessâd on all hands that
our Judgments ripen sooner than
theirs,

|
Less Levity among Women then Men.
|

whence of course it Follows,
that this Folly prevails not so long
upon us, as them. âTis yet true,
that even the most experiencâd and
wisest of Us have no small mixture
of it, which appears in the greatest
Part of our Actions. But it is certain
likewise, that Men have a
greater proportion of it than we.
From this it is that
Novelty
derives
all its Charms, and that Men
persue with so much Eagerness and
Impatience what they so soon slight
if obtainâd. I appeal to the Experience

126
of all mankind, if they do
not generally frame to themselves
much greater Ideaâs of any thing
they desire, and are unacquainted
with, than they find real, when they
become Familiar to âem; and if they
did not imagine greater Pleasures,
while they were in persuit, than
they met with after they were in
Possession of their Wishes. The
Imagery of
Fancy
is, like some Paintings,
ravishing, and surprizing at a
due distance, but approach âem near,
and all the Charms and Beauty vanish,
and they appear rough and
unpleasant. Hence it is that Men
grow uneasie, and their desires pall
so soon upon the full enjoyment of
their Wishes; they see then the
imperfections as well as Beauties of
what they covered, which glitterâd
so far of, and like the Moon appearâd
all Lustre and Smoothness,
but when arrivâd at, all dark and
uneven. These Fallacies Men are
more submitted to than we, by
those very Priviledges which give
âem in some things the advantage
over us. The variety of Business,

127
and Society they run through, the
large acquaintance they contract,
give âem encouragement to aspire
to, and hopes to obtain many difficult
things, which our Sex seldom
lift their Thoughts up to. I
know this aspiring Humour of theirs
is generally callâd
Ambition
, and I
allow the Term to be proper; but
their Ambition works upon their
Levity, which only can make them
Barter certain Ease, Peace and Security,
for uncertain Pomp and
Splendour; and forsake a Condition
they know to be good, for one
they know no more of, than that
it Shines, and that it Glitters,
and
so part with the true Jewel for
the false one. These are the seririous
and applauded Follies of
Mankind, and shew the Weakness
and Levity of those we call the
greatest, and wisest Men, that sacrifice
the Ease and Pleasure of
their lives to
Popular Breath
, and
sounding Titles, which is like bartring
a small Diamond for a large
Glass Bubble.

Inconstancy

128
Inconstancy
is so like
Levity
that
little more needs to be said of it,
only that it is commonly restrainâd
to the change of Affections in regard
to Persons, and so is cheifly concernâd
in Love and Freindship. It
is founded upon Levity, throâ which
we first make an injudicious Choice,
and are afterwards as unreasonably
disgusted with it. This
happens oftner in
Love
, than
Friendship
;
because the Impressions of
Love

are more suddenly receivâd, and the
Effects of it more violent, than those
of
Friendship
; and the Desires, which
are commonly kindled by one single
Perfection, such as
Beauty
or
Wit
,
not being suddenly answered, are
in Process of time extinguishâd, or
abated by observation of some disgustful
Imperfection or other in the
Person belovâd. This is indeed the
true Reason,

|
Love, why so soon cold.
|

why
Love
, which is
generally so hot at first, cools commonly
so suddenly; because being
generally the Issue of Fancy, not
judgment, it is grounded upon an
over great Opinion of those Perfections,
which first strike us, and

129
which fall in our Esteem upon more
mature Examination. From whence
it is likewise that Men are less constant
in their Affections, than we;
for Beauty only being generally the
Object of their Passion, the Effect
must necessarily be as fadeing as the
Cause; their Love therefore being
only the result of wonder and Surprize,
is abated by Familiarity, and
decays, as they wear of, by Degrees.
Beside, that, a Love so Founded is
liable to be ravishâd by any Superiour
Beauty; or if not so, yet the
Novelty of the Former once worn
of, the New Comer has the assistance
of Fancy the Slave of Novelty
to gain the Superiority. This is
the Cause why so few real and lasting
Passions are found amongst Men.
For Charms depending upon, and
owing their Power to Fancy, can
maintain no Conquests any longer,
than that is on their side, which is
as inconstant as the Wind.

|
Women constanter Lovers.
|

In this
also we are less faulty, than they;
For, not usually fixing our Affection
on so mutable a Thing as the

Beauty
of a
Face
, which a thousand

130
accidents may destroy, but on
Wit
,

Good Humour
, and other
Graces
of
the
Mind
, as well as of the
Body
,
our Love is more durable, and constant
in proportion to the longer
continuance of those Qualities in
the Object. Neither indeed have
we the means, or temptation to be
Fickle and inconstant so ready as
Men have; For Modesty, and the
Rules of Decency observâd among
Us, not permitting to us the Liberty
of declaring our sentiments to those
we love, as Men may, we dare
not indulge a wanton Fancy, or
rambling Inclination, which must
be stiffled in our own Breasts, and
couâd only give us a hopeless Anxiety,
unless we were able to inspire
the same Passion for us in them;
which it were vain to expect, without
breaking throâ all restraint of
Modesty

and
Decorum
at the price of our
Fame and Reputation, which I hope
few are so daring as to venture.
Besides this our Tempers are by
Nature calm, sedate, and tender,
not apt to be rufflâd, and disturbâd
by Passions, and too fearful to enterprize

131
any thing in satisfaction of
âem; theirs on the contrary, bold,
active, and uneven, easily susceptible
of all manner of Desires, and readily
executing any Designs to gratifie
âem. Thus are we debarred the
liberty of chusing for our selves,
and confinâd to please our selves out
of the number that like and address
to us, of which if we fix our Affections
upon any one, we are
generally fixt and unmoveable, as
having neither the Inclination to,
nor opportunity of Inconstancy, that
the Men have. I donât deny but
that there may be some among us
guilty of this Fault, but they are
vastly short of the Number of Men
involvâd in the like Guilt, amongst
whom it is now grown so fashionable,
that is become no Scandal; but is
daily justified, and the Treachery
boasted of as high Gallantry. The
Crimes therefore of some few
Women

ought, to be no reproach to the
Sex in general. Of Infidelity in
Friendship I shall say little, because
I think there are so few Instances of
any thing that deserve the Name,

132
that scarce any Age has been so
fruitful as to produce two Pair of real
and true Friends.

|
Freindship.
|

I know that the
Name is commonly given to such as
are linkt by any Ties of Consanguinity,
Affinity, Interest, mutual
Obligations, Acquaintance, and the
like: But these are such Friendships
(if they may be callâd so) as are
always contracted with a tacit
Reserve to Interest on both sides,
and seldom last longer than the
Prosperity of either Party, and during
that are frequently renouncâd
upon slight Disobligations, or languish
and die of themselves. Yet
if I may presume to give my Opinion
in a Case, where matter of Fact
does not appear, I think we shouâd
be the more Faithful even in this
too: For as we are less concernâd in
the Affairs of the World, so we have
less Temptation from Interest to be
false to our Friends.

|
Women truer Friends than Men.
|

Neither are
we so likely to be false throâ Fear;
because our Sex are seldom engagâd
in matters of any Danger. For
these Reasons it is, our Sex are generally
more hearty and sincere in the

133
ordinary Friendships they make
than Men, among whom they are
usually cloggâd with so many Considerations
of Interest, and Punctilioâs
of Honour; to which last perhaps
are owing the greatest part of
those honourable Actions, which
are mistakenly imputed to Friendship.
For something done to salve
Honour, commonly puts a Period
to all Friendship, with unfortunate
Persons; whom Men think they may
afterward grow cold to without Reproach.

These are the most considerable
Imperfections, or at least those,
which with most Colour of Reason
are chargâd upon us, as general Defects;
and I hope,
Madam
, I have
fairly shown, that the other Sex are
both by Interest and Inclination
more exposâd, and more Subject to
âem, than we.
Pride
,
Lust
,
Cruelty
,
and many more, are by the Declaimers
against us thrown into the
Scale to make weight and bear
us down, but with such manifest
Injustice, that without giving my

134
self any further trouble, I dare appeal
to any reasonable
Man
, and leave
him to decide the Difference.

|
More ill Men than Women.
|

I
know there was a
Tullia
, a
Claudia
,
and a
Messalina
; there was likewise,
a
Sardanapalus
, a
Nero
, a
Caligula
;
but if the Sexes in general
are to be reproachâd with, and measurâd
by these; Human Race is
certainly the vilest Part of the Creation.
âTis very ill
Logick
to argue
from Particulars to Generals,
and where the Premisses are singular,
to conclude Universally: But if
they will allow us the Liberty they
take themselves, and come to numbering
the Vicious of both Sexes,
they will certainly out poll us by
infinite Numbers. It were therefore
better Policy surely in them, to quit
a way of arguing, which is at once
so false, and so much to the disadvantage
of the Cause they contend
for: and when they can by sound
Arguments make out any Advantages
their Sex has over ours, other
than what I have already granted,
I am ready to be convincâd, and become
their Convert; and I make

135
no doubt but every ingenuous Man
will do as much by me. Thus I
have endeavourâd to vindicate our
Sex, from the unjust Imputations
with which some unreasonable, malicious
Men wouâd load us: For I am
willing to think the greater, or at
least the better Part of their Sex,
more generous than to encourage
their Scandal. There remains nothing
more, but to shew that there
are some necessary Qualifications
to be acquirâd, some good Improvements
to be made by Ingenious

Gentlemen
in the Company of our
Sex.

Many Advantages from Womens Company.

Of this number are
Complacence
,

Gallantry
,
Good Humour
,
Invention
,
and an Art, which (thoâ frequently
abusâd) is of admirable use
to those that are Masters of it,
the
Art
of
Insinuation
, and many
others. âTis true a Man may be
an Honest and Understanding Man,
without any of these Qualifications;
but he can hardly be a Polite, a
Well Bred, an Agreable, Taking
Man, without all, or most of these.

136
Without âem
Honesty
,
Courage
, or

Wit
, are like Rough
Diamonds
, or

Gold
in the
Ore
, they have their
intrinsick Value, and Worth, before,
but they are doubtful and obscure,
till they are polishâd, refinâd,
and receive
Lustre
, and
Esteem
from
these.

Complacence to be learnâd by it.

The Principal of these is
Complacence
,
a good Quality, without
which in a competent Measure no
Man is fitted for Society. This is
best learnt in our Company, where
all Men affect Gaiety, and endeavour
to be agreable.
State News
,

Politicks
,
Religion
, or private
Business

take up the greatest Part of
their Conversation, when they are
among themselves only. These are
Subjects that employ their Passions
too much, to leave any room
for
Complacence
; they raise too
much heat to suffer Men to be easie
and pleasant, and Men are too
serious when they talk of âem, to
suppress their natural Temper,
which are apt to break out upon any
Opposition. Men are as apt to defend

137
their Opinions, as their Property,
and wouâd take it as well to
have their Titles to their Estates questionâd,
as their Sense; and perhaps
in that they imitate the Conduct
of our Sex, and do, like indulgent
Mothers, that are most tender of
those Children that are weakest.
But however it be, I have observâd,
when such Arguments have been
introducâd even in our Company,
and by Men that affect Indifference,
and abundance of Temper, that
very few have been able to shew
so much Mastery, but that something
appearâd either in their Air,
or Expression, or in the Tone of
their Voices, which argued a greater
Warmth, and Concern, than
is proper for the Conversation of

Gentlemen
, or the Company of
Ladies
.
These Uneasinesses happen
not so often among us, because the
Men look upon us to have very
little Interest in the Publick Affairs
of the World, and therefore trouble
us very seldom with their grave,
serious Trifles, which they debate
with so much earnestness among one

138
another. They look upon us
as Things designâd and contrivâd only
for their Pleasure, and therefore
use us tenderly, as Children do
their Favourite Bawbles. They
talk gayly, and pleasantly to us,
they do, or say nothing that may
give as any Disgust, or
Chagrin
,
they put on their chearfullest
Looks, and their best Humour,
that they may excite the like in us:
They never oppose us but with a
great deal of Ceremony, or in
Raillery, not out of a Spirit of
Opposition, (as they frequently
do one another) but to maintain
a pleasant Argument, or heigthen
by variety of Opinions an agreable
Entertainment. Mirth, and Good
Humour reign generally in our
Society, Good Manners always;
For with us Men shew in a manner,
the Reverse of what they are one
to another: They let their thoughts
play at Liberty, and are very careful
of the Expression, that nothing
harsh, or obscene escape âem, that
may shock a tender Mind, or offend
a modest Ear. This Caution it is,

139
which is the Root of
Complacence
,
which is nothing but a Desire to
oblige People, by complying with
their Humours. âTis true some
Tempers are too Obstinate, and
froward, ever to arrive at any great
Heigth of this good Quality, yet
there is nothing so stubborn, but it
may be bent. Assiduity and constant
Practice will contract such
Habits, as will make any thing
easie and familiar, even to the worst
contrivâd Disposition; but where
Nature concurs, Men are soon
Perfect. This is one great advantage
Men reap by our Society, nor
is it to be despisâd by the Wisest of
âem, who know the use of this
Accomplishment, and are sensible,
that it is hardly, if at all, to be acquirâd,
but by conversing with us.
For thoâ Men may have Wit and
Judgment, yet the Liberty they
take of thwarting, and opposing
one another makes âem Eager, and
Disputative, Impatient, Sowre, and
Morose; till by conversing with us,
they grow insensibly ashamâd of such
Rustick Freedom. The truth of this

140
is Evident from the Observation of
the
Universities
, and
Inns
of
Court
,
I mean those Students in âem that
lead a more recluse and Monastick
Life, and converse little with our
Sex. They want neither Wit, nor
Learning, and frequently neither
Generosity, nor Good Nature, yet
when they come into gay, thoâ Ingenious
Company, are either dampâd
and silent, or unseasonably Frolicksom
and Free, so that they appear either
Dull, or Ridiculous.

Gallantry acquirâd by our Company.

Nor is
Complacence
the only thing
these Men want, they want likewise
the
Gallantry
of those Men
that frequent our Company. This
Quality is the heigth and perfection
of Civility, without which it is
either Languishing, or Formal, and
with which it appears always with
an engaging Air of Kindness, and
Good Will. It sets a value upon the
most inconsiderable Trifles, and
turns every Civility into an Obligation.
For in ordinary Familiarities,
and civil Correspondencies,
we regard not so much what, as

141
how things are done, the Manner is
more lookt upon than the Matter of
such Courtesies. Almost all Men
that have had a liberal, and good
Education know, what is due to
Good Manners, and civil Company.
But till they have been usâd a little
to Our Society, their Modesty fits
like Constraint upon âem, and looks
like a forcâd Compliance to uneasie
Rules, and Forms of Civility. Conversing
frequently with us makes
âem familiar to Men, and when they
are convincâd, as well of the Easiness,
as the Necessity of âem, they are
soon reconcilâd to the Practice.
This Point once gainâd, and they
become expert in the common, and
necessary Practices. Those that have
any natural Bravery of Mind, will
never be contented to stop there;
Indifference is too cold and Phlegmatick
a thing for âem, a little Formal
Ceremony, and common Civilities,
such as are paid to eâry one
of Course, will not satisfie their
Ambitious Spirits, which will put
âem upon endeavouring for better
Receptions, and obliging those,

142
whom they canât without Reproach
to themselves offend. This is the
Original, and first Spring of
Gallantry
,
which is an Humour of Obliging
all People, as well in our Actions
as Words. It differs from

Complacence
,

|
Difference betwixt Complacence and Gallantry.
|

this being more active,
that more passive; This inclines us
to oblige, by doing or saying after
our own Humours such things as
we think will please; that by submitting
to, and following theirs.
A Man may be
Complacent
without

Gallantry
, but he canât be
Gallant

without
Complacence
. For âtis possible
to please and be agreable, without
shewing our own Humours to
Others; but âtis impossible without
some regard to theirs: yet this
Pleasure will be but faint and languid,
without a Mixture of both.
This mixture of Freedom, Observance,
and a desire of pleasing,
when rightly tempered, is the true
Composition of Gallantry; of which,
who ever is compleat Master, can
never fail of being both admirâd, and
belovâd. This Accomplishment is
best, if not only to be acquirâd by

143
conversing with us; for besides the
natural Deference, which the Males
of every observable Species of the creation
pay to their Females, and the
Reasons before given for
Complacence
,
which all hold good here, there is
a tender Softness in the Frame of
our Minds, as well as in the Constitution
of our Bodies, which inspires
Men, a Sex more rugged, with the
like Sentiments, and Affections,
and infuses gently and insensibly
a Care to oblige, and a Concern
not to offend us.

Invention, improvâd by our Society.

Hence it is that they employ all
their
Art
,
Wit
, and
Invention
to say
and do things, that may appear to
us, surprizing and agreable either for
their Novelty or Contrivance. The
very End and Nature of Conversation
among us retrench aboundance
of those things, which make the
greatest part of Menâs discourse,
and they find themselves obligâd
to strain their Inventions to fetch
from other Springs, Streams proper
to entertain us with. This puts
âem upon beating and ranging ore

144
the Fields of Fancy to find something
new, something pretty to offer
to us, and by this means refines
at the same time their Wit, and enlarges,
and extends their Invention;
For by forcing âem out of the common
Road, they are necessitated to
invent new Arguments, and seek new
ways to divert and please us, and
by restraining the large Liberty they
take one with another, they are
compellâd to polish their Wit, and
File off the Roughness of it. To
this they owe, the Neatness of
Raillery, to which abundance of
Gentlemen are now arrivâd; For
Contrariety, of Opinions, being
that which gives Life, and Spirit
to Conversation, as well Women as
Men do frequently hold Arguments
contrary to their real Opinions, only
to heigthen the Diversion, and improve
the pleasure of Society. In
these the utmost Care is taken to
avoid all things that may sound harsh,
offensive, or indecent, their Wit is
employâd only to raise mirth, and
promote good Humour, Conditions
that canât well be observâd, when

145
Men
contend for Realities,

|
Fools no fit Companions for Women.
|

and dispute
for the Reputation of their
Wit or Judgment, and the truth of
their Opinions. âTis true these
Improvements are to be made only
by Men, that have by Nature an
improvable Stock of Wit and good
Sense; For those that have it not,
being unable to distinguish what is
proper for their Imitation, are apt
to Ape us in those Things which are
the peculiar Graces and Ornaments
of our Sex, and which are the immediate
Objects of Sight, and need
no further Reflection, or thinking.
This Affectation is notorious in our
Modern
Beau
âs, who observing the
Care taken by some of our Sex in the
setting of their Persons, without
penetrating any farther into the
Reasons Women have for it, or considering,
that what became them,
might be ridiculous in themselves,
fall to licking, sprucing, and dressing
their Campaign Faces, and ill
contrivâd Bodies, that now, like all
Foolish Imitatours, they out do the
Originals, and out-powder, out-patch,
and out-paint the Vainest

146
and most extravagant of our Sex at
those Follies, and are perpetually
Cocking, Brustling, Twiring, and
making Grimaces, as if they expected
we shouâd make Addresses
to âem in a short Time. Yet ought
not this to discourage any Ingenious
Person, or bring any Scandal upon
our Conversation, any more than
Travelling ought to be brought into
Disrepute, because it is observâd,
that those, who go
abroad Fools, return
Fops
. It is not in our power to
alter Nature, but to polish it, and
if an Ass has learnt all his Paces,
âtis as much as the thing is capable
of, âtwere absurd to expect he
shouâd chop
Logick
. This is so far
from being an Objection against us,
that it is an Argument, that none
but Ingenious Men are duely qualified
to converse with us; Who by
our Means have not only been fitted,
and finishâd for great things,
but have actually aspirâd to âem.
For âtis my Opinion, that we owe
the Neat, Gentile Raillery in Sir

George Etheredge
, and Sir
Charles
Sedley
âs Plays, and the Gallant

147
Verses of Mr.
Waller
to their Conversing
much with Ladies. And I
remember an Opinion of a very Ingenious
Person, who ascribes the
Ruine of the
Spanish Grandeur
in great
measure, to the ridiculing in the
Person of
Don Quixot
, the
Gallantry

of that
Nation
toward their
Ladies
.
This Opinion however Ingenious
carries me beyond the Scope and design
of the present Argument, and
therefore I shall leave all further
Consideration of it to those that are
more at leisure, and less weary than
I am at present.

There remain yet some things to
be spoken to, but I must confess to
you,
Madam
, that I am already very
much tired, and I have reason to
fear that you are more. When you
enjoynâd me this Task, I believe,
you did not expect, I am sure, I
did not intend so long a Letter. I
know I have written too much, yet
I leave you to judge, whether it be
enough. One Experience I have
gainâd by this Essay, that I find,
when our Hands are in, âtis as

148
hard to stop âem, as our Tongues,
and as difficult not to write, as not
to talk too much. I have done
wondring at those
Men
, that can
write huge Volumes upon slender
Subjects, and shall hereafter admire
their Judgment only, who can confine
their Imaginations, and curb
their wandring Fancies. I pretend
no Obligation upon our Sex for this
Attempt in their Defence; because
it was undertaken at your Command,
and for your Diversion only,
which if I have in any measure
satisfied, I have my Ambition, and
shall beg nothing farther, than that
my ready Obedience may excuse
the mean Performance of

Madam,

Your real Friend, and

Most humble Servant
.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

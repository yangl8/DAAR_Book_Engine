The House of the Wizard

CHAPTER I

THE CAREWS OF DEVON

In
the days of King Henry VIII., between
Honiton and Exeter, at Luppit, stood Mohunâs
Ottery, the great house of the Carews of
Devon. Built like a fortress, it was too strong
to be reduced, save by cannon, and its walls
had sheltered for many years a race of gallant
gentlemen, while its gates were ever open with
a generous hospitality that welcomed both the
rich and the poor. Its furnishings and tapestries
were so magnificent that it was commonly
reported that they would grace the kingâs
palace at Greenwich and not suffer by contrast
with any royal trappings.

The Carews were famous, both at home and
abroad, and had been since the first Carru
came over with the Norman Conqueror. There
was never a quarrel on English soil, or for the
English cause, that a Carew was not in the
forefront of the battle. One had been Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, one a captain of Harfleur
[8]

for King Henry V., and another fought for
Henry VII. A proud and valiant race, claiming
kindred with the Geraldines, loyal and courteous
to their friends and ready with sword and
dagger for Englandâs foes and their own. Sir
William Carew, the head of the Devon branch
of the family, held noble sway at Mohunâs
Ottery, and day by day a hundred poor and
more were fed by his open hand, for in those
times there was no niggardly charity, although
the kingâs laws spared not the valiant beggar.
Every gentlemanâs house was in itself a tavern,
and men of all conditions came unbidden to the
board, finding, too, a nightâs lodging, even
though it might be but a bed of straw upon the
stone floor of the hall. The food was neither
scanty nor of mean order; cooks who fed a hundred
or so at one meal were accustomed to
serving in a day beef, mutton, venison, pigs,
geese, plovers, curlews, besides pike, bream,
and porpoise, and of ale and wine there was
no lack. A plentiful, free feast that drew a
multitude of pensioners; the odors that floated
from the kitchens, even on a fast day, brought
a retinue of visitors to the doors, and after
meal time the sounds of revelry told their
own story, giving ample proof that there were
no empty stomachs.

[9]
It was Shrove Tuesday in the year 1535,
and the midday dinner was over at Mohunâs
Ottery, as great a company as usual having
been entertained. Upon the doorstep stood
Sir William Carew and his guest, Master
Raleigh, the father of Sir Walter, who was
then unborn. These two worthies were engaged
in deep and grave converse upon public
matters, for the Act of the Supremacy had been
followed by the Treason Act, and Sir Thomas
More and Bishop Fisher were in the Tower,
having refused to take the oath without conditions.
So there was no lack of matter for discussion,
and the faces of these two were neither
unruffled nor jolly, though they had so lately
dined. However, their conversation was
doomed to a sharp interruption. A horse and
rider came suddenly in sight upon the high-road,
advancing at so mad a gait that both men
paused in their talk to watch the approach. A
great bay horse, flecked with foam and with
blood upon his flank, showing a cruel spur, and
on his back a large and handsome man, gayly
dressed, his velvet cloak embroidered with gold
and his hat beplumed, but reeling in his saddle,
keeping his seat, as it seemed, only by a miracle.

âIt is Sir Thomas,â Raleigh remarked, after
a second glance at the red face of the rider.

[10]
âAy,â retorted Carew, bitterly, âmy worthy
brother and, as usual, in his cups. A naughty
rogue it is, and like to be a disgrace to his
blood.â

As he spoke, he fixed a scornful gaze upon
the drunken man who was now coming to the
door, trying, too, to sit straight in the saddle,
as if he knew that his brotherâs disapproving
eyes were on him. A little way from the
entrance stood a large stone horse-block, from
which the women of the household mounted,
and toward this Sir Thomas Carew urged his
horse.

âHe has been gaming at Exeter,â Sir
William remarked coldly; âhe is ever thus
after he has been brawling and drinking in a
public house. I have not seen him for a
twelvemonth, and I doubt not that he comes
to borrow a hundred pounds; such is like
to be his case. âPon my soul, a meritorious
beggar!â

The words were scarcely spoken ere Sir
Thomas struck his spur again into his horseâs
bleeding flank. The great brute plunged,
swerving madly to one side; his tipsy rider,
reeling from the saddle, fell headlong upon the
stone block, rolled over and lay in a hideous
heap at his brotherâs feet. The horse turning
[11]

about as suddenly, trampled him under foot
and rushed back toward the stables, clearing a
wide path in the crowd of spectators who had
come out to view the accident. Sir William
and Raleigh both hastened to the fallen man,
but something in the limpness of his figure
told its own story. He lay face downward,
and they turned him over to find a lump of
mangled flesh, his neck being broken just
below the skull, and his drink-blurred eyes
stared into space.

âStone dead,â Carew said sternly; âcut off
in his sins. God pity him, for he is like
enough to be damned!â

âHere is a sad end,â rejoined Raleigh,
looking gravely at the dead man; âa gallant
gentleman brought into such a case by evil
communications. Lend a hand, good fellow,
and we will carry in this body,â he added,
addressing the nearest bystander, for the curious
crowd had gathered in a constantly narrowing
circle around the central figures.

âLet be, Raleigh,â Sir William interposed
coldly; âthese grooms shall take him up; he
deserved less for the dishonor he has brought
upon his name.â

With the same proud indignation, unforgiving
even to the dead, he directed the removal
[12]

of the corpse, and then he and Raleigh followed
it into the house. Without, all tongues
were loosed at their departure and gossip
flowed on every hand, and there was food
enough for it in such a life and such a death
as this.

âI told Sir Tom âtwould be so!â one of the
spectators said, with the air of a man who felt
justified; âthat brute was like to end some
manâs life, and who but a Carew would back
him in the state of liquor that yonder poor
gentleman was?â

âThat horse? Why, man, he held him above
all else he had,â cried another; âhe valued the
beast above his daughter.â

âLike enough,â was the reply; âcertain it
is that he valued him above his wife, poor
lady!â

âShe has been dead these many years, I
take it,â said a third; for, after the fashion of
all such leeches, they were eager to discuss the
affairs of the family whose substance they
devoured.

âAy, dead enough, good luck to her!â rejoined
the first speaker. âThey do say Sir
Thomas wagered her at dice the very night on
which his daughter was born, and lost his bet,
too; but his opponent levied not the debt, and
[13]

the poor lady, dying not many years thereafter,
perchance never knew it. Howbeit, it is
certain that had she known it, she could
not have hated him more heartily than she
did.â

âThatâs true enough, my masters,â said an
ancient crone. âI knew her woman, and a
sorry death the poor thing made. Even at that
hour her husband was as tipsy as he was but
now, and came into her chamber blubbering, as
a sot will sometimes, and with great oaths, that
he would guard her child. My lady heeded
not his voice, but cried out to her tirewoman
that the end was near, and she thanked the
dear God for it, and to let her go in peace!
She looked but once at her little daughter and
then fell to weeping and blessing her, saying
that the queen would care for this lamb, and
so turned her white face to the wall and
died.â

âThe queen,âdid she commend her baby
to the queen?â they all exclaimed.

âAy, ay,â the old woman answered, âto the
queenâs grace; there was but one queen then,
but now there is the old queen and Queen Nan
Bullen, and God wot how many queens there
be!â

âHold thy tongue, mistress!â cried one;
[14]

âthou wilt be up by the Treason Act, and
hang at Tyburn, if thou hast so foul a tongue!â

âBelike I shall, and all of ye,â the old creature
laughed shrilly; âbut it would not profit
much to twist my shrivelled neck, there be fairer
ones that would furnish a better entertainment.â

âWhere is Carewâs child?â cried one whose
thirst for knowledge was not yet slaked.

âHidden somewhere in that old nest of his,â
returned one of the gossips; âa sad life sheâs
had of it and is like to be in a worse case yet.
Sir Thomas never did her a good turn until
this day; the worst he did was to father her.
An ill-favored wench, too, when last I saw her,
thin and yellow and with a cold way that made
no friends.â

âThen ye have not seen her lately,â the
old woman said with a chuckle; âshe has shot
up like a young sapling, and has eyes like two
stars, and a smile that will turn many a young
foolâs head, albeit her purse is empty and her
kirtle patched.â

âPoor wench, poor Mistress Betty, my heart
doth ache for her,â a kinder woman said,
shaking her head.

Strangely enough, at that same moment
Mistress Betty Carew was spoken of within the
house by Sir William and his wife. He turned
[15]

from his brotherâs corpse, a certain stern relenting
in his face, and said to Lady Carew,
âThere is the child.â

âAy, we must have her here, William,â his
wife replied at once; âyou may not leave your
own blood in so poor a strait as he is like to
have left the maid.â

Sir William mused. âHow old is she?â
he asked.

âSeventeen, come Michaelmas,â Lady
Carew replied, watchful of her husbandâs face,
her own heart full of compassion for the
orphan.

âI know not how she may be bred up,â he
said doubtfully; âshe was a plain wench when
last I saw her, but that is five years since.
Well, well, she must even come and follow
this wretched manâs funeral, and then you
and she will doubtless find a way to settle it
to your own liking.â

So it was that Mistress Betty came to
Mohunâs Ottery; a tall, slim girl in a black
gown and with a calm look on her young face
that startled her uncle, so unlike was it to anything
in youth. Sir Thomas was carried from
the home of his ancestors with all due state
and ceremony, but there was no pretence of
mourning, and the well-born rogue was laid in
[16]

his narrow house without a tear. After it was
over, the affairs of the orphan were soon disposed
of by Sir William. Finding that she
was dowerless, save for a beauty of which her
childhood had given no promise, he kept her
under his own roof, and she lived there until
other events took her to far other scenes. She
was then in her girlhood, growing every day in
beauty of a strong and striking type, and carrying
her head like a queen rather than a penniless
maid living in dependence at her uncleâs
house. Her form, though slender, gave the
promise of a richer outline, and as she grew
happier in her new home, a color came into
her cheeks, a sparkle to her eyes that made
her lovely in the sight of many who marvelled
that so plain a child should grow so beautiful.
Lady Carew fretted much, however, at the
will that Mistress Betty showed, which brooked
no crossing, and the tongue that could, in
anger, cut like a whip, for this beauty was no
saint. There was, however, that in her lordly
nature which scorned all meanness and baseness,
a nobility that shone through the imperfections
of her temper like a star, and looked
out through the windows of her great eyes,âeyes
that were clear brown, heavily fringed
with black lashes, and set beneath two straight,
[17]

black brows. Her mouth closed, perhaps, a
trifle too firmly for so young a woman, and her
chin was clear cut as a manâs, but her voice
was sweet and low, and there was witchery in
her smile.

[18]

CHAPTER II

A MESSENGER FROM MY LORD PRIVY SEAL

Michaelmas
had come and gone, and it was
past the middle of October when a messenger
came down post-haste from London. It was
after supper, and there was revelry among the
retainers and visitors at Mohunâs Ottery. In
the great hall, however, there were but few;
Sir William had only his favored guest, Master
Raleigh, and besides these two were Lady
Carew, her daughter, Mistress Cicely, and her
niece. There were three sons, but none were
home. Peter, who ran away to France, was
even then with Sir John Wallop; that same
Sir Peter who made the barns of Crediton
smoke for the Lord Protector in after years.
That evening the little company sat about the
fire, the women working with their needles in
a group at the left, and at the right sat Raleigh
watching his host brew a posset. It was a
matter of grave import to Carew, and he let no
other hand mix the rare composition, but stood
over it; a noble figure, a man in middle life,
having a fine head and grizzled hair, with the
[19]

keen, bright eye and strong jaw of a resourceful
and stubborn nature. His rich dress of
Flemish velvet, dark as the dregs of wine, his
great lace ruff and heavy chain of gold, set
off his person and made it the more striking
in contrast to the darker, plainer garb of
Raleigh. The guest watched his friend stir
the beverage and smiled at his ardor.

âWhat secret lurks in it,â he said, âthat
you let no man brew it for you, Carew? I
should scarce be willing to take the pains that
you have this night, though I do heartily
acknowledge you the king of posset makers.â

âIf it be not worth the pains, it is not worth
the drinking,â replied Sir William; ââtis like
a fine child, it may not come into the world
without some travail and a good leech. See you,
friend Raleigh, there is a secret in stirring it
aright and putting in the parts in due season.
If the cream and almonds be not wisely boiled
with the amber and musk, and if you heat not the
sack before you put in the eggs, then is there
confusion, worse than these late troubles have
brought upon this realm, and caused much in the
same way, too, by a domestic disagreement.â

Master Raleigh shook his head gravely at
this, his mind slipping away from the posset as
his next words betrayed.

[20]
âIt will be happy for the realm if it prove
but a domestic quarrel,â he said thoughtfully,
âsince the Act of the Succession there can be
no doubt that there is much foreign meddling,
and, I fear me, plots against the kingâs majesty,
made over seas, are foster-mothered here at
Bugden; albeit, I do not greatly blame that
noble lady that she will not yield. To her it
must seem a sore and bewildering visitation of
evil.â

âGod help her!â cried Lady Carew; âshe
was a good wife to the king, and deserveth
better at his hands.â

âHush, madam!â retorted her lord, sternly;
âa womanâs heart is more full of pity than of
wisdom. It is not for us to dispute the matter;
there is talk enough, and no little harm from it.
The marriage hath been set aside, and let us
hear no more of it while there is another queen
and an infant princess.â

âAy, it is an easy matter for a man to forget
his wife for a pretty face,â replied the good
dame, hotly; âthis is a policy that men like,
since it favoreth their own slips upon the road;
but no good will come of it, I warrant.â

Raleigh laughed, looking from the husband
to the wife; and even Sir William smiled,
though a little grimly.

[21]
âThe women are all alike,â he said; âthere
is a great cackling amongst them over this,
and if the petticoats could set the kingdom in
order, I doubt not one fair lady would hang as
high as Haman.â

âI blame them not for their pity for one we
know,â Raleigh answered quietly; âit seems,
forsooth, a great wrong, yet would I not see
the Lady Mary come to the throne to bring
back the Bishop of Rome and the Spaniards.
These last I loved not ever; albeit there is
cause for mourning that we lose with them the
Flanders trade. Yet my heart has not been
in all these acts; the fall of Sir Thomas More
was, in itself, grief enough to me, for I had
much friendship for that virtuous gentleman.â

âCould it not have been averted?â asked
Lady Carew, sadly; âhe and Fisher both
consented to swear to the Act of the Succession,
with an exception, as I heard; could not
this suffice?â

âNay, madam,â Raleigh answered quietly,
âsince the very clauses they excepted to were
those which did declare the kingâs first marriage
illegal, and his present one legal. Of
what profit would it be to swear allegiance to
the Princess Elizabeth and, in the same breath,
to refuse her legitimacy? It may not be. We
[22]

must have a settled succession; if the king
have not male issue, I fear me there will be
war in any case. Besides the Lady Mary and
the troubles that my Lady Salisbury is like to
hatch in the cause of the White Rose, there
is the King of Scots, and verily no English
stomach can digest him and not vomit.â

âNay, forsooth!â exclaimed Sir William;
âthere shall be no Scotch dressing to an English
pudding while there is a sword in Devonshire.
If the king could but get a boy there
might be an end in peace, but as it is, one
girl child set up against another, and one-half
the kingdom crying âMary,â the other âElizabeth,â
and so blood and fire from Landâs End
to the Tweed, and, eftsoons, the King of
Scots!â

âFriend Carew, let not thy posset burn, for
all that,â said Master Raleigh, smiling, for in
his vexation Sir William had well nigh forgotten
his brewing.

ââTis ready,â Carew answered, taking it
from the fire; âCicely, wench, hast ground
the amber and sugar for it?â

As he spoke, there was a great stir without,
the sound of hurrying feet and voices. The
group by the fire paused in their talk to listen,
and looked down toward the door at the lower
[23]

end. In a moment it was opened and an attendant
came swiftly across the hall and addressed
Sir William, who still stirred the posset while
Mistress Cicely sprinkled the amber over it.

âA messenger from London, your worship,â
the servant announced hurriedly, âand he
craves leave to speak with you at once.â

âFrom whom?â asked Carew, shortly.

âMy lord privy seal,â replied the man, in
an awestricken tone.

Sir Williamâs face showed both surprise and
anxiety, but his manner changed but little.

âWhere have you got him?â he asked.

âWithout, sir; shall I bring him here?â

âNay, I will go to him,â Carew replied, after
an instant of thought. âRaleigh, drink thou
the sack, I will return again;â and he followed
the servant from the hall.

Lady Carew glanced nervously across at her
guest.

âMay it be trouble?â she asked in an anxious
voice.

Raleigh shook his head. âIn these times
we cannot know, madam,â he replied, âbut I
take it that Sir William stands well with the
kingâs highness and with Cromwell.â

âAy, so we believe,â she said, speaking
low, âbut which of us can know how soon
[24]

change may come? Wolsey, More, Fisher,
the unhappy and gracious lady at Bugden!
Why may not my good lord be caught also in
the toils?â

A shadow crossed Raleighâs face, but it was
only for the moment; after it came his ready
smile.

âMadam,â he said gently, âI know not how
it may be, but I am sure that Sir Williamâs
honest heart and clean hands are truly valued
by the kingâs grace; you know the saying is
that âKing Harry loves a man,â and nowhere
in this realm will he find a more valiant soldier
or a more honest and God-fearing gentleman
than your husband; albeit, Sir William mayâfrom
his own franknessâhave made some
enemies. A great-hearted man who dealeth
honestly is like to have them, for there be
many who do hate the odor of the truth.â

Lady Carew sighed. âIt may be that my
heart is over-anxious,â she said; âthese be
troubled times, and Sir William hath often
told me that my outspoken sympathy with that
good queen is like to bring him into evil
straits.â

There was no more time for the good dameâs
fears and misgivings, for at this moment Sir
William returned, followed by a young man of
[25]

fine bearing, whose rich attire was besprinkled
with mud from hard riding.

âMadam, I bring you a welcome visitor,â
Carew said briefly. âMy wife and Master
Raleigh, this is Master Simon Raby, the son
of Lord Raby of Sussex.â

The young stranger made his obeisance with
the easy grace of a courtier, drawing near to
the group by the fire, and at Sir Williamâs
invitation laying aside his cloak and disclosing
a gallant figure. A tall man, broad-shouldered
enough, yet graceful, with a fine,
frank face, which had in it the pink and white
color of a girlâs, but bold and brave enough to
bear this dainty touch of nature. His hair
was chestnut color, and his dark eyes were
keen, but with a merry glance in them. He
wore the rich dress of the court, his velvet
doublet slashed with satin and edged with fur,
Flanders lace upon his ruff, and in the side of
his velvet cap were set three crimson feathers,
clasped with a great jewel, while his velvet
cloak was lined with crimson sarsenet. Certainly
a figure for the two young girls to look
at in some amazement, being little used to
court gallants down in Devonshire; and while
they viewed him, no doubt approvingly but in
discreet silence, his eyes rested in some
[26]

wonder and manifest admiration upon the
glowing face of Mistress Betty. All the time,
however, he talked with Master Raleigh, while
Lady Carew and her husband spoke apart. Sir
William held in his hand a letter, of which
he evidently had much to say, and both he and
his wife glanced frequently at the two young
maidens by the fire. At last Carew turned
abruptly to his niece.

âBetty,â he said, âwhat say you to a brief
absence from home, that you may attend upon
a great lady, who is in poor health andâunhappy,
and so has need of your service?â

Mistress Betty looked up amazed, with a
pretty deepening of the color in her cheeks,
and it was noted that Master Raby listened to
her answer with much attention.

âI am so happy here at Mohunâs Ottery,
good uncle,â she said, âthat I love not the
thought of quitting it; yet so deep am I in your
debt that it is for you to direct me as you will,
and for me to obey with love and cheerfulness.â

Sir William smiled. âWisely and modestly
spoken, wench,â he said, âand I have so little
wish to part with you that I would fain find
an excuse to my lord privy seal, but there is
none. Therefore prepare for the journey; to-morrow
morning you will ride with me.â

[27]
Mistress Bettyâs bright face paled a little
and her eyes clouded. âWhere go we, uncle?â
she asked quickly.

âOf that you shall know hereafter,â he answered
shortly, his own brow frowning slightly;
âit is enough that you attend a noble lady by
order of the privy seal.â

Mistress Betty bit her lips, casting down
her eyes, a sudden chagrin in her manner.
Young as she was, she had no love of orders
that were unexplained, and Master Raby, seeing
her expression, addressed her with a pleasant
courtesy.

âI fear your service may be sad, mistress,â
he said gravely, âbut, happily for you, it is like
to be a short one, if rumor saith the truth.â

âIs it so, indeed?â exclaimed Raleigh, a
sorrowful surprise in his kindly face. âI heard
it not, ere now;â for he understood the reference,
although Betty did not.

âTrue enough, I fear me,â Raby answered,
âalthough we know it not at Greenwich.â

âHow goes it there?â asked Sir William,
anxiously.

âGay, marvellously gay,â his guest replied,
âthough the kingâs grace has been troubled
with the swelling in his leg again.â

At this Sir William shook his head.

[28]
âAnd no boy yet,â he said; âpray Heaven
this realm may see a prince before his highness
yields further to these troubles, and so leaves
us with our swords at each otherâs throats!â

âWhat other tidings?â asked Raleigh,
eagerly.

âNone of late importance,â Raby answered.
âFox has gone to talk to the Lutheran princes
against the French intrigues; Master Latimer
is made Bishop of Worcester; the parliament
has passed the vagrant act, and the universities
will pay no more tenths and first fruits; there
has been a great mask at Greenwich and a
wizard has come to London who promises to
show the king his own successor, but his grace
will none of him.â

âIt may be that he dreads to inquire into so
grave a matter,â suggested Lady Carew.

âI know not, madam,â answered Raby,
smiling; âit is a much mooted question, even
now that the little princess is proclaimed.â

âAy, but we have had already enough of
such fancies,â retorted Carew, stoutly; âwe
have not forgot the Oxford conjurer, nor the
prophecy that he made whereby he declared
that none of âthe Cadwallader bloodâ should
reign long, and would even have raised an heir
to Lancaster from the bloody field of Tewkesbury.
[29]

All such matters be but the beginning
of treason;â and the good baron turned to his
posset in open disgust of the sorcererâs arts.

Far other thoughts ran in the mind of his
elder guest; Raleigh sat looking at the fire
with much perplexity upon his face.

âLatimer a bishop!â he said, at last; âI
do remember the time when they would have
burnt him but for my lord cardinal; strange,
too, that Wolseyâs hand should have plucked
such a fagot from the fire. Verily, these are
days when swift changes come upon this
realm.â

[30]

CHAPTER III

MISTRESS BETTY GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD

Under
a gray sky and over moors, brown
with the frost, rode Mistress Betty Carew upon
her first journey into the great world. She
and her uncle were escorted by Master Raby
and a few stout retainers, all being well armed,
for travellers encountered some perils upon
those lonely roads. The young girl, going out
upon an unknown errand and feeling herself
almost a stranger even to Sir William, spoke
but little, her mind being full of many thoughts
and fancies. She had as yet no intuition of
her destination, and marvelled not a little at
the peremptory summons coming to one so
little known as she was. Happily for her, she
had been bred up in the school of misfortune
and had profited by its early and sharp lessons.
Naturally imperious in temper, she had learned
to submit to the inevitable, and accepted this
sudden and unwelcome change as part of her
uncertain destiny, knowing that her poverty
and dependence made her a plaything in the
hands of fate. She had learned also in that
[31]

early school to be a close observer of men
and women, and was not unskilful in reading
character, although so young. Therefore she
smiled a little when she heard her uncleâs
sharp comment on Simon Rabyâs groom.

âWhat hangdog knave is that thou hast
there, Raby?â Sir William asked, when they
were leaving an inn where they had stopped
for a few moments.

âYou mean not my groom surely, Sir
William?â said Raby, smiling; âan honest
fellow, who has served me two years or more.â

âI marvel that he stayed so long out of
gaol,â Carew answered dryly; âa crop-eared
villain, who will hang some day at Tyburn.â

The younger man laughed gayly. âA sorry
prophecy, sir,â he said lightly; âthe man has
served me faithfully, as far as I know, and
seems free enough of bad habits,âdrinks less,
thieves less, and quarrels less than most.â

âAy,â retorted Sir William, with a grim
smile, âhe would not quarrel openly, but keep
a knife for your back at midnight; I would give
him short shrift if he were mine.â

âVerily, I must look for another knave,â
Raby answered, still laughing. âI shall
scarce ride in comfort after this with the
fellow at my heels.â

[32]
âTake my word for it,â Carew returned; âI
have been magistrate and provost and chief
executionerâas it would seemâhere in
Devon, for all things are shifted on my
shoulders, and it is such-looking rogues as that
one who keep the hangman from forgetting
his trade.â

âYour uncle is a hard judge, Mistress
Carew,â Raby remarked; âI should not wish
to stand trial at his hands unless, perchance,
he liked my face. Here is my poor groom,
Thaxter, already doomed to hang for his.â

âTo speak truth, he has an evil countenance,
Master Raby,â she answered quietly, but with
a smiling glance at her uncle.

âYou are prejudiced by Sir William,â
Raby declared. âI am willing to wager that
the poor fellow is as honest as many with a
fair exterior.â

âI will take the wager, Raby,â Carew remarked
calmly, âand you will be the loser,
therefore make it not too heavy on your purse.â

âFifty pounds, and I do not fear to lose,â
the other cried, still much diverted by the
matter.

âI am that much a gainer,â Sir William
said, âbut I will pray you not to test the affair
at the moment by making him our guide. I
[33]

am not willing to trust my neck and Bettyâs to
his mercies.â

âMistress Carew shall take no risks,â Raby
replied; âyou and I will settle the wager
when we are not in so fair company. Indeed,
I trust that we shall make this journey safely
and with expedition, since my lord privy seal
was urgent that the matter should be speedily
accomplished.â

âWill they be ready for our reception?
Has yonder lady been notified, or is this the
act of Cromwell only?â Carew asked gravely.

Raby shook his head. âI know not,â he
answered. âI am but the bearer of certain
instructions, but I fear that theâthat her
grace is little consulted in the affair.â

Carew did not reply, but seemed to muse
over some grave subject, for his face became
almost stern in its repose; and Raby, seeing
his preoccupation, took his place at Mistress
Bettyâs bridle, guiding her horse and talking
lightly and pleasantly of those matters that he
thought would amuse his young companion.
He had been but lately at the court, and told
her of the jousts at Greenwich, when the
knights tilted before Queen Anne Boleyn.

âIt was a beautiful sight,â he said; âthey
wore white velvet, embroidered in silver, and
[34]

the lists were surrounded by the gayest ladies
of the court; there was a sheen of gold brocade,
and jewels; it was a scene worth seeing,
and âtwill be remembered long by those who
saw it.â

âAnd the queen?â Betty asked, with a
little hesitation, âis the queen as beautiful as
they say?â

âShe was thought to be the most beautiful
woman at court when she was Marchioness of
Pembroke,â Raby answered; âand she is still
fair to look upon, though I do think that there
are others more lovely. I doubt not she would
call it treason did she hear me say it,â he
added, smiling.

âI should like to see her,â Mistress Carew
said thoughtfully.

âYou have no need to seek so far to find a
fairer face,â Raby answered, with the gallantry
of a courtier.

And so they rode on, talking in a friendly
way until they seemed no longer strangers,
and were but little interrupted by Sir William,
who was wrapped in his own thoughts, which
were apparently not altogether pleasant ones.
Thus the three made the journey together,
and still Betty knew nothing of her destination,
though she marvelled more and more as
[35]

the way lengthened, and they stopped at first
one tavern and then another. But in those
days young girls were little considered and
were expected to submit, with implicit obedience,
to the guidance of their elders. More
than once Betty thought that she was likely to
come to her journeyâs end without knowing
her errand, but it was not to be so. The last
day of her travels brought her enlightenment.
Toward evening, when they were riding along
at an even gait and had just passed through a
small village, Master Raby fell back, leaving
uncle and niece alone, as though he gave them
opportunity for a last talk together, and Sir
William, almost at once, availed himself
of it.

âFair niece,â he said, âyou are truly a jewel
among women, for you have not yet asked me
a question. Did your aunt tell you whither
you were bound?â

âNay, uncle,â Mistress Betty answered
quietly, âbut I remember my cause for
gratitude and am willing to do your bidding,
though I should like to know where we are
going.â

Carew smiled. âThere spoke the woman,â
he said, âyet I fear you will be little pleased;
it is no lively errand for a girl. We are riding
[36]

to Kimbolton, where they have but lately
taken the princess dowager.â

âWhat, sir, do I go to the queen?â cried
Betty, in amazement.

âMind thy tongue, young mistress,â Carew
said sharply; ânot queen, but princess
dowager.â

âYou mean Queen Catherine, uncle,â Betty
retorted, some excitement in her voice; âI
cannot think of her as less than the queen.â

âThen must you learn to speedily,â Sir
William said, âfor you are sent down to Kimbolton
by my lord privy seal, and you must not
transgress the kingâs commandment in this
matter, whereby we are bidden to hold this
lady as only the widow of Prince Arthur.â

âI cannot see how that may be,â the young
girl cried; âshe was surely the kingâs wife,
and there be many who declare that there is
no divorcement.â

âBut ye are not of them, wench,â her uncle
said sternly; âhis grace of Canterbury hath
declared the kingâs first marriage null, and we
have naught to do with the opinions of the
Bishop of Rome, albeit this lady clings to his
judgment and will none of the kingâs.â

âUncle, do you believe that she is fairly
used?â asked Mistress Betty, with the fearful
[37]

honesty of youth; âthink you they had a right
to treat the daughter of a king with such
contumely?â

ââTis not for you to ask, or for me to
answer, niece,â Sir William answered sharply;
âit is done, and the Act of the Succession
hath set aside the Lady Mary. Mind, therefore,
that you fall into no error in these
matters, but do your duty, leaving these questions
to the bishops and the kingâs grace.â

âBut wherefore do they send me thither?â
she asked, her voice betraying her discontent;
âwhat need is there for me?â

âNow listen well to me, Betty,â her uncle
said sternly; âyou are young to be sent on
such an errand. The princess has been surrounded
only with her own creatures, there has
been some plotting, and my lord privy seal
would have one woman there who, being not of
it, will be a check upon them; and he sent to
me, because he puts some confidence in me,
and was recommended, too, by our kinsman,
the master of horse, Sir Nicholas Carew.â

For a moment there was silence, and then
Betty spoke with passionate feeling.

âSee you not, uncle, that they would make a
spy of me?â she cried; âhow can you bear that
this should be? Surely you are too honorable
[38]

to see your niece sent to watch and betray a
noble and an injured princess!â

âHark ye, fair niece!â said Sir William, in
a low tone, âI am not without sympathy for
yonder great lady; she has been hardly used,
though it is my peril to say so, and if you go
not to her, my lord privy seal will surely send
another who may, being tempted, work some
deep mischief to her. See ye not how grievously
an enemy might hurt her?â

âI see, I see,â Betty answered, âyet I can
never play the part of a spy!â

âNor did I ask you, wench,â Carew answered
grimly. âI would wring your neck
with my own hand, thought I you were so
mean a traitress. But remember that you owe
allegiance to the kingâs grace and you cannot
break it without as great dishonor. Let not
soft words prevail with you. It is commonly
reported that this poor lady is plotting mischief
with the Emperor of Germany and the
Bishop of Rome. Not that I greatly blame
her, Heaven knows, but it is a damnable
treason against this realm and is like to pull
us all by the pates if it succeeds. Meddle not
with it, bear no secret messages, open no
barred doors, steal no keys, though the lack of
them may lay a royal head upon the block.
[39]

Remember your allegiance, do your duty and
leave the rest to wiser brains than yours.â

âThat will I promise to do right cheerfully,â
Betty answered, âbut never could I betray a
woman in so sad a case.â

âIt is well,â Sir William said soberly; âdo
your duty and mind well your tongue, for it
may be that there will be some who would
right willingly set a snare for you to bring you
to disaster and work my downfall. I know
not how close an eye Cromwell hath upon me,
nor how he means to try me withal. He is a
cat who plays with many mice, and his trap is
the Tower.â

âHast thou then so many enemies, uncle?â
Betty asked, in some wonder.

âEnough and to spare, fair niece,â he answered;
âand there is much malice in a court:
it crawleth, like the serpent, on its belly, and
there is war between it and the seed of woman,
for it ever stings the heel of him who would
live honestly. It was such malice that pulled
down my lord cardinal. But enough; you
know your duty, and yonder is Kimbolton.â

[40]

CHAPTER IV

THE QUEEN AT KIMBOLTON

The
shadows of evening were gathering fast
when the little party halted at the gates of
Kimbolton. There was much parley, and the
royal warrant was produced before the visitors
were admitted, the delay and formality impressing
Betty with the feeling of entering a
prison; and she followed her uncle reluctantly
across the courtyard, where a few torches flared
in the gloom. No womanish qualms, however,
oppressed Carew, and he walked boldly forward,
leaving Raby to attend upon his niece,
an office which the younger man eagerly
accepted; indeed, he had already won the good
opinion of Mistress Betty by his courtly gallantry
upon the road. Bred in the country
and under unfortunate auspices, she was little
accustomed to the attendance of a courtier,
and she noted young Master Rabyâs courtesy
and graceful tact with some secret admiration,
though she held her head high and was, as
usual, chary of her smiles, perhaps, becauseâlike
every beautyâshe knew their value.
[41]

Unfavorably impressed both with the place
and with the lack of state and hospitality, she
shrank back a little, and so it was that she and
her cavalier were late in entering the hall, and
found Sir William already in deep converse
with the castellan, Sir Edmund Bedingfield.
Neither of these worthies heeded the young
people, scarcely noting their entrance, but
stood talking and perusing a letter, no doubt
the instructions of my lord privy seal. Mistress
Betty and Raby drew near to the fire in
the great chimney, a pile of logs of such
length that one end might burn while the
other was cold, but giving little warmth, for
the opening above was of such huge dimensions
that gusts of cold air came down with greater
alacrity than the sparks and smoke went up.
There was a lack of due attendance, a cheerless
and gloomy aspect that increased the young
girlâs unfavorable impression, and she shivered
a little, bending over the fire and holding out
her hands to the blaze.

âA dull place,â said Simon Raby, in a low
tone; âa dull place for an uncrowned queen.â

âPoor lady!â murmured Betty, forgetful of
her uncleâs recent instructions, ââtis enough
to break her heart.â

âI never knew her,â Raby answered. âI
[42]

was away in France with Sir John Wallop
until the queen that now is was crowned, but
they do tell me that this lady is too strong and
resolute a woman to greatly mourn the loss
of state or earthly glory; but âtis awful to
consign a princess to so mean a case as
this.â

Betty, remembering now the commands that
were laid upon her, turned the subject without
an open expression of her own feeling on this
point.

âYou were in France?â she said; ââtis
there my cousin Peter is; he ran away, you
know, and coming to Paris, was taken into the
household of Sir John Wallop.â

âI know him,â her companion answered,
smiling; âa gay and fiery gallant, who is like
to make a brave record for Mohunâs Ottery.â

At this moment they were interrupted by
Bedingfield, who, turning from Sir William,
for the first time cast a glance in Bettyâs
direction.

âIs this the maid?â he asked.

âCome hither, niece,â Carew said, âand
make your curtsy to Sir Edmund; you are
now committed to his charge to be introduced
to the princess dowager.â

âWho is little likely to be pleased thereat,â
[43]

remarked Bedingfield, with a frankness which
yet farther chilled Bettyâs heart. âI bid you
welcome, mistress,â he added dryly; âit is a
sorry place for a young maid at best, and of
late her highness has been ailing and in no
plight to crave gay attendance.â

âDiscourage her no more, Bedingfield,â Sir
William remarked; âthe wench is sufficiently
cast down at the prospect, without your croaking
talk.â

âIt mends not a matter to dress it in gay
colors,â Bedingfield retorted briefly. âCome,
young mistress, follow me to the princess;
there is no place to bestow you until I know
her wishes, and âtis best to cut a long matter
short.â

âI would make some changes in my garments,â
Mistress Betty said quietly, âbefore I
go toâto her grace.â

âThere is no need,â Sir Edmund replied,
with evident impatience to have an unpleasant
task accomplished; âyou may lay aside your
cloak in the antechamber while I learn her
highnessâs wishes in the matter, and so end it.â

Without more words, he turned to the staircase
and began the ascent, and after one glance
at her uncle to ascertain his wishes, Betty followed
with a heavy heart. She was not without
[44]

a little thrill of excitement at the thought
of seeing this unhappy queen, and there was,
too, all a young girlâs curiosity and eagerness
for adventure, but she dreaded a cold reception,
knowing so well how unwelcome she was
likely to be, sent, as she was, by one whom
the poor woman must regard as her greatest
enemy. So in a tumult of contrary emotions
Mistress Betty walked down the gloomy, ill-lighted
corridor, behind the castellan, mentally
contrasting this dull place with Mohunâs
Ottery. They were not to gain admittance
without some parley; the queen allowed no
intercourse with the royal officers stationed
about her by the king. She lived among her
own people, and Bedingfield had to crave permission
to speak with her. Finally, a page
admitted them into a small anteroom, where
Betty was told to wait and lay aside her
mantle. There was a closed door opposite to
the one at which they had entered, and from
behind it came the sound of voices engaged in
conversation, which was hushed as Bedingfield
opened the door and passed through. Betty
knew that he was going into the presence of
the queen, and she stood listening with anxiety.
She heard a womanâs voice address him at
once; the cold dignity of the tone and the
[45]

slightly foreign accent made her sure of the
identity of the speaker.

âWhat tidings, Sir Edmund?â she asked;
âmy maids tell me there is a stir below, and
truly we long for any change; ay, almost welcome
evil rather than the dull monotony of
suspense.â

âNo news, madam,â replied Bedingfield;
âonly a messenger from my lord privy seal
andââ

âAlack, alack!â cried Catherine, hastily,
âI did not speak sooth; news from that quarter
is ill news indeed. If it had been from the
kingâs highnessâbut that comes no more to
me.â

âIn a way it is, madam,â Sir Edmund answered;
âthe kingâs grace hath sent another
maid to attend upon your highness.â

âAnother maid!â the queen exclaimed, in
a tone of irony; âyou mock me, sir; âtis not
possible that so great state is allowed the
Queen of England? Four maids! Such a
train will be a grievous charge upon you.â

âNay, madam, I do beseech you, lay not
the blame of your poor attendance upon me,â
Bedingfield said, with some feeling; âI may
not exceed my orders.â

âYour orders,â said the queen, bitterly;
[46]

âwho gave them to you, man, but that tailorâs
son, mine enemy?â

âNay, madam; you do wrong my lord privy
seal,â Bedingfield returned; âhe is but the
mouthpiece of the kingâs grace.â

âIt may be, and it should not be,â Catherine
said sadly; âyet the time may come when
even Cromwell will regret it. I do remember
that my lord cardinal wrought against me to
his own downfall, and died loving me, as I
believe, better than his creature, who still
wears a paper crown.â

There was a momentâs pause, and then Bedingfield
spoke abruptly.

âI would know your highnessâs pleasure in
regard to the maid who waits without.â

âThe maid!âwhat maid?â exclaimed Catherine,
as if awakened from a dream; âoh, ay,
I do remember! Why, send her to me, sir; I
fear her not, even though she be a spy of my
lord privy seal. If she has a womanâs heart,
doubtless it will be moved to see her queen
brought to so low estate; and if she has no
heart, then will I rejoice that mine enemies
may have a true report of how chastely and
honorably the Queen of England bears herself
under the deepest injury that a woman and a
wife can suffer.â

[47]
âDo I understand that your grace will see
the maid to-night?â Bedingfield asked dryly.

âWhen it be your pleasure, sir,â the
queen answered coldly; âa prisoner hath
no choice.â

âNay, madam,â Bedingfield began haughtily,
âIââ

âSend her, sir,â exclaimed the queen,
sharply; âI would see her now! I am weary,
and words mend not my case; let us so end
the matter.â

âAs you will, madam,â the castellan replied;
âI do but my duty.â

âI doubt it not, good Bedingfield,â she answered
with sad courtesy, âbut I have known
duty more graciously done. Howbeit, send
me the maid; I would see what sort of a
creature my Lord Cromwell sends to watch
his queen.â

âYour grace mistakes the matter,â Sir
Edmund said awkwardly; âthis is a well-bred
maiden, the niece of a gallant gentleman of
Devon, Sir William Carew.â

âCarew?â repeated the queen, thoughtfully.
âI should know the name, kindred of the
master of horse, as I remember, and he is truly
a noble soldier. Fate and Cromwell are propitious;
I looked for worse. Let there be no
[48]

more delay, sir; my heart fluttereth at the
thought of four female attendants,â she added,
with a touch of irony.

Having overheard all this talk, so little
calculated to allay her misgivings, Betty waited
for Bedingfieldâs summons with increased
agitation. When he came to the door and
beckoned to her to advance, she did so with
great reluctance; although never a timid girl,
she felt deeply embarrassed as she entered the
room beyond, and found herself in the presence
of Catherine of Arragon. Her eyes dazzled
by the greater illumination, she was, at first,
only conscious that she stood in a large room
where there was a bright fire burning on the
hearth, and before it several figures. She
made her curtsy almost mechanically, and it
was a moment before she collected her thoughts,
and then she found that the queen was addressing
her.

âI bid you welcome, maiden,â Catherine
said not unkindly. âSir Edmund tells me
that you are sent by my lord privy seal, whereby
I know you to be chosen rather to his liking
than my own comfort; but God forbid that I
should misjudge so young a heart as thine!
What is your name?â

âBetty Carew,â was the answer, in a low
[49]

tone, âthe daughter of Sir Thomas Carew of
Devon.â

âThomas Carew,â repeated the queen, with
sudden recollection. âYour mother was the
daughter of Lord Penrith; I knew her well,
and I do now recall that she commended her
child to my care, when I was little able to care
for any one; a falling tree doth crush the
flower at its root. Blessed Virgin, how strange
is destiny! That very child sent down to
watch her royal mistress!â

Catherine spoke in a low tone, more to herself
than to those about her, and sat for a few
moments lost in revery. She was seated in a
great chair before the hearth, and there was
much calm dignity and sadness in her whole
aspect, but she was both unlovely and unattractive;
a stout woman with a pale, large-featured
face which ill health and trouble had
aged before her time. Her expression was
austere, and there were traces of deep sorrow
and anxiety in the furrows that already marked
her brow and the deep purple shadows under her
dark eyes. Her gown was of black velvet, with
large, flowing sleeves over small, straight ones,
which had lace ruffles over the hands. On her
head was a high, crownlike, five-cornered cap
edged with jewels, two pieces falling down
[50]

from it over the ears, and at the back was fastened
the Spanish mantilla, its graceful folds
draping her shoulders and showing her face in
strong relief against the black background.
Behind her chair were grouped three ladies-in-waiting,
and all bent curious glances on the
young stranger. Mistress Bettyâs blooming
youth and brilliantly colored beauty had never
shown to a more dazzling advantage than it did
by contrast now, and Catherine herself, looking
up from her revery, observed it and smiled
sadly.

âAlas!â she said, âpoor maid, this place is
like to be no better than a tomb to one so
young, albeit safer for your soulâs grace now
than Greenwich. I have no entertainment, no
masks, no dances to break the cold monotony.
You may pray here, weep here, die here, but
verily, you will have no revelry. If you but
remember to be a woman, and bear a womanâs
heart in your breast, as did your mother, you
will find me no unkind mistress to you, though,
God knows, an impoverished one. Wilt serve
me on such terms as these?â

âMadam, I will do my duty, and I can no
more,â Betty answered in a low tone, divided
between her pity and her uncleâs instructions.

The queen smiled ironically. âWell tutored
[51]

in her âduty,â doubtless,â she said, turning to
her maids; âa cautious answer, aptly mouthed.
But, pshaw! I grow a weak woman to be angered
with a baby. The wench is tired, I know;
these men take no thought for a womanâs
strength, and doubtless she has ridden long and
far. Take her away and find some place to
bestow her, and to-morrow we will give some
employment to her. Can you sing, Mistress
Carew?â she added to Betty.

âI can both sing and play upon the harp,
madam,â the young girl answered gravely, for
Catherineâs words offended her, even though
she felt the justice of the queenâs suspicions.

âA musician,â said Catherine, more graciously;
ânow am I reconciled. Like Saul,
my soul finds consolation in music; it seems
my lord privy seal would send me a female
David! Well, well, leave me, maiden; I am
weary, and I would not have you think your
queen a sour and uncharitable woman with no
lenient word for youth. Go eat and sleep, and
to-morrow we will be merry.â

[52]

CHAPTER V

THE GENTLEMAN IN THE RUSSET CLOAK

Queen Catherineâs
prediction that life at
Kimbolton would be gloomy for a young girl,
seemed likely to be fulfilled. Happily, for
Mistress Bettyâs comfort, she had already
undergone such discipline in both poverty and
solitude that she was better fitted to endure
restraint and depressing surroundings than
others of her years. Sir William Carew and
Master Raby bade her farewell the morning
after her arrival, and from that time she encountered
no very friendly treatment, except
from Sir Edmund Bedingfield. The queen
was never unkind, but she looked upon Betty
with suspicion, and a settled conviction existed
in her mind that the young girl was a spy of
my lord privy seal, while her three attendants,
all women who were devoted to her person,
resented still more intensely the presence of
the new lady-in-waiting. At the same time,
Bettyâs youth, beauty, and many attractions
won upon them, in spite of themselves, and
they could not be harsh or malicious to so
[53]

charming a creature. After the first week or
two they relaxed a little in their manner toward
her, and gradually she won her own place in
the little household, though she was never
trusted in any confidential matter; and often,
at her approach, conversation was hushed or
writing materials put aside, and an artificial
manner assumed, as before a stranger. Intensely
as Betty resented the distrust and
coldness, she was not without a feeling of
thankfulness that her sympathies would never
be appealed to, that they seemed to have no
wish to work upon her for any of their secret
purposes. That there was much scheming
she could not doubt from many little indications,
and from occasional passages in the conversation,
she learned that Catherine was still
industriously employed in appealing both to
the Emperor Charles and to the new pope. To
all these matters Betty tried to close her eyes
and ears, and indeed it seemed to her that it
could not last long; it required no very observant
eye to see that the queen was suffering
from some malady even more dangerous than
grief and mortification. There were many
days when the royal sufferer never left her bed,
and at such times she seemed to find genuine
consolation in Bettyâs harp and her clear,
[54]

sweet voice. The young girl, moved by deep
pity for the injured queen, was ever ready to
give her the comfort of her music, and so,
little by little, she gained a place in Catherineâs
regard, though herself chilled and sometimes
repulsed by the coldness and suspicious
austerity of the Castilian princess. Just, virtuous,
and religious, Catherine did not also
possess the attraction of sweet and gracious
manners, and her natural austerity had been
increased by the usage she had received in
England. She was devout in the observance
of her religion, rising at five oâclock in the
morning for prayers, and fasting with rigid
exactness. Beneath her robes she had always
worn the habit of a nun of the order of Saint
Francis, and she held the vanities of the world
in contempt, even while she contended for her
earthly honors. Heavily oppressed by her sorrows
and deeply distressed for the future of her
daughter, the unhappy queen had neither leisure
nor inclination to win the affection of the
young attendant so unceremoniously thrust upon
her. So it was that Mistress Betty stood as one
apart, and watched the sad little drama to its
close without feeling herself one of the actors.

Catherine held a little court each day, unless
her health prevented it, many visitors coming
[55]

and going at Kimbolton in spite of the surveillance
of the royal officers. Although he feared
her influence, the king had never isolated her;
he either respected her too much, or hesitated
because of the popular feeling in her favor,
and the attitude of the foreign princes. She
was in the hands of the officers of the crown,
but they dared not treat her as a prisoner, and
the sympathy of a large portion of the kingdom
showed itself, more or less openly, in many
ways. Yet life at Kimbolton was gloomy
enough, and the queen being almost constantly
indisposed, her maids had small opportunities
for out-of-door exercises and none for sports.
Their greatest entertainment was to embroider
in the evenings, gathered about the invalidâs
chair, or to play cards,âa game in which the
queen sometimes joined, though it was whispered
among her women that she had hated
the sight of a card since she had played with
Anne Boleyn at Greenwich. Although Betty
felt herself an object of indifference to the
little circle, she was more noticed and commented
upon than she was aware. The fresh
beauty of the young girl was often the subject
of conversation, when her back was turned;
even the queen observing it and speaking of
Bettyâs many charms.

[56]
âA fair face,â she said to her attendants,
âand a soft voice; âtis a pity if both are
false.â

âI cannot think so, madam,â one of the
older women replied; âthe child has a candid
eye and an upright conduct that denies all
secret dealings.â

âIt should be so,â Catherine remarked sadly.
âI knew her mother, a very honest woman, but
she is long dead, and how shall we know how
they bring up our children? Alas! when I
think of the Princess Mary, my heart bleeds.
I, too, am led to think well of this little
maid, yet I never knew my lord privy seal
to send a lamb into my fold to comfort me
withal.â

âIt may be he has mistaken his choice,
madam,â her woman answered; âthere be
more people for your grace than against you;
yea, more than half this kingdom.â

âIt may be,â the queen replied; âI will so
believe it. Truly, I hate to look with suspicion
on so fair a face, yet I know one fair
face that hideth a false heart. But all women
are not harlots, thanks be to the Virgin! This
young girl tells me she has never been to
court, never seen a joust, never joined the gay
revellers at a mask. Doubtless her uncle will
[57]

take her presently to curtsy to that woman
whom they call the queen, the true queen being
not dead, albeit like to die. Mistress Carew
will make a fair figure at the court, fairer than
many, say you not so, Patience?â

âAy, gracious Queen,â Patience answered,
eagerly catching the drift of her royal mistressâs
thoughts, âI know none fairer; she is
so tall and straight and withal so beautifully
moulded. Not lean and long, but round and
supple; and her skin is dazzling when the
color comes, while those brown eyes of hers
are two shining lights, and she has a mouth
like Cupidâs bow.â

âTruly, you have drawn a picture that might
delight a lover,â Catherine said, smiling; âthe
court is a dangerous place to show such
charms. What think you, my girls, is she not
fairer than one Anne?â

âA hundred times,â they answered gladly,
ever willing to humor their unhappy mistress.

For a moment the queen did not reply; she
sat looking before her with an ironical smile
playing about her lips.

ââTis a pity to mew up such a beauty at
Kimbolton,â she said at last. âAh, if we
could but get my lord privy seal to take her to
the court, then might we see if the star that
[58]

shineth there is fixed, or but trembles to its
fall. Alas!â she continued, after a moment,
rousing herself from her mood, âhow captivity
and misfortune sour the temper! My thoughts
were most unworthy and unqueenly. I may
well let that poor creature rush to her certain
doom unmolested by any ill-will of mine; a
crown so ravished must press with thorns upon
the wearerâs brow.â

Unconscious both of their admiration and
their talk of her, Mistress Betty went her way
among them, the gloomy experience telling in
a manner upon her life and character, teaching
her alike to repress her natural feelings
and to endure suspicion without openly expressing
her indignation. The last was no easy
matter, for she had a high temper and a passionate
resentment of injustice. Her only
comfort was the privilege she enjoyed of long
rides with Sir Edmund Bedingfield. Knowing
her uncle, and trusting her where he would not
have dared to trust the queenâs older attendants,
he gave her more license. Finding that
she rode well and loved to be on a fine horseâs
back, having inherited her fatherâs appreciation
of a good animal, Bedingfield permitted
her to accompany his party when he made
excursions in the neighborhood. And so it
[59]

was that, by a chance, Mistress Carew made
the acquaintance of a person who was to play
no unimportant part in her life. Accompanied
by her woman and two stout grooms, she had
been out with Sir Edmund upon an errand in
the country near Kimbolton. Returning at
noonday, they drew rein at the Inn of the Sign
of the Blue Boar, where Bedingfield and his
two male attendants dismounted and went into
the tavern, Sir Edmund for some information,
and the two men for liquor. Betty and her
woman waited without, and as they were
detained a little while, there was ample opportunity
to look about them. It being noonday,
the courtyard of the Blue Boar was full of
horses, tied and awaiting their masters, who
were eating and drinking within. A few idle
grooms lounged near the stables, waiting to
earn a guerdon from a new arrival, and in the
window of the kitchen leaned two or three
rosy-faced maids gazing out at the scene.
Bettyâs horse, a restive creature, stood out
upon the road at the gate, and being occupied
with her own thoughts, she let the reins lie
slack upon his neck, although she knew his
spirit. Suddenly there was the sound of a
horseâs hoofs upon the road behind her, coming
at a gallop, and she turned her head to
[60]

observe the new arrival. As she did so, a
piebald horse with a darkly cloaked rider on
his back came dashing past her. She had no
time for observation; her own animal plunged
so wildly that she nearly lost her seat, and
kept it only by virtue of her early training.
So strange was the encounter that she was
almost certain that the new-comer cut her horse
with his whip as he passed. How it was, she
could not tell, except that her gallant black
was off at a gallop, and she could scarcely have
curbed him but for the interference of the
rider of the piebald steed. He dashed along
the road, riding across her path, and with wonderful
dexterity caught her bridle rein, halting
the runaway. Coming thus to a standstill,
some twenty yards from the inn, Betty found
herself face to face with the stranger, while
behind them there was a great commotion, all
the visitors at the tavern having run out to
witness what they expected would be an accident.
Intensely angry and with scarlet cheeks,
Mistress Betty gazed haughtily at the cause of
her misadventure. The rider of the piebald
was a man far below average size, thin and
wiry, with a small, dark face, grizzled hair and
mustaches, and eyes of such keenness and so
intensely black that they startled the observer,
[61]

saving their owner from any charge of insignificance.
Insignificant he was not, in spite
of his small stature and his plain garments,
which were russet in color from his high riding-boots
to his cloak, which he wore after the
fashion of the Spaniards. Encountering now
Mistress Carewâs indignant gaze, he took off
his hat with elaborate courtesy and congratulated
her on her safety as if he were unconscious
of having had any part in the matter.

âIt was fortunate that I came at the moment,
fair mistress,â he said; and she noticed that he
had a singular but not unpleasant voice. âYou
are riding too spirited an animal for a lady;
let me recommend a gentler one to Sir
Edmund.â

Betty started at the mention of Bedingfieldâs
name, but recollecting how well he was known
in the neighborhood of Kimbolton, she thought
it but folly to be surprised that the stranger
knew to whose party she belonged.

âI thank you, sir,â she said, a little curtly;
âthe horse has never acted so before unless
switched, and, indeed, I do not think he would
have run had you ridden at a more moderate
pace.â

âI grieve to think myself the cause of your
discomfort, madam,â the stranger replied, but
[62]

with an amused smile. âJack Kotch and I
never go slow,â he added, turning his horse,
and, to her annoyance, keeping at Bettyâs rein
as she went toward the inn.

âIt is ill judged to run a horse so close to
one standing as mine was,â she said, still too
angry to let the matter pass.

âIt is, and I crave your pardon,â the other
rejoined cheerfully; âanother time I will bring
my horse to a walk, Mistress Carew.â

Betty looked up amazed at hearing her own
name, and encountered the strangerâs wonderful
eyes with a gleam of amusement in them.

Bedingfield, who had mounted in the interval,
now rode up, and the little adventure had to
be explained to him. He, seeing only ready
courage and dexterity in the conduct of the
new-comer, was cordial in his thanks, and even
permitted this strange person to ride back with
the party toward Kimbolton. This seemed to
be the opportunity that the little man desired,
and he was soon engaged in earnest conversation
with Sir Edmund. So entertaining did
he make himself that Bedingfield, to Bettyâs
surprise, invited him to come in to rest when
they reached the castle. Usually, all visitors
underwent a severe scrutiny on account of the
presence of the queen, but this stranger seemed
[63]

to have overcome the castellanâs scruples and
the piebald horse was led to the stables, while
the rider, smaller than ever now he was dismounted,
followed Sir Edmund into the hall.
Bettyâs mind still rankling with the belief that
her horse had been cut with the whip of the
piebaldâs master, and her curiosity piqued by
the little manâs appearance, she asked the
woman with her if she had ever seen him
before. They were going up the stairs from
the hall, Sir Edmund and his guest standing
by the table below, and at the question the
woman, a servant at Kimbolton, drew nearer
and plucked her dress with nervous fingers.

âHist, mistress!â she exclaimed in a low
tone, âhis ears are long. I have seen him but
once before, but I know him full well; it is
the famous wizard.â

âA wizard! that little bandy-legged man a
wizard?â Betty cried, amazed.

âHush!â said the woman, her dull face full
of fear, âhe reads your thoughts, he sees
visions. âTis said that he did see, in a dream,
Richard Rouse put the poison in my lord of
Rochesterâs bran meal at Lambeth Marsh, and
that he had warned Richard, seven years before,
that he would be boiled alive at Smithfield, as
he was. I would not offend that little gentleman
[64]

in the russet cloak for a kingdom; no, not
I! They do say that his piebald horse was a
good bay, until he waved a striped wand over
him, at which the horse sneezed three times
and eftsoons came out white with three bay
spots upon him. âTis my belief that this same
wizard is allied with Satan, and so think many
honest folk. Avoid him, mistress, and you
love your life!â

[65]

CHAPTER VI

THE WIZARDâS VISIT

In
their gloomy rooms Queen Catherine and
her maids sat working when Mistress Betty
entered, rosy from her ride and the excitement
of her adventure, which promised now to be of
some interest. The queen, glancing up at her
entrance, caught the glow in the new-comerâs
face and smiled more pleasantly than usual.

âHow wonderfully freedom and exercise
affect young blood!â she said; âthe wench is
blooming as a Christmas rose. Come hither,
my girl, and tell us of your ride; perchance it
may seem like the recital of a chapter of wild
adventures to us. Youth and hope see all
things in a golden light; what knight rode
at your bridle rein? what dragon was slain
at your approach? Such faces as yours open
new channels of chivalry in the hearts of
men. Saw you not some marvel that may
serve to cheer us in our solitude?â

âNay, madam,â Betty replied, smiling, âI
met with no such wonders; but I did see a
wizard riding on a piebald horse.â

[66]
âA wizard on a piebald horse?â repeated
Catherine; ââtis well, so you saw not Death
riding on a white one, as they say my lord of
Buckingham did once. How knew you the
gentleman for a wizard? Did he carry the symbols
of his trade displayed, or had he a terrible
learned countenance that confounded all men
at the view?â

âYour grace should see what a small, bandy-legged
creature it is, much like a frog,â said
Mistress Carew, âonly that he wears russet
instead of green, and has a smooth tongue, so
that even now he wins the regard of Sir
Edmund.â

âWhat, is he here?â exclaimed the queen,
in surprise; âI knew not that Bedingfield
would admit any one without the warrant of
my lord privy seal; surely, Cromwell hath not
sent a sorcerer to conjure me,â she added with
an ironical laugh.

âRode he a piebald horse?â asked Patience,
the queenâs woman; âI think I cannot mistake
the man.â

âA piebald horse, surely,â answered Betty
Carew, âand he is clad in russet from top to
toe; his cloak is of velvet, but his doublet, I
think, was no more than sarsenet, and he wears
one straight black feather in the front of his
[67]

low hat. His eyes are brightâthe brightest
that I ever sawâand he has a pointed gray
beard, after the fashion of the Spaniards. I
noticed, too, that his eyebrows were arched up
sharply, almost in a point, which gave him a
strange look, like an owl.â

ââTis Zachary Sanders,â exclaimed Patience.
âYour highness does remember, surely; âtis
he who made the wonderful ring for my lord
cardinal and sent the scroll of her horoscope to
the Princess Mary.â

âI do seem to remember,â the queen said
musingly, âbut it is strange I do. Like a
great sea, raging and terrible, the waters of
Marah have overwhelmed me, sweeping on
every side in a mighty torrent, carrying away
all my strong friends and steadfast helpers. As
the ocean, overflowing its borders, sweeps high
upon the land, and when its tide recedes,
carries away all the habitations that man has
built upon the sand, and there is no remnant
left thereof to tell the tale of the disaster, so
the tide of my sorrow hath carried all things
from my memory, stripping the beach of my
mind and leaving only wreckage where once
were lovely mansions of thought and fancy.
Yet, as the saints bear witness, I did build my
hope upon rock and looked steadfastly for its
[68]

fulfilment. Alas, alas!â she added, tears
shining in her eyes, âthe tides have beaten on
it, and only the sure anchor of my hope in
heaven doth endure.â

âNay, nay, madam,â her woman cried, âspeak
not so disconsolately; the emperor bears up
your just quarrel, and the new pope has
declared for your cause. Look rather at the
good hope you have in the love your people
bear you and your fair daughter, the Princess
Mary.â

Catherine roused herself, her weakness had
been but momentary, and she regained her
composure almost as quickly as she had lost it.

âIt is for the Princess Mary that I live,â she
said quietly; âin my good daughter I have an
assured comfort.â

ââTwas the horoscope of the princess that
this wizard cast, who is now below,â her
attendant said. âI should like to have your
majesty see him; he would furnish much entertainment
for an hour on such an evening as
this.â The good woman was eager to change
the drift of Catherineâs thoughts.

The queen smiled as she turned to Betty.

âWhat say you, maiden?â she asked;
âwould this marvellous little man divert my
poor girls for an hour?â

[69]
âI cannot tell,â Betty answered soberly, for
she was touched at the queenâs emotionâCatherineâs
habitual coldness was repulsive,
but in such moments of sorrow she was more
attractive; ââtis certain that he furnished me
with ten minutes of sharp entertainment this
noon,â and she told them briefly of the wild
gallop of the wizard and her own misadventure.

âWe must see this fiery horseman, if Bedingfield
will let us,â said the queen when she
had heard the story; âsee, my maids, how
obedient I grow from force of habit! If her
jailer wills it, the Queen of England would
see a travelling wizard for an hour of wild
diversion. Forsooth, âtwill cast in shadow
the jousts at Greenwich in honor of the Marchioness
of Pembroke! Go you, Mistress
Carew, for you are in favor, and pray Sir
Edmund to send this fortune-teller to us.â

Thus admonished, Betty went upon the
errand with alacrity, glad to escape from the
sadness that the queenâs mood had cast upon
the scene, and moved, too, by a young girlâs
curiosity which had been awakened by the
reports of the wizard. She found Bedingfield
still entertaining the small stranger, and preferred
Catherineâs suit with some hesitation
on account of his presence. Sir Edmundâs
[70]

face clouded a little at the proposition and he
stood a few moments staring moodily at the
floor. Betty, standing at a short distance,
observed the two with interested eyes. The
wizard had fastened his gaze on his companionâs
face as soon as Betty told her errand
and watched him much as a cat watches a
mouse, but there was no expression on his
small and wizened countenance to indicate his
feelings. He was sitting on a low settle,
his short legs drawn under it and his chin
resting in his hands; something in his gray
hair and dull skin, his brown clothing and
diminutive size, gave him the appearance of
some hobgoblin of fairy lore. Bedingfield was
manifestly puzzled; the queenâs request was
simple and natural enough, and there seemed
no reasonable excuse for denying it, yet Sir
Edmund was uneasy. There was something
about the wizard which indicated a keen wit
and no ordinary energy of purpose, and Bedingfield
knew that there were dealings with Rome
and Spain,âdealings that Cromwell and the
king desired to break off,âand here was a
stranger who might be bent on mischief, yet
there was no reasonable excuse to refuse him
admittance to the queenâs presence. The fact
that he had not petitioned for it was in his
[71]

favor and Bedingfield knew well enough that
the poor women in his charge were sadly in
need of some small diversion. Catherine had
done wisely to choose Betty Carew for her messenger;
the wistful expression on the young
girlâs fresh face went far toward prevailing
with Sir Edmund. After a few moments of
hesitation, he despatched one of his own gentlemen
with the wizard, to conduct him to the
queen and remain in attendance during the
interview, at the same time bidding Betty go
before to warn the little court that the request
was granted.

Mistress Carew sped on her errand with the
swift feet of youth, and before the wizard and
his escort had reached the top of the stair, she
had entered the queenâs room. As she lifted
the curtain at the door, something in the scene
within arrested her attention. Catherine sat
more erect than usual, and her three maids were
gathered about her talking in low tones; there
was an animation in their looks so unusual
that Betty thought in an instant that there was
some new interest in the air, some scheme
afoot. At the sight of her, however, the
habitual expressions came back to their faces,
and Catherine received her announcement with
her usual manner.

[72]
âI have no royal robes to assume,â she said,
in a tone of bitterness, âbut truly there must
be some state with which to hold our levee.
Come, my girls, stand around me, arrange the
log upon the hearth, move yonder fire-screen;
the Queen of England will receive the wizard
Sanders!â

âMadam, the jest is bitter,â replied Patience,
sadly; âspare usâwho so bemoan your caseâthe
sharp edge of your wit, whereby the loss
of your high estate is in no manner redeemed.
You are still our gracious sovereign lady, and
so would be were you an outcast from this
realm which hath so uncharitably used you.â

âI thank you, wench,â Catherine replied,
her face softening at the expression of her
attendantâs devotion; âyou teach the queen to
bear herself more worthily. Ah, good Patience,
you know not how deep the wound corrodes my
lonely heart. Albeit a queen, and the daughter
of a king, I am yet a woman, and a womanâs
heart doth crave a little tenderness,âa little
love,âa little shelter, or else, God wot, it
starves!â

All her attendants drew nearer to her chair,
and tears shone in their eyes; the touch of
womanly weakness in the cold character of the
injured princess appealed to them more sharply
[73]

because of its contrast with her habitual austerity.
Catherine pressed her handkerchief to her
own eyes, and there was a painful silence,
broken only by the sound of footsteps at the
door and the voice of the usher announcing the
entrance of the wizard. At this interruption
the queen was herself in a moment, and
received the visitor with her usual cold
dignity.

The scene was a strange one; the fire was
burning low on the hearth, but a bright glow
shone from the bed of fiery embers in which
the fallen log lay smouldering. The room, a
large and gloomy one, was hung with dark
tapestries, which increased the somber effect,
and it was only imperfectly lighted by the
narrow windows at the farther end. In her
great chair by the chimney sat the queen clad
in black, and her hair entirely concealed by
her velvet cap. Around her were grouped her
four ladies, Betty Carew alone blooming with
youth and beauty in this sad place. Into this
little company of women came now the small,
strange figure of the man who called himself
Zachary Sanders, the most famous wizard in
the south of England. He still wore his russet
cloak, fastened by a clasp and chain that had
been loosened so the mantle hung behind, only
[74]

kept from slipping off his shoulders by the
chain. His jacket and doublet were of russet-colored
sarsenet, and he wore no ornament but
a curiously wrought silver serpent, which was
secured below his collar and hung on his
breast. Without his hat he was a far more
notable person than with it, for he had a large
and finely developed head, the sphere of the
brain well arched and full and with no ugly
slant of the forehead, and not too protuberant
behind, but with a fine line from the nape of
the neck to the crown. His owlish eyebrows
and pointed gray beard and mustache gave a
slightly sinister cast to his features, but his
eyes were so remarkable, both for size and
brilliancy, that all else sank into insignificance
by contrast. He came forward with an ease
that indicated a person accustomed to encountering
people of all ranks in life, one who
was as little likely to be amazed at magnificence
as he would be touched by distress. He
made a profound obeisance to the queen, and
she held out her hand, prompted, perhaps, by
the thought that she could not afford to lose a
friend, however humble. He knelt on one
knee and kissed it with an apparently sincere
feeling of homage.

âI have heard of you many times, sir,â said
[75]

Catherine, gravely, âand my women were
eager to have some entertainment and instruction.
Doubtless they would look curiously
into the future, fancying great things in store.
I pray you gratify their innocent desires, if
you may; for my part, such prognostications
are of little comfort. Having encountered so
great disasters, I do dread to look beyond the
hour; for me such dreams are done.â

âYet it should not be so, your grace,â the
wizard answered, regarding the queen earnestly;
âyour horoscope hath no such evil
ending to it.â

âYou flatter me, good Sanders,â she replied
bitterly; âI am no longer young enough to be
deceived by such follies. Here is a maid
whose fortune should smile like her face,â she
added, pointing to Mistress Betty, who stood
near her; âyour arts should weave a tale of
love and happiness for youth and beauty.â

âI cast her horoscope this noon at the Blue
Boar,â the wizard said, with a queer smile.
âVenus was in fortunate conjunction with
Mars when Mistress Carew was born.â

âDid you learn that by striking my horse,
Master Sanders?â Betty retorted, with a
mischievous glance from under her black
lashes.

[76]
The astrologer looked at her with an immovable
face.

âYou are mistaken,â he said calmly; âI
touched not the beast. It sometimes happens
that these dumb creatures recognize a power
more than human, and are so thrown into a
convulsion of terror.â

âWith your aid?â persisted the young girl,
laughing incredulously, and even the queen
smiled.

âMy young mistress is inclined to jest,â
Sanders remarked grimly, âand to make light
of my art, but this will not be so when she
talks to her affianced husband.â

âMy affianced husband!â exclaimed Betty,
with indignation; âyou are much in error in
good sooth, for I am not promised.â

The wizard looked at her and laughed, his
brilliant eyes almost fascinating the young
girlâs startled gaze.

âYou were promised in your cradle, and a
lovely mate you are like to get, Mistress
Carew,â he answered quietly, with such a
tone of certainty that Betty experienced a
sharp sensation of apprehension.

ââTis false!â she exclaimed passionately, her
agitation so genuine that the queen interposed.

âWhy fret the child, sir wizard?â Catherine
[77]

said; âwhat warrant have you for this
statement?â

Sanders turned to her with courteous respect,
although his face showed a certain malicious
enjoyment.

âWe read these matters in the stars, madam,â
he said gravely, âand they cannot mislead us.
Mistress Carew is promised to a tall, dark
man with a sword-cut across his left eyebrow;
one day she will find that the astrologer has
not lied.â

Seeing Bettyâs angry alarm, Catherine turned
the matter aside; she had the tact to avoid a
scene which was becoming unpleasant.

âYou claim that all your knowledge is from
the stars, sir?â she asked indifferently, âand
there is no human agency in the affair?â

âNone, madam,â the wizard rejoined
solemnly; âwe read the destinies of men and
women in the heavens, and the future even of
this realm unrolls itself in that great scroll for
the marvelling eye of the seer to read.â

The queen leaned back in her chair and
shaded her eyes with her hand.

âThe future of this realm!â she said in a
low voice; âI pray the saints for it! I, who
have never done England any good, would be
sorry indeed to do it harm.â

[78]
âYou need have no fear, madam,â the sage
rejoined, speaking as low as she, so that the
usher sent by Bedingfield, who was posted at
the door, could not catch their words.

Catherine looked up quickly.

âYou speak confidently,â she said; âwhy
so?â

âYour grace does well to ask,â he answered
gravely. âI have seen a vision, such an one
as no man sees but once or twice in a lifetime,
even though he is born to read the stars.â

âSpeak on,â said the queen, as he paused.

The little circle by the fire had drawn close,
all eager attention except Mistress Betty, who
stood apart, angry and secretly alarmed, although
she fought stoutly against the dread
which beset her. At the queenâs admonition,
the wizard drew nearer, and stood facing the
hearth, the red glow of the embers casting a
lurid light on his wizened figure and a fiery
glint in his great eyes. He did not seem to
see the others, but recited his tale like a man
in a trance.

ââTwas night,â he said, âand I was in my
laboratory studying the heavens. Mars was
red as blood. Suddenly, before me, there was
a wide ray of white light which constantly
expanded, until I saw in it a marvellous flower-garden,
[79]

a vast place, full of bloom and with
great gates, on which were emblazoned the
arms of England. Within, there was a tall
white rose upon a single stem, and it shone
lustrous. No one was in the garden, and without
were the pope, the Emperor of the Germans,
and the Queen of Hungary, while, closer to
the gate, stood your graceâs champion, Reginald
Pole. Presently I saw a woman walking
through the garden dressed in cloth of gold,
with a crown on her head, and on her robes
the arms of England and Spain united. She
came across the garden to the white rose, and
it bowed down to her; she plucked it, holding
it up and looking at Pole, and then I knew
her. After that, she touched the gates with
the white rose and they flew open, and those
without came in and kissed her. When she
kneeled to receive the popeâs blessing, I saw
her face plainly; it was the Princess Mary.â

When he ceased speaking, Catherine covered
her face with her hands; the superstition of
the age and her blood stirred within a naturally
strong woman. After a moment, she spoke
almost in a whisper.

âAnd the king?â she said.

âMadam, you know the northern prophecy,â
the wizard replied; âthe decorate rose shall be
[80]

slain in his motherâs womb,âwhich means
the death of one who hath offended. And
sheââthe speaker lowered his voice so that it
was scarcely more than a whisperââshe who
hath wrought this woe, her horoscope doth
show a sudden and a shameful death.â

âI pray it may be so!â exclaimed one of
the queenâs women; âmay a curse light on herâmayââ

âNay, curse her not,â interrupted Catherine,
coldly; âthe time is not far off when ye shall
have great reason to pity her, yea, to commiserate
her estate.â

âAy,â replied the wizard, âan agony awaits
herâa blood-red axe is in her destiny.â

This low-spoken conversation had irritated
the attendant sent by Bedingfield, and conscious
that to permit it to continue would be a
transgression of his orders, he came forward
now and reminded Sanders that he had exceeded
the limit of his visit. The queen resented the
interference, and turned as if to speak in
anger; but, on second thought, repented her
determination, only treating the matter with
her accustomed scorn.

âTell your master,â she said to the usher,
âthat the queen was so wonderfully entertained
that she forgot her usual obedience to his
[81]

orders and craves his pardon. Master Sanders,
I thank you for your diverting discourse,â she
added to the astrologer. âI am so poor I may
not even reward my entertainment; but continue,
sir, to read in the stars the salvation of
this realm, and so find your reward.â

The wizard made his obeisance and turned
to withdraw; as he did so, a tiny packet fell
from under his cloak, and Mistress Betty noted
that Patience set her foot upon it, making no
effort to restore it to its owner. When he
reached the door, Sanders turned for the last
time toward the queen, and making a strange
sign with his hands, bowed and withdrew.

[82]

CHAPTER VII

MISTRESS CAREWâS ALLEGIANCE

It
was dusk; the shadows were folding
thickly about the gloomy walls of Kimbolton.
In the queenâs drawing-room Betty Carew sat
alone, a solitary taper burning on the table
beside her, while she mechanically turned the
leaves of the illuminated missal, her thoughts
being far away. The queen had been ill for
some days; she was able to sit up, but kept
her own chamber. Below, in the apartments
of Bedingfield, were two gentlemen from the
privy council, and with them, as Betty knew,
the Marquis of Exeter. Something had happened;
what, the young girl scarcely divined.
The three visitors had arrived almost at daybreak,
and at noon there had been a stormy
interview in Catherineâs room, from which
Mistress Carew was excluded. After it was
over, the queen was in more distress than
Betty had ever seen her; she even wept,
and called passionately for her daughter,âan
unusual outbreak, followed by a season of
[83]

exhaustion. She was reported now to be
asleep, her three favorite attendants watching
her, while the youngest of all sat like an outcast
and a spy in the outer room. There had
been much secret dealing of late, Betty knew,
and she felt that they were careful to shut her
out, ever suspicious of her motives. That
day, she had heard Exeter remonstrate with
Bedingfield on the mean state of the household
and on the queenâs poor attendance; and Sir
Edmund replied that he must even obey his
orders, and that as for state, he had no money,
and the council allowed none to support the
princess dowager.

âPoor lady!â Exeter said, âthere is little
need of all this watch and ward; if I be not
mistaken, there cometh soon a guest which
no bars shall keep out and no privy council
examine.â

âAy, so it looks,â Bedingfield replied, âand
yet I know not; she hath been ailing long, but
seems to fight her malady as steadfastly as she
did the divorce.â

âA gallant heart,â my lord of Exeter replied,
âbut she will die. Her eye looks it and her
dull and yellowish hue betrays it. âTis no
place here either to stir the laggard blood
in her veins; she is a Spaniard, and this sharp
[84]

weather suits her as little as our northern
temperaments. The end of a great sorrow
draweth nigh.â

So spoke the marquis, and Betty, hearing
him, felt a chill at her heart. The gloomy life
had weighed upon her, and she fell often into
meditations which were full of dim foreboding.
The wizardâs tale had stolen into her brain
and found a lodgment there, and she dreaded
something, what she knew not. Youth is
fanciful, and sees either a flood of sunshine on
the path or a thick cloud. While the shadows
without lengthened into night, Betty sat alone;
and then there was a soft footfall behind her,
and Patience came to summon her to the
queen. Something in the womanâs face betrayed
that the call was unusual, and Mistress
Carew was yet more surprised when she found
herself alone with Catherine, who sat propped
up in her chair, a rosary in her hands and her
black mantilla shading her features even more
than usual. The lights were so arranged that
her face was in the gloom, and it was impossible
to see her expression.

âMy visitors are still below, as I hear, Mistress
Betty,â she said quietly, âand I would
ask you to do an errand for me. Here is a
little packet which, I pray you, give my lord
[85]

of Exeter from the queen. These gentlemen
will look askance at my own poor maids, but
you, my child, are in favor with the powers
that be.â

Betty stood a moment irresolute, her heart
beating high. The hour had come for her to
show herself worthy of her uncleâs confidence.
She could not deceive herself about the packet;
it was the same which the wizard had let fall
a few weeks before. She was silent, her eyes
downcast.

âWhat ails you, mistress?â cried the queen,
sharply; âhave you no tongue to answer me?â

âMadam,â replied Betty, her tone faltering
ever so slightly, âI may not disobey my
instructions.â

âYour instructions!â repeated Catherine,
sternly; âfrom whomâand when?â

Mistress Bettyâs cheek was scarlet. How
could she speak the truth to this injured
woman, although the truth was not to her own
discredit? Her embarrassment carried conviction
to the queenâs mind, and she was
passionately incensed.

âSo!â she said, in her coldest and most
sarcastic tone, âthe dove was but the serpent in
disguise. For shame! How could one so
young, so seeming innocent, become a tool in
[86]

the hands of villains? Had you no womanâs
heart that you could spy upon and betray a
womanâand she your queen? My God! the
very babes and sucklings are utterly corrupted,
vile traitors and heretics!â

âMadam,â Betty cried, with deep resentment,
âyou do me bitter wrong! I am no spy,
nor would my uncle have sent me to fill so foul
an office. I cannotânay, I will not carry
secret missives against my instructions! That
would be as deep a treason to this realm as it
would be to you did I purpose to betray you.â

âYou say âI will notâ to your queen?â
exclaimed Catherine, harshly; âthe saints bear
witness that the time was when so saucy a
tongue would have been treason. It is well to
make fine protests, wench, but âtwill be long
ere you find one so foolish as to credit them.â

âFor that there is no help, madam,â Betty
answered firmly. âI will even tell you the
whole truth; my uncle did forbid me to carry
any secret missives, or to meddle with these
matters, since he bade me remember that the
safety of this realm was a greater matter than
the sorrows of one woman, albeit she is a
queen.â

âIs a queen!â cried Catherine, catching at
the words; âthine uncle is a worthy manâan
[87]

honest man. I am still a queen, it seems,
despite the universities and Cranmer! Ah,
well, something remains, albeit I can be
insulted by a little wench like this one.â

âI do assure your grace,â Betty said, âthat I
am heartily sorry. I would gladly do any service
for your pleasure, but I owe also much to
my uncle; I would not lay his head in danger.â

The queen looked at her a moment in
silence; something in the sincerity of the
young girlâs tone touched her.

âIs it, then, so dangerous to serve the Queen
of England?â she asked in a strange voice.

âMadam, the Act of the Succession,â began
Betty; but Catherine cut her short.

âNay,â she said sharply, âspeak not of
these things; they poison me. Go, wench! I
have no need of youâsuch service is of little
pleasure to me.â

Angry, yet touched and wounded by the
queenâs reproaches, Betty moved to the door,
but there she paused long enough to speak
once more.

âI do beseech your grace to believe me,â
she said gently. âI would not harm a hair of
your royal headâI do indeed think that you
are despitefully used, the deepest sympathy for
your wrongs is in my heart.â

[88]
âI believe you, Mistress Carew,â the queen
replied, after a pause, âbut those that be not
with me are altogether against me. I am
weary; I pray you leave me. Though uncrowned,
I may claim so much obedience.
When you are older, my girl, and broken in
health and spirit, I pray no fairer face may
steal your husbandâs heart. My fate is not so
uncommon that it should isolate me; rather,
think I, there be many women in England who
should weep for me in very sympathy. A
manâs heart is like a ship which is ever prone
to slip its moorings; look well, mistress, when
you have one, that it is stoutly anchored.â

Deeply disturbed and unhappy, Betty Carew
left the queenâs room, and going into the gallery
beyond, walked to and fro. There was
something so desolate in Catherineâs situation,
and so merciless were her enemies, that few
women could have looked upon her with indifference,
and Bettyâs heart was not so cold as
to resist the appeal. She had often wavered
in her allegiance to the kingâs party since her
arrival at Kimbolton, and being young, was far
more likely to be led by her sympathies than
her reason. Had Catherine possessed in a
greater degree the powers of attraction, she
might have won the young girl wholly to her
[89]

wishes; but the unhappy queen was not rich in
natureâs gifts and her austerity was repellent,
while her proud reserve in some degree concealed
the depth of her own suffering.

Moved though Betty was, she could not bear
the packet to the marquis without deliberately
violating her pledges to her uncle; and bred as
she had been under the new influences of the
changed times, she had, too, a horror of meddling
with a matter which she knew involved
the safety of the realm, threatened, as it was,
with a multitude of dangers. While she
walked in the gallery, with a heart full of
varied emotions, she heard the trampling of
horses below, and running to the casement,
saw the three guests riding away, and knew
that, unless the queen had speedily found
another messenger, it was too late.

That night Catherine was very ill, or so her
maids gave out, and for two days afterwards no
one saw her but her physician and her three
chosen attendants. Mistress Betty was not
summoned, even to perform any small office,
and it touched her sharply to feel how deeply
she was distrusted; but after this, there was
no time for reflections, for events hurried one
upon another. The queenâs condition could
not be concealed, and reluctant as her personal
[90]

attendants were to hold intercourse with the
royal officers of the household, Bedingfield was
notified of the danger in which she lay.

On New Yearâs Day, at about six oâclock,
came the queenâs Spanish maid of honor, Lady
Willoughby, who had been Donna Maria de
Salines. Bedingfield would have refused her
admittance, since she had no warrant from the
king, but she pleaded with such eloquence the
cold and her fatigue that she finally gained
her will. Once with Catherine, the Spanish
woman never left her, but administered to her
comfort to the end. The day after her arrival
came also Capucius, the emperorâs ambassador,
bearing, however, the kingâs permission, though
he was not allowed to see the dying queen save
in the presence of the royal chamberlain.
Bedingfieldâs vigilance was defeated, however,
for Catherine and Capucius spoke to each
other in Spanish, a language which the royal
officer understood as little as Hebrew.

Like a gloomy pageant, scene followed scene
in this sorrowful drama. The weeping maid of
honor, the stately ambassador, the laments of
the poor, whom Catherine had ever treated
with sympathy and kindness,âall these things
made a sad impression on the young girl, who
was a reluctant witness of the gloomy closing
[91]

of a tragic life, nor was she to escape without
one more trial. It was after Lady Willoughbyâs
arrival, and Catherine being very low,
every member of the household shared in the
service of attendance. Although she had been
tacitly exiled from the queenâs presence, Betty
was now called upon to go to her apartment, and,
Catherineâs attention being attracted by her
entrance, she called her to her bedside. The
queenâs voice was firm, although her face bore
the unmistakable signs of approaching death.

âCome hither, Mistress Carew,â she said;
and as Betty obeyed her summons, she turned
to Lady Willoughby, who stood on the other
side.

âMaria,â she said, âmark you this maid?
She is likely to go to court; will she not outshine
some stars at Windsor?â

Lady Willoughby glanced in surprise from
the queenâs face to Bettyâs, and doubtless
thinking her royal mistress wandering in mind,
replied gently that the maiden was fair enough
surely to shine in any court.

âHark you, my girl,â Catherine said to
Betty, a rigid sternness in her face, âI die the
Queen of England, the true and lawful wife of
the kingâs grace. Forget it not.â

She paused, and there was no response.
[92]

Betty Carew, standing beside her with tears in
her eyes, had no words to answer her, and, like
Lady Willoughby, believed that her mind
wandered.

âKneel down,â said the queen, solemnly;
and both Betty and Donna Maria mechanically
obeyed. The room was still, a dim light crept
in at the windows, the tapers flared behind the
dark canopy of the bed. The attendants stood
back in the shadows. Catherine raised herself
a little on her pillows and lifted her hands,
clasping them before her; her eyes shone with
a strange luster in the deadly whiteness of her
face.

âHis holiness the pope,â she said in a clear
voice, âhath declared my marriage valid. I
am the wife of Henry, King of England. I do
call upon you all to witness; this maid also,
who is not of us,âI die the queen! And I do
solemnly charge you, at the peril of your souls,
to bear in mind that the king has one true and
legitimate daughter, the Lady Mary, Princess
Royal of England and heiress to the throne.â

She remained a moment with her hands
lifted, her face growing more rigid. There
was the sound of suppressed sobbing in the
room. The queenâs arms fell heavily and she
sank back in a deathlike swoon.

[93]

CHAPTER VIII

THE KINGâS MESSENGERS

The
seventh of January had passed, the
Queen of England had been carried to her
last resting-place at Peterborough Abbey, and
that other Queen of England rejoiced at Greenwich.
The knot in the affairs of state, which
had set emperor and king and pope at variance,
was severed. The unhappy woman, whose
troubles had shaken a throne, would henceforth
seek only the crown immortal. She was
gone, and the winter sunlight shone brightly
on the walls of Kimbolton, as if to exorcise
the phantoms of that sorrow which had broken
a royal heart. Within, there was desolation in
those rooms where the queen had held her
little levees, and which now seemed peopled
with ghosts. The long story of her passionate
struggle to maintain her own and her daughterâs
claims seemed written upon the walls. Every
footstep echoed sadly in the vacant galleries,
every corner was full of shadows. Doors stood
open, articles of wearing apparel, bits of
[94]

unfinished embroidery lay on the floor, tapers
that had burned low and sputtered in the
sockets left a forlorn remnant of congealed wax
upon the candlesticks; the great hearths were
gray with ashes and the dead logs had fallen
from the fire-dogs. The chill wind swept
down the chimneys, roared and moaned at the
casements, shrieking around the castle as if to
tear its way within and sweep away the last
vestige of the dead womanâs presence. She
had died like a queen, calmly and with unfaltering
courage; even in death her claim to
royalty remained, and here it was recognized;
no man at Kimbolton thought of her save as
the queen.

Her household was on the point of dissolution.
The kingâs messengers had come down
from London,âthe crown lawyer, Dr. Rich,
some gentlemen of the Privy Council, Sir
William Carew and Master Simon Raby,âand
there followed much stir and excitement.
Catherineâs effects were being examined, her
maids separated, her servants discharged.
The royal officers were busied with many
matters and were peremptory and exacting;
messengers ran to and fro, the courtyard was
full of horses, the hall crowded with attendants.
There was all the bustle attendant upon the
[95]

final breaking up of such an establishment.
On one side were the pale and sorrowful faces
of the late queenâs personal followers, who
sincerely mourned the loss of a good and charitable
mistress; on the other were the hard,
shrewd countenances of the kingâs commissioners,
intent only on fulfilling an unpleasant
duty, and not a little relieved that the cause
of so much dissension, and such a menace to
the peace of the realm, was finally removed.
It was a curious scene, and one to teach a
lesson in the futility of all earthly ambitions,
the fleeting pride of all worldly honors.

In a window recess of the hall stood Mistress
Carew, cloaked and muffled for a journey, and
at her side was Master Raby. The two stood
looking down into the crowded court and talking
in low tones. She was to ride with her uncle
to Greenwich upon some errand,âwhat she
knew not, but she had much curiosity to learn,
nursing a hope that she was to have a glimpse
of the court. However, she kept her own
counsel, and listened with a serious face to the
talk of her companion.

âThis matter has been a grief to the kingâs
grace,â he said, speaking too low for any ears
but those of his fair auditor; âI would not
have believed that he could be so moved thereat.
[96]

âTis said that when he read her last letter,
he wept and lamented her.â

âDo men always weep so late?â asked
Mistress Betty, coldly, her bright eyes turning
scornfully upon the speaker; âforsooth, sir, I
would rather be treated with more kindness
while I lived than so lamented in death.â

Master Raby was taken by surprise. The
sudden sharpness of her tone, her expressive
glance, came after a passive attitude of
attention.

âAnd so would I,â he said heartily; âyet
surely, mistress, a late repentance is better
than none.â

âI would have none of it,â retorted his companion,
with disdain; âhad I been treated like
this queen, I would never have written so loving
a letter to the king, no, not I! Poor lady!
she was too meek, or, perhaps, too good a Christian.
A little more spirit would have made
him mend his ways in time. I do think that
never was a woman who deserved more pity.â

âThere are some who would call your speech
treasonable, Mistress Carew,â Raby said, but
his eyes were full of amusement as he looked
at the flushed, angry face before him; âspeak
not too warmly in this ladyâs cause before
other witnesses, I pray you.â

[97]
âSir, she was hardly used,â declared Betty,
stoutly; âI would say so if you were the kingâs
highness.â

âAnd if you said it with that tone and look,
I do wager he would pardon you,â exclaimed
the other, smiling; âindeed, I believe the
king has known some hours of regret. At
least, he has ordered the court into deep
mourning; but the queenââ Raby shrugged
his shoulders and laughed.

âQueen Anne Boleyn? What of her?â
asked the young girl, a certain scorn in her
fresh voice.

âQueen Anne and all her ladies are wearing
yellow,â Raby said, âand a curious spectacle
it is. They do say she has remarked that
she only regretted that the Lady Catherine
made so good an end.â

ââTis a shame,â cried Betty; âshe is but a
harlequin to dress so. This queen was a good
woman, and so deserves all respect.â

âIt is reported that she plotted with the
Spaniards against this realm,â remarked her
companion, watching her face.

Mistress Betty flushed rose-red; the thought
of the hidden packet came to her mind. This
charge she could neither parry nor deny, but
her pity for the dead woman outlived her horror
[98]

of treasonable practices. She lifted her head
haughtily.

âAnd so would I, if I had been born a
Spaniard and so suffered at the hands of the
English,â she declared; âit was only human.â

At this Master Raby laughed outright. The
dead queenâs champion was irresistible in her
youth and beauty and that fearlessness which
was her birthright. He drew her out, delighted
at the frankness and spirit of her
speech; he was a courtier, sated, too, with the
follies and the pleasures of that gilded life, a
much admired gallant, a favorite with the
ladies of Queen Anne, but here was a fresh
experience and he found it irresistible. Meanwhile,
Mistress Betty, whose nature was cast
in a sharper outline, who saw things with the
uncompromising eyes of youth, scarcely detected
his enjoyment of the little dialogue.

âTruly, it would be dangerous to offend you,
Mistress Carew,â he said, still laughing softly;
âbut take you no thought of that other aspect
of the affair? The peril to the state, the sharp
necessity of loyalty when the kingdom is in
peril, and the Bishop of Rome would bring us
all to disaster if he could. Has he not caused
his bulls to be nailed up on every church door
in Flanders, and held us up as a legitimate prey
[99]

for the faithful? Was it not wrong for this
princess who had been a queen of England to
desire the desolation of this realm?â

Betty stood a moment thinking, biting her
lip and pressing her hands together. After a
moment she looked up into Master Rabyâs
amused eyes, and her cheeks burned.

âI believe that I should have done worse,â
she cried, âif any one had dared to so insult
me.â

âHappily, Mistress Carew, no man would
ever attempt it,â said her companion, softly;
âyour face is too fair to be so soon forgotten.
This poor lady was older than the king and
never handsome, nor did his grace ever love
her.â

âMore shame to him!â said Betty, sharply;
âshe was his wife.â

Master Raby laughed again. âAh, Mistress
Carew,â he said, âyou must talk with my lord
of Canterbury! Must a man love a woman
because she is his wife?â

Betty gave him a swift, sidelong glance.
âSir,â she said demurely, âI know nothing of
a manâs heart, but I have heard that it is like
a mirror and reflects every face that looks in
it, only that, unlike a mirror, you may never
break it.â

[100]
âYou are young to be so cruel,â her companion
cried, delighted, âand verily, mistress,
you will find many hearts do break before you
make one blest.â

âYou are a courtier, Master Raby,â she
replied, âand have a readier wit than mine, but
you can never make me admire the woman who
broke this good queenâs heart.â

âNay,â he answered softly, âit is you, fair
Mistress Betty, who will make me do your
bidding, not I you.â

At this, she blushed the color of a fresh
June rose, being as yet unused to fine speeches,
and Master Raby stood looking at her, thinking
her fairer than any beauty of the court,
when Sir William Carew came up and cut the
conversation short.

âCome, niece,â he said briefly, âwe ride at
once. And you, Raby, will you bear us company
or no?â

âI thank you, yes, Sir William,â he replied
with alacrity; âall is in readiness; the horses
at the door, and my man, whom you admired
so much, in attendance.â

âThe knave will hang,â rejoined Carew,
grimly. âCome, Betty, there is no time for
fine speeches or farewells. I must set out for
Greenwich without delay, and you go with me.â

[101]
âWhither, uncle?â said Betty, quickly;
âsurely not to the court?â

âAnd wherefore surely not?â asked Sir
William, testily.

âI know not what you will do with me
there,â his niece said softly.

âYou go to the queenâs grace, my girl,â
Carew replied grimly, âif she will have you.â

Master Raby smiled and glanced at Betty.

ââTis come, Mistress Carew,â he whispered,
as he helped her to the saddle. âI pray thee
tell the king thy mind.â

âAnd so I will, if he asks me, Master
Raby,â declared Betty, with spirit, âand,
mayhap, it will do him good. A bitter truth
is ofttimes wholesome medicine.â

[102]

CHAPTER IX

THE MAN WITH A SCAR

It
was a cold and dreary night in London,
and through the mist the lights of the inn
blinked like great yellow eyes. Within the
public room there was much jovial entertainment.
It was well filled with guests, some
drinking, others playing at dice, and a few
eating belated suppers. It was an establishment
much patronized by men of fashion, and
the assembly was of a less motley character
than that of most public houses. Two or three
young gentlemen in velvets and satins, with
ruffs of fine lace and jewel-hilted weapons,
threw dice at one table, while at another sat a
stately personage in black velvet, perusing
some parchments with the assistance of a
shrewd-faced, deferential companion, the one
having the appearance of an eminent jurist and
the other being, no doubt, his clerk. At yet
another table sat some travellers, whose fur-trimmed
garments and full wallets suggested
wealthy merchants. Mine host bustled about
with a rubicund and smiling countenance,
[103]

attended by several servants and a rosy-faced
Hebe bearing the wine cups and glasses. The
innkeeper had the air of one who felt his
pockets filling and his reputation growing at
the same moment; a state of bliss seldom
attained except by those who minister to the
inner man, the way to a manâs purse, as well as
to his heart, being through his stomach. There
was a buzz of conversation, the rattle of dice,
the click of glasses, but it was yet too early
for the potations to take effect, and there was
perfect decorum upon all sides.

Beyond this room, which was for public
entertainment, there was a smaller one, opening
into it by a low door, in one panel of which
was a little window, a mere aperture, and
through this the occupant of the private apartment
might survey the outer room with slight
risk of being discovered,âa convenient peep-hole,
where mine host could spy upon his
guests at pleasure. It was a small place and
nearly filled by a table and two chairs. On
opposite sides of this table were seated now
two men engaged in earnest conversation.
The tapers burning between them shed their
light on the faces of both. To the right sat a
little man clad in a russet cloak, the wizard
Sanders; on the left, was quite a different
[104]

person. The stranger was tall and well made,
fully forty years of age, and with a face that,
while it was handsome in a coarse, bold fashion,
was also rather sinister in expression, and with
a sensual mouth and chin. He was very dark,
his hair, already touched with gray on the
temples, accentuating the olive tint of his complexion,
and his eyes being light gray, the
effect was not altogether pleasing. Yet his
features were fine and only marred by the scar
of a sword-cut, which almost obliterated his
left eyebrow. His dress was of the richest,
his cloak covered with gold embroidery, and
the green satin doublet slashed with white
brocade, while his hands, white and soft as a
womanâs, were jewelled. His embroidered
gloves lay on the table beside his rapier, the
hilt of which was beautiful in workmanship
and glistened with precious stones. He sat
with his elbow on the table, leaning his head
upon his hand and listening to the wizard, who
was speaking in low tones, though no ear could
hear him but his companionâs.

âThe trump card is gone,â he said calmly,
his keen eyes watching the other narrowly,
âbut we have yet the Lady Mary.â

âTush!â ejaculated his friend, âwhat of
that? âTis said the king may have a boy.â

[105]
The wizard shook his head with a slow
smile.

âNever,â he said composedly. âHenry has
ill luck with his men children. This gay lady
is falling out of favor, too; another star riseth
yonder.â

âAy, so they say,â retorted the other,
gloomily; âbut the change is like to bring us
small comfort, if it comes. We shall have no
merry time until we get the base blood out
of the council; yonder hell-hound tracks us by
the scent. I would he were begging again at
the door of Master Friskyball.â

âLook you, Sir Barton,â rejoined the wizard,
âmy lord privy seal is more like to pull you by
the pate than you him;â and Sanders laughed
with wicked amusement as he eyed his listener.
âBear in mind the fate of Ap Ryce, and be not
too forward. Cromwell is beating the bush
for traitors, and if he finds you,â again the
little man laughed unpleasantly, âa short
shrift and your head would grin on London
Bridge.â

âAnd if it does, why, curse you, so shall
yours, you evil spirit!â Sir Barton cried with
a fierce outbreak of temper, the mocking tone
of Sanders having struck him like a goad.

âPshaw!â retorted the wizard, coolly, âwhy
[106]

fall out so swiftly? I do not fear you, man, or
any one. Think you I am so great a fool as to
play this game and lose? Who was it that
dealt secretly with the Nun of Kent?â

He was watching the other with malicious
enjoyment; noting the start of amazement and
fear, he leaned back and laughed with a fiendish
delight that enraged the dark man still more.

âYou are a fiend!â Sir Barton said between
his set teeth. âI tell you, Sanders,
if you betray me, I will send you to the devil
before you can grin that hellish grin of yours
twice.â

Undaunted either by the threats or the
furious aspect of the man, the little wizard
laughed with apparently intense amusement.

âCome, come, Sir Barton,â he said mockingly,
âsit, man; âtis not in your horoscope
that you should murder me. I find you useful,â
he added in a changed tone, âand you, I
believe, have found me so. Waste no more
threats upon me; I fear you as little as the
snake that I keep in my chamber, and whose
fangs I drew long since, although he is still
excellent to scare women and children. Save
your excessive fury until such time as the
Spaniards and the Irish come to set my Lady
Mary on the throne, when we shall live right
[107]

merrily again and this same king shall die as
did the man-queller Richard.â

âIf we die not first and rot for our part in
it,â retorted his companion, sullenly, having
recovered his composure.

âYou are not wont to be so downcast, Sir
Barton,â the astrologer remarked, ânor need
be. Cromwellâs new notion of parish registers
is working for us among the vulgar; they
believe it but a design to find the means of
taxing them, and that they shall no longer eat
white meat or fowls without paying dues to
the kingâs grace. More than half this realm
is with us; and of the peers, from his grace of
Norfolk down, I think they love not the new
order of things, nor do they like the rule of
the cloth-shearerâs son.â

âAy,â replied his companion, âwe are like
to have Lord Hussey and Darcy, besides the
Nevilles and the faction of the White Rose.
âTis certain we can raise the northern counties
when the time is ripe, and then, the devil take
me if I be not the first to thrust a sword in
Cromwellâs belly!â He rose as he spoke and
took up his weapon, handling it as if he loved
the thought of the use for which he intended it.

âThe devil is very like to have thee, friend,â
retorted the wizard, smiling; âbut hark! what
[108]

stir is that without? Some new-comers are in
the courtyard.â

Sir Barton walked to the door, and pushing
back the slide which had closed the window in
the panel, he looked into the public room.

âIt is a party of travellers,â he said carelessly;
and then changing his tone, ââtis Sir
William Carew of Mohunâs Ottery, that young
coxcomb Raby, and a womanâa handsome one
at that,â he added with an oath.

The wizard, who was watching him as a cat
watches a mouse, smiled maliciously.

âIs it a young maid?â he asked, âtall and
fine-shaped as Diana, with red cheeks and
great brown eyes that sparkle and change at
every glance, and with hair like the ravenâs
wing?â

âYou have made a fair description,â the tall
man replied, âbut, by heaven, you cannot do
her justice! She is muffled up, but I saw her
face as she came in, and sheâs a beauty.â

The wizard laughed again so wickedly that
Sir Barton turned on him.

âThou grinning devil!â he said; âwhat is
sticking in thy gullet?â

ââTis retribution, sir,â Sanders said coolly;
âyou discarded a penniless betrothed. Penniless
she is, but marvellous fair.â

[109]
An expression of amazement tinged with
superstitious dread came over his companionâs
face.

âHow in the fiendâs name do you track men
out?â he asked.

The wizard pointed upward. âThe stars,
noble sir,â he answered meekly; âmy poor
art.â

âWho is this beauty?â Sir Barton demanded
sharply; âyou know well enough.â

âAy, I know,â replied Sanders, calmly;
âno velvet-tempered kitten, either. âTis Sir
Williamâs niece, the daughter of that rake, Sir
Thomas.â

Sir Barton, uttering an exclamation of profane
surprise, opened the door and walked into
the public room, leaving the wizard alone in
the little closet.

Sir William Carew was talking with the
host, while in a retired corner, near the entrance,
stood Mistress Betty, and beside her,
Master Raby. The young girlâs mantle was
muffled about her shoulders, but her hood had
fallen back a little, revealing enough of the
face beneath to draw the attention of many of
the guests. But she was so busily engaged in
talking to her companion that she was unconscious
of the admiring glances cast in her
[110]

direction. A servant had brought some hot
drinks for the party and would have set a table
for them, but this Sir William refused, saying
that he was pressed for time. Sir Barton
walked up to him, to be received in no very
friendly fashion, Carewâs greeting indicating
plainly that he desired no company upon the
road. After an ineffectual attempt at conversation,
the other drew back haughtily, but
stood watching Mistress Betty, until the persistency
of his gaze attracted the attention of
her cavalier, who moved between, giving the
offender a hard glance that was intended to
teach him better manners. It was returned in
kind, the two men looking defiance at each
other over the heads of those who sat at the
tables. In a few moments, however, Sir
William led his party out again to resume
their journey. As Raby helped Betty into the
saddle, he saw the tall man standing on the
threshold of the inn.

âYour uncleâs friend must needs follow
still, Mistress Carew,â he remarked; âthe
impudent knave never took his eyes from your
face; he deserves chastisement.â

Betty laughed softly. âNay, sir,â she said
in an amused tone, âsurely the curiosity of a
stranger is no great offence.â

[111]
âI should be the happier for laying my sword
across his shoulders, for all that,â retorted her
companion.

The young girl glanced at the dark figure on
the threshold with new interest; she was not
without enjoyment of the admiration that she
was beginning to receive. One of the stable-boys
came running with a lighted torch to
help Sir William to adjust his saddle. Master
Raby bent forward and took Bettyâs bridle rein.

âLet me guide thy beast, Mistress Carew,â
he said.

But she heard him not. The light of the
torch flared full on the figure in the door.
Even through the mist, which hung between
like a thin veil, she saw the glittering dress,
the dark face, and the scar across the left eyebrow.

A moment afterwards, Carewâs party rode
out of the yard.

âUncle, uncle,â cried Mistress Betty, in a
strange voice, âwho was yonder dark man that
spoke with you?â

ââTwas Henge, Sir Barton Henge,â said
Carew; âbut what is that to thee, wench?â

[112]

CHAPTER X

MISTRESS BETTY GOES TO COURT

It
was an hour before noon and the gates of
Greenwich palace stood open. A crowd of
attendants and gentlemen ushers were assembled
in the anterooms, and the royal guards
lined the halls. The king and queen were
holding a levee, and, as usual, there was a
great concourse of people, and the river was
dotted with barges, wherries and all sorts of
water-craft.

Sir William Carew had just landed at the
water-stairs, opposite the main entrance, and
was helping his niece to alight from the boat.
They were accompanied by Simon Raby, and
all three were dressed in the elaborate fashion
of the court. Sir Williamâs suit was of richer
hue and finer velvet than that which he had
worn upon the road; his cloak was shorter and
more gayly lined, while his ruffles were of the
finest lace. The younger man was even more
richly attired in maroon velvet, heavily embroidered,
and slashed with gold-colored satin;
[113]

and he had a face and figure that would scarcely
pass unnoticed in any garb. But neither he
nor Sir William had fully realized the beauty
of their young companion until they saw her,
no longer clad in mourning, but wearing a
rich gown that her uncle had provided for the
occasion. It was of gray velvet, with a yoke
of rose-colored satin edged with fur, the inner
sleeves being of the same tint, as well as the
facings of the flowing ones, which came to the
elbow. The gray velvet skirt was looped up
on one side, showing a farthingale of pink
satin trimmed with lace. The colors and the
richness of the costume suited well her glowing
complexion and dark hair, and she made a
charming picture. As they passed through
the crowded anterooms, she attracted universal
attention, but moved on unconscious of it.
The painful contrast between the splendor of
these lofty rooms and the dreary ones at
Kimbolton struck her generous mind with its
full force. Here she saw gay courtiers, beautiful
women, and all the magnificence of a
court, and she had just come from the presence
of death. Young though she was, she had too
strong a character to be moved to forgetfulness
by the brilliance of the change. Catherine
had not won her affection, but she had inspired
[114]

her with a feeling of profound sympathy.
There was another shadow also on the mood of
Mistress Betty; the wizardâs strange statement
had haunted her secret thoughts ever since
it was made, and the sight of the scarred
stranger at the tavern disquieted her. Again
and again she told herself it was but folly, yet
she could not put it from her mind; and she
was strangely depressed as she walked beside
her uncle through the crowd of courtiers, who
gave place only to gaze again at the lovely face
and erect form of the young girl. Behind her
came Master Raby, secretly admiring her and
comparing her fresh beauty with the charms of
the gay dames who smiled at him as he passed.
At the entrance to the presence-chamber, they
were halted by the usher; but only for a
moment, a few words from Carew gaining
them admittance. The room opened into the
gallery with great folding-doors, and through
these the little party passed and found themselves
in a lofty apartment beyond. To Betty,
the splendid gayety of the scene was almost
bewildering, and she paused a moment on the
threshold, looking about her with perfect unconsciousness
of the attention that she immediately
attracted. The appearance of so
beautiful a young woman standing almost
[115]

alone in the doorway created in a moment a
little sensation.

The room was crowded with lords and gentlemen,
peers and peeresses; the glitter of gold,
the sheen of satin and brocade, the sparkle of
jewels, made a scene of varied beauty. Here
were handsome men and the loveliest of Englandâs
women; on one side stood the stately
figure of a prelate, on the other some foreign
ambassador; here was a gay court gallant,
yonder a reverend sage. Not far from the
door stood the king surrounded by his favored
nobles. He was, at this time, growing very
stout, but still retained much of the fine appearance
of his earlier manhood. His dress of
velvet and brocade was rich with gold embroidery
and his breast sparkled with jewels. His
great size and the natural majesty of his bearing
made him an imposing figure, but he possessed
a frank and cordial address which won
him many friends, even in those days of treason
and discontent. Beyond him, almost in the
center of the room, was Queen Anne Boleyn.

Mistress Betty had but one thought, and
that was of this queen; and as soon as she had
made her curtsy to the king, she passed on to
greet Anne, with feelings of mingled curiosity
and resentment for the sake of the dead
[116]

Catherine. Anne Boleyn was standing in the
midst of her ladies, and yellow was the prevailing
color of their costumes. The queen, a
young and beautiful woman, appeared as lovely
as ever even in that hour of unwomanly triumph.
The perfect oval of her face, the brilliance of
her eyes and the beauty of her complexion had
made her the star of Catherineâs court, and
she was still lovely, although it seemed to
many that she looked both ill and disturbed.
She was dressed in yellow brocade with a train
of cloth of gold trimmed with ermine, a coronet
of jewels resting on her flowing curls, for
she wore her hair frequently falling loose over
her shoulders. She knew that Betty Carew
had been in attendance at Kimbolton, and received
her coldly, although with courtesy, as
if she was at once displeased at the thought
of her late service, and willing to win her to
her own cause.

The presentation was over in a few moments
and Betty was led out of the royal circle by
her uncle, who conducted her to the other side
of the room. He took her to a group by one
of the windows, and Betty found that he was
introducing her to some stranger before she
had yet put the queen from her thoughts.

âMy Lady Crabtree,â he said, âthis is the
[117]

niece of whom I wrote you. Will you take
so great a charge, albeit not an uncomely
one?â

âThou art a fool, William,â retorted a sharp
voice, âto bring the wench hither.â

Betty Carew looked up in amazement and
saw an old woman standing by her uncle; a
woman, but one with so manly an air that the
young girl was not a little amused. Lady
Crabtree was tall and broad-shouldered, with a
large waist and a flat chest, being one of those
women whose figures are flattened out, with a
great width from side to side. She had a masculine
face with a large, hooked nose and keen
black eyes; the face of a woman who had
inherited not only her fatherâs traits of character,
but his full set of features, even to the
strong, broad teeth. Her snow-white hair was
put back under a large and ugly headdress, and
her garments, though rich, were neither stylish
nor elegant; and though an old woman, it was
apparent that she would have been more at ease
in doublet and hose than in a farthingale. She
was regarding Betty with a shrewd but not
unkindly glance, which seemed to comprehend
not only the girlâs great beauty, but also her
present frame of mind.

âWhat is thy name, child?â this singular
[118]

person asked; âCarew, I know, forsooth, but
it must have a handle to it.â

âMy name is Betty Carew,â the young girl
answered, smiling, âand I trust I may not make
my uncle sorry for bringing me to Greenwich.â

âIf you do not, Mistress Betty, it will not
be the fault of your face,â retorted Lady Crabtree,
calmly. âWhat say you, Mistress Wyatt,
is not my cousin Carew a fool to bring such
wares to such a market?â

At this, Bettyâs face flushed crimson, and
she raised her head haughtily, but before she
could speak, a richly gowned gentlewoman, who
stood beside her new acquaintance, replied.

âNay, Lady Crabtree,â she said, smiling,
âSir William has shown his usual discretion
and kindness to bring his niece to see the
world, and I am sure that so discreet a maid
will take no harm from the contact.â

âYou are a liar, Wyatt,â the old woman
retorted, laughing; âthat is why I love you.
To know how to lie gracefully, and at the right
moment, is one of the most charming accomplishments
and one of the rarest, albeit lying
is more frequent than dying. There is the
substance of a couplet for one of the court
singers; I was born a poet, but am like to die
unknown for such. Well, William,â she
[119]

added, turning again to Carew, âthis wench is
to be my charge, then?â

âAy, if you will have her, madam,â he
answered; âfor a while, at least. They want
her at court, and I can scarcely make her a
charge of any one more fit to guard her than
my Lady Crabtree.â

âI am a dragon then, William,â the old
woman said, with her queer smile, which was
not mirthful; âso be it. I will take care that
no wolf shall chew up this lamb. She shall
have good watching, though I think the wench
is no fool.â

âMadam,â said Betty, coldly, âI come here
only at my uncleâs will; I would rather, and it
pleased him, stay at Mohunâs Ottery.â

âIt would please me well enough, fair
niece,â Carew answered gravely, âbut there
be others, and I would fain do my duty by you
and them. Therefore you will stay with my
good cousin, Lady Crabtree, until I see fit to
take you home.â

Mistress Betty bit her lip. This settled the
matter for her, but it wounded her pride to be
a dependent on her uncleâs bounty and be
tossed about at his will. Nor did her new
guardian attract her. However, she could
only submit to fate, and she was compelled to
[120]

remain standing by Lady Crabtree while Sir
William mingled with the company, where he
found many acquaintances.

âDo not take it to heart, wench,â the old
woman remarked, her shrewd eyes detecting
Bettyâs sensations; âyou will love this place
too well erelong to leave it. âTis no spot for
any girl to mope in, and you are not of the
moping kind, I think. Dost know any of the
great people here to-day?â

âNone but the king and queen,â Betty
replied, turning her eyes upon the gay scene,
which was almost bewildering to one who had
lived the retired life that she had.

âPoor child! âtis dull to know so little of
the great folk here,â said Mrs. Wyatt, who
still stood by Lady Crabtree; âyonder is my
lord of Canterbury, and beside him, Master
Latimer, whom the queen has made Bishop of
Worcester. Ay, the queen,â she repeated, in reply
to Bettyâs questioning glance; âhe was her
graceâs chaplain, and she so wrought upon the
king that he is a bishop; and because he spoke
hard truth to her. And that goodly youth to
the left there is his grace of Richmond.â

âAy, and âtis a pity that the king can get
no other son so fair,â said Lady Crabtree,
sharply; ââtis a punishment.â

[121]
âHow can you tell what may happen in a short
while?â retorted Mrs. Wyatt, with emphasis.

âNo boy,â said the old woman, calmly; âif
we have much more ill luck, âtwill be the
King of Scots.â

âThey will nab thee as a traitor yet, if thy
tongue wags so free, my lady,â said Mrs.
Wyatt, with a startled glance about her; but
her odd companion only laughed grimly.

âLook there, Mistress Betty,â she added in
a moment; ââtis our relative, the master of
horse, Nicholas Carew, and yonder is his grace
of Exeter and that pretty boy, Courtenay.
What would you say, Mistress Wyatt, if I
prophesied that he would be a king of
England?â

âHold your tongue, madam, or surely you
will lose your ears,â replied Mrs. Wyatt, but
smiled at her companionâs manner.

âThey can but roast me at the best, as they
did the poor folks from Holland who held such
queer notions, which were doubtless no better
or sounder for the cooking,â returned Lady
Crabtree, laughing harshly. âLook you,
Wyatt, they would have treated Latimer as
they did these Anabaptists, and now he is a
bishop. Presently they will make me a duchess
for my sound policy.â

[122]
Mrs. Wyatt, however, did not heed her; she
was looking eagerly at a group across the
room.

âThere is Jane Seymour,â she said quickly,
âand she is radiant to-day.â

âAnd will be more so presently,â remarked
the old woman, calmly; âmy lord of Canterbury
can make this matter straight, and the
Bishop of Rome will nail no bull upon the
doors of Flemish churches.â

âI pray you speak less idly, madam,â Mrs.
Wyatt said, offended; âI love the queenâs
grace, as you know.â

âAnd so do I,â exclaimed Lady Crabtree;
and then aside to Betty, âMistress Wyatt is a
fool, my girl; yonder beauty, Jane Seymour, is
like to be a queen, and I mistake not. Mercy
on us! can you look for such faithfulness in
the kingâs grace when other men be weather-cocks?â

As she spoke, there was a movement in the
group near by; it separated, and the stranger
of the inn came up to where Betty and her
strange chaperon were standing. He bowed
low over Lady Crabtreeâs hand, speaking a
few words to her in an undertone.

ââTis my cousinâs niece,â the old woman
replied in her outspoken way. âMistress
[123]

Betty Carew, here is a gentleman who
craves to be presented to you: Sir Barton
Henge.â

Although the tall stranger turned to her
with a smile upon his handsome dark face,
Betty felt an instinctive repulsion. As she
made him a curtsy in response to his profound
bow, she looked up, and saw behind him Simon
Raby. In an instant relief and welcome leaped
into her eyes, and Henge seeing it, turned
sharply to confront the other man, and both
looked defiance at each other.

âSir, you jostled me,â Henge said
haughtily.

âYou crowded in my way,â replied Raby,
with disdain; âgive place, I am a friend of
this ladyâs!â

âFind room as you may,â retorted Henge,
sharply; âI will not budge an inch.â

âUntil I make you,â said Raby, coldly.
âYou choose a strange place for a brawl, sir,
but âtis worthy of you.â

âUpon my word, this is fine talk in the
kingâs presence!â exclaimed old Lady Crabtree,
laughing bitterly; âhave done, I will
have none of this! âTis too soon to quarrel
for a childâs pretty face. Master Raby, conduct
my ward out of this crowded spot; and
[124]

you, Sir Barton, stay with me; I would speak
with you.â

Passing Henge with a cold look of contempt,
Simon Raby took Betty away across the
room, and then the strange old woman turned
upon her companion, who stood scowling.

âLook you, Sir Barton,â she said in her
hard tone of command; âI know you well and I
will have no sword-thrusts with yonder boy.â

âThat young rakeââ began Henge, fiercely.

âAnd what are you, sir?â she exclaimed,
and laughed so harshly that even he winced a
little. âListen to me, Henge; this beautyâthis
young Mistress Carewâis penniless, and
will have none of my wealth either. You want
no such lady love as this, and need make no
wry faces about it. If you behave as becomes
your birth and station, you may even come and
go at pleasure in my house, where, I think,
you would come if you could. But hark ye,
Barton; if I catch you at any of your devil
tricks, Iâll have your ears off. Nay, scowl
not, man; an old woman like me has naught to
fear from you, and I know too much for you to
brave me. Ah, I thought I saw you wince.
Farewell, sir; here comes his grace of Suffolk,
and âtwould kill me if I could not ask him to
weep with me for the princess dowager; âtis
[125]

evident his grief sets well upon his stomach;â
and she turned to greet the nobleman with a
grim smile of enjoyment in the prospect.

Meanwhile Sir Barton Henge stood discomfited,
staring across the room at Betty and her
cavalier with a face of fury. A man of violent
temper, his first impulse was to engage in an
open brawl, but his better judgment told him
that an attempt to chastise Raby for his insolence
would only end in his own arrest in the
kingâs presence. So he was forced to content
himself with the reflection that when a better
opportunity presented itself, he would make
good use of it.

Across the room Master Raby had forgotten
him in looking at the fair face of Mistress
Betty, for âtis love that makes the world go
round.

[126]

CHAPTER XI

OLD MADAM AT HOME

Thus
a great change came into Betty Carewâs
life. After her introduction to the court at
Greenwich, Sir William formally placed her
in the charge of his eccentric relative and went
back alone to Mohunâs Ottery. The young
girl, left thus among strangers, endeavored to
adapt herself to their ways as she had before
taken up existence at her uncleâs house. Deep
in her heart were hidden wounded pride and a
feeling of desolation. She was poor and felt
herself but a toy in the hands of her wealthier
relations, and she was alone amidst a throng of
strangers. She had not a nature which repines;
the harder elements of resolution and
reserve grew faster in her heart than impulses
of love and happiness. She found her new life
far more full of interest and event than any she
had ever known. Her guardian was so strange
and active an old woman that she alone furnished
no little entertainment to an observer.
My Lady Wildrick Crabtree, as she was
[127]

called, was the daughter of Lord Wildrick of
Wildrick Hall at Deptford; her Christian
name was Zenobia, but she was rarely called
by it. She married, late in life, Lord Crabtree,
who promptly died, as the husbands of
such women always do. He was poor, but
from her father Lady Crabtree inherited a
large property, as she was an only child. It
had been said of her mother that, having borne
Zenobia, she could do no more in this world or
the next. Yet Lady Crabtree was a woman of
strong intellect, keen wit, and an untiring
energy, and was more sought after than any
woman of her age in London. Every manâs
business was her business; she knew all the
gossip of the court; she knew all the miseries
of the poor, and she was quick to right a
wrong and to take up the cause of the oppressed.
She could be in the saddle all day
and show no fatigue, although she had passed
seventy-five; a litter was ever scorned by her,
and she walked miles through the muddy roads
to aid the sick or destitute. Time she counted
as of great value; no hour could be wasted;
and so as to be out early in the morning, it
was no uncommon thing for her to have her
tirewoman arrange her white hair, of which
she had a quantity, over night. At such
[128]

seasons, her ladyship slept with her head
propped up, that the great superstructure might
not be injured. Her boots were all made
heavy and clumsy, after the fashion of those
worn by men, and her feet being large, she had
the tread of a man. The strength of her wrist
and fist had been rated high, since she knocked
down the largest man upon the street in a
group that laughed at her mannish stride. A
valiant protector she was for any young woman,
and as she came to know Mistress Betty, she
took a fancy to her, so that this strangely
assorted couple lived very peacefully together.

In the early part of February, when Queen
Anneâs illness cast a gloom over the court,
Lady Crabtree retired for a while to her house
at Deptford, where she held a little court of
her own. Wildrick Hall was a great house of
stone, built by the Normans and prepared for
defence, its battlements being heavy and its
windows little more than arrow-headed slits in
the thick walls. Within, the household was
like that of Mohunâs Ottery, upon a smaller
scale, and many people were daily fed under
the hospitable roof. The old gentlewoman
ruling with a rod of iron, and knowing well
every detail of the house, from the kitchen to
the banquet hall, was something of a terror to
[129]

her servants and attendants. In her own
domain she was judge and jury, and no man
dared gainsay her will; while she drove the
women like a flock of startled chickens cackling
as they fled pell-mell before my ladyâs
tongue, a scourge which she was quick to
supplement with a blow. She was full of great
oaths as any man, and knew how to hurl them
at the ears of an offender; yet she had, too, a
large sympathy for the unfortunate and a keen
judgment of men. In this household Mistress
Carew, finding her place beside its mistress,
was often diverted by her strange ways. Although
there were always many guests, it often
happened that these two ate together, while at
the lower end of the large hall were long tables
for the others.

One wintry day, early in February, Lady
Crabtree and Betty sat at breakfast. It was
seven in the morning, my ladyâs hour for
breaking her fast, and all the tables were set
with tapers which flared in the gloom, only a
little light creeping in through the narrow
windows. Bettyâs fresh face and brilliant
coloring made a sharp contrast to the hook-nosed,
strong countenance of the old woman,
whose white hair, dressed over night, was
nearly concealed by a great coif of yellow
[130]

velvet. She wore a gown of gay brocade, the
tight body, full sleeves, and huge farthingale
being in the style first introduced by Queen
Catherine. At her waist, on one side, hung a
heavy bunch of keys, and on the other she
wore a dagger. A fur-lined mantle was thrown
over her shoulders, and was needed, for the
sharp wind poured in at many crevices and
swept through the hall in gusts. She was a
marvellous figure, her spreading skirts, full
sleeves, and huge headdress making her seem
twice her natural size, which was above that of
woman. She performed her trencher duties
like a man, and a hungry one. On the table
was set a chine of beef, and with this, for the
two women, a quart of ale and a pint of wine
with a square loaf of bread. It was well known
that the salting tubs were numerous at Wildrick
Hall at Michaelmas, and the stores of
beef and mutton as great as any in the land;
for my lady was one who lived well and drank
well, as her father had before her, and ever
quarrelled with the statute of the third Edward,
which regulated the diet of both rich and
poor. No man should be served âwith more
than two courses,â said the law, âand each
mess of two sorts of victuals at the utmost,
be it flesh or fish, with the common sorts of
[131]

pottage, without sauce or any other sorts of
victuals.â

My Lady Crabtree had received a letter from
Mrs. Wyatt the previous day, and she read
from it to Betty as she ate her breakfast, making
her own comments upon it in her usual
fashion.

âThe queen recovers slowly from her illness
and is in sore distress of mind at the loss of
her boy, so says Mistress Wyatt,â remarked
the old woman; âlike enough, there be other
causes for her sorrow and rumors be true.â

âYou mean the kingâs fancy is caught by
another?â asked Betty, quietly.

âAy, that is the talk,â Lady Crabtree rejoined.
âWyatt is too close to the queen to
speak of it, but I have my information from a
sure hand. They do say that my Lady Anne
surprised him making love to the little Seymour.
The queen came suddenly upon them;
Jane sat on the kingâs knee, looking as demure
as ever. âTis said this brought Anne to her
present case; and that the kingâs grace is furious
at the loss of a boy.â

âI wonder if sheâthe queenâthinks now
of Queen Catherine,â remarked Betty, thoughtfully;
âpoor lady! she bore enough from this
same Anne Boleyn.â

[132]
âYet the statesmen would have us believe
that the king does all this because he would
have a boy to leave to rule in this realm,â said
Lady Crabtree, cutting the beef with a free
stroke of her knife. ââTis an excellent excuse
to marry a young wife to cheat the King of
Scots. There be others that would rejoice to
find a King of Scots in a like case, I doubt
not.â

âYet the succession is a serious matter,â
said Betty, smiling; âI have heard my uncle
speak of it with deep concern.â

âSerious enough,â retorted the old woman,
grimly. âMy Lady Salisbury is busy hatching
an egg of conspiracy, if I mistake not; and
there is Lord Hussey, who but lately had
charge of the Lady Mary, a man who knows
not the color of his own shirt from morn till
evening. As for Reginald Pole, he fancies
himself a pope already, and has thrown filth
enough upon the king and will endeavor to pull
down his grace, albeit he owes him much.
âTis a lovely muddle, and my lord privy seal is
as much hated as the devil. As for this queen,
she has put away from her, by some misfortune,
the Duke of Norfolk, her uncle, while
his grace of Suffolk hates her. As for Percy,
whom she loved, he is like to be of more harm
[133]

than help to her. âTis the devilâs pot and he
is here to brew it. Ah, what have we here,
Bronson?â This to a servant who stood near
her.

At the moment there was a hubbub at the
other end of the great apartment. The members
of the household who were eating at the
lower tables rose and peered over each otherâs
shoulders, while at the door was heard the
sound of a dispute. Lady Crabtree stood up
and struck the table with the handle of her
knife, her whole manner changing at once to
that of a ruler of the domain.

âSilence!â she called, in her loud voice.
âWhat fools make such an uproar at the
door?â

Instantly her guests and retainers sank
abashed into their places, and thus a view was
given of the entrance. There the steward, a
small, shrewd-visaged man, and the porter
were struggling to bring in a great-limbed,
burly fellow who resisted with all his might
though his hands were tied behind him.

âWho have you there, Sir Steward?â asked
his mistress, her eagle eye upon them and her
clenched fist resting on the table.

âMadam, âtis a vagrant caught in the third
offence,â panted the steward, as he and the
[134]

porter pulled the prisoner forward by main
force.

Old Madam, as she was so often called,
looked searchingly at the prisoner, a stout, ill-favored
man dressed in ragged clothing and
hanging his head, as if ashamed of his plight.

âHow can you prove the charge?â Lady
Crabtree asked sharply.

âLook at his slit ear, my lady,â said the
steward; âhis second offence of begging in
this parish was here too, yet he hath the boldness
to come here again, with his ear bored at
that.â

âA very valiant beggar certainly,â she remarked,
eying the vagrant with pitiless
contempt. âYou are a rogue,â she added,
addressing the captive; âbut what have you
to say?â

âI asked but for a herring,â the man replied
sullenly, looking up, and Betty saw that he was
cross-eyed, with an evil cast of countenance.

âAnd will hang for a herring, fool!â said
old Madam, harshly; âand it would be right,
for with that body you should work or die.
Take him to the justice,â she added to her
steward, âand tell him I will pay for the
rope.â

The two servants began to drag the prisoner
[135]

back, and he offered no great resistance, seeming
to accept his fate with sullen indifference;
but Betty Carew rose from her seat.

âSurely, madam,â she cried, âyou will
not hang this poor man for asking for a
herring?â

Lady Crabtree looked up with grim indifference.

âHe is a valiant beggar, wench,â she said
coolly, âand you know King Henryâs law?â

Betty looked at her with passionate scorn in
her young face.

âBy heaven, madam,â she cried, âyou are a
brute!â

Now this honest expression of her own feelings
so pleased the strange old woman that she
burst into a hearty fit of laughter. Meanwhile
the steward and the porter had paused in
amazement, and the prisoner stood between
them with a look of dogged wretchedness upon
his face.

âGo talk to the kingâs grace, Mistress
Betty,â said old Madam, wiping the tears of
laughter from her eyes; âthis realm is full of
these knaves, and we must hang them or they
will cut our throats.â

âIs life so cheap?â cried Betty, looking at
her with shining eyes; âhave we not all to
[136]

answer for our doings? I pray you, madam,
spare this fellow for shame of the herring!â

Lady Crabtree looked thoughtfully at the
vagrant, and then some strange notion moved
her again to laughter.

âYou shall have your will, mistress,â she
said; âhere, Bronson, go out and get a dozenânay,
twenty stout rods and distribute them.â

The servant went to execute her order,
while Betty remained standing, a puzzled expression
on her face. In a few moments the
company, to the number of sixteen or seventeen,
were armed with stout hickory staffs, and
Lady Crabtree directed that these men should
form in two lines from the door, leaving a
small aisle in the middle. This was done,
while all the members of the household were
on their feet, women and girls and gray-headed
men all looking on curiously. The light of
day, now much brighter, shone in the room,
and many of the tapers were extinguished.
When her orders were carried out, Lady Crabtree
rose and stood by the table, pointing her
finger at the culprit.

âHark ye, villain,â she said harshly, âthis
young lady has interceded for you, and though
I am breaking law thereby, yet would I pleasure
her. I give you this chance for your life.
[137]

Yonder is the door; make it, but take your
fortune with a beating and the magistrate upon
the other side. You, my servants, belabor
him well as he runs through the passage; spare
not the rogue, I charge ye. Now, Sir Steward,
loose him and let him go.â

The cords were cut from the manâs arms
and the two men stepped back to give him
room. For a moment he stood as if bewildered,
and then, turning, he started at a run down the
long hall. As he reached the middle of the
place, he came in contact with the staffs of
the men servants, who obeyed the mistressâs
behests with good will. The beggar dodged
wildly, but only to receive two blows for one
that he evaded. They fell on every side, and
he was driven in a zigzag course by the force
of the encounter. The dull sound of the blows
which hit the mark was mingled with shrill
laughter and shouts of approval, for it was an
entertainment to the household. Lady Crabtree
stood up and clapped her hands.

âWell hit there, Jacob!â she cried; âstrike
again, Andrew, but spare his skull; cheat not
the hangman of an honest job.â

There was a wild scuffle at the door, and
then the vagrant, with a strong blow from his
fist, sent a serving-man sprawling upon his
[138]

back and effected his escape amid a great
outcry.

âWell done, marvellously well done!â
laughed Lady Crabtree; âhe will beg here no
more. Sit down, Betty; you have won, and
may finish your breakfast.â

But Betty remained standing, her face pale
and her dark eyes full of fire.

âMadam,â she said, âI have no appetite; I
could not eat the herring that you saved.â

âWhat ails you, wench?â the old woman
asked grimly; âyour stomach is too dainty.
Know you not that the king would hang all
such?â

âI care not,â Mistress Carew cried; âthat
scene was one to turn a stouter heart than
mine. The man was a knave, but I have no
love of seeing misery made a sport of.â

âTush, mistress,â retorted old Madam, coolly,
âyou are a fool, as young women often are. I
have no pity for a man who would live dishonestly,
if he could; a dirty, lazy lout, who
begs and steals. Sit down, my girl, for here
is a guest who comes to look at your fair face
and hopes that I may die and leave you rich,
which I shall not.â

Betty looked up and saw Sir Barton Henge.
He had just been ushered into the hall, and
[139]

wore a rich riding-suit and carried his plumed
hat in his hand. He advanced with an air of
eager pleasure, his bold eyes fixed on Mistress
Carew.

âI crave your pardon, Lady Crabtree,â he
said, with a graceful salutation, âfor coming
so early, but I knew the morning star shone
ever at Wildrick Hall.â

âA very pretty compliment to an old woman,
Sir Barton,â Lady Crabtree said. âYou find
us much upset; my young mistress here flies
out at me because I will not coddle a valiant
beggar.â

Betty closed her lips tightly and drew
further away; her instinctive dislike for Henge
increased every time she saw him, though his
passionate admiration for her was plain enough
to flatter the vanity of one so young.

âMistress Carew has a tender heart,â said
Henge, smiling blandly; âI can see that in
her eyes.â

At this, old Madam burst out with a harsh
laugh.

âMercy on your imagination, sir,â she said
in great amusement, âif you can fancy any
tenderness in the glance that Mistress Betty
casts at you! You are in no favor in that
quarter.â

[140]
Betty blushed furiously, but held her peace.
She was not entirely displeased at Lady Crabtreeâs
frankness, for Sir Barton had pushed his
addresses with such violent warmth and haste
that she dreaded his visits.

âYou are gay this morning, madam,â he
said sharply, with a glance of ill-disguised
anger at the old woman; âhappily, you are not
the interpreter of Mistress Carewâs heart or
eyes.â

âYou fool,â retorted Lady Crabtree, laughing,
âBettyâs eyes need no interpreterââ

âMadam,â interrupted the young girl,
sharply, âI crave your permission to withdraw;â
and without waiting for a reply, she
turned and walked from the room, holding her
head high and with crimson cheeks.

âThere, Sir Barton,â laughed the old
woman, âsee how welcome you are! The
wench has sense, I tell you, and will none of
you.â

âI am not so confident of that as you, my
Lady Crabtree,â he retorted angrily; âI can
find a way to bring this haughty young mistress
to reason.â

The old woman looked at him sharply.

âYou have an air of mystery,â she said
coldly, âbut look you, Barton Henge, I love
[141]

this wench, and I swear that you shall not
disturb her, nay, or trouble her one whit. Sit
down and eat; you are hungry, doubtless; but
nourish no dreams of conquest, unless the
maid is willing, which she may be in time, for
all girls are fools once, else there would be
fewer marriages.â

[142]

CHAPTER XII

THE PRECONTRACT

Mistress Carew
, finding herself pursued
even to Wildrick Hall by the bold addresses
of Sir Barton Henge, and having a superstitious
dread of his scarred face, withdrew from
the company assembled about Lady Crabtree.
She pleaded a slight indisposition and kept
her room for a few days, although even there
she was followed by flowery missives from her
persistent suitor. They were brought to her
by one of the women, and after the first two,
Betty returned them unopened. She would
have dreaded Henge less had she been more
independent, but her peculiar position made
her fearful of his persecutions. She did not
know how her uncle would view the matter,
and if Sir Bartonâs suit was seconded by Sir
Williamâs commands, it might distress her yet
more deeply. As she sat alone, she had food
enough for sorrowful meditations; she was an
orphan and, unhappily as she thought, endowed
with a beauty which attracted the admiration
[143]

that she least desired. Had the suitor been
Simon Raby, her reflections would have been
of a totally different nature. But she was not
yet certain of Rabyâs feeling for her; she was
wise enough to know that the fine speeches of
a courtier counted for little, and she was too
proud to permit herself to believe in the tender
words which Simon had spoken to her. But
there was no room for doubt of Hengeâs bold
suit, and she shrank with horror from the
thought of such a lover, although his fine
appearance and gallant bearing might have
won the fancy of many a young woman placed
in similar circumstances; but Mistress Betty
had a temper and a will that matched with
decided opinions.

Henge had been two days at Wildrick, when
the household was surprised by the arrival of
Sir William Carew. He had been to London
on a business matter and came to Deptford to
see his niece before returning home. It was
difficult to feign illness while her uncle was
there, and Betty was forced from her retirement
at last. She came down to receive a
kind greeting from Sir William, but to be
annoyed by the addresses of her suitor. She
saw, too, that Carew treated Henge with
courtesy, and the fear beset her that her relatives
[144]

might be glad to be free of a penniless
girl, at any cost. She was likely to have
little voice in the affair, not even her preference
would be consulted; and it might be that
she would be driven into a marriage that she
despised, nor would it matter if her heart was
elsewhere. And indeed there was something
more than prejudice in her hatred of Henge, a
handsome man and one usually much favored
by women. Betty saw, instead, a vision of the
manly form and fine face of Simon Raby, and
she found nothing agreeable in her dark-browed
wooer.

It was the day after her uncleâs arrival that
she sat alone in a little turret chamber which
looked out over the river, and here Sir William
found her. A glance at his face told her that
his visit had some unusual import, and she
was troubled, half divining the truth. Carew
came in and sat down on a high oaken settle
beside her and was a moment silent, as if in
thought.

âThere is some trouble, uncle?â Mistress
Betty said, a quiver of excitement in her voice,
and her dark eyes on his face.

âYea, wench,â he said, âa trouble I had not
looked for; albeit I might have known Thomas
well enough for that.â

[145]
âYou mean my father?â she said in a low
tone; âthen it doth concern me.â

âIt doth concern thee, truly,â retorted
Carew, gravely; ânor do I see the end on it.
Did I not love thee, wench, it would not so
disturb me.â

âI pray thee, uncle, tell me all,â Betty
exclaimed, the trouble deepening on her face.

âThere is but little to tell, my girl,â he
answered, with a glance at her in which admiration
and pity were mingled. âI find you are
troth plight to Sir Barton Henge.â

Betty sprang from her seat, her face aflame.

ââTis a lie of his!â she cried, âa miserable
and cowardly lie!â

Sir William shook his head. âNay, fair
niece,â he said, âit is no lie. I saw the
papers; duly signed they are, too. âTwas
done when thy father had wealth and estate;
and there it stands, and would have stood, I
take it, had it not been for thy face.â

âIt does not matter, sir,â Betty cried, âI
will none of him. From the moment that I
saw him in the inn, I dreaded him, and there
is something in his face I cannot endure.â

âBelike there is, Betty,â Carew returned
gravely; âyet Henge is handsome, and esteemed
a brave man, albeit I never liked him, nor he
[146]

me. He drinks hard and lives better than his
purse allows; yet I do think that many women
would believe themselves happy and he chose
them. He loves thee, wench, madly too, I
think, as such men do sometimes; and it is
sure that he will never quit his claim, but cry
âprecontractâ if you dream of wedding elsewhere.â

Sir Williamâs tone was matter of fact and
calm, impressing his niece with a painful sense
of helplessness. To him this seemed doubtless
no uncommon affair, and a young girlâs
preference was of small consequence. Mistress
Betty stood looking at him with horror
growing in her eyes.

âAlas!â she said sadly, âthat evil wizard
told me I should wed a man scarred as Henge
is, on the brow.â

At this Carew pricked up his ears.

âWhat say you, niece?â he asked; âa
wizard? To what wizard did you go?â

âTo none,â she answered; âbut one came
to Kimbolton,âa little, bow-legged man, with
a russet cloak.â

âAh, Sanders,â said her uncle; âand he
was at Kimbolton? A sure sign that some
scheme was hatching. âTis well that the poor
lady died.â

[147]
Betty told him briefly the story of the packet,
and he nodded his head thoughtfully.

âYou did well, my child,â he said; âI knew
that I could trust you. As for Sandersâs
prophecy, doubtless he knew something of this
contract. It is the business of such men to
pick up all the information that they can. But
what will you say to Henge? Having heard
the whole matter from him, I could but lay it
before you. For my own part, I will not force
you, my girl; but bear in mind that you are
likely to have few suitors. You are portionless,
and this man loves you; of that there is
no doubt.â

He was watching the fair face closely as he
spoke, but he made no sign of any relenting
toward the penniless orphan. He did
not divine the struggle in the proud young
heart. She did not hesitate a moment in
her answer.

âI thank you, uncle,â she said with spirit,
âfor sparing me your displeasure, for truly I
could not obey you if you bade me wed this
man. I would sooner have his hatred than
his love, and both I hold as worthy only of my
contempt.â

âRemember, wench, that you are like to
die unwed, a poor dependent in the house of
[148]

some relative, picking up the crumbs that fall
from anotherâs table.â

âSir,â she answered proudly, âI would
rather starve than eat my bread as the wife of
this man Henge.â

Sir William smiled. âMy girl,â he said,
âI rejoice to see the spirit of your blood, and
I cannot blame you; yet this contract existsâmade
by your fatherââ

Betty interrupted him with a passionate
gesture.

âUncle, I would know the truth!â she
cried; âthey told meâthe old servants whispered
it in my childish ears, and it ran through
my veins like poison. They said my father
wagered my mother at the gaming-table the
night that I was bornâand lost. Is it
so?â

Her face was white now, and her great eyes
were set upon her uncleâs with a look that
made him wince. A deep red color stole over
his bronzed cheeks, and he bent his head,
shamefaced.

ââTis true,â he said harshly; âand it was
to this man Henge, then a roystering young
gamester, and he held the debt. Thy father
made this contract for thee in its room.â

âAnd he would claim it?â Mistress Betty
[149]

spoke in a low voice, but her face was like
the face of a corpse.

Sir William bowed his head without a word.

âBy heaven!â she cried, âI would sooner
be torn in pieces! Let him never dare to
come to me, or I shall insult himâI cannot
bear this agony of shame!â

âNay, offend him not, fair niece,â Carew
said gravely; âhe is an evil-tempered man
and may yet work much evil for you. I will
tell him that your mind is set against this
union, and that I will in no wise permit you to
be enforced. But let the man alone; your
tongue is sharp and will not mend your case,
and remember that he was in no way one whit
worse than your fatherânay, less culpable
than he.â

âUncle,â she said passionately, âI know
what my father wasâmay God forgive him.
From my babyhood it has been told meâthat
he was my shame. In my childhood it was
rated in my ears, and in my girlhood it was
forced upon me by the indifferent treatment of
those who should have befriended me, the
canting patronage that made a kindness to me
a charity. âTwas not my fault, God knows,
that he fathered me; had I had the choosing,
it should have been otherwise, but yet I suffer
[150]

for it. I am to be sold as chattel, it would
seem, because, forsooth, I am my fatherâs
child; but I swear that the man who buys me
shall find that I have enough of my father in
me to make his purchase a thorn in his flesh
and a curse to his peace!â

âThat I warrant, wench,â Carew said
grimly, âand I think that he will scarcely
break thy will unless he breaks thy neck.
Surely, I will not try to force thee. Henge
shall know that thou art so set against the
marriage that it may not be. And now, my
girl, make ready to go back to Greenwich, for
in my pocket is thy appointment as maid of
honor to the queenâs grace.â

A change came over Bettyâs face, and then
she answered with more composure.

âI had no wish to serve Queen Anne,â she
said; âI cannot put the dead queen from my
mind, but this one has been ill, too, and in
trouble. âTis well that I should be no longer
a burden here; I will go right cheerfully, and
I thank you for it, uncle.â

Sir William laid his hand upon her shoulder.

âMy wench,â he said, not unkindly, âthink
not so ill of me that I begrudge my orphan
niece her bread. I did but try you. I had no
wish for you to wed this Henge, though there
[151]

be many worse, for men are not the paragons
of a young maidâs dreams. But you will meet
him at Greenwich, and mark me, Betty, bear
yourself courteously toward him. âTis said of
him that he has the spite and venom of a
spider, and he is mad with love of that fair
face of yours; and truly he has the claim of a
precontract, albeit he shall not have you
against your will. But these are dangerous
times, and I have heard that he has the ear of
my lord privy seal, though I do suspect him of
being a malcontent and hating Cromwell, while
he fawns upon him. Make a friend of this
young queen, and perchance she may do you a
great service. They say that the kingâs highness
is not well pleased with her, but I take
this for idle rumor; for I remember when he
used to ride to Hever Castle to court her, as
ardent as a boy. âTis but a passing cloud and
her sun will burst forth again to scorch those
who have endeavored to work mischief against
her, as was the case of my lord cardinal. I
esteem it a good fortune to get this appointment
for you, which I did through Mrs. Wyatt,
the queenâs particular friend. We will leave Sir
Barton to Zenobia, who torments him as a cat
does a mouse; and haste you, for in an hour
we go by the river to Greenwich.â

[152]

CHAPTER XIII

THE QUEEN AT GREENWICH

When
Sir Williamâs barge stopped at the
water-stairs at Greenwich Palace, Master Raby
came down to meet Mistress Betty and her
uncle. It was an accident, yet his pleasure
at the encounter was so evident that Carew
smiled; the beauty of that face was doing mischief
in more than one case, he thought, and
was amused to note that here his high-tempered
niece showed only gentle courtesy.

âSets the wind in that quarter?â Sir William
said to himself; âthen, verily, Henge is
like to have a very pretty quarrel on his
hands, for here is a young sprig who can
handle a sword as well as he.â

Meanwhile, unconscious of the thoughts
running through Carewâs brain, Mistress Betty
and her escort walked a little in advance, engaged
in conversation. Half-way to the palace
gates, some acquaintances stayed Sir Williamâs
progress, and the two, coming alone to the
entrance, stood waiting for him. They were
[153]

undisturbed; the king was at Whitehall, and
but few loungers showed themselves about the
palace. In spite of his pleasant greeting, there
was some constraint in Rabyâs manner, and
now that the opportunity presented itself, he
turned abruptly to his companion, a flush
mounting to his face as he addressed her.

âMistress Carew,â he said, with some hesitation,
ââtis said that you are plighted to Sir
Barton Henge.â

Betty started, her face flushing more deeply
than his.

âWho tells these tales?â she exclaimed.

âThey are but idle tales, then?â he asked
quickly. âI could scarce credit them, knowing
that you knew him not that night at the inn.â

She looked at him with perplexity in her
eyes. What could she do, she thought, and
how defend herself against her enemy? Truth
alone could help her, even while it wounded
her, and she was brave enough to see it.

âMaster Raby,â she said, with a soft falter
in her voice that her uncle would not have
recognized, âthere is a contract, made when I
was a baby; not even my uncle knew of it.
Upon the strength of that, Sir Barton must
have set these rumors afloat; there is naught
else.â

[154]
Her companionâs face fell at her words.

âA contract?â he said slowly; âand Sir
William wishes it fulfilled, doubtless, and
you, Mistress Carew?â

âSir, I will never wed him,â she said
firmly, holding her head proudly.

There was a joyful flash in Rabyâs eyes
which brought a softer blush to Bettyâs cheek.

ââTwould be a sacrifice to make angels
weep!â he said in a low tone, his radiant
glance making her eyes seek the ground; âthe
man is a knave to claim it against your will.â

ââTis prophesied that I will wed a man so
scarred,â she said, in a troubled voice, for
superstition had stirred in her heart ever since
she first saw Sir Bartonâs brow.

Simon Raby laughed as he took her hand,
which offered but a poor resistance.

âMistress Carew,â he whispered, âmay not
another man be so scarred? Truly, there are
many who would bear a greater cut for thy
sake.â

A roguish smile curved Bettyâs lips, but
she averted her face.

âBut I like not the scar, sir,â she said
demurely.

âThen I swear that thou shalt not wed a
scarred face,â Raby answered; and he kissed
[155]

the embroidered glove that she had left between
his fingers, having slipped her hand out
of it.

âMy uncle says a dowerless maid is not
soon wedded, sir,â she retorted, with a flash of
pride in her brown eyes; âthe scarred and battered
remnants are for the portionless, I take
it.â

This sudden outburst took Master Raby by
surprise. Unconscious of the wound in the
young girlâs heart, he could not understand the
bitterness of her tone. But he had a frank and
generous nature, and it kindled in quick sympathy
for the beautiful orphan.

âMistress Carew,â he said gently, âthere
are some who need no richer dower than the
one which nature gave at birth, and which
outshines all others.â

Ashamed of her sudden outbreak, she turned
away and looked to see her uncle coming
toward them. Before he reached them, Raby
spoke again.

âI know not your uncleâs mind, fair mistress,â
he said gravely, âbut if this man
Henge in aught offend you, I pray you remember
that one sword is ever at your service, and
one arm ever ready to defend your cause.â

The young girl looked up at the fine, frank
[156]

face and kindling eyes, and her heart throbbed
in her breast.

âI thank you,â she faltered, and the flush
on his face shone in hers like the rising sun;
âsir, I thank you with all my heart, and I am
your debtor.â

âNay,â he answered softly, âI shall be
yours, and you let me serve you.â

And Sir William, coming up, found them
blushing like two children, and smiled to himself,
wondering not a little how this tangled
skein would unravel. But he made no sign,
only carrying Mistress Betty away to install
her in her new post before he went on to his
home in Devon, where there was need of his
presence at all times.

The royal household at Greenwich was
under a cloud. The queenâs illness had disturbed
the tranquillity of the new year, and
there were whispers that the king was estranged
by the loss of his boy, born dead on the 29th
of January. Anne had made a slow recovery
and had withdrawn herself from the festivities
of the court; she chose to be much alone, and
wandered in secluded corners of Greenwich
Park, often unattended, save by her little
dogs. It was an inauspicious time for Mistress
Betty to receive an appointment in the
[157]

household, but she was kindly welcomed by
the queenâs other attendants, and took up her
new duties with a lighter heart since she had
talked with Simon Raby. The young girl,
who had been a dependent in her uncleâs
house, now found herself a person of some consequence.
Each maid of honor was permitted
a tirewoman and a little spaniel to attend her,
and Betty had a liberal breakfast-table, served
with a chine of beef, a manchet and a chet
loaf, besides a flagon of beer in which there
were no hops. But all the maids of honor
dined at mess, and chickens, pigeons, and
rabbits were served, as well as beef and manchets
and much wine, according to the custom
of the time. Their hours of attendance on the
queen were ordered by rule, and for the first
few days Betty was unnoticed by Anne, and
found opportunity to make acquaintance with
those about her, and more than once saw Raby,
who was at Greenwich as an equerry of the
queen.

The freedom of her life at Mohunâs Ottery
and Wildrick made the more confining office
of maid of honor irksome, and the young girl
took every opportunity to walk out into the
park. She loved best the early morning hours,
when few were stirring outside the palace, and
[158]

she found her best amusement in these solitary
strolls. It was thus, one morning, that she
came upon the queen, also alone. Mistress
Carew was returning from her walk, and entered
the quadrangle court, where the morning sunlight
was shining with little power. She was
startled by the sight of the queen, sitting on a
stone bench a little way before her. Anne
Boleyn was alone, and sat watching her little
dogs, who were playing in front of her, tossing
a ball between them, snapping and barking in
the abandonment of canine joy. The queen
was dressed in red damask, a deep cape of
black velvet edged with fur hanging over her
shoulders, and on her head a five-cornered
black velvet hood trimmed with pearls. So
absorbed was she in thought that she did not
at first notice the presence of her maid of
honor, and Betty had time to note the changes
made by illness in her face, and she thought,
too, that she had been weeping. Unwilling to
disturb her revery, the young girl made an
effort to pass her unnoticed; but Anne, hearing
the rustle of her skirts, looked up. For
a moment there was no recognition in her
eyes, and then she remembered the beautiful
face.

ââTis Mistress Carew,â she said, in her soft
[159]

voice; âcome hither, I would speak with
thee.â

Surprised, but pleased by the queenâs gentle
manner, Betty drew near and stood in an attitude
of quiet attention. Anne sat looking at
her sadly, and so long that she became embarrassed,
and the color mantled richly in her
cheeks.

âYou are marvellously lovely,â said the
queen, at last; âyet I, who once so prized my
own beauty, have begun to think it of little
value, and that the price we pay for its exaltation
is too great. Tread carefully, my maid,
else it will bring you only misery.â

âI have been taught to place small value on
it, your grace,â Betty answered soberly, âI
was fortunate in my schooling.â

âAlas!â said Anne, âI would it had been
so with me; but I was bred in France and,
save for good Master Latimer, there have been
few to tell the truth to me.â

She paused, and her eyes rested thoughtfully
upon the ground, and Betty stood uncertain
whether to withdraw or remain, and for a
few moments there was an uneasy silence.
Then the queen looked up again.

âMistress Carew,â she said abruptly, âyou
were at Kimbolton?â

[160]
Betty flushed with surprise.

âOnly for a little while, madam,â she said.

âWere you chosen byââ she hesitated and
then added clearly, âby the late queen?â

âNo,â replied Betty, quietly, âI know not
the manner of my selection. One winter night
Master Raby came down to Mohunâs Ottery
with letters from my lord privy seal, and in
the morning my uncle took me to Kimbolton.â

âAh, my lord privy seal was then over-zealous
in my cause, albeit now he cools,â
said Anne, thoughtfully; âdoubtless you were
sent in the room of one she would have chosen,
had she had any choice. Alack!â she added in
a strange voice, ââtis little more than a month
since I rejoiced at her passing away and believed
myself at last the Queen of England;
but nowâgreat heaven! how like a quicksand
is the heart of man, and swallows up all things
that touch it! Maiden, I have heard the
stories of Catherineâs deathâwere they true?â

âAy, madam,â said Betty, firmly; âshe died
like a Christian, and royallyâlike a queen;
albeit the first estate is higher than the last.â

âAnd I was sorry that she made so good an
end,â said Anne Boleyn, musingly; âand yet
she never harmed me, even when I held her
high place against her. I knew her; she was
[161]

an austere woman and unlovely, yet, as you
said, a Christian. My girl,â she added, turning
suddenly to Betty, âwhich would you love,
her or me?â

Mistress Carew stood blushing, tongue-tied,
for in her heart she had ever condemned this
fair woman; but now, under the spell of her
glance and voice, her resolution faltered.
Anne, accustomed to reading the faces of those
about her, read at a glance the trouble in the
young girlâs heart.

âI see,â she said, rising, and laying her
hand on Bettyâs arm. âGive me your help,
wench, to the house, for I am not strong in
heart or body. You loved the virtue of that
dead queen, and you have seen me rejoice at
her fall. Yet bethink you, Mistress Carew,
how mighty was my temptation; and I was
young and had been bred in that gay court
beyond the seas. Judge not too sharply, lest
you be in like case; for you have a beauty as
great as mine in my first youth. My heart is
heavy; I would have some about me to love
Queen Anne Boleyn. I charge you, mistress,
to think less of the dead and more of the living
queen, who bears in her breast a sorrow
and alas, has failed to bring a prince to
England!â

[162]

CHAPTER XIV

THE STRANGE HOUSE BY THE THAMES

It
was evening and it was strangely quiet at
Greenwich Palace. The king was again absent,
and the queen kept her state alone. The gay
rufflers of the court were gathered in other
quarters, however, for that day Anne had but
few of her own maids about her. Grooms and
lackeys crowded the outer corridors, but the
lofty apartments of the queen were well nigh
empty. It was reported that she was indisposed,
but this was rather an excuse for the
seclusion she desired. She sat in a great room
hung with rich-hued tapestries, a fire blazing
on the hearth and a hundred tapers burning;
its brilliance, warmth, the delicate perfume in
the air being a strange contrast to those rooms
at Kimbolton where a queen had died. Anne
Boleyn herself was clad in white and silver
brocade, a cape of Flemish lace upon her
shoulders, strings of pearls about that slender
throat, and on her head a coif of crimson velvet
edged with pearls, a great diamond set in the
[163]

front and shining on her brow like a star. But
for her pallor and the haggard look about her
eyes, she was as beautiful as she was in
her days of triumph as the Marchioness of
Pembroke. She sat in the center of the room,
and at her feet, upon a crimson cushion, was
Mrs. Wyatt. About these two were gathered
three other attendants, Lady Rochford, the
queenâs sister-in-law, Mistress Gaynsford, and
Betty Carew; Betty herself as lovely as the
queen, dressed in pale blue with a chain of
dull gold about her neck, given her by Anne.
There were no others, and the talk was free of
all restraint, the queenâs easy intercourse with
her own people and her carelessness of speech
afterwards feeding the fire when scandal was
busy with her fair fame.

Her favorite, Mary Wyatt, was recounting
her adventures in seeking some one to cast her
horoscope, and Anne, diverted by the story,
encouraged her with eager attention. It was
a charming scene, these five handsome women
in their gay apparel, in that lofty chamber
where the flames of so many tapers made a
luster that expelled all gloom, and only the
pale face of the queen told the story of the
secret trouble, the growing estrangement between
her and the king. She let her jewelled
[164]

hand rest caressingly on Mistress Wyattâs
shoulder while she talked.

âHow ended it, Mary?â she asked indulgently;
âyou make a long tale before you
come to the pith of the matter, yet we know
your horoscope was castâand happily, as I
think it should be, albeit you are a naughty
rogue.â

âMadam, I found a wizard truly,â Mrs.
Wyatt answered, soberly enough; âindeed, a
king of wizards, though a little man.â

At these words Betty started uneasily; she
hated the mention of a wizard since the
prophecy of the scar.

âLittle in measure, sweetheart, but great in
power, doubtless,â said the queen.

âYour grace would find him a marvellous
strange character,â Mrs. Wyatt answered;
âwhen I sat and looked at him and heard him
tell me the most secret thoughts of mine own
heart, verily, my blood ran cold.â

âWere thy secret thoughts so evil, Mary?â
asked Anne, archly.

âIt mattered not what they were, my queen,â
Mary Wyatt said; âit was his manner of telling
them, and his fearful eyes which burnt
into my brain.â

âThe girl is frightened,â said the queen,
[165]

laughing; âfor shame. I thought you a brave
heart.â

âMadam, I am no coward, as ye know,â her
attendant answered with spirit; âbut the man
is gruesome, and he has tales and prophecies
that are marvellous to hear.â

âWhat is he like?â asked Anne, curiously.

âHe is short and bandy-legged, and has a
countenance like a wolfâs, with great black eyes
that burn like fire.â

ââTis Sanders,â said Betty Carew; âZachary
Sanders, the great wizard.â

The queen turned quickly toward her.

âWhere didst thou see him?â she asked.

Mistress Betty hesitated, casting a doubtful
glance at the others.

âSpeak,â said Anne, impatiently; âhere all
are friends.â

âI saw him at Kimbolton, madam,â Betty
answered softly, blushing at Mrs. Wyattâs
reproachful glance.

âAh, a partisan of the princess dowager,â
exclaimed Lady Rochford, with contempt;
âyou chose poor company, Mistress Wyatt,
and a poor adviser.â

âA man does not carry his politics upon his
face,â said Mary Wyatt, indignantly, âanymore
than his heart upon his sleeve.â

[166]
âHush!â said the queen, âit does not
matter. Mistress Carew, how came he to
Kimbolton, and wherefore?â

Betty briefly related the accidental encounter
at the Blue Boar and the exploit of the piebald
horse.

âSaw he the queenâI mean, the princess?â
Anne asked quickly.

âAy, your grace,â Betty replied; âI was
sent to Sir Edmund to crave his attendance in
our private rooms.â

âA ruse!â exclaimed the queen at once;
âthe rogue lashed your horse to gain some
notice from Bedingfield. How thick are some
brains not to see such manÅuvers! But it only
interests me more in the man. Where does
he live, Mary? what manner of house has he?â

Mrs. Wyatt, abashed at her unfortunate
blunder in bringing up Queen Catherineâs
affairs, was more reluctant to answer.

ââTis a gloomy place in London,â she said,
âand would little interest your highness.â

âBut it does interest me, madam,â Anne
exclaimed, with a touch of imperious temper;
âI will know all that you do.â

âHaving said so much, Wyatt, there is no
hurt in saying all,â remarked Lady Rochford,
scornfully.

[167]
Mary Wyatt cast a glance of anger and dislike
at the woman whom she deeply distrusted,
believing her untrue to the queen, but she
obeyed Anneâs behest and told the rest without
further demur.

âThe house is in London,â she said calmly,
âand we came to it by the water-gate, over the
which is set a great image of an owl. The
building is very old; âtis said that William
Rufus built it, but I know not; it is dark and
tall and narrow, for there have been two stories
added to the original two, and these upper
ones are graduated, being like two blocks set
on the house, the highest being the least, and
the roof is pointed like the houses that I saw
at Antwerp. From the outside, it seems as
full of windows as a sieve is full of holes, and
none are even, but within âtis dark as a sepulcher.
The door we came to, which faces the
river, is small and very strong, having three
cross-bars of iron to stay the wood, and on it
are the signs of the zodiac, and above it the
head of a serpent. The house, they say, hath
five doors, albeit you may find but three with
the naked eye; but verily there should be one
opening downward for the convenience of
Satan. When you are admitted there are
stairs to climb up, up, to the third story, the
[168]

first of the two little ones. Here there are
three rooms all draped, and here he receives
you. Above only his favored clients go; that
upper story is his observatory, from whence he
says he reads the heavens and casts your horoscope.
Many gruesome things he has there,
a treasury of horrors. But truly, madam, the
man is marvellous and reads the mind as he
doth an open scroll.â

âI will see this marvel,â said the queen,
with sudden animation; âI will go to this
houseâunknownâand have my horoscope
cast.â

âOh, madam, I beseech you not!â cried
Mrs. Wyatt, her face paling with some apprehension
which she dared not tell; âif you must
see him, have him here, as becomes you, but
not thereânot there!â

âTush, Mary!â cried the queen, her whim
taking possession of her, âyou are a fool!
âTwill be a mask worth playing. Right glad
should I be to be merry for one hour; we will
go nowâat once!â

âMadam, madam, âtis too late!â exclaimed
Lady Rochford; âthe kingâs grace will be ill
pleased.â

Anne drew herself up with flashing eyes.

âWho gave you charge of me, my Lady
[169]

Rochford?â she said bitterly; âam I the
queen or you?â

Her sister-in-law winced and drew back, but
she bit her lip in passionate anger at the
rebuke.

âHave your way, madam,â she said coldly;
âwe are but your servants.â

The queen turned her back upon her with a
gesture of disdain.

âMary,â she said to Mrs. Wyatt, âgo you
and get me a mask and a sober mantle and
hood; and you, Mistress Carew, call hither
some gentlemen we can trust to escort us; we
shall need but two stout serving men beside.â

âMadam, who shall I summon?â Betty
asked, and then added with a slight hesitation,
âMaster Simon Raby?â

The queen smiled archly, bringing a blush
to Bettyâs cheek.

âAy, my girl,â she said; âMaster Raby and
my cousin, Sir Francis Bryan.â

Despite the anger of Lady Rochford and the
evident reluctance of Mrs. Wyatt, the little
party was soon organized, Anne Boleyn directing
all things with feverish gayety, as if she
snatched at any prospect of entertainment in
her hour of melancholy. She was masked and
muffled until all her splendid dress was hidden
[170]

and there seemed no possibility of recognition.
Then she made each maid of honor assume an
equal disguise, and escorted by Raby, Bryan
and two of the palace yeomen, she set out in a
private barge upon the river. It was yet early
in the evening, and the moon was shining with
a light that cast a whiteness on the landscape.
The voyage up the river was swift and uneventful,
although the queen pretended to anticipate
an encounter with the royal barge, as the king
might be on his way to Greenwich. However,
they passed but few craft, and came at last to
the water-gate of the strange house upon the
Thames. As Mrs. Wyatt had described it,
there it stood with its two upper stories in
tiers, and its many windows like bandaged
eyes, for every shutter was up and not a ray of
light shone anywhere; the moon shining upon
the opposite side made the face toward the river
black as night. The little party found the
wicket at the water-stairs unfastened and, after
some curious glances at the imperfectly outlined
owl above it, the visitors passed on across
the garden, Mistress Wyatt showing them the
door, which was hard to find in the niches of
the wall. Raby struck a resounding summons
on it with the hilt of his sword, waking echoes
within the house, but there was no response.
[171]

The wind from the water was keen and the
place so forbidding that the queen began to
shiver under her mantle.

ââTis cold,â she murmured; âI should have
worn my partlet of sable skins and my muffy.
Knock louder, Master Raby; the fleshy ears
of wizards are ever deaf, I take it.â

The summons was repeated with more clamor
than before, but still no sound within.

âMary, thy bandy-legged sage is dead, or
gone to visit the black man,â said the queen,
impatiently. âThe place smells like a grave;
âtis an ill-favored house. Bryan, bring the
two knaves from the water-gate and force the
door; I will not have this rogue bar out the
Queen of England.â

As she spoke, the door opened suddenly and
silently, revealing a dimly lighted, seemingly
endless stairway, but there was no human
being in sight.

[172]

CHAPTER XV

A CRY OF TREASON

The
little party at the wizardâs door stood a
moment confounded by this mysterious response
to their summons. They looked anxiously up
the narrow flight of stairs, expecting to see
the strange master of the house, but there was
neither sign nor sound of human occupation.
The more superstitious of the party drew back
in alarm.

ââTis magic,â said Lady Rochford, with a
shudder; âlet us leave this evil place!â

Simon Raby laughed. âHave no fear,â he
said lightly; ââtis but an act of mummery to
frighten the ignorant. Madam,â he added,
turning to the queen, âwill your grace
ascend?â

âAy, surely,â replied Anne, with forced
gayety, for the aspect of the place disturbed
her; âwe did not come so far to turn back like
frightened children. My Lady Rochford, if
you are afraid, you may even stay without with
my two grooms.â

[173]
âI thank you, madam,â her sister-in-law
retorted tartly; âI appreciate the company to
which you assign me, but I am brave enough
to follow where my sovereign leads.â

âGood lack!â said Anne, laughing bitterly;
âhow hapless should I be to lose so brave an
attendant! Come, Francis,â she added, turning
to her cousin, âyou and Master Raby lead
the way and we five women will follow, and
remember that here I am not a queen, but only
Mistress Anne.â

âMadam, your will is law,â replied Bryan;
but although he had smiled at the fears of the
women, he loosened his sword in the scabbard
before he led the way up the narrow stairs,
followed closely by the queen, who was assisted
by Master Raby, and behind these three came
the four maids of honor, while the two yeomen
remained at the door.

The tedious ascent of the long staircase was
made slowly, the queen stopping once or twice
to complain that she was short of breath, being
really discouraged from her plan but too wilful
to surrender her whim. The stairs went
straight up between two blank walls, having
no landings or doors opening upon them. The
steps were imperfectly lighted with tapers set
in iron brackets at intervals all the way up.

[174]
âI marvel if Jacobâs ladder was any longer,â
said the queen, laughing, as they came at last
to the top.

At the head of the stairs a heavy curtain of
black velvet hung before them, shutting off
the rooms beyond. Sir Francis Bryan, lifting
it, held the folds aside that the queenâs party
might enter, and thus revealed a brightly
lighted room decorated with dark tapestries
and carpeted with ray-cloth. It was richly
furnished, and on the table in the center stood
a great crystal ball. From this room a short
flight of stairs went up to the upper story, a
narrow pointed door at the top cutting off the
view.

âWe must conjure the wizard, it seems,â
Simon Raby said, as they looked about them
at the empty room; and taking a few steps up
the narrow stair, he struck the little door with
his fist, after trying in vain to open it.

It was instantly unfastened, and the wizard
himself stood on the threshold. Taken by
surprise, Raby recoiled a step at the startling
vision. The little man was arrayed in blood
red from head to foot, his velvet doublet
heavily embroidered in black, and on his
breast, sparkling like an evil eye, was a splendid
opal. He viewed his uninvited guests
[175]

calmly, his keen glance instantly singling out
the queen, though she had drawn back behind
the others. Sanders smiled, coming down the
steps to meet them.

âSir Francis Bryan and Master Raby, you
are welcome,â he said quietly; âthese ladies,
I see, would not be called by their names, but,
even unknown, they are also welcome.â

âWe have come here for entertainment and
instruction, Sir Wizard,â Raby said, seeing
the hesitation of his companions; ââtis for
your art to furnish it.â

âAy,â replied the wizard calmly, his brilliant
black eyes still fixed upon Anne Boleyn,
âI saw you when you came down to the water-stairs
at Greenwich.â

The queen started and drew her mantle
closer, while both Lady Rochford and Mistress
Gaynsford recoiled in superstitious dread.
Anxious as they all were to conceal Anneâs
identity, this remark threw them into confusion.
It was Betty who came boldly to the rescue.

âGood Master Wizard,â she said, âI pray
you tell us our fortunes.â

âYours I have already told, Mistress
Carew,â he replied with a smile.

At this Betty, too, drew back in amazement,
but Simon Raby reassured her.

[176]
âHe knew thy voice,â he whispered; ââtis
but childâs play, have no fear.â

Alarmed at the wizardâs knowledge, Lady
Rochford had laid her hand on the queenâs
arm, trying to draw her away, but Anne shook
her off with impatience; possessing a naturally
intrepid and wilful nature, she had no mind
to be so easily balked in her purpose. She
walked over to the table, and pointed her
finger at some glass instruments and a scepter
lying there.

âWhat are these, sir?â she said curiously,
her natural taste for adventure overcoming her
hesitation.

âThey are used to conjure the four kings,
madam,â replied the wizard, courteously; âI
will gladly show you more curious things.â

The room was hung with every gruesome
evidence of his trade, and as he spoke, he
opened a curiously wrought box of silver to
show Anne a serpent skin, but her mind was
on other matters.

âSir,â she said abruptly, âare you the wizard
who consorted so freely with my lord privy seal
when he was in the house of the cardinal?â

Sanders was too keen to be caught in the
snare that she had set for him.

âNay, madam,â he replied coolly, âgreat
[177]

men have come to me, but not my lord privy
seal. Yonder is the cardinalâs great book,â
he added, pointing to a tome upon a cabinet,
âand this is a ring he wore. I foretold the
day that he would sit upon a mule, with his
legs bound under its belly, for his machinations
against the queenâs grace; but he heeded
me not, and lo, the end was accomplished even
as I said. Whose horoscope shall I first cast,
fair ladies?â he added, bowing to the group,
for the others had gathered eagerly about the
queen.

âMine,â answered Anne, laughing; ââtis
I who would discern the future, sir; one, at
least, of these good dames is too affrighted to
ask her fortune,â she added, with a haughty
glance at Lady Rochford.

âMadam, I pray you, think,â protested Mary
Wyatt, plucking at her mantle; but the queen
withdrew it with an imperious gesture.

âI am happy to serve you,â said the wizard,
blandly; and he turned, and ascending the
little stairway, opened the door above. âMadam
will ascend,â he said, âwhile I read the
stars.â

Without a momentâs hesitation Anne went
up the stairs, and her maids would have followed
her, but Sanders barred the way.

[178]
âBut one here,â he said with his odd smile;
âmore would destroy the spell.â

âI will go with her,â cried Mrs. Wyatt, too
alarmed and suspicious to consider her words.

âThat you will not,â said the queen,
haughtily; âyou shall not spoil my entertainment.
Remain there, good friends,â she
added, recollecting her disguise; âwe must
propitiate the sage. Lead on, Sir Wizard; I
will follow.â

âBe assured, madam, that I feel the honor
of the visit,â he replied complaisantly, holding
the door open for her to enter and then
shutting it deliberately in the faces of her discomfited
escorts.

âThis is your fault, Mistress Wyatt,â cried
Lady Rochford, angrily; âand if harm comes
to her, you will rue it!â

âHave patience, madam,â said Raby, smiling;
âwhat harm could come to her grace
when we are here? and why should the little
man design evil against her?â

âThere be plenty who do design it,â she
replied coldly, âand would gladly compass it.â

âAy, those who are jealous of her beauty
and her high estate,â said Mary Wyatt, with a
hard glance at Lady Rochford, who affected
not to notice it.

[179]
ââTwas no place to bring her in her nervous
state,â remarked Mistress Gaynsford; ââtis
enough to set a strong manâs heart beating.
How could you dream of it, Mistress Wyatt?â

âAlas!â said Mary, passionately, ââtis hard
that I who greatly love the queenâs grace
should be held charged with this expedition.
How could I know that she would plan it? It
was as unlooked for by me as by any of you,
and from my heart I do regret my careless
tongue which tripped out the idle story.â

âYou are not to blame,â said Betty, with
generous warmth; ââtis a shame to charge it
on you. The queen was bent upon some
change, some diversion. I know this man
Sanders, and truly I do not fear that he will
offend her grace, for I believe he knows her.â

âHe hath the eye of a ferret,â remarked Sir
Francis, âand with you, Mistress Carew, I
think he will be careful; he knows that it
would cost little to split his gullet if he
designed evil.â

They stood grouped about the steps, too
anxious to retire from them, yet each trying to
put a good face on the matter. Having been
recognized, Betty had removed her mask and
stood farthest from the stairs. There was an
uneasy pause as they waited, and in it they
[180]

heard a step at the outer entrance; before they
could decide how to receive a new-comer, the
black curtain was lifted, and Sir Barton Henge
entered the room.

âHow did he pass the guard below?â whispered
Bryan to Raby, and both looked askance
at the intruder, Rabyâs face flushing with anger.

Recognizing at once that this was a party
from the palace, Henge made a graceful obeisance
to the women, and was greeted both by
Lady Rochford and Mistress Gaynsford with
some show of cordiality. Divining, doubtless,
who was within the wizardâs secret chamber,
he took his place amongst them, but singled
out Betty Carew as the object of his attention.
Approaching the young girl, he began to
whisper to her in spite of her indignant gesture
of disdain. Her instinctive horror of him
gaining control of her already agitated mind,
she shrank farther into the corner, casting an
appealing glance at Simon Raby, who instantly
responded. He pushed roughly past Sir Barton
and began to talk to Betty, turning his back
squarely in the face of her less favored wooer.
Henge paused a moment astounded, his face
crimson with wrath, and then he plucked Raby
by the sleeve. Simon turned upon him with
an air that was in itself an insult.

[181]
âSir,â he said, âwas it you, or the devil, that
touched my sleeve?â

âIt had better have been the devil for your
sake, Master Raby,â cried Henge, fiercely. âI
was speaking to Mistress Carew; mayhap you
are blind and deaf and knew it not.â

âAnd I am speaking to her now,â said
Raby, with a mocking laugh; âtherefore, sir,
go to the devil!â

Henge laid his hand upon his sword.

âYou will answer for this insult,â he said.
âI would have you know that Mistress Carew
is my affianced wife.â

At this, Betty came forward, her face white
but her eyes on fire.

âI call you all to witness the baseness of
this man,â she said. âWhen I was yet unborn
a dishonorable and wicked contract was made
that he now claims against me. I utterly
repudiate it, and my uncle, Sir William Carew,
of Mohunâs Ottery, doth uphold me. I swear,
and Heaven is my witness, that I would rather
mate with the veriest beggar at Saint Paulâs
Cross than wed with this man!â

âAnd none but a coward and a villain would
pursue so base a claim!â said Raby; and drawing
off his embroidered glove, he struck it
full upon Sir Bartonâs face.

[182]
In an instant Hengeâs sword flew from the
scabbard; but Sir Francis Bryan, springing on
him as suddenly, snatched it away and snapped
it asunder.

âHell and damnation!â cried Sir Barton, âI
will have satisfaction.â

âNot here or now,â exclaimed Bryan, in a
tone of authority.

But even as he spoke, they were startled by
a shriek so shrill, so agonized, that their hearts
stood still.

ââTis the queenâs voice,â screamed Mary,
forgetful of everything but her beloved mistress.

âHelp!âtreason, treason!â shrieked the
queen, in a tone of anguish.

They dashed up the stairs, jostling each
other in their eagerness; but Mistress Wyatt
outstripped them all, and was the first to enter
the mysterious chamber. Here a strange sight
met their eyes. It was a large square room,
the roof of glass and the walls hung with
crimson. There was no furniture in it but a
great mirror that was opposite the door. In
the center of the place stood Queen Anne; she
had dropped her mantle and mask, and was
revealed in her splendid dress of white and
silver; her long hair had escaped its bonds
[183]

and hung wildly about her deathlike face.
She looked more like a corpse than one alive,
save for her eyes, which were dilated with the
terror of a mad woman. Before her, calm and
unruffled, stood the strange figure of the wizard,
looking at her in mild surprise.

âTreason!â she cried again, as her attendants
burst into the room; âhe is a traitor!
Seize him, gentlemen, bind him, in the kingâs
name!â

Raby already had his hand on the wizardâs
collar and had drawn his sword, but Sanders
was calm.

âHer grace is overwrought,â he said coolly.
âShe asked to look into the future; I but
obeyed her behest.â

âGodâs death!â shrieked the queen, with a
recurrence of her anguish, âhe would have
slain me, gentlemen!â

âMadam, I do beseech you, do me justice,â
protested the wizard. âI laid no finger on
you, nor intended harm to a hair of your royal
head. Your grace should believe that I can
but reveal, and not alter destiny.â

The queen stood a moment staring at him
wildly, and then, despite Mistress Wyattâs
supporting arm, she fell forward on her knees,
pressing her hands over her face.

[184]
âAlas!â she said, âthe sight will kill
me.â

âCall the Captain of the Guard,â cried Lady
Rochford; âthe villain hath bewitched the
queen; she faints, she dies!â

Both Mary Wyatt and Betty were supporting
Anneâs sinking form.

âMadam, I pray you remember that you are
the Queen of England,â whispered her favorite,
looking in agony at the white face of her
mistress.

âThe traitor has poisoned her!â exclaimed
Sir Francis; âhe shall hang at Tyburn!â

âI swear I have not harmed her,â retorted
Sanders, casting an anxious glance at the
stricken woman.

Aroused by Mary Wyattâs passionate entreaties,
Anne opened her eyes, and seeing the
wizard held by Raby and the furious faces of
her attendants, she rallied her sinking powers.

âLoose him,â she said faintly. âI was mad
at a fearful vision; I would not have this
matter bruited abroad; men shall not jeer at
Anne Boleyn.â

Making a great effort, she rose to her feet,
and stood, supported by her maids.

âSir Wizard,â she said coldly, âhas it
availed to conjure hell to fright a feeble
[185]

woman? I forgive you, but âtis my mercy
shelters you from the wrath of my lord the
king.â

âHe shall to jail, madam!â exclaimed
Raby.

âNay, I charge you, loose him and depart
with me,â she said, with sudden majesty of
demeanor; âit was my folly to come here.
Lend me your aid, Cousin Francis; my limbs
tremble beneath me, but my heart is stout.â

She took but two steps, however, before she
tottered, so that Bryan almost carried her from
the room, followed by her maids like a flock of
startled pigeons. As they departed, Henge
stepped in front of Raby.

âAt what hour and place, sir?â he asked
fiercely.

Raby laughed scornfully. âTo-morrow at
sunrise, at the tryst beyond the palace park,â
he answered lightly, and ran down the steps to
overtake the royal party.

When he reached the water-gate, the almost
unconscious queen had been already laid in
the stern of the barge, her head resting in the
lap of Mary Wyatt. And the slow journey
back began in silence, the attendants all being
too alarmed for conversation. The moonlight
still shone upon the waters and fell full on the
[186]

deathlike face of Anne Boleyn, but there was
no sound save the soft dip of the oars in the
river.

A few hours later, her three maids of honor,
Lady Rochford, Mistress Gaynsford, and Betty,
sat around the fire in the anteroom of the
queenâs chamber, anxiously awaiting tidings of
her condition. Within, an old and skilled
nurse and Mrs. Wyatt labored to still Anneâs
hysterics. For she had wept and laughed at
intervals ever since she regained consciousness.
They feared to call the court physician, lest
the escapade should reach the ears of the king,
and it was long before the royal patient sank
into repose. Her cries and weird laughter
had been hushed for half an hour, when the
door opened silently, and Mary Wyatt came
out with a look of horror on her face. So
strange was her expression that it hushed the
anxious inquiries upon the lips of the others.
She came to the fire, and falling on her knees,
gazed into it while she told her story in a
strange voice, and the superstition of the age
held her listeners in a spell of terror.

âShe has told me all,â she said; âthat evil
manâthat prince of devilsâcast her horoscope,
and told her that her end would be as
much in shame and misery as her present
[187]

state was lofty. This, pretending that he
knew not the queen, the lying jackal! Then
he caused her to look into that mirrorâyou
saw it opposite the doorâhe told her that it
was enchanted and would show her her life.
He chanted an incantation while the poor lady
looked and saw, she says, every event of her
life; and some, she swears, were known to
none. She saw her childhood at Hever; her
journey to France with Queen Mary; her
sojourn there at court, with Mary and with
Queen Claude. She saw her life in Catherineâs
court, the love of the gallant Percy,
Wolseyâs interference; the visits of the kingâs
grace to Heverâshe saith it was the kingâs
very face and walk before he had the swelling
in his legs. Then she beheld the glorious
pageant of her coronation; saw herself, young
and lovely, kneeling to Cranmer for Saint
Edwardâs crown. After this a black veil hung
over the mirror; the wizard knelt and mumbled,
making passes, when of a sudden the veil
lifted, and she sawâoh, heaven! why took I
the queen to such a devil?â For a moment
Mary Wyatt was choked by sobs, and then
she whispered the rest, so low that the others
knelt about her to hear, all their faces stricken
with awe of the supernatural.

[188]
âShe saw,â continued the sorrowful woman,ââshe
saw the Tower green, and by the block
were my lord privy seal, the Duke of Norfolk,
his grace of Richmond, the kingâs son. From
the Tower came Sir William Kingston leadingâthe
queen herself. âTwas her face, her
form, her gait, her image, clad in black with a
white cape upon her shoulders, and behind her
came I and three others weeping. She saw
herself speak, kneel down, and as the axe fell,
she shrieked in mortal agony; and in a moment
the mirror was blank, and no one with her but
the conjurer.â

[189]

CHAPTER XVI

MY LADY CRABTREE TO THE RESCUE

In
the gallery adjoining the apartments of
the queen, Simon Raby waited for tidings of
her condition, and also for a glimpse of Mistress
Betty. Francis Bryan had been called
away to attend upon the king. Henry had
returned to Greenwich, but made no inquiry
for his consort, for of late they had met only
in public.

Raby walked alone in the lofty gallery, pacing
to and fro, with his arms folded on his
breast and his head bent in thought. He
came of a brave race, and showed it in his gallant
bearing and the fine expression of his face.
Trained from boyhood for a soldier, as every
English boy was in those days, he had seen
service both in France and Ireland, and was
esteemed a courageous and keen-witted officer,
if somewhat reckless. Reared in a worldly
school, he had led a gay and careless life; but
there were too fine elements of manhood in
him to be choked by the evil that in many
[190]

natures, under such influences, shoots up more
rapidly than the good. None of his family
were living except his father, and death was
soon to sever that last tie. Among all the
beauties of the court who had won his fancy
and even touched his heart, none had ever
seemed so charming as the penniless orphan
whom fate had made an attendant upon Queen
Anne. His admiration kindled by the beauty
of Bettyâs face had swiftly grown into the proportions
of a far deeper passion than he had
ever known, and his generous nature, too, was
touched by the peculiar hardships of her situation.
For forgetting her lack of dower he
deserved no great credit, since a man like
Barton Henge could also be completely dazzled
by the young girlâs personal loveliness.

As Raby walked there in the gallery, he
gave no thought to his appointment with
Henge; a duel was a matter of too common
occurrence in his adventurous life to be of any
particular moment. He was an expert swordsman,
and his contempt for his adversaryâs
character was so great that he underrated his
skill and regarded him as no very dangerous
foe.

After the queenâs return, her shrieks were
audible even in the place where Raby walked;
[191]

but they were hushed at last, and in the
stillness he heard the great clock of the
palace striking twelve. He went to a casement,
and throwing it open, looked out upon
the night. The moon was setting and a few
soft clouds drifted above it; below, the park
was full of black shadows, and in the distance
the hounds of the royal pack bayed in a melancholy
monotone. The strange adventures of
the evening might well have stirred hardier
nerves, and Raby shared the superstitions of
the times. The weird black and white outlines
of the scene oppressed him; it seemed to
him that a calamity hung over the palace, and
the queenâs wild cries still rang in his ears.
He closed the casement sharply and turned just
as the door opened, and Mistress Carew came
in alone. A glance at her pale face told him
that something unusually painful had occurred.

âHow fares the queen?â he asked eagerly.

âShe sleeps at last,â Betty replied; âbut
she has been in a grievous state, crying and
laughing like a mad woman, and would take no
comfort. She told her fearful vision to Mistress
Wyatt, and âtis no wonder that she is so
distressed;â and with an awed face and agitated
voice she went on to tell Raby of the mirror
and its dark revelations.

[192]
âI remember,â she said, in conclusion, âthat
he made this prophecy to Queen Catherine at
Kimbolton, or something very like it; and
when her maids would have upbraided this
queen, she said that they would soon have
cause to pity her and lament her case.â

âSome estrangement there is between the
kingâs grace and Queen Anne,â Raby answered
in a low tone; âbut I take it for a loversâ
quarrel, and no more. As for this vision, that
wizard should be jailed for it. What need
had he to so torment the unhappy lady?
Doubtless he is of the party favoring the Lady
Mary and would right gladly drive the queen
to madness. Conspiracy is everywhere, and
the death of Catherine has but discouraged it
for a moment; the papists are openly discontent,
and there is a great faction among the
nobility, who hate my lord privy seal. We
may be sure that this wizard is among the
plotters, and had I any doubt of it, âtwould be
removed by the appearance there of Henge,
who, I believe, is up to the elbows in these
treasons, albeit he hath yet the ear of Cromwell.â

A wave of color swept over Bettyâs face at
the mention of the obnoxious name.

âMaster Raby,â she said, with embarrassment
[193]

in her tone, âI have to thank you for
coming to my aid this night, but I was most
unhappy to provoke a quarrel between you and
that man, who is unworthy of your notice.â

âAnd did you dream that I would stand by
to see you annoyed by the rogue?â he answered
lightly; âI would sooner break his neck.â

âAnd I would not grieve were it broken,
sir,â she said, âthough I would not rejoice to
cause the death of any man, however vile.
Master Raby, I pray you, let the matter go no
further; there is no need for you to accept a
challenge from a rogue.â

Willing to conceal the true state of affairs,
Raby smiled.

âWe will not speak of that which pains you,
Mistress Carew,â he said cheerfully. âA flogging
at Saint Paulâs Cross would better serve
the knave than to meet a gentleman, albeit
Henge is of noble blood.â

Mistress Betty gave him a searching glance.
Accustomed to the clash of swords and to many
a wild scene in Devon, she had but few feminine
fears, yet her heart throbbed at the
thought of a sword-thrust in the breast of this
brave gentleman.

âYou are going to fight him,â she said in a
low voice, âand for me. Alas! I was both
[194]

foolish and wicked to provoke the quarrel; sir,
I pray you to forbear.â

Their eyes met, and she saw a light shining
in Rabyâs that a duller woman could have read.
A sweet confusion made her stand blushing
like a timid child.

âAnd if I draw not my sword in your quarrel,
for whom shall I draw it?â he said in a softer
tone. âFear not, Mistress Carew, the rogue
shall have a just chastisement; âtis not worthy
of a thought of yours, yet I rejoice to think
that what I do is not a matter of indifference
to you.â

Betty looked up bravely. âSir,â she murmured,
âI shall never forgive myself if you
take hurt in my cause. I pray you let him go;
âtwas you who were the aggressor, and there
can be no dishonor in counting the matter too
unworthy for your notice. For my sake, since
I made the offence, I do beseech you leave the
quarrel to oblivion.â

Raby took her hand and kissed it passionately.
âFor thy sake, mistress, I would do
all save lose my honor,â he whispered tenderly.

Betty drew away her hand with a crimson
face just as Mary Wyatt and Lady Rochford
came from the queenâs room, and so interrupted
the tender little scene.

[195]
âMaster Raby, I pray you do me the courtesy
to bear this missive to Sir Francis,â Mrs.
Wyatt said in a weary voice; âand then I
trust that we may all sleep sound till morning
dawns, and so try to forget this agony.â

âHas the king come?â asked Lady Rochford;
âthey told me that his grace came late
last night.â

âAnd so he did, madam,â Raby replied, as
he took Mary Wyattâs missive and, with a
salutation which included all, although his eyes
sought Bettyâs, he left the gallery to do his
errand.

âTo bed, to bed!â said Lady Rochford,
when the three women were alone; âI am
well nigh faint for lack of sleep.â

As they walked together to their chambers,
Betty turned thoughtfully to Mrs.
Wyatt.

âWhere was the kingâs grace to-day?â she
asked in a low voice.

âI know not,â retorted Mary Wyatt, in a
bitter tone, âbut doubtless with that trollop
Seymour!â

Betty asked no more questions, but went to
her own room and said a prayer for the protection
of Simon Raby from the man she hated;
and after tossing for a while upon her pillow,
[196]

fell asleep at last, as the first light of the
winter morning dawned in a gray sky.

A little later, when the sun was rising, its
rays shining but faintly through the heavy
mist that was hanging over the scene, making
the tall trees of Greenwich Park loom like
spectral giants through the folds of vapor,
Simon Raby set out alone to keep his engagement
with Sir Barton Henge. Armed only
with his rapier and muffled in a heavy cloak,
he walked leisurely away from the palace, and
proceeded through the more lonely portions of
the park toward the river. His depression of
the night before had passed with the darkness;
Queen Anneâs vision concerned him too little
to disturb his thoughts longer. As he passed
beyond the immediate vicinity of the palace,
he quickened his steps. Even at that early
hour there was the stir of a great establishment
awakening; he met a company of cooks
and scullions running toward the royal kitchens,
and several messengers rode out post-haste, for
the dayâs errands began early.

The spot appointed for the meeting was on
the outskirts of the park near the river, and
took Raby through the loneliest places. The
morning fog cut off his vision beyond a short
circuit as he advanced under the trees, and
[197]

after a while all sounds from the palace ceased
to reach his ears. His path grew narrow as he
came in sight of the river and was surrounded
by a low thicket where the underbrush had not
been cleared away. The beautiful face and
dark eyes of Mistress Betty filled his mental
vision, and he walked on, careless of possible
danger from a treacherous foe; it was not in
his nature to take any precaution for his own
safety. He was scarce twenty yards from the
trysting-place when there was a crackling of
dead branches on either side of him, and two
masked men sprang out upon him. Unprepared
as he was for the onslaught, he was too bold a
soldier to be disconcerted, and his sword flew
from the scabbard. Being swift of foot and
agile, he evaded the heavier of his two assailants,
and getting his back against a tree, made
a fair defence. But it was two to one, and he
had small chance to escape, and saw it. In
the desperate struggle which ensued, he had
no time save to parry the blows which were
aimed at his throat. Then, remembering that
he was near the river and boats might be passing
even then, he shouted twice for help even
while he fought with the courage of despair.
The black masks with holes, through which
shone the eyes of his assailants, their silence
[198]

and their determination began to work upon
him, and the cold perspiration stood out on his
face. But with marvellous firmness he beat
back their swords, the gleaming points of
which began to dazzle his eyes. Once more,
though sore spent, he shouted, and now there
was an answer, a cry from the direction of the
river. At the sound of it the stouter of the
two villains turned and fled into the thicket,
evidently having no mind to encounter a reinforcement;
but the other engaged Raby the
more fiercely. However, it was now an equal
struggle, and Simon was giving thrust for
thrust when a party of strangers broke through
the thicket from the river side and the mask
received so sharp a blow on the back of his
head that he fell prostrate. Looking across
the body of his stricken assailant, Raby recognized
with amazement the manly figure of Lady
Crabtree, her farthingale looped high and displaying
her huge boots, while a stout staff was
clasped in the great fist that had dealt the
blow. Behind her were a group of her attendants
and some watermen, all gaping at the
scene in wide-mouthed curiosity.

âWhat gear is this, Raby?â she demanded,
and stirred the unconscious man with her
foot.

[199]
âA small matter, madam,â responded Simon;
âtwo villains would have murdered me.â

At this, the fallen man began to move; and
Lady Crabtree, bending down, tore the mask
from the handsome dark face.

âHenge!â she exclaimed; âa pretty business
and a pretty rogue! Now have we a
chance to deliver him to the provost. Here,
fellows, lend your hands and put this gentleman
murderer in the barge.â

âStay, madam,â said Raby, âthis is my
quarrel; let the villain go. He hath forfeited
all right to meet a gentleman upon equal
terms, and if you drag him into court, he will
but blow abroad a matter which concerns a
noble lady. Let the brute run to his kennel.
He comes to himself. Is this your way to fight,
Sir Barton?â

Henge staggered to his feet with a muttered
curse, and groped about for his sword.

Old Madam pointed to the path that led
from the palace.

âLook you, Barton Henge,â she said; âhere
be men enough to lay you by the heels, and if
you stir a finger, your throat will be slit,
despite this gentleman who spares you. Go!âand
swiftly, for my fingers itch to rap your
pate again, you villain!â

[200]
âA curse upon you!â answered Henge, as
he prepared to obey, having no alternative;
âfor once you have outwitted me, but the
devil take me if you do it again!â

My lady laughed a shrill, discordant laugh.

âHe hath you, friend,â she said; âgo to the
wizardâs house upon the Thames and worship
him!â

Henge gave her a strange look and walked
sullenly away without a reply.

ââTwas a chance thrust,â said Lady Crabtree,
âbut it hitâsome deviltry is brewing in
that hole, and I be not mistaken.â

[201]

CHAPTER XVII

BETTY AND HER CHAMPION

Raby
would gladly have parted with old
Madam at once and made his way on foot to
the palace, for he did not wish to be seen in
his disordered dress, and there was blood, too,
on his face, from a slight cut upon his forehead.
But she was not of the same mind; she
would not let him go back alone after his
encounter, but scolded and badgered him in
her own fashion, until she forced him into her
barge. And there she questioned him sharply,
trying to draw from him the cause of the
attack which Henge had made; but she failed.
Simon kept his own counsel; he was as determined
to keep Bettyâs name out of the matter
as the old woman was resolved to trace it back
to her, for she had suspected at once the true
state of affairs. It was an encounter of wits,
for old Madam was as keen as a needle, and
Raby was no fool. Back and forth the subject
went, thrust and parry, until the boat stopped
at the water-stairs, and there Simon lost no
[202]

time in making his escape. Lady Crabtree
was bound for London, intending to return at
noon to Greenwich; so he evaded her, at least
for a season. Waving his adieu, he turned
from the river and made his way swiftly toward
a side entrance of the palace. The morning
was now well advanced, and avoiding a group
of courtiers, he came at last to the quadrangle
court; and here, to his surprise, he met Mistress
Carew. She had just come out, roused
from her slumbers by her anxieties, and a glance
at Raby told her the story of his morning journey.
Her quick eye detected the blood that
he had failed to wipe away entirely, and she
stopped him with an imperious gesture.

âYou are wounded!â she cried, her tone as
full of emotion as he could desire; âwhat have
you done?â

ââTis but a scratch,â he answered lightly;
âa little water will soon remove the traces
of it.â

But she was not to be put off so easily.

âYou have been fighting with Henge!â she
exclaimed. âI felt it, and I am thankful that
it is no worse.â

âYou do not inquire into his fate,â Raby
rejoined, smiling, âyet you know not what
it is.â

[203]
âNor care,â she answered, her eyes sparkling
with anger; âsir, he was unworthy of
your steel.â

âThat I know now, Mistress Carew,â Simon
said heartily; âuntil a few hours ago I believed
him, after his own fashion, a gentleman,
save for his pursuit of you, and for thatâexcept
the manner of itâthere is an excuse.â

âHe is too base a man to be aught but a
coward,â said Betty, scornfully. âBut that
cut upon your forehead,â she added in a
changed tone, âI grieve to see it; you must
call a leech.â

Raby looked at her with a smile, and his
expression brought the color to her cheeks.

âMistress Carew,â he said softly, âyou told
me the prophecy, and was it not natural I
should strive for a scar?â

âBut I told you also that I liked it not,â she
answered archly.

âAy, but, then, what if the prophecy held?â
he said, still smiling. âI thought it safe to be
on the winning side.â

âAlas, sir!â she exclaimed, âI fear that
your heart has already too many scars; add not
one only to your face.â

She had stepped back a little and was laughing
and blushing, her face framed with the
[204]

furs that muffled it. He thought her charming,
and her wayward mood pleased his fancy.

âAh, mistress!â he replied, âmy heart has
left my keeping, therefore I have only my face
to scar, unless you give me back the other.â

Betty looked down demurely.

âMaster Raby,â she said, âI have been with
two queens, and both have warned me about
the hearts of men. One called them ships
that rode uneasy at their moorings, and the
other, quicksands. After such goodly advice
and wise discourse, verily, sir, I have my
doubts about the matter also.â

âThen there is greater reason for you to
listen to a truthful argument,â he answered,
smiling; âthese poor ladies manifestly have
not found a faithful heart.â

âThat is the very point of the matter,â Betty
answered quickly; âare any faithful?â

âAy, surely,â he answered more earnestly;
âand mineââ

âHush!â exclaimed Betty, softly, âlook yonder,
sir, and judge a manâs heart by the kingâs.â

Raby turned quickly, following the direction
of her glance. A door on the opposite side
had opened, and Henry was coming out, followed
by two of his attendants. The king was
cloaked, but his figure could not be mistaken;
[205]

and when Simon turned, he had paused upon
the threshold and was looking up at a window
above him. At the casement was the figure of
a woman, and she waved her hand to the king
as he looked up. Henry threw her a kiss and
walked on, followed by his equerries.

ââTis not the queen,â remarked Betty softly,
as the party passed around and out of the
quadrangle.

âNay,â replied Raby, gravely, âit was Mistress
Seymour.â

For a moment neither spoke; both were
thinking of Queen Anne in the wizardâs house,
both heard again her shriek of terror.

âAlas!â said Raby; âpoor lady! I fear
there is some truth in the whispers of the
court.â

Betty looked at him with a sparkle of mischief
in her dark eyes.

âSir,â she said, âI fear that you have no
very true witness for a manâs loyalty; you will
need a better proof.â

And she made him a little curtsy as she
turned to go back into the palace.

âStay!â cried Raby, eagerly; âI said not
that a king should be the standard. Why,
mistress, a royal heart cannot be measured
with that of a plain, honest man.â

[206]
Betty laughed archly, still retreating.

âIs a king, then, the only knave?â she
asked.

âThere is one heart that waits for you to
test it, Mistress Carew,â Simon answered, following
her, his face flushed and his eyes upon
her laughing ones; it was no longer jest with
him, but she evaded him.

They had reached the door which opened
into the private way to the apartments of the
maids of honor, and here he was forced to halt.
She, too, paused an instant, with her hand
upon the latch, and looked up with serious
eyes, her whole manner changing in a moment.

âMaster Raby,â she said gently, âI thank
you from my heart for the part you have taken
this morning in my quarrel. Believe me, sir,
the orphan is not ungrateful to her gallant
champion.â

Before he could reply, she was gone, and he
stood looking at the door with a glowing face.
She had bewitched him and he believed that
she was not indifferent to him, but she could
sustain her manner of gay pleasantry, and was
as skilful as he in the trifling talk which made
even a serious matter seem of little weight.

He turned, at last, to find his way to his
own apartment, determined to bring Mistress
[207]

Betty to consider the question at a more propitious
moment; but he was destined to wait
many days for the opportunity. When he
reached his room, he found a messenger with a
summons for him to come without delay to see
his dying father. There was no time for leave-takings;
he had to secure the kingâs permission
to depart, and when that was obtained,
was forced to set out with no better satisfaction
than a note of farewell to Mistress Betty.
Not knowing how carefully she kept that missive,
he went with but poor comfort upon his
sad errand.

[208]

CHAPTER XVIII

A ROYAL LOVE TOKEN

That
strange house upon the Thames, with
its receding upper stories and its many windows,
had strange visitors. Not in the daytime;
then its numerous eyes were often
blinded with iron shutters, and only the owlâs
head above the door, which opened on the
street, indicated the office of its master, as did
the owl upon the water-gate. At nightfall
came the never-ending stream of visitors, and
usually by the river entrance, though there
were other doors; one, indeed, opening through
a labyrinth of cellars into a subterranean passage
which had its outlet somewhere by the
waterâs edge, and whose key was hidden in the
wizardâs breast. The master of the house quite
naturally was much sought, being, by repute,
the greatest necromancer in England and
shrewd enough to work upon the fancies of the
common people, dealing out philters and horoscopes
with a liberal hand; but his real business
was of a deeper and darker nature. Men
[209]

of all conditions came by night to that silent
house, and often one party dreamed not of the
presence of the other, although the strange,
small man held intercourse with both. In the
lower portion of the building, with no communication
with the stairs by which the queen
had entered, was a large plain room, furnished
with a long table and many chairs; and the
ceiling was dark blue, set with gilded stars, so
it was called the wizardâs Star Chamber.
Here were frequently assembled a large company,
and here the dealings were free from
sorcery; they savored of a deeper and more
subtle matter. Here, sometimes, were peers
of the realm, the vacillating Lord Hussey,
Darcy, and, less frequently, my lord of Exeter,
and, once or twice, the master of horse, Sir
Nicholas Carew. On one occasion, too, appeared
the pale, fanatical face of a poorer
gentleman, Robert Aske, who was to lead in
the Pilgrimage of Grace. In this secret
chamber of the secret house festered conspiracy,
undiscovered even by the falcon eye
of Cromwell. Here were represented the
remnant of the party of the White Rose, the
infatuated followers of the Nun of Kent and
the papists, who flocked to the secret meetings
where Poleâs book against the king was known,
[210]

before the king saw it, and was eagerly
devoured; where the popeâs bulls were quoted,
while the name of Mary Tudor was coupled
first with the dauphin and then with Charles V.
The possibilities of resistance to the crown,
the downfall of Cromwell and the Archbishop
of Canterbury, the kingâs increasing
corpulence and the sores upon his legs,âall
these matters were fruitful of discussion,
and in the midst of the malcontents, the
dwarfish figure of the master of the house
flitted about with fiendish activity. It was in
his nature to love the brewing of so evil a
caldron, and he was happiest when he could
count the greatest number of the peers caught
in his net. Yet, if he was sincere in anything,
he was in his devotion to the hope of a
revival of the old rÃ©gime. Through the length
and breadth of the kingdom spread the tendrils
of conspiracy, while the strong hand of the king
was on the helm of the ship of state, guiding it
through troubled waters to a liberty of which
he, despot that he was, had no conception.

Through the months of that short winter, the
procession to the wizardâs Star Chamber continued
and waxed nightly larger, while at
Greenwich the king and queen lived estranged,
and the gossips of the court were busy with a
[211]

matter that they whispered only on the back-stairs
or in the chimney-corners, while the
beauty of the queen waned under the frown of
fortune. A cloud hung over the gayeties of
the court, while she was nervous, anxious, ever
suspicious of those about her, and time passed
heavily with the young maids and court rufflers,
and there was much secret grumbling. Master
Raby was still in Sussex; his father was dead,
but the new Lord Raby could not leave the
estates unsettled, and he had not yet returned.
My Lady Crabtree, however, had published
such an account of the affair in the park that
Henge was forced to keep in retirement, and
for a while, at least, Betty was free from
annoyance.

April came, and Latimer, the Bishop of
Worcester, was at Greenwich for a time, and
in the chapel preached a mighty sermon to the
unhappy queen. The king was absent, and the
suite of Anne Boleyn filled the space around
the pulpit. The great bishop spoke in a clear
voice, bearing fearless witness to the queen of
the errors and the sins of a worldly life and
the penitence by which alone she might hope
to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, where her
earthly majesty would be a shackle to her
immortal soul. The preacher lifted his voice
[212]

courageously to call an erring woman to repentance.
Latimer saw the truth too plainly,
and was too honest to bear false witness,âa
great man whom the great cardinal plucked
from the burning, seeing those qualities of
soul which a strong mind recognizes even in a
foe, and Wolsey saved him to be the martyr of
bloody Mary.

Queen Anne left the chapel weeping, and
going to her apartments, bade Mary Wyatt
bring her Tyndaleâs translation of the Bible, the
book that her intercession with the king had
saved from the fagots. About her stood her
maids of honor, and while she sat thus with
the open Testament before her, tears in her
eyes and her whole manner full of agitation,
the door opened to admit a young and beautiful
woman. In contrast to the pale face of the
queen, the luxuriant beauty of the new-comer
seemed dazzling; her features were perfectly
regular, while her eyes have been called
âstarryâ in their luster. At the sight of her,
Anneâs face changed instantly; she rose, and
advancing to the center of the room, looked at
her haughtily. The young woman was splendidly
dressed, and wore a girdle of pearls at her
waist, and on her neck a great jewel, which
attracted the eye of the queen.

[213]
âWhat have you there, Mistress Seymour?â
she exclaimed sharply, indicating the gem.

Jane Seymour drew back with a flush of
mingled embarrassment and indignation.

ââTis but a gift, madam,â she said, faltering
under Anneâs searching glance; ââtis
naught of importance. Iââ

The blush, the stammering tone were alike
fatal to an attempt at evasion; the queen
snatched at the jewel and tore it from her
rivalâs throat with such vehemence that she cut
her hand upon the clasp and the blood dropped
on her dress. She took the ornament, and
looking on the reverse side, found a curiously
contrived spring, which opened to reveal a
beautifully painted portrait of the king. For
one moment she stood transfixed, such an
expression on her haggard face that her attendants
shrank back and the fair Seymour was
covered with confusion. Then the furious
nature of Anne Boleyn roused her from her
womanly dismay; she turned upon the maid of
honor like a lioness at bay, her wrath bringing
a terrible beauty to her face and her eyes
blazing with fury. She hurled the bauble at
Jane Seymour with such force that it fell
shattered at her feet.

âGo!â cried the queen, pointing to the
[214]

door, âget from my sight, you accursed traitress,
and take the image of your paramour
away with you!â

âMadam, I pray youââ began Jane.

âBegone!â said Anne, her impassioned
voice ringing through the room; âdoubtless
the king awaits thee. Lie not to me! let me
not see thy face again!â

In her resistless fury the queen towered like
an avenging spirit, and Jane Seymour could
only gather up the fragments of her sovereignâs
love token and retreat in deep confusion.
Anne Boleyn watched her until the door closed
behind her, her own pose full of queenly dignity
and injured womanhood; but when the
rival beauty had withdrawn, a great change
swept over Anneâs features; she turned, and
seeing her favorite friend near her with a face
full of sympathy and indignation, she fell
weeping on her neck.

âOh, Mary, I have sinned!â she cried in a
voice of anguish; âoh, my God! is my punishment
to be administered in like measure with
my sin?â

[215]

CHAPTER XIX

THE JOUSTS AT GREENWICH

It
was the first of May; the trees in Greenwich
Park were budding with the tender tints
of spring, and the short turf was studded with
the little daisies, pink and white, and the
hawthorns were in bloom, while from the
hedgerows came the music of the birds. In
the lists at Greenwich the silver trumpets
blew. The heralds proclaimed the names of
the challengers and challenged in the tournament.
The royal gallery was hung with cloth
of gold, and the king and queen sat there
together, in apparent concord; yet there were
dark whispers in the palace, there had been
a secret session of the privy council at Whitehall
a few days before, and a gentleman of
the kingâs household had been committed to
the Tower. But outwardly all was gay for
the great festival of May Day. Banners floated
over the lists, pennants of dyes as varied as
the rainbow, while from the galleries hung rich
[216]

tapestries and wreaths of flowers. Garlands
decorated the canopy above the head of Anne
Boleyn, garlands lay on the gallery balustrade
before her, and she was robed in all the splendor
of a queen. Her surcoat was of scarlet
and gold brocade, and her mantle of cloth of
gold was lined with ermine, while on her coif
was a circlet of rubies, the same which she had
worn on that Whitsunday when she received
the crown. Unusually pale, but beautiful, the
queen leaned forward in her chair to watch the
tilting, while beside her sat the king, seeming
to share her interest in the games. He also
was arrayed in a regal fashion, his dress of
purple velvet slashed with white satin and his
breast covered with jewels, which sparkled
also in his low-crowned velvet hat, in which
were set white ostrich plumes. The strong
face of the king was slightly clouded, though
he smiled, and his tawny eyes flashed with the
fiery spirit of his race. About the queen stood
her maids of honor, Mistress Wyatt, Mistress
Gaynsford, Betty Carew, and many more; and
in the rear was the tall, square-shouldered
Lady Crabtree, who had that day asked Anneâs
leave to take Betty away to Wildrick, pleading
some excuse in response to the queenâs inquiries.
Permission had been given, and when the festivities
[217]

were ended, Mistress Carew would
depart for a while from court.

With the braying of trumpets and the sound
of music, challenger and challenged rode into
the lists,âthe queenâs brother, Lord Rochford,
and Sir Henry Norris, who had been one
of the witnesses of Henryâs secret marriage
with the Marchioness of Pembroke in the attic
turret of Whitehall. Both the contestants
were fine riders, and expert with sword and
lance; the first encounter called forth a burst
of applause. Men shouted, women waved their
handkerchiefs, and the queen let hers fall from
her hand into the lists. Before the eager host
of sycophants could reach it, Norris had it,
and pressing it to his face, presented it on the
point of his lance to Anne. There was a
moment of silence; the king rose with a dark
frown and, followed by a few of his confidential
attendants, left the gallery without a word
or a glance at his consort. At the barrier of
the lists, the royal officers arrested Lord Rochford
and Sir Henry Norris upon the charge of
high treason. In an instant the bright scene
was changed; the trumpets ceased to sound,
men flocked together, speaking low, the jousts
were stayed, the women stared affrighted at the
queen.

[218]
âThe king! the king!â was whispered;
âwhat doth ail the king? Something has happened,
some mischief is ripe! The Northern
Counties must have risen! My lord privy seal
is murdered! These gentlemen have poisoned
the Princess Elizabeth!â

Almost a panic reigned below, while in the
gallery the queen rose with a white face and
withdrew, followed by her women. In half an
hour the lists were vacant, the garlands hung
wilting in the sunshine, the idle crowd trailing
off full cry after some new scandal. The news
had spread that the king was gone to Whitehall
and with him the prisoner Norris. Tales that
had been whispered began now to be told aloud;
fingers were pointed at the windows of the
queenâs rooms; idle gossips watched upon the
water-stairs for possible arrivals from London,
and the superstitious remembered signs and
sounds. A step had been heard upon the
palace stair at midnight, yet no one ascended,
though the heavy tread came through the
gallery before the door of Anne Boleyn; it
had so walked at that of Catherine, and at the
threshold of the hapless Anne of Warwick,
queen of Richard III. One old wife had seen
Death riding on a tall white horse through the
park in the full light of noonday. Another,
[219]

who had heard the Bishop of Worcesterâs great
sermon at Paulâs Cross, had been in terror
ever since, lest England should fall away to the
Bishop of Rome, so valiantly had his lordship
preached against friars and abbots, and the like.

Meanwhile the queen was in her own apartments.
Although deeply disturbed by the
kingâs anger and abrupt departure, she bore
herself with composure, talking quietly with
her women, speaking not at all of the arrest of
her brother. Her maids flocked about her
startled, dismayed, and each suspicious of the
otherâs fidelity, except the few who were close
to the person of the queen. Never was a May
Day so full of trouble since the Ill May Day
when the poor apprentices of London rose in
Queen Catherineâs time to be butchered by
the Duke of Norfolk.

Night came at last, but sleep visited but
few in the palace, and the morning found
many haggard faces about the queen. Yet the
suspense continued; the daily life at Greenwich
moved on as usual, men and women tried
to smile and made ghastly jests. The king
came not again, and noonday brought no tidings.
Dinner was spread in the royal apartments,
and Anne sat down, attended by her
maids of honor and the servants of her own
[220]

household. The customary greeting from the
king, âMuch good may it do you,â came not,
and the queenâs face paled as she glanced at
the sorrowful women about her. More than one
had tearful eyes, and all failed to respond to
her attempted pleasantry.

âMary,â she said, turning to Mistress Wyatt,
âwhat ails thee? One would think that a
deathâs head grinned upon the board. âTis a
dull hour and my maids are red-eyed; truly,
it seems that they might make some jest to
entertain the queen.â

âOh, madam!â exclaimed Mary Wyatt,
bursting into tears, âI cannotâI am ill.â

âIll?â repeated the queen, sadly; ânay,
my girl, not ill, but fearful. I knew not that
thy blood was so weak. When Anne Boleyn
sees danger approaching, her heart beats with
a bolder pulse; she feels that she is sprung of
a warlike race which is not so ill a match for
the Tudors. Come, come, Mary, dry thy
tears; the May sun is shining; it is almost as
fair a day as that first of June on which I made
my progress through London.â

âI pray that it may shine on you with greater
blessing, madam,â replied Mistress Wyatt,
drying her eyes.

The queen looked down the long table; at
[221]

the end one of her old servants stood weeping;
on either hand were pale faces, even Betty
Carew had lost her splendid coloring.

âMistress Carew,â said Anne, âwhy is your
face so long? I do not think you love me,
yet your cheek is wan. Is my case, then, like
the queenâs at Kimbolton?â

There was a rustle, a stir of amazement, but
the words were spoken.

âMadam,â said Betty, in a low voice, âbetween
the ill and suffering lady who died
yonder and your graceâs youth and health there
can be no comparison.â

âMy Lady Crabtree takes you to Deptford,â
said Anne, quietly; ââtis well. I would not
bring disaster upon one so young, and who has
no cause to love me.â

âI pray your grace to let me remain,â Betty
cried, her generous spirit stirred; âI would
not leave you in the hour of trouble.â

âTrouble!â the queen laughed hysterically,
âwho speaks of it? âTis gay, a festival at
Greenwich. Hark!â she cried suddenly,
âwhat is that?â

The stir of an arrival in the antechamber,
the great doors thrown open, the voice of the
usher announcing his grace of Norfolk and the
lords of the Privy Council.

[222]
Anne rose from her seat with a low cry.

ââTis a message from the kingâs grace,â she
cried joyfully; âmy lord hath sent to comfort
me for the arrest of my sweet brother.â

She stood with a white face, her splendid
dress disordered, her beautiful hair unbound.
Her ladies clustered about her, but leaving a
space in which she stood alone; behind were
her frightened servants. Toward this group
came with slow steps, as if their errand was a
heavy one, her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk,
Cromwell, the Chancellor Audley, and others
of the Council. The queen looked at them
with dilated eyes, her breast heaving, and her
expression changing from expectation to terror
as her glance fell on Sir William Kingston,
the Lieutenant of the Tower.

âMy God!â she cried in a low voice, âthere
is death in their looks!â

Then she added aloud, âMy lords, why come
ye here?â

âMadam,â replied Cromwell, sadly, âwe come
at the kingâs command to conduct you to the
Tower, there to abide his highnessâs pleasure.â

Mary Wyatt with a scream clutched at the
queenâs robe, but in this supreme moment
Anne regained her self-command. She put
her devoted maid aside and stood alone.

[223]
âMy lords, if it be the kingâs pleasure,â she
said, âI am willing to obey.â

The Duke of Norfolk ordered her attendants
from the room that she might be examined
privately by the Council.

âUncle,â said the queen, sadly, âfrom thy
hands I might look for more tender usage.â

Before she left the room, Betty Carew
approached the unhappy woman; the young
girlâs generous heart beat high and her dark
eyes sparkled with anger. She saw here only
a repetition of the blow that had smitten
Catherine of Arragon.

âMadam,â she said in a low voice, âif it be
your wish, I will go with you to the Tower; I
would not leave you now!â

The queen was deeply touched; she took a
ring from her finger and placed it in Bettyâs
hand.

âNay, Mistress Carew,â she said gently, âI
also can be generous; thou art young, go in
peace. Mary Wyatt and my other maids may
presently come to me; now I am the kingâs
prisoner. Farewell, fair girl, I pray thy
beauty may not bring thee to so evil a case.â

[224]

CHAPTER XX

IN THE APPLE ORCHARD

My
Lady Crabtree hurried Mistress Betty
from Greenwich. At sunset of that fateful
day, the two went by water to Deptford. The
barge glided gently along the placid river;
the soft spring air was full of fragrance and the
banks of the Thames on either hand were clad
in a mantle of varied green, while above the
blue sky was flecked with rosy clouds. Betty
and old Madam sat in the center of the boat,
and the young girl was silent and manifestly
unhappy. After casting one or two of her
eagle glances at the beautiful, downcast face,
Lady Crabtree accosted her with her accustomed
frankness.

âWhat ails you, wench?â she asked sharply;
âyou had no love for this queen when you were
sent to her, and now you pull as long a face as
ever you did for the Lady Catherine.â

âI had only condemnation for her when I
went first to Greenwich,â Betty answered,
ânor do I love her as does poor Mary Wyatt,
and a few of the others also; but it seems a
[225]

cowardly thing to leave her nowâit hurts me
to seem a time-server.â

âTush!â retorted the old woman, calmly,
âthe queen cares naught for you. Nor would
they let you go if you would. They took her
to the Tower without even giving her time to
change her farthingale,âlike men it is to do
it so,âand I hear that the kingâs grace will
have her aunt, Lady Boleyn, and Mrs. Cousins,
whom she hates, attend her. Doubtless they
will strive to wring some confession from her,
poor thing!â

âShe is charged with high treason, so Mary
Wyatt told me, weeping,â Betty said; âbut the
whole matter has been conducted so secretly
that the unhappy lady knows not the charges.â

Lady Crabtreeâs stern face stiffened.

âThat may and may not be,â she retorted
dryly; âAnne Boleyn has been more foolish
than ever she was wise. The greatest fool was
she to think that the man whom she had made
unfaithful to his wife would be faithful to her.
Poor shallow pate! she but taught him the
door by which he should slip out. Well, well,
there will be a great trial, and what will my lord
of Wiltshire do?â

âThe queenâs father?â Betty said; âalas,
poor gentleman!â

[226]
âAlas, poor ass!â retorted Lady Crabtree;
âyet was he clever enough to wring a promise
from the kingâs grace to marry Mistress Anne
before Queen Catherine was put away. They
tell a tale of his visit to the Bishop of Rome,â
she added, laughing. âThe king sent him upon
this business of the divorce, and he, getting
there, refused to kiss the popeâs toe. âTis
added that his dog bit it, in which case it is
no great wonder that his highnessâs cause
suffered at Rome.â

âMy Lady Rochford does not love the
queen,â Betty remarked thoughtfully, ânor
does the queen love her.â

âThere is gossip about her as a witness
against Anne,â old Madam replied, âbut there
is scandal enough now to raise the stones of
the palace. âTwas the rumor of this matter
that reached your uncle through his kinsman,
the master of horse. Whereat I get a letter,
writ in haste, to tell me to propound some
excuse to get you to Deptford. William
Carew must take me for a liar; that I never
was, because I could not cover one without
a thousand, and it is a weariness to the
flesh.â

There was a pause between them; they were
approaching Deptford, and Bettyâs mind was
[227]

full of those last melancholy hours with the
unhappy queen.

âHast seen thy lover, Henge, of late?â
Lady Crabtree asked, as they reached the
landing.

Betty raised her head haughtily. âI pray you
call him by some other name,â she said coldly;
âI am happy that I have not seen him.â

âAnd did Master RabyâI beg his pardonâLord
Raby not tell thee of the game in
Greenwich Park?â

A deep blush came into Bettyâs face.

âI saw Lord Raby but once before he went
away,â she answered, âand he told me but
little, albeit I have heard much since.â

Taking a grim pleasure in the recital, Lady
Crabtree told the story of the ambush and the
rescue, and her sharp eyes did not lose a blush
or quiver of the face beside her.

ââTis a mercy that the matter is so ended,â
Betty said in a low voice; ânow I think he
will scarcely dare to show his face again.â

Old Madam laughed harshly. âLittle you
know of Barton Henge,â she said; âhe will
remember the injury and the disgrace until he
has avenged it. Lay no such unction to your
soul; he is a devil and he will do a devilâs
work.â

[228]
With these threatening words still ringing
in her ears, Betty went with a heavy heart to
take up her life again with this strange woman.

For a while, however, all hearts were absorbed
in the terrible tidings that came from
London. The indictment and the trial of a
Queen of England, the pitiful spectacle of a
woman who had sacrificed all to obtain a crown
now forced to such a shameful ignominy. The
minds of honest Englishmen were stunned;
the sadness of the fate of Catherine was as
nothing compared with this.

Moved by pity for the wretched queen, awed
by the recognition of the fearful workings of
retribution, Betty Carew was filled with amazement,
sympathy, unbelief. Finding small
matter in common with old Madam, the young
girl was much alone. Sitting in her own
room, which overlooked the river, or walking
through the garden and orchards of the manor
house, her mind found plenty of food for reflection.
In a few short months she had attended
two queens, each doomed to misery,âone a
sternly virtuous woman, dying as a Christian
should; the otherâshe could not think of
Anneâs great beauty, the attraction of her
manner, without commiseration. She had seen
her in a brief hour of triumph at Catherineâs
[229]

death; she knew that it was commonly reported
that her malice had pulled down the great
cardinal, but she could only think of her in
her distress; she heard still her shrieks in
the wizardâs house, her anguish at the sight of
the kingâs gift to Jane Seymour.

Betty had been ten days at Deptford, and
one morning walked alone in the apple orchard.
Beneath her feet the soft green turf was broken
here and there by the gnarled root of an apple
tree; overhead the low boughs made a network,
white and pink with bloom, and through
the beauty of the fragrant blossoms she saw
the soft blue sky, and before her, through the
trees, was the river. The birds sang with
the joy of the spring. She went on down to
the river bank, and watched the wherries going
to London; then, as she came slowly back, she
looked up and saw, coming through the avenue
of trees, a stalwart figure, and a face she knew.
She had not seen Simon Raby since that
morning in the quadrangle court, and she
blushed a little as she saw the glad look on his
face. But she had profited by her lessons in
the world, and she met him with an air of
demure dignity.

âYou are welcome, my Lord Raby,â she
said gravely; âyou have been long in Sussex,
[230]

and I was sorry that you went on so sad an
errand. Sir, I am an orphan too, and do commiserate
your case.â

Despite his black garments, Simon Raby was
wearing a cheerful countenance, having been
long separated from his father, a close-fisted
man, whose only love was gold, which had
made his son run to the opposite extreme.
Having little in common, Raby had not felt
his loss too deeply; but at this speech from
Mistress Betty, he pulled down his face and
tried to make a proper answer, although all the
while he was thinking how radiant was her
dark beauty in the white gown she wore, and
what a picture she made with the apple-blooms
overhead and in her hands. And she knew
his thoughts well enough, but chose to turn
the talk away.

âHow long have you been back in London?â
she asked, arranging her flowers; âwe have
been ten days here, but at this dreadful time it
seems much longer.â

âAlas, poor queen of a day!â Raby said
compassionately; ââtis a great misfortune for
this realm, nor do we see the end of it. I
came back but yesterday, and heard the tidings
at an inn. They stunned me; I could not
believe it until I made inquiries of the matter.
[231]

âTis said that my lord privy seal sent for Sir
Francis Bryan, but he is quit of it. And
Archbishop Cranmer wept; he hath a gentle
heart. I thought of the wizardâs house, Mistress
Carew, and of the shrieks of the queen.
âTis a marvellous thing, and makes an honest
man shun the bandy-legged creature. I passed
that house as I came on the river; the shutters
were open and the windowsâverily, they
shone like evil eyes in the sunlight.â

Betty shuddered. ââTwas a fearful place,â
she said, and added: âI owe you a debt, Lord
Raby. My Lady Crabtree told me more of
that encounter with Henge than ever you did.â

Rabyâs face flushed as he laughed.

âIt was a petticoat rescue,â he said, âof
which I have little cause to be vainglorious.
Hath the villain troubled you again?â

âNay,â Betty answered, âthough my lady
tells me that he will avenge his grief. I pray
you, beware of this dangerous foe.â

âI would right cheerfully encounter more
such in your cause, Mistress Carew,â he answered
softly, and then added after a brief
pause, âI was not only in Sussex; I have been
down to Mohunâs Ottery.â

âTo my uncle?â asked Betty, in surprise.
âHow fared they all?â

[232]
âWell, and sent loving greetings to you,â
he replied. âCan you not divine my errand,
Mistress Carew, down there in Devon?â

Betty looked up archly, but meeting the
ardent glance of his brown eyes, looked down
again and colored like a rose.

âNay, sir,â she said, âI never yet could
read a riddle.â

A soft breeze shaking the bough overhead,
some apple blossoms dropped upon her like a
fragrant snowfall.

âI saw your uncle, Mistress Carew,â Simon
said softly, âand I pleaded my cause with him
and won it; âtis for you to condemn me now,
or bless me.â

They stood near the high wall of the orchard;
it was very still, and Mistress Betty kept her
eyes upon the ground.

He put out his hand and took hers gently;
his manner was tender as to a child; her stately
beauty did not make her a great lady in his
eyes, he saw beyond it the tender heart.

âMistress Carew, Betty,â he said softly, âI
have no scar upon my brow.â

At this, a smile stole over Bettyâs rosy face
and she gave him an arch glance.

âYou might have had one, sir, but for my
Lady Crabtree,â she said roguishly.

[233]
He kissed her hands. âI love you,â he
whispered tenderly; âwill you make me happy,
or must I go hence with a heavy heart?â

âMy Lord Raby,â Betty said quietly, âI
see my uncle and my Lady Crabtree coming
through the orchard; did my uncle come with
you?â

âI must have my answer,â he exclaimed,
between hope and doubt, still detaining her
hand though he heard the others coming.

âBethink you,â she said proudly, âI should
be but a portionless bride.â

âTo me the noblest and the richest in the
kingdom,â he exclaimed.

She looked at him with radiant eyes.

âSir,â she said roguishly, âmy uncle calleth
thee!â

[234]

CHAPTER XXI

A MESSENGER FROM LONDON

In
the strange house upon the Thames, the
wizard entertained a guest in a small, dark
room upon the lower floor. There was a low
chimney in the corner, and on the hearth some
logs were burning; over it was swung a kettle,
the steam issuing from its iron lips proclaiming,
by its unsavory odor, some tea of herbs.
On the table in the center of the room were
two sealed packets, one large, the other small,
and near this table sat the wizard and his
friend, Sir Barton Henge. The outer shutters
being closed, there was no light in the place
except the red glare of the fire which flickered
on the faces of these two, and cast their
shadows magnified upon the wall behind. A
strange couple, strangely fitted for mischief.

âAnne Boleyn is sentenced,â Henge said
moodily; âmy lord of Northumberland was
carried fainting from the court.â

âLet the drab die!â retorted the wizard,
with indifference; âas for Percy, he is a
[235]

fool. In spite of all, he is firm for the king
and Cromwell; there are others whom we will
get. Yet this womanâs death will go far to
heal the differences between this realm and
Rome; the pope but fears the emperor, and
the emperorâs aunt is now avenged. Happily,
however, the visitation of the monasteries sets
ill on the stomachs of the common folk.â

âHow like a spider you are!â said Henge,
watching him. âSitting here, you weave and
weave until one fly and then another is caught
in the meshes of your web, and then you gloat
over the victimâs struggles.â

âAs you will gloat,â remarked the astrologer,
âwhen your victim is caught in the snare
that you are setting.â

His dark companion started and looked at
him uneasily. Even in his bold heart there
lurked a secret dread of this dwarfish creatureâs
power; the shining eyes, the keen, fox-like
face were full of cunning, wit, relentless purpose,
and Henge knew it.

âWhat hints are these?â he said roughly.
âI am not a man to plot as you do; I am no
schemer, but an open foe.â

The wizard laughed unpleasantly, lifting his
brows with a look of incredulity.

âAn open foe?â he remarked placidly; âso,
[236]

so, âtwas open in the park that morning, but
wherefore the masks, Sir Barton?â

Henge sprang up with a curse.

âYou spying devil!â he cried; âhow came
you there?â

At this the little man laughed long and loud,
rocking to and fro on his stool, tears of merriment
gathering in his eyes, while his fellow
conspirator stood staring at him like a wild
beast at bay.

âI was not there,â he said at last, wiping
his eyes, but shaking still with laughter,ââI
was not there, or I might have engaged my
Lady Crabtree; an equal match we would have
made. Sit down, my son, âtis no time for
such quarrels; I know too much, too much!â

Henge stared at him, his hand fondly fingering
his sword.

âAy, curse you!â he said, between his
teeth; âyou know too much, but so do I, Sir
Wizard!â

âOnly that which would cost you your head
long before it harmed a hair of mine,â the
little man replied calmly, while he rose and
stirred the beverage in the kettle.

âWhat devilâs broth is that?â Henge cried,
turning away in disgust; âit stinks like some
filthy gruel brewed for death.â

[237]
âNay,â said the wizard, smiling, ââtis not
poison; thought you to see me boiled like
Richard Rouse? When this is thoroughly
compounded, the smell of it stealing in a manâs
brain will make him forgetful for a space;
âtwill be useful to you, and the cost is trifling
for the purpose, a hundred guineas.â

Henge shuddered. âI have no use for it,â
he said hoarsely, âwhile I have a sword or a
knife. Keep your devil messes for your richer
clients.â

Suddenly there was a deep boom, and the
house shook, the windows rattled.

The wizard took from the table a wine-glass
which stood filled, and raised it in the air.

âMy Lady Anne, once Queen of England,
your health!â he said, and drank it.

Henge watched him with a look of dread.

ââTis the signal that she is beheaded,â he
said with a ghastly face; âwhy drink the
health of a dead woman?â

The little man grinned. âWhy not?â he
asked. âI may the sooner conjure her to
speak to thee.â

âThe fiend take thy conjuring and thy
visions!â exclaimed Henge, uneasily; âkeep
them to frighten petticoats.â

Sanders chuckled maliciously. âYou have
[238]

a great scorn of petticoats since a woman
rapped your pate,â he said.

âCurse you!â cried Sir Barton; âbecause
you have me in your power, would you insult
me? Did you send for me to-day for this sole
purpose, your amusement?â

âNay,â retorted the wizard, calmly, âyou
came for your instructions. Yonder lie the
packets,âone to carry to our friends in Yorkshire,
where, my lord privy seal having so
roughly handled the jury, they are ripe for us;
the other packet, being on your person, may be
found, if need be, âtis but a bluff.â

âA likely errand,â said Henge, bitterly,
âwhen Cromwellâs spies are thick as harvest
gnats. Verily, I thank you, Sir Wizard, but I
made no such bargain.â

Sanders put out his hands with a deprecating
gesture.

âAs you will,â he said grimly; âthere are
others, and doubtless if your visit to the Lady
Mary was knownââ

Henge sat staring at the packets; in his
mind had flashed a scheme so devilish that he
was fascinated. For the moment, even the
wizardâs covert threats fell on deaf ears; suddenly
the possibility of vengeance, on a larger
scale than he had dreamed, intoxicated his
[239]

brain. The scheme was born full grown; he
had but to execute it.

âI will take the packets,â he said, wetting
his dry lips with his tongue; âI did but jest.â

The wizard regarded him uneasily; something
in the sudden change of manner displeased
him, yet he knew the man to be too
deeply committed for retreat.

âYou have a pleasant way of jesting,â he
remarked dryly, âa gentle playfulness. What
is your haste?â

Sir Barton had risen and gathered up the
packets.

âThe fumes of your vile drug intoxicate
me,â Henge said curtly; âI must breathe in
the open air or choke.â

The wizard smiled and gazed fondly at his
kettle.

ââTis useful stuff,â he replied, âmost useful.â

Sir Barton took up his cloak and sword,
eager to be off.

âSome day you will fall into your own caldron,â
he remarked; âbut I tell you, Sanders,
that I will not be there too.â

The little man rubbed his hands, laughing
wickedly.

âHow can you know? âTwould be a warm
[240]

meeting,â he said, and stood still laughing
when Henge closed the door upon him.

At Deptford, on that fair nineteenth of May,
the household at Wildrick waited for tidings.
In the warm sunshine they stood upon the
terrace facing the river,âold Madam, Sir
William Carew, Betty, and Lord Raby.

âThere was some confession to my lord of
Canterbury,â Carew said, walking to and fro
and looking curiously at the river; ââtis hoped
that a bill of divorcement may save the
sentence.â

âIf she be guilty, she deserves the sentence,â
remarked Lady Crabtree, sternly; âif she be
innocent, she should stand acquitted. She
was tried by her peers.â

âI would it were not a woman,â Sir William
said uneasily. âI like not the death on the
block of a woman and a queen.â

âWould you rather burn her?â asked old
Madam, coolly. âI know not why a woman,
being wrong, should be less punished than a
man, or more so. Men are quick enough to
break a womanâs heart, but over-squeamish
about breaking her neck.â

âYonder comes your messenger,â Lord Raby
said, pointing to the river, where a wherry had
[241]

stopped at the water-gate and a manservant in
Lady Crabtreeâs livery was seen disembarking.

The messenger came up the terrace, and
pausing in front of the group who waited so
eagerly for tidings, he lifted his cap.

âThe Lady Anne Boleyn died on the Tower
green at noon to-day,â he said in a monotonous
tone; âthe kingâs grace will wed to-morrow
the worshipful lady, Jane Seymour. Parliament
will meet to pass a new Act of Succession.â

There was a silence; Betty turned and went
weeping into the house. Simon Raby played
nervously with his sword. Sir William looked
about him with a stern face.

âHe is the King of England,â he said with
stubborn loyalty, raising his hat. âGod save
the kingâs grace and give the realm a prince!â

âAy,â retorted my Lady Crabtree, bitterly,
âand God pity his wives!â

[242]

CHAPTER XXII

MY LORD PRIVY SEAL

Lord Raby
and Mistress Carew walked up
and down the terrace before Wildrick Hall,
while at the water-stairs a barge waited to take
him to Whitehall. Her white gown fluttered
in the soft breeze as she walked, and in her
eyes shone the light of the spring sunshine.

âI go to arrange my affairs,â he said, âso
that I may ride with you and your uncle to
Mohunâs Ottery to-morrow. Happily, there is
naught to detain me else, dear heart. I fear I
should forget my duty for your sake.â

Betty smiled. âYou will need to be prompt,â
she said lightly; âmy uncle waits for no man
and is ever beforehand with time.â

ââTwould be a shame on me to be a laggard
at such a time,â he answered. âAh, Betty,
how different the world looks when love
touches it with golden fingers! I do think
that I bear no man malice or ill-will, but rather
would be friends even with mine enemies, but
never with thine.â

[243]
A cloud passed over her face. âI pray you,â
she said slowly âremember to avoid Barton
Henge. My Lady Crabtree predicts that he
will yet endeavor to do us some great mischief,
and it makes me uneasy for you.â

âFear not for me, my love,â he replied
tenderly; âand as for you, surely the love that
enfolds you shall ward off this snake. But I
will be mindful of your fears, albeit I think he
will avoid me as he would a pestilence.â

âI know not,â she said, shaking her head;
âmy heart is full of misgivings when I
think of how he set upon you like a cut-throat.â

âAnd I cannot but rejoice that you are
anxious,â he said softly, âsince it shows that
my safety concerns you.â

She looked at him with a tender light in
her eyes.

ââTis more to me than my own,â she said
very low.

He kissed her hand passionately, although
Sir William Carew was coming down the walk
toward them.

âYour love,â he said, âhas made a new life
for me. I swore when I left Raby Castle that
I would not return until I brought it the fairest
mistress in all England.â

[244]
âAlas, sir,â she answered, smiling, ââtwas
a foolish oath, and not likely to be fulfilled.â

Without regarding their feelings, Sir William
Carew cut short their talk, which might
have continued long; for they were lovers, and
knew how to make much of a little matter.
He held a package of papers in his hand, sealed
with red seals, and gave it to Raby.

âI would have that sent by a sure hand to
Cromwell,â he said; âit pertains to some
matters of the county of Devon and claims his
eye, yet is not so important that I need take
it in person.â

âIt shall be delivered directly,â Raby replied,
putting it in his breast; ââtis time I
went, doubtless you came to remind me.â

âAy,â Carew answered, smiling; âI remember
the days when I lingered so. It is nearly
noon, however, and you were to have gone an
hour since.â

âMy excuse is so admirable that I deserve
forgiveness,â Simon said, laughing; but he
hastened his farewells, and in a few moments
he and Sir William were walking to the water-stairs
together, while Betty waved her handkerchief
from the terrace.

âYou have your rogue yet with you, I see,â
[245]

Carew remarked, his eye lighting on Rabyâs
groom.

âShaxter?â Simon replied, smiling; âay, I
had forgotten your prejudice. He is a useful
fellow.â

âHe looks it!â said Carew, with a shrug;
âfarewell, and forget not the packet.â

Looking back as the barge swept away, Raby
saw the tall white figure on the terrace and
the fluttering of her handkerchief. The picture
of the great stone house, the green slope of the
terrace, and the beautiful girl waving him farewell,
framed itself in his mind and was a solace
to him in the months which followed.

He was so light-hearted that he whistled to
himself as the boat went on to London. The
river was full of water-craft, and the scene was
gay. The same river that had borne the unhappy
Anne Boleyn to the Tower smiled in
the sunshine and rippled gleefully from the
strong strokes of the oars. Life was full of
sweetness to Simon Raby, and he sat in the
boat with a smiling face and a ready greeting
for any chance acquaintance. In the afternoon
he would go to my lord privy seal in person,
now he had matters of his own to attend to.
He must go to his haberdasherâs and his
barberâs; he had a dozen errands, and presently
[246]

found dust upon his clothes and went to his
old lodgings to change them. Shaxter was
with him as usual and helped him to make the
change; he put on a rich suit of satin with a
short cape of velvet, and bidding his attendant
remain in his apartments until his return, made
his way down the stairs alone and opened the
street door. Looking out into the road, he
saw no one, and came out humming a new
song, popular at court. He had taken but two
or three steps when three men stepped out
from under an adjacent arched doorway. They
barred his progress, and he looked in surprise
to recognize the captain of the watch.

âWhat now, Ludlow?â he said; âI need a
little leeway to pass your company.â

âMy Lord Raby, you are arrested!â was the
reply, as the officer laid a heavy hand upon his
shoulder.

Raby drew his sword. âYou villain!â he
said, âthis will be a sorry jest for you.â

âI arrest you in the kingâs name,â repeated
the captain, sharply; but so angry was Simon
that for a moment they grappled, and the
officerâs assistants were forced to take part in
disarming the furious nobleman.

âOf what avail is this resistance, my lord?â
cried Ludlow. âI tell you, as your friend, you
[247]

had best submit. I was ordered to take you
and must, sorely against my will.â

âUpon what charge?â demanded Raby,
fiercely; ââtis an evil time if an innocent
man may not walk safe upon the streets of
London.â

The captain shrugged his shoulders. He
was a kindly, honest man, but he could only
discharge his office.

âI have the warrant for your arrest, my
lord,â he answered soberly, âfrom my lord
privy seal; but the reason of it?â he raised
his brows, âyou must ask the man who set the
trap, not him who merely springs it. Verily,
Lord Raby, I trust it may be no great matter,
for your own sake. Mayhap you know well
what folly brought it.â

âNot I,â said Simon, angrily; ââtis an
insult. Where are you taking me, Sir
Captain?â

âTo my lord privy seal,â he answered,
glancing with some compassion at the prisonerâs
indignant face; âbelike he has some questions
to ask. But come, here I linger talking like
a featherpate, and Cromwell waits. I would
have left you your sword, my lord, but that
you were so thirsty for blood.â

âI will go quietly,â Raby said, in great
[248]

perplexity and wrath; âit was foolish to fly at
thy throat for nothing, but it makes my blood
boil.â

âFor that I do not blame thee,â the officer
replied, âthough it doth usually make a manâs
blood run cold.â

âYou speak for a guilty man,â said Raby,
sharply; âno honest man would shiver at an
insult.â

There were but few more words exchanged,
the little company closed up about the prisoner,
and the walk through the streets was a rapid
one. Many stared, and some insulting jests
were made. It was no uncommon sight; disloyalty
was rife enough to make the arrest of a
nobleman a matter of usual occurrence. They
passed some of the gay young gentlemen of
the court, who looked aside on seeing their
acquaintance in such company. He was taken
to Cromwellâs house, and waited but a little
while at the door before he was brought before
him.

Cromwell was in his private room sitting at
a table by the window, and a large mass of
papers lay before him. It was his custom to
apply himself closely to business, and much of
it was transacted by his own hand. Here was
a man who held the threads of many conspiracies,
[249]

whose falcon eye was peering into every
secret lurking-place from Landâs End to the
Tweed, whose relentless grip closed on the
traitor like a vise. His back was to the light
where he sat, so that his strong face was in the
shadow, but his penetrating eyes were bent on
Raby at his entrance with a not unkindly look.

âMaster Raby, I had it in my mind to send
you some advertisement of my regret at your
fatherâs death,â he said gravely, âwhen this
charge was lodged against you, to my infinite
surprise.â

âSir, I am ignorant of the cause of my
arrest,â Raby replied, ânor can I imagine
what accusation has been made against me.â

âYou are charged with high treason,â Cromwell
said, turning over some papers before
him, âhaving conspired with certain persons
against the safety of the realm, and the life of
the kingâs grace.â

The expression of amazement deepened on
the prisonerâs face.

âMy lord,â he said, âI am dumbfounded; I
have been absent more than two months in
Sussex, busy with the settlement of my fatherâs
estate, which, as I think you know, was much
in need of my administration. As for consorting
with conspiratorsâyou, who have known
[250]

me from my boyhood, should know the folly of
the charge. I thought my loyalty to the kingâs
highness was established by faithful service.
This accusation is but the baseless falsehood
of mine enemies.â

âMy Lord Raby, my heart inclines to believe
you; I have ever held a good opinion of your
family,â Cromwell rejoined, âbut the nature of
this charge doth not allow it to be overlooked.
But ye shall have an ample hearing. Sir,
there is a strange house here upon the Thames,
I think you know it,âI see you do,âthe
house of the wizard, Zachary Sanders. You
were there one night this winter, and upon
what business?â

Rabyâs face had changed at the mention of
the wizardâs house; the shrieks of Anne Boleyn
had a strange trick of haunting him.

âI was there indeed,â he said frankly, knowing
no harm could come now of the truth,
âwith Queen Anne and her ladies. It was an
unhappy whim of the queenâs, and the wizard
caused her to see so evil a vision that I was
near seizing him as a traitor; would, indeed,
have delivered him to the guard but for her
grace, who would not have the matter known,
fearing the kingâs displeasure at her folly.â

Cromwellâs face clouded at the mention of
[251]

Anne. He had seen her die, sent to perform
that duty by the king, and the man who had
been faithful to Wolsey, in the misery of
Esher house, was not without compassion.

âWhat was the queenâs vision?â he asked
moodily.

âShe saw her life, and her death upon the
block,â Simon replied; âand the poor lady
was thrown into such terror that she would by
no means be quieted, and for hours her shrieks
were heard at Greenwich. By Saint Thomas!
they ring yet in my ears.â

Cromwell was silent for a while; evidently
the frankness and sincerity of Raby, together
with his previous knowledge of him, made it
difficult to reconcile the man with the
accusation.

âI will be frank with you, sir,â my lord
privy seal said, at last; âI make no effort to
conceal the perils of this realm, you know
them. My Lady Mary Tudor, by her stiff-necked
attitude toward the kingâs grace and
the Act of Succession, hath made herself a
stumbling-block, and a point round which the
malcontents may gather. Then there are the
papists, ever stirring in the cause of the Bishop
of Rome, and with these the country gentlemen,
who detest the breaking up of the monasteries
[252]

and the abbeys, with no profit to
themselves, and the travelling friars, and, God
wot, I know not who, to stir up mischief
which would bring us swift to civil war. At
such times, my Lord Raby, I may not be
lenient. The charge against you is so grave
that I would have you make a clean breast of
the matter. You came to town this morning
from Deptford; what was your errand?â

Raby thought at the instant of Sir Williamâs
packet and put his hand in his doublet and
drew it out.

âMy lord, I came to attend to some matters
of my own, of a petty nature, but mainly to
attend the kingâs grace and also to give you
these papers.â

Cromwell stretched out his hand for the
packet and broke the seals without waiting for
further explanation from Lord Raby. He
unfolded the wrappers and began to go through
the papers without making any comment.
Simon, watching his grave face, read nothing
after the first quick flash of surprise. Of the
nature of Carewâs communication, Raby was
ignorant, but believing it to refer wholly to
affairs in Devon, he did not greatly concern
himself about it. His mind was but too
actively engaged with the state of his own
[253]

fortune. His arrest had been so sudden, so
entirely without reason, that he found no immediate
solution of his difficulty. He noticed
that Cromwell, with all his apparent frankness,
held back the full substance of the charge
against him, and the names and condition of
his accusers. Secure in his own innocence,
Raby did not doubt his ultimate exculpation,
but he knew not what course to pursue, whose
name to mention, fearing to drag others into
his misfortune. While these thoughts passed
rapidly through his mind, Cromwell was deeply
engaged in the perusal of Sir Williamâs
packet; every paper was carefully examined
and some were read twice over. Simon began
to think that Carewâs business would indefinitely
prolong his own suspense, when the
kingâs minister looked up. However, he did
not address Raby; his face was inscrutable;
he touched a bell upon the table and immediately
an attendant replied to the summons.

âCall Captain Ludlow,â he said calmly;
then turning to Raby, he looked at him with
cold eyes. âSir,â he said, âyou gave me the
wrong packet.â

Simon returned the look with surprise.

âI had but the one, my lord,â he said.

The officers had entered at Cromwellâs orders.

[254]
âIf you had but one, you did a strange thing
to give it to me,â said my lord privy seal; then
to the captain of the watch, âLudlow, remove
Lord Raby under strong guard to the Tower to
await his examination.â

Taken by surprise at the entire change in
Cromwellâs manner, Simon was about to say
that the papers were from Carew, when a
second thought made him hesitate. If Sir
Williamâs name was not upon them it would
be strange indeed, and he did not wish to
bring him under greater displeasure.

âMy lord,â he cried, âI pray you to remember
that I was but the bearer of those papers;
I am ignorant of their purport.â

Cromwellâs face was both incredulous and
unrelenting.

âYou are not the man to bear such papers
ignorantly, Raby,â he said harshly; âwho
gave them to you?â

Simon started; then Sir Williamâs name did
not appear. A horrible doubt assailed him,
but he was a man of stubborn loyalty to his
friends. He closed his lips; if his silence
could shelter Carew it was well, especially
since he was groping in the dark.

Cromwell, who had waited one impatient
moment for his answer, smiled grimly. He
[255]

had seen too many men turn traitors to feel
amazement at the aspect of one.

âYou are tongue-tied,â he said sternly,
âIt may be we must enforce the matter from
you,â he added, touching the papers; ânever
saw I a greater batch of treason in so little
space.â

âMy lord, I am innocent!â exclaimed
Raby; âIââ

âRemove the prisoner,â Cromwell interrupted
coldly, making a sign to his officers,
and returning to his work without another
word or glance at the nobleman.

A short while afterwards, Simon Raby entered
at the water-gate of the Tower, and its
gloomy doors closed upon him, shutting out
the beauty and the fragrance of the summer
world and separating him from the woman he
loved. The kingâs prisoner, charged with high
treason, had little cause to rejoice in his lot.

[256]

CHAPTER XXIII

MISTRESS BETTY USES HER WHIP

Tidings
of an arrest for high treason travelled
but slowly. The movements of the government
were swift and secret. A man might be
pounced upon, examined, committed to prison,
and his own family be unconscious of his situation.
It was a golden opportunity for the false
witness; for the public gratification of private
malice. The marvellous stories told at the
trials showed the luxuriance of the popular
imagination.

No intimation of Lord Rabyâs fate reached
the household at Deptford. He had been
expected to return almost immediately, but he
came not, and his absence was attributed to
some unlooked-for business. At first, Sir
William threatened to set out for Devon without
him, but seeing his nieceâs disappointment
and remembering that Raby had accepted a
commission from him, he decided to wait,
although he chafed under the delay.

[257]
The third day after Rabyâs departure, Mistress
Betty was riding through the fields behind
Lady Crabtreeâs house. She had been out with
her uncle and was returning alone by a short
cut, leaving Sir William some distance behind,
engaged in conversation with an acquaintance.
The meadow through which Betty rode lay
behind the orchards and was skirted on the
right by a copse of beech-trees. She was
walking her horse and had come nearly to the
middle of the field, when a man stepped out
from the shadow of the trees. At first, taking
him for one of old Madamâs household, she did
not notice him, and it was not until he had
fairly placed himself before her horse that she
recognized Sir Barton Henge. Her animal
stopping of its own accord, Henge caught the
bridle and for the moment held her prisoner.
She was not naturally fearful and her only
feeling was one of indignation.

âLet go the bridle, sir!â she said angrily;
âwhat right have you to stop me?â

âI have tidings for you, fair mistress,â Sir
Barton replied, with an evil smile upon his
handsome face; âtidings of my Lord Raby,
which are for your ear alone.â

âSir, loose my horse!â she cried, vainly
endeavoring to drive the animal forward or to
[258]

one side, but Henge was too strong for her
and held the creatureâs head.

âYou seem not over-anxious to hear tidings
of your lover,â he said mockingly; âyet it may
be that you will presently find it difficult to
get any more.â

Something in his manner, more than his
words, drove the blood to her heart. What
had this wretch done? Where was Simon
Raby? Yet so little was she like other women
that she forbore to cry out or ask a question.
She sat her horse like a statue, her face white
and her great dark eyes fixed on her tormentor.
She scorned him, scorned even his power to
injure her, and he saw it and hated her the
more; for between this wild passion, that such
men call love, and hatred there is but a single
step. Her beauty set his blood on fire, her
scorn of him awoke every evil impulse in his
breast and made him long to humble her.

âSo,â he said, with keen anticipation of
the pain he had in store for her, âyou have no
questions to ask, and Simon Rabyâs fate is a
matter of indifference to you? âTis well; it
would be a shame to spoil those bright eyes
with tearsâeven for a lover.â

She set her teeth and struck her horse upon
the flank; the animal plunged, but Henge
[259]

held him yet. She looked back wildly for aid,
but she could not see her uncle. What folly
had made her ride on alone?

âWell, well, I must tell you,â Henge said,
smiling in evil triumph, âsince you are too
shy to ask. Lord Raby is in the Tower.â

She knew the man to be a villain, yet something
in his manner convinced her that he
spoke the truth. Rabyâs long absence was
explained, and a chill of horror crept over her,
but her pride sustained her resolution.

âHe was taken the day he left you here,â
continued Henge, a little baffled by her manner
and her silence; âhe is charged with high
treason and is like to suffer for his sins. All
these years he has but fawned upon the kingâs
grace to betray him. A traitor and a pretty
rogue, this lover of yours, Mistress Carew!â

Wrath overcame Mistress Bettyâs womanly
fears; in her right hand she held a stout whip,
and she sat upright in her saddle, looking like
a beautiful young fury.

âYou knave!â she cried; âyou lying knave!â
and she struck him full across the face, below
the eyes, with such sudden violence that he
relaxed his hold, and her horse plunging, set
her free, and dashed away across the field,
while Sir Barton Henge stood staring after
[260]

her, a curse upon his lips and on his face the
great red welt that followed her lash. And she,
riding to the house, dismounted, and running
into the hall, fell on her knees before old
Madam, and hiding her face in her lap, cried
out that Simon Raby was in the Tower.

âYea, I know,â said my lady, calmly, âand
they have taken the wizard, Zachary Sanders;
âtis a pretty mess. Come, my wench, tears
will not mend the matter nor unlock the jail.â

As she spoke, Sir William came in, fresh
from a gallop across the fields, and smiling;
but at the sight of Bettyâs white face and the
frown between old Madamâs brows, he stopped.

âWhat means this?â he asked; âyou look
as if you had seen a corpse-light.â

âThere be tidings from London,â Lady
Crabtree answered; âLord Raby hath gone to
the Tower accused of high treason.â

Amazement tied Sir Williamâs tongue; he
seated himself opposite his cousin and waited
for an explanation, his honest face much
clouded. Lady Crabtree spread out a letter
on her knee and prepared to read the
news.

âThis comes from Mistress Gaynsford, Queen
Anneâs maid,â she said, her open hand resting
on the long roll of parchment; âshe is
[261]

a gossip, but I doubt not the truth of the
matter.â

âLet us hear it, Zenobia,â Carew returned
impatiently.

âShe says of the arrest,â began my lady,
reading, ââLord Raby was taken on a charge,
secretly preferred to my lord privy seal, and
on examination, a packet was found on his
person, filled with treasonable papers, and
exposing the network of a huge conspiracy.
Many names were on a list therein; whose we
know not, but Cromwell and the kingâs grace
have the papers, and doubtless many tremble
in the fear of apprehension. No one knows
where the lightning hath struck or who is
spared, but âtis said the gentlemen in the
northern counties are many of them singed.
The strangest part of the matter is that there
runs a story that Raby gave this budget to my
lord privy seal himself with every show of
innocence, and when it was thought that he
did it through an error, having two upon his
person, he was searched, but none other was
found; and what madness made him give this
to Cromwell, no man can devise.ââ

ââTis passing strange,â remarked Sir William;
âwhere was my packet?â

ââThese papers,ââ continued old Madam,
[262]

reading, ââcontained such full betrayal of the
wizard Sanders, who so frightened the late
queen, that the order for his arrest was
given. The fashion in which he was taken
will furnish you with entertainment withal.
The man who played the informer, in the first
instance, before Rabyâs arrest, had mastered
almost every secret of the strange house upon
the river. He told the officers of the guard
who went to take the astrologer that there was
a tunnel from the cellar of the house, and that
they must guard first the outlet of that before
they strove to force the upper part. The
entrance in the house he had never found,
but the outlet by the river he knew. They
said âtwas scarce larger than a mole-hill and
cleverly concealed. Well, here sat down three
of the kingâs men, while others went and
searched the house. There they were transfixed
by terror, for when each one looked in that
magic mirror, he saw the devil, horns and
hoofs and tail, but when they all looked, it
was blank. A young page with them had a fit
from fright. âTis said by some that it is only
too faithful a glass. They found not the
wizard, nor was there a bit of writing there.
But the trio by the hole in the ground had
better luck. Out of it the magician appeared
[263]

so suddenly, and was so near the color of the
earth in his russet cloak, that he frightened
them so much that two fell sprawling in the
river mud, and had not the third been a big
man and valiant, my lord wizard would have
escaped. They have him now safe in the
Tower, though âtis said he rides out of it each
night upon a moonbeam and returns when the
cocks are crowing.

ââHow came my Lord Raby to conspire with
this man? I remember that he and Francis
Bryan were ready to slit his throat the night
the queen took her fright. Yet âtis said that
the case is clear enough, and there is some
wonder when the trial will come off.

ââThe court is dull; Queen Jane is not
yet crowned, though there is constant talk of
it. She will have no maids save those who
wear a girdle of over a hundred and twenty-five
pearls. Anne Basset had one from her
mother, Lady Lisle, of a hundred and twenty,
and she could not appear in it. The kingâs
leg is said to be worse than reported; he is
fond of the queen, whom some think fairer
than Anne; she can, at least, wear more fine
clothes at once and look better, while Queen
Anne was more beautiful in simple robes.
This queen is very gracious to the Lady Mary
[264]

Tudor and âtis thought will win upon the
papists. She isâââ

âOh, hush!â ejaculated Carew; âthe womanâs
pen is worse than her tongue. I must
to London to see what can be done for Raby;
âtis a bad business, and I understand it not.â

All the while, Mistress Betty had listened
with a pale face, resolution growing in it as
the matter unfolded itself. She did not speak
of Barton Henge; his part in it sank into
insignificance now.

âUncle,â she said firmly, âI will go with
you.â

âWhat, wench?â he said in surprise; âof
what use would you be?â

âNevertheless, deny me not,â Betty said;
âI would go and, at least, I will not hinder
you.â

âLet her have her way, William,â Lady
Crabtree said; âthe girlâs face will help you,
and she is in a mood to fret out her heart
here.â

[265]

CHAPTER XXIV

LOVE AT THE TRAITORâS GATE

Sir William Carew
and Mistress Betty
were both kindly received by Cromwell. He
gave them a private audience, and Betty sat in
the window recess in silent suspense, while
her uncle talked with the kingâs minister.
Cromwellâs face was calm and inscrutable;
Carewâs deeply furrowed with anxiety. The
one was master of the situation, the other
exceedingly perplexed and doubtful of a way
in which to help his friend.

âMy lord,â he said gravely, âI come to
inquire into the arrest of Simon Raby, and
to know the fate of certain papers that he bore
of mine.â

âHe was arrested upon the charge of high
treason,â Cromwell replied, âand I regret to
say that, upon examination, the evidence
against him was materially strengthened. I
regret it exceedingly, for I knew his father and
have ever held a good opinion of the son.
But unhappily, Sir William, in these times a
[266]

man knows not where to look for backsliding;
âtis on every side, and the younger men are
brought into temptation more easily.â

âI find it hard to believe so much ill of my
Lord Raby,â Carew said stoutly; âhe hath
ever borne the character of an honest man. I
pray you, sir, to allow him full opportunity to
clear himself of this foul charge.â

âSir,â answered Cromwell, âevery subject
of the king hath justice. Look you, Carew, I
have no wish to cut off this manâs liberty. It
is my unpleasant duty to stand for the king in
these matters, and the odium of it lies on me.
No man grieved more deeply than I for the
loss of More, yet Moreâs death is charged to
me. âTis like the outcry against the kingâs
lawyer, Dr. Rich, because he went to Kimbolton
in the matter of the will of the princess
dowager. The papists claim that her property
was not respected. Yet the truth is plain as
daylight. The Lady Catherine claimed to be
the kingâs wife and left no will save in the
form of a petition to his grace; and dying as
she did, in law, a sole woman, the administration
of her estate lapsed to the next of kin, the
emperor. But for the work of the attorney-general,
the king could not have fulfilled her
bequests. Yet Rich and I were pilloried for
[267]

the matter, which was but a womanâs obstinacy
and the plain course of the law. Every rogue
who goes to prison, every gentleman who is
sent to the Tower, raises the hue and cry
against me as the root of evil. âTwould
pleasure me far more to set them all free, but,
unhappily, the safety of the realm forces me to
a different course. As for Raby, I found upon
his person papers more full of treason than an
egg of meat. A lamb he may be, but, verily,
he seemeth a wolf.â

âHe is innocent!â cried Betty, unable to
keep silence longer; âgive him but the opportunity
to prove it.â

Cromwell glanced in surprise at the animated
and beautiful face as she stood before
him, one hand pressed against her heart and
the other outstretched, as if imploring mercy.

âWhat wench have you here, Carew?â he
asked; âsuch eyes should plead a cause if
there were not such lips to enforce it.â

âMy niece, my lord,â said Carew, hastily
laying a restraining hand on Betty; âa silly
fool, who knows not enough to hold her tongue
before her betters.â

âI cannot sit by and hear an innocent man
accused and not defend him!â exclaimed Betty,
with all her natural impatience.

[268]
Cromwell smiled grimly. âThis nobleman
hath truly won an advocate,â he remarked; âI
take it that the young lady hath more than a
common interest in him.â

âThey were but lately affianced,â said Sir
William shortly, his cheek flushing, âbut that
will be soon broken if he proves the traitor.â

âI am sorry, fair mistress, to lose you a
lover,â Cromwell said, looking with some
admiration and much kindness at the passionate
distress on Bettyâs face, âbut the service
of the kingâs grace should be nearer your
heart than this young nobleman.â

âMy lord,â said Betty bravely, her face
flushed and her eyes shining, âyou have been
misled by circumstances; you do Lord Raby
an injustice. I know that he is guiltless; I
pledge my faith upon it!â

âI doubt not your faith in him, my mistress,â
Cromwell answered dryly, âbut, unhappily,
he gave me the packet which revealed the
most damnable plot that it hath been my
misfortune to behold.â

âWould he have given it, my lord, had he
been guilty?â exclaimed Rabyâs defender,
valiantly; âsurely that alone declares his
innocence.â

My lord privy seal shook his head.

[269]
ââTwas but a mistake,â he said; âdoubtless
he meant to give me another. What was it
you said of papers, Carew?â

âI had intrusted some documents full of
reports of matters in Devon, which you had
requested, to Lord Rabyâs keeping,â Sir William
answered; âhe was to deliver them to
you, but I fear they went astray.â

Cromwell looked thoughtfully from the
window.

ââTis strange,â he said; âthere were no
such matters on his person. If I told you what
he bore, âtwould amaze you. I fear that there
is no clear excuse; though, in the interest of
this young lady, I would rejoice could one be
found.â

âMy lord, it shall be!â said Betty, firmly.
âI pray you only give me time; let me see my
Lord Raby in the Tower, and I will unravel
this mystery.â

Cromwell glanced from her impassioned face
to Sir Williamâs. Womanâs devotion was an
old story to him, from the faithful love of
Margaret Roper to the loyalty of Mary Wyatt.
There was something in the spectacle that
depressed him.

âThe charge against Raby is of the most
serious nature, mistress,â he said, âbut I will
[270]

give him all the time I can, albeit the kingâs
service must not suffer therefrom. Nor will I
refuse to let you carry him what comfort you
may, but âtis a sorry errand for one so young,
so beautiful, and so brave. I wish your heart
were more happily placed.â

âMy lord,â said Betty, gravely, âlove is
nothing worth that may not bear misfortune.â

Cromwell gave her an earnest look. It may
be that his own thoughts went back to the
dying Wolsey, and he knew that he had not
failed to fight the last gallant fight for the
fallen cardinal.

âThat is true enough, fair mistress,â he
said kindly; âI do think that Raby hath at
least a greater happiness in the Tower than
some true men who go free. Carew, I will
give a warrant for you and this brave wench
to visit the prisoner, and I speak sooth when I
say that I would gladly see the matter righted.â

As he spoke, he wrote a formal warrant
addressed to the Lieutenant of the Tower,
admitting Sir William and his niece to visit
a state prisoner. He handed it to Betty.

âThere, mistress,â he said, âI had not the
heart to refuse thee;â and then, after another
look at her, âI know that face surely; thou
hast been at court?â

[271]
ââTis the wench you sent to Kimbolton,
my lord,â Carew said, âand lately she attended
Queen Anne Boleyn.â

Cromwell leaned back in his chair, shading
his face with his hand.

âI meant not to give the wench two such
sad appointments,â he said gravely. âI do
not care to think of the past in either case.
Happily, the king is well married and if there
be but a boy!â

âAy,â assented Carew, heartily, ââtis the
wish of all true Englishmen.â

âSir,â said Cromwell, solemnly, âGod only
knows what it would mean to this realm. Parliament
hath happily placed the crown at the
disposal of the kingâs grace, but to have the
succession established would mean Englandâs
salvation; and all these conspiracies which
bring us such misery would be harmless as a
still-born babe.â

He paused; his face deeply overcast. Then
recollecting himself, as he encountered Bettyâs
inquiring gaze, he summoned an attendant.

âThis man will go with you,â he said to
Sir William, âand will secure you immediate
admittance at the Tower.â

Carew thanked him heartily, although he
half suspected the attendant of being a spy,
[272]

but he had no choice but to accept him. After
a few more words, Cromwell dismissed them
and they set out without delay for the Tower.

Sir William was not altogether pleased at
being pushed forward upon the errand, but he
was too kind-hearted to blame his niece, who
was so deeply distressed already. So he made
the best of an unpleasant business and walked
briskly to the wharf, where Cromwellâs servant
obtained a wherry with a readiness that increased
Sir Williamâs uneasiness. However, it seemed
but an ordinary river craft, manned by four
stout oarsmen, who haggled, as usual, over the
fare. But Carew was so liberally inclined that
in a few moments the bargain was completed
and the three set out on their voyage. Bettyâs
face was muffled, and she sat quietly by her
uncle as the boat travelled swiftly over the
waters. They crossed that part of the river
which was most thickly crowded with shipping,
but the young girl had no eyes save for the low
dark walls of the Tower, which presently came
in sight. She shuddered when the boatmen,
obeying the directions of Cromwellâs servant,
turned under the dusky bastion to the Traitorâs
Gate. The tide was rising and bore the
wherry under the low arch to the stone steps,
where the water lapped gently as it rose.
[273]

Above them the arch was closed by a wicket of
heavy wooden cross-bars, and behind this rose
the causeway leading to the prison. On the
other side of the wicket could be seen the
sentries on guard. This was the view before
them; behind, looking back through the arch,
was the sunshine on the river, the gay life of
the world. Here, but a short while before,
had entered More and Fisher, the Charterhouse
monks, and the unhappy Queen of Englandâa
strange company!

Sir William and Mistress Betty alighted on
the stone steps, and the wicket was promptly
opened at the warrant of the privy seal, which
also ensured the visitors a respectful welcome.
Without more delay than naturally accompanied
the formalities of a military prison, they were
shown into the presence of Sir William Kingston,
who received Carew with every mark of
kindness, as an old acquaintance.

âI am well pleased to see you,â he said,
âand better pleased that you come not as a
permanent guest.â

âGod forbid!â said Sir William Carew,
bluntly; âbut I come to see one of your
guests, Kingston; my friend, Simon Raby.â

The officerâs face became grave at once.

âI am sorry for his case,â he said; âhe was
[274]

the last I looked for. He will be glad to
welcome you, for he takes not kindly to
confinement.â

As he spoke, he led the way to the rooms
near the chapel, and having a warder with him,
soon caused a door to be unbolted and signed
to Carew to enter.

âYou have the privy sealâs warrant,â he
said, âand yonder you will find the prisoner.â

After an instantâs hesitation, Sir William
pushed his niece forward and then followed her
across the threshold. Kingston, closing the
door, left them alone with the imprisoned
nobleman. It was a low, dark room, so insufficiently
lighted that at first they could not
plainly see Lord Rabyâs face as he rose at
their entrance. A small fire took off a little of
the chill of the place, but the atmosphere was
unwholesomely damp. The unwonted captivity
and the anxiety had driven all the color
from the prisonerâs cheeks, and his expression
was stern and sad. For an instant he did
not recognize Carew, and then he uttered an
exclamation of joy.

âThis is kind of you indeed!â he exclaimed,
advancing, and as he did so, his eyes lighted
on the cloaked figure beside Sir William. In
an instant he recognized her, and regardless of
[275]

her uncle, he sprang forward and caught her in
his arms.

Mistress Bettyâs high spirit would at other
times have resisted her loverâs fashion of taking
possession of her, but his situation made a
sad difference, and she clung to him a moment,
tears shining in her eyes, while he caressed
her and blessed her for coming. It was Carew
who interrupted this little drama.

âCome, come,â he said with gruff kindness,
âour time is short; and if we are to serve you,
we must inquire into your case.â

ââTis so,â said Betty, withdrawing from
Rabyâs embrace; âyou must tell us all.â

Her lover drew forward the only two chairs
the room afforded for his guests, and seating
himself on a low stool at her feet, listened
patiently to Sir Williamâs harangue.

âMy Lord Raby,â he said gravely, âbut
yesterday we received the tidings of your
arrest, and came post-haste to London to my
lord privy seal to learn what we could of the
matter. Nor can I say that we were comforted
thereby; the information is so strange that it
perplexeth me marvellously. We were granted
permit to come to the Tower by Cromwell, and
here we be, but how we may serve you is not
so plain to me. Doubtless, though, you can
[276]

make some clean statement of the matter,
albeit it seems so bewildering to others.â

Sir Williamâs frame of mind was not easily
mistaken and Rabyâs cheek flushed at the
doubt implied, even though he saw only faith
and trust in the eyes of Betty Carew.

âUnhappily, sir,â he said stiffly, âI can
make no explanation; could I do so, doubtless
I should not be in the Tower.â

Carew bent his brows. âMy lord privy seal
tells me that you were chiefly condemned by
the packet you gave him,â he said slowly;
âtherefore it would seem that you must hold
some key to the matter. What was this packet?
Wherefore did you give it to Cromwell?â

âThe packet was yours, Sir William,â Raby
replied sharply, âtherefore âtis you who should
unfold the story.â

Carewâs face flushed red with indignation.

âMy Lord Raby,â he said coldly, âthat is a
childâs tale, but not for the ears of men. My
papers were innocent of any offence to king or
council; they pertained entirely to affairs in
Devon, and were writ at Cromwellâs request.â

âSir,â replied the prisoner, sternly, âit hath
been a mystery to me, and, albeit I would not
have spoken of it, for fear of offence to you,
now I will even speak my mind. The packet
[277]

that you gave me was cherished with care, and
when I was apprehended, was yet in the breast
of my doublet. My lord privy seal had received
me kindly, and used me with the justice
I had a right to expect. Being willing to
serve you, even in my own misfortune, I handed
your packet to him. Scarce had he opened it
before his face changed, and after reading half
its contents, he sent me to the Tower. Had I
been minded to think ill of you, Sir William,
surely I had cause enough, but I strove to
judge the matter with charity. In return, you
cast suspicion on my motives and charge me
with falsehood in regard to this same evil
packet. Sir, it tries my patience to its
limit.â

ââTis sheer nonsense to lay the matter to
my papers,â retorted Carew, irritably; âknow
I not what was writ there? Am I a fool? If
all your conduct was as innocent, there is little
doubt you would be a freeman.â

âI am a prisoner,â Raby replied proudly,
âand mayhap it pleasures you to cast aspersions
on a man who may not defend himself,
but âtis unworthy of you.â

At this, Betty interfered.

âI pray you both to forbear,â she said, looking
from one face to the other imploringly;
[278]

âsurely there is some terrible mistake, and do
not make it worse by a quarrel.â

Raby, seeing her distress, pressed her hand
affectionately.

âDear heart,â he said, âI would not quarrel
with thy uncle, but no man can endure such
insinuations with patience. I am innocent,
and I have no such meek spirit that I love to
be suspected by my friends.â

âI am an old man, my lord,â said Carew,
impatiently, âand I am not over-smooth-tongued;
I have no wish to offend your nice
feelings, but I see a plain matter and you give
me a foolish excuse. My packet! Why, Lord
Raby, I would have sent this child Betty with
it and taken no thought.â

âSir, I never accused you of malice,â Simon
replied more calmly, âbut I had the packet
of you, I gave it to Cromwell, and I am
here.â

âTush!â exclaimed Sir William, testily,
âam I a fool? Do I look a dullard? Can you
think to pass this dream off on a sane man?
Raby, it was not my packet!â

âSir!â exclaimed the younger man, springing
to his feet, âdo you accuse me of falsehood?â

Mistress Betty rose and ran to her uncle,
[279]

who was standing, his strong face working
with anger.

âUncle,â she said, pushing him toward the
door, her rosy palms pressed against his broad
breast, and using all her young strength,
âgoâgo to the door and wait for me. I would
speak with him. You will only quarrel. Hush!
hush!â she added, as she saw the angry words
trembling on Sir Williamâs lips; âhe is a
prisoner; âtis unworthy of you.â

Sir William looked at the beautiful young
face so close to his, and his heart relented.

âThou art a witch, Betty,â he said; âhave
thy will, but make the man talk sense to
thee.â

She had pushed him to the door, and would
have thrust him out if the warder had not fastened
it from without. Having disposed of
one, she ran back to the other disputant, who
stood leaning on his chair with a gloomy face.

âHave you also so poor an opinion of me?â
he asked, looking searchingly at the fair face.

âWould I be here?â she answered simply.
âAh, my lord, a woman comes not lightly to
such a place!â

âForgive me!â he exclaimed, kissing her
hands passionately; âSir Williamâs suspicions
of me struck a sore heart. My darling, while
[280]

I have your confidence, no man shall dare to
doubt me.â

âThink, think!â she cried, pressing her
hand on his arm earnestly; âhow did it happen?
What can we do to explain it away?â

Lord Raby shook his head; he knew too
well the secret nature of such charges, the
slow course of the law, the difficulty of
defence.

âI know not,â he answered, looking fondly
into her troubled eyes; âwe must even let the
law find its own way. The attack on me is of
a nature which I can least easily defeat. I
trust most in mine innocence. Let it not so
distress you, happy as it makes me to feel you
care. Ah, Betty, I had no thought of such a
fate when I asked you to be my wife; will you
keep faith? Forgive me; I ought not to ask
you to remain plighted to a prisoner.â

He was looking sadly at the beautiful, animated
face. She raised her head proudly; her
eyes shone.

âSir,â she said sweetly, âI will wed you or
none!â

âGod bless you!â he cried, catching her in
his arms and kissing her; âI have no right to
ask such a pledge of you!â

âYou asked not,â she said archly; âI gave
[281]

it. Hark! there comes the warder; doubtless
our time is expired. I pray you think better
of my uncle; I love him. He is a blunt man
and too free-spoken, but he is true as steel.â

âDear Betty,â the prisoner whispered fondly,
âif he were a monster, I would try to love him
for your sake.â

âCome, niece!â called Sir William, impatiently,
âwe must be gone; the warder is
here.â

âI must go,â Betty said, tearing herself
away from her loverâs detaining arms; âI must
go, but surely will I work for your deliverance
with all my might, and so shall my uncle.
Farewellâoh, farewell till we meet again!â

Her eyes were shining now with tears, and
there was a third summons from Sir William
before she parted from the prisoner, and ran
from the room, drawing her mantle over her
face.

When they sat again in the boat, Carew
turned to her with a grim face, but there was
a kind light in his eyes.

âMy wench,â he said bluntly, âthou art a
fool, but I love thee.â

[282]

CHAPTER XXV

A SEASON OF WAITING

Lord Raby
was arrested in June, and at
the time there seemed to be an immediate
prospect of a trial, and he looked forward to it
with the earnest hope of establishing his innocence.
But he was doomed to a far different
fate; he and his fellow prisoner, the wizard,
were held while Cromwell slowly unravelled
the threads of a great conspiracy, which had
been only partially indicated by the papers
in the mysterious packet. It was not good
policy to seize at once upon men whose names
figured in the documents, some of them the
foremost in the land, and the privy seal
played the waiting game, in which he was
an adept. The slow months of the summer
passed, and with Michaelmas came the rising
in the northern counties, ostensibly provoked
by the visitation of the monasteries, but
really the outgrowth of many grievances, and
the full fruit of a long-planned conspiracy.
The Pilgrimage of Grace doomed Lord Raby
[283]

to a long confinement. With this example of
the result of treasonable machinations before
his eyes, Cromwell had less mercy for those
accused of direct complicity in it. As the
rebels, under Robert Aske, advanced to Doncaster,
threatening to overwhelm the kingâs
small army, the prisoners in the Tower were
subjected to closer confinement. One of the
avowed purposes of the insurgents was the fall
of Cromwell, and it was not probable that he
would be lenient to such offenders as were
within his reach. It was, however, an inconvenient
time for trial of the prisoners, and Raby
and Sanders remained in suspense.

Sir William Carew could not forgive the
doubt of his packet expressed by Simon, and
he turned a deaf ear to Bettyâs entreaties. He
would not move a finger in the cause. In fact,
the stout-hearted gentleman doubted Lord
Raby. The evidence was so plain, as Cromwell
unfolded it, Simonâs accusation of Sir
Williamâs documents so childish, the outbreak
of the insurrection so convincing, that Carew
felt certain that the nobleman had been led
into dabbling with conspiracy and had committed
himself to the cause of Mary Tudor and
the papists.

Mistress Betty, indignant at her uncle, distressed
[284]

for Lord Raby, and helpless to combat
the course of events, remained with Lady
Crabtree. She was unable even to see the
king in regard to the matter. Having been
one of Anne Boleynâs maids, she was unacceptable
to Queen Jane, and her petitions to
the king remained unanswered. She lived in
seclusion at Wildrick, having no heart for the
festivities at Hampton Court, where Jane held
her court, and being unwelcome, she stayed
away. She could not even obtain leave to see
her lover; after the outbreak of the rebellion,
she was denied access to him; he was kept in
solitary confinement and under rigorous military
discipline. The suspense told on the
young girlâs nerves, and before winter was
over she was pale and thin; but her eyes
gained in beauty as her color faded, and her
striking face drew many a glance of admiration
when she went upon her pilgrimages to
Cromwellâs house. Lady Crabtree, though
sharing some of Carewâs doubts of Rabyâs
innocence, had a warm regard for him, and
was ever Mistress Bettyâs companion, her
untiring energy accomplishing as much as the
young girlâs devotion. The two figures, so
strangely contrasted,âthe gaunt old woman,
with her long stride, and the graceful girl,âwere
[285]

familiar in Cromwellâs anterooms, but
their efforts to win better treatment or an open
trial for Lord Raby were alike in vain. The
privy seal, conscious that in the magician he
had a master traitor, saw in Raby a probable
accomplice. There was one also, always about
Cromwell, whose offices boded ill for Simon.
Sir Barton Henge was active in working for
the government, tireless upon the scent of
traitors, a conspicuously zealous loyalist. Yet,
though he and the two women, old Madam and
Betty, travelled often upon the same errand,
they never met. The sting of Mistress Carewâs
whip was still upon his face although the mark
had faded, and he watched his opportunity
with that feline patience which belongs to the
panther tribe, whether walking on two legs or
four, for the kinship to the beast is strong in
some human beings.

There were many anxious hearts in England
through that long year of trouble, and the
enemies of the king rejoiced. On Christmas
Eve, at the great mass at St. Peterâs, the darkness
of the church was illumined by a thousand
tapers, while the marvellous cap and sword
were laid upon the altar, consecrated for James
of Scotland to unite the enemies of the faith.
And in Flanders, Cardinal Pole looked eagerly
[286]

for the opportunity to overthrow Henry VIII.,
and for the return of the supremacy of Rome.
Across the Channel, plot and counter-plot were
hatched, took their course, and died fruitless;
while in England, the one man with an iron
will, the privy seal, held on his even course,
though the waves of popular fury, beating on
the ship of state, threatened to overwhelm the
pilot. Norfolk, whose heart was doubtless
more with the rebels than with the king, was
driven against them. The unhappy Northumberland
died faithful to Henry, although the
fate of Anne Boleyn had prostrated him. The
great rebellion spent itself; one after another
of its leaders were brought to the Tower.
The unfortunate Darcy died, charging it all on
Cromwell, and at last, in July, Robert Aske
suffered a felonâs death. The Pilgrimage of
Grace was over; it had ended in a futile loss
of life to the cause of the old religion. âTwice
the children of Israel went up against Benjamin,â
wrote Cardinal Pole, âand twice they
were put to confusion.â

In the midst of trials and executions, Raby
yet lingered in the Tower untried. Either
overlooked in the great pressure of trouble, or
held for stronger proof, he and the wizard
languished, each in solitary confinement. The
[287]

kingâs officers had taken possession of the
strange house on the Thames and searched it,
finding many curious contrivances for the
execution of the mummeries which had confused
the imagination of the magicianâs clients.
Yet, so exuberant was the superstition of the
times, that the exposure of paltry methods
of deceit failed to destroy the dread of the
small man who had held such sway there.
Even the royal officers shrank from their duty,
and no one occupied the house; the official
seal was affixed to the doors and it remained
empty. The shutters, taken down to admit
the light for the search, remained so, and the
windows blinked in the afternoon sun like evil
eyes suddenly unveiled. No man ventured
near it after sundown, and many who passed
it, even at high noon, made the sign of the
cross. A baleful influence seemed to issue
from it; the vine that tried to climb up the
door-post hung blasted in midsummer, and
the grass did not grow, although no footsteps
wore the ground about it. There was not an
old wife in the neighborhood who had not a
tale of how the wizard visited it every night,
and how the smoke came from the chimney of
his laboratory at the very hour when he had
been in the habit of brewing the devilâs tea.

[288]
Summer passed; Michaelmas came and went;
all England waited in hope and fear for news
of the birth of an heir to the throne, and on
the twelfth of October, the vigil of Saint
Edwardâs day, the bells rang out in wild peals
of joy, the bonfires blazed from Landâs End
to the Tweed, the guns were fired. A prince
was born; the hope of England lived.

[289]

CHAPTER XXVI

A PRINCEâS BAPTISM

It
was the hour appointed for the princeâs
baptism. It was night at Hampton Court;
the kingâs equerries ran to and fro, the ladies
of the queen were crowding the anterooms of
the royal chamber. They had made elaborate
toilets for the great occasion, and farthingales
of satin and brocade spread wide on every
hand; and more than one slender waist was
girdled with costly pearls, while the great
headdresses loomed up above fair faces, flushed
and agitated with the haste and the unusual
presence of the king; for Henry sat beside the
state couch on which lay the young mother of
Englandâs future king. Pages quarrelled over
comfits on the staircases; gentlemen-in-waiting
ran against each other in their eagerness to
excel in service at that hour; the doctors and
nurses forgot the queen in their zeal for the
prince. The heralds, armed with silver
trumpets, stood waiting to proclaim the glad
event; the sponsors were come, laden with
[290]

gifts, the Archbishop Cranmer, the Princess
Mary, the Duke of Norfolkâa strange company.
My lord of Canterburyâs spoons and
Mary Tudorâs golden cup stood side by side;
the day was not yet ripe when she would sign
the warrant to send the archbishop to the
flames of martyrdom.

Into this scene of confusion came my Lady
Crabtree and Mistress Betty Carew. It was
an hour when all guests were welcome, and
the opportunity to reach the royal presence
was too valuable to be lost. Betty came with
a secret hope; she did not speak of it even to
her companion, but it was in her heart. She
had arrayed herself with more than usual care,
and she looked like a stately white rose as she
stood in the chapel waiting for the entrance of
the great procession. Her gown was of pure
white brocade, and on her head was the five-pointed
hood of white velvet, such as Anne
Boleyn had often worn; around her throat was
a single string of pearls. Months of anxiety
had stolen the color from her cheeks, but her
brown eyes were larger and more lustrous, and
there was a purpose, a resolution in her face
which made it beautiful in its intense animation.
Old Madam, in a singularly ugly garment
of copper-colored satin with a marvellous
[291]

headdress of black velvet, made a strange foil
for the beauty, and many a curious glance was
cast in their direction as they stood aside,
watching, but taking no part in the festivities.

The torches flared in the royal chapel, the
light shining red on the altar and on the solid
silver font, which was guarded by four gentlemen,
one of these Sir Francis Bryan, the
cousin of Anne Boleyn. These four grand
personages wore aprons, and towels were tied
around their necks. There were Bryan, Sir
John Russel, Sir Nicholas Carew, the master
of horse, who was to lose his head in the matter
of the Marquis of Exeter, and Sir Anthony
Browne. The silver trumpets blew in the
very chamber where Jane Seymour lay, and the
procession came up between the torches to
the silver font. There was the glitter of gold,
the flash of jewels, the sheen of satin. Noble
lords, great ladies, the peers of England
walked in solemn company. The smoke from
the many torches floated up to the roof and
hung like a veil; below, the blaze of splendor
dazzled the eye. Under a glittering canopy
came the prince of England, borne in the arms
of the Marchioness of Exeter, and behind
walked the humble Mother Jack, the princeâs
nurse. The Princess Mary and the Duke of
[292]

Norfolk, Seymour, the queenâs brother, bearing
in his arms the little Princess Elizabeth,
who held in her hands a chrisom, her gift to
her infant brother. The father of Anne Boleyn,
the Earl of Wiltshire, came with a towel about
his neck and bearing a taper of virgin wax.
Behind these, the lords and ladies of the
court; a long and goodly procession, sweeping
into the chapel and filling it with a gorgeous
display of costly silks and jewels. And the
music of the silver trumpets filled the air,
while on every side beauty and magnificence
vied with each other, and the blaze of many
torches made the chapel light as day. The
solemn service over, his serene highness,
Prince Edward, Duke of Cornwall and Earl of
Chester, was proclaimed by Garter, and the
glittering procession took its way back to the
chamber of the queen, where King Henry had
remained all the while. It was midnight
when, with the music of many trumpets, the
throng came in to the great apartment where
the pale-faced queen lay on a state bed with a
canopy above it, resplendent with cloth of gold.
There was the rustle of many sweeping skirts,
the jingle of swords and chains, the flare of
many lights, and all the room full of faces,
looking eagerly toward the royal couch. The
[293]

Marchioness of Exeter bore the little prince to
receive his motherâs blessing; the king stood
up, looking on, boisterous in his joy. Behind
him were the pale, gentle face of Cranmer,
the stalwart form of Norfolk, the sad and cold-looking
Princess Mary, the daughter of Catherine
of Arragon, and the little golden-haired
Elizabeth, the child of such bright hopes, and
now stamped with the mark of illegitimacy
and shadowed by the fearful death of Anne
Boleyn. The little princess, though only four
years old, had a train borne by Lady Herbert
as she walked into the room. The king had
increased in corpulence, and the ulcers on his
legs made his movements painful, but he was
very merry.

âSweetheart,â he said to the queen as she
kissed the child, after giving it her blessing,
âthe boy hath thine eyes and will have thy
beauty.â

âMy lord,â replied Jane, meekly, âI would
rather that he looked like your grace.â

âNay,â said the king, laughing, âI am willing
that my successor should excel me in
looks. What say you, my lords and ladies, is
he not a goodly boy?â

There was a chorus of assent; it would have
been a strange time to criticise the Prince of
[294]

England. Only one or two of the older
women looked anxiously at the pale face and
shining eyes of the queen, and nodded their
heads at each other. Henry, overflowing with
joy at the birth of a boy, moved about among
the nobles present, talking freely to all, and
with little thought of the nervous strain upon
the young mother. His face softened by his
happiness and his rich dress becoming his
large and stately figure, the king recalled to
many the handsome presence of his earlier
manhood. He came down the long room,
speaking familiarly and kindly to all whom he
recognized, and showing his wonderful memory
for small matters by his words to each one.

âAh, John,â he said to one tall nobleman,
âhow is that lame boy of yours? I will send
my physician to look at his leg; the prince
must have sound subjects.â

Without waiting for thanks, he turned to
another.

âLady Harriet, you and I grow old; we are
both limping; but we must mend our paces
now.â And to a younger matron, âAlice, I
hear thy baby is a beauty; we must see if it
can match mine.â

A little farther on, he stopped beside a
young couple who were standing together. âI
[295]

have heard of your parentsâ opposition,â he
said with boisterous kindness; âI will see to
it that it is ended; we must have a merry wedding
before Christmas. Trouble ceased at this
court when the prince was born!â

In his genial progress he had reached the
end of the room where stood Betty Carew.
Her tall, white figure and beautiful, sad face
arrested his attention at once. It may be that
he remembered her as an attendant of Queen
Anne, for his own face clouded slightly and he
looked at her with manifest interest. It was
the opportunity for which Betty had waited,
and she advanced with a beating heart. Her
great beauty and something in her manner
made a little stir as she came forward. A
page was holding a torch near where the king
stood, and the boy, attracted by her beauty,
held his light so that the full radiance fell on
her figure, outlining it in the white glistening
folds of satin draperies and casting a wonderful
glow in her eyes. She came forward with
perfect dignity, pausing a little way from the
king, her beauty causing a whisper of amazement
to run around the circle. Henry, who
was ever quick to recognize loveliness in
woman, looked at her with evident admiration.

ââTis Mistress Carew, and I mistake not,â
[296]

he said graciously. âWhat will you ask of
me to-night?â

âYour grace,â she replied gently, âI have
a petition, albeit a strange one for so joyous
an occasion, yet I pray you hear it in the name
of Prince Edward.â

âMy girl, thou hast used an appeal to which
we may not turn a deaf ear,â said Henry; âsay
on.â

Mistress Betty drew a long breath; she was
summoning all her strength to plead her
cause.

âSire,â she said, âthere is a prisoner in the
Tower wrongfully charged with treason; an
innocent man whom some enemy hath entangled.
I pray your grace to hear his cause,
to end this great suspense. Long, long he
hath languished a prisoner without the opportunity
to establish his innocence. And he is
innocent!â she clasped her hands together
with a passionate gesture, âSimon Raby is
innocent!â she cried; âand oh, my lord the
king, I pray you to think of the terrible strain
of this long suspense!â

âSimon Raby?â repeated the king; âonce
my equerry, I think.â

âAy, your grace,â replied the Duke of
Norfolk, âthe son of old Lord Raby of Sussex;
[297]

an honest gentleman, who died nearly two
years ago.â

âAn honest gentleman; ay, I remember
him; he served my father well,â said the king,
thoughtfully. âCromwell hath been eager
trapping his mice, but I would not keep a true
man in jail. Hath he not been tried, Mistress
Carew?â he added, looking again at Betty.

âNay, your highness,â she replied sadly;
âhe has languished long, and with no hope,
nor have they let his friends see him.â

âHow long hath he been in the Tower?â
asked Henry, gravely.

âFourteen months and more, Sire,â she
answered.

ââTis too long,â said the king, frowning.
âI have no will to keep a poor gentleman without
a trial; this shall be looked into.â

Bettyâs heart beat high with hope, but she
had yet a petition to make, and Henry saw it
in her expression. Her beauty, her evident
loyalty to the prisoner interested him.

âSpeak, sweetheart,â he said kindly; âwhat
is in thy mind?â

âI pray your grace to give me warrant to
see the wizard, Zachary Sanders, who is also
in the Tower,â she said; âthey let no man see
him, but I know that if he will, he can
[298]

surely clear Lord Raby; and oh, I beseech your
highness, to let me plead with him!â

Henry smiled. âYou are not like to plead
in vain, fair mistress,â he said lightly; âfor
the sake of this blessed night, your petitions
are both granted. Norfolk, bid my lord privy
seal to give this pretty beggar a warrant to go
into the Tower. But hark you, my wench, I
charge you not to leave your heart behind you
there,â and with a laugh at his own jest, the
king passed on, surrounded by an ever-increasing
throng of courtiers until the apartment of
the queen was gradually deserted, save by her
own attendants.

The first white streaks of dawn were showing
at the eastern horizon when Lady Crabtree
and Betty left Hampton Court, and the mists
of night obscured the scene.

âThou didst have rare luck, my girl,â said
old Madam, drawing her mantle closer in the
chill air; âand now there is a hope to end the
matter.â

âThe kingâs grace was kind,â replied Betty,
âand I have good hope, for I believe that now
they will hear Simonâs cause; and if they do,
all will be well.â

âMayhap it will,â retorted Lady Crabtree
dryly, unwilling to cast down the young girlâs
[299]

new-born hopes; âat least, Cromwell shall do
more than shake his head at us. âTis well
that you struck while the iron was hot and the
king was happy; for if they keep up that rout,
they will kill both mother and child. Mercy
on us, what a baptism! My lord of Canterbury
and Mary Tudor walking together, and Norfolk,
who loves the papists with all his heart.
That ambitious prig, too, my Lord Seymour,
who will rise on his sisterâs petticoats. It
went to my heart to see Anne Boleynâs baby
decked out to march behind this new toy!
Well-a-day, âtis strange!â

A little farther on, she burst out laughing;
a scornful laugh, too, which startled Betty.

âWhat makes you so merry, madam?â she
asked quietly.

âSaw you not that fool, the Earl of Wiltshire,â
old Madam asked, âwith a towel tied
around his neck, and carrying my Lord Cranmerâs
silver pots, the christening present?
Lord! why did he not go fetch his daughterâs
head? The drivelling idiot would dance at
his own funeral, if he could crook his legs,
with the hope to please the kingâs grace. âTis
such a courtier that upsets an honest stomach.
Were I the king, Iâd send him home with a
merry flogging, as an ass.â

[300]

CHAPTER XXVII

THE WIZARD IN THE TOWER

Superstition
works its own miracles, and
strangely enough, even in the Tower of London,
its spell took effect. The royal officers had
secured the person of the wizard and had suffered
no harm from the contact. It was true
that one young man had fallen in a fit at some
strange vision in the wizardâs house, but the
others were unscathed. Yet the power of the
little manâs strange eyes and stranger manner
worked upon them, and no prisoner in the
Tower was better treated or with more reverence.
The warder locked him in with shaking
hands, his knees knocking together, and but
for the sharper terror of the rope at Tyburn, he
might have failed to turn the key upon his
captive. The sentinels within the Traitorâs
Gate declared that at midnight the small man
in a russet cloak passed between them, not in
natural shape, but floating past them like a
vapor, going through the close-barred wicket
to the river and returning again at dawn. Of
[301]

food, the wizard had an abundance; he had but
to express the wish for some new viand, accompanying
it with a gruesome prophecy in regard
to his keeperâs future, and the dish was immediately
forthcoming. They denied him nothing;
when other prisoners shivered, he had a fire;
when better men languished in the dark, he
had twenty tall tapers burning around his
room. He was freely supplied with pen and
paper, and he filled the sheets with cabalistic
signs which froze the blood of his attendants.
One of the bolder warders refused to tend his
fire for him; the wizard looked up with a
strange face and passed his hands before his
eyes.

âThy wife has a fit,â he said calmly; âthe
baby is born dead.â

The man hurried from the room, grumbling
at the prisoner as an evil croaker, and at the
door he heard the news confirmed. After that
he almost grovelled in his anxiety to serve the
evil little man who only laughed and mocked
his terror. Nothing but a wholesome fear of
Cromwellâs anger kept such a prisoner in the
Tower; a thousand times he could have escaped,
but that, at the last moment, the thought of
the privy seal stayed the hands of his would-be
liberators. Cromwell could not be trifled with;
[302]

his arm was long, his vengeance swift, his
eye that of a hawk looking for prey. Between
the two, the magician and the kingâs minister,
the warders of the Tower lived as men do
between the devil and the deep sea.

It was the day after Prince Edwardâs great
christening, and the wizard sat in his prison
watching the blaze leap from the logs piled in
his chimney. The wind was chill without, but
he was warm, thanks to the terror of his
jailers. He sat on a low stool, his elbows on
his knees, his chin in his hands, gazing at the
flames as if he loved them; the red glow of the
fire flaring on his wizened face and in his wonderful
eyes. He was dressed in russet-colored
damask, a cape of Flanders lace about his
neck, and on his head a pointed scarlet cap
with an opal in the front, clasping the one stiff
feather. He wore velvet shoes, scarlet like
his cap, and on his thin, long-fingered hands
were some curious rings, all strangely wrought
and fantastic in design. He had but recently
stirred the fire, and the blaze leaped up the
chimney with a merry roar and crackle. So
intent was he in his study of it that he never
turned his head when the warder opened his
door and admitted two closely muffled women.
The visitors came in a little way and stopped,
[303]

looking at him without speaking, while the
warder, after staring in with wide-mouthed
curiosity, retreated in fear of provoking the
wizardâs displeasure. When he had closed the
door, the scene remained for some moments
unchanged; the two women standing together,
evidently watching the magician, though their
mantles concealed their faces, and he still gazing
fixedly at the blaze as if he read some story
in it. There was no sound but the sharp
crackle of the wood, and there was something
unpleasantly awe-inspiring in the stillness of
the gloomy place, where no light shone but the
red one of the flames. Presently the wizard
broke the silence. He had not shown by any
sign or movement that he had seen his visitors,
but he addressed them now, though without
turning his head or glancing in their
direction.

âMy Lady Crabtree and Mistress Carew,
you are welcome,â he said calmly; âcome to
the fire and be seated.â

Old Madam laughed harshly.

âWhat is the use to wear a mask?â she
said; âthe creature hath eyes in the back of
his head like a spider.â

As she spoke, she drew nearer the fire and
seated herself on a settle opposite the astrologer,
[304]

and Betty came over and stood beside her,
looking eagerly at the weird figure before
them.

âYou came from Hampton Court,â remarked
the wizard composedly, for the first time looking
at them attentively, âwith the kingâs warrant
to visit the Tower in the matter of my
Lord Raby.â

âWe came to see you, sir,â Betty said earnestly,
âto learn the truth. We are convinced
that you can clear him if you will.
In common charity, I pray you, help us untangle
this conspiracy against an innocent
man.â

âAy, I know the truth,â retorted the magician;
ââtis my business; but why should I
make my Lord Rabyâs affairs mine?â

âTush, Sanders!â exclaimed Lady Crabtree,
who was unmoved by any awe of him, âdo not
play the innocent. We all know that you are
knee-deep and elbow-deep in this conspiracy
and like to hang at Tyburn.â

âNay, I will never hang,â replied the wizard
coldly, fixing his large and marvellously radiant
eyes upon her, ânor will the prince baptized
last night live to manhood.â

âPshaw!â said Lady Crabtree, with a laugh,
âit takes no magician to predict danger to the
[305]

baby with the rumpus they are making over
it; any old wife can beat you there as a
prophet!â

The strong-minded old woman had thrown
back her wraps and sat by the fire, her hawk-like
nose and square chin sharply outlined in
the red light, and her great frame contrasting
strangely with the diminutive one of the
prisoner. The two natures, naturally defiant
and antagonistic, recognized the qualities which
made them so, and they eyed each other in
mutual dislike and suspicion. But Betty
Carew had only the one object and hope, and
something in her beauty perhaps appealed to
Sanders, for he treated her with more consideration
than usual; he had, too, his own
reasons for aiding her. She came a step nearer
now and stood looking at him; her hood had
fallen back and revealed her head, with its
black hair uncovered, framing her pale but
handsome face; her hands hung loosely clasped
before her, and the firelight played in her
deep brown eyes.

âI pray you,â she said eagerly, âconsider
that he who so entangled Raby by placing that
packet on his person,âin some marvellous
manner,âhe also must have betrayed you.
Your cause is therefore identical with ours.
[306]

Surely you can think of some one who had
the means to compass thisâand the will.â

The wizard looked at her thoughtfully; not
a change of expression denoted that he felt any
interest in what she said.

âLord Raby had a servant,â he replied,
deliberately stirring the fire; âhe can tell you
all you wish to know.â

âWe thought of that,â cried Betty; âbut it
is judged impossible that so ignorant a man
could have had access to the papers which are
now in the hands of Cromwell.â

âNevertheless, I tell you, find him,â returned
the wizard, calmly.

âHe hath been already interrogated,â replied
Betty, sadly, âand now we know not where he
isâsince Lord Raby dismissed him.â

âHe is in a house in Cheapside,â said the
astrologer. âYou may find it easily; the door
is painted green and hath a rat-hole in the
lower left-hand corner; there are three windows
in the front of the house, each different
in size and shape. He sleeps in the attic.â

âHe will tell us nothing,â Betty answered
in despair; âwe have tried, and my Lord Raby
is sure he knows nothing.â

The wizard laughed, not mirthfully, but as
if he relished some grim joke.

[307]
âHe is in that attic,â he said dryly; âtake
him and he will tell you all.â

âI tell you,â cried Betty, with impatience,
âhe will tell us nothing.â

âSinge him,â retorted the wizard, with a
grin; âmy lord privy seal can teach you how
to entreat a prisoner to speak.â

Betty recoiled with horror, but old Madam
caught at the idea.

âThe man is right,â she remarked calmly;
ââtis easy enough to screw out the truth.
But verily, Sir Wizard, is there not more to
tell?â

The little magician shrugged his shoulders.

âI have told enough,â he said; âa woman
who is near fourscore should know the rest
without telling.â

This reference to Lady Crabtreeâs age
brought the angry blood to her face; she never
admitted it to any one, and to find that this
strange creature knew it, moved her to wrath.
She rose and gathered her mantle about her.

âCome Betty,â she said sharply, âwe but
waste time on this fool. Let us begone.â

The wizard sat laughing silently, his sinister
face lighted up with malicious enjoyment.

Betty lingered a moment, while Lady Crabtree
hurried to the door.

[308]
âIs there nothing else?â she asked earnestly;
âno other way?â

âIf you follow my instructions,â replied the
wizard, âall will be well; if notââ He
shrugged his shoulders.

[309]

CHAPTER XXVIII

A SNARE

Mistress Betty
left the Tower with a heavy
heart; she could not believe in the success of
the wizardâs plans, and she had failed to see
Lord Raby. He was that day carried before
the Council to be examined, by order of the
king, who had not forgotten Bettyâs petition.
Thus, while she was thankful that the long
suspense was over, she was disappointed in
the hope of seeing her lover, after the months
of separation. She could but wait and hope,
in the mean time making every effort to establish
his innocence. Her courage and determination
so moved old Madam to admiration
that she lacked no aid from that quarter, and
fortunately, for their success, they found Sir
William Carew in London. He had come up
from Devon two days before and was in lodgings
on the Strand, engaged in transacting
business with the Council. He was little
inclined, at first, to listen to their talk of
Lord Raby, having still his grievance in regard
[310]

to his packet, but at the mention of Simonâs
servant, he remembered his wager that the
man was a rogue, and was more willing to
undertake any matter that would prove the
infallibility of his own judgment. He was
not free of a superstitious awe of the wizard,
and showed himself to be quite ready to follow
his instructions, even without his nieceâs
entreaties.

âLet be, let be,â he said, in answer to
Bettyâs suggestions; âI will take this matter
in hand. I have two stout knaves with me,
and they should be enough to catch the varlet.
It shall be done secretly too, that those who
employ him may not take warning and so
escape us. Go to your quarters with my Lady
Crabtree, and I will see that this business is
executed in good time.â

Betty was reluctant to leave the scene of
action; she was eager for the first gleam of
hope that might dawn with Shaxterâs revelations,
if he made them.

âUncle, you will tell me what he says?â
she asked. âI cannot endure this suspense so
long.â

âI will send for you,â Sir William answered.
âYour presence here now is more
hindrance than help; but trust me, wench, I
[311]

will tell you all there is to know, if indeed
this rogue can reveal anything of importance.â

Old Madam had been below stairs talking
with an acquaintance at the door, and she
came up now with a face of importance.

âThere are bad tidings from Hampton
Court,â she said; âthe queen hath taken cold;
was ill last night, and to-day is reported dying.
Saint Thomas! what luck the king hath with
his wives!â

âNow may Heaven save the prince!â exclaimed
Sir William, baring his head reverently;
âthe hope of the realm is centered in
that child. We have scarce had time to
express our thanksgiving for his birth, and
cruel indeed would be the blow that took him
from us.â

âAy,â retorted Lady Crabtree; âthe papists
would have then the merry stirring that they
have looked for these long years, and James of
Scotland might use the nightcap that the pope
sent him for Christmas. Happily, the queenâs
death need not now mean the loss of the
prince; but they do say that it is a sickly
child, and like to be, with such a father.â

âI remember the days when the kingâs grace
was the very type of English manhood,â Carew
remarked thoughtfully, âand as gallant a
[312]

knight as ever wore harness; of goodly stature
and amiable countenance, wise in council,
learned in philosophy, and as gracious a prince
as any man might desire.â

âA wise man now, save with women,â
replied old Madam dryly; âbut carrying too
great a load of flesh and with the disease
settled in his legs, no longer like to be a great
soldier, or to live long. Well, well, this is
his third queen, and she will not be cool before
the Council will prefer suit to his grace to take
another.â

âIt may be that another woman will not
long for such an unlucky place,â remarked
Betty, quietly; âthere seems to be death in
it.â

âCromwell can send abroad then,â said Lady
Crabtree; âhe will even get Master Friskyball
to help him find an Italian princess; but look
you, my girl, the applicants here will be as
thick as cherries. Do you know your sex so
little as to think that they will lose the chance
of a crown? If a man looks like a wild boar,
he will yet find a woman to marry him; some
fool who will imagine that his heart is not
indicated by his snout. I tell you women are
all fools once; moreâs the pity!â

She was putting on her cloak as she spoke,
[313]

and having muffled it about her, she gave some
parting instructions to Sir William; and then
taking Betty, went down the stairs to the door
where her attendants waited her.

âYou will go to my lodgings,â she said to
her young companion; âbut I have other business,
and it may be late this night before I
come. Content yourself, however, with the
recollection that I will keep Sir William
spurred up to the pitch.â

Reluctantly enough Mistress Betty resigned
herself to the wishes of her elders, and was
escorted to Lady Crabtreeâs lodgings by one of
her attendants. It was dusk when she passed
through the gates, the porter closing them
behind her. She crossed the little court, and
entering the house, dismissed her follower and
went alone up the stairs to the rooms where
they were lodging. One of old Madamâs
women was there and had made the place
cheerful. A fire burned on the hearth, the
tapers were lighted, and a supper was laid for
two upon the table in the center. It was a
fast day, and there were some salted eels, a
gurnet and a chet loaf set out, with a tankard
of ale; for my Lady Crabtree always did good
trencher duty even when fasting, which she
did after her own fashion.

[314]
Betty Carew could not eat, she was far too anxious
for the fate of the man she loved, and she
walked to and fro, wrapped in her own thoughts
and alone, having dismissed the woman. Lord
Raby had been before the Council, but doubtless,
by this time, was back in the Tower.
How had it fared with him? she wondered.
Had his innocence shone out clear as noonday,
or had he been entrapped by the skilful cross-questioning
and false accusations of his enemies?
Believing in him with all her heart,
she was yet fully conscious of the pitfalls in
these secret proceedings, and she trembled for
him. It was in her nature to love him more
dearly in the hour of his evil fortune; she
possessed that loyalty which is unshaken by
the sharpest trials, and her greatest sorrow
now was her own inability to fight his battles
for him. Her persistence had won the kingâs
attention to his case, had roused even her
uncle from his angry apathy, had stirred old
Madam to energetic action; but now, at the
supreme moment, being a woman, she was
powerless to help him. She longed for Sir
Williamâs summons, which would mean that
something material had been accomplished,
and in her eagerness, she ran twenty times to
the window and looked down into the street; a
[315]

light burned in the court, and this showed her
that there was no one at the door. The time
dragged wearily; Lady Crabtree came not, and
there seemed little hope of any decisive action
that night. Weary of her restless walk, she
sat down by the fire, which was beginning to
burn low, and waited. Every sound in the
house, every step in the hall made her start
with impatience; yet she scarcely knew what
she expected. Nature has strong claims upon
the young and healthy; no matter how great the
anxiety, sleep comes at last, stealing over
the senses, pressing down the lids, stilling the
eager heart-beats. Betty had been under an
almost continuous strain, and the warmth of the
fire relaxed her nerves, comforted her physical
weariness; her head drooped on her hand,
her eyes closed, her breathing became soft and
regular, in a few moments she would have
drifted into unconsciousness. But suddenly
there was a stir below, the sound of feet on the
stairs, and Lady Crabtreeâs woman came hurrying
in. Betty started up at once, alert and
eager.

ââTis a message from my uncle!â she
exclaimed; âfrom Sir William Carew?â

âTwo men with a litter below, mistress,â
the woman replied, âand a message from Sir
[316]

William that you come at once to his lodgings.â

Bettyâs fingers trembled with eagerness as
she fastened her cloak with the attendantâs
aid. Something had happened, something was
known; she could not brook a momentâs delay.

âShall I go with you, Mistress Betty?â the
tirewoman asked.

âNay; you must stay for Lady Crabtree,â
Betty replied; âand tell her where I am. It
does not matter; I can go alone with my
uncleâs servants.â

Without further delay, she ran lightly down
the stairs, where she found two serving men
in Sir Williamâs livery, and at the door a
litter carried by four others, and there were
two pages with lanterns. She did not recognize
any of the men, but observed that
one was cross-eyed, a powerful fellow, standing
by the litter. She asked no questions,
but sprang into her place, dropping the curtains
to keep out the chill night air, and in
a moment they were off upon their journey.
Her attendants said nothing, but walked so
rapidly along the streets that she was jolted
from side to side; but they could not travel
fast enough to keep pace with her eagerness.
Twice or thrice she peeped out from behind
[317]

her curtains, but the night was so dark that
she could not see beyond the small circles of
light made by the lanterns. They passed the
watch, for she heard them answering his challenge,
and it seemed to her that it took longer
to reach Sir Williamâs lodgings than it had
taken to come from them earlier in the evening.
Yet no doubt crossed her feverishly
excited brain, and she was all hope and expectation
when at last the party halted, and the
men helped her to alight. She had been but
once to her uncleâs quarters, and was not sufficiently
familiar with them to be startled when
she found herself at the door of a tall house;
but something in its aspect roused her first
suspicion. Before she could realize where she
was, the door opened, and partly because she
was not yet aroused, and partly, too, because
the men gathered behind her, leaving no
retreat, she entered, and seeing a staircase like
the one at Sir Williamâs lodgings, began to
ascend. Stopping half-way, she asked the man
who followed her, the cross-eyed escort, where
her uncle was? He pointed to a door before
her without speaking, and she opened it and
walked in. It was dimly lighted, and at the
farther end was standing a tall man with his
back toward her.

[318]
âUncle, I have come,â she exclaimed; âwhat
tidings have you?â

He turned and came slowly forward; as the
light of the solitary taper that burned on the
table fell on his face, she recognized Sir
Barton Henge.

[319]

CHAPTER XXIX

MASTER CROSS-EYES

The
instant that Betty Carew recognized
Sir Bartonâs dark face, she recoiled with a cry
of terror. Her first thought was of the door by
which she had entered, but when she ran to it
she found it fastened on the outside. There
was another entrance, but that was behind
Henge, and he stepped back, and locking it,
put the key in his pocket with a grim smile.
She was a prisoner; but after the first moment
of dismay, she collected herself and confronted
him with spirit. She was angry at his insolent
daring, and her cheeks flushed and her
eyes sparkled.

âSir,â she said proudly, âwhat means this?
How dare you so insult me? Undo the door
and let me go or you will answer for it to my
uncle!â

Henge laughed and sneered.

âYou take a high tone, mistress,â he said
tauntingly, âbut it will be long ere Carew
finds you; you are safe enough at last!â

[320]
Bettyâs anger for the time conquered her
womanly fears; her hatred of the man, her
contempt for an act that seemed to her one of
cowardly wickedness, made her forgetful of
her peril.

âYou villain!â she cried, her form quivering
with passion, âhave you no better employment
than to make war on a defenceless
woman? It is like you! He who would strike
a man from ambush is capable of any shamelessness.
Undo the door, sir, or I will call
the watch and make your name a byword in
London!â

âScream your loudest; it will not aid you,â
he retorted coolly. âCome, come, my pretty
shrew; I have you now, and you shall rue the
day you struck my face with your whip.â

In spite of her anger, a feeling of dismay
was beginning to shake Mistress Bettyâs resolution.
She remembered that there was a
little dagger in her belt that she had thrust
there in the morning when she set out to the
Tower. The thought of it was some small
comfort; she had, at least, a weapon. She
would not let him see any wavering; she held
her head high and faced him like a beautiful
fury.

âIf you dare to harm me,â she said haughtily,
[321]

âSir William Carew will leave no stone unturned
until you are brought to justice.â

Henge laughed again his unpleasant laugh,
that rang in her ears with the sound of triumph
in it.

âLook you, fair mistress, is it well to flaunt
your influence in my face?â he asked her.
âYou and your precious lover defied me.
Where is Simon Raby now? Safe, where he
can neither save you nor himself. A traitor
in the Tower! Beware, lest Carew falls in a
like trap.â

âAh, now I know!â cried Betty; âa fool I
was, and blind. âTis you who ensnared Lord
Raby! âtis you who would ruin my uncle.
Villain! liar! coward! I defy you!â

âYou young she-devil, you!â exclaimed
Henge, advancing toward her, âI would wring
that white neck of yours for your insults, did
I not know I could invent a slower, surer
punishment. I have you, my shrew, and you
shall not escape me.â

At his first step toward her, Betty retreated
to a window, and now she tried to unfasten the
shutter, crying out for help at the top of her
strong, young voice.

âScream away!â said Henge bitterly, his
face full of dark enjoyment of her despair, âno
[322]

one will help you; a screaming woman in this
quarter of the town is no novelty. Do you
look for your lover from the Tower to rescue
you? You pretty fool!â he added contemptuously,
âyou are mine, mine as sure as death!â

Betty was no coward; she put her hand to
her girdle and felt the little knife there safe.
She meant to kill himâor herself. She had
a firm, strong wrist and she could strike; he
was a powerful man, but he did not know that
she was armed, and an unlooked-for blow might
end the matter. She saw the evil triumph in
his face and set her teeth; she would kill him.
He, unconscious of her purpose, looked at her
and smiled, as a devil might, who saw his prey
before him.

At this moment there was a strange interruption;
the door that Henge had not fastened,
the one that had been secured from without,
opened, and the cross-eyed man entered, and
closing it behind him, stood, with his arms
folded on his breast, staring at Sir Barton, who,
in turn, glared at him in furious surprise.

âWhat are you here for, Master Cross-Eyes?â
he exclaimed. âGet out, you rogue,
or I will break a rod on your bare back and slit
your ears, to boot.â

The groom pointed at Betty.

[323]
âShe screamed,â he said sullenly; âif you
hurt a hair of her head, Iâll cut your throat,
my master!â

âYou accursed villain, you!â cried Henge,
in furious anger, âhow dare you threaten me?
Is it for this that I dragged you from the
gutter?â

âNay,â retorted Master Cross-Eyes, unmoved;
âyou picked me up from the slums
because you wanted desperate men to do your
bidding; and so I would, if the case were
different, but Mistress Carew you shall not
hurt.â

So amazed was Henge at the varletâs courage,
that he did not spurn him from the room
at once, but stared at him as if he doubted his
own senses.

âAnd wherefore?â he asked harshly; âwhat
is Mistress Carew to you, you hound?â

âOne good turn deserves another, Sir
Barton,â the groom answered curtly; âthis
young mistress saved my neck from the halter
at Deptford when old Lady Crabtree would
have hung me as a valiant beggar. The young
lady saved me, and, by Saint Michael and his
angels, you shall not harm one black hair of
her pretty head!â

âThe devil take your insolence!â retorted
[324]

Henge violently, drawing his sword and raising
his arm to strike the man on the head with
the flat of it, intending to administer a lesson.

But Master Cross-Eyes was more than his
match in strength; he caught his arm, and
twisting it back, sent the sword flying across
the room, pushing Henge toward the wall as
he did so. Sir Barton, now fully roused to his
peril, grappled with his powerful adversary,
calling loudly for help as he did so.

âWhat ho!â he shouted, âJohn! Andrew!
Here, you villains, take this fellow to the
gallows!â

Master Cross-Eyes laughed, much as Sir
Barton had at Bettyâs cries for aid.

âI sent them all below,â he said grimly;
âyou may scream as loud as my young lady
now, and get no aid.â

The two men swayed and struggled, the
vagrant having the advantage, yet closely
pressed by Henge, who was no mean opponent
and had the strength of wrath. They overturned
the table, and the taper being extinguished,
the struggle continued in darkness.
Sir Barton was striving to reach the door and
Cross-Eyes was pressing him away.

At first Betty was so wholly fascinated by
the contest, so amazed, that she stood gazing,
[325]

completely unnerved, her courage deserting
her now that a champion was so suddenly
raised up for her. But in a moment
the full peril of her own situation returned to
her mind, and she looked for a way to escape
while the two were fighting. However, this
was not easy; one door was still locked, and
before the other the men were struggling; she
could not pass them and get out, for they
swayed to and fro before the entrance, and
when the taper was extinguished, she could
not see to move. In her extremity, she put
out all her strength, and undoing the shutters
at last, threw them open, and leaning from the
window, screamed for the watch. In spite of
the noise that the two men made fighting, she
heard an answering shout, and cried out again
that there was murder being done. As she
did so, there was a groan of pain from Master
Cross-Eyes and he fell heavily to the floor;
Henge had wrenched his hand free from his
adversaryâs grip, and drawing his dagger,
stabbed him. With an oath, Sir Barton threw
open the door and snatched a taper from its
socket in the hall and brought it into the room;
the sudden light revealed to Betty the prostrate
figure of her defender and the furious
aspect of her enemy. He kicked the groom as
[326]

he passed him and then picked up his sword.
Seeing her last hope of escape cut off, Betty
again leaned from the window and called for
help. This time the reply came from the court
below, and there was a noise at the door.
Expecting the watch, Sir Barton turned with a
curse to confront him, his naked sword in his
hand. The scene was one of wild confusion;
the taper he had brought, and the light from
the hall showed the scene of the struggle, the
overturned table and chairs, the unconscious
body of the vagrant, and in the window Bettyâs
tall figure and white face. Henge himself
stood waiting defiantly, his dress wildly disordered,
and his breast heaving from his recent
struggle. Footsteps came up the stairs, paused
as if a stranger were looking about for the room
from which the screams had issued, and then
came across the hall. The next moment a man
stood on the threshold, and at the sight of him
Betty uttered a wild cry of amazement and joy,
while Henge swore a deep oath, but recoiled a
step as if he saw a ghost.

It was Simon Raby.

[327]

CHAPTER XXX

SIR WILLIAM WINS A WAGER

Simon Raby
stood only a moment on the
threshold; a single glance at the interior of
the room, at Betty, at Master Cross-Eyes,
lying prostrate, and at the furious face of
Henge, sufficed to tell him all. The next
instant his sword flashed in the air like a
ribbon of steel, and he sprang upon Sir Barton
with the fury of revenge.

âYou villain!â he cried, âwas it not enough
to send me to the Tower, but you must also
insult and injure women?â

âCurse you!â answered Henge, between
his teeth, âthis shall be the end of you, you
fool!â

âBy heaven!â exclaimed Raby, as their
swords crossed, ââtwill be either you or I!â

Both were powerful men and good swordsmen,
and it being the second time that they
had fought, each knew something of the otherâs
play. Henge was spent from his struggle with
the groom and Raby had felt the effects of
[328]

the long imprisonment, but both fought with
furious zeal, and knowing that death was in the
issue, they put out all their skill. Foot to
foot and eye to eye, they thrust and parried;
Raby taking the offensive and using the point
as he endeavored to strike under his adversaryâs
guard, but Henge was one of the finest swordsmen
of the court and parried every blow with
marvellous rapidity and skill. The breath of
both came short, the drops of perspiration
gathered on Hengeâs forehead, while Lord
Rabyâs face paled about the lips. It was but
the different way in which each showed the
strain. So determined was Simonâs onset, that
he drove Sir Barton back step by step toward
the table, meaning to trip him and so have him
at his mercy; but Henge knew the trap that
was set for him and swerved to one side, dealing
at the same instant so dexterous a blow
that he nearly disarmed his opponent. There
was no sound in the room but the clash of
swords and the labored breathing of the two
combatants. It was a spectacle worth seeing,
the equal contest of two expert fencers. For a
few moments Betty Carew had remained at her
post by the window, so amazed at Rabyâs
entrance, so alarmed for his safety, that it
paralyzed her senses. But at the sight of Sir
[329]

Bartonâs apparent gain, she awoke from her
trance and ran to them, throwing herself on
Hengeâs sword arm with all her strength; but
he took his weapon in his left hand and parried
Rabyâs blows while endeavoring to shake her
off.

âLet be, my darling!â Simon cried; âI
dare not strike freely with you in the way; let
beâand I will end it.â

But Mistress Betty would scarcely have
obeyed him but for the sound of footsteps on
the stairs. She ran out into the hall to learn
whether it was friend or foe, and saw, to her
amazement, old Madamâs hawk face upon the
landing, and behind her the captain of the
watch and two more armed men. Betty cried
out with joyful surprise.

âHelp, help!â she exclaimed, âhere is the
villain Henge trying to murder Simon Raby.â

âThis all comes of Rabyâs mad haste!â
retorted Lady Crabtree; ââtis ever so with
fools and lovers.â

But while she stayed to scold, the captain
of the watch and Betty had hurried back into
the room. As they reached the entrance, however,
there was a heavy fall, and they found
Simon Raby standing with his foot on Sir
Bartonâs breast and the point of his sword at
[330]

his throat, while Master Cross-Eyes, who had
recovered from his swoon, sat up, staring
blankly at the changed scene. The captain of
the watch uttered an exclamation and hurried
forward.

âHave you killed him, my lord?â he asked.

Henge lay so still that Raby stirred him
with his foot.

âI know not,â he answered; âhe has a
thrust below the collar bone, but I think âtis
too high for his heart. I got a blow under his
guard and he went down like a sack of salt,
and has not opened his eyes since.â

ââTwas a pity to kill him,â the officer said,
laying his hand on the fallen manâs heart;
âmy lord privy seal would have him taken
alive at all costs.â

The room began to fill with strangers, twenty
torches and lanterns were about it and on the
stairs; the court was thronged with a gaping
crowd that fell back to let two new-comers
pass, Sir William Carew and Cromwell. Some
one had run for a leech, and the little man
came hurrying in with his bag and knelt on
the other side of Henge, opposite the captain.
Old Madam was there, her farthingale tucked
up and her great boots showing, and Betty
Carew stood leaning on the arm of Lord Raby,
[331]

who had no eyes save for her, and was whispering
in her ear fond and joyful words while the
others gathered around Henge. There was
silence and confusion, however, when my lord
privy seal entered with Carew.

âAh, this is blundering work!â Cromwell
exclaimed, at the sight of the prostrate figure;
âthis man was needed by the State. Who
did this?â

Raby stood forth, and in a moment the light
of all the torches was centered on his pale face
and disordered dress.

âMy lord,â he said, ââtwas I who disobeyed
your instructions. When I received the warning,
sent by one of this villainâs grooms, I ran
with all speed to the house, and hearing a cry
for help, came in, the door being unlocked, as
had been promised. I found this devil here,
trying to keep this young lady a prisoner.
We fought and he fell; I knew not that I had
seriously hurt him.â

Cromwell was watching the doctor, who had
his ear against Sir Bartonâs breast.

âIs he gone?â he asked sharply.

âNay, my lord,â replied the physician, looking
up; âhe lives, but he is sorely wounded
and stunned too, by striking his head on the
table as he fell.â

[332]
âUse your skill to save him,â said Cromwell,
coldly; âthe State requires this witness.â
Then turning to Raby, âMy lord, matters
standing as they do, I pardon you; but never
try to cheat the headsman, albeit âtis the
natural office of a good knight to rescue distressed
demoiselles, and this fair lady merited
the service at your hands, having ever been a
suitor for you, even to the kingâs grace. Sir
William,â he went on, âhow came this ending
to the muddle?â

âMy lord, I caught Rabyâs servant, Shaxter,
early in the evening, and, as you know, my
Lady Crabtree and I soon found a way to
make him confess that Henge had bribed
him to change the packet that I gave to Raby
for one that Henge had full of treasonable
matter. Shaxter changed the packets when
he helped his master to dress, just before he
was arrested.â

âAy, arrested at the complaint of Henge,
who came to me with every protest of loyalty;
not that he deceived me,â Cromwell added,
âbut the papers found on Lord Raby did
mightily confirm his words. I know how you
brought the villain Shaxter to me when I had
Raby at my house for private examination; it
was a happy matter that I could at once release
[333]

him, but how came this villainâs schemes to-night
to miscarry so?â

âHis servants were all false to him,â Sir
William answered, âand one of them sent us
warning that he intended to carry off my niece,
whom he has ever claimed as his affianced wife
because of an old contract made when she was
born. I know not yet which varlet of his did
us this signal service.â

Cromwellâs keen eyes alighted on Master
Cross-Eyes, who sat leaning on the table, too
badly hurt to rise, but overlooked in the tumult.

âAh, who is this?â asked the privy seal;
âhow many were in this affray?â

Betty Carew came forward now and answered
for her champion.

âSir,â she said eagerly, âbut for that man
I should scarcely have escaped so soon. He
took my part, and fought with Henge in my
behalf, and from my heart I thank him.â

âIs it so?â exclaimed Cromwell, glancing
in some surprise at the unpleasing aspect of
the man; âwhat say you, knave, how came you
to serve this lady?â

Master Cross-Eyes looked up without any
change in the sullen expression of his face.

âThe young mistress saved me from the
hangman when yonder big-nosed woman would
[334]

have put a halter on my neck,â he retorted
bluntly, conscious that his nightâs work would
protect him; âand I sent the warning to Sir
William, despatched my comrades, who hated
Henge, for he was ever a hard master, full of
blows and curses and slow to pay, and I stayed
to protect Mistress Carew.â

âBy Saint Thomas, âtis the valiant beggar
that I had scourged at Wildrick!â cried old
Madam; âmay Heaven forgive me for it! You
shall have a gold piece for every blow and
more,â she added. âHere, Sir Leech, look to
his wounds at my cost.â

âHis service has atoned his fault,â Cromwell
said gravely; âbut look you, varlet, being
strong enough to fight and shrewd enough to
catch a traitor, if you do not work henceforth,
you shall hang at Tyburn.â

âMy lord,â interposed Raby, âhe will be
taken into my service for his lifetime, and that
is not enough to pay the debt.â

âAy,â said Carew, âand he is like to make
a better servant than the knave we have in jail,
who served you as I foretold. My lord, you
owe me the wager.â

âIt shall be paid,â Raby answered heartily;
âyet do I think you never dreamed that he was
as bad as he has proved.â

[335]
ââTis as I told you,â Sir William retorted
dryly.

While this was passing, Cromwell gave
some brief directions to the captain of the
watch and his assistants, who were lifting
Hengeâs still unconscious form upon a
stretcher.

âTo the Tower,â said the kingâs minister,
âand keep him safe; to-morrow he will have to
answer to the Council if he lives,âhe and
Zachary Sanders.â

Lord Raby had tenderly placed the mantle
about Bettyâs shoulders and drawn her arm
through his, for they were all preparing to
leave the house. Cromwell, turning from his
talk with the officers, looked at the lovers, and
a smile lighted up for a moment the stern
reserve of his strong face.

âMy Lord Raby,â he said quietly, ânever,
I think, had man better cause to bless his fate
for giving him a faithful heart. This lady hath
been untiring, brave, and loyal in her suit for
you. Save for her, the kingâs grace would
scarcely have thought of your cause in this sad
hour, when the Queen of England lies dead at
Hampton Court. Fair and faithful Mistress
Carew,â he added, bowing low over Bettyâs
hand, âI have had to fulfil an unpleasant office;
[336]

the kingâs servant must do his duty even
though he should break a womanâs heart; but
never yet have I done mine so heavily as when
I turned a deaf ear to your suit. I shall take it
ill if you ask me not to the wedding.â

[337]

CHAPTER XXXI

THE WIZARDâS FATE

In
the trial that followed, the lost threads
of the great conspiracy were found; and more,
it was said that the secret examination of
Henge gave Cromwell the first clue to the
treason of Exeter and Lady Salisbury, and
more noble blood flowed on the scaffold. Sir
Barton suffered a traitorâs death, dying as
impenitent as he had lived, and cursing his
fate that Zachary Sanders did not share it.
And he did not, although the case against him
was far stronger than against his more violent
accomplice. The wizard was tried and condemned
to be hanged, but no halter was placed
around his neck.

A strange thing happened. The day set for
his execution came, and he was led out of the
Traitorsâ Gate into a barge to take him to the
place where he was to suffer for his treason,
which had been black enough to hang forty
men as well as one. He was bound, at least,
so said the Lieutenant of the Tower, and went
[338]

under strong guard in the kingâs boat, yet in
mid stream he leaped overboard and disappeared.
His keepers swore that it was magic;
one smelled sulphur and one swooned with
horror at a vision he saw in the water. The
truth of the matter no man ever knew, except
that six stout yeomen of the Tower suffered for
the prisonerâs escape, and the wizard was never
seen alive again. But for years afterwards
there was a story that he haunted his house
upon the Thames, and that at night a red light
shone from every window, and his small figure
was seen flitting about on the flat roofs of those
two upper stories. The shadow of the little
man in the russet cloak haunted every old
wifeâs memory in that neighborhood, and
whether he lay dead at the bottom of the river,
or lived in some other region, he was still a
terror to the imagination of many of his old-time
clients, and his name hushed many a crying
child with terror when all else had failed.
It was even whispered that had he been set
free, Queen Jane would not have sickened and
died, and Prince Edward would have been a
baby of better promise, and not with that look
which made the old women shake their heads
in grim foreboding.

At Christmas of that year, the bells rang
[339]

merrily at Mohunâs Ottery, and my lord privy
seal came there to grace the wedding of Lord
Raby and Mistress Betty Carew; and the
bride wore on her neck a splendid jewel, sent
by the kingâs grace in memory of her petition
for her lover. Nor was she portionless,
although the child of Sir Thomas, for my Lady
Crabtree gave her a dowry, and it was said
that in old Madamâs will she was the heiress
to the vast fortune that had accumulated and
doubled under Lady Crabtreeâs shrewd management.
Sir William Carew gave away the
bride, who looked the great beauty that she
was in her white robes and with the light of
love and happiness, which is a wondrous beautifier,
in her brown eyes. It was said that
there had never been a more stately or handsome
couple wedded in Devon, or a finer wedding;
though some stared at the groomâs
strange servant, for Master Cross-Eyes, even
in his wedding garments, looked a rough
attendant; but to Lady Raby he seemed an
angel in disguise.

Standing beside her husband, Betty looked
about the great hall thronged with guests in
her honor, and in her heart she remembered
the sad and penniless orphan who had come
there a few years before. In her happiness
[340]

she did not forget her thanksgiving to Heaven
for the wonderful change which had come into
her life, which, stretching out before her in a
golden vista, seemed to hold only love and
hope.

THE END.

The scene of this thrilling story is Moscow, and the
time, the boyhood of Peter the Great. Much of the action
takes place âOn The Red Staircaseâ in the palace of the
Kremlin.

It is a thrilling tale of intrigue and barbaric plot. A French viscount
visiting Moscow on a diplomatic service is the hero; and his adventures
while trying to rescue the beautiful Zenaide from a cruel uncle, who is
bent upon marrying her to a profligate, are constant and of an intense
order of interest.... The scenes are exciting. Escapes follow escapes.
Secret missions with packets (stolen by hidden pursuers) are incidents of
the plot; while sword-cuts, pinionings, attacks of all kinds, kidnapping,
and desperate acts fill the pages.... The book is exciting, well sustained
and excellently written.... Another âZendaâ story.â
Chicago Times-Herald.

A most vivid and absorbing tale of love and adventure.... Miss
Taylor has certainly an unusual gift of vivid word painting; and as we
read, we can almost see the savage mob, and feel ourselves to be in danger.
âOn the Red Staircaseâ will give a far truer, because more striking
and life-like, picture of early Russian history than a multitude of
laboriously written and ponderous histories of the time, and the authoress
has apparently a most promising future before her.â
The Churchman,
New York.

After the many problem-novels and the myriad psychological disquisitions
disguised as fiction, a wholesome, breezy tale like this, honestly
and brilliantly told for its own sake, is a real treat to be enjoyed without
thought or criticism.â
The Bookman, New York.

A strong, bracing story it is, and one which gives us a clear view of
an exceptionally interesting epoch in Russian history.â

An Imperial Lover

By M. IMLAY TAYLOR

With Frontispiece. 12mo. 377 pages. Price, $1.25

Miss M. Imlay Taylor will be remembered as the author
of a spirited Russian historical novel called âOn the Red
Staircase,â which has attained a wide reading the past year.
She has now written a second novel of the same general description,
called âAn Imperial Lover.â Again the scene is
the Russian court, this time in the reign of Peter the Great,
who plays a very important part in the plot. The tale is one
of love, of intrigue, and of adventure, and seems to us even
better than its predecessor.â
The Outlook
, New York.

The setting is admirably adapted to development under
a skillful hand, and the author has succeeded in this undertaking.â
The
Washington Star.

M. Imlay Taylor has the story-tellerâs gift in perfection.
Every word of her new Russian romance, âAn Imperial
Lover,â is as captivating as was every word of âOn the Red
Staircase.ââ
The Times-Herald
, Chicago.

The story abounds in exciting incidents and has no dull
pages.â
The Inter-Ocean
, Chicago.

M. Imlay Taylor gives us a picturesque and interesting
sketch of Moscow society during an eminently interesting
period, and tells a capital story.â
The Scotsman
, Edinburgh.

The novel not only shows careful and intelligent study of
the period, but it is skilfully constructed, well written, and
thoroughly interesting.â

A Yankee Volunteer

By M. IMLAY TAYLOR

12mo. 383 pages. Price, $1.25

A painstaking chronicle of the principal incidents in the
sanguinary struggle between Great Britain and her North
American Colonies.... There is not a dull page in this excellent
historical romance.â
Daily Telegraph
, London, Eng.

It is a far cry from Russia to the United States, yet Mary
Imlay Taylor, who has written some most interesting stories
of intrigue and fighting at St. Petersburg, shows in her latest
romance, âA Yankee Volunteer,â that she is quite as much
at home in America as in the Czarâs country. Her new book
has for historic background the events of the first half of the
Revolutionary War, and it tells a love story which is charming
and quite a part of the stern adventures that make a hero.â
Evening
Bulletin
, Philadelphia.

It is a good storyâthis of the Yankee rebelââso gallant
in love and so dauntless in war,â and of the sweet Royalist
who at last became a ârebelâ for love of him.â
Living
Church
, Chicago.

âA Yankee Volunteerâ is indeed a story fraught with
such exquisite beauty as is seldom associated with history.â
Boston
Times.

The story is beautifully written, and moves with the
dignity and quaintness inseparable from the successful historical
novel.â
St. Paul Pioneer Press.

A fascinating picture of the royalist and patriot social
elements of revolutionary days.â

THE BEVERLEYS.

A Story of Calcutta.

BY MARY ABBOTT,

Author of âAlexia,â etc.

12mo. 264 pages. Price, $1.00

The uncommonly favorable reception of Mrs. Abbottâs brilliant
novelette, âAlexia,â by the public bespeaks in advance a lively
interest in her new novel, âThe Beverleys.â It is a more extended
and ambitious work than the former, but has the same grace of style
and liveliness of treatment, together with a much more considerable
plot and more subtle delineations of character and life. The action
of the story takes place in India, and reveals on the part of the
authoress the most intimate knowledge of the official life of the
large and aristocratic English colony in Calcutta. The local coloring
is strong and unusual.

A more joyous story cannot be imagined.... A harum-scarum
good-nature; a frank pursuit of cakes and ale; a heedless, happy-go-lucky
spirit, are admirable components in a novel, however trying
they may be found in the walks of daily life. Such are the pleasures
of âThe Beverleys.â To read it is recreation, indeed.â
Public
Ledger, Philadelphia.

The author writes throughout with good taste, and with a quick
eye for the picturesque.â
Herald, New York.

It is a pretty story, charmingly written, with cleverly sketched
pictures of various types of character.... The book abounds in
keen, incisive philosophy, wrapped up in characteristic remarks.â
Times,
Chicago.

An absorbing story. It is brilliantly and vivaciously written.â
Literary
World, Boston.

The author has until now been known, so far as we are aware,
only by her former story, âAlexia.â Unless signs fail which seldom

do
fail, these two with which her name is now associated are
simply the forerunners of works in a like vein of which American
literature will have reason to be proud.â
Standard, Chicago.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

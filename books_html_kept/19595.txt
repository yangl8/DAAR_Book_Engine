As

it your greateſt commendation not to be talked of one

MADAM,

If
you were only one of the fineſt
writers of your time, you would
probably have eſcaped the trouble of
this addreſs, which is drawn on you,
leſs by the luſtre of your underſtanding,
than by the amiable qualities of your
heart.

As
the following pages are written
with an humble but earneſt wiſh, to
promote the intereſts of virtue, as far
as the very limited abilities of the author
allow; there is, I flatter myself,
a peculiar propriety in inſcribing them
to you, Madam, who, while your
works convey inſtruction and delight
to the beſt-informed of the other ſex,
furniſh, by your conduct, an admirable
pattern of life and manners to
your own. And I can with truth remark,
that thoſe graces of converſation,
which would be the firſt praiſe of almoſt
any other character, conſtitute
but an inferior part of yours.

I am,
Madam
,

With the higheſt eſteem,

Your moſt obedient

Humble Servant,

Briſtol

INTRODUCTION.

It
is with the utmoſt diffidence
that the following pages are ſubmitted
to the inſpection of the
Public: yet, however the limited abilities
of the author may have prevented
her from ſucceeding to her wiſh in the
execution of her preſent attempt, ſhe
humbly truſts that the uprightneſs of
her intention will procure it a candid
and favourable reception. The following
little Eſſays are chiefly calculated
for the younger part of her own
[p 2]

ſex, who, ſhe flatters herſelf, will not
eſteem them the leſs, becauſe they were
written immediately for their ſervice.
She by no means pretends to have
compoſed a regular ſyſtem of morals,
or a finiſhed plan of conduct: ſhe has
only endeavoured to make a few remarks
on ſuch circumſtances as ſeemed
to her ſuſceptible of ſome improvement,
and on ſuch ſubjects as ſhe imagined
were particularly intereſting to
young ladies, on their firſt introduction
into the world. She hopes they
will not be offended if ſhe has occaſionally
pointed out certain qualities,
and ſuggeſted certain tempers, and
diſpoſitions, as
peculiarly feminine
, and
hazarded ſome obſervations which naturally
aroſe from the ſubject, on the
different characters which mark the
ſexes. And here again ſhe takes the
liberty to repeat that theſe diſtinctions
[p 3]

cannot be too nicely maintained; for
beſides thoſe important qualities common
to both, each ſex has its reſpective,
appropriated qualifications, which
would ceaſe to be meritorious, the inſtant
they ceaſed to be appropriated.
Nature, propriety, and cuſtom have
preſcribed certain bounds to each;
bounds which the prudent and the
candid will never attempt to break
down; and indeed it would be highly
impolitic to annihilate diſtinctions from
which each acquires excellence, and
to attempt innovations, by which both
would be loſers.

Women
therefore never underſtand
their own intereſts ſo little, as when
they affect thoſe qualities and accompliſhments,
from the want of which
they derive their higheſt merit. "The

porcelain
clay of human kind," ſays
[p 4]

an admired writer, ſpeaking of the ſex.
Greater delicacy evidently implies
greater fragility; and this weakneſs, natural
and moral, clearly points out the
neceſſity of a ſuperior degree of caution,
retirement, and reſerve.

If
the author may be allowed to
keep up the alluſion of the poet, juſt
quoted, ſhe would aſk if we do not
put the fineſt vaſes, and the coſtlieſt
images in places of the greateſt ſecurity,
and moſt remote from any probability
of accident, or deſtruction?
By being ſo ſituated, they find their
protection in their weakneſs, and their
ſafety in their delicacy. This metaphor
is far from being uſed with a deſign
of placing young ladies in a trivial,
unimportant light; it is only
introduced to inſinuate, that where
there is more beauty, and more weakneſs,
[p 5]

there ſhould be greater circumſpection,
and ſuperior prudence.

Men
, on the contrary, are formed
for the more public exhibitions on the
great theatre of human life. Like the
ſtronger and more ſubſtantial wares,
they derive no injury, and loſe no
poliſh by being always expoſed, and
engaged in the conſtant commerce of
the world. It is their proper element,
where they reſpire their natural air,
and exert their nobleſt powers, in
ſituations which call them into action.
They were intended by Providence for
the buſtling ſcenes of life; to appear
terrible in arms, uſeful in commerce,
ſhining in counſels.

The
Author fears it will be hazarding
a very bold remark, in the opinion
of many ladies, when ſhe adds,
[p 6]

that the female mind, in general, does
not appear capable of attaining ſo
high a degree of perfection in ſcience
as the male. Yet ſhe hopes to be forgiven
when ſhe obſerves alſo, that as
it does not ſeem to derive the chief
portion of its excellence from extraordinary
abilities of this kind, it is
not at all leſſened by the imputation of
not poſſeſſing them. It is readily allowed,
that the ſex have lively imaginations,
and thoſe exquiſite perceptions
of the beautiful and defective,
which come under the denomination of
Taſte. But pretenſions to that ſtrength
of intellect, which is requiſite to penetrate
into the abſtruſer walks of literature,
it is preſumed they will readily
relinquiſh. There are green paſtures,
and pleaſant vallies, where they
may wander with ſafety to themſelves,
and delight to others. They may cultivate
[p 7]

the roſes of imagination, and the
valuable fruits of morals and criticiſm;
but the steepſ of Parnaſſus few,
comparatively, have attempted to ſcale
with ſucceſs. And when it is conſidered,
that many languages, and many
ſciences, muſt contribute to the perfection
of poetical compoſition, it will
appear leſs ſtrange. The lofty Epic,
the pointed Satire, and the more daring
and ſucceſsful flights of the Tragic
Muſe, ſeem reſerved for the bold adventurers
of the other ſex.

Nor
does this aſſertion, it is apprehended,
at all injure the intereſts of
the women; they have other pretenſions,
on which to value themſelves,
and other qualities much better calculated
to anſwer their particular purpoſes.
We are enamoured of the ſoft
ſtrains of the Sicilian and the Mantuan
[p 8]

Muſe, while, to the ſweet notes of the
paſtoral reed, they ſing the Contentions
of the Shepherds, the Bleſſings of
Love, or the innocent Delights of rural
Life. Has it ever been aſcribed to
them as a defect, that their Eclogues
do not treat of active ſcenes, of buſy
cities, and of waſting war? No:
their ſimplicity is their perfection, and
they are only blamed when they have
too little of it.

On
the other hand, the lofty bards
who ſtrung their bolder harps to higher
meaſures, and ſung the
Wrath
of
Peleus'
Son
, and
Man's firſt Diſobedience
,
have never been cenſured for want
of ſweetneſs and refinement. The ſublime,
the nervous, and the maſculine,
characteriſe their compoſitions; as the
beautiful, the ſoft, and the delicate,
mark thoſe of the others. Grandeur,
[p 9]

dignity, and force, diſtinguiſh the one
ſpecies; eaſe, ſimplicity, and purity,
the other. Both ſhine from their native,
diſtinct, unborrowed merits, not
from thoſe which are foreign, adventitious,
and unnatural. Yet thoſe excellencies,
which make up the eſſential
and conſtituent parts of poetry, they
have in common.

Women
have generally quicker perceptions;
men have juſter ſentiments.—Women
conſider how things may
be prettily ſaid; men how they may
be properly ſaid.—In women, (young
ones at leaſt) ſpeaking accompanies,
and ſometimes precedes reflection; in
men, reflection is the antecedent.—Women
ſpeak to ſhine or to pleaſe;
men, to convince or confute.—Women
admire what is brilliant; men
what is ſolid.—Women prefer an extemporaneous
[p 10]

ſally of wit, or a ſparkling
effuſion of fancy, before the moſt
accurate reaſoning, or the moſt laborious
inveſtigation of facts. In literary
compoſition, women are pleaſed
with point, turn, and antitheſis; men
with obſervation, and a juſt deduction
of effects from their cauſes.—Women
are fond of incident, men of
argument.—Women admire paſſionately,
men approve cautiouſly.—One ſex
will think it betrays a want of feeling
to be moderate in their applauſe,
the other will be afraid of expoſing a
want of judgment by being in raptures
with any thing.—Men refuſe to
give way to the emotions they actually
feel, while women ſometimes affect
to be tranſported beyond what
the occaſion will juſtify.
[p 11]

As
a farther confirmation of what
has been advanced on the different
bent of the underſtanding in the
ſexes, it may be obſerved, that we
have heard of many female wits, but
never of one female logician—of many
admirable writers of memoirs, but never
of one chronologer.—In the boundleſs
and aërial regions of romance, and
in that faſhionable ſpecies of compoſition
which ſucceeded it, and which
carries a nearer approximation to the
manners of the world, the women
cannot be excelled: this imaginary
ſoil they have a peculiar talent for cultivating,
becauſe here,

Invention labours more, and judgment leſs.

The
merit of this kind of writing
conſiſts in the
vraiſemblance
to real
life as to the events themſelves, with
[p 12]

a certain elevation in the narrative,
which places them, if not above what
is natural, yet above what is common.
It farther conſiſts in the art of intereſting
the tender feelings by a pathetic
repreſentation of thoſe minute, endearing,
domeſtic circumſtances, which
take captive the ſoul before it has
time to ſhield itſelf with the armour
of reflection. To amuſe, rather than
to inſtruct, or to inſtruct indirectly by
ſhort inferences, drawn from a long
concatenation of circumſtances, is at
once the buſineſs of this ſort of compoſition,
and one of the characteriſtics
of female genius
[1]
.
[p 13]

In
ſhort, it appears that the mind
in each ſex has ſome natural kind of
bias, which conſtitutes a diſtinction of
character, and that the happineſs of
both depends, in a great meaſure, on
the preſervation and obſervance of
this diſtinction. For where would be
the ſuperior pleaſure and ſatiſfaction
reſulting from mixed converſation, if
this difference were aboliſhed? If the
qualities of both were invariably and
exactly the ſame, no benefit or entertainment
would ariſe from the tedious
and inſipid uniformity of ſuch an intercourſe;
whereas conſiderable advantages
are reaped from a ſelect ſociety
of both ſexes. The rough angles
and aſperities of male manners
are imperceptibly filed, and gradually
worn ſmooth, by the poliſhing of female
converſation, and the refining of
female taſte; while the ideas of wo
[p 14]
men
acquire ſtrength and ſolidity, by
their aſſociating with ſenſible, intelligent,
and judicious men.

On
the whole, (even if fame be the
object of purſuit) is it not better to
ſucceed as women, than to fail as men?
To ſhine, by walking honourably in
the road which nature, cuſtom, and
education ſeem to have marked out,
rather than to counteract them all, by
moving awkwardly in a path diametrically
oppoſite? To be good originals,
rather than bad imitators? In a
word, to be excellent women, rather
than indifferent men?

[p 15]

[1]

The
author does not apprehend it makes againſt
her
general
poſition, that this nation can boaſt a
female critic, poet, hiſtorian, linguiſt, philoſopher,
and moraliſt, equal to moſt of the other ſex. To theſe
particular inſtances others might be adduced; but it
is preſumed, that they only ſtand as exceptions againſt
the rule, without tending to invalidate the rule itſelf.

ON

DISSIPATION.

DOGLIE CERTE, ALLEGREZZE INCERTE!

PETRARCA.

As
an argument in favour of modern
manners, it has been pleaded,
that the softer vices of Luxury
and Diſſipation, belong rather to gentle
and yielding tempers, than to
such as are rugged and ferocious: that
they are vices which increaſe civili
[p 16]
zation,
and tend to promote refinement,
and the cultivation of humanity.

But
this is an aſſertion, the truth
of which the experience of all ages
contradicts. Nero was not leſs a tyrant
for being a fiddler: He
[2]
who
wiſhed the whole Roman people had
but one neck, that he might diſpatch
them at a blow, was himſelf the moſt
debauched man in Rome; and Sydney
and Ruſſel were condemned to bleed
under the moſt barbarous, though moſt
diſſipated and voluptuous, reign that
ever diſgraced the annals of Britain.

The
love of diſſipation is, I believe,
allowed to be the reigning evil of the
preſent day. It is an evil which many
[p 17]

content themſelves with regretting,
without ſeeking to redreſs. A diſſipated
life is cenſured in the very act
of diſſipation, and prodigality of time
is as gravely declaimed againſt at the
card table, as in the pulpit.

The
lover of dancing cenſures the
amuſements of the theatre for their
dulneſs, and the gameſter blames them
both for their levity. She, whoſe whole
ſoul is ſwallowed up in "
opera extacies
"
is aſtoniſhed, that her acquaintance
can ſpend whole nights in preying,
like harpies, on the fortunes of
their fellow-creatures; while the grave
ſober ſinner, who paſſes her pale and
anxious vigils, in this faſhionable ſort
of pillaging, is no leſs ſurpriſed how
the other can waſte her precious time
in hearing ſounds for which ſhe has
[p 18]

no taſte, in a language ſhe does not
underſtand.

In
ſhort, every one ſeems convinced,
that the evil ſo much complained of
does really exiſt ſomewhere, though all
are inwardly perſuaded that it is not
with themſelves. All deſire a general
reformation, but few will liſten to propoſals
of particular amendment; the
body muſt be reſtored, but each limb
begs to remain as it is; and accuſations
which concern all, will be likely to affect
none. They think that ſin, like
matter, is diviſible, and that what is
ſcattered among so many, cannot materially
affect any one; and thus individuals
contribute ſeparately to that
evil which they in general lament.

The
prevailing manners of an age
depend more than we are aware, or
[p 19]

are willing to allow, on the conduct
of the women; this is one of the principal
hinges on which the great machine
of human ſociety turns. Thoſe
who allow the influence which female
graces have, in contributing to poliſh
the manners of men, would do well
to reflect how great an influence female
morals muſt alſo have on their
conduct. How much then is it to be
regretted, that the Britiſh ladies ſhould
ever ſit down contented to poliſh, when
they are able to reform, to entertain,
when they might inſtruct, and to dazzle
for an hour, when they are candidates
for eternity!

Under
the diſpenſation of Mahomet's
law, indeed, theſe mental excellencies
cannot be expected, becauſe
the women are ſhut out from all opportunities
of inſtruction, and excluded
[p 20]

from the endearing pleaſures of a delightful
and equal ſociety; and, as
a charming poet ſings, are taught to
believe, that

For their inferior natures

Form'd to delight, and happy by delighting,

Heav'n has reſerv'd no future paradiſe,

But bids them rove the paths of bliſs, ſecure

Of total death, and careleſs of hereafter.

Irene
.

These
act conſiſtently in ſtudying
none but exterior graces, in cultivating
only perſonal attractions, and in
trying to lighten the intolerable burden
of time, by the moſt frivolous
and vain amuſements. They act in
conſequence of their own blind belief,
and the tyranny of their deſpotic
maſters; for they have neither the freedom
of a preſent choice, nor the proſpect
of a future being.
[p 21]

But
in this land of civil and religious
liberty, where there is as little
deſpotiſm exerciſed over the minds,
as over the perſons of women, they
have every liberty of choice, and every
opportunity of improvement; and how
greatly does this increaſe their obligation
to be exemplary in their general
conduct, attentive to the government
of their families, and inſtrumental
to the good order of ſociety!

She
who is at a loſs to find amuſements
at home, can no longer apologize
for her diſſipation abroad, by
ſaying ſhe is deprived of the benefit
and the pleaſure of books; and ſhe
who regrets being doomed to a ſtate
of dark and gloomy ignorance, by the
injuſtice, or tyranny of the men, complains
of an evil which does not
exiſt.
[p 22]

It
is a queſtion frequently in the
mouths of illiterate and diſſipated females—"What
good is there in reading?
To what end does it conduce?"
It is, however, too obvious to need inſiſting
on, that unleſs perverted, as
the beſt things may be, reading anſwers
many excellent purpoſes beſide
the great leading one, and is perhaps
the ſafeſt remedy for diſſipation. She
who dedicates a portion of her leiſure
to uſeful reading, feels her mind in a
conſtant progreſſive ſtate of improvement,
whilſt the mind of a diſſipated
woman is continually loſing ground.
An active ſpirit rejoiceth, like the ſun,
to run his daily courſe, while indolence,
like the dial of Ahaz, goes
backwards. The advantages which
the underſtanding receives from polite
literature, it is not here neceſſary to
enumerate; its effects on the moral
[p 23]

temper is the preſent object of conſideration.
The remark may perhaps be
thought too ſtrong, but I believe it
is true, that next to religious influences,
an habit of ſtudy is the moſt
probable preſervative of the virtue of
young perſons. Thoſe who cultivate
letters have rarely a ſtrong paſſion for
promiſcuous viſiting, or diſſipated ſociety;
ſtudy therefore induces a reliſh
for domeſtic life, the moſt deſirable
temper in the world for women. Study,
as it reſcues the mind from an
inordinate fondneſs for gaming, dreſs,
and public amuſements, is an [oe]conomical
propenſity; for a lady may
read at much leſs expence than ſhe can
play at cards; as it requires ſome application,
it gives the mind an habit
of induſtry; as it is a relief againſt
that mental diſeaſe, which the French
emphatically call
ennui
, it cannot fail
[p 24]

of being beneficial to the temper and
ſpirits, I mean in the moderate degree
in which ladies are ſuppoſed to uſe it;
as an enemy to indolence, it becomes a
ſocial virtue; as it demands the full
exertion of our talents, it grows a rational
duty; and when directed to the
knowledge of the Supreme Being, and
his laws, it riſes into an act of religion.

The
rage for reformation commonly
ſhews itſelf in a violent zeal for ſuppreſſing
what is wrong, rather than in
a prudent attention to eſtabliſh what is
right; but we ſhall never obtain a fair
garden merely by rooting up weeds,
we muſt alſo plant flowers; for the
natural richneſs of the ſoil we have
been clearing will not ſuffer it to lie
barren, but whether it ſhall be vainly
or beneficially prolific, depends on the
[p 25]

culture. What the preſent age has
gained on one ſide, by a more enlarged
and liberal way of thinking, ſeems to
be loſt on the other, by exceſſive freedom
and unbounded indulgence. Knowledge
is not, as heretofore, confined
to the dull cloyſter, or the gloomy
college, but diſſeminated, to a certain
degree, among both ſexes and
almoſt all ranks. The only miſfortune
is, that theſe opportunities do
not ſeem to be ſo wiſely improved, or
turned to ſo good an account as might
be wiſhed. Books of a pernicious,
idle, and frivolous ſort, are too much
multiplied, and it is from the very
redundancy of them that true knowledge
is ſo ſcarce, and the habit of
diſſipation ſo much increaſed.

It
has been remarked, that the prevailing
character of the preſent age is
[p 26]

not that of groſs immorality: but if
this is meant of thoſe in the higher
walks of life, it is eaſy to diſcern,
that there can be but little merit in
abſtaining from crimes which there is
but little temptation to commit. It
is however to be feared, that a gradual
defection from piety, will in
time draw after it all the bad conſequences
of more active vice; for whether
mounds and fences are ſuddenly
deſtroyed by a ſweeping torrent, or
worn away through gradual neglect,
the effect is equally deſtructive. As
a rapid fever and a conſuming hectic
are alike fatal to our natural health, ſo
are flagrant immorality and torpid indolence
to our moral well-being.

The
philoſophical doctrine of the
ſlow receſſion of bodies from the ſun,
is a lively image of the reluctance with
[p 27]

which we firſt abandon the light of
virtue. The beginning of folly, and
the firſt entrance on a diſſipated life
coſt ſome pangs to a well-diſpoſed
heart; but it is ſurpriſing to ſee how
ſoon the progreſs ceaſes to be impeded
by reflection, or ſlackened by remorſe.
For it is in moral as in natural things,
the motion in minds as well as bodies
is accelerated by a nearer approach to
the centre to which they are tending.
If we recede ſlowly at firſt ſetting out,
we advance rapidly in our future
courſe; and to have begun to be
wrong, is already to have made a great
progreſs.

A constant
habit of amuſement
relaxes the tone of the mind, and renders
it totally incapable of application,
ſtudy, or virtue. Diſſipation not only
indiſpoſes its votaries to every thing
[p 28]

uſeful and excellent, but diſqualifies
them for the enjoyment of pleaſure itſelf.
It ſoftens the ſoul ſo much, that
the moſt ſuperficial employment becomes
a labour, and the ſlighteſt inconvenience
an agony. The luxurious
Sybarite muſt have loſt all ſenſe of
real enjoyment, and all reliſh for true
gratification, before he complained
that he could not ſleep, becauſe the
roſe leaves lay double under him.

Luxury
and diſſipation, ſoft and
gentle as their approaches are, and
ſilently as they throw their ſilken
chains about the heart, enſlave it more
than the moſt active and turbulent vices.
The mightieſt conquerors have been
conquered by theſe unarmed foes: the
flowery ſetters are faſtened, before they
are felt. The blandiſhments of Circe
were more fatal to the mariners of
[p 29]

Ulyſſes, than the ſtrength of Polypheme,
or the brutality of the Læſtrigons.
Hercules, after he had
cleanſed the Augean ſtable, and performed
all the other labours enjoined
him by Euriſtheus, found himſelf a
ſlave to the ſoftneſſes of the heart;
and he, who wore a club and a lion's
ſkin in the cauſe of virtue, condeſcended
to the moſt effeminate employments
to gratify a criminal weakneſs.
Hannibal, who vanquiſhed mighty
nations, was himſelf overcome by the
love of pleaſure; and he who deſpiſed
cold, and want, and danger, and death
on the Alps, was conquered and undone
by the diſſolute indulgences of
Capua.

Before
the hero of the moſt beautiful
and virtuous romance that ever
was written, I mean Telemachus,
[p 30]

landed on the iſland of Cyprus, he unfortunately
loſt his prudent companion,
Mentor, in whom wiſdom is ſo
finely perſonified. At firſt he beheld
with horror the wanton and diſſolute
manners of the voluptuous inhabitants;
the ill effects of their example were
not immediate: he did not fall into
the commiſſion of glaring enormities;
but his virtue was ſecretly and imperceptibly
undermined, his heart was
ſoftened by their pernicious ſociety;
and the nerve of reſolution was ſlackened:
he every day beheld with diminiſhed
indignation the worſhip which
was offered to Venus; the diſorders of
luxury and prophaneneſs became leſs
and leſs terrible, and the infectious
air of the country enfeebled his courage,
and relaxed his principles. In
ſhort, he had ceaſed to love virtue
long before he thought of committing
[p 31]

actual vice; and the duties of a manly
piety were burdenſome to him, before
he was ſo debaſed as to offer perfumes,
and burn incenſe on the altar of the
licentious goddeſs
[3]
.

"
Let
us crown ourſelves with roſebuds
before they be withered," ſaid
Solomon's libertine. Alas! he did not
reflect that they withered in the very
gathering. The roſes of pleaſure ſeldom
laſt long enough to adorn the brow
[p 32]

of him who plucks them; for they are
the only roſes which do not retain their
ſweetneſs after they have loſt their
beauty.

The
heathen poets often preſſed on
their readers the neceſſity of conſidering
the ſhortneſs of life, as an incentive
to pleaſure and voluptuouſneſs;
leſt the ſeaſon for indulging in them
ſhould paſs unimproved. The dark
and uncertain notions, not to ſay the
abſolute diſbelief, which they entertained
of a future ſtate, is the only
apology that can be offered for this
reaſoning. But while we cenſure their
tenets, let us not adopt their errors;
errors which would be infinitely more
inexcuſable in us, who, from the
clearer views which revelation has
given us, ſhall not have their ignorance
or their doubts to plead. It
[p 33]

were well if we availed ourſelves of
that portion of their precept, which
inculcates the improvement of every
moment of our time, but not like them
to dedicate the moments ſo redeemed
to the purſuit of ſenſual and periſhable
pleaſures, but to the ſecuring of thoſe
which are ſpiritual in their nature, and
eternal in their duration.

If
, indeed, like the miſerable
[4]
beings
imagined by Swift, with a view to
cure us of the irrational deſire after
immoderate length of days, we were
condemned to a wretched earthly immortality,
we ſhould have an excuſe
for ſpending ſome portion of our time
in diſſipation, as we might then pretend,
with ſome colour of reaſon, that
we propoſed, at a diſtant period, to
[p 34]

enter on a better courſe of action. Or
if we never formed any ſuch reſolution,
it would make no material difference
to beings, whoſe ſtate was already unalterably
fixed. But of the ſcanty
portion of days aſſigned to our lot, not
one ſhould be loſt in weak and irreſolute
procraſtination.

Those
who have not yet determined
on the ſide of vanity, who, like Hercules,
(before he knew the queen of
Lydia, and had learnt to ſpin) have
not reſolved on their choice between

virtue
and
pleasure
, may reflect,
that it is ſtill in their power to imitate
that hero in his noble choice, and in
his virtuous rejection. They may alſo
reflect with grateful triumph, that
Chriſtianity furniſhes them with a better
guide than the tutor of Alcides,
[p 35]

and with a ſurer light than the doctrines
of pagan philoſophy.

It
is far from my deſign ſeverely to
condemn the innocent pleaſures of life:
I would only beg leave to obſerve,
that thoſe which are criminal ſhould
never be allowed; and that even the
moſt innocent will, by immoderate
uſe, ſoon ceaſe to be ſo.

The
women of this country were
not ſent into the world to ſhun
ſociety, but to embelliſh it; they
were not deſigned for wilds and ſolitudes,
but for the amiable and endearing
offices of ſocial life. They have
uſeful ſtations to fill, and important
characters to ſuſtain. They are of a
religion which does not impoſe penances,
but enjoins duties; a religion
of perfect purity, but of perfect bene
[p 36]
volence
alſo. A religion which does
not condemn its followers to indolent
ſecluſion from the world, but aſſigns
them the more dangerous, though
more honourable province, of living
uncorrupted in it. In fine, a religion,
which does not direct them to fly from
the multitude, that they may do nothing,
but which poſitively forbids
them to follow a multitude to do evil.

Nothing
can be more admirable than the manner
in which this allegory is conducted; and the
whole work, not to mention its images, machinery,
and other poetical beauties, is written in the very
fineſt ſtrain of morality. In this latter reſpect it is
evidently ſuperior to the works of the ancients, the
moral of which is frequently tainted by the groſſneſs
of their mythology. Something of the purity of the
Chriſtian religion may be diſcovered even in Fenelon's
heathens, and they catch a tincture of piety
in paſſing through the hands of that amiable prelate.

THOUGHTS

ON

CONVERSATION.

It
has been adviſed, and by very
reſpectable authorities too, that in
converſation women ſhould carefully
conceal any knowledge or learning
they may happen to poſſeſs. I own,
with ſubmiſſion, that I do not ſee either
the neceſſity or propriety of this
[p 38]

advice. For if a young lady has that
diſcretion and modeſty, without which
all knowledge is little worth, ſhe will
never make an oſtentatious parade of
it, becauſe ſhe will rather be intent on
acquiring more, than on diſplaying
what ſhe has.

I am
at a loſs to know why a young
female is inſtructed to exhibit, in the
moſt advantageous point of view, her
ſkill in muſic, her ſinging, dancing,
taſte in dreſs, and her acquaintance
with the moſt faſhionable games and
amuſements, while her piety is to be
anxiouſly concealed, and her knowledge
affectedly diſavowed, leſt the former
ſhould draw on her the appellation of
an enthuſiaſt, or the latter that of a
pedant.
[p 39]

In
regard to knowledge, why ſhould
ſhe for ever affect to be on her guard,
leſt ſhe ſhould be found guilty of a
ſmall portion of it? She need be the
leſs ſolicitous about it, as it ſeldom
proves to be ſo very conſiderable as to
excite aſtoniſhment or admiration: for,
after all the acquiſitions which her
talents and her ſtudies have enabled
her to make, ſhe will, generally ſpeaking,
be found to have leſs of what is
called
learning
, than a common ſchool-boy.

It
would be to the laſt degree preſumptuous
and abſurd, for a young
woman to pretend to give the
ton
to the
company; to interrupt the pleaſure of
others, and her own opportunity of
improvement, by talking when ſhe
ought to liſten; or to introduce ſubjects
out of the common road, in or
[p 40]
der
to ſhew her own wit, or expoſe
the want of it in others: but were the
ſex to be totally ſilent when any topic
of literature happens to be diſcuſſed in
their preſence, converſation would loſe
much of its vivacity, and ſociety would
be robbed of one of its moſt intereſting
charms.

How
eaſily and effectually may a
well-bred woman promote the moſt
uſeful and elegant converſation, almoſt
without ſpeaking a word! for the modes
of ſpeech are ſcarcely more variable than
the modes of ſilence. The ſilence of
liſtleſs ignorance, and the ſilence of
ſparkling intelligence, are perhaps as
ſeparately marked, and as diſtinctly
expreſſed, as the ſame feelings could
have been by the moſt unequivocal
language. A woman, in a company
where ſhe has the leaſt influence, may
[p 41]

promote any ſubject by a profound
and invariable attention, which ſhews
that ſhe is pleaſed with it, and by an
illuminated countenance, which proves
ſhe underſtands it. Thiſ obliging attention
iſ the most flattering encouragement
in the world to men of ſenſe and
letters, to continue any topic of inſtruction
or entertainment they happen
to be engaged in: it owed its introduction
perhaps to accident, the beſt
introduction in the world for a ſubject
of ingenuity, which, though it could
not have been formally propoſed without
pedantry, may be continued with
eaſe and good humour; but which
will be frequently and effectually ſtopped
by the liſtleſſneſs, inattention, or
whiſpering of ſilly girls, whoſe wearineſs
betrays their ignorance, and whoſe
impatience expoſes their ill-breeding.
A polite man, however deeply inte
[p 42]
reſted
in the ſubject on which he is
converſing, catches at the ſlighteſt hint
to have done: a look is a ſufficient
intimation, and if a pretty ſimpleton,
who ſits near him, ſeems
diſtraite
, he
puts an end to his remarks, to the
great regret of the reaſonable part of
the company, who perhaps might have
gained more improvement by the continuance
of ſuch a converſation, than
a week's reading would have yielded
them; for it is ſuch company as this,
that give an edge to each other's wit,
"as iron ſharpeneth iron."

That
ſilence is one of the great arts
of converſation is allowed by Cicero
himſelf, who ſays, there is not only an
art but even an eloquence in it. And
this opinion is confirmed by a great modern
[5]
,
in the following little anecdote
from one of the ancients.
[p 43]

When
many Grecian philoſophers
had a ſolemn meeting before the ambaſſador
of a foreign prince, each endeavoured
to ſhew his parts by the
brilliancy of his converſation, that the
ambaſſador might have ſomething to
relate of the Grecian wiſdom. One of
them, offended, no doubt, at the loquacity
of his companions, obſerved a
profound ſilence; when the ambaſſador,
turning to him, aſked, "But what
have you to ſay, that I may report it?"
He made this laconic, but very pointed
reply: "Tell your king, that you have
found one among the Greeks who
knew how to be ſilent."

There
is a quality infinitely more
intoxicating to the female mind than
knowledge—this is Wit, the moſt captivating,
but the moſt dreaded of all
talents: the moſt dangerous to thoſe
[p 44]

who have it, and the moſt feared by
thoſe who have it not. Though it is
againſt all the rules, yet I cannot find
in my heart to abuſe this charming
quality. He who is grown rich without
it, in ſafe and ſober dulneſs, ſhuns
it as a diſeaſe, and looks upon poverty
as its invariable concomitant. The
moraliſt declaims againſt it as the
ſource of irregularity, and the frugal
citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy
itſelf, for he conſiders it as the parent
of extravagance and beggary. The
Cynic will aſk of what uſe it is? Of
very little perhaps: no more is a
flower garden, and yet it is allowed as
an object of innocent amuſement and
delightful recreation. A woman, who
poſſeſſes this quality, has received a
moſt dangerous preſent, perhaps not
leſs ſo than beauty itſelf: eſpecially if
it be not ſheathed in a temper peculi
[p 45]
arly
inoffenſive, chaſtiſed by a moſt
correct judgment, and reſtrained by
more prudence than falls to the common
lot.

This
talent is more likely to make
a woman vain than knowledge; for as
Wit is the immediate property of its
poſſeſſor, and learning is only an acquaintance
with the knowledge of other
people, there is much more danger,
that we ſhould be vain of what is our
own, than of what we borrow.

But
Wit, like learning, is not near
ſo common a thing as is imagined.
Let not therefore a young lady be
alarmed at the acuteneſs of her own
wit, any more than at the abundance
of her own knowledge. The great
danger is, leſt ſhe ſhould miſtake pertneſs,
flippancy, or imprudence, for this
[p 46]

brilliant quality, or imagine ſhe is
witty, only becauſe ſhe is indiſcreet.
This is very frequently the caſe, and
this makes the name of wit ſo cheap,
while its real exiſtence is ſo rare.

Lest
the flattery of her acquaintance,
or an over-weening opinion of
her own qualifications, ſhould lead
ſome vain and petulant girl into a falſe
notion that ſhe has a great deal of wit,
when ſhe has only a redundancy of
animal ſpirits, ſhe may not find it uſeleſs
to attend to the definition of this
quality, by one who had as large a
portion of it, as moſt individuals could
ever boaſt:

'Tis not a tale, 'tis not a jeſt,

Admir'd with laughter at a feaſt,

Nor florid talk, which can that title gain,

The proofs of wit for ever muſt remain.

Neither can that have any place,

At which a virgin hides her face;

Such droſs the fire muſt purge away; 'tis juſt,

The author bluſh there, where the reader muſt.

Cowley
.

[p 47]

But
thoſe who actually poſſeſs this
rare talent, cannot be too abſtinent in
the uſe of it. It often makes admirers,
but it never makes friends; I mean,
where it is the predominant feature;
and the unprotected and defenceleſs
ſtate of womanhood calls for friendſhip
more than for admiration. She
who does not deſire friends has a ſordid
and inſenſible ſoul; but ſhe who
is ambitious of making every man her
admirer, has an invincible vanity and
a cold heart.

But
to dwell only on the ſide of
policy, a prudent woman, who has
eſtabliſhed the reputation of ſome ge
[p 48]
nius
will ſufficiently maintain it, without
keeping her faculties always on
the ſtretch to ſay
good things
. Nay,
if reputation alone be her object, ſhe
will gain a more ſolid one by her forbearance,
as the wiſer part of her acquaintance
will aſcribe it to the right
motive, which is, not that ſhe has leſs
wit, but that ſhe has more judgment.

The
fatal fondneſs for indulging a
ſpirit of ridicule, and the injurious and
irreparable conſequences which ſometimes
attend the
too prompt reply
, can
never be too ſeriouſly or too ſeverely
condemned. Not to offend, is the firſt
ſtep towards pleaſing. To give pain
is as much an offence againſt humanity,
as againſt good breeding; and
ſurely it is as well to abſtain from an
action becauſe it is ſinful, as becauſe
it is impolite. In company, young
[p 49]

ladies would do well before they ſpeak,
to reflect, if what they are going to
ſay may not diſtreſs ſome worthy perſon
preſent, by wounding them in
their perſons, families, connexions, or
religious opinions. If they find it
will touch them in either of theſe, I
ſhould adviſe them to ſuſpect, that
what they were going to ſay is not
ſo
very
good a thing as they at firſt
imagined. Nay, if even it was one of
thoſe bright ideas, which
Venus has imbued
with a fifth part of her nectar
, ſo
much greater will be their merit in
ſuppreſſing it, if there was a probability
it might offend. Indeed, if they
have the temper and prudence to make
ſuch a previous reflection, they will be
more richly rewarded by their own inward
triumph, at having ſuppreſſed
a lively but ſevere remark, than they
could have been with the diſſembled
[p 50]

applauſes of the whole company, who,
with that complaiſant deceit, which
good breeding too much authoriſes,
affect openly to admire what they ſecretly
reſolve never to forgive.

I have
always been delighted with
the ſtory of the little girl's eloquence,
in one of the Children's Tales, who received
from a friendly fairy the gift,
that at every word ſhe uttered, pinks,
roſes, diamonds, and pearls, ſhould
drop from her mouth. The hidden
moral appears to be this, that it was
the ſweetneſs of her temper which produced
this pretty fanciful effect: for
when her malicious ſiſter deſired the
ſame gift from the good-natured tiny
Intelligence, the venom of her own
heart converted it into poiſonous and
loathſome reptiles.
[p 51]

A man
of ſenſe and breeding will
ſometimes join in the laugh, which has
been raiſed at his expence by an ill-natured
repartee; but if it was very
cutting, and one of thoſe ſhocking ſort
of truths, which as they can ſcarcely
be pardoned even in private, ought
never to be uttered in public, he does
not laugh becauſe he is pleaſed, but
becauſe he wiſhes to conceal how much
he is hurt. As the ſarcaſm was uttered
by a lady, ſo far from ſeeming to reſent
it, he will be the firſt to commend
it; but notwithſtanding that, he will
remember it as a trait of malice, when
the whole company ſhall have forgotten
it as a ſtroke of wit. Women are
ſo far from being privileged by their
ſex to ſay unhandſome or cruel things,
that it is this very circumſtance which
renders them more intolerable. When
the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is
[p 52]

no relief to him who is wounded to
reflect, that the hand which ſhot it
was a fair one.

Many
women, when they have a
favourite point to gain, or an earneſt
wiſh to bring any one over to their opinion,
often uſe a very diſingenuous
method: they will ſtate a caſe ambiguouſly,
and then avail themſelves of
it, in whatever manner ſhall beſt anſwer
their purpoſe; leaving your mind in
a ſtate of indeciſion as to their real
meaning, while they triumph in the
perplexity they have given you by the
unfair concluſions they draw, from premiſes
equivocally ſtated. They will
alſo frequently argue from exceptions
inſtead of rules, and are aſtoniſhed
when you are not willing to be contented
with a prejudice, inſtead of a
reaſon.
[p 53]

In
a ſenſible company of both ſexes,
where women are not reſtrained by
any other reſerve than what their natural
modeſty impoſes; and where the
intimacy of all parties authoriſes the
utmoſt freedom of communication;
ſhould any one inquire what were the
general ſentiments on ſome particular
ſubject, it will, I believe, commonly
happen, that the ladies, whoſe imaginations
have kept pace with the narration,
have anticipated its end, and are
ready to deliver their ſentiments on it
as ſoon as it is finiſhed. While ſome
of the male hearers, whoſe minds were
buſied in ſettling the propriety, comparing
the circumſtances, and examining
the conſiſtencies of what was ſaid,
are obliged to pauſe and diſcriminate,
before they think of anſwering. Nothing
is ſo embarraſſing as a variety of
matter, and the converſation of women
[p 54]

is often more perſpicuous, becauſe it
is leſs laboured.

A man
of deep reflection, if he does
not keep up an intimate commerce
with the world, will be ſometimes ſo
entangled in the intricacies of intenſe
thought, that he will have the appearance
of a confuſed and perplexed expreſſion;
while a ſprightly woman will
extricate herſelf with that lively and
"raſh dexterity," which will almoſt
always pleaſe, though it is very far
from being always right. It is eaſier
to confound than to convince an opponent;
the former may be effected by
a turn that has more happineſs than
truth in it. Many an excellent reaſoner,
well ſkilled in the theory of the
ſchools, has felt himſelf diſcomfited
by a reply, which, though as wide of
the mark, and as foreign to the que
[p 55]
ſtion
as can be conceived, has diſconcerted
him more than the moſt ſtartling
propoſition, or the moſt accurate
chain of reaſoning could have done;
and he has borne the laugh of his fair
antagoniſt, as well as of the whole
company, though he could not but
feel, that his own argument was attended
with the fulleſt demonſtration:
ſo true is it, that it is not always neceſſary
to be right, in order to be applauded.

But
let not a young lady's vanity
be too much elated with this falſe applauſe,
which is given, not to her
merit, but to her ſex: ſhe has not perhaps
gained a victory, though ſhe may
be allowed a triumph; and it ſhould
humble her to reflect, that the tribute
is paid, not to her ſtrength but her
weakneſs. It is worth while to diſcri
[p 56]
minate
between that applauſe, which
is given from the complaiſance of
others, and that which is paid to our
own merit.

Where
great ſprightlineſs is the natural
bent of the temper, girls ſhould
endeavour to habituate themſelves to
a cuſtom of obſerving, thinking, and
reaſoning. I do not mean, that they
ſhould devote themſelves to abſtruſe
ſpeculation, or the ſtudy of logic; but
ſhe who is accuſtomed to give a due
arrangement to her thoughts, to reaſon
juſtly and pertinently on common
affairs, and judiciouſly to deduce effects
from their cauſes, will be a better
logician than ſome of thoſe who claim
the name, becauſe they have ſtudied
the art: this is being "learned without
the rules;" the beſt definition,
perhaps, of that ſort of literature which
[p 57]

is propereſt for the ſex. That ſpecies
of knowledge, which appears to be the
reſult of reflection rather than of ſcience,
ſits peculiarly well on women.
It is not uncommon to find a lady,
who, though ſhe does not know a rule
of Syntax, ſcarcely ever violates one;
and who conſtructs every ſentence ſhe
utters, with more propriety than many
a learned dunce, who has every rule
of Ariſtotle by heart, and who can
lace his own thread-bare diſcourſe
with the golden ſhreds of Cicero and
Virgil.

It
has been objected, and I fear
with ſome reaſon, that female converſation
is too frequently tinctured
with a cenſorious ſpirit, and that ladies
are ſeldom apt to diſcover much tenderneſs
for the errors of a fallen ſiſter.
[p 58]

If it be ſo, it is a grievous fault.

No
arguments can juſtify, no pleas can
extenuate it. To inſult over the miſeries
of an unhappy creature is inhuman,
not to compaſſionate them is unchriſtian.
The worthy part of the
ſex always expreſs themſelves humanely
on the failings of others, in proportion
to their own undeviating goodneſs.

And
here I cannot help remarking,
that young women do not always carefully
diſtinguiſh between running into
the error of detraction, and its oppoſite
extreme of indiſcriminate applauſe.
This proceedſ from the falſe idea they
entertain, that the direct contrary to
what is wrong muſt be right. Thus
the dread of being only ſuſpected of
one fault makes them actually guilty
of another. The deſire of avoiding
[p 59]

the imputation of envy, impels them
to be inſincere; and to eſtabliſh a
reputation for ſweetneſs of temper and
generoſity, they affect ſometimes to
ſpeak of very indifferent characters
with the moſt extravagant applauſe.
With ſuch, the hyperbole is a favourite
figure; and every degree of compariſon
but the ſuperlative is rejected,
as cold and inexpreſſive. But this
habit of exaggeration greatly weakens
their credit, and deſtroys the weight
of their opinion on other occaſions;
for people very ſoon diſcover what degree
of faith is to be given both to
their judgment and veracity. And
thoſe of real merit will no more be
flattered by that approbation, which
cannot diſtinguiſh the value of what
it praiſes, than the celebrated painter
muſt have been at the judgment paſſed
[p 60]

on his works by an ignorant ſpectator,
who, being aſked what he thought of
ſuch and ſuch very capital but very
different pieces, cried out in an affected
rapture, "All alike! all alike!"

It
has been propoſed to the young,
as a maxim of ſupreme wiſdom, to
manage ſo dexterouſly in converſation,
as to appear to be well acquainted
with ſubjects, of which they are totally
ignorant; and this, by affecting
ſilence in regard to thoſe, on which
they are known to excel.—But why
counſel this diſingenuous fraud? Why
add to the numberleſs arts of deceit,
this practice of deceiving, as it were,
on a ſettled principle? If to diſavow
the knowledge they really have be a
culpable affectation, then certainly to
inſinuate an idea of their ſkill, where
[p 61]

they are actually ignorant, is a moſt
unworthy artifice.

But
of all the qualifications for
converſation, humility, if not the
moſt brilliant, is the ſafeſt, the moſt
amiable, and the moſt feminine. The
affectation of introducing ſubjects,
with which others are unacquainted,
and of diſplaying talents ſuperior to
the reſt of the company, is as dangerous
as it is fooliſh.

There are many, who never can
forgive another for being more agreeable
and more accompliſhed than
themſelves, and who can pardon any
offence rather than an eclipſing merit.
Had the nightingale in the fable
conquered his vanity, and reſiſted
the temptation of ſhewing a fine voice,
[p 62]

he might have eſcaped the talons of
the hawk. The melody of his ſinging
was the cauſe of his deſtruction; his
merit brought him into danger, and
his vanity coſt him his life.

ON

ENVY.

Envy came next, Envy with ſquinting eyes,

Sick of a ſtrange diſeaſe, his neighbour's health;

Beſt then he lives when any better dies,

Is never poor but in another's wealth:

On beſt mens harms and griefs he feeds his fill,

Elſe his own maw doth eat with ſpiteful will,

Ill muſt the temper be, where diet is ſo ill.

Fletcher's Purple Island
.

"
Envy
, (ſays Lord Bacon) has
no holidays." There cannot
perhaps be a more lively and ſtriking
deſcription of the miſerable ſtate of
mind thoſe endure, who are tormented
[p 64]

with this vice. A ſpirit of emulation
has been ſuppoſed to be the ſource of
the greateſt improvements; and there
is no doubt but the warmeſt rivalſhip
will produce the moſt excellent effects;
but it is to be feared, that a perpetual
ſtate of conteſt will injure the temper
ſo eſſentially, that the miſchief will
hardly be counterbalanced by any
other advantages. Thoſe, whoſe progreſs
is the moſt rapid, will be apt to
deſpiſe their leſs ſucceſſful competitors,
who, in return, will feel the bittereſt
reſentment againſt their more
fortunate rivals. Among perſons of
real goodneſs, this jealouſy and contempt
can never be equally felt, becauſe
every advancement in piety will
be attended with a proportionable increaſe
of humility, which will lead them
to contemplate their own improve
[p 65]
ments
with modeſty, and to view
with charity the miſcarriages of others.

When
an envious man is melancholy,
one may aſk him, in the words
of Bion, what evil has befallen himſelf,
or what good has happened to
another? This laſt is the ſcale by
which he principally meaſures his felicity,
and the very ſmiles of his friends
are ſo many deductions from his own
happineſs. The wants of others are
the ſtandard by which he rates his own
wealth, and he eſtimates his riches,
not ſo much by his own poſſeſſions,
as by the neceſſities of his neighbours.

When
the malevolent intend to
ſtrike a very deep and dangerous
ſtroke of malice, they generally begin
the moſt remotely in the world from
[p 66]

the ſubject neareſt their hearts. They
ſet out with commending the object
of their envy for ſome trifling quality
or advantage, which it is ſcarcely worth
while to poſſeſs: they next proceed to
make a general profeſſion of their own
good-will and regard for him: thus
artfully removing any ſuſpicion of
their deſign, and clearing all obſtructions
for the inſidious ſtab they are
about to give; for who will ſuſpect
them of an intention to injure the object
of their peculiar and profeſſed
eſteem? The hearer's belief of the
fact grows in proportion to the ſeeming
reluctance with which it is told,
and to the conviction he has, that the
relater is not influenced by any private
pique, or perſonal reſentment; but
that the confeſſion is extorted from him
ſorely againſt his inclination, and
purely on account of his zeal for truth.
[p 67]

Anger
is leſs reaſonable and more
ſincere than envy.—Anger breaks out
abruptly; envy is a great prefacer—anger
wiſhes to be underſtood at once:
envy is fond of remote hints and ambiguities;
but, obſcure as its oracles
are, it never ceaſes to deliver them till
they are perfectly comprehended:—anger
repeats the ſame circumſtances
over again; envy invents new ones at
every freſh recital—anger gives a
broken, vehement, and interrupted
narrative; envy tells a more conſiſtent
and more probable, though a falſer
tale—anger is exceſſively imprudent,
for it is impatient to diſcloſe every
thing it knows; envy is diſcreet, for
it has a great deal to hide—anger never
conſults times or ſeaſons; envy
waits for the lucky moment, when the
wound it meditates may be made the
moſt exquiſitely painful, and the
[p 68]

moſt incurably deep—anger uſes more
invective; envy does more miſchief—ſimple
anger ſoon runs itſelf out of
breath, and is exhauſted at the end of
its tale; but it is for that choſen period
that envy has treaſured up the moſt
barbed arrow in its whole quiver—anger
puts a man out of himſelf: but
the truly malicious generally preſerve
the appearance of ſelf-poſſeſſion, or
they could not ſo effectually injure.—The
angry man ſets out by deſtroying
his whole credit with you at once,
for he very frankly confeſſes his abhorrence
and deteſtation of the object of
his abuſe; while the envious man carefully
ſuppreſſes all his own ſhare in
the affair.—The angry man defeats the
end of his reſentment, by keeping
himſelf

continually before your eyes, inſtead
of his enemy; while the envious
man artfully brings forward the object
[p 69]

of his malice, and keeps himſelf out
of ſight.—The angry man talks loudly
of his own wrongs; the envious of his
adverſary's injuſtice.—A paſſionate perſon,
if his reſentments are not complicated
with malice, divides his time
between ſinning and ſorrowing; and,
as the iraſcible paſſions cannot conſtantly
be at work, his heart may ſometimes
get a holiday.—Anger is a violent
act, envy a conſtant habit—no one can
be always angry, but he may be always
envious:—an angry man's enmity
(if he be generous) will ſubſide when
the object of his reſentment becomes
unfortunate; but the envious man can
extract food from his malice out of calamity
itſelf, if he finds his adverſary
bears it with dignity, or is pitied or
aſſiſted in it. The rage of the paſſionate
man is totally extinguiſhed by
the death of his enemy; but the ha
[p 70]
tred
of the malicious is not buried even
in the grave of his rival: he will envy
the good name he has left behind him;
he will envy him the tears of his widow,
the proſperity of his children,
the eſteem of his friends, the praiſes of
his epitaph—nay the very magnificence
of his funeral.

"
The
ear of jealouſy heareth all
things," (ſays the wiſe man) frequently
I believe more than is uttered, which
makes the company of perſons infected
with it ſtill more dangerous.

When
you tell thoſe of a malicious
turn, any circumſtance that has happened
to another, though they perfectly
know of whom you are ſpeaking,
they often affect to be at a loſs,
to forget his name, or to miſapprehend
you in ſome reſpect or other; and this
[p 71]

merely to have an opportunity of ſlily
gratifying their malice by mentioning
ſome unhappy defect or perſonal infirmity
he labours under; and not contented
"to tack his every error to his
name," they will, by way of farther
explanation, have recourſe to the faults
of his father, or the miſfortunes of
his family; and this with all the ſeeming
ſimplicity and candor in the world,
merely for the ſake of preventing miſtakes,
and to clear up every doubt of
his identity.—If you are ſpeaking of a
lady, for inſtance, they will perhaps
embelliſh their inquiries, by aſking if
you mean her, whoſe great grandfather
was a bankrupt, though ſhe has the
vanity to keep a chariot, while others
who are much better born walk on
foot; or they will afterwards recollect,
that you may poſſibly mean her couſin,
of the ſame name, whoſe mother was
[p 72]

ſuſpected of ſuch or ſuch an indiſcretion,
though the daughter had the luck
to make her fortune by marrying,
while her betters are overlooked.

To

hint at a fault
, does more miſchief
than ſpeaking out; for whatever
is left for the imagination to finiſh,
will not fail to be overdone: every
hiatus will be more then filled up, and
every pauſe more than ſupplied. There
is leſs malice, and leſs miſchief too,
in telling a man's name than the initials
of it; as a worthier perſon may
be involved in the moſt diſgraceful
ſuſpicions by ſuch a dangerous ambiguity.

It
is not uncommon for the envious,
after having attempted to deface
the faireſt character ſo induſtriouſly,
that they are afraid you will begin to
[p 73]

detect their malice, to endeavour to
remove your ſuſpicions effectually, by
aſſuring you, that what they have juſt
related is only the popular opinion;
they themſelves can never believe
things are ſo bad as they are ſaid to
be; for their part, it is a rule with
them always to hope the beſt. It is
their way never to believe or report ill
of any one. They will, however,
mention the ſtory in all companies,
that they may do their friend the ſervice
of proteſting their diſbelief of it.
More reputations are thus hinted away
by falſe friends, than are openly deſtroyed
by public enemies. An
if
, or
a
but
, or a mortified look, or a languid
defence, or an ambiguous ſhake
of the head, or a haſty word affectedly
recalled, will demoliſh a character more
effectually, than the whole artillery of
malice when openly levelled againſt it.
[p 74]

It
is not that envy never praiſes—No,
that would be making a public
profeſſion of itſelf, and advertiſing
its own malignity; whereas the greateſt
ſucceſs of its efforts depends on the
concealment of their end. When envy
intends to ſtrike a ſtroke of Machiavelian
policy, it ſometimes affects the
language of the moſt exaggerated applauſe;
though it generally takes care,
that the ſubject of its panegyric ſhall
be a very indifferent and common character,
ſo that it is well aware none of
its praiſes will ſtick.

It
is the unhappy nature of envy
not to be contented with poſitive miſery,
but to be continually aggravating
its own torments, by comparing
them with the felicities of others.
The eyes of envy are perpetually fixed
on the object which diſturbs it, nor
[p 75]

can it avert them from it, though to
procure itſelf the relief of a temporary
forgetfulneſs. On ſeeing the innocence
of the firſt pair,

Aſide the devil turn'd,

For Envy, yet with jealous leer malign,

Eyed them aſkance.

As this enormous ſin chiefly inſtigated
the revolt, and brought on the
ruin of the angelic ſpirits, ſo it is not
improbable, that it will be a principal
inſtrument of miſery in a future world,
for the envious to compare their deſperate
condition with the happineſs of
the children of God; and to heighten
their actual wretchedneſs by reflecting
on what they have loſt.

Perhaps
envy, like lying and ingratitude,
is practiſed with more frequency,
becauſe it is practiſed with
[p 76]

impunity; but there being no human
laws againſt theſe crimes, is ſo far from
an inducement to commit them, that
this very conſideration would be ſufficient
to deter the wiſe and good, if
all others were ineffectual; for of
how heinous a nature muſt thoſe ſins
be, which are judged above the reach
of human puniſhment, and are reſerved
for the final juſtice of God himſelf!
[p 77]

ON THE

DANGER

OF

SENTIMENTAL OR ROMANTIC

CONNEXIONS.

Among
the many evils which
prevail under the ſun, the abuſe
of words is not the leaſt conſiderable.
By the influence of time, and the perverſion
of faſhion, the plaineſt and
moſt unequivocal may be ſo altered,
[p 78]

as to have a meaning aſſigned them almoſt
diametrically oppoſite to their
original ſignification.

The
preſent age may be termed, by
way of diſtinction, the age of ſentiment,
a word which, in the implication
it now bears, was unknown to
our plain anceſtors. Sentiment is the
varniſh of virtue to conceal the deformity
of vice; and it is not uncommon
for the ſame perſons to make a jeſt of
religion, to break through the moſt
ſolemn ties and engagements, to practiſe
every art of latent fraud and open
ſeduction, and yet to value themſelves
on ſpeaking and writing
ſentimentally
.

But
this refined jargon, which has
infeſted letters and tainted morals, is
chiefly admired and adopted by
young
ladies
of a certain turn, who read
ſen
[p 79]
timental
books
, write
ſentimental letters
,
and contract
ſentimental friendſhips
.

Error
is never likely to do ſo
much miſchief as when it diſguiſes its
real tendency, and puts on an engaging
and attractive appearance. Many
a young woman, who would be ſhocked
at the imputation of an intrigue,
is extremely flattered at the idea of a
ſentimental connexion, though perhaps
with a dangerous and deſigning man,
who, by putting on this maſk of plauſibility
and virtue, diſarms her of her
prudence, lays her apprehenſions aſleep,
and involves her in miſery; miſery
the more inevitable becauſe unſuſpected.
For ſhe who apprehends no danger,
will not think it neceſſary to be
always upon her guard; but will rather
invite than avoid the ruin which
[p 80]

comes under ſo ſpecious and ſo fair a
form.

Such
an engagement will be infinitely
dearer to her vanity than an
avowed and authoriſed attachment;
for one of theſe ſentimental lovers will
not ſcruple very ſeriouſly to aſſure a credulous
girl, that her unparalleled merit
entitles her to the adoration of the
whole world, and that the univerſal
homage of mankind is nothing more
than the unavoidable tribute extorted
by her charms. No wonder then ſhe
ſhould be eaſily prevailed on to believe,
that an individual is captivated
by perfections which might enſlave a
million. But ſhe ſhould remember,
that he who endeavours to intoxicate
her with adulation, intends one day
moſt effectually to humble her. For
an artful man has always a ſecret de
[p 81]
ſign
to pay himſelf in future for every
preſent ſacrifice. And this prodigality
of praiſe, which he now appears to
laviſh with ſuch thoughtleſs profuſion,
is, in fact, a ſum [oe]conomically laid
out to ſupply his future neceſſities:
of this ſum he keeps an exact eſtimate,
and at ſome diſtant day promiſes himſelf
the moſt exorbitant intereſt for it.
If he has addreſs and conduct, and,
the object of his purſuit much vanity,
and ſome ſenſibility, he ſeldom fails
of ſucceſs; for ſo powerful will be his
aſcendancy over her mind, that ſhe
will ſoon adopt his notions and opinions.
Indeed, it is more than probable
ſhe poſſeſſed moſt of them before, having
gradually acquired them in her
initiation into the ſentimental character.
To maintain that character with
dignity and propriety, it is neceſſary
ſhe ſhould entertain the moſt elevated
[p 82]

ideas of diſproportionate alliances, and
diſintereſted love; and conſider fortune,
rank, and reputation, as mere
chimerical diſtinctions and vulgar prejudices.

The
lover, deeply verſed in all the
obliquities of fraud, and ſkilled to wind
himſelf into every avenue of the heart
which indiſcretion has left unguarded,
ſoon diſcovers on which ſide it is moſt
acceſſible. He avails himſelf of this
weakneſs by addreſſing her in a language
exactly conſonant to her own
ideas. He attacks her with her own
weapons, and oppoſes rhapſody to
ſentiment—He profeſſes ſo ſovereign
a contempt for the paltry concerns of
money, that ſhe thinks it her duty to
reward him for ſo generous a renunciation.
Every plea he artfully advances
of his own unworthineſs, is
[p 83]

conſidered by her as a freſh demand
which her gratitude muſt anſwer. And
ſhe makes it a point of honour to ſacrifice
to him that fortune which he
is too noble to regard. Theſe profeſſions
of humility are the common artifice
of the vain, and theſe proteſtations
of generoſity the refuge of the
rapacious. And among its many
ſmooth miſchiefs, it is one of the ſure
and ſucceſſful frauds of ſentiment, to
affect the moſt frigid indifference to
thoſe external and pecuniary advantages,
which it is its great and real
object to obtain.

A sentimental
girl very rarely
entertains any doubt of her perſonal
beauty; for ſhe has been daily accuſtomed
to contemplate it herſelf, and
to hear of it from others. She will
not, therefore, be very ſolicitous for
[p 84]

the confirmation of a truth ſo ſelf-evident;
but ſhe ſuſpects, that her
pretenſions to underſtanding are more
likely to be diſputed, and, for that
reaſon, greedily devours every compliment
offered to thoſe perfections,
which are leſs obvious and more refined.
She is perſuaded, that men
need only open their eyes to decide
on her beauty, while it will be the
moſt convincing proof of the taſte,
ſenſe, and elegance of her admirer,
that he can diſcern and flatter thoſe
qualities in her. A man of the character
here ſuppoſed, will eaſily inſinuate
himſelf into her affections, by
means of this latent but leading foible,
which may be called the guiding clue
to a ſentimental heart. He will affect
to overlook that beauty which attracts
common eyes, and enſnares common
hearts, while he will beſtow the moſt
[p 85]

delicate praiſes on the beauties of her
mind, and finiſh the climax of adulation,
by hinting that ſhe is ſuperior
to it.

And when he tells her ſhe hates flattery,

She ſays ſhe does, being then moſt flatter'd.

But
nothing, in general, can end leſs
delightfully than theſe ſublime attachments,
even where no acts of ſeduction
were ever practiſed, but they are
ſuffered, like mere ſublunary connexions,
to terminate in the vulgar cataſtrophe
of marriage. That wealth,
which lately ſeemed to be looked on
with ineffable contempt by the lover,
now appears to be the principal attraction
in the eyes of the huſband;
and he, who but a few ſhort weeks
before, in a tranſport of ſentimental
generoſity, wiſhed her to have been
a village maid, with no portion but
[p 86]

her crook and her beauty, and that
they might ſpend their days in paſtoral
love and innocence, has now loſt all
reliſh for the Arcadian life, or any
other life in which ſhe muſt be his
companion.

On
the other hand, ſhe who was
lately

An angel call'd, and angel-like ador'd,

is ſhocked to find herſelf at once ſtripped
of all her celeſtial attributes. This
late divinity, who ſcarcely yielded to
her ſiſters of the ſky, now finds herſelf
of leſs importance in the eſteem
of the man ſhe has choſen, than any
other mere mortal woman. No longer
is ſhe gratified with the tear of counterfeited
paſſion, the ſigh of diſſembled
rapture, or the language of premeditated
adoration. No longer is the
[p 87]

altar of her vanity loaded with the oblations
of fictitious fondneſs, the incenſe
of falſehood, or the ſacrifice of
flattery.—Her apotheoſis is ended!—She
feels herſelf degraded from the
dignities and privileges of a goddeſs,
to all the imperfections, vanities, and
weakneſſes of a ſlighted woman, and
a neglected wife. Her faults, which
were ſo lately overlooked, or miſtaken
for virtues, are now, as Caſſius ſays,
ſet in a note-book. The paſſion,
which was vowed eternal, laſted only
a few ſhort weeks; and the indifference,
which was ſo far from being
included in the bargain, that it was
not ſo much as ſuſpected, follows them
through the whole tireſome journey of
their inſipid, vacant, joyleſs exiſtence.

Thus
much for the
completion
of the
ſentimental hiſtory. If we trace it
[p 88]

back to its beginning, we ſhall find
that a damſel of this caſt had her head
originally turned by pernicious reading,
and her inſanity confirmed by
imprudent friendſhips. She never fails
to ſelect a beloved
confidante
of her
own turn and humour, though, if ſhe
can help it, not quite ſo handſome as
herſelf. A violent intimacy enſues, or,
to ſpeak the language of ſentiment,
an intimate union of ſouls immediately
takes place, which is wrought to the
higheſt pitch by a ſecret and voluminous
correſpondence, though they live
in the ſame ſtreet, or perhaps in the
ſame houſe. This is the fuel which
principally feeds and ſupplies the dangerous
flame of ſentiment. In this
correſpondence the two friends encourage
each other in the falſeſt notions
imaginable. They repreſent romantic
love as the great important buſine
[p 89]
ſs
of human life, and deſcribe all the
other concerns of it as too low and
paltry to merit the attention of ſuch
elevated beings, and fit only to employ
the daughters of the plodding
vulgar. In theſe letters, family affairs
are miſrepreſented, family ſecrets divulged,
and family miſfortunes aggravated.
They are filled with vows
of eternal amity, and proteſtations of
never-ending love. But interjections
and quotations are the principal embelliſhments
of theſe very ſublime
epiſtles. Every panegyric contained
in them is extravagant and hyperbolical,
and every cenſure exaggerated
and exceſſive. In a favourite, every
frailty is heightened into a perfection,
and in a foe degraded into a crime.
The dramatic poets, eſpecially the
moſt tender and romantic, are quoted
in almoſt every line, and every pom
[p 90]
pous
or pathetic thought is forced to
give up its natural and obvious meaning,
and with all the violence of miſapplication,
is compelled to ſuit ſome
circumſtance of imaginary woe of the
fair tranſcriber. Alicia is not too mad
for her heroics, nor Monimia too mild
for her ſoft emotions.

Fathers

have flinty hearts
is an expreſſion
worth an empire, and is always
uſed with peculiar emphaſis and
enthuſiaſm. For a favourite topic of
theſe epiſtles is the groveling ſpirit
and ſordid temper of the parents, who
will be ſure to find no quarter at the
hands of their daughters, ſhould they
preſume to be ſo unreaſonable as to
direct their courſe of reading, interfere
in their choice of friends, or interrupt
their very important correſpondence.
But as theſe young ladies are fertile in
[p 91]

expedients, and as their genius is never
more agreeably exerciſed than in
finding reſources, they are not without
their ſecret exultation, in caſe either
of the above intereſting events
ſhould happen, as they carry with
them a certain air of tyranny and perſecution
which is very delightful. For
a prohibited correſpondence is one of
the great incidents of a ſentimental life,
and a letter clandeſtinely received, the
ſupreme felicity of a ſentimental lady.

Nothing
can equal the aſtoniſhment
of theſe ſoaring ſpirits, when their
plain friends or prudent relations preſume
to remonſtrate with them on any
impropriety in their conduct. But if
theſe worthy people happen to be
ſomewhat advanced in life, their contempt
is then a little ſoftened by pity,
at the reflection that ſuch very anti
[p 92]
quated
poor creatures ſhould pretend
to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies
of their great refinement, ſenſe, and
reading. They conſider them as wretches
utterly ignorant of the ſublime pleaſures
of a delicate and exalted paſſion;
as tyrants whoſe authority is to be contemned,
and as ſpies whoſe vigilance is
to be eluded. The prudence of theſe
worthy friends they term ſuſpicion,
and their experience dotage. For they
are perſuaded, that the face of things
has ſo totally changed ſince their parents
were young, that though they
might then judge tolerably for themſelves,
yet they are now (with all
their advantages of knowledge and
obſervation) by no means qualified to
direct their more enlightened daughters;
who, if they have made a great
progreſs in the ſentimental walk, will
[p 93]

no more be influenced by the advice
of their mother, than they would go
abroad in her laced pinner or her brocade
ſuit.

But
young people never ſhew their
folly and ignorance more conſpicuouſly,
than by this over-confidence in
their own judgment, and this haughty
diſdain of the opinion of thoſe who
have known more days. Youth has
a quickneſs of apprehenſion, which it
is very apt to miſtake for an acuteneſs
of penetration. But youth, like cunning,
though very conceited, is very
ſhort-ſighted, and never more ſo than
when it diſregards the inſtructions of
the wife, and the admonitions of the
aged. The ſame vices and follies influenced
the human heart in their
day, which influence it now, and
[p 94]

nearly in the ſame manner. One who
well knew the world and its various
vanities, has ſaid, "The thing which
hath been, it is that which ſhall be,
and that which is done is that which
ſhall be done, and there is no new
thing under the ſun."

It
is alſo a part of the ſentimental
character, to imagine that none but
the young and the beautiful have any
right to the pleaſures of ſociety, of
even to the common benefits and bleſſings
of life. Ladies of this turn alſo
affect the moſt lofty diſregard for uſeful
qualities and domeſtic virtues;
and this is a natural conſequence: for
as this ſort of ſentiment is only a weed
of idleneſs, ſhe who is conſtantly and
uſefully employed, has neither leiſure
nor propenſity to cultivate it.
[p 95]

A sentimental
lady principally
values herſelf on the enlargement of
her notions, and her liberal way of
thinking. This ſuperiority of ſoul
chiefly manifeſts itſelf in the contempt
of thoſe minute delicacies and little decorums,
which, trifling as they may
be thought, tend at once to dignify
the character, and to reſtrain the
levity of the younger part of the ſex.

Perhaps
the error here complained
of, originates in miſtaking
ſentiment

and
principle
for each other. Now I
conceive them to be extremely different.
Sentiment is the virtue of
ideas
,
and principle the virtue of
action
. Sentiment
has its ſeat in the head, principle
in the heart. Sentiment ſuggeſts
fine harangues and ſubtile diſtinctions;
principle conceives juſt notions, and
performs good actions in conſequence
[p 96]

of them. Sentiment refines away the
ſimplicity of truth and the plainneſs
of piety; and, as a celebrated wit
[6]
has
remarked of his no leſs celebrated
contemporary, gives us virtue in words
and vice in deeds. Sentiment may be
called the Athenian, who
knew
what
was right, and principle the Lacedemonian
who
practiſed
it.

But
theſe qualities will be better
exemplified by an attentive conſideration
of two admirably drawn characters
of Milton, which are beautifully,
delicately, and diſtinctly marked.
Theſe are, Belial, who may not
improperly be called the
Demon of Sentiment
;
and Abdiel, who may be
termed the
Angel of Principle
.
[p 97]

Survey
the picture of Belial, drawn
by the ſublimeſt hand that ever held
the poetic pencil.

A fairer perſon loſt not heav'n; he ſeem'd

For dignity compos'd, and high exploit,

But all was falſe and hollow, tho' his tongue

Dropt manna, and could make the worſe appear

The better reaſon, to perplex and daſh

Matureſt counſels, for his thoughts were low,

To vice induſtrious, but to nobler deeds

Tim'rous and ſlothful; yet he pleas'd the ear.

Paradise Lost
, B. II.

Here
is a lively and exquiſite repreſentation
of art, ſubtilty, wit, fine
breeding and poliſhed manners: on
the whole, of a very accompliſhed and
ſentimental ſpirit.

Now
turn to the artleſs, upright,
and unſophiſticated Abdiel,
[p 98]

Faithful found

Among the faithleſs, faithful only he

Among innumerable falſe, unmov'd,

Unſhaken, unſeduc'd, unterrified;

His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal.

Nor number, nor example with him wrought

To ſwerve from truth, or change his conſtant mind,

Though ſingle.

Book
V.

But
it is not from theſe deſcriptions,
juſt and ſtriking as they are, that their
characters are ſo perfectly known, as
from an examination of their conduct
through the remainder of this divine
work: in which it is well worth while
to remark the conſonancy of their actions,
with what the above pictures
ſeem to promiſe. It will alſo be obſerved,
that the contraſt between them
is kept up throughout, with the utmoſt
exactneſs of delineation, and the
moſt animated ſtrength of colouring.
[p 99]

On a review it will be found, that
Belial
talked
all, and Abdiel
did
all.
The former,

With words ſtill cloath'd in reaſon's guiſe,

Counſel'd ignoble eaſe, and peaceful ſloth,

Not peace.

Book
II.

In
Abdiel you will conſtantly find
the eloquence of action. When tempted
by the rebellious angels, with what

retorted ſcorn
, with what honeſt indignation
he deſerts their multitudes, and
retreats from their contagious ſociety!

All night the dreadleſs angel unpurſued

Through heaven's wide champain held his way.

Book
VI.

No
wonder he was received with
ſuch acclamations of joy by the celeſtial
powers, when there was

But one,

Yes, of ſo many myriads fall'n, but one

Return'd not loſt.

Ibid.

[p 100]

And
afterwards, in a cloſe conteſt
with the arch fiend,

A noble ſtroke he lifted high

On the proud creſt of Satan.

Ibid.

What
was the effect of this courage
of the vigilant and active ſeraph?

Amazement ſeiz'd

The rebel throne, but greater rage to ſee

Thus foil'd their mightieſt.

Abdiel
had the ſuperiority of Belial
as much in the warlike combat, as
in the peaceful counſels.

Nor was it ought but juſt,

That he who in debate of truth had won,

Shou'd win in arms, in both diſputes alike

Victor.

But
notwithſtanding I have ſpoken
with ſome aſperity againſt ſentiment as
oppoſed to principle, yet I am con
[p 101]
vinced,
that true genuine ſentiment,
(not the ſort I have been deſcribing)
may be ſo connected with principle,
as to beſtow on it its brighteſt luſtre,
and its moſt captivating graces. And
enthuſiaſm is ſo far from being diſagreeable,
that a portion of it is perhaps
indiſpenſably neceſſary in an engaging
woman. But it muſt be the
enthuſiaſm of the heart, not of the ſenſes.
It muſt be the enthuſiaſm which grows
up with a feeling mind, and is cheriſhed
by a virtuous education; not that which
is compounded of irregular paſſions, and
artificially refined by books of unnatural
fiction and improbable adventure.
I will even go ſo far as to aſſert,
that a young woman cannot have any
real greatneſs of ſoul, or true elevation
of principle, if ſhe has not a tincture
of what the vulgar would call Romance,
but which perſons of a certain
[p 102]

way of thinking will diſcern to proceed
from thoſe fine feelings, and that
charming ſenſibility, without which,
though a woman may be worthy, yet
ſhe can never be amiable.

But
this dangerous merit cannot be
too rigidly watched, as it is very apt
to lead thoſe who poſſeſs it into inconveniencies
from which leſs intereſting
characters are happily exempt. Young
women of ſtrong ſenſibility may be
carried by the very amiableneſs of this
temper into the moſt alarming extremes.
Their taſtes are paſſions. They
love and hate with all their hearts, and
ſcarcely ſuffer themſelves to feel a reaſonable
preference before it ſtrengthens
into a violent attachment.

When
an innocent girl of this open,
truſting, tender heart, happens to meet
[p 103]

with one of her own ſex and age,
whoſe addreſs and manners are engaging,
ſhe is inſtantly ſeized with an ardent
deſire to commence a friendſhip
with her. She feels the moſt lively
impatience at the reſtraints of company,
and the decorums of ceremony.
She longs to be alone with her, longs
to aſſure her of the warmth of her tenderneſs,
and generouſly aſcribes to
the fair ſtranger all the good qualities
ſhe feels in her own heart, or rather
all thoſe which ſhe has met with in her
reading, diſperſed in a variety of heroines.
She is perſuaded, that her new
friend unites them all in herſelf, becauſe
ſhe carries in her prepoſſeſſing
countenance the promiſe of them all.
How cruel and how cenſorious would
this inexperienced girl think her mother
was, who ſhould venture to hint,
that the agreeable unknown had de
[p 104]
fects
in her temper, or exceptions in
her character. She would miſtake theſe
hints of diſcretion for the inſinuations
of an uncharitable diſpoſition. At firſt
ſhe would perhaps liſten to them with
a generous impatience, and afterwards
with a cold and ſilent diſdain. She
would deſpiſe them as the effect of
prejudice, miſrepreſentation, or ignorance.
The more aggravated the cenſure,
the more vehemently would ſhe
proteſt in ſecret, that her friendſhip
for this dear injured creature (who is
raiſed much higher in her eſteem by
ſuch injurious ſuſpicions) ſhall know
no bounds, as ſhe is aſſured it can
know no end.

Yet
this truſting confidence, this
honeſt indiſcretion, is, at this early period
of life as amiable as it is natural;
and will, if wiſely cultivated, produce,
[p 105]

at its proper ſeaſon, fruits infinitely
more valuable than all the guarded
circumſpection of premature, and
therefore artificial, prudence. Men, I
believe, are ſeldom ſtruck with theſe
ſudden prepoſſeſſions in favour of each
other. They are not ſo unſuſpecting,
nor ſo eaſily led away by the predominance
of fancy. They engage more
warily, and paſs through the ſeveral
ſtages of acquaintance, intimacy, and
confidence, by ſlower gradations; but
women, if they are ſometimes deceived
in the choice of a friend, enjoy even
then an higher degree of ſatiſfaction
than if they never truſted. For to be
always clad in the burthenſome armour
of ſuſpicion is more painful and
inconvenient, than to run the hazard
of ſuffering now and then a tranſient
injury.
[p 106]

But
the above obſervations only
extend to the young and the inexperienced;
for I am very certain, that
women are capable of as faithful and
as durable friendſhip as any of the
other ſex. They can enter not only
into all the enthuſiaſtic tenderneſs,
but into all the ſolid fidelity of attachment.
And if we cannot oppoſe inſtances
of equal weight with thoſe of
Nyſus and Euryalus, Theſeus and Pirithous,
Pylades and Oreſtes, let it be
remembered, that it is becauſe the recorders
of thoſe characters were men,
and that the very exiſtence of them is
merely poetical.

ON

TRUE AND FALSE

MEEKNESS.

A low
voice and ſoft addreſs
are the common indications of
a well-bred woman, and ſhould ſeem
to be the natural effects of a meek
and quiet ſpirit; but they are only the
outward and viſible ſigns of it: for
[p 108]

they are no more meekneſs itſelf, than
a red coat is courage, or a black one
devotion.

Yet
nothing is more common than
to miſtake the ſign for the thing itſelf;
nor is any practice more frequent than
that of endeavouring to acquire the
exterior mark, without once thinking
to labour after the interior grace. Surely
this is beginning at the wrong end,
like attacking the ſymptom and neglecting
the diſeaſe. To regulate the
features, while the ſoul is in tumults,
or to command the voice while the
paſſions are without reſtraint, is as idle
as throwing odours into a ſtream when
the ſource is polluted.

The

ſapient king
, who knew better
than any man the nature and the power
of beauty, has aſſured us, that the
[p 109]

temper of the mind has a ſtrong influence
upon the features: "Wiſdom
maketh the face to ſhine," ſays that
exquiſite judge; and ſurely no part
of wiſdom is more likely to produce
this amiable effect, than a placid ſerenity
of ſoul.

It
will not be difficult to diſtinguiſh
the true from the artificial meekneſs.
The former is univerſal and habitual,
the latter, local and temporary. Every
young female may keep this rule by
her, to enable her to form a juſt judgment
of her own temper: if ſhe is not
as gentle to her chambermaid as ſhe
is to her viſitor, ſhe may reſt ſatiſfied
that the ſpirit of gentleneſs is not in
her.

Who
would not be ſhocked and
diſappointed to behold a well-bred
[p 110]

young lady, ſoft and engaging as the
doves of Venus, diſplaying a thouſand
graces and attractions to win the hearts
of a large company, and the inſtant they
are gone, to ſee her look mad as the Pythian
maid, and all the frightened graces
driven from her furious countenance,
only becauſe her gown was brought
home a quarter of an hour later than
ſhe expected, or her ribbon ſent half
a ſhade lighter or darker than ſhe ordered?

All
men's characters are ſaid to
proceed from their ſervants; and this
is more particularly true of ladies: for
as their ſituations are more domeſtic,
they lie more open to the inſpection
of their families, to whom their real
characters are eaſily and perfectly
known; for they ſeldom think it worth
while to practiſe any diſguiſe before
[p 111]

thoſe, whoſe good opinion they do not
value, and who are obliged to ſubmit
to their moſt inſupportable humours,
becauſe they are paid for it.

Amongst
women of breeding, the
exterior of gentleneſs is ſo uniformly
aſſumed, and the whole manner is ſo
perfectly level and
uni
, that it is
next to impoſſible for a ſtranger to
know any thing of their true diſpoſitions
by converſing with them, and
even the very features are ſo exactly
regulated, that phyſiognomy, which
may ſometimes be truſted among the
vulgar, is, with the polite, a moſt
lying ſcience.

A very
termagant woman, if ſhe
happens alſo to be a very artful one,
will be conſcious ſhe has ſo much to
conceal, that the dread of betraying
[p 112]

her real temper will make her put on
an over-acted ſoftneſs, which, from its
very exceſs, may be diſtinguiſhed from
the natural, by a penetrating eye. That
gentleneſs is ever liable to be ſuſpected
for the counterfeited, which is ſo exceſſive
as to deprive people of the proper
uſe of ſpeech and motion, or
which, as Hamlet ſays, makes them
liſp and amble, and nick-name God's
creatures.

The
countenance and manners of
ſome very faſhionable perſons may be
compared to the inſcriptions on their
monuments, which ſpeak nothing but
good of what is within; but he who
knows any thing of the world, or of
the human heart, will no more truſt
to the courteſy, than he will depend
on the epitaph.
[p 113]

Among
the various artifices of factitious
meekneſs, one of the moſt frequent
and moſt plauſible, is that of
affecting to be always equally delighted
with all perſons and all characters. The
ſociety of theſe languid beings is without
confidence, their friendſhip without
attachment, and their love without
affection, or even preference. This
inſipid mode of conduct may be ſafe,
but I cannot think it has either taſte,
ſenſe, or principle in it.

These
uniformly ſmiling and approving
ladies, who have neither the
noble courage to reprehend vice, nor
the generous warmth to bear their honeſt
teſtimony in the cauſe of virtue,
conclude every one to be ill-natured
who has any penetration, and look upon
a diſtinguiſhing judgment as want
of tenderneſs. But they ſhould learn,
[p 114]

that this diſcernment does not always
proceed from an uncharitable temper,
but from that long experience and
thorough knowledge of the world,
which lead thoſe who have it to ſcrutinize
into the conduct and diſpoſition
of men, before they truſt entirely to
thoſe fair appearances, which ſometimes
veil the moſt inſidious purpoſes.

We
are perpetually miſtaking the
qualities and diſpoſitions of our own
hearts. We elevate our failings into
virtues, and qualify our vices into
weakneſſes: and hence ariſe ſo many
falſe judgments reſpecting meekneſs.
Self-ignorance is at the root of all this
miſchief. Many ladies complain that,
for their part, their ſpirit is ſo meek
they can bear nothing; whereas, if
they ſpoke truth, they would ſay, their
ſpirit is ſo high and unbroken that
[p 115]

they can bear nothing. Strange! to
plead their meekneſs as a reaſon why
they cannot endure to be croſſed, and
to produce their impatience of contradiction
as a proof of their gentleneſs!

Meekness
, like moſt other virtues,
has certain limits, which it no ſooner
exceeds than it becomes criminal. Servility
of ſpirit is not gentleneſs but
weakneſs, and if allowed, under the
ſpecious appearances it ſometimes puts
on, will lead to the moſt dangerous
compliances. She who hears innocence
maligned without vindicating it,
falſehood aſſerted without contradicting
it, or religion prophaned without
reſenting it, is not gentle but wicked.

To
give up the cauſe of an innocent,
injured friend, if the popular cry happens
to be againſt him, is the moſt
[p 116]

diſgraceful weakneſs. This was the
caſe of Madame de Maintenon. She
loved the character and admired the
talents of Racine; ſhe careſſed him
while he had no enemies, but wanted
the greatneſs of mind, or rather the
common juſtice, to protect him againſt
their reſentment when he had; and
her favourite was abandoned to the
ſuſpicious jealouſy of the king, when
a prudent remonſtrance might have
preſerved him.—But her tameneſs, if
not abſolute connivance in the great
maſſacre of the proteſtants, in whoſe
church ſhe had been bred, is a far
more guilty inſtance of her weakneſs;
an inſtance which, in ſpite of all her
devotional zeal and incomparable prudence,
will diſqualify her from ſhining
in the annals of good women, however
ſhe may be entitled to figure
among the great and the fortunate.
[p 117]

Compare her conduct with that of her
undaunted and pious countryman and
contemporary, Bougi, who, when
Louis would have prevailed on him
to renounce his religion for a commiſſion
or a government, nobly replied,
"If I could be perſuaded to betray
my God for a marſhal's ſtaff, I
might betray my king for a bribe
of much leſs conſequence."

Meekness
is imperfect, if it be not
both active and paſſive; if it will not
enable us to ſubdue our own paſſions
and reſentments, as well as qualify us
to bear patiently the paſſions and reſentments
of others.

Before
we give way to any violent
emotion of anger, it would perhaps be
worth while to conſider the value of
the object which excites it, and to re
[p 118]
flect
for a moment, whether the thing
we ſo ardently deſire, or ſo vehemently
reſent, be really of as much importance
to us, as that delightful tranquillity
of ſoul, which we renounce in
purſuit of it. If, on a fair calculation,
we find we are not likely to get as
much as we are ſure to loſe, then,
putting all religious conſiderations out
of the queſtion, common ſenſe and
human policy will tell us, we have
made a fooliſh and unprofitable exchange.
Inward quiet is a part of
one's ſelf; the object of our reſentment
may be only a matter of opinion; and,
certainly, what makes a portion of
our actual happineſs ought to be too
dear to us, to be ſacrificed for a trifling,
foreign, perhaps imaginary good.

The
moſt pointed ſatire I remember
to have read, on a mind enſlaved by
[p 119]

anger, is an obſervation of Seneca's.
"Alexander (ſaid he) had two friends,
Clitus and Lyſimachus; the one he
expoſed to a lion, the other to himſelf:
he who was turned looſe to the
beaſt eſcaped, but Clitus was murdered,
for he was turned looſe to an
angry man."

A passionate
woman's happineſs
is never in her own keeping: it is the
ſport of accident, and the ſlave of
events. It is in the power of her acquaintance,
her ſervants, but chiefly
of her enemies, and all her comforts
lie at the mercy of others. So far
from being willing to learn of him
who was meek and lowly, ſhe conſiders
meekneſs as the want of a becoming
ſpirit, and lowlineſs as a deſpicable
and vulgar meanneſs. And an imperious
woman will ſo little covet the
[p 120]

ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit,
that it is almoſt the only ornament ſhe
will not be ſolicitous to wear. But reſentment
is a very expenſive vice. How
dearly has it coſt its votaries, even
from the ſin of Cain, the firſt offender
in this kind! "It is cheaper (ſays a
pious writer) to forgive, and ſave
the charges."

If
it were only for mere human reaſons,
it would turn to a better account
to be patient; nothing defeats the malice
of an enemy like a ſpirit of forbearance;
the return of rage for rage
cannot be ſo effectually provoking.
True gentleneſs, like an impenetrable
armour, repels the moſt pointed ſhafts
of malice: they cannot pierce through
this invulnerable ſhield, but either fall
hurtleſs to the ground, or return to
wound the hand that ſhot them.
[p 121]

A meek
ſpirit will not look out of itſelf
for happineſs, becauſe it finds a
conſtant banquet at home; yet, by a
ſort of divine alchymy, it will convert
all external events to its own profit,
and be able to deduce ſome good, even
from the moſt unpromiſing: it will extract
comfort and ſatiſfaction from the
moſt barren circumſtances: "It will
ſuck honey out of the rock, and oil
out of the flinty rock."

But
the ſupreme excellence of this
complacent quality is, that it naturally
diſpoſes the mind where it reſides, to
the practice of every other that is amiable.
Meekneſs may be called the
pioneer of all the other virtues, which
levels every obſtruction, and ſmooths
every difficulty that might impede
their entrance, or retard their progreſs.
[p 122]

The
peculiar importance and value
of this amiable virtue may be farther
ſeen in its permanency. Honours and
dignities are tranſient, beauty and
riches frail and fugacious, to a proverb.
Would not the truly wiſe,
therefore, wiſh to have ſome one poſſeſſion,
which they might call their own
in the ſevereſt exigencies? But this
wiſh can only be accompliſhed by acquiring
and maintaining that calm and
abſolute ſelf-poſſeſſion, which, as the
world had no hand in giving, ſo it
cannot, by the moſt malicious exertion
of its power, take away.
[p 123]

THOUGHTS

on the

CULTIVATION

of the

HEART
and
TEMPER

in the

EDUCATION
of
DAUGHTERS.

I have
not the fooliſh preſumption
to imagine, that I can offer
any thing new on a ſubject, which
has been ſo ſucceſſfully treated by
many learned and able writers. I would
only, with all poſſible deference, beg
[p 124]

leave to hazard a few ſhort remarks
on that part of the ſubject of education,
which I would call the
education
of the heart
. I am well aware, that
this part alſo has not been leſs ſkilfully
and forcibly diſcuſſed than the
reſt, though I cannot, at the ſame
time, help remarking, that it does
not appear to have been ſo much
adopted into common practice.

It
appears then, that notwithſtanding
the great and real improvements,
which have been made in the affair
of female education, and notwithſtanding
the more enlarged and generous
views of it, which prevail in the preſent
day, that there is ſtill a very material
defect, which it is not, in general,
enough the object of attention to remove.
This defect ſeems to conſiſt
in this, that too little regard is paid
[p 125]

to the diſpoſitions of the
mind
, that
the indications of the
temper
are not
properly cheriſhed, nor the affections
of the
heart
ſufficiently regulated.

In
the firſt education of girls, as
far as the cuſtoms which faſhion eſtabliſhes
are right, they ſhould undoubtedly
be followed. Let the exterior be
made a conſiderable object of attention,
but let it not be the principal, let it
not be the only one.—Let the graces
be induſtriouſly cultivated, but let
them not be cultivated at the expence
of the virtues.—Let the arms, the
head, the whole perſon be carefully
poliſhed, but let not the heart be the
only portion of the human anatomy,
which ſhall be totally overlooked.

The
neglect of this cultivation ſeems
to proceed as much from a bad taſte,
[p 126]

as from a falſe principle. The generality
of people form their judgment
of education by ſlight and ſudden appearances,
which is certainly a wrong
way of determining. Muſic, dancing,
and languages, gratify thoſe who teach
them, by perceptible and almoſt immediate
effects; and when there happens
to be no imbecillity in the pupil, nor
deficiency in the matter, every ſuperficial
obſerver can, in ſome meaſure,
judge of the progreſs.—The effects of
moſt of theſe accompliſhments addreſs
themſelves to the ſenſes; and there are
more who can ſee and hear, than there
are who can judge and reflect.

Personal
perfection is not only
more obvious, it is alſo more rapid;
and even in very accompliſhed characters,
elegance uſually precedes principle.
[p 127]

But
the heart, that natural ſeat of
evil propenſities, that little troubleſome
empire of the paſſions, is led to
what is right by ſlow motions and imperceptible
degrees. It muſt be admoniſhed
by reproof, and allured by
kindneſs. Its livelieſt advances are
frequently impeded by the obſtinacy
of prejudice, and its brighteſt promiſes
often obſcured by the tempeſts
of paſſion. It is ſlow in its acquiſition
of virtue, and reluctant in its approaches
to piety.

There
is another reaſon, which
proves this mental cultivation to be
more important, as well as more difficult,
than any other part of education.
In the uſual faſhionable accompliſhments,
the buſineſs of acquiring them
is almoſt always getting forwards, and
one difficulty is conquered before an
[p 128]
other
is ſuffered to ſhew itſelf; for a
prudent teacher will level the road his
pupil is to paſs, and ſmooth the inequalities
which might retard her progreſs.

But
in morals, (which ſhould be
the great object conſtantly kept in
view) the talk is far more difficult.
The unruly and turbulent deſires of
the heart are not ſo obedient; one paſſion
will ſtart up before another is ſuppreſſed.
The ſubduing Hercules cannot
cut off the heads ſo often as the
prolific Hydra can produce them, nor
fell the ſtubborn Antæus ſo faſt as he
can recruit his ſtrength, and riſe in
vigorous and repeated oppoſition.

If
all the accompliſhments could be
bought at the price of a ſingle virtue,
the purchaſe would be infinitely dear!
[p 129]

And, however ſtartling it may ſound,
I think it is, notwithſtanding, true,
that the labours of a good and wiſe
mother, who is anxious for her daughter's
moſt important intereſts, will
ſeem

to be at variance with thoſe of her inſtructors.
She will doubtleſs rejoice
at her progreſs in any polite art, but
ſhe will rejoice with trembling:—humility
and piety form the ſolid and
durable baſis, on which ſhe wiſhes to
raiſe the ſuperſtructure of the accompliſhments,
while the accompliſhments
themſelves are frequently of that unſteady
nature, that if the foundation
is not ſecured, in proportion as the
building is enlarged, it will be overloaded
and deſtroyed by thoſe very
ornaments, which were intended to
embelliſh, what they have contributed
to ruin.
[p 130]

The
more oſtenſible qualifications
ſhould be carefully regulated, or they
will be in danger of putting to flight
the modeſt train of retreating virtues,
which cannot ſafely ſubſiſt before the
bold eye of public obſervation, or
bear the bolder tongue of impudent
and audacious flattery. A tender mother
cannot but feel an honeſt triumph,
in contemplating thoſe excellencies in
her daughter which deſerve applauſe,
but ſhe will alſo ſhudder at the vanity
which that applauſe may excite, and
at thoſe hitherto unknown ideas which
it may awaken.

The
maſter, it is his intereſt, and
perhaps his duty, will naturally teach
a girl to ſet her improvements in the
moſt conſpicuous point of light.
Se
faire valoir
is the great principle
induſtriouſly inculcated into her young
[p 131]

heart, and ſeems to be conſidered as
a kind of fundamental maxim in education.
It is however the certain and
effectual ſeed, from which a thouſand
yet unborn vanities will ſpring. This
dangerous doctrine (which yet is not
without its uſes) will be counteracted
by the prudent mother, not in ſo
many words, but by a watchful and
ſcarcely perceptible dexterity. Such
an one will be more careful to have
the talents of her daughter
cultivated

than
exhibited
.

One
would be led to imagine, by
the common mode of female education,
that life conſiſted of one univerſal
holiday, and that the only conteſt
was, who ſhould be beſt enabled
to excel in the ſports and games that
were to be celebrated on it. Merely
ornamental accompliſhments will but
[p 132]

indifferently qualify a woman to perform
the
duties
of life, though it is
highly proper ſhe ſhould poſſeſs them,
in order to furniſh the
amuſements
of
it. But is it right to ſpend ſo large
a portion of life without ſome preparation
for the buſineſs of living? A
lady may ſpeak a little French and
Italian, repeat a few paſſages in a theatrical
tone, play and ſing, have her
dreſſing-room hung with her own drawings,
and her perſon covered with her
own tambour work, and may, notwithſtanding,
have been very
badly
educated
. Yet I am far from attempting
to depreciate the value of theſe
qualifications: they are moſt of them
not only highly becoming, but often
indiſpenſably neceſſary, and a polite
education cannot be perfected without
them. But as the world ſeems to
be very well appriſed of their import
[p 133]
ance,
there is the leſs occaſion to inſiſt
on their utility. Yet, though well-bred
young women ſhould learn to
dance, ſing, recite and draw, the end
of a good education is not that they
may become dancers, ſingers, players
or painters: its real object is to make
them good daughters, good wives,
good miſtreſſes, good members of ſociety,
and good chriſtians. The above
qualifications therefore are intended to

adorn
their
leiſure
, not to
employ
their

lives
; for an amiable and wiſe woman
will always have ſomething better to
value herſelf on, than theſe advantages,
which, however captivating,
are ſtill but ſubordinate parts of a truly
excellent character.

But
I am afraid parents themſelves
ſometimes contribute to the error of
which I am complaining. Do they
[p 134]

not often ſet a higher value on thoſe
acquiſitions which are calculated to
attract obſervation, and catch the eye
of the multitude, than on thoſe which
are valuable, permanent, and internal?
Are they not ſometimes more ſolicitous
about the opinion of others, reſpecting
their children, than about
the real advantage and happineſs of
the children themſelves? To an injudicious
and ſuperficial eye, the beſt
educated girl may make the leaſt brilliant
figure, as ſhe will probably have
leſs flippancy in her manner, and leſs
repartee in her expreſſion; and her acquirements,
to borrow biſhop Sprat's
idea, will be rather
enamelled than emboſſed
.
But her merit will be known,
and acknowledged by all who come
near enough to diſcern, and have taſte
enough to diſtinguiſh. It will be underſtood
and admired by the man,
[p 135]

whoſe happineſs ſhe is one day to
make, whoſe family ſhe is to govern,
and whoſe children ſhe is to educate.
He will not ſeek for her in the haunts
of diſſipation, for he knows he ſhall
not find her there; but he will ſeek
for her in the boſom of retirement, in
the practice of every domeſtic virtue,
in the exertion of every amiable accompliſhment,
exerted in the ſhade, to
enliven retirement, to heighten the
endearing pleaſures of ſocial intercourſe,
and to embelliſh the narrow
but charming circle of family delights.
To this amiable purpoſe, a truly good
and well educated young lady will dedicate
her more elegant accompliſhments,
inſtead of exhibiting them to attract
admiration, or depreſs inferiority.

Young
girls, who have more vivacity
than underſtanding, will often
[p 136]

make a ſprightly figure in converſation.
But this agreeable talent for entertaining
others, is frequently dangerous to
themſelves, nor is it by any means to
be deſired or encouraged very early in
life. This immaturity of wit is helped
on by frivolous reading, which will
produce its effect in much leſs time
than books of ſolid inſtruction; for the
imagination is touched ſooner than the
underſtanding; and effects are more
rapid as they are more pernicious.
Converſation ſhould be the
reſult
of
education, not the
precurſor
of it. It
is a golden fruit, when ſuffered to
grow gradually on the tree of knowledge;
but if precipitated by forced
and unnatural means, it will in the
end become vapid, in proportion as it
is artificial.
[p 137]

The
beſt effects of a careful and
religious education are often very remote:
they are to be diſcovered in
future ſcenes, and exhibited in untried
connexions. Every event of life will
be putting the heart into freſh ſituations,
and making demands on its
prudence, its firmneſs, its integrity,
or its piety. Thoſe whoſe buſineſs it
is to form it, can foreſee none of theſe
ſituations; yet, as far as human wiſdom
will allow, they muſt enable it
to provide for them all, with an humble
dependence on the divine aſſiſtance.
A well-diſciplined ſoldier muſt learn
and practiſe all his evolutions, though
he does not know on what ſervice his
leader may command him, by what
foe he ſhall be attacked, nor what
mode of combat the enemy may
uſe.
[p 138]

One
great art of education conſiſts
in not ſuffering the feelings to become
too acute by unneceſſary awakening,
nor too obtuſe by the want of exertion.
The former renders them the ſource
of calamity, and totally ruins the temper;
while the latter blunts and debaſes
them, and produces a dull, cold,
and ſelfiſh ſpirit. For the mind is an
inſtrument, which, if wound too high,
will loſe its ſweetneſs, and if not
enough ſtrained, will abate of its vigour.

How
cruel is it to extinguiſh by
neglect or unkindneſs, the precious
ſenſibility of an open temper, to chill
the amiable glow of an ingenuous ſoul,
and to quench the bright flame of a
noble and generous ſpirit! Theſe are
of higher worth than all the documents
of learning, of dearer price than all
[p 139]

the advantages, which can be derived
from the moſt refined and artificial
mode of education.

But
ſenſibility and delicacy, and an
ingenuous temper, make no part of
education, exclaims the pedagogue—they
are reducible to no claſs—they
come under no article of inſtruction—they
belong neither to languages nor
to muſic.—What an error! They
are

a part of education, and of infinitely
more value,

Than all their pedant diſcipline e'er knew.

It is true, they are ranged under no
claſs, but they are ſuperior to all;
they are of more eſteem than languages
or muſic, for they are the language of
the heart, and the muſic of the according
paſſions. Yet this ſenſibility is,
in many inſtances, ſo far from being
[p 140]

cultivated, that it is not uncommon
to ſee thoſe who affect more than uſual
ſagacity, caſt a ſmile of ſupercilious
pity, at any indication of a warm,
generous, or enthuſiaſtic temper in the
lively and the young; as much as to
ſay, "they will know better, and will
have more diſcretion when they are
older." But every appearance of
amiable ſimplicity, or of honeſt ſhame,

Nature's haſty conſcience
, will be dear
to ſenſible hearts; they will carefully
cheriſh every ſuch indication in a
young female; for they will perceive
that it is this temper, wiſely cultivated,
which will one day make her
enamoured of the lovelineſs of virtue,
and the beauty of holineſs: from
which ſhe will acquire a taſte for the
doctrines of religion, and a ſpirit to
perform the duties of it. And thoſe
who wiſh to make her aſhamed of
[p 141]

this charming temper, and ſeek to diſpoſſeſs
her of it, will, it is to be feared,
give her nothing better in exchange.
But whoever reflects at all, will eaſily
diſcern how carefully this enthuſiaſm
is to be directed, and how judiciouſly
its redundances are to be lopped
away.

Prudence
is not natural to children;
they can, however, ſubſtitute
art in its ſtead. But is it not much
better that a girl ſhould diſcover the
faults incident to her age, than conceal
them under this dark and impenetrable
veil? I could almoſt venture
to aſſert, that there is ſomething more
becoming in the very errors of nature,
where they are undiſguiſed, than in the
affectation of virtue itſelf, where the
reality is wanting. And I am ſo far
from being an admirer of prodigies,
[p 142]

that I am extremely apt to ſuſpect
them; and am always infinitely better
pleaſed with Nature in her more common
modes of operation. The preciſe
and premature wiſdom, which ſome
girls have cunning enough to aſſume,
is of a more dangerous tendency than
any of their natural failings can be,
as it effectually covers thoſe ſecret bad
diſpoſitions, which, if they diſplayed
themſelves, might be rectified. The
hypocriſy of aſſuming virtues which
are not inherent in the heart, prevents
the growth and diſcloſure of thoſe real
ones, which it is the great end of education
to cultivate.

But
if the natural indications of the
temper are to be ſuppreſſed and ſtifled,
where are the diagnoſtics, by which
the ſtate of the mind is to be known?
The wiſe Author of all things, who
[p 143]

did nothing in vain, doubtleſs intended
them as ſymptoms, by which to
judge of the diſeaſes of the heart;
and it is impoſſible diſeaſes ſhould be
cured before they are known. If the
ſtream be ſo cut off as to prevent communication,
or ſo choked up as to
defeat diſcovery, how ſhall we ever
reach the ſource, out of which are the
iſſues of life?

This
cunning, which, of all the
different diſpoſitions girls diſcover, is
moſt to be dreaded, is increaſed by
nothing ſo much as by fear. If thoſe
about them expreſs violent and unreaſonable
anger at every trivial offence,
it will always promote this temper,
and will very frequently create it,
where there was a natural tendency to
frankneſs. The indiſcreet tranſports
of rage, which many betray on every
[p 144]

ſlight occaſion, and the little diſtinction
they make between venial errors
and premeditated crimes, naturally
diſpoſe a child to conceal, what ſhe
does not however care to ſuppreſs.
Anger in one will not remedy the faults
of another; for how can an inſtrument
of ſin cure ſin? If a girl is kept in
a ſtate of perpetual and ſlaviſh terror,
ſhe will perhaps have artifice enough
to conceal thoſe propenſities which
ſhe knows are wrong, or thoſe actions
which ſhe thinks are moſt obnoxious
to puniſhment. But, nevertheleſs, ſhe
will not ceaſe to indulge thoſe propenſities,
and to commit thoſe actions,
when ſhe can do it with impunity.

Good

diſpoſitions
, of themſelves, will
go but a very little way, unleſs they
are confirmed into good
principles
.
And this cannot be effected but by a
[p 145]

careful courſe of religious inſtruction,
and a patient and laborious cultivation
of the moral temper.

But
, notwithſtanding girls ſhould
not be treated with unkindneſs, nor
the firſt openings of the paſſions blighted
by cold ſeverity; yet I am of opinion,
that young females ſhould be
accuſtomed very early in life to a certain
degree of reſtraint. The natural
caſt of character, and the moral diſtinctions
between the ſexes, ſhould
not be diſregarded, even in childhood.
That bold, independent, enterpriſing
ſpirit, which is ſo much admired in
boys, ſhould not, when it happens to
diſcover itſelf in the other ſex, be encouraged,
but ſuppreſſed. Girls ſhould
be taught to give up their opinions
betimes, and not pertinaciouſly to carry
on a diſpute, even if they ſhould
[p 146]

know themſelves to be in the right.
I do not mean, that they ſhould be
robbed of the liberty of private judgment,
but that they ſhould by no
means be encouraged to contract a
contentious or contradictory turn. It
is of the greateſt importance to their
future happineſs, that they ſhould acquire
a ſubmiſſive temper, and a forbearing
ſpirit: for it is a leſſon which
the world will not fail to make them
frequently practiſe, when they come
abroad into it, and they will not practiſe
it the worſe for having learnt it
the ſooner. Theſe early reſtraints, in
the limitation here meant, are ſo far
from being an effect of cruelty, that
they are the moſt indubitable marks of
affection, and are the more meritorious,
as they are ſevere trials of tenderneſs.
But all the beneficial effects, which a
mother can expect from this watch
[p 147]
fulneſs,
will be entirely defeated, if
it is practiſed occaſionally, and not
habitually, and if it ever appears to
be uſed to gratify caprice, ill-humour,
or reſentment.

Those
who have children to educate
ought to be extremely patient:
it is indeed a labour of love. They
ſhould reflect, that extraordinary talents
are neither eſſential to the well-being
of ſociety, nor to the happineſs
of individuals. If that had been the
caſe, the beneficent Father of the univerſe
would not have made them ſo
rare. For it is as eaſy for an Almighty
Creator to produce a Newton, as an
ordinary man; and he could have made
thoſe powers common which we now
conſider as wonderful, without any
miraculous exertion of his omnipotence,
if the exiſtence of many New
[p 148]
tons
had been neceſſary to the perfection
of his wiſe and gracious plan.

Surely
, therefore, there is more
piety, as well as more ſenſe, in labouring
to improve the talents which children
actually have, than in lamenting
that they do not poſſeſs ſupernatural
endowments or angelic perfections. A
paſſage of Lord Bacon's furniſhes an
admirable incitement for endeavouring
to carry the amiable and chriſtian
grace of charity to its fartheſt extent,
inſtead of indulging an over-anxious
care for more brilliant but leſs important
acquiſitions. "The deſire of
power in exceſs (ſays he) cauſed the
angels to fall; the deſire of knowledge
in exceſs cauſed man to fall;
but in charity is no exceſs, neither
can men nor angels come into danger
by it."
[p 149]

A girl
who has docility will ſeldom
be found to want underſtanding enough
for all the purpoſes of a ſocial, a happy,
and an uſeful life. And when
we behold the tender hope of fond
and anxious love, blaſted by diſappointment,
the defect will as often be
diſcovered to proceed from the neglect
or the error of cultivation, as from the
natural temper; and thoſe who lament
the evil, will ſometimes be found to
have occaſioned it.

It
is as injudicious for parents to ſet
out with too ſanguine a dependence
on the merit of their children, as it is
for them to be diſcouraged at every
repulſe. When their wiſhes are defeated
in this or that particular inſtance,
where they had treaſured up
ſome darling expectation, this is ſo far
from being a reaſon for relaxing their
[p 150]

attention, that it ought to be an additional
motive for redoubling it. Thoſe
who hope to do a great deal, muſt not
expect to do every thing. If they
know any thing of the malignity of
ſin, the blindneſs of prejudice, or the
corruption of the human heart, they
will alſo know, that that heart will always
remain, after the very beſt poſſible
education, full of infirmity and imperfection.
Extraordinary allowances, therefore,
muſt be made for the weakneſs
of nature in this its weakeſt ſtate. After
much is done, much will remain to
do, and much, very much, will ſtill
be left undone. For this regulation
of the paſſions and affections cannot
be the work of education alone, without
the concurrence of divine grace
operating on the heart. Why then
ſhould parents repine, if their efforts
are not always crowned with imme
[p 151]
diate
ſucceſs? They ſhould conſider,
that they are not educating cherubims
and ſeraphims, but men and women;
creatures, who at their beſt eſtate are altogether
vanity: how little then can be
expected from them in the weakneſs
and imbecillity of infancy! I have dwelt
on this part of the ſubject the longer,
becauſe I am certain that many, who
have ſet out with a warm and active
zeal, have cooled on the very firſt
diſcouragement, and have afterwards
almoſt totally remitted their vigilance,
through a criminal kind of deſpair.

Great
allowances muſt be made
for a profuſion of gaiety, loquacity,
and even indiſcretion in children, that
there may be animation enough left to
ſupply an active and uſeful character,
when the firſt fermentation of the
youthful paſſions is over, and the re
[p 152]
dundant
ſpirits ſhall come to ſubſide.

If
it be true, as a conſummate judge
of human nature has obſerved,

That not a vanity is given in vain,

it is alſo true, that there is ſcarcely a
ſingle paſſion, which may not be turned
to ſome good account, if prudently
rectified, and ſkilfully turned into the
road of ſome neighbouring virtue. It
cannot be violently bent, or unnaturally
forced towards an object of a
totally oppoſite nature, but may be
gradually inclined towards a correſpondent
but ſuperior affection. Anger,
hatred, reſentment, and ambition, the
moſt reſtleſs and turbulent paſſions
which ſhake and diſtract the human
ſoul, may be led to become the moſt
active oppoſers of ſin, after having
[p 153]

been its moſt ſucceſſful inſtruments.
Our anger, for inſtance, which can
never be totally ſubdued, may be made
to turn againſt ourſelves, for our weak
and imperfect obedience—our hatred,
againſt every ſpecies of vice—our ambition,
which will not be diſcarded,
may be ennobled: it will not change
its name, but its object: it will deſpiſe
what it lately valued, nor be
contented to graſp at leſs than immortality.

Thus
the joys, fears, hopes, deſires,
all the paſſions and affections, which
ſeparate in various currents from the
ſoul, will, if directed into their proper
channels, after having fertiliſed
wherever they have flowed, return
again to ſwell and enrich the parent
ſource.
[p 154]

That
the very paſſions which appear
the moſt uncontroulable and unpromiſing,
may be intended, in the great
ſcheme of Providence, to anſwer ſome
important purpoſe, is remarkably evidenced
in the character and hiſtory
of Saint Paul. A remark on this ſubject
by an ingenious old Spaniſh writer,
which I will here take the liberty
to tranſlate, will better illuſtrate my
meaning.

"
To
convert the bittereſt enemy
into the moſt zealous advocate, is
the work of God for the inſtruction
of man. Plutarch has obſerved,
that the medical ſcience would be
brought to the utmoſt perfection,
when poiſon ſhould be converted
into phyſic. Thus, in the mortal
diſeaſe of Judaiſm and idolatry,
[p 155]

our bleſſed Lord converted the adder's
venom of Saul the perſecutor,
into that cement which made Paul
the choſen veſſel. That manly activity,
that reſtleſs ardor, that
burning zeal for the law of his
fathers, that ardent thirſt for the
blood of Chriſtians, did the Son
of God find neceſſary in the man
who was one day to become the
defender of his ſuffering people.
[7]
"

To
win the paſſions, therefore, over
to the cauſe of virtue, anſwers a much
nobler end than their extinction would
poſſibly do, even if that could be effected.
But it is their nature never
to obſerve a neutrality; they are either
rebels or auxiliaries, and an
enemy ſubdued is an ally obtained.
[p 156]

If I may be allowed to change the alluſion
ſo ſoon, I would ſay, that the
paſſions alſo reſemble fires, which are
friendly and beneficial when under proper
direction, but if ſuffered to blaze
without reſtraint, they carry devaſtation
along with them, and, if totally extinguiſhed,
leave the benighted mind
in a ſtate of cold and comfortleſs inanity.

But
in ſpeaking of the uſefulneſs
of the paſſions, as inſtruments of virtue,

envy
and
lying
muſt always be
excepted: theſe, I am perſuaded, muſt
either go on in ſtill progreſſive miſchief,
or elſe be radically cured, before
any good can be expected from
the heart which has been infected with
them. For I never will believe that
envy, though paſſed through all the
moral ſtrainers, can be refined into a
[p 157]

virtuous emulation, or lying improved
into an agreeable turn for innocent invention.
Almoſt all the other paſſions
may be made to take an amiable
hue; but theſe two muſt either be totally
extirpated, or be always contented
to preſerve their original deformity,
and to wear their native black.

on the

IMPORTANCE
of
RELIGION

to the

FEMALE CHARACTER.

Various
are the reaſons why
the greater part of mankind cannot
apply themſelves to arts or letters.
Particular ſtudies are only ſuited to
the capacities of particular perſons.
Some are incapable of applying to
[p 159]

them from the delicacy of their ſex,
ſome from the unſteadineſs of youth,
and others from the imbecillity of age.
Many are precluded by the narrowneſs
of their education, and many by
the ſtraitneſs of their fortune. The
wiſdom of God is wonderfully manifeſted
in this happy and well-ordered
diverſity, in the powers and properties
of his creatures; ſince by thus admirably
ſuiting the agent to the action,
the whole ſcheme of human affairs is
carried on with the moſt agreeing and
conſiſtent [oe]conomy, and no chaſm is
left for want of an object to fill it, exactly
ſuited to its nature.

But
in the great and univerſal concern
of religion, both ſexes, and all
ranks, are equally intereſted. The
truly catholic ſpirit of chriſtianity accommodates
itſelf, with an aſtoniſh
[p 160]
ing
condeſcenſion, to the circumſtances
of the whole human race. It rejects
none on account of their pecuniary
wants, their perſonal infirmities, or
their intellectual deficiencies. No ſuperiority
of parts is the leaſt recommendation,
nor is any depreſſion of
fortune the ſmalleſt objection. None
are too wiſe to be excuſed from performing
the duties of religion, nor are
any too poor to be excluded from the
conſolations of its promiſes.

If
we admire the wiſdom of God,
in having furniſhed different degrees
of intelligence, ſo exactly adapted to
their different deſtinations, and in having
fitted every part of his ſtupendous work,
not only to ſerve its own immediate
purpoſe, but alſo to contribute to the
beauty and perfection of the whole:
how much more ought we to adore
[p 161]

that goodneſs, which has perfected the
divine plan, by appointing one wide,
comprehenſive, and univerſal means
of ſalvation: a ſalvation, which all
are invited to partake; by a means
which all are capable of uſing; which
nothing but voluntary blindneſs can
prevent our comprehending, and nothing
but wilful error can hinder us
from embracing.

The
Muſes are coy, and will only
be wooed and won by ſome highly-favoured
ſuitors. The Sciences are
lofty, and will not ſtoop to the reach
of ordinary capacities. But "Wiſdom
(by which the royal preacher
means piety) is a loving ſpirit: ſhe
is eaſily ſeen of them that love her,
and found of all ſuch as ſeek her."
Nay, ſhe is ſo acceſſible and condeſcending,
"that ſhe preventeth them
[p 162]

that deſire her, making herſelf firſt
known unto them."

We
are told by the ſame animated
writer, "that Wiſdom is the breath
of the power of God." How infinitely
ſuperior, in grandeur and ſublimity,
is this deſcription to the origin
of the
wiſdom
of the heathens, as deſcribed
by their poets and mythologiſts!
In the exalted ſtrains of the Hebrew
poetry we read, that "Wiſdom is the
brightneſs of the everlaſting light,
the unſpotted mirror of the power
of God, and the image of his goodneſs."

The
philoſophical author of
The
Defence of Learning
obſerves, that
knowledge has ſomething of venom
and malignity in it, when taken without
its proper corrective, and what
[p 163]

that is, the inſpired Saint Paul teaches
us, by placing it as the immediate antidote:

Knowledge puffeth up, but charity
edifieth.
Perhaps, it is the vanity
of human wiſdom, unchaſtiſed by this
correcting principle, which has made
ſo many infidels. It may proceed from
the arrogance of a ſelf-ſufficient pride,
that ſome philoſophers diſdain to acknowledge
their belief in a being, who
has judged proper to conceal from
them the infinite wiſdom of his counſels;
who, (to borrow the lofty language
of the man of Uz) refuſed to
conſult them when he laid the foundations
of the earth, when he ſhut up
the ſea with doors, and made the
clouds the garment thereof.

A man
muſt be an infidel either
from pride, prejudice, or bad education:
he cannot be one unawares or
[p 164]

by ſurpriſe; for infidelity is not occaſioned
by ſudden impulſe or violent
temptation. He may be hurried by
ſome vehement deſire into an immoral
action, at which he will bluſh in his
cooler moments, and which he will
lament as the ſad effect of a ſpirit unſubdued
by religion; but infidelity is
a calm, conſiderate act, which cannot
plead the weakneſs of the heart, or
the ſeduction of the ſenſes. Even
good men frequently fail in their duty
through the infirmities of nature, and
the allurements of the world; but the
infidel errs on a plan, on a ſettled and
deliberate principle.

But
though the minds of men are
ſometimes fatally infected with this
diſeaſe, either through unhappy prepoſſeſſion,
or ſome of the other cauſes
above mentioned; yet I am unwilling
[p 165]

to believe, that there is in nature ſo
monſtrouſly incongruous a being, as
a
female infidel
. The leaſt reflexion on
the temper, the character, and the
education of women, makes the mind
revolt with horror from an idea ſo improbable,
and ſo unnatural.

May
I be allowed to obſerve, that,
in general, the minds of girls ſeem
more aptly prepared in their early
youth for the reception of ſerious
impreſſions than thoſe of the other ſex,
and that their leſs expoſed ſituations
in more advanced life qualify them
better for the preſervation of them?
The daughters (of good parents I
mean) are often more carefully inſtructed
in their religious duties, than
the ſons, and this from a variety of
cauſes. They are not ſo ſoon ſent
from under the paternal eye into the
[p 166]

buſtle of the world, and ſo early expoſed
to the contagion of bad example:
their hearts are naturally more
flexible, ſoft, and liable to any kind
of impreſſion the forming hand may
ſtamp on them; and, laſtly, as they
do not receive the ſame claſſical education
with boys, their feeble minds
are not obliged at once to receive and
ſeparate the precepts of chriſtianity,
and the documents of pagan philoſophy.
The neceſſity of doing this perhaps
ſomewhat weakens the ſerious
impreſſions of young men, at leaſt till
the underſtanding is formed, and confuſes
their ideas of piety, by mixing
them with ſo much heterogeneous
matter. They only caſually read, or
hear read, the ſcriptures of truth,
while they are obliged to learn by
heart, conſtrue and repeat the poetical
fables of the leſs than human gods
[p 167]

of the ancients. And as the excellent author
of
The Internal Evidence of the Chriſtian
Religion
obſerves, "Nothing has
ſo much contributed to corrupt the
true ſpirit of the chriſtian inſtitution,
as that partiality which we contract,
in our earlieſt education, for the
manners of pagan antiquity."

Girls
, therefore, who do
not
contract
this early partiality, ought to
have a clearer notion of their religious
duties: they are not obliged, at an
age when the judgment is ſo weak,
to diſtinguiſh between the doctrines
of Zeno, of Epicurus, and of Christ;
and to embarraſs their minds with the
various morals which were taught in
the
Porch
, in the
Academy
, and on the

Mount
.
[p 168]

It
is preſumed, that theſe remarks
cannot poſſibly be ſo miſunderſtood,
as to be conſtrued into the leaſt diſreſpect
to literature, or a want of the
higheſt reverence for a learned education,
the baſis of all elegant knowledge:
they are only intended, with
all proper deference, to point out to
young women, that however inferior
their advantages of acquiring a knowledge
of the belles-lettres are to thoſe
of the other ſex; yet it depends on
themſelves not to be ſurpaſſed in this
moſt important of all ſtudies, for
which their abilities are equal, and
their opportunities, perhaps, greater.

But
the mere exemption from infidelity
is ſo ſmall a part of the religious
character, that I hope no one
will attempt to claim any merit from
this negative ſort of goodneſs, or va
[p 169]
lue
herſelf merely for not being the
very worſt thing ſhe poſſibly can be.
Let no miſtaken girl fancy ſhe gives
a proof of her wit by her want of piety,
or that a contempt of things ſerious
and ſacred will exalt her underſtanding,
or raiſe her character even in the
opinion of the moſt avowed male infidels.
For one may venture to affirm,
that with all their profligate ideas,
both of women and of religion, neither
Bolingbroke, Wharton, Buckingham,
nor even
Lord Cheſterfield himſelf
, would
have eſteemed a woman the more for
her being irreligious.

With
whatever ridicule a polite
freethinker may affect to treat religion
himſelf, he will think it neceſſary his
wife ſhould entertain different notions
of it. He may pretend to deſpiſe it
as a matter of opinion, depending on
[p 170]

creeds and ſyſtems; but, if he is a
man of ſenſe, he will know the value
of it, as a governing principle, which
is to influence her conduct and direct
her actions. If he ſees her unaffectedly
ſincere in the practice of her religious
duties, it will be a ſecret pledge
to him, that ſhe will be equally exact
in fulfilling the conjugal; for he can
have no reaſonable dependance on her
attachment to
him
, if he has no opinion
of her fidelity to
God
; for ſhe
who neglects firſt duties, gives but an
indifferent proof of her diſpoſition to
fill up inferior ones; and how can a
man of any underſtanding (whatever
his own religious profeſſions may be)
truſt that woman with the care of his
family, and the education of his children,
who wants herſelf the beſt incentive
to a virtuous life, the belief
that ſhe is an accountable creature,
[p 171]

and the reflection that ſhe has an immortal
ſoul?

Cicero
ſpoke it as the higheſt commendation
of Cato's character, that
he embraced philoſophy, not for the
ſake of
diſputing
like a philoſopher,
but of
living
like one. The chief purpoſe
of chriſtian knowledge is to promote
the great end of a chriſtian life.
Every rational woman ſhould, no
doubt, be able to give a reaſon of
the hope that is in her; but this knowledge
is beſt acquired, and the duties
conſequent on it beſt performed, by
reading books of plain piety and practical
devotion, and not by entering
into the endleſs feuds, and engaging
in the unprofitable contentions of partial
controverſialiſts. Nothing is more
unamiable than the narrow ſpirit of
party zeal, nor more diſguſting than
[p 172]

to hear a woman deal out judgments,
and denounce vengeance againſt any
one, who happens to differ from her
in ſome opinion, perhaps of no real
importance, and which, it is probable,
ſhe may be juſt as wrong in rejecting,
as the object of her cenſure is
in embracing. A furious and unmerciful
female bigot wanders as far beyond
the limits preſcribed to her ſex,
as a Thaleſtris or a Joan d'Arc. Violent
debate has made as few converts
as the ſword, and both theſe inſtruments
are particularly unbecoming
when wielded by a female hand.

But
, though no one will be frightened
out of their opinions, yet they
may be perſuaded out of them: they
may be touched by the affecting earneſtneſs
of ſerious converſation, and
allured by the attractive beauty of a
[p 173]

conſiſtently ſerious life. And while
a young woman ought to dread the
name of a wrangling polemic, it is her
duty to aſpire after the honourable
character of a ſincere Chriſtian. But
this dignified character ſhe can by no
means deſerve, if ſhe is ever afraid to
avow her principles, or aſhamed to
defend them. A profligate, who makes
it a point to ridicule every thing which
comes under the appearance of formal
inſtruction, will be diſconcerted at the
ſpirited yet modeſt rebuke of a pious
young woman. But there is as much
efficacy in the manner of reproving
prophaneneſs, as in the words. If ſhe
corrects it with moroſeneſs, ſhe defeats
the effect of her remedy, by her unſkilful
manner of adminiſtring it. If,
on the other hand, ſhe affects to defend
the inſulted cauſe of God, in a
faint tone of voice, and ſtudied ambi
[p 174]
guity
of phraſe, or with an air of levity,
and a certain expreſſion of pleaſure
in her eyes, which proves ſhe is
ſecretly delighted with what ſhe pretends
to cenſure, ſhe injures religion
much more than he did who publickly
prophaned it; for ſhe plainly indicates,
either that ſhe does not believe, or
reſpect what ſhe profeſſes. The other
attacked it as an open foe; ſhe betrays
it as a falſe friend. No one pays any
regard to the opinion of an avowed
enemy; but the deſertion or treachery
of a profeſſed friend, is dangerous indeed!

It
is a ſtrange notion which prevails
in the world, that religion only belongs
to the old and the melancholy,
and that it is not worth while to pay
the leaſt attention to it, while we are
capable of attending to any thing elſe.
[p 175]

They allow it to be proper enough
for the clergy, whoſe buſineſs it
is, and for the aged, who have not
ſpirits for any buſineſs at all. But till
they can prove, that none except the
clergy and the aged
die
, it muſt be
confeſſed, that this is moſt wretched
reaſoning.

Great
injury is done to the intereſts
of religion, by placing it in a
gloomy and unamiable light. It is
ſometimes ſpoken of, as if it would
actually make a handſome woman ugly,
or a young one wrinkled. But can
any thing be more abſurd than to repreſent
the beauty of holineſs as the
ſource of deformity?

There
are few, perhaps, ſo entirely
plunged in buſineſs, or abſorbed in
[p 176]

pleaſure, as not to intend, at ſome
future time, to ſet about a religious
life in good earneſt. But then they
conſider it as a kind of
dernier reſſort
,
and think it prudent to defer flying to
this diſagreeable refuge, till they have
no reliſh left for any thing elſe. Do
they forget, that to perform this great
buſineſs well requires all the ſtrength
of their youth, and all the vigour of
their unimpaired capacities? To confirm
this aſſertion, they may obſerve
how much the ſlighteſt indiſpoſition,
even in the moſt active ſeaſon of
life, diſorders every faculty, and diſqualifies
them for attending to the
moſt ordinary affairs: and then let
them reflect how little able they will
be to tranſact the moſt important of
all buſineſs, in the moment of excruciating
pain, or in the day of univerſal
debility.
[p 177]

When
the ſenſes are palled with
exceſſive gratification; when the eye
is tired with ſeeing, and the ear with
hearing; when the ſpirits are ſo ſunk,
that the
graſshopper is become a burthen
,
how ſhall the blunted apprehenſion be
capable of underſtanding a new ſcience,
or the worn-out heart be able to reliſh
a new pleaſure?

To
put off religion till we have loſt
all taſte for amuſement; to refuſe liſtening
to the "voice of the charmer,"
till our enfeebled organs can no longer
liſten to the voice of "ſinging men
and ſinging women," and not to
devote our days to heaven till we
have "no pleaſure in them" ourſelves,
is but an ungracious offering. And
it is a wretched ſacrifice to the God of
heaven, to preſent him with the remnants
of decayed appetites, and the
leavings of extinguiſhed paſſions.
[p 178]

MISCELLANEOUS

OBSERVATIONS

on

GENIUS, TASTE, GOOD

SENSE, &c.

[8]

Good

ſenſe
is as different from

genius
as perception is from invention;
yet, though diſtinct qualities,
[p 179]

they frequently ſubſiſt together. It
is altogether oppoſite to
wit
, but by
no means inconſiſtent with it. It is
not ſcience, for there is ſuch a thing
as unlettered good ſenſe; yet, though
it is neither wit, learning, nor genius,
it is a ſubſtitute for each, where they
do not exiſt, and the perfection of all
where they do.

Good ſenſe is ſo far from deſerving
the appellation of
common ſenſe
, by
which it is frequently called, that it is
perhaps one of the rareſt qualities of
the human mind. If, indeed, this
name is given it in reſpect to its peculiar
ſuitableneſs to the purpoſes of
common life, there is great propriety
[p 180]

in it. Good ſenſe appears to differ
from taſte in this, that taſte is an inſtantaneous
deciſion of the mind, a
ſudden reliſh of what is beautiful, or
diſguſt at what is defective, in an object,
without waiting for the ſlower
confirmation of the judgment. Good
ſenſe is perhaps that confirmation,
which eſtabliſhes a ſuddenly conceived
idea, or feeling, by the powers of
comparing and reflecting. They differ
alſo in this, that taſte ſeems to have
a more immediate reference to arts,
to literature, and to almoſt every object
of the ſenſes; while good ſenſe
riſes to moral excellence, and exerts
its influence on life and manners. Taſte
is fitted to the perception and enjoyment
of whatever is beautiful in art
or nature: Good ſenſe, to the improvement
of the conduct, and the regulation
of the heart.
[p 181]

Yet
the term good ſenſe, is uſed indiſcriminately
to expreſs either a finiſhed
taſte for letters, or an invariable
prudence in the affairs of life. It is
ſometimes applied to the moſt moderate
abilities, in which caſe, the expreſſion
is certainly too ſtrong; and at
others to the moſt ſhining, when it is
as much too weak and inadequate. A
ſenſible man is the uſual, but unappropriated
phraſe, for every degree in the
ſcale of underſtanding, from the ſober
mortal, who obtains it by his decent
demeanor and ſolid dullneſs, to him
whoſe talents qualify him to rank with
a Bacon, a Harris, or a Johnson.

Genius
is the power of invention
and imitation. It is an incommunicable
faculty: no art or ſkill of the
poſſeſſor can beſtow the ſmalleſt portion
of it on another: no pains or la
[p 182]
bour
can reach the ſummit of perfection,
where the ſeeds of it are wanting
in the mind; yet it is capable of
infinite improvement where it actually
exiſts, and is attended with the higheſt
capacity of communicating inſtruction,
as well as delight to others.

It
is the peculiar property of genius
to ſtrike out great or beautiful things:
it is the felicity of good ſenſe not to do
abſurd ones. Genius breaks out in
ſplendid ſentiments and elevated ideas;
good ſenſe confines its more circumſcribed,
but perhaps more uſeful walk,
within the limits of prudence and propriety.

The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling,

Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;

And, as imagination bodies forth

The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen

[p 183]
Turns them to ſhape, and gives to airy nothing

A local habitation and a name.

This
is perhaps the fineſt picture of
human genius that ever was drawn by
a human pencil. It preſents a living
image of a creative imagination, or a
power of inventing things which have
no actual exiſtence.

With
ſuperficial judges, who, it
muſt be confeſſed, make up the greater
part of the maſs of mankind, talents
are only liked or underſtood to a certain
degree. Lofty ideas are above
the reach of ordinary apprehenſions:
the vulgar allow thoſe who poſſeſs them
to be in a ſomewhat higher ſtate of
mind than themſelves; but of the vaſt
gulf which ſeparates them, they have
not the leaſt conception. They acknowledge
a ſuperiority, but of its
extent they neither know the value,
[p 184]

nor can conceive the reality. It is
true, the mind, as well as the eye,
can take in objects larger than itſelf;
but this is only true of great minds:
for a man of low capacity, who conſiders
a conſummate genius, reſembles
one, who ſeeing a column for the firſt
time, and ſtanding at too great a diſtance
to take in the whole of it, concludes
it to be flat. Or, like one
unacquainted with the firſt principles
of philoſophy, who, finding the ſenſible
horizon appear a plain ſurface,
can form no idea of the ſpherical form
of the whole, which he does not ſee,
and laughs at the account of antipodes,
which he cannot comprehend.

Whatever
is excellent is alſo rare;
what is uſeful is more common. How
many thouſands are born qualified for
the coarſe employments of life, for
[p 185]

one who is capable of excelling in the
fine arts! yet ſo it ought to be, becauſe
our natural wants are more numerous,
and more importunate, than
the intellectual.

Whenever
it happens that a man
of diſtinguiſhed talents has been drawn
by miſtake, or precipitated by paſſion,
into any dangerous indiſcretion; it is
common for thoſe whoſe coldneſs of
temper has ſupplied the place, and
uſurped the name of prudence, to
boaſt of their own ſteadier virtue, and
triumph in their own ſuperior caution;
only becauſe they have never been aſſailed
by a temptation ſtrong enough
to ſurpriſe them into error. And with
what a viſible appropriation of the character
to themſelves, do they conſtantly
conclude, with a cordial compliment
to
common ſense
! They point out the
[p 186]

beauty and uſefulneſs of this quality
ſo forcibly and explicitly, that you
cannot poſſibly miſtake whoſe picture
they are drawing with ſo flattering a
pencil. The unhappy man whoſe conduct
has been ſo feelingly arraigned,
perhaps acted from good, though miſtaken
motives; at leaſt, from motives
of which his cenſurer has not capacity
to judge: but the event was unfavourable,
nay the action might be really
wrong, and the vulgar maliciouſly take
the opportunity of this ſingle indiſcretion,
to lift themſelves nearer on a
level with a character, which, except
in this inſtance, has always thrown
them at the moſt diſgraceful and mortifying
diſtance.

The
elegant Biographer of Collins,
in his affecting apology for that unfortunate
genius, remarks, "That the
[p 187]

gifts of imagination bring the heavieſt
taſk on the vigilance of reaſon; and
to bear thoſe faculties with unerring
rectitude, or invariable propriety,
requires a degree of firmneſs, and of
cool attention, which does not always
attend the higher gifts of the
mind; yet difficult as Nature herſelf
ſeems to have rendered the taſk of
regularity to genius, it is the ſupreme
conſolation of dullneſs, and
of folly to point with gothic triumph
to thoſe exceſſes which are the
overflowing of faculties they never
enjoyed."

What
the greater part of the world
mean by common ſenſe, will be generally
found, on a cloſer enquiry, to be
art, fraud, or ſelfiſhneſs! That ſort of
ſaving prudence which makes men extremely
attentive to their own ſafety,
[p 188]

or profit; diligent in the purſuit of
their own pleaſures or intereſts; and
perfectly at their eaſe as to what becomes
of the reſt of mankind. Furies,
where their own property is concerned,
philoſophers when nothing but the
good of others is at ſtake, and perfectly
reſigned under all calamities but
their own.

When
we ſee ſo many accompliſhed
wits of the preſent age, as remarkable
for the decorum of their lives, as for
the brilliancy of their writings, we may
believe, that, next to principle, it is
owing to their
good ſenſe
, which regulates
and chaſtiſes their imaginations.
The vaſt conceptions which enable a
true genius to aſcend the ſublimeſt
heights, may be ſo connected with the
ſtronger paſſions, as to give it a natural
tendency to fly off from the ſtrait
[p 189]

line of regularity; till good ſenſe, acting
on the fancy, makes it gravitate
powerfully towards that virtue which
is its proper centre.

Add
to this, when it is conſidered
with what imperfection the Divine
Wiſdom has thought fit to ſtamp every
thing human, it will be found, that
excellence and infirmity are ſo inſeparably
wound up in each other, that a
man derives the ſoreneſs of temper,
and irritability of nerve, which make
him uneaſy to others, and unhappy in
himſelf, from thoſe exquiſite feelings,
and that elevated pitch of thought, by
which, as the apoſtle expreſſes it on a
more ſerious occaſion, he is, as it were,
out of the body.

It is not aſtoniſhing, therefore, when

the
ſpirit is carried away by the magnificence
of its own ideas,
[p 190]

Not touch'd but rapt, not waken'd but inſpir'd,

that the frail body, which is the natural
victim of pain, diſeaſe, and death,
ſhould not always be able to follow
the mind in its aſpiring flights, but
ſhould be as imperfect as if it belonged
only to an ordinary ſoul.

Besides
, might not Providence intend
to humble human pride, by preſenting
to our eyes ſo mortifying a view of the
weakneſs and infirmity of even his beſt
work? Perhaps man, who is already
but a little lower than the angels,
might, like the revolted ſpirits, totally
have ſhaken off obedience and ſubmiſſion
to his Creator, had not God
wiſely tempered human excellence with
a certain conſciouſneſs of its own imperfection.
But though this inevitable
alloy of weakneſs may frequently be
[p 191]

found in the beſt characters, yet how
can that be the ſource of triumph and
exaltation to any, which, if properly
weighed, muſt be the deepeſt motive
of humiliation to all? A good-natured
man will be ſo far from rejoicing, that
he will be ſecretly troubled, whenever he
reads that the greateſt Roman moraliſt
was tainted with avarice, and the
greateſt Britiſh philoſopher with venality.

It
is remarked by Pope, in his Eſſay
on Criticiſm, that,

Ten cenſure wrong for one who writes amiſs.

But I apprehend it does not therefore
follow that to judge, is more difficult
than to write. If this were the caſe,
the critic would be ſuperior to the
poet, whereas it appears to be directly
[p 192]

the contrary. "The critic, (ſays the
great champion of Shakeſpeare,) but
faſhions the body of a work, the poet
muſt add the ſoul, which gives force
and direction to its actions and geſtures."
It ſhould ſeem that the reaſon why ſo
many more judge wrong, than write
ill, is becauſe the number of readers
is beyond all proportion greater than
the number of writers. Every man
who reads, is in ſome meaſure a critic,
and, with very common abilities, may
point out real faults and material errors
in a very well written book; but
it by no means follows that he is able
to write any thing comparable to the
work which he is capable of cenſuring.
And unleſs the numbers of thoſe who
write, and of thoſe who judge, were
more equal, the calculation ſeems not
to be quite fair.
[p 193]

A capacity
for reliſhing works of
genius is the indubitable ſign of a good
taſte. But if a proper diſpoſition and
ability to enjoy the compoſitions of
others, entitle a man to the claim of
reputation, it is ſtill a far inferior degree
of merit to his who can invent and
produce thoſe compoſitions, the bare
diſquiſition of which gives the critic
no ſmall ſhare of fame.

The
preſident of the royal academy
in his admirable
Diſcourſe
on
imitation
,
has ſet the folly of depending on unaſſiſted
genius, in the cleareſt light; and
has ſhewn the neceſſity of adding the
knowledge of others, to our own native
powers, in his uſual ſtriking and maſterly
manner. "The mind, ſays he, is a
barren ſoil, is a ſoil ſoon exhauſted,
and will produce no crop, or only
one, unleſs it be continually fertiliz
[p 194]
ed,
and enriched with foreign matter."

Yet
it has been objected that ſtudy
is a great enemy to originality; but
even if this were true, it would perhaps
be as well that an author ſhould
give us the ideas of ſtill better writers,
mixed and aſſimilated with the matter
in his own mind, as thoſe crude and
undigeſted thoughts which he values
under the notion that they are original.
The ſweeteſt honey neither taſtes of the
roſe, the honeyſuckle, nor the carnation,
yet it is compounded of the very
eſſence of them all.

If
in the other fine arts this accumulation
of knowledge is neceſſary,
it is indiſpenſably ſo in poetry. It is a
fatal raſhneſs for any one to truſt too
much to their own ſtock of ideas.
[p 195]

He muſt invigorate them by exerciſe,
poliſh them by converſation, and increaſe
them by every ſpecies of elegant
and virtuous knowledge, and the mind
will not fail to reproduce with intereſt
thoſe ſeeds, which are ſown in it by
ſtudy and obſervation. Above all,
let every one guard againſt the dangerous
opinion that he knows enough:
an opinion that will weaken the energy
and reduce the powers of the mind,
which, though once perhaps vigorous
and effectual, will be ſunk to a ſtate
of literary imbecility, by cheriſhing
vain and preſumptuous ideas of its
own independence.

For
inſtance, it may not be neceſſary
that a poet ſhould be deeply ſkilled in
the Linnæan ſyſtem; but it muſt be
allowed that a general acquaintance
with plants and flowers will furniſh
[p 196]

him with a delightful and profitable ſpecies
of inſtruction. He is not obliged to
trace Nature in all her nice and varied
operations, with the minute accuracy
of a Boyle, or the laborious inveſtigation
of a Newton; but his
good ſenſe

will point out to him that no inconſiderable
portion of philoſophical knowledge
is requiſite to the completion of
his literary character. The ſciences
are more independent, and require
little or no aſſiſtance from the graces
of poetry; but poetry, if ſhe would
charm and inſtruct, muſt not be ſo
haughty; ſhe muſt be contented to
borrow of the ſciences, many of her
choiceſt alluſions, and many of her
moſt graceful embelliſhments; and does
it not magnify the character of true
poeſy, that ſhe includes within herſelf
all the ſcattered graces of every ſeparate
art?
[p 197]

The
rules of the great maſters in
criticiſm may not be ſo neceſſary to
the forming a good taſte, as the examination
of thoſe original mines
from whence they drew their treaſures
of knowledge.

The
three celebrated Eſſays on the
Art of Poetry do not teach ſo much
by their laws as by their examples;
the dead letter of their rules is leſs inſtructive
than the living ſpirit of their
verſe. Yet theſe rules are to a young
poet, what the ſtudy of logarithms is
to a young mathematician; they do
not ſo much contribute to form his
judgment, as afford him the ſatiſfaction
of convincing him that he is right.
They do not preclude the difficulty of
the operation; but at the concluſion of
it, furniſh him with a fuller demonſtration
that he has proceeded on pro
[p 198]
per
principles. When he has well
ſtudied the maſters in whoſe ſchools
the firſt critics formed themſelves, and
fancies he has caught a ſpark of their
divine Flame, it may be a good method
to try his own compoſitions by
the teſt of the critic rules, ſo far indeed
as the mechaniſm of poetry goes.
If the examination be fair and candid,
this trial, like the touch of Ithuriel's
ſpear, will detect every latent error, and
bring to light every favourite failing.

Good
taſte always ſuits the meaſure
of its admiration to the merit of the
compoſition it examines. It accommodates
its praiſes, or its cenſure, to
the excellence of a work, and appropriates
it to the nature of it. General
applauſe, or indiſcriminate abuſe, is
the ſign of a vulgar underſtanding.
There are certain blemiſhes which the
[p 199]

judicious and good-natured reader will
candidly overlook. But the falſe ſublime,
the tumour which is intended
for greatneſs, the diſtorted figure, the
puerile conceit, and the incongruous
metaphor, theſe are defects for which
ſcarcely any other kind of merit can
atone. And yet there may be more
hope of a writer (eſpecially if he be a
a young one), who is now and then
guilty of ſome of theſe faults, than of
one who avoids them all, not through
judgment, but feebleneſs, and who,
inſtead of deviating into error is continually
falling ſhort of excellence.
The meer abſence of error implies that
moderate and inferior degree of merit
with which a cold heart and a phlegmatic
taſte will be better ſatiſfied than
with the magnificent irregularities of
exalted ſpirits. It ſtretches ſome minds
to an uneaſy extenſion to be obliged
[p 200]

to attend to compoſitions ſuperlatively
excellent; and it contracts liberal ſouls
to a painful narrowneſs to deſcend to
books of inferior merit. A work of
capital genius, to a man of an ordinary
mind, is the bed of Procruſtes to one
of a ſhort ſtature, the man is too little
to fill up the ſpace aſſigned him, and
undergoes the torture in attempting
it: and a moderate, or low production
to a man of bright talents, is the puniſhment
inflicted by Mezentius; the
living ſpirit has too much animation to
endure patiently to be in contact with
a dead body.

Taste
seſms to be a ſentiment of
the ſoul which gives the bias to opinion,
for we feel before we reflect. Without
this ſentiment, all knowledge, learning
and opinion, would be cold, inert
materials, whereas they become active
[p 201]

principles when ſtirred, kindled, and
inflamed by this animating quality.

There
is another feeling which is
called Enthuſiaſm. The enthuſiaſm
of ſenſible hearts is ſo ſtrong, that it
not only yields to the impulſe with
which ſtriking objects act on it, but
ſuch hearts help on the effect by their
own ſenſibility. In a ſcene where
Shakeſpeare and Garrick give perfection
to each other, the feeling heart
does not merely accede to the delirium
they occaſion: it does more, it is enamoured
of it, it ſolicits the deluſion,
it ſues to be deceived, and grudgingly
cheriſhes the ſacred treaſure of its feelings.
The poet and performer concur
in carrying us

Beyond this viſible diurnal ſphere,

they bear us aloft in their airy
courſe with unreſiſted rapidity, if
they meet not with any obſtruction
[p 202]

from the coldneſs of our own feelings.
Perhaps, only a few fine ſpirits can
enter into the detail of their writing
and acting; but the multitude do not
enjoy leſs acutely, becauſe they are
not able philoſophically to analyſe the
ſources of their joy or ſorrow. If the
others have the advantage of judging,
theſe have at leaſt the privilege of
feeling: and it is not from complaiſance
to a few leading judges, that they
burſt into peals of laughter, or melt
into delightful agony; their hearts decide,
and that is a deciſion from which
there lies no appeal. It muſt however
be confeſſed, that the nicer ſeparations
of character, and the lighter
and almoſt imperceptible ſhades which
ſometimes diſtinguiſh them, will not
be intimately reliſhed, unleſs there be
a conſonancy of taſte as well as feeling
in the ſpectator; though where the
[p 203]

paſſions are principally concerned, the
profane vulgar come in for a larger
portion of the univerſal delight, than
critics and connoiſſeurs are willing to
allow them.

Yet
enthuſiaſm, though the natural
concomitant of genius, is no more
genius itſelf, than drunkenneſs is cheerfulneſs;
and that enthuſiaſm which
diſcovers itſelf on occaſions not worthy
to excite it, is the mark of a wretched
judgment and a falſe taſte.

Nature
produces innumerable objects:
to imitate them, is the province
of Genius; to direct thoſe imitations,
is the property of Judgment; to decide
on their effects, is the buſineſs of Taſte.
For Taſte, who ſits as ſupreme judge
on the productions of Genius, is not
ſatiſfied when ſhe merely imitates Na
[p 204]
ture:
ſhe muſt alſo, ſays an ingenious
French writer, imitate
beautiful

Nature. It requires no leſs judgment
to reject than to chooſe, and Genius
might imitate what is vulgar, under
pretence that it was natural, if Taſte
did not carefully point out thoſe objects
which are moſt proper for imitation.
It alſo requires a very nice diſcernment
to diſtinguiſh veriſimilitude
from truth; for there is a truth in
Taſte nearly as concluſive as demonſtration
in mathematics.

Genius
, when in the full impetuoſity
of its career, often touches on the
very brink of error; and is, perhaps,
never ſo near the verge of the precipice,
as when indulging its ſublimeſt
flights. It is in thoſe great, but dangerous
moments, that the curb of
vigilant judgment is moſt wanting:
[p 205]

while ſafe and ſober Dulneſs obſerves
one tedious and inſipid round of tireſome
uniformity, and ſteers equally
clear of eccentricity and of beauty.
Dulneſs has few redundancies to retrench,
few luxuriancies to prune, and
few irregularities to ſmooth. Theſe,
though errors, are the errors of Genius,
for there is rarely redundancy
without plenitude, or irregularity without
greatneſs. The exceſſes of Genius
may eaſily be retrenched, but the deficiencies
of Dulneſs can never be ſupplied.

Those
who copy from others will
doubtleſs be leſs excellent than thoſe
who copy from Nature. To imitate
imitators, is the way to depart too far
from the great original herſelf. The
latter copies of an engraving retain
fainter and fainter traces of the ſub
[p 206]
ject,
to which the earlier impreſſions
bore ſo ſtrong a reſemblance.

It
ſeems very extraordinary, that it
ſhould be the moſt difficult thing in
the world to be natural, and that it
ſhould be harder to hit off the manners
of real life, and to delineate ſuch characters
as we converſe with every day,
than to imagine ſuch as do not exiſt.
But caricature is much eaſier than an
exact outline, and the colouring of
fancy leſs difficult than that of truth.

People
do not always know what taſte
they have, till it is awakened by ſome
correſponding object; nay, genius itſelf
is a fire, which in many minds
would never blaze, if not kindled by
ſome external cauſe.

Nature
, that munificent mother,
when ſhe beſtows the power of judg
[p 207]
ing,
accompanies it with the capacity
of enjoying. The judgment, which
is clear ſighted, points out ſuch objects
as are calculated to inſpire love, and
the heart inſtantaneouſly attaches itſelf
to whatever is lovely.

In
regard to literary reputation, a
great deal depends on the ſtate of
learning in the particular age or nation,
in which an author lives. In a
dark and ignorant period, moderate
knowledge will entitle its poſſeſſor to
a conſiderable ſhare of fame; whereas,
to be diſtinguiſhed in a polite and lettered
age, requires ſtriking parts and
deep erudition.

When
a nation begins to emerge
from a ſtate of mental darkneſs, and to
ſtrike out the firſt rudiments of improvement,
it chalks out a few ſtrong
[p 208]

but incorrect ſketches, gives the rude
out-lines of general art, and leaves the
filling up to the leiſure of happier
days, and the refinement of more enlightened
times. Their drawing is a
rude
Sbozzo
, and their poetry wild
minſtrelſy.

Perfection
of taſte is a point which
a nation no ſooner reaches, than it
overſhoots; and it is more difficult to
return to it, after having paſſed it,
than it was to attain when they fell
ſhort of it. Where the arts begin to
languiſh after having flouriſhed, they
ſeldom indeed fall back to their original
barbariſm, but a certain feebleneſs
of exertion takes place, and it is more
difficult to recover them from this
dying languor to their proper ſtrength,
than it was to poliſh them from their
former rudeneſs; for it is a leſs for
[p 209]
midable
undertaking to refine barbarity,
than to ſtop decay: the firſt may
be laboured into elegance, but the
latter will rarely be ſtrengthened into
vigour.

Taste
exerts itſelf at firſt but feebly
and imperfectly: it is repreſſed and kept
back by a crowd of the moſt diſcouraging
prejudices: like an infant
prince, who, though born to reign,
yet holds an idle ſceptre, which he has
not power to uſe, but is obliged to ſee
with the eyes, and hear through the
ears of other men.

A writer
of correct taſte will hardly
ever go out of his way, even in
ſearch of embelliſhment: he will ſtudy
to attain the beſt end by the moſt natural
means; for he knows that what
is not natural cannot be beautiful, and
[p 210]

that nothing can be beautiful out of
its own place; for an improper ſituation
will convert the moſt ſtriking
beauty into a glaring defect. When
by a well-connected chain of ideas,
or a judicious ſucceſſion of events, the
reader is ſnatched to "Thebes or
Athens," what can be more impertinent
than for the poet to obſtruct the
operation of the paſſion he has juſt
been kindling, by introducing a conceit
which contradicts his purpoſe,
and interrupts his buſineſs? Indeed,
we cannot be tranſported, even in
idea, to thoſe places, if the poet does
not manage ſo adroitly as not to make
us ſenſible of the journey: the inſtant
we feel we are travelling, the writer's
art fails, and the delirium is at an end.

Proserpine
, ſays Ovid, would have
been reſtored to her mother Ceres, had
[p 211]

not Aſcalaphus ſeen her ſtop to gather
a golden apple, when the terms of her
reſtoration were, that ſhe ſhould taſte
nothing. A ſtory pregnant with inſtruction
for lively writers, who by
neglecting the main buſineſs, and going
out of the way for falſe gratifications,
loſe ſight of the end they ſhould
principally keep in view. It was this
falſe taſte that introduced the numberleſs

concetti
, which diſgrace the brighteſt
of the Italian poets; and this is the
reaſon, why the reader only feels ſhort
and interrupted ſnatches of delight in
peruſing the brilliant but unequal
compoſitions of Arioſto, inſtead of
that unbroken and undiminiſhed pleaſure,
which he conſtantly receives from
Virgil, from Milton, and generally
from Taſſo. The firſt-mentioned Italian
is the Atalanta, who will interrupt
the moſt eager career, to pick up the
[p 212]

glittering miſchief, while the Mantuan
and the Britiſh bards, like Hippomenes,
preſs on warm in the purſuit,
and unſeduced by temptation.

A writer
of real taſte will take
great pains in the perfection of his ſtyle,
to make the reader believe that he took
none at all. The writing which appears
to be moſt eaſy, will be generally
found to be leaſt imitable. The
moſt elegant verſes are the moſt eaſily
retained, they faſten themſelves on the
memory, without its making any effort
to preſerve them, and we are apt to imagine,
that what is remembered with
eaſe, was written without difficulty.

To conclude; Genius is a rare and
precious gem, of which few know
the worth; it is fitter for the cabinet
of the connoiſſeur, than for the com
[p 213]
merce
of mankind. Good ſenſe is a
bank-bill, convenient for change, negotiable
at all times, and current in
all places. It knows the value of
ſmall things, and conſiders that an
aggregate of them makes up the ſum
of human affairs. It elevates common
concerns into matters of importance,
by performing them in the beſt manner,
and at the moſt ſuitable ſeaſon.
Good ſenſe carries with it the idea of
equality, while Genius is always ſuſpected
of a deſign to impoſe the burden
of ſuperiority; and reſpect is paid to
it with that reluctance which always
attends other impoſts, the lower orders
of mankind generally repining
moſt at demands, by which they are
leaſt liable to be affected.

As
it is the character of Genius to
penetrate with a lynx's beam into
[p 214]

unfathomable abyſſes and uncreated
worlds, and to ſee what is
not
, ſo it
is the property of good ſenſe to diſtinguiſh
perfectly, and judge accurately
what really
is
. Good ſenſe has not ſo
piercing an eye, but it has as clear a
ſight: it does not penetrate ſo deeply,
but as far as it
does
ſee, it diſcerns
diſtinctly. Good ſenſe is a judicious
mechanic, who can produce beauty
and convenience out of ſuitable means;
but Genius (I ſpeak with reverence of
the immeaſurable diſtance) bears ſome
remote reſemblance to the divine architect,
who produced perfection of
beauty without any viſible materials,

who ſpake, and it was created
; who
ſaid,
Let it be, and it was
.

The
Author begs leave to offer an apology for
introducing this Eſſay, which, ſhe fears, may be thought
foreign to her purpoſe. But ſhe hopes that her earneſt
deſire of exciting a taſte for literature in young ladies,
(which encouraged her to hazard the following remarks)
will not
obstruct
her general deſign, even if it does
not actually
promote
it.

to

Mrs
. MONTAGU.

MADAM,

If
you were only one of the finest
writers of your time, you would
probably have escaped the trouble of
this address, which is drawn on you,
less by the lustre of your understanding,
than by the amiable qualities of your
heart.

As
the following pages are written
with an humble but earnest wish, to
promote the interests of virtue, as far
as the very limited abilities of the author
allow; there is, I flatter myself,
a peculiar propriety in inscribing them
to you, Madam, who, while your
works convey instruction and delight
to the best-informed of the other sex,
furnish, by your conduct, an admirable
pattern of life and manners to
your own. And I can with truth remark,
that those graces of conversation,
which would be the first praise of almost
any other character, constitute
but an inferior part of yours.

I am,
Madam
,

With the highest esteem,

Your most obedient

Humble Servant,

INTRODUCTION.

It
is with the utmost diffidence
that the following pages are submitted
to the inspection of the
Public: yet, however the limited abilities
of the author may have prevented
her from succeeding to her wish in the
execution of her present attempt, she
humbly trusts that the uprightness of
her intention will procure it a candid
and favourable reception. The following
little Essays are chiefly calculated
for the younger part of her own
[p 2]

sex, who, she flatters herself, will not
esteem them the less, because they were
written immediately for their service.
She by no means pretends to have
composed a regular system of morals,
or a finished plan of conduct: she has
only endeavoured to make a few remarks
on such circumstances as seemed
to her susceptible of some improvement,
and on such subjects as she imagined
were particularly interesting to
young ladies, on their first introduction
into the world. She hopes they
will not be offended if she has occasionally
pointed out certain qualities,
and suggested certain tempers, and
dispositions, as
peculiarly feminine
, and
hazarded some observations which naturally
arose from the subject, on the
different characters which mark the
sexes. And here again she takes the
liberty to repeat that these distinctions
[p 3]

cannot be too nicely maintained; for
besides those important qualities common
to both, each sex has its respective,
appropriated qualifications, which
would cease to be meritorious, the instant
they ceased to be appropriated.
Nature, propriety, and custom have
prescribed certain bounds to each;
bounds which the prudent and the
candid will never attempt to break
down; and indeed it would be highly
impolitic to annihilate distinctions from
which each acquires excellence, and
to attempt innovations, by which both
would be losers.

Women
therefore never understand
their own interests so little, as when
they affect those qualities and accomplishments,
from the want of which
they derive their highest merit. "The

porcelain
clay of human kind," says
[p 4]

an admired writer, speaking of the sex.
Greater delicacy evidently implies
greater fragility; and this weakness, natural
and moral, clearly points out the
necessity of a superior degree of caution,
retirement, and reserve.

If
the author may be allowed to
keep up the allusion of the poet, just
quoted, she would ask if we do not
put the finest vases, and the costliest
images in places of the greatest security,
and most remote from any probability
of accident, or destruction?
By being so situated, they find their
protection in their weakness, and their
safety in their delicacy. This metaphor
is far from being used with a design
of placing young ladies in a trivial,
unimportant light; it is only
introduced to insinuate, that where
there is more beauty, and more weak
[p 5]
ness,
there should be greater circumspection,
and superior prudence.

Men
, on the contrary, are formed
for the more public exhibitions on the
great theatre of human life. Like the
stronger and more substantial wares,
they derive no injury, and lose no
polish by being always exposed, and
engaged in the constant commerce of
the world. It is their proper element,
where they respire their natural air,
and exert their noblest powers, in
situations which call them into action.
They were intended by Providence for
the bustling scenes of life; to appear
terrible in arms, useful in commerce,
shining in counsels.

The
Author fears it will be hazarding
a very bold remark, in the opinion
of many ladies, when she adds,
[p 6]

that the female mind, in general, does
not appear capable of attaining so
high a degree of perfection in science
as the male. Yet she hopes to be forgiven
when she observes also, that as
it does not seem to derive the chief
portion of its excellence from extraordinary
abilities of this kind, it is
not at all lessened by the imputation of
not possessing them. It is readily allowed,
that the sex have lively imaginations,
and those exquisite perceptions
of the beautiful and defective,
which come under the denomination of
Taste. But pretensions to that strength
of intellect, which is requisite to penetrate
into the abstruser walks of literature,
it is presumed they will readily
relinquish. There are green pastures,
and pleasant vallies, where they
may wander with safety to themselves,
and delight to others. They may cul
[p 7]
tivate
the roses of imagination, and the
valuable fruits of morals and criticism;
but the steeps of Parnassus few,
comparatively, have attempted to scale
with success. And when it is considered,
that many languages, and many
sciences, must contribute to the perfection
of poetical composition, it will
appear less strange. The lofty Epic,
the pointed Satire, and the more daring
and successful flights of the Tragic
Muse, seem reserved for the bold adventurers
of the other sex.

Nor
does this assertion, it is apprehended,
at all injure the interests of
the women; they have other pretensions,
on which to value themselves,
and other qualities much better calculated
to answer their particular purposes.
We are enamoured of the soft
strains of the Sicilian and the Mantuan
[p 8]

Muse, while, to the sweet notes of the
pastoral reed, they sing the Contentions
of the Shepherds, the Blessings of
Love, or the innocent Delights of rural
Life. Has it ever been ascribed to
them as a defect, that their Eclogues
do not treat of active scenes, of busy
cities, and of wasting war? No:
their simplicity is their perfection, and
they are only blamed when they have
too little of it.

On
the other hand, the lofty bards
who strung their bolder harps to higher
measures, and sung the
Wrath
of
Peleus'
Son
, and
Man's first Disobedience
,
have never been censured for want
of sweetness and refinement. The sublime,
the nervous, and the masculine,
characterise their compositions; as the
beautiful, the soft, and the delicate,
mark those of the others. Grandeur,
[p 9]

dignity, and force, distinguish the one
species; ease, simplicity, and purity,
the other. Both shine from their native,
distinct, unborrowed merits, not
from those which are foreign, adventitious,
and unnatural. Yet those excellencies,
which make up the essential
and constituent parts of poetry, they
have in common.

Women
have generally quicker perceptions;
men have juster sentiments.—Women
consider how things may
be prettily said; men how they may
be properly said.—In women, (young
ones at least) speaking accompanies,
and sometimes precedes reflection; in
men, reflection is the antecedent.—Women
speak to shine or to please;
men, to convince or confute.—Women
admire what is brilliant; men
what is solid.—Women prefer an ex
[p 10]
temporaneous
sally of wit, or a sparkling
effusion of fancy, before the most
accurate reasoning, or the most laborious
investigation of facts. In literary
composition, women are pleased
with point, turn, and antithesis; men
with observation, and a just deduction
of effects from their causes.—Women
are fond of incident, men of
argument.—Women admire passionately,
men approve cautiously.—One sex
will think it betrays a want of feeling
to be moderate in their applause,
the other will be afraid of exposing a
want of judgment by being in raptures
with any thing.—Men refuse to
give way to the emotions they actually
feel, while women sometimes affect
to be transported beyond what
the occasion will justify.
[p 11]

As
a farther confirmation of what
has been advanced on the different
bent of the understanding in the
sexes, it may be observed, that we
have heard of many female wits, but
never of one female logician—of many
admirable writers of memoirs, but never
of one chronologer.—In the boundless
and aërial regions of romance, and
in that fashionable species of composition
which succeeded it, and which
carries a nearer approximation to the
manners of the world, the women
cannot be excelled: this imaginary
soil they have a peculiar talent for cultivating,
because here,

Invention labours more, and judgment less.

The
merit of this kind of writing
consists in the
vraisemblance
to real
life as to the events themselves, with
[p 12]

a certain elevation in the narrative,
which places them, if not above what
is natural, yet above what is common.
It farther consists in the art of interesting
the tender feelings by a pathetic
representation of those minute, endearing,
domestic circumstances, which
take captive the soul before it has
time to shield itself with the armour
of reflection. To amuse, rather than
to instruct, or to instruct indirectly by
short inferences, drawn from a long
concatenation of circumstances, is at
once the business of this sort of composition,
and one of the characteristics
of female genius
[1]
.
[p 13]

In
short, it appears that the mind
in each sex has some natural kind of
bias, which constitutes a distinction of
character, and that the happiness of
both depends, in a great measure, on
the preservation and observance of
this distinction. For where would be
the superior pleasure and satisfaction
resulting from mixed conversation, if
this difference were abolished? If the
qualities of both were invariably and
exactly the same, no benefit or entertainment
would arise from the tedious
and insipid uniformity of such an intercourse;
whereas considerable advantages
are reaped from a select society
of both sexes. The rough angles
and asperities of male manners
are imperceptibly filed, and gradually
worn smooth, by the polishing of female
conversation, and the refining of
female taste; while the ideas of wo
[p 14]
men
acquire strength and solidity, by
their associating with sensible, intelligent,
and judicious men.

On
the whole, (even if fame be the
object of pursuit) is it not better to
succeed as women, than to fail as men?
To shine, by walking honourably in
the road which nature, custom, and
education seem to have marked out,
rather than to counteract them all, by
moving awkwardly in a path diametrically
opposite? To be good originals,
rather than bad imitators? In a
word, to be excellent women, rather
than indifferent men?

[p 15]

[1]

The
author does not apprehend it makes against
her
general
position, that this nation can boast a
female critic, poet, historian, linguist, philosopher,
and moralist, equal to most of the other sex. To these
particular instances others might be adduced; but it
is presumed, that they only stand as exceptions against
the rule, without tending to invalidate the rule itself.

ON

DISSIPATION.

DOGLIE CERTE, ALLEGREZZE INCERTE!

PETRARCA.

As
an argument in favour of modern
manners, it has been pleaded,
that the softer vices of Luxury
and Dissipation, belong rather to gentle
and yielding tempers, than to
such as are rugged and ferocious: that
they are vices which increase civili
[p 16]
zation,
and tend to promote refinement,
and the cultivation of humanity.

But
this is an assertion, the truth
of which the experience of all ages
contradicts. Nero was not less a tyrant
for being a fiddler: He
[2]
who
wished the whole Roman people had
but one neck, that he might dispatch
them at a blow, was himself the most
debauched man in Rome; and Sydney
and Russel were condemned to bleed
under the most barbarous, though most
dissipated and voluptuous, reign that
ever disgraced the annals of Britain.

The
love of dissipation is, I believe,
allowed to be the reigning evil of the
present day. It is an evil which many
[p 17]

content themselves with regretting,
without seeking to redress. A dissipated
life is censured in the very act
of dissipation, and prodigality of time
is as gravely declaimed against at the
card table, as in the pulpit.

The
lover of dancing censures the
amusements of the theatre for their
dulness, and the gamester blames them
both for their levity. She, whose whole
soul is swallowed up in "
opera extacies
"
is astonished, that her acquaintance
can spend whole nights in preying,
like harpies, on the fortunes of
their fellow-creatures; while the grave
sober sinner, who passes her pale and
anxious vigils, in this fashionable sort
of pillaging, is no less surprised how
the other can waste her precious time
in hearing sounds for which she has
[p 18]

no taste, in a language she does not
understand.

In
short, every one seems convinced,
that the evil so much complained of
does really exist somewhere, though all
are inwardly persuaded that it is not
with themselves. All desire a general
reformation, but few will listen to proposals
of particular amendment; the
body must be restored, but each limb
begs to remain as it is; and accusations
which concern all, will be likely to affect
none. They think that sin, like
matter, is divisible, and that what is
scattered among so many, cannot materially
affect any one; and thus individuals
contribute separately to that
evil which they in general lament.

The
prevailing manners of an age
depend more than we are aware, or
[p 19]

are willing to allow, on the conduct
of the women; this is one of the principal
hinges on which the great machine
of human society turns. Those
who allow the influence which female
graces have, in contributing to polish
the manners of men, would do well
to reflect how great an influence female
morals must also have on their
conduct. How much then is it to be
regretted, that the British ladies should
ever sit down contented to polish, when
they are able to reform, to entertain,
when they might instruct, and to dazzle
for an hour, when they are candidates
for eternity!

Under
the dispensation of Mahomet's
law, indeed, these mental excellencies
cannot be expected, because
the women are shut out from all opportunities
of instruction, and excluded
[p 20]

from the endearing pleasures of a delightful
and equal society; and, as
a charming poet sings, are taught to
believe, that

For their inferior natures

Form'd to delight, and happy by delighting,

Heav'n has reserv'd no future paradise,

But bids them rove the paths of bliss, secure

Of total death, and careless of hereafter.

Irene
.

These
act consistently in studying
none but exterior graces, in cultivating
only personal attractions, and in
trying to lighten the intolerable burden
of time, by the most frivolous
and vain amusements. They act in
consequence of their own blind belief,
and the tyranny of their despotic
masters; for they have neither the freedom
of a present choice, nor the prospect
of a future being.
[p 21]

But
in this land of civil and religious
liberty, where there is as little
despotism exercised over the minds,
as over the persons of women, they
have every liberty of choice, and every
opportunity of improvement; and how
greatly does this increase their obligation
to be exemplary in their general
conduct, attentive to the government
of their families, and instrumental
to the good order of society!

She
who is at a loss to find amusements
at home, can no longer apologize
for her dissipation abroad, by
saying she is deprived of the benefit
and the pleasure of books; and she
who regrets being doomed to a state
of dark and gloomy ignorance, by the
injustice, or tyranny of the men, complains
of an evil which does not
exist.
[p 22]

It
is a question frequently in the
mouths of illiterate and dissipated females—"What
good is there in reading?
To what end does it conduce?"
It is, however, too obvious to need insisting
on, that unless perverted, as
the best things may be, reading answers
many excellent purposes beside
the great leading one, and is perhaps
the safest remedy for dissipation. She
who dedicates a portion of her leisure
to useful reading, feels her mind in a
constant progressive state of improvement,
whilst the mind of a dissipated
woman is continually losing ground.
An active spirit rejoiceth, like the sun,
to run his daily course, while indolence,
like the dial of Ahaz, goes
backwards. The advantages which
the understanding receives from polite
literature, it is not here necessary to
enumerate; its effects on the moral
[p 23]

temper is the present object of consideration.
The remark may perhaps be
thought too strong, but I believe it
is true, that next to religious influences,
an habit of study is the most
probable preservative of the virtue of
young persons. Those who cultivate
letters have rarely a strong passion for
promiscuous visiting, or dissipated society;
study therefore induces a relish
for domestic life, the most desirable
temper in the world for women. Study,
as it rescues the mind from an
inordinate fondness for gaming, dress,
and public amusements, is an [oe]conomical
propensity; for a lady may
read at much less expence than she can
play at cards; as it requires some application,
it gives the mind an habit
of industry; as it is a relief against
that mental disease, which the French
emphatically call
ennui
, it cannot fail
[p 24]

of being beneficial to the temper and
spirits, I mean in the moderate degree
in which ladies are supposed to use it;
as an enemy to indolence, it becomes a
social virtue; as it demands the full
exertion of our talents, it grows a rational
duty; and when directed to the
knowledge of the Supreme Being, and
his laws, it rises into an act of religion.

The
rage for reformation commonly
shews itself in a violent zeal for suppressing
what is wrong, rather than in
a prudent attention to establish what is
right; but we shall never obtain a fair
garden merely by rooting up weeds,
we must also plant flowers; for the
natural richness of the soil we have
been clearing will not suffer it to lie
barren, but whether it shall be vainly
or beneficially prolific, depends on the
[p 25]

culture. What the present age has
gained on one side, by a more enlarged
and liberal way of thinking, seems to
be lost on the other, by excessive freedom
and unbounded indulgence. Knowledge
is not, as heretofore, confined
to the dull cloyster, or the gloomy
college, but disseminated, to a certain
degree, among both sexes and
almost all ranks. The only misfortune
is, that these opportunities do
not seem to be so wisely improved, or
turned to so good an account as might
be wished. Books of a pernicious,
idle, and frivolous sort, are too much
multiplied, and it is from the very
redundancy of them that true knowledge
is so scarce, and the habit of
dissipation so much increased.

It
has been remarked, that the prevailing
character of the present age is
[p 26]

not that of gross immorality: but if
this is meant of those in the higher
walks of life, it is easy to discern,
that there can be but little merit in
abstaining from crimes which there is
but little temptation to commit. It
is however to be feared, that a gradual
defection from piety, will in
time draw after it all the bad consequences
of more active vice; for whether
mounds and fences are suddenly
destroyed by a sweeping torrent, or
worn away through gradual neglect,
the effect is equally destructive. As
a rapid fever and a consuming hectic
are alike fatal to our natural health, so
are flagrant immorality and torpid indolence
to our moral well-being.

The
philosophical doctrine of the
slow recession of bodies from the sun,
is a lively image of the reluctance with
[p 27]

which we first abandon the light of
virtue. The beginning of folly, and
the first entrance on a dissipated life
cost some pangs to a well-disposed
heart; but it is surprising to see how
soon the progress ceases to be impeded
by reflection, or slackened by remorse.
For it is in moral as in natural things,
the motion in minds as well as bodies
is accelerated by a nearer approach to
the centre to which they are tending.
If we recede slowly at first setting out,
we advance rapidly in our future
course; and to have begun to be
wrong, is already to have made a great
progress.

A constant
habit of amusement
relaxes the tone of the mind, and renders
it totally incapable of application,
study, or virtue. Dissipation not only
indisposes its votaries to every thing
[p 28]

useful and excellent, but disqualifies
them for the enjoyment of pleasure itself.
It softens the soul so much, that
the most superficial employment becomes
a labour, and the slightest inconvenience
an agony. The luxurious
Sybarite must have lost all sense of
real enjoyment, and all relish for true
gratification, before he complained
that he could not sleep, because the
rose leaves lay double under him.

Luxury
and dissipation, soft and
gentle as their approaches are, and
silently as they throw their silken
chains about the heart, enslave it more
than the most active and turbulent vices.
The mightiest conquerors have been
conquered by these unarmed foes: the
flowery setters are fastened, before they
are felt. The blandishments of Circe
were more fatal to the mariners of
[p 29]

Ulysses, than the strength of Polypheme,
or the brutality of the Læstrigons.
Hercules, after he had
cleansed the Augean stable, and performed
all the other labours enjoined
him by Euristheus, found himself a
slave to the softnesses of the heart;
and he, who wore a club and a lion's
skin in the cause of virtue, condescended
to the most effeminate employments
to gratify a criminal weakness.
Hannibal, who vanquished mighty
nations, was himself overcome by the
love of pleasure; and he who despised
cold, and want, and danger, and death
on the Alps, was conquered and undone
by the dissolute indulgences of
Capua.

Before
the hero of the most beautiful
and virtuous romance that ever
was written, I mean Telemachus,
[p 30]

landed on the island of Cyprus, he unfortunately
lost his prudent companion,
Mentor, in whom wisdom is so
finely personified. At first he beheld
with horror the wanton and dissolute
manners of the voluptuous inhabitants;
the ill effects of their example were
not immediate: he did not fall into
the commission of glaring enormities;
but his virtue was secretly and imperceptibly
undermined, his heart was
softened by their pernicious society;
and the nerve of resolution was slackened:
he every day beheld with diminished
indignation the worship which
was offered to Venus; the disorders of
luxury and prophaneness became less
and less terrible, and the infectious
air of the country enfeebled his courage,
and relaxed his principles. In
short, he had ceased to love virtue
long before he thought of committing
[p 31]

actual vice; and the duties of a manly
piety were burdensome to him, before
he was so debased as to offer perfumes,
and burn incense on the altar of the
licentious goddess
[3]
.

"
Let
us crown ourselves with rosebuds
before they be withered," said
Solomon's libertine. Alas! he did not
reflect that they withered in the very
gathering. The roses of pleasure seldom
last long enough to adorn the brow
[p 32]

of him who plucks them; for they are
the only roses which do not retain their
sweetness after they have lost their
beauty.

The
heathen poets often pressed on
their readers the necessity of considering
the shortness of life, as an incentive
to pleasure and voluptuousness;
lest the season for indulging in them
should pass unimproved. The dark
and uncertain notions, not to say the
absolute disbelief, which they entertained
of a future state, is the only
apology that can be offered for this
reasoning. But while we censure their
tenets, let us not adopt their errors;
errors which would be infinitely more
inexcusable in us, who, from the
clearer views which revelation has
given us, shall not have their ignorance
or their doubts to plead. It
[p 33]

were well if we availed ourselves of
that portion of their precept, which
inculcates the improvement of every
moment of our time, but not like them
to dedicate the moments so redeemed
to the pursuit of sensual and perishable
pleasures, but to the securing of those
which are spiritual in their nature, and
eternal in their duration.

If
, indeed, like the miserable
[4]
beings
imagined by Swift, with a view to
cure us of the irrational desire after
immoderate length of days, we were
condemned to a wretched earthly immortality,
we should have an excuse
for spending some portion of our time
in dissipation, as we might then pretend,
with some colour of reason, that
we proposed, at a distant period, to
[p 34]

enter on a better course of action. Or
if we never formed any such resolution,
it would make no material difference
to beings, whose state was already unalterably
fixed. But of the scanty
portion of days assigned to our lot, not
one should be lost in weak and irresolute
procrastination.

Those
who have not yet determined
on the side of vanity, who, like Hercules,
(before he knew the queen of
Lydia, and had learnt to spin) have
not resolved on their choice between

virtue
and
pleasure
, may reflect,
that it is still in their power to imitate
that hero in his noble choice, and in
his virtuous rejection. They may also
reflect with grateful triumph, that
Christianity furnishes them with a better
guide than the tutor of Alcides,
[p 35]

and with a surer light than the doctrines
of pagan philosophy.

It
is far from my design severely to
condemn the innocent pleasures of life:
I would only beg leave to observe,
that those which are criminal should
never be allowed; and that even the
most innocent will, by immoderate
use, soon cease to be so.

The
women of this country were
not sent into the world to shun
society, but to embellish it; they
were not designed for wilds and solitudes,
but for the amiable and endearing
offices of social life. They have
useful stations to fill, and important
characters to sustain. They are of a
religion which does not impose penances,
but enjoins duties; a religion
of perfect purity, but of perfect bene
[p 36]
volence
also. A religion which does
not condemn its followers to indolent
seclusion from the world, but assigns
them the more dangerous, though
more honourable province, of living
uncorrupted in it. In fine, a religion,
which does not direct them to fly from
the multitude, that they may do nothing,
but which positively forbids
them to follow a multitude to do evil.

[p 37]

The Emperor Caligula.

[3]

Nothing
can be more admirable than the manner
in which this allegory is conducted; and the
whole work, not to mention its images, machinery,
and other poetical beauties, is written in the very
finest strain of morality. In this latter respect it is
evidently superior to the works of the ancients, the
moral of which is frequently tainted by the grossness
of their mythology. Something of the purity of the
Christian religion may be discovered even in Fenelon's
heathens, and they catch a tincture of piety
in passing through the hands of that amiable prelate.

THOUGHTS

ON

CONVERSATION.

It
has been advised, and by very
respectable authorities too, that in
conversation women should carefully
conceal any knowledge or learning
they may happen to possess. I own,
with submission, that I do not see either
the necessity or propriety of this
[p 38]

advice. For if a young lady has that
discretion and modesty, without which
all knowledge is little worth, she will
never make an ostentatious parade of
it, because she will rather be intent on
acquiring more, than on displaying
what she has.

I am
at a loss to know why a young
female is instructed to exhibit, in the
most advantageous point of view, her
skill in music, her singing, dancing,
taste in dress, and her acquaintance
with the most fashionable games and
amusements, while her piety is to be
anxiously concealed, and her knowledge
affectedly disavowed, lest the former
should draw on her the appellation of
an enthusiast, or the latter that of a
pedant.
[p 39]

In
regard to knowledge, why should
she for ever affect to be on her guard,
lest she should be found guilty of a
small portion of it? She need be the
less solicitous about it, as it seldom
proves to be so very considerable as to
excite astonishment or admiration: for,
after all the acquisitions which her
talents and her studies have enabled
her to make, she will, generally speaking,
be found to have less of what is
called
learning
, than a common school-boy.

It
would be to the last degree presumptuous
and absurd, for a young
woman to pretend to give the
ton
to the
company; to interrupt the pleasure of
others, and her own opportunity of
improvement, by talking when she
ought to listen; or to introduce subjects
out of the common road, in or
[p 40]
der
to shew her own wit, or expose
the want of it in others: but were the
sex to be totally silent when any topic
of literature happens to be discussed in
their presence, conversation would lose
much of its vivacity, and society would
be robbed of one of its most interesting
charms.

How
easily and effectually may a
well-bred woman promote the most
useful and elegant conversation, almost
without speaking a word! for the modes
of speech are scarcely more variable than
the modes of silence. The silence of
listless ignorance, and the silence of
sparkling intelligence, are perhaps as
separately marked, and as distinctly
expressed, as the same feelings could
have been by the most unequivocal
language. A woman, in a company
where she has the least influence, may
[p 41]

promote any subject by a profound
and invariable attention, which shews
that she is pleased with it, and by an
illuminated countenance, which proves
she understands it. This obliging attention
is the most flattering encouragement
in the world to men of sense and
letters, to continue any topic of instruction
or entertainment they happen
to be engaged in: it owed its introduction
perhaps to accident, the best
introduction in the world for a subject
of ingenuity, which, though it could
not have been formally proposed without
pedantry, may be continued with
ease and good humour; but which
will be frequently and effectually stopped
by the listlessness, inattention, or
whispering of silly girls, whose weariness
betrays their ignorance, and whose
impatience exposes their ill-breeding.
A polite man, however deeply inte
[p 42]
rested
in the subject on which he is
conversing, catches at the slightest hint
to have done: a look is a sufficient
intimation, and if a pretty simpleton,
who sits near him, seems
distraite
, he
puts an end to his remarks, to the
great regret of the reasonable part of
the company, who perhaps might have
gained more improvement by the continuance
of such a conversation, than
a week's reading would have yielded
them; for it is such company as this,
that give an edge to each other's wit,
"as iron sharpeneth iron."

That
silence is one of the great arts
of conversation is allowed by Cicero
himself, who says, there is not only an
art but even an eloquence in it. And
this opinion is confirmed by a great modern
[5]
,
in the following little anecdote
from one of the ancients.
[p 43]

When
many Grecian philosophers
had a solemn meeting before the ambassador
of a foreign prince, each endeavoured
to shew his parts by the
brilliancy of his conversation, that the
ambassador might have something to
relate of the Grecian wisdom. One of
them, offended, no doubt, at the loquacity
of his companions, observed a
profound silence; when the ambassador,
turning to him, asked, "But what
have you to say, that I may report it?"
He made this laconic, but very pointed
reply: "Tell your king, that you have
found one among the Greeks who
knew how to be silent."

There
is a quality infinitely more
intoxicating to the female mind than
knowledge—this is Wit, the most captivating,
but the most dreaded of all
talents: the most dangerous to those
[p 44]

who have it, and the most feared by
those who have it not. Though it is
against all the rules, yet I cannot find
in my heart to abuse this charming
quality. He who is grown rich without
it, in safe and sober dulness, shuns
it as a disease, and looks upon poverty
as its invariable concomitant. The
moralist declaims against it as the
source of irregularity, and the frugal
citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy
itself, for he considers it as the parent
of extravagance and beggary. The
Cynic will ask of what use it is? Of
very little perhaps: no more is a
flower garden, and yet it is allowed as
an object of innocent amusement and
delightful recreation. A woman, who
possesses this quality, has received a
most dangerous present, perhaps not
less so than beauty itself: especially if
it be not sheathed in a temper peculi
[p 45]
arly
inoffensive, chastised by a most
correct judgment, and restrained by
more prudence than falls to the common
lot.

This
talent is more likely to make
a woman vain than knowledge; for as
Wit is the immediate property of its
possessor, and learning is only an acquaintance
with the knowledge of other
people, there is much more danger,
that we should be vain of what is our
own, than of what we borrow.

But
Wit, like learning, is not near
so common a thing as is imagined.
Let not therefore a young lady be
alarmed at the acuteness of her own
wit, any more than at the abundance
of her own knowledge. The great
danger is, lest she should mistake pertness,
flippancy, or imprudence, for this
[p 46]

brilliant quality, or imagine she is
witty, only because she is indiscreet.
This is very frequently the case, and
this makes the name of wit so cheap,
while its real existence is so rare.

Lest
the flattery of her acquaintance,
or an over-weening opinion of
her own qualifications, should lead
some vain and petulant girl into a false
notion that she has a great deal of wit,
when she has only a redundancy of
animal spirits, she may not find it useless
to attend to the definition of this
quality, by one who had as large a
portion of it, as most individuals could
ever boast:

'Tis not a tale, 'tis not a jest,

Admir'd with laughter at a feast,

Nor florid talk, which can that title gain,

The proofs of wit for ever must remain.

Neither can that have any place,

At which a virgin hides her face;

Such dross the fire must purge away; 'tis just,

The author blush there, where the reader must.

Cowley
.

[p 47]

But
those who actually possess this
rare talent, cannot be too abstinent in
the use of it. It often makes admirers,
but it never makes friends; I mean,
where it is the predominant feature;
and the unprotected and defenceless
state of womanhood calls for friendship
more than for admiration. She
who does not desire friends has a sordid
and insensible soul; but she who
is ambitious of making every man her
admirer, has an invincible vanity and
a cold heart.

But
to dwell only on the side of
policy, a prudent woman, who has
established the reputation of some ge
[p 48]
nius
will sufficiently maintain it, without
keeping her faculties always on
the stretch to say
good things
. Nay,
if reputation alone be her object, she
will gain a more solid one by her forbearance,
as the wiser part of her acquaintance
will ascribe it to the right
motive, which is, not that she has less
wit, but that she has more judgment.

The
fatal fondness for indulging a
spirit of ridicule, and the injurious and
irreparable consequences which sometimes
attend the
too prompt reply
, can
never be too seriously or too severely
condemned. Not to offend, is the first
step towards pleasing. To give pain
is as much an offence against humanity,
as against good breeding; and
surely it is as well to abstain from an
action because it is sinful, as because
it is impolite. In company, young
[p 49]

ladies would do well before they speak,
to reflect, if what they are going to
say may not distress some worthy person
present, by wounding them in
their persons, families, connexions, or
religious opinions. If they find it
will touch them in either of these, I
should advise them to suspect, that
what they were going to say is not
so
very
good a thing as they at first
imagined. Nay, if even it was one of
those bright ideas, which
Venus has imbued
with a fifth part of her nectar
, so
much greater will be their merit in
suppressing it, if there was a probability
it might offend. Indeed, if they
have the temper and prudence to make
such a previous reflection, they will be
more richly rewarded by their own inward
triumph, at having suppressed
a lively but severe remark, than they
could have been with the dissembled
[p 50]

applauses of the whole company, who,
with that complaisant deceit, which
good breeding too much authorises,
affect openly to admire what they secretly
resolve never to forgive.

I have
always been delighted with
the story of the little girl's eloquence,
in one of the Children's Tales, who received
from a friendly fairy the gift,
that at every word she uttered, pinks,
roses, diamonds, and pearls, should
drop from her mouth. The hidden
moral appears to be this, that it was
the sweetness of her temper which produced
this pretty fanciful effect: for
when her malicious sister desired the
same gift from the good-natured tiny
Intelligence, the venom of her own
heart converted it into poisonous and
loathsome reptiles.
[p 51]

A man
of sense and breeding will
sometimes join in the laugh, which has
been raised at his expence by an ill-natured
repartee; but if it was very
cutting, and one of those shocking sort
of truths, which as they can scarcely
be pardoned even in private, ought
never to be uttered in public, he does
not laugh because he is pleased, but
because he wishes to conceal how much
he is hurt. As the sarcasm was uttered
by a lady, so far from seeming to resent
it, he will be the first to commend
it; but notwithstanding that, he will
remember it as a trait of malice, when
the whole company shall have forgotten
it as a stroke of wit. Women are
so far from being privileged by their
sex to say unhandsome or cruel things,
that it is this very circumstance which
renders them more intolerable. When
the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is
[p 52]

no relief to him who is wounded to
reflect, that the hand which shot it
was a fair one.

Many
women, when they have a
favourite point to gain, or an earnest
wish to bring any one over to their opinion,
often use a very disingenuous
method: they will state a case ambiguously,
and then avail themselves of
it, in whatever manner shall best answer
their purpose; leaving your mind in
a state of indecision as to their real
meaning, while they triumph in the
perplexity they have given you by the
unfair conclusions they draw, from premises
equivocally stated. They will
also frequently argue from exceptions
instead of rules, and are astonished
when you are not willing to be contented
with a prejudice, instead of a
reason.
[p 53]

In
a sensible company of both sexes,
where women are not restrained by
any other reserve than what their natural
modesty imposes; and where the
intimacy of all parties authorises the
utmost freedom of communication;
should any one inquire what were the
general sentiments on some particular
subject, it will, I believe, commonly
happen, that the ladies, whose imaginations
have kept pace with the narration,
have anticipated its end, and are
ready to deliver their sentiments on it
as soon as it is finished. While some
of the male hearers, whose minds were
busied in settling the propriety, comparing
the circumstances, and examining
the consistencies of what was said,
are obliged to pause and discriminate,
before they think of answering. Nothing
is so embarrassing as a variety of
matter, and the conversation of women
[p 54]

is often more perspicuous, because it
is less laboured.

A man
of deep reflection, if he does
not keep up an intimate commerce
with the world, will be sometimes so
entangled in the intricacies of intense
thought, that he will have the appearance
of a confused and perplexed expression;
while a sprightly woman will
extricate herself with that lively and
"rash dexterity," which will almost
always please, though it is very far
from being always right. It is easier
to confound than to convince an opponent;
the former may be effected by
a turn that has more happiness than
truth in it. Many an excellent reasoner,
well skilled in the theory of the
schools, has felt himself discomfited
by a reply, which, though as wide of
the mark, and as foreign to the que
[p 55]
stion
as can be conceived, has disconcerted
him more than the most startling
proposition, or the most accurate
chain of reasoning could have done;
and he has borne the laugh of his fair
antagonist, as well as of the whole
company, though he could not but
feel, that his own argument was attended
with the fullest demonstration:
so true is it, that it is not always necessary
to be right, in order to be applauded.

But
let not a young lady's vanity
be too much elated with this false applause,
which is given, not to her
merit, but to her sex: she has not perhaps
gained a victory, though she may
be allowed a triumph; and it should
humble her to reflect, that the tribute
is paid, not to her strength but her
weakness. It is worth while to discri
[p 56]
minate
between that applause, which
is given from the complaisance of
others, and that which is paid to our
own merit.

Where
great sprightliness is the natural
bent of the temper, girls should
endeavour to habituate themselves to
a custom of observing, thinking, and
reasoning. I do not mean, that they
should devote themselves to abstruse
speculation, or the study of logic; but
she who is accustomed to give a due
arrangement to her thoughts, to reason
justly and pertinently on common
affairs, and judiciously to deduce effects
from their causes, will be a better
logician than some of those who claim
the name, because they have studied
the art: this is being "learned without
the rules;" the best definition,
perhaps, of that sort of literature which
[p 57]

is properest for the sex. That species
of knowledge, which appears to be the
result of reflection rather than of science,
sits peculiarly well on women.
It is not uncommon to find a lady,
who, though she does not know a rule
of Syntax, scarcely ever violates one;
and who constructs every sentence she
utters, with more propriety than many
a learned dunce, who has every rule
of Aristotle by heart, and who can
lace his own thread-bare discourse
with the golden shreds of Cicero and
Virgil.

It
has been objected, and I fear
with some reason, that female conversation
is too frequently tinctured
with a censorious spirit, and that ladies
are seldom apt to discover much tenderness
for the errors of a fallen sister.
[p 58]

If it be so, it is a grievous fault.

No
arguments can justify, no pleas can
extenuate it. To insult over the miseries
of an unhappy creature is inhuman,
not to compassionate them is unchristian.
The worthy part of the
sex always express themselves humanely
on the failings of others, in proportion
to their own undeviating goodness.

And
here I cannot help remarking,
that young women do not always carefully
distinguish between running into
the error of detraction, and its opposite
extreme of indiscriminate applause.
This proceeds from the false idea they
entertain, that the direct contrary to
what is wrong must be right. Thus
the dread of being only suspected of
one fault makes them actually guilty
of another. The desire of avoiding
[p 59]

the imputation of envy, impels them
to be insincere; and to establish a
reputation for sweetness of temper and
generosity, they affect sometimes to
speak of very indifferent characters
with the most extravagant applause.
With such, the hyperbole is a favourite
figure; and every degree of comparison
but the superlative is rejected,
as cold and inexpressive. But this
habit of exaggeration greatly weakens
their credit, and destroys the weight
of their opinion on other occasions;
for people very soon discover what degree
of faith is to be given both to
their judgment and veracity. And
those of real merit will no more be
flattered by that approbation, which
cannot distinguish the value of what
it praises, than the celebrated painter
must have been at the judgment passed
[p 60]

on his works by an ignorant spectator,
who, being asked what he thought of
such and such very capital but very
different pieces, cried out in an affected
rapture, "All alike! all alike!"

It
has been proposed to the young,
as a maxim of supreme wisdom, to
manage so dexterously in conversation,
as to appear to be well acquainted
with subjects, of which they are totally
ignorant; and this, by affecting
silence in regard to those, on which
they are known to excel.—But why
counsel this disingenuous fraud? Why
add to the numberless arts of deceit,
this practice of deceiving, as it were,
on a settled principle? If to disavow
the knowledge they really have be a
culpable affectation, then certainly to
insinuate an idea of their skill, where
[p 61]

they are actually ignorant, is a most
unworthy artifice.

But
of all the qualifications for
conversation, humility, if not the
most brilliant, is the safest, the most
amiable, and the most feminine. The
affectation of introducing subjects,
with which others are unacquainted,
and of displaying talents superior to
the rest of the company, is as dangerous
as it is foolish.

There are many, who never can
forgive another for being more agreeable
and more accomplished than
themselves, and who can pardon any
offence rather than an eclipsing merit.
Had the nightingale in the fable
conquered his vanity, and resisted
the temptation of shewing a fine voice,
[p 62]

he might have escaped the talons of
the hawk. The melody of his singing
was the cause of his destruction; his
merit brought him into danger, and
his vanity cost him his life.

[p 63]

ON

ENVY.

Envy came next, Envy with squinting eyes,

Sick of a strange disease, his neighbour's health;

Best then he lives when any better dies,

Is never poor but in another's wealth:

On best mens harms and griefs he feeds his fill,

Else his own maw doth eat with spiteful will,

Ill must the temper be, where diet is so ill.

Fletcher's Purple Island
.

"
Envy
, (says Lord Bacon) has
no holidays." There cannot
perhaps be a more lively and striking
description of the miserable state of
mind those endure, who are tormented
[p 64]

with this vice. A spirit of emulation
has been supposed to be the source of
the greatest improvements; and there
is no doubt but the warmest rivalship
will produce the most excellent effects;
but it is to be feared, that a perpetual
state of contest will injure the temper
so essentially, that the mischief will
hardly be counterbalanced by any
other advantages. Those, whose progress
is the most rapid, will be apt to
despise their less successful competitors,
who, in return, will feel the bitterest
resentment against their more
fortunate rivals. Among persons of
real goodness, this jealousy and contempt
can never be equally felt, because
every advancement in piety will
be attended with a proportionable increase
of humility, which will lead them
to contemplate their own improve
[p 65]
ments
with modesty, and to view
with charity the miscarriages of others.

When
an envious man is melancholy,
one may ask him, in the words
of Bion, what evil has befallen himself,
or what good has happened to
another? This last is the scale by
which he principally measures his felicity,
and the very smiles of his friends
are so many deductions from his own
happiness. The wants of others are
the standard by which he rates his own
wealth, and he estimates his riches,
not so much by his own possessions,
as by the necessities of his neighbours.

When
the malevolent intend to
strike a very deep and dangerous
stroke of malice, they generally begin
the most remotely in the world from
[p 66]

the subject nearest their hearts. They
set out with commending the object
of their envy for some trifling quality
or advantage, which it is scarcely worth
while to possess: they next proceed to
make a general profession of their own
good-will and regard for him: thus
artfully removing any suspicion of
their design, and clearing all obstructions
for the insidious stab they are
about to give; for who will suspect
them of an intention to injure the object
of their peculiar and professed
esteem? The hearer's belief of the
fact grows in proportion to the seeming
reluctance with which it is told,
and to the conviction he has, that the
relater is not influenced by any private
pique, or personal resentment; but
that the confession is extorted from him
sorely against his inclination, and
purely on account of his zeal for truth.
[p 67]

Anger
is less reasonable and more
sincere than envy.—Anger breaks out
abruptly; envy is a great prefacer—anger
wishes to be understood at once:
envy is fond of remote hints and ambiguities;
but, obscure as its oracles
are, it never ceases to deliver them till
they are perfectly comprehended:—anger
repeats the same circumstances
over again; envy invents new ones at
every fresh recital—anger gives a
broken, vehement, and interrupted
narrative; envy tells a more consistent
and more probable, though a falser
tale—anger is excessively imprudent,
for it is impatient to disclose every
thing it knows; envy is discreet, for
it has a great deal to hide—anger never
consults times or seasons; envy
waits for the lucky moment, when the
wound it meditates may be made the
most exquisitely painful, and the
[p 68]

most incurably deep—anger uses more
invective; envy does more mischief—simple
anger soon runs itself out of
breath, and is exhausted at the end of
its tale; but it is for that chosen period
that envy has treasured up the most
barbed arrow in its whole quiver—anger
puts a man out of himself: but
the truly malicious generally preserve
the appearance of self-possession, or
they could not so effectually injure.—The
angry man sets out by destroying
his whole credit with you at once,
for he very frankly confesses his abhorrence
and detestation of the object of
his abuse; while the envious man carefully
suppresses all his own share in
the affair.—The angry man defeats the
end of his resentment, by keeping
himself

continually before your eyes, instead
of his enemy; while the envious
man artfully brings forward the object
[p 69]

of his malice, and keeps himself out
of sight.—The angry man talks loudly
of his own wrongs; the envious of his
adversary's injustice.—A passionate person,
if his resentments are not complicated
with malice, divides his time
between sinning and sorrowing; and,
as the irascible passions cannot constantly
be at work, his heart may sometimes
get a holiday.—Anger is a violent
act, envy a constant habit—no one can
be always angry, but he may be always
envious:—an angry man's enmity
(if he be generous) will subside when
the object of his resentment becomes
unfortunate; but the envious man can
extract food from his malice out of calamity
itself, if he finds his adversary
bears it with dignity, or is pitied or
assisted in it. The rage of the passionate
man is totally extinguished by
the death of his enemy; but the ha
[p 70]
tred
of the malicious is not buried even
in the grave of his rival: he will envy
the good name he has left behind him;
he will envy him the tears of his widow,
the prosperity of his children,
the esteem of his friends, the praises of
his epitaph—nay the very magnificence
of his funeral.

"
The
ear of jealousy heareth all
things," (says the wise man) frequently
I believe more than is uttered, which
makes the company of persons infected
with it still more dangerous.

When
you tell those of a malicious
turn, any circumstance that has happened
to another, though they perfectly
know of whom you are speaking,
they often affect to be at a loss,
to forget his name, or to misapprehend
you in some respect or other; and this
[p 71]

merely to have an opportunity of slily
gratifying their malice by mentioning
some unhappy defect or personal infirmity
he labours under; and not contented
"to tack his every error to his
name," they will, by way of farther
explanation, have recourse to the faults
of his father, or the misfortunes of
his family; and this with all the seeming
simplicity and candor in the world,
merely for the sake of preventing mistakes,
and to clear up every doubt of
his identity.—If you are speaking of a
lady, for instance, they will perhaps
embellish their inquiries, by asking if
you mean her, whose great grandfather
was a bankrupt, though she has the
vanity to keep a chariot, while others
who are much better born walk on
foot; or they will afterwards recollect,
that you may possibly mean her cousin,
of the same name, whose mother was
[p 72]

suspected of such or such an indiscretion,
though the daughter had the luck
to make her fortune by marrying,
while her betters are overlooked.

To

hint at a fault
, does more mischief
than speaking out; for whatever
is left for the imagination to finish,
will not fail to be overdone: every
hiatus will be more then filled up, and
every pause more than supplied. There
is less malice, and less mischief too,
in telling a man's name than the initials
of it; as a worthier person may
be involved in the most disgraceful
suspicions by such a dangerous ambiguity.

It
is not uncommon for the envious,
after having attempted to deface
the fairest character so industriously,
that they are afraid you will begin to
[p 73]

detect their malice, to endeavour to
remove your suspicions effectually, by
assuring you, that what they have just
related is only the popular opinion;
they themselves can never believe
things are so bad as they are said to
be; for their part, it is a rule with
them always to hope the best. It is
their way never to believe or report ill
of any one. They will, however,
mention the story in all companies,
that they may do their friend the service
of protesting their disbelief of it.
More reputations are thus hinted away
by false friends, than are openly destroyed
by public enemies. An
if
, or
a
but
, or a mortified look, or a languid
defence, or an ambiguous shake
of the head, or a hasty word affectedly
recalled, will demolish a character more
effectually, than the whole artillery of
malice when openly levelled against it.
[p 74]

It
is not that envy never praises—No,
that would be making a public
profession of itself, and advertising
its own malignity; whereas the greatest
success of its efforts depends on the
concealment of their end. When envy
intends to strike a stroke of Machiavelian
policy, it sometimes affects the
language of the most exaggerated applause;
though it generally takes care,
that the subject of its panegyric shall
be a very indifferent and common character,
so that it is well aware none of
its praises will stick.

It
is the unhappy nature of envy
not to be contented with positive misery,
but to be continually aggravating
its own torments, by comparing
them with the felicities of others.
The eyes of envy are perpetually fixed
on the object which disturbs it, nor
[p 75]

can it avert them from it, though to
procure itself the relief of a temporary
forgetfulness. On seeing the innocence
of the first pair,

Aside the devil turn'd,

For Envy, yet with jealous leer malign,

Eyed them askance.

As this enormous sin chiefly instigated
the revolt, and brought on the
ruin of the angelic spirits, so it is not
improbable, that it will be a principal
instrument of misery in a future world,
for the envious to compare their desperate
condition with the happiness of
the children of God; and to heighten
their actual wretchedness by reflecting
on what they have lost.

Perhaps
envy, like lying and ingratitude,
is practised with more frequency,
because it is practised with
[p 76]

impunity; but there being no human
laws against these crimes, is so far from
an inducement to commit them, that
this very consideration would be sufficient
to deter the wise and good, if
all others were ineffectual; for of
how heinous a nature must those sins
be, which are judged above the reach
of human punishment, and are reserved
for the final justice of God himself!
[p 77]

ON THE

DANGER

OF

SENTIMENTAL OR ROMANTIC

CONNEXIONS.

Among
the many evils which
prevail under the sun, the abuse
of words is not the least considerable.
By the influence of time, and the perversion
of fashion, the plainest and
most unequivocal may be so altered,
[p 78]

as to have a meaning assigned them almost
diametrically opposite to their
original signification.

The
present age may be termed, by
way of distinction, the age of sentiment,
a word which, in the implication
it now bears, was unknown to
our plain ancestors. Sentiment is the
varnish of virtue to conceal the deformity
of vice; and it is not uncommon
for the same persons to make a jest of
religion, to break through the most
solemn ties and engagements, to practise
every art of latent fraud and open
seduction, and yet to value themselves
on speaking and writing
sentimentally
.

But
this refined jargon, which has
infested letters and tainted morals, is
chiefly admired and adopted by
young
ladies
of a certain turn, who read
sen
[p 79]
timental
books
, write
sentimental letters
,
and contract
sentimental friendships
.

Error
is never likely to do so
much mischief as when it disguises its
real tendency, and puts on an engaging
and attractive appearance. Many
a young woman, who would be shocked
at the imputation of an intrigue,
is extremely flattered at the idea of a
sentimental connexion, though perhaps
with a dangerous and designing man,
who, by putting on this mask of plausibility
and virtue, disarms her of her
prudence, lays her apprehensions asleep,
and involves her in misery; misery
the more inevitable because unsuspected.
For she who apprehends no danger,
will not think it necessary to be
always upon her guard; but will rather
invite than avoid the ruin which
[p 80]

comes under so specious and so fair a
form.

Such
an engagement will be infinitely
dearer to her vanity than an
avowed and authorised attachment;
for one of these sentimental lovers will
not scruple very seriously to assure a credulous
girl, that her unparalleled merit
entitles her to the adoration of the
whole world, and that the universal
homage of mankind is nothing more
than the unavoidable tribute extorted
by her charms. No wonder then she
should be easily prevailed on to believe,
that an individual is captivated
by perfections which might enslave a
million. But she should remember,
that he who endeavours to intoxicate
her with adulation, intends one day
most effectually to humble her. For
an artful man has always a secret de
[p 81]
sign
to pay himself in future for every
present sacrifice. And this prodigality
of praise, which he now appears to
lavish with such thoughtless profusion,
is, in fact, a sum [oe]conomically laid
out to supply his future necessities:
of this sum he keeps an exact estimate,
and at some distant day promises himself
the most exorbitant interest for it.
If he has address and conduct, and,
the object of his pursuit much vanity,
and some sensibility, he seldom fails
of success; for so powerful will be his
ascendancy over her mind, that she
will soon adopt his notions and opinions.
Indeed, it is more than probable
she possessed most of them before, having
gradually acquired them in her
initiation into the sentimental character.
To maintain that character with
dignity and propriety, it is necessary
she should entertain the most elevated
[p 82]

ideas of disproportionate alliances, and
disinterested love; and consider fortune,
rank, and reputation, as mere
chimerical distinctions and vulgar prejudices.

The
lover, deeply versed in all the
obliquities of fraud, and skilled to wind
himself into every avenue of the heart
which indiscretion has left unguarded,
soon discovers on which side it is most
accessible. He avails himself of this
weakness by addressing her in a language
exactly consonant to her own
ideas. He attacks her with her own
weapons, and opposes rhapsody to
sentiment—He professes so sovereign
a contempt for the paltry concerns of
money, that she thinks it her duty to
reward him for so generous a renunciation.
Every plea he artfully advances
of his own unworthiness, is
[p 83]

considered by her as a fresh demand
which her gratitude must answer. And
she makes it a point of honour to sacrifice
to him that fortune which he
is too noble to regard. These professions
of humility are the common artifice
of the vain, and these protestations
of generosity the refuge of the
rapacious. And among its many
smooth mischiefs, it is one of the sure
and successful frauds of sentiment, to
affect the most frigid indifference to
those external and pecuniary advantages,
which it is its great and real
object to obtain.

A sentimental
girl very rarely
entertains any doubt of her personal
beauty; for she has been daily accustomed
to contemplate it herself, and
to hear of it from others. She will
not, therefore, be very solicitous for
[p 84]

the confirmation of a truth so self-evident;
but she suspects, that her
pretensions to understanding are more
likely to be disputed, and, for that
reason, greedily devours every compliment
offered to those perfections,
which are less obvious and more refined.
She is persuaded, that men
need only open their eyes to decide
on her beauty, while it will be the
most convincing proof of the taste,
sense, and elegance of her admirer,
that he can discern and flatter those
qualities in her. A man of the character
here supposed, will easily insinuate
himself into her affections, by
means of this latent but leading foible,
which may be called the guiding clue
to a sentimental heart. He will affect
to overlook that beauty which attracts
common eyes, and ensnares common
hearts, while he will bestow the most
[p 85]

delicate praises on the beauties of her
mind, and finish the climax of adulation,
by hinting that she is superior
to it.

And when he tells her she hates flattery,

She says she does, being then most flatter'd.

But
nothing, in general, can end less
delightfully than these sublime attachments,
even where no acts of seduction
were ever practised, but they are
suffered, like mere sublunary connexions,
to terminate in the vulgar catastrophe
of marriage. That wealth,
which lately seemed to be looked on
with ineffable contempt by the lover,
now appears to be the principal attraction
in the eyes of the husband;
and he, who but a few short weeks
before, in a transport of sentimental
generosity, wished her to have been
a village maid, with no portion but
[p 86]

her crook and her beauty, and that
they might spend their days in pastoral
love and innocence, has now lost all
relish for the Arcadian life, or any
other life in which she must be his
companion.

On
the other hand, she who was
lately

An angel call'd, and angel-like ador'd,

is shocked to find herself at once stripped
of all her celestial attributes. This
late divinity, who scarcely yielded to
her sisters of the sky, now finds herself
of less importance in the esteem
of the man she has chosen, than any
other mere mortal woman. No longer
is she gratified with the tear of counterfeited
passion, the sigh of dissembled
rapture, or the language of premeditated
adoration. No longer is the
[p 87]

altar of her vanity loaded with the oblations
of fictitious fondness, the incense
of falsehood, or the sacrifice of
flattery.—Her apotheosis is ended!—She
feels herself degraded from the
dignities and privileges of a goddess,
to all the imperfections, vanities, and
weaknesses of a slighted woman, and
a neglected wife. Her faults, which
were so lately overlooked, or mistaken
for virtues, are now, as Cassius says,
set in a note-book. The passion,
which was vowed eternal, lasted only
a few short weeks; and the indifference,
which was so far from being
included in the bargain, that it was
not so much as suspected, follows them
through the whole tiresome journey of
their insipid, vacant, joyless existence.

Thus
much for the
completion
of the
sentimental history. If we trace it
[p 88]

back to its beginning, we shall find
that a damsel of this cast had her head
originally turned by pernicious reading,
and her insanity confirmed by
imprudent friendships. She never fails
to select a beloved
confidante
of her
own turn and humour, though, if she
can help it, not quite so handsome as
herself. A violent intimacy ensues, or,
to speak the language of sentiment,
an intimate union of souls immediately
takes place, which is wrought to the
highest pitch by a secret and voluminous
correspondence, though they live
in the same street, or perhaps in the
same house. This is the fuel which
principally feeds and supplies the dangerous
flame of sentiment. In this
correspondence the two friends encourage
each other in the falsest notions
imaginable. They represent romantic
love as the great important busine
[p 89]
ss
of human life, and describe all the
other concerns of it as too low and
paltry to merit the attention of such
elevated beings, and fit only to employ
the daughters of the plodding
vulgar. In these letters, family affairs
are misrepresented, family secrets divulged,
and family misfortunes aggravated.
They are filled with vows
of eternal amity, and protestations of
never-ending love. But interjections
and quotations are the principal embellishments
of these very sublime
epistles. Every panegyric contained
in them is extravagant and hyperbolical,
and every censure exaggerated
and excessive. In a favourite, every
frailty is heightened into a perfection,
and in a foe degraded into a crime.
The dramatic poets, especially the
most tender and romantic, are quoted
in almost every line, and every pom
[p 90]
pous
or pathetic thought is forced to
give up its natural and obvious meaning,
and with all the violence of misapplication,
is compelled to suit some
circumstance of imaginary woe of the
fair transcriber. Alicia is not too mad
for her heroics, nor Monimia too mild
for her soft emotions.

Fathers

have flinty hearts
is an expression
worth an empire, and is always
used with peculiar emphasis and
enthusiasm. For a favourite topic of
these epistles is the groveling spirit
and sordid temper of the parents, who
will be sure to find no quarter at the
hands of their daughters, should they
presume to be so unreasonable as to
direct their course of reading, interfere
in their choice of friends, or interrupt
their very important correspondence.
But as these young ladies are fertile in
[p 91]

expedients, and as their genius is never
more agreeably exercised than in
finding resources, they are not without
their secret exultation, in case either
of the above interesting events
should happen, as they carry with
them a certain air of tyranny and persecution
which is very delightful. For
a prohibited correspondence is one of
the great incidents of a sentimental life,
and a letter clandestinely received, the
supreme felicity of a sentimental lady.

Nothing
can equal the astonishment
of these soaring spirits, when their
plain friends or prudent relations presume
to remonstrate with them on any
impropriety in their conduct. But if
these worthy people happen to be
somewhat advanced in life, their contempt
is then a little softened by pity,
at the reflection that such very anti
[p 92]
quated
poor creatures should pretend
to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies
of their great refinement, sense, and
reading. They consider them as wretches
utterly ignorant of the sublime pleasures
of a delicate and exalted passion;
as tyrants whose authority is to be contemned,
and as spies whose vigilance is
to be eluded. The prudence of these
worthy friends they term suspicion,
and their experience dotage. For they
are persuaded, that the face of things
has so totally changed since their parents
were young, that though they
might then judge tolerably for themselves,
yet they are now (with all
their advantages of knowledge and
observation) by no means qualified to
direct their more enlightened daughters;
who, if they have made a great
progress in the sentimental walk, will
[p 93]

no more be influenced by the advice
of their mother, than they would go
abroad in her laced pinner or her brocade
suit.

But
young people never shew their
folly and ignorance more conspicuously,
than by this over-confidence in
their own judgment, and this haughty
disdain of the opinion of those who
have known more days. Youth has
a quickness of apprehension, which it
is very apt to mistake for an acuteness
of penetration. But youth, like cunning,
though very conceited, is very
short-sighted, and never more so than
when it disregards the instructions of
the wife, and the admonitions of the
aged. The same vices and follies influenced
the human heart in their
day, which influence it now, and
[p 94]

nearly in the same manner. One who
well knew the world and its various
vanities, has said, "The thing which
hath been, it is that which shall be,
and that which is done is that which
shall be done, and there is no new
thing under the sun."

It
is also a part of the sentimental
character, to imagine that none but
the young and the beautiful have any
right to the pleasures of society, of
even to the common benefits and blessings
of life. Ladies of this turn also
affect the most lofty disregard for useful
qualities and domestic virtues;
and this is a natural consequence: for
as this sort of sentiment is only a weed
of idleness, she who is constantly and
usefully employed, has neither leisure
nor propensity to cultivate it.
[p 95]

A sentimental
lady principally
values herself on the enlargement of
her notions, and her liberal way of
thinking. This superiority of soul
chiefly manifests itself in the contempt
of those minute delicacies and little decorums,
which, trifling as they may
be thought, tend at once to dignify
the character, and to restrain the
levity of the younger part of the sex.

Perhaps
the error here complained
of, originates in mistaking
sentiment

and
principle
for each other. Now I
conceive them to be extremely different.
Sentiment is the virtue of
ideas
,
and principle the virtue of
action
. Sentiment
has its seat in the head, principle
in the heart. Sentiment suggests
fine harangues and subtile distinctions;
principle conceives just notions, and
performs good actions in consequence
[p 96]

of them. Sentiment refines away the
simplicity of truth and the plainness
of piety; and, as a celebrated wit
[6]
has
remarked of his no less celebrated
contemporary, gives us virtue in words
and vice in deeds. Sentiment may be
called the Athenian, who
knew
what
was right, and principle the Lacedemonian
who
practised
it.

But
these qualities will be better
exemplified by an attentive consideration
of two admirably drawn characters
of Milton, which are beautifully,
delicately, and distinctly marked.
These are, Belial, who may not
improperly be called the
Demon of Sentiment
;
and Abdiel, who may be
termed the
Angel of Principle
.
[p 97]

Survey
the picture of Belial, drawn
by the sublimest hand that ever held
the poetic pencil.

A fairer person lost not heav'n; he seem'd

For dignity compos'd, and high exploit,

But all was false and hollow, tho' his tongue

Dropt manna, and could make the worse appear

The better reason, to perplex and dash

Maturest counsels, for his thoughts were low,

To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds

Tim'rous and slothful; yet he pleas'd the ear.

Paradise Lost
, B. II.

Here
is a lively and exquisite representation
of art, subtilty, wit, fine
breeding and polished manners: on
the whole, of a very accomplished and
sentimental spirit.

Now
turn to the artless, upright,
and unsophisticated Abdiel,
[p 98]

Faithful found

Among the faithless, faithful only he

Among innumerable false, unmov'd,

Unshaken, unseduc'd, unterrified;

His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal.

Nor number, nor example with him wrought

To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,

Though single.

Book
V.

But
it is not from these descriptions,
just and striking as they are, that their
characters are so perfectly known, as
from an examination of their conduct
through the remainder of this divine
work: in which it is well worth while
to remark the consonancy of their actions,
with what the above pictures
seem to promise. It will also be observed,
that the contrast between them
is kept up throughout, with the utmost
exactness of delineation, and the
most animated strength of colouring.
[p 99]

On a review it will be found, that
Belial
talked
all, and Abdiel
did
all.
The former,

With words still cloath'd in reason's guise,

Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloth,

Not peace.

Book
II.

In
Abdiel you will constantly find
the eloquence of action. When tempted
by the rebellious angels, with what

retorted scorn
, with what honest indignation
he deserts their multitudes, and
retreats from their contagious society!

All night the dreadless angel unpursued

Through heaven's wide champain held his way.

Book
VI.

No
wonder he was received with
such acclamations of joy by the celestial
powers, when there was

But one,

Yes, of so many myriads fall'n, but one

Return'd not lost.

Ibid.

[p 100]

And
afterwards, in a close contest
with the arch fiend,

A noble stroke he lifted high

On the proud crest of Satan.

Ibid.

What
was the effect of this courage
of the vigilant and active seraph?

Amazement seiz'd

The rebel throne, but greater rage to see

Thus foil'd their mightiest.

Abdiel
had the superiority of Belial
as much in the warlike combat, as
in the peaceful counsels.

Nor was it ought but just,

That he who in debate of truth had won,

Shou'd win in arms, in both disputes alike

Victor.

But
notwithstanding I have spoken
with some asperity against sentiment as
opposed to principle, yet I am con
[p 101]
vinced,
that true genuine sentiment,
(not the sort I have been describing)
may be so connected with principle,
as to bestow on it its brightest lustre,
and its most captivating graces. And
enthusiasm is so far from being disagreeable,
that a portion of it is perhaps
indispensably necessary in an engaging
woman. But it must be the
enthusiasm of the heart, not of the senses.
It must be the enthusiasm which grows
up with a feeling mind, and is cherished
by a virtuous education; not that which
is compounded of irregular passions, and
artificially refined by books of unnatural
fiction and improbable adventure.
I will even go so far as to assert,
that a young woman cannot have any
real greatness of soul, or true elevation
of principle, if she has not a tincture
of what the vulgar would call Romance,
but which persons of a certain
[p 102]

way of thinking will discern to proceed
from those fine feelings, and that
charming sensibility, without which,
though a woman may be worthy, yet
she can never be amiable.

But
this dangerous merit cannot be
too rigidly watched, as it is very apt
to lead those who possess it into inconveniencies
from which less interesting
characters are happily exempt. Young
women of strong sensibility may be
carried by the very amiableness of this
temper into the most alarming extremes.
Their tastes are passions. They
love and hate with all their hearts, and
scarcely suffer themselves to feel a reasonable
preference before it strengthens
into a violent attachment.

When
an innocent girl of this open,
trusting, tender heart, happens to meet
[p 103]

with one of her own sex and age,
whose address and manners are engaging,
she is instantly seized with an ardent
desire to commence a friendship
with her. She feels the most lively
impatience at the restraints of company,
and the decorums of ceremony.
She longs to be alone with her, longs
to assure her of the warmth of her tenderness,
and generously ascribes to
the fair stranger all the good qualities
she feels in her own heart, or rather
all those which she has met with in her
reading, dispersed in a variety of heroines.
She is persuaded, that her new
friend unites them all in herself, because
she carries in her prepossessing
countenance the promise of them all.
How cruel and how censorious would
this inexperienced girl think her mother
was, who should venture to hint,
that the agreeable unknown had de
[p 104]
fects
in her temper, or exceptions in
her character. She would mistake these
hints of discretion for the insinuations
of an uncharitable disposition. At first
she would perhaps listen to them with
a generous impatience, and afterwards
with a cold and silent disdain. She
would despise them as the effect of
prejudice, misrepresentation, or ignorance.
The more aggravated the censure,
the more vehemently would she
protest in secret, that her friendship
for this dear injured creature (who is
raised much higher in her esteem by
such injurious suspicions) shall know
no bounds, as she is assured it can
know no end.

Yet
this trusting confidence, this
honest indiscretion, is, at this early period
of life as amiable as it is natural;
and will, if wisely cultivated, produce,
[p 105]

at its proper season, fruits infinitely
more valuable than all the guarded
circumspection of premature, and
therefore artificial, prudence. Men, I
believe, are seldom struck with these
sudden prepossessions in favour of each
other. They are not so unsuspecting,
nor so easily led away by the predominance
of fancy. They engage more
warily, and pass through the several
stages of acquaintance, intimacy, and
confidence, by slower gradations; but
women, if they are sometimes deceived
in the choice of a friend, enjoy even
then an higher degree of satisfaction
than if they never trusted. For to be
always clad in the burthensome armour
of suspicion is more painful and
inconvenient, than to run the hazard
of suffering now and then a transient
injury.
[p 106]

But
the above observations only
extend to the young and the inexperienced;
for I am very certain, that
women are capable of as faithful and
as durable friendship as any of the
other sex. They can enter not only
into all the enthusiastic tenderness,
but into all the solid fidelity of attachment.
And if we cannot oppose instances
of equal weight with those of
Nysus and Euryalus, Theseus and Pirithous,
Pylades and Orestes, let it be
remembered, that it is because the recorders
of those characters were men,
and that the very existence of them is
merely poetical.

ON

TRUE AND FALSE

MEEKNESS.

A low
voice and soft address
are the common indications of
a well-bred woman, and should seem
to be the natural effects of a meek
and quiet spirit; but they are only the
outward and visible signs of it: for
[p 108]

they are no more meekness itself, than
a red coat is courage, or a black one
devotion.

Yet
nothing is more common than
to mistake the sign for the thing itself;
nor is any practice more frequent than
that of endeavouring to acquire the
exterior mark, without once thinking
to labour after the interior grace. Surely
this is beginning at the wrong end,
like attacking the symptom and neglecting
the disease. To regulate the
features, while the soul is in tumults,
or to command the voice while the
passions are without restraint, is as idle
as throwing odours into a stream when
the source is polluted.

The

sapient king
, who knew better
than any man the nature and the power
of beauty, has assured us, that the
[p 109]

temper of the mind has a strong influence
upon the features: "Wisdom
maketh the face to shine," says that
exquisite judge; and surely no part
of wisdom is more likely to produce
this amiable effect, than a placid serenity
of soul.

It
will not be difficult to distinguish
the true from the artificial meekness.
The former is universal and habitual,
the latter, local and temporary. Every
young female may keep this rule by
her, to enable her to form a just judgment
of her own temper: if she is not
as gentle to her chambermaid as she
is to her visitor, she may rest satisfied
that the spirit of gentleness is not in
her.

Who
would not be shocked and
disappointed to behold a well-bred
[p 110]

young lady, soft and engaging as the
doves of Venus, displaying a thousand
graces and attractions to win the hearts
of a large company, and the instant they
are gone, to see her look mad as the Pythian
maid, and all the frightened graces
driven from her furious countenance,
only because her gown was brought
home a quarter of an hour later than
she expected, or her ribbon sent half
a shade lighter or darker than she ordered?

All
men's characters are said to
proceed from their servants; and this
is more particularly true of ladies: for
as their situations are more domestic,
they lie more open to the inspection
of their families, to whom their real
characters are easily and perfectly
known; for they seldom think it worth
while to practise any disguise before
[p 111]

those, whose good opinion they do not
value, and who are obliged to submit
to their most insupportable humours,
because they are paid for it.

Amongst
women of breeding, the
exterior of gentleness is so uniformly
assumed, and the whole manner is so
perfectly level and
uni
, that it is
next to impossible for a stranger to
know any thing of their true dispositions
by conversing with them, and
even the very features are so exactly
regulated, that physiognomy, which
may sometimes be trusted among the
vulgar, is, with the polite, a most
lying science.

A very
termagant woman, if she
happens also to be a very artful one,
will be conscious she has so much to
conceal, that the dread of betraying
[p 112]

her real temper will make her put on
an over-acted softness, which, from its
very excess, may be distinguished from
the natural, by a penetrating eye. That
gentleness is ever liable to be suspected
for the counterfeited, which is so excessive
as to deprive people of the proper
use of speech and motion, or
which, as Hamlet says, makes them
lisp and amble, and nick-name God's
creatures.

The
countenance and manners of
some very fashionable persons may be
compared to the inscriptions on their
monuments, which speak nothing but
good of what is within; but he who
knows any thing of the world, or of
the human heart, will no more trust
to the courtesy, than he will depend
on the epitaph.
[p 113]

Among
the various artifices of factitious
meekness, one of the most frequent
and most plausible, is that of
affecting to be always equally delighted
with all persons and all characters. The
society of these languid beings is without
confidence, their friendship without
attachment, and their love without
affection, or even preference. This
insipid mode of conduct may be safe,
but I cannot think it has either taste,
sense, or principle in it.

These
uniformly smiling and approving
ladies, who have neither the
noble courage to reprehend vice, nor
the generous warmth to bear their honest
testimony in the cause of virtue,
conclude every one to be ill-natured
who has any penetration, and look upon
a distinguishing judgment as want
of tenderness. But they should learn,
[p 114]

that this discernment does not always
proceed from an uncharitable temper,
but from that long experience and
thorough knowledge of the world,
which lead those who have it to scrutinize
into the conduct and disposition
of men, before they trust entirely to
those fair appearances, which sometimes
veil the most insidious purposes.

We
are perpetually mistaking the
qualities and dispositions of our own
hearts. We elevate our failings into
virtues, and qualify our vices into
weaknesses: and hence arise so many
false judgments respecting meekness.
Self-ignorance is at the root of all this
mischief. Many ladies complain that,
for their part, their spirit is so meek
they can bear nothing; whereas, if
they spoke truth, they would say, their
spirit is so high and unbroken that
[p 115]

they can bear nothing. Strange! to
plead their meekness as a reason why
they cannot endure to be crossed, and
to produce their impatience of contradiction
as a proof of their gentleness!

Meekness
, like most other virtues,
has certain limits, which it no sooner
exceeds than it becomes criminal. Servility
of spirit is not gentleness but
weakness, and if allowed, under the
specious appearances it sometimes puts
on, will lead to the most dangerous
compliances. She who hears innocence
maligned without vindicating it,
falsehood asserted without contradicting
it, or religion prophaned without
resenting it, is not gentle but wicked.

To
give up the cause of an innocent,
injured friend, if the popular cry happens
to be against him, is the most
[p 116]

disgraceful weakness. This was the
case of Madame de Maintenon. She
loved the character and admired the
talents of Racine; she caressed him
while he had no enemies, but wanted
the greatness of mind, or rather the
common justice, to protect him against
their resentment when he had; and
her favourite was abandoned to the
suspicious jealousy of the king, when
a prudent remonstrance might have
preserved him.—But her tameness, if
not absolute connivance in the great
massacre of the protestants, in whose
church she had been bred, is a far
more guilty instance of her weakness;
an instance which, in spite of all her
devotional zeal and incomparable prudence,
will disqualify her from shining
in the annals of good women, however
she may be entitled to figure
among the great and the fortunate.
[p 117]

Compare her conduct with that of her
undaunted and pious countryman and
contemporary, Bougi, who, when
Louis would have prevailed on him
to renounce his religion for a commission
or a government, nobly replied,
"If I could be persuaded to betray
my God for a marshal's staff, I
might betray my king for a bribe
of much less consequence."

Meekness
is imperfect, if it be not
both active and passive; if it will not
enable us to subdue our own passions
and resentments, as well as qualify us
to bear patiently the passions and resentments
of others.

Before
we give way to any violent
emotion of anger, it would perhaps be
worth while to consider the value of
the object which excites it, and to re
[p 118]
flect
for a moment, whether the thing
we so ardently desire, or so vehemently
resent, be really of as much importance
to us, as that delightful tranquillity
of soul, which we renounce in
pursuit of it. If, on a fair calculation,
we find we are not likely to get as
much as we are sure to lose, then,
putting all religious considerations out
of the question, common sense and
human policy will tell us, we have
made a foolish and unprofitable exchange.
Inward quiet is a part of
one's self; the object of our resentment
may be only a matter of opinion; and,
certainly, what makes a portion of
our actual happiness ought to be too
dear to us, to be sacrificed for a trifling,
foreign, perhaps imaginary good.

The
most pointed satire I remember
to have read, on a mind enslaved by
[p 119]

anger, is an observation of Seneca's.
"Alexander (said he) had two friends,
Clitus and Lysimachus; the one he
exposed to a lion, the other to himself:
he who was turned loose to the
beast escaped, but Clitus was murdered,
for he was turned loose to an
angry man."

A passionate
woman's happiness
is never in her own keeping: it is the
sport of accident, and the slave of
events. It is in the power of her acquaintance,
her servants, but chiefly
of her enemies, and all her comforts
lie at the mercy of others. So far
from being willing to learn of him
who was meek and lowly, she considers
meekness as the want of a becoming
spirit, and lowliness as a despicable
and vulgar meanness. And an imperious
woman will so little covet the
[p 120]

ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
that it is almost the only ornament she
will not be solicitous to wear. But resentment
is a very expensive vice. How
dearly has it cost its votaries, even
from the sin of Cain, the first offender
in this kind! "It is cheaper (says a
pious writer) to forgive, and save
the charges."

If
it were only for mere human reasons,
it would turn to a better account
to be patient; nothing defeats the malice
of an enemy like a spirit of forbearance;
the return of rage for rage
cannot be so effectually provoking.
True gentleness, like an impenetrable
armour, repels the most pointed shafts
of malice: they cannot pierce through
this invulnerable shield, but either fall
hurtless to the ground, or return to
wound the hand that shot them.
[p 121]

A meek
spirit will not look out of itself
for happiness, because it finds a
constant banquet at home; yet, by a
sort of divine alchymy, it will convert
all external events to its own profit,
and be able to deduce some good, even
from the most unpromising: it will extract
comfort and satisfaction from the
most barren circumstances: "It will
suck honey out of the rock, and oil
out of the flinty rock."

But
the supreme excellence of this
complacent quality is, that it naturally
disposes the mind where it resides, to
the practice of every other that is amiable.
Meekness may be called the
pioneer of all the other virtues, which
levels every obstruction, and smooths
every difficulty that might impede
their entrance, or retard their progress.
[p 122]

The
peculiar importance and value
of this amiable virtue may be farther
seen in its permanency. Honours and
dignities are transient, beauty and
riches frail and fugacious, to a proverb.
Would not the truly wise,
therefore, wish to have some one possession,
which they might call their own
in the severest exigencies? But this
wish can only be accomplished by acquiring
and maintaining that calm and
absolute self-possession, which, as the
world had no hand in giving, so it
cannot, by the most malicious exertion
of its power, take away.
[p 123]

THOUGHTS

on the

CULTIVATION

of the

HEART
and
TEMPER

in the

EDUCATION
of
DAUGHTERS.

I have
not the foolish presumption
to imagine, that I can offer
any thing new on a subject, which
has been so successfully treated by
many learned and able writers. I would
only, with all possible deference, beg
[p 124]

leave to hazard a few short remarks
on that part of the subject of education,
which I would call the
education
of the heart
. I am well aware, that
this part also has not been less skilfully
and forcibly discussed than the
rest, though I cannot, at the same
time, help remarking, that it does
not appear to have been so much
adopted into common practice.

It
appears then, that notwithstanding
the great and real improvements,
which have been made in the affair
of female education, and notwithstanding
the more enlarged and generous
views of it, which prevail in the present
day, that there is still a very material
defect, which it is not, in general,
enough the object of attention to remove.
This defect seems to consist
in this, that too little regard is paid
[p 125]

to the dispositions of the
mind
, that
the indications of the
temper
are not
properly cherished, nor the affections
of the
heart
sufficiently regulated.

In
the first education of girls, as
far as the customs which fashion establishes
are right, they should undoubtedly
be followed. Let the exterior be
made a considerable object of attention,
but let it not be the principal, let it
not be the only one.—Let the graces
be industriously cultivated, but let
them not be cultivated at the expence
of the virtues.—Let the arms, the
head, the whole person be carefully
polished, but let not the heart be the
only portion of the human anatomy,
which shall be totally overlooked.

The
neglect of this cultivation seems
to proceed as much from a bad taste,
[p 126]

as from a false principle. The generality
of people form their judgment
of education by slight and sudden appearances,
which is certainly a wrong
way of determining. Music, dancing,
and languages, gratify those who teach
them, by perceptible and almost immediate
effects; and when there happens
to be no imbecillity in the pupil, nor
deficiency in the matter, every superficial
observer can, in some measure,
judge of the progress.—The effects of
most of these accomplishments address
themselves to the senses; and there are
more who can see and hear, than there
are who can judge and reflect.

Personal
perfection is not only
more obvious, it is also more rapid;
and even in very accomplished characters,
elegance usually precedes principle.
[p 127]

But
the heart, that natural seat of
evil propensities, that little troublesome
empire of the passions, is led to
what is right by slow motions and imperceptible
degrees. It must be admonished
by reproof, and allured by
kindness. Its liveliest advances are
frequently impeded by the obstinacy
of prejudice, and its brightest promises
often obscured by the tempests
of passion. It is slow in its acquisition
of virtue, and reluctant in its approaches
to piety.

There
is another reason, which
proves this mental cultivation to be
more important, as well as more difficult,
than any other part of education.
In the usual fashionable accomplishments,
the business of acquiring them
is almost always getting forwards, and
one difficulty is conquered before an
[p 128]
other
is suffered to shew itself; for a
prudent teacher will level the road his
pupil is to pass, and smooth the inequalities
which might retard her progress.

But
in morals, (which should be
the great object constantly kept in
view) the talk is far more difficult.
The unruly and turbulent desires of
the heart are not so obedient; one passion
will start up before another is suppressed.
The subduing Hercules cannot
cut off the heads so often as the
prolific Hydra can produce them, nor
fell the stubborn Antæus so fast as he
can recruit his strength, and rise in
vigorous and repeated opposition.

If
all the accomplishments could be
bought at the price of a single virtue,
the purchase would be infinitely dear!
[p 129]

And, however startling it may sound,
I think it is, notwithstanding, true,
that the labours of a good and wise
mother, who is anxious for her daughter's
most important interests, will
seem

to be at variance with those of her instructors.
She will doubtless rejoice
at her progress in any polite art, but
she will rejoice with trembling:—humility
and piety form the solid and
durable basis, on which she wishes to
raise the superstructure of the accomplishments,
while the accomplishments
themselves are frequently of that unsteady
nature, that if the foundation
is not secured, in proportion as the
building is enlarged, it will be overloaded
and destroyed by those very
ornaments, which were intended to
embellish, what they have contributed
to ruin.
[p 130]

The
more ostensible qualifications
should be carefully regulated, or they
will be in danger of putting to flight
the modest train of retreating virtues,
which cannot safely subsist before the
bold eye of public observation, or
bear the bolder tongue of impudent
and audacious flattery. A tender mother
cannot but feel an honest triumph,
in contemplating those excellencies in
her daughter which deserve applause,
but she will also shudder at the vanity
which that applause may excite, and
at those hitherto unknown ideas which
it may awaken.

The
master, it is his interest, and
perhaps his duty, will naturally teach
a girl to set her improvements in the
most conspicuous point of light.
Se
faire valoir
is the great principle
industriously inculcated into her young
[p 131]

heart, and seems to be considered as
a kind of fundamental maxim in education.
It is however the certain and
effectual seed, from which a thousand
yet unborn vanities will spring. This
dangerous doctrine (which yet is not
without its uses) will be counteracted
by the prudent mother, not in so
many words, but by a watchful and
scarcely perceptible dexterity. Such
an one will be more careful to have
the talents of her daughter
cultivated

than
exhibited
.

One
would be led to imagine, by
the common mode of female education,
that life consisted of one universal
holiday, and that the only contest
was, who should be best enabled
to excel in the sports and games that
were to be celebrated on it. Merely
ornamental accomplishments will but
[p 132]

indifferently qualify a woman to perform
the
duties
of life, though it is
highly proper she should possess them,
in order to furnish the
amusements
of
it. But is it right to spend so large
a portion of life without some preparation
for the business of living? A
lady may speak a little French and
Italian, repeat a few passages in a theatrical
tone, play and sing, have her
dressing-room hung with her own drawings,
and her person covered with her
own tambour work, and may, notwithstanding,
have been very
badly
educated
. Yet I am far from attempting
to depreciate the value of these
qualifications: they are most of them
not only highly becoming, but often
indispensably necessary, and a polite
education cannot be perfected without
them. But as the world seems to
be very well apprised of their import
[p 133]
ance,
there is the less occasion to insist
on their utility. Yet, though well-bred
young women should learn to
dance, sing, recite and draw, the end
of a good education is not that they
may become dancers, singers, players
or painters: its real object is to make
them good daughters, good wives,
good mistresses, good members of society,
and good christians. The above
qualifications therefore are intended to

adorn
their
leisure
, not to
employ
their

lives
; for an amiable and wise woman
will always have something better to
value herself on, than these advantages,
which, however captivating,
are still but subordinate parts of a truly
excellent character.

But
I am afraid parents themselves
sometimes contribute to the error of
which I am complaining. Do they
[p 134]

not often set a higher value on those
acquisitions which are calculated to
attract observation, and catch the eye
of the multitude, than on those which
are valuable, permanent, and internal?
Are they not sometimes more solicitous
about the opinion of others, respecting
their children, than about
the real advantage and happiness of
the children themselves? To an injudicious
and superficial eye, the best
educated girl may make the least brilliant
figure, as she will probably have
less flippancy in her manner, and less
repartee in her expression; and her acquirements,
to borrow bishop Sprat's
idea, will be rather
enamelled than embossed
.
But her merit will be known,
and acknowledged by all who come
near enough to discern, and have taste
enough to distinguish. It will be understood
and admired by the man,
[p 135]

whose happiness she is one day to
make, whose family she is to govern,
and whose children she is to educate.
He will not seek for her in the haunts
of dissipation, for he knows he shall
not find her there; but he will seek
for her in the bosom of retirement, in
the practice of every domestic virtue,
in the exertion of every amiable accomplishment,
exerted in the shade, to
enliven retirement, to heighten the
endearing pleasures of social intercourse,
and to embellish the narrow
but charming circle of family delights.
To this amiable purpose, a truly good
and well educated young lady will dedicate
her more elegant accomplishments,
instead of exhibiting them to attract
admiration, or depress inferiority.

Young
girls, who have more vivacity
than understanding, will often
[p 136]

make a sprightly figure in conversation.
But this agreeable talent for entertaining
others, is frequently dangerous to
themselves, nor is it by any means to
be desired or encouraged very early in
life. This immaturity of wit is helped
on by frivolous reading, which will
produce its effect in much less time
than books of solid instruction; for the
imagination is touched sooner than the
understanding; and effects are more
rapid as they are more pernicious.
Conversation should be the
result
of
education, not the
precursor
of it. It
is a golden fruit, when suffered to
grow gradually on the tree of knowledge;
but if precipitated by forced
and unnatural means, it will in the
end become vapid, in proportion as it
is artificial.
[p 137]

The
best effects of a careful and
religious education are often very remote:
they are to be discovered in
future scenes, and exhibited in untried
connexions. Every event of life will
be putting the heart into fresh situations,
and making demands on its
prudence, its firmness, its integrity,
or its piety. Those whose business it
is to form it, can foresee none of these
situations; yet, as far as human wisdom
will allow, they must enable it
to provide for them all, with an humble
dependence on the divine assistance.
A well-disciplined soldier must learn
and practise all his evolutions, though
he does not know on what service his
leader may command him, by what
foe he shall be attacked, nor what
mode of combat the enemy may
use.
[p 138]

One
great art of education consists
in not suffering the feelings to become
too acute by unnecessary awakening,
nor too obtuse by the want of exertion.
The former renders them the source
of calamity, and totally ruins the temper;
while the latter blunts and debases
them, and produces a dull, cold,
and selfish spirit. For the mind is an
instrument, which, if wound too high,
will lose its sweetness, and if not
enough strained, will abate of its vigour.

How
cruel is it to extinguish by
neglect or unkindness, the precious
sensibility of an open temper, to chill
the amiable glow of an ingenuous soul,
and to quench the bright flame of a
noble and generous spirit! These are
of higher worth than all the documents
of learning, of dearer price than all
[p 139]

the advantages, which can be derived
from the most refined and artificial
mode of education.

But
sensibility and delicacy, and an
ingenuous temper, make no part of
education, exclaims the pedagogue—they
are reducible to no class—they
come under no article of instruction—they
belong neither to languages nor
to music.—What an error! They
are

a part of education, and of infinitely
more value,

Than all their pedant discipline e'er knew.

It is true, they are ranged under no
class, but they are superior to all;
they are of more esteem than languages
or music, for they are the language of
the heart, and the music of the according
passions. Yet this sensibility is,
in many instances, so far from being
[p 140]

cultivated, that it is not uncommon
to see those who affect more than usual
sagacity, cast a smile of supercilious
pity, at any indication of a warm,
generous, or enthusiastic temper in the
lively and the young; as much as to
say, "they will know better, and will
have more discretion when they are
older." But every appearance of
amiable simplicity, or of honest shame,

Nature's hasty conscience
, will be dear
to sensible hearts; they will carefully
cherish every such indication in a
young female; for they will perceive
that it is this temper, wisely cultivated,
which will one day make her
enamoured of the loveliness of virtue,
and the beauty of holiness: from
which she will acquire a taste for the
doctrines of religion, and a spirit to
perform the duties of it. And those
who wish to make her ashamed of
[p 141]

this charming temper, and seek to dispossess
her of it, will, it is to be feared,
give her nothing better in exchange.
But whoever reflects at all, will easily
discern how carefully this enthusiasm
is to be directed, and how judiciously
its redundances are to be lopped
away.

Prudence
is not natural to children;
they can, however, substitute
art in its stead. But is it not much
better that a girl should discover the
faults incident to her age, than conceal
them under this dark and impenetrable
veil? I could almost venture
to assert, that there is something more
becoming in the very errors of nature,
where they are undisguised, than in the
affectation of virtue itself, where the
reality is wanting. And I am so far
from being an admirer of prodigies,
[p 142]

that I am extremely apt to suspect
them; and am always infinitely better
pleased with Nature in her more common
modes of operation. The precise
and premature wisdom, which some
girls have cunning enough to assume,
is of a more dangerous tendency than
any of their natural failings can be,
as it effectually covers those secret bad
dispositions, which, if they displayed
themselves, might be rectified. The
hypocrisy of assuming virtues which
are not inherent in the heart, prevents
the growth and disclosure of those real
ones, which it is the great end of education
to cultivate.

But
if the natural indications of the
temper are to be suppressed and stifled,
where are the diagnostics, by which
the state of the mind is to be known?
The wise Author of all things, who
[p 143]

did nothing in vain, doubtless intended
them as symptoms, by which to
judge of the diseases of the heart;
and it is impossible diseases should be
cured before they are known. If the
stream be so cut off as to prevent communication,
or so choked up as to
defeat discovery, how shall we ever
reach the source, out of which are the
issues of life?

This
cunning, which, of all the
different dispositions girls discover, is
most to be dreaded, is increased by
nothing so much as by fear. If those
about them express violent and unreasonable
anger at every trivial offence,
it will always promote this temper,
and will very frequently create it,
where there was a natural tendency to
frankness. The indiscreet transports
of rage, which many betray on every
[p 144]

slight occasion, and the little distinction
they make between venial errors
and premeditated crimes, naturally
dispose a child to conceal, what she
does not however care to suppress.
Anger in one will not remedy the faults
of another; for how can an instrument
of sin cure sin? If a girl is kept in
a state of perpetual and slavish terror,
she will perhaps have artifice enough
to conceal those propensities which
she knows are wrong, or those actions
which she thinks are most obnoxious
to punishment. But, nevertheless, she
will not cease to indulge those propensities,
and to commit those actions,
when she can do it with impunity.

Good

dispositions
, of themselves, will
go but a very little way, unless they
are confirmed into good
principles
.
And this cannot be effected but by a
[p 145]

careful course of religious instruction,
and a patient and laborious cultivation
of the moral temper.

But
, notwithstanding girls should
not be treated with unkindness, nor
the first openings of the passions blighted
by cold severity; yet I am of opinion,
that young females should be
accustomed very early in life to a certain
degree of restraint. The natural
cast of character, and the moral distinctions
between the sexes, should
not be disregarded, even in childhood.
That bold, independent, enterprising
spirit, which is so much admired in
boys, should not, when it happens to
discover itself in the other sex, be encouraged,
but suppressed. Girls should
be taught to give up their opinions
betimes, and not pertinaciously to carry
on a dispute, even if they should
[p 146]

know themselves to be in the right.
I do not mean, that they should be
robbed of the liberty of private judgment,
but that they should by no
means be encouraged to contract a
contentious or contradictory turn. It
is of the greatest importance to their
future happiness, that they should acquire
a submissive temper, and a forbearing
spirit: for it is a lesson which
the world will not fail to make them
frequently practise, when they come
abroad into it, and they will not practise
it the worse for having learnt it
the sooner. These early restraints, in
the limitation here meant, are so far
from being an effect of cruelty, that
they are the most indubitable marks of
affection, and are the more meritorious,
as they are severe trials of tenderness.
But all the beneficial effects, which a
mother can expect from this watch
[p 147]
fulness,
will be entirely defeated, if
it is practised occasionally, and not
habitually, and if it ever appears to
be used to gratify caprice, ill-humour,
or resentment.

Those
who have children to educate
ought to be extremely patient:
it is indeed a labour of love. They
should reflect, that extraordinary talents
are neither essential to the well-being
of society, nor to the happiness
of individuals. If that had been the
case, the beneficent Father of the universe
would not have made them so
rare. For it is as easy for an Almighty
Creator to produce a Newton, as an
ordinary man; and he could have made
those powers common which we now
consider as wonderful, without any
miraculous exertion of his omnipotence,
if the existence of many New
[p 148]
tons
had been necessary to the perfection
of his wise and gracious plan.

Surely
, therefore, there is more
piety, as well as more sense, in labouring
to improve the talents which children
actually have, than in lamenting
that they do not possess supernatural
endowments or angelic perfections. A
passage of Lord Bacon's furnishes an
admirable incitement for endeavouring
to carry the amiable and christian
grace of charity to its farthest extent,
instead of indulging an over-anxious
care for more brilliant but less important
acquisitions. "The desire of
power in excess (says he) caused the
angels to fall; the desire of knowledge
in excess caused man to fall;
but in charity is no excess, neither
can men nor angels come into danger
by it."
[p 149]

A girl
who has docility will seldom
be found to want understanding enough
for all the purposes of a social, a happy,
and an useful life. And when
we behold the tender hope of fond
and anxious love, blasted by disappointment,
the defect will as often be
discovered to proceed from the neglect
or the error of cultivation, as from the
natural temper; and those who lament
the evil, will sometimes be found to
have occasioned it.

It
is as injudicious for parents to set
out with too sanguine a dependence
on the merit of their children, as it is
for them to be discouraged at every
repulse. When their wishes are defeated
in this or that particular instance,
where they had treasured up
some darling expectation, this is so far
from being a reason for relaxing their
[p 150]

attention, that it ought to be an additional
motive for redoubling it. Those
who hope to do a great deal, must not
expect to do every thing. If they
know any thing of the malignity of
sin, the blindness of prejudice, or the
corruption of the human heart, they
will also know, that that heart will always
remain, after the very best possible
education, full of infirmity and imperfection.
Extraordinary allowances, therefore,
must be made for the weakness
of nature in this its weakest state. After
much is done, much will remain to
do, and much, very much, will still
be left undone. For this regulation
of the passions and affections cannot
be the work of education alone, without
the concurrence of divine grace
operating on the heart. Why then
should parents repine, if their efforts
are not always crowned with imme
[p 151]
diate
success? They should consider,
that they are not educating cherubims
and seraphims, but men and women;
creatures, who at their best estate are altogether
vanity: how little then can be
expected from them in the weakness
and imbecillity of infancy! I have dwelt
on this part of the subject the longer,
because I am certain that many, who
have set out with a warm and active
zeal, have cooled on the very first
discouragement, and have afterwards
almost totally remitted their vigilance,
through a criminal kind of despair.

Great
allowances must be made
for a profusion of gaiety, loquacity,
and even indiscretion in children, that
there may be animation enough left to
supply an active and useful character,
when the first fermentation of the
youthful passions is over, and the re
[p 152]
dundant
spirits shall come to subside.

If
it be true, as a consummate judge
of human nature has observed,

That not a vanity is given in vain,

it is also true, that there is scarcely a
single passion, which may not be turned
to some good account, if prudently
rectified, and skilfully turned into the
road of some neighbouring virtue. It
cannot be violently bent, or unnaturally
forced towards an object of a
totally opposite nature, but may be
gradually inclined towards a correspondent
but superior affection. Anger,
hatred, resentment, and ambition, the
most restless and turbulent passions
which shake and distract the human
soul, may be led to become the most
active opposers of sin, after having
[p 153]

been its most successful instruments.
Our anger, for instance, which can
never be totally subdued, may be made
to turn against ourselves, for our weak
and imperfect obedience—our hatred,
against every species of vice—our ambition,
which will not be discarded,
may be ennobled: it will not change
its name, but its object: it will despise
what it lately valued, nor be
contented to grasp at less than immortality.

Thus
the joys, fears, hopes, desires,
all the passions and affections, which
separate in various currents from the
soul, will, if directed into their proper
channels, after having fertilised
wherever they have flowed, return
again to swell and enrich the parent
source.
[p 154]

That
the very passions which appear
the most uncontroulable and unpromising,
may be intended, in the great
scheme of Providence, to answer some
important purpose, is remarkably evidenced
in the character and history
of Saint Paul. A remark on this subject
by an ingenious old Spanish writer,
which I will here take the liberty
to translate, will better illustrate my
meaning.

"
To
convert the bitterest enemy
into the most zealous advocate, is
the work of God for the instruction
of man. Plutarch has observed,
that the medical science would be
brought to the utmost perfection,
when poison should be converted
into physic. Thus, in the mortal
disease of Judaism and idolatry,
[p 155]

our blessed Lord converted the adder's
venom of Saul the persecutor,
into that cement which made Paul
the chosen vessel. That manly activity,
that restless ardor, that
burning zeal for the law of his
fathers, that ardent thirst for the
blood of Christians, did the Son
of God find necessary in the man
who was one day to become the
defender of his suffering people.
[7]
"

To
win the passions, therefore, over
to the cause of virtue, answers a much
nobler end than their extinction would
possibly do, even if that could be effected.
But it is their nature never
to observe a neutrality; they are either
rebels or auxiliaries, and an
enemy subdued is an ally obtained.
[p 156]

If I may be allowed to change the allusion
so soon, I would say, that the
passions also resemble fires, which are
friendly and beneficial when under proper
direction, but if suffered to blaze
without restraint, they carry devastation
along with them, and, if totally extinguished,
leave the benighted mind
in a state of cold and comfortless inanity.

But
in speaking of the usefulness
of the passions, as instruments of virtue,

envy
and
lying
must always be
excepted: these, I am persuaded, must
either go on in still progressive mischief,
or else be radically cured, before
any good can be expected from
the heart which has been infected with
them. For I never will believe that
envy, though passed through all the
moral strainers, can be refined into a
[p 157]

virtuous emulation, or lying improved
into an agreeable turn for innocent invention.
Almost all the other passions
may be made to take an amiable
hue; but these two must either be totally
extirpated, or be always contented
to preserve their original deformity,
and to wear their native black.

[p 158]

on the

IMPORTANCE
of
RELIGION

to the

FEMALE CHARACTER.

Various
are the reasons why
the greater part of mankind cannot
apply themselves to arts or letters.
Particular studies are only suited to
the capacities of particular persons.
Some are incapable of applying to
[p 159]

them from the delicacy of their sex,
some from the unsteadiness of youth,
and others from the imbecillity of age.
Many are precluded by the narrowness
of their education, and many by
the straitness of their fortune. The
wisdom of God is wonderfully manifested
in this happy and well-ordered
diversity, in the powers and properties
of his creatures; since by thus admirably
suiting the agent to the action,
the whole scheme of human affairs is
carried on with the most agreeing and
consistent [oe]conomy, and no chasm is
left for want of an object to fill it, exactly
suited to its nature.

But
in the great and universal concern
of religion, both sexes, and all
ranks, are equally interested. The
truly catholic spirit of christianity accommodates
itself, with an astonish
[p 160]
ing
condescension, to the circumstances
of the whole human race. It rejects
none on account of their pecuniary
wants, their personal infirmities, or
their intellectual deficiencies. No superiority
of parts is the least recommendation,
nor is any depression of
fortune the smallest objection. None
are too wise to be excused from performing
the duties of religion, nor are
any too poor to be excluded from the
consolations of its promises.

If
we admire the wisdom of God,
in having furnished different degrees
of intelligence, so exactly adapted to
their different destinations, and in having
fitted every part of his stupendous work,
not only to serve its own immediate
purpose, but also to contribute to the
beauty and perfection of the whole:
how much more ought we to adore
[p 161]

that goodness, which has perfected the
divine plan, by appointing one wide,
comprehensive, and universal means
of salvation: a salvation, which all
are invited to partake; by a means
which all are capable of using; which
nothing but voluntary blindness can
prevent our comprehending, and nothing
but wilful error can hinder us
from embracing.

The
Muses are coy, and will only
be wooed and won by some highly-favoured
suitors. The Sciences are
lofty, and will not stoop to the reach
of ordinary capacities. But "Wisdom
(by which the royal preacher
means piety) is a loving spirit: she
is easily seen of them that love her,
and found of all such as seek her."
Nay, she is so accessible and condescending,
"that she preventeth them
[p 162]

that desire her, making herself first
known unto them."

We
are told by the same animated
writer, "that Wisdom is the breath
of the power of God." How infinitely
superior, in grandeur and sublimity,
is this description to the origin
of the
wisdom
of the heathens, as described
by their poets and mythologists!
In the exalted strains of the Hebrew
poetry we read, that "Wisdom is the
brightness of the everlasting light,
the unspotted mirror of the power
of God, and the image of his goodness."

The
philosophical author of
The
Defence of Learning
observes, that
knowledge has something of venom
and malignity in it, when taken without
its proper corrective, and what
[p 163]

that is, the inspired Saint Paul teaches
us, by placing it as the immediate antidote:

Knowledge puffeth up, but charity
edifieth.
Perhaps, it is the vanity
of human wisdom, unchastised by this
correcting principle, which has made
so many infidels. It may proceed from
the arrogance of a self-sufficient pride,
that some philosophers disdain to acknowledge
their belief in a being, who
has judged proper to conceal from
them the infinite wisdom of his counsels;
who, (to borrow the lofty language
of the man of Uz) refused to
consult them when he laid the foundations
of the earth, when he shut up
the sea with doors, and made the
clouds the garment thereof.

A man
must be an infidel either
from pride, prejudice, or bad education:
he cannot be one unawares or
[p 164]

by surprise; for infidelity is not occasioned
by sudden impulse or violent
temptation. He may be hurried by
some vehement desire into an immoral
action, at which he will blush in his
cooler moments, and which he will
lament as the sad effect of a spirit unsubdued
by religion; but infidelity is
a calm, considerate act, which cannot
plead the weakness of the heart, or
the seduction of the senses. Even
good men frequently fail in their duty
through the infirmities of nature, and
the allurements of the world; but the
infidel errs on a plan, on a settled and
deliberate principle.

But
though the minds of men are
sometimes fatally infected with this
disease, either through unhappy prepossession,
or some of the other causes
above mentioned; yet I am unwilling
[p 165]

to believe, that there is in nature so
monstrously incongruous a being, as
a
female infidel
. The least reflexion on
the temper, the character, and the
education of women, makes the mind
revolt with horror from an idea so improbable,
and so unnatural.

May
I be allowed to observe, that,
in general, the minds of girls seem
more aptly prepared in their early
youth for the reception of serious
impressions than those of the other sex,
and that their less exposed situations
in more advanced life qualify them
better for the preservation of them?
The daughters (of good parents I
mean) are often more carefully instructed
in their religious duties, than
the sons, and this from a variety of
causes. They are not so soon sent
from under the paternal eye into the
[p 166]

bustle of the world, and so early exposed
to the contagion of bad example:
their hearts are naturally more
flexible, soft, and liable to any kind
of impression the forming hand may
stamp on them; and, lastly, as they
do not receive the same classical education
with boys, their feeble minds
are not obliged at once to receive and
separate the precepts of christianity,
and the documents of pagan philosophy.
The necessity of doing this perhaps
somewhat weakens the serious
impressions of young men, at least till
the understanding is formed, and confuses
their ideas of piety, by mixing
them with so much heterogeneous
matter. They only casually read, or
hear read, the scriptures of truth,
while they are obliged to learn by
heart, construe and repeat the poetical
fables of the less than human gods
[p 167]

of the ancients. And as the excellent author
of
The Internal Evidence of the Christian
Religion
observes, "Nothing has
so much contributed to corrupt the
true spirit of the christian institution,
as that partiality which we contract,
in our earliest education, for the
manners of pagan antiquity."

Girls
, therefore, who do
not
contract
this early partiality, ought to
have a clearer notion of their religious
duties: they are not obliged, at an
age when the judgment is so weak,
to distinguish between the doctrines
of Zeno, of Epicurus, and of Christ;
and to embarrass their minds with the
various morals which were taught in
the
Porch
, in the
Academy
, and on the

Mount
.
[p 168]

It
is presumed, that these remarks
cannot possibly be so misunderstood,
as to be construed into the least disrespect
to literature, or a want of the
highest reverence for a learned education,
the basis of all elegant knowledge:
they are only intended, with
all proper deference, to point out to
young women, that however inferior
their advantages of acquiring a knowledge
of the belles-lettres are to those
of the other sex; yet it depends on
themselves not to be surpassed in this
most important of all studies, for
which their abilities are equal, and
their opportunities, perhaps, greater.

But
the mere exemption from infidelity
is so small a part of the religious
character, that I hope no one
will attempt to claim any merit from
this negative sort of goodness, or va
[p 169]
lue
herself merely for not being the
very worst thing she possibly can be.
Let no mistaken girl fancy she gives
a proof of her wit by her want of piety,
or that a contempt of things serious
and sacred will exalt her understanding,
or raise her character even in the
opinion of the most avowed male infidels.
For one may venture to affirm,
that with all their profligate ideas,
both of women and of religion, neither
Bolingbroke, Wharton, Buckingham,
nor even
Lord Chesterfield himself
, would
have esteemed a woman the more for
her being irreligious.

With
whatever ridicule a polite
freethinker may affect to treat religion
himself, he will think it necessary his
wife should entertain different notions
of it. He may pretend to despise it
as a matter of opinion, depending on
[p 170]

creeds and systems; but, if he is a
man of sense, he will know the value
of it, as a governing principle, which
is to influence her conduct and direct
her actions. If he sees her unaffectedly
sincere in the practice of her religious
duties, it will be a secret pledge
to him, that she will be equally exact
in fulfilling the conjugal; for he can
have no reasonable dependance on her
attachment to
him
, if he has no opinion
of her fidelity to
God
; for she
who neglects first duties, gives but an
indifferent proof of her disposition to
fill up inferior ones; and how can a
man of any understanding (whatever
his own religious professions may be)
trust that woman with the care of his
family, and the education of his children,
who wants herself the best incentive
to a virtuous life, the belief
that she is an accountable creature,
[p 171]

and the reflection that she has an immortal
soul?

Cicero
spoke it as the highest commendation
of Cato's character, that
he embraced philosophy, not for the
sake of
disputing
like a philosopher,
but of
living
like one. The chief purpose
of christian knowledge is to promote
the great end of a christian life.
Every rational woman should, no
doubt, be able to give a reason of
the hope that is in her; but this knowledge
is best acquired, and the duties
consequent on it best performed, by
reading books of plain piety and practical
devotion, and not by entering
into the endless feuds, and engaging
in the unprofitable contentions of partial
controversialists. Nothing is more
unamiable than the narrow spirit of
party zeal, nor more disgusting than
[p 172]

to hear a woman deal out judgments,
and denounce vengeance against any
one, who happens to differ from her
in some opinion, perhaps of no real
importance, and which, it is probable,
she may be just as wrong in rejecting,
as the object of her censure is
in embracing. A furious and unmerciful
female bigot wanders as far beyond
the limits prescribed to her sex,
as a Thalestris or a Joan d'Arc. Violent
debate has made as few converts
as the sword, and both these instruments
are particularly unbecoming
when wielded by a female hand.

But
, though no one will be frightened
out of their opinions, yet they
may be persuaded out of them: they
may be touched by the affecting earnestness
of serious conversation, and
allured by the attractive beauty of a
[p 173]

consistently serious life. And while
a young woman ought to dread the
name of a wrangling polemic, it is her
duty to aspire after the honourable
character of a sincere Christian. But
this dignified character she can by no
means deserve, if she is ever afraid to
avow her principles, or ashamed to
defend them. A profligate, who makes
it a point to ridicule every thing which
comes under the appearance of formal
instruction, will be disconcerted at the
spirited yet modest rebuke of a pious
young woman. But there is as much
efficacy in the manner of reproving
prophaneness, as in the words. If she
corrects it with moroseness, she defeats
the effect of her remedy, by her unskilful
manner of administring it. If,
on the other hand, she affects to defend
the insulted cause of God, in a
faint tone of voice, and studied ambi
[p 174]
guity
of phrase, or with an air of levity,
and a certain expression of pleasure
in her eyes, which proves she is
secretly delighted with what she pretends
to censure, she injures religion
much more than he did who publickly
prophaned it; for she plainly indicates,
either that she does not believe, or
respect what she professes. The other
attacked it as an open foe; she betrays
it as a false friend. No one pays any
regard to the opinion of an avowed
enemy; but the desertion or treachery
of a professed friend, is dangerous indeed!

It
is a strange notion which prevails
in the world, that religion only belongs
to the old and the melancholy,
and that it is not worth while to pay
the least attention to it, while we are
capable of attending to any thing else.
[p 175]

They allow it to be proper enough
for the clergy, whose business it
is, and for the aged, who have not
spirits for any business at all. But till
they can prove, that none except the
clergy and the aged
die
, it must be
confessed, that this is most wretched
reasoning.

Great
injury is done to the interests
of religion, by placing it in a
gloomy and unamiable light. It is
sometimes spoken of, as if it would
actually make a handsome woman ugly,
or a young one wrinkled. But can
any thing be more absurd than to represent
the beauty of holiness as the
source of deformity?

There
are few, perhaps, so entirely
plunged in business, or absorbed in
[p 176]

pleasure, as not to intend, at some
future time, to set about a religious
life in good earnest. But then they
consider it as a kind of
dernier ressort
,
and think it prudent to defer flying to
this disagreeable refuge, till they have
no relish left for any thing else. Do
they forget, that to perform this great
business well requires all the strength
of their youth, and all the vigour of
their unimpaired capacities? To confirm
this assertion, they may observe
how much the slightest indisposition,
even in the most active season of
life, disorders every faculty, and disqualifies
them for attending to the
most ordinary affairs: and then let
them reflect how little able they will
be to transact the most important of
all business, in the moment of excruciating
pain, or in the day of universal
debility.
[p 177]

When
the senses are palled with
excessive gratification; when the eye
is tired with seeing, and the ear with
hearing; when the spirits are so sunk,
that the
grasshopper is become a burthen
,
how shall the blunted apprehension be
capable of understanding a new science,
or the worn-out heart be able to relish
a new pleasure?

To
put off religion till we have lost
all taste for amusement; to refuse listening
to the "voice of the charmer,"
till our enfeebled organs can no longer
listen to the voice of "singing men
and singing women," and not to
devote our days to heaven till we
have "no pleasure in them" ourselves,
is but an ungracious offering. And
it is a wretched sacrifice to the God of
heaven, to present him with the remnants
of decayed appetites, and the
leavings of extinguished passions.
[p 178]

MISCELLANEOUS

OBSERVATIONS

on

GENIUS, TASTE, GOOD

SENSE, &c.

[8]

Good

sense
is as different from

genius
as perception is from invention;
yet, though distinct qualities,
[p 179]

they frequently subsist together. It
is altogether opposite to
wit
, but by
no means inconsistent with it. It is
not science, for there is such a thing
as unlettered good sense; yet, though
it is neither wit, learning, nor genius,
it is a substitute for each, where they
do not exist, and the perfection of all
where they do.

Good sense is so far from deserving
the appellation of
common sense
, by
which it is frequently called, that it is
perhaps one of the rarest qualities of
the human mind. If, indeed, this
name is given it in respect to its peculiar
suitableness to the purposes of
common life, there is great propriety
[p 180]

in it. Good sense appears to differ
from taste in this, that taste is an instantaneous
decision of the mind, a
sudden relish of what is beautiful, or
disgust at what is defective, in an object,
without waiting for the slower
confirmation of the judgment. Good
sense is perhaps that confirmation,
which establishes a suddenly conceived
idea, or feeling, by the powers of
comparing and reflecting. They differ
also in this, that taste seems to have
a more immediate reference to arts,
to literature, and to almost every object
of the senses; while good sense
rises to moral excellence, and exerts
its influence on life and manners. Taste
is fitted to the perception and enjoyment
of whatever is beautiful in art
or nature: Good sense, to the improvement
of the conduct, and the regulation
of the heart.
[p 181]

Yet
the term good sense, is used indiscriminately
to express either a finished
taste for letters, or an invariable
prudence in the affairs of life. It is
sometimes applied to the most moderate
abilities, in which case, the expression
is certainly too strong; and at
others to the most shining, when it is
as much too weak and inadequate. A
sensible man is the usual, but unappropriated
phrase, for every degree in the
scale of understanding, from the sober
mortal, who obtains it by his decent
demeanor and solid dullness, to him
whose talents qualify him to rank with
a Bacon, a Harris, or a Johnson.

Genius
is the power of invention
and imitation. It is an incommunicable
faculty: no art or skill of the
possessor can bestow the smallest portion
of it on another: no pains or la
[p 182]
bour
can reach the summit of perfection,
where the seeds of it are wanting
in the mind; yet it is capable of
infinite improvement where it actually
exists, and is attended with the highest
capacity of communicating instruction,
as well as delight to others.

It
is the peculiar property of genius
to strike out great or beautiful things:
it is the felicity of good sense not to do
absurd ones. Genius breaks out in
splendid sentiments and elevated ideas;
good sense confines its more circumscribed,
but perhaps more useful walk,
within the limits of prudence and propriety.

The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling,

Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;

And, as imagination bodies forth

The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen

[p 183]
Turns them to shape, and gives to airy nothing

A local habitation and a name.

This
is perhaps the finest picture of
human genius that ever was drawn by
a human pencil. It presents a living
image of a creative imagination, or a
power of inventing things which have
no actual existence.

With
superficial judges, who, it
must be confessed, make up the greater
part of the mass of mankind, talents
are only liked or understood to a certain
degree. Lofty ideas are above
the reach of ordinary apprehensions:
the vulgar allow those who possess them
to be in a somewhat higher state of
mind than themselves; but of the vast
gulf which separates them, they have
not the least conception. They acknowledge
a superiority, but of its
extent they neither know the value,
[p 184]

nor can conceive the reality. It is
true, the mind, as well as the eye,
can take in objects larger than itself;
but this is only true of great minds:
for a man of low capacity, who considers
a consummate genius, resembles
one, who seeing a column for the first
time, and standing at too great a distance
to take in the whole of it, concludes
it to be flat. Or, like one
unacquainted with the first principles
of philosophy, who, finding the sensible
horizon appear a plain surface,
can form no idea of the spherical form
of the whole, which he does not see,
and laughs at the account of antipodes,
which he cannot comprehend.

Whatever
is excellent is also rare;
what is useful is more common. How
many thousands are born qualified for
the coarse employments of life, for
[p 185]

one who is capable of excelling in the
fine arts! yet so it ought to be, because
our natural wants are more numerous,
and more importunate, than
the intellectual.

Whenever
it happens that a man
of distinguished talents has been drawn
by mistake, or precipitated by passion,
into any dangerous indiscretion; it is
common for those whose coldness of
temper has supplied the place, and
usurped the name of prudence, to
boast of their own steadier virtue, and
triumph in their own superior caution;
only because they have never been assailed
by a temptation strong enough
to surprise them into error. And with
what a visible appropriation of the character
to themselves, do they constantly
conclude, with a cordial compliment
to
common sense
! They point out the
[p 186]

beauty and usefulness of this quality
so forcibly and explicitly, that you
cannot possibly mistake whose picture
they are drawing with so flattering a
pencil. The unhappy man whose conduct
has been so feelingly arraigned,
perhaps acted from good, though mistaken
motives; at least, from motives
of which his censurer has not capacity
to judge: but the event was unfavourable,
nay the action might be really
wrong, and the vulgar maliciously take
the opportunity of this single indiscretion,
to lift themselves nearer on a
level with a character, which, except
in this instance, has always thrown
them at the most disgraceful and mortifying
distance.

The
elegant Biographer of Collins,
in his affecting apology for that unfortunate
genius, remarks, "That the
[p 187]

gifts of imagination bring the heaviest
task on the vigilance of reason; and
to bear those faculties with unerring
rectitude, or invariable propriety,
requires a degree of firmness, and of
cool attention, which does not always
attend the higher gifts of the
mind; yet difficult as Nature herself
seems to have rendered the task of
regularity to genius, it is the supreme
consolation of dullness, and
of folly to point with gothic triumph
to those excesses which are the
overflowing of faculties they never
enjoyed."

What
the greater part of the world
mean by common sense, will be generally
found, on a closer enquiry, to be
art, fraud, or selfishness! That sort of
saving prudence which makes men extremely
attentive to their own safety,
[p 188]

or profit; diligent in the pursuit of
their own pleasures or interests; and
perfectly at their ease as to what becomes
of the rest of mankind. Furies,
where their own property is concerned,
philosophers when nothing but the
good of others is at stake, and perfectly
resigned under all calamities but
their own.

When
we see so many accomplished
wits of the present age, as remarkable
for the decorum of their lives, as for
the brilliancy of their writings, we may
believe, that, next to principle, it is
owing to their
good sense
, which regulates
and chastises their imaginations.
The vast conceptions which enable a
true genius to ascend the sublimest
heights, may be so connected with the
stronger passions, as to give it a natural
tendency to fly off from the strait
[p 189]

line of regularity; till good sense, acting
on the fancy, makes it gravitate
powerfully towards that virtue which
is its proper centre.

Add
to this, when it is considered
with what imperfection the Divine
Wisdom has thought fit to stamp every
thing human, it will be found, that
excellence and infirmity are so inseparably
wound up in each other, that a
man derives the soreness of temper,
and irritability of nerve, which make
him uneasy to others, and unhappy in
himself, from those exquisite feelings,
and that elevated pitch of thought, by
which, as the apostle expresses it on a
more serious occasion, he is, as it were,
out of the body.

It is not astonishing, therefore, when

the
spirit is carried away by the magnificence
of its own ideas,
[p 190]

Not touch'd but rapt, not waken'd but inspir'd,

that the frail body, which is the natural
victim of pain, disease, and death,
should not always be able to follow
the mind in its aspiring flights, but
should be as imperfect as if it belonged
only to an ordinary soul.

Besides
, might not Providence intend
to humble human pride, by presenting
to our eyes so mortifying a view of the
weakness and infirmity of even his best
work? Perhaps man, who is already
but a little lower than the angels,
might, like the revolted spirits, totally
have shaken off obedience and submission
to his Creator, had not God
wisely tempered human excellence with
a certain consciousness of its own imperfection.
But though this inevitable
alloy of weakness may frequently be
[p 191]

found in the best characters, yet how
can that be the source of triumph and
exaltation to any, which, if properly
weighed, must be the deepest motive
of humiliation to all? A good-natured
man will be so far from rejoicing, that
he will be secretly troubled, whenever he
reads that the greatest Roman moralist
was tainted with avarice, and the
greatest British philosopher with venality.

It
is remarked by Pope, in his Essay
on Criticism, that,

Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss.

But I apprehend it does not therefore
follow that to judge, is more difficult
than to write. If this were the case,
the critic would be superior to the
poet, whereas it appears to be directly
[p 192]

the contrary. "The critic, (says the
great champion of Shakespeare,) but
fashions the body of a work, the poet
must add the soul, which gives force
and direction to its actions and gestures."
It should seem that the reason why so
many more judge wrong, than write
ill, is because the number of readers
is beyond all proportion greater than
the number of writers. Every man
who reads, is in some measure a critic,
and, with very common abilities, may
point out real faults and material errors
in a very well written book; but
it by no means follows that he is able
to write any thing comparable to the
work which he is capable of censuring.
And unless the numbers of those who
write, and of those who judge, were
more equal, the calculation seems not
to be quite fair.
[p 193]

A capacity
for relishing works of
genius is the indubitable sign of a good
taste. But if a proper disposition and
ability to enjoy the compositions of
others, entitle a man to the claim of
reputation, it is still a far inferior degree
of merit to his who can invent and
produce those compositions, the bare
disquisition of which gives the critic
no small share of fame.

The
president of the royal academy
in his admirable
Discourse
on
imitation
,
has set the folly of depending on unassisted
genius, in the clearest light; and
has shewn the necessity of adding the
knowledge of others, to our own native
powers, in his usual striking and masterly
manner. "The mind, says he, is a
barren soil, is a soil soon exhausted,
and will produce no crop, or only
one, unless it be continually fertiliz
[p 194]
ed,
and enriched with foreign matter."

Yet
it has been objected that study
is a great enemy to originality; but
even if this were true, it would perhaps
be as well that an author should
give us the ideas of still better writers,
mixed and assimilated with the matter
in his own mind, as those crude and
undigested thoughts which he values
under the notion that they are original.
The sweetest honey neither tastes of the
rose, the honeysuckle, nor the carnation,
yet it is compounded of the very
essence of them all.

If
in the other fine arts this accumulation
of knowledge is necessary,
it is indispensably so in poetry. It is a
fatal rashness for any one to trust too
much to their own stock of ideas.
[p 195]

He must invigorate them by exercise,
polish them by conversation, and increase
them by every species of elegant
and virtuous knowledge, and the mind
will not fail to reproduce with interest
those seeds, which are sown in it by
study and observation. Above all,
let every one guard against the dangerous
opinion that he knows enough:
an opinion that will weaken the energy
and reduce the powers of the mind,
which, though once perhaps vigorous
and effectual, will be sunk to a state
of literary imbecility, by cherishing
vain and presumptuous ideas of its
own independence.

For
instance, it may not be necessary
that a poet should be deeply skilled in
the Linnæan system; but it must be
allowed that a general acquaintance
with plants and flowers will furnish
[p 196]

him with a delightful and profitable species
of instruction. He is not obliged to
trace Nature in all her nice and varied
operations, with the minute accuracy
of a Boyle, or the laborious investigation
of a Newton; but his
good sense

will point out to him that no inconsiderable
portion of philosophical knowledge
is requisite to the completion of
his literary character. The sciences
are more independent, and require
little or no assistance from the graces
of poetry; but poetry, if she would
charm and instruct, must not be so
haughty; she must be contented to
borrow of the sciences, many of her
choicest allusions, and many of her
most graceful embellishments; and does
it not magnify the character of true
poesy, that she includes within herself
all the scattered graces of every separate
art?
[p 197]

The
rules of the great masters in
criticism may not be so necessary to
the forming a good taste, as the examination
of those original mines
from whence they drew their treasures
of knowledge.

The
three celebrated Essays on the
Art of Poetry do not teach so much
by their laws as by their examples;
the dead letter of their rules is less instructive
than the living spirit of their
verse. Yet these rules are to a young
poet, what the study of logarithms is
to a young mathematician; they do
not so much contribute to form his
judgment, as afford him the satisfaction
of convincing him that he is right.
They do not preclude the difficulty of
the operation; but at the conclusion of
it, furnish him with a fuller demonstration
that he has proceeded on pro
[p 198]
per
principles. When he has well
studied the masters in whose schools
the first critics formed themselves, and
fancies he has caught a spark of their
divine Flame, it may be a good method
to try his own compositions by
the test of the critic rules, so far indeed
as the mechanism of poetry goes.
If the examination be fair and candid,
this trial, like the touch of Ithuriel's
spear, will detect every latent error, and
bring to light every favourite failing.

Good
taste always suits the measure
of its admiration to the merit of the
composition it examines. It accommodates
its praises, or its censure, to
the excellence of a work, and appropriates
it to the nature of it. General
applause, or indiscriminate abuse, is
the sign of a vulgar understanding.
There are certain blemishes which the
[p 199]

judicious and good-natured reader will
candidly overlook. But the false sublime,
the tumour which is intended
for greatness, the distorted figure, the
puerile conceit, and the incongruous
metaphor, these are defects for which
scarcely any other kind of merit can
atone. And yet there may be more
hope of a writer (especially if he be a
a young one), who is now and then
guilty of some of these faults, than of
one who avoids them all, not through
judgment, but feebleness, and who,
instead of deviating into error is continually
falling short of excellence.
The meer absence of error implies that
moderate and inferior degree of merit
with which a cold heart and a phlegmatic
taste will be better satisfied than
with the magnificent irregularities of
exalted spirits. It stretches some minds
to an uneasy extension to be obliged
[p 200]

to attend to compositions superlatively
excellent; and it contracts liberal souls
to a painful narrowness to descend to
books of inferior merit. A work of
capital genius, to a man of an ordinary
mind, is the bed of Procrustes to one
of a short stature, the man is too little
to fill up the space assigned him, and
undergoes the torture in attempting
it: and a moderate, or low production
to a man of bright talents, is the punishment
inflicted by Mezentius; the
living spirit has too much animation to
endure patiently to be in contact with
a dead body.

Taste
sesms to be a sentiment of
the soul which gives the bias to opinion,
for we feel before we reflect. Without
this sentiment, all knowledge, learning
and opinion, would be cold, inert
materials, whereas they become active
[p 201]

principles when stirred, kindled, and
inflamed by this animating quality.

There
is another feeling which is
called Enthusiasm. The enthusiasm
of sensible hearts is so strong, that it
not only yields to the impulse with
which striking objects act on it, but
such hearts help on the effect by their
own sensibility. In a scene where
Shakespeare and Garrick give perfection
to each other, the feeling heart
does not merely accede to the delirium
they occasion: it does more, it is enamoured
of it, it solicits the delusion,
it sues to be deceived, and grudgingly
cherishes the sacred treasure of its feelings.
The poet and performer concur
in carrying us

Beyond this visible diurnal sphere,

they bear us aloft in their airy
course with unresisted rapidity, if
they meet not with any obstruction
[p 202]

from the coldness of our own feelings.
Perhaps, only a few fine spirits can
enter into the detail of their writing
and acting; but the multitude do not
enjoy less acutely, because they are
not able philosophically to analyse the
sources of their joy or sorrow. If the
others have the advantage of judging,
these have at least the privilege of
feeling: and it is not from complaisance
to a few leading judges, that they
burst into peals of laughter, or melt
into delightful agony; their hearts decide,
and that is a decision from which
there lies no appeal. It must however
be confessed, that the nicer separations
of character, and the lighter
and almost imperceptible shades which
sometimes distinguish them, will not
be intimately relished, unless there be
a consonancy of taste as well as feeling
in the spectator; though where the
[p 203]

passions are principally concerned, the
profane vulgar come in for a larger
portion of the universal delight, than
critics and connoisseurs are willing to
allow them.

Yet
enthusiasm, though the natural
concomitant of genius, is no more
genius itself, than drunkenness is cheerfulness;
and that enthusiasm which
discovers itself on occasions not worthy
to excite it, is the mark of a wretched
judgment and a false taste.

Nature
produces innumerable objects:
to imitate them, is the province
of Genius; to direct those imitations,
is the property of Judgment; to decide
on their effects, is the business of Taste.
For Taste, who sits as supreme judge
on the productions of Genius, is not
satisfied when she merely imitates Na
[p 204]
ture:
she must also, says an ingenious
French writer, imitate
beautiful

Nature. It requires no less judgment
to reject than to choose, and Genius
might imitate what is vulgar, under
pretence that it was natural, if Taste
did not carefully point out those objects
which are most proper for imitation.
It also requires a very nice discernment
to distinguish verisimilitude
from truth; for there is a truth in
Taste nearly as conclusive as demonstration
in mathematics.

Genius
, when in the full impetuosity
of its career, often touches on the
very brink of error; and is, perhaps,
never so near the verge of the precipice,
as when indulging its sublimest
flights. It is in those great, but dangerous
moments, that the curb of
vigilant judgment is most wanting:
[p 205]

while safe and sober Dulness observes
one tedious and insipid round of tiresome
uniformity, and steers equally
clear of eccentricity and of beauty.
Dulness has few redundancies to retrench,
few luxuriancies to prune, and
few irregularities to smooth. These,
though errors, are the errors of Genius,
for there is rarely redundancy
without plenitude, or irregularity without
greatness. The excesses of Genius
may easily be retrenched, but the deficiencies
of Dulness can never be supplied.

Those
who copy from others will
doubtless be less excellent than those
who copy from Nature. To imitate
imitators, is the way to depart too far
from the great original herself. The
latter copies of an engraving retain
fainter and fainter traces of the sub
[p 206]
ject,
to which the earlier impressions
bore so strong a resemblance.

It
seems very extraordinary, that it
should be the most difficult thing in
the world to be natural, and that it
should be harder to hit off the manners
of real life, and to delineate such characters
as we converse with every day,
than to imagine such as do not exist.
But caricature is much easier than an
exact outline, and the colouring of
fancy less difficult than that of truth.

People
do not always know what taste
they have, till it is awakened by some
corresponding object; nay, genius itself
is a fire, which in many minds
would never blaze, if not kindled by
some external cause.

Nature
, that munificent mother,
when she bestows the power of judg
[p 207]
ing,
accompanies it with the capacity
of enjoying. The judgment, which
is clear sighted, points out such objects
as are calculated to inspire love, and
the heart instantaneously attaches itself
to whatever is lovely.

In
regard to literary reputation, a
great deal depends on the state of
learning in the particular age or nation,
in which an author lives. In a
dark and ignorant period, moderate
knowledge will entitle its possessor to
a considerable share of fame; whereas,
to be distinguished in a polite and lettered
age, requires striking parts and
deep erudition.

When
a nation begins to emerge
from a state of mental darkness, and to
strike out the first rudiments of improvement,
it chalks out a few strong
[p 208]

but incorrect sketches, gives the rude
out-lines of general art, and leaves the
filling up to the leisure of happier
days, and the refinement of more enlightened
times. Their drawing is a
rude
Sbozzo
, and their poetry wild
minstrelsy.

Perfection
of taste is a point which
a nation no sooner reaches, than it
overshoots; and it is more difficult to
return to it, after having passed it,
than it was to attain when they fell
short of it. Where the arts begin to
languish after having flourished, they
seldom indeed fall back to their original
barbarism, but a certain feebleness
of exertion takes place, and it is more
difficult to recover them from this
dying languor to their proper strength,
than it was to polish them from their
former rudeness; for it is a less for
[p 209]
midable
undertaking to refine barbarity,
than to stop decay: the first may
be laboured into elegance, but the
latter will rarely be strengthened into
vigour.

Taste
exerts itself at first but feebly
and imperfectly: it is repressed and kept
back by a crowd of the most discouraging
prejudices: like an infant
prince, who, though born to reign,
yet holds an idle sceptre, which he has
not power to use, but is obliged to see
with the eyes, and hear through the
ears of other men.

A writer
of correct taste will hardly
ever go out of his way, even in
search of embellishment: he will study
to attain the best end by the most natural
means; for he knows that what
is not natural cannot be beautiful, and
[p 210]

that nothing can be beautiful out of
its own place; for an improper situation
will convert the most striking
beauty into a glaring defect. When
by a well-connected chain of ideas,
or a judicious succession of events, the
reader is snatched to "Thebes or
Athens," what can be more impertinent
than for the poet to obstruct the
operation of the passion he has just
been kindling, by introducing a conceit
which contradicts his purpose,
and interrupts his business? Indeed,
we cannot be transported, even in
idea, to those places, if the poet does
not manage so adroitly as not to make
us sensible of the journey: the instant
we feel we are travelling, the writer's
art fails, and the delirium is at an end.

Proserpine
, says Ovid, would have
been restored to her mother Ceres, had
[p 211]

not Ascalaphus seen her stop to gather
a golden apple, when the terms of her
restoration were, that she should taste
nothing. A story pregnant with instruction
for lively writers, who by
neglecting the main business, and going
out of the way for false gratifications,
lose sight of the end they should
principally keep in view. It was this
false taste that introduced the numberless

concetti
, which disgrace the brightest
of the Italian poets; and this is the
reason, why the reader only feels short
and interrupted snatches of delight in
perusing the brilliant but unequal
compositions of Ariosto, instead of
that unbroken and undiminished pleasure,
which he constantly receives from
Virgil, from Milton, and generally
from Tasso. The first-mentioned Italian
is the Atalanta, who will interrupt
the most eager career, to pick up the
[p 212]

glittering mischief, while the Mantuan
and the British bards, like Hippomenes,
press on warm in the pursuit,
and unseduced by temptation.

A writer
of real taste will take
great pains in the perfection of his style,
to make the reader believe that he took
none at all. The writing which appears
to be most easy, will be generally
found to be least imitable. The
most elegant verses are the most easily
retained, they fasten themselves on the
memory, without its making any effort
to preserve them, and we are apt to imagine,
that what is remembered with
ease, was written without difficulty.

To conclude; Genius is a rare and
precious gem, of which few know
the worth; it is fitter for the cabinet
of the connoisseur, than for the com
[p 213]
merce
of mankind. Good sense is a
bank-bill, convenient for change, negotiable
at all times, and current in
all places. It knows the value of
small things, and considers that an
aggregate of them makes up the sum
of human affairs. It elevates common
concerns into matters of importance,
by performing them in the best manner,
and at the most suitable season.
Good sense carries with it the idea of
equality, while Genius is always suspected
of a design to impose the burden
of superiority; and respect is paid to
it with that reluctance which always
attends other imposts, the lower orders
of mankind generally repining
most at demands, by which they are
least liable to be affected.

As
it is the character of Genius to
penetrate with a lynx's beam into
[p 214]

unfathomable abysses and uncreated
worlds, and to see what is
not
, so it
is the property of good sense to distinguish
perfectly, and judge accurately
what really
is
. Good sense has not so
piercing an eye, but it has as clear a
sight: it does not penetrate so deeply,
but as far as it
does
see, it discerns
distinctly. Good sense is a judicious
mechanic, who can produce beauty
and convenience out of suitable means;
but Genius (I speak with reverence of
the immeasurable distance) bears some
remote resemblance to the divine architect,
who produced perfection of
beauty without any visible materials,

who spake, and it was created
; who
said,
Let it be, and it was
.

The
Author begs leave to offer an apology for
introducing this Essay, which, she fears, may be thought
foreign to her purpose. But she hopes that her earnest
desire of exciting a taste for literature in young ladies,
(which encouraged her to hazard the following remarks)
will not
obstruct
her general design, even if it does
not actually
promote
it.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

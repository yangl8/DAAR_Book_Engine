CUSSONS’

HORNCASTLE

COMPENDIUM.

1837.

LINCOLNSHIRE.

On the north, Lincolnshire is bounded by the Humber, which
separates it from Yorkshire: the German Ocean and an arm of the
sea called the Wash, bound it on the East; on the South it abuts
on Rutlandshire, Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire, its general
form is an irregular oblong.  It is in the Province of
Canterbury, the Diocese of Lincoln, and in the Midland
Circuit.

Lincolnshire being proverbially a County of Fens, has obtained
a name for an unhealthy climate, which, however, just it may have
been in some parts in bygone times, is now by no means
applicable; for the causes of the cold, damp and aguish
character, have been for many years declining: the progress of
drainage, and a more complete cultivation, have gradually
contributed to render the air more dry, and consequently more
healthy.  This remark may be made relative to all districts,
which become more salubrious in proportion as they are more
cultivated; and more friendly to human life, in proportion as the
means of supporting human life are increased in
productiveness.  The centre of the County and the district
of the Trent is very healthy: the air on the coast is very
salubrious, and numbers flock to it every summer in search of
health and relaxation.

There are two ranges of very high land running though the
greater part of the County from North to South: that in the East
may be called mountainous and
p. 2
is called the Wolds; the Western
range, on which stands the County Town, is called the Cliff; more
westward still is a fine extent of rich pasture, along which the
Trent passes.

Eastward of the Wolds lies also an extensive tract of fine
feeding land, which is watered by overflowing springs; on boring
the substratum of clay, fine spring water gushes up, and in most
places will rise ten feet above the surface, if confined in a
tube: these cheap artificial springs are general, and many
hundreds are continually running, contributing greatly to the
fertility and value of the land.

The fens form the most prominent feature of the County: where
fully cultivated and completely drained their produce is
incredible; but it is a subject of great regret, that no general
system of drainage, including every district which can be made to
communicant with the sea, has yet been effected: nothing short of
one uniform and connected plan can be of full avail: and so many
apparently rival interests are at stake, and so little real
public spirit exists, notwithstanding that it is so much boasted
of, that such an universal plan is more to be wished for than
hoped for.

The soil of Lincolnshire is so various as to include all sorts
of land that are to be found in the whole kingdom, and its
management varies accordingly.

Rabbits have always been an article of great consideration and
attention in the light soils of this County, and immense warrens
are kept for the purpose of supplying London with the skins; this
was once as profitable a stock as could be attended to; but
latterly many warrens have been laid down to other put poses.

It is impossible to speak too highly of the cottage system of
this county.  Round Folkingham and other places, when
inclosures took place, during the late war, by the acts of
parliament, at least three acres of land were assigned to every
cottage; this, of course includes a garden and keep for a cow:
thus land, gardens,
p.
3
cows and pigs, are within reach of the labouring
classes.  On views of humanity and benevolence only it is
gratifying to the considerate breast to see in comfortable
circumstances that class of people on which all other classes
depend.

PROVERBS.

Few men takes his
ADVICE
who talks a great deal.

And no wonder: for “he who knows but little, presently
outs with it.”  And, though silence is not
necessarily, not in itself a proof of good judgment, excessive
talkativeness shows a want of it.  The following is an old
Grecian adage, translated:—“Tongue! whither goest
thou?  To build a city and then to destroy it!”
signifying, says Erasmus, that the tongue affords great blessings
to mankind, and that the same member becomes a cause of dreadful
mischief!  Our English poet, George Wither, who wrote in
1634, observes in his emblems,

No heart can think to what strange ends,

The tongue’s unruly motion tends.

In vain does he ask
ADVICE
who will not follow it.

“Few things,” says Dr. Johnson, “are so
liberally bestowed, or squandered with so little effect, as good
advice!”

Well
BEGUN
is half done.

This ancient proverb is found in Horace; and there is one in
Italian like it.  The
BEGINNING
only is hard and costs
dear.

We often have great reluctance in setting about an appointed
task, the apparent difficulty continuing to increase with delay;
but once engaged in it, we proceed with pleasure until it is
completed.  It is the case in those “trifles which
make the sum of human beings.”  The young scholar
wants courage to set about his lesson in time; the friend, or man
of business, to answer a letter or acquire some point of useful
information: and to go higher in the application of the maxim, it
tells us, that to begin to do good leads on to continued
improvement.  So the Italians say,
BEGIN

your web
,
and God will
supply you with thread
!  Akin to this, are two valuable
proverbs, which chide us for indecision and needless hesitation,

Procrastination is the thief of time
: and

To do what’s right make no delay
,

For life and time slide fast away
.

Birds of a feather flock
together.

Persons of similar manners are fond of associating together;
but the bad particularly: indeed, when their characters are
known, they cannot easily get other companions.  Hence it is
a saying,—

Tell me with whom thou goest
,

And I will tell thou what thou doest
!

These who sleep with dogs rise up with fleas
.

It is bad company that brings men to the gallows
.
Burckhardt in his collection of Arabic proverbs, gives the
following remarkable one:—
He who introduces himself
between the onion and the peel
,
goes not forth without its
strong smell
.  But on the other hand we have in the
Spanish,
Associate with the

GOOD
,
and thou shall be esteemed one
of them
.

One Bird in the Hand is worth two in the Bush; and the
Italians say, Better have an egg to-day than an hen
to-morrow.  But this carries the idea too far.  Ray,
quotes another, which is much better.—

He that leaves certainty
,
and sticks to
chance
,

When fools pipe
,
he may dance
.

This adage, like the fable of the dog and the shadow, advises
us not to part with what we actually possess, on the distant
prospect of some doubtful or uncertain profit.  It seems a
kind of madness in any one who has a competence, or is exercising
with fair success any business or profession, to hazard all in
pursuit of some new scheme, which, however promising in
appearance, may fail and involve him in ruin.  And yet how
many are the victims of this!  How many instances in our own
country do the records of the year 1825 supply.

London Post-Office
.

The
ordinary business of each day
is, in letters in the inland office alone, 35,000 letters
received, and 40,000 sent (23,475,000 annually); exclusive of the
numbers in the foreign office department and the ship-letter
office, and altogether independent of the two-penny post.
The number of newspapers daily varies from 25,000 to 60,000 (on
Saturday 40,000, and on Monday 50,000), of which number about
20,000 an put into the office ten minutes before six
o’clock.  After that hour each newspaper is charged
one half-penny, which yields a revenue of fully £1,000 a
year, and of which 240,000 newspapers are annually put into the
office from six to a quarter before eight o’clock.
The revenue derived from charges for early delivery in London is
£4 000, and the sum obtained by the charges of
one
penny
on each letter given to the postmen, who go round with
bells to collect the letters, is £3,000 a year, giving
720,000, or pearls 2,000 daily.  The revenue of London is
6,000 a week, above £300,000 a year; and yet of all this
vast annual revenue there has only been lost by defaulters
£200 in twenty-five years.  The franks amount in a
morning to 4,000 or 5,000, or more.  Newspapers can only be
franked for foreign parts to the first port at which the mail
arrives; after this they are charged postage according to their
weight, in consequence of which an English daily paper costs in
St. Petersburgh £40 sterling per annum.

FLATTERY AND FRIENDSHIP.

Every one that flatters thee

Is no friend in misery.

Words are easy, like the wind,

Faithful friends are hard to find.

Every man will be thy friend

While thou hast wherewith to spend

But if store of crowns be scant,

No man will supply thy want.

If that one be prodigal,

Bountiful they will him call.

If he be addict to vice,

Quickly him they will entice.

But if fortune once do frown,

Then farewell his great renown:

They that fawned on him before,

Use his company no more.

He that is thy friend indeed,

He will help thee in thy need.

If thou sorrow, he will weep;

If thou wake he cannot sleep.

Thus of every grief in heart,

He with thee doth bear a part.

These are certain signs to know

Faithful friend from flattering foe.

Cure for Drunkenness
.—A man in Maryland,
notoriously addicted to this vice, hearing an uproar in his
kitchen one evening, had the curiosity to stop without noise to
the door, to know what was the matter, when he beheld his
servants indulging in the most unbounded roar of laughter at a
couple of his negro boys who were mimicking himself in his
drunken fits; showing how he reeled and staggered,—how he
looked and nodded, and hiccupped and tumbled.  The picture
which these children of nature drew of him, and which had filled
the rest with so much merriment, struck him so forcibly, that he
became a perfect sober man, to the unspeakable joy of his wife
and children.

Mr. Locke was asked how he contrived to accumulate a mine of
knowledge so rich, yet so extensive and deep.  He replied,
that he attributed what little he knew, to the not having been
ashamed to ask for information; and to the rule he had laid down,
of conversing with all descriptions of men, on those topics
chiefly that formed their own peculiar professions or
pursuits.

Punctuality
.—Mr. Scott of Exeter, travelled on
business till about 80 years of age.  He was one of the most
celebrated characters in the kingdom for punctuality, and by his
methodical conduct, joined to uniform diligence, he gradually
amassed a large fortune.  For a long series of years, the
proprietors of every inn he frequented in Devon and Cornwall,
knew the very day and hour he would arrive.  A short time
before he died, a gentleman on a journey in Cornwall stopped at a
small inn at Port Isaac to dine.  The waiter presented him
with a bill of fare, which he did not approve of, but observing a
fine duck roasting.  “I’ll have that,”
said the traveller.  “You cannot sir,” said the
landlord, “it is for Mr. Scott of Exeter.”
“I know Mr. Scott of Exeter very well,” rejoined the
gentlemen, “he is not in your house.”
“True,” replied the landlord, “
but six
months ago
,
when he was here last
,
he ordered a
duck
to be ready for him this day, precisely at two
o’clock;” and to the astonishment of the traveller,
he saw the old gentleman jogging into the inn-yard about five
minutes before the appointed time.

Advantages of Activity
.—As animal power is
exhausted exactly in proportion to the time during which it is
acting, as well as in proportion to the intensity of force
exerted, there may often be a great saving of it by doing work
quickly, although with a little more exertion during the
time.  Suppose two men of equal weight to ascend the same
stair, one of whom takes only a minute to reach the top, and the
other takes four minutes, it will cost the first little more than
a fourth part of the fatigue which it costs the second, because
the exhaustion is in proportion to the time during which the
muscles are acting.  The quick mover may have exerted
perhaps one-twentieth more force in the first instant to give his
body the greater velocity, which was afterwards continued, but
the slow supported his load four times as long.

Capability greater than Performance
.—Men are
often capable of greater things than they perform.  They are
sent into the world with bills of credit, and seldom draw to
their full extent.

CHAPPED LIPS.

The readiest method to cure simple chaps is to wash them with
barley water, and apply the following mixture of prepared tutty
and olive oil, of each equal parts.

CHAPPED HANDS.

Rough and course hands are very unhandsome; the following
compound will always preserve them smooth: mix 4 oz. of fresh
hog’s lard that has been well washed in common water with
the yolks of 2 new laid eggs, and a large spoonful of honey; add
as much fine oat-meal as to work the whole into paste.

TO REMOVE HAIR FROM THE CHIN.

Women of sanguine complexion and habit have frequently hair
growing on their chin, which is very unseemly.  To extirpate
this, use dulcified spirit of salt on the part, and rub it gently
with a linen cloth; this will effectually kill the roots of the
hair, and at the end of a week they wither, and fall away.

RESTORATIVE POWDER FOR THE TEETH.

Acids of every denomination are unfriendly to the teeth; and
by frequent use will destroy the enamel; the following mixture
not only whitens, but tends to preserve them.  Take Peruvian
bark, 2 oz. charcoal, half an oz. Armenian bole, 1 oz. mix them
altogether in a mortar.  If the teeth are washed, take a
piece of wood like a butcher’s skewer, made soft at the
end, cover it with linen, dip it them in the above ponder, and
apply it to the decayed part.

A COSMETIC TO PRODUCE A FAIR NECK AND BOSOM.

Equal parts of camomile water and white wine, as warm as can
be borne, this for a few weeks will make a considerable change in
the akin.

OFFENSIVE BREATH.

A constant attendant upon the scurvy of the gums, and
putrefied matter lodged in the hollow teeth; the following gargle
stands in high esteem.  Take 2 oz. of cinnamon, 6 drams of
cloves, 6 oz. of Florentine orris root, nutmeg and mace: bruise
them and macerate them in a quart of spirits of wine or French
brandy, during 48 hours; when used, let it be diluted with
water.

Or, chew at night a small piece of gum myrrh; or chew night
and morning a clove, or a piece of orris root, about the size of
a bean; or rub the teeth with a piece of rag dipped in the
spirits of vinegar.

TO SWEETEN MEAT, FISH, &c. THAT IS TAINTED.

When meat, fish, &c., from intense heat, or long keeping,
are likely to pass into a state of corruption, a simple and pure
mode of keeping them sound and healthful is by putting a few
pieces of charcoal, each about the size of an egg, into a pot or
saucepan wherein the meat or fish is to be boiled.  Among
others, an experiment of this kind was tried on a turbot, which
appeared to be too far gone to be eatable; the cook, as advised,
put four pieces of charcoal under the strainer of the fish
kettle; after boiling the proper time, the turbot came to the
table sweet and firm.

USEFUL
RECEIPTS.

OF THE SKIN.

Deformities
as of the skin are
generally the consequences of a distempered blood thrown upon
it.  Promoting the ordinary discharges, and rectifying the
skin by proper washes, is the only way to get rid of such
disorders.  When, therefore, any lotion is employed on the
skin, the person must always take care that some other emunctuary
may be in readiness, to discharge what to lessened by the
application of the external medicine.  Diuretics are allowed
by all to be the best auxiliaries to cosmetics, and it is hardly
safe to use one without the other.  We will first notice

OF PIMPLES.

This deformity consists in a redness of the face, attended
with inflammatory pustules, the causes of which are commonly
attributed to an acrid, thick blood, that swells and corrodes the
small vessels; to clear which, the mass of blood must be
sweetened and diluted with proper medicines.

For this purpose, infuse 4 oz. of mustard seed in a quart of
while wine, and after 3 or 4 days, drink a wine glass full of it
every morning filling up the phial as long as the seed gives any
strength.—Or boil 3 spoonsful of mustard seed in a quart of
milk, take off the curd, and keep the whey for use.  This
remedy is an excellent diuretic, and a cordial for the nerves,
but it differs from the first in quality.  Take half a wine
glass full every morning.

Among all the lotions, and the best to use with the above
diuretic, is a pimpernel water, which is so sovereign a
beautifier of the complexion as to deserve a place on every
lady’s toilet.  It is prepared by only infusing half a
handful of this herb in a quart of water, letting it stand all
night.  It may be used a little warm, but not hot.  If
not sufficiently powerful to remove the pimples, take camphor
rubbed fine in a mortar, put upon it, a little at a time, 1 ounce
of the juice of lemons, when dissolved, add 1 pint of white
wine.  This is a very good lotion for spots and flushings:
it may be used with the greatest safety.

TO TAKE IRON MOULDS OR RUSTS OUT OF LINEN.

Dissolve the powder of burnt alum in the juice of lemon: wet
the place with it, and dry it with the back of a spoon, in the
fore part of which put a live coal; and in doing it 5 or 6 times,
the iron moulds will be washed out.

TO CLEAN GOLD AND RESTORE ITS LUSTRE.

Dissolve a little sal-ammoniac in urine: boil your soiled gold
therein, and it will become clean and brilliant.

HOW TO TAKE SPOTS OR STAINS OUT OF SILK OR VELVET.

Take sopwort (a herb of that name), bruise it, and strain out
the juice; add a little black soap, and mix them well to a
moderate thickness; rub it over the stained or spotted place;
warm it gradually before the fire, and the stains will rub out
with the hand.

p. 16
TO
RESTORE THE VOICE AND REMOVE HOARSENESS.

Many causes may contribute to this defect, particularly severe
colds, breathing an air too full of dust, &c., too much
speaking or singing, or being too much exposed to the air, on
quitting convivial meetings and other entertainments of
jollity.

To remove this defect, drink freely of barley and liquorice
water, eat black currant jelly, and gargle the mouth twice or
thrice every morning with the syrup of hedge mustard, diluted in
a glass of milk or warm water.

It is certainly very mortifying to a lady to have a masculine
voice, and yet it is a very frequent circumstance.  As a
means of contracting the larynx, the extra wideness of which is
the cause, you must drink nothing hot; frequently drink lemonade,
water acidulated with verjuice, oranges, &c., and gargle the
throat every morning with equal parts of verjuice and water.

GARGLE FOR A SORE THROAT.

Take a handful of red sage leaves, simmer them 2 minutes in a
third of a pint of water, strain the liquor off; when cold add an
equal quantity of vinegar, and sweeten it with honey.  These
receipts are best for general purposes, and may be used with
perfect safety, and generally with the happiest effect.

FOR A COUGH.

Mix vinegar and treacle in equal quantities, let a teaspoonful
be taken occasionally, when the cough is troublesome.  This
is a receipt of the excellent Dr. James, of Carlisle.

FOR CLEANING IRON AND BRASS.

Half an oz. of cream of tarter, half a dram of cochineal,
quarter pound of sulphuric acid.  The above mixed with a
quart of water, and when wanted to use, mix a little Bath brick
with the liquid, to the consistency of paste; and apply it to the
iron or brass with wash leather.

FOR DESTROYING RATS AND MICE.

Get a sixpenny packet of Winton’s Compound Mixture, (it
may be had of any medicine vender), and mix it with a little
butter or lard, and scatter it where the vermin resort.
Whole parishes have been entirely cleared of them by the above,
when it has been generally used.

CORNS.

This plaster will always give relief, and frequently remove
them: 1 oz. of Venice turpentine, the yolks of 2 eggs, 2 drams of
mercurial plaster, half an oz. of yellow wax; the turpentine and
wax must be melted together; mix the other ingredients when
fluid.  Or, take equal quantities of roasted onion and soft
water, beat them together, and apply them as a poultice.
This application will instantly appease the pain of the corn.

TO MAKE CHEAP BLACKING.

Take 4 oz. of ivory black, 3 oz. of the coarsest moist sugar,
a table spoonful of sweet oil, and a pint of small beer, with
half a spoonful of the oil of vitrol; mix them gradually,
cold.

p. 17
HEAD
ACHE.

Ceplinile snuff in a general way remove the afflicting pain of
the head ache.  One scruple of turpeth mineral, half a dram
of powdered ginger, 1 scruple of powdered nutmeg, 3 drops of oil
of rosemary, well mixed, and snuffed up the nose.

CURE FOR WEAK EYES.

Take a lump of white copperas about the size of a pea, put it
in a small phial that contains about 2 ounces of water, carry
this in the pocket, and occasionally taking out the cork, turn
the phial on the finger’s end, and thus bathe the
eyes.  This will positively effect a cure in a short
time.

INFLAMED EYES.

Is a very painful and well-known complaint, arising sometimes
from cold, and frequently from a very acrid blood which
stimulates the delicate vessels of the eye, swelling and
inflaming them.  The following eye waters are very good to
cool sharp, hot humours, they may be readily prepared, and will
more effectually answer their end if assisted by the use of
diuretics at the same time.  First, calaminaris levigated,
half a dram, rose water, 2 oz.—Second, take white vitrol,
15 grains, rose water, 2 oz.—With either of these, the eyes
may be washed at discretion, in all hot defluctions; but when the
sight decays from dryness, or a defect in the optic nerve, such
things can avail but little.—When a poultice is necessary,
you may take half a pint of the decoction of linseed, and as much
flour of linseed as is sufficient to make it a proper
consistency.  This poultice is preferable to bread and milk
for sore eyes, it will not grow sour nor acid.  In
corroboration of the above, we give a letter to the editor of the
Mechanics’ Magazine, page 95, vol. I.

“Sir,—Reading your miscellany to a
friend, a cure for weak eyes, he had recourse to your receipt,
and was cured in a short time, though he had previously spent
much money without getting relief from the faculty.  I hope
your readers who may be in a similar situation, will follow the
example.”

OINTMENT FOR BURNS.

This ointment has never yet failed to give relief; yellow
basilicon 3 ounces turpentine 1½ ounce.

FOR SHORTNESS OF BREATH.

Mix ¾ of an oz. of fine powdered senna, ½ an oz.
of the flour of brimstone, ¼ of an oz. of powdered ginger,
in 4 oz. of clarified honey.  Take about the size of a
nutmeg every night and morning for five successive days,
afterwards, once a week for some time, and finally once a
fortnight.

TO MAKE GINGER BEER.

One ounce and a half of well-bruised ginger, 1 ounce of cream
of tartar, 1 sliced lemon, 1 pound of white sugar.  Put
these ingredients into an earthen vessel, and pour upon them a
gallon of water, boiling; when cold, add a table spoonful of
yeast, and let the whole stand till next morning; then skim and
bottle it; keep it three days in a cool place it will then be fit
for use.

PROBLEMS.

A country woman carrying eggs to a garrison, where she had
three guards to pass, sold at the first half the number she had,
and half an egg more; at the second, the half of what remained,
and half an egg more; and at the third, the half of the remainder
and half an egg more; when she arrived at the market-place, she
had three dozen still to sell, how was this possible, without
breaking any of the eggs?

Solution
.—The possibility of this problem will be
evident when it is considered, that by taking the greater half of
an odd number, we take the exact half—½.  It
will he found therefore, that the woman, before she passed the
last guard, had 73 eggs remaining, for by selling 37 of them at
that guard which is the half—½, she would have 36
remaining.  In the like manner, before she came to the
second guards she had 147; and before she came to the first,
295.

Two Greeks dicing together, one provided five dishes, the
other three.  A stranger happened to pop in, and requested
to join them.  On his departure, he gave the Greek who had
provided five dishes
five
shillings, and to the other who
had furnished three dishes,
three
shillings; but the
latter was dissatisfied, and had the matter referred to Solon,
who instantly decided that the Greek who had provided five dishes
should have
seven
shillings, and he who furnished the
three dishes should receive but
one
shilling.

Solution
.—Each Greek paid eight shillings, which
are twenty-four shillings for eight dishes, or three shillings
per dish.  The one who provided five being fifteen shillings
out of pocket, had a right to have seven shillings refunded to
him, which left him eight shillings, his proportion.

When first the marriage knot was tied, betwixt
my love and me,

My age did then her’s exceed us three times three doth
three.

But when we ten and half ten years we man and wife had been,

Her age came up as near to mine, as eight is to sixteen.

Solution.—The man was 45, the woman was 15.

HINTS
TO THOSE

WHO ASK,

WHY SHOULD I CONTRIBUTE TO SUPPORT
MISSIONS TO

THE HEATHEN?

What are the objects of such
missions
?  Are they not to make known the glorious
Gospel of the blessed God; to institute Christian Schools; to
erect places of Christian worship; to collect Christian
societies; and thus to banish Pagan ignorance, Pagan vices, and
Pagan cruelties, from the earth?

Have not such objects been already
accomplished
,
to a certain
extent
,
in various parts of the
heathen world
?—This is indisputable.  Many in
Asia, Africa, America, Australasia, and Polynesia, no longer
worship idols; no longer destroy each other.  Many mothers
no more cast their children to the crocodiles, or drown them in
rivers.  Many aged and sick persons, who would have been
cast out into the woods in age and infirmity, are now cherished
by their children.  Many thousands of children, in the
different Mission Schools in India, Africa, the South-Sea
inlands, and other places, are now reading the word of God,
worshipping our Saviour, and singing his praises; who would
otherwise have been trained up in idolatry, and all its polluting
and degrading superstitions.  Many adults have been brought
to the knowledge of Christ; and many have died in peace and in
the hope of heaven, whose sun would otherwise have set amid the
dark and lowering clouds of Heathenism.  Finally, the work,
though in some places feeble, has been begun; it is spreading its
enlightening and sanctifying influence among surrounding
millions; and it exhibits to our faith and hope the dawn of the
universal salvation.

Are you a man
?—Do you not
then shudder at the miseries, and oppressions, and murders, which
Heathenism is daily practising, and which Christianity brings to
an end wherever it prevails?  On the principle of common
humanity and sympathy, you will then surely feel an interest in
Missions, nor suffer the cry of slaughtered widows and children,
and the voice of distress, pouring out its wailings from all
lands, to reach your ears in vain.

Are you a briton
?  Think of
the vastness of the British Empire, comprising, at a low
calculation, upwards of a
HUNDRED
MILLIONS
of subjects, most of whom are Pagan
idolaters.  Why has Providence given us power, but to employ
it so that, wherever it is felt, “mankind may feel our
mercy too?”  Shall we enjoy the advantages of that
extensive commerce which so vast an empire gives to us; shall we
revel in the luxuries of the West and of the East; shall we turn
every colony to gain? and shall we neglect the souls of our
fellow-subject?  If we do so, we cannot be guiltless before
Him who governs the world, and who will bless our blessings, or
wither them, as we are faithful or unfaithful to the behests of
His Providence.  As a Briton, therefore, you are bound to
support
p.
2
Missions, and by them to fill the whole empire with the
blessings of that Christianity we enjoy at home.

Do you profess to be a true and lively
christian
?—Then you love your Saviour, and must
desire that all should love and worship Him.  Then you pray
daily, “Thy kingdom come,” and must mean something
when you thus pray, or you offer vain service, and mock
God.  Then you pity the ignorant, and weep over perishing
souls; and, if so, you must, you will, do all you can to point
them to “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
world.”

Are you a christian
parent
?—You look with joy and gratitude upon your
rising family.  You placed them, by holy baptism, in the
arms of Jesus, that He might bless them.  They are in
covenant with Him.  They hearken unto you, and you teach
them the fear of the Lord.  You send them into life,
commended to God as their “sun and shield.”  You
rejoice in the hope of meeting them all again in the kingdom of
Heaven.  O happy Christian parent!  O favoured
Christian families!—families “whom Jesus
loves.”  But Missions are creating many such families
among Negroes, Hottentots, Fejees, New Zealanders, the Friendly
Islanders, the American Indians, and the Singalese.  Many a
Heathen hut resounds with praise; and parents and children, once
idolaters, bow before the throne of grace in united family
worship.  Do not you rejoice in this? and will you not do
your utmost to promote the cause of Christ, till all the families
of the earth, like your own, are blessed in Him?

Are you a christian
child
?—What do you owe to Christ, whose adorable
name you bear!  But for the blessed Gospel, you had scarcely
known your parents’ tender love.  No prayers to the
true God would have been offered by them on your behalf.
You would have been a worshipper of the ugly, gloomy gods of
Paganism.  You might have been cast into a river, or turned
out to perish in a wood; or, if not, you would have grown up in
ignorance, vice, and misery.  You would have had no
education; never have read the blessed Bible; never have sung a
hymn of praise to God, and would not have had, as now, the
prospect of a happy, useful life, and a glorious heaven.  O
what do you owe to Christ!  You feel that you ought to love
Him, and how can you better show that you do love Him, than by
pitying poor, ignorant Heathen children, and contributing some
little of your spare money, to send them Ministers, to build them
Schools, to buy them the Bible and holy books, and teach them all
the blessed truths which you have learned of Christ, the Saviour
of the world?

Have you lately been made yourself a
partaker of the grace of christ
?—How much do you owe
to Him who hath brought you “out of a horrible pit, and out
of the miry clay;” and how ought you to pity all who are
living “without hope and without God in the
world!”  When you felt the burden of sin, you heard of
Christ, and his willingness to save.

“Dying, you heard the welcome sound,

And pardon in his mercy found.”

But millions of the poor Heathen feel that burden too, yet
they know not where to fly for relief; they go from idol to idol;
from sacrifice to sacrifice; perform painful pilgrimages, and
torture their bodies.  But in vain! the sting remains; the
fear of the future still pursues them.  Do
p. 3
they not cry,
even in your ears, “Men and brethren, what shall we
do?” and will not you, remembering the sweetness of that
hour when you obtained mercy by believing in Christ, make haste
to tell them, by the Missionaries you send forth, where pardon
may be found?  O you not, by your liberalities, cause these
blessed words to be sounded in the ears of all such mourning,
broken spirits?—

“Sinners, believe the gospel word:

Jesus is come your souls to save!

Jesus is come, your common Lord;

Pardon ye all through him may have;

May now be saved, whoever will:

This man receiveth sinners still.”

Finally
,
Are
you an aged christian
?—How often have you prayed,
“O Lord, revive thy work!”  How often have you
longed to see the dawn of the day of Christ upon all
nations!  Well, now you see it.  God has granted you
this before you depart to be with Christ.  You, you aged
servant of God, must rejoice in it.  Your long life of mercy
has been crowned with this mercy.  Tell all about you, how
you “saw the cloud arise, little as a human hand;”
bid them look to its spreading showers; mark its reviving
influence; and hear the “sound of abundance of
rain.”  Yes, you will encourage our youth to pledge
themselves to this cause; you will give it the sanction and aid
of your counsel and influence; and you will die in greater peace
and higher triumph, since “your eyes have seen His
salvation; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his
people Israel.”

“Let the children of Zion,” therefore, “be
joyful in their King.”  “Both young men and
maidens, old men and children, let them praise the Lord,”
and unite to proclaim “His glory among the Heathen, His
wonders among all people,” till the whole earth shall be
filled with the honours of His high and glorious name.
Amen.

But do any of you ask,
What can i do in
this cause
?—This is an important and serious
question, especially when you consider that that day will come
when you must “give up your stewardship, and be no longer
steward” of your Lord’s goods, whether he has
entrusted you with five, three, or only one talent; and when he
will doubtless ask you, what you have done to promote His cause
in the world.

Well, then, it may be kindly and affectionately inquired of
you, whether you do not indulge in some needless superfluities of
meat, drink, apparel, furniture, or show, which, even in perfect
consistency with your rank of life, whatever it may be, you may
reduce, and have more to spend in works of piety and charity at
home and abroad?  Put this question to your hearts in the
fear of God.

If you have no obvious superfluities, yet may not your
economy, that is, your management of what you have, be more
exact, methodical, and careful?  So that even your own
affairs will be more prosperous; and, from this good management,
you may find much more to give to these great services than even
now you are yourselves aware of.  Try the experiment; for
many have tried it, and have found themselves enabled to become
“rich in good works,” almost without cost to
themselves.

Ask, What cannot I give?  Cannot I spare this penny every
week?—
p.
ix
Why not?  Cannot I give this shilling, as a monthly
subscription; or this pound, or even several pounds, as a yearly
one?  Why not?  You may have an answer, but see that it
is a good one; that it is such an one as you can with confidence
give to your Lord, when He calls you to give an account of your
stewardship.

Cannot I give my influence to this cause?  Why not?
I have some influence, perhaps as a master, or as a parent, or as
a neighbour, or as a friend.  Cannot I employ this talent of
influence in inducing servants, children, neighbours, friends, to
take a share in all the good which the Lord is doing upon earth
among the children of men?  Will they not be benefited by
it?  How many good thoughts will it put into their
minds!  How probable is it, that they may feel more sensibly
the value of the Gospel than before, by considering the situation
of those nations who have it not!  How much will it enlarge
their knowledge, to place before them the publications of a
Missionary Society!  How much will it ennoble the heart of
the poorest and youngest among them, to teach them to live to
benefit all mankind!  Cannot I take even an active part in
this work, if called upon; or may I not humbly offer my services
in some department?  Why not?  Collectors, patient,
persevering Collectors, are always wanting; and why cannot I
become a Collector, and have the honour and blessedness of
begging for a perishing world?  Treasurers, Secretaries,
Members of Committees, are wanting wherever a Missionary Society
is formed, who will be active in their duty, and constant in
their attendance.  Cannot I then, if called upon, take my
share of any of those duties, whenever they are assigned
me?  Why not?  What good and serious reason can I give
against it, when, laying my hand upon my heart, I ask, “How
much owest thou unto my Lord?”  Cannot I converse on
these great subjects, and arouse my own languid zeal, and that of
others, by this means?  Why not?  Would not this shut
out many trifling things from conversation; and will not the
constant reading of Missionary Publications, and accounts of the
progress of Christ’s kingdom in the world, furnish
conversation with some of the best and most inspiring
topics?—and is not this in character, when, as the Psalmist
says, “All thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord, and thy
saints shall bless thee; they shall speak of the glory of thy
kingdom, and talk of thy power, to make known to the sons of men
His mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of His
kingdom.”  And cannot I join my prayers, prayers in my
closet, in my family, and in the Church of God: thus
acknowledging that the work is the Lord’s, and that vain is
the help of man,—thus bringing upon all counsel, and upon
all effort, the prospering blessing of Him who “worketh all
and in all?”  Rest not till you have put to yourself
all these questions, and then so act as “the answer of a
good conscience” shall direct.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

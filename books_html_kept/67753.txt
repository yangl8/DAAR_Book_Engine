CHAPTER I.

IN THE SCIENTISTâS STUDY.

The private study of SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales, in
the State House of Chihuahua, always had an air conducive
to study.

His fame as a scientist, as a man of great moral
force, as a man who lived his daily life in a highly
spiritual manner, was broadcast in the land.

His most casual acquaintances unconsciously grew
thoughtful, studious, and better by knowing him.

He was of purely Mexican origin, and his friends
delighted in calling him âSeÃ±orâ Gonzalesâas was
the custom of the people when Chihuahua was one of
the States of âThe Republic of Mexico,â a nation long
since only known as having existed by reading from the
pages of history.

The great love and respect constantly shown him
by his daily associates proved the exception to the rule
that âA prophet is not without honor save in his own
country and amongst his own kin.â

He was not honored as mankind was honored in the

10
nineteenth centuryâfor his social, political or financial
positionâbut for his moral, intellectual, and
spiritual development.

Julio Murillo, a fellow student who acted in the
capacity of office-man, was a small but well-built typical
Mexican, nearing the end of his fifth incarnation.

He spent no time regretting his past actions, nor fearing
the future.

Every moment he lived the best in him, and studied
to make âthe bestâ better on the morrow.

On the morning our story opens he had finished his
regular rounds of tidying the reception-chamber, and
was at work in a small alcove room adjoining, on the
properties extracted from the sunâs rays, by means of
a glass chemical instrument. At the focus the rays
were liquidized, separated, and blended into âMemory
Fluid.â

Although the analysis under way was exceedingly interesting
to him, he was not in the least disturbed,
when a noise much resembling the faint tingling of a
small silver bell announced that he must leave his
pleasant occupation and receive some visitor.

When he reached the reception-room he stood with
his hand upon the knob of the door, which he was about
to open to admit a visitor, when a beautiful smile overspread
his countenance and he murmured: âIt is his
Honor.â

The door opened noiselessly and a man in every way
worthy the name of man stood before him.

âYour Honor,â he said, extending his hand in greeting,

11
which was eagerly seized by the visitor, âpass, sir,
and be seated; SeÃ±or Gonzales will receive you in a
very short time. Thereâthe clock is striking the
half hour; in fifteen minutes he will be at your Honorâs
service. The morning paper, your Honor? Wonderful
discoveries in Science, in Art, in Man.â

The visitor thanked Julio Murillo as he took the
paper, and seating himself in one of the many comfortable
chairs in the room, he said:

âI have read the paper, sir; others than our kind are
no doubt astonished at its contents. There will be more
convincing statements made within thirty days. In
fact, I believe our evidence will be so strong, that everyone
will believe the history of the case and the matter
will be forever settled soon.

âI am sure
your
investigations, Julio, will strengthen
our case materially. Now, sir, I beg of you to continue
your absorbing study, and I will remain here in
meditation until SeÃ±or Gonzales grants me an interview.
One cannot give
too
much time to thought, so do
me the favor not to detain yourself longer.â

Julio Murillo shook hands with the distinguished
visitor, and with much the same smile he had on entering
the room, he left to resume his scientific investigations.

The large, handsome, princely looking visitor walked
the richly covered floor thoroughly wrapped in pleasant
and highly scientific meditations.

He was not long kept waiting for his hostâs welcome.

He stooped to pick up a nosegay which dropped from
his coat, and when he raised his head, Guillermo Gonzales

12
stood before him, by the side of his writing-table,
with outstretched hands.

The partition separating the two rooms had disappeared
as if by magic, and they stood alone in one
grand room.

A giant was not at hand, nor neither were the powers
of a magician employed to make the partition disappear
so quickly. It was constructed on the same plan
as sliding-doors, but it moved with more rapidity and
much less noise.

The two distinguished men greeted each other with
the embrace and handshake characteristic of their
ancient Mexican ancestors.

In the privacy of his study Guillermo Gonzales
always addressed the friend of his youth,âand his
friend during the other lives which they had lived generations
ago in the Republic of Mexico, ay, in the same
city where they now livedâthe capital of Chihuahuaâin
the most familiar schoolboy fashion.

âMiguey, my boy, this is indeed a most pleasant surprise.
You returned when?â

The friend of the scientist was none other than the
renowned man of letters and the Governor of Chihuahua,
SeÃ±or Don Miguel Lehumada.

âLast night, only, my friend. I have much to tell
you,âmuch to tell you.â

The scientist drew a large, comfortable chair on
either side of the table on which he had been conducting
his most recent experiments, and motioning his
friend to the seat, they sat down facing each other.

âI, too, have things of importance to relate. Your
Honor, proceed; my whole attention is yours.â

13
The Governor leaned his handsome head on the back
of his chair with a grace befitting the man he was, and
said:

âWhat I have to tell will not startle you, nor did it
surprise me when I learned it.

âA volcanic eruption could not have created more of
a sensation over the entire United States, or in all
Europe, than is now taking place on account of the
knowledge they have of our scientific discoveries.
However, to come to the point, I positively located,
during my recent visit to the North, âThe Plunger
from Kansas.ââ

Guillermo Gonzales arose from his chair and clasped
his friend in his arms.

âMiguey, dear, dear Miguey, victory is ours! Pardon
my enthusiasm! While I know we are working the
right clue, I am overjoyed that you should have the
pleasure of locating âThe Plunger!ââ

The scientist did not resume his seat; but instead
walked somewhat nervously and in deep thought back
and forth before his honored guest.

The Governor continued: âI met him on the streets
of Kansas City. It was a mutual recognition. He
even stopped, and said in a confused manner:

ââPardon me, sir, but are you not Governor of Chihuahua?
You do not know me?â

ââYes,â I replied, without a momentâs reflection:
âYou are the âPlunger from Kansas.ââ

âHe turned very white and shook like an aspen leaf.

ââIt is retribution,â he exclaimed, âand it came after
death. O God, is there no peace for me in this life or

14
any future life? Am I to be an outcast and a wanderer
as I was in my second physical state, because of
the small offence I committed? There is no justice in
torturing a man through several existences, because he
took a few hundred thousand dollars from his fellowman,
and did some other similar tricks, which were
termed business shrewdness in those days. Governor,
I will now say good-bye. Retribution seems to be following
me; do not aid its progress, I pray you!â

âIn a moment he was gone. With the assistance of
two detectives, we searched for him the greater part of
three days and nights. No clue whatever could we find
of him.

âWere I not convinced of the truth of our scientific
investigations, I would be annoyed by his sudden disappearance;
but it is of no use to be disturbed, for we
know it is only a question of time until he will revisit
the city to which he fled, it being the capital of a State
of a foreign nation then, to escape the wrath of his
creditors.â

The scientist continued his walk back and forth,
listening intently to every word his friend spoke, now
and then smiling his approval and exclaiming: âTrue,
Miguey; true.â

âFor those in touch with the past and to whom the
Hidden is revealed, there is no mystery connected with
the appearance and sudden disappearance of the
Plunger,â concluded the Governor.

Seating himself facing his visitor, the scientist said:

âVarious lengths of time are necessary to teach
people of different degrees of spiritual development that

15
Nature demands her equilibrium restored, no matter at
whose seeming expense.

âIn your book, âLiquid from the Sunâs Rays,â Restoration
of Equilibrium is fully explained. True, my dear
Miguey, we must give people
time
to grow. The poor
little minds warped for centuries by credal teachings,
abandon of morals, cannot be expected to grasp Truth
at a glance.

âWe must feed them âMemory Fluid.â All knowledge
of the Hidden must come through Self, and our
discovery so wonderfully described in your work, now
of international repute, is the only known means to that
greatly desired end.

âCome, Miguey, tell me of your reception in the
northern states. No such a wave of discovery has swept
across the world since the time of Galileo, as that produced
by our researches made known to the public by
your works.â

âMy reception,â began the distinguished author, and
leader of his people, âwas an ovation from my exit
from this city until my return.

âIn my lecture at Kââ, I hinted at the clue we were
at work on to right the wrongs committed by âThe
Plunger from Kansas.â Enthusiasm ran high, and at
the end of my lecture I was carried from the assembly
room in a white velvet chair, beautifully decorated with
flowers and lace, supported on the shoulders of the
mayor and three other prominent citizens.

âThey wish to organize a society, under our supervision,
to experiment with our âMemory Fluid.â The
masses are, I believe, intolerant with our discoveries, yet

16
they read my work and the newspapers comments concerning
it, no doubt out of curiosity alone.â

âIt makes no difference,â added Guillermo Gonzales,
â
why
they read it or by what means their attention
is drawn to Truth; the result is the same,âinvestigations
follow at no distant time.

âA desire to learn must be awakened in the mind of
every creature before he is in a condition to develop.

âCome, look through this window. See those three
men writing at that long table?â

âI certainly do,â replied the Governor; âwhat new
clue is this that you are at work upon? Ah, some of
those persons I certainly have seen before. Can it be
that they took part in the Plungerâs drama, one hundred
and fifty years ago?â

âIt is quite true, your Honor. Julio recognized
them on the street a few days after your departure for
the States.ââ(A term Mexicans occasionally use.)

âThey are men of some learning, and at Julioâs invitation
called here to take observation of our investigations.
He gave them a few drops of âMemory Fluidâ
every time they called, for one week, which was every
day. At the end of the week, the tall man at the right
of the other two, Mr. Niksab, called Julio aside and told
him in the most confidential air that he had undergone
a most wonderful experience.

âScarcely able to control his joy at the information
about to be imparted to him, Julio asked him to write
his experience and give it to him for future reference.
Niksab did so, and on the file in Julioâs study hangs
the written statement of his first experience after taking
âMemory Fluid.â

17
âSince that morning the other two have made a similar
confession to Julio. Now they come here every
morning and write their remembrances of the doings of
âThe Plunger from Kansas,â which is put on our file of
evidence to be used at the final reckoning.

âNiksab is the man who found a hiding place for the
Plunger on the occasion of his flight from justice, to
Chihuahua in the year 1898.â

âI remember the time well,â said the Governor. âI
was then, as now, Governor of the State. How anxious
we were then for advancement. How proud we were of
our city. How eagerly our peons grasped the advantages
given them then for education.

âLook at their descendants and some of our
then

most common menials, who are fortunate to be doing
their third and fourth existence since that time; how
they have developed!

âWho are they now? Our most noted judges,
lawyers, teachers, men of science and letters.

âCome, Guillermo, I wish to pay a quiet visit to
the den of our coworker, Julio. Join me; otherwise
we will be delayed in bringing about the desired results
from investigations which will take place here and
elsewhere in the morning.â

Arm in arm the two great and noble menâworking
for the same cause, the spiritual elevation of manâleft
the studio of the Scientist Gonzales, and entered
the lesser apartment of their coworker, Julio Murillo.

CHAPTER II.

HIS FIRST INCARNATION.

Early the next morning Julio Murillo was unlocking
the side door which led into his quiet study
adjoining the reception-room of the great scientist,
Guillermo Gonzales, when he was surprised to hear
some one, evidently a stranger, call him by his given
name. He pushed the door he had been unlocking
open, and as he stepped inside, faced the person who
addressed him.

A tall, fair-haired, rather masculine looking woman
stood before him with extended hand.

âGood morning, SeÃ±or Julio; good morning. It
is with much pleasure I find you so well and so
famous. My card, seÃ±or.â

âPass, seÃ±orita, pass. You do me great honor.
Be seated. In what way can I be of service to you?â

He scanned the card closely, as he wheeled a comfortable
armchair in front of a large window which
he opened, and repeated: âBe seated.â

The fair visitor stood in front of the open window
some minutes before taking the proffered chair,
gazing with great admiration at the rare and costly
flowers and foliage, growing in the
patio
.

She seemed to be in no hurry to tell the object of

19
her visit, if she had an object, neither did she seem to
be a stranger to the scene around her.

Julio Murillo stood a little at her back, his eyes
riveted upon her card.

âMarriet Motuble! Marriet Motuble,â he mentally
exclaimed. âThe name means nothing to me; it does
not even give me food for reflection. But the magnificent
seÃ±orita fills me with unpleasant memories of the
past. Can it be that she was in anyway associated in
times gone by withâwithâââ

His mental comments were suddenly brought to
an end by Miss Motuble seating herself, at the same
moment drawing a chair close to the one she occupied,
and saying: âSit here by me, friend Julio. I want
to study your face while I talk to you. I am impressed
that we will not long be alone, and as there are many
things I have to say that must be known to no one but
yourself, I will delay no longer telling them.â

Julio felt the truth of her statements, and bent his
head toward her, as he seated himself by her side, that
he might not lose a word she spoke.

âYou are the son of SeÃ±ora Suzzan Carriles, of
Colima. Your father was a priest, while the husband
of your mother was SeÃ±or Carlos Carriles, a man of
quiet manners, but strong feeling and ardent sentiment
when convinced or aroused.

âYour strong resemblance to the priest, your father,
was so noticeable when you reached the age of six years,
that your motherâs guilt needed no accuser, and in a
fit of religious enthusiasm she made a confession of
her guilt to her husband.

20
âSeÃ±or Carrilesâ sympathies in your behalf were
greatly aroused. He sought the priest, a man of much
wealth and prominence in the State, and told him of
his knowledge of the great sin he and your mother had
committed.

âUnder the threat of publicly making known his
sins to the clergy and State, he agreed to take you
under his guidance and to rear you in a manner befitting
his own son.

âThis promise he religiously kept for five years. Up
to that age you were in ignorance of your birth. The
priest became very ill and fearing death near by, made
a full confession to you.

âHe afterward recovered, and seriously regretted
having made you his confidant.

âInstead of treating you as a beloved son, his love
had during his short illness turned to hate and he compelled
you to act in the capacity of the most common
menial. You rebelled at the change affairs had taken,
but by so doing you only made your existence the more
intolerable.

âA lady tourist came to your city one day, and
visited the monastery where you lived, it being one
of the many places of interest in the city.

âShe overheard a conversation between yourself and
the priest, wherein he threatened to murder you if
you made known his treatment of you and the relation
he bore to you.

âThis same lady met you on the street some days
later, and took you at once to the palace of the kind
and high-minded Governor.

21
âTo him she told what she knew concerning you,
and besought the noble leader of the people to allow
you to speak, which he did.

âIn a very quiet way he had the priest arraigned
before the Church and State, with the result of the
priestâs condemnation and sentence of life.

âHe was found dead the next day after he was
acquainted with the courtâs decision.

âHalf of his large fortune was given to you by the
Church and State, acknowledging you, thereby, his
legal heir. Is there anything I have left out of this
recital which you recall, Julio?â

Julio straightened himself in the chair, the first
move he had made since Marriet Motuble began her
recitation, and said:

âThe gist of the subject you have told perfectly.
A few minor things happened which I will later recount.
How natural you seem to me now. How
astonishingly clear you have related that incident
which happened one hundred and fifty years ago, and
which caused me to go abroad to study; with the result
that I departed from the faith of my father.

âYou caused much trouble then, but I have to thank
you for getting me out of the dreadful mire of ignorance
into which I was born and where the priest held
me.

âI will repeat your own words at that time. You
said: âI will make things warm for the person who
commits crimes, and takes advantage of the inexperienced,
young or aged.â Crimes are various, however.
Your success in that life was not without laurels;

22
in
this
, I hope your mission is different and on a
higher plane. You did much harm. You are now
here to aid us in securing proof which will eventually
bring the âPlunger from Kansasâ to meet justiceâ
for
spite
. He went out of the other life like a flashâwhether
by his own hand or by the hand of some
wrathy creditor, man never knew.

âThe many homes made desolate by his dishonest
schemes must eventually be compensated for their
losses.
Time
is the great adjuster of all wrongs; and
the Plungerâs time is not far distant.â

âYour statements are true, my friend Julio, in every
detail. You have partially only guessed my mission
to Chihuahua, however. Yes, I did harm. I am
searching for one I loved in that life, who suffered
much from the abuse of certain countrymen of her
own, then residing in Chihuahua. Aye, from myself.â

âIn truth,â said Julio, âI am certain you will locate
her in this city before long.â

âThe great circle in which Time moves shows our
planet nearing its perihelion, and for the next ninety
days the great scientist, Guillermo Gonzales, and his
able assistant, to whom I am now speaking, will be
able to demonstrate to the world the effect of your
great discovery, âThe Liquid from the Sunâs Rays,â or
perhaps better known as âMemory Fluid,ââ said Miss
Motuble.

âAye,â assented Julio. âNo such means has ever
been in the hands of man, by which he can effectually
bring the perpetrators of crimes to justice.â

âAnd it matters not,â continued Miss Motuble, âof
how long standing the crime is.â

23
âNot in the least; not in the least,â continued her
host. âIn fact, we are thinking of trying to run down
every person who participated in that ancient and inhuman
crime of silencing the musical voice of Lotâs
wife.â

âIf that is done,â laughed Miss Motuble, âthe truth
of the story will be proven; but to spend oneâs time
trying to prove such an absurd story is a sin. Besides
I admit that the story is of too long standing, for you
and me to interest ourselves in it. I am here for the
sole purpose of making existence warm for the many I
knew in other lives, who failed to get justice meted out
to them then. Indirectly only am I connected with
the punishment of the âPlunger from Kansas.â Yet
revenge prompts the motive.â

Further conversation between them was interrupted
by the entrance of first, a little girl with beautiful
flowers to sell, followed by Mr. Niksab, and two other
men, one an elderly, bald-headed, dissipated looking
man, who carried his hand on the side of his cheek.
His face was spotted and his mouth stood open.

His surprise was very noticeable when he saw Miss
Motuble. His lips quivered and tears began to flow
from his eyes, like water from a fountain.

Julio Murillo shook hands with the three men, asked
them to be seated, and then turned his attention to the
little girl, who stood modestly by the door waiting to
tell the object of her call.

âHow many posies must I buy from my little flower
girl this morning?â said Julio.

âOne,â replied the child, âif it so pleases your honor,

24
for it will please thy mother, SeÃ±ora Suzzan Carriles,
for you to do so.â

âBless the dear one,â cried Marriet Motuble, âwe
will buy every posy she has. Come, gentlemen, now
is the opportunity to show your gratitude to science
through this child, who is the living proof of our
friendâs investigations. Come, gentlemen, who will bid
on this childâs posies? One dollar for each flower. One
dollar once, one dollar twiceâââ

âThree dollars for each flower,â cried a voice from
Guillermo Gonzalesâ reception-room.

Julio Murillo greeted the bidder as he stepped into
the little study, with great joy. He was accompanied
by the scientist, Guillermo Gonzales, who was no
stranger to the three men, they wasted no time to show
their good will and great respect for him.

The flower-girl curtesied to the two distinguished
men. She was something more than a simple child
to them. She was the living proof of their scientific
investigations.

The fair auctioneer continued crying: âThree dollars
for each posy once; three dollars for each posy twice;
three dollars for each posyâââ

âFour dollars I bid!â cried the blear-eyed, spotted
faced, bald-headed, dissipated looking man. âFour
dollars, I say.
Four
dollars, I say.â

The pretty child made a curtesy to the fair auctioneer,
and cried: âNo, no, seÃ±orita, take not the money
of so bad a man.â

Prostrating herself before the great benefactor of
his people, she continued:

25
âYour Honor, shield me from so bad a man! I
would go hungry and sleep
en la calle
sooner than
live well, from the
dinero
of so bad a man.
Tengo
hambre, tengo hambre!
But let me die for want of
food; let me die. I cannot look in the face of so vile
a man.â The child turned her face, so full of fright
and abhorrence, toward the man she loathed, and as she
cried in a voice full of agony: âGo, great demon, go!â
she fainted away.

The great good man to whom she so piteously appealed,
lifted her tenderly in his arms and laid her
on the couch in Julio Murilloâs little study.

The fair auctioneer followed and devoted her time
immediately to restoring the child, aided by Julio
Murillo.

The Governor returned to the reception-room and
placing himself in front of the repulsive stranger, said:

âGive an account of the strange actions of the little
girl toward you. If you have done that fair child, who
is modesty and purity itself, an injury, it must be repaired
at once, and on your bended knees at that. Explain
matters, sir!â

âI do not know the child,â began the man.

âThat is not the case,â quickly responded Guillermo
Gonzales and Mr. Niksab in one voice.

âI beg of your Honor, and you, my friends, to believe
me. I, J. Ecarg, have never injured a child in
my life. I never saw the girl until this moment. I
beg of your Honor to have faith in my statements. I
know nothing of this child whatever.â

âRemember,â said Mr. Niksab, as he handed him a

26
glass of liquid, which he put to his lips and quickly
drained. â
Remember
,â he again repeated, as he took
the empty glass and placed it on the stand. âIt is
Memory we are cultivating. Memory, John;
Memory
.â

âWith your Honorâs consent we will take this subject
into the reflection-room,â said the great scientist. âHe
is one with whom we have been experimenting.â

Mr. Niksab and the scientist supported Mr. Ecarg on
either side.

ââMemory Fluidâ is beginning to do its work, and
remorse of conscience makes him limp,â said Mr.
Niksab.

âThis is a great worldâa wonderful age of scientific
discovery. Pass, gentlemen, into the reflection-room.
Pass at once. I am rejoiced to know that we have another
clue which may in some way lead to valuable information
concerning the one subject which is consuming
the greater part of our present investigations,â concluded
the Governor.

Mr. Ecarg very much resembled a man who, after
years of dissipation was now entering upon one of his
big monthly or weekly drunks.

As the trio was passing from the Governorâs presence,
the scientist said:

âDoes memory not recall this man, your Honor? I
am sure of him. A glorious victory is close at hand.â

In a thoughtful mood the Governor followed them to
the door, through which they disappeared from view,
but he made no response to the scientistâs question.

CHAPTER III.

THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT DIAZ.

The two great scientists, SeÃ±or Don Miguel Lehumada
and SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales, had been more
successful in their treatment with âLiquid from the
Sunâs Raysââor âMemory Fluid,â as their wonderful
discovery had become to be knownâthan their most
sanguine hope for its success could have been in the
start.

Their belief in the first place was that they had
secured a fluid from the Sun, which would under
proper conditions destroy every species of bacteria in
man; that while the death of disease was taking place,
each of the mental faculties and the spiritual nature of
man as well, would begin taking on its normal condition,
and when the body became freed from all depleting
causes, these faculties would be in a condition to
rise to a high degree of development. Further, they
believed that the fluid they had discovered would have a
particular effect upon the memory; not only in restoring
it to its normal condition, but in causing it to bring
to mind every incident in oneâs life.

But strange to say, their wonderful fluid went further
in its effect upon memory, than the present life of the
person upon whom the experiments were being carried.

28
It penetrated the sarcophagus of every previous existence
and resurrected every thought and experience.
It mirrored all the physical, social and spiritual environments,
of each life of the person as plainly to him
as if they were occurrences of yesterday instead of the
remembrances of events in oneâs other lives; which he
had lived perhaps ages and ages ago.

It was not until many experiments had been performed
successfully, and the remembrances of each subject
faithfully recorded, that they let the public know
of their wonderful achievements.

Then it received its first knowledge of the scientific
investigations and the results, of the two scholarly men
of Chihuahua through the medium of the workââLiquid
from the Sunâs Raysâ by the distinguished
Governor of the State.

The eyes of the entire world were centered upon them
at this time, watching intently for their great test case
to be concluded. A case which they claimed would furnish
the world sufficient proof to convince it, that their
great discovery, âMemory Fluid,â accomplished all they
claimed for it and very much more.

On his return from âthe States,â the Governor had
said, that in twenty-four-hoursâ time they would have
sufficient proof collected to enable them to give the results
of their test case to the public. And in truth,
they did have; but complications had arisen which
would result in them being able to give stronger proof
of the effect of âMemory Fluidâ upon mind and matter.

But these very complications would require time for
arrangement, and the public must wait. The eager,

29
avaricious public, tale-bearing public, panted with suspense,
caused by the delay.

The two great men were in no hurry; they had
reached their present plane of advancement by a succession
of lives carefully planned during one hundred
and fifty years.

Fifty years seems a long time for the single life of
one man, and it is. But when a person with a mind so
full of desire for knowledge is cut off at the end of fifty
years, the time seems short. He is cut off at an age in
which he is in a condition to begin to take on higher
and better knowledge. It is the desire for a continuance,
on a higher plane, in a physical life that causes one
to return to earth and take up the new life where the old
left off.

The press spoke of the two scientists as marvels of
the day. It claimed that history did not record any
great discovery to have been made by men so young as
the discoverers of âMemory Fluid,â hence they were
spoken ofânot without satire, howeverâas being inspiredâand
their discoveryâif it contained a grain of
truthâas a miracle.

Ten years previous these two great men, living in
the same city, meeting only occasionally and then as
strangers, had for many years secretly recognized each
other as a compatriot, a fellow-student; a friend in other
lives, two other lives long since passed away. Yet for
the want of more confidence in self; for the courage to
confront his fellowman and avow his knowledge of a
superior soul development, and physical advancement,
each held aloof.

30
The occasion for mutual acknowledgment arrived.
It was a supreme moment. They fell on each otherâs
necks and wept for pure joy. From that moment they
spent hours each day reviewing events of their past;
studying to develop the present, to bring about by
scientific discoveries, a means which would show to the
world that the sins committed in this body must be appeased
on earth; if not in the life in which the sins were
committed, then in another life. Perhaps the guilty
one would pass through several lives unmolested; but
the day of reckoning, however, certainly would come,
retribution would surely overtake every evil doer.

The result of their investigations was the famous
âMemory Fluid,â which accomplished for them more
than they hoped.

It was with much amusement often, that the two wise
men discussed the subject of their youth, at which the
public marveled. How well they knew they were
not
young
in experience, or years. It was laughable to read
the statements of the credulous editors, credulous from
a materialistic point of view; but wholly incredulous
when it came to questions of spiritualistic discussion.

The age in which they now lived was more in sympathy
with materialistic ideas than in any of their
previous existences. They were not surprised, for it
seemed prophetic that evil, that materialistic views,
should reach the pinnacle of fame before a revolution
would occur which would demolish their false ideas.
And they had hoped that the revolution was near at
handâand they prayed that it might be brought about
by their wonderful discovery. Victory was sure to follow.

31
And what a glorious victory it would be! A
victory of life over death; of health over disease; of
spirit over flesh; of the righting of all wrong; of the
assurance of everlasting life.

Events which pointed very plainly to materialistic
and spiritualistic controversy were taking place on every
hand, yet the masses adhered to materialistic views or to
the dogmatic teachings of the churches.

A hundred and thirty-eight years had passed since the
American Continent was convulsed by an internal revolution.
This revolution took place immediately upon the
death of President Diaz, of the Republic of Mexico.

It was a short and terrible conflict. At the earnest
solicitation of all State officials; of the entire army; of
a large majority of the professional fraternity; of prominent
people of wealth and business, the United States
interfered in behalf of the law-abiding citizens of the
Republic; and quelled the internal revolt.

The mere presence of the army of the United States
upon Mexican soil, the fact of the army of so great a
nation occupying their soil, not by force, but by the
earnest pleadings of many of the best citizens of Mexico,
those who wished to see the republican form of government,
established by General Diaz, continued, was
enough within itself to keep the small parties of revolutionists
in each state quelled.

Only a small number of fights occurred, and in each
but very few lives were lost.

During the year the American army occupied Mexico,
and many of her best war ships were anchored off the
Mexican coast for further protection, the Mexican people

32
convinced themselves thoroughly of their impossibility
to maintain a republican form of government when
there were so many small factions fighting for the
rulership of the nation; and there was not a man in the
army or in any other vocation of life, who had the confidence
of the educated sufficiently to unite them, or the
power to hold the peons and rabble in submission.

Toward the close of the year the state of their unsettled
condition was awful to behold. Something must be
done, and that quickly; or a fearful struggle, a long
war would take place.

It was finally decided to ask, to petition the American
government to annex the Mexican Republic to the
United States of America, without any delay, provided
three-fourths of the States of Mexico and a majority of
voters in the Federal District desired it.

The day set on which votes for and against annexation
should be cast was the same day of the month on
which occurred the birth of General Porfirio Diazâthe
greatest leader they had ever known; the maintainer
of peace and progress in their landâthe fifteenth of
September.

The scenes enacted on the day of voting made another
black page in the history of the Mexican people.

The combined effort of the Mexican army in favor of
annexation and the army of occupation saved the country
from a most fearful homicide.

The rabble set to work by the priesthood, who seemed
to think the day especially set apart for them to gain
prominence by helping to defeat the annexation question,
caused the trouble. Their people plundered, murdered,

33
set fire to the homes and business houses of
prominent people whom they knew were in favor of
annexation.

It certainly required months for the vast army of
rabble to be organized and drilled, to be able to accomplish
so much evil before their nefarious deeds became
known, before they started out upon their grand parade
of open revolt. Notwithstanding there was an organization
of this kind in the capital of every state in the
Republic, a very large majority of the States went for
annexation.

A petition for immediate annexation was presented to
the Government of the United States by a large and
representative body of Mexican citizens, which pleaded
for an extra session of Congress to convene, which occurred
with results satisfactory to each nation. And
Mexico became a part of the United States of America
without further delay. More than one hundred years
had passed since the memorable event, and Mexico had
grown to be possibly the most important part of the
United States.

There had been a long reign of peace and prosperity,
and the fact that this part of the United States had
been, long ago, a hot-bed for internal revolution, was
only known to the present generation by reading from
the pages of history an account of her brave people
struggling for independenceâstruggling for enlightenment;
for the maintenance of a republican form of
government.

The two great scientists and their most able coworker
were of purely Mexican origin; in no existence previous

34
to this one had there ever been any mixing of blood.

Governor Lehumada took no especial pride in the
fact that there was no Anglo-Saxon or other than his
native Latin blood in his veins.

Neither did the other two great scientistsâGuillermo
Gonzales or Julio Murillo. They had no prejudices;
they were too intelligent and learned. They advocated
intermarriage of the races. They believed that
it was necessary for a high degree of intelligence to be
preserved.

However, their own existenceâthe very high degree
of their intellectuality and spiritual development was
an exception to the rule they advocated.

There are people who without apparent cause carry
prejudices in families for hundreds of years, and while
their real feeling may not have any publicity, is only
due to the fact that no occasion presented itself for them
to declare their opinions.

There are a few of this class of people living in the
capital of Chihuahua, who pride themselves on the fact
that they have never crossed the Rio Grande; that they
do not speak the English language; that they have no
associates amongst the Anglo-Saxon American people.
These persons are not without influence, often being
people of wealth and position; and they now believed
their time had come to make known their views concerning
the race question.

Many of the large newspapers were full of the absurd
ideas of these people. They claimed that the wonderful
discoveries of their two townsmen were due to the
fact that through their veins coursed no foreign blood.

35
They claimed they could see through the shadows events
which foretold the complete extinction of the Anglo-Saxon
race on American soil and the re-establishment
of the Mexican Republic. Sensational papers published
their articles, and wise people laughed at them
over their morning meal.

When questioned about the opinions of their countrymen,
the Governor and SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales impressed
their interviewers with the fact that they were
perfectly intolerant of such restricted ideas. That it
was very embarrassing to them, being of purely Mexican
descent, and striving to bring about a means for
the improvement of man, to be held up for a target at
which the known world would hurl its anathemas.

They now knew no nativity save the United States of
America; they knew no Master but God.

They held in esteem only such people who were striving
to improve their physical and spiritual state. They
held no one in contempt because he was poor, ignorant,
dissipated; full of disease and depravity. They knew
the time was close at hand when a desire would be born
within the soul of each for a knowledge of Truth; that
the scales of disease which obscured the light from their
soul would decay, and victory would cry out. These
very people who secretly hated their foster-mother were
the stumbling-blocks to every enterprise, headed by a
person of Anglo-Saxon origin, particularly if the advocator
be of American parentage and was born in the
United States north of the Rio Grande.

They aided and abetted the clergy. They fought
strenuously against any modern improvements in the

36
Catholic Church. Their ancestors were so bold once,
that they held a meeting of indignation, when some of
their brethren of more modern ideas were determined
that the poor of the church, as well as the rich, should
have comfortable seats; they contended that it was a
relic of slavery and heathenism for people to prostrate
themselves on a dirty floor to worship.

The voluptuous, avaricious priests hated to see the
innovation. They knew it meant a waning of their
power. Yet when questioned by the advanced members
of their flock, they could not refuse their consent.

The opposing party were petted and pampered by the
priest, who consoled them by sayingâand truthfullyâthat
upon them the salvation of the church rested. It
was a terrible, terrible day when the long, barren
church, save for the candelabras, the paintings of the
saints and images of Marie and Jesus, and its wonderful
altar of purple and gold, was furnished with
comfortable seats for the poor; the very poor, who with
their
centavos
,
centavos
(which they obtained mostly by
begging and plundering), helped to build the magnificent
cathedrals, and entirely supported a vast army
of parasitic creatures called priests, in idleness and voluptuousness.

The few in Chihuahua who were so unfortunate as to
have for their ancestors a class of people wedded to
catholicism as practiced in Mexico in 1899, and adhered
to it, needed the sympathy of every enlightened person
seeking for spiritual knowledge.

Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir was the most prominent
member of the few who resented the present

37
rÃ©gime
of things, simply because his forefathers did
a hundred and thirty-eight years ago. He was a man
of great wealth. He insisted on the âDonâ before his
name and invariably signed his motherâs name, Falomir,
to his own, as was the custom then.

His family ate
tortillas
and
frijoles
three times a
day; drank
pulque
,
aqua miel
,
mescal
, and
aguarâdiente
âthe
latter two when they wished their troubles
drowned; both of which are powerful intoxicants.

The male members of the family wore
sombreros
,
short ornamental coats, sashes of many colors; and
skin-tight trousers of light colors. The women and
girls of the family wore black
rebozos
, and lace
mantillas

over their heads; the
criada
cooked on the
brasero
, and
never failed to serve
ensaladas
and
tomales
on holidays
and feast days as was the custom from time immemorial
up to the date the Republic became a part of the
United States. This family was spoken of by their
townsmen as oddities and were rather liked for their old-fashioned
ideas; they were hospitable to the extreme
with their own countrymen, and generous to a fault to
the poor of Mexican lineage who adhered to the religion
of their fathers. They were unobtrusive in social affairs
and political affairs, but interfered in everything commercial
where it was possible.

Their interference was always in a quiet way, however,
and attracted the attention of no one but those
directly interested. They inherited the cunning and
silence of their ancestors and acquired more unconsciously,
by long contact with races which held them
in submission. It required no effort to conceal their

38
real feeling toward the country of which they were now
a part, which took them under its protecting wing at the
earnest solicitation of their best people at a time when
the growing Republic was bereft of its main support;
the great and noble leader, Diaz, who caused every
avenue of progress to be opened up for his people. A
man who loved the Mexican people, for whom he had
fought and labored, next to his God. The American
people claimed him as one of their heroes, and even
the present generation honor his memory with as much
fervor as if he had been one of them, as if the Republic
he established and maintained had been a part of the
States.

Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomirâs ancestors belonged
to the faction which strove to make the Church
stronger; to the faction opposed to Diazism, to progress.
He seemed to take an uncanny pride in nourishing
the frightful skeleton he had inherited.

Little did he think that the very fact that he made
bold to step out and hold an indignation meeting, like
his ancestors, against the âpowers that be,â that the
cherished skeleton would be brought forth and aired
with a result of disaster to his present life, that is,
disaster in a certain way. As much as Don Francisco
R. Cantu y Falomir hated, or pretended to hate, the
Americans and their language, he had now in his employ
a poor, but highly educated young American woman,
Helen Hinckley. She spoke his language and understood
it as perfectly as if it were her native tongue.

She had no prejudices against the race from which her
employer claimed to have sprung. She rather admired

39
the quaint, old-fashioned customs to which he and his
family adhered.

She was evidently of strictly American origin. She
had no relative, no home, and no money but what she
earned. She described herself as a lost spirit roving
over the world in search of friends and a permanent
abiding-place. That was the only answer she gave herself
or anyone else, when questioned why she was alone
and in Chihuahua or any other place. She had been in
Chihuahua only one night, when she read in the great
daily,
The Chihuahuan
, the next morning, the advertisement
of her present employer, which stated that he
wanted an educated American who understood the
Spanish as well as his own tongue, who was quiet and
unobtrusive, to act as secretary. He preferred a person
with no family ties; and one who would consent to live
in his family for a year. Whatever salary such a person
required for his services would be forthcoming at
the end of each month.

When Helen Hinckley walked into the old-fashioned
adobe house standing in the center of a large garden,
around which was the old-time high adobe wall, and
stood in the magnificent
patio
gazing at the rare flowers,
beautiful birds and sparkling fountain, she felt as if
she were not a stranger to these very scenes. She was
startled and yet made very happy, neither of which feelings
could she account for.

When shown into the long reception-room she showed
her surprise, to see it full of applicants eager to get the
position for which she had come to apply.

She was about to retire, for she was sorry for these

40
earnest breadwinners, whose only happiness seemed to
be in material existence. Besides, she felt intuitively
that if she applied, all of those present, who needed the
position worse than herself, would go away with a heavy
heart, still she lingered in the
patio
.

To the left of the room where the many applicants
breathlessly waited to know their fate, was the small
but well-appointed office of Don Francisco R. Cantu y
Falomir, where, one at a time, he examined the applicants.

When he saw Helen, he stepped to the open door and
said: âOblige me, seÃ±orita, by passing into my private
office.â He immediately dismissed the other applicants
with the quiet and polite information that he had
secured one whose recommendations were all he required.
He further told them that he hoped they would
soon secure employment, as no doubt they were all competent,
and (with a ring of satire in his voice), being
Americanos, were deserving. No great change had come
over Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, yet judging
by the great enthusiasm and cordiality with which he
greeted Helen Hinckley, on his return to his private
office, it seemed to indicate quite differently.

âPardon me, seÃ±orita,â he said in greeting, âbut I
took the liberty to say to the other applicants that
I had employed a competent person as my secretary,
meaning you. I hope you will do me the honor to
serve me in this capacity. In fact, you are the person
whom I have had in mind. Your duties will be light;
in fact, for some time to come, all the day will be yours.
I have only one request to make, and that is, while in my

41
house, you will have no social intercourse with my wife
and children; that you will stay closely in your own
room or in some quiet spot in the garden which my
family do not frequent. When I want your services I
will send the
mozo
for you. A
mozo
, saddle horse, and
carriage are at your disposal. You are from this
moment to be at no expense. Every comfort of home
life we will supply you free, and your salary I will pay
now. How much do you require? Will you stay?â

Helen Hinckley replied without any hesitation:
âSir, you are courteous and generous to the extreme.
I thank you. I will enter into your employment at
once. I want for my services, five hundred dollars a
month.â

Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir stepped to his
desk and handed her the first monthâs salary in shining
gold; directed a dreamy-eyed
criada
to show the
seÃ±orita to her room, and sent
un mozo de cordel
to the
hotel for all of her belongings.

CHAPTER IV.

THE PLUNGER FROM KANSAS.

Events of great importance were crowding themselves
thick and fast upon the attention of more people
in the capital of Chihuahua than the leader of his
people, the Governor, and his able coworker, Guillermo
Gonzales, and Julio Murillo, his assistant.

Governor Lehumada had long been practicing to
make his personal desires subordinate to a very high
standard of right. He had fixed his sole purpose of
thought upon a desire to bring about a means for the
recovery of memory.

He had received many impressions through the gift
he had of placing the spiritual world first in his
thoughts and his actions.

Evil he believed to be the result of a microbic condition
of matter. The happy results obtained by the
rise of the âMemory Fluid,â were turning the tide of
thought into a more spiritual channel, the fact of which
was in itself sufficient compensation for the years of
labor the great men had had in bringing about their
scientific discovery of âMemory Fluid.â

The name of Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir
had within the last ten days become a household word.
At first most every one looked upon his ideas, as portrayed

43
by the press, as a big joke; but now the clergy
had made bold (for they believed their staunch supporter
had a big following,) to attack âMemory Fluidâ
as an enemy of life, as a messenger of evil. Yet they
hailed it as their mascot, for they claimed to believe
that, though a great evil within itself, through it
would come a revolution which would result in the re-establishment
of the Church and the Mexican Republic,
which would be controlled by the former.

The very audacity of such statements made the public
stop to pant; and a few stopped a little longer to
think
.

Governor Lehumada was reviewing the ideas advanced
by Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, and
hoped to be given the light which would enable him
to see the outcome. So intent was he with â
his feast
with his soul
,â as he termed his moments of abstraction,
that he did not notice that Mr. Niksab had returned to
the reception-room. âYour Honor,â spoken in a rather
loud voice, caused the Governor to start and look
around.

âPardon me,â he said, âI did not hear you, so intent
was I reflecting upon all that we have just witnessed.â

Mr. Niksab bowed, and continued: âThe scientist
requests me to say to you that the subject now under
treatment is undergoing some wonderful changes, and
your Honor will do him a great favor by witnessing
the workings of âMemory Fluid.ââ

âWith much pleasure. We will enter at once. It
is the eternal spirit that is calling out to him. He
hears, thank God, he hears.â

Guillermo Gonzales waved the Governor and Mr.

44
Niksab to seats near the table upon which J. Ecarg lay.
His body was undergoing great pain; convulsion after
convulsion shook his frame. His face was ghastly and
his features contorted.

Mr. Niksabâs whole nervous system was wrought up
to the highest pitch, out of sympathy for his friend.
Not able to sit by calmly and witness the fearful convulsions,
he arose:

âGreat God!â he exclaimed. âIt is death!â

âIt is death,â quietly assented the scientist, Guillermo
Gonzales, which statement was approved by a nod from
the heads of the Governor and Julio Murillo.

Mr. Niksab knelt by the side of his friend, and cried
aloud: âGreat God, spare him a while longer, that he
may have time to repent.â

âArise, my friend,â said the GovernorââThis is not
the passing away of your friend. It is only the death
of diseases which have been holding him down to darkness
more than two hundred years.â

âGive yourself no uneasiness,â added Guillermo Gonzalesââyour
friend is only reaching the point where
he can live.â

âHark!â said Julio Murillo. âVictory is close at
hand. Memory will assert itself soon.â

The prophecy of the Mexican was soon to be fulfilled.
J. Ecarg drew himself up and said without the
least hesitation: âI remember the circumstances perfectly.
I kept a hostelry of some repute in this city
then. That was in the fall of the year 1898. Being the
largest city within only a short distance of the Rio
Grande, the beautiful and progressive Mexican city had

45
become known, and not without much regret from
the law-abiding Mexicans, as a rendezvous for many
Americans who were refugees from justice. As a rule
I was not in favor of shielding my countrymen; but my
heart went out to a young man who was in such distress,
such great mental torture. He called upon me late the
very night of his arrival in Chihuahua, and on bended
knee begged me to shield him from the fury of the
law. He had no remorse of conscience for the wrongs
he had committed. His only fear was the juzado.
He most likely would have committed the same offences
upon Mexican soil the day of his arrival, if there had
been the slightest opportunity, and if he had not felt
sure that he would have to face the four bare walls of
a prison for the remainder of his life. There was a
man in the cityâan American, of good birth and education,
a prospector and railroad manâwho was my
friend in every sense of the word. He spoke the Mexican
tongue without a flaw. I appealed to him to find a
place of refuge on some
hacienda
, for our distressed
countryman. My friend said:

ââYour will is mine. But tell me, John, what is the
name of this refugee from justice?â

ââHe is known,â I replied, âas âThe Plunger from
Kansas.âââ

A cry rang out through the room, as if some animal
of high mettle had been wounded.

Every one jumped to his feet and the look of pain
and surprise was quite visible on each face.

From whence had the unearthly cry come? was the
unspoken question on the white lips of all save Mr.
Niksab. They soon understood.

46
âHe is my friend. John, do you not remember? It
was I, Niksab, who took âThe Plunger from Kansasâ in
a coach, on a dark, rainy night, to a cabin in the mountains
on the
hacienda
of Don Alberto Ulloa. I supplied
him with the necessities of life, and there he remained
for many weeks in fear and trembling. You
know me, now, John, donât you?â

John did not reply; he had lapsed into a cataleptic
state, and his anxious listeners were doomed to wait for
further evidence, which would help to conclude their
test case.

Mr. Niksab walked the floor and wrung his hands:
âHe is dead now, I am sure,â he cried; but the great
author of âMemory Fluidâ put his hand upon his
shoulder in a brotherly fashion, and in a quiet, reassuring
voice said:

âAgain you are mistaken. It is only a further death
of the millions of microbes which breed disease in his
body.â

âAh, I forget,â said Mr. Niksab.

âYou are not freed from the awful gnawings of the
creatures yourself; but it is not to
forget
that you are
here. It is, on the other hand,
to remember
,â replied
the Governor.

Marriet Motuble had entered the room unobserved by
all, and now astonished them by saying: âYouâre
right, Governor; youâre right. It is memory we must
cultivate while under your roof. Itâs a good thing for
John that he has sunk into his present state of semiconsciousness,
or I am afraid I would be compelled
to make him acknowledge his great sins by means of

47
physical force, which is a shorter route to punishment
than your âMemory Fluid.â I think a good thumping
would do John good; or a bullet through his head might
be better.â

These coarse remarks were not joined in by anyone,
but she was in nowise abashed. They pitied her for
her coarse, vulgar mind. They knew her time was not
far distant, however. The scientists busied themselves
quietly with their chemical instruments, now and then
glancing up (out of courtesy) at some remark she made,
to which, however, they made no response.

Mr. Niksab sat in a corner of the same room, his head
between his hands in deep thought, lost, it seemed, to
everything around him. The fair-haired, aggressive
seÃ±orita walked, or rather stalked back and forth in
the room, her thumbs in a pocket on either side of her
short coat.

âI remember, too, that blear-eyed reprobate, the

subject
yonderâthat was the name by which the medical
students called such people in years gone by. They
called them that in the year of 1898ââ99, did they not,
friend Niksab?â

Mr. Niksab started from his reverie, looked at the
seÃ±orita with a strange look in his eyes, and said: âI
believe so,â and at once lapsed into another silence.

âYou are correct,â said the Governor. âYou have
been, I believe, a Subject here also. I am not mistaken,
am I? For our âMemory Fluidâ we can claim
another victory, then.â

Marriet Motuble stood in her favorite position, a smile
of amusement on her face, listening to the Governor.

48
She openly respected and secretly admired him. All the
impulses of her loving heart, which were many, went
out to the great man. Hers was a terrible love, and woe
to the man who aroused her love and failed to reciprocate
it. She did not take her eyes from his handsome
face,âher eyes which spoke volumes of love, and shone
with the light of a furious passion.

In this frame of mind she approached him closely,
and said: âYour Honor is mistaken. I have never
been a âsubjectâ in your illustrious institution.â

âBut,â interrupted the Governor, âyou remember.â

âYes, âtis true; and more, perhaps, than many would
care to hear,â she replied.

âCan you explain how this great memory came to be
a part of you? Aye, it is possible you do remember
many things which evil-doers in the great life of the
past, did those who are here again for a purpose by Divine
arrangement who would prefer not to have their
past brought to light. But the just management of all
things eternal cannot be changed. Physical man must
be the adjuster of all evil, through the awakening of
his soul. It matters not how strongly they fight against
it, it is the inevitable. And it is a struggle often.â

âYou are dead right there, Governor,â replied Marriet
Motuble. âOur friend John over there is undergoing
a great struggle now,â and she laughed a fiendish
laugh, as she continued promenading back and forth in
the room. âPoor devil; if he were in his right mind
now, he no doubt, would prefer to die and go straight
to that place the orthodox ministers said existed, many
years ago, to terrify their flocks into submissionâpossibly,

49
if he thought he would be allowed to stay there
forever, rather than be a âSubjectâ and undergo what is
now taking place.â

In an earnest and serious tone Guillermo Gonzales
said: âYour argument, dear seÃ±orita, is false. A
seeking for the Eternalâafter the things not comprehended
by the sensesâcannot be brought about by compulsion;
no physical force can make the change. It
is the desire for a knowledge of the Eternal; for a communion
with spirits, which causes the change; the
death of disease; the return of memory, the final life.â

Marriet Motuble, on hearing this, was again convulsed
with laughter; but finally controlling herself,
said: âThat is all very fine, and sounds well, and
might apply very well to most every one, but to
John
âha!
ha!âto Johnânever! The only way to cure him,
to be sure of him, is to put him into a yawning abyss
of that Ebony Fluid you extract from the âSunâs Rays,â
and which, I believe, you claim, if it can be produced in
sufficient quantities, would be able to destroy not only all
things physical, but those very things which are thought
now by everybody, except possibly your honored selves,
to be Eternal.â

The three wise men dropped the instruments they
were casually examining, on the hard, polished floor,
where they were broken into a thousand pieces. Her
statement confounded them. With questioning looks
they gazed into each otherâs faces, and then at the implacable
seÃ±orita. They knew that besides themselves
no one on earth had been told of the âEbony Fluid.â
In fact, they had discussed the probable use to which

50
it could be put in hushed tones, in the sanctity of their
most private study.

Julio Murillo was the first to gain control of himself,
and addressing the seÃ±orita, said: âIf we were living
in the year of 1898âat that time when Hermannism
was in vogue, when the ignorant, the credulous often
employed these delvers in mechanical spirits, and paid
them large sums to look into the future and disclose
their fateâI say, if we were back in that infant age of
spiritualistic progressâI would at once avow that you
had been to see one of those prophets.â

Marriet Motuble replied: âYou forget, friend Julio,
that I, as well as yourself, existed years ago. Then you
were not so distinguished as now. We lived in the very
year about which you have just spoken. Women were
then said to be mysterious beings, as well as the beings
who could fathom all secrets. The Great One to whom
you pay silent tribute, has seen fit through all these
years to perpetuate the gentler (?) sex, and with much
the same disposition she then had. But really, gentlemen,
it is unbecoming in me to be telling three renowned
scientists, discoverers of âMemory Fluid,â about
what existed at a previous age, or how I came into possession
of a knowledge of your âEbony Fluid.â Besides,
I am lingering longer than my time admits. Pour some
more âMemory Fluidâ down John, so he will call to
mind his own offspring lying in a semi-conscious state
in the adjoining room.â

âWhat is the meaning of your words, Miss Motuble?
Let me entreat you to linger a few moments longer
and explain. You can aid us materially in making this
affair clear.â

51
Miss Motubleâs eyes shone with love, and with outstretched
hands she started toward the object of her
affection, and in a low voice, yet plainly audible to all
present, said: âDearie!â

Her whole nature changed outwardly in an instant.
She whirled her large frame around as easily as if it
worked on pivots, and walking to the door, said:
âThere are other days, gentlemen, other days. Patience
is a necessary requisite to success. You will pardon me
if I leave now. Julio, thy motherâs seducer, thy father,
is heading the present movement against the State.â

âImpossible!â they exclaimed in one breath. âRetribution
overtook him in his first existence. Impossible!â

Again she gave way to a fit of laughter, and said:
âImpossible, hey? nothing is impossible. Don Francisco
R. Cantu y Falomir has evidently not been recognized
by you. Ha! ha! Well, this is an age of discovery!â
Stepping up to Mr. Niksab (who still sat on
a low chair, his face buried in his hands, seemingly unconscious
to everything taking place around him), she
slapped him soundly on the shoulder, a custom with
men of bad breeding, in the nineteenth century, who
were very friendly with each other and demonstrated
their friendliness by this coarse greeting. He sprang
to his feet and looked in a bewildered way all around
him. âHa! ha! ha! ha! Friend Niksab, you can
have your hand in the righting of a few other wrongs,
if you say so.â

âI am aiding the great scientists,â he interrupted,
âby helping to find living proofs of the wrongs committed
by the âPlunger from Kansas.ââ

52
âThe poor Plunger is getting it on every side; getting
thumped by this scientific hail,â she replied.

âIn what way, Miss Motuble,â quietly asked the
Governor, âcan Mr. Niksab be of further assistance to
our scientific investigations?â

She made him no immediate reply, but laughingly
said in a familiar tone: âNicky, the fellow who murdered
your brother, rifled your safe, stole all those
cÃ¡ntaras

of
pulque
, and
mescal
, and skins of
tequila
, when
you âkept barâ at the Palacio, is here now, less a notch or
so as things go in social affairs at present. You remember
him, donât you, Nicky?â

âThere seems to be coming over me a dim remembrance
of the person you speak of and the circumstance
you relate; but I am not clear.â

âGovernor, give him more âMemory Fluid,â and he
will nail the villain in twenty-four hours.â

âWhat position does he now occupy?â asked Guillermo
Gonzales. âI am anxious to know, as you say he
is a notch higher in the social scale than in his other
life.â

âHe is president of the Maguey Paper Factory, and
is as dishonest now, in a polite way, as he was in that
memorable year, in an uproarious fashion. He is not
contented with the immense profit he derives from the
sale of the superior paper he manufactures, but he takes
the dry maguey leaves, boils them for daysâuntil they
are in a pulpâstrains it; ferments the liquid and sells
it for a kind of rum, which he claims will cure insanity,
and I, for one, believe him. I have personally known
a dozen or more credulous peopleâthose who are

53
always taking something to aid digestion or strengthen
the mindâI say, I believe in this drinkâbecause they
lived only a few days after taking it âaccording to directions.â
The poor demented creatures are now âcuredâ
for one existence at least. It is called âPerpetuity
Miel.ââ

âAh, let me think,â said the Governor;  âlet me think.
Iâhave received some samples of this rum, with a request
to partake of it sparingly, and recommend it to
the public.â (He opened a small glass cabinet and
took out a large bottle). âYes, here it is: âPerpetuity
Miel.â A strange name, composed of a Latin
and Anglo-Saxon word, meaning a sweet, endless duration.â

âDo you, Miguey, recall the name of the president of
the âMaguey Paper Companyâ?â

âI do not; I  do not. Strange, I do not know, he being
so prominent a man in the various commercial
fields,â replied the Governor.

Julio Murillo said: âHis name in a previous existence
was Henry Lexort.â

Mr. Niksab cried, as he clutched his fists and fought
at some unseen foes in the air, âThe same, the same;
he was killed at the Jockey Club for cheating in roulette.
He had returned to the city, in disguise, after
successfully evading the
rurales
âfor many months.
The great desire again to see the scene of his crime led
him back to Chihuahua, with the result I have just mentioned.â

âThat is a strange truth,â said the Governor, âthat
criminals more often than otherwise return to the scene

54
of their crimes. More than one has walked to his doom
by such rash actions.â

âThat is why I have such perfect confidence that the
âPlunger from Kansas,â although living his third life
since the date of his life in which he committed his
famous cattle robbery, will return to the scene of his
operations and to the city to which he fled to escape the
clutches of the law. But to return to the president of
the Maguey Paper Factory. It is quite unusual that
the name of so prominent a man in our midst is unknown
to five people of intelligence and education.â

âI will ascertain at once,â said Julio. âI will speak
over the fluid and have his secretary to give me his
full name and address. We may need it for future
reference.â

âDo not give yourself so much useless work, friend
Julio. I know the manâs genealogy as well as his present
name. I make it my business to find out the pedigree
of all such animals, such scorpions, and to air their
old skeletons, in the hope of helping them to take on a
new life; to hide their dry, marrowless bones with new
flesh and blood.â

The âSubjectâ on the table moved; then sat upright;
rubbed his eyes; looked beseechingly towards the door
and cried out: âMarriet, Marriet, have you forgotten
that I loved you in that time long ago?â

The four other occupants of the room turned to face
the woman he was thus beseeching, and behold, she
was gone.

CHAPTER V.

LIQUID FROM THE SUNâS RAYS.

Early the next morning the beautiful and progressive
capital of Chihuahua was in a state of more than
usual bustle.

Some time previous to this day a large body of
her representative citizens, amongst whom were more
than a thousand progressive women, had called upon the
Governor
en masse
, and secured his consent to lecture
upon, âLiquid from the Sunâs Rays.â

Chihuahua is a magnificently built city of over more
than one-half a million inhabitants. It is a large mining
center, railroad center, and educational center. Recently
its fame had spread abroad. The eyes of the entire
civilized world are riveted upon it. It is the home
and abiding-place of the greatest scientists the world
had ever known.

Scientific men and women from all over the world
came every day to see the city; the country which produced
such marvels of scientific wonder and spiritualistic
progress. The object in gathering such a large body
together to call upon and entreat the Governor to deliver
an address upon his and his coworkersâ great scientific
discovery, was their knowledge of his great timidity; of
how he personally disliked to appear before the public

56
and recount the wonders accomplished by their
âMemory Fluid.â

Through his book, âLiquid from the Sunâs Rays,â
they had gained their first and only knowledge of their
brilliant townsmenâs discovery. Committees of from
ten to one hundred had at various times since reading
the Governorâs wonderful book, besought him to deliver
a public address upon the subject, for their benefit. Invariably
he put them off in a polite way, saying: âAt
some future time.â Hoping, of course, that they would
weary at his many refusals, and cease to ask for a personal
explanation; that they would be satisfied with
reading his work.

Such was not the case. Persistence on the part of his
fellow-citizens won.

Now the early morning was alive with the persons
constituting the various committees who were appointed
to make the large theatre an Eden of loveliness; a place
befitting the great man who was to address them that
night, and the distinguished guests. The President of
the United States, accompanied by his entire family;
ministers from foreign countries who felt themselves
especially favored by their own country in being granted
a leave of absence from their post of duty, and to the
committee of Chihuahuans for the invitation, arrived
that morning on a special train, which was a veritable
drawing-room on wheels. This party was at once quartered
at the âMexican Annex,â a magnificent hostelry,
containing more than one thousand rooms. âIt occupies
two blocks of ground; it faces East on the Alameda;
it is five stories high, and built from the ground

57
to the roof, of a greyish-white marble,â said a prominent
member of the reception committee. âThe magnificent
pillars in the rotunda and those on the outside, which
support the five stories of open-air promenades around
the hotel, are solid onyx, carved in the most wonderful
designs. This famous hostelry is the private property
of the Governor, and is known throughout the States.
It is lighted and heated by a means known only to himself
and his two scientific coworkers. In each room
there are several small instruments, curiously designed,
back of pictures which represent, respectively, the face
of the sun, glaciers, and small furnaces. They are of
much interest to every person who visits the magnificent
hostelry, yet no one can conceive for what purpose the
curious little pictures are fastened so securely in the
walls and ceiling. By certain mechanical action, a
liquid extracted from the rays of the sun unites with
other liquids obtained from the same source, which is
concealed behind each picture, respectively. Then, if
light is desired, a miniature lever is moved which causes
the liquid concealed back of the picture of the face
of the sun to unite with another fluid with the result
that a soft, mellow light spreads over the house, which
gradually increases in power until a light of the brightness
required is obtained. On the same principle, if
heat is required, another lever is moved which unites a
fluid with another situated back of the small furnace,
and gradually the air rises, balmy and fragrant like the
air on a summer day in a garden of fragrant flowers
after a light shower. The small pictures of glaciers
represent the source from which cold is generated,â concluded

58
the gallant Chihuahuan. More detailed information
as to the lighting, heating and cooling of the
hostelry, were unknown to the reception committee who
were showing the distinguished visitors the many places
of interest in their famous city.

While they expressed their great delight with the entire
city, they unanimously voted the âMexican Annexâ
to be the most magnificent and beautiful hotel building
they had ever seen at home or abroad, and the most magnificent
building they had yet beheld in Chihuahua.

It was well that the last clause was added, for the
committee held in reserve a greater surprise for them.
Those who had never heard of their auditorium, their
great State theatre called âThe Goddess,â could scarcely
have imagined in their advanced day even, such a place
to have existed; a place of such great dimensions; of
such grandeur; of such beauty.

Chihuahua is honored by being the home of thousands
of beautiful women, who are likewise known for
their virtue and great intellects. These women indulge
in the amusements,âthe popular amusements of the
day,âbut never dissipate.

Many of them help to support large institutions of
learning by practicing various professions for that purpose,
and they do not think they are doing
charity
either.
They contend that they owe their efforts to the further
enlightenment of the age, that
their own soul
may grow
stronger. There are, on the other hand, thousands of
women in the city, beautiful women who have many of
the lighter accomplishments, who indulge in the most
hilarious forms of dissipation. Many of them likewise

59
move in the most distinguished, intellectual circles.
Yet these very circles are kept down; their progress retarded
from the very fact of the presence of these
women; women who have never felt the Divine power.

The entertainments given by these women teem with
brilliant repartee and sparkling wit. Wit made sparkling,
by the use of high-class wines.

The advent of so many distinguished people to the
capital of their state was a welcome opportunity for
them. All the morning they had paraded themselves
back and forth through the route taken by the reception
committee to best show off the city to their guests.

Most of them were becomingly attired in fashionable
gowns for morning outdoor wear. They sped along
noiselessly over the smooth streets in their chariot-like
carriages, that swayed back and forth in a most delicious
fashion.

Their vehicles were put into motion by means of
the simple effort of pressing the thumb against a small
button set in the center of the dash-board; and they
were turned in any direction by means of a small lever,
which required the slightest effort imaginable to handle.

These women succeeded in attracting the attention of
the President and his party,âjust what they were out
for, and were often close enough to hear the bursts of
admiration which unconsciously fell from the lips of
some of the gentlemen of the party who were very
susceptible to the charms of feminine beauty.

They returned to their homes in ecstasy, to refresh
their beauty by an afternoon siesta and bath; ready to
array themselves in their most gorgeous attire, in the

60
hope of meeting the distinguished visitors at the banquet
to be held immediately after the close of the Governorâs
lecture; to make further conquests, to gather fresh
laurels.

No one in the city was as little concerned over the
event about to transpire as the Governor. Getting
his own consent to appear before his people in the guise
of a scientist, of a wonderful discoverer, was the struggle.
It being over he looked upon the prospective lecture
seemingly with no more concern than if he were
about to make a Fourth of July speech. Yet such was
not quite the case. He was greatly concerned about the
result of his evening speech. Events had come in quick
succession, since his arrival home; important ones, that
dwelt directly upon the great chain of evidence he and
his coworkers were intent upon bringing to a close, and
he was now on the alert. He knew not at what moment
to expect the climax. Strict orders were given the
attendants at his home, that he was not to be molested
at any hour during the day. That the day must be his
own for thought.

The day before, he had caused the child Catalina
Martinet, the child who swooned in the study of the
scientist, to be removed to his own home, where she was
placed in charge of his housekeeper. He kept up the
most magnificent private home in the city. Many were
the mothers who sighed as they drove by, for some power
to entrap him for their daughters. They thought it a
sin for so beautiful a home to remain without a mistress.
The Governor was not disturbed by any of the
sighs or enticing looks. He pursued his scientific investigations

61
and at the same time he felt that through
them there would come to him a love that would make
his life, his soul, his spirit, a paradise on earth.

Catalina Martinet seemed to have no remembrance of
the strange occurrence of yesterday. When she awoke
from the peaceful sleep into which Guillermo Gonzales
and Julio Murillo had succeeded in getting her, she
was bright and gay. Instead of the careworn child of
yesterday out seeking her living, she looked and acted
like the happy child of wealthy and indulgent parents.
She clung to the Governor, embraced him fondly, and
called him âPapa.â All day long he had been communing
with self and silently watching the child, whose
every movement was a source of great wonder and delight
to him.

Dressed in a becoming gown of very fine texture, she
alone accompanied the great man to the theatre.

The large auditorium of the theatre was full, every
seat occupied, and most all available standing room was
filled with the small, but strong spring seats that came
up from the floor by a touch, when required to help seat
the great crowds that thronged to the auditorium whenever
the Governor was billed to address his people.

Applause after applause went up from the large
audience when the person for whom they waited in
breathless silence appeared upon the stage.

Exclamations of surprise and admiration were heard
on every side when the people saw the pretty child.
She sat facing them with the complacency of a queen,
throughout the entire lecture.

In the large private boxes sat the President of the

62
United States and the representatives from foreign
countries which came with him.

It was an event of great annoyance to the Governor
to find, in one of the most conspicuous seats of the
private box where the President and family sat, Marriet
Motuble.

On his way to the theatre he had called for a few
moments at the Mexican Annex, to pay his respects to
the Chief Executive and the distinguished representatives
of foreign countries present.

Now he only bowed to them, and wondered how the
aggressive seÃ±orita made the acquaintance with the
party; by whose invitation she had a seat in the box.

He felt his mind wandering and it was with much
effort he was able to concentrate his thoughts upon the
subject of his lecture. His discourse led up in a modest
way to âMemory Fluid,â by mentioning the many discoveries
they had made before they began to experiment
to find a fluid, directly from the source of light which
would perpetuate Memory through all time. That
while working with the instrument which condensed the
moisture from the sunâs rays to a liquid, they discovered
it had a very strange effect upon whichever one of the
three workers who always conducted the experiments,
when the fluid had reached a certain stage. A generous
sample of the fluid at that peculiar stage was put away
for future experiments. In the meantime they perfected
their âHeat and Lightâ fluid and put it into practical
use.

At this point in the history of their discoveries,
Guillermo Gonzales stepped upon the stage. He was

63
received with a storm of applause. He returned the
greeting with a smile and low bow. The Governor continued:
âMy able coworker will show you one of the
uses to which we have put this fluid in our own city.â

Then while Guillermo Gonzales turned the light off
and on, and made the room very hot, then cool, the
Governor pointed to the large picture of the face of the
sun in the center of the ceiling and told them that it
was the source of the artificial light which they saw in
the room, and the heat they felt.

âBack of the face,â he explained, âis a small glass
bulb which holds two ounces of liquid, which, to make
very clear to you, I will call the Principal liquid. This
fluid is used in the production of heat, light and cold.
Extending from the bulb are ten thousand small
glass tubes, through some of which this liquid flows to
the center of each miniature picture of the face of the
sun on the ceiling and wall, through others to the center
of the miniature furnaces placed in the four walls
of the room two feet from the floor, and still through
others to the small glaciers which so beautifully adorn
the walls twenty-four inches from the ceiling. In the
center of each small representation of the face of the
sun is a hollow glass button filled with another form of
liquid obtained from the sunâs rays, which we call âLight
Fluid.â When light is required in a certain part or in
the entire part in any room or hall in this building, a
small lever is moved by pressing a button, conveniently
situated for that purpose, which brings in contact the
principal liquid and the âLightâ liquid, with the result
you now see; the soft, mellow light spreading over the

64
room, increasing in intensity until the amount of light
required is had.

âHeat is likewise produced by causing the principal
fluid to unite with a liquid confined in the miniature
furnace, which we term âHeat Fluid.ââ

Guillermo Gonzales touched a button, and the room
gradually became very warm; so warm, in fact, that
the audience was uncomfortable; murmurs of complaints
were heard on every side. All the dainty fans
carried by the ladies for effect only, were immediately
put into use.

The Governor fanned himself vigorously and wiped
perspiration from his brow.

âThe efficiency of âHeat Fluidâ is well demonstrated,
my friend,â said the Governor, addressing the scientist.
âMake us cool; this heat is overpowering.â

The intense heat gradually gave way to the cool
breeze, which the Governor explained, âwas caused by
the uniting of the principal fluid with the fluid called
âCold Fluid,â concealed within the small glaciers.â

Every one in the room turned his face toward the
ceiling to see the representation of glaciers, and was
greatly surprised to feel the cold air falling on his face
as the heat ascended.

Cheer after cheer went up from the much pleased
assembly. Their delight knew no bounds. It was the
first knowledge they had of the means by which this
magnificent auditorium was lighted, heated and made
cool.

âThe strange influence the liquid had at the certain
stage before mentioned,â continued the Governor, âupon

65
us working to bring about desired results with it in
other conditions, gave rise to serious study of self while
under its influence, and further experiments in making
the same fluid stronger. On inhaling some of the
stronger fluid we lapsed into a cataleptic state, and on
our return to consciousness each astonished the other by
relating wonderful and strange experiences. And
strange to say, each of us had received the same remembrances
of strange experiences which happened right in
this city one hundred and fifty years ago. When we
knew from our own personal knowledge that the liquid
was perfectly harmless and capable of bringing about
such wonderful results, we were determined to experiment
upon others, and, if possible, find out if others had
lived at the same time. And if the fluid caused those
upon whom it was tested to recall one certain incident
which we remembered to have occurred in the year 1898.
in this city. This new fluid or liquid we call âMemory
Fluid,â and upon others it likewise worked marvels.
They too recalled at once the same incident which we
had recorded in our register. And now our great test
case is about to be closed. The âPlunger from Kansasâ
has positively been located. All the evidence of many
persons now living who knew him in this town one hundred
and fifty years ago, is about collected. He remembers
himself. Retribution is overtaking him.
See! this is his picture. Through a similar process to
the one used in making this auditorium light, another
has been used in producing from memoryâs picture-gallery
of the past, the picture you see of âThe Plunger
from Kansas,â now before you.â

66
For an instant a hushed silence fell upon the large
audience. Then as if by unanimous vote they at once
cried out in the most tumultuous cheers.

The cries of: âDown with him, I remember him;
he robbed my father in another life.â âPunish him.â
âCatch him.â âHang him.â âPut him in prison.â
âMake him repent.â âSee that his just due is meted
out to him.â âYes, for he escaped in the other life,â
rang out.

One of the orthodox ministersâRev. J. T. Noteâthere
are still a few who hang on to their creeds with
the same tenacity that Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir
and his few followers do to the ancient customs
and religion of their long-lost and beloved Republic of
Mexico; arose and cried: âThe wrath of God be upon
such unholy teachings. Oh, God, spare our great
nation, about to be plunged into an abyss of darkness
and despair.â

When Father Hernandez, the best known priest in the
city, cried: âJesus and Mary protect us from evil,â
Marriet Motuble arose from her conspicuous position in
the box she occupied with the President, and cried:
âCarry that scorpion, the Rev. J. T. Note, out. I know
him of old. He tried to convert the âPlungerâ to his
faith, to get some of his ill-gotten gains, no doubt. He
was a missionary then, practicing his arts of conversion
in Chihuahua. It is upon him the wrath of the gods
should fall. And that priest, Father Hernandez,â she
continued, as her body swayed back and forth, convulsed
with laughter. âThat priest, that priest, he was a
voluptuous lout. Oh, the hangers-on he had. Clangity

67
clang, clang, clang, every fifteen minutes went the bells
in the towers of his ancient church, to call the peons to
prayerâto get their
centavos
. Oh, you viper, you
scorpion, get out of here!â

âHush!ââcame out the clear, distinct voice of the
Governor.

Marriet Motuble sank quietly into her seat, at the
sound of his voice.

Julio Murillo stepped on the stage, and in a quiet,
reassuring voice said: âEternal Truth, the Sublime
Law of Right, will be asserted. The voice of my
mother, SeÃ±ora Suzzan Carriles, of Colima, cries out
for a resurrection. Through her desire for a new life,
for a knowledge of truth, yonder priest, whom I pity
from the bottom of my soul, will see the folly of his
ways, and will desire also to live the life of spiritual
purity.â

A pitiful cry, âOh, Joseph, oh, Mary, spare me, spare
me!â rang out, as the priest fell forward.

He was carried out amidst the cries: âImpostor,â
âGive him âMemory Fluid,ââ on one side, and âOur kind
priest is persecuted,â on another. âSpare him, ye
blessed Virgin Mary!â

âJesus y Maria, Jesus y Maria!â cried Don Francisco
R. Cantu y Falomir. âThis is the beginning of
the war about to be waged. The sanctified Catholic
Church will win. These blasphemous scientific impostors
will meet their just reward. I knew it would come
through the means of the fake âMemory Fluid.â It is
necessary for a vast amount of evil to be thrust upon
man at one moment before he is brought to his senses;
before a much needed revolution takes place.â

68
The keynote to his thoughts was struck when he said
the word ârevolution,â as it acted like wild-fire upon the
wrought-up assembly.

Progressive women and men arose, and their cries of:
âDown with the revolutionists! Down with the
progeny who opposed the noble Diaz!â

âDrag the scorpion out and cut his wind off,â cried
Marriet Motuble.

The President of the United States arose, and with
hands outstretched toward the Governor, sent forth a
silent appeal. This was the first exhibition of fear
noticed during the entire commotion.

The Governor understood the mute appeal of the head
of the nation, arose, and with a proud toss of his
handsome head, spoke in a clear, high voice: âCaptain,
let the soldiers enter, and take the disturbers of peace
away!â

No one up to this time had noticed that the doorways
and vestibules leading into the auditorium were
thronged with the city police force and the state militia.
The wise Governor had, through the assistance of
his able coworkers, Guillermo Gonzales and Julio
Murillo, arranged thus for the protection of those
present at the first outbreak of the evening.

The Captain whom he addressed had been in the audience,
within close distance of the Governor, for some
time, and only waited for the sign from him to quell
the disturbers.

At the same moment the auditorium was filled with
officers of law, the boxes occupied by the President and
family and other visitors were completely surrounded
with soldiers armed to the teeth.

69
Friends of the priest, Father Hernandez, had carried
him out the moment he fell in a faint; others, in sympathy
with Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, ushered
him out quickly, so the police restored quiet by their
presence.

Some nervous sensationalist was so bold as to cry out:
âGod save the President! This occasion is for the purpose
of getting him here to murder him. It is the old
story repeated. Abraham Lincoln was shot by a
traitor while in a theatre two hundred and fifty years
ago. We must protect our President with our lives.â

The person who gave vent to this cry was at once
put under arrest, and taken by force out of the theatre.

Quiet was once more restored and by a few words
from the Governor, the people were assured of protection
and that the banquet would take place.

70

CHAPTER VI.

MRS. GRANGE AND THE PRESIDENT.

It was the powerful influence of the minds of the
Governor and his able coworkers upon the people
which produced quiet.

Even the aggressive SeÃ±orita Marriet Motuble leaned
back in her chair with a dreamy faraway look on her
face.

The Governor had spoken longer than he intended,
and on looking at the timepiece, which occupied a conspicuous
place in the room, he was greatly surprised to
find the hour of midnight.

The President of the United States dismissed the
assembly with a few complimentary and brilliant remarks,
but strictly avoided making any allusion to the
affair just ended, or rather, I would better say, which
had just been quieted; for the scene had not ended,
it was only the beginning of a fearful struggle, which
would not end in a day, a week, a month, a year.

The committee having the arrangements for the banquet
in hand, passed into the hall, some leading the way
escorting the guests who came in first with invitations,
others with those who came in last.

Everybody felt greatly impressed with some impending
trouble, yet each endeavored to hide his anxiety
behind a smile.

71
The subjects upon whom the scientists had been experimenting
and from whom such great results had
been obtained, were special objects of interest at the banquet.
J. Ecarg looked greatly embarrassed; most of
the evening, however, at times he seemed to lapse into a
semi-conscious state. He only appeared to be at ease
and contented when talking to Marriet Motuble.

Several times during the evening he was heard to
laugh out merrily at some jest made by her.

Mr. Niksab was often the center of a large crowd,
whom he entertained with stories of the effect of
âMemory Fluidâ upon himself and others.

Occasionally he stole a glance from his eager listeners
in the direction of Marriet Motuble and his friend
John Ecarg. He felt a deep interest in him, and in a
measure responsible for the result of his present condition,
of his awakening.

There were so many people present that it was impossible
for each to meet the other during the evening.
All the most prominent citizens were presented to the
President and other invited guests from abroad. The
Governor tried to have a few pleasant words with all
visitors and newcomers to the city.

Toasts were proposed in which response was made in
the most brilliant and appropriate manner.

The toast, âOur Beautiful Women,â was proposed by
a gallant visitor, and the Governor was called upon to
reply.

With his usual gallantry he responded. Crowds of
beautiful women, many of whom belonged to the fast
set before mentioned, drew near.

72
One in particular made herself conspicuous by getting
very near the President and clapping her hands at
everything the Governor saidâwords complimentary to
women.

She was the wife of a Scotchman who, having failed
as an opera singer, was obliged to try his hand in other
lines,ârailroading and commercial fields. Having
secured, at a small salary, a place in a railroad office,
with the high title of âAssistant Freight Agent,â he
was forced to depend upon his form, his pretty face
and his voice, (which by way of apology, he always explained,
he hoped to recover), as well as his wifeâs winning
ways, and her ability to â
act
â in amateur dramatic
performances, for their social position.

Mrs. Grange made the most of her winning ways.
She flirted, and smiled, and danced and drank wine
with every man of position and wealth, who paid her
the slightest attention, and hinted only at such favors.

In the little game she played she very often came out
winner; that is, winner in a way. She received for
herself and husband an invitation for the next swell
function, and often the present of a new gown for the
occasion from her latest conquest, who also assured her
that he would use his personal influence with the president
of the railroad where her husband was employed,
to have him retained in his position. Quite frequently
these admirers of hers hinted that through their influence
there was likely to be a raise in his salary. The
raise, however, never came, yet the promise of it did
them good; it was something to which they could look
forward.

73
It was probably the hope of securing such a promise,
by the aid of some of the famous men present, that
Mrs. Grange disported herself so bewitchingly before
them.

To herself her charms as reflected from her mirror,
seemed irresistible, and it was a source of constant wonder
to her why any man failed to become her victim.

In her case the formality of an introduction was never
necessary. Yet she realized the prestige a formal introduction
gave her, and by intriguing with those who
did not know her arts, she very often was presented to
people of influence by their own friends. She affected
a retiring manner, and made her blushes to order.

Those to whom she was first introduced thought her
a combination of beauty, modesty and purity, and her
entertaining powers superior to anyone whom they
had seen. Her great bashfulness enhanced her ability
to entertain, they thought. The President of the
United States certainly seemed to think so, from the
way his face shone with pleasure as he gazed into her
half upturned face, full of blushes that came and went
as she talked.

The Governor had just concluded his response to the
toast, âBeautiful Women,â which was eliciting a storm
of applause. Guests were collected in twos and threes,
discussing the brilliancy of his remarks.

Some of the gentlemen were discussing which one of
the many beautiful women present would be thought the
most beautiful, by the greatest number of persons at
the banquet, if a vote were taken.

The President wished the woman into whose face he

74
gazed with evident admiration might be chosen as the
queen of beauty, and in a voice only meant for her ears
told her so.

But Marriet Motuble stood close by and had been
an eye-witness to the little, quiet game of flirtation,
which they did not dream had attracted the attention of
anyone.

She also heard the pretty compliments paid Mrs.
Grange by the President, and at the time most inopportune
for them, she stepped closer to them, and in a tone
which carried much satire, said: âA pretty compliment
indeed, Mrs. Grange; but pardon me, please, it was not
meant for my ears.â

The President was evidently annoyed, although he
tried hard to hide his real feeling, and said: âWe, too,
Miss Motuble, were discussing the Governorâs able
speech. He paid beautiful tributes of appreciation to
the many charming women present.â

âYour Honor, that is quite true; he is a great
Chesterfield. He knows how to be gracious to the
ladies,
homely
ones as well as beautiful, timid ones,â
said Mrs. Grange, as she turned her face full of earnest
pleading up to his.

The President did not reply in words, but the look
he gave her, as he bent his head until it nearly touched
hers, was proof enough to Marriet Motuble that he was
afraid to trust his voice. His chest heaved with tender
emotions inspired by Mrs. Grange, and one word would
betray his real feeling.

On neither of those two did the stirring events just
passed, seem to have left any impression.

75
Marriet Motuble well knew the mental calibre of the
woman, and was not in the least astonished to find Mrs.
Grange in the affected state she always assumed when
with men.

âBut the President! the President!â exclaimed Marriet
Motuble, mentally. âI cannot understand how the
leader of our great nation can carry on a sentimental
conversation with a brainless beauty (?) when the great
city of Chihuahua is in such a state of excitement.
There is no telling where the events just transpired will
end. I for one am sorry this terrible calm is taking
place. It seems to me a time of preparation for a
greater shock. He is a great actor if he is mentally
disturbed and can so completely disguise his true feelings.
I will test him.âââSay, President,â she cried, as
she whirled her huge frame in front of the two, and interrupted
the low conversation, âGovernor Lehumada is
a fine actor, is he not?â

âIn what way, pray, Miss Motuble?â

âIn the disguise of his real feelings.â

âHe is a heroic actor,â said Mrs. Grange.

âHe is, indeed,â curtly replied Miss Motuble, addressing
herself to Mrs. Grange; then in a complete change
of voice, said, speaking to the President, with her
back half turned to Mrs. Grange, âI mean, your Honor,
that the noble man yonder is in a high fever of excitement
caused by the disturbance in the auditoriumâfor
he realizes that it was just the beginning of a long conflict,
the end of which cannot be seen by mortal eyes.
Yet the noble man is able to conceal his feeling out of
his great love for his people, and his desire to have the
banquet end successfully.â

76
âYou know your people here better than I, Miss
Motuble, this being your home; and pray, do you anticipate
any further trouble?â

âI know the city but little better than yourself, your
Honor, except possibly in the way of remembrance.â

Mrs. Grange, arousing herself from her passive state,
said in a voice loud and cutting: âA
subject
of that
fluid also!â

Ignoring her altogether, Marriet Motuble continued:

âWith your Honorâs permission, I do remember many
persons present as having lived in lives gone by. Some
here to-night lived in this city one hundred and fifty
years ago.â

âMay I ask whom?â

âMost truly.â

âNot I, I hope,â again ventured Mrs. Grange.

âThe child,â continued Marriet Motuble, âlived
then.â

âWhat child?â inquired the President.

âAh, âtis true, you do not know. What a pity! The
beautiful little girl who sat by the Governor during his
lecture. Catalina Martinet. Dear child!â

âCan it be possible!â exclaimed the President.

âQuite true, your Honor. She
remembers
. She
died at the age of eighteen of a broken heart.â

âHow sad,â remarked Mrs. Grange, persisting in trying
to join in the conversation.

âWas her death the result of a disappointed love?â
asked the President.

âOn the other hand,â replied Miss Motuble, âquite
the contrary. Her heart, poor child, was broken when

77
she learned of the cloud under which she was bornâthat
she was an outcastâa waif. She died in my arms.â

âImpossible,â exclaimed Mrs. Grange.

âNot at all,â quietly replied the President. âOne is
as likely as the other, while neither is
impossible
.â

Marriet Motuble continued as though there had been
no interruption: âShe died in my arms. I buried her
at my own expense in a tomb befitting a queen. And
truly she was a queen. The deed to the ground I built
her tomb on I have in my safe amongst my legal
documents. Every word is legible. I could not bear to
think that her precious body, possibly before the flesh
had decomposed, would be thrown out of the grave to
make way for a new corpse, as was the cruel custom in
Mexico then. Her tomb is in a state of perfect preservation
yet. I hope soon to finish this cycle and have
made arrangements to have the destructible part of me,
or that part of me recognized by those not initiated,
laid away there.â

âHow interesting. Quite uncanny, though!â ventured
Mrs. Grange, as she peered around her as though
expecting to see a ghost. She evidently saw something;
for her face turned very white and she trembled with
fright as she sank into a chair.

The President saw but paid no attention to her. He
was interested in Marriet Motuble. The story she was
telling was a revelation to him.

She, too, saw that something unusual had happened to
Mrs. Grange, but paid no attention to her, and continued:
âI know the childâs genealogies, of both her
past and present existence. She, like myself, is here for

78
a purpose. There are many who have congregated here
for the same purpose. While the prime cause for the
great meeting here was the same, many great results will
be obtained other than the one hoped for in the beginning.â

âCan it be that you are here also to aid the scientists
in getting proof to bring the âPlunger from Kansasâ
to justice?â asked the President, with much surprise,
and showing great interest.

âIndirectly only. I am here for the direct purpose
of finding one whom I loved in that same timeâa
young, beautiful woman, whose poverty was the result
of the doings of the âPlunger from Kansas,â and who
suffered much loss financially and great abuse from the
slanderous tongues of jealous Americans living in Chihuahua.â

âAre you certain that the lady of whom you speak is
living now?â asked the President.

âIt must be true. I feel her presence, yet I have
not been able to find her. She will come. She will
come. A young woman, beautiful and talented. Must
I wait much longer? Iâââ

Her last remark was cut short by some one calling, in
a low, sweet tone: âSeÃ±orita Motuble. Ah, here you
are. I have been looking for you for two hours. I am
Catalina Martinet. It was my tomb you had built
long, long ago. You
remember
now, donât you?â

She caught the beautiful child in her arms, kissed
her in her passionate way, and cried: âYes, dearie, I
know you. You are happy now, are you not?â

âOh, yes!â exclaimed the child. âSince I know that
justice comes to all, I am happy. And you?â

79
âDearie, I too am happy in a way. But do not worry
about me. Let us talk about other things. Catalina,
this gentleman, Mr. Mortingo, is President of the
United States.â

âYour Honor, it is with much pleasure I meet you
again,â Catalina smilingly replied. âI remember you
quite well. I met you when you were here before.â

âImpossible!â exclaimed the President. âDear
child, I was never in this city before. This is my first
visit.â

âToo bad, he does not remember,â addressing Miss
Motuble. Then to the President she said: âIn your

other
life. I will call the Governor to give you some
âMemory Fluidâ;â and with a wave of her hand, before
they could realize what she was going to do, she was
gone.

The Presidentâs conversation with Miss Motuble had
not been carried on without many interruptions.
While he realized that he was the most prominent person
present, and that he owed part of his time to all,
yet so intensely interested was he in the aggressive Miss
Motuble, that he was determined at any cost to hear her
story through.

The remark of Catalina Martinet was heard by many
near by, some of whom were intimate friends of the
President. They now stepped forward and began to
banter him about taking âMemory Fluid.â

The President took their jests in good part, at the
same time avowing his intention of experimenting with
the wonderful fluid.

While those around the President listened with much

80
merriment to him, as he related the little incident with
the child, Marriet Motuble turned her attention to the
beautiful, retiring Mrs. Grange, who, so far as the
President was concerned, had ceased to exist.

âThis,â she exclaimed, as she held up Mrs. Grangeâs
lifeless head, âis an example of coming memory.â

The President looked at her for a moment in mute
astonishment.

âOh, your Honor, it is true.â

âBut the fluid, Miss Motuble. Who gave her
âMemory Fluidâ?â asked the Spanish Consul, who had
been an eager listener only for the present time.

âI, your most humble servant. I did.â

âBut when and how?â asked the Presidentâs daughter,
who just came up.

âPossibly I would better not say,â Miss Motuble
answered.

âOh, do; oh, do!â came from all sides.

âYes, let us hear, Miss Motuble, how you came to be
such an expert in handling our fluid,â quietly asked the
Governor, who came up leading Catalina Martinet.

Marriet Motuble dropped the lifeless head of Mrs.
Grange on the back of the chair where she sat, and in a
pleading voice said: âDear Governor, I must first have
your promise that you will forgive me for making tests
of your fluid without the consent of yourself or the
great scientist, Guillermo Gonzales. Donât tell me, I
pray, that I have taken too much liberty with your great
discovery.â

âOn the other hand, Miss Motuble, I am personally
delighted that you are thus experimenting, and I feel

81
confident my able coworkers too, will be grateful to you
for taking so much interest in our âMemory Fluid.ââ

âBravo! Say, gentlemen and ladies, that is the kind
of stuff to make governors out of, and scientists, too.
Well, so long as the culprit is not to be punished, I will
confess. While âMemory Fluidâ has no odor, a simple
inhalation of it will cause a cataleptic state, such as the
state in which we now find the beautiful (?) Mrs.
Grange. When she comes out of this state, in which she
has been about five minutes, she will begin to
remember
.
And if I am not mistaken, she will begin to regret the
life of deceit she has been leading.â

Catalina cried: âSeÃ±orita Motuble, she will remember
and yet will be punished for her ill treatment of me
in that unhappy life of mine, long, long ago.â

Everyone stood around in breathless surprise.

Marriet Motuble kissed the child Catalina, standing
by her side and holding in tight clasp the Governorâs
hand, and said: âDearie, she will remember, and I
hope that her first regret will be of her ill treatment of
you. See! she moves.â

The crowd stood back in breathless expectation.

Secretly the Governor and the other two scientists
rejoiced at what was now taking place. It was the
realization of a long-looked-for opportunity. A public
exhibition of the effect of âMemory Fluidâ and the
proof of its harmlessness.

âShe moves again,â came in subdued tones from some
one standing by. Much the same effect seemed to be
produced upon those witnessing the scene, as would
take place if Mrs. Grange had been dead and they were
waiting to see her return to life.

82
âShe moves again,â said the Spanish consul, stepping
closer. âThe fluid has caused no change in her complexion,
and her circulation is very little wrong,â he
concluded, as he let her wrist drop, but gazed with
evident admiration into her face.

He tarried a little too long. She opened her eyes,
and finding a strange face so close to hers, exclaimed at
the same moment as she threw out her hands and pushed
him away:

âThe impudence of you, you ill-bred scamp!â

âBut, madam,â said the President, âit was his anxiety
for your return to consciousness that caused the consul
to be peering into your face.â

âYour explanation is satisfactory, President. But
are you not mistaken about me having been unconscious?â

âIn a certain sense, madam, you were,â replied the
Governor.

âBut, you
remember
, do you not, Mrs. Grange,âAunty
Inez?â asked the child.

Mrs. Grange sprang to her feet. âHave I been living
a dream all of my past life, or am I now dreaming?â

âNeither, dear madam,â replied the great scientist,
Guillermo Gonzales; âneither, madam. You are simply
confused with the remembrances of two lives.â

In an abstracted manner she took the hands of Catalina
Martinet in her own, and gazing intently into her
face for a moment, said: âIt is the same child. The
other life is plain to me now. Am I to be punished?
I did ill-treat her then; I did. But spare me, spare
me!â She pleadingly called out to some invisible person.

83
Turning her face away from the child, she looked
straight into the laughing face of Marriet Motuble, who
said:

âI thought it would come, Sister Grange. In fact, I
knew it would come.â

âSuch torture,â she cried, turning from first one to
the other, âsuch torture; save me, save me!â

âWe cannot do that, dear madam; we have no such
power. You need have no fear. It is the awakening
of your soul, and only good can be the final result,â said
the Governor.

âYour words only harrass me. There are so many here
to chide me for my unjust treatment of the child there,
in that other life.â Spying a new face close by, she
fairly screamed: âWhat, you here?â

Everybody turned to see who it was that caused the
half crazy womanâcrazy with guiltâto cry out so,
when a queenly young woman stepped forward and said:

âI certainly am sorry my presence has created such
an uproar. Ladies and gentlemen, I now apologize.â

âHave you ever met the woman?â asked the President.

âNot in this life, your Honor.â

âShe remembers me, though,â said Mrs. Grange,
âand I her.â

âIf that be true,â said the Governor, âpresent me,
dear madam. I have not the honor of her acquaintance.â

As Mrs. Grange sank into a chair she put her hands
over her eyes, as if to hide from view of every one, and
said: âYour Honor, the lady was Helen Hinckley, in

84
that time long past,â then sank into her former state of
unconsciousness.

Helen Hinckley, with a pleasing smile, advanced with
outstretched hands to the Governor, and in her charming
voice, said: âBy which name I have the pleasure to
present myself to your Honor now.â

The Governor took her two beautiful hands into his
own, and as he looked into her open countenance, and
beautiful eyes, he realized that at last he had met his
fate.

85

CHAPTER VII.

THE PRESIDENT SURPRISED.

It was the intention of the Presidential party to spend
one day and night in Chihuahua, and to leave the following
morning before eleven oâclock for Saltillo, where
they would spend a few days visiting her large and
famous educational institutions, of which the United
States is justly proud.

But instead of carrying out the plan for the tour,
he sent a message, saying his visit would be delayed, to
the president of the most renowned of the ten schools,
which had made the beautiful city of Saltillo, away up
in the Sierra Madre mountains, five thousand feet above
the sea level, the envy of all pedagogues all over the
East and North. The hub of learning was no longer
said to be in the old, puritanical town of Boston,
as was credited to it a hundred and fifty years ago.

A strange shifting of scenes had taken place, not only
in the fall of Boston from its educational pedestal, but
in the shifting of the axis of the earth, changing the
positions of the poles, and creating in different parts
of the world a different climate from what had been in
years gone by, as well as different animal, vegetable life
and mineral deposits.

The great school, âFor Hidden Thought,â of which

86
Francisco de UrdiÃ±ola was president, was the institution
of greatest note in Saltillo, and the only one of its kind
in America. It was to the president of this University
that the President of the United States sent a message,
saying that the date of his arrival in Saltillo would be
delayed.

President Mortingo had a short conversation with
Governor Lehumada at the close of the banquet the previous
evening, in which the President declared his intentions
of becoming a âsubjectâ the following day, to see
if he could fathom the mysteries of the evening.

He made an appointment also to meet the child,
Catalina Martinet, at the Governorâs home, at nine
oâclock, after which meeting he would go to the studio
of the scientist, Guillermo Gonzales.

As the President sped through the beautiful streets
of Chihuahua, from the Mexican Annex, to the palatial
home of Governor Lehumada, his thoughts travelled
with surprising rapidity from one occurrence to another
of the last evening.

He had never taken life seriously, and notwithstanding
the fact that he had thought last night that the
âMemory Fluidâ possessed an uncanny element, he
laughed to himself now, and declared the whole scene
was an uproarious comedietta, in which he was about to
present himself before the public as the buffoon. He
chuckled at the thought of the prominence from a new
point of view it would bring him, by submitting himself
as a subject for the great scientists to further experiment
upon. He had always been ambitious to shine
before the public. He was chosen President of the

87
United States, not because he was a great politician, or
a man who had distinguished himself in the service of
his country; quite the contrary. He came by chance,
as it were, into the presidential chair. He had great
wealth and good nature combined, and he allowed himself
to be
used
by his friends. It was a great plum he
had secured by being good-natured, and his face constantly
glowed with evident satisfaction.

The two great political parties had ceased to agree
amongst themselves, and on the eve of the great national
election a black horse had been run into the ring
and won the race.

Each party was glad the other had not won the race,
and each felt assured that the
black horse
would not
prove a serious stumbling-block to the many projects
each party hoped to accomplish by the election of a man
from its own party.

Far beyond the most sanguine expectations of the
people, he had proved a benefactor. His good-nature,
coupled with his desire to do no one a wrong personally,
and produce all the good possible to the nation, was
a balm to the hurt minds of the two defeated parties.

All of these things Mr. Mortingo knew very well, and
reflected over them now with much satisfaction. It
was the pleasant things of life he was seeking, and he
had his full share. He accepted all favors shown him,
even those from persons whom he knew to be enemies,
and whose object in showing him courtesies was for the
sole purpose of gaining some political favor or social
prestige. He smiled as he stepped from the carriage,
and thought of the sensation the step he was about to
take would make upon the people.

88
Governor Lehumada received him in his wonderful
drawing-room, with the respect due his position, and at
once presented the child, Catalina Martinet. She curtesied
prettily and gave her tiny hand to the President.
He kissed her bright face and asked her to sit on the
chair placed by the one he was to occupy, and to excuse
him one moment. Then he drew his arm through the
arm of the Governor, and as they walked a few steps
away, said: âYour Honor, does the child know I have
come to see her?â

âShe does not, sir; at least she does not know by being
told. I have, however, a feeling that she divined
you were coming, and that you would talk to her upon
the subject of a past existence,â replied the Governor.

âI am sorry she suspects the object of my visit. I
am afraid the mere fact of it will make me incredulous
of her statements,â said the President. âHowever,â he
continued, âwhat led you into the belief you have just
stated?â

The Governor walked a few steps further away with
his friend, and in a lower tone said: âThe child has
taken a great fancy to me, and notwithstanding the fact
that I tried to persuade her not to call me âpapa,â she
persists in so doing. She is a child a man in any position
in life would be proud to claim as his own, yet
being a bachelor I feel a certain timidity in being
addressed as âpapa.â Now to answer your question,
what led me to suspect that she knew you would call this
morning and the object of your call as well? While I
was taking my breakfast she ran into the room, and
after throwing her arms around my neck and kissing me

89
fondly, she exclaimed: âDear papa, dear papa, the
great man will be here presently; I will run to the house
I used to have for a home, and get the philopena he gave
me in the other life. I promised to keep it always, and
I want to show him I still have it. Then he will remember.â

ââIs the President coming to see
you
, Catalina?â I
asked.

ââDear papa, you
know
he is; may I go for the philopena
now?â

ââNo, child,â I replied, ânot now; but if our President
comes and wishes to see the philopena, you may go for
it.ââ

âOh, thank you; thank you. Do let the sweet child
go at once,â said the President.

âDo you want me?â cried Catalina, starting from her
seat toward them, as they turned around to call her.

âWe certainly do,â replied the Governor, as he caught
the happy child in his arms. âWe certainly do, do we
not, President?â

The President looked at the two for a moment in
mute astonishment, then replied: âWe do want you,
dear, but how strange!â

âI wear the philopena, President; you remember it,
donât you?â

The Governor looked at her questioningly, to which
she replied:

âI slipped away, papa, just for a moment, to get it.
I knew the President would want to see it;â with that
she handed him a curious coin suspended from a small
silver chain.

90
âWhat is it?â asked both men, as they examined it
curiously.

Catalina looked serious as she replied: âHe does not
remember. It is speiss, a five-cent piece, you gave me
for winning the second game of checkers I played after
you taught me how. You said you would never see it
again, for I would give it to the priest some day when
I went to confess; playing checkers for a philopena.â

âThis is an old coin,â said the President; âit is dated
1898.â

âAnd the day we played the game is cut on it also,â
said Catalina.

âA date is on itâDecember the seventh. But who
put it there?â asked the President.

âWhy, you cut the letters on it, your Honor,â Catalina
replied, âwith a little pearl-handled knife. I have it
also. You used many big words to me then, but I remember
them all very well. Do you remember what
you said the priest might do with the knife, if I were
not a good girl?â

âYou forget, child, the President does not remember;
but tell us about the knife,â said the Governor.

âDo; I am all curiosity,â said the President.

âIt is a big word you used,â said Catalina, âand if
you do not remember, I will have to tell you what it
means. You said if I were not a good girl, the priest
would perform phlebotomy upon me.â

âWe do not knowâexplain, child,â said Governor
Lehumada.

âHe meant, the priest would open a blood-vessel, and
all of my blood would run out,â laughed the child.

91
âBut were you so bad that I had to be constantly
reminding you of the fact?â asked President Mortingo.

âI was not bad then,â said the child; âit was only
after I knew of the disgrace of my birth that I got to
be disagreeable and bad. It is now time for you to take
âMemory Fluidâ from SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales. I
will tell you about other things when you remember.
I am now going to meet Helen Hinckley in the Alameda.â
She shook hands with the President; kissed
the Governor fondly, and with the air of a queen swept
from the room.

âHow strange,â said the President; âa child and a
queen in one;â while Governor Lehumada, with a
smile on his face, murmured: âHelen Hinckley, my
long-lost love, found at last, at last. Would that I, too,
could hasten to her.â

The President heard the Governorâs confession of
love, but gave no sign that his secret had been betrayed.
âWith your permission, Governor, I will go at once to
the studio of SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales. I wish to become
a subject immediately, the child has enthused me
very much; in fact, I never believed it possible for any
one to arouse my curiosity to such an extent.â

At that moment SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales was
shown into the drawing-room, and as he greeted the
President, said: âTo keep the matter of you becoming
a subject very quiet, I came at a suggestion just received
from the Governor, to administer the âFluidâ
here.â

âHow considerate,â said President Mortingo. âI
really felt a little delicacy in going to your laboratory.

92
Let the experiments begin now, I pray you. I really
am getting nervous over it. I hope I will not be
affected, on my return to a conscious condition, as was
poor Mrs. Grange last night.â

âHave no fears, President; it is not likely you committed
any evil deeds in a life gone by for which you
will now suffer remorse. Your presence in this life is
no doubt due to the fact that you desired knowledgeâdesired
to reach the highest plane, without any waste
of years.â

âThat is most likely,â said the Governor. âFriend
Gonzales is quite right. To avoid any further delay,
please follow me into my private study. As soon as
the âFluidâ is administered, I will leave you with SeÃ±ors
Gonzales and Murillo, until the period we desire is
reached. Then I will return. A matter of great importance
has come up recently, within the last hours,
which I wish to attend to personally.â

âYou are quite excusable, Governor, quite excusable,â
replied the good-natured President. He thought he
knew what the âimportant businessâ was that had recently
come up, to which the Governor wished to give
his personal attention.

His vein of humor produced a hearty laugh from the
three men besides himself in the room when he received
the small glass containing âMemory Fluidâ in his hand,
and holding it aloft, said: âI drink, oh, thou Great
Revealer, to the health of all my present enemies and
friends, to all friends and enemies I had in those lives
I am supposed to have lived ages and ages ago! Oh,
thou Muse, bring me Memory, that I may know myself

93
now as I was then! Was I then a mule driver, or a
bootblack in America; a
mozo
in Mexico, or an Emperor
of Germany?â

He sipped the tasteless liquid and lapsed into silence.

Guillermo Gonzales nodded to Governor Lehumada
significantly, and the Governor at once made his exit.

He hurried to his dressing-room and began to make
some changes in his toilet. Satisfied with himself from
the reflection he saw in the mirror, he rang for the
coach, and while waiting for it to be announced, exclaimed:
âThe greatest moment in my life has come!
Dearest Helen, thou wilt be mine! You must! You
shall! I have lived sadly through one existence searching
for you, and several times during this life I have
been on the very verge of despair because I could not
find youâand I would have despaired, were it not that
even in a past life I knew a power would be given to me
to discover an element from Nature which would be instrumental
in bringing you to my arms. The insincerity
of humanity has, since the beginning of time, caused
more heartaches and trouble than any other one thing.
To the great Creator I certainly give thanks for the germ
of sincerity he sowed in my breast, and the proper nutrition
he placed there to make it grow. There, Juan
says my coach is ready; I must hasten to meet my
love.â

With a sweeping glance at his mirror, he hastened out
of the room and down the long stairs. On nearing the
drawing-room door, Juan said: âYour Honor, a seÃ±orita
awaits you in the drawing-room.â

The Governor took the large white card from the

94
silver tray his man held out to him, and with a look of
dismay upon his face, read aloud: âMiss Marriet
Motuble.â âA very great disappointment, dear, dear
Helen. When will I ever have another opportunity to
see you? It is unjust for me to feel this way. I will
enter at once, and not keep the seÃ±orita waiting. Juan,
tell Miss Motuble I will be in at once.â

While Juan entered the drawing-room Governor
Lehumada removed his gloves and hat, and was glad to
have the opportunity to collect himself, and when Juan
reappeared, he asked: âDo you see any signs of displeasure
on my face?â

âNo, your Honor; your face is as serene as the morning
sky.â

âThanks, Juan. It is another victory. Take my
hat and gloves, and tell the coachman to go to the Alameda.
The child, Catalina Martinet, is there; should
she desire to use the conveyance, take her wherever she
wishes to go. Tell him to say to her that I had started
for her, and at the last moment was disappointed at being
unable to go,â whispered Governor Lehumada, into
the ears of his trusty man. Was all the long message
sent to the child meant only to be delivered for her
ears?

âCertainly not,â mentally remarked Juan. âI kind
of have a suspicion that there is something more than
âMemory Fluidâ bothering the Governor for several
days; but then I am only Juan, and not a great
Governor, author and scientist. I will experiment one
day, if I can, and help to solve the great problem of
life. I wonder if it is probable that the Governor has

95
fallen in love with some beautiful young woman? I
will find out, if it can be done. I will from this
moment camp on his tracks, and when I have a chance
I will
slip
some âMemory Fluid,â for I has a notion in
my old head that I lived before. I has a notion that
Mr. Niksab and J. Ecarg, were known to me somewhere,
long, long ago.â He smiled to himself as he went out
to give the Governorâs orders.

On his return to the house he stationed himself conveniently
near the drawing-room door, so close that
every word uttered by the aggressive seÃ±orita was heard
by him.

When Governor Lehumada entered the drawing-room,
he felt very much like a schoolboy who had been
punished for not wanting to enter the parlor and be
pleasant to callers. He was ashamed of himself, and
tried to make amends for his actions by being more
gracious than was necessary.

Miss Motuble mistook his gallantry and great hospitality
for demonstrations of love, and after greeting the
object of her affections, she sank into a chair close by,
much overcome with emotions. She believed she had
won a conquest. She was unable for some minutes to
speak. Her face became red and white by turns, her
breast heaved with great convulsions, while her hand
trembled so violently that she had no power over the fan
she was trying to move.

The Governor saw the condition she was in, and from
the bottom of his heart he pitied her. The object of

his
heartâs desire affected him much the same way when
he saw her. âBut I need no sympathy,â he argued to

96
himself, âfor my love is reciprocated; my Helen is
mine, and I am hers. It is the law of the inevitable.
It could not be otherwise. Miss Motuble,â he continued,
âis there any way in which I can serve you this
morning? Can it be you are not well?â

The tone in which he addressed her, more than what
he said, was the tonic Miss Motuble needed. She failed
to hide her irritation, and sitting erect in a moment, her
face, crimson with rage, said: âHow can you serve me
this morning? I need no assistance whatever, sir. I
am neither in need of money or advice; on the other
hand, I came to proffer certain valuable information I
have recently obtained. I ferreted it out. I admit it
cost me considerable time and expense, but I learned of
the scorpionâs movements, as well as his entire pedigree.
I have it all hereâthe written statements of many who
knew him. He was not an opera singer in the life long
past; he was a vocalist in a missionary choir, and he
wafted his dulcet tones high and loud every Sunday for
the edification of the congregation which, by the way,
was very small. I know them all, the scorpions. Then
to think I came here to tell you of my remembrances
and the many written statements I have from others
to aid you in your great experiments, and am approached
by you as the aggressor, the one to whom a
favor needs to be shown. No, Governor Lehumada;
no, sir, I will not tolerate any such impudence even
from you. I will not further state the object of my
call. I now have the pleasure to bid you good morning.â
She arose to her feet, and with one turn of her
huge frame had swept past the Governor.

97
She had spoken so fast and so fiercely, after she came
out of the half-crazed condition into which her great
love and passion had thrown her, that the good
Governor knew not what to do or what to say to quiet
her. As she passed into the hall he called to her:
âMiss Motuble, I pray you, my good young lady, to stay,
if only for one moment. You do not understand me.
I certainly am clumsy in my expressions. Dear miss,
pardon me; if you have inferred a discourtesy by any
remark I have made, pray, forgive me. You are a
source of great wonder and delight to me, and carry a
fund of valuable information.â He approached her, as
she stood near Juan panting like a tiger at bay, and
gently laying his hand upon her arm, said: âI am
forgiven, am I not? I certainly never intentionally
offend anyone, particularly a woman.â

She turned her face, full of shame and regret, to
him, and with tears in her eyes, said: âDearie, I am
so lonely; you do care for me, donât you? It is not
true, as I suspected, that your whole love is centered in
Helen Hinckley. Is it, dearie?â

With that she threw her massive arms around his neck
with such great force, that his body swayed to and fro
like a babe in the paws of a lion.

With her head on his shoulder, she sobbed: âDear,
dear Miguey, my dearie, forgive me for mistrusting you.
I was frenzied with what I thought unrequited love.
Great Revealer of Light, I thank you for making me see
my mistake.â When her petition was ended she loosened
her arms from around his neck. Governor Lehumada
sank helplessly against the wall, and Juan sprang
forward and exclaimed:

98
âYour Honor, the seÃ±orita has choked you.â He
supported the Governor, and addressing Marriet Motuble,
said: âYou are accountable, miss, for the helpless
condition of my master. You seem to remember too
much.â

All the time he had spoken to her, his back was
turned. Now, facing the place where she had stood, he
said: âI take charge of the house, now that my master
is unconscious, so, you git!â But to his great dismay
she was gone.

He rang for help, and soon the Governor was lying
comfortably in his own bed.

99

CHAPTER VIII.

A CONFESSED CRIME.

Governor Lehumada did not faint, nor was he in
the least injured by the passionate embrace of Miss
Motuble. He was speechless from surprise only, and he
allowed his men to assist him to his room, realizing that
a few moments of quiet for reflection was what he
needed.

He assured Juan that all was well, and that he wished
to be alone for a few minutes. Juan shook his head as
though he had many misgivings, and quietly left the
room. He walked slowly down the hall in deep meditation.
He wished that he were off duty, so he could
follow the strange seÃ±orita. He went into the yard and
gazed wistfully up and down the street, in the hope of
seeing her. Heaving a sigh, he turned to enter the
house again, and murmured to himself: âIt must be
the evil in the fluid that is causing the trouble.â

Some one startled him from his reverie, by saying:
âYou are his Honorâs man Juan, are you not?â

âI certainly am,â he replied.

âI was told to give you this letter, and request of you
to give it to his Honor at one oâclock this afternoon
sharp.â With that he handed Juan an official-looking
envelope, and hurried away.

100
Juan turned the large letter over and over, and read
the address on the back, several times: âTo His
Honor, Governor of Chihuahua.â âHumph! Well,
for once in my life, I wish I was âHis Honor.â I would
make quick work of seeing on the inside of this letter.
Association with these scientists has caused me to be a
man of much thought. I, too, have great ideas. I
know a thing or two. Ha! ha! It does not take a
scientist; a Governor or a President, to know that âHis
Honorâ is in love, or that there is pending (he straightened
himself up and smiled at the big sentence he was
framing) a fearful calamity, and the greatest violence
of it will fall upon this town.â

At that moment the child Catalina ran up to him,
and said: âOh, Juan, let me go to him at once. He
is in great trouble; the town has gone wrong. Juan,
guard his Honor night and day. Do not let anyone
enter the house without his knowledge. Watch for
Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir. You know him, do
you not?â

âThe great Don,âha! ha! I do know him, seÃ±orita.â

âAnd the priest, Father Hernandez?â

âHim, too,
niÃ±a
. I tell my sins to him every week,â
said Juan.

âOh, Juan, how can you?â

âBecause,
niÃ±a
, I am still a Catholic. It is not popular
to be, I know; but so long as âHis Honorâ knows I
am, and still keeps me in his service, I will be true to
the religion of my fathers.â

âHis Honor is too wise and too great a man to interfere
in anyoneâs religious beliefs,â said Catalina.

101
âYet he is a man, and loves,â quietly remarked Juan,
with a twinkle in his eye.

âHe does love. His is a great love; it extends over
all humanity. Had you lived before, Juan, and
remembered

it, you would understand,â replied the child,
with deep pathos in her voice.

Juan laughed heartily, and said: âPardon me,

niÃ±a
, but what can a
child
know of another life? If
âMemory Fluidâ makes
seÃ±oras viejas
out of
niÃ±as
, it is
not good. What would homes be without the innocent
coo and laughter of babies?â

âI am happier now than before I remembered, Juan.
It is because you do not understand what it is to
remember
,
that makes you say such things.â

âMaybe so; maybe so,
niÃ±a
, but Juan is glad he does
not
remember
.â

âMy dear
hombre viejo
, you must
remember
what I
told you about Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir and
the priest,â cried Catalina, as she ran into the house.

âGood-bye, Juan; watch out for the minister, J. T.
Noteâthe Rev. J. T. Note, as he calls himself, and his
followers. He is also a foe to progress. Guard him,
Juan; guard him well. No harm must come to his
Honor.â

Juanâs reply was upon his lips, but the charming
child was gone before he could voice it. He looked
curiously at the big envelope in his hand, and while
reading the address again and again, disappeared into
the house.

No sooner had Juan and the Governorâs other man
left him alone, than he arose from the bed upon which

102
he was reclining and walked back and forth rapidly in
an abstracted manner. He was a man who prided himself
upon his personal appearance, and now as he
stopped before the long plate-mirror and surveyed himself
he said: âDearest Helen, is there anything in my
manner of dress, my gait, or tone of voice that displeases?
If so, I will rectify it to suit you. I cannot
see myself as you see me; oh, my love, that I could!
Oh, for the power to see into the future as I now can
look into the past. Ye wise and everlasting Force,
grant me the boon of greater knowledge. All I get will
be used for the uplifting of humanity. I feel the presence
of a great force in our midst, which will bring
about a change; a change so wonderful that were I to
prophesy, no one would believe me. Each would declare
that the day of miracles is past. Poor, deluded
creatures, there will nothing happen which will be of a
miraculous nature. Simply the natural results of the
present condition of affairs will take place. The mere
fact that President Mortingo submitted himself as a
subject, to further demonstrate the use of âMemory
Fluid,â will hasten the change. We must be prepared
to meet it. We must be able to preserve peace at home
and abroad. I must not defer âtill morning to tell my
fears to the heads of departments.â He stepped to an
ivory tube by the side of his great mirror, and said,
speaking through it: âConvey to the head of each department
the following:

ââPrepare for trouble. Try to avert it. Help me
generate a great soul wave, that we may quell the disturbers
of peace and enemies of progress without force

103
or bloodshed. If trouble comes, it will be by the brewing
of Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, Father Hernandez,
Rev. J. T. Note, and the husband of Mrs. Grange,
who is assistant Freight Agent of the Chihuahua Air
Motor Railroad Company, at this city. If he joins the
peace disturbers it will be in an underhand way. He
has not the courage of the other gentlemen just mentioned.
The prime movers in any trouble that may
arise will be the three first mentioned. Others will join
them. Many well-known and prominent citizens, who
writhe in envy at the success of our administration, because
the one in which they figured was a failure from
more points of view than one, will be glad of the opportunity
to join the rebels and to assist in a cause
against us. Not because they believe in the leaders,
Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir and factionânot by
any meansâit is because they are our enemies and wish
to make us trouble, to create discord, to overthrow our
rule. No blood must be shed. We do not care to repeat
the old story. The theories we advocate and practice
must not be thrust upon humanity at the point of
the bayonet. In ages gone by, the Christian religion
was carried into all lands, the sword in one hand, and
the cross they wished to implant, in the other. There
must be an awakening of the spirit of God within man
first. It never comes by force. Love is the upbuilding
of the race. It grows within the breast of man after its
awakening, and spreads its perfume all around, like a
beautiful, fragrant rose in a well-attended garden. Remember,
force must only be employed to protect the
lives and property of our citizens, should an uprising

104
occur. That is all the instructions I care to give.
Adios, gentlemen.ââ

At the moment he ceased talking, Catalina Martinet
entered the room, unannounced. âDear papa,â she
said, âI thought I never would find you.â

âBut you succeeded. Come, tell me how you enjoyed
yourself in the Alameda,â replied the Governor,
placing a chair by his side for the strange child. He
felt a delicacy in asking about Helen Hinckley, yet he
secretly hoped she would speak only of the object of
his heartâs desire.

âOh, your Honor, it is about what I heard at the Alameda
I came to see. First, does J. Ecarg repent? Is
he doing any good now?â said Catalina.

âI have secured an excellent position for him. He
works early and late, and has not been known to frequent
any low places of resort since he first took
âMemory Fluid.â He has certainly repented of the
great wrong he did you in your previous existence, as
well as your mother. A criminal at the bar of justice
could not feel any greater remorse of conscience than he
now does from the mere fact that he in nowise gave aid
to your support or to your motherâs. He now wishes
to help you.â

âI cannot have help from him; my soul is yet sore.
Dear papa, Helen Hinckley, the most beautiful and the
truest of women, is to adopt me.â

âBless her,â cried the Governor. âThat is a happy
thought.â

âShe says that Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir
and followers are excited very much this morning.

105
Hundreds and hundreds of people have been there to-day
to see him. She was asked, late last night, after
the banquet closed, to spend the day away from the
house, but to return not later than eight oâclock to-night.
Before she left, those people began to come.
She believes their object is to formulate plans to overthrow
the state rule. She fears your life will be in
danger. She asked me to say to you to use every precaution
to avoid evil,â concluded Catalina. She
seemed to possess the very soul of Helen Hinckley.

The Governor looked into the face of the beautiful
child, and as he wiped a mist away, that seemed to
gather in his eyes, said: âThis is the return of love.
I am contented. She loves me now, I am certain. All
is well; all is well. It could not be otherwise in the
end. Truth is everlasting; it endureth forever and forever.
In the end it triumphs. The waiting for the
end often seems an eternity. Without the one I love,
every day is as an eternity. The end is near at hand.
Yet before it comes, a fearful struggle will take place.
Thou great One, from whom all light comes, bear witness
to my integrity of purpose.â

The Governor spoke aloud and gesticulated much, yet
he was unconscious, seemingly, of the fact, or that he
had company. A slight knock at the door stopped his
soliloquy, and glancing around the room in a confused
manner, he discovered the child sound asleep upon the
chair on which she sat. âPoor little darling; after all,
you are a healthy, natural child. Exhausted from last
nightâs dissipation, nature demands her rights, and is
now getting them. If my Helen has adopted you, dear,

106
you are mine, too, I will be your papa after all.â He
kissed her fondly on each full, red cheek, and quietly
opened the door.

It was Juan who was seeking admittance. He
stepped quickly into the room, after looking up and
down the hall nervously, and closed the door.

âYour actions, Juan, are strange. Explain,â said the
Governor.

Juan stood shaking and speechless, and glaring with
wide-open eyes at Catalina.

âWhat is it, man, what is it? Why do you stand
gaping like a man from whom all reason had fled?
Come, good man, be natural. I cannot lose my old
friend. Come, come, sit down; I must do something
for you,â entreated the Governor, getting very nervous.
The only sign of life Juan had shown since he entered
the room, now appeared. He raised his long, gaunt
hand, and pointed with his index finger to Catalina.

âAh!â exclaimed the Governor. âYou are surprised
to find the sweet child here. She is no cause for your
being so frightened. Come, Juan, explain yourself,â
he entreated, taking his old servantâs arm.

âYour Honor,â he whispered, âshe is not a childâshe
is a woman, and a ghost-woman at that.â

âNonsense; nonsense, man. Now I am afraid of
your reason. She is very much of a child. See how
soundly she sleeps, and the glow of health upon her
cheeks,â the Governor replied lightly, notwithstanding
the fact that he felt slightly annoyed by the strange
actions of his man, as well as his remarks concerning
the child.

107
âShe may be a child, your Honor, but she prophesies.
And I am afraid of people of her size, who make
prophecies that come true.â

âExplain yourself, Juan, explain yourself; do not
talk in riddles. What did the child prophesy?â

âIt was this way, your Honor. You remember I carried
her in my arms from the carriage into the
house, when you and her came home from the banquet
last night?â

âI certainly do,â assented Governor Lehumada; âalso
how surprised you were to find her wide-awake, instead
of sound asleep.â

âI was, your Honor; but was more surprised when
she whispered in my ear, and said: âJuan, I saw the
âPlunger from Kansasâ to-night.ââ

ââWho is he?â I asked.

ââHave you not heard of him, Juan?â

ââNo,â I said. âDoes he plunge in a Kansas river?â

ââOh, how stupid. No, he does not
plunge
at all
now. He made a big
plunge
about one hundred and
fifty years agoâbut not in a riverâoh, no, not in a
river. You are a funny man, Juan; but then, you do
not
remember
.â

ââYes, I do remember much; but not anything about
this man who
plunged
, and not into a river, one hundred
and fifty years ago. Say, chile, you is dreaming,
honey. Come, Juanita will put the precious
niÃ±a
in
bed.â I led her to the housekeeperâs room, and as we
went, she said:

ââYou are funny, Juan. I am awake, not dreaming.
You will see the âPlunger from Kansasâ to-morrow.ââ

108
ââHow will I know him when I see him?â I asked.

ââOh, he will come to this house to see Governor
Lehumada in the morning, and when he gets here he
will say: âYou are Juan, the Governorâs man? Is
his Honor in?â and when you say he is, the âPlungerâ
will reply: âI came to see him, but I will not call this
day. Please hand him this, with my compliments,â and
he will hand you a package.â

âWell, he did come, and he did say just what the
child prophesied, and he did give me this package,
your Honor. Take it, please. I am afraid of it. The
devil is let loose, as certain as fate. And I think this
fluid you tell about in your great book, is the cause of so
much trouble.â

The Governor had an interested and amused smile
on his face as he opened the package handed him by
his man.

âYou are no doubt quite right about the book I wrote,
and the public demonstrations and proofs we have given
of the results of our great fluid upon matter and mind,
being the cause of so much trouble. On that score,
Juan, you are right. But there have been no evil results,
and there will be none. But what is this? Look,
Juan, look; who is this the picture of? Donât be
mistaken, man; donât. Be sure you speak correctly.
Have you seen the face before?â

âMy sight is not good, your Honor. Itâs failing,â
replied the frightened man, getting further away from
his master, out of pure fear. âMy sight is nigh gone,
your Honor.â

âCan it be? Can it be the face of the one I loved?
Of the one I now love?â

109
âIt is Helen Hinckleyâs picture, papa, taken in that
life long gone by,â cried Catalina, grasping the
Governorâs hand.

âChild, how do you know? You have not seen it.â

âOh, I do know, I knew last night he was going to
bring it. I heard him say so at your lecture last night.
He
remembers
, you know. He is trying to palliate the
wrongs he did in that day long gone by. He is afraid
that retribution will overtake him, that he will be reduced
to poverty.â

âDid I not tell you, your Honor, that she was no
child. That she is a ghost a-talking like a grown
woman philosopher,â ventured Juan, edging nearer the
Governor, while he glared at Catalina as if she were a
spook.

âBe sensible, Juan. Be sensible. I do admit,
however, that the child is a wonder even to me; that
she has a power of speech that would be the envy of
many a collegian. But she is a child of flesh and blood,
nevertheless, and a wonderful creation, too,â concluded
the Governor.

Catalina put an end to further remarks by him, by
saying: âWhat is it, dear papa, written on the back of
the picture?â

The Governor turned the photograph around, and
said: âTo be sure, child, there is something written on
it. It is very dim. One momentâI will use some of
our restorative liquid, and then read it.â

In the center of his bedroom stood a beautifully
carved rosewood table, on which was a magnificently
beautiful piece of sculpture. It represented a little

110
girl, about eight years old, distributing the olive leaves
from a branch which seemed to be always full. The
Governor placed his hand fondly upon the head of the
statue, and at the same moment held the back of the
photograph over the mouth of the marble representation
of the child. A vapor spread over the pasteboard, yellow
and stained by time, and in three seconds, every
word written thereon stood out in bold relief.

He read aloud: âMy baby girl, Helen Hinckley,
July 3d, 1898. Boston, Massachusetts. Age, eight.â

âThe same, the same,â replied the Governor, his voice
full of emotion. âBut it does not tell me enough!
How am I to know that this was brought here by the
âPlunger from Kansas.ââ

âOn the paper in your hand,â said Catalina, âis a
message from the âPlunger.ââ

âShe is no child, I say,â cried Juan, his knees fairly
shaking with fright. âWith your Honorâs permission,
I will go out of the room. That child is too much for
me.â When he opened the door to leave, Governor
Lehumada called:

âJuan, I will not repeat what I have said to you, twice
before within the last few minutes. The child is of
flesh and blood as ourselves. There is nothing uncanny
about her; so I command you to remain in this room
until I dismiss you.â

Catalina looked up pathetically into the face of the
Governor, and said: âDonât scold him, papa; he does
not remember.â

The Governor pressed her hand, and kissed her rosy
cheek time and again. âYou are right, sweet child. I

111
should not be harsh with Juan. He does not remember,â
he kindly replied.

âHow much is written, papa dear?â

âTo be sure, child; I have not read what is written
on the paper. This is a strange handwriting also. It
reads:

ââThe photograph was given to me by the father of
the child, Honorable E. Willard Hinckley, in his own
home in Kansas City, August, 1898. That very day I
got more than one-half million dollars from him, and
gave him as security a mortgage on fifty thousand cattle
I never owned. In less than sixty days he was a
bankrupt; in ninety days he was dead; his wife and
child were penniless and homeless. Despite the long
number of years which have passed, that photograph has
been preserved in a way nothing short of a miracle.
Five times have I put it on the burning coals; three
times in black, muddy water. Out of each it came unsullied.
Out of a superstitious fear I resolved to
keep it, to preserve and guard it with the same care as
one would an ancient heirloom of untold value. It has
ever been a thorn in my side. In that life one hundred
and fifty years agoâthe time I made my memorable
plunge in cattle, the thought that I could not get rid
of the picture of little Helen, drove me wild with rage.
It was in a fit of frenzy, brought on by not being able to
destroy the picture, that made me take my life. I was
then in South America. My wife had perished in an
epidemic shortly before, and no one knew just what
destiny befell me, âThe Plunger from Kansas,â and no
one but those whom I had wronged, cared. Before committing

112
the deed that sent me out of the body to try to
find relief, I sent a large package to a relative in Kansas.
Amongst the things it contained was the picture.
Thus it was preserved in the great iron safe in which
various documents and family curios were put for
safety. On my return to earth after an absence of half
of a century this photograph fell to my part of the
family keepsakes. And while in that life I never
knew its history, it always filled me with fear and trembling
when I saw it. At the age of thirty-five I
passed again out of the physical bodyâand lay in a
state of unconsciousness for fifty-six years. I was awakened
by a voice which seemed to say: âHelen is here.
Have you no desire to rectify the wrongs you did her in
that life long since passed away?â I did not understand,
yet I prayed to be allowed to live, that I might
be better and wiser. And I was born again. Fortune
favored me from my birth. I was born to wealth, and
the faculty I have of acquiring it is a wonder to many.
I am now twenty-eight years old, the same age I was
when I performed the feat in cattle-plunging. I bring
you this photograph with the strange feeling that to
you it belongs, and when it is securely in your hands,
the dreadful nightmare the sight of it gives me, will
leave me. This town has a fascination for me, of which
I cannot get rid. I feel nervous, as I did one hundred
and fifty years ago, when I was here a refugee, whenever
I see an armed officer of the law, or a strange face that
gives me more than a passing glance. Retribution,
you say, is going to overtake me. If the law can get
me, handle me; but to use a slang phrase of the nineteenth

113
century, I will close by saying: âCatch me if
you can; but I think I am too
swift
for you in this life,
as well as I was then.â

ââI am, your obedient servant,

ââ
The Plunger from Kansas
.ââ

CHAPTER IX.

MARRIET REPORTS HERSELF DEAD.

The Governor heaved a sigh when he had finished, as
if a burden had suddenly dropped from his shoulders.

âHow long since he gave this to you, Juan?â

âAbout fifteen minutes before I entered this room,
your Honor.â

âDid it take you fifteen minutes to get up the stairs?â

âI am an old man, your Honor, but am yet spry.
When the Plunger left, I was called to your private
study, where SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales wished to speak
to me. If your Honor cares, I will tell you everything
he said. First, he sent a message to you, which I have
not had an opportunity until this moment to deliver.
He told me to say to you, that though the President has
returned to consciousness he desires to be left alone that
he may write a full account of his past, provided he
remembers
.â

âVery well, Juan,â replied the Governor. âI will
not interrupt his Excellency. And as for you telling
me
all
the scientist said to you, there is no necessity for
you telling anything, except the message you have just
delivered.â

âSince the âPlungerâ came, I feel it my duty to tell
you that SeÃ±or Gonzales cautioned me to guard you

115
closely; to allow no one to pass into the house without
you knowing the person and giving your consent. That
trouble is brewing in the city, and your life would be
threatened,â said Juan.

âIt is certainly kind of him and others to be so interested
in my welfare. I am least concerned about my
own safety. I have a strange presentiment that I will
not be harmed. It is the safety of the people, the great
multitude around us, Juan, about whom I am concerned.
Rest assured, good man, I will protect my
people, no matter what the cost.â

âBut, dear papa, the people would not be able to protect
themselves, if you were gone. Dear papa, do not
court danger,â cried Catalina.

âThat child! She makes me afraid, your Honor. I
wish she were more like my own little granddaughter,â
said Juan, stepping closer to the marble statue and
further from the child.

âPoor man,â said Catalina, âhe does not
remember
.
He is afraid of me, is he not, papa? How strange that
anyone is afraid of a little girl.â

âIt is strange, dear; but Juan is an old man and has
never taken âMemory Fluid,ââ replied the Governor.
âJuan, I will remain in my room with Catalina. Serve
us a luncheon here promptly at twelve-thirty, one hour
hence. I have a presentiment that I will be seriously
occupied about one oâclock. Tell the
chef
to prepare a
luncheon for two persons, in a manner befitting his Excellency,
and send it promptly at half-past twelve to my
private studio.â

âYes, your Honor,â he replied, with a low curtesy, as

116
he left the room, while he mentally exclaimed: âIf I
am not a fool, he will be
seriously occupied at
one
oâclock. The big letter I have is to be delivered to him
at that time. I wish it were
one
now; I want to get rid
of it. It seems to be burning a hole into my body. I
thought I would âsperiment with âMemory Fluidâ this
morning. But now I will do nothing rash. I will let
the past rest, so far as I am concerned, until I see the
result of the present unsettled state of affairs. In the
meantime I will take the matter of being a subject under
grave consideration. If I was just ten years
younger, strangers would take me for a great scientist.
At sixty it is difficult for a man to take on new ideas.â
Juan had not been commenting aloud, consequently was
very much surprised by hearing the familiar tones of
Julio Murillo saying: âDonât bother about your age,
Juan. You will live again, if you desire; then you may
be a very learned man.â

Juan did not reply, and the great scientistâs assistant
went on.

With his head low upon his breast, frightened and
trembling, Juan hastened to the kitchen.

Governor Lehumada and Catalina were reclining in
large, comfortable chairs in the room where Juan had
left them. The Governor in deep meditation, the child
thumping upon the arm of the chair with a small
stick, and singing softly, the words, âBe it ever so humble,
there is no place like home;â and the exquisite tone
in which they were sung caught the ear of the Governor
and unknown to the child, he watched her intently until
her song ceased.

117
âThose words, Catalina, sound strangely familiar to
me. Is it a new song, or an old one revived?â he asked.

âIt is an old song, your Honor,â replied the child, as
she curtesied prettily to him, in the same manner she
did the day she came to the State House to sell her
flowers. It was only a few days ago, yet it seemed to the
Governor that a year or more had passed. In fact, the
child had grown to be so great a part of his life that
it seemed incredulous that she had ever lived elsewhere.

âWhere did you learn it, dear?â asked the Governor.

The child was startled at first, and looked frightened;
then, throwing out her arms, she rushed to the Governor,
crying: âFor a moment I was the Catalina of
long ago. I was unhappy. I had ceased to remember
myself as I now am. I thought I was the poor Catalina
of disgrace and despair whom the President taught to
sing that song so long ago. He sang it to me the night
he left for âthe States,â in the other life that I knew
him.â

âWas he kind to you, dear?â asked the Governor.

âIndeed he was, papa; kinder than any man had
been. Sometimes he vexed me greatly. I did not understand
him, and he was a constant tease.â

âHe was an American tourist in Mexico then, was he
not?â asked the Governor.

âHe was an American, I am quite sure; but I do not
think he was in Mexico for pleasure,â replied Catalina.

âPossibly not,â commented the Governor; âat that
time many Americans were coming to Mexico to prospect.
He no doubt was a mining man.â

âI do not think so,â confidently replied Catalina.

118
âNo? What idea have you then, child?â

âHe had much money to spend, and every time he
came, and he came often, he gave me money; sometimes
food and clothes. My mother washed for several people
who stayed at the big white hotel facing the principal
plaza. He knew this, and whenever he came he questioned
me about these peopleâhe wanted to know what
I saw in their rooms. I always went with my mother to
help her carry
la ropa limpia
home. I had a sharp eye
and usually saw everything in view in the room,â she replied.

âI cannot understand,â replied the Governor, âwhy
he questioned you about what these people had in their
rooms. He must have been consumed with idle curiosity.â

âHe asked me,â continued Catalina, âif I could bring
him the â
phiz
â of a certain man, who with his wife stayed
at the hotel.â

âThe
phiz
? What did he mean, child?â

â
I
did not know then, and told him so, and he said:
âWell, I will tell you what I mean by a phiz.â He took
a pencil and note book from his pocket, made a few
strokes on the paper and handed me a picture of myself.
âOh, no.â I said, on seeing what he meant, âI cannot
make pictures.â He left the house, saying he would be
back in one-half of an hour. He came as he promised,
and brought a little black box, which he said was a

camera
. He showed me how to use it, and I consented
to take it with me the next time we went to carry
la
ropa
to the hotel, and take a picture of the man and
woman, also one of the room. I did so, and here it is.

119
Also my phiz.â She handed the pictures to the Governor,
and while looking at them intently, he said:

âCan it be possible, child, that this is the picture of
the great counterfeiter who operated in Mexico for so
many years, and whom I delivered into the hands of the
United States authorities? It is, it is. I
remember

him well. And this, dear child, is your âphiz,â is it?
It is not unlike you now. But you were older then than
at present, were you not?â

âI was older. I am eight now, and I was eleven when
that was made.â

âMr. Mortingo, the President of the great United
States of America,â laughed Governor Lehumada, âwas
a secret service man in the year 1898. I remember him
well. He was a jolly, generous chap, and on coming to
Chihuahua I remember the remark he made when he
first called upon me. He said:

ââUncle Sam has sent me down here to catch some
birds who are in your city. They are molding and shoving
the queer.ââ

âYes,â said Catalina, âthat is what he kept telling
meâthat they were âshoving the queerâââto which the
Governor replied:

âI understood very little English at that time, but the
official interpreter put it into the best Spanish he could
and I at once saw the point. The Americans were much
given to the use of slang then, much of which had a
singular fitness. I committed the phrase to memory and
never forgot it. Let me see the other picture; the interior
of the room.â

The child handed him the picture, and pointing to a

120
certain place in it, said: âThere is the lump of silver
they were chopping up as we went in. In the kettle
over the fire is lead.â

âHa! ha! ha! ha!â laughed the Governor. âThat
is very interesting to know. I wonder what will be the
feelings of the President, should he remember?â

âI have several packages of spaghetti he gave me to
use on feast days. He showed me how to cook it. We
learned to like it so well, he declared that my forefathers
were Italians. And sure enough, my mother began to
hunt up old family history, and she discovered that her
great-grandmother was an Italian noblewoman,â said
Catalina.

âChild,â replied the Governor, âyou have always been
something more to me than an ordinary child, a child
of entirely plebeian birth. The mere fact of your
wounded pride on learning that you were born out of
wedlock, that broke your heart and caused your untimely
demise, proved the question of your blood to be
other than plebeian.â

âI do not cry any more now, over the past,â said Catalina,
âfor I believe in the righting of all wrongs. It is
worked out by Nature and Natureâs help to man.â

âCome, child, my little philosopher, kiss your papa;
kiss me fondly. A strange fear is crowding over me,â
he said, holding out his arms to her.

She did his bidding with much fervor, and whispering
in his ear, said: âJuan is coming with our
luncheon. I will open the door.â

The faithful old man entered and set before them a
dainty meal, and stood quietly back of the Governorâs

121
chair while he ate heartily of the food. The meal was
quite contrary to the usual customs of the householdâthat
is, without any conversation and with much dispatch.

The Governor arose when he had finished, looked at
his watch, and said: âIt is now one oâclock. Juan,
remove the dishes, and take the child to the housekeeper.â

âYes, your Honor,â replied Juan. âHere is a letter
I was told to give you at one oâclock.â

The Governor took the letter, and kissing the child
fondly, said: âGo with Juan, dear, and tell Juanita
you need to sleep.â

As they were leaving the room, she said: âI am
sleepy and will take a napâbut will show you the way
to Marriet Motuble, when you go.â

âA strange child,â mentally commented the Governor,
as he tore the envelope open. âAs if I intended to call
upon Miss Motuble, the massive giantess; the aggressive
seÃ±orita. No, no, Catalina, dear, sweet child, you are a
wonder in many ways, but this time you are mistaken.
Dearest Helen, would that I could visit you! What,
what is this?â holding the letter he pulled out of the
envelope at armâs length. âWhat is it?â

âI, Marriet Motuble, nearing the end of my third
existence,â he read, âwish you to bear in mind the following:
that by the time you have finished reading this
note which I have ordered to be left with you at one
oâclock this very day, I will no more be a mortal. By
my own hands will the great chasm which separates the

122
physical from the spiritual of man be reached. Such
an act has been recorded, since the beginning of time,
as a crime against the great Creator as well as against
self. Be it further known that I, Marriet Motuble, this
moment confess to my many faults, the greatest of all
my sins to my mind being my pretensions to having
been a subject of âMemory Fluid,â or of having remembered
a previous existence. I only made this pretense
to ingratiate myself into your favor, knowing your great
belief in your wonderful âMemory Fluid,â to make you
return my great love. My labors were in vain. I am,
on the other hand, repulsive to youâso I this day, at
one oâclock, make an end of this earthly existence.â

The Governor looked at his watch. âAh!â he exclaimed,
âit is one oâclock this very moment. Can it be
that she is now taking this step? What can I do to
prevent this mad act? I will send her a messageâwhere
does she live?âI have not the faintest idea. I
will have Juan inquire.â

Juan appeared almost instantly after the Governorâs
call.

âDo you know where Miss Motuble lives? The
lady, I mean, who called here early this morning?â
asked the Governor.

âNo, sir, I do not,â replied Juan, eying the Governor
curiously.

âFind out, immediately. If necessary, employ a detective.
I must know if there is any possible way of
finding out.â

âI will do my best, your Honor, my very best,â replied

123
Juan, as he left the room, shaking his head dubiously.
The Governor followed him to the door engrossed
with his own thoughts.

âJuan,â he called, âhere one moment.â

Juan returned and looked questioningly into his face.

âGo to my private study at once, and say to SeÃ±ors
Guillermo Gonzales and Julio Murillo to do me the
favor to meet me here this moment, if they have the
leisure. With dispatch, Juan, with dispatch.â

âYes, your Honor,â replied Juan, as he hurried away.

Such a request had never been made to the scientists
before, and without any delay they hurried to the
Governor, curious to know the object of the call.

The door leading into the room was wide open, and
as they entered, the great author of âLiquid from the
Sunâs Raysâ stood in the middle of the floor re-reading
Marriet Motubleâs letter. He greeted them warmly, and
without any delay said: âI have received a very strange
letterâno stranger, however, than the person by whom
it is writtenâthe aggressive seÃ±orita Marriet Motuble.â

âMarriet Motuble!â exclaimed both men in a low
voice.

âYour surprise cannot possibly be greater than mine,â
replied the Governor. âPlease reserve your surprise for
what I will read you. In fact, I am inclined to believe
most anything, if what I have read of this long letter be
true. I am yet in ignorance of the nature of the remainder
of the letter. Be seated, friends, and I will
start at the beginning.â

The three great men sat down in a circle, and when
the Governor had re-read the first part of the letter

124
and various comments had been made, the Governor began
reading where he had previously left off:

âI repeat that I, Marriet Motuble, this day at one
oâclock will make an end of my present earthly existence.
Farewell, farewell, my adored one, farewell.
Although my great love for you was not reciprocated in
this life, I will live again and again. In the next life
I hope to have sufficient power to compel love to grow in
your heart, in your great noble breast, for meâfor me
alone.

âMy life is not lived upon the highest plane, for I
long for revenge; for revenge upon the one you adore.
Her name is upon your lips at this moment, and you
breathe a prayer for her protection. Beware! if I have
the power, her downfall will come shortly. She upon
whom I wish for revenge to fall, is Helen Hinckley.
And I am the one who adores you.

â
Marriet Motuble.
â

âThat is not all,â said the Governor, âbut before
I read this, which is entitled, âA Matter of Business,â
I will ask you what I would better do in regard to
the case. It seems so perfectly absurd that anyone
would kill himself for such a foolish reason. I cannot
imagine one loving another for whom he knew the other
had no regard.â

âLove,â replied the great scientist, âis a strange thing.
It goes out toward the object of its desire, prompted by
no other motive, it would seem, than to do the will of
the person upon whom it is lavished. Miss Motuble

125
has my sympathies, most certainly, because she is
in error. What she terms love is a misnomer. However,
we must investigate. If self destruction has not
taken place, we must use every means known to science
to prevent it.â

Julio Murillo was walking back and forth, as was his
custom, his hands clasped tightly behind him, intent
upon what was being said, and forming his own conclusions.

âHave you no suggestions to offer, friend Julio?â
asked the Governor.

âYes, your Honor,â he replied, facing the two men;
âI would suggest that you do not let this matter annoy
you in the least. Miss Motuble will never take her own
life!â

âYou speak so positively, I am encouraged. But
what makes you think so, friend Julio?â

âThe reasons he will give, Miguey, will be scientific
ones, and you can rely upon them,â said Guillermo Gonzales,
as he embraced Julio and said: âTell us upon
what grounds you base your statements.â

âI am at this moment,â replied Julio, â
en rapport

with the bewitching, aggressive seÃ±orita. She is half
reclining in a beautiful lounging-robe, on a couch so
rich that Cleopatra would have envied it in her days of
splendor. Now she lifts a goblet to her lips and cries:
âThe drink of the gods! What a joke it is to play upon
the credulity of the Governor. What the result will be
when they search for me and find me peacefully taking
my siesta, instead of being no more a mortal, no more of
clay, I cannot say. Ha! ha! If I cannot secure his

126
love, I will create an uproar. I will be prominent yet
before I die. I will crush the life out of all the scorpions
around here. I will, I will!â She now falls over
amongst her pillows embraced in the arms of sleep.â

âIf there is no doubt about what you tell me, I will
certainly hold this young woman accountable for her
little confidence game. I have sent Juan to find her
address. Should he succeed in finding it you will accompany
me to see her,â said the Governor.

âYou must go in disguise, your Honor, as a physician;
we three will go disguised thus. It is not
necessary to wait for the return of your man. I know
perfectly well the place where she now is,â said Julio.

At that moment Juan entered the room, panting and
frightened. âYour Honor,â he cried, âI employed a
detective; he has this moment returned to say that
Miss Motuble is dead by her own hands. Her body was
laid, less than an hour ago, in the old private family
vault of the Motubles.â

âEveryone knows the place. It was there the child
Catalina Martinet was buried,â cried the Governor.

âThe detectiveâs statements are false,â said Julio
Murillo. âI mean he has been misinformed. Someone
may have been placed in the Motuble tomb, under the
name of Marriet Motuble, but the real person is alive
and is as strong to-day as anyone of us three.â

âJuan,â asked the Governor, âare you sure no mistake
has been made by you in repeating this message?â

âI am sure, your Honor, and I am sorry SeÃ±or Julio
thinks she is not dead,â said Juan.

âHow inhuman!â exclaimed Guillermo Gonzales.

127
âMaybe so, your honor; but women who make men
afraid should die.â

âYou have strange ideas of getting rid of annoyances,â
said the Governor, trying to hide a smile. âI
will ring for you, Juan, when I need you again.â

Juan was getting intensely interested in the affair on
hand, and was secretly congratulating himself that he
would hear everything; consequently, was very much
crestfallen when the Governor very politely invited him
to leave the room.

âThat part of Miss Motubleâs letter which relates to
the deception she practiced by pretending to have been
a subject of âMemory Fluid,â is false also; there was no
pretension about it. She actually came disguised as a
drunken man, and entreated me to give her âMemory
Fluid.â Her figure was a splendid disguise, but her
actions and voice betrayed her sex to me. By no sign
from me did she ever know that I had penetrated her
disguise. She certainly is a strange mixture of Godâs
creationâa strange mixture,â concluded Julio.

âI know of no case as interesting as hers, unless it
is the case of âThe Plunger from Kansas,ââ said the
scientist, Guillermo Gonzales.

âYou are correct, my friend,â said the Governor.
âAs soon as I finish reading Miss Motubleâs letter, or I
would better say lettersâthis one is entitled, âA Matter
of Businessââwe will disguise ourselves as doctors and
ferret out the mystery of the tomb, after we convince
ourselves that she is alive. She used a different tone in
writing this:

128
ââ
To His Excellency, Governor of Chihuahua
:
Be it known that on the day which shall from henceforth
be known as âMemory Fluid Day,â that I,
Marriet Motuble, being an attentive listener to the lecture,
and a guest at the banquet, where all I saw and
heard consumed me with interest, and where the following
plot I overheard, which I now relate to put you on
your guardâthat I may show to you my great appreciation
of your wonderful discoveries and the great love
and esteem in which I hold the lives of my fellowman.
The words that first attracted my attention were spoken
by Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, well known to
yourself, to a man who wears the garb of a priest,
Father Hernandez by name. He said: âThe nefarious
works of this man Lehumada, a man of purely Mexican
origin, whom we elected to fill the highest office in the
hands of the people of Chihuahua, has betrayed the confidence
imposed upon him to such an extent that it now
behooves us to put our shoulders to the wheel and stop
the downward run he is hurrying us to perdition. The
time-honored institutions and customs of our once great
and beloved Mexico have fast disappeared. And now
it is left to one of our own race; one of our own dear
Mexican blood, to pretend to discover a liquid which will
restore and perpetuate memory to be used to get evidence
of crimes that poor souls are said to have committed
in lives gone by, that they may now be brought
to justice. There is no telling how far these accursed
doings will be carried. It will not stop at the trial of
âThe Plunger from Kansas.ââ The priest replied:
âYour story I will spread far and wide. I will raise an

129
army from amongst the priests, and our followers and
our sympathizers. Money will buy a great following
who at present are seeking work, and have no scruples.
To these people I will paint the intentions of the present
makers of âMemory Fluid,â as black as midnight.
I will have our own priesthood falling by countless thousands
into a yawning abyssâfilled with the blood of our
own downtrodden. Complete organization is absolutely
necessary. That can be done in this city within twenty-four
hours. Through our secret code we will advise
our sympathizers over the entire continent of America
of our intention. They will be ready to come to our
assistance at the moment of our call. The first step we
will take in this city to-morrow night, when we hope to
arrest and put to death the three instigators of this
great evil that seems to be spreading over the entire continent.
This is the beginning of a long and bloody war
which will be waged between Free Thought and the
dogmatic teachings of the churches. Particularly do I
hope for the re-establishment of the ancient and time-honored
institution of our long-lost Mexico.â The two
men arose, embraced each other, and hurried away to
spread their evil intentions amongst their followers present.
If this information proves a warning to you, I will
be greatly repaid for the slight service I have rendered
you. May the great Power above guide you safely
through the conflict about to be waged between Scientific
Thought and those wedded to the creeds of the
churchesâto the dogmatic teachings of every denomination
and society on the face of the earth.

ââYour aider and abettor in all your scientific investigations

130
in this life and those other lives we will live
together in the future, yours, through all time,

ââ
Marriet Motuble
.â

âA strange woman,â said Governor Lehumada, as he
folded the letter and placed it within the envelope.

âThere may be much truth in her statements. We
have received many warnings since nine oâclock this
morning, about this same affair. I hope we may be
able to avert it,â said Guillermo Gonzales.

âIt cannot be done,â came the emphatic prophecy of
Julio Murillo. âSo I beg of you to waste no time.
Trouble is gathering thick and fast on every side. Let
us prepare our disguise at once and hasten to the tomb
and to Marriet Motuble.â

The two men left the Governor to prepare a disguise,
and Juan entered to assist him.

131

CHAPTER X.

A DAY OF CONUNDRUMS.

In thirty minutes the Governor and his two scientific
friends disguised as physicians, stepped into a private
cab propelled by air.

Julio Murillo gave directions to the motorman to take
them through the streets slowly to the Mexican Annex.

The cab was circular in form and around it extended
a glass window which magnified everything seen through
it from the interior of the cab, while from the street
nothing in the interior of the cab could be seen.

Governor Lehumada leaned back amongst the comfortable
cushions, by the side of SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales,
and engaged him in conversation, the coach gliding
noiselessly through the street the while.

Julio Murillo sat upon the high observation stool in
the center of the circular cab, where he saw, through the
window near the top of the cab, everything in the streets
through which they passed.

Occasionally he gave directions to the motorman, who
was comfortably seated in the center of the top of the
cab, through the speaking tube, to turn in this direction
and that direction. Three-quarters of an hour had
passed since they left the Governorâs mansion, and still

132
they were winding in and out from one street to the
other, and yet they seemed to be no nearer than they
were at first to the Mexican Annex.

The two men talked unceasingly and were not in the
least disturbed by not reaching their destination.
They had never known Julio to do an act without being
able to give a good reason for it, and now they did not
question his object in taking them through various
streets, back and forth, instead of directly to the hotel.

The cab came to a stop in front of a large drug store.

It being the physicianâs cab belonging to the Governorâs
mansion, and on account of its peculiar construction,
it attracted much attention wherever it went.

The motorman descended from his conspicuous seat
and entered the drug store to fulfill the orders of Julio
Murillo.

âFriends,â said Julio, when their cab had come to a
standstill, âdo me the favor to watch closely out of the
window. A curious little play is going to take place in
front of this store within a few minutes.â

âWith much pleasure, friend Julio,â replied the Governor,
as the two men arose to look out of the window.

âThe All-Wise has been kind to you, my compatriot,
to give you the power to read the thoughts and know of
the actions of those around you,â said SeÃ±or Guillermo
Gonzales.

âI am grateful, my friend, for all the progress I have
made. Get in tune with Nature and her mysteries you
can read. The divinity of Her force, Her influence, can
be felt by all,â replied Julio seriously.

âWhat a strange looking man is now entering the

133
drug storeâthat big swaggerer there to the right,â said
the Governor.

âYes, to be sure,â said SeÃ±or Gonzales. âHe makes
me think of one of those ancient Northmen sailors, or
a big, raw-boned Irishman of more recent days.â

âWhat a strange gait he has,â remarked the Governor;
âthere is something familiar about the fellow.
I wonder if I have met him before.â

âYes, your Honor, you have met
her
before,â said
Julio.

âHer?â exclaimed his companions in a breath.
âHer?â

âYes, you both have met her. That person is no
other than SeÃ±orita Marriet Motuble, the lovesick
maiden of less than two hours ago, who claimed to have
committed suicide because her great love for you was
not reciprocated. Watch her closely. I will put on the

sound condenser
; then we can both see and hear what
is going on,â said Julio.

âWho is the man, with whom she is talking?â asked
the Governor.

âDon Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, your Honor,â
quietly answered Julio.

âHe also is in disguise, then. What can be the meaning
of all of this, Julio?â questioned the Governor.

âYour questions can be answered more definitely
when I turn the lever of the sound condenser,â said
Julio. âEvery five minutes one of the tubes is filled
and ready, when the lever is turned, to repeat every word
spoken within ten feet from the center of its radius.
The five minutes is up. Watch the two while we listen,

134
and we can more fully comprehend the meaning of
their conversation.â

Julio turned the lever, and the three scientists heard
the following conversation, Marriet Motuble being the
first to speak.

âIt is pathetic to know that one so young and so fair
would take her own life. She is the young woman, I
believe, who is private secretary to the well-known
Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, is she not?â asked
Marriet Motuble, as she puffed a cigar in regular man
fashion.

âIf the person is Marriet Motuble,â said Governor
Lehumada, with much concern, âwhy does she ask such
a question?â

âIt is a ruse,â replied Julio, âto find out something
about the young lady to whom she refers. She is exceedingly
fond of Miss Hinckley, and at the same time
insanely jealous of her. What is it her companion is
replying?â concluded Julio.

âNo doubt Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir would
be glad if such were the case. He believes, I understand,
that this young woman will be the means of much
domestic unhappiness and outside trouble, unless that
by means other than his own she can be induced to
leave his employment. This blue-blooded Mexican is a
royal friend of mine, and I will take it upon myself
to offer one thousand dollars
in gold
as my friend
would say. You know he has never yet acknowledged
Mexico to be a part of the States. Yes, I will
pay one thousand dollars in gold to the person who will
induce Miss Hinckley to leave my friendâs employment.â

135
âIndeed,â replied Marriet Motuble. âI wish I knew
the charming lady. A fellow could not easier make one
thousand in gold, and perhaps get the lady as well.
Say, sir, itâs settled, Iâll get her away. Have this cigar,
and letâs go in and have a large glass of the old popular
drink of the ancient Mexicans to celebrate the
blue blood, the royal Mexican blood, of your friend
Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir,â said the aggressive
seÃ±orita.

âImprobable it seems to me that the person can be
a woman,â said the Governor.

âHard to believe, yet as true as fate,â replied
Julio.

âThanks,â replied Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir,
taking the proffered cigar; âwith your permission,
we will drink to the royal blood of my friend
a little later.â

âAs you please,â replied Marriet Motuble.

âFirst,â said her companion, âlet me introduce myself.
Jose M. Martinezâmy card, please. Of Mexican
extraction also, you see.â

âAh, I see the connectionâa sympathizer. Well,
well, this is royal blood too, and mighty glad I am to
know you, SeÃ±or Martinez. Let me present myself.
Leo Leanderâmy card, please. I also pride myself upon
my lineage. I am a lineal descendant of the Northmen.
But it is not family genealogy we are here to discuss,â
replied Leo Leander.

âYou are right, SeÃ±or Leander; yet it fills oneâs
bosom with pride to be able to trace blood.â Getting
very close to him, he continued: âIâm sure your

136
sympathies are with my friend in the uprising in which
he is about to be the instigator. Can I trust you?
You seem to be such a royal fellow.â

âI do not quite comprehend you, my friend; but if
you or your friend are in trouble, command me. I
am your most obedient servant,â said the pretender,
Leo Leander.

âI am content,â said Mr. Martinez; ââ
muy contento
,â
as my ancestors would have expressed it. Now, friend
Leander, this is the point I wish to make. Miss Hinckley
must be gotten away from the house of my friend
before nightfall. She knows too much about his reverence
for the ancient customs of his long-lost Mexico.
She must be gotten rid ofâdo you comprehend?â

âI grasp your meaning, I am quite sure. Leave her
to me; I will put her beyond the sight of mortal eye.â

Mr. Martinez shook his hand warmly, and said:
âThere is one thing more, then we will drink the health
of my royal-blooded friend, who, I hope, soon will be
your friend also. The author of âLiquid from the Sunâs
Raysââthat accursed fluid which they claim restores
memoryâand his would-be scientific associates, must be
killed before morning. We are determined to have a
revolution. We are determined to rend this part of
the country, so long known as Mexico, from the
rule of the United States of America. We are assured
now of a following of ten thousand from each State
that was at one time a part of Old Mexico, or the Republic
of Mexico. You know the history, do you not, of
that long-suffering, brave and downtrodden people?
We wish to sever our relations from the people who
united us to them without our consent.â

137
âWe certainly do,â said a voluptuous man who had
been standing close by, an attentive listener.

âAh, old fellow, here you are,â exclaimed Mr. Martinez,
in true democratic style. âOn time to the
second. Let me present you to my friend SeÃ±or Leo
Leander, Don Enrique Arellano.â The two men shook
hands cordially, and Don Enrique Arellano embraced
him after the fashion of the nineteenth century Mexicans.

The three men in the cab turned from the scene in
front of them, and gazed in astonishment at each other.

âWhat deception they are playing,â said Julio.
âThe fellow introduced as Don Enrique Arellano is
none other than the priest, Father Hernandez.

âIs it possible?â cried the Governor.

âThis is a strange affair,â said SeÃ±or Guillermo
Gonzales; âa strange affair.â

âThe priest is talking,â said Julio. âWe must not lose
a word he says.â

The three men again turned their faces toward the
street, and listened intently to what was being said:

âI caught my friendâs last remarks as I came up,â
said the man introduced as Don Enrique Arellano.
âWe must sever the existing relations between the country
known as the Republic of Mexico, long, long years
ago, and the United States of America. We are determined
to re-establish the Republic.â

âAnd how are the latest reports?â asked Mr. Martinez.

âI have been assured the support of every bishop
in the states that once were a part of long-lost
Mexico.â

138
âOur powerâI mean the power of the Church, as
wielded in the nineteenth-century Mexico, is only known
by reading history,â said Mr. Martinez.

âI see where you are correct, my friends. The relations
must be severed. The civil law must be revised.
It is sad, sad, sad to see the poor, downtrodden priests,
poorly fed, poorly dressedâthose, I mean, who have to
depend upon the church only for support. They struggle
bravely on and uncomplainingly, hoping and praying,
no doubt, to regain the long-lost power they had
over the people during the life of Pope Leo XIII.â

âQuite true;â replied Don Enrique Arellano, wiping
a tear from his eye, âquite true. Then the priests were
clad in purple and fine linen; then they received fifteen
dollars for every marriage ceremony they performedânow
only one; then the many feast days brought them
thousands of
centavos
; now they are so few that the
increase in the church treasury is hardly perceptible.
The people are too much enlightened in the ways of the
evil world, and not enough in the ways of the church, or,
I would better say, this Government does not teach them
submissionâthere is no head. Each goes his own way;
each thinks for himself; hence the priest has lost his
power, and I say it must be recovered,â vigorously
concluded Mr. Arellano.

âLet us drink to the health and wealth of the priests,
and to the recovery of your long-lost Mexico,â said
Leo Leander, evidently hoping to spring something
new on them.

The three actors passed into a bar near by, out of
sight of the three scientists in the cab.

139
âSo much has transpired since we stopped in front of
this drug store, it seems to me that it must be night,â
said the Governor.

âOn the other hand,â replied Julio, âthe time is only
ten minutes later than the moment we arrived here.â

âShall we proceed to the tomb of Marriet Motuble?â
asked SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales, with a smile.

âWhen the two return,â said Julio, âwe will get some
more information; then we will start.â

âYou say we will start. Will something prevent us
from reaching the place, Julio?â quietly asked the
Governor.

âWe will reach the tomb, but not for several hours
yet,â he replied; âand now I must have the motorman
return to his seat. We must be prepared to follow wherever
they go.â

The exquisite notes of a bird close by, went out upon
the air. People passing stopped and looked for the
bird in every direction. Failing to see it they hurried
on. At the first sound the motorman came out of the
store carrying a large package, which he handed to
Julio, and without a word climbed to his seat on the
top of the cab.

âThat was your secret signal, was it not, Julio, which
you told me you had invented?â asked SeÃ±or Guillermo
Gonzales.

âIt was, my friend, and it works to perfection. I
will explain the principle of it later. See! the trio are
coming from the bar,â replied Julio.

Once more they were intent in their thoughts and
looks upon the three strange people in disguise.

140
Leo Leander said, evidently continuing a sentence
she had begun at the bar: âOh, yes, I know quite well
the way to the Motuble tomb. After her tragic death
was noised about, I met a friend of hers to whom I expressed
a desire to see the old tomb and to know its
strange history. He told me the story of the Marriet
Motuble who lived in a life gone by, also the pathetic tale
of the child, Catalina Martinet, for whom the tomb was
built. I expressed a desire to see it. He gave me this key,
which was presented to him by the deceased seÃ±orita,
who begged him, if it fell to her lot to pass away first, to
visit the tomb often, and grant the same privilege to his
friends. Curious to see the tomb, I hurried out to the
city of the dead, and had just arrived, when two men
clothed in black, and carrying a large, heavy metallic
coffin, entered the tomb, deposited their burden and hastened
away. No one was present but myself, and they
evidently took me for an officer of law. For they had
not gone very far when one of the miserable cowards
came running back; he handed me a paper and requested
me to sign it. At first I refused; but the poor
devil insisted that I was the proper person to sign it,
and if I refused they would be imprisoned on their return
without my name. So intent were they, that I
was worked up to the belief that I was the person who
should sign it, and I mustered up courage and wrote the
first name that came to me, other than my own.â

âAnd what name was it?â asked Mr. Martinez.

âJulio Murillo,â calmly replied Leo Leander.

The three men in the cab threw up their hands in
astonishment, and Mr. Arellano cried: âJesus and

141
Marie! Jesus and Marie! You saved the poor wretches
from present trouble, but should this act of yours become
known, which will be sure to happen, your life
will be in danger.â

âI am fearless. You cannot frighten me, friends,
with the law as practiced in Chihuahua,â said Leo Leander.
âIf it is now your pleasure, we will visit the tomb,
gentlemen,â he concluded.

âA brave fellow,â said Mr. Arellano, âa brave fellow.
You will lead and thousands will follow. Ah, friend
Martinez, we are to be congratulated on having this
great leader on our side. Lead; we will follow to the
tomb. The work we desire to have accomplished to-night
is in the hands of the proper person.â

âYou will please accompany me to the Mexican Annex;
there we will take a cab-a physicianâs cab, like
that one there, if one can be secured. Come, gentlemen,
we must be off, or the bloodhounds will be on our scent,â
concluded Leo Leander, walking off at a brisk pace.

At the same moment the Governorâs cab started on
at a rapid rate after them.

âNo scientific investigation ever puzzled me more
than this present affair,â said the Governor.

âNor me, friend Miguey. These disturbers of the
law must be placed under arrest before sunset,â said
SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales.

âTrue,â replied Julio; âthey must be put under
arrest, but not until we see what happens at the tomb.â

âOrder ten policemen to come to the tomb at once.
Say for them to come in disguise and quietly,â said
the Governor.

142
âYou do the proper thing at the proper time always,
Miguey. We must get their entire story, then capture
them. This bloody war they are trying to raise will be
nipped in the bud,â concluded SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales.

âWould it not be well for us to reach the tomb before
them, examine it thoroughly, and be on the eve of leaving
at their arrival?â asked the Governor, of Julio.

âOur best policy, I believe, is to follow them at a
slow pace, and be alighting from the cab as they enter
the tomb. The law is on our side, and if we so desire,
the arrest can be made inside the historic tomb,â
replied Julio Murillo.

âWe will not be connected outwardly with the arrest.
On coming out of the tomb the police must know that
the time to make the arrest has arrived,â replied the
Governor.

âHere is the Mexican Annex, gentlemen,â said Julio
Murillo, looking out of the window, âand our disguised
friends are coming. They are more than a block away
yet. We will move a block to the side to avert suspicion,
from which point we can see them quite as well.â

The cab moved slowly and noiselessly away and soon
disappeared amongst a hundred or more.

The great hotel was filled to overflowing, and the big
crowd of fashionably-dressed people surged back and
forth through the entrances.

Julioâs trained eye scanned every face, and now and
then he uttered low exclamations of surprise. His two
companions asked no questions, but arose from their
seat and remained standing by his side, that they too
might see what was going on around them.

143
âAh, there is J. Ecarg, and Niksab, and Mr. and
Mrs. Grange, out on a dress parade. I wonder if they
are staying in the Mexican Annex now, or are they just
hanging around trying to impress strangers with their
importance,â said the Governor.

âPartly yes, and partly no,â said Julio. âMrs.
Grange has convinced herself by this time that she does
not remember, and has met these men by appointment,
which of course her husband made with them, not to
arouse their suspicions. For had they known that it
was Mrs. Grange who wished to see them, to interview
them on âMemory Fluid,â they never would have met.â

âSee how she tosses her head and smiles at Mr.
Niksab. She has probably heard of his good fortune
and hopes to be presented with another costly frock,â
said SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales. âStrange how susceptible
some men are to such womenâs charms.â

âIt is the town talk to-day how she enchanted the
President. She does not care for peoplesâ tongues,
however. She is, no doubt, out on this dress parade in
the hope of seeing the President again and to make a
further and more lasting impression on him,â said
Julio.

âWho is the short, stout man dressed in grey, coming
out of the hotel now?â asked the Governor.

âI do not recognize him,â said the scientist, Gonzales.

âNo, not in his present guise!â exclaimed Julio, with
a laugh that shook his entire frame. âNo, not in his
present guise. If he were to take off the large grey
beard and grey wig, the difficulty of identification would
be removed.â

144
âWhom would we recognize?â asked the Governor.

ââThe Plunger from Kansas,ââ quietly replied Julio.

âA day so full of conundrums as this has been, I hope
will not fall to my lot again in this life. I am a large,
strong man; the greater part of meâthe objective partâis
human, and I am confident I cannot hold up
under another strain as severe as this one which
began well on to twenty-four hours ago. The arrest of
this man must be made soon, and this great farce being
enacted by the terrible seÃ±orita and her two associates
we have just seen, must be put to an end,â said Governor
Lehumada.

ââThe Plunger from Kansas,ââ quietly remarked
Julio, âwill accompany the trio to whom we have just
been listening, to the tomb. Marriet Motuble knows
who her two companions are, also the disguise of the
âPlunger.â There is no oneâs history she will not ferret
out, no matter how dark and deep the veil is surrounding
them. The step she is now taking is one too
far. She is taking herself and her companions into
the very hands of the law.â

âSure enough, friend Julio, here is the trio; the cab
now coming up to the main entrance is the one they
have employed. It is likewise similar to yours, Miguey,â
said SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales.

âIf upon investigation, I find that that cab is an
infringement upon the patent of mine, the manufacturer
will suffer to the extent of the law,â replied the
Governor, very much annoyed. The strain of the day
and the previous night was telling on him.

âSomething must happen to divert him or a physical

145
collapse will result,â mentally commented Julio, while
aloud he said: âYour Honor, âThe Plunger from Kansasâ
is being invited by the aggressive seÃ±orita to accompany
them to the tomb.â

âI see,â said the Governor. âThey are now entering.
Do not let the cab get from our view, Julio. We must
make a sure thing of it this time. We must put a
stop to this disgraceful farce.â

âTrust me, your Honor. The police will be on hand
when we arrive, but in hiding. And when they hear
the beautiful song of my mechanical bird, they will
rush forth and make the arrest.â

146

CHAPTER XI.

ARREST OF THE CONSPIRATORS.

The cab the four men in disguise were in took a circuitous
route to the necropolis.

Julio directed the motorman to keep far enough away
to avert suspicion, but not to lose sight of it at any cost.
The Governorâs cab was not in a place easily to be seen
by Marriet Motuble and her assistants in the little farce-comedy
they were playing, when they entered their cab,
which stood in front of the Mexican Annex, and while
it only now and then followed directly back of them,
there was one hawk-eye within the cab that saw they
were being followed.

Leo Leander was the occupant of the cab who saw
they were being followed, and knew intuitively that
trouble would result unless some way out of it could
be invented quickly.

âGentlemen,â the aggressive seÃ±orita in disguise said,
âgentlemen, I took the liberty to add another to our
party to visit the ancient tombâa gentleman by birth,
a gentleman by education and social environments; a
student and writer on anthropology, and a devotee to
archÃ¦ology. Friends, it is he you see, the Rev. Isaac
Tombstone, SeÃ±or Enrique Arellano, and Don Jose M.
Martinez.â

147
It was quite evident from the expression on the faces
of the pretenders introduced to Rev. Isaac Tombstone,
that they would rather he were not one of their party.

Leo Leander saw this, and very quickly remarked:
âBrother Tombstone is better informed than any other
man alive on prehistoric Mexico; on the written and
unwritten history of Mexico up to the nineteenth century;
and from that time on he has been an eye-witness
to everything that has taken place upon the soil
known as Mexico in the nineteenth century, and he fully
sympathizes with the descendants of the Latin race who
lost their country, their time-honored customs and religious
stronghold. Gentlemen, the Reverend Tombstone
is true to principle; rely upon him. He will
fight to the finish to help down the present
rÃ©gime
.â

The assertion that the Rev. Isaac Tombstone had
lived through two hundred years, and now sat before
them a well preserved man, apparently not over sixty
years old, in full possession of all his senses, was the
only thing in the statements of Leo Leander which
seemed incredulous to the listeners. However, they
congratulated the Reverend Tombstone on being so
hale and hearty at his great age and said they were delighted
that he had joined their party, and hoped in the
near future that they would become staunch friends.
Leo Leander was delighted at the effect his words had
created, and smiled serenely to himself as he watched
the maneuvers of the Governorâs cab.

He was leading them a lively chase. So lively, in
fact, that the motorman of the Governorâs cab often was
undecided just which way to turn.

148
âWe are discovered,â said Julio; âthe aggressive
seÃ±orita knows she is being followed, and it will take
more than the quick eye of a hawk to keep her from
eluding the law.â

âHer cab certainly is not capable of swifter movement
than ours,â said the Governor. âI do not think it possible
for them to escape us.â

âWe will not lose sight of the cab entirely,â said
Julio, âyet it is likely to lose one of its occupants on
the way without our knowledge.â

SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales did not make any comment,
but gazed with much interest upon the remarkable
panorama before him.

âWe certainly are not going directly to the city of
the dead,â said the Governor.

âIn most every other way but the direct road to the
necropolis, we are going. The fact is, your Honor, the
person in yonder cab disguised as Leo Leander suspects
us of following them, and is going to ascertain if such
be the fact by this method,â concluded Julio.

In the meantime Leo Leander was formulating a plan
for escape, while the Rev. Isaac Tombstone discoursed
upon various topics with the other two occupants of
the cab. He played his part well, to the great delight
of Leo Leander, who had no idea that the man
had the learning he now displayed.

âYes,â he said, in answer to a question propounded
by SeÃ±or Enrique Arellano, âI am certainly grateful to
the Father Divine who saw fit to let me live throughout
two centuries and more, and retain complete use of
my senses, and yet am in feeling a gay, healthy young
man as well.â

149
âUpon what ground do you base your information
concerning prehistoric Mexico?â asked SeÃ±or Jose M.
Martinez.

âUpon the fact that all light since the beginning of
time has come to man from the East. Knowing such
to be the case, early in the nineteenth century, then a
young man eager for knowledge, I journeyed to Calcutta,
and from thence to the remotest of the Himalayas,
where I studied with the most learned of the Hindoos.
They taught me from charts, maps and sign-writings,
that centuries before, a people had gone from Persia
and settled along the west and southwest coast-line of
Mexico. But this new country was like the âVale of
Siddim, full of lime-pits,â and the leaders of this tribe
fell to fighting amongst themselves, after having
founded large cities. Excavating amongst the ruins of
their once great and populous cities, I discovered they
had made great progress in science, art and literature.
Those of the Persian tribe left, fled to the mountains
and valleys of the interior, where they show evidence of
having united with different races, by whom they were
afterwards extinguished. These facts, friends, are of
profound interest ethnologically,â concluded the learned
doctor of divinity.

âTo be sure, to be sure,â repeated Don Enrique Arellano.
âWhat a wonderful fund of knowledge you have,
Reverend Tombstone. Some day not far distant I hope
to have you at my house as a guest, when dear Mexico
is restored to us again and we are happy.â

âAnd my guest as well, when that good time comes,â
joined in SeÃ±or Martinez; while Reverend Tombstone

150
mentally added: âThen I will never be your guests,
gentlemen. Ah, but this is a great comedy some others
besides myself are helping to play. These two men are
a puzzle to me, as well as Leo Leander. I was afraid
not to accompany him because he pierced my disguise.
He said: âYou are âThe Plunger from Kansas.â Walk
right up, young man, and take your medicine. I need
your help in the little farce I am playing, and woe is
your name, if you betray me.â Well, I walked up, and
here I am taking my medicine. Such seems to be life
in this the twenty-first century. I pulled through two
other lives without getting behind the bars, and they will
have a lively chase if they overtake and arrest me in this
life, âMemory Fluidâ or no memory fluid, notwithstanding
the great advance there has been since my previous
life, in scientific investigations. Well, what is going to
happen now? The cab is stopping.â Then aloud he
asked: âThe cab stops; is this the city of the dead?â

âNo, your Reverence,â said Leo Leander, âthis is not
the necropolis. However, I will leave you here and join
you in a few moments at the Motuble tomb. Here is
the key to the tomb, SeÃ±or Jose Martinez. It admits
you to the tomb with one turn. If I am not there on
your arrival, enter at onceâdo not wait for meâand
gaze upon the placid features of Marriet Motuble seen
through the glass on her metallic coffin. Gaze upon
her and envy her brave act, but pity those of us left
without her benevolent heart and sweet influence. Gaze
upon her, friend, and do not wait for me. I may overtake
you, however. Good-bye; good-bye for a short
time,â he concluded, as the cab came to a standstill
and Leo Leander stepped from the carriage.

151
Almost instantly the cab with its three occupants
bound for the city of the dead moved rapidly on, and
Leo Leander disappeared from sight.

âHow unfortunate for us that Mr. Leander felt duty
bound to leave us at a time so propitious for seeing the
ancient tomb,â said SeÃ±or Martinez.

âIt is unfortunate for us,â calmly replied Rev. Isaac
Tombstone; âalthough the bad fortune does not fall
upon us alone.â

âHow is that, friend?â asked Don Enrique Arellano.

âHe was in good company, I mean,â smiled the
preacher; âin very learned company, and with old
friends; or I would better say, with those whom I hope
some day to be classed as old friends. Heigh-ho, here
comes a physicianâs cab at breakneck speed,â concluded
Rev. Isaac Tombstone.

âSome one is very ill, no doubt,â said SeÃ±or Martinez.
âI wonder who the patient is, that causes the
physicianâs cab to travel so swiftly. There are three of
us, witnesses to the fast travelling through a crowded
thoroughfare. See the people falling over each other
nearly, to get away from the path of the cab.â

âA fair example of the present rule of things,â said
Don Enrique Arellano.

âBut I believe, my friend,â said Rev. Isaac Tombstone,
âthat exceptions to the law are made, in cases
of physicians going on missions of mercy.â

âHow can anyone say that such is the case now?â
asked SeÃ±or Martinez.

âNot I, for one,â replied Don Arellano.

âNor I,â added the preacher.

152
âOne cab is certainly chasing the other now. We
must prevent it; such doings are not lawful. We must
prevent it. We must prevent it,â cried SeÃ±or Martinez,
rising to his feet and calling loudly to the motorman.
If he heard the cries of âStop, Stop,â he paid
no attention. The cab fairly flew through the streets,
and before anyone was aware of the fact, they had arrived
at the cemetery gate just behind the cab the motorman
had been trying to overtake.

Rev. Isaac Tombstone was not less surprised than his
companions to see the other cab stop at the Motuble
tomb.

The three men alighted first, however. Mr. Martinez
unlocked the tomb and they entered, leaving the door
wide open. The tomb was in the form of an octagon
at the base, the diameter being twenty feet; from the
center of the base to the highest point of dome measured
one hundred feet. The interior was of highly polished
marble, in which were set large mirrors. The small
coffin in which rested the body of Catalina Martinet
stood in the center of the tomb on two marble pillars.
A silence fell upon the three as they read in bright gold
letters on the casket, âCatalina Martinet, age sixteen.
Died of a broken heart.â

âBy the gods, I will have revenge upon the man who
caused her illegal birth to be, and her untimely death
to come. Marriet Motuble. Her Friend through all
eternity.â

âShe is dead, but lives,â solemnly said Reverend
Tombstone. âShe is dead, but lives.â

âImpossible,â angrily replied Don Arellano. âImpossible.â

153
Without making any reply the Reverend Tombstone
stepped to the large casket recently placed in the tomb,
and said, looking in the glass face plate: âThe classic
features of Marriet Motuble! She whom I knew in a
life long since past lies before me.â

âDon Arellano,â cried SeÃ±or Martinez, âwe have been
deceived. This man is a believer in that accursed
âMemory Fluid.â The sooner we get away, from this
tomb, back to the city, the better for us.â

They each glanced nervously at the waxen face before
them, and without further comment started hastily to
leave the tomb.

Rev. Isaac Tombstone made no sign that he heard
them, but stood by the head of the metallic coffin, his
eyes riveted upon the face he there saw.

As his two companions left the tomb, three men
dressed as doctors of medicine entered, and stood with
uncovered heads around the coffin. The cab in which
the Reverend Tombstone and party had arrived stood
in front of the door of the tomb.

At the moment the two men were stepping into it
three policemen stepped forward, as the song of a bird
rent the air, clapped iron bands around their wrists,
and said: âYou are prisoners of law. Make no disturbance
or you will be roughly dealt with.â

SeÃ±or Martinez threw his head back haughtily, and
asked: âDoes the present
rÃ©gime
permit the arrest of
quiet, law-abiding citizens?â

âCertainly not, certainly not,â replied the officer.
âIt is not becoming to your present disguise for you to
ask such a question.â

154
Attracted by the noise outside, Rev. Isaac Tombstone
walked to the door of the tomb to see the cause of the
disturbance.

Julio Murillo followed him and said, addressing the
officer of the law: âBring the prisoners here, into the
Motuble tomb.â

His orders were instantly obeyed. It was an opportune
moment for Rev. Isaac Tombstone, so he
thought. He stepped aside to allow the law and its trespassers
to pass into the tomb. And as he bowed in a
very dignified manner to them, mentally exclaimed:
âNow is my time!â and ran to the end of the tomb,
jerking off his false wig and beard and his spectacles as
he went. He turned his coat inside out, either side
made to wear outside, lit a cigar, and before anyone was
conscious he had left his place by the door of the tomb,
his disguise was completely changed, and at a bound
he was in the cab.

At that moment the song of the bird was again heard,
and the officers of the law rushed out to make another
arrest, but the cab was fairly flying away from them,
and they cried: âIt is too late; the bird has flown.
We must have one more chance at the fellow.â

âWere it not necessary to examine the contents of
this metallic coffin,â said Julio, âwhich is supposed to
contain the remains of one Marriet Motuble, we would
pursue this man in the physicianâs cab.â

âOne of my men,â said the captain of the force
present, âcan follow on my air cycle, get assistance,
and make the arrest in the city.â

âThat is a splendid idea,â said the Governor; âa

155
splendid idea. This man is too valuable to science to
be allowed to escape. His capture and open confession
is the only thing necessary for us to have to convince
the entire world of the truth of our wonderful discovery,
âMemory Fluid.ââ

âWhat do you, a common physician of the State,
know of âMemory Fluid,â that fake discovery of the
Governorâs and his scientific friends?â asked SeÃ±or Martinez,
in a highly sarcastic tone.

To whom SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales replied: âWe
are not here to discuss what his Honor knows about
âMemory Fluid,â but to fully examine the corpse in this
box. Stand close by, friends. I will make the first
incision.â

Aghast with horror, the two prisoners and the remaining
officers of law stepped back.

With an instrument that seemed to be made especially
for the purpose, Julio Murillo removed the glass plate
from the coffin.

As he passed his hand over the face of the object
before him, he smiled to himself and the two men
shivered.

âNow, my friend,â he said to Guillermo Gonzales,
ânow is your time.â

Unflinchingly the scientist pressed the sharp edge of
the large knife against the waxen-like neck of the object
before him with the result he expected. Instead
of dissecting a corpse, Julio cut into a wooden model
over which was a thin coating of wax.

âSee,â he said to the Governor, âsee; the prophecy
of Julio is true. The aggressive seÃ±orita is surely not
in the Motuble tomb.â

156
âNor for that matter,â said the Governor, âin any
other tomb. I am fully convinced, and the law must
take its course immediately. A model of wax only occupies
the Motuble tomb.â

SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales fastened the glass plate
securely on; the policemen led their prisoners out of
the tomb; the Governor and SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales
followed, and Julio Murillo locked the tomb securely
and placed the key in his pocket. As an extra assurance
that no one could enter the tomb and carry away
the proof of Marriet Motubleâs dual action, the Governor
ordered two extra policemen, who had arrived in
the cab ordered for the prisoners, to guard the tomb,
and under no circumstances to let anyone enter.

Strange to say, SeÃ±or Jose M. Martinez and Don
Enrique Arellano entered the policemanâs cab without
any protest whatever, and at a rapid rate were taken to
the central police court when their disguises were at
once removed, and their names were entered as follows:
Jesus Marie Hernandez, occupation a priest, alias Don
Enrique Arellano; Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, occupation
a gentleman, alias Jose M. Martinez. After the
above registration was completed, they were placed in
separate cells and left to their own reflections.

The Governor and his two companions were quickly
taken to his own private home, where they soon learned
that many callers had been there during his absence, and
several left, very angry, because he was not to be seen.

The President had sent to the Governor, a few minutes
before they arrived, a large envelope which contained
many sheets of paper closely written.

157
The three men took supper together, and over their
meal discussed their experiences of the day, and at
its close went straight to the Governorâs private study
to read the Presidentâs statement. The Governor
handed the envelope to Julio, who opened it carefully
and read as follows:

â
Friends and Comrades
: A wonderful change has
come over me within the last eight hours. A change
so delicious that no one but he who has experienced
the same feeling can begin to understand it. It is the
knowledge that comes to one of a previous existence.

âTo be plain, my friends, I
remember
, thanks to
your wonderful âMemory Fluid.â

âI was in this city one hundred and fifty years ago,
in the employ of the United States Secret Service. I
arrested, by the assistance of a little girlâCatalina
Martinetâa counterfeiter who had evaded the law for
years, all the while living in the Republic of Mexico
in the guise of a mining man.

âThat arrest was a big feather in my cap. I was
promoted and my salary raised largely.

âI wish to thank you, my friends, for the great service
you have done me by bringing to my notice this
wonderful discoveryâthe
most
wonderful scientific discovery
of this or any other age. I could write on and
on and on, telling you about what I remember, but it
is of no use to burden you with so much reading.

âI will now return to my apartments at the Mexican
Annex, at which place I hope to see you privately before

158
I leave the city, which will be at twelve oâclock
to-night.

âYours fraternally and faithfully,

â
Joseph Mortingo
.â

âHe leaves to-night, at twelve. Ah, he returns to
the capital; his plans are changed since morning. I
will go immediately; you will accompany me, friends,
I hope,â said the Governor.

âWith much pleasure; we will make our toilet at
once,â said SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales, speaking for
himself and Julio Murillo.

âI will in the meantime,â said the Governor, âspeak
to him. I will say we will be there in half an hour.â

In a very short space of time the three scientists
were on their way to the Mexican Annex. The hour
was ten
P.M.
, yet people seemed to be assembling there
from all quarters of the city.

Several times before reaching the hostelry the three
scientists heard angry cries as they passed through the
streets.

The Governor thought nothing of the matter until
he was leaving his cab to enter the hotel, when an angry
crowd cried: âThere is the traitor! Kill him!
Kill him!â

Many blows were aimed at the Governor, but were
warded off by the timely arrival of the soldiers and
police.

âCome, Miguey, come. Enter by this private entrance.
This mad crowd is likely to make an end of
all of us if we do not get out of sight,â said SeÃ±or

159
Guillermo Gonzales, as he hurried the Governor into
the hotel.

âThe uprising has begun,â said Julio, âand earlier
than I expected. You gentlemen go at once to the
Presidentâs rooms. I will see what news can be learned
in the rotunda. It is my opinion that the President
should be sent to the station to-night under heavy
military guard. He must get out of Chihuahua in disguise,
and to-night at that. If I am not mistaken, we
have an ugly affair on our hands. This is no place
to talk. I will go in search of the latest news.â He
hurried away amongst the surging crowd, while the
Governor and Guillermo Gonzales were shown to the
Presidentâs rooms.

âThis is a terrible state of affairs,â said the President,
as he greeted them on entering.

âThe instigators of the uprising,â quietly spoke the
Governor, âare behind the bars, and when their sympathizers
learn the fact, it will put an end to the unlawful
doings of the rabble.â

âMy life has been threatened three times since my
arrival at the hotel. And see, gentlemen, the cipher
despatches I have received from the Capital.â

SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales took the despatches from
the hands of the President, looked them over curiously,
and said: âHas the news of this affair reached
Washington?â

âIt has more than reached the city. A fearfully
large following has not only been raised there, but in the
metropolis and capital of every State in the Union.
Unless the militia and police force can quell the disturbers

160
in a few days, much trouble will follow,â said
President Mortingo.

The Governor extinguished the light in the room,
and stepping to a window, said: âSee the mob in the
street! What is it they are crying?â

Above the sounds of the mob, a voice cried: âThat
is his room; they are all there. Shoot the pretenders
down without a word!â

At that moment Julio Murillo entered the room
quietly, and going close to the two near the window,
said: âHis Excellency must be taken from the hotel
immediately; there is no time for delay.â

âBut his life is in danger, if he be seen,â said the
Governor.

âTo be sure,â calmly replied Julio; âbut not any
more than your own.â

âThey intend to harm every one who is a believer in
âMemory Fluid,ââ said SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales.

âThere is no time to be lost, gentlemen,â said Julio.
âI have disguises here for his Excellency and your
Honor. Friend Gonzales and myself will be lost in
the crowd.â

The two men of national repute disguised themselves
with the various articles Julio brought with him, left
the room unobserved by anyone but the soldiers guarding
the room, and were soon safely quartered with
those of the Presidentâs party who had not left the city
that morning in a palace car ready to be hurried away
to Washington.

The Governor and his two scientific friends returned
to his residence, but could only get within one block
of it in the cab, for the rabble and soldiers.

161
They left the cab and mingled with the crowd, and
soon were safely in the house by a private entrance.

In a sense they were safe; but how long safety would
last they could not say. All night the Governor and
his two scientific friends in company with many high
officials of State, discussed the present state of affairs
and laid plans for immediate action should further
trouble come.

The President had promised that United States troops
would arrive at the shortest notice possible and put an
end to the uprising if the State troops were insufficient.

162

CHAPTER XII.

A LIFE SAVED.

There never had been such excitement in Chihuahua
as that caused by the arrests of Don Francisco R. Cantu
y Falomir, and Father Hernandez.

Not even the execution of Hidalgo, the good priest
who sought to free the people of Mexico from the terrible
slavery in which the church held them, created
the same fervor. The mad rabble and the church
fanatics were too ignorant to realize the awfulness of
their deed. They believed what they had been told by
the church, that whoever advocated freedom of thought
must die. And few were the tears shed when, in the
year of 1810, the life of the great and noble Father
Hidalgo was taken in Chihuahua. At least, it was the
few who shed tears.

Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir had been known
as a quiet, law-abiding citizen, very wealthy and eccentric.
It was generally known that he prided himself
upon the fact of his blue Mexican blood, and persisted
in signing Falomir, his motherâs maiden name,
to his own surname, as was the custom in Mexico up
to the close of the nineteenth century. Yet no one ever
dreamed that he nursed any ill-will against the law of

163
the land of his birthâagainst the United States of
America.

Everyone seemed to think that he had a right to his
peculiarities, and while Chihuahuans smiled when the
name Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir was spoken
they were always ready to point out this wealthy, aristocratic
and eccentric citizen to visitors in Chihuahua
and obtain an introduction to him for them, if possible.

It was not strange that the citizens of Chihuahua
wondered that their fellow-citizen, thought to be quiet
and law-abiding, and the priest, well known in the city
for his many charitable deeds, were behind the bars on
a charge of treason.

The calm of the early morning, produced by reading
the full account of the charges and the arrest of these
two well-known citizens, in the great
Chihuahuan
,
was now giving way to noisy discussions of them, by
small and large crowds of citizens of all classes, assembled
on the street corners, and in public and private
houses. At nine oâclock the jail in which the two
offenders of law were held was almost surrounded by
what looked to be the rabble of the entire country.

The great and progressive city of Chihuahua had
never had such a large crowd of ungainly and suspicious
looking creatures assemble since it became a
part of the great Republic of the United States of
America. From whence had they come and for what
purpose? were the questions propounded on every side
by the uninitiated.

At first no particular attention was paid to the miserable
looking beings hanging around the jail. But as

164
their number increased so rapidly, although they seldom
spoke and made no disturbance, the number of
police usually on beat near the jail was doubled, and a
company of one hundred soldiers were stationed close
by.

The rabble questioned no one, and no one questioned
the rabble.

The police and soldiers kept their eyes riveted upon
them, but as they only
looked
suspicious, and did
nothing, they were allowed to remain and no arrests
were made.

Such were the orders received from the Governor,
and no officer cared to disobey them. During the forenoon
several priests and friends of Don Francisco R.
Cantu y Falomir came to the jail and begged for admittance.
Each person was refused and went away
angry. Some of them openly vowed vengeance.

One priest ventured to return, and asked the guard
why his friends were confined in jail, and if an early
hearing would be granted them. Unable to get any
satisfactory answers, he turned away, his white face
showing the terrible rage he was in.

The Governor and his scientific coworkers had not
been seen on the street during the day, and as night
approached and no official word could be had as to the
probable fate of the prisoners, the rabble around and
near the jail showed signs of great uneasiness, and in
bodies of threes and fours wandered away. As each
party left it was quietly followed by an officer, who
thought himself in a condition impossible to be surprised,
no matter how unusual an occurrence which
would happen might be.

165
However, his thoughts in that direction were wholly
in error, as what occurred will demonstrate.

As the sun sank behind a tall peak of the Sierra
Madre, and a still darkness crept over the beautiful
scene, and hid it from admiring eyes, the strange
crowd that had wandered off in small numbers from the
jail now collected themselves in a large, empty storage
room in the southwestern part of the city, a distance of
about four miles from the Mexican Annex, and the
Governorâs residence. Before nine oâclock it was filled
to overflowing, and still ragged, dirty creatures full of
disease kept on coming from every direction. From
the stillness of everyone the meeting and its object
evidently was meant to be kept a secret, at least for a
season.

When it was seen that not another person could find
standing room in the large wareroom, the door was
securely fastened; a dim light was turned on, and a
tall, raw-boned looking man stepped on top of a high
drygoods box, and said:

âFriends and Countrymen: It is with a sad heart
I stand upon this platform and look out upon the many
hundred faces before me, faces that show the ravages of
disease, the pangs of hunger, and the
no-hope
expression
of those who have been downtrodden; neglected,
mentally, morally and spiritually, on account of peculiar
environments. It is with a sad heart I see you
thus before me and join you in your silent prayer for
deliverance. For deliverance! Does not that word
partake of Divinity? Does it not seem to bring you
closer to the great Giver of Justice? Does there not

166
seem to be a start toward the adjustment of all evil?
Cannot you who have despaired of hope, see the light
of the Divine, the expression that comes from a superior
knowledge, upon my face? I am your deliverer.
By the help of all influence Divine, I will see that justice
is meted out to you. Away back in that life known
only to myself when I was a fat, freckled-faced, barefooted
boy of ten, building mud houses and paddling
in the rippling streams, I saw strange things and
heard strange voices. One day while sitting on a
large moss-covered bowlder in the clear waters of a
placid, cool and shallow stream, I had a vision. I saw
the words, âYou must be the deliverer of the oppressed
and downtrodden in Chihuahua in this year, the year
of our Lord 2049,â written in letters of fire, out over
the water. I was frightened, and started to run, when
a voice said to me: âStop; look and fear not.â I took
my seat upon the highest point of the bowlder and
riveted my eyes upon the spot over the water where I
had seen the letters of fire. Very soon I saw a large,
magnificently built city. I saw it grow and grow until
it became unparalleled, for grandeur, and for the
number of advanced-thought people. I saw the glory
and power of one rise, while others sank lower and
lower into the very depths of poverty, disease and
ignorance. I saw a coterie of blue-blooded people,
educated and wealthy, arise like guardian angels in the
night and go forth to defend the oppressed; to take
from his throne of power, the pretender; one of their
own royal blood who had betrayed the confidence imposed
in him, and now sought by the arts of a magician

167
to make the people believe that he had made wonderful
progress in scientific discoveries. I saw the two noble
defenders of the downtrodden thrust into jail! I saw
a small army of believers in the two defenders of noble
birth, start out confidently to overthrow the government;
to try to sever that part of the United States of
America once known as the Republic of Mexico, from
the Union to which it sent a petition less than one hundred
and fifty years ago, asking for annexation, which
was in due time granted.â

âYes,â piped out the voice of an infirm old man,
âwe want our Mexico back; we want our priests restored.
Them was good old days, and we want them
back.â

âWe will make war against all these high notions of
scientists, who, the priests say, are leading the people
to hades,â ventured another old man, bent with age and
infirmities.

âThe Church ainât much power, but it still has many
followers, and all of us can fight for it,â continued the
old man.

The revolutionary sentiments expressed began to
show effect upon the crowd. They moved about uneasily,
and low curses and threats were being voiced
on every side.

The speaker again began to talk and the noise subsided
somewhat.

âYes,â he said; âI saw ourselves plunged into an
internal war. It was carried on between all adherents
to the dogmas of the orthodox on one side, and advocators
of free thought on the other side. And my

168
vision ended, with part of this nation fighting the other.
The assembly no doubt thinks that thoughts as expressed
by some of your would-be learned men are
too free.â This remark elicited a great applause, and
the speaker, after mentally congratulating himself upon
the impression he had made, continued: âEveryone
knows to whom I refer particularly.â A hushed silence
followed this remark. âI refer particularly to the
Governor of this great State, the man who claims to
have discovered a fluid directly from the sunâs rays,
which will perpetuate memory throughout all time.
The main purpose for which this fluid is intended, is
to aid officers of law in securing evidence against all
who have committed crimes, and to bring such people
to justice. Study upon this feature of the case,
friends. Imagine yourself being compelled to believe
in such stuff. That is what constitutes part of the
doctrine of Free Thought. You must be a scientist to
advocate free thought as they wish it. It tramples
down all the idols which you have bowed to for centuries.
The faith of your fathers must be superseded
by facts obtained from scientific investigations. You
must believe that memory can be restored and preserved
through ages; that the annihilation of diseased
matter can be accomplished by means of âEbony Fluid.â
That all miraculous deeds of the Christ of Bible fame
can be done to-day, not only by one, but by many; all
of whom, however, must be initiated. Well, friends, I
have been talking thirty minutes. You have my sentiments;
think, think, think! Never act without studying
over the past results of just such action you are on

169
the eve of taking. Remember the condition of the
times. You will fight against many odds. It will be
ten against one. But do not be discouraged; bear in
mind that a handful of men and women who desired
to practice their religion according to the dictates of
their own conscience severed themselves from England,
their mother country, with much bloodshed; with
much bloodshed, it is true, yet they gained the object
for which they foughtâtheir freedomâand hence the
right to serve God as pleased their fancy. I will not
suggest what step for you to take, but if you will tell
me your plan, I will lead you to success.â

This time the high notes of a voice which showed
training in public speaking, arose up from the great
crowd, and startled everyone by exclaiming: âI, the
Rev. J. T. Note, do this moment declare that there is
but one way to adjust matters as they now stand;âto
rectify the great injustices done to the followers of the
orthodox, to those who believe in and follow the precepts
of the inspired works of biblical writers. I say
there is but one way to recover our waning power and
that is, to fight for right.â

Hurrah after hurrah went up. The crowd grew less
and less under self-control.

The minister continued: âDo not delay; make the
first strike to-night. Listen,â he cried in hushed tones.
â
Listen!
I will assist yon noble speaker to lead you
to the frontâto face the foe in battle.â

At the conclusion of his speech, and before another
word could be spoken by anyone else present, the lights
in the room went out and the mad cries of the audience
went up in protest.

170
A strong breeze, which could only come through an
open door or window, swept through the room.

It needed no voice to tell that trouble was at hand,
but not the kind they had been talking about trying
to create. Quick orders were given by some one in
authority, in a low voice, and responded to by others
in curses. Everybody tried to get to the door and into
the street.

In less than ten minutes after the lights went out,
the large room seemed to be empty; but it was not
quite emptyâthere was one person left and he was the
speaker of the evening. The night was intensely dark,
and the large crowd got as near together as possible,
and planned for a night of carnage. Until one oâclock
they remained quiet, except for planning.

By some one the Rev. J. T. Note was missed; but
no one felt alarmed, for those who missed him thought
he was somewhere amongst the crowd, helping to carry
out their proposed plan of attack. Now that the hour
had arrived that they had agreed upon to attempt to
take the life of the Governor and his two scientific
friends, a company of three hundred men, led by the
old man with the piping voice, cautiously wended their
way in that direction. Others started in various directions
to carry out their nefarious ideas.

The tall, raw-boned person remained, almost breathless,
in his crouched position on the floor back of a
big empty box, until thoroughly satisfied that no interloper,
or friend, as for that, was in the room. Cautiously
walking to the back door, the position of which
he must have been well informed, he opened it noiselessly

171
and quietly stepped out into the dark night.
For five minutes more he strode back and forth, his
thumbs securely thrust into the band of his trousers,
in deep meditation, now and then chuckling to himself.

âLet me see,â he said aloud as he suddenly came to
a stop, âlet me see. It is now fifteen minutes after
one oâclock. Whew! What did Helen Hinckley think
when I failed to meet her at the appointed place and
time. The result of the meeting just closed was the
most unexpected event of my life. It is all day with
these would-be revolutionists if the city police and state
militia are onto this meeting. It is all up with you,
Reverend Note, I am quite sure. Chihuahuaâs police
force took charge of you, Iâll bet a copper. You are
languishing in a small cell, behind the iron bars, as a
nineteenth century romance writer would say, on a
charge of treason. It will go hard with these three
transgressors of law. It is a strange affair, and I have
done my best to help both sides accomplish what they
are out for. Ha! ha! It is a great world, and Free
Thought, based upon scientific reasoning, is sure to
win. As sure as fate. The poor deluded creatures
here to-night have my sympathies, and also had my
assistance to-night. I did all within my power to make
the fire of revenge burn bright within their bosom.
Some people may say I am a hypocrite. Well, I am
in a way; but when one can make others happy by
practising a little deception, the wrong cannot be lasting.
And what if it is, what if it is? The beautiful
creature who has so completely captivated the bachelor
heart of the Governor, was disappointed, no doubt, by

172
not finding me at my apartment at the Annex, at ten
oâclock. But not so disappointed, I fancy, as when
she reads in to-morrow morningâs
Chihuahuan
, an account
of the murder of the Governor, whose love, I
imagine, she reciprocates; and of Don Guillermo Gonzales,
and of Julio Murillo, the son of SeÃ±ora Suzzan
Carriles, of Colima, as well. âMemory Fluidâ will
go over the board, if that wholesale slaughter is effected.
Their great test case will be laid over for another incarnation.
âThe Plunger from Kansasâ will have one
more chance for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,
without living in mortal fear of being dragged
up before the bar of civil justice and politely requested
to make amends for a deed done in the body in at least
two existences past. Yes, poor fellow, he will have a
little rest and peace of mind; for there is no one who
will concern himself about presenting to the world
proofs of the results obtained by the use of their great
discovery. Helen Hinckley will pine away, and the
grave will claim her for another victim before the
summer is over. Their spirits will voice a desire to
enter again into a physical condition immediately, and
before twenty years of their new life has passed away,
those two hearts that this moment beat as one, soon to
be so ruthlessly severed, will be united forever and forever,
and as they glide along and form one of the
many scenes in lifeâs grand panorama, they will cause,
by their subtle philosophy, the âPlunger from Kansasâ
to adjust the wrong they are now trying to right. Ha!
ha! ha! Really I must move on, and cease my
early morning soliloquy. I really believe I am getting

173
to be a prophet. Certainly I have been talking
aloud. In the nineteenth century, when one fell into
the habit of talking aloud to oneâs self he was said to
be loco; but no such a fear need be entertained now,
for this is the age of scientific revelation. No one can
accuse the other, for every queer action is attributed to
his knowledge of science. And either everyone is a
student of scienceâof course that science which pertains
to the soul of man, particularlyâor everyone is
loco or crazy. Adios, all ye demons of darkness, soon
to be superseded by the angels of light, adios. I certainly
hope the messages you bring will be such that
my sad heart will be avenged. Now, with feet as fleet
as the wild goat that once roamed the mountains over,
I will reach the Mexican Annex, quietly steal into my
apartments, quickly conceal all of my disguise, and to-morrow
no one will be any the wiser for my nightâs
escapade. Ha! ha! no doubt, that on in the day while
the revolutionists are playing havoc in the great, progressive
city, I will be shedding tears, mingling mine
with those of the Plunger of Kansas over the biers of
our lately departed friends. Only friend Julio will I
grieve for the loss of. Poor SeÃ±ora Suzzan Carriles,
of Colima, had no idea when she and Father Hernandez,
now languishing in jail, committed the crime of
adultery in a former existence that their progeny
would rise up nearly two centuries afterwards and
make them repent of their folly. Ha! ha! Ye vigils
of darkness, I am gone!â

The person who had just concluded the lengthy
soliloquy, passed away, without further delay or comment,
in the direction of the Mexican Annex.

174
Near by stood unseen, Helen Hinckley, who had
heard with bated breath every word of the soliloquy.
âThe person,â she cried with smothered voice, âcannot
be other than the friend of my other life. The voice
I recognize as that of Marriet Motuble. Strange
creature! She whom I grieved for as dead, until her
note reached me at nine oâclock to-night, and gave
satisfactory explanations, is here plotting against the
great and noble Governor and his able coworkers.
Oh, thou annihilator of evil, bear me witness to the
doings of this strange woman. I will warn him for
whom I have looked through two lives. He shall be
preserved, and when his true state is confessed to me
in words, I will unite my life to his, and then what
should have come to pass two hundred years ago will
take place now. There is no worry in my soul, for the
righting of all wrongs is certain to come to pass.â

As swift as the wings of a bird could waft itself
through space, she glided through the still, cool air of
the early morning, at a distance of twelve inches from
the ground, to the Governorâs home. By means of her
own great psychic power she conveyed to him even in
his deep sleep the knowledge of her coming, and where
to admit her; at a door opening out upon a balcony on
the second floor, to the rear of his home.

She was dressed in a close-fitting black dress and hat,
so that in the intense darkness of the night she was
not observed.

When the Governor first received the mental message
stating her intention of visiting him on important
business, his body shook with a great emotion, and his

175
heart beat wildly with joy at the prospect of seeing
and talking with the object of his heartâs desire.

But when he reached the door she expected to enter,
and stood ready to open it for her, he was again a
man of reason, and an overwhelming love for the spiritual
woman had taken the place of his baser love.

He held the door slightly open, and eagerly gazed
into the darkness he could not pierce.

He felt a strange vibrating of the air, and then a
presence which glided over the balcony and into the
room and sank into a heap at his feet.

He caused the room to be instantly lighted, and
stooping, raised the prostrate figure at his feet.

âA little water, if you please,â she said. âI could
not compute the height, so the flight was a little hard
for me.â

The Governor handed her a glass of cool water, and
said: âI am sorry your solicitude for my safety has cost
you such a great physical effort.â

âNo, no, no; do not mind. It would not have happened
could I have seen the house and computed the
distance from the ground to this door. Do not be in
the least concerned about me, your Honor. The law
is apparent, but I had nothing on which I could base
my calculations,â said Miss Hinckley.

âI do not understand,â said the great Governor and
great discoverer of âMemory Fluid,â âhow you came in
this door directly from the street without any visible
means of ascending to this height?â

âIs it possible, your Honor, that you forget when
you and I in that life gone by, hoped we might be able
to overcome the law of gravitation so far as our own

176
bodies were concerned, as well as to discover a means
by which we could perpetuate memory?â

âI certainly recall our meditations along those lines,
but I have made no investigations along the line of
the former,â replied the Governor.

âBut I have,â said his fair listener, âand while you
were perfecting your wonderful âMemory Fluidââand
other liquids obtained from the source of all light,
and which may prove to be equally as great scientific
revealers to manâI have been delving in the realms of
the hidden and praying for light. It came, and oh,
glorious was the day when I felt myself lifted up a
few inches from the ground and gliding along as easily
as a bird on the wing!â

âHow astonishing, how wonderful! You must at
once become a Fellow in our Royal Academy for Scientific
Investigations. Your discovery is the most remarkable
in the history of man. You will do me the
honor, I hope, to first explain the
modus operandi
. My
soul yearns for knowledge of Nature, of God,â cried
the great man of science, his voice full of emotion.

âMy hand, your Honor. Depend upon it, that the
limited knowledge I have shall be conveyed to you at
the earliest moment possible. The man who is so well
in tune with the Great Light, the Source of All, will
comprehend the subject in a moment,â said Helen
Hinckley.

The Governor pressed her firm brown hand between
his two, and lifting his eyes to the invisible Ruler of the
universe, said: âThe blending of two harmonious
lives, oh, Thou Great and Everlasting Cause; this
seems to me to be the fulfillment of Thy desire.â

177

CHAPTER XIII.

THE PEACE OF THE SOUL.

Helen Hinckley raised her beautiful face, shining
with a light divine, and said: âIt is the fulfillment,
your Honor. It is the peace of the soul that âpasseth
all understanding.ââ

At that moment the Governor dropped her hands;
extinguished the light in the room, opened the door a
little wider, and strained his ear to catch the unusual
sound that came in from the street below.

Helen Hinckley knew at once the meaning of the
sound, and said: âI must not delay longer telling you
the object of my call.â

As these two people (whose souls had sought each
other through two other lives and failed utterly to
find the other, from the simple fact that their material
environments were such that their very souls had no
power to break through the terrible prison house in
which they seemed to be encased, and fly to the arms of
its counterpart) stood in the dark doorway, Helen
Hinckley told the Governor all that had happened between
herself and Marriet Motuble.

It was the dearest moment of his life when he felt
her warm breath upon his cheek, while she whispered
the story in his ear.

178
âA strange creature, that Marriet Motuble; a
very strange creature,â he whispered in reply.

âShe is more daring now than in the other life. She
is a woman to be avoided. When one is so constituted
that the association with a person harms him, instead
of doing him good, the best plan is to keep at a respectable
distance, and do the person all the good possible
from that distance. But hark! What is that?â
she concluded, as she clutched the Governorâs arm in
her fright.

They stepped out on the small balcony and both listened
breathlessly.

The Governor replied: âIt was the report of a gun.
Ah, there is another, and another. Hark! the police
are after them.â

âThe Executive Mansion is well guarded by the soldiers.

I
do not believe that they will be able to enter
the house. The unguarded moment is the dangerous
time, your Honor,â said Helen Hinckley, as she
stepped into the room and gently led the Governor with
her.

âOn the subject of guarding my house,â replied his
Honor, âI gave strict orders that no extras should guard
me or be placed around my property. It is my duty, as
the official head of this great State, to protect the lives
and property of private citizens. The officers of the
law will do their duty if there be an uprising, which
I can hardly believe will take place. I am not a
coward. I will not run and leave my people to face the
trouble alone.â

âWhat you have said is quite true, and no one would

179
expect any less from your Honor,â replied Helen
Hinckley; âbut there is an old law concerning self
preservation. Your Honor recalls it, does he not?
Yes? Well, then, you may be compelled, in order to
carry out the law, to keep out of sight of these fanaticsâthese
would-be revolutionistsâuntil they are taught
to rememberâuntil they see the power of the Light
Divine.â

âHist! hist!â both the Governor and Helen Hinckley
heard the warning which came through a door that
led into the room where they stood, from an adjoining
room.

In another instant, the clear, piping voice of the old
man who had uttered such revolutionary sentiments at
the meeting of these disturbers of peace, called out in
hushed tones: âFind him, boys; find him. Heâs not
in his bed. I thrust daggers all over it. Then I
climbed on it and crushed my heels on every part of
it; but he was not there. Our brave leaders are behind
the bars, boys, and we are handicapped. Now this
imposter and enemy of the church must die! Come,
boys. Forward, march!â

Helen Hinckley pulled the Governorâs ear close to her
mouth, and said: âYour Honor, to stay here means
instant death. The physical power of two people
against one hundred or more is of no avail. Come;
you must leave this room with me through the outside
door. You must this moment feel the force of being
able to overcome the law of gravitation. Slip your
hands under the strap across the back of this small
propeller; step on top of the railing on the balcony;

180
trust me; do what I whisper into your ear, and we will
escape. You must come, if not for
your own
sake, for
mine,â she concluded.

âI will go, my life, for your sake,â said the Governor,
his voice full of emotion.

At once Helen Hinckley led him onto the balcony.
He stepped with her on top of the railing. He put
the cap of his long black dressing gown over his head,
and with no support except the arm of Helen Hinckley,
which she had quietly slipped through his, he
walked out with his companion into space.

The leader of the revolutionary party and his many
followers, who were seeking his life, at that moment
stepped into the room they had just left. The cool
breeze of the early morning rushed in through the open
door, feeling which, the old man at once exclaimed:
âHe has escaped; a door is open, if I am not mistaken.
A light will soon settle the question.â

No sooner was the idea given voice, than several of
the men present pressed the end of the miniature torches
they carried in their pockets, and instantly the room
was ablaze with light. With these small torches in
hand they rushed to the open door, with the vain hope
that they might catch the runaway.

âWe are misled,â piped the old man. âNo human
being could have escaped from this small balcony, without
the use of ropes and ladders. And none are here.
We are misled! We are misled. Forwardâmarch!â
he cried, after military fashion. âWe will search
every nook and corner of this great mansion, until we
find him. We will not be stopped. We are powerful,

181
and will slay every one in our path who objects to the
course we are taking.â

The old man was franticâfrantic from the thought
that they might fail in taking the life of the Governor.

He stalked into the hall followed by the other
marauders, all of whom seemed determined to demolish
and otherwise ruin as much of the house furnishings
as possible.

After completing the entire circuit of the rooms on
that floor, they started toward the wide staircase to
descend to the floor below for further search.

At the head of the stairs they suddenly came to a
standstill, and all trembled with fright at what they
saw.

The brave old man who was only a moment ago so
courageously leading his warriors to battle beheld a
child in white standing at the head of the stairs, with
arms outstretched, and he cried: âJesus and Mary defend
me! This spirit is sent to warn us of death.
Oh, oh.â He immediately fell upon his knees and
buried his face in his hands. His followers stood still
and watched the figure before them in breathless fear.

âI am no spirit,â said the child, Catalina Martinetâfor
it was she who stood before themââbut I have
been one, and in that other life which ended so
strangely for me, I knew you, poor old man. How
well I remember seeing you in the yard of the cathedral
and watching you and a boy pull the rope which rang
the bell in the high tower of the cathedral. At the
same time you helped to pull the rope, several boys in
the tower beat the big, old bell with sticks.â

182
âAh, Jesus and Mary, save me! This is a spirit, I
am sure,â cried the old man.

âI repeat,â said Catalina, âI am not a spirit now,
but I was once. Now I live again, again! Old man,
I recall how the very sight of you pulling the old rope
made me tremble with fear, if I had committed the
slightest deed contrary to the priestâs teachings and
had not confessed. You remember, do you not, old
man?â

The only reply vouchsafed was a shake of the head
and a groan.

âNo?â she continued. âThen you
shall remember
,
SeÃ±or Antonio Noriega, the time you broke your leg
when you were a very, very old man, and you lay in the
little dark adobe room back of the cathedral and died
for want of attention. Say, SeÃ±or Noriega, you need
to remember. There needs be an awakening of your
soul; now is a good time for the beginning. Arise,
sir; leave this house this very moment and cease your
evil designs.â

The old man stricken with horror, arose and in a
trembling voice, said: âIt is the voice of a spirit. I
am warned. Oh, that my eyes were open, that I might
see!â

âHere, old man,â cried one of the fellows present,
âdonât get scared and leave us at this early stage of the
game. Remember, we are out for revenge.â

âCome,â said the clear, sweet voice of the child
Catalina. âYou must leave the Governorâs house this
very moment. Arise! Forward-march! Take this
bottle, SeÃ±or Antonio Noriega, and when you step your

183
foot on the public street, drink its contents. Then
remember
;
you will live again, and you will see things
not seen by the eye, and hear things not heard by the
ear.â

The old man clutched the bottle tightly in his hand,
and started down the steps at a lively pace.

Quietly and without a word the men followed. On
reaching the door that led into the vestibule, the entire
party were surprised on being commanded to surrender.

Antonio Noriega gave up his arms at the first command;
but such was not the case with the others. For
a few moments a hard fight was waged between the
officers of law and the revolutionary party.

In the confusion and darkness, several offenders of
law escaped from the house, but were closely pursued
by officers. The others were taken in custody by the
soldiers and policemen present, and conveyed to jail.

At the moment the old man stepped from the Governorâs
Mansion onto the public street, Catalina Martinet
cried: âSeÃ±or Antonio Noriega,â and he raised
the small bottle to his lips and drained it empty.
â
Remember, remember.
â

Different members of the revolutionary party cursed
in an undertone, âMemory Fluid,â all occult science,
its devotees, and the administrators of law in general.

As the last man disappeared from view, Catalina Martinet
cried: âI will make them all live. I will get
many vials, fill them with âMemory Fluid,â and when
the sun makes the day very bright, I will take them
in a small basket, and go out amongst these people,

184
who are alive, yet do not live, and as I hand a vial to
each man who looks vicious, I will say: âDrink this
and live.â And when enough men drink the fluid, the
war which is going to be will be stopped. Come, Juan,
take me upstairs. I am sleepy and I want a bowl of
milk.â

Juan had stood close by during the affray, possibly
too frightened to move; and now that Catalina spoke
to him, he moved forward and cried: âYour Honor,
the child is not human. I must leave your service.â

Catalina clutched his arm tightly, and in a fit of
childish glee, said: âSee, Juan; I am Catalina, a big,
healthy child. I was a spirit once, but now I am flesh
and blood. Come on, Juan, take me upstairs; then
get me a bowl of milk. I am hungry. Come on,
Juan; I am not a ghost. I am poor Catalina. I am
tired and hungry, Juan. Carry me.â She raised her
arms up to him. Without a word he lifted her in his
arms, and hurried with her to the little room adjoining
the housekeeperâs; which was on her arrival furnished
with every article for childish comfort and
pleasure that could be found in Chihuahua. Strange
to say, the house which only a few moments ago was
filled with violators of the law whose intent was murder,
was now so still, that a person stepping into the
home of the Governor, could hardly imagine that such
a state of affairs ever could have existed in such a
quiet and magnificently appointed home. Catalina
fell asleep in Juanâs arms, and the slumber of the
healthy child whose breath fell gently on his cheek,
was the one demonstrated fact that she was a child of

185
flesh and blood and very human, notwithstanding she
might be a novice in spiritual attainments. He was
convinced of the human part, however, and smiled to
himself, as he laid her on the bed, at the fright she
had given him. Her head had no sooner touched the
bed than she opened her eyes, and said: âJuan, bring
me a bowl of warm milk, please. I am hungryâhungryâhungry.â

Juan replied, at the same moment turning his head
to hide a smile: â
Muchacha mia
, Juan will bring you
a bowl,
muy grande
, at that,
de leche caliente
.â

âStay, Juan,â she cried, as he stepped into the hall.
âYou are not afraid of me now, are you?â

âNo, no, child. You are a very, very lively little
girl and no spirit. Of that fact I am fully satisfied.
I am going now for the milk. Good-bye, sweet child.
Juan is your friend.â

âJuan is a strange old fellow,â said Catalina, as she
cuddled down on her little bed. âHe was afraid of
me because he thought me a spirit. I wish my dear
papa was here. I will go and find him as soon as it is
very light. If all these people could only
remember
,
there never would be a bloody war. I must find Miss
Helen Hinckley and Miss Marriet Motuble. She befriended
me in the other life and built a very large,
nice tomb for me when I died. She was very, very
good to me, but she is queer; silly, I think now. I
heard papa and SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales and Julio
Murillo say she pretended to die and be buried in the
Motuble tomb, where I was placed, and when they went
there to see the body, they found in the coffinâonly

186
a waxen figure. I wonder why she pretended to die
and didnât. I wonder if she thought some one would
cryâmy papa, I suspectâand she would only make
believe she was dead, to see who cared or would cry.
Papa would cry, I know, if I were dead. I believe I
will die and see. I will wait, though, till Juan gets
my warm milk; for I am awful hungry. It is thinking
about the ugly war and those wicked men who were
just here, that made me want my hot milk this early
in the morning.â At that moment Juan entered the
room, bringing a howl of hot milk and a plate of
shredded graham bread, and placed it on a little table
by the side of her bed.

She drank part of the milk, and laying her head
back on the pillow, said: âJuan, would you cry if I
were to die now?â

Juan was startled, and replied: âNow you are going
to scare me again. Because you
remember
, and say
you lived here once before, itâs no sign that if you die
now and ever live again, that you will
remember
. You
would better hold on as long as you can, now that you
are here. You are a little girl, and young; you have
no business talking about dying. God did not make
you to kill yourself. You drink the rest of the milk
before it gets cold, and go to sleep.â

âJuan,â continued Catalina, âif you would be sorry,
then how much more sorry my papa and Miss Hinckley
would be.â

âI suppose your mamma would be very sorry too;
and his Honor would be most distracted if you died
so young. He has taken the greatest fancy to you of

187
anyone since I came into his service; and that was
when I was a very young man. You donât know what
a good place you have, little girl, and my advice is to
stay close to it while you can,â concluded Juan, with a
bob of his head.

âListen, Juan,â continued the child. âI feel like I
must die. I will die at once. Come close to me. Sit
in this chair, and you can see how I do it.â

Juan took a seat by her little bed, not because he
wanted to, but from the fact that he could not resist
her influence.

âI mean, Juan, his Honor, the Governor. He is
my papa, you know, and would be very sorry if I were
to die. The man and woman into whose family I
was born are nothing to me now. I never cared much
for them, nor they for me; so no one there will cry.
Why, Juan I took them a bottle of âMemory Fluid,â
and tried to get them to take it, so they could remember
and we all could be happy. I could not be staying
with people who only care for this life. Persons who
see the things
only
seen by the
eye
.â

âGoodness!â exclaimed Juan, rising. âHow can
anyone see except
with
their eyes? Child, you are talking
about things you know nothing of. Drink your
milk and go to sleep. I canât stay here much longer
a-humoring you. Iâve got to attend to SeÃ±or Murillo,â
concluded Juan, rising.

âSit down, Juan, sit down,â quietly said Catalina;
and Juan obeyed meekly.

âGreat One, who lives here and everywhere, who
knows all and causes all, speak to me. Advise me.

188
Will I be interfering with my soul, will light be shut
out from me; will I be in the way of anyone seeing
things not seen by the eyes, if I leave the matter we call
a body, and go to you? The people into whose family
I was born are harming me, and I, a little girl, am not
strong enough in will or in knowledge of law to make
them follow me.â Turning to Juan she continued:
âI have not been answered yet, Juan, but I feel as if
I must go; but I will come back, I will come back,
and his Honor, his Honor will be my papa. See, Juan,
I am going.â

âOh, donât go yet,â cried Juan; âthere is the bell.
I must answer it.â

Catalina sat up in bed, and as Juan left the room,
called: âDonât be gone a moment, Juan. I want to go
away.â Then to herself she continued: âIt is not right
for me to have been born into a family that do not
know me, that do not know the other world, and who
do not remember. I cannot be happy. I must live
again. Great One above, shall I come?â She leaned
her head upon the little pillow encased in a dainty
linen slip, and remained perfectly silent. When
Juan opened the door a few moments later, and rushed
into the room, she sat upright, and before he had time
to speak, said: âJuan, I am not going now. I can
help his Honor. I can help others. I can give many
âMemory Fluidâ; but before the cruel war ends, I will
leave and come again.â

âI am almost out of breath, I hurried so fast to get
back before you could die. I got some terrible news.
It came from the President, and as his Honor was not

189
here, SeÃ±or Julio Murillo opened the dispatch and
translated the ciphers. He believes there will be trouble
all over the States. He says he will telephone him personally
in a few hours, and on his arrival in Washington
if the revolutionists are gaining in number and
giving more trouble, the army will be called out, and
peace will soon be restored. His Honor is not in the
mansion, and everyone but SeÃ±or Julio Murillo fears
that some harm has befallen him.â

âOh, no; not everyone,â cried Catalina. âI am
not afraid he is harmed. He is with Helen Hinckley
and safe. She loves him. SeÃ±or Julio knows where
they are, but I do not; but I can find them. Go on,
Juan. I am going to sleep; the warm milk is taking
effect. I will sleep, but not die for some time to come;
not until I feel that I have done all possible good.
Then I will go and come back again, and then you will
know me; you will not be dead, but you will
remember
.
Go on, Juan; I am going to sleep. Tell his Honor,
if you should see him before I do, not to be alarmed,
if he does not see me for a few days. I will be very
busy while the struggle lasts; at least, while it lasts in
Chihuahua. Many are needed to spread âMemory
Fluid.â It will have more effect in spreading truth
abroad and quelling the war at hand, than millions of
guns. I am needed to keep my eye upon several
whom his Honor will pass by, now that the lives of
his people are in danger. I will be a detective, Juan,
and because I am a child no one will mind me being
around. There is âThe Plunger from Kansas,â Mrs.
Grange, and Marriet Motuble, who need the eye of the

190
law upon them, but on account of the trouble caused
by Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, Father Hernandez
and Rev. J. T. Note, they will be forgotten. It is
my duty to see to them, and I will perform my duty
well. Go on, Juan; I am very sleepy.â

The little fair head again fell back against the pillows,
and in the few moments Juan stood by silently
watching, she fell into a sound slumber.

âShe is flesh and blood,â he soliloquized, standing
quietly by her bedside looking upon her plump, childish
face. âYes, she is flesh and blood; but she has a great
spirit in her. She is unlike other children. I am
afraid of her, yet I know she is only a child. She is
a prophet. I will take âMemory Fluid,â then I can see
things not seen by the eyes. Ah, there is the bell
again, again, again; something out of the usual is happening.â
Juan quietly and quickly left the room. In
the hall he met Julio Murillo, walking faster than he
had ever known him to walk before. On seeing Juan
he cried:

âI leave orders not to admit anyone to the house
to-day. Under no circumstances will this order be
countermanded. I will leave by a private entrance.
No one will see me go nor return. SeÃ±or Guillermo
Gonzales alone will occupy the Governorâs private study
until my return. Under no circumstances intrude on
him. He must not be worried about me, nor by anyone
asking questions; and it is your business to keep quiet,
and guard the house well, and his Honorâs interests in
general, until I return.â

Juan replied: âTrust me, seÃ±or. I have never yet

191
betrayed his Honor or his interests. The hour is very
early; you have not had your morning meal. His
Honor would not forgive me if a guest left his home,
even if the hour be four, without his customary meal.
Recline here, seÃ±or, and in a very few minutes I will
return with a lunch just fitted to this early hour.â

âYour advice is good, Juan. I will accept your hospitality.
But be quick; every moment counts now. I
have located the three men who were last night confined
in jail, on a charge of treason, and who escaped
less than an hour ago. While I had no trouble in
locating them, there will be much difficulty in getting
them again behind the prison bars. You are right,
Juan; I will need my morning meal before attempting
their arrest. Bring me a bowl of hot milk, a plate of
buttered toast, and two soft-boiled eggs, and bring it
quickly, Juan. The revolution is inevitable, and we
must face it like men and stop it; if possible, without
bloodshed. Yes, I will wait, Juan, just fifteen minutes.â

As Juan passed from the presence of SeÃ±or Julio
Murillo, he gave a sharp, low whistle, his only means to
express the great surprise he had just received.

âWell, this is a nice state of things. The Governor
spirited away, the prisoners escaped, Catalina on the
eve of dying, âThe Plunger from Kansasâ gone again, a
woman arising from the dead, and a war on hand, all
at the same time. Yes, a strange world. I donât
believe I will know as much as I do now, if I do not
stop thinking so much about all of these strange things.
I donât believe I will take âMemory Fluid.â I will have

192
no time then to do anything but remember everything
that happened when I lived before. I really wonder if
I have lived before, or more than once. How funny it
would be to remember four or five different lives. As
soon as I get SeÃ±or Julio Murilloâs breakfast to him,
and he is well out of the house, I will experiment with
âMemory Fluid.â I will be a subject. Oh, I wonder
who I was when I lived before? Ha! ha! ha! ha!
Wouldnât it be a great joke if I was in my first life a
president? Maybe I was George Washington, or the
Mexican President, Santa Ana. Yes, that is a great
joke. I have my own curiosity up, and will drink a
gallon of that âMemory Fluid,â if it will make me remember.â

Juan strode on toward the kitchen hurriedly, to give
the order for SeÃ±or Julio Murilloâs breakfast, and then
sat down on a stool and deeply meditated, upon the
subject of âMemory Fluid.â

193

CHAPTER XIV.

MEETING IN THE ALAMEDA.

SeÃ±or Julio Murillo reclined on a comfortable
couch in the large reception-hall on the second floor
of the Governorâs stately mansion, to await the return
of Juan.

âI see,â he mentally commented, âthe end of this
revolution which has just begun. If those who precipitated
the mad act were told now what the final
would be, they would have no faith in what was told
them being true, and would leave nothing undone to
carry out their present intentions. There is no way of
dealing with those who have no knowledge outside of
physical self, except by physical force. It is a
lamentable condition of affairs to those who cannot see
the end. To me it is of no concern whatever, except
that I hate to see the suffering of humanity. There is
always a certain sympathy, which the initiated have
with those who do not know the Law. The spread of
Free Thought during the last century, caused by scientific
investigations, particularly in the spirit realm, has
been wonderful. Such a very great decrease in crime
has never been known, or at least has never been
recorded since the beginning of time, as that shown

194
during the last fifty years. The wane of the power of
the priest and the pastor, and the great diffusion of
scientific truths concerning the realm of the hidden
is accountable for it. I will not do my duty if I fail
to relieve the sufferings of those who do not
know
, of
those who can only see the things seen by the eye.
Here comes Juan, poor fellow. I wish he could see the
hidden. He is on the road and will soon know, however.
Is it he? Are my physical eyes failing me? It cannot be;
the figure is too large and does not move like a domestic;
still, Juan has much spirit. It is SeÃ±or Guillermo
Gonzales. Ha! ha! what a start he gave me.â

He started to rise to greet the person coming toward
him whom he thought to be his scientific coworker,
when he uttered a startled exclamation and fell quietly
back in the deep shadows, amongst the pillows on the
couch.

âIt approaches with the caution and tread of Macbeth.
It is not a spirit. It is of flesh and blood, and
is here for no good purpose. To me it will be amusing
from this moment on, to watch the many nefarious
people who will try to end this physical existence
of the good and great Governor. If they knew what
I know, they would certainly save themselves the
trouble. The light in the early morning is very uncertain,
yet the outlines of face and figure I cannot discern
with the physical eye, is plain through the eye
of intuition. And I see the much-disguised figure of
Marriet Motuble, the invincible. I must not be discovered
here, or half the pleasure of knowing the object
of her early call will be lost. From a physical

195
sense of view, to follow her over the house will be interesting.
Ah, where is she going now? She stops. She
listens. I wonder what she hears? Can it be that she
hears my breathing, or feels the vibrations of my
thoughts? I hope not; for if either be the case, this
interesting scene will be denied me. She goes toward
his Honorâs private bedroom. The lay of the rooms
are well defined in her mind. What is it she carries
in her right hand? Now she raises it. The door is
opening. She will not waste a shot, I am quite sure.
When she finds the Governor is not in his apartment,
she will be disappointed, and hurry out for fear of being
discovered, but not by this door; the more private
one at the end of the suite will suit her purposes, I
fancy, much better. I will have Juan follow and
catch her if possible. I will have him fasten all the
doors securely and bar the windows. She will lead
him a lively chase; but then he will be otherwise occupied
than studying and worrying over the absence of
his Honor. Here he is now.â

Juan placed the breakfast on a table near the couch,
and said: âFifteen minutes is a long time to spend
in preparing so simple a meal. I hope, I hope I have
not tired your patience.â

âIt makes no difference; in fact, I am glad I was
detained. I have another commission for you,â said
SeÃ±or Julio Murillo. âYou know the large, aggressive
seÃ±orita Marriet Motuble, do you not?â

âI do, sir; I do. She frightened me badly once. I
will tell you about it,â said Juan.

âAt some other time, Juan,â replied SeÃ±or Julio

196
Murillo. âWe have no time to lose. She is in the
house at this moment, intent on no good purpose. See
that she does not get out of the house. Tell her you
have orders not to open the doors under twenty-four
hours. Follow her, Juan. She must not escape.â

âBut you, sir. I cannot leave you unserved,â
pleaded Juan, expressing the hope that he might not
have to follow Marriet Motuble.

âI need no more service, Juan. In ten minutes I
will have completed my breakfast and be gone. You
have no time to lose; the house must be securely fastened,
for the seÃ±orita is as sly as a fox, and will
escape if double caution is not quickly secured. It is
necessary to detain this woman, from more points of
view than one. I have nothing more to say, Juan,
except for you to go.â

Juanâs head fell low, and without a word he walked
slowly in the direction Marriet Motuble had disappeared.

Julio Murillo finished his meal quickly, descended
the stairs noiselessly, and in an instant had disappeared
from the house.

Juan encountered the aggressive seÃ±orita sooner than
he had calculated. Evidently the many rooms and
openings on the floor had confused her, and she had
lost her bearings. And now as she was retracing her
steps, no doubt in the hope of finding the private
stairway which led to a door opening onto the back
lawn, she faced Juan before either was aware of the
presence of the other.

The invincible seÃ±orita was equal to the emergency,

197
but Juan fell over against a wall, trembling and
frightened, and prayed that she would pass him unobserved.

Again he was doomed to disappointment, for instead
of passing him unobserved, or if observed, hurrying
by him in the hope of escaping without being
detected, the very instant she saw him she walked
bravely up, and slapping him on the shoulder, said:

âHello, Juan. You seem to have been on guard all
night, or else something unusual has happened to get
you up at this early hour. Come, Juan, you are my
friend; let me into your secret. I mean, of course, the
secret of the household.â

âWell,â replied Juan, with some spirit, as he pushed
her hand off his shoulder and moved away from her,
âyou seem to know more about this house than I do.â

âHa! ha! Juan,â laughed the seÃ±orita. âHa! ha!
there are tricks in all trades, and by the time you have
lived through five existences and
remember
everything
in each life and take advantage of your learning, you
will know more about some things than some other
people who do not
remember
. Ha! ha! Juan, why
donât you drink some of your masterâs âMemory Fluidââa
gallon or so, to start on? Ha! ha! That
âLiquid from the Sunâs Raysâ is wonderful! It could
not be otherwise, as his Honor is such a wonderful man.
But come, Juan, tell me where he is. In which
room? And see, this is for your trouble.â She held
up a twenty-dollar gold coin, which shone brightly in
the dim light of the early morning. âA twenty-dollar
gold coin cannot be picked up every moment, Juan.
Do you know a good thing when you see it?â

198
âSee me; do you, miss, see me? Well, I will stand
here until I starve to death, or am killed, before I
would tell you anything about his Honorâs affairs,
if you offered me ten times that amount of money.
I donât need any money. I have plenty to eat and
wear. But I havenât time to stand here in his Honorâs
private bedrooms talking to a lady at this early hour
in the morning or at any other hour of the day.â

âWell, well,
amigo
,
you are a loyal servant. I only
wanted to know if his Honor has recovered from the
fright I gave him a few days ago. I really do not recall
to mind the exact date,â persisted Miss Motuble.

To which Juan replied: âThe Governor is not so
easily frightened as you seem to imagine.
You
never
frightened him; you simply overpowered him
by means of your superior physical force.â

âWhew!â was the surprised beginning of Miss Motubleâs
reply. âWhew! think of this great logician
living all these years in Chihuahua and until this moment
undiscovered. I have done humanity a great act
of kindness by coming up here, even if my original
object in coming was what the physical world calls
villainous.â

âThere has been more than one person here to-night
for the same purpose. But the Governor is alive and
well, and will so remain until the end of time.â

âJuan,â tantalizingly replied Miss Motuble, âyou
are fast becoming a man of science. Association has
done it all, Juanâdone it all.â

At that moment a small figure in white appeared in
the room where they stood.

199
âIt is the ghost of Catalina,â said Juan.

âIt is no ghost. It is Catalina herself. She is a
somnambulist. You do not know what that word
means, do you, Juan? It means she walks in her sleep.
Come; we will follow her,â concluded Miss Motuble.
Catalina walked quietly to the far end of the room in
the direction she was going, then, turning around, she
retraced her steps and entered her own room. She
was closely followed by Marriet Motuble. Juan took
advantage of the occasion to slip away unobserved and
to carry out the instructions of Julio Murillo.

Catalina climbed upon her little bed, and to all appearances
went to sleep. Marriet Motuble wanted to
speak to the child, yet hesitated. Going close to the
bed and gazing intently on her upturned face, she said:
âShe is very much of a child, indeed. I will not speak
to her. Juan, show me over the house.â Juan made
no reply, and turning around, she discovered for the
first time that he was not present. âThat is a cool way
of treating a guest. I will report the actions of this
domestic to his Honor the first time I meet him.
Think of it. I, Marriet Motuble, in her sixth life,
with a full and complete remembrance of each, being
left to pilot myself through the grand mansion of the
great Governor of Chihuahua. It seems that the manners
of domestics, and some people who are not domestics,
to-day are as much out of order as they were in
the nineteenth century. The nonprogression of some
people is not to be accounted for; at least, I shall not
occupy my mind trying to figure it out. There are
other things of more consequence. For instance, were

200
the revolutionists successful in killing his Honor, and
his coworkers? If so, where are their bodies? If not,
where are the revolutionists? There are no signs of
any disturbers of peace having been here. Iâll make a
hasty search through the house, and quietly make my
exit.â

No sooner had Marriet Motuble passed from the
room, than Catalina sprang from her bed, quickly put
on a street dress, and in a few minutes was out of
the house. She passed on without attracting any attention.

The streets were alive with trades-people hurrying
to their respective places of business. In the great
bustle, no one noticed the child. Marriet Motuble, too,
evaded the guardianship of Juan, and was soon lost in
the crowds on the streets. Everywhere there were
large numbers of policemen, and now and then small
squads of soldiers hurried by, all of whom evidently
had a place in view which they were bent on reaching
at an early hour.

As she wandered on and on through one crowded
street after another, she met here and there a face
whom she recognized as a revolutionary sympathizer,
many of whom had been amongst the crowd in the
store room the evening before, and heard her deliver
a sympathetic speech, disguised as a man. How none
of them recognized her. How could they, when no
one had any suspicions that the speaker of the previous
evening was a woman in disguise. Marriet Motubleâs
face wore a look of serious disappointment.

Approaching a small group of men she inquired the

201
hour, and on being told it was five oâclock, she then
asked if the morning paper was out and what news
there was about the persons intent on disturbing the
peace. Several expressed themselves as considering the
condition of affairs very alarming; while others who
joined the crowd thought the affair would be of no
further consequence.

While the small crowd were talking, the cry of:
âAll about the Revolutionists,â âPrisoners accused of
Treason against the United States of America,â from
a hundred or more news-carriers, rang out loud and
long.

Every person present bought a paper, the great daily

Chihuahuan
.

Marriet Motuble opened her paper, and as she walked
hurriedly toward the Mexican Annex, read to herself:

âSeventy-five of the revolutionary party traced by
detectives to the home of Governor Lehumada, where
all but a few, who escaped during the trouble which
occurred while the arrests were being made, are now
lodged behind the prison bars awaiting trial. The object
of these fanatics was to take the life of the Governor,
which would precipitate the State into a fearful
excitement, and aid them in getting a hold upon the
ignorant, and in increasing their nefarious deeds.
The promoters of the revolutionary sentiments: Don
Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, Father Hernandez, and
the Rev. J. T. Note, who were arrested and placed in
jail on a charge of treason against the Government,
have escaped.â

âEscaped!â exclaimed Marriet Motuble. âEscaped,

202
and I did not know it till now. Well, I never will tell

The Chihuahuan
where I got the first knowledge of
the affair. Ha! ha! I would bet on J. T. Note every
time. He was slick in the other life that I knew him.
He was a foreign missionary. He came down to this
country, which was then a part of the fastly waning
Republic of Mexico, to teach the descendants of the
Aztecs and the Spanish conquerors the Protestant faith.
He represented a large body of proselytes who were
jealous of the hold the Catholic Church had on the
Mexican Republic. He exhorted and pleaded with the
poor, downtrodden people, to believe as the Protestants
believed; to renounce their faith in catholicism. He
without question wanted the
centavos
the ignorant creatures
stole and begged for, and he got them, many of
them at that. And he built himself a fine place of
worship and clothed himself and family in purple and
fine linen, as the Bible expresses it, and lived off the
fat of the land from the sale of the
zarapas
which were
donated for the use of the poor, ignorant peons whom
he had converted. Yes, he is slick. Now he is in the
same boat that the priests were in then. The faith
in the teachings of the lazy creatures is waning. There
should be more corn-fields to plough and ditches to dig,
and everyone who subscribes himself priest or pastor
should be compelled to dig so many hundred feet every
year, even if they missed part of their prayers and confessions.
Yes, J. T. Note will wiggle out of this
affair somehow, as he has out of jail. It may be,
through the instrumentality of the present
rÃ©gime
he
and his associates will be ebonized and put in a

203
museum, where they will be of much interest to the
future generations.

âThe treatise on âUses of Ebony Fluid,â which I found
lying on the Governorâs desk in his private office the
first day I called there, speaks of using it to preserve
the body in its present shape, after the spirit of life
has passed out. The use of a few drops of âEbony
Fluidâ turns all such animal matter black as ebony,
and preserves it through all eternity. This gives me
an idea. The copy of his treatise on âMental
Fotography,â which I took with me from the room, will
enable me to experiment with this lightning process of
fotography known only to his Honor, Messrs. Julio
Murillo and Guillermo Gonzales, and to spring a surprise
upon them. Well, these meditations will save for
another time. What is this: âThe Governor Spirited
Away! He has not been seen at the Mansion since
eleven-thirty last night. Much fear is entertained that
foul play has been done. At this hour no news of his
whereabouts can be had. Much rioting and plundering
by sympathizers from both the Catholic and Protestant
faith in many of the States. Those who are
opposed to free thought and the scientific demonstration
of spiritualistic advancement constitute a large
body of the revolutionists.ââ

Folding up
The Chihuahuan
, and placing it in her
coat-pocket, after the fashion of business men, she
increased her pace.

âAh!â she exclaimed, as she turned a corner which
put her on the street facing the Mexican Annex; âif
there is not the child Catalina. Something is taking

204
place which I cannot ferret. She must not see me.
I will hurry to the Annex, disguise myself, and follow
this child, who is wiser than her years,â concluded
the invincible Marriet Motuble, as she hurried on with
lightning tread.

Catalina Martinet walked slowly on, now and then
glancing around as if she expected some one. On
reaching the Alameda she increased her steps and
walked up to the magnificent statue of George Washington.
After viewing it intently for a moment, she
sat down on a rustic seat near by. âI will sit here and
watch for her. She must be punished in this life for
her misdeeds. She, as well as âThe Plunger from
Kansas,â escaped in the other life. She was a peace disturber
then, and who can say she is not a peace disturber
now? Ah, here comes a person who makes one
feel like there is no ill in the world. Her presence has
the same effect on me, after seeing Marriet Motuble,
that oil does on a deep burn. It heals and cools the
fever caused by evil thoughts. I love her; she is my
angel of light,â concluded Catalina Martinet, as she
sprang from her seat in eager excitement, and ran to
meet the object of her love.

Helen Hinckley clasped her fondly in her arms, and
exclaimed: âIt is a very early hour, sweet child, for
you to be out and alone. I knew you would be here;
that is why I came this way.â

âI expected you, Miss Hinckley. You must help
me as you did the Governor, if I need help. He is
safe, is he not?â said Catalina.

âYou expected me, you say? Well, that is a coincidence.

205
Yes, child, the great Governor, author and
scientific man is safe and unharmed. He is beyond
the pale of the revolutionists. No great harm can
attend; the great Divine Influence will protect him
from physical destruction, but often his existence
physically will be in danger of annihilation. Come,
dear, tell me why you are out, and in what way I can
serve you. We are both working to accomplish the
same result,â said the beautiful Helen Hinckley, as
she pressed the childâs soft white hands to her lips.

âI am out,â answered Catalina, âto look after several
people; those who should be compelled to repent of
their evil ways in this life, that others in a life to come
may not be imposed upon by them.â

âSo far,â said Helen Hinckley, âyour answer is
logical and full of feeling. But who are the people
about whom you have reached such a conclusion?â

âThe main person is âThe Plunger from Kansas.â
He is in hiding and in disguise. He lingers and
lingers in this city; yet it is hard to get him to the bar
of justice.â

âThat is true, child; there is a great mental magnet
that holds him here in spite of himself. And if by
some means he becomes a
subject
, he will walk up by
his own free will and acknowledge the debt he owes to
me and others, and will proffer the money. The day
of reckoning is sure to come. Do not let the Plunger
give you one moment of uneasiness, dear,â added Miss
Hinckley.

âI am not uneasy. I am only anxious to get out
of the body again; and I wish to serve his Honor all

206
that is possible before I go,â was the rather serious
reply of Catalina.

âYou are unhappy, child. Why is it, when you
are surrounded by every comfort, and are dearly beloved
by his Honor? He could not love a child of
his own any more. Do not wish to leave. I will be
lonely when you are gone. And his Honor, I cannot
say how badly he will feel. I do not like to see a
little girl so serious.â

Helen Hinckley took the strange child on her lap as
she concluded, and pressed her face to her bosom.

Catalina put her arms around her neck and as she
kissed her fondly on the cheek, said: âBefore I remembered,
I was not serious; but I took spells of crying,
and without any reason whatever I cried to be
called Catalina Lehumada. Then on the day I went
to sell flowers and saw the bad, bad man who caused
me grief in the life gone by, I remembered. SeÃ±or
Julio Murillo says he put a small bottle of âMemory
Fluidâ near by, so I could not help inhaling the fumes,
and that is what made me remember. Then I knew
why I felt as I did about not being his little girl.
It is enough to make any one serious to be born into
a family in which there is no harmony whatever with
oneâs life. When I see the Plunger repentant, and
hear Marriet Motuble confess her sins, and the man
who made me faint, mend his ways, I will go, and
return, I hope, into a sphere of harmony. There
comes Marriet Motuble. I must follow her instead of
her following me.â

âWhere is she, child? queer, interesting, lovely,

207
spiritual darling that you are, tell me, where is Marriet
Motuble?â quickly spoke Catalinaâs companion.

âDo you see that large man dressed in steel-grey
clothes, who walks like a lawyer? Yes? That person
is not a man. Marriet Motuble is the name of the
person. She is out for no good. Less than an hour
ago she was in his Honorâs mansion.â

âImpossible! How did she enter?â cried Miss
Hinckley, as she arose to watch Marriet Motuble, the
friend of her other life, now parading nervously before
the great Mexican Annex.

âStranger in this life than in the life she lived in
the nineteenth century. She is kind-hearted enough
and true in a way. Her strange actions are due to
her inability to control her violent temper, on the one
hand, and to temper her jealousy, on the other.â

âIt is her love for his Honor, and the assurance
she has that he cares not for her, that causes her strange
actions in this life. She is looking for you. She believes
you know where his Honor is, and if she follows
you she will find him. Look, Miss Hinckley, look; a
dreadful fight is taking place yonder, I want to go. I
may be needed,â cried Catalina.

âQuite true, child. We will go. Listen to the reports
of the guns. How horrible to send one out of
the body in such an uproarious fashion. Why canât
they use the noiseless guns? This is simply barbarism.â

âI want to go,â impatiently cried Catalina. âI
must go. Miss Hinckley, come with me. I am impatient
to finish my work here and go. I cannot longer

208
endure the family relations into which I was born.
It is a living death to me. Look at the crowd! His
Honor may be there and in danger. His work has only
begun; he must not be retarded in it.â

Helen Hinckley took the strange child, strange to
the uninitiated, by the hand, looked intently into her
sweet upturned face, which she kissed fondly, and
without a word they started briskly toward the street
where the fight was taking place.

âOh, I wish I were there,â impatiently cried Catalina.
âIf I had wings I would fly.â

âStop, dear; put your right palm on my left palm
and slip your left hand under this strap. That is correct.
We cannot fly like birds in the sky, but we can
sail along at a slow, steady rate, much faster than we
can walk; and if necessary, we can rise above the
crowd and escape.â

âHow splendid!â cried Catalina, as she felt herself
rising from the ground. âHow splendid! Miss Hinckley,
you are my angel. You will carry me safely.
His Honor cannot live much longer in this life unless
you are with him. My dear papa! I love him,
oh, so much! He
will be
my papa some day, when I
return.â

âHe loves you now, as if you were his child, and
so do I,â whispered Helen Hinckley to Catalina.

âI will be
your
child, too.
Yours
and his
Honorâs
,â
answered the child, happy in the thought that she
would have in a life to come harmonious environments.

The crowd grew greater, and by the time Miss
Hinckley and her little companion reached the place

209
where the trouble was occurring, ten thousand people
had collected themselves together, and from the threats
and cries against the Governor and his scientific coworkers,
many amongst them evidently were of the
revolutionary party.

Miss Hinckley and Catalina quietly pushed themselves
into the thickest of the crowd, and had it not
been for the fact that they could hold themselves above
the crowd, both would have suffered for the want of
pure, wholesome air.

At first no one paid any attention to them, but
when Miss Hinckley saw men fall back dying, she
cried: âStand back, gentlemen!â and everyone looked
at her in surprise.

210

CHAPTER XV.

THE CONSPIRATORS DISPERSED.

âIt is only a woman!â exclaimed one man. âFinish
the job, boys. She cannot prevent us. Finish your
slaughter, boys; then we will triumph. Do not mind
the voice of a woman. One of the makers of âMemory
Fluidâ lies dead now, and the others will be laid in
the grave at the same time, if they can be found.â

At that moment the entire crowd was surrounded by
police and soldiers, and the voice of a general rang
out: âRevolutionists, surrender or die!â

Still, curses, threats and shots from the disturbers
of peace rang out. The soldiers were drawing
nearer and on the point of rushing into the
revolutionists, determined to quell the uprising with
their noiseless guns and poisoned bayonets, when
Helen Hinckley arose far above the heads of all, with
Catalina by the hand, and cried: âColonel, no blood
must be shed. The principles of truth must not be
established by bloodshed. People cannot be forced to
see the inner life. It can only come through an
awakening of self. Orthodoxism has been carried into
every country with the
sword
in one hand, and the

cross
in the other. No lasting good has resulted. A
knowledge of things not seen by the eye cannot be

211
forced on man. Come forward; the disturbers will
give up their arms. Take them prisoners, and if they
will be subjects, if they will take âMemory Fluidâ freely
and without force, the evil in them will be overcome.
They will remember and when they remember they will

see the things not seen by the eye
.â

To the initiated the sight of Helen Hinckley and
Catalina Martinet suspended in the air wholly without
any visible support, in consequence of overcoming
the law of gravitation, was the cause of much rejoicing.
On the other hand, the great mass of people present
whose knowledge of the great law of God was
limited, or more often wanting, stood back in awe.
Some of the revolutionists cried: âSave us, save us!
The wrath of God is upon us. The end of the world
is near.â

The captain of one of the regular companies stood
near by, and seeing the effect of Helen Hinckleyâs words
and the sight of her and Catalina now moving slowly
from one part of the crowd to another, suspended in
space, concluded to take advantage of the occasion, and
quietly and without bloodshed make prisoners of the
worst of the leaders of the trouble. At the most opportune
moment possible for him to be assisted in carrying
out his intentions, Helen Hinckley cried: âLay
down your arms, you disturbers of law! Surrender
before it is too late.â The soldiers rushed in and with
very little trouble disarmed those who had uttered the
revolutionary sentiments, those who were considered
the most dangerous, and the leaders of the party.

With the assistance of the police, several hundred

212
men were marshalled away from the crowded street,
some imprisoned and others put under strict surveillance,
where they would be kept until peace was
finally assured in the city, and the rebellion in general
had been quelled.

While the throng was dispersing, Helen Hinckley
and Catalina sought the wounded, and had them removed
to the great hospital, while the dead were taken
to the morgue to await identification and be prepared
for burial.

Julio Murillo was discovered, when they were leaving
to follow the wounded to the hospital, jammed up
against a large stone, several bullet holes through
him and one leg broken. A litter was soon at hand by
Miss Hinckleyâs order, and the great man of science
was carried hurriedly to the Governorâs Mansion, where
every attention known to science was given him.

Not for several hours after his leg had been set, the
bullets removed and the poison counteracted by means
of âLiquid from the Sunâs Rays,â did he return to
consciousness.

SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales, assisted by Helen Hinckley,
performed the entire operation, and sat quietly
by his side discussing in subdued tones the present
state of affairs. When he again had control of his
mental faculties, he addressed himself first to Helen
Hinckley.

âYou saved me from many long days of suffering
by discovering my condition when you did, and attending
to my wounds so promptly. And I thank
you very much.â

213
âI was out to do my duty, friend Julio; there is no
occasion for thanks. Many believed that you had left
us; but I was determined not to take any chances.
It seemed impossible that you would pass away at the
very moment your services are the most needed. Now
that you are with us again, and I am assured of the
fact, I will go to the hospital, where my hands may
be needed to care for the wounded and dying.â

At that moment, Juan quietly entered the room,
bringing a card which he handed to SeÃ±or Guillermo
Gonzales.

He scanned the card closely and read: ââWilliam
Jones, Physician and Surgeon,â A very plain, inoffensive
name. I will receive Doctor Jones; he may
be able to render some assistance at the hospital. Show
him up to the reception-room, Juan. Hold a minute,â
he said, turning the card over; âhere is a message
written on the back.â

âYour Honor,â it began, âI wish to offer my professional
services. Let me help care for the wounded
and dying. Call me. I am your servant.â

âThose are noble sentiments. I will receive him immediately.
Miss Hinckley, remain with friend Julio
until I return,â concluded Guillermo Gonzales, as he
arose to leave the room. Julio Murillo detained him
by saying: âDoctor Jones has no doubt made this
call partly to find out my condition. I will consider
it a favor if you let him come to this room, and I
insist that Miss Hinckley remain.â

âAs you like, friend Julio. You know your condition
better than anyone else. If you do not fear any

214
evil results from having this stranger present, Juan
may show the visitor here, to this room,â concluded
Guillermo Gonzales.

No sooner had Juan disappeared from the room, than
a light tap was heard on the door. Helen Hinckley
opened it quietly and his Honor stepped into the room.

He clasped her hand warmly, and said in tones only
heard by herself: âMy soul, my life, my preserver! I
must speak to you alone.
When
and where? I want
to know now.â

âWhen the interview at hand is over, I will take you
to our retreat, found this morning. Hark! they are
coming,â concluded Miss Hinckley, going slowly with
the Governor to the bed on which lay the wounded scientist.

SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales greeted the Governor cordially,
and explained the condition of Julio.

The Governor sympathized heartily with the sufferer,
and assured him that the mere fact of his escape from
death, or rather of his being wounded in the affray,
would serve as proof of the real intentions of the rebels,
and be a means of helping to bring the trouble to an
early end.

âI have for the last two hours been closeted with the
officers of war, and constantly in receipt of messages
from Washington. The Government is determined to
put down these small cliques of rebels. The condition
of affairs in some of the States east of the Mississippi
River is worse than in our own city. The President
will arrive in the national capital to-morrow night, and
a council of war will be held immediately. Instantly

215
the result will be made known to us. There is much,
much to be talked about; but the condition of our
friend Julio must be the first consideration. Ah! here
comes some one. Who can be intruding on the wounded
one?â concluded the Governor.

SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales handed him the card of
the prospective visitor, and said: âA physician, who
wishes to assist in caring for the wounded and dying.
It is at the request of Julio that he comes here.â

At that moment the door opened at the order of
SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales, and Juan ushered in
William Jones, M. D., but not alone. He was accompanied
by a much smaller and younger looking man,
whom he introduced to SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales as
âmy secretary, Francis Maynard.â

William Jones, M. D., bowed very stiffly when presented
to the Governor and Helen Hinckley, but was
very profuse in his expressions of sympathy when he
was presented to the wounded scientist.

âAh, friend Julio, I could not resist coming to see
you, after hearing of your terrible accident. Gentlemen,
I recognize in this unfortunate man a friend of my
youth. I beg of you to let me attend him. I have
no business at present, and your duties are many.â

Questioning glances passed between Helen Hinckley,
Guillermo Gonzales and the Governor. Even Juan felt
that something was radically wrong, and as he looked
from one to the other with a hopeful expression in his
face, he turned away, and as his eyes fell upon the
face of Doctor Jones, he shook his head, which confirmed
all that his suspicions had been aroused, and he

216
evidently believed Doctor Jones to be the suspicions person.
The two strangers did not accept the chairs
offered them, and all in the room remained standing.

Doctor Jones, seemingly unconscious of the suspicions
his presence had aroused, continued: âIf my
medical skill avails anything, the son of SeÃ±ora Suzzan
Carriles, of Colima, shall not leave this existence
until the great work he is trying to accomplish is a
success. Until âMemory Fluid,â and the wonderful results
obtained by the use of it, are heralded from one
end of the universe to the other. It is a great and
noble cause for which you are working,âto see that
justice is meted to all. âThe Plunger from Kansasâ is
not the only one to whom justice will be meted out.
The ample proof at hand that he committed the great
cattle theft in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-eight,
and was then the cause of suffering and poverty
of many whom fortune favored in the way of helping
on retribution, by causing many whom he wronged, to
live another life at the same time the Plunger lived,
that this very thing for which you are working might
come to pass. Gentlemen, let me congratulate you, one
and all.â With that the enthusiastic doctor shook
hands with the three scientists and Miss Hinckley.
Everyone present except himself seemed to be very
much constrained.

He rubbed his hands in evident satisfaction, and as he
sat down by Julioâs bedside he continued: âYou will do
me a very great favor not to linger here any longer.
Others need your services badly. It will give me much
pain to leave the son of SeÃ±ora Suzzan Carriles, of

217
Colima. Sit down, Francis, sit down. I may need
you. Gentlemen, consider yourselves at liberty to go
now.â

Great astonishment was written on the faces of the
Governor, SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales, Miss Hinckley and
Juan. They were too much surprised at the audacity
of Doctor Jones to speak. Even Francis Maynard
showed great uneasiness as he took a seat near the chair
of Doctor Jones.

Governor Lehumada offered Miss Hinckley his arm,
and without a word they left the room, followed by
SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales, who tarried a moment to
give a few directions to Juan, and speak a moment with
his coworker, Julio Murillo.

When the three were safely in the Governorâs private
study, and the door securely locked, the Governor motioned
all to be seated. Standing in front of them he
laughed merrily, as he said: âIt was well for my
reputation that no stranger was present when
Doctor
Jones
invited us to leave our own apartments, and we
quietly obeyed without any comments whatever.â

Both SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales and Helen Hinckley
saw the humorous side of the occurrence and they
joined the Governor in his laugh.

âThe audacious seÃ±orita,â continued the Governor,
âis irresponsible for her actions.â

Miss Hinckley and SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales exclaimed
in a breath: âSeÃ±orita?â

âCertainly; Marriet Motuble. I do not believe it is
possible for her to effect a disguise I could not penetrate.â

218
âGovernor,â said Miss Hinckley, âyou have confirmed
my suspicions.â

âAnd mine,â added Guillermo Gonzales.

âThe young fellow with her I cannot quite make
out,â continued the Governor, with a puzzled look in
his face.

âThe fellow,â said Helen Hinckley, âis, I believe,
âThe Plunger from Kansas.ââ

âCan it be possible?â exclaimed both the Governor
and Guillermo Gonzales.

âThen we must not let him get away until we have
his full confession in writing, and a check for the full
amount of his obligations,â said the Governor.

âYou are quite right, Miguey,â said the Governorâs
scientific friend, and friend of his other life, âquite
right. Possibly if we had been able to present to the
public a month or so ago all the necessary proofs of
what we claim for âMemory Fluid,â the present trouble,âthe
uprising, I meanâmight have been prevented.
It is a horrible thing. Fifty persons now lie dead in
the morgue.â

âIt is a serious condition of affairs,â replied the Governor,
âfor the uninitiated, particularly, to be sent out
of this existence during such an unfortunate affair,
and without any insight whatever into the unseen.
Think of the misery they will unknowingly cause the
future generation. If it were not the law that each
must see the things not seen by the eye, before they
are fitted for the Realm on High, it would be fortunate
for those who will come in contact with them if their
reappearance here could be prevented.â

219
âI hope the poor creatures at the hospital who were
wounded and are in agony with physical pain, will
recover, that they may have a chance to know. If
your Honor and SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales will pardon
me, I will hurry to the hospital and tender my services,â
concluded Helen Hinckley, as she arose to leave the
room.

âOne moment, one moment, Miss Hinckley,â said
Governor Lehumada. âI will inquire how the wounded
are, and if your services are needed.â

The Governor stepped into the chamber adjoining,
built especially to condense thought waves, which were
made audible by holding a small cone-shaped instrument
to the ear which was connected at the smaller
end by means of a fine wire to the thought-condensing
board. In a few moments he returned to his study with
a very much pleased expression on his face. He
dropped into a chair, and throwing his handsome head
far back and his arms out and forward in a suppliant
manner, cried: âGreat Cause, thou everlasting Ruler,
the Promoter of Harmony, and the Distributor of Justice,
I am happier this moment than at any other period
of my existence to my recollection.â

Helen Hinckley and Guillermo Gonzales looked
quietly on, but neither spoke.

After his exclamation was completed he looked at his
friends smilingly, and continued: âMiss Hinckley, and
friend Guillermo, this is a victorious day for us. I
have this moment heard from the head physician at the
hospital, William J. Matling. He says that only two
of the fifty wounded will pass away. He further states

220
that their blasphemous cries and threats against myself
and my able coworkers which filled the air with horror
for an hour or more, have subsided, and they are either
in a state which resembles a trance, or are relating
strange stories, and now and then one shouts: âI am
happy. I know what it is to live. I see the things not
seen by the eye and hear things not heard by the ear.â
He further says that a strange child, who declares she
is his Honorâs Catalina, has been going from one ward
to another, and to no one has she failed to talk a
moment. He requested the head nurse to have the child
taken away from the hospital; but every man protested,
and he allowed her to remain.â

âCatalina, the blessed one,â said Miss Hinckley; âshe
is determined on doing her duty in this life.â

âThe physician asked me to use my influence in removing
the child from the hospital. He said he firmly
believes she has bewitched the men, and when they come
out from under her spell they will be beyond his control,â
said the Governor.

âDoctor Matling is certainly one of the uninitiated.
Catalina should give him a whiff of âMemory Fluid,â
and he would understand the spell he thinks she has
cast over those men,â said SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales.

âI remember,â added Miss Hinckley. âShe had a
small basket on her arm this morning, in which were
several dozen small vials. She said they were full of
âMemory Fluidâ and she was going to give part of the
contents to each of the most vicious of the disturbers
of peace she could find.â

âThe dear, blessed darling!â exclaimed the Governor,

221
rising. âWe discoverers of âMemory Fluidâ certainly
owe that dear child an eternal debt of gratitude. Miss
Hinckley, I wish you to remain here for a few days;
your services are not needed at the hospital or on the
street. You can render me and the cause for which we
all are working, more direct good by staying here. The
trial of the unfortunate creatures who attempted to
rid this existence of my presence physically, I hope to
have take place in the near future. The capture of the
three instigators of this uprising is looked for at any
moment. The condition of the revolt outside of the
city is getting more serious.â

âAnd in the North and East, friend Miguey, does
not the President report the condition alarming?â
asked Guillermo Gonzales.

âHe does,â replied the Governor. âAnd the main
body of rebels comes from those who see the waning of
dogmatic teachings, on the one side, and the increase
of scientific investigations in the realm of spirit, on the
other. One cannot be forced to see the hidden. The
desire must be born within. And when the desire is
given birth, it needs strict adherence to right, a continual
reaching out for Truth, or little good is accomplished.â

âThese priests and pastors and the fanatics who follow
them are on the whole responsible for the condition
at present; but, Miguey, the final is the great victory
of the spirit; of the diffusion of knowledge of the
law of the unseen,â said Guillermo Gonzales.

âThe petition pending in the legislature of the United
States,â said Helen Hinckley, âfor a law to be passed to

222
the effect that all persons who claim to be âcalledâ to
preach what they call the religion of âJesus Christ,â must
either show that they have sufficient means to support
themselves, independent of the church, or can procure
employment in connection with their gospel teachings,
that they may not be such a burden upon the community,
as well as objects of especial charity upon their
particular church, is a great move in the right direction.
Also, that both priest and pastor be compelled to dress
while on the street in ordinary business clothes; that
the confessionals in the Catholic church be done away
with, and that all the priests, bishops, cardinals and
even the Pope, be granted the privilege of marrying;
likewise, all the women belonging to the various orders
of the church be granted the same privilege. This
will be, in my opinion, the beginning of raising the
standard of morals and the creating of a desire for spirit
knowledge,â concluded Miss Hinckley.

âI believe you were the originator of that petition,
were you not, Miguey?â asked Guillermo Gonzales,
in a voice which showed the great pride he had in his
friend the Governor.

âYes, I framed the petition,â replied the Governor,
âand I met with much opposition when I took it to
Washington and presented it privately to several of the
most unprejudiced senators and representatives.â

âWhy were they opposed?â asked Miss Hinckley.

âThey no doubt thought that such a law would interfere
with the religious beliefs of the people, and hence
be directly opposed to the Constitution of the United
States of America. Am I not correct, Miguey?â asked
Guillermo Gonzales.

223
âQuite true, quite true,â replied the Governor.
âThat was the first objection that was broached; but
I soon convinced them that such a law would in nowise
interfere with freedom of religious views. When I told
them that none but Mexican blood had coursed through
my veins since time out of mind, and how distinctly
I recalled the practices of the priests in my other existences,
in Mexico, how they used the confessional as a
means to frighten the people into submission and extort
money from them, and how they held themselves
up as shining lights of purity and virtue, when those
whose eyes were opened knew that their very thoughts
were seething masses of immorality, they promised
to investigate the truth of my statements before formally
presenting the petition.â

âAnd they have done so!â exclaimed Helen Hinckley;
âthey have done so, and the President who gave
it no ear at the start, is in favor of its becoming a law.
The full account of it is in the great daily
Chihuahuan
.â

âIs that true?â exclaimed the Governor.

âIt is, Miguey, and President Mortingo has, no doubt,
reached his present state of thought since becoming a
subject,â said Guillermo Gonzales.

âIf the petition becomes a law,â said Helen Hinckley,
âit will no doubt be attributed to the effect of
âMemory Fluidâ upon the President and the knowledge
your wonderful discovery is continually producing
upon mankind. The discovery of âMemory Fluidâ is
the wonder of this wonderful age of scientific investigations,
particularly in the spirit realm,â concluded Miss
Hinckley, as she glanced admiringly at the great Governor
of Chihuahua.

224
âI thank you very much, Miss Hinckley, and so does
my friend here,â said the Governor, going up to her and
taking both of her hands in his; âbut the truth is,
Guillermo, Miss Hinckleyâs modesty keeps her from
letting even her most intimate friends know of her own
great knowledge of Law. It was through her knowledge
of Law that my life was spared only this morning.â

âCan it be possible!â exclaimed Guillermo Gonzales.
âThis is the first intimation I have had of your life being
in danger.â

âJulio forbade anyone disturbing you while you were
receiving the messages from President Mortingo,â said
Helen Hinckley.

âThe facts are as follows, friend Guillermo. A
large crowd entered the mansion unknown to Juan or
anyone else on watch, intent on taking my life. A few
moments before they arrived, Miss Hinckley risked her
life by coming here to warn me. And while she was
telling me of the intentions of the rebels, the leader entered
my room where we stood. Without a momentâs
hesitation, Miss Hinckley whispered in my ear:
âCome; we will escape,â and following her instructions
I stepped upon the railing around the small balcony at
the south door of my apartments, and in an instant we
were out of reach of the bandits, moving through space
without a support, wholly and solely by means of her
knowledge of Law.â

âI congratulate you, Miss Hinckley; you must become
a member of the Royal Academy. Yours is a great discovery.
A knowledge of how to overcome the law of
gravitation has been sought for by the lettered and the

225
unlettered, lo, these many years. How happy I am
that you were destined to become the revealer!â exclaimed
Guillermo Gonzales.

âI attribute the greatest part of my ability to see the
law,â replied Helen Hinckley, âto the use I have made
of your âMemory Fluid.ââ

226

CHAPTER XVI.

A WRITTEN CONFESSION.

âA modest way of putting it, my dear young lady,
but we will not claim the credit in the least part of aiding
you to discover how to overcome the law of gravitation.
When we are once more able to resume in our
former quiet way, our scientific researches, I want a full
account of how this knowledge came to you and how you
accomplish the movement,â said Guillermo Gonzales.

âWith very great pleasure, SeÃ±or Gonzales, I will tell
you all I know concerning my ability to overcome the
law of gravitation. There is so much to be done for
the afflicted before this uprising can be quelled, that I,
no doubt like yourself, feel that our first duty is to
them,â concluded Miss Hinckley.

âUpon that very idea I have thought much, and now
wish to speak to you, my friends. Ah, but excuse me
one moment; a messenger is awaiting me in the
thought-condensing chamber,â said Governor Lehumada,
and at once left the room.

âIt is from Juan,â said Helen Hinckley, âthat the
message comes. He is no longer with Miss Marriet
Motuble.â

âHow strange, and yet it is not strange, that you
should have the power to procure that knowledge,â replied

227
SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales. âThat power has
always been denied me.â

Helen Hinckley made no answer to his remark, but
said: âHis Honor and Juan will be here in an instant.
His Honor wishes us to know all that has happened.â

Almost at that moment Governor Lehumada entered
the room, and a light knock at the door leading into
the hall, announced the arrival of some one else.
SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales opened the door, and as
prophesied by Miss Hinckley, Juan entered.

His face was ashen, and he trembled so violently that
he was placed in a chair by SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales.

âWhat is it, Juan?â asked the Governor, as he led
Miss Hinckley close to his chair. âWhat has frightened
you?â

âTell me,â said Juan, gasping for breath, âtell me,
do you know that the person who calls himself Doctor
Jones, is not a man?â

âWho is she?â asked the Governor, with a smile.

âThe big woman who has given me so many frightsâI
mean SeÃ±orita Marriet Motuble,â said Juan.

âIt is a fact,â replied Guillermo Gonzales.

âDo SeÃ±or Julio Murillo and Miss Motuble speak
any language but English?â asked Juan.

âJulio speaks the Spanish fluently. He is, you know,
of purely Mexican origin, like myself,â said Governor
Lehumada. âBut while I have never studied it in my
present existence, a complete knowledge of it came to me
after I used âMemory Fluid.â Also, Julio had a similar
experience. Tell us, man, what caused your great
fright,â concluded the Governor.

228
âYou had no sooner left the room, your Honor, than
Doctor Jones turned to me and asked if I understood
Spanish. I said no. Doctor Jones seemed pleased that
I did not, and said: âYou are behind the times, Juan.
You are a full-blooded Mexican. Take âMemory
Fluid,â that great âLiquid from the Sunâs Rays,â discovered
by one of your own countrymen, a blue-blooded
Mexican, and you will remember how to speak the language
of your ancient forefathers.â I had a small bottle
of âMemory Fluidâ in my pocketâyour Honor will pardon
me for taking it without asking your permissionâI
wished to become a subject without the knowledge of
anyone.â

The Governor replied: âYou were justified, Juan,
in taking the fluid. Your desire to become a subject is
sufficient excuse. Continue.â

âDoctor Jones immediately began talking Spanish to
SeÃ±or Julio. I put the vial containing âMemory Fluidâ
to my lips, and while I was hesitating about taking it,
I inhaled it freely, and before I was hardly aware of
my act I drank the liquid. Almost instantly I felt as
though I were someone else. Then a voice seemed to
say: âIt is yourself and you remember.â Then I heard
Doctor Jones say in Spanish to SeÃ±or Julio: âIt is
no use in trying to fool you, friend Julio; no use in the
least. Ha! ha! That is a good joke on me.â To
which SeÃ±or Julio replied: âI knew when your card
was brought in, that you were disguised as Doctor
Jones. Also this fellow whom you introduced as Francis
Maynard, is in disguise. He is the âPlunger from
Kansas.â Ah, SeÃ±orita Motuble, your little tricks are

229
known not only to myself, but to Governor Lehumada
and SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales.â The âPlunger from
Kansasâ jumped from his seat, grabbed for his hat, and
cried: âSeÃ±orita, I must make tracks out of here.â
SeÃ±orita Motuble laughingly cried: âThe cat is out of
the bag, my friend, so we will face the music!â SeÃ±or
Julio looked at the Plunger, and said: âBe seated, sir.
No harm can be done you. You are beyond the pale
of civil law. There is no law, civil law, I mean, in the
United States of America, that can cause a man to be
arrested and punished for crimes committed in a life
gone by. There will be a law some day to that effect,
and you, my friend, will be the main instrument in
making the law.â Marriet Motuble arose, walked the
floor, her thumbs thrust into a pocket on either side of
her mannish jacket, and fairly screamed with laughter:
âFriend Julio, I knew I would be the means of making
the Plunger as famous in this life as he was one hundred
and fifty years ago, by stealing; or, to be more in
line with the popular phraseology of the time, as he
was by manipulating successfully the sale of cattle,
which he had mortgaged as many as six times without
lifting any one of the mortgages. This is a great world,
and to use the slang of the nineteenth century, I will
add that the Plunger always gets there, even if it is on
âthe home stretch.ââ The Plunger smiled, and said:
âI am uneasy. Your words do not give me the assurance
I would like to have. The mental torture I have
undergone for three existences is enough punishment,
without the clutches of the law being thrust upon me.
I desire to make a written confession of my misdeeds,

230
refund the money I took from my credulous friends,
and call it quits.â âIt will be a glorious day when that
comes to pass, for the scientists who discovered how
to extract liquid from the sunâs rays will prove to the
world the use to which their âMemory Fluidâ can be
put,â said SeÃ±or Julio. SeÃ±orita Motuble patted the
Plunger on the shoulder, and said: âThat is correct,
sonny. Go up to the mournerâs bench and confess your
sins. Friend Julio, let me go after Rev. J. T. Note.
Pleading with sinners at the mournerâs bench when they
are on the eve of being converted, is not in your line.
And the reverend gentleman is in his glory when making
a convert.ââ

âAh, but she is an audacious woman,â said the Governor.

âConsidering that she âremembers,ââ joined in SeÃ±or
Guillermo Gonzales, âmakes the question of what disposition
to make of her a serious consideration.â

âMy friends,â said Helen Hinckley, âdo not give
her one momentâs thought. She will dispose of herself.â

âWe will take your advice, Miss Hinckley. We will
give our attention to other matters, and hope that the
aggressive seÃ±orita will dispose of herself to our satisfaction
very promptly,â said the Governor. âIs there anything
more, Juan, which you wish to relate?â

âNothing more, your Honor, except that the Plunger
is in an adjoining room writing his confessions, and the
seÃ±orita has left SeÃ±or Julioâs apartments.â

âIn that event,â said SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales, âI
will attend to friend Julio.â

231
At that moment a despatch was announced by a servant,
and before it could be opened a service messenger
delivered a large, bulky envelope, which looked to contain
page after page of legal documents.

Juan left the room with the messenger and the household
servant, and hurried to Julio Murilloâs room.

The Governor handed the despatch to Guillermo
Gonzales. He tore it open and read:

â
Washington, D. C.

âIn every State where there is an uprising, the militia
will be called out to-morrow. If the rebels join
forces and organize a large army, the United States
troops will be mustered out, and in a fortnight the rebels
will be subdued. And in ten days longer, peace and
quiet will reign supreme âover the land of the free
and the home of the brave.â Dear Governor,â the message
continued, âthe effect of your âMemory Fluidâ on
me has been the most wonderful and delightful experience
of my life. A great wave from the spirit world has
swept over the entire universe, since your wonderful discovery
was made known. People are thinking, as they
never have thought before, to my knowledge. I congratulate
you upon the result you have obtained in your
scientific investigations, and I will aid you in every
way possible. I have seen the things not seen by the
eye and am convinced.

âCommand me. I am your obedient servant,

â
James Henry Mortingo
.â

âFrom more points of view than one,â said Governor
Lehumada, âI am happy to get that message.â

232
âAnd I,â said Helen Hinckley. âOne needs sympathy
in the spiritualistic world more than on the physical
plane. The former is lasting, the latter is transient.â

âThe results from our researches are being made
apparent sooner than I had hoped,â commented SeÃ±or
Guillermo Gonzales.

âWe have much for which to be thankful,â replied
the Governor, then added: âThis voluminous document
would better be opened now. Friend Guillermo,
am I not correct?â

âCertainly, Miguey. I will attend to it this moment;â
and SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales took the envelope
and without further delay opened it. âBe seated,
friends; there is much length to this document, and it
will be tiresome to stand through the reading of it.â

Governor Lehumada and Helen Hinckley sat down on
a small cane settee. SeÃ±or Gonzales seated himself in
a large armchair close by, and began reading the document
at hand.

â
His Honor, Mr. Miguel Lehumada
,

â
Governor of the Great State of Chihuahua
,

â
United States of America
.

â
Sir
:âAfter having read the article in the great
daily
Chihuahuan
, of to-dayâs issue, your petition in the
House of Representatives, which you are praying to become
a law; and after long and grave meditation upon
the same, I have reached the conclusion which you will
shortly know.

âRealizing for the first time in my life how fruitless
it is for me to dash my head against a stone wall, thereby

233
losing my own self-respect, and being the cause of keeping
hundreds in ignorance and want that I may live
in the lap of voluptuous luxury, and increase the number
of converts to our faith, and the number of
centavos

with which the exchequer of the church already groans,
I herewith write you this confession. For some time I
have seen the inevitable end of all teachings which conflict
with free thought scientifically demonstrated; but
I have followed the teachings of the church, and have
held on with the bulldog tenacity characteristic of the
faith,âthat same tenacity which led the few teachers to
the New Spain, which they held in their iron clasp for
more than four hundred years.

âBut light dawned upon them, and our power began
to wane. It is useless to fight for a lost cause, particularly
when you know that that cause cannot ever bring
good to the people.

âMy great friend, Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir,
and myself wish to hereby confess that we are guilty of
treason against our great government, and are fully resigned
to accept without a murmur the full punishment
of the law. It was a bitter struggle for us, for two
people who were taught, since remembrance began, to
worship the religion and customs of our long-lost Mexico,
to hate our adopted mother and all her fair sons and
daughters, because of their Anglo-Saxon blood.

âGreat and noble Governor, we are repenting to-day
in âsackcloth and ashes.â Do not judge us too severely,
for we are not wholly to blame.

âThere are many things which weigh heavily upon
my mindâthings for which I cannot account, or rather,

234
impressions of things which have occurred at some time
in my life which do not seem definite to me.

âSince I began writing this confession, a beautiful
little girl has come into the room, and on entering exclaimed:
âAh! I have found you leaders of this riot;
I have found you.â (We are in a vacant house at the
foot of Calle de Hidalgo, in hiding.) âAnd now that I
have caught up with you, I have not the heart to let the
police know, for they will imprison your bodies as your
souls are now imprisoned. Imprisoned on account of
your own stubbornness and ignorance. Gentlemen,â continued
the pretty child, âwhy do you stand in the way of
your own development? It makes me weep to see you
caring only for physical enjoyment. Why did you bring
on this rebellion? Why did you want to take my papa
away from this existence? His work is not done.â

âI interrupted her by asking her name; she replied
modestly: âI am called Catalina Martinet, but his
Honor, Governor Miguel Lehumada, should be my papa,
and he will be some day, and that day I wish were here
now.â Rev. J. T. Note, sitting close by, said: âThatâs
a corker! This child must have taken some of that
accursed stuff that the three citizens of Chihuahua, who
claim to be scientists, call âMemory Fluid.â Say, little
Catalina, the freak who wishes she had been born the
child of the great and wonderful Governor of Chihuahua,
tell me, how can you prove that you are not his
child? And come, darling, sit upon my knee, and let
me hear thy musical voice tell about the other lives you
have lived. For if you are a disciple of the famous
Governor, you claim to have lived many, many times.â

235
Then chuckling her under the chin, he continued:
âCome, pet, tell the Rev. J. T. Note all about it. Of
course he believes every word you say.â

âCatalina surprised us all by saying: âNo, Reverend
Hypocrite, I will not talk about things you cannot understand.
Excuse me, I can only say I am sorry for you
from the bottom of my heart. Should you ever be inclined,
take a few drops of the contents of this vial; then
you will see things not seen by the eye.â

âHanding his reverence, myself, and my friend, Don
Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, a similar vial, she left
the room. Our brother of Protestant faith made the
air reverberate with exclamations not complimentary to
the child, yourself, or your coworkers, Mr. Guillermo
Gonzales and Julio Murillo. Without his knowledge
the cork came out of the vial he held in his hand, and
unconsciously he inhaled the liquid. In about one
hour he fell forward in a senseless state. We were
afraid he was dead, and with the assistance of Don Francisco
R. Cantu y Falomir, I laid him on a bench near
by. We were soon relieved of our anxiety. In fifteen
minutes he arose, and after looking at us for a moment
in a dazed manner, said: âI cannot face the world
again, gentlemen, for I feel too heavily the force of the
long life of sin I have led, not only in this existence,
but in the life gone by. Gentlemen, the truth is, I

remember
. My spirit is crushed and bleeding. Oh,
thou Everlasting God! Take me to Thy bosom, that I
may soon return and live the life, the example for which
You set for us in the beginning. Help me to the bench
again, gentlemen, help me. A great force has taken
possession of me which I cannot resist.â

236
âWe assisted him to the bench, upon which he
stretched himself full length. His face shone with a
smile surpassingly beautiful, and in a moment his soul
had left its house of clay.

âMy hand trembles, your Honor; I fear I cannot continue.
Both Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir and
myself will in one second take âMemory Fluidâ from the
little vial given us by the strange child, Catalina.
One moment more, your Honor, before taking âMemory
Fluid.â A strange, large, fair-haired woman came in
unannounced this very moment. On seeing Rev. J. T.
Note lying silent, she said, making much noise with her
loud talking and laughing: âBrother Note has passed
over. The grand panorama, full of sights of his sinful
life, which passed before his vision after taking âMemory
Fluid,â staggered him so completely, on seeing a picture
of the multiplicity of his sins, that he knew he could
hardly rally, and he asked to pass away, that he might
come again. And he will come; there is no getting rid
of
him
, but I will wager a picayune he will not be a
missionary a third time. He has sinned and he has repented;
now he
sees
. Gentlemen, the object of my call
is to present you with a vial of ebony fluid. It is an
easy way to preserve your figure after you
will
to pass
over the river Styx. Good-bye. If my friend and lover,
the great Governor of Chihuahua, asks for me, tell him
I am at the hospital, but will soon be taken to the
morgue.â

âShe is gone. We have drunk âMemory Fluid.â My
pen drops away. I see. Thank God, I see!

â
Father Hernandez.
â

237
After the reading of the strange confession was completed,
the two scientists and Miss Hinckley remained
completely absorbed in their own thought for some time.

SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales walked the room, back and
forth, rapidly, many times. The shadows of the early
evening were fast crowding over the room, intensifying
the somberness of the scene.

âThe reading of the document has simply overwhelmed
me with joy,â said Governor Lehumada, as
he wiped visible moisture from his eyes.

âIt is sufficient cause, dear Miguey, if it be true,â
said SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales.

âIf it be true!â exclaimed Miss Hinckley; âif it be
true! The authenticity of it cannot be doubted.â

âOh, I thank you, Miss Hinckley,â exclaimed the
Governor, âI thank you very much! You relieve me
of the terrible fear with which friend Guillermoâs words
seized me.â

âI have not the power to see the world of thought, as
Miss Hinckley has. Forget not, my friends, the short
length of time I have had the power, my age at present,
and the grossness of my body, caused by a long life of
voluptuous living, and judge me accordingly.â

âThere is no grim judge, Guillermo, in the physical
world, who has the power to judge of the unseen. And
the Great Cause is not grim, but is the embodiment of
justice and kindliness,â replied the Governor.

âWhat you have always shown me, dear Miguey. I
sometimes shudder at the thought of what my future
existence would have been had I not
remembered
in
this life. I owe all of it to you, dear friend of my other
life,â said SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales.

238
âDo not let
fear
enter your thoughts, SeÃ±or Gonzales.
The Supreme is the completion of Love. To
those who are wholly in touch with the Hidden
fear
is
a word unknown,â said Miss Hinckley.

âWe do not know Law as you do, Miss Hinckley.
The privileges long accorded man and denied women,
have made our beings less easy to be in tune with the
spirit world. A good woman, a pure womanâpure in
thought and actionâone who reaches out daily for
knowledge of lifeâthe life of Love and harmonyâis
the highest type of creation the world can produce. To
me, friend Guillermo, Miss Hinckley is that type; she
is the other life I have longed to meet on earth. She
is the one for whom I sought in two lives gone by,
and on account of the grossness of my nature I was unable
to find her. Yet the knowledge of her existence
possessed me constantly, and I searched in vain.â

âYou were not wholly living upon the physical realm,
my own,â said Miss Hinckley, with much feeling.
âYou were then endeavoring to discover a means to
perpetuate memory. You told me through the thought-world
of your desire. I hoped for you, I lived for you.
I worked to perfect my life, so when you could
see
me, I
would be worthy of your great love.â

Don Guillermo Gonzales reached forth his hand and
clasping the Governorâs hand, warmly said: âMy
Miguey! My beloved friend of my other boyhood and
manhood, this approaches the completion of earthly happiness!
She is the other self. She alone can satiate
the longing of your soul. Without her, your life is
incomplete.â

239
Taking Miss Hinckley by the hands, which he kissed
fondly, he placed them in the large, strong ones of his
friend, the Governor of Chihuahua, and said: âMiguey,
a parting must never be. She is the power behind
the throne, that has kept you from evil and led you in
the path of purity. To her is due the success.â

âNo, no,â cried Helen Hinckley, through her tears.
âSeÃ±or Gonzales, do not, do not overestimate my knowledge
of the law of God. I am only a creature of the
earth, who lives not the highest law of God, but the highest
she knows. Do not attribute to me qualities I do
not possess. Your Honor, I entreat you to see things
only as they are.â

SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales stepped nearer to Miss
Hinckley, and addressing the Governor, said: âWith
your permission, Miguey, I will bestow a kiss upon the
brow of your future wife.â

The Governor did not answer him in words, but gave
his consent by a nod of the head, and said: âMy Helen,
he is my brother, the one I love next to you. His life,
next to thy own, is more in tune with mine than that
of any other being upon earth. He has kept me from
falling by the wayside, when my physical life was too
rank to feel thy beautiful influence, before my eyes
were opened.â He gently wiped the tears from her
eyes, his hand trembling with emotion.

SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales embraced her after the
fashion of a devoted father, and bestowed a kiss of respect
and admiration upon her brow. Then, turning to
the Governor, he embraced him after the fashion of the
men long, long ago in Mexico, before it became a part
of the great United States of America.

240
Governor Lehumada clasped the bride of his past, his
present, and his future physical and spiritual life, in his
arms, and whispered in her ear:

â
Thou art my other life I have longed to meet,

Without which life my own is incomplete.

Oh, dearer, sweeter self! Like me thou wert astray!

Straying, like me, to find the breast

On which alone can weary heart find rest.
â

CHAPTER XVII.

VIEWING THE EBONIZED BODIES.

About noon the next day Governor Lehumada, in
company with Helen Hinckley and Guillermo Gonzales,
was returning from a professional and scientific call
upon the head physicians and surgeons of the public
hospital, when his vehicle of transport was called to a
halt.

SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales opened the door as a civil
messenger appeared at the side of the vehicle.

The messenger handed him an envelope and said:
âHis Honorâs presence is desired at once.â

Helen Hinckley asked: âAt what place is the Governor
wanted?â

âAt the morgue. Anything further, Miss?â asked the
messenger.

âNothing further; we will go at once.â

The messenger disappeared. Guillermo Gonzales requested
the motorman to move the vehicle near the pavement,
out from the crowd of the street, while he examined
the contents of the envelope.

He tore it open quickly. He drew out first a bulky
letter, written on black paper. He turned it over, and
read: âMarriet Motuble.â

âFrom the aggressive seÃ±orita,â said the Governor.

242
âHere is another letter. It is signed âSeÃ±orââno,
there is a line drawn through it and through the word
âFather,â under it,â said Guillermo Gonzales.

âIt must be from both Don Francisco R. Cantu y
Falomir and Father Hernandez, then,â smiled Miss
Hinckley.

âYour surmise is correct, Miss Hinckley; see, it is
signed: âFrancisco R. Cantu, a citizen of the United
States of America; Alberto Hernandez, an American
citizen.ââ

A smile was visible on the faces of the three occupants
of the cab. Miss Hinckley said: âThey have become
metamorphosed since taking âMemory Fluid.ââ

âI will read what they have to say,â continued Guillermo
Gonzales; âthere are only a few pages.â

âDo; then we will hurry to the morgue,â said Governor
Lehumada.

âMarriet Motuble, or her body, will most likely be
found at the morgue,â Helen Hinckley added with a
smile.

The scientist Gonzales unfolded the written sheet,
and read:

â
Your Honor, the great and noble Governor of
Chihuahua
:âI greet you! When you receive this I
will be in the other great and only real world, sent hence
by the use of your disintegrator, the power of which
is known to none better than yourself and your able scientific
coworkers, Mr. Guillermo Gonzales and Julio
Murillo. Early this morning we went to the public
house for the dead, to which place we had sent the Rev.

243
J. T. Note, yesterday, to see if that strange and erstwhile
aggressive and very large, blonde womanâMarriet
Motubleâwas there as a spectator or herself a spectacle.
In the latter condition we found, and greatly to our surprise,
the âinvincible seÃ±orita,â as we often spoke of her.

âHers is now a massive body of ebony, and as hard as
a rock called flint. On seeing her thus, so serene and
placidâthe physical preserved, aye, for all timeâthe
soul which had its abiding-place in her, goneâwinging
its way through space, frolicking here and there like a
happy schoolboy dismissed from his tasks, we envied
her; for we had begun to
remember
! I knew herâmuch
the same as she was yesterday, and to-day in looks
and actionsâin a life gone by.

âDo not blame her for her strange doings, for back
of all of them was a kind and generous heart. Her
position on earth throughout two existences was the result
of a misconception of sex. Her spirit was in the
wrong house. It should have been in a house of the
masculine gender.

âPoor creature! The note enclosed, which she sent
to me, speaks of her knowledge of the mistake. Her
letter I trust you will read at your leisure, fully and
carefully.

âOne thing more I wish to say to you, then myself and
my friend Francisco R. Cantu, who at this moment is
writing his will, and a confession to be sent to his family,
will desire physical oblivion, and our souls will be set
free.

âYour able coworker and friend, Julio Murillo, is the
son of SeÃ±ora Suzzan Carriles, of Colima, and myself

244
in another existence. She was a great worker in the
church and a frequenter of the confessional. She was a
true, pure woman, who looked up to me next to her God.
I took advantage of her credulity. I asked her to grant
the desire of my heart, which I told her I did not consider
sinful, and if she felt any remorse of conscience, I
would absolve her from all sin. I will make no further
statement than that she believed me. What is the use
of my telling you more about this matter. You were
the then Governor of Chihuahua and brought me before
the bar of justice, on evidence furnished by Marriet
Motuble. I was condemned. Rather than face the decree
of the State, I departed that life by means of my
own hand. I was what they called in that day a suicide.
Could I have been made to remember in that life,
look at the misery I would have escaped in this life!
And the shame and degradation I have subjected myself
and followers to, is a nightmare to me. When you have
finished this, I pray you, my friend, thou who hast
left the gates ajar that I might see the beauties of the
soul; of the spirit life, that I might remember, and save
the world the misery from the unholy teachings I have
been drilling into my stupid followersâstupid because
I made them so by keeping them in submission and the
knowledge of all light away from them, I pray you to use
our bodies, soon to be a mass of ebonized flesh, as a specimen
in your Natural History department of the
Museum, to demonstrate the use to which your Ebony
Fluid can be put. The great wrong we have done you
and our dearly beloved America by stirring up these
revolutionary sentiments, only ourselves can appreciate.

245
In a way good will result. The wonderful results obtained
by the use of âMemory Fluidâ will be more fully
and quickly made known to the world. Our testimony
as herein stated will be made known to the world to-morrow
through the great daily
Chihuahuan
, with
which, and the personal and written testimony of the
âPlunger from Kansas,â your evidence will be complete,
and the petition which you are now hoping to present
to the State of Chihuahua soon, asking for it to become
a law, will meet with hearty approval. Then a great
day of reckoning will be at hand; for all now living
who committed crimes in lives gone by, will be called
to the bar of justice. I predict the demand for âLiquid
from the Sunâs Rays,â to be so great, that laboratories for
the extraction of this liquid will be established all over
this world. Ah, while I have been writing, my friend,
having his will and confession completed, has taken
âtime by the forelockââwilled his soul hence. The
vial of Ebony Fluid is empty and is tightly clutched in
his hand; his soul has winged its flight, his body will
soon be a form of ebony, and I am alone.

âCome, dear friend, to the morgue at your first leisure,
for at this moment the vial containing Ebony Fluid is
being emptied into my mouth, and I am willing my soul
away, and with the soul of my friend I will be soon.

âGood-bye, and much luck! I will see you again in
another life. Good-bye.

â
Francisco R. Cantu
, a citizen of the United States
of America.

â
Alberto Hernandez
, an American citizen.

âP. S.âI requested my friend in the beginning to

246
sign this confession with me, as we had talked over what
we thought the strongest points to make in the document.
For me it is exceedingly fortunate that I secured
his name to this sheet which served for the last page,
before I began the recital, or he would at this hour
have been beyond the power of mortal, to pen a line.

âA. H.â

âThe righting of wrongs could not have been so
satisfactorily settled by the civil law. It is the influence
of the Great Unseen that has brought this about,â
said the Governor, as their vehicle sped rapidly toward
the morgue.

All morning, before starting to the hospital, the
Governor had been in constant communication with the
Federal authorities at Washington. Reports to the
effect that the rebels were increasing in power in many
States, and that the depredations being committed upon
the property of public officers in particular, and many
inoffensive private citizens in general, were now almost
hourly occurrences, had been the cause of many small
affrays between the rebels and the State militia, in which
many lost their lives and others were wounded, on both
sides. It was believed by the authorities in Chihuahua
that when the sad end of the instigators of the trouble
had become known, that an early abating of the hostilities
would occur, which would result in terms of peace
being effected. The manipulators of the presidential
campaign and the lobbyists out for booty, prayed for a
continuation of hostilities; for they believed the hold
they had lost, when James Henry Mortingo became Presidentâwhen

247
âpartiesâ lost their holdââwhen the plum
was taken by a strayââ(as those who felt sore from the
result of the election expressed themselves)âwould be
made strong again, from the very fact of the rebellion
that had arisen, and the part the President played in
it. Many claimed that they did not believe any rational
beings would be in favor of electing a man to the Presidency
of the United States of America, who publicly
confessed having been a âSubjectâ on whom âMemory
Fluidâ was used, or one who believed in it and thought
it to be the greatest discovery the world had ever known,
and that through its use the world would be taught about
and brought to see and to experience the highest laws
of God.

The fame of Julio Murillo had gone abroad. His
name, at the head of long columns in almost every newspaper
in the land, was printed in flaming red letters.
He was spoken of as more of a prophet than any recorded
in the Bible or any other religious book.

Helen Hinckley and Catalina Martinet both received
their share of criticism, of ridicule, of praise.

Catalina was caricatured in various ways, and in each
she was in a different way giving âMemory Fluidâ to
humanity, who were grovelling at her feet and beseeching
for it.

Helen Hinckley was represented in one paper as a
beautiful, fair-haired, young woman, suspended high in
the air, and looking down with scorn upon the awestricken
people.

In another she was gliding, with Governor Lehumada,
out of a door that led onto a balcony, from the second

248
floor of the Governorâs Mansion, into space. All of
these things were commented upon by the Governor,
Miss Hinckley and Guillermo Gonzales as they hurried
to the morgue.

Hundreds of people were on the outside, eager to see
the four suicides, all of whom had been guilty of treason
against the United States of America.

As the Governor and his party alighted from the
strange, circular cab, the throng drew near, and it would
take volumes to hold the remarks passed by them about
the vehicle, the Governor as a public officer, as a
scientist, and strange to say, as a lover.

Equally eager were they to catch a glimpse of Helen
Hinckley, and numerous were the criticisms passed upon
herâupon the woman who, if reports were true, would
soon be the Governorâs wife; upon the woman who, so
far as they knew, was the sole possessor of the knowledge
of how to overcome the law of gravitation. It was quite
evident that everybody considered the Governor, his
prospective bride, and his two scientific coworkers, a
queer lot.

Amongst the large crowd of ultra-fashionable people
who held tickets which would admit them to the public
temporary carnal-house, when the examination by the
law had been concluded, was Mrs. Grange, with her
enamoring graces. She was giving some fashionably
dressed men near by, the benefit of her first impression
of the Governor and Miss Hinckley. At the same time
she was coquetting with her eyes, in the hope, no doubt,
of getting another promise from someone to help get
her husband a higher salary.

249
The Governorâs party heard the remark, âIt is a
shame, Mrs. Grange, that a woman so surpassingly beautiful
as yourself, is not the wife of a millionaire. I believe,â
continued her flatterer, âthat you have been a

subject
, and without any jesting whatever, I know your
engaging manners could induce the Governor to teach
you how to extract liquid from the sunâs rays. And having
been a
subject
, you could teach from your own experience,
and your husband could run the business.
Your names would go down to posterity then as renowned
scientists.â

âHow lovely,â smiled Mrs. Grange. âHow kind of
you to think of it.â

âNot at all, Mrs. Grange,â continued her admirer;
ânot at all. It would be much easier for you to tell of
its wonders and your own experiences, than to spend so
much sweetness canvassing for your husband. It is too
bad his voice failed. That is what I heard you say in
the year of eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, in
El Paso, Texas.â

Mrs. Grangeâs countenance fell, and she only gave
him a glance now and then from under her brow.

Not in the least abashed, the gentleman continued:
âIt was at the time that he was connected with some
road, less than one hundred miles long, that extended
from the Pass City, which was then, if you remember
your own expression, ânothing more than a rough border-town,
absolutely without any dramatic talent or
voice culture.â Oh, well, that is all past and gone,
Mrs. Grange; even the remembrance of the little dramatic
performance in which you displayed your enamoring
graces, is known only to the initiated.â

250
âThen
you remember
!â exclaimed Mrs. Grange, looking
at him with a frightened look in her face. âGreat
God! if others and others continue taking âMemory
Fluid,â and they look upon me with the scorn that
you do, and speak to me with the satire you do, I will
be tempted to take Ebony Fluid, after I learn to will
my soul away, that I may preserve the physical shape
of this life. I want to close the present life and have an
opportunity to come again, and then I will live the life
of a rational being. A thousand times or more my
heart has almost consumed itself with shame, since I
have
remembered
, at the thoughts of my actions in the
Pass City, and in this life also. Then I flaunted
myself before the public, flirted with men, drank beer,
wine, anything that would make me more livelyâdanced
and otherwise dissipated, until my life was wrecked and
my reputation gone. In this life I have done much the
same things, and added to them the accomplishment of

doing men
for all they were worth, under the pretence of
soliciting for my husband. Unfortunately for me, I
have the same one I had in the other life. He has gone
through much the same experiences, losing his voice and
all. Great God! I hope I may be spared in another
existence, the same family relations I have in this life
and the desire to be a professional beauty and a hypocrite
in general.â

âYou are saved, Mrs. Grange. The desire you have
this moment voiced, will be the means of your salvation,
if you at once change your mode of action to one that
accords with Law, and continue, to the best of your instruction,
to live in touch with the Unseen. I have often

251
thought that you were destined to be mine,â said the
gallant, rich and lettered man by her side.

Mrs. Grange gave one long gasp as she exclaimed:
âSince taking âMemory Fluidâ I have known it to be a
fact. In another life it will come to pass,â and fell
back amongst the crowd in a dead faint. A cab was
hailed and she was immediately taken to her home,
and a physician, who had knowledge of âMemory Fluid,â
sent to attend her; her gallant friend accompanied her.

Governor Lehumada, SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales and
Miss Helen Hinckley entered the room where lay the
physical transformation of the once invincible SeÃ±orita
Marriet Motuble, and the two instigators of the rebellion.

Prominent physicians from the city and neighboring
towns and States, who had flocked to the great capital
of Chihuahua since hearing of the wonderful discovery
of the scientists, were allowed to enter the room with
the Governorâs party.

The scientist, Guillermo Gonzales, examined the
bodies first. The Governor, with Helen Hinckley on his
arm, passed from one to the other and viewed them in
perfect silence.

Nearly one hundred physicians and investigating
scientists looked in turn with amazement upon the ebonized
forms of the three bodies before them. The Rev.
J. T. Note, cold and stiff in the hands of death, lay at
the far end of the long death chamber quite alone, and
forgotten by everyone present, except the Governorâs
party. When the last person had surveyed the ebonized
bodies, Guillermo Gonzales addressed them and said:

252
âYour Honor, Miss Hinckley, and friends, yonder
lies the dead body of Rev. J. T. Note, an aider and abettor
of the rebels. He is not dead by means of Ebony
Fluid, it does not cause the state called death,
but from remorse of conscience, the result of taking
âMemory Fluid.â He is, therefore, a fit subject upon
whom I can demonstrate to you the magic action of
Ebony Fluid. It is a knowledge of science we are working
for, and the sooner the power of this wonderful fluid
is made known to humanity, the sooner the present
microbic condition of matter will be extinguished. I
will have the body moved to the center of the room,
and I will immediately transform this seething mass of
microbes into a harmless body of ebony flint.â

Two attendants of the morgue entered at the request
of Guillermo Gonzales, and moved the corpse of Rev.
J. T. Note to the center of the room, and immediately
made their exit on being informed that their services
were no longer needed. Everyone stood as near the body
as possible, to watch the effect of Ebony Fluid upon the
corpse.

Guillermo Gonzales removed the sheet from the corpse.
Mortification had set in, and the odor escaping from
the body was, to express it mildly, exceedingly disagreeable
to the lookers-on. The scientist sprayed the body
with a powerful deodorizer, and immediately the offensive
odor was gone. Then, inserting a small tube into
the mouth of the corpse, he pressed a bulb to which it
was connected, and emptied the Ebony Fluid which was
in the bulb, into the body. The body jerked and
writhed, the face became contorted, and in all, was a
very grewsome object.

253
The most stoic of the scientists and physicians present,
turned their faces away to shut out from view the
terrible sight before them. It sprang into a sitting
posture, then fell back against the hard board with a
thud, the limbs rigid and straight. The physicians and
scientists looked inquiringly at Guillermo Gonzales and
Governor Lehumada.

âExplain, friend Guillermo,â said the Governor; âexplain
the action of Ebony Fluid upon animal matter.â

The scientist poured a small quantity of the fluid into
a thin glass, and holding it high in his hand, said:
âThe black fluid you see before you we call Ebony Fluid,
because of its color. The great struggle the corpse
underwent after the injection of this fluid into it, was
due to the struggle of the microbes trying to resist the
influence of the fluid. The battle was bravely fought,
but the microbes were conquered at last. Nothing in
life can resist its influence. See this body, only a few
moments ago repulsive to the sight and emitting an odor
so offensive to the smell, and rank with poison, that if
it were allowed to remain in a room for five minutes,
every occupant of the room who remained for that
length of time in the atmosphere of the poison, would
inhale enough bacteria to fill them with disease which
would eventually end their lives very shortly. The
action of Ebony Fluid after the death of the bacteria,
hardens, then petrifies the entire body. Assist me,
doctor,â continued the scientist, speaking to the physician
next to him, âto lift the body of Rev. J. T. Note,
and we will stand it in the corner.â

It required much effort for the two men to lift the

254
body and carry it to the wall. There they stood it erect,
and held it in place by means of a stout cord across
the shoulders, each end of which was fastened to a large
screw in the wall.

âNothing better illustrates the magical power of
Ebony Fluid than that figure,â concluded the scientist.

âAll day to-morrow, and next day, the morgue will
be open for the public to inspect these bodies,â said the
Governor. âWhile these gentlemen are present, do you
not think it is wise, Miss Hinckley, and friend Guillermo,
to read the confession of Marriet Motuble, that
creature whom we all considered so strange, so unlike
other women?â

Miss Hinckley replied: âYour Honor, it would be
just to them to hear the statements of Miss Motuble
read, after having viewed her ebonized body, and after
seeing the effect of the fluid upon Reverend Note.
There is no wanting of testimony in favor of the use
to which these fluids can be put; however, I am sure
it would be well for these men of science to hear the
statements of this seÃ±orita, which I am sure will be
interesting.â

âMiss Hinckley has spoken wisely, Miguey. I will
read the document without further delay. Be seated,
gentlemen, and I will begin.â

When he had placed three comfortable chairs near
together, on which he invited the Governor and Miss
Hinckley to be seated, he seated himself upon a high
stool, and began reading the confession. The densely
black paper and clear white letters made a curious looking
paper and was in itself exceedingly characteristic of
the author.

255
âReverend Father Hernandez and Don Francisco R.
Cantu y Falomir! Ha! ha! I laugh even in this last
stage of the game, at the thought of the title âReverendâ
and âFatherâ attached to the name Hernandez, and
louder and longer do I laugh at the title âDonâ preceding
Cantu, and the âyâ and Falomir following the name.
Say, gentlemen, there is no use in further pretensions
upon your part; they have a dead cinch upon you, so
you might as well walk up to the mournerâs bench and
take your medicine like men. What kick have you
against Uncle Samâs government? He didnât take you
under his wing because he wanted an addition to his
family. He took you because he was sorry for you, and
the most intelligent people of your race wanted to be
adopted.

âNow my purpose in writing this note is not to rake
up a bone for contention, nor do I write this to you because
I love you with all my heart and soul and
strength; for there are others whom I love more.
Whom I love so much that my heart is sore, and I cannot
pen him a line; but knowing this will reach him
through you, I rest content.

âTo the point: In my present and a former existence,
the ego of my life entered a habitation unwittingly
of the wrong sex. In other words, I should have been
born of the masculine gender. Such not being the case,
is why I have not been able in this life to find my counterpart.
In my first incarnation I wed a man according
to the civil law. I became the mother of six
children who grew up to be thorns in my side.

âIn this life I did not wed, because I thought the

256
great and noble Governor was destined for me, until I
became a
subject
; then my eyes were opened. Then I
knew I must live again in the castle of a man, before I
would meet the one who would be my counterpart physically
and in the realm of spirit.â

âHow strange, how strange!â exclaimed one of the
physicians present.

âIt is an entirely new thought to me and not wholly
without reason,â said another.

âShe often told me, when I met her in Chihuahua in
the year eighteen hundred and ninety-eight,â said Helen
Hinckley, âthat she felt a great injustice had been done
her by not being born a man. It seemed to be the regret
of her life.â

âPoor creature,â said Governor Lehumada; âpoor
creature! I sympathize with her from the bottom of my
heart. Continue, continue, friend Guillermo; I am
anxious to hear the last of this strange letter.â

âOn leaving you I went straight to the morgue. I
had heard that Rev. J. T. Note had passed over, and I
felt humanity was blessed. I viewed the remains over
and over. Afterwards I found a bench unoccupied; I
sat down. Near by was a young woman who had suicided
because her lover was false. Her soul was sent
forth to grope through the dark night in despair. My
heart ached for her; so I said I will go now, send my
soul forth and search for her. And as I gazed upon
her sweet, pure face, I knew she was intended for my
bride, had I been a man; and my soul cried out:

257
âGreat and everlasting Cause, guide me to her! Let me
find her and whisper the sweet story into her ear!â
Presently I heard a sweet, clear voice cry out in glad
surprise: âI hear you, Miguel. I hear you. Come;
I am by the fountain in the great public garden at the
outskirts of the city. Come; I now know it was you
for whom I sought. It was you upon whom my affections
were bestowed, and in my ignorance of law I
thought it someone else.â

âWhen no attendant was in sight, I stretched myself
upon a bench, and after willing my soul away, placed
the Ebony Fluid to my lips (for I wished my body to
be preserved). In one instant I will have swallowed it,
and my soul, now winging itself free, will seek its
counterpart. We both will be born again and together
we will meet you.

âI am Marriet Motuble in this life. In the next
life I will be
Miguel
. You will know me when I
speak.â

258

CHAPTER XVIII.

THE FLIGHT OF CATALINAâS SOUL.

Three weeks have passed since the city of Chihuahua
was shaken to its foundation by the suicide (the masses
knew no other term by which to call the act which had
caused their soulâs flight) of three people whose names
had grown to be household words.

And while their ebonized bodies were thought to be
grewsome by many, a greater part of the town had become
exceedingly scientific in thought, and they looked
upon them as the natural result of taking Ebony Fluid.

The revolutionists who had attempted the life of the
Governor were yet confined behind the bars. No conclusion
had been reached as to what disposition should be
made of them. The government of the State of Chihuahua
was strictly opposed to capital punishment, as
well as very reluctant in imposing a life sentence upon
anyone, no matter of what great crime he had been convicted.
The small revolutionary faction had grown
into a large army of rebellion and was now, according to
the best authority, marching onto the National capital.

The leaders of the dogmatic teachings of the churches
and their followers were determined, if bloodshed could
do it, to put a stop to the heretical teachings of the
great scientists.

259
They had opened up the battle; no free-thought person,
or scientific investigator had expressed himself
against the great army of parasites, except in words
of the greatest sympathy.

Julio Murillo was now able to be around in an easy-chair,
which was propelled by an automaton.

The President of the United States made no move,
without first consulting him, the great seer of Chihuahua,
as he was now called.

A presidential campaign was another theme for discussion,
and was the cause of many sleepless nights for
the regular âpullersâ of the two main political parties.

The Governor of Chihuahua, and his friend, were the
least concerned, perhaps, of any men in the United
States holding high offices, about the result of the presidential
campaign. They were more interested in the
cause of humanity at large; in developing in the heart
of each a desire to come in touch with Nature, with
God.

At an early stage of the presidential campaign, the
party who ran in the âstray horse,â as President Mortingo
was called by the two great political parties, were
so delighted with his
rÃ©gime
, in which there had been
but little intriguing; a rule which had become known
throughout the universe for its aid in extending, financially
and legislatively, scientific investigations, particularly
those which he believed would assist man in freeing
himself from the heavy chains which held him to his
physical environments, and they were determined to reelect
him, if no man of superior ability could be found.

Since the fame of the great Governor of Chihuahua

260
had traveled throughout the continent of America, and
hundreds rose up to give testimony to the effect of
âMemory Fluidâ upon them and the power it had of
bringing man in touch with God, the party which had
caused the election of President Mortingo, turned its
eyes upon Governor Lehumada as its choice for the next
President of the United States. During the last few
days he had been solicited by the new party which, as
if by magic, had grown to be of great power, for his
consent to allow his name to be used as a candidate
for the presidency of the United States of America.
After several hours of consultation with Julio Murillo,
Miss Hinckley, Guillermo Gonzales and the state officers,
he left the matter entirely in the hands of Julio Murillo,
at the suggestion of his dearly beloved
fiancÃ©e
, Helen
Hinckley.

SeÃ±or Julio sent word to the party which had done
the Governor of Chihuahua the greatest honor they
could offer, from a worldly point of view, that he wished
to wait thirty days, that the fulfillment of his prophecies
could be manifested, before making a decision for or
against the Governorâs name being used in the present
presidential campaign as a candidate for the office.

The public fumed and growled at the delay; yet it
was the inevitable, and there was but one thing to do;
to wait. The party who wished his nomination knew
there was some good reason why the delay was thought
necessary, and were satisfied, believing the answer would
be in favor of their cause, and at the end of the campaign
their candidate would bear the laurels.

In one of the revolutionary speeches made by the late

261
Don Francisco R. Cantu y Falomir, as he styled himself
with pride, he laid special stress upon the statement that
not since Mexico became a part of the great United
States of America, had a man of purely Mexican origin
been at the head of the nation. He claimed that the
prejudices the Anglo-Saxon race had against the Latin
racesâparticularly those of Spanish and Indian originâwere
the cause of their great men being kept in the
background. He even claimed that many of the best
people of Anglo-Saxon origin objected strongly to the
mixing of the blood by marriage. If such had ever been
the state of feeling, the fact that a strongly Anglo-Saxon
faction now wished to elect SeÃ±or Don Miguel
Lehumada, the present Governor of the great and famous
State of Chihuahua, a man through whose veins
none but Latin blood had ever flowed, to the presidency
of the United States of America, would forever stamp
out the erroneous idea that any prejudices existed.

Also a further proof of the fact was the marriage soon
to take place between Governor Lehumada and Helen
Hinckley, whose family had since time out of mind
prided itself upon its royal Anglo-Saxon blood.

What can more closely unite two nations than a
marriage for love between them? The eyes of the
whole world were centered upon these two people.
Helen Hinckley was called the great heroine of the
age, and the press never tired of lauding her bravery in
saving the life of the great Governor of Chihuahua,
even at the peril of her own life. That while she understood
how to overcome the law of gravitation, so far
as her own ability to propel herself through space was

262
concerned, it was a noble deed for her to risk her own
life in the way she did to save another.

The rebels seemed to have flown from the town which
was their starting point.

The fate of their leaders, no doubt had a great effect
in cooling the ardor of their revolutionary intentions.
Chihuahua was possibly, so far as the rebellion was concerned,
the most quiet capital in the Union.

In many other respects it was the liveliest, and it certainly
was the center of attraction of the scientific world,
and the great Mecca to which all great thinkers were
flocking, for whom it was possible to leave their business
and homes.

The great test case of âMemory Fluid,â which would
be decided at the trial of the âPlunger from Kansas,â
was causing an influx of legal talent as well as scientists,
free-thinkers, and students of the occult.

The fact that the Plunger had given himself into the
hands of the law for the settlement of the crimes he
committed in another life, when there was no civil law
covering the case, was considered within itself sufficient
proof of the value of âMemory Fluidâ to science. The
fear and trembling that took hold of some of the uninitiated
when they thought that they might have
been guilty of a crime in the past of which they now
had no knowledge and for which they would be brought
to the bar of justice, was certainly sufficient reason for
their greatly disturbed minds.

The large hotels in Chihuahua were fairly groaning
under the burden of caring for such a great number of
people which increased in number each day, all of whom

263
were flocking to the city with the same object in
view: That of hearing the trial of the most famous
case in the annals of man. To see the man who confessed
to the crime of which he was accused; to hear his
testimony of having lived through at least three lives;
to hear him confess to having known in lives gone by
the very people who bore witness against him; to see
the child, Catalina Martinet, who was conscious of having
lived another life and the tomb where she was
buried; the wonderful woman who had won the heart
of the Governorâthe woman who could suspend the
law of gravitation at will; the men who had discovered
âLiquid from the Sunâs Rays,â and to see the ebonized
figures in the Museum, was certainly enough to
draw the crowd that was gathering in the great city.

The morning on which the trial would begin, dawned
clear and cool. Long before nine oâclock, the hour
for opening the court, the halls and rooms adjoining
the great court-room were filled to overflowing.

The statutes of the States of Chihuahua did not cover
the hearing of such a case as the one about to be heard,
but a recent special legislation did. Many of the legal
fraternity were wondering if the case of âThe Plunger
from Kansasâ would be the means of establishing a
precedent which would make the special and temporary
legislation, a general and permanent act of Congress
in the near future.

Judge Ulloa, of the Supreme bench of the State, was
one of the most advanced thinkers of the age. His success
as a lawyer had been nothing short of marvelous;
at least that was the opinion of the public, but
he
knew

264
that his success was due to his knowledge of the âgreat
powers that be.â

The case in hand was to him a supreme moment, for
by special legislation it came under his jurisdiction. It
was generally known that President Mortingo believed
implicitly in the scientific revelation of Governor Lehumada
and his able coworkers.

Arrangements had been perfected whereby the President
of the United States, the cabinet, and many great
legal minds, who were not able to be in attendance at
the trial, could hear the testimony as it would be given
in the Chihuahua court-room, by means of the soundcondenser,
in their own private offices in Washington,
New York, or whatever city in which they lived.

When the great throng rushed into the court-room at
the hour of opening, the accused and the prosecutors
(the Governor, Miss Hinckley, Guillermo Gonzales and
Julio Murillo), with their respective attorneys, were
seated conspicuously near the judge, and all eyes were
immediately centered upon them.

For the benefit of the public, the great daily
Chihuahuan

contained a plan of procedure which the court
would follow in the case of the âPlunger from Kansas,â
in that morningâs issue, and now officers distributed programs,
which explained every step to be taken.

It was a new order of things, but so far, it was exceedingly
satisfactory to all concerned, and the public
at large.

The statement of the case was first called. The
attorney representing the scientists from one point of
view, and Miss Hinckley, who claimed to be one of

265
the injured in the great cattle robbery which occurred
nearly two centuries ago, from another point of view,
arose and said:

âYour Honors: The case for the hearing of which
we have assembled to-day is one, as you know, of unusual
occurrence, and is composed of such intricate
features that the gross or impure element of humanity
will look upon the testimony as out of the reason of
man. But when all
understand
, the full force of the
argument will be to them the most rational thing on
earth.

âThere is a divine law which proceeds from the
âpowers that be,â which says that there must be an adjustment
of all evil; if not in the life in which the sin
was committed, then it will be repaired in another one
of the lives which each person will live, until all evil he
has committed will be punished through self conviction.

âIn the case at hand, had it not been for the great discovery
of âMemory Fluidâ by the three renowned scientists
of our city, the âPlunger from Kansas,â yonder, who
committed the great cattle robbery in the year of our
Lord, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, would have
escaped repairing the mischief he did then until another
existence in the body. But when
memory
was restored,
and our renowned townsmen brought the influences of
the âpowers that be,â which cannot be seen by the physical
eye nor heard by the physical ear, to bear upon
the Plunger, he first became uneasy, then a knowledge
of his other lives dawned upon him.

âAt the first realization there was naturally a great
shock experienced. Then came a desire to escape the

266
ordeal which seemed to be first overtaking him, and the
âPlunger from Kansasâ flitted hither and thither, trying
to find a place where he would be contented. He
came to Chihuahua, the very city to which he fled at the
time in his previous life after he had committed the
crime.

âHis presence here was an assistance in awakening
memory.

âAfter hearing the statements of various witnesses,
we hope to close the case with a glorious victory in favor
of the great spiritual life each could live, if he only

knew
,â concluded the prosecution.

Catalina Martinet arose, when called to the stand,
and when asked to tell all she knew about the âPlunger
from Kansas,â said:

âIn that life gone by, of which you speak, I had the
misfortune to be born not according to law. Ignorant
of the cause of my birth, I lived the life of a happy
child up to the age of tender girlhood, when I learned
I was a child out of the pale of civil law; then my
great pride was crushed, my heart was broken, and I
passed away. I came again, however, and while I had
the misfortune to be born into a family inharmonious,
I am not an illegal child. I will leave again soon, and
when I return I will be in the most harmonious condition
for spiritual development.â

âThe child seems to wander in her thoughts,â said
the judge to the Governor.

âWith your permission, I will speak to her,â said the
Governor.

The judge replied by an inclination of his head, and

267
the Governor said: âCatalina, it is the story of the
âPlunger from Kansasâ the court wishes to hear.â

Catalina looked at the court dazed for a moment,
then going to the Governor, placed her arms around him
and said: âMy papa, I was unhappy a moment ago;
that is why I was telling of my misfortune. I will now
tell all I know about the âPlunger from Kansas.ââ

Exclamations of surprise, disgust and pleasure were
heard on every side, but when Catalina began to speak,
everything was severely quiet again.

In answer to the question from Miss Hinckleyâs
attorney: âDid you know the accused in a life gone
by?â Catalina replied: âI did, your Honor.â

âThen tell us all you know about him,â said the
counsel.

âOne cold, rainy night, a cab drove up to our house.
I heard it, and childlike I was anxious to know why
such an unusual occurrence was happening. My
mother opened the door, and Mr. J. Ecarg stepped into
the room. He often came to our house, and when he
did not have too much pulque he was pleasant. This
night he had had much, and told my mother there were
two men in the cab outside, and she must let them have
the only room we had with a bed in it. My mother
said she did not want them, and he told her not to be a
fool; that they would stay anyway, and she would be
well paid. They came. He did not give their names,
but the fellow who was trembling and crying, he afterwards
told my mother, was the âPlunger from Kansasââthat
he was hiding from people in the United States,
because he had stolen cattle from these people and sold

268
them. Mr. Ecarg threatened my mother in various
ways, if she ever told about the men being at her house,
what she saw them do, or heard them say. They often
had a Mexican lawyer and an interpreter; this lawyer
knew everything and gave them advice. I was often
in the room when he was there, playing with my dolls,
and I heard all they said. The Plunger gave me
centavos

often, and said he liked little girls. And he gave
me these pictures; this one is of him; this his wife,
and this his baby,â concluded Catalina, handing the
pictures out to the attorney, and seating herself beside
the Governor.

From one to another of the legal profession on the
rostrum the photographs were passed.

The accused was then asked to take his place, and the
attorney began a series of interrogations.

âWhat is your name?â

âI am called the âPlunger from Kansas.ââ

âHave you any knowledge of a previous life on
earth?â

âI have, your Honor.â

âDid you ever see this picture before?â

âIt is myself, long ago, though not unlike me now.â

âAnd this, and this?â continued the lawyer.

âThis,â exclaimed the Plunger, âis a splendid photograph
of my wife of long ago! Poor woman, how she
stayed by me during my trouble, until death claimed
her as his own. Ah; and this is the child we loved
and who never came again.â

âDid you know the witness just on the stand?â
asked the lawyer.

269
âI did, she is Catalina Martinet, and the image of
herself in the life gone by. J. Ecarg said, when he
took me to her motherâs, the night she spoke of, that the
child was his, and he helped to support the mother.â

Mr. Niksab was the next witness called. He testified
to his knowledge of the Plungerâs doings, his acquaintance
with Catalina and her mother, and verified
the statements previously made.

J. Ecarg next took the stand. He said he was repenting
in sackcloth and ashes for the many sins he
committed in that life gone by. He said the good Governor
would give testimony to the truth of his unholy
conduct in that life long since passed, of his relations
to Catalinaâs mother, and his connection with the
âPlunger from Kansas.â He said his time here was
short, but in a future life on earth, he would live on
a higher plane, because he
remembered
, and in consequence
he would profit by his past varied and unhappy
experiences.

At the moment J. Ecarg took his seat, a messenger
handed the Governor a note. After reading it, he
passed it to the judge, and in turn it was passed to the
lawyers on either side.

After a brief consultation was held between the
judge, the attorneys and the Governor, the lawyer for
prosecution said:

âFrancisco de UrdiÃ±ola will now take the stand.â

A tall, well built, dark-complexioned man, of commanding
presence and delightful manners, took the
stand.

âYour name?â asked the court.

270
âI am, your honor, Francisco de UrdiÃ±ola.â

âWhat is your occupation, and where is your place
of residence?â the court questioned.

âI have the honor of being president of the school
âFor Hidden Thought,â and my place of residence is
Saltillo, the city in which this school is situated,â
quietly replied the distinguished man.

âDo you know the accused?â asked the court.

âThe âPlunger from Kansas,â to whom you refer, I
have no acquaintance with now.â

âDid you in a life gone by; if so, tell the full circumstances.â

The stately man bowed and said: âThe court will
grant me a few moments to explain my position in a
life previous to knowing the âPlunger from Kansas.â
In the year of fifteen hundred and fifty, I commanded
an expedition against a tribe of Indians called the Chichimecas,
who inhabited all of Northern Mexico. I
came north as far as the beautiful valley of what afterwards
was known as Saltillo, at which place I founded
a city in the year of fifteen hundred and fifty-nine.
There I left twenty Spanish families, and as many of
the conquered Indian tribe. Going further north I
founded many other cities. Two years later I passed
out of life, but my entity guided the life of my son,
whom I aided in subduing the Indians in every way
possible; also in bringing sixty Spanish families to the
beautiful valley of Saltillo, and formally laying the
foundation of the city in fifteen hundred and seventy-five.
My son remained there for a quarter of a century,
tyrannizing over the conquered Indians, then

271
passed away. A craving for experience, no doubt, led
me to be born into my next existence in the United
States of America, although of Spanish parentage.
They belonged to the conquered of Mexico, and fled to
the United States in preference to returning to Spain.
Now comes the important part of my story. I inherited
from my father large tracts of land in the
State of Kansas. I engaged in the cattle business, and
was a heavy lender to dealers. The daring young man
known as the âPlunger from Kansas,â was one of my
heaviest borrowers. I trusted him, for I thought he
had too much self pride to prove false to me, being his
main stay. He was, like Julius CÃ¦sar, too ambitious,
and he fellâand by his fall ruined many families,
amongst whom was my own. I was no longer a young
man, and seeing nearly all swept from me without a
momentâs warning, I felt that I could not face poverty,
and without further ado I gave up the ghost. Still in
quest of knowledge, my spirit, now free, roamed the
world over in the hope of finding the open sesame. Up
to this time I had no knowledge of a previous life, but
I was conscious of having had experiences for which I
could not account. In the year of two thousand I
again became identified with physical life. And as my
experiences in spirit, although I was not cognizant of
them, fitted me to live on a high spiritual plane in the
physical, I became, at the age of fifteen, a student of
the occult, with the result you know. When I saw the
first accounts of the discoveries of your great Governor,
and that by means of âMemory Fluid,â he was trying to
find the âPlunger from Kansas,â and bring him to justice

272
by means of remorse of conscience, I knew that in some
way I was connected with him. For days I felt as if
my senses were leaving me, conscious that something
must be done, and done quickly. My silent appeal to
the Great Cause was answered, and I received a spiritual
impression from his honor, Professor Julio Murillo,
which said: âTake âMemory Fluid.â It will arrive by
the next express.â From that moment I was calm and
contented. Fifteen minutes after taking that wonderful
fluid, I lived in memory all my past existences, part
of which I have just related to you. Yonder sits the
âPlunger from Kansas,â and it is due to myself, Miss
Helen Hinckley, the orphan daughter of my bosom
friend in that time long since passed, and many others
who, no doubt, will speak for themselves, that he refunds
the amount of his obligations to us and its accumulations
for one hundred and fifty years. I have
nothing further to say, your honor.â

The great Governor of Chihuahua was the next witness.

He was not questioned, but was simply requested to
state what he knew about the âPlunger from Kansas.â
Much that has been related was repeated by him, to
which he added many spicy instances connected with the
life of the Plunger while he was a refugee from justice
in Chihuahua.

âShortly after arriving in the city,â said the Governor,
âhe sent me, by a private and confidential carrier,
his card, which was accompanied by two thousand
dollars in gold, which was equivalent then to nearly
five thousand dollars in Mexican money. I had no disposition

273
to accept a bribe, nor to help shield him from
the law. He fled from this city after several months,
and from accounts at the time he was lost at sea or by
pestilence; but by his own confession he was a suicide.
If his means is not sufficient to pay the debts he owes, I
hope the law will take all he has, and part of all he
earns, for employment he must get at once, until every
cent he stole from those who befriended him, is paid.â

Helen Hinckley told all she knew of the Plunger,
when she was a child, and he a frequent visitor at her
fatherâs house in Kansas City. She said that she was
left an orphan after he had robbed her father, and her
struggles for a livelihood, alone and unprotected, were,
even yet, when she thought of them, a horrible nightmare
to her.

No further witnesses were called, nor did others
present themselves.

Judge Ulloa announced that the testimony had been
heard, and the jury could absent itself and weigh it very
carefully.

During its absence a message was handed the Governor.
After looking it over, he arose and said: âThe
message in hand concerns everybody as much as myself.
It is from the War Department, and reads: âThe army
of the rebellion engaged in a battle with the United
State troops in West Virginia, at an early hour this
morning. The loss was heavy on either side, but the
victory is ours.ââ

For a few moments there was wild disorder in court,
and shouts of: âTruth will triumph,â came from
every side; for those who had been sympathizers with

274
the rebels before the trial began, were now thoroughly
convinced of their error, and strongly favored supporting
the Union and stimulating scientific investigations.

At the height of their rejoicing, the jury entered,
and the foreman announced that the vote was unanimous
in favor of conviction.

The Plunger was asked if he had any statement to
make. He arose and said: âTo escape the torture
of mind, soul and body to which I have been subjected
through this, the third existence, I will gladly give up
every cent, and work to pay the rest. I herewith hand
your honor checks to meet my full obligations to Miss
Hinckley and President Francisco de UrdiÃ±ola, and
part pay to others I robbed; the balance I owe them
will be paid as I earn it.â

A murmur of approval was heard throughout the
court-room. The judge dismissed the case.

When the crowd was on the eve of rising to leave,
Catalina Martinet arose, and throwing her arms out,
cried in a voice which startled everyone and made them
turn around: âGreat and Everlasting Cause, and all
the powers that be, my work in this existence, where
my home environments are so inharmonious, is done.
I pray you, let me depart, and come again. Now that
I
remember
, my next life in the physical will be of the
greatest contentment possible on earth; for I will be
his Honorâs child, and my mother will be Helen
Hinckley. Adieu, all whom I love and who are beloved
by me; adieu. I am gone but I will come again.â
She fell back, her spirit having fled, and the Governor
caught her in his arms.

275

CHAPTER XIX.

THE GOVERNOR MARRIED.

Julio Murillo had become such a well-known seer
by name, and also well known through the press, from
the fact that upon him alone fell the responsibility of
deciding whether the Governor would become a candidate
for the presidency of the United States of America
or not.

Now that the thirty daysâ time he had requested to be
given him, in which he could study the matter over,
was on the eve of elapsing, the public was in a state
of great excitement, in expectation of what the answer
would be.

The Governor and Helen Hinckley had been recluses
since the day of the trial of the âPlunger from Kansasâ
was concluded, and the child, Catalina Martinet, passed
away. She had grown to be very dear to them, as well
as a favorite with a great many people, particularly
those persons who were interested in scientific investigations.
By all she was missed. Had it not been for the
knowledge that she was with them in spirit, and would
come again in the physical life, her separation from
the Governor would be almost unbearable to him.
Helen Hinckley had remained at the Governorâs Mansion

276
since the day after she saved him from the clutches
of the rebels. She had no home since the trouble in
the family of Francisco R. Cantu, and he wished to
give her his protection.

She was now seated in her pretty parlor connected
with the suite of rooms she occupied in her future
permanent home, and was reading aloud to the Governorâs
housekeeper, a dear old lady of whom she had
grown to be very fond, the newspaper accounts of the
war.

âIt is only a question of a few more weeks until the
uprising will be subdued, and hundreds more will understand
the law,â replied Miss Hinckley, in answer to
a question propounded by her companion.

âThe paper says,â continued Miss Hinckley, âthat
if SeÃ±or Julio Murillo decides to-morrow that the Governorâs
name shall be entered as a candidate for nomination
to the presidency of the United States of
America, that the rebels will know their chances for
severing the Union will be smaller than at present, and
they will gradually disperse, themselves.â

âIs the question of whether he will or will not
allow his name to be used as a candidate for nomination
to the presidency, to be decided to-morrow?â
asked the housekeeper.

âThat is my understanding,â replied Miss Hinckley,
âand while I have not spoken to the scientist,
Julio Murillo, in regard to the matter, a knowledge
comes to me from within that he will report favorably,
and when the election takes place, his Honor will be the
next President of the United States of America. From

277
a material point of view, it is a great honor; but from
a spiritualistic point of view it is no honor.â

âDo you not believe,â replied her companion, âthat
the election of Governor Lehumada will be the means of
promulgating spiritual researches?â

âHis election is the only means now known that will
bring about that end. It is the inevitable, and his election
will take place,â replied Miss Hinckley.

At that moment a light knock was heard at the door.
At Miss Hinckleyâs request it was opened, and Juan
entered. He handed Miss Hinckley two cards, one
bearing the name of Julio Murillo, the other of Guillermo
Gonzales. On the latter was written: âWe are
requested by his Honor, to see you upon a matter of
much importance.â

âShow them in, Juan; show the gentlemen here at
once,â replied Miss Hinckley. âBut what is the matter?
You seem to be terribly distressed,â she concluded, as
Juan was leaving.

âOh, miss,â he cried; âthere is enough the matter.
I have taken more âMemory Fluid.ââ

âIs that all?â asked the housekeeper.

âThat is enough, quite enough; for I now
remember

too much,â replied Juan.

âThen you are one of us, Juan,â said Miss Hinckley.
âWhen the scientists leave, Juan, come and tell
us what you remember. I will not now keep you waiting
longer.â

Juan passed out, and the housekeeper arose to leave
the room. âDo not go!â exclaimed Miss Hinckley.
âI wish you to be present. The interview concerns the

278
marriage of myself and his Honor. He has been in the
most serious meditations since the flight of dear little
Catalinaâs soul. I have not seen him since the memorable
day, but I have constantly heard from him. He
says it is the physical over which he yet has not perfect
control, and that makes him mourn for dear little Catalina.
She has been with him in spirit since the moment
of her departure. And while he realizes that her passing
away will result in our mutual happiness, he still
grieves for her.â

A rap at the door interrupted her further comments
upon the subject. The two scientists entered, and after
a cordial greeting, Guillermo Gonzales said: âMiss
Hinckley, his Honor deputized friend Julio Murillo and
myself to ascertain from you the earliest date you
would consent to your marriage (already taken place
spiritually, with him) to be celebrated publicly, and by
the civil law.â

Miss Hinckley smiled and said: âThe civil law must
be respected, yet I feel so little interest in it, I will leave
the matter entirely in the hands of our friend, Julio
Murillo. The seer of the age is hereby appointed master
of ceremonies. Is that not a wise conclusion,
SeÃ±or Gonzales?â concluded Miss Hinckley.

âHis Honor, the Governor, will be greatly pleased,
Miss Hinckley, for as you know, the Governor trusts him
with all the affairs of the Government, and he is the
greatest seer of the age,â replied Guillermo Gonzales.

Without any embarrassment whatever, at the great
knowledge attributed to him, Julio said: âThe day set
to nominate candidates for the office of the presidency

279
of the United States of America, will take place on the
twenty-third day of this month. Governor Lehumada
will be nominated at ten oâclock in the morning. At
twelve oâclock the state marriage ceremony will take
place in the parlors of the gubernatorial Mansion, and
will be performed by Judge Ulloa, of the Supreme
bench. After the civil ceremony I will make the formal
announcement of your spiritual marriage, which took
place some time ago; after which, a reception will take
place, and many renowned people will be present, some
of whom will be from the spirit world,â quietly concluded
the great seer.

âFrom a human point of view I am delighted, and
from a sense of the fitness of the eternal, my soul is
contented, and cries out in great joy at the harmony of
my life. Tell his Honor I am conscious of his presence
always, and of his great love for me. It is to me the
âpeace of the soul that passeth all understandingâ; the
understanding, of course, of the
uninitiated
,â said the
Governorâs
fiancÃ©e
.

âTo-morrow,â said Guillermo Gonzales, âwill be announced
publicly his Honorâs intentions of becoming a
candidate for the office of President of the United
States of America.â

âAt the same time,â continued Julio Murillo, âthe
public announcement of the date of your and his
Honorâs marriage will be made.â

âI am content to leave everything to your judgment,
friend Julio,â said Miss Hinckley, extending her hand
to them as they arose to leave.

âThen you and his Honor will have nothing to regret,â

280
said Guillermo Gonzales, as they passed from the
room.

The Governorâs good housekeeper clasped Helen
Hinckley in her arms, and as she pressed her lips to
her brow, said, with tears streaming down her cheeks:
âI am an old woman; three-score years have passed
over my head, yet I have not the knowledge of which
you speak. Tell me, my child, tell me from whom can
I learn of the inner life?â

âIt can only come, my good woman, from an awakening
which must proceed from within, out. It is the
subjective life that must make itself felt. The great
Cause which lies back of the âpowers that be,â must
be felt, and that can only be done when oneâs life is in
tune with the great Cause.â

âBut how am I to tune my life with the Great
Cause?â was the next question.

âBy making the physical life subservient to the
spiritual is the first step,â immediately replied Helen
Hinckley.

âThen the taking of âMemory Fluidâ will do much
toward the desired end, I suppose,â said the housekeeper,
evidently much interested in how to become spiritual.
âTell me about that wonderful fluid, Miss Hinckley.
How did it affect you, and after what length of time?â

âJuan is coming, my dear woman. He no doubt
will be able to explain to you, better than I, the workings
of âMemory Fluid,ââ said Helen Hinckley, as she
drew her companion onto the sofa by her side.

As prophesied by Miss Hinckley, Juanâs steps were
heard at the door, and on being asked to come in, he

281
entered, timidly, and dropped into the nearest chair
without any invitation. Miss Hinckley smiled to herself
as she looked at him.

The housekeeper looked worried and said: âAnd
you have taken more âMemory Fluid,â Juan? Is that why
you are so sad?â

âYes, madam, that is the reason,â replied Juan.

âThen you regret having taken it,â was her next
comment.

âNot in the least,â replied Juan. âI would rather be
sad for a season and
know
, than be ignorant and happy.
For the happiness of the ignorant is not lasting. And
when one recovers from the shock, which first makes
them sad, of having learned the lesson, I fancy that no
worldly affairs can mar his happiness. I understand
now what dear little Catalina meant by
things not seen
by the eye or heard by the ear
.â

âTell us, Juan, of your other lives, if you have the
remembrance of any. Mrs. Serrano is interested in
âMemory Fluid,ââ said Miss Hinckley.

âThat is what I came to tell you; but I do not feel so
sad about what I know as I did a while ago. First
I took two tablespoonfuls of âMemory Fluid.â In three
minutes afterwards I was astonished to see myself a
little boy, walking down the street in South America,
holding the hand of the âPlunger from Kansas.â I
nearly fainted at the shock it gave me. I heard him say:
âPoor lad; his mother is gone. They are hot on my
tracks, after five years of dodging here, and were it not
for the lad I would end my existence now. What would
you do, son, if you had no papa to care for you?â he

282
asked, turning to me. I swelled up in great fashion,
and replied: âI would join the circus and be the
clown.â He was shocked, of course; no doubt, he
wished me to be a
plunger
like himself. Imagine my
feelings, Miss Hinckley, when I was forced to realize
that
I
was born into my first existence the son of the
âPlunger from Kansas.ââ

âYou were not to blame, Juan, and now that you
remember
,
see that in your next physical existence you do
not enter an inharmonious physical dwelling,â replied
Helen Hinckley.

âHow interesting,â added Mrs. Serrano. âTell us,
SeÃ±or Juan, did you join the circus and become a
clown?â

Helen Hinckley smiled at her inquisitiveness, and
continued: âCertainly, friend Juan, tell us all about
yourself in other lives.â

âI did, madam, and lived the life of a clown up to a
ripe old age. I broke my neck by turning a double
somersault, and died without the least pain,â said Juan.

âAnd did you live again before now?â eagerly asked
Mrs. Serrano.

âYes,â replied Juan, as he heaved a great sigh; âthat
calamity happened to me.â

âWhy do you call it a calamity?â asked Mrs. Serrano.

âBecause I presented myself into a family who were
intent upon opening up missionary schoolsâthat was
in Chicagoâand if they couldnât make the children believe
as they did, by giving them a sweet cake now and
then, they used a club, and the children said they believed
as they did whether they did or not. When I

283
was ten years old I heard my father say that he had
raked in five thousand dollars that year, over and above
expenses. When I told him he had committed a great
sin, he gave me a lick with a great club, over the back.
In about an hour my soul fled, and just before I passed
over, I remember I thought how glad I would be to get
rid of such a life. You can hardly imagine how conceited
I was about my past, before taking âMemory
Fluid.â I thought if I had lived at all, I certainly had
been a man of very great note. I even imagined
myself in one life Julius CÃ¦sar; in another George
Washington; and yet another, the great, though not
very beloved, Santa Ana.
That
was the cause of my
sad face when I first learned the truth. It was a great
fall for my feathers. I have knowledge now, and I do
not care for the vanities of life,â concluded Juan, as he
rose to leave the room.

âYou feel better, Juan,â said Miss Hinckley, âbecause
you have had a feast of the soul. You have been
in an harmonious circle for the last thirty minutes, and
it is the first time since your awakening. Many
people with good intentions are made demons, because of
inharmonious surroundings. As you grow strong in
the Light, we will enjoy many an hour together, Juan.â

Juan left the room with a bow and a âthank you,â
and Mrs. Serrano arose and walking the floor back and
forth in intense excitement, said: âMy dear child,
that story is divine to me. Show me the way. I must
know if I had a past existence.â

âI can do nothing more, Mrs. Serrano, than to get
you a little of âLiquid from the Sunâs Rays,â known as

284
âMemory Fluid.â If you take it, I feel quite sure that
you will not be disappointed in the result,â replied
Helen Hinckley.

âGet it, child; get it, and I will take it in honor of
yourself and the good Governor.â

While Helen Hinckley knew the good housekeeper
would take it mainly to satisfy her curiosity, she cheerfully
gave her a vial of the liquid, and said: âHave no
fears, Mrs. Serrano; no harm can result from it.
When your memory is restored, I will gladly take you
with me on a trip through space.â

âHow charming, to be the envy of all eyes,â said the
worldly Mrs. Serrano.

Helen Hinckley made no reply, but laughed heartily
as the two separated for the night (so Mrs. Serrano
thought); but Helen Hinckley knew they would not
meet again until her wedding day. She knew how
keenly Mrs. Serrano would feel the disappointment in
not being able to tell her to-morrow what she remembered,
and take a trip through space, yet she knew
it was for her good, and she caused the delay.

Time in the Governorâs Mansion went very quickly,
and Helen Hinckley was as happy as a mortal can be.
How that the day had arrived which would be celebrated
in her and the Governorâs honor with so much
grandeur, she could hardly realize that she was the same
Helen Hinckley who came to the great city of Chihuahua
only a short time ago, homeless, friendless and
almost penniless, searching in an ill-defined way for her
other self, and for the one who had caused her to be
an orphan in a life gone by, and who was instrumental

285
in causing her grief and sorrow in her present lifeâthe
loss of parents, home and money.

She attributed all of her good fortune to the high
life she had always aimed to live; to her delving with
things pertaining to the occult, and the taking of
âMemory Fluid.â She was happy and knew the cause,
so nothing could mar her pleasure. Before she left her
room, which was at an early hour, numerous congratulatory
messages were brought to her from President
Mortingo and others of note, as well as from many
others, from various parts of the world, wholly unknown
to herself and to the public.

When she was through reading the first lot of messages
received, she dressed herself in a close-fitting black
gown, from the bottom of which only her feet extended,
and took a trip through space. When she reached the
very outskirts of the city, she sat down near the top of
one of the Sierra Madre mountains.

The sun was just rising, and she thought she had
never seen such a beautiful sight. Out from the rays
of the sun there seemed to glide a figure of some person.
When it came closer and became more distinct,
she recognized Catalina.

The child smiled, and said: âWe will be at your wedding,
dear Helen.â

âI do not see anyone but you, sweet child,â said Miss
Hinckley.

âI mean,â continued Catalina, âMarriet Motuble and
I. She will not come, though, unless his Honor is
willing.â

âThere he comes,â said Miss Hinckley, rising to meet
the Governor; âask him.â

286
âYou were expecting me, dear life. I can hardly
realize that this is the day to which I have so long
looked forward, the day on which all the world may
know that we have conformed to the civil law and are
thereby man and wife according to human customs,â
said the great Governor, as he folded her in his arms.

âI am sure, my other self, there will be nothing to
mar our happiness, since we both remember and are conscious
of having sought for each other throughout two
existences, and knew no peace until we were found,â
replied the woman whom he loved.

âSome one must be hiding close by, dear heart; in
fact, I feel the presence of many besides you,â said the
Governor, glancing nervously around.

âMy other life, my dear heart, I was so rejoiced at
seeing you, that I neglected to tell you that we have company.
Come; there are Catalina and Marriet Motuble
sitting by that big rock.â She led him by the hand to
the rock.

âI do not see them,â cried his Honor.

âYou are too much engrossed with physical pleasures,
my other life, to see the spiritual form of the dear child
you love so well, and of the erstwhile aggressive seÃ±orita,
as you were wont to call Marriet Motuble. She wishes
to get your consent to attend our marriage,â said Miss
Hinckley.

âYou have spoken wisely, dear Helen. I am a little
out of tune this morning. I have allowed my vanity to
be flattered by the assurance from Julio that I am to be
the next President of the great United States of
America. Yes, say to Marriet Motuble, dear Helen,

287
that we will be pleased to have her at our wedding assembly,â
concluded the Governor.

The Governor and Helen Hinckley bade their spirit
friends adieu, and hand in hand they glided through
the air, and discussed the possibilities of the future in
regard to scientific discoveries and the growth of spiritual
knowledge.

So contented were they away from the bustle of life,
that they did not realize how swiftly time was flying,
and when they returned to the Governorâs Mansion, the
hour was nearly eleven-thirty. A message awaited the
Governor, announcing his nomination. Only one half-hour
remained for them to prepare for their wedding.
Guests had already arrived in large numbers. Judge
Ulloa and many of the legal fraternity and scientists
clamored for the Governor, to offer their congratulations
for the great victory he had achieved.

Mrs. Grange was there, and persisted in being allowed
to be the first to congratulate the Governor.

Poor woman! She was very much cast down. Her
husband had died recently, as a result of not being able
to recover from the disgrace of losing his position
through joining the rebel party and of having a wife
who had been a
subject
. Mrs. Grange was a changed
woman. She endeavored to live a higher and better
life, but having the physical developed more than the
spiritual, it was difficult for her to be in this life much
different in her actions, after remembering, than her
long life of dissipation, intriguing and deceit had made
her.

At Miss Hinckleyâs suggestion the Governor had given

288
her a place in the State Library as one of the under
clerks, that she might earn her daily bread. She was
still a coquette, and not much hopes were felt for her
in her present existence. It was common talk at the
library that she was laying siege to the heart of the
scientist, Guillermo Gonzales; but what impression she
had been able to make no one knew but the scientist.

Promptly at eleven-thirty the bridal party entered the
large parlors, which were beautifully decorated.

Helen Hinckley was on the arm of Guillermo Gonzales,
and Governor Lehumada had for his best man
the renowned seer, Julio Murillo.

Guillermo Gonzales handed Miss Hinckley to her betrothed,
and Judge Ulloa pronounced the words which,
according to the civil law of the land made these two
people recognized as man and wife.

When the Governor and his bride faced the audience,
the entire room seemed suddenly to be filled with thousands
of invisible musicians. Such delightful strains
of melody had never been heard by man before! The
Governor and his bride stopped, and with faces beaming
with happiness looked up, and listened intently to the
divine music that seemed to come from above.

One by one the people arose and assumed the same listening
attitude.

The melodious sounds ceased for a moment, and Mrs.
Grange ran forward, clutched the arm of the Governor
and cried: âYour Honor, forgive me; but I must
know from whence all of this music comes, or I will go
wild. I feel as if I would fall dumb with terror!â She
threw her head around, rolled her eyes from one side

289
to the other, and looked the very picture of one insane
from fright.

âDear Mrs. Grange,â said the Governor, âthe music
comes from my spirit friends; they are celebrating the
union of two lives between which there is perfect harmony.â

âCatalina leads the band. You know her, do you not,
Mrs. Grange?â asked the Governorâs bride.

âI did know her,â replied Mrs. Grange, âbut I do
not care to know her now. Oh, God, if to remember
makes one undergo such torture as this, I pray you to let
me pass into oblivion.â

âThat is how I felt,â said Juan, coming close by,
âwhen remembrance first came to me. You certainly
would not blame me for wishing to die and never know
again, when I became conscious that my first existence
upon the physical plane was as the son of the âPlunger
from Kansas.ââ

A murmur of surprise was heard from every side.
The Plunger was there, and when asked by the Governor
if he remembered Juan in a life gone by, he exclaimed:
âYes! and great God! I was not sorry I
committed suicide, for to have seen my son a clown in
a circus, when we had such great aspirations for him,
would have finished me.â

âThe wrongs committed and the evil done others consciously
and unconsciously, will be obliterated in another
life. This is a great school and, friends, we all
are learning. Our musical friends wish to give us one
more grand serenade before departing,â said the Governor.

290
Julio Murillo arose, and addressing the Governor,
said: âWith your Honorâs permission, I will deliver a
message to Mrs. Grange from her husband.â

âMy permission is granted, if Mrs. Grange wishes to
hear it delivered,â replied the Governor.

Mrs. Grange was hanging onto the arm of the scientist,
Guillermo Gonzales, and with one of her most bewitching
smiles looked up into his face and said:
âWould it be wise to hear it, SeÃ±or Gonzales?â

The great scientist smiled, in spite of his efforts to
control it, at the conspicuous and humorous position he
occupied, and said: âDear Mrs. Grange, it is due
science that you hear his message, as well as to show the
proper respect to your once dearly beloved husband.â

In a low voice, full of emotion, she said: âTell SeÃ±or
Julio to deliver it.â

Julio Murillo, the great seer, was the object of greatest
interest to all present, and in their eyes he was a
connoisseur.

He approached near the place where the Governor and
his bride had seated themselves, and with hands outstretched,
asked the Great Cause and the powers that
be, to make the great assembly of mortals present see
the spiritual serenaders; to let them surround the bridal
party, and when he had delivered the message from Mrs.
Grangeâs husband to her, they could end the marriage
celebration with their music.

Mrs. Grange leaned heavier and heavier upon the arm
of Guillermo Gonzales, and gazed upon the face of the
Governor and this bride with eyes that seemed charmed,
and her face shone with rage and jealousy.

291
The eyes of everyone were riveted upon the Governor
and his bride and the scientist

Julio Murillo stood a moment, eyes lowered as if in
silent prayer, then raising his head and stepping aside,
said: âThey are here.â

The exclamations of âOhâs,â and âOh, dear,â âI see,â
âI see,â âThat is Catalina,â and âMarriet Motuble,â
were frequently heard.

Julio said: âMrs. Grange, this is what your husband
says: âBeware, Inez; do not make so many pitfalls as
you have in the past, or you will never have an harmonious
life.ââ Mrs. Grangeâs head fell forward when
the message was finished. SeÃ±or Guillermo Gonzales
laid her on a lounge near by. Her soul had fled.

The spirit band at that moment sent forth delicious
strains of melody. Catalina played the harp and Marriet
Motuble towered above the rest at their backs and
blew a large horn; the vibrations which made the music
were so large that they could be seen by everyone.

When they had ceased, the Governor and his bride
arose to leave, after thanking those present for the honor
they had paid them. As they glided through the air out
of the room, to the amazement of all, the spiritual band
followed them, playing Miltonâs âAllegro.â

292

CHAPTER XX.

THE CELEBRATION.

President Miguel Lehumada was entering upon the
third year of his second term as President of the United
States of America.

All of the prophecies of the seer, Julio Murillo, had
been fulfilled to the letter. The nation clamored for
him to be placed at the head of the âNational School
for Scientific Development,â but he preferred to remain
in the home of President Lehumada and carry
on his scientific investigations quietly and alone, save
for the companionship of a few whom he knew to be
earnest in their investigations and of an harmonious
temperament to him.

The President and his wife were of the greatest assistance
to him, and while the President was ever busy
with the affairs of the nation, and his wife with her
social and domestic duties, they both found time to
attend to the development of their spiritual life, and
they never wearied practicing their beliefs, and thereby
showing others the beauties a knowledge of the only

real life
gave them. SeÃ±or Julio lectured once a month
to the school, and the President and his wife never failed
to be present.

The petition presented by President Lehumada,

293
when he was Governor of Chihuahua, to the United
States Congress, asking that all priests and female
members of different orders of the Church be granted
the privilege of marrying without the consent of the
Pope, and that both priests and pastors become less like
parasites upon the community, had become a law, and
the effect of it was already felt by the people.

And many men too lazy to earn an honest living, and
who claimed to have been called to preach the Gospel
of Jesus Christ, turned their attention to something else,
when they learned that if they had no means they would
be compelled to engage in some honorable work to
help support themselves, while trying to convert people
to a religion which they claim to be called to preach,
and help those whom they sought to teach, instead of
being a burden upon them.

Since the petition became a law, quite six years ago,
it was shown by statistics that the number of fine buildings
called churches, which had been built every year
previous to the passage of the law, had diminished more
than one-half, and on the other hand, the number of
homes built and well furnished by the poor, had been
on the increase each year since that time.

There seemed to be less immorality than formerly;
for each person who had no visible means of support was
given employment, if he were able to work; if not, such
persons were cared for by the State. However, there
were very few people who were disabled for work by
chronic diseases. âMemory Fluidâ had become a
powerful germ killer, and wherever it had been used,
the person using it had completely recovered from the
disease which had disabled him.

294
The use of it was, however, not compulsory; and a
great many people objected to taking it, preferring to
suffer than to know of a past existence, if they had
any.

In cases other than these, no one was incapacitated for
labor unless he was severely crippled.

Many of the formerly so-called mysteries of life, were
no longer mysteries to the great body of thinking
people, to those who had been
subjects
, and delvers in
spiritual philosophy at the âSchool for Hidden
Thought,â at Saltillo, since their awakening.

Many students at the âNational School for Scientific
Developmentâ knew the law, and continued to live
their lives upon the highest plane possible, and their
efforts were rewarded.

Juan, the former trusty servant of Governor Lehumada,
and the worldly Mrs. Serrano, both had become
valuable assistants in the diffusion of the spiritual
philosophy. Juan occupied the same position in the
private laboratory of the Governor of Chihuahua, Guillermo
Gonzales, as Julio Murillo, the great seer and constant
associate and adviser of President Lehumada, did
when he first entered the employment of the then Governor,
Miguel Lehumada, of Chihuahua.

Mrs. Serrano occupied the position she formerly did,
that of housekeeper, with the exception that she had
added to her name, the name of Degatau; in other
words, she had become the wife of Juan Degatau. They
were happy in their new life, yet both realized that many
existences on earth would have to be experienced by
them before they could have the harmonious conditions

295
necessary for the highest knowledge of Law.
They did their duty from day to day, as they understood
it, and grew stronger in the knowledge of truth
by so doing. Strict surveillance was for a long time
kept over the revolutionists, after they abandoned their
evil designs upon the government to all outward appearances.
At the same time, from the day they surrendered,
which was on the first inaugural day of
President Lehumada, they were permitted to return to
their homes and continue their usual avocation unmolested.
Of the large number who had no employment
and no means of support, the government gave
them work for which they were well paid; at the same
time, the government saw that the work was well done,
at the proper time. No one realized better than the
famous author of âLiquid from the Sunâs Rays,â and
the great seer, Julio Murillo, that âan idle brain is the
devilâs worshipââto use the language frequently
heard on all sides in the nineteenth centuryâand suitable
employment was given to everybody who could not
procure it themselves.

There were very few people, even amongst the uninitiated,
who were given to shrugging their shoulders at
people whose calling on earth was very lowly, and had
not sufficient money to live in the same style that they
did. For they never knew who of them had taken
âMemory Fluid,â or belonged to the great society of the
initiated.

The OâSullivans and OâRileys, who now sped around
in their gilded vehicles, were the descendants of Pat and
Tim, who run the joints around the corner in an early

296
day; and of Mary McPherson and Susan OâHallihan,
both of whom did the scrubbing at the big folksâ houses.
These people, before the discovery of âMemory Fluid,â
boasted of their social position and inherited wealth;
for they never dreamed that anyone knew or would
ever know that Pat and Tim killed a man for his money
in their âjoint,â one night. Since the trial of the
âPlunger from Kansas,â they had changed so much
that strangers even noticed it.

Oneâs social position is rated by the knowledge he has
of the Great Cause and his desire to learn spiritual
truths.

Money no one scorns, but it is only considered as the
medium by which commerce is carried on; the means
by which the necessities of life can be obtained the most
independently. The sustaining of self in the highest
manner possible is the doctrine the teachers of the occult
inculcate. To be true to self, and never a burden on
anyone else, was the first great lesson. A lesson which
none but the initiated could understand.

âThe beauties which emanate from the Great Cause
are so numerous, and so plainly demonstrate the great
âWorld without end,â that physical man, in his present
state of grossness, would not be able to get more than a
peep into the real life during the present existence,â
Julio Murillo, the great seer, often said to those seeking
admittance into the âNational School for Scientific
Development,â when they wished to be placed in touch
with the Hidden immediately, âTake âMemory Fluid.ââ

All such persons were first advised to take âMemory
Fluid,â after which there would be some hopes for them.

297
Preparations were begun for the celebration of the
discovery of âLiquid from the Sunâs Rays,â and the entire
nation had been invited to take part, by the promulgators
of the âSchools for the Study of the Occult,â
and others devoted to scientific researches in general.
It was to be a great event, and every one looked forward
to it with great pleasure.

Not since the marriage day of the President, now
seven years past, had the public ever been treated to a
serenade like the one given that day by the spirit friends
of the Governor of Chihuahua, and his bride. And
many hoped the same music would come again; yet
the possibility of hearing it was not held out as an
inducement to secure a large attendance.

The great auditorium, connected with the grand
Museum at Washington, built under the supervision of
President Lehumada, his wife, and the well-known seer,
Julio Murillo, had a seating capacity of fifty thousand
people, with acoustics, heating, lighting, cooling and
ventilating facilities unsurpassed.

While there were more people from a distance, in
Washington, who had come to attend the celebration, it
was hoped that everyone who desired would have the opportunity
of being present at one or more of the lectures,
to be delivered during the three days of celebration.

Francisco de UrdiÃ±ola, president of the âSchool for
Hidden Thought,â of Saltillo; Guillermo Gonzales,
Governor of Chihuahua; Juan and his wife; and âThe
Plunger from Kansas,â were conspicuous figures at the
national capital. The Plunger was as young in appearance
as ever, but he had less money than formerly,

298
to spend on such occasions as the present one, where
it had been his delight to make everyone wonder at the
freedom with which he spent large sums of money.

He wore the first new suit of clothes he had bought
since the conclusion of his famous trial. Yet the money
he had taken by stealth in the life long since passed,
was not paid in full. He was working to fulfill his
promise to lift that burden he had helped to place upon
himself in his present existence, for he well knew that
if he failed to pay the debt now, he would be compelled
to do so in a life to come.

One of his objects in coming to Washington was to try
to secure employment at higher wages than he was able
to get in Chihuahua.

âWhat do you wish to do?â asked a newspaper correspondent,
who was interviewing the Plunger on the
street.

âOh, it does not matter what I do; but it is the price
I get, about which I am concerned. I mean, of course,
it does not matter what I do, so long as I am engaged in
an honest business,â replied the Plunger.

âThen you do not care to make another âplungeâ on
someoneâs else money, in order to make a stake?â
asked the reporter, with a meaning smile.

âWell, hardly; the taste I had of that in the year of
our Lord eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, as the
makers of the chronicle said then, has not left me yet.
No son, no more plunging for me. Remorse of conscience
is the greatest punishment one can have. Take
the advice of a man who
remembers
, son, and never engage
in dishonest transactions. There will come a day,

299
as sure as fate, when you will have to repair the wrongs
you have committed, if you do,â was the fatherly advice
of the Plunger.

The reporter stood quietly by for a few moments, no
doubt revolving in his mind the many exaggerated
stories he had written about different people, and
wondering if he would, in a life to come, be compelled
to retract all he had said.

The Plunger noticed his thoughtful attitude, and
said: âWhen you take âMemory Fluid,â you will ponder
more seriously than you do now. Come, help a fellow
if you can. I want to get this burden of debt off my
shoulders.â

âIt was on that subject I was studying, my friend.
I know a man who wants a head gardener; wages, one
hundred dollars a month and board,â replied the reporter.

âI hope I can get the job,â said the Plunger, as the
two walked on arm in arm.

âWe will see about it at once, then go to the auditorium
to hear the discourses upon the great scientific
subjects. Ah, and I must have you in the description
of this great celebration. What a lucky fellow I am
to have fallen in with you this morning. I will be promoted
to city editor on account of getting the first
interview with you,â said the reporter, delighted over
the prospects.

âIf I get the job you mention,â replied the Plunger,
âno one else can have an interview with me.â

On seeing a man coming toward them, the reporter
became very excited, and exclaimed: âThere is Judge

300
Barrow now! I am in luck again. He is the man who
wants a gardener.â

At that moment Judge Barrow met them. He
seemed to be very much in a hurry and when the reporter
spoke to him, he said, hurriedly: âNo interview
this morning, Tom. Nothing new.â

âBut, Judge, one moment. You want a gardener, do
you not?â exclaimed the reporter, hurrying after him.

âYes,â said the judge, turning around.

âWell, I have just the man here for you,â said the
reporter, delighted at his success so far.

âWhat experience has the man had?â asked the
judge.

âOh, he has had none; he is the âPlunger from
Kansasâ!â

âThe what? The âPlunger from Kansasâ!â exclaimed
Judge Barrow, eying him closely.

âThatâs my title, Judge. I have had no experience;
for since I made the memorable plunge, I have lived the
life of a gentleman through the biggest part of three
existences, but since I had to whack up, I have been
dead-broke, and am still in debt. I will get out of debt
in this life, if I am given a chance.â

âAh, you are a noble young fellow. You can have
the job, at one hundred and fifty dollars a month,
and board. Show up in the morning, young man. It
is a great thing for me to have such a noted person for
my gardener,â concluded the judge, as he left the two
men spellbound.

âAfter all, I am not having such a bad time. It is
not so bad to repent, after all,â said the Plunger.

301
âNor to have been a
subject
,â added the reporter.
âWho are the people coming toward us; they seem to
recognize you. Are they some of your friends in a life
gone by?â asked the reporter.

âYes, and no,â seriously said the Plunger. âThe
man, however queer it may sound to you, was once my
son. In this life, no; and the woman upon whose arm
he is clinging is his wife.â

âHow strange! The man is much older than you.
This is an age of marvels, and when I stop to consider,
I am at sea without a pilot, or in a wilderness without a
guide,â commented the reporter.

At that moment Mr. and Mrs. Degatau came up,
smiling, no doubt, at seeing on the street of a big,
strange city, a familiar face.

Juan Degatau held his hand out to the Plunger, and
said: âPapa, I am glad to see you. This celebration
could have not have been much of a success, had you
stayed away.â

âThat I had no thought of doing. I have a twofold
purpose in being here, however,â replied the Plunger.

âYes?â said Mrs. Degatau, without further question.

âAh, what a crowd of distinguished looking people.
I must get out amongst them and see if I cannot get
items for to-morrowâs paper, which
The Hidden
does
not contain,â said the reporter, moving away uneasily.

âThat you cannot do,â said Juan; âfor if the seer
sees fit to report to
The Hidden
, the most powerful
daily paper in the world, the trivial affairs you are collecting
this morning, your paper will fall short of being
anything but second-class.â

302
âNow,
son
,â said the Plunger, his tone betraying the
satire he evidently tried to conceal, âdonât be so hard on
Tom. He is doing the best he knows how. What
were your thoughts before you
remembered
? Tom has
done for me this morning, more than my son (and he
has been a
subject
) ever offered to do for me.â

âThe reporter, no doubt, was born to a higher plane
in his first existence, than your son,â curtly replied
Juan, âand that accounts for his natural kindness of
heart. The curse of having to live through three existences
in punishment, on account of the house in which
one lived his first existence being so full of sin, did not
fall to his lot. Good morning, gentlemen, good
morning; my wife and I are going to the auditorium.
If we tarry longer, we will not get in. I wish you
and Tom, Papa, much luck.â Juan bowed very low,
and together with his wife, walked very rapidly toward
the auditorium.

The third and last evening of the great celebration,
in honor of the seventh anniversary of the marriage of
the President of the United States, Miguel Lehumada,
and Helen Hinckley, was at hand.

Sharply at eight oâclock, the house already filled to
its utmost for an hour or more, arose at a signal given by
the master of ceremonies, to witness the arrival of the
President, his wife, and their beautiful twins, a boy
and a girl six years old, moving through the air. When
they took the seats assigned for them on the rostrum,
the audience sat down. After the Presidentâs address
of welcome, there was an eloquent discourse by the great
seer, Julio Murillo, upon the âDivine in Man,â in which

303
he spoke of the discovery of âMemory Fluid,â the great
destroyer of germs, without any but good effects upon
the physical, making man in his physical state cognizant
of all his past, and creating in him a desire for
a knowledge of the Great Cause.

At the close of his remarkable address, he spoke of
the strange effect of Ebony Fluid upon animal matter,
after the spirit had taken its flight. A screen was removed
from the side of the rostrum, which disclosed to
view the ebonized bodies of Francisco R. Cantu, Father
Hernandez, Rev. J. T. Note, Marriet Motuble, and last,
of the little child, Catalina Martinet.

These bodies had been in the National Museum for
some months, but had never been unveiled for inspection.
The history of all the persons, whose bodies,
black as midnight and as hard as flint, stood before
them, was familiar to everybody, and were objects of
very great interest in consequence.

The two children of the President ran from one
ebonized body to the other, while Julio Murillo explained
which had been occupied respectively by the
five persons who had made many pages of history teem
with interest.

The little girl was a beautiful brown-eyed child, retiring
and quiet and a very striking likeness of the
President.

The boy, much taller than the girl, was aggressive,
and quite the contrast of his sister Helen. His hair
was light brown and curly, and his eyes were blue.

Little
Miguey, as he was called, after his famous father,
was strikingly unlike either of his parents.

304
His great talent for music had been cultivated by
the best masters, and at the tender age of six years
he could handle skillfully any musical instrument; but
his fondness for the horn was shown by the masterly
way in which he played upon it.

The committee in charge of the music for the celebration
secured the consent of the President and his
wife to allow their talented son to play the horn in
the last musical number on the program, for the last
evening of the celebration. It would be his first appearance
in public, yet the fact gave him no concern.

The large horn used by the child hung on a rack on
the rostrum, and was an object of much interest, as
well as the ebony figures.

Julio Murillo concluded his talk upon the subject of
ebony bodies, by saying: âThe souls which once occupied
these bodies, are here in spirit, and with others
whom we knew in a life gone by, will now appear before
us, and we will have music from the spirit choir.â

The stillness in the room was appalling to those who
did not know, to the uninitiated, until the music began.

At first the Spirit Choir was invisible; but as the
music grew in power, first one, then another could be
seen surrounding the Presidentâs family, until all who
were taking part were seen. After the conclusion of
their music, Mrs. Lehumada arose to thank them, and
when she had expressed her thanks for their music and
for the pleasure she had at seeing them, she concluded:
âThere is but one thing concerning this celebration
which makes me sad, and that is, dear spirit friends,
that you did not bring a little child I once loved dearly,

305
Catalina Martinet; and another, a lady whom I grew
to wish for after she passed to spirit landâshe of
whom I speak was called Marriet Motuble. And her
music on the horn in spirit was only to be heard once,
to be wished for again.â

âDear Mamma,â cried little Helen, âdo you not know
that it is I, who was Catalina whom you loved? I
came back to you and my dear papaâthat is Catalinaâs
ebonized body. I live again.â

The President clasped the child in his arms, and the
audience went wild with delight.

Little Miguey took his big horn from off the rack,
and stepping to the front, said: âAnd it was I, dear
Mamma, who was Marriet Motubleâand you shall
hear my music.â

The crowd arose in amazement, and while the strange
child played divinely upon the big horn, the spirit band
disappeared.

And when the child laid his horn up, his mother
arose, and clasping him in her arms, said: âAfter
all, there are, even to the initiated, many things which
cannot be explained.â

And there was heard throughout the great auditorium
the musical murmur of âAmen.â

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
